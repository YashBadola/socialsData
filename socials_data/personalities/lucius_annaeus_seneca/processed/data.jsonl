ANNAEUS SENECA, ON BENEFITS\nBy Seneca\nEdited by Aubrey Stewart\nPREFACE\nSeneca, the favourite classic of the early fathers of the church and\nof the Middle Ages, whom Jerome, Tertullian, and Augustine speak of as\n\"Seneca noster,\" who was believed to have corresponded with St. Paul,\nand upon whom [Footnote: On the \"De Clementia,\" an odd subject for the\nman who burned Servetus alive for differing with him.] Calvin wrote a\ncommentary, seems almost forgotten in modern times. Perhaps some of his\npopularity may have been due to his being supposed to be the author\nof those tragedies which the world has long ceased to read, but which\ndelighted a period that preferred Euripides to Aeschylus: while casuists\nmust have found congenial matter in an author whose fantastic cases of\nconscience are often worthy of Sanchez or Escobar. Yet Seneca's morality\nis always pure, and from him we gain, albeit at second hand, an\ninsight into the doctrines of the Greek philosophers, Zeno, Epicurus,\nChrysippus, &c., whose precepts and system of religious thought had in\ncultivated Roman society taken the place of the old worship of Jupiter\nand Quirinus.\nSince Lodge's edition (fol. 1614), no complete translation of Seneca has\nbeen published in England, though Sir Roger L'Estrange wrote paraphrases\nof several Dialogues, which seem to have been enormously popular,\nrunning through more than sixteen editions. I think we may conjecture\nthat Shakespeare had seen Lodge's translation, from several allusions to\nphilosophy, to that impossible conception \"the wise man,\" and especially\nfrom a passage in \"All's Well that ends Well,\" which seems to breathe\nthe very spirit of \"De Beneficiis.\"\n\"'Tis pity--\nThat wishing well had not a body in it\nWhich might be felt: that we, the poorer born,\nWhose baser stars do shut us up in wishes,\nMight with effects of them follow our friends\nAnd show what we alone must think; which never\nReturns us thanks.\"\n\"All's Well that ends Well,\" Act i. sc. 1.\nThough, if this will not fit the supposed date of that play, he may\nhave taken the idea from \"The Woorke of Lucius Annaeus Seneca concerning\nBenefyting, that is too say, the dooing, receyving, and requyting of\ngood turnes, translated out of Latin by A. Golding. J. Day, London,\n1578.\" And even during the Restoration, Pepys's ideal of virtuous and\nlettered seclusion is a country house in whose garden he might sit on\nsummer afternoons with his friend, Sir W. Coventry, \"it maybe, to read a\nchapter of Seneca.\" In sharp contrast to this is Vahlen's preface to the\nminor Dialogues, which he edited after the death of his friend Koch, who\nhad begun that work, in which he remarks that \"he has read much of this\nwriter, in order to perfect his knowledge of Latin, for otherwise he\nneither admires his artificial subtleties of thought, nor his childish\nmannerisms of style\" (Vahlen, preface, p. v., ed. 1879, Jena).\nYet by the student of the history of Rome under the Caesars, Seneca is\nnot to be neglected, because, whatever may be thought of the intrinsic\nmerit of his speculations, he represents, more perhaps even than\nTacitus, the intellectual characteristics of his age, and the tone of\nsociety in Rome--nor could we well spare the gossiping stories which we\nfind imbedded in his graver dissertations. The following extract from\nDean Merivale's \"History of the Romans under the Empire\" will show the\nestimate of him which has been formed by that accomplished writer:--\n\"At Rome, we, have no reason, to suppose that Christianity was only the\nrefuge of the afflicted and miserable; rather, if we may lay any stress\non the documents above referred to, it was first embraced by persons in\na certain grade of comfort and respectability; by persons approaching\nto what we should call the MIDDLE CLASSES in their condition, their\neducation, and their moral views. Of this class Seneca himself was the\nidol, the oracle; he was, so to speak, the favourite preacher of the\nmore intelligent and humane disciples of nature and virtue. Now the\nwritings of Seneca show, in their way, a real anxiety among this class\nto raise the moral tone of mankind around them; a spirit of reform, a\nzeal for the conversion of souls, which, though it never rose, indeed,\nunder the teaching of the philosophers, to boiling heat, still simmered\nwith genial warmth on the surface of society. Far different as was their\nsocial standing-point, far different as were the foundations and the\npresumed sanctions of their teaching respectively, Seneca and St.\nPaul were both moral reformers; both, be it said with reverence, were\nfellow-workers in the cause of humanity, though the Christian could\nlook beyond the proximate aims of morality and prepare men for a final\ndevelopment on which the Stoic could not venture to gaze. Hence there\nis so much in their principles, so much even in their language, which\nagrees together, so that the one has been thought, though it must be\nallowed without adequate reason, to have borrowed directly from the\nother. [Footnote: It is hardly necessary to refer to the pretended\nletters between St. Paul and Seneca. Besides the evidence from style,\nsome of the dates they contain are quite sufficient to condemn them as\nclumsy forgeries. They are mentioned, but with no expression of belief\nin their genuineness, by Jerome and Augustine. See Jones, \"On the\nCanon,\" ii. 80.]\n\"But the philosopher, be it remembered, discoursed to a large and not\ninattentive audience, and surely the soil was not all unfruitful on\nwhich his seed was scattered when he proclaimed that God dwells not\nin temples of wood and stone, nor wants the ministrations of human\nhands;[Footnote: Sen., Ep. 95, and in Lactantius, Inst. vi.] that He has\nno delight in the blood of victims:[Footnote: Ep. 116: \"Colitur Deus\nnon tauris sed pia et recta voluntate.\"] that He is near to all His\ncreatures:[Footnote: Ep. 41, 73.] that His Spirit resides in men's\nhearts:[Footnote: Ep. 46: \"Sacer intra nos spiritus sedet.\"] that\nall men are truly His offspring:[Footnote: \"De Prov,\" i.] that we are\nmembers of one body, which is God or Nature;[Footnote: Ep. 93, 95:\n\"Membra sumus magni corporis.\"] that men must believe in God before\nthey can approach Him:[Footnote: Ep. 95: \"Primus Deorum cultus est\nDeos credere.\"] that the true service of God is to be like unto\nHim:[Footnote: Ep. 95: \"Satis coluit quisquis imitatus est.\"] that all\nmen have sinned, and none performed all the works of the law:[Footnote:\nSen. de Ira. i. 14; ii. 27: \"Quis est iste qui se profitetur omnibus\nlegibus innocentem?\"] that God is no respecter of nations, ranks, or\nconditions, but all, barbarian and Roman, bond and free, are alike under\nHis all-seeing Providence.[Footnote: \"De Benef.,\" iii. 18: \"Virtus omnes\nadmittit, libertinos, servos, reges.\" These and many other passages\nare collected by Champagny, ii. 546, after Fabricius and others, and\ncompared with well-known texts of Scripture. The version of the Vulgate\nshows a great deal of verbal correspondence. M. Troplong remarks, after\nDe Maistre, that Seneca has written a fine book on Providence, for which\nthere was not even a name at Rome in the time of Cicero.--\"L'Influence\ndu Christianisme,\" &c., i., ch. 4.]\n\"St. Paul enjoined submission and obedience even to the tyranny of\nNero, and Seneca fosters no ideas subversive of political subjection.\nEndurance is the paramount virtue of the Stoic. To forms of government\nthe wise man was wholly indifferent; they were among the\nexternal circumstances above which his spirit soared in serene\nself-contemplation. We trace in Seneca no yearning for a restoration\nof political freedom, nor does he even point to the senate, after\nthe manner of the patriots of the day, as a legitimate check to the\nautocracy of the despot. The only mode, in his view, of tempering\ntyranny is to educate the tyrant himself in virtue. His was the\nself-denial of the Christians, but without their anticipated\ncompensation. It seems impossible to doubt that in his highest flights\nof rhetoric--and no man ever recommended the unattainable with a finer\ngrace--Seneca must have felt that he was labouring to build up a house\nwithout foundations; that his system, as Caius said of his style, was\nsand without lime. He was surely not unconscious of the inconsistency of\nhis own position, as a public man and a minister, with the theories to\nwhich he had wedded himself; and of the impossibility of preserving in\nit the purity of his character as a philosopher or a man. He was aware\nthat in the existing state of society at Rome, wealth was necessary to\nmen high in station; wealth alone could retain influence, and a poor\nminister became at once contemptible. The distributor of the Imperial\nfavours must have his banquets, his receptions, his slaves and freedmen;\nhe must possess the means of attracting if not of bribing; he must not\nseem too virtuous, too austere, among an evil generation; in order to do\ngood at all he must swim with the stream, however polluted it might be.\nAll this inconsistency Seneca must have contemplated without blenching;\nand there is something touching in the serenity he preserved amidst the\nconflict that must have perpetually raged between his natural sense\nand his acquired principles. Both Cicero and Seneca were men of many\nweaknesses, and we remark them the more because both were pretenders to\nunusual strength of character; but while Cicero lapsed into political\nerrors, Seneca cannot be absolved of actual crime. Nevertheless, if we\nmay compare the greatest masters of Roman wisdom together, the Stoic\nwill appear, I think, the more earnest of the two, the more anxious to\ndo his duty for its own sake, the more sensible of the claims of mankind\nupon him for such precepts of virtuous living as he had to give. In an\nage of unbelief and compromise he taught that Truth was positive and\nVirtue objective. He conceived, what never entered Cicero's mind, the\nidea of improving his fellow-creatures; he had, what Cicero had not, a\nheart for conversion to Christianity.\"\nTo this eloquent account of Seneca's position and of the tendency of his\nwritings I have nothing to add. The main particulars of his life,\nhis Spanish extraction (like that of Lacan and Martial), his father's\ntreatises on Rhetoric, his mother Helvia, his brothers, his wealth, his\nexile in Corsica, his outrageous flattery of Claudius and his satiric\npoem on his death--\"The Vision of Judgment,\" Merivale calls it, after\nLord Byron--his position as Nero's tutor, and his death, worthy at once\nof a Roman and a Stoic, by the orders of that tyrant, may be read of in\n\"The History of the Romans under the Empire,\" or in the article \"Seneca\"\nin the \"Dictionary of Classical Biography,\" and need not be reproduced\nhere: but I cannot resist pointing out how entirely Grote's view of the\n\"Sophists\" as a sort of established clergy, and Seneca's account of the\nvarious sects of philosophers as representing the religious thought of\nthe time, is illustrated by his anecdote of Julia Augusta, the mother of\nTiberius, better known to English readers as Livia the wife of Augustus,\nwho in her first agony of grief at the loss of her first husband applied\nto his Greek philosopher, Areus, as to a kind of domestic chaplain, for\nspiritual consolation. (\"Ad Marciam de Consolatione,\" ch. iv.)\nI take this opportunity of expressing my gratitude to the Rev. J. E.\nB. Mayor, Professor of Latin in the University of Cambridge, for his\nkindness in finding time among his many and important literary labours\nfor reading and correcting the proofs of this work.\nThe text which I have followed for De Beneficiis is that of Gertz,\nBerlin (1876.).\nAUBREY STEWART\nLondon, March, 1887.\nCONTENTS\nBOOK I.

A. SENECA\nON BENEFITS.\nDEDICATED TO\nAEBUTIUS LIBERALIS.\nBOOK I.\nI.\nAmong the numerous faults of those who pass their lives recklessly and\nwithout due reflexion, my good friend Liberalis, I should say that there\nis hardly any one so hurtful to society as this, that we neither know\nhow to bestow or how to receive a benefit. It follows from this that\nbenefits are badly invested, and become bad debts: in these cases it is\ntoo late to complain of their not being returned, for they were thrown\naway when we bestowed them. Nor need we wonder that while the greatest\nvices are common, none is more common than ingratitude: for this I see\nis brought about by various causes. The first of these is, that we do\nnot choose worthy persons upon whom to bestow our bounty, but although\nwhen we are about to lend money we first make a careful enquiry into\nthe means and habits of life of our debtor, and avoid sowing seed in a\nworn-out or unfruitful soil, yet without any discrimination we scatter\nour benefits at random rather than bestow them. It is hard to say\nwhether it is more dishonourable for the receiver to disown a benefit,\nor for the giver to demand a return of it: for a benefit is a loan, the\nrepayment of which depends merely upon the good feeling of the debtor.\nTo misuse a benefit like a spendthrift is most shameful, because we\ndo not need our wealth but only our intention to set us free from the\nobligation of it; for a benefit is repaid by being acknowledged. Yet\nwhile they are to blame who do not even show so much gratitude as to\nacknowledge their debt, we ourselves are to blame no less. We find many\nmen ungrateful, yet we make more men so, because at one time we harshly\nand reproachfully demand some return for our bounty, at another we are\nfickle and regret what we have given, at another we are peevish and\napt to find fault with trifles. By acting thus we destroy all sense of\ngratitude, not only after we have given anything, but while we are in\nthe act of giving it. Who has ever thought it enough to be asked for\nanything in an off-hand manner, or to be asked only once? Who, when he\nsuspected that he was going to be asked for any thing, has not frowned,\nturned away his face, pretended to be busy, or purposely talked without\nceasing, in order not to give his suitor a chance of preferring his\nrequest, and avoided by various tricks having to help his friend in his\npressing need? and when driven into a corner, has not either put the\nmatter off, that is, given a cowardly refusal, or promised his help\nungraciously, with a wry face, and with unkind words, of which he seemed\nto grudge the utterance. Yet no one is glad to owe what he has not\nso much received from his benefactor, as wrung out of him. Who can be\ngrateful for what has been disdainfully flung to him, or angrily cast\nat him, or been given him out of weariness, to avoid further trouble? No\none need expect any return from those whom he has tired out with delays,\nor sickened with expectation. A benefit is received in the same temper\nin which it is given, and ought not, therefore, to be given carelessly,\nfor a man thanks himself for that which he receives without the\nknowledge of the giver. Neither ought we to give after long delay,\nbecause in all good offices the will of the giver counts for much, and\nhe who gives tardily must long have been unwilling to give at all. Nor,\nassuredly, ought we to give in offensive manner, because human nature is\nso constituted that insults sink deeper than kindnesses; the remembrance\nof the latter soon passes away, while that of the former is treasured in\nthe memory; so what can a man expect who insults while he obliges? All\nthe gratitude which he deserves is to be forgiven for helping us. On\nthe other hand, the number of the ungrateful ought not to deter us\nfrom earning men's gratitude; for, in the first place, their number is\nincreased by our own acts. Secondly, the sacrilege and indifference\nto religion of some men does not prevent even the immortal gods from\ncontinuing to shower their benefits upon us: for they act according to\ntheir divine nature and help all alike, among them even those who so ill\nappreciate their bounty. Let us take them for our guides as far as the\nweakness of our mortal nature permits; let us bestow benefits, not put\nthem out at interest. The man who while he gives thinks of what he will\nget in return, deserves to be deceived. But what if the benefit turns\nout ill? Why, our wives and our children often disappoint our hopes,\nyet we marry--and bring up children, and are so obstinate in the face of\nexperience that we fight after we have been beaten, and put to sea after\nwe have been shipwrecked. How much more constancy ought we to show in\nbestowing benefits! If a man does not bestow benefits because he has\nnot received any, he must have bestowed them in order to receive them\nin return, and he justifies ingratitude, whose disgrace lies in not\nreturning benefits when able to do so. How many are there who are\nunworthy of the light of day? and nevertheless the sun rises. How many\ncomplain because they have been born? yet Nature is ever renewing our\nrace, and even suffers men to live who wish that they had never lived.\nIt is the property of a great and good mind to covet, not the fruit of\ngood deeds, but good deeds themselves, and to seek for a good man even\nafter having met with bad men. If there were no rogues, what glory would\nthere be in doing good to many? As it is, virtue consists in bestowing\nbenefits for which we are not certain of meeting with any return, but\nwhose fruit is at once enjoyed by noble minds. So little influence ought\nthis to have in restraining us from doing good actions, that even though\nI were denied the hope of meeting with a grateful man, yet the fear of\nnot having my benefits returned would not prevent my bestowing them,\nbecause he who does not give, forestalls the vice of him who is\nungrateful. I will explain what I mean. He who does not repay a benefit,\nsins more, but he who does not bestow one, sins earlier.\n\"If thou at random dost thy bounties waste,\nMuch must be lost, for one that's rightly placed.\"\nII. In the former verse you may blame two things, for one should not\ncast them at random, and it is not right to waste anything, much less\nbenefits; for unless they be given with judgement, they cease to be\nbenefits, and, may be called by any other name you please. The meaning\nof the latter verse is admirable, that one benefit rightly bestowed\nmakes amends for the loss of many that have been lost. See, I pray you,\nwhether it be not truer and more worthy of the glory of the giver, that\nwe should encourage him to give, even though none of his gifts should\nbe worthily placed. \"Much must be lost.\" Nothing is lost because he\nwho loses had counted the cost before. The book-keeping of benefits\nis simple: it is all expenditure; if any one returns it, that is clear\ngain; if he does not return it, it is not lost, I gave it for the sake\nof giving. No one writes down his gifts in a ledger, or like a grasping\ncreditor demands repayment to the day and hour. A good man never thinks\nof such matters, unless reminded of them by some one returning his\ngifts; otherwise they become like debts owing to him. It is a base usury\nto regard a benefit as an investment. Whatever may have been the result\nof your former benefits, persevere in bestowing others upon other men;\nthey will be all the better placed in the hands of the ungrateful, whom\nshame, or a favourable opportunity, or imitation of others may some day\ncause to be grateful. Do not grow weary, perform your duty, and act\nas becomes a good man. Help one man with money, another with credit,\nanother with your favour; this man with good advice, that one with\nsound maxims. Even wild beasts feel kindness, nor is there any animal\nso savage that good treatment will not tame it and win love from it. The\nmouths of lions are handled by their keepers with impunity; to obtain\ntheir food fierce elephants become as docile as slaves: so that constant\nunceasing kindness wins the hearts even of creatures who, by their\nnature, cannot comprehend or weigh the value of a benefit. Is a man\nungrateful for one benefit? perhaps he will not be so after receiving\na second. Has he forgotten two kindnesses? perhaps by a third he may be\nbrought to remember the former ones also.\nIII. He who is quick to believe that he has thrown away his benefits,\ndoes really throw them away; but he who presses on and adds new benefits\nto his former ones, forces out gratitude even from a hard and forgetful\nbreast. In the face of many kindnesses, your friend will not dare to\nraise his eyes; let him see you whithersoever he turns himself to escape\nfrom his remembrance of you; encircle him with your benefits. As for the\npower and property of these, I will explain it to you if first you will\nallow me to glance at a matter which does not belong to our subject, as\nto why the Graces are three in number, why they are sisters, why hand in\nhand, and why they are smiling and young, with a loose and transparent\ndress. Some writers think that there is one who bestows a benefit,\none who receives it, and a third who returns it; others say that they\nrepresent the three sorts of benefactors, those who bestow, those who\nrepay, and those who both receive and repay them. But take whichever\nyou please to be true; what will this knowledge profit us? What is the\nmeaning of this dance of sisters in a circle, hand in hand? It means\nthat the course of a benefit is from hand to hand, back to the giver;\nthat the beauty of the whole chain is lost if a single link fails, and\nthat it is fairest when it proceeds in unbroken regular order. In the\ndance there is one, esteemed beyond the others, who represents the\ngivers of benefits. Their faces are cheerful, as those of men who give\nor receive benefits are wont to be. They are young, because the memory\nof benefits ought not to grow old. They are virgins, because benefits\nare pure and untainted, and held holy by all; in benefits there should\nbe no strict or binding conditions, therefore the Graces wear loose\nflowing tunics, which are transparent, because benefits love to be seen.\nPeople who are not under the influence of Greek literature may say that\nall this is a matter of course; but there can be no one who would think\nthat the names which Hesiod has given them bear upon our subject. He\nnamed the eldest Aglaia, the middle one Euphrosyne, the third Thalia.\nEvery one, according to his own ideas, twists the meaning of these\nnames, trying to reconcile them with some system, though Hesiod merely\ngave his maidens their names from his own fancy. So Homer altered\nthe name of one of them, naming her Pasithea, and betrothed her to a\nhusband, in order that you may know that they are not vestal virgins.\n[Footnote: i.e. not vowed to chastity.]\nI could find another poet, in whose writings they are girded, and wear\nthick or embroidered Phrygian robes. Mercury stands with them for the\nsame reason, not because argument or eloquence commends benefits,\nbut because the painter chose to do so. Also Chrysippus, that man of\npiercing intellect who saw to the very bottom of truth, who speaks\nonly to the point, and makes use of no more words than are necessary to\nexpress his meaning, fills his whole treatise with these puerilities,\ninsomuch that he says but very little about the duties of giving,\nreceiving, and returning a benefit, and has not so much inserted fables\namong these subjects, as he has inserted these subjects among a mass of\nfables. For, not to mention what Hecaton borrows from him, Chrysippus\ntells us that the three Graces are the daughters of Jupiter and\nEurynome, that they are younger than the Hours, and rather more\nbeautiful, and that on that account they are assigned as companions\nto Venus. He also thinks that the name of their mother bears upon the\nsubject, and that she is named Eurynome because to distribute benefits\nrequires a wide inheritance; as if the mother usually received her name\nafter her daughters, or as if the names given by poets were true. In\ntruth, just as with a 'nomenclator' audacity supplies the place of\nmemory, and he invents a name for every one whose name he cannot\nrecollect, so the poets think that it is of no importance to speak the\ntruth, but are either forced by the exigencies of metre, or attracted by\nsweetness of sound, into calling every one by whatever name runs neatly\ninto verse. Nor do they suffer for it if they introduce another name\ninto the list, for the next poet makes them bear what name he pleases.\nThat you may know that this is so, for instance Thalia, our present\nsubject of discourse, is one of the Graces in Hesiod's poems, while in\nthose of Homer she is one of the Muses.\nIV. But lest I should do the very thing which I am blaming, I will pass\nover all these matters, which are so far from the subject that they are\nnot even connected with it. Only do you protect me, if any one attacks\nme for putting down Chrysippus, who, by Hercules, was a great man, but\nyet a Greek, whose intellect, too sharply pointed, is often bent and\nturned back upon itself; even when it seems to be in earnest it only\npricks, but does not pierce. Here, however, what occasion is there for\nsubtlety? We are to speak of benefits, and to define a matter which is\nthe chief bond of human society; we are to lay down a rule of life, such\nthat neither careless openhandedness may commend itself to us under the\nguise of goodness of heart, and yet that our circumspection, while it\nmoderates, may not quench our generosity, a quality in which we ought\nneither to exceed nor to fall short. Men must be taught to be willing\nto give, willing to receive, willing to return; and to place before\nthemselves the high aim, not merely of equalling, but even of surpassing\nthose to whom they are indebted, both in good offices and in good\nfeeling; because the man whose duty it is to repay, can never do so\nunless he out-does his benefactor; [Footnote: That is, he never comes up\nto his benefactor unless he leaves him behind: he can only make a dead\nheat of it by getting a start.] the one class must be taught to look\nfor no return, the other to feel deeper gratitude. In this noblest of\ncontests to outdo benefits by benefits, Chrysippus encourages us by\nbidding us beware lest, as the Graces are the daughters of Jupiter, to\nact ungratefully may not be a sin against them, and may not wrong those\nbeauteous maidens. Do thou teach me how I may bestow more good things,\nand be more grateful to those who have earned my gratitude, and how the\nminds of both parties may vie with one another, the giver in forgetting,\nthe receiver in remembering his debt. As for those other follies, let\nthem be left to the poets, whose purpose is merely to charm the ear and\nto weave a pleasing story; but let those who wish to purify men's\nminds, to retain honour in their dealings, and to imprint on their minds\ngratitude for kindnesses, let them speak in sober earnest and act with\nall their strength; unless you imagine, perchance, that by such flippant\nand mythical talk, and such old wives' reasoning, it is possible for us\nto prevent that most ruinous consummation, the repudiation of benefits.\nV. However, while I pass over what is futile and irrelevant I must\npoint out that the first thing which we have to learn is, what we owe in\nreturn for a benefit received. One man says that he owes the money which\nhe has received, another that he owes a consulship, a priesthood,\na province, and so on. These, however, are but the outward signs of\nkindnesses, not the kindnesses themselves. A benefit is not to be felt\nand handled, it is a thing which exists only in the mind. There is\na great difference between the subject-matter of a benefit, and the\nbenefit itself. Wherefore neither gold, nor silver, nor any of those\nthings which are most highly esteemed, are benefits, but the benefit\nlies in the goodwill of him who gives them. The ignorant take notice\nonly of that which comes before their eyes, and which can be owned and\npassed from hand to hand, while they disregard that which gives these\nthings their value. The things which we hold in our hands, which we see\nwith our eyes, and which our avarice hugs, are transitory, they may\nbe taken from us by ill luck or by violence; but a kindness lasts even\nafter the loss of that by means of which it was bestowed; for it is\na good deed, which no violence can undo. For instance, suppose that I\nransomed a friend from pirates, but another pirate has caught him and\nthrown him into prison. The pirate has not robbed him of my benefit, but\nhas only robbed him of the enjoyment of it. Or suppose that I have saved\na man's children from a shipwreck or a fire, and that afterwards disease\nor accident has carried them off; even when they are no more, the\nkindness which was done by means of them remains. All those things,\ntherefore, which improperly assume the name of benefits, are means by\nwhich kindly feeling manifests itself. In other cases also, we find a\ndistinction between the visible symbol and the matter itself, as when a\ngeneral bestows collars of gold, or civic or mural crowns upon any one.\nWhat value has the crown in itself? or the purple-bordered robe? or the\nfasces? or the judgment-seat and car of triumph? None of these things\nis in itself an honour, but is an emblem of honour. In like manner,\nthat which is seen is not a benefit--it is but the trace and mark of a\nbenefit.\nVI. What, then, is a benefit? It is the art of doing a kindness which\nboth bestows pleasure and gains it by bestowing it, and which does its\noffice by natural and spontaneous impulse. It is not, therefore, the\nthing which is done or given, but the spirit in which it is done or\ngiven, that must be considered, because a benefit exists, not in that\nwhich is done or given, but in the mind of the doer or giver. How great\nthe distinction between them is, you may perceive from this, that\nwhile a benefit is necessarily good, yet that which is done or given is\nneither good nor bad. The spirit in which they are given can exalt small\nthings, can glorify mean ones, and can discredit great and precious\nones; the objects themselves which are sought after have a neutral\nnature, neither good nor bad; all depends upon the direction given them\nby the guiding spirit from which things receive their shape. That which\nis paid or handed over is not the benefit itself, just as the honour\nwhich we pay to the gods lies not in the victims themselves, although\nthey be fat and glittering with gold, [Footnote: Alluding to the\npractice of gilding the horns of the victims.] but in the pure and holy\nfeelings of the worshippers.\nThus good men are religious, though their offering be meal and their\nvessels of earthenware; whilst bad men will not escape from their\nimpiety, though they pour the blood of many victims upon the altars.\nVII. If benefits consisted of things, and not of the wish to benefit,\nthen the more things we received the greater the benefit would be. But\nthis is not true, for sometimes we feel more gratitude to one who gives\nus trifles nobly, who, like Virgil's poor old soldier, \"holds himself as\nrich as kings,\" if he has given us ever so little with a good will a man\nwho forgets his own need when he sees mine, who has not only a wish but\na longing to help, who thinks that he receives a benefit when he\nbestows one, who gives as though he would receive no return, receives a\nrepayment as though he had originally given nothing, and who watches for\nand seizes an opportunity of being useful. On the other hand, as I said\nbefore, those gifts which are hardly wrung from the giver, or which drop\nunheeded from his hands, claim no gratitude from us, however great they\nmay appear and may be. We prize much more what comes from a willing\nhand, than what comes from a full one. This man has given me but little,\nyet more he could not afford, while what that one has given is much\nindeed, but he hesitated, he put it off, he grumbled when he gave it,\nhe gave it haughtily, or he proclaimed it aloud, and did it to please\nothers, not to please the person to whom he gave it; he offered it to\nhis own pride, not to me.\nVIII. As the pupils of Socrates, each in proportion to his means, gave\nhim large presents, Aeschines, a poor pupil, said, \"I can find nothing\nto give you which is worthy of you; I feel my poverty in this respect\nalone. Therefore I present you with the only thing I possess, myself. I\npray that you may take this my present, such as it is, in good part, and\nmay remember that the others, although they gave you much, yet left for\nthemselves more than they gave.\" Socrates answered, \"Surely you have\nbestowed a great present upon me, unless perchance you set a small value\nupon yourself. I will accordingly take pains to restore you to yourself\na better man than when I received you.\" By this present Aeschines outdid\nAlcibiades, whose mind was as great as his Wealth, and all the splendour\nof the most wealthy youths of Athens.\nIX. You see how the mind even in the straitest circumstances finds the\nmeans of generosity. Aeschines seems to me to have said, \"Fortune, it\nis in vain that you have made me poor; in spite of this I will find a\nworthy present for this man. Since I can give him nothing of yours, I\nwill give him something of my own.\" Nor need you suppose that he held\nhimself cheap; he made himself his own price. By a stroke of genius this\nyouth discovered a means of presenting Socrates to himself. We must not\nconsider how great presents are, but in what spirit they are given.\nA rich man is well spoken of if he is clever enough to render himself\neasy of access to men of immoderate ambition, and although he intends to\ndo nothing to help them, yet encourages their unconscionable hopes; but\nhe is thought the worse of if he be sharp of tongue, sour in appearance,\nand displays his wealth in an invidious fashion. For men respect and\nyet loathe a fortunate man, and hate him for doing what, if they had the\nchance, they would do themselves.\n*       *       *       *       *       *       *\nMen nowadays no longer secretly, but openly outrage the wives of others,\nand allow to others access to their own wives. A match is thought\ncountrified, uncivilized, in bad style, and to be protested against by\nall matrons, if the husband should forbid his wife to appear in\npublic in a litter, and to be carried about exposed to the gaze of all\nobservers. If a man has not made himself notorious by a LIAISON with\nsome mistress, if he does not pay an annuity to some one else's wife,\nmarried women speak of him as a poor-spirited creature, a man given\nto low vice, a lover of servant girls. Soon adultery becomes the most\nrespectable form of marriage, and widowhood and celibacy are commonly\npractised. No one takes a wife unless he takes her away from some one\nelse. Now men vie with one another in wasting what they have stolen, and\nin collecting together what they have wasted with the keenest avarice;\nthey become utterly reckless, scorn poverty in others, fear personal\ninjury more than anything else, break the peace by their riots, and by\nviolence and terror domineer over those who are weaker than themselves.\nNo wonder that they plunder provinces and offer the seat of judgment for\nsale, knocking it down after an auction to the highest bidder, since it\nis the law of nations that you may sell what you have bought.\nX. However, my enthusiasm has carried me further than I intended, the\nsubject being an inviting one. Let me, then, end by pointing out that\nthe disgrace of these crimes does not belong especially to our own time.\nOur ancestors before us have lamented, and our children after us will\nlament, as we do, the ruin, of morality, the prevalence of vice, and\nthe gradual deterioration of mankind; yet these things are really\nstationary, only moved slightly to and fro like the waves which at\none time a rising tide washes further over the land, and at another an\nebbing one restrains within a lower water mark. At one time the chief\nvice will be adultery, and licentiousness will exceed all bounds; at\nanother time a rage for feasting will be in vogue, and men will waste\ntheir inheritance in the most shameful of all ways, by the kitchen; at\nanother, excessive care for the body, and a devotion to personal beauty\nwhich implies ugliness of mind; at another time, injudiciously granted\nliberty will show itself in wanton recklessness and defiance of\nauthority; sometimes there will be a reign of cruelty both in public\nand private, and the madness of the civil wars will come upon us, which\ndestroy all that is holy and inviolable. Sometimes even drunkenness will\nbe held in honour, and it will be a virtue to swallow most wine. Vices\ndo not lie in wait for us in one place alone, but hover around us in\nchangeful forms, sometimes even at variance one with another, so that\nin turn they win and lose the field; yet we shall always be obliged to\npronounce the same verdict upon ourselves, that we are and always were\nevil, and, I unwillingly add, that we always shall be. There always will\nbe homicides, tyrants, thieves, adulterers, ravishers, sacrilegious,\ntraitors: worse than all these is the ungrateful man, except we consider\nthat all these crimes flow from ingratitude, without which hardly any\ngreat wickedness has ever grown to full stature. Be sure that you guard\nagainst this as the greatest of crimes in yourself, but pardon it as the\nleast of crimes in another. For all the injury which you suffer is this:\nyou have lost the subject-matter of a benefit, not the benefit itself,\nfor you possess unimpaired the best part of it, in that you have given\nit. Though we ought to be careful to bestow our benefits by preference\nupon those who are likely to show us gratitude for them, yet we must\nsometimes do what we have little hope will turn out well, and bestow\nbenefits upon those who we not only think will prove ungrateful, but who\nwe know have been so. For instance, if I should be able to save a\nman's children from a great danger with no risk to myself, I should not\nhesitate to do so. If a man be worthy I would defend him even with my\nblood, and would share his perils; if he be unworthy, and yet by\nmerely crying for help I can rescue him from robbers, I would without\nreluctance raise the shout which would save a fellow-creature.\nXI. The next point to be defined is, what kind of benefits are to be\ngiven, and in what manner. First let us give what is necessary, next\nwhat is useful, and then what is pleasant, provided that they be\nlasting. We must begin with what is necessary, for those things which\nsupport life affect the mind very differently from, those which adorn\nand improve it. A man may be nice, and hard to please, in things which\nhe can easily do without, of which he can say, \"Take them back; I do not\nwant them, I am satisfied with what I have.\" Sometimes, we wish not\nonly to, return what we have received, but even to throw it away. Of\nnecessary things, the first class consists of things without which we\ncannot live; the second, of things without which we ought not to live;\nand the third, of things without which we should not care to live. The\nfirst class are, to be saved from the hands of the enemy, from the anger\nof tyrants, from proscription, and the various other perils which\nbeset human life. By averting any one of these, we shall earn gratitude\nproportionate to the greatness of the danger, for when men think of\nthe greatness of the misery from which they have been saved, the terror\nwhich they have gone through enhances the value of our services. Yet we\nought not to delay rescuing any one longer than we are obliged, solely\nin order to make his fears add weight to our services. Next come those\nthings without which we can indeed live, but in such a manner that it\nwould be better to die, such as liberty, chastity, or a good conscience.\nAfter these are what we have come to hold dear by connexion and\nrelationship and long use and custom, such as our wives and children,\nour household gods, and so on, to which the mind so firmly attaches\nitself that separation from them seems worse than death.\nAfter these come useful things, which form a very wide and varied\nclass; in which will be money, not in excess, but enough for living in\na moderate style; public office, and, for the ambitious, due advancement\nto higher posts; for nothing can be more useful to a man than to be\nplaced in a position in which he can benefit himself. All benefits\nbeyond these are superfluous, and are likely to spoil those who receive\nthem. In giving these we must be careful to make them acceptable by\ngiving them at the appropriate time, or by giving things which are not\ncommon, but such as few people possess, or at any rate few possess in\nour times; or again, by giving things in such a manner, that though not\nnaturally valuable, they become so by the time and place at which they\nare given. We must reflect what present will produce the most pleasure,\nwhat will most frequently come under the notice of the possessor of it,\nso that whenever he is with it he may be with us also; and in all cases\nwe must be careful not to send useless presents, such as hunting weapons\nto a woman or old man, or books to a rustic, or nets to catch wild\nanimals to a quiet literary man. On the other hand, we ought to be\ncareful, while we wish to send what will please, that we do not send\nwhat will insultingly remind our friends of their failings, as, for\nexample, if we send wine to a hard drinker or drugs to an invalid, for a\npresent which contains an allusion to the shortcomings of the receiver,\nbecomes an outrage.\nXII. If we have a free choice as to what to give, we should above all\nchoose lasting presents, in order that our gift may endure as long\nas possible; for few are so grateful as to think of what they have\nreceived, even when they do not see it. Even the ungrateful remember\nus by our gifts, when they are always in their sight and do not allow\nthemselves to be forgotten, but constantly obtrude and stamp upon the\nmind the memory of the giver. As we never ought to remind men of what we\nhave given them, we ought all the more to choose presents that will be\npermanent; for the things themselves will prevent the remembrance of the\ngiver from fading away. I would more willingly give a present of plate\nthan of coined money, and would more willingly give statues than clothes\nor other things which are soon worn out. Few remain grateful after the\npresent is gone: many more remember their presents only while they make\nuse of them. If possible, I should like my present not to be consumed;\nlet it remain in existence, let it stick to my friend and share his\nlife. No one is so foolish as to need to be told not to send gladiators\nor wild beasts to one who has just given a public show, or not to send\nsummer clothing in winter time, or winter clothing in summer. Common\nsense must guide our benefits; we must consider the time and the place,\nand the character of the receiver, which are the weights in the\nscale, which cause our gifts to be well or ill received. How far more\nacceptable a present is, if we give a man what he has not, than if we\ngive him what he has plenty of! if we give him what he has long been\nsearching for in vain, rather than what he sees everywhere! Let us make\npresents of things which are rare and scarce rather than costly, things\nwhich even a rich man will be glad of, just as common fruits, such as\nwe tire of after a few days, please us if they have ripened before the\nusual season. People will also esteem things which no one else has given\nto them, or which we have given to no one else.\nXIII. When the conquest of the East had flattered Alexander of Macedon\ninto believing himself to be more than man, the people of Corinth sent\nan embassy to congratulate him, and presented him with the franchise of\ntheir city. When Alexander smiled at this form of courtesy, one of\nthe ambassadors said, \"We have never enrolled any stranger among our\ncitizens except Hercules and yourself.\" Alexander willingly accepted the\nproffered honour, invited the ambassadors to his table, and showed them\nother courtesies. He did not think of who offered the citizenship, but\nto whom they had granted it; and being altogether the slave of glory,\nthough he knew neither its true nature or its limits, had followed in\nthe footsteps of Hercules and Bacchus, and had not even stayed his march\nwhere they ceased; so that he glanced aside from the givers of this\nhonour to him with whom he shared it, and fancied that the heaven to\nwhich his vanity aspired was indeed opening before him when he was made\nequal to Hercules. In what indeed did that frantic youth, whose only\nmerit was his lucky audacity, resemble Hercules? Hercules conquered\nnothing for himself; he travelled throughout the world, not coveting for\nhimself but liberating the countries which he conquered, an enemy to bad\nmen, a defender of the good, a peacemaker both by sea and land; whereas\nthe other was from his boyhood a brigand and desolator of nations, a\npest to his friends and enemies alike, whose greatest joy was to be the\nterror of all mankind, forgetting that men fear not only the fiercest\nbut also the most cowardly animals, because of their evil and venomous\nnature.\nXIV. Let us now return to our subject. He who bestows a benefit without\ndiscrimination, gives what pleases no one; no one considers himself to\nbe under any obligation to the landlord of a tavern, or to be the guest\nof any one with whom he dines in such company as to be able to say,\n\"What civility has he shown to me? no more than he has shown to that\nman, whom he scarcely knows, or to that other, who is both his personal\nenemy and a man of infamous character. Do you suppose that he wished to\ndo me any honour? not so, he merely wished to indulge his own vice of\nprofusion.\" If you wish men to be grateful for anything, give it but\nseldom; no one can bear to receive what you give to all the world.\nYet let no one gather from this that I wish to impose any bonds upon\ngenerosity; let her go to what lengths she will, so that she go a steady\ncourse, not at random. It is possible to bestow gifts in such a manner\nthat each of those who receive them, although he shares them with many\nothers, may yet feel himself to be distinguished from the common herd.\nLet each man have some peculiarity about his gift which may make him\nconsider himself more highly favoured than the rest. He may say, \"I\nreceived the same present that he did, but I never asked for it.\" \"I\nreceived the same present, but mine was given me after a few days,\nwhereas he had earned it by long service.\" \"Others have the same\npresent, but it was not given to them with the same courtesy and\ngracious words with which it was given to me.\" \"That man got it because\nhe asked for it; I did not ask.\" \"That man received it as well as I, but\nthen he could easily return it; one has great expectations from a rich\nman, old and childless, as he is; whereas in giving the same present to\nme he really gave more, because he gave it without the hope of receiving\nany return for it.\" Just as a courtesan divides her favours among\nmany men, so that no one of her friends is without some proof of her\naffection, so let him who wishes his benefits to be prized consider how\nhe may at the same time gratify many men, and nevertheless give each one\nof them some especial mark of favour to distinguish him from the rest.\nXV. I am no advocate of slackness in giving benefits: the more and the\ngreater they are, the more praise they will bring to the giver. Yet\nlet them be given with discretion; for what is given carelessly and\nrecklessly can please no one. Whoever, therefore, supposes that in\ngiving this advice I wish to restrict benevolence and to confine it to\nnarrower limits, entirely mistakes the object of my warning. What virtue\ndo we admire more than benevolence? Which do we encourage more? Who\nought to applaud it more than we Stoics, who preach the brotherhood of\nthe human race? What then is it? Since no impulse of the human mind can\nbe approved of, even though it springs from a right feeling, unless it\nbe made into a virtue by discretion, I forbid generosity to degenerate\ninto extravagance. It is, indeed, pleasant to receive a benefit with\nopen arms, when reason bestows it upon the worthy, not when it is flung\nhither or thither thoughtlessly and at random; this alone we care to\ndisplay and claim as our own. Can you call anything a benefit, if\nyou feel ashamed to mention the person who gave it you? How far more\ngrateful is a benefit, how far more deeply does it impress itself upon\nthe mind, never to be forgotten, when we rejoice to think not so much of\nwhat it is, as from whom we have received it! Crispus Passienus was wont\nto say that some men's advice was to be preferred to their presents,\nsome men's presents to their advice; and he added as an example, \"I\nwould rather have received advice from Augustus than a present; I would\nrather receive a present from Claudius than advice.\" I, however, think\nthat one ought not to wish for a benefit from any man whose judgement\nis worthless. What then? Ought we not to receive what Claudius gives? We\nought; but we ought to regard it as obtained from fortune, which may at\nany moment turn against us. Why do we separate this which naturally is\nconnected? That is not a benefit, to which the best part of a benefit,\nthat it be bestowed with judgment, is wanting: a really great sum of\nmoney, if it be given neither with discernment nor with good will, is\nno more a benefit than if it remained hoarded. There are, however,\nmany things which we ought not to reject, yet for which we cannot feel\nindebted.\nBOOK II.\nI.\nLet us consider, most excellent Liberalis, what still remains of the\nearlier part of the subject; in what way a benefit should be bestowed. I\nthink that I can point out the shortest way to this; let us give in the\nway in which we ourselves should like to receive. Above all we should\ngive willingly, quickly, and without any hesitation; a benefit commands\nno gratitude if it has hung for a long time in the hands of the giver,\nif he seems unwilling to part with it, and gives it as though he were\nbeing robbed of it. Even though some delay should intervene, let us\nby all means in our power strive not to seem to have been in two minds\nabout giving it at all. To hesitate is the next thing to refusing to\ngive, and destroys all claim to gratitude. For just as the sweetest part\nof a benefit is the kindly feeling of the giver, it follows that one who\nhas by his very delay proved that he gives unwillingly, must be regarded\nnot as having given anything, but as having been unable to keep it from\nan importunate suitor. Indeed, many men are made generous by want of\nfirmness. The most acceptable benefits are those which are waiting for\nus to take them, which are easy to be received, and offer themselves to\nus, so that the only delay is caused by the modesty of the receiver.\nThe best thing of all is to anticipate a person's wishes; the next, to\nfollow them; the former is the better course, to be beforehand with our\nfriends by giving them what they want before they ask us for it, for the\nvalue of a gift is much enhanced by sparing an honest man the misery of\nasking for it with confusion and blushes. He who gets what he asked\nfor does not get it for nothing, for indeed, as our austere ancestors\nthought, nothing is so dear as that which is bought by prayers. Men\nwould be much more modest in their petitions to heaven, if these had to\nbe made publicly; so that even when addressing the gods, before whom\nwe can with all honour bend our knees, we prefer to pray silently and\nwithin ourselves.\nII. It is unpleasant, burdensome, and covers one with shame to have to\nsay, \"Give me.\" You should spare your friends, and those whom you wish\nto make your friends, from having to do this; however quick he may be,\na man gives too late who gives what he has been asked for. We ought,\ntherefore, to divine every man's wishes, and when we have discovered\nthem, to set him free from the hard necessity of asking; you may be sure\nthat a benefit which comes unasked will be delightful and will not be\nforgotten. If we do not succeed in anticipating our friends, let us at\nany rate cut them short when they ask us for anything, so that we may\nappear to be reminded of what we meant to do, rather than to have been\nasked to do it. Let us assent at once, and by our promptness make it\nappear that we meant to do so even before we were solicited. As in\ndealing with sick persons much depends upon when food is given, and\nplain water given at the right moment sometimes acts as a remedy, so\na benefit, however slight and commonplace it may be, if it be promptly\ngiven without losing a moment of time, gains enormously in importance,\nand wins our gratitude more than a far more valuable present given after\nlong waiting and deliberation. One who gives so readily must needs give\nwith good will; he therefore gives cheerfully and shows his disposition\nin his countenance.\nIII. Many who bestow immense benefits spoil them by their silence or\nslowness of speech, which gives them an air of moroseness, as they say\n\"yes\" with a face which seems to say \"no.\" How much better is it to join\nkind words to kind actions, and to enhance the value of our gifts by a\ncivil and gracious commendation of them! To cure your friend of being\nslow to ask a favour of you, you may join to your gift the familiar\nrebuke, \"I am angry with you for not having long ago let me know what\nyou wanted, for having asked for it so formally, or for having made\ninterest with a third party.\" \"I congratulate myself that you have been\npleased to make trial of me; hereafter, if you want anything, ask for it\nas your right; however, for this time I pardon your want of manners.\"\nBy so doing you will cause him to value your friendship more highly\nthan that, whatever it may have been, which he came to ask of you. The\ngoodness and kindness of a benefactor never appears so great as when on\nleaving him one says, \"I have to-day gained much; I am more pleased at\nfinding him so kind than if I had obtained many times more of this, of\nwhich I was speaking, by some other means; I never can make any adequate\nreturn to this man for his goodness.\"\nIV. Many, however, there are who, by harsh words and contemptuous\nmanner, make their very kindnesses odious, for by speaking and acting\ndisdainfully they make us sorry that they have granted our requests.\nVarious delays also take place after we have obtained a promise; and\nnothing is more heartbreaking than to be forced to beg for the very\nthing which you already have been promised. Benefits ought to be\nbestowed at once, but from some persons it is easier to obtain the\npromise of them than to get them. One man has to be asked to remind our\nbenefactor of his purpose; another, to bring it into effect; and thus a\nsingle present is worn away in passing through many hands, until hardly\nany gratitude is left for the original promiser, since whoever we are\nforced to solicit after the giving of the promise receives some of the\ngratitude which we owe to the giver. Take care, therefore, if you\nwish your gifts to be esteemed, that they reach those to whom they are\npromised entire, and, as the saying is, without any deduction. Let no\none intercept them or delay them; for no one can take any share of the\ngratitude due for your gifts without robbing you of it.\nV. Nothing is more bitter than long uncertainty; some can bear to have\ntheir hopes extinguished better than to have them deferred. Yet many\nmen are led by an unworthy vanity into this fault of putting off the\naccomplishment of their promises, merely in order to swell the crowd of\ntheir suitors, like the ministers of royalty, who delight in prolonging\nthe display of their own arrogance, hardly thinking themselves possessed\nof power unless they let each man see for a long time how powerful they\nare. They do nothing promptly, or at one sitting; they are indeed swift\nto do mischief, but slow to do good. Be sure that the comic poet speaks\nthe most absolute truth in the verses:--\n\"Know you not this? If you your gifts delay,\nYou take thereby my gratitude away.\"\nAnd the following lines, the expression of virtuous pain--a\nhigh-spirited man's misery,--\n\"What thou doest, do quickly;\"\nand:--\n\"Nothing in the world\nIs worth this trouble; I had rather you\nRefused it to me now.\"\nWhen the mind begins through weariness to hate the promised benefit, or\nwhile it is wavering in expectation of it, how can it feel grateful\nfor it? As the most refined cruelty is that which prolongs the torture,\nwhile to kill the victim at once is a kind of mercy, since the extremity\nof torture brings its own end with it--the interval is the worst part of\nthe execution--so the shorter time a benefit hangs in the balance, the\nmore grateful it is to the receiver. It is possible to look forward with\nanxious disquietude even to good things, and, seeing that most benefits\nconsist in a release from some form of misery, a man destroys the value\nof the benefit which he confers, if he has the power to relieve us,\nand yet allows us to suffer or to lack pleasure longer than we need.\nKindness always eager to do good, and one who acts by love naturally\nacts at once; he who does us good, but does it tardily and with long\ndelays, does not do so from the heart. Thus he loses two most important\nthings: time, and the proof of his good will to us; for a lingering\nconsent is but a form of denial.\nVI. The manner in which things are said or done, my Liberalis, forms a\nvery important part of every transaction. We gain much by quickness, and\nlose much by slowness. Just as in darts, the strength of the iron head\nremains the same, but there is an immeasureable difference between the\nblow of one hurled with the full swing of the arm and one which merely\ndrops from the hand, and the same sword either grazes or pierces\naccording as the blow is delivered; so, in like manner, that which\nis given is the same, but the manner in which it is given makes the\ndifference. How sweet, how precious is a gift, when he who gives does\nnot permit himself to be thanked, and when while he gives he forgets\nthat he has given! To reproach a man at the very moment that you are\ndoing him a service is sheer madness; it is to mix insult with your\nfavours. We ought not to make our benefits burdensome, or to add any\nbitterness to them. Even if there be some subject upon which you wish to\nwarn your friend, choose some other time for doing so.\nVII. Fabius Verrucosus used to compare a benefit bestowed by a harsh man\nin an offensive manner to a gritty loaf of bread, which a hungry man is\nobliged to receive, but which is painful to eat. When Marius Nepos of\nthe praetorian guard asked Tiberius Caesar for help to pay his debts,\nTiberius asked him for a list of his creditors; this is calling a\nmeeting of creditors, not paying debts. When the list was made out,\nTiberius wrote to Nepos telling him that he had ordered the money to be\npaid, and adding some offensive reproaches. The result of this was\nthat Nepos owed no debts, yet received no kindness; Tiberius, indeed,\nrelieved him from his creditors, but laid him under no obligation.\nTiberius, however, had some design in doing so; I imagine he did not\nwish more of his friends to come to him with the same request. His mode\nof proceeding was, perhaps, successful in restraining men's extravagant\ndesires by shame, but he who wishes to confer benefits must follow quite\na different path. In all ways you should make your benefit as acceptable\nas possible by presenting it in the most attractive form; but the method\nof Tiberius is not to confer benefits, but to reproach.\nVIII. Moreover, if incidentally I should say what I think of this part\nof the subject, I do not consider that it is becoming even to an emperor\nto give merely in order to cover a man with shame. \"And yet,\" we are\ntold, \"Tiberius did not even by this means attain his object; for after\nthis a good many persons were found to make the same request. He ordered\nall of them to explain the reasons of their indebtedness before the\nsenate, and when they did so, granted them certain definite sums of\nmoney.\" This is not an act of generosity, but a reprimand. You may call\nit a subsidy, or an imperial contribution; it is not a benefit, for\nthe receiver cannot think of it without shame. I was summoned before a\njudge, and had to be tried at bar before I obtained what I asked for.\nIX. Accordingly, all writers on ethical philosophy tell us that some\nbenefits ought to be given in secret, others in public. Those things\nwhich it is glorious to receive, such as military decorations or public\noffices, and whatever else gains in value the more widely it is known,\nshould be conferred in public; on the other hand, when they do not\npromote a man or add to his social standing, but help him when in\nweakness, in want, or in disgrace, they should be given silently, and so\nas to be known only to those who profit by them.\nX. Sometimes even the person who is assisted must be deceived, in order\nthat he may receive our bounty without knowing the source from whence\nit flows. It is said that Arcesilaus had a friend who was poor, but\nconcealed his poverty; who was ill, yet tried to hide his disorder, and\nwho had not money for the necessary expenses of existence. Without his\nknowledge, Arcesilaus placed a bag of money under his pillow, in order\nthat this victim of false shame might rather seem to find what he wanted\nthan to receive. \"What,\" say you, \"ought he not to know from whom he\nreceived it?\" Yes; let him not know it at first, if it be essential to\nyour kindness that he should not; afterwards I will do so much for him,\nand give him so much that he will perceive who was the giver of the\nformer benefit; or, better still, let him not know that he has received\nany thing, provided I know that I have given it. \"This,\" you say, \"is to\nget too little return for one's goodness.\" True, if it be an investment\nof which you are thinking; but if a gift, it should be given in the way\nwhich will be of most service to the receiver. You should be satisfied\nwith the approval of your own conscience; if not, you do not really\ndelight in doing good, but in being seen to do good. \"For all that,\" say\nyou, \"I wish him to know it.\" Is it a debtor that you seek for? \"For\nall that, I wish him to know it.\" What! though it be more useful, more\ncreditable, more pleasant for him not to know his benefactor, will you\nnot consent to stand aside? \"I wish him to know.\" So, then, you would\nnot save a man's life in the dark? I do not deny that, whenever the\nmatter admits of it, one ought to take into consideration the pleasure\nwhich we receive from the joy of the receiver of our kindness; but if he\nought to have help and is ashamed to receive it--if what we bestow upon\nhim pains him unless it be concealed--I forbear to make my benefits\npublic. Why should I not refrain from hinting at my having given him\nanything, when the first and most essential rule is, never to reproach\na man with what you have done for him, and not even to remind him of it.\nThe rule for the giver and receiver of a benefit is, that the one should\nstraightway forget that he has given, the other should never forget that\nhe has received it.\nXI. A constant reference to one's own services wounds our friend's\nfeelings. Like the man who was saved from the proscription under\nthe triumvirate by one of Caesar's friends, and afterwards found it\nimpossible to endure his preserver's arrogance, they wish to cry, \"Give\nme back to Caesar.\" How long will you go on saying, \"I saved you, I\nsnatched you from the jaws of death?\" This is indeed life, if I remember\nit by my own will, but death if I remember it at yours; I owe you\nnothing, if you saved me merely in order to have some one to point at.\nHow long do you mean to lead me about? how long do you mean to forbid\nme to forget my adventure? If I had been a defeated enemy, I should\nhave been led in triumph but once. We ought not to speak of the benefits\nwhich we have conferred; to remind men of them is to ask them to return\nthem. We should not obtrude them, or recall the memory of them; you\nshould only remind a man of what you have given him by giving him\nsomething else. We ought not even to tell others of our good deeds.\nHe who confers a benefit should be silent, it should be told by the\nreceiver; for otherwise you may receive the retort which was made to one\nwho was everywhere boasting of the benefit which he had conferred: \"You\nwill not deny,\" said his victim, \"that you have received a return for\nit?\" \"When?\" asked he. \"Often,\" said the other, \"and in many places,\nthat is, wherever and whenever you have told the story.\" What need is\nthere for you to speak, and to take the place which belongs to another?\nThere is a man who can tell the story in a way much more to your credit,\nand thus you will gain glory for not telling it your self. You would\nthink me ungrateful if, through your own silence, no one is to know of\nyour benefit. So far from doing this, even if any one tells the story in\nour presence, we ought to make answer, \"He does indeed deserve much more\nthan this, and I am aware that I have not hitherto done any great things\nfor him, although I wish to do so.\" This should not be said jokingly,\nnor yet with that air by which some persons repel those whom they\nespecially wish to attract. In addition to this, we ought to act with\nthe greatest politeness towards such persons. If the farmer ceases his\nlabours after he has put in the seed, he will lose what he has sown; it\nis only by great pains that seeds are brought to yield a crop; no plant\nwill bear fruit unless it be tended with equal care from first to last,\nand the same rule is true of benefits. Can any benefits be greater than\nthose which children receive from their parents? Yet these benefits\nare useless if they be deserted while young, if the pious care of the\nparents does not for a long time watch over the gift which they have\nbestowed. So it is with other benefits; unless you help them, you will\nlose them; to give is not enough, you must foster what you have given.\nIf you wish those whom you lay under an obligation to be grateful to\nyou, you must not merely confer benefits upon them, but you must also\nlove them. Above all, as I said before, spare their ears; you will weary\nthem if you remind them of your goodness, if you reproach them with it\nyou will make them hate you. Pride ought above all things to be avoided\nwhen you confer a benefit. What need have you for disdainful airs,\nor swelling phrases? the act itself will exalt you. Let us shun vain\nboasting: let us be silent, and let our deeds speak for us. A benefit\nconferred with haughtiness not only wins no gratitude, but causes\ndislike.\nXII. Gaius Caesar granted Pompeius Pennus his life, that is, if not\nto take away life be to grant it; then, when Pompeius was set free and\nreturning thanks to him, he stretched out his left foot to be kissed.\nThose who excuse this action, and say that it was not done through\narrogance, say that he wished to show him a gilded, nay a golden slipper\nstudded with pearls. \"Well,\" say they, \"what disgrace can there be in a\nman of consular rank kissing gold and pearls, and what part of Caesar's\nwhole body was it less pollution to kiss?\" So, then, that man,\nthe object of whose life was to change a free state into a Persian\ndespotism, was not satisfied when a senator, an aged man, a man who had\nfilled the highest offices in the state, prostrated himself before him\nin the presence of all the nobles, just as the vanquished prostrate\nthemselves before their conqueror! He discovered a place below his knees\ndown to which he might thrust liberty. What is this but trampling upon\nthe commonwealth, and that, too, with the left foot, though you may say\nthat this point does not signify? It was not a sufficiently foul and\nfrantic outrage for the emperor to sit at the trial of a consular for\nhis life wearing slippers, he must needs push his shoes into a senator's\nface.\nXIII. O pride, the silliest fault of great good fortune! how pleasant\nit is to take nothing from thee! how dost thou turn all benefits into\noutrages! how dost thou delight in all excess! how ill all things become\nthee! The higher thou risest the lower thou art, and provest that\nthe good things by which thou art so puffed up profit thee not; thou\nspoilest all that thou givest. It is worth while to inquire why it is\nthat pride thus swaggers and changes the form and appearance of her\ncountenance, so that she prefers a mask to her own face. It is pleasant\nto receive gifts when they are conferred in a kindly and gentle manner,\nwhen a superior in giving them does not exalt himself over me, but shows\nas much good feeling as possible, placing himself on a level with me,\ngiving without parade, and choosing a time when I am glad of his help,\nrather than waiting till I am in the bitterest need. The only way by\nwhich you can prevail upon proud men not to spoil their gifts by their\narrogance is by proving to them that benefits do not appear greater\nbecause they are bestowed with great pomp and circumstance; that no one\nwill think them greater men for so doing, and that excessive pride is a\nmere delusion which leads men to hate even what they ought to love.\nXIV. There are some things which injure those who receive them, things\nwhich it is not a benefit to give but to withhold; we should therefore\nconsider the usefulness of our gift rather than the wish of the\npetitioner to receive it; for we often long for hurtful things, and are\nunable to discern how ruinous they are, because our judgment is biassed\nby our feelings; when, however, the longing is past, when that frenzied\nimpulse which masters our good sense has passed away, we abhor those\nwho have given us hurtful gifts. As we refuse cold water to the sick,\nor swords to the grief-stricken or remorseful, and take from the insane\nwhatever they might in their delirium use to their own destruction, so\nmust we persist in refusing to give anything whatever that is hurtful,\nalthough our friends earnestly and humbly, nay, sometimes even most\npiteously beg for it. We ought to look at the end of our benefits as\nwell as the beginning, and not merely to give what men are glad to\nreceive, but what they will hereafter be glad to have received. There\nare many who say, \"I know that this will do him no good, but what am I\nto do? he begs for it, I cannot withstand his entreaties. Let him see\nto it; he will blame himself, not me.\" Not so: you he will blame, and\ndeservedly; when he comes to his right mind, when the frenzy which\nnow excites him has left him, how can he help hating the man who has\nassisted him to harm and to endanger himself? It is a cruel kindness to\nallow one's self to be won over into granting that which injures those\nwho beg for it. Just as it is the noblest of acts to save men from harm\nagainst their will, so it is but hatred, under the mask of civility, to\ngrant what is harmful to those who ask for it. Let us confer benefits of\nsuch a kind, that the more they are made use of the better they please,\nand which never can turn into injuries. I never will give money to a man\nif I know that he will pay it to an adulteress, nor will I be found in\nconnexion with any wicked act or plan; if possible, I will restrain men\nfrom crime; if not, at least I will never assist them in it. Whether my\nfriend be driven into doing wrong by anger, or seduced from the path of\nsafety by the heat of ambition, he shall never gain the means of doing\nmischief except from himself, nor will I enable him one day to say,\n\"He ruined me out of love for me.\" Our friends often give us what our\nenemies wish us to receive; we are driven by the unseasonable fondness\nof the former into the ruin which the latter hope will befall us. Yet,\noften as it is the case, what can be more shameful than that there\nshould be no difference between a benefit and hatred?\nXV. Let us never bestow gifts which may recoil upon us to our shame.\nAs the sum total of friendship consists in making our friends equal to\nourselves, we ought to consider the interests of both parties; I must\ngive to him that wants, yet so that I do not want myself; I must help\nhim who is perishing, yet so that I do not perish myself, unless by so\ndoing I can save a great man or a great cause. I must give no benefit\nwhich it would disgrace me to ask for. I ought not to make a small\nbenefit appear a great one, nor allow great benefits to be regarded as\nsmall; for although it destroys all feeling of gratitude to treat what\nyou give like a creditor, yet you do not reproach a man, but merely\nset off your gift to the best advantage by letting him know what it is\nworth. Every man must consider what his resources and powers are, so\nthat we may not give either more or less than we are able. We must also\nconsider the character and position of the person to whom we give, for\nsome men are too great to give small gifts, while others are too small\nto receive great ones. Compare, therefore, the character both of the\ngiver and the receiver, and weigh that which you give between the two,\ntaking care that what is given be neither too burdensome nor too trivial\nfor the one to give, nor yet such as the receiver will either treat with\ndisdain as too small, or think too great for him to deal with.\nXVI. Alexander, who was of unsound mind, and always full of magnificent\nideas, presented somebody with a city. When the man to whom he gave it\nhad reflected upon the scope of his own powers, he wished to avoid the\njealousy which so great a present would excite, saying that the gift did\nnot suit a man of his position. \"I do not ask,\" replied Alexander, \"what\nis becoming for you to receive, but what is becoming for me to give.\"\nThis seems a spirited and kingly speech, yet really it is a most foolish\none. Nothing is by itself a becoming gift for any one: all depends upon\nwho gives it, to whom he gives it, when, for what reason, where, and\nso forth, without which details it is impossible to argue about it.\nInflated creature! if it did not become him to receive this gift, it\ncould not become thee to give it. There should be a proportion between\nmen's characters and the offices which they fill; and as virtue in all\ncases should be our measure, he who gives too much acts as wrongly as he\nwho gives too little. Even granting that fortune has raised you so high,\nthat, where other men give cups, you give cities (which it would show a\ngreater mind in you not to take than to take and squander), still there\nmust be some of your friends who are not strong enough to put a city in\ntheir pockets.\nXVII. A certain cynic asked Antigonus for a talent. Antigonus answered\nthat this was too much for a cynic to ask for. After this rebuff he\nasked for a penny. Antigonus answered that this was too little for a\nking to give. \"This kind of hair-splitting\" (you say) \"is contemptible:\nhe found the means of giving neither. In the matter of the penny he\nthought of the king, in that of the talent he thought of the cynic,\nwhereas with respect to the cynic it would have been right to receive\nthe penny, with respect to the king it would have been right to give the\ntalent. Though there may be things which are too great for a cynic to\nreceive, yet nothing is so small, that it does not become a gracious\nking to bestow it.\" If you ask me, I applaud Antigonus; for it is not to\nbe endured that a man who despises money should ask for it. Your cynic\nhas publicly proclaimed his hatred of money, and assumed the character\nof one who despises it: let him act up to his professions. It is most\ninconsistent for him to earn money by glorifying his poverty. I wish\nto use Chrysippus's simile of the game of ball, in which the ball must\ncertainly fall by the fault either of the thrower or of the catcher; it\nonly holds its course when it passes between the hands of two persons\nwho each throw it and catch it suitably. It is necessary, however, for a\ngood player to send the ball in one way to a comrade at a long distance,\nand in another to one at a short distance. So it is with a benefit:\nunless it be suitable both for the giver and the receiver, it will\nneither leave the one nor reach the other as it ought. If we have to\ndo with a practised and skilled player, we shall throw the ball more\nrecklessly, for however it may come, that quick and agile hand will send\nit back again; if we are playing with an unskilled novice, we shall not\nthrow it so hard, but far more gently, guiding it straight into his very\nhands, and we shall run to meet it when it returns to us. This is just\nwhat we ought to do in conferring benefits; let us teach some men how to\ndo so, and be satisfied if they attempt it, if they have the courage and\nthe will to do so. For the most part, however, we make men ungrateful,\nand encourage them, to be so, as if our benefits were only great when\nwe cannot receive any gratitude for them; just as some spiteful\nball-players purposely put out their companion, of course to the ruin of\nthe game, which cannot be carried on without entire agreement Many men\nare of so depraved a nature that they had rather lose the presents which\nthey make than be thought to have received a return for them, because\nthey are proud, and like to lay people under obligations: yet how much\nbetter and more kindly would it be if they tried to enable the others\nalso to perform their parts, if they encouraged them in returning\ngratitude, put the best construction upon all their acts, received one\nwho wished to thank them just as cordially as if he came to repay what\nhe had received, and easily lent themselves to the belief that those\nwhom they have laid under an obligation wish to repay it. We blame\nusurers equally when they press harshly for payment, and when they delay\nand make difficulties about taking back the money which they have lent;\nin the same way, it is just as right that a benefit should be returned,\nas it is wrong to ask any one to return it. The best man is he who gives\nreadily, never asks for any return, and is delighted when the return\nis made, because, having really and truly forgotten what he gave, he\nreceives it as though it were a present.\nXVIII. Some men not only give, but even receive benefit haughtily, a\nmistake into which we ought not to fall: for now let us cross over to\nthe other side of the subject, and consider how men should behave when\nthey receive benefits. Every function which is performed by two persons\nmakes equal demands upon both: after you have considered what a father\nought to be, you will perceive that there remains an equal task, that\nof considering what a son ought to be: a husband has certain duties,\nbut those of a wife are no less important. Each of these give and take\nequally, and each require a similar rule of life, which, as Hecaton\nobserves, is hard to follow: indeed, it is difficult for us to attain\nto virtue, or even to anything that comes near virtue: for we ought not\nonly to act virtuously but to do so upon principle. We ought to follow\nthis guide throughout our lives, and to do everything great and small\naccording to its dictates: according as virtue prompts us we ought both\nto give and to receive. Now she will declare at the outset that we ought\nnot to receive benefits from every man. \"From whom, then, ought we to\nreceive them?\" To answer you briefly, I should say, from those to whom\nwe have given them. Let us consider whether we ought not to be even more\ncareful in choosing to whom we should owe than to whom we should give.\nFor even supposing that no unpleasantness should result (and very much\nalways does), still it is a great misery to be indebted to a man to whom\nyou do not wish to be under an obligation; whereas it is most delightful\nto receive a benefit from one whom you can love even after he has\nwronged you, and when the pleasure which you feel in his friendship is\njustified by the grounds on which it is based. Nothing is more wretched\nfor a modest and honourable man than to feel it to be his duty to love\none whom it does not please him to love. I must constantly remind you\nthat I do not speak of wise men, who take pleasure in everything that is\ntheir duty, who have their feelings under command, and are able to lay\ndown whatever law they please to themselves and keep it, but that I\nspeak of imperfect beings struggling to follow the right path, who often\nhave trouble in bending their passions to their will. I must therefore\nchoose the man from whom I will accept a benefit; indeed, I ought to be\nmore careful in the choice of my creditor for a benefit than for money;\nfor I have only to pay the latter as much as I received of him, land\nwhen I have paid it I am free from all obligation; but to the other I\nmust both repay more, and even when I have repaid his kindness we remain\nconnected, for when I have paid my debt I ought again to renew it,\nwhile our friendship endures unbroken. Thus, as I ought not to make an\nunworthy man my friend, so I ought not to admit an unworthy man into\nthat most holy bond of gratitude for benefits, from which friendship\narises. You reply, \"I cannot always say 'No': sometimes I must receive a\nbenefit even against my will. Suppose I were given something by a cruel\nand easily offended tyrant, who would take it as an affront if his\nbounty were slighted? am I not to accept it? Suppose it were offered by\na pirate, or a brigand, or a king of the temper of a pirate or brigand.\nWhat ought I to do? Such a man is not a worthy object for me to owe a\nbenefit to.\" When I say that you ought to choose, I except vis major\nand fear, which destroy all power of choice. If you are free, if it lies\nwith you to decide whether you will or not, then you will turn over in\nyour own mind whether you will take a gift from a man or not; but if\nyour position makes it impossible for you to choose, then be assured\nthat you do not receive a gift, you merely obey orders. No one incurs\nany obligation by receiving what it was not in his power to refuse; if\nyou want to know whether I wish to take it, arrange matters so that I\nhave the power of saying 'No.' \"Yet suppose he gave you your life.\" It\ndoes not matter what the gift was, unless it be given and received with\ngood will: you are not my preserver because you have saved my life.\nPoison sometimes acts as a medicine, yet it is not on that account\nregarded as wholesome. Some things benefit us but put us under no\nobligation: for instance a man who intended to kill a tyrant, cut with\nhis sword a tumour from which he suffered: yet the tyrant did not show\nhim gratitude because by wounding him he had healed a disease which\nsurgeons had feared to meddle with.\nXIX. You see that the actual thing itself is not of much importance,\nbecause it is not regarded as a benefit at all, if you do good when you\nintended to do evil; in such a case the benefit is done by chance, the\nman did harm. I have seen a lion in the amphitheatre, who recognized one\nof the men who fought with wild beasts, who once had been his keeper,\nand protected him against the attacks of the other animals. Are we,\nthen, to say that this assistance of the brute was a benefit? By no\nmeans, because it did not intend to do it, and did not do it with kindly\nintentions. You may class the lion and your tyrant together: each of\nthem saved a man's life, yet neither conferred a benefit. Because it is\nnot a benefit to be forced to receive one, neither is it a benefit to be\nunder an obligation to a man to whom we do not wish to be indebted. You\nmust first give me personal freedom of decision, and then your benefit.\nXX. The question has been raised, whether Marcus Brutus ought to have\nreceived his life from the hands of Julius Caesar, who, he had decided,\nought to be put to death.\nAs to the grounds upon which he put him to death, I shall discuss them\nelsewhere; for to my mind, though he was in other respects a great man,\nin this he seems to have been entirely wrong, and not to have followed\nthe maxims of the Stoic philosophy. He must either have feared the name\nof \"King,\" although a state thrives best under a good king, or he must\nhave hoped that liberty could exist in a state where some had so much to\ngain by reigning, and others had so much to gain by becoming slaves. Or,\nagain, he must have supposed that it would be possible to restore the\nancient constitution after all the ancient manners had been lost, and\nthat citizens could continue to possess equal rights, or laws remain\ninviolate, in a state in which he had seen so many thousands of men\nfighting to decide, not whether they should be slaves or free, but which\nmaster they should serve. How forgetful he seems to have been, both of\nhuman nature and of the history of his own country, in supposing that\nwhen one despot was destroyed another of the same temper would not take\nhis place, though, after so many kings had perished by lightning and the\nsword, a Tarquin was found to reign! Yet Brutus did right in receiving\nhis life from Caesar, though he was not bound thereby to regard Caesar\nas his father, since it was by a wrong that Caesar had come to be in a\nposition to bestow this benefit. A man does not save your life who does\nnot kill you; nor does he confer a benefit, but merely gives you your\ndischarge. [The 'discharge' alluded to is that which was granted to\nthe beaten one of a pair of gladiators, when their duel was not to the\ndeath.]\nXXI. It seems to offer more opportunity for debate to consider what a\ncaptive ought to do, if a man of abominable vices offers him the price\nof his ransom? Shall I permit myself to be saved by a wretch? When safe,\nwhat recompense can I make to him? Am I to live with an infamous person?\nYet, am I not to live with my preserver? I will tell you my opinion. I\nwould accept money, even from such a person, if it were to save my life;\nyet I would only accept it as a loan, not as a benefit. I would repay\nhim the money, and if I were ever able to preserve him from danger I\nwould do so. As for friendship, which can only exist between equals, I\nwould not condescend to be such a man's friend; nor would I regard him\nas my preserver, but merely as a money-lender, to whom I am only bound\nto repay what I borrowed from him.\nA man may be a worthy person for me to receive a benefit from, but it\nwill hurt him to give it. For this reason I will not receive it, because\nhe is ready to help me to his own prejudice, or even danger. Suppose\nthat he is willing to plead for me in court, but by so doing will make\nthe king his enemy. I should be his enemy, if, when he is willing to\nrisk himself for me, if I were not to risk myself without him, which\nmoreover is easier for me to do.\nAs an instance of this, Hecaton calls the case of Arcesilaus silly, and\nnot to the purpose. Arcesilaus, he says, refused to receive a large sum\nof money which was offered to him by a son, lest the son should offend\nhis penurious father. What did he do deserving of praise, in not\nreceiving stolen goods, in choosing not to receive them, instead of\nreturning them? What proof of self-restraint is there in refusing to\nreceive another man's property. If you want an instance of magnanimity,\ntake the case of Julius Graecinus, whom Caius Caesar put to death merely\non the ground that he was a better man than it suited a tyrant for\nanyone to be. This man, when he was receiving subscriptions from many of\nhis friends to cover his expenses in exhibiting public games, would not\nreceive a large sum which was sent him by Fabius Persicus; and when he\nwas blamed for rejecting it by those who think more of what is given\nthan of who gives it, he answered, \"Am I to accept a present from a man\nwhen I would not accept his offer to drink a glass of wine with him?\"\nWhen a consular named Rebilius, a man of equally bad character, sent\na yet larger sum to Graecinus, and pressed him to receive it. \"I must\nbeg,\" answered he, \"that you will excuse me. I did not take money from\nPersicus either.\" Ought we to call this receiving presents, or rather\ntaking one's pick of the senate?\nXXII. When we have decided to accept, let us accept with cheerfulness,\nshowing pleasure, and letting the giver see it, so that he may at once\nreceive some return for his goodness: for as it is a good reason for\nrejoicing to see our friend happy, it is a better one to have made\nhim so. Let us, therefore, show how acceptable a gift is by loudly\nexpressing our gratitude for it; and let us do so, not only in the\nhearing of the giver, but everywhere. He who receives a benefit with\ngratitude, repays the first instalment of it.\nXXIII. There are some, who only like to receive benefits privately: they\ndislike having any witnesses and confidants. Such men, we may believe,\nhave no good intentions. As a giver is justified in dwelling upon those\nqualities of his gift which will please the receiver, so a man, when he\nreceives, should do so publicly; you should not take from a man what\nyou are ashamed to owe him. Some return thanks to one stealthily, in a\ncorner, in a whisper. This is not modesty, but a kind of denying of the\ndebt: it is the part of an ungrateful man not to express his gratitude\nbefore witnesses. Some object to any accounts being kept between them\nand their benefactors, and wish no brokers to be employed or witnesses\nto be called, but merely to give their own signature to a receipt. Those\nmen do the like, who take care to let as few persons as possible know\nof the benefits which they have received. They fear to receive them in\npublic, in order that their success may be attributed rather to their\nown talents than to the help of others: they are very seldom to be\nfound in attendance upon those to whom they owe their lives and their\nfortunes, and thus, while avoiding the imputation of servility, they\nincur that of ingratitude.\nXXIV. Some men speak in the most offensive terms of those to whom they\nowe most. There are men whom it is safer to affront than to serve,\nfor their dislike leads them to assume the airs of persons who are not\nindebted to us: although nothing more is expected of them than that they\nshould remember what they owe us, refreshing their memory from time to\ntime, because no one can be grateful who forgets a kindness, and he\nwho remembers it, by so doing proves his gratitude. We ought neither to\nreceive benefits with a fastidious air, nor yet with a slavish humility:\nfor if a man does not care for a benefit when it is freshly bestowed--a\ntime at which all presents please us most--what will he do when its\nfirst charms have gone off? Others receive with an air of disdain, as\nmuch as to say. \"I do not want it; but as you wish it so very much, I\nwill allow you to give it to me.\" Others take benefits languidly, and\nleave the giver in doubt as to whether they know that they have received\nthem; others barely open their lips in thanks, and would be less\noffensive if they said nothing. One ought to proportion one's thanks\nto the importance of the benefit received, and to use the phrases, \"You\nhave laid more of us than you think under an obligation,\" for everyone\nlikes to find his good actions extend further than he expected. \"You do\nnot know what it is that you have done for me; but you ought to know\nhow much more important it is than you imagine.\" It is in itself\nan expression of gratitude to speak of one's self as overwhelmed by\nkindness; or \"I shall never be able to thank you sufficiently; but, at\nany rate, I will never cease to express everywhere my inability to thank\nyou.\"\nXXV. By nothing did Furnius gain greater credit with Augustus, and make\nit easy for him to obtain anything else for which he might ask, than\nby merely saying, when at his request Augustus pardoned his father for\nhaving taken Antonius's side, \"One wrong alone I have received at your\nhands, Caesar; you have forced me to live and to die owing you a greater\ndebt of gratitude than I can ever repay.\" What can prove gratitude\nso well as that a man should never be satisfied, should never even\nentertain the hope of making any adequate return for what he has\nreceived? By these and similar expressions we must try not to conceal\nour gratitude, but to display it as clearly as possible. No words need\nbe used; if we only feel as we ought, our thankfulness will be shown in\nour countenances. He who intends to be grateful, let him think how he\nshall repay a kindness while he is receiving it. Chrysippus says that\nsuch a man must watch for his opportunity, and spring forward whenever\nit offers, like one who has been entered for a race, and who stands at\nthe starting-point waiting for the barriers to be thrown open; and even\nthen he must use great exertions and great swiftness to catch the other,\nwho has a start of him.\nXXVI. We must now consider what is the main cause of ingratitude. It is\ncaused by excessive self-esteem, by that fault innate in all mortals,\nof taking a partial view of ourselves and our own acts, by greed, or by\njealousy.\nLet us begin with the first of these. Every one is prejudiced in his own\nfavour, from which it follows that he believes himself to have earned\nall that he receives, regards it as payment for his services, and does\nnot think that he has been appraised at a valuation sufficiently near\nhis own. \"He has given me this,\" says he, \"but how late, after how much\ntoil? how much more might I have earned if I had attached myself to So\nand so, or to So and so? I did not expect this; I have been treated like\none of the herd; did he really think that I only deserved so little?\nwhy, it would have been less insulting to have passed me over\naltogether.\"\nXXVII. The augur Cnaeus Lentulus, who, before his freedmen reduced him\nto poverty, was one of the richest of men, who saw himself in possession\nof a fortune of four hundred millions--I say advisedly, \"saw,\" for he\nnever did more than see it--was as barren and contemptible in intellect\nas he was in spirit. Though very avaricious, yet he was so poor a\nspeaker that he found it easier to give men coins than words. This man,\nwho owed all his prosperity to the late Emperor Augustus, to whom he had\nbrought only poverty, encumbered with a noble name, when he had risen to\nbe the chief man in Rome, both in wealth and influence, used sometimes\nto complain that Augustus had interrupted his legal studies, observing\nthat he had not received anything like what he had lost by giving up the\nstudy of eloquence. Yet the truth was that Augustus, besides loading him\nwith other gifts, had set him free from the necessity of making himself\nridiculous by labouring at a profession in which he never could succeed.\nGreed does not permit any one to be grateful; for what is given is never\nequal to its base desires, and the more we receive the more we\ncovet, for avarice is much more eager when it has to deal with great\naccumulations of wealth, just as the power of a flame is enormously\ngreater in proportion to the size of the conflagration from which it\nsprings. Ambition in like manner suffers no man to rest satisfied with\nthat measure of public honours, to gain which was once the limit of his\nwildest hope; no one is thankful for becoming tribune, but grumbles at\nnot being at once promoted to the post of praetor; nor is he grateful\nfor this if the consulship does not follow; and even this does not\nsatisfy him if he be consul but once. His greed ever stretches itself\nout further, and he does not understand the greatness of his success\nbecause he always looks forward to the point at which he aims, and never\nback towards that from which he started.\nXXVIII. A more violent and distressing vice than any of these is\njealousy which disturbs us by suggesting comparisons. \"He gave me this,\nbut he gave more to that man, and he gave it to him before me;\" after\nwhich he sympathises with no one, but pushes his own claims to the\nprejudice of every one else. How much more straightforward and modest\nis it to make the most of what we have received, knowing that no man is\nvalued so highly by any one else as by his own, self! \"I ought to have\nreceived more, but it was not easy for him to give more; he was obliged\nto distribute his liberality among many persons. This is only the\nbeginning; let me be contented, and by my gratitude encourage him to\nshow me more favour; he has not done as much as he ought, but he will\ndo so the more frequently; he certainly preferred that man to me, but he\nhas preferred me before many others; that man is not my equal either in\nvirtue or in services, but he has some charm of his own: by complaining\nI shall not make myself deserve to receive more, but shall become\nunworthy of what I have received. More has been given to those most\nvillainous men than has been given to me; well, what is that to the\npurpose? how seldom does Fortune show judgment in her choice? We\ncomplain every day of the success of bad men; very often the hail passes\nover the estates of the greatest villains and strikes down the crops of\nthe best of men; every man has to take his chance, in friendship as well\nas in everything else.\" There is no benefit so great that spitefulness\ncan pick no holes in it, none so paltry that it cannot be made more of\nby friendly interpretation. We shall never want a subject for complaint\nif we look at benefits on their wrong side.\nXXIX. See how unjustly the gifts of heaven are valued even by some who\nprofess themselves philosophers, who complain that we are not as big\nas elephants, as swift as stags, as light as birds, as strong as bulls;\nthat the skins of seals are stronger, of hinds prettier, of bears\nthicker, of beavers softer than ours; that dogs excel us in delicacy of\nscent, eagles in keenness of sight, crows in length of days, and many\nbeasts in ease of swimming. And although nature itself does not allow\nsome qualities, as for example strength and swiftness, to be combined\nin the same person, yet they call it a monstrous thing that men are not\ncompounded of different and inconsistent good qualities, and call the\ngods neglectful of us because we have not been given health which even\nour vices cannot destroy, or knowledge of the future. They scarcely\nrefrain from rising to such a pitch of impudence as to hate nature\nbecause we are below the gods, and not on an equality with them.\nHow much better is it to turn to the contemplation of so many great\nblessings, and to be thankful that the gods have been pleased to give us\na place second only to themselves in this most beautiful abode, and that\nthey have appointed us to be the lords of the earth! Can any one compare\nus with the animals over whom we rule? Nothing has been denied us except\nwhat could not have been granted. In like manner, thou that takest an\nunfair view of the lot of mankind, think what blessings our Father has\nbestowed upon us, how far more powerful animals than ourselves we have\nbroken to harness, how we catch those which are far swifter, how\nnothing that has life is placed beyond the reach of our weapons! We have\nreceived so many excellencies, so many crafts, above all our mind, which\ncan pierce at once whatever it is directed against, which is swifter\nthan the stars in their courses, for it arrives before them at the place\nwhich they will reach after many ages; and besides this, so many fruits\nof the earth, so much treasure, such masses of various things piled one\nupon another. You may go through the whole order of nature, and since\nyou find no entire creature which you would prefer to be, you may choose\nfrom each, the special qualities which you would like to be given to\nyourself; then, if you rightly appreciate the partiality of nature for\nyou, you cannot but confess yourself to be her spoiled child. So it is;\nthe immortal gods have unto this day always held us most dear, and\nhave bestowed upon us the greatest possible honour, a place nearest to\nthemselves. We have indeed received great things, yet not too great.\nXXX. I have thought it necessary, my friend Liberalis, to state these\nfacts, both because when speaking of small benefits one ought to make\nsome mention of the greatest, and because also this shameless and\nhateful vice (of ingratitude), starting with these, transfers itself\nfrom them to all the rest. If a man scorn these, the greatest of all\nbenefits, to whom will he feel gratitude, what gift will he regard as\nvaluable or deserving to be returned: to whom will he be grateful for\nhis safety or his life, if he denies that he has received from the gods\nthat existence which he begs from them daily? He, therefore, who teaches\nmen to be grateful, pleads the cause not only of men, but even of the\ngods, for though they, being placed above all desires, cannot be in want\nof anything, yet we can nevertheless offer them our gratitude.\nNo one is justified in seeking an excuse for ingratitude in his own\nweakness or poverty, or in saying, \"What am I to do, and how? When can I\nrepay my debt to my superiors the lords of heaven and earth?\" Avaricious\nas you are, it is easy for you to give them thanks, without expense;\nlazy though you be, you can do it without labour. At the same instant at\nwhich you received your debt towards them, if you wish to repay it,\nyou have done as much as any one can do, for he returns a benefit who\nreceives it with good will.\nXXXI. This paradox of the Stoic philosophy, that he returns a benefit\nwho receives it with good will, is, in my opinion, either far from\nadmirable, or else it is incredible. For if we look at everything merely\nfrom the point of view of our intentions, every man has done as much\nas he chose to do; and since filial piety, good faith, justice, and in\nshort every virtue is complete within itself, a man may be grateful in\nintention even though he may not be able to lift a hand to prove his\ngratitude. Whenever a man obtains what he aimed at, he receives the\nfruit of his labour. When a man bestows a benefit, at what does he aim?\nclearly to be of service and afford pleasure to him upon whom he bestows\nit. If he does what he wishes, if his purpose reaches me and fills us\neach with joy, he has gained his object. He does not wish anything to be\ngiven to him in return, or else it becomes an exchange of commodities,\nnot a bestowal of benefits. A man steers well who reaches the port for\nwhich he started: a dart hurled by a steady hand performs its duty if it\nhits the mark; one who bestows a benefit wishes it to be received with\ngratitude; he gets what he wanted if it be well received. \"But,\" you\nsay, \"he hoped for some profit also.\" Then it was not a benefit, the\nproperty of which is to think nothing of any repayment. I receive what\nwas given me in the same spirit in which it was given: then I have\nrepaid it. If this be not true, then this best of deeds has this worst\nof conditions attached to it, that it depends entirely upon fortune\nwhether I am grateful or not, for if my fortune is adverse I can make no\nrepayment. The intention is enough. What then? am I not to do whatever\nI may be able to repay it, and ought I not ever to be on the watch for\nan opportunity of filling the bosom [Footnote: Sinus, the fold of the\ntoga over the breast, used as a pocket by the Romans. The great French\nactor Talma, when dressed for the first time in correct classical\ncostume, indignantly asked where he was to put his snuff-box.] of him\nfrom whom I have received any kindness? True; but a benefit is in\nan evil plight if we cannot be grateful for it even when we are\nempty-handed.\nXXXII. \"A man,\" it is argued, \"who has received a benefit, however\ngratefully he may have received it, has not yet accomplished all his\nduty, for there remains the part of repayment; just as in playing at\nball it is something to catch the ball cleverly and carefully, but a man\nis not called a good player unless he can handily and quickly send\nback the ball which he has caught.\" This analogy is imperfect; and why?\nBecause to do this creditably depends upon the movement and activity of\nthe body, and not upon the mind: and an act of which we judge entirely\nby the eye, ought to be all clearly displayed. But if a man caught\nthe ball as he ought to do, I should not call him a bad player for not\nreturning it, if his delay in returning it was not caused by his own\nfault. \"Yet,\" say you, \"although the player is not wanting in skill,\nbecause he did one part of his duty, and was able to do the other part,\nyet in such a case the game is imperfect, for its perfection lies in\nsending the ball backwards and forwards.\" I am unwilling to expose this\nfallacy further; let us think that it is the game, not the player that\nis imperfect: so likewise in the subject which we are discussing, the\nthing which is given lacks something, because another equal thing ought\nto be returned for it, but the mind of the giver lacks nothing, because\nit has found another mind equal to itself, and as far as intentions go,\nhas effected what it wished.\nXXXIII. A man bestows a benefit upon me: I receive it just as he wished\nit to be received: then he gets at once what he wanted, and the only\nthing which he wanted, and therefore I have proved myself grateful.\nAfter this it remains for me to enjoy my own resources, with the\naddition of an advantage conferred upon me by one whom I have obliged;\nthis advantage is not the remainder of an imperfect service, but an\naddition to a perfected service. [Footnote: Nothing is wanted to make\na benefit, conferred from good motives, perfect: if it is returned, the\ngratitude is to be counted as net profit.] For example, Phidias makes a\nstatue. Now the product of an art is one thing, and that of a trade is\nanother. It is the business of the art to make the thing which he wished\nto make, and that of the trade to make it with a profit. Phidias has\ncompleted his work, even though he does not sell it. The product,\ntherefore, of his work is threefold: there is the consciousness of\nhaving made it, which he receives when his work is completed; there is\nthe fame which he receives; and thirdly, the advantage which he obtains\nby it, in influence, or by selling it, or otherwise. In like manner the\nfirst fruit of a benefit is the consciousness of it, which we feel when\nwe have bestowed it upon the person whom we chose; secondly and thirdly\nthere is the credit which we gain by doing so, and there are those\nthings which we may receive in exchange for it. So when a benefit has\nbeen graciously received, the giver has already received gratitude, but\nhas not yet received recompense for it: that which we owe in return is\ntherefore something apart from the benefit itself, for we have paid for\nthe benefit itself when we accept it in a grateful spirit.\nXXXIV. \"What,\" say you, \"can a man repay a benefit, though he does\nnothing?\" He has taken the first step, he has offered you a good thing\nwith good feeling, and, which is the characteristic of friendship, has\nplaced you both on the same footing. In the next place, a benefit is not\nrepaid in the same manner as a loan: you have no reason for expecting\nme to offer you any payment; the account between us depends upon the\nfeelings alone. What I say will not appear difficult, although it may\nnot at first accord with your ideas, if you will do me the favour to\nremember that there are more things than there are words to express\nthem. There is an enormous mass of things without names, which we do not\nspeak of under distinctive names of their own, but by the names of other\nthings transferred to them. We speak of our own foot, of the foot of a\ncouch, of a sail, or of a poem; we apply the word 'dog' to a hound, a\nfish, and a star. Because we have not enough words to assign a separate\nname to each thing, we borrow a name whenever we want one. Bravery is\nthe virtue which rightly despises danger, or the science of repelling,\nsustaining, or inviting dangers: yet we call a brave man a gladiator,\nand we use the same word for a good-for-nothing slave, who is led by\nrashness to defy death. Economy is the science of avoiding unnecessary\nexpenditure, or the art of using one's income with moderation: yet we\ncall a man of mean and narrow mind, most economical, although there is\nan immeasurable distance between moderation and meanness. These things\nare naturally distinct, yet the poverty of our language compels us to\ncall both these men economical, just as he who views slight accidents\nwith rational contempt, and he who without reason runs into danger are\nalike called brave. Thus a benefit is both a beneficent action, and also\nis that which is bestowed by that action, such as money, a house, an\noffice in the state: there is but one name for them both, though their\nforce and power are widely different.\nXXXV. Wherefore, give me your attention, and you will soon perceive that\nI say nothing to which you can object. That benefit which consists of\nthe action is repaid when we receive it graciously; that other, which\nconsists of something material, we have not then repaid, but we hope to\ndo so. The debt of goodwill has been discharged by a return of goodwill;\nthe material debt demands a material return. Thus, although we may\ndeclare that he who has received a benefit with good-will has returned\nthe favour, yet we counsel him to return to the giver something of the\nsame kind as that which he has received. Some part of what we have said\ndeparts from the conventional line of thought, and then rejoins it by\nanother path. We declare that a wise man cannot receive an injury; yet,\nif a man hits him with his fist, that man will be found guilty of doing\nhim an injury. We declare that a fool can possess nothing; yet if a man\nstole anything from a fool, we should find that man guilty of theft. We\ndeclare that all men are mad, yet we do not dose all men with hellebore;\nbut we put into the hands of these very persons, whom we call madmen,\nboth the right of voting and of pronouncing judgment. Similarly, we say\nthat a man who has received a benefit with good-will has returned the\nfavour, yet we leave him in debt nevertheless--bound to repay it even\nthough he has repaid it. This is not to disown benefits, but is an\nencouragement to us neither to fear to receive benefits, nor to faint\nunder the too great burden of them. \"Good things have been given to me;\nI have been preserved from starving; I have been saved from the misery\nof abject poverty; my life, and what is dearer than life, my liberty,\nhas been preserved. How shall I be able to repay these favours? When\nwill the day come upon which I can prove my gratitude to him?\" When a\nman speaks thus, the day has already come. Receive a benefit, embrace\nit, rejoice, not that you have received it, but that you have to owe it\nand return it; then you will never be in peril of the great sin of being\nrendered ungrateful by mischance. I will not enumerate any difficulties\nto you, lest you should despair, and faint at the prospect of a long and\nlaborious servitude. I do not refer you to the future; do it with what\nmeans you have at hand. You never will be grateful unless you are so\nstraightway. What, then, will you do? You need not take up arms, yet\nperhaps you may have to do so; you need not cross the seas, yet it may\nbe that you will pay your debt, even when the wind threatens to blow a\ngale. Do you wish to return the benefit? Then receive it graciously;\nyou have then returned the favour--not, indeed, so that you can think\nyourself to have repaid it, but so that you can owe it with a quieter\nconscience.\nBOOK III.\nI.\nNot to return gratitude for benefits, my AEbutius Liberalis, is\nboth base in itself, and is thought base by all men; wherefore even\nungrateful men complain of ingratitude, and yet what all condemn is at\nthe same time rooted in all; and so far do men sometimes run into the\nother extreme that some of them become our bitterest enemies, not merely\nafter receiving benefits from us, but because they have received them.\nI cannot deny that some do this out of sheer badness of nature; but\nmore do so because lapse of time destroys their remembrance, for time\ngradually effaces what they felt vividly at the moment. I remember\nhaving had an argument with you about this class of persons, whom you\nwished to call forgetful rather than ungrateful, as if that which caused\na man to be ungrateful was any excuse for his being so, or as if the\nfact of this happening to a man prevented his being ungrateful, when we\nknow that it only happens to ungrateful men. There are many classes of\nthe ungrateful, as there are of thieves or of homicides, who all have\nthe same fault, though there is a great variety in its various forms.\nThe man is ungrateful who denies that he has received a benefit; who\npretends that he has not received it; who does not return it. The most\nungrateful man of all is he who forgets it. The others, though they do\nnot repay it, yet feel their debt, and possess some traces of worth,\nthough obstructed by their bad conscience. They may by some means and at\nsome time be brought to show their gratitude, if, for instance, they\nbe pricked by shame, if they conceive some noble ambition such as\noccasionally rises even in the breasts of the wicked, if some easy\nopportunity of doing so offers; but the man from whom all recollection\nof the benefit has passed away can never become grateful. Which of the\ntwo do you call the worse--he who is ungrateful for kindness, or he who\ndoes not even remember it? The eyes which fear to look at the light are\ndiseased, but those which cannot see it are blind. It is filial impiety\nnot to love one's parents, but not to recognise them is madness.\nII. Who is so ungrateful as he who has so completely laid aside and cast\naway that which ought to be in the forefront of his mind and ever\nbefore him, that he knows it not? It is clear that if forgetfulness of\na benefit steals over a man, he cannot have often thought about repaying\nit.\nIn short, repayment requires gratitude, time, opportunity, and the help\nof fortune; whereas, he who remembers a benefit is grateful for it, and\nthat too without expenditure. Since gratitude demands neither labour,\nwealth, nor good fortune, he who fails to render it has no excuse behind\nwhich to shelter himself; for he who places a benefit so far away that\nit is out of his sight, never could have meant to be grateful for it.\nJust as those tools which are kept in use, and are daily touched by the\nhand, are never in danger of growing rusty, while those which are not\nbrought before our eyes, and lie as if superfluous, not being required\nfor common use, collect dirt by the mere lapse of time, so likewise that\nwhich our thoughts frequently turn over and renew never passes from our\nmemory, which only loses those things to which it seldom directs its\neyes.\nIII. Besides this, there are other causes which at times erase the\ngreatest services from our minds. The first and most powerful of these\nis that, being always intent upon new objects of desire, we think, not\nof what we have, but of what we are striving to obtain. Those whose mind\nis fixed entirely upon what they hope to gain, regard with contempt all\nthat is their own already. It follows that since men's eagerness for\nsomething new makes them undervalue whatever they have received, they\ndo not esteem those from whom they have received it. As long as we are\nsatisfied with the position we have gained, we love our benefactor, we\nlook up to him, and declare that we owe our position entirely to him;\nthen we begin to entertain other aspirations, and hurry forward to\nattain them after the manner of human beings, who when they have gained\nmuch always covet more; straightway all that we used to regard as\nbenefits slip from our memory, and we no longer consider the advantages\nwhich we enjoy over others, but only the insolent prosperity of those\nwho have outstripped us. Now no one can at the same time be both jealous\nand grateful, because those who are jealous are querulous and sad, while\nthe grateful are joyous. In the next place, since none of us think of\nany time but the present, and but few turn back their thoughts to the\npast, it results that we forget our teachers, and all the benefits\nwhich we have obtained from them, because we have altogether left\nour childhood behind us: thus, all that was done for us in our youth\nperishes unremembered, because our youth itself is never reviewed. What\nhas been is regarded by every one, not only as past, but as gone; and\nfor the same reason, our memory is weak for what is about to happen in\nthe future.\nIV. Here I must do Epicurus the justice to say that he constantly\ncomplains of our ingratitude for past benefits, because we cannot bring\nback again, or count among our present pleasures, those good things\nwhich we have received long ago, although no pleasures can be more\nundeniable than those which cannot be taken from us. Present good is not\nyet altogether complete, some mischance may interrupt it; the future is\nin suspense, and uncertain; but what is past is laid up in safety. How\ncan any man feel gratitude for benefits, if he skips through his\nwhole life entirely engrossed with the present and the future? It is\nremembrance that mates men grateful; and the more men hope, the less\nthey remember.\nV. In the same way, my Liberalis, as some things remain in our memory as\nsoon as they are learned, while to know others it is not enough to have\nlearned them, for our knowledge slips away from us unless it be kept\nup--I allude to geometry and astronomy, and such other sciences as are\nHard to remember because of their intricacy--so the greatness of some\nbenefits prevents their being forgotten, while others, individually\nless, though many more in number, and bestowed at different times, pass\nfrom our minds, because, as I have stated above, we do not constantly\nthink about them, and do not willingly recognize how much we owe to each\nof our benefactors. Listen to the words of those who ask for favours.\nThere is not one of them who does not declare that his remembrance will\nbe eternal, who does not vow himself your devoted servant and slave, or\nfind, if he can, some even greater expression of humility with which to\npledge himself. After a brief space of time these same men avoid\ntheir former expressions, thinking them abject, and scarcely befitting\nfree-born men; afterwards they arrive at the same point to which, as\nI suppose, the worst and most ungrateful of men come--that is, they\nforget. So little does forgetfulness excuse ingratitude, that even the\nremembrance of a benefit may leave us ungrateful.\nVI. The question has been raised, whether this most odious vice ought to\ngo unpunished; and whether the law commonly made use of in the schools,\nby which we can proceed against a man for ingratitude, ought to be\nadopted by the State also, since all men agree that it is just. \"Why\nnot?\" you may say, \"seeing that even cities cast in each other's teeth\nthe services which they have performed to one another, and demand from\nthe children some return for benefits conferred upon their fathers?\" On\nthe other hand, our ancestors, who were most admirable men, made demands\nupon their enemies alone, and both gave and lost their benefits with\nmagnanimity. With the exception of Macedonia, no nation has ever\nestablished an action at law for ingratitude. And this is a strong\nargument against its being established, because all agree in blaming\ncrime; and homicide, poisoning, parricide, and sacrilege are visited\nwith different penalties in different countries, but everywhere with\nsome penalty; whereas this most common vice is nowhere punished, though\nit is everywhere blamed. We do not acquit it; but as it would be most\ndifficult to reckon accurately the penalty for so varying a matter, we\ncondemn it only to be hated, and place it upon the list of those crimes\nwhich we refer for judgment to the gods.\nVII. Many arguments occur to me which prove that this vice ought not\nto come under the action of the law. First of all, the best part of a\nbenefit is lost if the benefit can be sued for at law, as in the case of\na loan, or of letting and hiring. Indeed, the finest part of a benefit\nis that we have given it without considering whether we shall lose it or\nnot, that we have left all this to the free choice of him who receives\nit: if I call him before a judge, it begins to be not a benefit, but a\nloan. Next, though it is a most honourable thing to show gratitude, it\nceases to be honourable if it be forced, for in that case no one will\npraise a grateful man any more than he praises him who restores the\nmoney which was deposited in his keeping, or who pays what he borrowed\nwithout the intervention of a judge. We should therefore spoil the two\nfinest things in human life,--a grateful man and a beneficent man; for\nwhat is there admirable in one who does not give but merely lends a\nbenefit, or in one who repays it, not because he wishes, but because he\nis forced to do so? There is no credit in being grateful, unless it\nis safe to be ungrateful. Besides this, all the courts would hardly be\nenough for the action of this one law. Who would not plead under it? Who\nwould not be pleaded against? for every one exalts his own merits,\nevery one magnifies even the smallest matters which he has bestowed upon\nanother. Besides this, those things which form the subject of a judicial\ninquiry can be distinctly defined, and cannot afford unlimited licence\nto the judge; wherefore a good cause is in a better position if it\nbefore a judge than before an arbitrator, because the words of the law\ntie down a judge and define certain limits beyond which he may not pass,\nwhereas the conscience of an arbitrator is free and not fettered by\nany rules, so that he can either give or take away, and can arrange his\ndecision, not according to the precepts of law and justice, but just\nas his own kindly feeling or compassion may prompt him. An action for\ningratitude would not bind a judge, but would place him in the position\nof an autocrat. It cannot be known what or how great a benefit is; all\nthat would be really important would be, how indulgently the judge might\ninterpret it. No law defines an ungrateful person, often, indeed, one\nwho repays what he has received is ungrateful, and one who has not\nreturned it is grateful. Even an unpractised judge can give his vote\nupon some matters; for instance, when the thing to be determined is\nwhether something has or has not been done, when a dispute is terminated\nby the parties giving written bonds, or when the casting up of accounts\ndecides between the disputants. When, however, motives have to be\nguessed at, when matters upon which wisdom alone can decide, are brought\ninto court, they cannot be tried by a judge taken at random from the\nlist of \"select judges,\" [Footnote: See Smith's \"Dict. of Antiq.,\" s.\nv] whom property and the inheritance of an equestrian fortune [Footnote:\n400,000 sesterces] has placed upon the roll.\nVIII. Ingratitude, therefore, is not only matter unfit to be brought\ninto court, but no judge could be found fit to try it; and this you\nwill not be surprised at, if you examine the difficulties of any one who\nshould attempt to prosecute a man upon such a charge. One man may\nhave given a large sum of money, but he is rich and would not feel it;\nanother may have given it at the cost of his entire inheritance. The\nsum given is the same in each case, but the benefit conferred is not the\nsame. Add another instance: suppose that to redeem a debtor from slavery\none man paid money from his own private means, while another man paid\nthe same sum, but had to borrow it or beg for it, and allow himself to\nbe laid under a great obligation to some one; would you rank the man who\nso easily bestowed his benefit on an equality with him who was obliged\nto receive a benefit himself before he could bestow it? Some benefits\nare great, not because of their amount, but because of the time at which\nthey are bestowed; it is a benefit to give an estate whose fertility\ncan bring down the price of corn, and it is a benefit to give a loaf of\nbread in time of famine; it is a benefit to give provinces through which\nflow vast navigable rivers, and it is a benefit, when men are parched\nwith thirst, and can scarcely draw breath through their dry throats,\nto show them a spring of water. Who will compare these cases with one\nanother, or weigh one against the other? It is hard to give a decision\nwhen it is not the thing given, but its meaning, which has to be\nconsidered; though what is given is the same, yet if it be given\nunder different circumstances it has a different value. A man may have\nbestowed a benefit upon me, but unwillingly; he may have complained of\nhaving given it; he may have looked at me with greater haughtiness than\nhe was wont to do; he may have been so slow in giving it, that he would\nhave done me a greater service if he had promptly refused it. How could\na judge estimate the value of these things, when words, hesitation, or\nlooks can destroy all their claim to gratitude?\nIX. What, again, could he do, seeing that some things are called\nbenefits because they are unduly coveted, whilst others are not benefits\nat all, according to this common valuation, yet are of even greater\nvalue, though not so showy? You call it a benefit to cause a man to be\nadopted as a member of a powerful city, to get him enrolled among the\nknights, or to defend one who is being tried for his life: what do you\nsay of him who gives useful advice? of him who holds you back when you\nwould rush into crime? of him who strikes the sword from the hands of\nthe suicide? of him who by his power of consolation brings back to the\nduties of life one who was plunged in grief, and eager to follow those\nwhom he had lost? of him who sits at the bedside of the sick man, and\nwho, when health and recovery depend upon seizing the right moment,\nadministers food in due season, stimulates the failing veins with wine,\nor calls in the physician to the dying man? Who can estimate the value\nof such services as these? who can bid us weigh dissimilar benefits one\nwith another? \"I gave you a house,\" says one. Yes, but I forewarned\nyou that your own house would come down upon your head. \"I gave you an\nestate,\" says he. True, but I gave a plank to you when shipwrecked. \"I\nfought for you and received wounds for you,\" says another. But I saved\nyour life by keeping silence. Since a benefit is both given and returned\ndifferently by different people, it is hard to make them balance.\nX. Besides this, no day is appointed for repayment of a benefit, as\nthere is for borrowed money; consequently he who has not yet repaid a\nbenefit may do so hereafter: for tell me, pray, within what time a man\nis to be declared ungrateful? The greatest benefits cannot be proved by\nevidence; they often lurk in the silent consciousness of two men\nonly; are we to introduce the rule of not bestowing benefits without\nwitnesses? Next, what punishment are we to appoint for the ungrateful?\nis there to be one only for all, though the benefits which they have\nreceived are different? or should the punishment be varying, greater\nor less according to the benefit which each has received? Are our\nvaluations to be restricted to pecuniary fines? what are we to do,\nseeing that in some cases the benefit conferred is life, and things\ndearer than life? What punishment is to be assigned to ingratitude for\nthese? One less than the benefit? That would be unjust. One equal to it;\ndeath? What could be more inhuman than to cause benefits to result in\ncruelty?\nXI. It may be argued, \"Parents have certain privileges: these are\nregarded as exempt from the action of ordinary rules, and so also ought\nto be the case with other beneficent persons.\" Nay; mankind has\nassigned a peculiar sanctity to the position of parents, because it\nwas advantageous that children should be reared, and people had to be\ntempted into undergoing the toil of doing so, because the issue of their\nexperiment was doubtful. One cannot say to them, as one does to others\nwho bestow benefits, \"Choose the man to whom you give: you must only\nblame yourself if you are deceived; help the deserving.\" In rearing\nchildren nothing depends upon the judgment of those who rear them; it is\na matter of hope: in order, therefore, that people may be more willing\nto embark upon this lottery, it was right that they should be given a\ncertain authority; and since it is useful for youth to be governed, we\nhave placed their parents in the position of domestic magistrates, under\nwhose guardianship their lives may be ruled. Moreover, the position of\nparents differs from that of other benefactors, for their having given\nformerly to their children does not stand in the way of their giving\nnow and hereafter; and also, there is no fear of their falsely asserting\nthat they have given: with others one has to inquire not only whether\nthey have received, but whether they have given; but the good deeds of\nparents are placed beyond doubt. In the next place, one benefit bestowed\nby parents is the same for all, and might be counted once for all;\nwhile the others which they bestow are of various kinds, unlike one to\nanother, differing from one another by the widest possible intervals;\nthey can therefore come under no regular rule, since it would be more\njust to leave them all unrewarded than to give the same reward to all.\nXII. Some benefits cost much to the givers, some are of much value\nto the receivers but cost the givers nothing. Some are bestowed upon\nfriends, others on strangers: now although that which is given be the\nsame, yet it becomes more when it is given to one with whom you\nare beginning to be acquainted through the benefits which you have\npreviously conferred upon him. One man may give us help, another\ndistinctions, a third consolation. You may find one who thinks nothing\npleasanter or more important than to have some one to save him from\ndistress; you may again find one who would rather be helped to great\nplace than to security; while some consider themselves more indebted to\nthose who save their lives than to those who save their honour. Each\nof these services will be held more or less important, according as the\ndisposition of our judge inclines to one or the other of them. Besides\nthis, I choose my creditors for myself, whereas I often receive benefits\nfrom those from whom I would not, and sometimes I am laid under an\nobligation without my knowledge. What will you do in such a case? When\na man has received a benefit unknown to himself, and which, had he known\nof it, he would have refused to receive, will you call him ungrateful if\nhe does not repay it, however he may have received it? Suppose that some\none has bestowed a benefit upon me, and that the same man has afterwards\ndone me some wrong; am I to be bound by his one bounty to endure with\npatience any wrong that he may do me, or will it be the same as if I had\nrepaid it, because he himself has by the subsequent wrong cancelled his\nown benefit? How, in that case, would you decide which was the greater;\nthe present which the man has received, or the injury which has\nbeen done him? Time would fail me if I attempted to discuss all the\ndifficulties which would arise.\nXIII. It may be argued that \"we render men less willing to confer\nbenefits by not supporting the claim of those which have been bestowed\nto meet with gratitude, and by not punishing those who repudiate them.\"\nBut you would find, on the other hand, that men would be far less\nwilling to receive benefits, if by so doing they were likely to incur\nthe danger of having to plead their cause in court, and having more\ndifficulty in proving their integrity. This legislation would also\nrender us less willing to give: for no one is willing to give to those\nwho are unwilling to receive, but one who is urged to acts of kindness\nby his own good nature and by the beauty of charity, will give all the\nmore freely to those who need make no return unless they choose. It\nimpairs the credit of doing a service, if in doing it we are carefully\nprotected from loss.\nXIV. \"Benefits, then, will be fewer, but more genuine: well, what harm\nis there in restricting people from giving recklessly?\" Even those who\nwould have no legislation upon the subject follow this rule, that we\nought to be somewhat careful in giving, and in choosing those upon whom\nwe bestow favours. Reflect over and over again to whom you are giving:\nyou will have no remedy at law, no means of enforcing repayment. You are\nmistaken if you suppose that the judge will assist you: no law will\nmake full restitution to you, you must look only to the honour of the\nreceiver. Thus only can benefits retain their influence, and thus only\nare they admirable: you dishonour them if you make them the grounds of\nlitigation, \"Pay what you owe\" is a most just proverb; and one which\ncarries with it the sanction of all nations; but in dealing with\nbenefits it is most shameful. \"Pay!\" How is a man to pay who owes his\nlife, his position, his safety, or his reason to another? None of the\ngreatest benefits can be repaid. \"Yet,\" it is said, \"you ought to give\nin return for them something of equal value.\" This is just what I have\nbeen saying, that the grandeur of the act is ruined if we make our\nbenefits commercial transactions. We ought hot to encourage ourselves in\navarice, in discontent, or in quarrels; the human mind is prone enough\nto these by nature. As far as we are able, let us check it, and cut off\nthe opportunities for which it seeks.\nXV. Would that we could indeed persuade men to receive back money which\nthey have lent from those debtors only who are willing to pay! would\nthat no agreement ever bound the buyer to the seller, and that their\ninterests were not protected by sealed covenants and agreements, but\nrather by honour and a sense of justice! However, men prefer what\nis needful to what is truly best, and choose rather to force their\ncreditors to keep faith with them than to trust that they will do so.\nWitnesses are called on both sides; the one, by calling in brokers,\nmakes several names appear in his accounts as his debtors instead of\none; the other is not content with the legal forms of question and\nanswer unless he holds the other party by the hand. What a shameful\nadmission of the dishonesty and wickedness of mankind! men trust more to\nour signet-rings than to our intentions. For what are these respectable\nmen summoned? for what do they impress their seals? it is in order that\nthe borrower may not deny that he has received what he has received.\nYou regard these men, I suppose, as above bribes, as maintainers of the\ntruth: well, these very men will not be entrusted with money except on\nthe same terms. Would it not, then, be more honourable to be deceived\nby some than to suspect all men of dishonesty? To fill up the measure\nof avarice one thing only is lacking, that we should bestow no benefit\nwithout a surety. To help, to be of service, is the part of a generous\nand noble mind; he who gives acts like a god, he who demands repayment\nacts like a money-lender. Why then, by trying to protect the rights of\nthe former class, should we reduce them to the level of the basest of\nmankind?\nXVI. \"More men,\" our opponent argues, \"will be ungrateful, if no legal\nremedy exists against ingratitude.\" Nay, fewer, because then benefits\nwill be bestowed with more discrimination, In the next place, it is not\nadvisable that it should be publicly known how many ungrateful men there\nare: for the number of sinners will do away with the disgrace of\nthe sin, and a reproach which applies to all men will cease to be\ndishonourable. Is any woman ashamed of being divorced, now that some\nnoble ladies reckon the years of their lives, not by the number of the\nconsuls, but by that of their husbands, now that they leave their\nhomes in order to marry others, and marry only in order to be divorced?\nDivorce was only dreaded as long as it was unusual; now that no gazette\nappears without it, women learn to do what they hear so much about. Can\nany one feel ashamed of adultery, now that things have come to such\na pass that no woman keeps a husband at all unless it be to pique her\nlover? Chastity merely implies ugliness. Where will you find any woman\nso abject, so repulsive, as to be satisfied with a single pair of\nlovers, without having a different one for each hour of the day; nor is\nthe day long enough for all of them, unless she has taken her airing\nin the grounds of one, and passes the night with another. A woman is\nfrumpish and old-fashioned if she does not know that \"adultery with one\nparamour is nick-named marriage.\" Just as all shame at these vices has\ndisappeared since the vice itself became so widely spread, so if you\nmade the ungrateful begin to count their own numbers, you would both\nmake them more numerous, and enable them to be ungrateful with greater\nimpunity.\nXVII. \"What then? shall the ungrateful man go unpunished?\" What then,\nI answer, shall we punish the undutiful, the malicious, the avaricious,\nthe headstrong, and the cruel? Do you imagine that those things which\nare loathed are not punished, or do you suppose that any punishment is\ngreater than the hate of all men? It is a punishment not to dare receive\na benefit from anyone, not to dare to bestow one, to be, or to fancy\nthat you are a mark for all men's eyes, and to lose all appreciation of\nso excellent and pleasant a matter. Do you call a man unhappy who has\nlost his sight, or whose hearing has been impaired by disease, and do\nyou not call him wretched who has lost the power of feeling benefits? He\nfears the gods, the witnesses of all ingratitude; he is tortured by\nthe thought of the benefit which he has misapplied, and, in fine, he is\nsufficiently punished by this great penalty, that, as I said before, he\ncannot enjoy the fruits of this most delightful act. On the other hand,\nhe who takes pleasure in receiving a benefit, enjoys an unvarying and\ncontinuous happiness, which he derives from consideration, not of\nthe thing given, but of the intention of the giver. A benefit gives\nperpetual joy to a grateful man, but pleases an ungrateful one only for\na moment. Can the lives of such men be compared, seeing that the one\nis sad and gloomy--as it is natural that a denier of his debts and a\ndefrauder should be, a man who does not give his parents, his nurses, or\nhis teachers the honour which is their due--while the other is joyous,\ncheerful, on the watch for an opportunity of proving his gratitude, and\ngaining much pleasure from this frame of mind itself? Such a man has no\nwish to become bankrupt, but only to make the fullest and most copious\nreturn for benefits, and that not only to parents and friends, but also\nto more humble persons; for even if he receives a benefit from his\nown slave, he does not consider from whom he receives it, but what he\nreceives.\nXVIII. It has, however, been doubted by Hecaton and some other writers,\nwhether a slave can bestow a benefit upon his master. Some distinguish\nbetween benefits, duties, and services, calling those things benefits\nwhich are bestowed by a stranger--that is, by one who could discontinue\nthem without blame--while duties are performed by our children, our\nwives, and those whom relationship prompts and orders to afford us help;\nand, thirdly, services are performed by slaves, whose position is such\nthat nothing which they do for their master can give them any claim upon\nhim....\nBesides this, he who affirms that a slave does not sometimes confer\na benefit upon his master is ignorant of the rights of man; for the\nquestion is, not what the station in life of the giver may be, but what\nhis intentions are. The path of virtue is closed to no one, it lies open\nto all; it admits and invites all, whether they be free-born men, slaves\nor freed-men, kings or exiles; it requires no qualifications of family\nor of property, it is satisfied with a mere man. What, indeed, should we\nhave to trust to for defence against sudden misfortunes, what could--a\nnoble mind promise to itself to keep unshaken, if virtue could be lost\ntogether with prosperity? If a slave cannot confer a benefit upon his\nmaster, then no subject can confer a benefit upon his king, and no\nsoldier upon his general; for so long as the man is subject to supreme\nauthority, the form of authority can make no difference. If main force,\nor the fear of death and torture, can prevent a slave from gaining any\ntitle to his master's gratitude, they will also prevent the subjects of\na king, or the soldiers of a general from doing so, for the same things\nmay happen to either of these classes of men, though under different\nnames.\nYet men do bestow benefits upon their kings and their generals;\ntherefore slaves can bestow benefits upon their masters. A slave can be\njust, brave, magnanimous; he can therefore bestow a benefit, for this\nis also the part of a virtuous man. So true is it that slaves can bestow\nbenefits upon their masters, that the masters have often owed their\nlives to them.\nXIX. There is no doubt that a slave can bestow a benefit upon anyone;\nwhy, then, not upon his master? \"Because,\" it is argued, \"he cannot\nbecome his master's creditor if he gives him money. If this be not so,\nhe daily lays his master under an obligation to him; he attends him when\non a journey, he nurses him when sick, he works most laboriously at the\ncultivation of his estate; yet all these, which would be called benefits\nif done for us by anyone else, are merely called service when done by\na slave. A benefit is that which some one bestows who has the option of\nwithholding it:--now a slave has no power to refuse, so that he does\nnot afford us his help, but obeys our orders, and cannot boast of having\ndone what he could not leave undone.\" Even under these conditions I\nshall win the day, and will place a slave in such positions, that for\nmany purposes he will be free; in the meanwhile, tell me, if I give you\nan instance of a slave fighting for his master's safety without regard\nto himself, pierced through with wounds, yet spending the last drops of\nhis blood, and gaining time for his master to escape by the sacrifice of\nhis life, will you say that this man did not bestow a benefit upon his\nmaster because he was a slave? If I give an instance of one who could\nnot be bribed to betray his master's secrets by any of the offers of\na tyrant, who was not terrified by any threats, nor overpowered by any\ntortures, but who, as far as he was able, placed his questioners upon a\nwrong scent, and, paid for his loyalty with his life; will you say\nthat this man did not confer a benefit upon his master because he was a\nslave? Consider, rather, whether an example of virtue in a slave be not\nall the greater because it is rarer than in free men, and whether it be\nnot all the more gratifying that, although to be commanded is odious,\nand all submission to authority is irksome, yet in some particular cases\nlove for a master has been more powerful than men's general dislike to\nservitude. A benefit does not, therefore, cease to be a benefit because\nit is bestowed by a slave, but is all the greater on that account,\nbecause not even slavery could restrain him from bestowing it.\nXX. It is a mistake to imagine that slavery pervades a man's whole\nbeing; the better part of him is exempt from it: the body indeed is\nsubjected and in the power of a master, but the mind is independent, and\nindeed is so free and wild, that it cannot be restrained even by this\nprison of the body, wherein it is confined, from following its own\nimpulses, dealing with gigantic designs, and soaring into the infinite,\naccompanied by all the host of heaven. It is, therefore, only the body\nwhich misfortune hands over to a master, and which he buys and sells;\nthis inward part cannot be transferred as a chattel. Whatever comes\nfrom this, is free; indeed, we are not allowed to order all things to be\ndone, nor are slaves compelled to obey us in all things; they will not\ncarry out treasonable orders, or lend their hands to an act of crime.\nXXI. There are some things which the law neither enjoins nor forbids; it\nis in these that a slave finds the means of bestowing benefits. As long\nas we only receive what is generally demanded from a slave, that is\nmere service; when more is given than a slave need afford us, it is a\nbenefit; as soon as what he does begins to partake of the affection of\na friend, it can no longer be called service. There are certain things\nwith which a master is bound to provide his slave, such as food and\nclothing; no one calls this a benefit; but supposing that he indulges\nhis slave, educates him above his station, teaches him arts which\nfree-born men learn, that is a benefit. The converse is true in the case\nof the slave; anything which goes beyond the rules of a slave's duty,\nwhich is done of his own free will, and not in obedience to orders, is a\nbenefit, provided it be of sufficient importance to be called by such a\nname if bestowed by any other person.\nXXII. It has pleased Chrysippus to define a slave as \"a hireling for\nlife.\" Just as a hireling bestows a benefit when he does more than he\nengaged himself to do, so when a slave's love for his master raises him\nabove his condition and urges him to do something noble--something which\nwould be a credit even to men more fortunate by birth--he surpasses the\nhopes of his master, and is a benefit found in the house. Do you think\nit is just that we should be angry with our slaves when they do less\nthan their duty, and that we should not be grateful to them when they do\nmore? Do you wish to know when their service is not a benefit? When the\nquestion can be asked, \"What if he had refused to do it?\" When he does\nthat which he might have refused to do, we must praise his good will.\nBenefits and wrongs are opposites; a slave can bestow a benefit upon his\nmaster, if he can receive a wrong from his master. Now an official has\nbeen appointed to hear complaints of the wrongs done by masters to their\nslaves, whose duty it is to restrain cruelty and lust, or avarice in\nproviding them with the necessaries of life. What follows, then? Is it\nthe master who receives a benefit from his slave? nay, rather, it is\none man who receives it from another. Lastly, he did all that lay in his\npower; he bestowed a benefit upon his master; it lies in your power to\nreceive or not to receive it from a slave. Yet who is so exalted, that\nfortune may not make him need the aid even of the lowliest?\nXXIII. I shall now quote a number of instances of benefits, not all\nalike, some even contradictory. Some slaves have given their master\nlife, some death; have saved him when perishing, or, as if that were\nnot enough, have saved him by their own death; others have helped\ntheir master to die, some have saved his life by stratagem. Claudius\nQuadrigarius tells us in the eighteenth book of his \"Annals,\" that\nwhen Grumentum was being besieged, and had been reduced to the greatest\nstraits, two slaves deserted to the enemy, and did valuable service.\nAfterwards, when the city was taken, and the victors were rushing wildly\nin every direction, they ran before every one else along the streets,\nwhich they well knew, to the house in which they had been slaves, and\ndrove their mistress before them; when they were asked who she might\nbe, they answered that she was their mistress, and a most cruel one, and\nthat they were leading her away for punishment. They led her outside the\nwalls, and concealed her with the greatest care until the fighting\nwas over; then, as the soldiery, satisfied with the sack of the city,\nquickly resumed the manners of Romans, they also returned to their\nown countrymen, and themselves restored their mistress to them. She\nmanumitted each of them on the spot, and was not ashamed to receive her\nlife from men over whom she had held the power of life and death. She\nmight, indeed, especially congratulate herself upon this; for had\nshe been saved otherwise, she would merely have received a common and\nhackneyed piece of kindness, whereas, by being saved as she was, she\nbecame a glorious legend, and an example to two cities. In the confusion\nof the captured city, when every one was thinking only of his own\nsafety, all deserted her except these deserters; but they, that they\nmight prove what had been their intentions in effecting that desertion,\ndeserted again from the victors to the captive, wearing the masks of\nunnatural murderers.\nThey thought--and this was the greatest part of the service which they\nrendered--they were content to seem to have murdered their mistress, if\nthereby their mistress might be saved from murder. Believe me, it is\nthe mark of no slavish soul to purchase a noble deed by the semblance of\ncrime.\nWhen Vettius, the praetor of the Marsi, was being led into the presence\nof the Roman general, his slave snatched a sword from the soldier who\nwas dragging him along, and first slew his master. Then he said, \"It is\nnow time for me to look to myself; I have already set my master free,\"\nand with these words transfixed himself with one blow. Can you tell me\nof anyone who saved his master more gloriously?\nXXIV. When Caesar was besieging Corfinium, Domitius, who was shut up in\nthe city, ordered a slave of his own, who was also a physician, to give\nhim poison. Observing the man's hesitation, he said, \"Why do you delay,\nas though the whole business was in your power? I ask for death with\narms in my hands.\" Then the slave assented, and gave him a harmless drug\nto drink. When Domitius fell asleep after drinking this, the slave went\nto his son, and said, \"Give orders for my being kept in custody until\nyou learn from the result whether I have given your father poison or\nno.\" Domitius lived, and Caesar saved his life; but his slave had saved\nit before.\nXXV. During the civil war, a slave hid his master, who had been\nproscribed, put on his rings and clothes, met the soldiers who were\nsearching for him, and, after declaring that he would not stoop to\nentreat them not to carry out their orders, offered his neck to their\nswords. What a noble spirit it shows in a slave to have been willing\nto die for his master, at a time when few were faithful enough to\nwish their master to live! to be found kind when the state was cruel,\nfaithful when it was treacherous! to be eager for the reward of\nfidelity, though it was death, at a time when such rich rewards were\noffered for treachery!\nXXVI. I will not pass over the instances which our own age affords. In\nthe reign of Tiberius Caesar, there was a common and almost universal\nfrenzy for informing, which was more ruinous to the citizens of Rome\nthan the whole civil war; the talk of drunkards, the frankness of\njesters, was alike reported to the government; nothing was safe; every\nopportunity of ferocious punishment was seized, and men no longer waited\nto hear the fate of accused persons, since it was always the same. One\nPaulus, of the Praetorian guard, was at an entertainment, wearing a\nportrait of Tiberius Caesar engraved in relief upon a gem. It would be\nabsurd for me to beat about the bush for some delicate way of explaining\nthat he took up a chamber-pot, an action which was at once noticed by\nMaro, one of the most notorious informers of that time, and the slave of\nthe man who was about to fall into the trap, who drew the ring from the\nfinger of his drunken master. When Maro called the guests to witness\nthat Paulus had dishonoured the portrait of the emperor, and was already\ndrawing up an act of accusation, the slave showed the ring upon his\nown finger. Such a man no more deserves to be called a slave, than Maro\ndeserved to be called a guest.\nXXVII. In the reign of Augustus men's own words were not yet able to\nruin them, yet they sometimes brought them into trouble. A senator named\nRufus, while at dinner, expressed a hope that Caesar would not return\nsafe from a journey for which he was preparing, and added that all bulls\nand calves wished the same thing. Some of those present carefully noted\nthese words. At daybreak, the slave who had stood at his feet during the\ndinner, told him what he had said in his cups, and urged him to be the\nfirst to go to Caesar, and denounce himself. Rufus followed this advice,\nmet Caesar as he was going down to the forum, and, swearing that he was\nout of his mind the day before, prayed that what he had said might fall\nupon his own head and that of his children; he then begged Caesar pardon\nhim, and to take him back into favour. When Caesar said that he would\ndo so, he added, \"No one will believe that you have taken me back into\nfavour unless you make me a present of something;\" and he asked for and\nobtained a sum of money so large, that it would have been a gift not to\nbe slighted even if bestowed by an unoffended prince. Caesar added: \"In\nfuture I will take care never to quarrel with you, for my own sake.\"\nCaesar acted honourably in pardoning him, and in being liberal as well\nas forgiving; no one can hear this anecdote without praising Caesar,\nbut he must praise the slave first. You need not wait for me to tell\nyou that the slave who did his master this service was set free; yet his\nmaster did not do this for nothing, for Caesar had already paid him the\nprice of the slave's liberty.\nXXVIII. After so many instances, can we doubt that a master may\nsometimes receive a benefit from a slave? Why need the person of the\ngiver detract from the thing which he gives? why should not the gift add\nrather to the glory of the giver. All men descend from the same original\nstock; no one is better born than another, except in so far as his\ndisposition is nobler and better suited for the performance of good\nactions. Those who display portraits of their ancestors in their halls,\nand set up in the entrance to their houses the pedigree of their family\ndrawn out at length, with many complicated collateral branches, are they\nnot notorious rather than noble? The universe is the one parent of all,\nwhether they trace their descent from this primary source through a\nglorious or a mean line of ancestors. Be not deceived when men who are\nreckoning up their genealogy, wherever an illustrious name is wanting,\nfoist in that of a god in its place. You need despise no one, even\nthough he bears a commonplace name, and owes little to fortune. Whether\nyour immediate ancestors were freedmen, or slaves, or foreigners, pluck\nup your spirits boldly, and leap over any intervening disgraces of your\npedigree; at its source, a noble origin awaits you. Why should our\npride inflate us to such a degree that we think it beneath us to receive\nbenefits from slaves, and think only of their position, forgetting their\ngood deeds? You, the slave of lust, of gluttony, of a harlot, nay, who\nare owned as a joint chattel by harlots, can you call anyone else\na slave? Call a man a slave? why, I pray you, whither are you being\nhurried by those bearers who carry your litter? whither are these men\nwith their smart military-looking cloaks carrying you? is it not to the\ndoor of some door-keeper, or to the gardens of some one who has not even\na subordinate office? and then you, who regard the salute of another\nman's slave as a benefit, declare that you cannot receive a benefit from\nyour own slave. What inconsistency is this? At the same time you despise\nand fawn upon slaves, you are haughty and violent at home, while out of\ndoors you are meek, and as much despised as you despise your slaves;\nfor none abase themselves lower than those who unconscionably give\nthemselves airs, nor are anymore prepared to trample upon others than\nthose who have learned how to offer insults by having endured them.\nXXIX. I felt it my duty to say this, in order to crush the arrogance of\nmen who are themselves at the mercy of fortune, and to claim the right\nof bestowing a benefit for slaves, in order that I may claim it also for\nsons. The question arises, whether children can ever bestow upon their\nparents greater benefits than those which they have received from them.\nIt is granted that many sons become greater and more powerful than their\nparents, and also that they are better men. If this be true, they may\ngive better gifts to their fathers than they have received from them,\nseeing that their fortune and their good nature are alike greater than\nthat of their father. \"Whatever a father receives from his son,\" our\nopponent will urge, \"must in any case be lees than what the son received\nfrom him, because the son owes to his father the very power of giving.\nTherefore the father can never be surpassed in the bestowal of benefits,\nbecause the benefit which surpasses his own is really his.\" I answer,\nthat some things derive their first origin from others, yet are greater\nthan those others; and a thing may be greater than that from which it\ntook its rise, although without that thing to start from it never could\nhave grown so great. All things greatly outgrow their beginnings. Seeds\nare the causes of all things, and yet are the smallest part of the\nthings which they produce. Look at the Rhine, or the Euphrates, or any\nother famous rivers; how small they are, if you only view them at the\nplace from whence they take their rise? they gain all that makes them\nterrible and renowned as they flow along. Look at the trees which are\ntallest if you consider their height, and the broadest if you look at\ntheir thickness and the spread of their branches; compared with all\nthis, how small a part of them is contained in the slender fibres of\nthe root? Yet take away their roots, and no more groves will arise, nor\ngreat mountains be clothed with trees. Temples and cities are supported\nby their foundations; yet what is built as the foundation of the entire\nbuilding lies out of sight. So it is in other matters; the subsequent\ngreatness of a thing ever eclipses its origin. I could never have\nobtained anything without having previously received the boon of\nexistence from my parents; yet it does not follow from this that\nwhatever I obtain is less than that without which I could not obtain it.\nIf my nurse had not fed me when I was a child, I should not have been\nable to conduct any of those enterprises which I now carry on, both with\nmy head and with my hand, nor should I ever have obtained the fame which\nis due to my labours both in peace and war; would you on that account\nargue that the services of a nurse were more valuable than the most\nimportant undertakings? Yet is not the nurse as important as the father,\nsince without the benefits which I have received from each of them\nalike, I should have been alike unable to effect anything? If I owe all\nthat I now can do to my original beginning, I cannot regard my father or\nmy grandfather as being this original beginning; there always will be a\nspring further back, from which the spring next below is derived. Yet no\none will argue that I owe more to unknown and forgotten ancestors\nthan to my father; though really I do owe them more, if I owe it to my\nancestors that my father begat me.\nXXX. \"Whatever I have bestowed upon my father,\" says my opponent,\n\"however great it may be, yet is less valuable than what my father has\nbestowed upon me, because if he had not begotten me, it never could\nhave existed at all.\" By this mode of reasoning, if a man has healed\nmy father when ill, and at the point of death, I shall not be able to\nbestow anything upon him equivalent to what I have received from him;\nfor had my father not been healed, he could not have begotten me. Yet\nthink whether it be not nearer the truth to regard all that I can do,\nand all that I have done, as mine, due to my own powers and my own will?\nConsider what the fact of my birth is in itself; you will see that it\nis a small matter, the outcome of which is dubious, and that it may lead\nequally to good or to evil; no doubt it is the first step to everything,\nbut because it is the first, it is not on that account more important\nthan all the others. Suppose that I have saved my father's life, raised\nhim to the highest honours, and made him the chief man in his city,\nthat I have not merely made him illustrious by my own deeds, but have\nfurnished him himself with an opportunity of performing great exploits,\nwhich is at once important, easy, and safe, as well as glorious; that I\nhave loaded him with appointments, wealth, and all that attracts men's\nminds; still, even when I surpass all others, I am inferior to him.\nNow if you say, \"You owe to your father the power of doing all this,\" I\nshall answer, \"Quite true, if to do all this it is only necessary to be\nborn; but if life is merely an unimportant factor in the art of living\nwell, and if you have bestowed upon me only that which I have in common\nwith wild beasts and the smallest, and some of the foulest of creatures,\ndo not claim for yourself what did not come into being in consequence of\nthe benefits which you bestowed, even though it could not have come into\nbeing without them.\"\nXXXI. Suppose, father, that I have saved your life, in return for the\nlife which I received from you: in this case also I have outdone your\nbenefit, because I have given life to one who understands what I have\ndone, and because I understood what I was doing, since I gave you your\nlife not for the sake of, or by the means of my own pleasure; for just\nas it is less terrible to die before one has time to fear death, so it\nis a much greater boon to preserve one's life than to receive it. I have\ngiven life to one who will at once enjoy it, you gave it to one who knew\nnot if he should ever live; I have given life to one who was in fear of\ndeath, your gift of life merely enables me to die; I have given you a\nlife complete, perfect; you begat me without intelligence, a burden upon\nothers. Do you wish to know how far from a benefit it was to give life\nunder such conditions? You should have exposed me as a child, for you\ndid me a wrong in begetting me. What do I gather from this? That the\ncohabitation of a father and mother is the very least of benefits to\ntheir child, unless in addition this beginning of kindnesses be followed\nup by others, and confirmed by other services. It is not a good thing\nto live, but to live well. \"But,\" say you, \"I do live well.\" True, but\nI might have lived ill; so that your part in me is merely this, that I\nlive. If you claim merit to yourself for giving me mere life, bare and\nhelpless, and boast of it as a great boon, reflect that this you claim\nmerit for giving me is a boon which I possess in common with flies and\nworms. In the next place, if I say no more than that I have applied\nmyself to honourable pursuits, and have guided the course of my life\nalong the path of rectitude, then you have received more from your\nbenefit than you gave; for you gave me to myself ignorant and unlearned,\nand I have returned to you a son such as you would wish to have\nbegotten.\nXXXII. My father supported me. If I repay this kindness, I give him\nmore than I received, because he has the pleasure, not only of being\nsupported, but of being supported by a son, and receives more delight\nfrom my filial devotion than from the food itself, whereas the food\nwhich he used to give me merely affected my body. What? if any man\nrises so high as to become famous among nations for his eloquence, his\njustice, or his military skill, if much of the splendour of his renown\nis shed upon his father also, and by its clear light dispels the\nobscurity of his birth, does not such a man confer an inestimable\nbenefit upon his parents? Would anyone have heard of Aristo and Gryllus\nexcept through Xenophon and Plato, their sons? Socrates keeps alive\nthe memory of Sophroniscus. It would take long to recount the other\nmen whose names survive for no other reason than that the admirable\nqualities of their sons have handed them down to posterity. Did the\nfather of Marcus Agrippa, of whom nothing was known, even after Agrippa\nbecame famous, confer the greater benefit upon his son, or was that\ngreater which Agrippa conferred upon his father when he gained the\nglory, unique in the annals of war, of a naval crown, and when he raised\nso many vast buildings in Rome, which not only surpassed all former\ngrandeur, but have been surpassed by none since? Did Octavius confer a\ngreater benefit upon his son, or the Emperor Augustus upon his father,\nobscured as he was by the intervention of an adoptive father? What joy\nwould he have experienced, if, after the putting down of the civil war,\nhe had seen his son ruling the state in peace and security? He would not\nhave recognized the good which he had himself bestowed, and would hardly\nhave believed, when he looked back upon himself, that so great a man\ncould have been born in his house. Why should I go on to speak of others\nwho would now be forgotten, if the glory of their sons had not raised\nthem from obscurity, and kept them in the light until this day? In the\nnext place, as we are not considering what son may have given back to\nhis father greater benefits than he received from him, but whether a son\ncan give back greater benefits, even if the examples which I have quoted\nare not sufficient, and such benefits do not outweigh the benefits\nbestowed by the parents, if no age has produced. an actual example,\nstill it is not in the nature of things impossible. Though no solitary\nact can outweigh the deserts of a parent, yet many such acts combined by\none son may do so.\nXXXIII. Scipio, while under seventeen years of age, rode among the enemy\nin battle, and saved his father's life. Was it not enough, that in order\nto reach his father he despised so many dangers when they were pressing\nhardest upon the greatest generals, that he, a novice in his first\nbattle, made his way through so many obstacles, over the bodies of so\nmany veteran soldiers, and showed strength and courage beyond his years?\nAdd to this, that he also defended his father in court, and saved him\nfrom a plot of his powerful enemies, that he heaped upon him a second\nand a third consulship and other posts which were coveted even by\nconsulars, that when his father was poor he bestowed upon him the\nplunder which he took by military licence, and that he made him rich\nwith the spoils of the enemy, which is the greatest honour of a soldier.\nIf even this did not repay his debt, add to it that he caused him to\nbe constantly employed in the government of provinces and in special\ncommands, add, that after he had destroyed the greatest cities,\nand became without a rival either in the east or in the west, the\nacknowledged protector and second founder of the Roman Empire, he\nbestowed upon one who was already of noble birth the higher title of\n\"the father of Scipio;\" can we doubt that the commonplace benefit of his\nbirth was outdone by his exemplary conduct, and by the valour which was\nat once the glory and the protection of his country? Next, if this\nbe not enough, suppose that a son were to rescue his father from the\ntorture, or to undergo it in his stead. You can suppose the benefits\nreturned by the son as great as you please, whereas the gift he received\nfrom his father was of one sort only, was easily performed, and was\na pleasure to the giver; that he must necessarily have given the same\nthing to many others, even to some to whom he knows not that he has\ngiven it, that he had a partner in doing so, and that he had in view the\nlaw, patriotism, the rewards bestowed upon fathers of families by the\nstate, the maintenance of his house and family: everything rather than\nhim to whom he was giving life. What? supposing that any one were to\nlearn philosophy and teach it to his father, could it be any longer\ndisputed that the son had given him something greater than he had\nreceived from him, having returned to his father a happy life, whereas\nhe had received from him merely life?\nXXXIV. \"But,\" says our opponent, \"whatever you do, whatever you are able\nto give to your father, is part of his benefit bestowed upon you.\" So\nit is the benefit of my teacher that I have become proficient in liberal\nstudies; yet we pass on from those who taught them to us, at any rate\nfrom those who taught us the alphabet; and although no one can learn\nanything without them, yet it does not follow that whatsoever success\none subsequently obtains, one is still inferior to those teachers. There\nis a great difference between the beginning of a thing and its final\ndevelopment; the beginning is not equal to the thing at its greatest,\nmerely upon the ground that, without the beginning, it could never have\nbecome so great.\nXXXV. It is now time for me to bring forth something, so to speak, from\nmy own mint. So long as there is something better than the benefit which\na man bestows, he may be outdone. A father gives life to his son;\nthere is something better than life; therefore a father may be outdone,\nbecause there is something better than the benefit which he has\nbestowed. Still further, he who has given any one his life, if he be\nmore than once saved from peril of death by him, has received a greater\nbenefit than he bestowed. Now, a father has given life to his son: if,\ntherefore, he be more than once saved from peril by his son, he can\nreceive a greater benefit than he gave. A benefit becomes greater to the\nreceiver in proportion to his need of it. Now he who is alive needs life\nmore than he who has not been born, seeing that such a one can have no\nneed at all; consequently a father, if his life is saved by his son,\nreceives a greater benefit than his son received from him by being born.\nIt is said, \"The benefits conferred by fathers cannot be outdone by\nthose returned by their sons.\" Why? \"Because the son received life from\nhis father, and had he not received it, he could not have returned any\nbenefits at all.\" A father has this in common with all those who have\ngiven any men their lives; it is impossible that these men could repay\nthe debt if they had not received their life. Then I suppose one cannot\noverpay one's debt to a physician, for a physician gives life as well\nas a father; or to a sailor who has saved us when shipwrecked? Yet the\nbenefits bestowed by these and by all the others who give us life in\nwhatever fashion, can be outdone: consequently those of our fathers can\nbe outdone. If any one bestows upon me a benefit which requires the help\nof benefits from many other persons, whereas I give him what requires no\none to help it out, I have given more than I have received; now a father\ngave to his son a life which, without many accessories to preserve it,\nwould perish; whereas a son, if he gives life to his father, gives him\na life which requires no assistance to make it lasting; therefore the\nfather who receives life from his son, receives a greater benefit than\nhe himself bestowed upon his son.\nXXXVI. These considerations do not destroy the respect due to parents,\nor make their children behave worse to them, nay, better; for virtue\nis naturally ambitious, and wishes to outstrip those who are before it.\nFilial piety will be all the more eager, if, in returning a father's\nbenefits, it can hope to outdo them; nor will this be against the will\nor the pleasure of the father, since in many contests it is to our\nadvantage to be outdone. How does this contest become so desirable?\nHow comes it to be such happiness to parents that they should confess\nthemselves outdone by the benefits bestowed by their children? Unless we\ndecide the matter thus, we give children an excuse, and make them less\neager to repay their debt, whereas we ought to spur them on, saying,\n\"Noble youths, give your attention to this! You are invited to contend\nin an honourable strife between parents and children, as to which party\nhas received more than it has given. Your fathers have not necessarily\nwon the day because they are first in the field: only take courage, as\nbefits you, and do not give up the contest; you will conquer if you wish\nto do so. In this honourable warfare you will have no lack of leaders\nwho will encourage you to perform deeds like their own, and bid you\nfollow in their footsteps upon a path by which victory has often before\nnow been won over parents.\"\nXXXVII. AEneas conquered his father in well doing, for he himself had\nbeen but a light and a safe burden for him when he was a child, yet he\nbore his father, when heavy with age, through the midst of the enemy's\nlines and the crash of the city which was falling around him, albeit the\ndevout old man, who bore the sacred images and the household gods in\nhis hands, pressed him with more than his own weight; nevertheless\n(what cannot filial piety accomplish!) AEneas bore him safe through the\nblazing city, and placed him in safety, to be worshipped as one of the\nfounders of the Roman Empire. Those Sicilian youths outdid their parents\nwhom they bore away safe, when Aetna, roused to unusual fury, poured\nfire over cities and fields throughout a great part of the island. It\nis believed that the fires parted, and that the flames retired on either\nside, so as to leave a passage for these youths to pass through, who\ncertainly deserved to perform their daring task in safety. Antigonus\noutdid his father when, after having conquered the enemy in a great\nbattle, he transferred the fruits of it to him, and handed over to him\nthe empire of Cyprus. This is true kingship, to choose not to be a king\nwhen you might. Manlius conquered his father, imperious [Footnote:\nThere is an allusion to the surname of both the father and the son,\n\"Imperiosus\" given them on account of their severity.] though he was,\nwhen, in spite of his having previously been banished for a time by his\nfather on, account of his dulness and stupidity as a boy, he came to an\ninterview which he had demanded with the tribune of the people, who\nhad filed an action against his father. The tribune had granted him the\ninterview, hoping that he would betray his hated father, and believed\nthat he had earned the gratitude of the youth, having, amongst other\nmatters, reproached old Manlius with sending him into exile, treating\nit as a very serious accusation; but the youth, having caught him alone,\ndrew a sword which he had hidden in his robe, and said, \"Unless you\nswear to give up your suit against my father, I will run you through\nwith this sword. It is in your power to decide how my father shall be\nfreed from his prosecutor.\" The tribune swore, and kept his oath; he\nrelated the reason of his abandonment of his action to an assembly at\nthe Rostra. No other man was ever permitted to put down a tribune with\nimpunity.\nXXXVIII. There are instances without number of men who have saved their\nparents from danger, have raised them from the lowest to the highest\nstation, and, taking them from the nameless mass of the lower classes,\nhave given them a name glorious throughout all ages. By no force of\nwords, by no power of genius, can one rightly express how desirable, how\nadmirable, how never to be erased from human memory it is to be able to\nsay, \"I obeyed my parents, I gave way to them, I was submissive to their\nauthority whether it was just, or unjust and harsh; the only point in\nwhich I resisted them was, not to be conquered by them in benefits.\"\nContinue this struggle, I beg of you, and even though weary, yet re-form\nyour ranks. Happy are they who conquer, happy they who are conquered.\nWhat can be more glorious than the youth who can say to himself--it\nwould not be right to say it to another--\"I have conquered my father\nwith benefits\"? What is more fortunate than that old man who declares\neverywhere to everyone that he has been conquered in benefits by\nhis son? What, again, is more blissful than to be overcome in such a\ncontest?\nBOOK IV.\nI.\nOf all the matters which we have discussed, Aebutius Liberalis, there is\nnone more essential, or which, as Sallust says, ought to be stated with\nmore care than that which is now before us: whether the bestowal of\nbenefits and the return of gratitude for them are desirable objects\nin themselves. Some men are found who act honourably from commercial\nmotives, and who do not care for unrewarded virtue, though it can confer\nno glory if it brings any profit. What can be more base than for a man\nto consider what it costs him to be a good man, when virtue neither\nallures by gain nor deters by loss, and is so far from bribing any one\nwith hopes and promises, that on the other hand she bids them spend\nmoney upon herself, and often consists in voluntary gifts? We must go to\nher, trampling what is merely useful under our feet: whithersoever she\nmay call us or send us we must go, without any regard for our private\nfortunes, sometimes without sparing even our own blood, nor must we\never refuse to obey any of her commands. \"What shall I gain,\" says my\nopponent, \"if I do this bravely and gratefully?\" You will gain the doing\nof it--the deed itself is your gain. Nothing beyond this is promised. If\nany advantage chances to accrue to you, count it as something extra.\nThe reward of honourable dealings lies in themselves. If honour is to be\nsought after for itself, since a benefit is honourable, it follows that\nbecause both of these are of the same nature, their conditions must also\nbe the same. Now it has frequently and satisfactorily been proved, that\nhonour ought to be sought after for itself alone.\nII. In this part of the subject we oppose the Epicureans, an effeminate\nand dreamy sect who philosophize in their own paradise, amongst whom\nvirtue is the handmaid of pleasures, obeys them, is subject to them,\nand regards them as superior to itself. You say, \"there is no pleasure\nwithout virtue.\" But wherefore is it superior to virtue? Do you imagine\nthat the matter in dispute between them is merely one of precedence?\nNay, it is virtue itself and its powers which are in question. It cannot\nbe virtue if it can follow; the place of virtue is first, she ought to\nlead, to command, to stand in the highest rank; you bid her look for a\ncue to follow. \"What,\" asks our opponent, \"does that matter to you? I\nalso declare that happiness is impossible without virtue. Without virtue\nI disapprove of and condemn the very pleasures which I pursue, and to\nwhich I have surrendered myself. The only matter in dispute is this,\nwhether virtue be the cause of the highest good, or whether it be itself\nthe highest good.\" Do you suppose, though this be the only point in\nquestion, that it is a mere matter of precedence? It is a confusion and\nobvious blindness to prefer the last to the first. I am not angry at\nvirtue being placed below pleasure, but at her being mixed up at all\nwith pleasure, which she despises, whose enemy she is, and from which\nshe separates herself as far as possible, being more at home with labour\nand sorrow, which are manly troubles, than with your womanish good\nthings.\nIII. It was necessary to insert this argument, my Liberalis, because\nit is the part of virtue to bestow those benefits which we are now\ndiscussing, and it is most disgraceful to bestow benefits for any other\npurpose than that they should be free gifts. If we give with the hope of\nreceiving a return, we should give to the richest men, not to the most\ndeserving: whereas we prefer a virtuous poor man to an unmannerly rich\none. That is not a benefit, which takes into consideration the fortune\nof the receiver. Moreover, if our only motive for benefiting others was\nour own advantage, those who could most easily distribute benefits, such\nas rich and powerful men, or kings, and persons who do not stand in need\nof the help of others, ought never to do so at all; the gods would\nnot bestow upon us the countless blessings which they pour upon us\nunceasingly by night and by day, for their own nature suffices them in\nall respects, and renders them complete, safe, and beyond the reach of\nharm; they will, therefore, never bestow a benefit upon any one, if self\nand self interest be the only cause for the bestowal of benefits. To\ntake thought, not where your benefit will be best bestowed, but where\nit may be most profitably placed at interest, from whence you will most\neasily get it back, is not bestowal of benefits, but usury. Now the gods\nhave nothing to do with usury; it follows, therefore, that they cannot\nbe liberal; for if the only reason for giving is the advantage of the\ngiver, since God cannot hope to receive any advantages from us, there is\nno cause why God should give anything.\nIV. I know what answer may be made to this. \"True; therefore God does\nnot bestow benefits, but, free from care and unmindful of us, He\nturns away from our world and either does something else, or else does\nnothing, which Epicurus thought the greatest possible happiness, and\nHe is not affected either by benefits or by injuries.\" The man who says\nthis cannot surely hear the voices of worshippers, and of those who all\naround him are raising their hands to heaven and praying for the success\nboth of their private affairs and those of the state; which certainly\nwould not be the case, all men would not agree in this madness of\nappealing to deaf and helpless gods, unless we knew that their benefits\nare sometimes bestowed upon us unasked, sometimes in answer to our\nprayers, and that they give us both great and seasonable gifts, which\nshield us from the most terrible dangers. Who is there so poor, so\nuncared for, born to sorrow by so unkind a fate, as never to have felt\nthe vast generosity of the Gods? Look even at those who complain and are\ndiscontented with their lot; you will find that they are not altogether\nwithout a share in the bounty of heaven, that there is no one upon whom\nsomething has not been shed from that most gracious fount. Is the gift\nwhich is bestowed upon all alike, at their birth, not enough? However\nunequally the blessings of after life may be dealt out to us, did nature\ngive us too little when she gave us herself?\nV. It is said, \"God does not bestow benefits.\" Whence, then, comes all\nthat you possess, that you give or refuse to give, that you hoard or\nsteal? whence come these innumerable delights of our eyes, our ears, and\nour minds? whence the plenty which provides us even with luxury--for it\nis not our bare necessities alone against which provision is made;\nwe are loved so much as actually to be pampered--whence so many trees\nbearing various fruits, so many wholesome herbs, so many different sorts\nof food distributed throughout the year, so that even the slothful may\nfind sustenance in the chance produce of the earth? Then, too, whence\ncome the living creatures of all kinds, some inhabiting the dry land,\nothers the waters, others alighting from the sky, that every part of\nnature may pay us some tribute; the rivers which encircle our meadows\nwith most beauteous bends, the others which afford a passage to merchant\nfleets as they flow on, wide and navigable, some of which in summer\ntime are subject to extraordinary overflowings in order that lands lying\nparched under a glowing sun may suddenly be watered by the rush of a\nmidsummer torrent?\nWhat of the fountains of medicinal waters? What of the bursting forth of\nwarm waters upon the seashore itself? Shall I\n\"Tell of the seas round Italy that flow,\nWhich laves her shore above, and which below;\nOr of her lakes, unrivalled Larius, thee,\nOr thee, Benacus, roaring like a sea?\"\nVI. If any one gave you a few acres, you would say that you had received\na benefit; can you deny that the boundless extent of the earth is a\nbenefit? If any one gave you money, and filled your chest, since you\nthink that so important, you would call that a benefit. God has buried\ncountless mines in the earth, has poured out from the earth countless\nrivers, rolling sands of gold; He has concealed in every place huge\nmasses of silver, copper and iron, and has bestowed upon you the means\nof discovering them, placing upon the surface of the earth signs of the\ntreasures hidden below; and yet do you say that you have received\nno benefit? If a house were given you, bright with marble, its roof\nbeautifully painted with colours and gilding, you would call it no small\nbenefit. God has built for you a huge mansion that fears no fire or\nruin, in which you see no flimsy veneers, thinner than the very saw with\nwhich they are cut, but vast blocks of most precious stone, all composed\nof those various and different substances whose paltriest fragments you\nadmire so much; he has built a roof which glitters in one fashion by\nday, and in another by night; and yet do you say that you have received\nno benefit? When you so greatly prize what you possess, do you act the\npart of an ungrateful man, and think that there is no one to whom you\nare indebted for them? Whence comes the breath which you draw? the light\nby which you arrange and perform all the actions of your life? the blood\nby whose circulation your vital warmth is maintained? those meats\nwhich excite your palate by their delicate flavour after your hunger is\nappeased? those provocatives which rouse you when wearied with pleasure?\nthat repose in which you are rotting and mouldering? Will you not, if\nyou are grateful, say--\n\"'Tis to a god that this repose I owe,\nFor him I worship, as a god below.\nOft on his altar shall my firstlings bleed,\nSee, by his bounty here with rustic reed\nI play the airs I love the livelong day,\nThe while my oxen round about me stray.\"\nThe true God is he who has placed, not a few oxen, but all the herds on\ntheir pastures throughout the world; who furnishes food to the flocks\nwherever they wander; who has ordained the alternation of summer and\nwinter pasturage, and has taught us not merely to play upon a reed, and\nto reduce to some order a rustic and artless song, but who has invented\nso many arts and varieties of voice, so many notes to make music,\nsome with our own breath, some with instruments. You cannot call our\ninventions our own any more than you call our growth our own, or the\nvarious bodily functions which correspond to each stage of our lives; at\none time comes the loss of childhood's teeth, at another, when our age\nis advancing and growing into robuster manhood, puberty and the last\nwisdom-tooth marks the end of our youth. \"We have implanted in us the\nseeds of all ages, of all arts, and God our master brings forth our\nintellects from obscurity.\"\nVII. \"Nature,\" says my opponent, \"gives me all this.\" Do you not\nperceive when you say this that you merely speak of God under another\nname? for what is nature but God and divine reason, which pervades the\nuniverse and all its parts? You may address the author of our world\nby as many different titles as you please; you may rightly call him\nJupiter, Best and Greatest, and the Thunderer, or the Stayer, so called,\nnot because, as the historians tell us, he stayed the flight of the\nRoman army in answer to the prayer of Romulus, but because all things\ncontinue in their stay through his goodness. If you were to call this\nsame personage Fate, you would not lie; for since fate is nothing more\nthan a connected chain of causes, he is the first cause of all upon\nwhich all the rest depend. You will also be right in applying to him any\nnames that you please which express supernatural strength and power: he\nmay have as many titles as he has attributes.\nVIII. Our school regards him as Father Liber, and Hercules, and\nMercurius: he is Father Liber because he is the parent of all, who first\ndiscovered the power of seed, and our being led by pleasure to plant it;\nhe is Hercules, because his might is unconquered, and when it is wearied\nafter completing its labours, will retire into fire; he is Mercurius,\nbecause in him is reasoning, and numbers, and system, and knowledge.\nWhither-soever you turn yourself you will see him meeting you:\nnothing is void of him, he himself fills his own work. Therefore, most\nungrateful of mortals, it is in vain that you declare yourself indebted,\nnot to God, but to nature, because there can be no God without nature,\nnor any nature without God; they are both the same thing, differing only\nin their functions. If you were to say that you owe to Annaeus or\nto Lucius what you received from Seneca, you would not change your\ncreditor, but only his name, because he remains the same man whether you\nuse his first, second, or third name. So whether you speak of nature,\nfate, or fortune, these are all names of the same God, using his power\nin different ways. So likewise justice, honesty, discretion, courage,\nfrugality, are all the good qualities of one and the same mind; if you\nare pleased with any one of these, you are pleased with that mind.\nIX. However, not to drift aside into a distinct controversy, God bestows\nupon us very many and very great benefits without hope of receiving any\nreturn; since he does not require any offering from us, and we are\nnot capable of bestowing anything upon him: wherefore, a benefit is\ndesirable in itself. In it the advantage of the receiver is all that\nis taken into consideration: we study this without regarding our own\ninterests. \"Yet,\" argues our opponent, \"you say that we ought to choose\nwith care the persons upon whom we bestow benefits, because neither do\nhusbandmen sow seed in the sand: now if this be true, we follow our own\ninterest in bestowing benefits, just as much as in ploughing and sowing:\nfor sowing is not desirable in itself. Besides this you inquire where\nand how you ought to bestow a benefit, which would not need to be\ndone if the bestowal of a benefit was desirable in itself: because in\nwhatever place and whatever manner it might be bestowed, it still would\nbe a benefit.\" We seek to do honourable acts, solely because they are\nhonourable; yet even though we need think of nothing else, we consider\nto whom we shall do them, and when, and how; for in these points the act\nhas its being. In like manner, when I choose upon whom I shall bestow\na benefit, and when I aim at making it a benefit; because if it were\nbestowed upon a base person, it could neither be a benefit nor an\nhonourable action.\nX. To restore what has been entrusted to one is desirable in itself; yet\nI shall not always restore it, nor shall I do so in any place or at any\ntime you please. Sometimes it makes no difference whether I deny that I\nhave received it, or return it openly. I shall consider the interests\nof the person to whom I am to return it, and shall deny that I have\nreceived a deposit, which would injure him if returned. I shall act in\nthe same manner in bestowing a benefit: I shall consider when to give\nit, to whom, in what manner, and on what grounds. Nothing ought to be\ndone without a reason: a benefit is not truly so, if it be bestowed\nwithout a reason, since reason accompanies all honorable action. How\noften do we hear men reproaching themselves for some thoughtless gift,\nand saying, \"I had rather have thrown it away than have given it to\nhim!\" What is thoughtlessly given away is lost in the most discreditable\nmanner, and it is much worse to have bestowed a benefit badly than to\nhave received no return for it; that we receive no return is the fault\nof another; that we did not choose upon whom we should bestow it, is our\nown. In choosing a fit person, I shall not, as you expect, pay the\nleast attention to whether I am likely to get any return from him, for\nI choose one who will be grateful, not one who will return my goodness,\nand it often happens that the man who makes no return is grateful, while\nhe who returns a benefit is ungrateful for it. I value men by their\nhearts alone, and, therefore, I shall pass over a rich man if he be\nunworthy, and give to a good man though he be poor; for he will be\ngrateful however destitute he may be, since whatever he may lose, his\nheart will still be left him.\nXI. I do not fish for gain, for pleasure, or for credit, by bestowing\nbenefits: satisfied in doing so with pleasing one man alone, I shall\ngive in order to do my duty. Duty, however, leaves one some choice; do\nyou ask me, how I am to choose? I shall choose an honest, plain, man,\nwith a good memory, and grateful for kindness; one who keeps his hands\noff other men's goods, yet does not greedily hold to his own, and who is\nkind to others; when I have chosen such a man, I shall have acted to my\nmind, although fortune may have bestowed upon him no means of returning\nmy kindness. If my own advantage and mean calculation made me liberal,\nif I did no one any service except in order that he might in turn do a\nservice to me, I should never bestow a benefit upon one who was setting\nout for distant and foreign countries, never to return; I should not\nbestow a benefit upon one who was so ill as to be past hope of recovery,\nnor should I do so when I myself was failing, because I should not live\nlong enough to receive any return. Yet, that you may know that to do\ngood is desirable in itself, we afford help to strangers who put into\nour harbour only to leave it straightway; we give a ship and fit it out\nfor a shipwrecked stranger to sail back in to his own country. He leaves\nus hardly knowing who it was who saved him, and, as he will never return\nto our presence, he hands over his debt of gratitude to the gods, and\nbeseeches them to fulfil it for him: in the meanwhile we rejoice in the\nbarren knowledge that we have done a good action. What? when we stand\nupon the extreme verge of life, and make our wills, do we not assign to\nothers benefits from which we ourselves shall receive no advantage? How\nmuch time we waste, how long we consider in secret how much property we\nare to leave, and to whom! What then? does it make any difference to us\nto whom we leave our property, seeing that we cannot expect any return\nfrom any one? Yet we never give anything with more care, we never take\nsuch pains in deciding upon our verdict, as when, without any views of\npersonal advantage, we think only of what is honourable, for we are bad\njudges of our duty as long as our view of it is distorted by hope and\nfear, and that most indolent of vices, pleasure: but when death has shut\noff all these, and brought us as incorrupt judges to pronounce sentence,\nwe seek for the most worthy men to leave our property to, and we never\ntake more scrupulous care than in deciding what is to be done with what\ndoes not concern us. Yet, by Hercules, then there steals over us a\ngreat satisfaction as we think, \"I shall make this man richer, and by\nbestowing wealth upon that man I shall add lustre to his high position.\"\nIndeed, if we never give without expecting some return, we must all die\nwithout making our wills.\nXII. It may be said, \"You define a benefit as a loan which cannot be\nrepaid: now a loan is not a desirable thing in itself.\" When we speak of\na loan, we make use of a figure, or comparison, just as we speak of law\nas; the standard of right and wrong, although a standard is not a thing\nto be desired for its own sake. I have adopted this phrase in order to\nillustrate my subject: when I speak of a loan, I must be understood to\nmean something resembling a loan. Do you wish to know how it differs\nfrom one? I add the words \"which cannot be repaid,\" whereas every loan\nboth can and ought to be repaid. It is so far from being right to bestow\na benefit for one's own advantage, that often, as I have explained, it\nis one's duty to bestow it when it involves one's own loss and risk: for\ninstance, if I assist a man when beset by robbers, so that he gets away\nfrom them safely, or help some victim of power, and bring upon myself\nthe party spite of a body of influential men, very, probably incurring\nmyself the same disgrace from which I saved him, although I might have\ntaken the other side, and looked on with safety at struggles with\nwhich I have nothing to do: if I were to give bail for one who has been\ncondemned, and when my friend's goods were advertised for sale I were\nto give a bond to the effect that I would make restitution to the\ncreditors, if, in order to save a proscribed person I myself run the\nrisk of being proscribed. No one, when about to buy a villa at Tusculum\nor Tibur, for a summer retreat, because of the health of the locality,\nconsiders how many years' purchase he gives for it; this must be looked\nto by the man who makes a profit by it. The same is true with benefits;\nwhen you ask what return I get for them, I answer, the consciousness\nof a good action. \"What return does one get for benefits?\" Pray tell\nme what return one gets for righteousness, innocence, magnanimity,\nchastity, temperance? If you wish for anything beyond these virtues, you\ndo not wish for the virtues themselves. For what does the order of the\nuniverse bring round the seasons? for what does the sun make the day\nnow longer and now shorter? all these things are benefits, for they take\nplace for our good. As it is the duty of the universe to maintain the\nround of the seasons, as it is the duty of the sun to vary the points of\nhis rising and setting, and to do all these things by which we profit,\nwithout any reward, so is it the duty of man, amongst other things, to\nbestow benefits. Wherefore then does he give? He gives for fear that\nhe should not give, lest he might lose an opportunity of doing a good\naction.\nXIII. You Epicureans take pleasure in making a study of dull torpidity,\nin seeking for a repose which differs little from sound sleep, in\nlurking beneath the thickest shade, in amusing with the feeblest\npossible trains of thought that sluggish condition of your languid minds\nwhich you term tranquil contemplation, and in stuffing with food and\ndrink, in the recesses of your gardens, your bodies which are pallid\nwith want of exercise; we Stoics, on the other hand, take pleasure in\nbestowing benefits, even though they cost us labour, provided that they\nlighten the labours of others; though they lead us into danger, provided\nthat they save others, though they straiten our means, if they alleviate\nthe poverty and distresses of others. What difference does it make to me\nwhether I receive benefits or not? even if I receive them, it is still\nmy duty to bestow them. A benefit has in view the advantage of him\nupon whom we bestow it, not our own; otherwise we merely bestow it upon\nourselves. Many things, therefore, which are of the greatest possible\nuse to others lose all claim to gratitude by being paid for. Merchants\nare of use to cities, physicians to invalids, dealers to slaves; yet all\nthese have no claim to the gratitude of those whom they benefit, because\nthey seek their own advantage through that of others. That which is\nbestowed with a view to profit is not a benefit. \"I will give this in\norder that I may get a return for it\" is the language of a broker.\nXIV. I should not call a woman modest, if she rebuffed her lover in\norder to increase his passion, or because she feared the law or her\nhusband; as Ovid says:\n\"She that denies, because she does not dare\nTo yield, in spirit grants her lover's prayer.\"\nIndeed, the woman who owes her chastity, not to her own virtue, but to\nfear, may rightly be classed as a sinner. In the same manner, he who\nmerely gave in order that he might receive, cannot be said to have\ngiven. Pray, do we bestow benefits upon animals when we feed them for\nour use or for our table? do we bestow benefits upon trees when we tend\nthem that they may not suffer from drought or from hardness of ground?\nNo one is moved by righteousness and goodness of heart to cultivate an\nestate, or to do any act in which the reward is something apart from the\nact itself; but he is moved to bestow benefits, not by low and grasping\nmotives, but by a kind and generous mind, which even after it has given\nis willing to give again, to renew its former bounties by fresh ones,\nwhich thinks only of how much good it can do the man to whom it gives;\nwhereas to do any one a service because it is our interest to do so is a\nmean action, which deserves no praise, no credit. What grandeur is there\nin loving oneself, sparing oneself, gaining profit for oneself? The true\nlove of giving calls us away from all this, forcibly leads us to put up\nwith loss, and foregoes its own interest, deriving its greatest pleasure\nfrom the mere act of doing good.\nXV. Can we doubt that the converse of a benefit is an injury? As the\ninfliction of injuries is a thing to be avoided, so is the bestowal of\nbenefits to be desired for its own sake. In the former, the disgrace of\ncrime outweighs all the advantages which incite us to commit it; while\nwe are urged to the latter course by the appearance of honour, in itself\na powerful incentive to action, which attends it.\nI should not lie if I were to affirm that every one takes pleasure in\nthe benefits which he has bestowed, that everyone loves best to see the\nman whom he has most largely benefited. Who does not thinks that to have\nbestowed one benefit is a reason for bestowing a second? and would this\nbe so, if the act of giving did not itself give us pleasure? How often\nyou may hear a man say, \"I cannot bear to desert one whose life I have\npreserved, whom I have saved from danger. True, he asks me to plead his\ncause against men of great influence. I do not wish to do so, yet what\nam I to do? I have already helped him once, nay twice.\" Do you not\nperceive how very powerful this instinct must be, if it leads us to\nbestow benefits first because it is right to do so, and afterwards\nbecause we have already bestowed somewhat? Though at the outset a man\nmay have had no claim upon us, we yet continue to give to him because we\nhave already given to him. So untrue is it that we are urged to bestow\nbenefits by our own interest, that even when our benefits prove failures\nwe continue to nurse them and encourage them out of sheer love of\nbenefiting, which has a natural weakness even for what has been\nill-bestowed, like that which we feel for our vicious children.\nXVI. These same adversaries of ours admit that they are grateful, yet\nnot because it is honourable, but because it is profitable to be so.\nThis can be proved to be untrue all the more easily, because it can be\nestablished by the same arguments by which we have established that to\nbestow a benefit is desirable for its own sake. All our arguments start\nfrom this settled point, that honour is pursued for no reason except\nbecause it is honour. Now, who will venture to raise the question\nwhether it be honourable to be grateful? who does not loathe the\nungrateful man, useless as he is even to himself? How do you feel when\nany one is spoken of as being ungrateful for great benefits conferred\nupon him by a friend? Is it as though he had done something base, or had\nmerely neglected to do something useful and likely to be profitable to\nhimself? I imagine that you think him a bad man, and one who deserves\npunishment, not one who needs a guardian; and this would not be the\ncase, unless gratitude were desirable in itself and honourable. Other\nqualities, it may be, manifest their importance less clearly, and\nrequire an explanation to prove whether they be honourable or no; this\nis openly proved to be so in the sight of all, and is too beautiful for\nanything to obscure or dim its glory. What is more praiseworthy, upon\nwhat are all men more universally agreed, than to return gratitude for\ngood offices?\nXVII. Pray tell me, what is it that urges us to do so? Is it profit?\nWhy, unless a man despises profit, he is not grateful. Is it ambition?\nwhy, what is there to boast of in having paid what you owe? Is it\nfear? The ungrateful man feels none, for against this one crime we\nhave provided no law, as though nature had taken sufficient precautions\nagainst it. Just as there is no law which bids parents love and indulge\ntheir children, seeing that it is superfluous to force us into the\npath which we naturally take, just as no one needs to be urged to love\nhimself, since self-love begins to act upon him as soon as he is born,\nso there is no law bidding us to seek that which is honourable\nin itself; for such things please us by their very nature, and so\nattractive is virtue that the disposition even of bad men leads them to\napprove of good rather than of evil. Who is there who does not wish\nto appear beneficent, who does not even when steeped in crime and\nwrong-doing strive after the appearance of goodness, does not put some\nshow of justice upon even his most intemperate acts, and endeavour to\nseem to have conferred a benefit even upon those whom he has injured?\nConsequently, men allow themselves to be thanked by those whom they have\nruined, and pretend to be good and generous, because they cannot prove\nthemselves so; and this they never would do were it not that a love\nof honour for its own sake forces them to seek a reputation quite at\nvariance with their real character, and to conceal their baseness, a\nquality whose fruits we covet, though we regard it itself with dislike\nand shame. No one has ever so far rebelled against the laws of nature\nand put off human feeling as to act basely for mere amusement. Ask any\nof those who live by robbery whether he would not rather obtain what\nhe steals and plunders by honest means; the man whose trade is highway\nrobbery and the murder of travellers would rather find his booty than\ntake it by force; you will find no one who would not prefer to enjoy the\nfruits of wickedness without acting wickedly. Nature bestows upon us all\nthis immense advantage, that the light of virtue shines into the minds\nof all alike; even those who do not follow her, behold her.\nXVIII. A proof that gratitude is desirable for itself lies in the fact\nthat ingratitude is to be avoided for itself, because no vice more\npowerfully rends asunder and destroys the union of the human race.\nTo what do we trust for safety, if not in mutual good offices one to\nanother? It is by the interchange of benefits alone that we gain some\nmeasure of protection for our lives, and of safety against sudden\ndisasters. Taken singly, what should we be? a prey and quarry for wild\nbeasts, a luscious and easy banquet; for while all other animals have\nsufficient strength to protect themselves, and those which are born to a\nwandering solitary life are armed, man is covered by a soft skin, has no\npowerful teeth or claws with which to terrify other creatures, but weak\nand naked by himself is made strong by union.\nGod has bestowed upon him two gifts, reason and union, which raise him\nfrom weakness to the highest power; and so he, who if taken alone would\nbe inferior to every other creature, possesses supreme dominion. Union\nhas given him sovereignty over all animals; union has enabled a being\nborn upon the earth to assume power over a foreign element, and bids him\nbe lord of the sea also; it is union which has checked the inroads of\ndisease, provided supports for our old age, and given us relief from\npain; it is union which makes us strong, and to which we look for\nprotection against the caprices of fortune. Take away union, and you\nwill rend asunder the association by which the human race preserves\nits existence; yet you will take it away if you succeed in proving that\ningratitude is not to be avoided for itself, but because something is\nto be feared for it; for how many are there who can with safety be\nungrateful? In fine, I call every man ungrateful who is merely made\ngrateful by fear.\nXIX. No sane man fears the gods; for it is madness to fear what is\nbeneficial, and no man loves those whom he fears. You, Epicurus, ended\nby making God unarmed; you stripped him of all weapons, of all power,\nand, lest anyone should fear him, you banished him out of the world.\nThere is no reason why you should fear this being, cut off as he is, and\nseparated from the sight and touch of mortals by a vast and impassable\nwall; he has no power either of rewarding or of injuring us; he dwells\nalone half-way between our heaven and that of another world, without the\nsociety either of animals, of men, or of matter, avoiding the crash of\nworlds as they fall in ruins above and around him, but neither hearing\nour prayers nor interested in us. Yet you wish to seem to worship this\nbeing just as a father, with a mind, I suppose, full of gratitude; or,\nif you do not wish to seem grateful, why should you worship him, since\nyou have received no benefit from him, but have been put together\nentirely at random and by chance by those atoms and mites of yours?\n\"I worship him,\" you answer, \"because of his glorious majesty and his\nunique nature.\" Granting that you do this, you clearly do it without\nthe attraction of any reward, or any hope; there is therefore something\nwhich is desirable for itself, whose own worth attracts you, that\nis, honour. Now what is more honourable than gratitude? the means of\npractising this virtue are as extensive as life itself.\nXX. \"Yet,\" argues he, \"there is also a certain amount of profit inherent\nin this virtue.\" In what virtue is there not? But that which we speak\nof as desirable for itself is such, that although it may possess some\nattendant advantages, yet it would be desirable even if stripped of\nall these. It is profitable to be grateful; yet I will be grateful even\nthough it harm me. What is the aim of the grateful man? is it that his\ngratitude may win for him more friends and more benefits? What then? If\na man is likely to meet with affronts by showing his gratitude, if he\nknows that far from gaining anything by it, he must lose much even of\nwhat he has already acquired, will he not cheerfully act to his own\ndisadvantage? That man is ungrateful who, in returning a kindness,\nlooks forward to a second gift--who hopes while he repays. I call him\nungrateful who sits at the bedside of a sick man because he is about\nto make a will, when he is at leisure to think of inheritances and\nlegacies. Though he may do everything which a good and dutiful friend\nought to do, yet, if any hope of gain be floating in his mind, he is a\nmere legacy-hunter, and is angling for an inheritance. Like the birds\nwhich feed upon carcases, which come close to animals weakened by\ndisease, and watch till they fall, so these men are attracted by death\nand hover around a corpse.\nXXI. A grateful mind is attracted only by a sense of the beauty of its\npurpose. Do you wish to know this to be so, and that it is not bribed by\nideas of profit? There are two classes of grateful men: a man is called\ngrateful who has made some return for what he received; this man may\nvery possibly display himself in this character, he has something\nto boast of, to refer to. We also call a man grateful who receives a\nbenefit with goodwill, and owes it to his benefactor with goodwill; yet\nthis man's gratitude lies concealed within his own mind. What profit can\naccrue to him from this latent feeling? yet this man, even though he\nis not able to do anything more than this, is grateful; he loves his\nbenefactor, he feels his debt to him, he longs to repay his kindness;\nwhatever else you may find wanting, there is nothing wanting in the man.\nHe is like a workman who has not the tools necessary for the practice of\nhis craft, or like a trained singer whose voice cannot be heard through\nthe noise of those who interrupt him. I wish to repay a kindness: after\nthis there still remains something for me to do, not in order that I may\nbecome grateful, but that I may discharge my debt; for, in many cases,\nhe who returns a kindness is ungrateful for it, and he who does not\nreturn it is grateful. Like all other virtues, the whole value of\ngratitude lies in the spirit in which it is done; so, if this man's\npurpose be loyal, any shortcomings on his part are due not to himself,\nbut to fortune. A man who is silent may, nevertheless, be eloquent; his\nhands may be folded or even bound, and he may yet be strong; just as\na pilot is a pilot even when upon dry land, because his knowledge\nis complete, and there is nothing wanting to it, though there may be\nobstacles which prevent his making use of it. In the same way, a man is\ngrateful who only wishes to be so, and who has no one but himself who\ncan bear witness to his frame of mind. I will go even further than\nthis: a man sometimes is grateful when he appears to be ungrateful, when\nill-judging report has declared him to be so. Such a man can look\nto nothing but his own conscience, which can please him even when\noverwhelmed by calumny, which contradicts the mob and common rumour,\nrelies only upon itself, and though it beholds a vast crowd of the other\nway of thinking opposed to it, does not count heads, but wins by its own\nvote alone. Should it see its own good faith meet with the punishment\ndue to treachery, it will not descend from its pedestal, and will remain\nsuperior to its punishment. \"I have,\" it says, \"what I wished, what I\nstrove for. I do not regret it, nor shall I do so; nor shall fortune,\nhowever unjust she may be, ever hear me say, 'What did I want? What now\nis the use of having meant well?'\" A good conscience is of value on\nthe rack, or in the fire; though fire be applied to each of our limbs,\ngradually encircle our living bodies, and burst our heart, yet if our\nheart be filled with a good conscience, it will rejoice in the fire\nwhich will make its good faith shine before the world.\nXXII. Now let that question also which has been already stated be again\nbrought forward; Why is it that we should wish to be grateful when we\nare dying, that we should carefully weigh the various services rendered\nus by different individuals, and carefully review our whole life, that\nwe may not seem to have forgotten any kindness? Nothing then remains for\nus to hope for; yet when on the very threshold, we wish to depart\nfrom human life as full of gratitude as possible. There is in truth an\nimmense reward for this thing merely in doing it, and what is honourable\nhas great power to attract men's minds, which are overwhelmed by its\nbeauty and carried off their balance, enchanted by its brilliancy and\nsplendour. \"Yet,\" argues our adversary, \"from it many advantages take\ntheir rise, and good men obtain a safer life and love, and the good\nopinion of the better class, while their days are spent in greater\nsecurity when accompanied by innocence and gratitude.\"\nIndeed, nature would have been most unjust had she rendered this great\nblessing miserable, uncertain, and fruitless. But consider this point,\nwhether you would make your way to that virtue, to which it is generally\nsafe and easy to attain, even though the path lay over rocks and\nprecipices, and were beset with fierce beasts and venomous serpents. A\nvirtue is none the less to be desired for its own sake, because it has\nsome adventitious profit connected with it: indeed, in most cases the\nnoblest virtues are accompanied by many extraneous advantages, but it is\nthe virtues that lead the way, and these merely follow in their train.\nXXIII. Can we doubt that the climate of this abode of the human race is\nregulated by the motion of the sun and moon in their orbits? that\nour bodies are sustained, the hard earth loosened, excessive moisture\nreduced, and the surly bonds of winter broken by the heat of the one,\nand that crops are brought to ripeness by the effectual all-pervading\nwarmth of the other? that the fertility of the human race corresponds\nto the courses of the moon? that the sun by its revolution marks out\nthe year, and that the moon, moving in a smaller orbit, marks out the\nmonths? Yet, setting aside all this, would not the sun be a sight worthy\nto be contemplated and worshipped, if he did no more than rise and set?\nwould not the moon be worth looking at, even if it passed uselessly\nthrough the heavens? Whose attention is not arrested by the universe\nitself, when by night it pours forth its fires and glitters with\ninnumerable stars? Who, while he admires them, thinks of their being of\nuse to him? Look at that great company gliding over our heads, how they\nconceal their swift motion under the semblance of a fixed and immovable\nwork. How much takes place in that night which you make use of merely\nto mark and count your days! What a mass of events is being prepared in\nthat silence! What a chain of destiny their unerring path is forming!\nThose which you imagine to be merely strewn about for ornament are\nreally one and all at work. Nor is there any ground for your belief that\nonly seven stars revolve, and that the rest remain still: we understand\nthe orbits of a few, but countless divinities, further removed from\nour sight, come and go; while the greater part of those whom our sight\nreaches move in a mysterious manner and by an unknown path.\nXXIV. What then? would you not be captivated by the sight of such a\nstupendous work, even though it did not cover you, protect you, cherish\nyou, bring you into existence and penetrate you with its spirit? Though\nthese heavenly bodies are of the very first importance to us, and are,\nindeed, essential to our life, yet we can think of nothing but\ntheir glorious majesty, and similarly all virtue, especially that of\ngratitude, though it confers great advantages upon us, does not wish to\nbe loved for that reason; it has something more in it than this, and he\nwho merely reckons it among useful things does not perfectly comprehend\nit. A man, you say, is grateful because it is to his advantage to be\nso. If this be the case, then his advantage will be the measure of his\ngratitude. Virtue will not admit a covetous lover; men must approach her\nwith open purse. The ungrateful man thinks, \"I did wish to be grateful,\nbut I fear the expense and danger and insults to which I should expose\nmyself: I will rather consult my own interest.\" Men cannot be rendered\ngrateful and ungrateful by the same line of reasoning: their actions\nare as distinct as their purposes. The one is ungrateful, although it is\nwrong, because it is his interest; the other is grateful, although it is\nnot his interest, because it is right.\nXXV. It is our aim to live in harmony with the scheme of the universe,\nand to follow the example of the gods. Yet in all their acts the gods\nhave no object in view other than the act itself, unless you suppose\nthat they obtain a reward for their work in the smoke of burnt\nsacrifices and the scent of incense. See what great things they do every\nday, how much they divide amongst us, with how great crops they fill the\nearth, how they move the seas with convenient winds to carry us to all\nshores, how by the fall of sudden showers they soften the ground, renew\nthe dried-up springs of fountains, and call them into new life by\nunseen supplies of water. All this they do without reward, without any\nadvantage accruing to themselves. Let our line of conduct, if it would\nnot depart from its model, preserve this direction, and let us not act\nhonourably because we are hired to do so. We ought to feel ashamed that\nany benefit should have a price: we pay nothing for the gods.\nXXVI. \"If,\" our adversary may say, \"you wish to imitate the gods, then\nbestow benefits upon the ungrateful as well as the grateful; for the\nsun rises upon the wicked as well as the good, the seas are open even\nto pirates.\" By this question he really asks whether a good man\nwould bestow a benefit upon an ungrateful person, knowing him to be\nungrateful. Allow me here to introduce a short explanation, that we may\nnot be taken in by a deceitful question. Understand that according to\nthe system of the Stoics there are two classes of ungrateful persons.\nOne man is ungrateful because he is a fool; a fool is a bad man; a man\nwho is bad possesses every vice: therefore he is ungrateful. In the same\nway we speak of all bad men as dissolute, avaricious, luxurious, and\nspiteful, not because each man has all these vices in any great or\nremarkable degree, but because he might have them; they are in him, even\nthough they be not seen. The second form of ungrateful person is he who\nis commonly meant by the term, one who is inclined by nature to this\nvice. In the case of him who has the vice of ingratitude just as he has\nevery other, a wise man will bestow a benefit, because if he sets aside\nall such men there will be no one left for him to bestow it on. As for\nthe ungrateful man who habitually misapplies benefits and acts so by\nchoice, he will no more bestow a benefit upon him than he would lend\nmoney to a spendthrift, or place a deposit in the hands of one who had\nalready often refused to many persons to give up the property with which\nthey had entrusted him.\nXXVII. We call some men timid because they are fools: in this they\nare like the bad men who are steeped in all vices without distinction.\nStrictly speaking, we call those persons timid who are alarmed even\nat unmeaning noises. A fool possesses all vices, but he is not equally\ninclined by nature to all; one is prone to avarice, another to luxury,\nand another to insolence. Those persons, therefore, are mistaken, who\nask the Stoics, \"What do you say, then? is Achilles timid? Aristides,\nwho received a name for justice, is he unjust? Fabius, who 'by delays\nretrieved the day,' is he rash? Does Decius fear death? Is Mucius\na traitor? Camillus a betrayer?\" We do not mean that all vices are\ninherent in all men in the same way in which some especial ones are\nnoticeable in certain men, but we declare that the bad man and the fool\npossess all vices; we do not even acquit them of fear when they are\nrash, or of avarice when they are extravagant. Just as a man has all his\nsenses, yet all men have not on that account as keen a sight as Lynceus,\nso a man that is a fool has not all vices in so active and vigorous a\nform as some persons have spine of them, yet he has them all. All vices\nexist in all of them, yet all are not prominent in each individual. One\nman is naturally prone to avarice, another is the slave of wine, a third\nof lust; or, if not yet enslaved by these passions, he is so fashioned\nby nature that this is the direction in which his character would\nprobably lead him. Therefore, to return to my original proposition,\nevery bad man is ungrateful, because he has the seeds of every villainy\nin him; but he alone is rightly so called who is naturally inclined to\nthis vice. Upon such a person as this, therefore, I shall not bestow a\nbenefit. One who betrothed his daughter to an ill-tempered man from whom\nmany women had sought a divorce, would be held to have neglected her\ninterests; a man would be thought a bad father if he entrusted the care\nof his patrimony to one who had lost his own family estate, and it would\nbe the act of a madman to make a will naming as the guardian of one's\nson a man who had already defrauded other wards. So will that man be\nsaid to bestow benefits as badly as possible, who chooses ungrateful\npersons, in whose hands they will perish.\nXXVIII. \"The gods,\" it may be said, \"bestow much, even upon the\nungrateful.\" But what they bestow they had prepared for the good, and\nthe bad have their share as well, because they cannot be separated. It\nis better to benefit the bad as well, for the sake of benefiting the\ngood, than to stint the good for fear of benefiting the bad. Therefore\nthe gods have created all that you speak of, the day, the sun, the\nalternations of winter and summer, the transitions through spring and\nautumn from one extreme to the other, showers, drinking fountains, and\nregularly blowing winds for the use of all alike; they could not except\nindividuals from the enjoyment of them. A king bestows honours upon\nthose who deserve them, but he gives largesse to the undeserving as\nwell. The thief, the bearer of false witness, and the adulterer, alike\nreceive the public grant of corn, and all are placed on the register\nwithout any examination as to character; good and bad men share alike in\nall the other privileges which a man receives, because he is a citizen,\nnot because he is a good man. God likewise has bestowed certain gifts\nupon the entire human race, from which no one is shut out. Indeed, it\ncould not be arranged that the wind which was fair for good men should\nbe foul for bad ones, while it is for the good of all men that the seas\nshould be open for traffic and the kingdom of mankind be enlarged; nor\ncould any law be appointed for the showers, so that they should not fall\nupon the fields of wicked and evil men. Some things are given to all\nalike: cities are founded for good and bad men alike; works of genius\nreach, by publication, even unworthy men; medicine points out the\nmeans of health even to the wicked; no one has checked the making up of\nwholesome remedies for fear that the undeserving should be healed. You\nmust seek for examination and preference of individuals in such things\nas are bestowed separately upon those who are thought to deserve them;\nnot in these, which admit the mob to share them without distinction.\nThere is a great difference between not shutting a man out and choosing\nhim. Even a thief receives justice; even murderers enjoy the blessings\nof peace; even those who have plundered others can recover their own\nproperty; assassins and private bravoes are defended against the common\nenemy by the city wall; the laws protect even those who have sinned most\ndeeply against them. There are some things which no man could obtain\nunless they were given to all; you need not, therefore, cavil about\nthose matters in which all mankind is invited to share. As for things\nwhich men receive or not at my discretion, I shall not bestow them upon\none whom I know to be ungrateful.\nXXIX. \"Shall we, then,\" argues he, \"not give our advice to an ungrateful\nman when he is at a loss, or refuse him a drink of water when he is\nthirsty, or not show him the path when he has lost his way? or would you\ndo him these services and yet not give him anything?\" Here I will draw\na distinction, or at any rate endeavour to do so. A benefit is a useful\nservice, yet all useful service is not a benefit; for some are so\ntrifling as not to claim the title of benefits. To produce a benefit two\nconditions must concur. First, the importance of the thing given; for\nsome things fall short of the dignity of a benefit. Who ever called a\nhunch of bread a benefit, or a farthing dole tossed to a beggar, or the\nmeans of lighting a fire? yet sometimes these are of more value than the\nmost costly benefits; still their cheapness detracts from their value\neven when, by the exigency of time, they are rendered essential. The\nnext condition, which is the most important of all, must necessarily be\npresent, namely, that I should confer the benefit for the sake of him\nwhom I wish to receive it, that I should judge him worthy of it, bestow\nit of my own free will, and receive pleasure from my own gift, none\nof which conditions are present in the cases of which we have just now\nspoken; for we do not bestow such things as those upon these who are\nworthy of them, but we give them carelessly, as trifles, and do not give\nthem so much to a man as to humanity.\nXXX. I shall not deny that sometimes I would give even to the unworthy,\nout of respect for others; as, for instance, in competition for public\noffices, some of the basest of men are preferred on account of their\nnoble birth, to industrious men of no family, and that for good reasons;\nfor the memory of great virtues is sacred, and more men will take\npleasure in being good, if the respect felt for good men does not cease\nwith their lives. What made Cicero's son a consul, except his father?\nWhat lately brought Cinna [Footnote: See Seneca on \"Clemency,\" book i.,\nch. ix.] out of the camp of the enemy and raised him to the consulate?\nWhat made Sextus Pompeius and the other Pompeii consuls, unless it was\nthe greatness of one man, who once was raised so high that, by his very\nfall, he sufficiently exalted all his relatives. What lately made Fabius\nPersicus a member of more than one college of priests, though even\nprofligates avoided his kiss? Was it not Verrucosus, and Allobrogicus,\nand the three hundred who to serve their country blocked the invader's\npath with the force of a single family? It is our duty to respect the\nvirtuous, not only when present with us, but also when removed from our\nsight: as they have made it their study not to bestow their benefits\nupon one age alone, but to leave them existing after they themselves\nhave passed away, so let us not confine our gratitude to a single\nage. If a man has begotten great men, he deserves to receive benefits,\nwhatever he himself may be: he has given us worthy men. If a man\ndescends from glorious ancestors, whatever he himself may be, let him\nfind refuge under the shadow of his ancestry. As mean places are lighted\nup by the rays of the sun, so let the degenerate shine in the light of\ntheir forefathers.\nXXXI. In this place, my Liberalis, I wish to speak in defence of the\ngods. We sometimes say, \"What could Providence mean by placing an\nArrhidaeus upon the throne?\" Do you suppose that the crown was given\nto Arrhidaeus? nay, it was given to his father and his brother. Why\ndid Heaven bestow the empire of the world upon Caius Caesar, the most\nbloodthirsty of mankind, who was wont to order blood to be shed in his\npresence as freely as if he wished to drink of it? Why, do you suppose\nthat it was given to him? It was given to his father, Germanicus, to his\ngrandfather, his great grandfather, and to others before them, no less\nillustrious men, though they lived as private citizens on a footing\nof equality with others. Why, when you yourself were making Mamercus\nScaurus consul, were you ignorant of his vices? did he himself conceal\nthem? did he wish to appear decent?\nDid you admit a man who was so openly filthy to the fasces and the\ntribunal? Yes, it was because you were thinking of the great old\nScaurus, the chief of the Senate, and were unwilling that his descendant\nshould be despised.\nXXXII. It is probable that the gods act in the same manner, that they\nshow greater indulgence to some for the sake of their parents and\ntheir ancestry, and to others for the sake of their children and\ngrandchildren, and a long line of descendants beyond them; for they\nknow the whole course of their works, and have constant access to the\nknowledge of all that shall hereafter pass through their hands. These\nthings come upon us from the unknown future, and the gods have foreseen\nand are familiar with the events by which we are startled. \"Let these\nmen,\" says Providence, \"be kings, because their ancestors were good\nkings, because they regarded righteousness and temperance as the highest\nrule of life, because they did not devote the state to themselves, but\ndevoted themselves to the state. Let these others reign, because some\none of their ancestors before them was a good man, who bore a soul\nsuperior to fortune, who preferred to be conquered rather than to\nconquer in civil strife, because it was more to the advantage of\nthe state. [Footnote: Gertz, \"Stud. Crit,\" p. 159, note.] It was not\npossible to make a sufficient return to him for this during so long a\ntime; let this other, therefore, out of regard for him, be chief of the\npeople, not because he knows how, or is capable, but because the other\nhas earned it for him. This man is misshapen, loathsome to look upon,\nand will disgrace the insignia of his office. Men will presently blame\nme, calling me blind and reckless, not knowing upon whom I am conferring\nwhat ought to be given to the greatest and noblest of men; but I know\nthat, in giving this dignity to one man, I am paying an old debt to\nanother. How should the men of to-day know that ancient hero, who so\nresolutely avoided the glory which pressed upon him, who went into\ndanger with the same look which other men wear when they have escaped\nfrom danger, who never regarded his own interest as apart from that\nof the commonwealth?\" \"Where,\" you ask, \"or who is he? whence does\nhe come?\" \"You know him not; it lies with me to balance the debit and\ncredit account in such cases as these; I know how much I owe to each\nman; I repay some after a long interval, others beforehand, according\nas my opportunities and the exigencies of my social system permit.\"\nI shall, therefore, sometimes bestow somewhat upon an ungrateful man,\nthough not for his own sake.\nXXXIII. \"What,\" argues he, \"if you do not know whether your man be\nungrateful or grateful--will you wait until you know, or will you\nnot lose the opportunity of bestowing a benefit? To wait is a long\nbusiness--for, as Plato says, it is hard to form an opinion about the\nhuman mind,--not to wait, is rash.\" To this objector we shall answer,\nthat we never should wait for absolute knowledge of the whole case,\nsince the discovery of truth is an arduous task, but should proceed\nin the direction in which truth appeared to direct us. All our actions\nproceed in this direction: it is thus that we sow seed, that we sail\nupon the sea, that we serve in the army, marry, and bring up children.\nThe result of all these actions is uncertain, so we take that course\nfrom which we believe that good results may be hoped for. Who can\nguarantee a harvest to the sower, a harbour to the sailor, victory\nto the soldier, a modest wife to the husband, dutiful children to the\nfather? We proceed in the way in which reason, not absolute truth,\ndirects us. Wait, do nothing that will not turn out well, form no\nopinion until you have searched but the truth, and your life will pass\nin absolute in action. Since it is only the appearance of truth, not\ntruth itself, which leads me hither or thither, I shall confer benefits\nupon the man who apparently will be grateful.\nXXXIV. \"Many circumstances,\" argues he, \"may arise which may enable a\nbad man to steal into the place of a good one, or may cause a good man\nto be disliked as though he were a bad one; for appearances, to which\nwe trust, are deceptive.\" Who denies it? Yet I can find nothing else by\nwhich to guide my opinion. I must follow these tracks in my search after\ntruth, for I have none more trustworthy than these; I will take pains\nto weigh the value of these with all possible care, and will not hastily\ngive my assent to them. For instance, in a battle, it may happen that my\nhand may be deceived by some mistake into turning my weapon against my\ncomrade, and sparing my enemy as though he were on my side; but this\nwill not often take place, and will not take place through any fault of\nmine, for my object is to strike the enemy, and defend my countryman.\nIf I know a man to be ungrateful, I shall not bestow a benefit upon him.\nBut the man has passed himself off as a good man by some trick, and has\nimposed upon me. Well, this is not at all the fault of the giver, who\ngave under the impression that his friend was grateful. \"Suppose,\" asks\nhe, \"that you were to promise to bestow a benefit, and afterwards were\nto learn that your man was ungrateful, would you bestow it or not? If\nyou do, you do wrong knowingly, for you give to one to whom you ought\nnot; if you refuse, you do wrong likewise, for you do not give to him to\nwhom you promised to give. This case upsets your consistency, and that\nproud assurance of yours that the wise man never regrets his actions,\nor amends what he has done, or alters his plans.\" The wise man never\nchanges his plans while the conditions under which he formed them remain\nthe same; therefore, he never feels regret, because at the time nothing\nbetter than what he did could have been done, nor could any better\ndecision have been arrived at than that which was made; yet he begins\neverything with the saving clause, \"If nothing shall occur to the\ncontrary.\" This is the reason why we say that all goes well with him,\nand that nothing happens contrary to his expectation, because he\nbears in mind the possibility of something happening to prevent the\nrealization of his projects. It is an imprudent confidence to trust that\nfortune will be on our side. The wise man considers both sides: he knows\nhow great is the power of errors, how uncertain human affairs are, how\nmany obstacles there are to the success of plans. Without committing\nhimself, he awaits the doubtful and capricious issue of events, and\nweighs certainty of purpose against uncertainty of result. Here also,\nhowever, he is protected by that saving clause, without which he decides\nupon nothing, and begins nothing.\nXXXV. When I promise to bestow a benefit, I promise it, unless something\noccurs which makes it my duty not to do so. What if, for example, my\ncountry orders me to give to her what I had promised to my friend? or if\na law be passed forbidding any one to do what I had promised to do for\nhim? Suppose that I have promised you my daughter in marriage, that\nthen you turn out to be a foreigner, and that I have no right of\nintermarriage with foreigners; in this case, the law, by which I\nam forbidden to fulfil my promise, forms my defence. I shall be\ntreacherous, and hear myself blamed for inconsistency, only if I do not\nfulfil, my promise when all conditions remain the same as when I made\nit; otherwise, any change makes me free to reconsider the entire case,\nand absolves me from my promise. I may have promised to plead a cause;\nafterwards it appears that this cause is designed to form a precedent\nfor an attack upon my father. I may have promised to leave my country,\nand travel abroad; then news comes that the road is beset with robbers.\nI was going to an appointment at some particular place; but my son's\nillness, or my wife's confinement, prevented me. All conditions must be\nthe same as they were when I made the promise, if you mean to hold me\nbound in honour to fulfil it. Now what greater change can take place\nthan that I should discover you to be a bad and ungrateful man? I\nshall refuse to an unworthy man that which I had intended to give him\nsupposing him to be worthy, and I shall also have reason to be angry\nwith him for the trick which he has put upon me.\nXXXVI. I shall nevertheless look into the matter, and consider what the\nvalue of the thing promised may be. If it be trifling, I shall give it,\nnot because you are worthy of it, but because I promised it, and I shall\nnot give it as a present, but merely in order to make good my words\nand give myself a twitch of the ear. I will punish my own rashness in\npromising by the loss of what I gave. \"See how grieved you are; mind you\ntake more care what you say in future.\" As the saying is, I will take\ntongue money from you. If the matter be important, I will not, as\nMaecenas said, let ten million sesterces reproach me. I will weigh the\ntwo sides of the question one against the other: there is something in\nabiding by what you have promised; on the other hand, there is a great\ndeal in not bestowing a benefit upon one who is unworthy of it. Now, how\ngreat is this benefit? If it is a trifling one, let us wink and let it\npass; but if it will cause me much loss or much shame to give it, I had\nrather excuse myself once for refusing it than have to do so ever after\nfor giving it. The whole point, I repeat, depends upon how much the\nthing given is worth: let the terms of my promise be appraised. Not only\nshall I refuse to give what I may have promised rashly, but I shall also\ndemand back again what I may have wrongly bestowed: a man must be mad\nwho keeps a promise made under a mistake.\nXXXVII. Philip, king of the Macedonians, had a hardy soldier whose\nservices he had found useful in many campaigns. From time to time he\nmade this man presents of part of the plunder as the reward of his\nvalour, and used to excite his greedy spirit by his frequent gifts. This\nman was cast by shipwreck upon the estate of a certain Macedonian,\nwho as soon as he heard the news hastened to him, restored his breath,\nremoved him to his own farmhouse, gave up his own bed to him, nursed him\nout of his weakened and half-dead condition, took care of him at his own\nexpense for thirty days, restored him to health and gave him a sum of\nmoney for his journey, as the man kept constantly saying, \"If only I\ncan see my chief, I will repay your kindness.\" He told Philip of his\nshipwreck, said nothing about the help which he had received, and at\nonce demanded that a certain man's estate should be given to him.\nThe man was a friend of his: it was that very man by whom he had been\nrescued and restored to health. Sometimes, especially in time of war,\nkings bestow many gifts with their eyes shut. One just man cannot deal\nwith such a mass of armed selfishness. It is not possible for any one\nto be at the same time a good man and a good general. How are so many\nthousands of insatiable men to be satiated? What would they have,\nif every man had his own? Thus Philip reasoned with himself while he\nordered the man to be put in possession of the property which he asked\nfor. However, the other, when driven out of his estate, did not, like a\npeasant, endure his wrongs in silence, thankful that he himself was not\ngiven away also, but sent a sharp and outspoken letter to Philip, who,\non reading it, was so much enraged that he straightway ordered Pausanias\nto restore the property to its former owner, and to brand that\nwickedest of soldiers, that most ungrateful of guests, that greediest\nof shipwrecked men, with letters bearing witness to his ingratitude. He,\nindeed, deserved to have the letters not merely branded but carved in\nhis flesh, for having reduced his host to the condition in which he\nhimself had been when he lay naked and shipwrecked upon the beach;\nstill, let us see within what limits one ought to keep in punishing him.\nOf course what he had so villainously seized ought to be taken from him.\nBut who would be affected by the spectacle of his punishment? The crime\nwhich he had committed would prevent his being pitied even by any humane\nperson.\nXXXVIII. Will Philip then give you a thing because he has promised to\ngive it, even though he ought not to do so, even though he will commit\na wrong by doing so, nay, a crime, even though by this one act he will\nmake it impossible for shipwrecked men to reach the shore? There is no\ninconsistency in giving up an intention which we have discovered to\nbe wrong and have condemned as wrong; we ought candidly to admit, \"I\nthought that it was something different; I have been deceived.\" It is\nmere pride and folly to persist, \"what I once have said, be it what\nit may, shall remain unaltered and settled.\" There is no disgrace in\naltering one's plans according to circumstances. Now, if Philip had\nleft this man in possession of that seashore which he obtained by\nhis shipwreck, would he not have practically pronounced sentence of\nbanishment against all unfortunates for the future? \"Rather,\" says\nPhilip, \"do thou carry upon thy forehead of brass those letters, that\nthey may be impressed upon the eyes of all throughout my kingdom. Go,\nlet men see how sacred a thing is the table of hospitality; show them\nyour face, that upon it they may read the decree which prevents its\nbeing a capital crime to give refuge to the unfortunate under one's\nroof. The order will be more certainly respected by this means than if I\nhad inscribed it upon tablets of brass.\"\nXXXIX. \"Why then,\" argues our adversary, \"did your Stoic philosopher\nZeno, when he had promised a loan of five hundred denarii to some\nperson, whom he afterwards discovered to be of doubtful character,\npersist in lending it, because of his promise, though his friends\ndissuaded him from doing so?\" In the first place a loan is on a\ndifferent footing to a benefit. Even when we have lent money to an\nundesirable person we can recall it; I can demand payment upon a certain\nday, and if he becomes bankrupt, I can obtain my share of his property;\nbut a benefit is lost utterly and instantly. Besides, the one is the act\nof a bad man, the other that of a bad father of a family. In the next\nplace, if the sum had been a larger one, not even Zeno would have\npersisted in lending it. It was five hundred denarii; the sort of sum of\nwhich one says, \"May he spend it in sickness,\" and it was worth paying\nso much to avoid breaking his promise. I shall go out to supper, even\nthough the weather be cold, because I have promised to go; but I shall\nnot if snow be falling. I shall leave my bed to go to a betrothal feast,\nalthough I may be suffering from indigestion; but I shall not do so if I\nam feverish. I will become bail for you, because I promised; but not if\nyou wish me to become bail in some transaction of uncertain issue, if\nyou expose me to forfeiting my money to the state. There runs through\nall these cases, I argue, an implied exception; if I am able, provided\nit is right for me to do so, if these things be so and so. Make the\nposition the same when you ask me to fulfil my promise, as it was when\nI gave it, and it will be mere fickleness to disappoint you; but if\nsomething new has taken place in the meanwhile, why should you wonder at\nmy intentions being changed when the conditions under which I gave the\npromise are changed? Put everything back as it was, and I shall be the\nsame as I was. We enter into recognizances to appear, yet if we fail to\ndo so an action will not in all cases lie against us, for we are excused\nfor making default if forced to do so by a power which we cannot resist.\nXL. You may take the same answer to the question as to whether we ought\nin all cases to show gratitude for kindness, and whether a benefit ought\nin all cases to be repaid. It is my duty to show a grateful mind, but\nin some cases my own poverty, in others the prosperity of the friend\nto whom I owe some return, will not permit me to give it. What, for\ninstance, am I, a poor man, to give to a king or a rich man in return\nfor his kindness, especially as some men regard it as a wrong to have\ntheir benefits repaid, and are wont to pile one benefit upon another? In\ndealing with such persons, what more can I do than wish to repay them?\nYet I ought not to refuse to receive a new benefit, because I have not\nrepaid the former one. I shall take it as freely as it is given, and\nwill offer myself to my friend as a wide field for the exercise of\nhis good nature: he who is unwilling to receive new benefits must be\ndissatisfied with what he has already received. Do you say, \"I shall\nnot be able to return them?\" What is that to the purpose? I am willing\nenough to do so if opportunity or means were given me. He gave it to me,\nof course, having both opportunity and means: is he a good man or a bad\none? if he is a good man, I have a good case against him, and I will\nnot plead if he be a bad one. Neither do I think it right to insist on\nmaking repayment, even though it be against the will of those whom we\nrepay, and to press it upon them however reluctant they may be; it is\nnot repayment to force an unwilling man to resume what you were once\nwilling to take. Some people, if any trifling present be sent to them,\nafterwards send back something else for no particular reason, and then\ndeclare that they are under no obligation; to send something back at\nonce, and balance one present by another, is the next thing to refusing\nto receive it. On some occasions I shall not return a benefit, even\nthough I be able to do so. When? When by so doing I shall myself lose\nmore than he will gain, or if he would not notice any advantage to\nhimself in receiving that which it would be a great loss to me to\nreturn. The man who is always eager to repay under all circumstances,\nhas not the feeling of a grateful man, but of a debtor; and, to put\nit shortly, he who is too eager to repay, is unwilling to be in his\nfriend's debt; he who is unwilling, and yet is in his friend's debt, is\nungrateful.\nBOOK V.\nI.\nIn the preceding books I seem to have accomplished the object which I\nproposed to myself, since in them I have discussed how a benefit ought\nto be bestowed, and how it ought to be received. These are the limits of\nthis action; when I dwell upon it further I am not obeying the orders,\nbut the caprices of my subject which ought to be followed whither it\nleads, not whither it allures us to wander; for now and then something\nwill arise, which, although it is all but unconnected with the subject,\ninstead of being a necessary part of it, still thrills the mind with a\ncertain charm. However, since you wish it to be so, let us go on, after\nhaving completed our discussion of the heads of the subject itself,\nto investigate those matters which, if you wish for truth, I must\ncall adjacent to it, not actually connected with it; to examine which\ncarefully is not one worth one's while, and yet is not labour in vain.\nNo praise, however, which I can give to benefits does justice to\nyou, Aebutius Liberalis, a man of excellent disposition and naturally\ninclined to bestow them. Never have I seen any one esteem even the most\ntrifling services more kindly; indeed, your good-nature goes so far\nas to regard whatever benefit is bestowed upon anyone as bestowed upon\nyourself; you are prepared to pay even what is owed by the ungrateful,\nthat no one may regret having bestowed benefits. You yourself are so far\nfrom any boastfulness, you are so eager at once to free those whom you\nserve from any feeling of obligation to you, that you like, when giving\nanything to any one, to seem not so much to be giving a present as\nreturning one; and therefore what you give in this manner will all the\nmore fully he repaid to you: for, as a rule, benefits come to one who\ndoes not demand repayment of them; and just as glory follows those who\navoid it, so men receive a more plentiful harvest in return for benefits\nbestowed upon those who had it in their power to be ungrateful. With you\nthere is no reason why those who have received benefits from you should\nnot ask for fresh ones; nor would you refuse to bestow others, to\noverlook and conceal what you have given, and to add to it more and\ngreater gifts, since it is the aim of all the best men and the noblest\ndispositions to bear with an ungrateful man until you make him grateful.\nBe not deceived in pursuing this plan; vice, if you do not too soon\nbegin to hate it, will yield to virtue.\nII. Thus it is that you are especially pleased with what you think the\ngrandly-sounding phrase, \"It is disgraceful to be worsted in a contest\nof benefits.\" Whether this be true or not deserves to be investigated,\nand it means something quite different from what you imagine; for it is\nnever disgraceful to be worsted in any honourable contest, provided that\nyou do not throw down your arms, and that even when conquered you\nwish to conquer. All men do not strive for a good object with the same\nstrength, resources, and good fortune, upon which depend at all events\nthe issues of the most admirable projects, though we ought to praise the\nwill itself which makes an effort in the right direction. Even though\nanother passes it by with swifter pace, yet the palm of victory does\nnot, as in publicly-exhibited races, declare which is the better man;\nthough even in the games chance frequently brings an inferior man to the\nfront. As far as loyalty of feeling goes, which each man wishes to be\npossessed in the fullest measure on his own side, if one of the two be\nthe more powerful, if he have at his disposal all the resources which he\nwishes to use, and be favoured by fortune in his most ambitious efforts,\nwhile the other, although equally willing, can only return less than he\nreceives, or perhaps can make no return at all, but still wishes to do\nso and is entirely devoted to this object; then the latter is no more\nconquered than he who dies in arms, whom the enemy found it easier to\nslay than to turn back. To be conquered, which you consider disgraceful,\ncannot happen to a good man; for he will never surrender, never give up\nthe contest, to the last day of his life he will stand prepared and in\nthat posture he will die, testifying that though he has received much,\nyet that he had the will to repay as much as he had received.\nIII. The Lacedaemonians forbid their young men to contend in the\npancratium, or with the caestus, in which games the defeated party has\nto acknowledge himself beaten. The winner of a race is he who first\nreaches the goal; he outstrips the others in swiftness, but not in\ncourage. The wrestler who has been thrown three times loses the palm of\nvictory, but does not yield it up. Since the Lacedaemonians thought it\nof great importance that their countrymen should be invincible, they\nkept them away from those contests in which victory is assigned, not by\nthe judge, or by the issue of the contest itself, but by the voice\nof the vanquished begging the victor to spare him as he falls. This\nattribute of never being conquered, which they so jealously guard among\ntheir citizens, can be attained by all men through virtue and goodwill,\nbecause even when all else is vanquished, the mind remains unconquered.\nFor this cause no one speaks of the three hundred Fabii as conquered,\nbut slaughtered. Regulus was taken captive by the Carthaginians, not\nconquered; and so were all other men who have not yielded in spirit when\noverwhelmed by the strength and weight of angry fortune.\nSo is it with benefits. A man may have received more than he gave, more\nvaluable ones, more frequently bestowed; yet is he not vanquished. It\nmay be that, if you compare the benefits with one another, those which\nhe has received will outweigh those which he has bestowed; but if you\ncompare the giver and the receiver, whose intentions also ought to be\nconsidered apart, neither will prove the victor. It often happens that\neven when one combatant is pierced with many wounds, while the other is\nonly slightly injured, yet they are said to have fought a drawn battle,\nalthough the former may appear to be the worse man.\nIV. No one, therefore, can be conquered in a contest of benefits, if he\nknows how to owe a debt, if he wishes to make a return for what he\nhas received, and raises himself to the same level with his friend in\nspirit, though he cannot do so in material gifts. As long as he remains\nin this temper of mind, as long as he has the wish to declare by proofs\nthat he has a grateful mind, what difference does it make upon which\nside we can count the greater number of presents? You are able to give\nmuch; I can do nothing but receive. Fortune abides with you, goodwill\nalone with me; yet I am as much on an equality with you as naked or\nlightly armed men are with a large body armed to the teeth. No one,\ntherefore, is worsted by benefits, because each man's gratitude is to be\nmeasured by his will. If it be disgraceful to be worsted in a contest\nof benefits, you ought not to receive a benefit from very powerful men\nwhose kindness you cannot return, I mean such as princes and kings, whom\nfortune has placed in such a station that they can give away much, and\ncan only receive very little and quite inadequate returns for what they\ngive. I have spoken of kings and princes, who alone can cause works to\nbe accomplished, and whose superlative power depends upon the obedience\nand services of inferiors; but some there are, free from all earthly\nlusts, who are scarcely affected by any human objects of desire, upon\nwhom fortune herself could bestow nothing. I must be worsted in a\ncontest of benefits with Socrates, or with Diogenes, who walked naked\nthrough the treasures of Macedonia, treading the king's wealth under his\nfeet. In good sooth, he must then rightly have seemed, both to himself\nand to all others whose eyes were keen enough to perceive the real\ntruth, to be superior even to him at whose feet all the world lay.\nHe was far more powerful, far richer even than Alexander, who then\npossessed everything; for there was more that Diogenes could refuse to\nreceive than that Alexander was able to give.\nV. It is not disgraceful to be worsted by these men, for I am not the\nless brave because you pit me against an invulnerable enemy, nor does\nfire not burn because you throw into it something over which flames have\nno power, nor does iron lose its power of cutting, though you may wish\nto cut up a stone which is hard, impervious to blows, and of such a\nnature that hard tools are blunted upon it. I give you the same answer\nabout gratitude. A man is not disgracefully worsted in a contest of\nbenefits if he lays himself under an obligation to such persons\nas these, whose enormous wealth or admirable virtue shut out all\npossibility of their benefits being returned. As a rule we are worsted\nby our parents; for while we have them with us, we regard them as\nsevere, and do not understand what they do for us. When our age begins\nto bring us a little sense, and we gradually perceive that they deserve\nour love for those very things which used to prevent our loving them,\ntheir advice, their punishments, and the careful watch which they used\nto keep over our youthful recklessness, they are taken from us. Few live\nto reap any real fruit from children; most men feel their sons only as\na burden. Yet there is no disgrace in being worsted by one's parent\nin bestowing benefits; how should there be, seeing that there is no\ndisgrace in being worsted by anyone. We are equal to some men, and yet\nnot equal; equal in intention, which is all that they care for, which\nis all that we promise to be, but unequal in fortune. And if fortune\nprevents any one from repaying a kindness, he need not, therefore,\nblush, as though he were vanquished; there is no disgrace in failing\nto reach your object, provided you attempt to reach it. It often is\nnecessary, that before making any return for the benefits which we have\nreceived, we should ask for new ones; yet, if so, we shall not refrain\nfrom asking for them, nor shall we do so as though disgraced by so\ndoing, because, even if we do not repay the debt, we shall owe it;\nbecause, even if something from without befalls us to prevent our\nrepaying it, it will not be our fault if we are not grateful. We can\nneither be conquered in intention, nor can we be disgraced by yielding\nto what is beyond our strength to contend with.\nVI. Alexander, the king of the Macedonians, used to boast that he had\nnever been worsted by anybody in a contest of benefits. If so, it was\nno reason why, in the fulness of his pride, he should despise the\nMacedonians, Greeks, Carians, Persians, and other tribes of whom his\narmy was composed, nor need he imagine that it was this that gave him an\nempire reaching from a corner of Thrace to the shore of the unknown\nsea. Socrates could make the same boast, and so could Diogenes, by whom\nAlexander was certainly surpassed; for was he not surpassed on the day\nwhen, swelling as he was beyond the limits of merely human pride,\nhe beheld one to whom he could give nothing, from whom he could take\nnothing? King Archelaus invited Socrates to come to him. Socrates is\nreported to have answered that he should be sorry to go to one who would\nbestow benefits upon him, since he should not be able to make him an\nadequate return for them. In the first place, Socrates was at liberty\nnot to receive them; next, Socrates himself would have been the first\nto bestow a benefit, for he would have come when invited, and would have\ngiven to Archelaus that for which Archelaus could have made no return to\nSocrates. Even if Archelaus were to give Socrates gold and silver, if\nhe learned in return for them to despise gold and silver, would not\nSocrates be able to repay Archelaus? Could Socrates receive from him\nas much value as he gave, in displaying to him a man skilled in the\nknowledge of life and of death, comprehending the true purpose of each?\nSuppose that he had found this king, as it were, groping his way in the\nclear sunlight, and had taught him the secrets of nature, of which he\nwas so ignorant, that when there was an eclipse of the sun, he up his\npalace, and shaved his son's head, [Footnote: Gertz very reasonably\nconjectures that he shaved his own head which reading would require a\nvery trifling alteration of the text.] which men are wont to do in times\nof mourning and distress. What a benefit it would have been if he had\ndragged the terror-stricken king out of his hiding-place, and bidden him\nbe of good cheer, saying, \"This is not a disappearance of the sun, but a\nconjunction of two heavenly bodies; for the moon, which proceeds along\na lower path, has placed her disk beneath the sun, and hidden it by the\ninterposition of her own mass. Sometimes she only hides a small portion\nof the sun's disk, because she only grazes it in passing; sometimes\nshe hides more, by placing more of herself before it; and sometimes she\nshuts it out from our sight altogether, if she passes in an exactly even\ncourse between the sun and the earth. Soon, however, their own swift\nmotion will draw these two bodies apart; soon the earth will receive\nback again the light of day. And this system will continue throughout\ncenturies, having certain days, known beforehand, upon which the sun\ncannot display all rays, because of the intervention of the moon. Wait\nonly for a short time; he will soon emerge, he will soon leave that\nseeming cloud, and freely shed abroad his light without any hindrances.\"\nCould Socrates not have made an adequate return to Archelaus, if he\nhad taught him to reign? as though Socrates would not benefit him\nsufficiently, merely by enabling him to bestow a benefit upon Socrates.\nWhy, then, did Socrates say this? Being a joker and a speaker in\nparables--a man who turned all, especially the great, into ridicule--he\npreferred giving him a satirical refusal, rather than an obstinate or\nhaughty one, and therefore said that he did not wish to receive benefits\nfrom one to whom he could not return as much as he received. He feared,\nperhaps, that he might be forced to receive something which he did\nnot wish, he feared that it might be something unfit for Socrates to\nreceive. Some one may say, \"He ought to have said that he did not wish\nto go.\" But by so doing he would have excited against himself the anger\nof an arrogant king, who wished everything connected with himself to be\nhighly valued. It makes no difference to a king whether you be unwilling\nto give anything to him or to accept anything from him; he is equally\nincensed at either rebuff, and to be treated with disdain is more\nbitter to a proud spirit than not to be feared. Do you wish to know what\nSocrates really meant? He, whose freedom of speech could not be borne\neven by a free state, was not willing of his own choice to become a\nslave.\nVII. I think that we have sufficiently discussed this part of the\nsubject, whether it be disgraceful to be worsted in a contest of\nbenefits. Whoever asks this question must know that men are not wont\nto bestow benefits upon themselves, for evidently it could not be\ndisgraceful to be worsted by oneself. Yet some of the Stoics debate this\nquestion, whether any one can confer a benefit upon himself, and whether\none ought to return one's own kindness to oneself. This discussion has\nbeen raised in consequence of our habit of saying, \"I am thankful\nto myself,\" \"I can complain of no one but myself,\" \"I am angry with\nmyself,\" \"I will punish myself,\" \"I hate myself,\" and many other phrases\nof the same sort, in which one speaks of oneself as one would of some\nother person. \"If,\" they argue, \"I can injure myself, why should I not\nbe able also to bestow a benefit upon myself? Besides this, why are\nthose things not called benefits when I bestow them upon myself which\nwould be called benefits if I bestowed them upon another? If to receive\na certain thing from another would lay me under an obligation to him,\nhow is it that if I give it to myself, I do not contract an obligation\nto myself? why should I be ungrateful to my own self, which is no less\ndisgraceful than it is to be mean to oneself, or hard and cruel to\noneself, or neglectful of oneself?\" The procurer is equally odious\nwhether he prostitutes others or himself. We blame a flatterer, and one\nwho imitates another man's mode of speech, or is prepared to give praise\nwhether it be deserved or not; we ought equally to blame one who humours\nhimself and looks up to himself, and so to speak is his own flatterer.\nVices are not only hateful when outwardly practised, but also when they\nare repressed within the mind. Whom would you admire more than he who\ngoverns himself and has himself under command? It is easier to rule\nsavage nations, impatient of foreign control, than to restrain one's\nown mind and keep it under one's own control. Plato, it is argued,\nwas grateful to Socrates for having been taught by him; why should not\nSocrates be grateful to himself for having taught himself? Marcus Cato\nsaid, \"Borrow from yourself whatever you lack;\" why, then, if I can\nlend myself anything, should I be unable to give myself anything? The\ninstances in which usage divides us into two persons are innumerable; we\nare wont to say, \"Let me converse with myself,\" and, \"I will give myself\na twitch of the ear;\" [Footnote: See book iv. ch. xxxvi.] and if it be\ntrue that one can do so, then a man ought to be grateful to himself,\njust as he is angry with himself; as he blames himself, SO he ought\nto praise himself; since he can impoverish himself, he can also enrich\nhimself. Injuries and benefits are the converse of one another: if we\nsay of a man, 'he has done himself an injury,' we can also say 'he has\nbestowed upon himself a benefit?'\nVIII. It is natural that a man should first incur an obligation, and\nthen that he should return gratitude for it; a debtor cannot exist\nwithout a creditor, any more than a husband without a wife, or a son\nwithout a father; someone must give in order that some one may\nreceive. Just as no one carries himself, although he moves his body and\ntransports it from place to place; as no one, though he may have made a\nspeech in his own defence, is said to have stood by himself, or erects\na statue to himself as his own patron; as no sick man, when by his\nown care he has regained his health, asks himself for a fee; so in no\ntransaction, even when a man does what is useful to himself, need he\nreturn thanks to himself, because there is no one to whom he can return\nthem. Though I grant that a man can bestow a benefit upon himself, yet\nat the same time that he gives it, he also receives it; though I grant\nthat a man may receive a benefit from himself, yet he receives it at the\nsame time that he gives it. The exchange takes place within doors, as\nthey say, and the transfer is made at once, as though the debt were a\nfictitious one; for he who gives is not a different person to he who\nreceives, but one and the same. The word \"to owe\" has no meaning except\nas between two persons; how then can it apply to one man who incurs an\nobligation, and by the same act frees himself from it? In a disk or\na ball there is no top or bottom, no beginning or end, because the\nrelation of the parts is changed when it moves, what was behind coming\nbefore, and what went down on one side coming up on the other, so that\nall the parts, in whatever direction they may move, come back to the\nsame position. Imagine that the same thing takes place in a man; into\nhowever many pieces you may divide him, he remains one. If he strikes\nhimself, he has no one to call to account for the insult; if he binds\nhimself and locks himself up, he cannot demand damages; if he bestows a\nbenefit upon himself, he straightway returns it to the giver. It is said\nthat there is no waste in nature, because everything which is taken from\nnature returns to her again, and nothing can perish, because it cannot\nfall out of nature, but goes round again to the point from whence\nit started. You ask, \"What connection has this illustration with the\nsubject?\" I will tell you. Imagine yourself to be ungrateful, the\nbenefit bestowed upon you is not lost, he who gave it has it; suppose\nthat you are unwilling to receive it, it still belongs to you before it\nis returned. You cannot lose anything, because what you take away from\nyourself, you nevertheless gain yourself. The matter revolves in a\ncircle within yourself; by receiving you give, by giving you receive.\nIX. \"It is our duty,\" argues our adversary, \"to bestow benefits upon\nourselves, therefore we ought also to be grateful to ourselves.\" The\noriginal axiom, upon which the inference depends, is untrue, for no one\nbestows benefits upon himself, but obeys the dictates of his nature,\nwhich disposes him to affection for himself, and which makes him take\nthe greatest pains to avoid hurtful things, and to follow after those\nthings which are profitable to him. Consequently, the man who gives to\nhimself is not generous, nor is he who pardons himself forgiving, nor is\nhe who is touched by his own misfortunes tender-hearted; it is\nnatural to do those things to oneself which when done to others become\ngenerosity, clemency, and tenderness of heart. A benefit is a voluntary\nact, but to do good to oneself is an instinctive one. The more benefits\na man bestows, the more beneficent he is, yet who ever was praised for\nhaving been of service to himself? or for having rescued himself from\nbrigands? No one bestows a benefit upon himself any more than he bestows\nhospitality upon himself; no one gives himself anything, any more than\nhe lends himself anything. If each man bestows benefits upon himself, is\nalways bestowing them, and bestows them without any cessation, then\nit is impossible for him to make any calculation of the number of his\nbenefits; when then can he show his gratitude, seeing that by the very\nact of doing so he would bestow a benefit? for what distinction can\nyou draw between giving himself a benefit or receiving a benefit for\nhimself, when the whole transaction takes place in the mind of the same\nman? Suppose that I have freed myself from danger, then I have bestowed\na benefit upon myself; suppose I free myself a second time, by so doing\ndo I bestow or repay a benefit? In the next place, even if I grant the\nprimary axiom, that we can bestow benefits upon ourselves, I do not\nadmit that which follows; for even if we can do so, we ought not to do\nso. Wherefore? Because we receive a return for them at once. It is right\nfor me to receive a benefit, then to lie under an obligation, then to\nrepay it; now here there is no time for remaining under an obligation,\nbecause we receive the return without any delay. No one really gives\nexcept to another, no one owes except to another, no one repays except\nto another. An act which always requires two persons cannot take place\nwithin the mind of one.\nX. A benefit means the affording of something useful, and the word\nAFFORDING implies other persons. Would not a man be thought mad if\nhe said that he had sold something to himself, because selling means\nalienation, and the transferring of a thing and of one's rights in that\nthing to another person? Yet giving, like selling anything, consists in\nmaking it pass away from you, handing over what you yourself once owned\ninto the keeping of some one else.\nIf this be so, no one ever gave himself a benefit, because no one gives\nto himself; if not, two opposites coalesce, so that it becomes the same\nthing to give and to receive. Yet there is a great difference between\ngiving and receiving; how should there not be, seeing that these words\nare the converse of one another? Still, if any one can give himself a\nbenefit, there can be no difference between giving and receiving. I said\na little before that some words apply only to other persons, and are\nso constituted that their whole meaning lies apart from ourselves; for\ninstance, I am a brother, but a brother of some other man, for no one is\nhis own brother; I am an equal, but equal to somebody else, for who\nis equal to himself? A thing which is compared to another thing is\nunintelligible without that other thing; a thing which is joined to\nsomething else does not exist apart from it; so that which is given does\nnot exist without the other person, nor can a benefit have any existence\nwithout another person. This is clear from the very phrase which\ndescribes it, 'to do good,' yet no one does good to himself, any more\nthan he favours himself or is on his own side. I might enlarge further\nupon this subject and give many examples. Why should benefits not be\nincluded among those acts which require two persons to perform them?\nMany honourable, most admirable and highly virtuous acts cannot take\nplace without a second person. Fidelity is praised and held to be one\nof the chief blessings known among men, yet was any one ever on that\naccount said to have kept faith with himself?\nXI. I come now to the last part of this subject. The man who returns a\nkindness ought to expend something, just as he who repays expends money;\nbut the man who returns a kindness to himself expends nothing, just\nas he who receives a benefit from himself gains nothing. A benefit\nand gratitude for it must pass to and fro between two persons; their\ninterchange cannot take place within one man. He who returns a kindness\ndoes good in his turn to him from whom he has received something;\nbut the man who returns his own kindness, to whom does he do good?\nTo himself? Is there any one who does not regard the returning of a\nkindness, and the bestowal of a benefit, as distinct acts? 'He who\nreturns a kindness to himself does good to himself.' Was any man ever\nunwilling to do this, even though he were ungrateful? nay, who ever was\nungrateful from any other motive than this? \"If,\" it is argued, \"we are\nright in thanking ourselves, we ought to return our own kindness;\"\nyet we say, \"I am thankful to myself for having refused to marry that\nwoman,\" or \"for having refused to join a partnership with that man.\"\nWhen we speak thus, we are really praising ourselves, and make use\nof the language of those who return thanks to approve our own acts. A\nbenefit is something which, when given, may or may not be returned.\nNow, he who gives a benefit to himself must needs receive what he gives;\ntherefore, this is not a benefit. A benefit is received at one time, and\nis returned at another; (but when a man bestows a benefit upon himself,\nhe both receives it and returns it at the same time). In a benefit,\ntoo, what we commend and admire is, that a man has for the time being\nforgotten his own interests, in order that he may do good to another;\nthat he has deprived himself of something, in order to bestow it upon\nanother. Now, he who bestows a benefit upon himself does not do this.\nThe bestowal of a benefit is an act of companionship--it wins some man's\nfriendship, and lays some man under an obligation; but to bestow it upon\noneself is no act of companionship--it wins no man's friendship, lays\nno man under an obligation, raises no man's hopes, or leads him to\nsay, \"This man must be courted; he bestowed a benefit upon that person,\nperhaps he will bestow one upon me also.\" A benefit is a thing which\none gives not for one's own sake, but for the sake of him to whom it is\ngiven; but he who bestows a benefit upon himself, does so for his own\nsake; therefore, it is not a benefit.\nXII. Now I seem to you not to have made good what I said at the\nbeginning of this book. You say that I am far from doing what is worth\nany one's while; nay, that in real fact I have thrown away all my\ntrouble. Wait, and soon you will be able to say this more truly, for\nI shall lead you into covert lurking-places, from which when you have\nescaped, you will have gained nothing except that you will have freed\nyourself from difficulties with which you need never have hampered\nyourself. What is the use of laboriously untying knots which you\nyourself have tied, in order that you might untie them? Yet, just as\nsome knots are tied in fun and for amusement, so that a tyro may find\ndifficulty in untying them, which knots he who tied them can loose\nwithout any trouble, because he knows the joinings and the difficulties\nof them, and these nevertheless afford us some pleasure, because they\ntest the sharpness of our wits, and engross, our attention; so also\nthese questions, which seem subtle and tricky, prevent our intellects\nbecoming careless and lazy, for they ought at one time to have a field\ngiven them to level, in order that they may wander about it, and at\nanother to have some dark and rough passage thrown in their way for them\nto creep through, and make their way with caution. It is said by\nour opponent that no one is ungrateful; and this is supported by the\nfollowing arguments: \"A benefit is that which does good; but, as you\nStoics say, no one can do good to a bad man; therefore, a bad man does\nnot receive a benefit. (If he does not receive it, he need not return\nit; therefore, no bad man is ungrateful.) Furthermore, a benefit is an\nhonourable and commendable thing. No honourable or commendable thing can\nfind any place with a bad man; therefore, neither can a benefit. If he\ncannot receive one, he need not repay one; therefore, he does not become\nungrateful. Moreover, as you say, a good man does everything rightly; if\nhe does everything rightly, he cannot be ungrateful. A good man returns\na benefit, a bad man does not receive one. If this be so, no man, good\nor bad, can be ungrateful. Therefore, there is no such thing in nature\nas an ungrateful man: the word is meaningless.\" We Stoics have only one\nkind of good, that which is honourable. This cannot come to a bad man,\nfor he would cease to be bad if virtue entered into him; but as long as\nhe is bad, no one can bestow a benefit upon him, because good and bad\nare contraries, and cannot exist together. Therefore, no one can do good\nto such a man, because whatever he receives is corrupted by his vicious\nway of using it. Just as the stomach, when disordered by disease and\nsecreting bile, changes all the food which it receives, and turns every\nkind of sustenance into a source of pain, so whatever you entrust to an\nill-regulated mind becomes to it a burden, an annoyance, and a source\nof misery. Thus the most prosperous and the richest men have the most\ntrouble; and the more property they have to perplex them, the less\nlikely they are to find out what they really are. Nothing, therefore,\ncan reach bad men which would do them good; nay, nothing which would\nnot do them harm. They change whatever falls to their lot into their own\nevil nature; and things which elsewhere would, if given to better men,\nbe both beautiful and profitable, are ruinous to them. They cannot,\ntherefore, bestow benefits, because no one can give what he does not\npossess, and, therefore, they lack the pleasure of doing good to others.\nXIII. But, though this be so, yet even a bad man can receive some things\nwhich resemble benefits, and he will be ungrateful if he does not return\nthem. There are good things belonging to the mind, to the body, and to\nfortune. A fool or a bad man is debarred from the first--those, that is,\nof the mind; but he is admitted to a share in the two latter, and, if\nhe does not return them, he is ungrateful. Nor does this follow from\nour (Stoic) system alone the Peripatetics, also, who widely extend the\nboundaries of human happiness, declare that trifling benefits reach bad\nmen, and that he who does not return them is ungrateful. We therefore\ndo not agree that things which do not tend to improve the mind should\nbe called benefits, yet do not deny that these things are convenient and\ndesirable. Such things as these a bad man may bestow upon a good man,\nor may receive from him--such, for example, as money, clothes, public\noffice, or life; and, if he makes no return for these, he will come\nunder the denomination of ungrateful. \"But how can you call a man\nungrateful for not returning that which you say is not a benefit?\" Some\nthings, on account of their similarity, are included under the same\ndesignation, although they do not really deserve it. Thus we speak of\na silver or golden box; [\"The original word is 'pyx,' which means a box\nmade of box-wood.\"] thus we call a man illiterate, although he may not\nbe utterly ignorant, but only not acquainted with the higher branches of\nliterature; thus, seeing a badly-dressed ragged man we say that we have\nseen a naked man. These things of which we spoke are not benefits,\nbut they possess the appearance of benefits. \"Then, just as they are\nquasi-benefits, so your man is quasi-ungrateful, not really ungrateful.\"\nThis is untrue, because both he who gives and he who receives them\nspeaks of them as benefits; so he who fails to return the semblance of\na real benefit is as much an ungrateful man as he who mixes a sleeping\ndraught, believing it to be poison, is a poisoner.\nXIV. Cleanthes speaks more impetuously than this. \"Granted,\" says he,\n\"that what he received was not a benefit, yet he is ungrateful, because\nhe would not have returned a benefit if he had received one.\" So he who\ncarries deadly weapons and has intentions of robbing and murdering, is\na brigand even before he has dipped his hands in blood; his wickedness\nconsists and is shown in action, but does not begin thereby. Men are\npunished for sacrilege, although no one's hands can reach to the gods.\n\"How,\" asks our opponent, \"can any one be ungrateful to a bad man, since\na bad man cannot bestow a benefit?\" In the same way, I answer, because\nthat which he received was not a benefit, but was called one; if any\none receives from a bad man any of those things which are valued by the\nignorant, and of which bad men often possess great store, it becomes his\nduty to make a return in the same kind, and to give back as though they\nwere truly good those things which he received as though they were\ntruly good. A man is said to be in debt, whether he owes gold pieces\nor leather marked with a state stamp, such as the Lacedaemonians used,\nwhich passes for coined money. Pay your debts in that kind in which you\nincurred them. You have nothing to do with the definition of benefits,\nor with the question whether so great and noble a name ought to be\ndegraded by applying it to such vulgar and mean matters as these, nor do\nwe seek for truth that we may use it to the disadvantage of others;\ndo you adjust your minds to the semblance of truth, and while you are\nlearning what is really honourable, respect everything to which the name\nof honour is applied.\nXV. \"In the same way,\" argues our adversary, \"that your school proves\nthat no one is ungrateful, you afterwards prove that all men are\nungrateful. For, as you say, all fools are bad men; he who has one vice\nhas all vices; all men are both fools and bad men; therefore all men are\nungrateful.\" Well, what then? Are they not? Is not this the universal\nreproach of the human race? is there not a general complaint that\nbenefits are thrown away, and that there are very few men who do not\nrequite their benefactors with the basest ingratitude? Nor need you\nsuppose that what we say is merely the grumbling of men who think\nevery act wicked and depraved which falls short of an ideal standard of\nrighteousness. Listen! I know not who it is who speaks, yet the voice\nwith which he condemns mankind proceeds, not from the schools of\nphilosophers, but from the midst of the crowd:\n\"Host is not safe from guest;\nFather-in-law from son; but seldom love\nExists 'twixt brothers; wives long to destroy\nTheir husbands; husbands long to slay their wives.\"\nThis goes even further: according to this, crimes take the place of\nbenefits, and men do not shrink from shedding the blood of those for\nwhom they ought to shed their own; we requite benefits by steel and\npoison. We call laying violent hands upon our own country, and putting\ndown its resistance by the fasces of its own lictors, gaining power\nand great place; every man thinks himself to be in a mean and degraded\nposition if he has not raised himself above the constitution; the armies\nwhich are received from the state are turned against her, and a general\nnow says to his men, \"Fight against your wives, fight against your\nchildren, march in arms against your altars, your hearths and homes!\"\nYes, [Footnote: I believe, in spite of Gertz, that this is part of\nthe speech of the Roman general, and that the conjecture of Muretus,\n\"without the command of the senate,\" gives better sense.] you, who even\nwhen about to triumph ought not to enter the city at the command of the\nsenate, and who have often, when bringing home a victorious army, been\ngiven an audience outside the walls, you now, after slaughtering your\ncountrymen, stained with the blood of your kindred, march into the city\nwith standards erect. \"Let liberty,\" say you, \"be silent amidst the\nensigns of war, and now that wars are driven far away and no ground\nfor terror remains, let that people which conquered and civilized all\nnations be beleaguered within its own walls, and shudder at the sight of\nits own eagles.\"\nXVI. Coriolanus was ungrateful, and became dutiful late, and after\nrepenting of his crime; he did indeed lay down his arms, but only in\nthe midst of his unnatural warfare. Catilina was ungrateful; he was\nnot satisfied with taking his country captive without overturning it,\nwithout despatching the hosts of the Allobroges against it, without\nbringing an enemy from beyond the Alps to glut his old inborn hatred,\nand to offer Roman generals as sacrifices which had been long owing to\nthe tombs of the Gaulish dead. Caius Marius was ungrateful, when, after\nbeing raised from the ranks to the consulship, he felt that he would not\nhave wreaked his vengeance upon fortune, and would sink to his original\nobscurity, unless he slaughtered Romans as freely as he had slaughtered\nthe Cimbri, and not merely gave the signal, but was himself the signal\nfor civil disasters and butcheries. Lucius Sulla was ungrateful, for he\nsaved his country by using remedies worse than the perils with which it\nwas threatened, when he marched through human blood all the way from the\ncitadel of Praeneste to the Colline Gate, fought more battles and caused\nmore slaughter afterwards within the city, and most cruelly after the\nvictory was won, most wickedly after quarter had been promised them,\ndrove two legions into a corner and put them to the sword, and, great\ngods! invented a proscription by which he who slew a Roman citizen\nreceived indemnity, a sum of money, everything but a civic crown! Cnaeus\nPompeius was ungrateful, for the return which he made to his country for\nthree consulships, three triumphs, and the innumerable public offices\ninto most of which he thrust himself when under age, was to lead others\nalso to lay hands upon her under the pretext of thus rendering his own\npower less odious; as though what no one ought to do became right\nif more than one person did it. Whilst he was coveting extraordinary\ncommands, arranging the provinces so as to have his own choice of them,\nand dividing the whole state with a third person, [Footnote: Crassus.]\nin such a manner as to leave two-thirds of it in the possession of his\nown family, [Footnote: Pompey was married to Caesar's daughter. Cf.\nVirg., \"Aen.,\" vi., 831, sq., and Lucan's beautiful verses, \"Phars.,\"\ni., 114.] he reduced the Roman people to such a condition that they\ncould only save themselves by submitting to slavery. The foe and\nconqueror [Footnote: Seneca is careful to avoid the mention of Caesar's\nname, which might have given offence to the emperors under whom\nhe lived, who used the name as a title.] of Pompeius was himself\nungrateful; he brought war from Gaul and Germany to Rome, and he, the\nfriend of the populace, the champion of the commons, pitched his camp in\nthe Circus Flaminus, nearer to the city than Porsena's camp had been. He\ndid, indeed, use the cruel privileges of victory with moderation; as was\nsaid at the time, he protected his countrymen, and put to death no man\nwho was not in arms. Yet what credit is there in this? Others used their\narms more cruelly, but flung them away when glutted with blood, while\nhe, though he soon sheathed the sword, never laid it aside. Antonius was\nungrateful to his dictator, who he declared was rightly slain, and whose\nmurderers he allowed to depart to their commands in the provinces;\nas for his country, after it had been torn to pieces by so many\nproscriptions, invasions, and civil wars, he intended to subject it\nto kings, not even of Roman birth, and to force that very state to pay\ntribute to eunuchs, [Footnote: The allusion is to Antonius's connection\nwith Cleopatra. Cf. Virg. \"Aen.,\" viii., 688.] which had itself restored\nsovereign rights, autonomy, and immunities, to the Achaeans, the\nRhodians, and the people of many other famous cities.\nXVII. The day would not be long enough for me to enumerate those who\nhave pushed their ingratitude so far as to ruin their native land.\nIt would be as vast a task to mention how often the state has been\nungrateful to its best and most devoted lovers, although it has done no\nless wrong than it has suffered. It sent Camillus and Scipio into exile;\neven after the death of Catiline it exiled Cicero, destroyed his house,\nplundered his property, and did everything which Catiline would\nhave done if victorious; Rutilius found his virtue rewarded with a\nhiding-place in Asia; to Cato the Roman people refused the praetorship,\nand persisted in refusing the consulship. We are ungrateful in public\nmatters; and if every man asks himself, you will find that there is\nno one who has not some private ingratitude to complain of. Yet it is\nimpossible that all men should complain, unless all were deserving of\ncomplaint, therefore all men are ungrateful. Are they ungrateful\nalone? nay, they are also all covetous, all spiteful, and all cowardly,\nespecially those who appear daring; and, besides this, all men fawn upon\nthe great, and all are impious. Yet you need not be angry with them;\npardon them, for they are all mad. I do not wish to recall you to what\nis not proved, or to say, \"See how ungrateful is youth! what young man,\neven if of innocent life, does not long for his father's death? even if\nmoderate in his desires, does not look forward to it? even if dutiful,\ndoes not think about it? How few there are who fear the death even of\nthe best of wives, who do not even calculate the probabilities of it.\nPray, what litigant, after having been successfully defended, retains\nany remembrance of so great a benefit for more than a few days?\" All\nagree that no one dies without complaining. Who on his last day dares to\nsay,\n\"I've lived, I've done the task which Fortune set me.\"\nWho does not leave the world with reluctance, and with lamentations? Yet\nit is the part of an ungrateful man not to be satisfied with the past.\nYour days will always be few if you count them. Reflect that length\nof time is not the greatest of blessings; make the best of your time,\nhowever short it may be; even if the day of your death be postponed,\nyour happiness will not be increased, for life is merely made longer,\nnot pleasanter, by delay. How much better is it to be thankful for the\npleasures which one has received, not to reckon up the years of others,\nbut to set a high value upon one's own, and score them to one's credit,\nsaying, \"God thought me worthy of this; I am satisfied with it; he might\nhave given me more, but this, too, is a benefit.\" Let us be grateful\ntowards both gods and men, grateful to those who have given us anything,\nand grateful even to those who have given anything to our relatives.\nXVIII. \"You render me liable to an infinite debt of gratitude,\" says our\nopponent, \"when you say 'even to those who have given any thing to our\nrelations,' so fix some limit. He who bestows a benefit upon the son,\naccording to you, bestows it likewise upon the father: this is the first\nquestion I wish to raise. In the next place I should like to have a\nclear definition of whether a benefit, if it be bestowed upon your\nfriend's father as well as upon himself, is bestowed also upon his\nbrother? or upon his uncle? or his grandfather? or his wife and his\nfather-in-law? tell me where I am to stop, how far I am to follow out\nthe pedigree of the family?\"\nSENECA. If I cultivate your land, I bestow a benefit upon you; if I\nextinguish your house when burning, or prop it so as to save it from\nfalling, I shall bestow a benefit upon you; if I heal your slave, I\nshall charge it to you; if I save your son's life, will you not thereby\nreceive a benefit from me?\nXIX. THE ADVERSARY. Your instances are not to the purpose, for he who\ncultivates my land, does not benefit the land, but me; he who props my\nhouse so that it does not fall, does this service to me, for the house\nitself is without feeling, and as it has none, it is I who am indebted\nto him; and he who cultivates my land does so because he wishes to\noblige me, not to oblige the land. I should say the same of a slave; he\nis a chattel owned by me; he is saved for my advantage, therefore I am\nindebted for him. My son is himself capable of receiving a benefit; so\nit is he who receives it; I am gratified at a benefit which comes so\nnear to myself, but am not laid under any obligation.\nSE. Still I should like you, who say that you are under no obligation,\nto answer me this. The good health, the happiness, and the inheritance\nof a son are connected with his father; his father will be more happy if\nhe keeps his son safe, and more unhappy if he loses him. What follows,\nthen? when a man is made happier by me and is freed from the greatest\ndanger of unhappiness, does he not receive a benefit?\nAD. No, because there are some things which are bestowed upon others,\nand yet flow from them so as to reach ourselves; yet we must ask the\nperson upon whom it was bestowed for repayment; as for example, money\nmust be sought from the man to whom it was lent, although it may,\nby some means, have come into my hands. There is no benefit whose\nadvantages do not extend to the receiver's nearest friends, and\nsometimes even to those less intimately connected with him; yet we do\nnot enquire whither the benefit has proceeded from him to whom it was\nfirst given, but where it was first placed. You must demand repayment\nfrom the defendant himself personally.\nSE. Well, but I pray you, do you not say, \"you have preserved my son for\nme; had he perished, I could not have survived him?\" Do you not owe\na benefit for the life of one whose safety you value above your own?\nMoreover, should I save your son's life, you would fall down before\nmy knees, and would pay vows to heaven as though you yourself had been\nsaved; you would say, \"It makes no difference whether you have saved\nmine or me; you have saved us both, yet me more than him.\" Why do you\nsay this, if you do not receive a benefit?\nA.D. Because, if my son were to contract a loan, I should pay his\ncreditor, yet I should not, therefore, be indebted to him; or if my son\nwere taken in adultery, I should blush, yet I should not, therefore, be\nan adulterer. I say that I am under an obligation to you for saving my\nson, not because I really am, but because I am willing to constitute\nmyself your debtor of my own free will. On the other hand I have derived\nfrom his safety the greatest possible pleasure and advantage, and I have\nescaped that most dreadful blow, the loss of my child. True, but we are\nnot now discussing whether you have done me any good or not, but whether\nyou have bestowed a benefit upon me; for animals, stones, and herbs can\ndo one good, but do not bestow benefits, which can only be given by one\nwho wishes well to the receiver. Now you do not wish well to the father,\nbut only to the son; and sometimes you do not even know the father. So\nwhen you have said, \"Have I not bestowed a benefit upon the father by\nsaving the son?\" you ought to meet this with, \"Have I, then, bestowed a\nbenefit upon a father whom I do not know, whom I never thought of?\" And\nwhat will you say when, as is sometimes the case, you hate the father,\nand yet save his son? Can you be thought to have bestowed a benefit upon\none whom you hated most bitterly while you were bestowing it?\nHowever, if I were to lay aside the bickering of dialogue, and answer\nyou as a lawyer, I should say that you ought to consider the intention\nof the giver, you must regard his benefit as bestowed upon the person\nupon whom he meant to bestow it. If he did it in honour of the father,\nthen the father received the benefit; if he thought only of the son,\nthen the father is not laid under any obligation: by the benefit which\nwas conferred upon the son, even though the father derives pleasure from\nit. Should he, however, have an opportunity, he will himself wish to\ngive you something, yet not as though he were forced to repay a debt,\nbut rather as if he had grounds for beginning an exchange of favours.\nNo return for a benefit ought to be demanded from the father of the\nreceiver; if he does you any kindness in return for it, he should be\nregarded as, a righteous man, but not as a grateful one. For there is no\nend to it; if I bestow a benefit on the receiver's father, do I likewise\nbestow it upon his mother, his grandfather, his maternal uncle, his\nchildren, relations, friends, slaves, and country? Where, then, does\na benefit begin to stop? for there follows it this endless chain of\npeople, to whom it is hard to assign bounds, because they join it by\ndegrees, and are always creeping on towards it.\nXX. A common question is, \"Two brothers are at variance. If I save the\nlife of one, do I confer a benefit upon the other, who will be sorry\nthat his hated brother did not perish?\" There can be no doubt that it is\na benefit to do good to a man, even against that man's will, just as he,\nwho against his own will does a man good, does not bestow a benefit upon\nhim. \"Do you,\" asks our adversary, \"call that by which he is displeased\nand hurt a benefit?\" Yes; many benefits have a harsh and forbidding\nappearance, such as cutting or burning to cure disease, or confining\nwith chains. We must not consider whether a man is grieved at receiving\na benefit, but whether he ought to rejoice: a coin is not bad because it\nis refused by a savage who is unacquainted with its proper stamp. A man\nreceives a benefit even though he hates what is done, provided that it\ndoes him good, and that the giver bestowed it in order to do him good.\nIt makes no difference if he receives a good thing in a bad spirit.\nConsider the converse of this. Suppose that a man hates his brother,\nthough it is to his advantage to have a brother, and I kill this\nbrother, this is not a benefit, though he may say that it is, and be\nglad of it. Our most artful enemies are those whom we thank for the\nwrongs which they do us.\n\"I understand; a thing which does good is a benefit, a thing which does\nharm is not a benefit. Now I will suggest to you an act which neither\ndoes good nor harm, and yet is a benefit. Suppose that I find the corpse\nof some one's father in a wilderness, and bury it, then I certainly\nhave done him no good, for what difference could it make to him in what\nmanner his body decayed? Nor have I done any good to his son, for what\nadvantage does he gain by my act?\" I will tell you what he gains. He has\nby my means performed a solemn and necessary rite; I have performed a\nservice for his father which he would have wished, nay, which it would\nhave been his duty to have performed himself. Yet this act is not a\nbenefit, if I merely yielded to those feelings of pity and kindliness\nwhich would make me bury any corpse whatever, but only if I recognized\nthis body, and buried it, with the thought in my mind that I was doing\nthis service to the son; but, by merely throwing earth over a dead\nstranger, I lay no one under an obligation for an act performed on\ngeneral principles of humanity.\nIt may be asked, \"Why are you so careful in inquiring upon whom you\nbestow benefits, as though some day you meant to demand repayment of\nthem? Some say that repayment should never be demanded; and they give\nthe following reasons. An unworthy man will not repay the benefit which\nhe has received, even if it be demanded of him, while a worthy man will\ndo so of his own accord. Consequently, if you have bestowed it upon a\ngood man, wait; do not outrage him by asking him for it, as though of\nhis own accord he never would repay it. If you have bestowed it upon a\nbad man, suffer for it, but do not spoil your benefit by turning it\ninto a loan. Moreover the law, by not authorizing you, forbids you,\nby implication, to demand the repayment of a benefit.\" All this is\nnonsense. As long as I am in no pressing need, as long as I am\nnot forced by poverty, I will lose my benefits rather than ask for\nrepayment; but if the lives of my children were at stake, if my wife\nwere in danger, if my regard for the welfare of my country and for\nmy own liberty were to force me to adopt a course which I disliked, I\nshould overcome my delicacy, and openly declare that I had done all that\nI could to avoid the necessity of receiving help from an ungrateful man;\nthe necessity of obtaining repayment of one's benefit will in the end\novercome one's delicacy about asking for it. In the next place, when I\nbestow a benefit upon a good man, I do so with the intention of never\ndemanding repayment, except in case of absolute necessity.\nXXI. \"But,\" argues he, \"by not authorizing you, the law forbids you to\nexact repayment.\" There are many things which are not enforced by any\nlaw or process, but which the conventions of society, which are stronger\nthan any law, compel us to observe. There is no law forbidding us to\ndivulge our friend's secrets; there is no law which bids us keep faith\neven with an enemy; pray what law is there which binds us to stand by\nwhat we have promised? There is none. Nevertheless I should remonstrate\nwith one who did not keep a secret, and I should be indignant with one\nwho pledged his word and broke it. \"But,\" he argues, \"you are turning a\nbenefit into a loan.\" By no means, for I do not insist upon repayment,\nbut only demand it; nay, I do not even demand it, but remind my friend\nof it. Even the direst need will not bring me to apply for help to one\nwith whom I should have to undergo a long struggle.\nIf there be any one so ungrateful that it is not sufficient to remind\nhim of his debt, I should pass him over, and think that he did not\ndeserve to be made grateful by force. A money-lender does not demand\nrepayment from his debtors if he knows they have become bankrupt, and,\nto their shame, have nothing but shame left to lose; and I, like him,\nshould pass over those who are openly and obstinately ungrateful, and\nwould demand repayment only from those who were likely to give it me,\nnot from those from whom I should have to extort it by force.\nXXII. There are many who cannot deny that they have received a benefit,\nyet cannot return it--men who are not good enough to be termed grateful,\nnor yet bad enough to be termed ungrateful; but who are dull and\nsluggish, backward debtors, though not defaulters. Such men as these I\nshould not ask for repayment, but forcibly remind them of it, and, from\na state of indifference, bring them back to their duty. They would at\nonce reply, \"Forgive me; I did not know, by Hercules, that you missed\nthis, or I would have offered it of my own accord, I beg that you will\nnot think me ungrateful; I remember your goodness to me.\" Why need I\nhesitate to make such men as these better to themselves and to me? I\nwould prevent any one from doing wrong, if I were able; much more would\nI prevent a friend, both lest he should do wrong, and lest he should\ndo wrong to me in particular. I bestow a second benefit upon him by not\npermitting him to be ungrateful; and I should not reproach him harshly\nwith what I had done for him, but should speak as gently as I could. In\norder to afford him an opportunity of returning my kindness, I\nshould refresh his remembrance of it, and ask for a benefit; he would\nunderstand that I was asking for repayment. Sometimes I would make use\nof somewhat severe language, if I had any hope that by it he might be\namended; though I would not irritate a hopelessly ungrateful man, for\nfear that I might turn him into an enemy. If we spare the ungrateful\neven the affront of reminding them of their conduct, we shall render\nthem' more backward in returning benefits; and although some might\nbe cured of their evil ways, and be made into good men, if their\nconsciences were stung by remorse, yet we shall allow them to perish for\nwant of a word of warning, with which a father sometimes corrects\nhis son, a wife brings back to herself an erring husband, or a man\nstimulates the wavering fidelity of his friend.\nXXIII. To awaken some men, it is only necessary to stir them, not to\nstrike them; in like manner, with some men, the feeling of honour about\nreturning a benefit is not extinct, but slumbering. Let us rouse it. \"Do\nnot,\" they will say, \"make the kindness you have done me into a wrong:\nfor it is a wrong, if you do not demand some return from me, and so make\nme ungrateful. What if I do not know what sort of repayment you wish\nfor? if I am so occupied by business, and my attention is so much\ndiverted to other subjects that I have not been able to watch for an\nopportunity of serving you? Point out to me what I can do for you, what\nyou wish me to do. Why do you despair, before making a trial of me? Why\nare you in such haste to lose both your benefit and your friend? How can\nyou tell whether I do not wish, or whether I do not know how to repay\nyou: whether it be in intention or in opportunity that I am wanting?\nMake a trial of me.\" I would therefore remind him of what I had done,\nwithout bitterness, not in public, or in a reproachful manner, but so\nthat he may think that he himself has remembered it rather than that it\nhas been recalled to him.\nXXIV. One of Julius Caesar's veterans was once pleading before him\nagainst his neighbours, and the cause was going against him. \"Do you\nremember, general,\" said he, \"that in Spain you dislocated your ankle\nnear the river Sucro [Footnote: Xucar]?\" When Caesar said that he\nremembered it, he continued, \"Do you remember that when, during the\nexcessive heat, you wished to rest under a tree which afforded very\nlittle shade, as the ground in which that solitary tree grew was rough\nand rocky, one of your comrades spread his cloak under you?\" Caesar\nanswered, \"Of course, I remember; indeed, I was perishing with thirst;\nand since was unable to walk to the nearest spring, I would have crawled\nthither on my hands and knees, had not my comrade, a brave and active\nman, brought me water in his helmet.\" \"Could you, then, my general,\nrecognize that man or that helmet?\" Caesar replied that he could not\nremember the helmet, but that he could remember the man well; and he\nadded, I fancy in anger at being led away to this old story in the midst\nof a judicial enquiry, \"At any rate, you are not he.\" \"I do not blame\nyou, Caesar,\" answered the man, \"for not recognizing me; for when this\ntook place, I was unwounded; but afterwards, at the battle of Munda,\nmy eye was struck out, and the bones of my skull crushed. Nor would\nyou recognize that helmet if you saw it, for it was split by a Spanish\nsword.\" Caesar would not permit this man to be troubled with lawsuits,\nand presented his old soldier with the fields through which a village\nright of way had given rise to the dispute.\nXXV. In this case, what ought he to have done? Because his commander's\nmemory was confused by a multitude of incidents, and because his\nposition as the leader of vast armies did not permit him to notice\nindividual soldiers, ought the man not to have asked for a return for\nthe benefit which he had conferred? To act as he did is not so much to\nask for a return as to take it when it lies in a convenient position\nready for us, although we have to stretch out our hands in order to\nreceive it. I shall therefore ask for the return of a benefit, whenever\nI am either reduced to great straits, or where by doing so I shall act\nto the advantage of him from whom I ask it. Tiberius Caesar, when some\none addressed him with the words, \"Do you remember....?\" answered,\nbefore the man could mention any further proofs of former acquaintance,\n\"I do not remember what I was.\" Why should it not be forbidden to demand\nof this man repayment of former favours? He had a motive for forgetting\nthem: he denied all knowledge of his friends and comrades, and wished\nmen only to see, to think, and to speak of him as emperor. He regarded\nhis old friend as an impertinent meddler.\nWe ought to be even more careful to choose a favorable opportunity when\nwe ask for a benefit to be repaid to us than when we ask for one to\nbe bestowed upon us. We must be temperate in our language, so that the\ngrateful may not take offence, or the ungrateful pretend to do so. If we\nlived among wise men, it would be our duty to wait in silence until our\nbenefits were returned. Yet even to wise men it would be better to give\nsome hint of what our position required. We ask for help even from\nthe gods themselves, from whose knowledge nothing is hid, although our\nprayers cannot alter their intentions towards us, but can only recall\nthem to their minds. Homer's priest, [Il. i. 39 sqq.] I say, recounts\neven to the gods his duteous conduct and his pious care of their\naltars. The second best form of virtue is to be willing and able to take\nadvice.[Hes. Op. 291.] A horse who is docile and prompt to obey can be\nguided hither and thither by the slightest movement of the reins. Very\nfew men are led by their own reason: those who come next to the best are\nthose who return to the right path in consequence of advice; and these\nwe must not deprive of their guide. When our eyes are covered they still\npossess sight; but it is the light of day which, when admitted to them,\nsummons them to perform their duty: tools lie idle, unless the workman\nuses them to take part in his work. Similarly men's minds contain a good\nfeeling, which, however, lies torpid, either through luxury and disuse,\nor through ignorance of its duties. This we ought to render useful, and\nnot to get into a passion with it, and leave it in its wrong doing, but\nbear with it patiently, just as schoolmasters bear patiently with the\nblunders of forgetful scholars; for as by the prompting of a word or two\ntheir memory is often recalled to the text of the speech which they\nhave to repeat, so men's goodwill can be brought to return kindness by\nreminding them of it.\nBOOK VI.\nI.\nThere are some things, my most excellent Liberalis, which lie completely\noutside of our actual life, and which we only inquire into in order to\nexercise our intellects, while others both give us pleasure while we are\ndiscovering them, and are of use when discovered. I will place all these\nin your hands; you, at your own discretion, may order them either to\nbe investigated thoroughly, or to be reserved, and be used as agreeable\ninterludes. Something will be gained even by those which you dismiss at\nonce, for it is advantageous even to know what subjects are not worth\nlearning. I shall be guided, therefore, by your face: according to its\nexpression, I shall deal with some questions at greater length, and\ndrive others out of court, and put an end to them at once.\nII. It is a question whether a benefit can be taken away from one by\nforce. Some say that it cannot, because it is not a thing, but an act. A\ngift is not the same as the act of giving, any more than a sailor is the\nsame as the act of sailing. A sick man and a disease are not the same\nthing, although no one can be ill without disease; and, similarly,\na benefit itself is one thing, and what any of us receive through a\nbenefit is another. The benefit itself is incorporeal, and never becomes\ninvalid; but its subject-matter changes owners, and passes from hand to\nhand. So, when you take away from anyone what you have given him,\nyou take away the subject-matter only of the benefit, not the benefit\nitself. Nature herself cannot recall what she has given. She may cease\nto bestow benefits, but cannot take them away: a man who dies, yet has\nlived; a man who becomes blind, nevertheless has seen. She can cut off\nher blessings from us in the future, but she cannot prevent our having\nenjoyed them in the past. We are frequently not able to enjoy a benefit\nfor long, but the benefit is not thereby destroyed. Let Nature struggle\nas hard as she please, she cannot give herself retrospective action. A\nman may lose his house, his money, his property--everything to which the\nname of benefit can be given--yet the benefit itself will remain firm\nand unmoved; no power can prevent his benefactor's having bestowed them,\nor his having received them.\nIII. I think that a fine passage in Rabirius's poem, where M. Antonius,\nseeing his fortune deserting him, nothing left him except the privilege\nof dying, and even that only on condition that he used it promptly,\nexclaims,\n\"What I have given, that I now possess!\"\nHow much he might have possessed, had he chosen! These are riches to be\ndepended upon, which through all the turmoil of human life will remain\nsteadfast; and the greater they are, the less envy they will attract.\nWhy are you sparing of your property, as though it were your own? You\nare but the manager of it. All those treasures, which make you swell\nwith pride, and soar above mere mortals, till you forget the weakness of\nyour nature; all that which you lock up in iron-grated treasuries, and\nguard in arms, which you win from other men with their lives, and defend\nat the risk of your own; for which you launch fleets to dye the sea with\nblood, and shake the walls of cities, not knowing what arrows fortune\nmay be preparing for you behind your back; to gain which you have so\noften violated all the ties of relationship, of friendship, and of\ncolleagueship, till the whole world lies crushed between the two\ncombatants: all these are not yours; they are a kind of deposit, which\nis on the point of passing into other hands: your enemies, or your\nheirs, who are little better, will seize upon them. \"How,\" do you ask,\n\"can you make them your own?\" \"By giving them away.\" Do, then, what is\nbest for your own interests, and gain a sure enjoyment of them, which\ncannot be taken from you, making them at once more certainly yours, and\nmore honorable to you. That which you esteem so highly, that by which\nyou think that you are made rich and powerful, owns but the shabby title\nof \"house,\" \"slave,\" or \"money;\" but when you have given it away, it\nbecomes a benefit.\nIV. \"You admit,\" says our adversary, \"that we sometimes are under no\nobligation to him from whom we have received a benefit. In that case it\nhas been taken by force.\" Nay, there are many things which would cause\nus to cease to feel gratitude for a benefit, not because the benefit has\nbeen taken from me, but because it has been spoiled. Suppose that a man\nhas defended me in a lawsuit, but has forcibly outraged my wife; he has\nnot taken away the benefit which he conferred upon me, but by balancing\nit with an equivalent wrong, he has set me free from my debt; indeed, if\nhe has injured me more than he had previously benefited me, he not only\nputs an end to my gratitude, but makes me free to revenge myself upon\nhim, and to complain of him, when the wrong outweighs the benefit; in\nsuch a case the benefit is not taken away, but is overcome. Why, are\nnot some fathers so cruel and so wicked that it is right and proper for\ntheir sons to turn away from them, and disown them? Yet, pray, have they\ntaken away the life which they gave? No, but their unnatural conduct in\nlater years has destroyed all the gratitude which was due to them for\ntheir original benefit. In these cases it is not a benefit itself, but\nthe gratitude owing for a benefit which is taken away, and the result\nis, not that one does not possess the benefit, but that one is not laid\nunder any obligation by it. It is as though a man were to lend me money,\nand then burn my house down; the advantage of the loan is balanced by\nthe damage which he has caused: I do not repay him, and yet I am not\nin his debt. In like manner any one who may have acted kindly and\ngenerously to me, and who afterwards has shown himself haughty,\ninsulting, and cruel, places me in just the same position as though I\nnever had received anything from him: he has murdered his own benefits.\nThough the lease may remain in force, still a man does not continue to\nbe a tenant if his landlord tramples down his crops, or cuts down his\norchard; their contract is at an end, not because the landlord has\nreceived the rent which was agreed upon, but because he has made it\nimpossible that he should receive it. So, too, a creditor often has to\npay money to his debtor, should he have taken more property from him in\nother transactions than he claims as having lent him. The judge does not\nsit merely to decide between debtor and creditor, when he says, \"You did\nlend the man money; but then, what followed? You have driven away his\ncattle, you have murdered his slave, you have in your possession plate\nwhich you have not paid for. After valuing what each has received,\nI order you, who came to this court as a creditor, to leave it as\na debtor.\" In like manner a balance is struck between benefits and\ninjuries. In many cases, I repeat, a benefit is not taken away from him\nwho receives it, and yet it lays him under no obligation, if the giver\nhas repented of giving it, called himself unhappy because he gave it,\nsighed or made a wry face while he gave it; if he thought that he was\nthrowing it away rather than giving it, if he gave it to please himself,\nor to please any one except me, the receiver; if he persistently makes\nhimself offensive by boasting of what he has done, if he brags of his\ngift everywhere, and makes it a misery to me, then indeed the benefit\nremains in my hands, but I owe him nothing for it, just as sums of money\nto which a creditor has no legal right are owed to him, but cannot be\nclaimed by him.\nV. Though you have bestowed a benefit upon me, yet you have since\ndone me a wrong; the benefit demanded gratitude, the wrong required\nvengeance: the result is that I do not owe you gratitude, nor do you\nowe me compensation--each is cancelled by the other. When we say, \"I\nreturned him his benefit,\" we do not mean that we restored to him the\nvery thing which we had received, but something else in its place. To\nreturn is to give back one thing instead of another, because, of course,\nin all repayment it is not the thing itself, but its equivalent which\nis returned. We are said to have returned money even though we count out\ngold pieces instead of silver ones, or even if no money passes between\nus, but the transaction be effected verbally by the assignment of a\ndebt.\nI think I see you say, \"You are wasting your time; of what use is it\nto me to know whether what I do not owe to another still remains in my\nhands or not? These are like the ingenious subtleties of the lawyers,\nwho declare that one cannot acquire an inheritance by prescription,\nbut can only acquire those things of which the inheritance consists, as\nthough there were any difference between the heritage and the things of\nwhich it consists. Rather decide this point for me, which may be of\nuse. If the same man confers a benefit upon me, and afterwards does me\na wrong, is it my duty to return the benefit to him, and nevertheless to\navenge myself upon him, having, as it were, two distinct accounts open\nwith him, or to mix them both together, and do nothing, leaving the\nbenefit to be wiped out by the injury, the injury by the benefit? I see\nthat the former course is adopted by the law of the land; you know\nbest what the law may be among you Stoic philosophers in such a case. I\nsuppose that you keep the action which I bring against another distinct\nfrom that which he Strings against me, and the two processes are not\nmerged into one? For instance, if a man entrusts me with money, and\nafterwards robs me, I shall bring an action against him for theft, and\nhe will bring one against me for unlawfully detaining his property?\"\nVI. The cases which you have mentioned, my Liberalis, come under\nwell-established laws, which it is necessary for us to follow. One law\ncannot be merged in another: each one proceeds its own way. There is a\nparticular action which deals with deposits just as there is one which\ndeals with theft. A benefit is subject to no law; it depends upon my\nown arbitration. I am at liberty to contrast the amount of good or\nharm which any one may have done me, and then to decide which of us is\nindebted to the other. In legal processes we ourselves have no power, we\nmust go whither they lead us; in the case of a benefit the supreme\npower is mine, I pronounce sentence. Consequently I do not separate or\ndistinguish between benefits and wrongs, but send them before the same\njudge. Unless I did so, you would bid me love and hate, give thanks and\nmake complaints at the same time, which human nature does not admit of.\nI would rather compare the benefit and the injury with one another, and\nsee whether there were any balance in my favour. If anybody puts lines\nof other writing upon my manuscript he conceals, though he does not take\naway, the letters which were there before, and in like manner a wrong\ncoming after a benefit does not allow it to be seen.\nVII. Your face, by which I have agreed to be guided, now becomes\nwrinkled with frowns, as though I were straying too widely from the\nsubject. You seem to say to me:\n\"Why steer to seaward?\nHither bend thy course,\nHug close the shore...\"\nI do hug it as close as possible. So now, if you think that we have\ndwelt sufficiently upon this point, let us proceed to the consideration\nof the next--that is, whether we are at all indebted to any one who\ndoes us good without wishing to do so. I might have expressed this\nmore clearly, if it were not right that the question should be somewhat\nobscurely stated, in order that by the distinction immediately following\nit may be shown that we mean to investigate the case both of him who\ndoes us good against his will, and that of him who does us good without\nknowing it. That a man who does us good by acting under compulsion does\nnot thereby lay us under any obligation, is so clear, that no words\nare needed to prove it. Both this question, and any other of the like\ncharacter which may be raised, can easily be settled if in each case we\nbear in mind that, for anything to be a benefit, it must reach us in the\nfirst place through some thought, and secondly through the thought of a\nfriend and well-wisher. Therefore we do not feel any gratitude towards\nrivers, albeit they may bear large ships, afford an ample and unvarying\nstream for the conveyance of merchandise, or flow beauteously and full\nof fish through fertile fields. No one conceives himself to be indebted\nfor a benefit to the Nile, any more than he would owe it a grudge if its\nwaters flooded his fields to excess, and retired more slowly than usual;\nthe wind does not bestow benefits, gentle and favorable though it\nmay be, nor does wholesome and useful food; for he who would bestow a\nbenefit upon me, must not only do me good, but must wish to do so. No\nobligation can therefore be incurred towards dumb animals; yet how many\nmen have been saved from peril by the swiftness of a horse!--nor\nyet towards trees--yet how many sufferers from summer heat have been\nsheltered by the thick foliage of a tree! What difference can it make,\nwhether I have profited by the act of one who did not know that he was\ndoing me good, or one who could not know it, when in each case the will\nto do me good was wanting? You might as well bid me be grateful to a\nship, a carriage, or a lance for saving me from danger, as bid me be\ngrateful to a man who may have done me good by chance, but with no more\nintention of doing me good than those things could have.\nVIII. Some men may receive benefits without knowing it, but no man can\nbestow them without knowing it. Many sick persons have been cured by\nchance circumstances, which do not therefore become specific remedies;\nas, for instance, one man was restored to health by falling into a river\nduring very cold weather, as another was set free from a quartan fever\nby means of a flogging, because the sudden terror turned his attention\ninto a new channel, so that the dangerous hours passed unnoticed. Yet\nnone of these are remedies, even though they may have been\nsuccessful; and in like manner some men do us good, though they are\nunwilling--indeed, because they are unwilling to do so--yet we need not\nfeel grateful to them as though we had received a benefit from them,\nbecause fortune has changed the evil which they intended into good. Do\nyou suppose that I am indebted to a man who strikes my enemy with a blow\nwhich he aimed at me, who would have injured me had he not missed his\nmark? It often happens that by openly perjuring himself a man makes even\ntrustworthy witnesses disbelieved, and renders his intended victim an\nobject of compassion, as though he were being ruined by a conspiracy.\nSome have been saved by the very power which was exerted to crush\nthem, and judges who would have condemned a man by law, have refused\nto condemn him by favour. Yet they did not confer a benefit upon the\naccused, although they rendered him a service, because we must\nconsider at what the dart was aimed, not what it hits, and a benefit\nis distinguished from an injury not by its result, but by the spirit in\nwhich it was meant. By contradicting himself, by irritating the judge by\nhis arrogance, or by rashly allowing his whole case to depend upon the\ntestimony of one witness, my opponent may have saved my cause. I do not\nconsider whether his mistakes benefited me or not, for he wished me ill.\nIX. In order that I may be grateful, I must wish to do what my\nbenefactor must have wished in order that he might bestow a benefit. Can\nanything be more unjust than to bear a grudge against a person who may\nhave trodden upon one's foot in a crowd, or splashed one, or pushed one\nthe way which one did not wish to go? Yet it was by his act that we were\ninjured, and we only refrain from complaining of him, because he did not\nknow what he was doing. The same reason makes it possible for men to do\nus good without conferring benefits upon us, or to harm us without doing\nus wrong, because it is intention which distinguishes our friends\nfrom our enemies. How many have been saved from service in the army by\nsickness! Some men have been saved from sharing the fall of their house,\nby being brought up upon their recognizances to a court of law by their\nenemies; some have been saved by ship-wreck from falling into the hands\nof pirates; yet we do not feel grateful to such things, because chance\nhas no feeling of the service it renders, nor are we grateful to our\nenemy, though his lawsuit, while it harassed and detained us, still\nsaved our lives. Nothing can be a benefit which does not proceed from\ngood will, and which is not meant as such by the giver. If any one\ndoes me a service, without knowing it, I am under no obligation to him;\nshould he do so, meaning to injure me, I shall imitate his conduct.\nX. Let us turn our attention to the first of these. Can you desire me to\ndo anything to express my gratitude to a man who did nothing in order to\nconfer a benefit upon me? Passing on to the next, do you wish me to show\nmy gratitude to such a man, and of my own will to return to him what I\nreceived from him against his will? What am I to say of the third, he\nwho, meaning to do an injury, blunders into bestowing a benefit? That\nyou should have wished to confer a benefit upon me is not sufficient\nto render me grateful; but that you should have wished not to do so is\nenough to set me free from any obligation to you. A mere wish does not\nconstitute a benefit; and just as the best and heartiest wish is not a\nbenefit when fortune prevents its being carried into effect, neither is\nwhat fortune bestows upon us a benefit, unless good wishes preceded\nit. In order to lay me under an obligation, you must not merely do me a\nservice, but you must do so intentionally.\nXI. Cleanthes makes use of the following example:--\"I sent,\" says he,\n\"two slaves to look for Plato and bring him to me from the Academy. One\nof them searched through the whole of the colonnade, and every other\nplace in which he thought that he was likely to be found, and returned\nhome alike weary and unsuccessful; the other sat down among the audience\nof a mountebank close by, and, while amusing himself in the society of\nother slaves like a careless vagabond as he was, found Plato, without\nseeking for him, as he happened to pass that way. We ought,\" says he,\n\"to praise that slave who, as far as lay in his power, did what he was\nordered, and we ought to punish the other whose laziness turned out so\nfortunate.\" It is goodwill alone which does one real service; let us\nthen consider under what conditions it lays us under obligations. It is\nnot enough to wish a man well, without doing him good; nor is it enough\nto do him good without wishing him well. Suppose that some one wished to\ngive me a present, but did not give it; I have his good will, but I\ndo not have his benefit, which consists of subject matter and goodwill\ntogether. I owe nothing to one who wished to lend me money but did not\ndo so, and in like manner I shall be the friend of one who wished but\nwas not able to bestow a benefit upon me, but I shall not be under any\nobligation to him. I also shall wish to bestow something upon him, even\nas he did upon me; but if fortune be more favorable to me than to him,\nand I succeed in bestowing something upon him, my doing so will be a\nbenefit bestowed upon him, not a repayment out of gratitude for what he\ndid for me. It will become his duty to be grateful to me; I shall have\nbegun the interchange of benefits; the series must be counted from my\nact.\nXII. I already understand what you wish to ask; there is no need for you\nto say anything, your countenance speaks for you. \"If any one does us\ngood for his own sake, are we,\" you ask, \"under an obligation to him? I\noften hear you complain that there are some things which men make use\nof themselves, but which they put down to the account of others.\" I will\ntell you, my Liberalis; but first let me distinguish between the two\nparts of your question, and separate what is fair from what is unfair.\nIt makes a great difference whether any one bestows a benefit upon us\nfor his own sake, or whether he does so partly for his own sake and\npartly for ours. He who looks only to his own interests, and who does us\ngood because he cannot otherwise make a profit for himself, seems to\nme to be like the farmer who provides winter and summer fodder for his\nflocks, or like the man who feeds up the captives whom he has bought\nin order that they may fetch a better price in the slave market, or who\ncrams and curry-combs fat oxen for sale; or like the keeper of a\nschool of arms, who takes great pains in exercising and equipping his\ngladiators. As Cleanthes says, there is a great difference between\nbenefits and trade.\nXIII. On the other hand, I am not so unjust as to feel no gratitude to\na man, because, while helping me, he helped himself also; for I do\nnot insist upon his consulting my interests to the exclusion of his\nown--nay, I should prefer that the benefit which I receive may be of\neven greater advantage to the giver, provided that he thought of us\nboth when giving it, and meant to divide it between me and himself. Even\nshould he possess the larger portion of it, still, if he admits me to\na share, if he meant it for both of us, I am not only unjust but\nungrateful, if I do not rejoice in what has benefited me benefiting him\nalso. It is the essence of spitefulness to say that nothing can be a\nbenefit which does not cause some inconvenience to the giver.\nAs for him who bestows a benefit for his own sake, I should say to him,\n\"You have made use of me, and how can you say that you have bestowed a\nbenefit upon me, rather than I upon you?\" \"Suppose,\" answers he, \"that I\ncannot obtain a public office except by ransoming ten citizens out of a\ngreat number of captives, will you owe me nothing for setting you free\nfrom slavery and bondage? Yet I shall do so for my own sake.\" To this I\nshould answer, \"You do this partly for my sake, partly for your own.\nIt is for your own sake that you ransom captives, but it is for my sake\nthat you ransom me; for to serve your purpose it would be enough for you\nto ransom any one. I am therefore your debtor, not for ransoming me\nbut for choosing me, since you might have attained the same result by\nransoming some one else instead of me. You divide the advantages of the\nact between yourself and me, and you confer upon me a benefit by which\nboth of us profit. What you do entirely for my sake is, that you choose\nme in preference to others. If therefore you were to be made praetor for\nransoming ten captives, and there were only ten of us captives, none of\nus would be under any obligation to you, because there is nothing for\nwhich you can ask any one of us to give you credit apart from your own\nadvantage. I do not regard a benefit jealously and wish it to be given\nto myself alone, but I wish to have a share in it.\"\nXIV. \"Well, then,\" says he, \"suppose that I were to order all your names\nto be put into a ballot-box, and that your name was drawn among those\nwho were to be ransomed, would you owe me nothing?\" Yes, I should owe\nyou something, but very little: how little, I will explain to you. By so\ndoing you do something for my sake, in that you grant me the chance of\nbeing ransomed; I owe to fortune that my name was drawn, all I owe\nto you is that my name could be drawn. You have given me the means\nof obtaining your benefit. For the greater part of that benefit I am\nindebted to fortune; that I could be so indebted, I owe to you.\nI shall take no notice whatever of those whose benefits are bestowed\nin a mercenary spirit, who do not consider to whom, but upon what terms\nthey give, whose benefits are entirely selfish. Suppose that some one\nsells me corn; I cannot live unless I buy it; yet I do not owe my life\nto him because I have bought it. I do not consider how essential it was\nto me, and that I could not live without it; but how little thanks are\ndue for it, since I could not have had it without paying for it, and\nsince the merchant who imported it did not consider how much good he\nwould do me, but how much he would gain for himself, I owe nothing for\nwhat I have bought and paid for.\nXV. \"According to this reasoning,\" says my opponent, \"you would say\nthat you owe nothing to a physician beyond his paltry fee, nor to your\nteacher, because you have paid him some money; yet these persons are all\nheld very dear, and are very much respected.\" In answer to this I should\nurge that some things are of greater value than the price which we pay\nfor them. You buy of a physician life and good health, the value of\nwhich cannot be estimated in money; from a teacher of the liberal\nsciences you buy the education of a gentleman and mental culture;\ntherefore you pay these persons the price, not of what they give us, but\nof their trouble in giving it; you pay them for devoting their attention\nto us, for disregarding their own affairs to attend to us: they receive\nthe price, not of their services, but of the expenditure of their time.\nYet this may be more truly stated in another way, which I will at once\nlay before you, having first pointed out how the above may be confuted.\nOur adversary would say, \"If some things are of greater value than the\nprice which we pay for them, then, though you may have bought them, you\nstill owe me something more for them.\" I answer, in the first place,\nwhat does their real value matter, since the buyer and seller have\nsettled the price between them? Next, I did not buy it at it's own\nprice, but at yours. \"It is,\" you say, \"worth more than its sale price.\"\nTrue, but it cannot be sold for more. The price of everything varies\naccording to circumstances; after you have well praised your wares, they\nare worth only the highest price at which you can sell them; a man who\nbuys things cheap is not on that account under any obligation to the\nseller. In the next place, even if they are worth more, there is no\ngenerosity in your letting them go for less, since the price is settled\nby custom and the rate of the market, not by the uses and powers of the\nmerchandise. What would you state to be the proper payment of a man who\ncrosses the seas, holding a true course through the midst of the waves\nafter the land has sunk out of sight, who foresees coming storms, and\nsuddenly, when no one expects danger, orders sails to be furled, yards\nto be lowered, and the crew to stand at their posts ready to meet the\nfury of the unexpected gale? and yet the price of such great skill is\nfully paid for by the passage money. At what sum can you estimate the\nvalue of a lodging in a wilderness, of a shelter in the rain, of a bath\nor fire in cold weather? Yet I know on what terms I shall be supplied\nwith these when I enter an inn. How much the man does for us who props\nour house when it is about to fall, and who, with a skill beyond belief,\nsuspends in the air a block of building which has begun to crack at the\nfoundation; yet we can contract for underpinning at a fixed and cheap\nrate. The city wall keeps us safe from our enemies, and from sudden\ninroads of brigands; yet it is, well known how much a day a smith\nwould earn for erecting towers and scaffoldings [Footnote: See\nViollet-le-Duc's \"Dictionnaire d'Architecture,\" articles \"Architecture\nMilitaire\" and \"Hourds,\" for the probable meaning of \"Propugnacula.\"]to\nprovide for the public safety.\nXVI. I might go on for ever collecting instances to prove that valuable\nthings are sold at a low price. What then? why is it that I owe\nsomething extra both to my physician and to my teacher, and that I do\nnot acquit myself of all obligation to them by paying them their fee? It\nis because they pass from physicians and teachers into friends, and lay\nus under obligations, not by the skill which they sell to us, but by\nkindly and familiar good will. If my physician does no more than feel\nmy pulse and class me among those whom he sees in his daily rounds,\npointing out what I ought to do or to avoid without any personal\ninterest, then I owe him no more than his fee, because he views me with\nthe eye not of a friend, but of a commander. [Footnote: I read \"Nbn\ntamquam amicus videt sed tamquam imperator.\"] Neither have I any reason\nfor loving my teacher, if he has regarded me merely as one of the mass\nof his scholars, and has not thought me worthy of taking especial pains\nwith by myself, if he has never fixed his attention upon me, and if when\nhe discharged his knowledge on the public, I might be said rather to\nhave picked it up than to have learnt it from him. What then is our\nreason for owing them much? It is, not that what they have sold us is\nworth more than we paid for it, but that they have given something to us\npersonally. Suppose that my physician has spent more consideration upon\nmy case than was professionally necessary; that it was for me, not for\nhis own credit, that he feared: that he was not satisfied with pointing\nout remedies, but himself applied them, that he sat by my bedside among\nmy anxious friends, and came to see me at the crises of my disorder;\nthat no service was too troublesome or too disgusting for him to\nperform; that he did not hear my groans unmoved; that among the numbers\nwho called for him I was his favourite case; and that he gave the others\nonly so much time as his care of my health permitted him: I should feel\nobliged to such a man not as to a physician, but as to a friend. Suppose\nagain that my teacher endured labour and weariness in instructing me;\nthat he taught me something more than is taught by all masters alike;\nthat he roused my better feelings by his encouragement, and that at\none time he would raise my spirits by praise, and at another warn me\nto shake off slothfulness: that he laid his hand, as it were, upon my\nlatent and torpid powers of intellect and drew them out into the light\nof day; that he did not stingily dole out to me what he knew, in order\nthat he might be wanted for a longer time, but was eager, if possible,\nto pour all his learning into me; then I am ungrateful, if I do not love\nhim as much as I love my nearest relatives and my dearest friends.\nXVII. We give something additional even to those who teach the meanest\ntrades, if their efforts appear to be extraordinary; we bestow a\ngratuity upon pilots, upon workmen who deal with the commonest materials\nand hire themselves out by the day. In the noblest arts, however, those\nwhich either preserve or beautify our lives, a man would be ungrateful\nwho thinks he owes the artist no more than he bargained for. Besides\nthis, the teaching of such learning as we have spoken of blends mind\nwith mind; now when this takes place, both in the case of the physician\nand of the teacher the price of his work is paid, but that of his mind\nremains owing.\nXVIII. Plato once crossed a river, and as the ferryman did not ask him\nfor anything, he supposed that he had let him pass free out of respect,\nand said that the ferryman had laid Plato under an obligation. Shortly\nafterwards, seeing the ferryman take one person after another across the\nriver with the same pains, and without charging anything, Plato declared\nthat the ferryman had not laid him under an obligation. If you wish me\nto be grateful for what you give, you must not merely give it to me, but\nshow that you mean it specially for me; you cannot make any claim upon\none for having given him what you fling away broad-cast among the crowd.\nWhat then? shall I owe you nothing for it? Nothing, as an individual; I\nwill pay, when the rest of mankind do, what I owe no more than they.\nXIX. \"Do you say,\" inquires my opponent, \"that he who carries me gratis\nin a boat across the river Po, does not bestow any benefit upon me?\" I\ndo. He does me some good, but he does not bestow a benefit upon me; for\nhe does it for his own sake, or at any rate not for mine; in short, he\nhimself does not imagine that he is bestowing a benefit upon me, but\ndoes it for the credit of the State, or of the neighbourhood, or of\nhimself, and expects some return for doing so, different from what he\nwould receive from individual passengers. \"Well,\" asks my opponent, \"if\nthe emperor were to grant the franchise to all the Gauls, or exemption,\nfrom taxes to all the Spaniards, would each individual of them owe him\nnothing on that account?\" Of course he would: but he would be indebted\nto him, not as having personally received a benefit intended for himself\nalone, but as a partaker in one conferred upon his nation. He would\nargue, \"The emperor had no thought of me at the time when he benefited\nus all; he did not care to give me the franchise separately, he did not\nfix his attention upon me; why then should I be grateful to one who did\nnot have me in his mind when he was thinking of doing what he did? In\nanswer to this, I say that when he thought of doing good to all the\nGauls, he thought of doing good to me also, for I was a Gaul, and he\nincluded me under my national, if not under my personal appellation. In\nlike manner, I should feel grateful to him, not as for a personal, but\nfor a general benefit; being only one of the people, I should regard\nthe debt of gratitude as incurred, not by myself, but by my country, and\nshould not pay it myself, but only contribute my share towards doing so.\nI do not call a man my creditor because he has lent money to my country,\nnor should I include that money in a schedule of my debts were I either\na candidate for a public office, or a defendant in the courts; yet I\nwould pay my share towards extinguishing such a debt. Similarly, I deny\nthat I am laid under an obligation by a gift bestowed upon my entire\nnation, because although the giver gave it to me, yet he did not do so\nfor my sake, but gave it without knowing whether he was giving it to me\nor not: nevertheless I should feel that I owed something for the\ngift, because it did reach me, though not directly. To lay me under an\nobligation, a thing must be done for my sake alone.\"\nXX. \"According to this,\" argues our opponent, \"you are under no\nobligation to the sun or the moon; for they do not move for your sake\nalone.\" No, but since they move with the object of preserving the\nbalance of the universe, they move for my sake also, seeing that I am\na fraction of the universe. Besides, our position and theirs is not the\nsame, for he who does me good in order that he may by my means do good\nto himself, does not bestow a benefit upon me, because he merely makes\nuse of me as an instrument for his own advantage; whereas the sun and\nthe moon, even if they do us good for their own sakes, still cannot do\ngood to us in order that by our means they may do good to themselves,\nfor what is there which we can bestow upon them?\nXXI. \"I should be sure,\" replies he, \"that the sun and the moon wished\nto do us good, if they were able to refuse to do so; but they cannot\nhelp moving as they do. In short, let them stop and discontinue their\nwork.\"\nSee now, in how many ways this argument may be refuted. One who cannot\nrefuse to do a thing may nevertheless wish to do it; indeed there is no\ngreater proof of a fixed desire to do anything, than not to be able to\nalter one's determination. A good man cannot leave undone what he does:\nfor unless he does it he will not be a good man. Is a good man, then,\nnot able to bestow a benefit, because he does what he ought to do, and\nis not able not to do what he ought to do? Besides this, it makes\na great difference whether you say, \"He is not able not to do this,\nbecause he is forced to do it,\" or \"He is not able to wish not to do\nit;\" for, if he could not help doing it, then I am not indebted for it\nto him, but to the person who forced him to do it; if he could not help\nwishing for it because he had nothing better to wish for, then it is he\nwho forces himself to do it, and in this case the debt which as acting\nunder compulsion he could not claim, is due to him as compelling\nhimself.\n\"Let the sun and moon cease to wish to benefit us,\" says our adversary.\nI answer, \"Remember what has been said. Who can be so crazy as to refuse\nthe name of free-will to that which has no danger of ceasing to act, and\nof adopting the opposite course, since, on the contrary, he whose will\nis fixed for ever, must be thought to wish more earnestly than any one\nelse. Surely if he, who may at any moment change his mind, can be said\nto wish, we must not deny the existence of will in a being whose nature\ndoes not admit of change of mind.\"\nXXII. \"Well,\" says he \"let them stop, if it be possible.\" What you say\nis this:--\"Let all those heavenly bodies, placed as they are at vast\ndistances from each other, and arranged to preserve the balance of the\nuniverse, leave their appointed posts: let sudden confusion arise,\nso that constellations may collide with constellations, that the\nestablished harmony of all things may be destroyed and the works of God\nbe shaken into ruin; let the whole frame of the rapidly moving heavenly\nbodies abandon in mid career those movements which we were assured would\nendure for ages, and let those which now by their regular advance and\nretreat keep the world at a moderate temperature, be instantly consumed\nby fire, so that instead of the infinite variety of the seasons all may\nbe reduced to one uniform condition; let fire rage everywhere, followed\nby dull night, and let the bottomless abyss swallow up all the gods.\" Is\nit worth while to destroy all this merely in order to refute you? Even\nthough you do not wish it, they do you good, and they wheel in their\ncourses for your sake, though their motion may be due to some earlier\nand more important cause.\nXXIII. Besides this, the gods act under no external constraint, but\ntheir own will is a law to them for all time. They have established an\norder which is not to be changed, and consequently it is impossible that\nthey should appear to be likely to do anything against their will, since\nthey wish to continue doing whatever they cannot cease from doing, and\nthey never regret their original decision, No doubt it is impossible for\nthem to stop short, or to desert to the other side, but it is so for no\nother reason than that their own force holds them to their purpose. It\nis from no weakness that they persevere; no, they have no mind to leave\nthe best course, and by this it is fated that they should proceed. When,\nat the time of the original creation, they arranged the entire universe,\nthey paid attention to us as well as to the rest, and took thought about\nthe human race; and for this reason we cannot suppose that it is merely\nfor their own pleasure that they move in their orbits and display their\nwork since we also are a part of that work. We are, therefore; under\nan obligation to the sun and moon and the rest of the heavenly host,\nbecause, although they may rise in order to bestow more important\nbenefits than those which we receive from them, yet they do bestow these\nupon us as they pass on their way to greater things. Besides this, they\nassist us of set purpose, and, therefore, lay us under an obligation,\nbecause we do not in their case stumble by chance upon a benefit\nbestowed by one who knew not what he was doing, but they knew that we\nshould receive from them the advantages which we do; so that, though\nthey may have some higher aim, though the result of their movements may\nbe something of greater importance than the preservation of the human\nrace, yet from the beginning thought has been directed to our comforts,\nand the scheme of the world has been arranged in a fashion which proves\nthat our interests were neither their least nor last concern. It is our\nduty to show filial love for our parents, although many of them had no\nthought of children when they married. Not so with the gods: they cannot\nbut have known what they were doing when they furnished mankind with\nfood and comforts. Those for whose advantage so much was created, could\nnot have been created without design. Nature conceived the idea of us\nbefore she formed us, and, indeed, we are no such trifling piece of work\nas could have fallen from her hands unheeded. See how great privileges\nshe has bestowed upon us, how far beyond the human race the empire of\nmankind extends; consider how widely she allows us to roam, not having\nrestricted us to the land alone, but permitted us to traverse every part\nof herself; consider, too, the audacity of our intellect, the only one\nwhich knows of the gods or seeks for them, and how we can raise our mind\nhigh above the earth, and commune with those divine influences: you will\nperceive that man is not a hurriedly put together, or an unstudied piece\nof work. Among her noblest products nature has none of which she can\nboast more than man, and assuredly no other which can comprehend her\nboast. What madness is this, to call the gods in question for their\nbounty? If a man declares that he has received nothing when he is\nreceiving all the while, and from those who will always be giving\nwithout ever receiving anything in return, how will he be grateful to\nthose whose kindness cannot be returned without expense? and how great a\nmistake is it not to be thankful to a giver, because he is good even to\nhim who disowns him, or to use the fact of his bounty being poured upon\nus in an uninterrupted stream, as an argument to prove that he cannot\nhelp bestowing it. Suppose that such men as these say, \"I do not want\nit,\" \"Let him keep it to himself,\" \"Who asks him for it?\" and so forth,\nwith all the other speeches of insolent minds: still, he whose bounty\nreaches you, although you say that it does not, lays you under an\nobligation nevertheless; indeed, perhaps the greatest part of the\nbenefit which he bestows is that he is ready to give even when you are\ncomplaining against him.\nXXIV. Do you not see how parents force children during their infancy\nto undergo what is useful for their health? Though the children cry and\nstruggle, they swathe them and bind their limbs straight lest premature\nliberty should make them grow crooked, afterwards instill into them a\nliberal education, threatening those who are unwilling to learn, and\nfinally, if spirited young men do not conduct themselves frugally,\nmodestly, and respectably, they compel them to do so. Force and harsh\nmeasures are used even to youths who have grown up and are their own\nmasters, if they, either from fear or from insolence, refuse to take\nwhat is good for them. Thus the greatest benefits that we receive,\nwe receive either without knowing it, or against our will, from our\nparents.\nXXV. Those persons who are ungrateful and repudiate benefits, not\nbecause they do not wish to receive them, but in order that they may not\nbe laid under an obligation for them, are like those who fall into the\nopposite extreme, and are over grateful, who pray that some trouble or\nmisfortune may befall their benefactors to give them an opportunity\nof proving how gratefully they remember the benefit which they have\nreceived. It is a question whether they are right, and show a truly\ndutiful feeling; their state of mind is morbid, like that of frantic\nlovers who long for their mistress to be exiled, that they may accompany\nher when she leaves her country forsaken by all her friends, or that she\nmay be poor in order that she may the more need what they give her, or\nwho long that she may be ill in order that they may sit by her bedside,\nand who, in short, out of sheer love form the same wishes as her enemies\nwould wish for her. Thus the results of hatred and of frantic love are\nvery nearly the same; and these lovers are very like those who hope that\ntheir friends may meet with difficulties which they may remove, and who\nthus do a wrong that they may bestow a benefit, whereas it would have\nbeen much better for them to do nothing, than by a crime to gain an\nopportunity of doing good service. What should we say of a pilot who\nprayed to the gods for dreadful storms and tempests, in order that\ndanger might make his skill more highly esteemed? what of a general who\nshould pray that a vast number of the enemy surround his camp, fill\nthe ditches by a sudden charge, tear down the rampart round his\npanic-stricken army, and plant its hostile standards at the very gates,\nin order that he might gain more glory by restoring his broken ranks and\nshattered fortunes? All such men confer their benefits upon us by odious\nmeans, for they beg the gods to harm those whom they mean to help, and\nwish them to be struck down before they raise them up; it is a cruel\nfeeling, brought about by a distorted sense of gratitude, to wish evil\nto befall one whom one is bound in honour to succour.\nXXVI. \"My wish,\" argues our opponent, \"does him no harm, because when\nI wish for the danger I wish for the rescue at the same time.\" What you\nmean by this is not that you do no wrong, but that you do less than if\nyou wished that the danger might befall him, without wishing for the\nrescue. It is wicked to throw a man into the water in order that you may\npull him out, to throw him down that you may raise him up, or to shut\nhim up that you may release him. You do not bestow a benefit upon a man\nby ceasing to wrong him, nor can it ever be a piece of good service to\nanyone to remove from him a burden which you yourself imposed on him.\nTrue, you may cure the hurt which you inflict, but I had rather that you\ndid not hurt me at all. You may gain my gratitude by curing me because I\nam wounded, but not by wounding me in order that you may cure me: no man\nlikes scars except as compared with wounds, which he is glad to see thus\nhealed, though he had rather not have received them. It would be cruel\nto wish such things to befall one from whom you had never received a\nkindness; how much more cruel is it to wish that they may befall one in\nwhose debt you are.\nXXVII. \"I pray,\" replies he, \"at the same time, that I may be able to\nhelp him.\" In the first place, if I stop you short in the middle of your\nprayer, it shows at once that you are ungrateful: I have not yet heard\nwhat you wish to do for him; I have heard what you wish him to suffer.\nYou pray that anxiety and fear and even worse evil than this may come\nupon him. You desire that he may need aid: this is to his disadvantage;\nyou desire that he may need your aid: this is to your advantage. You do\nnot wish to help him, but to be set free from your obligation to him:\nfor when you are eager to repay your debt in such a way as this, you\nmerely wish to be set free from the debt, not to repay it. So the only\npart of your wish that could be thought honourable proves to be the base\nand ungrateful feeling of unwillingness to lie under an obligation: for\nwhat you wish for is, not that you may have an opportunity of repaying\nhis kindness, but that he may be forced to beg you to do him a kindness.\nYou make yourself the superior, and you wickedly degrade beneath your\nfeet the man who has done you good service. How much better would it be\nto remain in his debt in an honourable and friendly manner, than to seek\nto discharge the debt by these evil means! You would be less to blame if\nyou denied that you had received it, for your benefactor would then\nlose nothing more than what he gave you, whereas now you wish him to be\nrendered inferior to you, and brought by the loss of his property and\nsocial position into a condition below his own benefits. Do you think\nyourself grateful? Just utter your wishes in the hearing of him to whom\nyou wish to do good. Do you call that a prayer for his welfare, which\ncan be divided between his friend and his enemy, which, if the last part\nwere omitted, you would not doubt was pronounced, by one who opposed and\nhated him? Enemies in war have sometimes wished to capture certain\ntowns in order to spare them, or to conquer certain persons in order\nto pardon, them, yet these were the wishes of enemies, and what was the\nkindest part of them began by cruelty. Finally, what sort of prayers do\nyou think those can be which he, on whose behalf they are made, hopes\nmore earnestly than any one else may not be granted? In hoping that\nthe gods may injure a man, and that you may help him, you deal most\ndishonourably with him, and you do not treat the gods themselves fairly,\nfor you give them the odious part to play, and reserve the generous one\nfor yourself: the gods must do him wrong in order that you may do him\na service. If you were to suborn an informer to accuse a man, and\nafterwards withdrew him, if you engaged a man in a law suit and\nafterwards gave it up, no one would hesitate to call you a villain: what\ndifference does it make, whether you attempt to do this by chicanery\nor by prayer, unless it be that by prayer you raise up more powerful\nenemies to him than by the other means? You cannot say \"Why, what harm\ndo I do him?\" your prayer is either futile or harmful, indeed it is\nharmful even though nothing comes of it. You do your friend wrong by\nwishing him harm: you must thank the gods that you do him no harm. The\nfact of your wishing it is enough: we ought to be just as angry with you\nas if you had effected it.\nXXVIII. \"If,\" argues our adversary, \"my prayers had any efficacy, they\nwould also have been efficacious to save him from danger.\" In the first\nplace, I reply, the danger into which you wish me to fall is certain,\nthe help which I should receive is uncertain. Or call them both certain;\nit is that which injures me that comes first. Besides, YOU understand\nthe terms of your wish; _I_ shall be tossed by the storm without being\nsure that I have a haven of rest at hand.\nThink what torture it must have been to me, even if I receive your help,\nto have stood in need of it: if I escape safely, to have trembled for\nmyself; if I be acquitted, to have had to plead my cause. To escape from\nfear, however great it may be, can never be so pleasant as to live in\nsound unassailable safety. Pray that you may return my kindnesses when I\nneed their return, but do not pray that I may need them. You would have\ndone what you prayed for, had it been in your power.\nXXIX. How far more honourable would a prayer of this sort be: \"I pray\nthat he may remain in such a position as that he may always bestow\nbenefits and never need them: may he be attended by the means of giving\nand helping, of which he makes such a bountiful use; may he never want\nbenefits to bestow, or be sorry for any which he has bestowed; may his\nnature, fitted as it is for acts of pity, goodness, and clemency, be\nstimulated and brought out by numbers of grateful persons, whom I trust\nhe will find without needing to make trial of their gratitude; may\nhe refuse to be reconciled to no one, and may no one require to be\nreconciled to him: may fortune so uniformly continue to favour him that\nno one may be able to return his kindness in any way except by feeling\ngrateful to him.\"\nHow far more proper are such prayers as these, which do not put you off\nto some distant opportunity, but express your gratitude at once? What is\nthere to prevent your returning your benefactor's kindness, even while\nhe is in prosperity? How many ways are there by which we can repay what\nwe owe even to the affluent--for instance, by honest advice, by constant\nintercourse, by courteous conversation, pleasing him without flattering\nhim, by listening attentively to any subject which he may wish to\ndiscuss, by keeping safe any secret that he may impart to us, and by\nsocial intercourse. There is no one so highly placed by fortune as not\nto want a friend all the more because he wants nothing.\nXXX. The other is a melancholy opportunity, and one which we ought\nalways to pray may be kept far from us: must the gods be angry with\na man in order that you may prove your gratitude to him? Do you not\nperceive that you are doing wrong, from the very fact that those to\nwhom you are ungrateful fare better? Call up before your mind dungeons,\nchains, wretchedness, slavery, war, poverty: these are the opportunities\nfor which you pray; if any one has any dealings with you, it is by means\nof these that you square your account. Why not rather wish that he to\nwhom you owe most may be powerful and happy? for, as I have just said,\nwhat is there to prevent your returning the kindness even of those\nwho enjoy the greatest prosperity? to do which, ample and various\nopportunities will present themselves to you, What! do you not know that\na debt can be paid even to a rich man? Nor will I trouble you with many\ninstances of what you may do. Though a man's riches and prosperity may\nprevent your making him any other repayment, I will show you what the\nhighest in the land stand in need of, what is wanting to those who\npossess everything. They want a man to speak the truth, to save them\nfrom the organized mass of falsehood by which they are beset, which so\nbewilders them with lies that the habit of hearing only what is pleasant\ninstead of what is true, prevents their knowing what truth really is. Do\nyou not see how such persons are driven to ruin by the want of candour\namong their friends, whose loyalty has degenerated into slavish\nobsequiousness? No one, when giving them his advice, tells them what he\nreally thinks, but each vies with the other in flattery; and while the\nman's friends make it their only object to see who can most pleasantly\ndeceive him, he himself is ignorant of his real powers, and, believing\nhimself to be as great a man as he is told that he is, plunges the State\nin useless wars, which bring disasters upon it, breaks off a useful and\nnecessary peace, and, through a passion of anger which no one checks,\nspills the blood of numbers of people, and at last sheds his own.\nSuch persons assert what has never been investigated as certain facts,\nconsider that to modify their opinion is as dishonourable as to be\nconquered, believe that institutions which are just flickering out of\nexistence will last for ever, and, thus overturn great States, to the\ndestruction of themselves and all who are connected with them. Living\nas they do in a fool's paradise, resplendent with unreal and short-lived\nadvantages, they forget that, as soon as they put it out of their power\nto hear the truth, there is no limit to the misfortunes which they may\nexpect.\nXXXI. When Xerxes declared war against Greece, all his courtiers\nencouraged his boastful temper, which forgot how unsubstantial his\ngrounds for confidence were. One declared that the Greeks would not\nendure to hear the news of the declaration of war, and would take to\nflight at the first rumour of his approach; another, that with such a\nvast army Greece could not only be conquered, but utterly overwhelmed,\nand that it was rather to be feared that they would find the Greek\ncities empty and abandoned, and that the panic flight of the enemy\nwould leave them only vast deserts, where no use could be made of their\nenormous forces. Another told him that the world was hardly large enough\nto contain him, that the seas were too narrow for his fleets, the camps\nwould not take in his armies, the plains were not wide enough to deploy\nhis cavalry in, and that the sky itself was scarcely large enough to\nenable all his troops to hurl their darts at once. While much boasting\nof this sort was going on around him, raising his already overweening\nself-confidence to a frantic pitch, Demaratus, the Lacedaemonian,\nalone told him that the disorganized and unwieldy multitude in which he\ntrusted, was in itself a danger to its chief, because it possessed\nonly weight without strength; for an army which is too large cannot\nbe governed, and one which cannot be governed, cannot long exist. \"The\nLacedaemonians,\" said he, \"will meet you upon the first mountain in\nGreece, and will give you a taste of their quality. All these thousands\nof nations of yours will be held in check by three hundred men: they\nwill stand firm at their posts, they will defend the passes entrusted to\nthem with their weapons, and block them up with their bodies: all Asia\nwill not force them to give way; few as they are, they will stop all\nthis terrible invasion, attempted though it be by nearly the whole human\nrace. Though the laws of nature may give way to you, and enable you to\npass from Europe to Asia, yet you will stop short in a bypath; consider\nwhat your losses will be afterwards, when you have reckoned up the price\nwhich you have to pay for the pass of Thermopylae; when you learn that\nyour march can be stayed, you will discover that you may be put to\nflight. The Greeks will yield up many parts of their country to you, as\nif they were swept out of them by the first terrible rush of a mountain\ntorrent; afterwards they will rise against you from all quarters and\nwill crush you by means of your own strength. What people say, that\nyour warlike preparations are too great to be contained in the\ncountries which you intend to attack, is quite true; but this is to our\ndisadvantage. Greece will conquer you for this very reason, that she\ncannot contain you; you cannot make use of the whole of your force.\nBesides this, you will not be able to do what is essential to\nvictory--that is, to meet the manoeuvres of the enemy at once, to\nsupport your own men if they give way, or to confirm and strengthen\nthem when their ranks are wavering; long before you know it, you will\nbe defeated. Moreover, you should not think that because your army is\nso large that its own chief does not know its numbers, it is therefore\nirresistible; there is nothing so great that it cannot perish; nay,\nwithout any other cause, its own excessive size may prove its ruin.\"\nWhat Demaratus predicted came to pass. He whose power gods and men\nobeyed, and who swept away all that opposed him, was bidden to halt by\nthree hundred men, and the Persians, defeated in every part of Greece,\nlearned how great a difference there is between a mob and an army. Thus\nit came to pass that Xerxes, who suffered more from the shame of his\nfailure than from the losses which he sustained, thanked Demaratus for\nhaving been the only man who told him the truth, and permitted him to\nask what boon he pleased. He asked to be allowed to drive a chariot into\nSardis, the largest city in Asia, wearing a tiara erect upon his head,\na privilege which was enjoyed by kings alone. He deserved his reward\nbefore he asked for it, but how wretched must the nation have been, in\nwhich there was no one who would speak the truth to the king except one\nman who did not speak it to himself.\nXXXII. The late Emperor Augustus banished his daughter, whose conduct\nwent beyond the shame of ordinary immodesty, and made public the\nscandals of the imperial house.\nLed away by his passion, he divulged all these crimes which, as emperor,\nhe ought to have kept secret with as much care as he punished them,\nbecause the shame of some deeds asperses even him who avenges them.\nAfterwards, when by lapse of time shame took the place of anger in his\nmind, he lamented that he had not kept silence about matters which he\nhad not learned until it was disgraceful to speak of them, and often\nused to exclaim, \"None of these things would have happened to me, if\neither Agrippa or Maecenas had lived!\" So hard was it for the master\nof so many thousands of men to repair the loss of two. When his legions\nwere slaughtered, new ones were at once enrolled; when his fleet was\nwrecked, within a few days another was afloat; when the public buildings\nwere consumed by fire, finer ones arose in their stead; but the places\nof Agrippa and Maecenas remained unfilled throughout his life. What am I\nto imagine? that there were not any men like these, who could take\ntheir place, or that it was the fault of Augustus himself, who preferred\nmourning for them to seeking for their likes? We have no reason for\nsupposing that it was the habit of Agrippa or Maecenas to speak the\ntruth to him; indeed, if they had lived they would have been as great\ndissemblers as the rest. It is one of the habits of kings to insult\ntheir present servants by praising those whom they have lost, and to\nattribute the virtue of truthful speaking to those from whom there is no\nfurther risk of hearing it.\nXXXIII. However, to return to my subject, you see how easy it is to\nreturn the kindness of the prosperous, and even of those who occupy the\nhighest places of all mankind. Tell them, not what they wish to hear,\nbut what they will wish that they always had heard; though their ears be\nstopped by flatteries, yet sometimes truth may penetrate them; give them\nuseful advice. Do you ask what service you can render to a prosperous\nman? Teach him not to rely upon his prosperity, and to understand that\nit ought to be supported by the hands of many trusty friends. Will you\nnot have done much for him, if you take away his foolish belief that\nhis influence will endure for ever, and teach him that what we gain by\nchance passes away soon, and at a quicker rate than it came; that we\ncannot fall by the same stages by which we rose to the height of good\nfortune, but that frequently between it and ruin there is but one step?\nYou do not know how great is the value of friendship, if you do not\nunderstand how much you give to him to whom you give a friend, a\ncommodity which is scarce not only in men's houses, but in whole\ncenturies, and which is nowhere scarcer than in the places where it is\nthought to be most plentiful. Pray, do you suppose that those books of\nnames, which your nomenclator [Footnote: The nomenclator was a slave\nwho attended his master in canvassing and on similar occasions, for\nthe purpose of telling him the names of whom he met in the street.] can\nhardly carry or remember, are those of friends? It is not your friends\nwho crowd to knock at your door, and who are admitted to your greater or\nlesser levees.\nXXXIV. To divide one's friends into classes is an old trick of kings and\ntheir imitators; it shows great arrogance to think that to touch or\nto pass one's threshold can be a valuable privilege, or to grant as an\nhonour that you should sit nearer one's front door than others, or enter\nhouse before them, although within the house there are many more doors,\nwhich shut out even those who have been admitted so far. With us Gaius\nGracchus, and shortly after him Livius Drusus, were the first to keep\nthemselves apart from the mass of their adherents, and to admit some to\ntheir privacy, some to their more select, and others to their general\nreceptions. These men consequently had friends of the first and second\nrank, and so on, but in none had they true friends. Can you apply the\nname of friend to one who is admitted in his regular order to pay his\nrespects to you? or can you expect perfect loyalty from one who is\nforced to slip into your presence through a grudgingly-opened door? How\ncan a man arrive at using bold freedom of speech with you, if he is only\nallowed in his proper turn to make use of the common phrase, \"Hail to\nyou,\" which is used by perfect strangers? Whenever you go to any of\nthese great men, whose levees interest the whole city, though you find\nall the streets beset with throngs of people, and the passers-by hardly\nable to make their way through the crowd, you may be sure that you\nhave come to a place where there are many men, but no friends of their\npatron. We must not seek our friends in our entrance hall, but in our\nown breast; it is there that he ought to be received, there retained,\nand hoarded up in our minds. Teach this, and you will have repaid your\ndebt of gratitude.\nXXXV. If you are useful to your friend only when he is in distress, and\nare superfluous when all goes well with him, you form a mean estimate\nof your own value. As you can bear yourself wisely both in doubtful,\nin prosperous, and in adverse circumstances, by showing prudence in\ndoubtful cases, courage in misfortune, and self-restraint in good\nfortune, so in all circumstances you can make yourself useful to your\nfriend. Do not desert him in adversity, but do not wish that it may\nbefall him: the various incidents of human life will afford you many\nopportunities of proving your loyalty to him without wishing him evil.\nHe who prays that another may become rich, in order that he may share\nhis riches, really has a view to his own advantage, although his prayers\nare ostensibly offered in behalf of his friend; and similarly he who\nwishes that his friend may get into some trouble from which his own\nfriendly assistance may extricate him--a most ungrateful wish--prefers\nhimself to his friend, and thinks it worthwhile that his friend should\nbe unhappy, in order that he may prove his gratitude. This very wish\nmakes him ungrateful, for he wishes to rid himself of his gratitude as\nthough it were a heavy burden. In returning a kindness it makes a great\ndifference whether you are eager to bestow a benefit, or merely to free\nyourself from a debt. He who wishes to return a benefit will study his\nfriend's interests, and will hope that a suitable occasion will arise;\nhe who only wishes to free himself from an obligation will be eager to\ndo so by any means whatever, which shows very bad feeling. \"Do you say,\"\nwe may be asked, \"that eagerness to repay kindness belongs to a morbid\nfeeling of gratitude?\" I cannot explain my meaning more clearly than\nby repeating what I have already said. You do not want to repay, but to\nescape from the benefit which you have received. You seem to say, \"When\nshall I get free from this obligation? I must strive by any means in my\npower to extinguish my debt to him.\" You would be thought to be far from\ngrateful, if you wished to pay a debt to him with his own money; yet\nthis wish of yours is even more unjust; for you invoke curses upon him,\nand call down terrible imprecations upon the head of one who ought to\nbe held sacred by you. No one, I suppose, would have any doubt of your\nwickedness if you were openly to pray that he might suffer poverty,\ncaptivity, hunger, or fear; yet what is the difference between openly\npraying for some of these things, and silently wishing for them? for\nyou do wish for some of these. Go, and enjoy your belief that this is\ngratitude, to do what not even an ungrateful man would do, supposing he\nconfined himself to repudiating the benefit, and did not go so far as to\nhate his benefactor.\nXXXVI. Who would call Aeneas pious, if he wished that his native\ncity might be captured, in order that he might save his father from\ncaptivity? Who would point to the Sicilian youths as good examples for\nhis children, if they had prayed that Aetna might flame with unusual\nheat and pour forth a vast mass of fire in order to afford them an\nopportunity of displaying their filial affection by rescuing their\nparents from the midst of the conflagration? Rome owes Scipio nothing\nif he kept the Punic War alive in order that he might have the glory of\nfinishing it; she owes nothing to the Decii if they prayed for public\ndisasters, to give themselves an opportunity of displaying their brave\nself-devotion. It is the greatest scandal for a physician to make work\nfor himself; and many who have aggravated the diseases of their patients\nthat they may have the greater credit for curing them, have either\nfailed to cure them, at all or have done so at the cost of the most\nterrible suffering to their victims.\nXXXVII. It is said (at any rate Hecaton tells us) that when Callistratus\nwith many others was driven into exile by his factious and licentiously\nfree country, some one prayed that such trouble might befall the\nAthenians that they would be forced to recall the exiles, on hearing\nwhich, he prayed that God might forbid his return upon such terms. When\nsome one tried to console our own countryman, Rutilius, for his exile,\npointing out that civil war was at hand, and that all exiles would soon\nbe restored to Rome, he answered with even greater spirit, \"What harm\nhave I done you, that you should wish that I may return to my country\nmore unhappily than I quit it? My wish is, that my country should blush\nat my being banished, rather than that she should mourn at my having\nreturned.\" An exile, of which every one is more ashamed than the\nsufferer, is not exile at all. These two persons, who did not wish to be\nrestored to their homes at the cost of a public disaster, but preferred\nthat two should suffer unjustly than that all should suffer alike, are\nthought to have acted like good citizens; and in like manner it does not\naccord with the character of a grateful man, to wish that his benefactor\nmay fall into troubles which he may dispel; because, even though he may\nmean well to him, yet he wishes him evil. To put out a fire which you\nyourself have lighted, will not even gain acquittal for you, let alone\ncredit.\nXXXVIII. In some states an evil wish was regarded as a crime. It is\ncertain that at Athens Demades obtained a verdict against one who sold\nfurniture for funerals, by proving that he had prayed for great gains,\nwhich he could not obtain without the death of many persons. Yet it is\na stock question whether he was rightly found guilty. Perhaps he prayed,\nnot that he might sell his wares to many persons, but that he might sell\nthem dear, or that he might procure what he was going to sell, cheaply.\nSince his business consisted of buying and selling, why should you\nconsider his prayer to apply to one branch of it only, although he made\nprofit from both? Besides this, you might find every one of his trade\nguilty, for they all wish, that is, secretly pray, as he did. You might,\nmoreover, find a great part of the human race guilty, for who is there\nwho does not profit by his neighbour's wants? A soldier, if he wishes\nfor glory, must wish for war; the farmer profits by corn being dear;\na large number of litigants raises the price of forensic eloquence;\nphysicians make money by a sickly season; dealers in luxuries are\nmade rich by the effeminacy of youth; suppose that no storms and no\nconflagrations injured our dwellings, the builder's trade would be at a\nstandstill. The prayer of one man was detected, but it was just like the\nprayers of all other men. Do you imagine that Arruntius and Haterius,\nand all other professional legacy-hunters do not put up the same prayers\nas undertakers and grave-diggers? though the latter know not whose death\nit is that they wish for, while the former wish for the death of their\ndearest friends, from whom, on account of their intimacy, they have most\nhopes of inheriting a fortune. No one's life does the undertaker any\nharm, whereas these men starve if their friends are long about dying;\nthey do not, therefore, merely wish for their deaths in order that they\nmay receive what they have earned by a disgraceful servitude, but in\norder that they may be set free from a heavy tax. There can, therefore,\nbe no doubt that such persons repeat with even greater earnestness the\nprayer for which the undertaker was condemned, for whoever is likely to\nprofit such men by dying, does them an injury by living. Yet the wishes\nof all these are alike well known and unpunished. Lastly, let every man\nexamine his own self, let him look into the secret thoughts of his heart\nand consider what it is that he silently hopes for; how many of his\nprayers he would blush to acknowledge, even to himself; how few there\nare which we could repeat in the presence of witnesses!\nXXXIX. Yet we must not condemn every thing which we find worthy of\nblame, as, for instance, this wish about our friends which we have been\ndiscussing, arises from a misdirected feeling of affection, and falls\ninto the very error which it strives to avoid, for the man is ungrateful\nat the very time when he hurries to prove his gratitude. He prays aloud,\n\"May he fall into my power, may he need my influence, may not be able\nto be safe and respectable without my aid, may he be so unfortunate that\nwhatever return I make to him may be regarded as a benefit.\" To the\ngods alone he adds, \"May domestic treasons encompass him, which can be\nquelled by me alone; may some powerful and virulent enemy, some excited\nand armed mob, assail him; may he be set upon by a creditor or an\ninformer.\"\nXL. See, how just you are; you would never have wished any of these\nmisfortunes to befall him, if he had not bestowed a benefit upon you.\nNot to speak of the graver guilt which you incur by returning evil for\ngood, you distinctly do wrong in not waiting for the fitting time for\neach action, for it is as wrong to anticipate this as it is not to take\nit when it comes. A benefit ought not always to be accepted, and ought\nnot in all cases to be returned. If you were to return it to me against\nmy will, you would be ungrateful, how much more ungrateful are you, if\nyou force me to wish for it? Wait patiently; why are you unwilling to\nlet my bounty abide with you? Why do you chafe at being laid under an\nobligation? why, as though you were dealing with a harsh usurer, are you\nin such a hurry to sign and seal an equivalent bond? Why do you wish me\nto get into trouble? Why do you call upon the gods to ruin me? If this\nis your way of returning a kindness, what would you do if you were\nexacting repayment of a debt?\nXLI. Above all, therefore, my Liberalis, let us learn to live calmly\nunder an obligation to others, and watch for opportunities of repaying\nour debt without manufacturing them. Let us remember that this\nanxiety to seize the first opportunity of setting ourselves free shows\ningratitude; for no one repays with good will that which he is unwilling\nto owe, and his eagerness to get it out of his hands shows that he\nregards it as a burden rather than as a favour. How much better and more\nrighteous is it to bear in mind what we owe to our friends, and to offer\nrepayment, not to obtrude it, nor to think ourselves too much indebted;\nbecause a benefit is a common bond which connects two persons. Say \"I do\nnot delay to repay your kindness to me; I hope that you will accept my\ngratitude cheerfully. If irresistible fate hangs over either of us, and\ndestiny rules either that you must receive your benefit back again, or\nthat I must receive a second benefit, why then, of us two, let him give\nthat was wont to give. I am ready to receive it.\n\"'Tis not the part of Turnus to delay.\"\nThat is the spirit which I shall show whenever the time comes; in the\nmeanwhile the gods shall be my witnesses.\nXLII. I have noted in you, my Liberalis, and as it were touched with my\nhand a feeling of fussy anxiety not to be behindhand in doing what is\nyour duty. This anxiety is not suitable to a grateful mind, which,\non the contrary, produces the utmost confidence in oneself, and which\ndrives away all trouble by the consciousness of real affection towards\none's benefactor. To say \"Take back what you gave me,\" is no less\na reproach than to say \"You are in my debt.\" Let this be the first\nprivilege of a benefit, that he who bestowed it may choose the time when\nhe will have it returned. \"But I fear that men may speak ill of me.\" You\ndo wrong if you are grateful only for the sake of your reputation, and\nnot to satisfy your conscience. You have in this matter two judges, your\nbenefactor, whom you ought not, and yourself, whom you cannot deceive.\n\"But,\" say you, \"if no occasion of repayment offers, am I always to\nremain in his debt?\" Yes; but you should do so openly, and willingly,\nand should view with great pleasure what he has entrusted to you. If you\nare vexed at not having yet returned a benefit, you must be sorry that\nyou ever received it; but if he deserved that you should receive a\nbenefit from him, why should he not deserve that you should long remain\nin his debt?\nXLIII. Those persons are much mistaken who regard it as a proof of a\ngreat mind to make offers to give, and to fill many men's pockets and\nhouses with their presents, for sometimes these are due not to a great\nmind, but to a great fortune; they do not know how far more great and\nmore difficult it sometimes is to receive than to lavish gifts. I must\ndisparage neither act; it is as proper to a noble heart to owe as to\nreceive, for both are of equal value when done virtuously; indeed, to\nowe is the more difficult, because it requires more pains to keep a\nthing safe than to give it away. We ought not therefore to be in a hurry\nto repay, nor need we seek to do so out of due season, for to hasten to\nmake repayment at the wrong time is as bad as to be slow to do so at the\nright time. My benefactor has entrusted his bounty to me: I ought not\nto have any fears either on his behalf or on my own. He has a sufficient\nsecurity; he cannot lose it except he loses me--nay, not even if he\nloses me. I have returned thanks to him for it--that is, I have requited\nhim. He who thinks too much about repaying a benefit must suppose that\nhis friend thinks too much about receiving repayment. Make no difficulty\nabout either course. If he wishes to receive his benefit back again,\nlet us return it cheerfully; if he prefers to leave it in our hands,\nwhy should we dig up his treasure? why should we decline to be its\nguardians? he deserves to be allowed to do whichever he pleases. As\nfor fame and reputation, let us regard them as matters which ought to\naccompany, but which ought not to direct our actions.\nBOOK VII.\nI.\nBe of good cheer, my Liberalis:\n\"Our port is close, and I will not delay,\nNor by digressions wander from the way.\"\nThis book collects together all that has been omitted, and in it, having\nexhausted my subject, I shall consider not what I am to say, but what\nthere is which I have not yet said. If there be anything superfluous\nin it, I pray you take it in good part, since it is for you that it is\nsuperfluous. Had I wished to set off my work to the best advantage, I\nought to have added to it by degrees, and to have kept for the last that\npart which would be eagerly perused even by a sated reader. However,\ninstead of this, I have collected together all that was essential in the\nbeginning; I am now collecting together whatever then escaped me; nor,\nby Hercules, if you ask me, do I think that, after the rules which\ngovern our conduct have been stated, it is very much to the purpose to\ndiscuss the other questions which have been raised more for the exercise\nof our intellects than for the health of our minds. The cynic Demetrius,\nwho in my opinion was a great man even if compared with the greatest\nphilosophers, had an admirable saying about this, that one gained more\nby having a few wise precepts ready and in common use than by learning\nmany without having them at hand. \"The best wrestler,\" he would say, \"is\nnot he who has learned thoroughly all the tricks and twists of the art,\nwhich are seldom met with in actual wrestling, but he who has well and\ncarefully trained himself in one or two of them, and watches keenly for\nan opportunity of practising them. It does not matter how many of them\nhe knows, if he knows enough to give him the victory; and so in\nthis subject of ours there are many points of interest, but few of\nimportance. You need not know what is the system of the ocean tides,\nwhy each seventh year leaves its mark upon the human body, why the more\ndistant parts of a long portico do not keep their true proportion,\nbut seem to approach one another until at last the spaces between the\ncolumns disappear, how it can be that twins are conceived separately,\nthough they are born together, whether both result from one, or each\nfrom a separate act, why those whose birth was the same should have such\ndifferent fates in life, and dwell at the greatest possible distance\nfrom one another, although they were born touching one another; it will\nnot do you much harm to pass over matters which we are not permitted to\nknow, and which we should not profit by knowing. Truths so obscure may\nbe neglected with impunity. [Footnote: The old saying, 'Truth lurks deep\nin a well (or abyss).'] Nor can we complain that nature deals hardly\nwith us, for there is nothing which is hard to discover except those\nthings by which we gain nothing beyond the credit of having discovered\nthem; whatever things tend to make us better or happier are either\nobvious or easily discovered. Your mind can rise superior to the\naccidents of life, if it can raise itself above fears and not greedily\ncovet boundless wealth, but has learned to seek for riches within\nitself; if it has cast out the fear of men and gods, and has learned\nthat it has not much to fear from man, and nothing to fear from God; if\nby scorning all those things which make life miserable while they adorn\nit, the mind can soar to such a height as to see clearly that death\ncannot be the beginning of any trouble, though it is the end of many;\nif it can dedicate itself to righteousness and think any path easy which\nleads to it; if, being a gregarious creature, and born for the common\ngood, it regards the world as the universal home, if it keeps its\nconscience clear towards God and lives always as though in public,\nfearing itself more than other men, then it avoids all storms, it stands\non firm ground in fair daylight, and has brought to perfection its\nknowledge of all that is useful and essential. All that remains serves\nmerely to amuse our leisure; yet, when once anchored in safety, the mind\nmay consider these matters also, though it can derive no strength, but\nonly culture from their discussion.\"\nII. The above are the rules which my friend Demetrius bids him who would\nmake progress in philosophy to clutch with both hands, never to let\ngo, but to cling to them, and make them a part of himself, and by daily\nmeditation upon them to bring himself into such a state of mind, that\nthese wholesome maxims occur to him of their own accord, that wherever\nhe may be, they may straightway be ready for use when required, and\nthat the criterion of right and wrong may present itself to him without\ndelay. Let him know that nothing is evil except what is base, and\nnothing good except what is honourable: let him guide his life by this\nrule: let him both act and expect others to act in accordance with this\nlaw, and let him regard those whose minds are steeped in indolence, and\nwho are given up to lust and gluttony, as the most pitiable of mankind,\nno matter how splendid their fortunes may be. Let him say to himself,\n\"Pleasure is uncertain, short, apt to pall upon us, and the more eagerly\nwe indulge in it, the sooner we bring on a reaction of feeling against\nit; we must necessarily afterwards blush for it, or be sorry for it,\nthere is nothing grand about it, nothing worthy of man's nature, little\nlower as it is than that of the gods; pleasure is a low act, brought\nabout by the agency of our inferior and baser members, and shameful in\nits result. True pleasure, worthy of a human being and of a man, is,\nnot to stuff or swell his body with food and drink, nor to excite lusts\nwhich are least hurtful when they are most quiet, but to be free from\nall forms of mental disturbance, both those which arise from men's\nambitious struggles with one another, and those which come from on high\nand are more difficult to deal with, which flow from our taking the\ntraditional view of the gods, and estimating them by the analogy of our\nown vices.\" This equable, secure, uncloying pleasure is enjoyed by the\nman now described; a man skilled, so to say, in the laws of gods and men\nalike. Such a man enjoys the present without anxiety for the future: for\nhe who depends upon what is uncertain can rely confidently upon nothing.\nThus he is free from all those great troubles which unhinge the mind,\nhe neither hopes for, nor covets anything, and engages in no uncertain\nadventures, being satisfied with what he has. Do not suppose that he\nis satisfied with a little; for everything is his, and that not in the\nsense in which all was Alexander's, who, though he reached the shore of\nthe Red Sea, yet wanted more territory than that through which he\nhad come. He did not even own those countries which he held or had\nconquered, while Onesicritus, whom he had sent on before him to discover\nnew countries, was wandering about the ocean and engaging in war in\nunknown seas. Is it clear that he who pushed his armies beyond the\nbounds of the universe, who with reckless greed dashed headlong into a\nboundless and unexplored sea, must in reality have been full of wants?\nIt matters not how many kingdoms he may have seized or given away, or\nhow great a part of the world may pay him tribute; such a man must be in\nneed of as much as he desires.\nIII. This was not the vice of Alexander alone, who followed with a\nfortunate audacity in the footsteps of Bacchus and Hercules, but it is\ncommon to all those whose covetousness is whetted rather than appeased\nby good fortune. Look at Cyrus and Cambyses and all the royal house of\nPersia: can you find one among them who thought his empire large enough,\nor was not at the last gasp still aspiring after further conquests? We\nneed not wonder at this, for whatever is obtained by covetousness is\nsimply swallowed up and lost, nor does it matter how much is poured\ninto its insatiable maw. Only the wise man possesses everything\nwithout having to struggle to retain it; he alone does not need to send\nambassadors across the seas, measure out camps upon hostile shores,\nplace garrisons in commanding forts, or manoeuvre legions and squadrons\nof cavalry. Like the immortal gods, who govern their realm without\nrecourse to arms, and from their serene and lofty heights protect their\nown, so the wise man fulfils his duties, however far-reaching they may\nbe, without disorder, and looks down upon the whole human race, because\nhe himself is the greatest and most powerful member thereof. You may\nlaugh at him, but if you in your mind survey the east and the west,\nreaching even to the regions separated from us by vast wildernesses, if\nyou think of all the creatures of the earth, all the riches which the\nbounty of nature lavishes, it shows a great spirit to be able to say, as\nthough you were a god, \"All these are mine.\" Thus it is that he covets\nnothing, for there is nothing which is not contained in everything, and\neverything is his.\nIV. \"This,\" say you, \"is the very thing that I wanted! I have caught\nyou! I shall be glad to see how you will extricate yourself from the\ntoils into which you have fallen of your own accord. Tell me, if the\nwise man possesses everything, how can one give anything to a wise man?\nfor even what you give him is his already. It is impossible, therefore,\nto bestow a benefit upon a wise man, if whatever is given him comes from\nhis own store; yet you Stoics declare that it is possible to give to\na wise man. I make the same inquiry about friends as well: for you\nsay that friends own everything in common, and if so, no one can give\nanything to his friend, for he gives what his friend owned already in\ncommon with himself.\"\nThere is nothing to prevent a thing belonging to a wise man, and yet\nbeing the property of its legal owner. According to law everything in a\nstate belongs to the king, yet all that property over which the king has\nrights of possession is parcelled out among individual owners, and\neach separate thing belongs to somebody: and so one can give the king\na house, a slave, or a sum of money without being said to give him what\nwas his already; for the king has rights over all these things, while\neach citizen has the ownership of them. We speak of the country of the\nAthenians, or of the Campanians, though the inhabitants divide them\namongst themselves into separate estates; the whole region belongs to\none state or another, but each part of it belongs to its own individual\nproprietor; so that we are able to give our lands to the state, although\nthey are reckoned as belonging to the state, because we and the state\nown them in different ways. Can there be any doubt that all the private\nsavings of a slave belong to his master as well as he himself? yet he\nmakes his master presents. The slave does not therefore possess nothing,\nbecause if his master chose he might possess nothing; nor does what he\ngives of his own free will cease to be a present, because it might have\nbeen wrung from him against his will. As for how we are to prove that\nthe wise man possesses all things, we shall see afterwards; for the\npresent we are both agreed to regard this as true; we must gather\ntogether something to answer the question before us, which is, how any\nmeans remain of acting generously towards one who already possesses all\nthings? All things that a son has belong to his father, yet who does not\nknow that in spite of this a son can make presents to his father? All\nthings belong to the gods; yet we make presents and bestow alms even\nupon the gods. What I have is not necessarily not mine because it\nbelongs to you; for the same thing may belong both to me and to you.\n\"He to whom courtezans belong,\" argues our adversary, \"must be\na procurer: now courtezans are included in all things, therefore\ncourtezans belong to the wise man. But he to whom courtezans belong is\na procurer; therefore the wise man is a procurer.\" Yes! by the same\nreasoning, our opponents would forbid him to buy anything, arguing, \"No\nman buys his own property. Now all things are the property of the wise\nman; therefore the wise man buys nothing.\" By the same reasoning they\nobject to his borrowing, because no one pays interest for the use of\nhis own money. They raise endless quibbles, although they perfectly well\nunderstand what we say.\nV. For, when I say that the wise man possesses everything, I mean that\nhe does so without thereby impairing each man's individual rights in\nhis own property, in the same way as in a country ruled by a good king,\neverything belongs to the king, by the right of his authority, and to\nthe people by their several rights of ownership. This I shall prove\nin its proper place; in the mean time it is a sufficient answer to the\nquestion to declare that I am able to give to the wise man that which is\nin one way mine, and in another way his. Nor is it strange that I should\nbe able to give anything to one who possesses everything. Suppose I have\nhired a house from you: some part of that house is mine, some is yours;\nthe house itself is yours, the use of your house belongs to me. Crops\nmay ripen upon your land, but you cannot touch them against the will of\nyour tenant; and if corn be dear, or at famine price, you will\n\"In vain another's mighty store behold,\"\ngrown upon your land, lying upon your land, and to be deposited in\nyour own barns. Though you be the landlord, you must not enter my hired\nhouse, nor may you take away your own slave from me if I have contracted\nfor his services; nay, if I hire a carriage from you, I bestow a benefit\nby allowing you to take your seat in it, although it is your own. You\nsee, therefore, that it is possible for a man to receive a present by\naccepting what is his own.\nVI. In all the cases which I have mentioned, each party is the owner of\nthe same thing. How is this? It is because the one owns the thing, the\nother owns the use of the thing. We speak of the books of Cicero. Dorus,\nthe bookseller, calls these same books his own; the one claims them\nbecause he wrote them, the other because he bought them; so that they\nmay quite correctly be spoken of as belonging to either of the two, for\nthey do belong to each, though in a different manner. Thus Titus Livius\nmay receive as a present, or may buy his own books from Dorus.\nAlthough the wise man possesses everything, yet I can give him what I\nindividually possess; for though, king-like, he in his mind possesses\neverything, yet the ownership of all things is divided among various\nindividuals, so that he can both receive a present and owe one; can\nbuy, or hire things. Everything belongs to Caesar; yet he has no private\nproperty beyond his own privy purse; as Emperor all things are his,\nbut nothing is his own except what he inherits. It is possible, without\ntreason, to discuss what is and what is not his; for even what the court\nmay decide not to be his, from another point of view is his. In the same\nway the wise man in his mind possesses everything, in actual right and\nownership he possesses only his own property.\nVII. Bion is able to prove by argument at one time that everyone is\nsacrilegious, at another that no one is. When he is in a mood for\ncasting all men down the Tarpeian rock, he says, \"Whosoever touches that\nwhich belongs to the gods, and consumes it or converts it to his own\nuses, is sacrilegious; but all things belong to the gods, so that\nwhatever thing any one touches belongs to them to whom all belongs;\nwhoever, therefore, touches anything is sacrilegious.\" Again, when he\nbids men break open temples and pillage the Capitol without fear of the\nwrath of heaven, he declares that no one can be sacrilegious; because,\nwhatever a man takes away, he takes from one place which belongs to the\ngods into another place which belongs to the gods. The answer to this\nis that all places do indeed belong to the gods, but all are not\nconsecrated to them, and that sacrilege can only be done in places\nsolemnly dedicated to heaven. Thus, also, the whole world is a temple of\nthe immortal gods, and, indeed, the only one worthy of their greatness\nand splendour, and yet there is a distinction between things sacred and\nprofane; all things which it is lawful to do under the sky and the stars\nare not lawful to do within consecrated walls. The sacrilegious man\ncannot do God any harm, for He is placed beyond his reach by His divine\nnature; yet he is punished because he seems to have done Him harm: his\npunishment is demanded by our feeling on the matter, and even by his\nown. In the same way, therefore, as he who carries off any sacred\nthings is regarded as sacrilegious, although that which he stole is\nnevertheless within the limits of the world, so it is possible to steal\nfrom a wise man: for in that case it will be some, not of that universe\nwhich he possesses, but some of those things of which he is the\nacknowledged owner, and which are severally his own property, which will\nbe stolen from him. The former of these possessions he will recognize as\nhis own, the latter he will be unwilling, even if he be able to possess;\nhe will say, as that Roman commander said, when, to reward his courage\nand good service to the state, he was assigned as much land as he could\ninclose in one day's ploughing. \"You do not,\" said he, \"want a citizen\nwho wants more than is enough for one citizen.\" Do you not think that it\nrequired a much greater man to refuse this reward than to earn it? for\nmany have taken away the landmarks of other men's property, but no one\nsets up limits to his own.\nVIII. When, then, we consider that the mind of the truly wise man has\npower over all things and pervades all things, we cannot help declaring\nthat everything is his, although, in the estimation of our common law,\nit may chance that he may be rated as possessing no property whatever.\nIt makes a great difference whether we estimate what he owns by the\ngreatness of his mind, or by the public register. He would pray to be\ndelivered from that possession of everything of which you speak. I will\nnot remind you of Socrates, Chrysippus, Zeno, and other great men, all\nthe greater, however, because envy prevents no one from praising the\nancients. But a short time ago I mentioned Demetrius, who seems to have\nbeen placed by nature in our times that he might prove that we could\nneither corrupt him nor be corrected by him; a man of consummate wisdom,\nthough he himself disclaimed it, constant to the principles which he\nprofessed, of an eloquence worthy to deal with the mightiest subjects,\nscorning mere prettinesses and verbal niceties, but expressing with\ninfinite spirit, the ideas which inspired it. I doubt not that he was\nendowed by divine providence with so pure a life and such power of\nspeech in order that our age might neither be without a model nor a\nreproach. Had some god wished to give all our wealth to Demetrius on the\nfixed condition that he should not be permitted to give it away, I am\nsure that he would have refused to accept it, and would have said,\nIX. \"I do not intend to fasten upon my back a burden like this, of which\nI never can rid myself, nor do I, nimble and lightly equipped as I am,\nmean to hinder my progress by plunging into the deep morass of business\ntransactions. Why do you offer to me what is the bane of all nations?\nI would not accept it even if I meant to give it away, for I see many\nthings which it would not become me to give. I should like to place\nbefore my eyes the things which fascinate both kings and peoples, I wish\nto behold the price of your blood and your lives. First bring before\nme the trophies of Luxury, exhibiting them as you please, either in\nsuccession, or, which is better, in one mass. I see the shell of\nthe tortoise, a foul and slothful brute, bought for immense sums and\nornamented with the most elaborate care, the contrast of colours which\nis admired in it being obtained by the use of dyes resembling the\nnatural tints. I see tables and pieces of wood valued at the price of\na senator's estate, which are all the more precious, the more knots\nthe tree has been twisted into by disease. I see crystal vessels, whose\nprice is enhanced by their fragility, for among the ignorant the risk of\nlosing things increases their value instead of lowering it, as it ought.\nI see murrhine cups, for luxury would be too cheap if men did not drink\nto one another out of hollow gems the wine to be afterwards thrown up\nagain. I see more than one large pearl placed in each ear; for now our\nears are trained to carry burdens, pearls are hung from them in pairs,\nand each pair has other single ones fastened above it. This womanish\nfolly is not exaggerated enough for the men of our time, unless they\nhang two or three estates upon each ear. I see ladies' silk dresses, if\nthose deserve to be called dresses which can neither cover their body\nor their shame; when wearing which, they can scarcely with a good\nconscience, swear that they are not naked. These are imported at a vast\nexpense from nations unknown even to trade, in order that our matrons\nmay show as much of their persons in public as they do to their lovers\nin private.\"\nX. What are you doing, Avarice? see how many things there are whose\nprice exceeds that of your beloved gold: all those which I have\nmentioned are more highly esteemed and valued. I now wish to review your\nwealth, those plates of gold and silver which dazzle our covetousness.\nBy Hercules, the very earth, while she brings forth upon the surface\nevery thing that is of use to us, has buried these, sunk them deep,\nand rests upon them with her whole weight, regarding them as pernicious\nsubstances, and likely to prove the ruin of mankind if brought into the\nlight of day. I see that iron is brought out of the same dark pits as\ngold and silver, in order that we may lack neither the means nor the\nreward of murder. Thus far we have dealt with actual substances; but\nsome forms of wealth deceive our eyes and minds alike. I see there\nletters of credit, promissory notes, and bonds, empty phantoms of\nproperty, ghosts of sick Avarice, with which she deceives our minds,\nwhich delight in unreal fancies; for what are these things, and what are\ninterest, and account books, and usury, except the names of unnatural\ndevelopments of human covetousness? I might complain of nature for not\nhaving hidden gold and silver deeper, for not having laid over it a\nweight too heavy to be removed: but what are your documents, your sale\nof time, your blood-sucking twelve per cent. interest? these are evils\nwhich we owe to our own will, which flow merely from our perverted\nhabit, having nothing about them which can be seen or handled, mere\ndreams of empty avarice. Wretched is he who can take pleasure in the\nsize of the audit book of his estate, in great tracts of land cultivated\nby slaves in chains, in huge flocks and herds which require provinces\nand kingdoms for their pasture ground, in a household of servants, more\nin number than some of the most warlike nations, or in a private house\nwhose extent surpasses that of a large city! After he has carefully\nreviewed all his wealth, in what it is invested, and on what it is\nspent, and has rendered himself proud by the thoughts of it, let him\ncompare what he has with what he wants: he becomes a poor man at once.\n\"Let me go: restore me to those riches of mine. I know the kingdom of\nwisdom, which is great and stable: I possess every thing, and in such a\nmanner that it belongs to all men nevertheless.\"\nXI. When, therefore, Gaius Caesar offered him two hundred thousand\nsesterces, he laughingly refused it, thinking it unworthy of himself to\nboast of having refused so small a sum. Ye gods and goddesses, what a\nmean mind must the emperor have had, if he hoped either to honour or to\ncorrupt him. I must here repeat a proof of his magnanimity. I have\nheard that when he was expressing his wonder at the folly of Gaius at\nsupposing that he could be influenced by such a bribe, he said, \"If\nhe meant to tempt me, he ought to have tried to do so by offering his\nentire kingdom.\"\nXII. It is possible, then, to give something to the wise man, although\nall things belong to the wise man. Similarly, though we declare that\nfriends have all things in common, it is nevertheless possible to give\nsomething to a friend: for I have not everything in common with a friend\nin the same manner as with a partner, where one part belongs to him,\nand another to me, but rather as a father and a mother possess their\nchildren in common when they have two, not each parent possessing one\nchild, but each possessing both. First of all I will prove that any\nchance would-be partner of mine has nothing in common with me: and why?\nBecause this community of goods can only exist between wise men, who\nare alone capable of friendship: other men can neither be friends nor\npartners one to another. In the next place, things may be owned in\ncommon in various ways. The knights' seats in the theatre belong to all\nthe Roman knights; yet of these the seat which I occupy becomes my own,\nand if I yield it up to any one, although I only yield him a thing\nwhich we own in common, still I appear to have given him something. Some\nthings belong to certain persons under particular conditions. I have\na place among the knights, not to sell, or to let, or to dwell in, but\nsimply to see the spectacle from, wherefore I do not tell an untruth\nwhen I say that I have a place among the knights' seats. Yet if, when I\ncome into the theatre, the knights' seats are full, I both have a seat\nthere by right, because I have the privilege of sitting there, and I\nhave not a seat there, because my seat is occupied by those who share my\nright to those places. Suppose that the same thing takes place between\nfriends; whatever our friend possesses, is common to us, but is the\nproperty of him who owns it; I cannot make use of it against his will.\n\"You are laughing at me,\" say you; \"if what belongs to my friend is\nmine, I am able to sell it.\" You are not able; for you are not able to\nsell your place among the knights' seats, and yet they are in common\nbetween you and the other knights. Consequently, the fact that you\ncannot sell a thing, or consume it, or exchange it for the better or the\nworse does not prove that it is not yours; for that which is yours under\ncertain conditions is yours nevertheless.\nXIII. I have received, but certainly not less. Not to detain you longer\nthan is necessary, a benefit can be no more than a benefit; but the\nmeans employed to convey benefits may be both greater and more numerous.\nI mean those things by which kindness expresses and gives vent to\nitself, like lovers, whose many kisses and close embraces do not\nincrease their love but give it play.\nXIV. The next question which arises has been thoroughly threshed out in\nthe former books, so here it shall only be touched on shortly; for the\narguments which have been used for other cases can be transferred to it.\nThe question is, whether one who has done everything in his power to\nreturn a benefit, has returned it. \"You may know,\" says our adversary,\n\"that he has not returned it, because he did everything in his power to\nreturn it; it is evident, therefore, that he did not not do that which\nhe did not have an opportunity of doing. A man who searches everywhere\nfor his creditor without finding him does not thereby pay him what\nhe owes.\" Some are in such a position that it is their duty to effect\nsomething material; in the case of others to have done all in their\npower to effect it is as good as effecting it. If a physician has done\nall in his power to heal his patient he has performed his duty; an\nadvocate who employs his whole powers of eloquence on his client's\nbehalf, performs his duty even though his client be convicted; the\ngeneralship even of a beaten commander is praised if he has prudently,\nlaboriously, and courageously exercised his functions. Your friend has\ndone all in his power to return your kindness, but your good fortune\nstood in his way; no adversity befell you in which he could prove the\ntruth of his friendship; he could not give you money when you were\nrich, or nurse you when you were in health, or help you when you were\nsucceeding; yet he repaid your kindness, even though you did not receive\na benefit from him. Moreover, this man, being always eager, and on the\nwatch for an opportunity of doing this, as he has expended much anxiety\nand much trouble upon it, has really done more than he who quickly had\nan opportunity of repaying your kindness. The case of a debtor is not\nthe same, for it is not enough for him to have tried to find the money\nunless he pays it; in his case a harsh creditor stands over him who will\nnot let a single day pass without charging him interest; in yours there\nis a most kind friend, who seeing you busy, troubled, and anxious would\nsay.\n\"'Dismiss this trouble from thy breast;'\nleave off disturbing yourself; I have received from you all that I wish;\nyou wrong me, if you suppose that I want anything further; you have\nfully repaid me in intention.\"\n\"Tell me,\" says our adversary, \"if he had repaid the benefit you would\nsay that he had returned your kindness: is, then, he who repays it in\nthe same position as he who does not repay it?\"\nOn the other hand, consider this: if he had forgotten the benefit which\nhe had received, if he had not even attempted to be grateful, you would\nsay that he had not returned the kindness; but this man has laboured day\nand night to the neglect of all his other duties in his devoted care to\nlet no opportunity of proving his gratitude escape him; is then he who\ntook no pains to return a kindness to be classed with this man who never\nceased to take pains? you are unjust, if you require a material payment\nfrom me when you see that I am not wanting in intention.\nXV. In short, suppose that when you are taken captive, I have borrowed\nmoney, made over my property as security to my creditor, that I have\nsailed in a stormy winter season along coasts swarming with pirates,\nthat I have braved all the perils which necessarily attend a voyage even\non a peaceful sea, that I have wandered through all wildernesses seeking\nfor those men whom all others flee from, and that when I have at length\nreached the pirates, someone else has already ransomed you: will you\nsay that I have not returned your kindness? Even if during this voyage I\nhave lost by shipwreck the money that I had raised to save you, even if\nI myself have fallen into the prison from which I sought to release you,\nwill you say that I have not returned your kindness? No, by Hercules!\nthe Athenians call Harmodius and Aristogiton, tyrannicides; the hand of\nMucius which he left on the enemy's altar was equivalent to the death\nof Porsena, and valour struggling against fortune is always illustrious,\neven if it falls short of accomplishing its design. He who watches\neach opportunity as it passes, and tries to avail himself of one\nafter another, does more to show his gratitude than he whom the first\nopportunity enabled to be grateful without any trouble whatever. \"But,\"\nsays our adversary, \"he gave you two things, material help and kindly\nfeeling; you, therefore, owe him two.\" You might justly say this to one\nwho returns your kindly feeling without troubling himself further; this\nman is really in your debt; but you cannot say so of one who wishes to\nrepay you, who struggles and leaves no stone unturned to do so; for,\nas far as in him lies, he repays you in both kinds; in the next place,\ncounting is not always a true test, sometimes one thing is equivalent to\ntwo; consequently so intense and ardent a wish to repay takes the place\nof a material repayment. Indeed, if a feeling of gratitude has no value\nin repaying a kindness without giving something material, then no one\ncan be grateful to the gods, whom we can repay by gratitude alone. \"We\ncannot,\" says our adversary, \"give the gods anything else.\" Well, but\nif I am not able to give this man, whose kindness I am bound to return,\nanything beside my gratitude, why should that which is all that I can\nbestow on a god be insufficient to prove my gratitude towards a man?\nXVI. If, however, you ask me what I really think, and wish me to give a\ndefinite answer, I should say that the one party ought to consider his\nbenefit to have been returned, while the other ought to feel that he has\nnot returned it; the one should release his friend from the debt, the\nother should hold himself bound to pay it; the one should say, \"I have\nreceived;\" the other should answer, \"I owe.\" In our whole investigation,\nwe ought to look entirely to the public good; we ought to prevent the\nungrateful having any excuses in which they can take refuge, and under\ncover of which they can disown their debts. \"I have done all in my\npower,\" say you. Well, keep on doing so still. Do you suppose that our\nancestors were so foolish, as not to understand that it is most unjust\nthat the man who has wasted the money which he received from his\ncreditor on debauchery, or gambling, should be classed with one who has\nlost his own property as well as that of others in a fire, by robbery,\nor some sadder mischance? They would take no excuse, that men might\nunderstand that they were always bound to keep their word; it was\nthought better that even a good excuse should not be accepted from a few\npersons, than that all men should be led to try to make excuses. You say\nthat you have done all in your power to repay your debt; this ought to\nbe enough for your friend, but not enough for you. He to whom you owe a\nkindness, is unworthy of gratitude if he lets all your anxious care and\ntrouble to repay it go for nothing; and so, too, if your friend takes\nyour good will as a repayment, you are ungrateful if you are not all the\nmore eager to feel the obligation of the debt which he has forgiven you.\nDo not snap up his receipt, or call witnesses to prove it; rather seek\nopportunities for repaying not less than before; repay the one man\nbecause he asks for repayment, the other because he forgives you your\ndebt; the one because he is good, the other because he is bad. You, need\nnot, therefore, think that you have anything to do with the question\nwhether a man be bound to repay the benefit which he has received from\na wise man, if that man has ceased to be wise and has turned into a bad\nman. You would return a deposit which you had received from a wise man;\nyou would return a loan even to a bad man; what grounds have you for\nnot returning a benefit also? Because he has changed, ought he to change\nyou? What? if you had received anything from a man when healthy, would\nyou not return it to him when he was sick, though we always are more\nbound to treat our friends with more kindness when they are ailing? So,\ntoo, this man is sick in his mind; we ought to help him, and bear with\nhim; folly is a disease of the mind.\nXVII. I think here we ought to make a distinction, in order to render\nthis point more intelligible. Benefits are of two kinds: one, the\nperfect and true benefit, which can only be bestowed by one wise man\nupon another; the other, the common vulgar form which ignorant men like\nourselves interchange. With regard to the latter, there is no doubt that\nit is my duty to repay it whether my friend turns out to be a murderer,\na thief, or an adulterer. Crimes have laws to punish them; criminals are\nbetter reformed by judges than by ingratitude; a man ought not to make\nyou bad by being so himself. I will fling a benefit back to a bad man, I\nwill return it to a good man; I do so to the latter, because I owe it to\nhim; to the former, that I may not be in his debt.\nXVIII. With regard to the other class of benefit, the question arises\nwhether if I was not able to take it without being a wise man, I am able\nto return it, except to a wise man. For suppose I do return it to him,\nhe cannot receive it, he is not any longer able to receive such a thing,\nhe has lost the knowledge of how to use it. You would not bid me throw\nback [Footnote: i.e. in the game of ball.] a ball to a man who has lost\nhis hand; it is folly to give any one what he cannot receive. If I am\nto begin to reply to the last argument, I say that I should not give him\nwhat he is unable to take; but I would return it, even though he is not\nable to receive it. I cannot lay him under an obligation unless he takes\nmy bounty; but by returning it I can free myself from my obligations to\nhim. You say, \"he will not be able to use it.\" Let him see to that; the\nfault will lie with him, not with me.\nXIX. \"To return a thing,\" says our adversary, \"is to hand it over to one\nwho can receive it. Why, if you owed some wine to any man, and he bade\nyou pour it into a net or a sieve, would you say that you had returned\nit? or would you be willing to return it in such a way that in the act\nof returning it was lost between you?\" To return is to give that which\nyou owe back to its owner when he wishes for it. It is not my duty to\nperform more than this; that he should possess what he has received\nfrom me is a matter for further consideration; I do not owe him the\nsafe-keeping of his property, but the honourable payment of my debt,\nand it is much better that he should not have it, than that I should\nnot return it to him. I would repay my creditor, even though he would\nat once take what I paid him to the market; even if he deputed an\nadulteress to receive the money from me, I would pay it to her; even\nif he were to pour the coins which he receives into a loose fold of his\ncloak, I would pay it. It is my business to return it to him, not to\nkeep it and save it for him after I have returned it; I am bound to take\ncare of his bounty when I have received it, but not when I have returned\nit to him. While it remains with me, it must be kept safe; but when he\nasks for it again I must give it to him, even though it slips out of his\nhands as he takes it. I will repay a good man when it is convenient; I\nwill repay a bad man when he asks me to do so.\n\"You cannot,\" argues our adversary, \"return him a benefit of the same\nkind as that which you received; for you received it from a wise man,\nand you are returning it to a fool.\" Do I not return to him such a\nbenefit, as he is now able to receive? It is not my fault if I return it\nto him worse than I received it, the fault lies with him, and so, unless\nhe regains his former wisdom, I shall return it in such a form as he\nin his fallen condition is able to receive. \"But what,\" asks he, \"if\nhe become not only bad, but savage and ferocious, like Apollodorus or\nPhalaris, would you return even to such a man as this a benefit which\nyou had received from him?\" I answer, Nature does not admit of so great\na change in a wise man. Men do not change from the best to the worst;\neven in becoming bad, he would necessarily retain some traces of\ngoodness; virtue is never so utterly quenched as not to imprint on the\nmind marks which no degradation can efface. If wild animals bred in\ncaptivity escape into the woods, they still retain something of their\noriginal tameness, and are as remote from the gentlest in the one\nextreme as they are in the other from those which have always been wild,\nand have never endured to be touched by man's hand. No one who has ever\napplied himself to philosophy ever becomes completely wicked; his mind\nbecomes so deeply coloured with it, that its tints can never be entirely\nspoiled and blackened. In the next place, I ask whether this man of\nyours be ferocious merely in intent, or whether he breaks out into\nactual outrages upon mankind? You have instanced the tyrants Apollodorus\nand Phalaris; if the bad man restrains their evil likeness within\nhimself, why should I not return his benefit to him, in order to set\nmyself free from any further dealings with him? If, however, he not\nonly delights in human blood, but feeds upon it; if he exercises his\ninsatiable cruelty in the torture of persons of all ages, and his fury\nis not prompted by anger, but by a sort of delight in cruelty, if he\ncuts the throats of children before the eyes of their parents; if, not\nsatisfied with merely killing his victims, he tortures them, and not\nonly burns but actually roasts them; if his castle is always wet with\nfreshly shed blood; then it is not enough not to return his benefits.\nAll connexion between me and such a man has been broken off by his\ndestruction of the bonds of human society. If he had bestowed something\nupon me, but were to invade my native country, he would have lost all\nclaim to my gratitude, and it would be counted a crime to make him any\nreturn; if he does not attack my country, but is the scourge of his own;\nif he has nothing to do with my nation, but torments and cuts to pieces\nhis own, then in the same manner such depravity, though it does not\nrender him my personal enemy, yet renders him hateful to me, and the\nduty which I owe to the human race is anterior to and more important\nthan that which I owe to him as an individual.\nXX. However, although this be so, and although I am freed from all\nobligation towards him, from the moment when, by outraging all laws, he\nrendered it impossible for any man to do him a wrong, nevertheless, I\nthink I ought to make the following distinction in dealing with him.\nIf my repayment of his benefit will neither increase nor maintain his\npowers of doing mischief to mankind, and is of such a character that I\ncan return it to him without disadvantage to the public, I would return\nit: for instance, I would save the life of his infant child; for what\nharm can this benefit do to any of those who suffer from his cruelty?\nBut I would not furnish him with money to pay his bodyguard. If he\nwishes for marbles, or fine clothes, the trappings of his luxury will\nharm no one; but with soldiers and arms I would not furnish him. If he\ndemands, as a great boon, actors and courtesans and such things as will\nsoften his savage nature, I would willingly bestow them upon him. I\nwould not furnish him with triremes and brass-beaked ships of war, but I\nwould send him fast sailing and luxuriously-fitted vessels, and all\nthe toys of kings who take their pleasure on the sea. If his health was\naltogether despaired of, I would by the same act bestow a benefit on all\nmen and return one to him; seeing that for such characters death is\nthe only remedy, and that he who never will return to himself, had best\nleave himself. However, such wickedness as this is uncommon, and is\nalways regarded as a portent, as when the earth opens, or when fires\nbreak forth from caves under the sea; so let us leave it, and speak of\nthose vices which we can hate without shuddering at them. As for the\nordinary bad man, whom I can find in the marketplace of any town, who is\nfeared only by individuals, I would return to him a benefit which I\nhad received from him. It is not right that I should profit by his\nwickedness; let me return what is not mine to its owner. Whether he be\ngood or bad makes no difference; but I would consider the matter most\ncarefully, if I were not returning but bestowing it.\nXXI. This point requires to be illustrated by a story. A certain\nPythagoraean bought a fine pair of shoes from a shoemaker; and as they\nwere an expensive piece of work, he did not pay ready money for them.\nSome time afterwards he came to the shop to pay for them, and after he\nhad long been knocking at the closed door, some one said to him, \"Why do\nyou waste your time? The shoemaker whom you seek has been carried out\nof his house and buried; this is a grief to us who lose our friends for\never, but by no means so to you, who know that he will be born again,\"\njeering at the Pythagoraean. Upon this our philosopher not unwillingly\ncarried his three or four denarii home again, shaking them every now and\nthen; afterwards, blaming himself for the pleasure which he had secretly\nfelt at not paying his debt, and perceiving that he enjoyed having made\nthis trifling gain, he returned to the shop, and saying, \"the man lives\nfor you, pay him what you owe,\" he passed four denarii into the\nshop through the crack of the closed door, and let them fall inside,\npunishing himself for his unconscionable greediness that he might not\nform the habit of appropriating that which is not his own.\nXXII. If you owe anything, seek for some one to whom you may repay it,\nand if no one demands it, dun your own self; whether the man be good\nor bad is no concern of yours; repay him, and then blame him. You have\nforgotten, how your several duties are divided: it is right for him to\nforget it, but we have bidden you bear it in mind. When, however, we\nsay that he who bestows a benefit ought to forget it, it is a mistake to\nsuppose that we rob him of all recollection of the business, though it\nis most creditable to him; some of our precepts are stated over strictly\nin order to reduce them to their true proportions. When we say that he\nought not to remember it, we mean he ought not to speak publicly, or\nboast of it offensively. There are some, who, when they have bestowed\na benefit, tell it in all societies, talk of it when sober, cannot be\nsilent about it when drunk, force it upon strangers, and communicate it\nto friends; it is to quell this excessive and reproachful consciousness\nthat we bid him who gave it forget it, and by commanding him to do this,\nwhich is more than he is able, encourage him to keep silence.\nXXIII. When you distrust those whom you order to do anything, you ought\nto command them to do more than enough in order that they may do what\nis enough. The purpose of all exaggeration is to arrive at the truth by\nfalsehood. Consequently, he who spoke of horses as being:\n\"Whiter than snows and swifter than the winds,\"\nsaid what could not possibly be in order that they might be thought to\nbe as much so as possible. And he who said:\n\"More firm than crags, more headlong than the stream,\"\ndid not suppose that he should make any one believe that a man could\never be as firm as a crag. Exaggeration never hopes all its daring\nflights to be believed, but affirms what is incredible, that thereby it\nmay convey what is credible. When we say, \"let the man who has bestowed\na benefit, forget it,\" what we mean is, \"let him be as though he had\nforgotten it; let not his remembrance of it appear or be seen.\" When\nwe say that repayment of a benefit ought not to be demanded, we do not\nutterly forbid its being demanded; for repayment must often be extorted\nfrom bad men, and even good men require to be reminded of it. Am I not\nto point out a means of repayment to one who does not perceive it? Am I\nnot to explain my wants to one does not know them? Why should he (if\na bad man) have the excuse, or (if a good man) have the sorrow of not\nknowing them? Men ought sometimes to be reminded of their debts, though\nwith modesty, not in the tone of one demanding a legal right.\nXXIV. Socrates once said in the hearing of his friends: \"I would have\nbought a cloak, if I had had the money for it.\" He asked no one for\nmoney, but he reminded them all to give it. There was a rivalry between\nthem, as to who should give it; and how should there not be? Was it not\na small thing which Socrates received? Yes, but it was a great thing\nto be the man from whom Socrates received it. Could he blame them more\ngently? \"I would,\" said he, \"have bought a cloak if I had had the money\nfor it.\" After this, however eager any one was to give, he gave too\nlate; for he had already been wanting in his duty to Socrates. Because\nsome men harshly demand repayment of debts, we forbid it, not in order\nthat it may never be done, but that it may be done sparingly.\nXXV. Aristippus once, when enjoying a perfume, said: \"Bad luck to those\neffeminate persons who have brought so nice a thing into disrepute.\" We\nalso may say, \"Bad luck to those base extortioners who pester us for a\nfourfold return of their benefits, and have brought into disrepute\nso nice a thing as reminding our friends of their duty.\" I shall\nnevertheless make use of this right of friendship, and I shall demand\nthe return of a benefit from any man from whom I would not have scrupled\nto ask for one, such a man as would regard the power of returning a\nbenefit as equivalent to receiving a second one. Never, not even when\ncomplaining of him, would I say,\n\"A wretch forlorn upon the shore he lay,\nHis ship, his comrades, all were swept away;\nFool that I was, I pitied his despair,\nAnd even gave him of my realm a share.\"\nThis is not to remind, but to reproach; this is to make one's benefits\nodious to enable him, or even to make him wish to be ungrateful. It is\nenough, and more than enough, to remind him of it gently and familiarly:\n\"If aught of mine hath e'er deserved thy thanks.\"\nTo this his answer would be, \"Of course you have deserved my thanks; you\ntook me up, 'a wretch forlorn upon the shore.'\"\nXXVI. \"But,\" says our adversary, \"suppose that we gain nothing by this;\nsuppose that he pretends that he has forgotten it, what ought I to do?\"\nYou now ask a very necessary question, and one which fitly concludes\nthis branch of the subject, how, namely, one ought to bear with the\nungrateful. I answer, calmly, gently, magnanimously. Never let any one's\ndiscourtesy, forgetfulness, or ingratitude, enrage you so much that you\ndo not feel any pleasure at having bestowed a benefit upon him; never\nlet your wrongs drive you into saying, \"I wish I had not done it.\" You\nought to take pleasure even in the ill-success of your benefit; he will\nalways be sorry for it, even though you are not even now sorry for it.\nYou ought not to be indignant, as if something strange had happened; you\nought rather to be surprised if it had not happened. Some are prevented\nby difficulties, some by expense, and some by danger from returning your\nbounty; some are hindered by a false shame, because by returning it,\nthey would confess that they had received it; with others ignorance of\ntheir duty, indolence, or excess of business, stands in the way. Reflect\nupon the insatiability of men's desires. You need not be surprised if no\none repays you in a world in which no one ever gains enough. What man is\nthere of so firm and trustworthy a mind that you can safely invest your\nbenefits in him? One man is crazed with lust, another is the slave of\nhis belly, another gives his whole soul to gain, caring nothing for the\nmeans by which he amasses it; some men's minds are disturbed by envy,\nsome blinded by ambition till they are ready to fling themselves on the\nsword's point. In addition to this, one must reckon sluggishness of\nmind and old age; and also the opposites of these, restlessness and\ndisturbance of mind, also excessive self-esteem and pride in the\nvery things for which a man ought to be despised. I need not mention\nobstinate persistence in wrong-doing, or frivolity which cannot remain\nconstant to one point; besides all this, there is headlong rashness,\nthere is timidity which never gives us trustworthy counsel, and the\nnumberless errors with which we struggle, the rashness of the most\ncowardly, the quarrels of our best friends, and that most common evil\nof trusting in what is most uncertain, and of undervaluing, when we have\nobtained it, that which we once never hoped to possess. Amidst all these\nrestless passions, how can you hope to find a thing so full of rest as\ngood faith?\nXXVII. If a true picture of our life were to rise before your mental\nvision, you would, I think, behold a scene like that of a town just\ntaken by storm, where decency and righteousness were no longer regarded,\nand no advice is heard but that of force, as if universal confusion\nwere the word of command. Neither fire nor sword are spared; crime\nis unpunished by the laws; even religion, which saves the lives of\nsuppliants in the very midst of armed enemies, does not check those who\nare rushing to secure plunder. Some men rob private houses, some public\nbuildings; all places, sacred or profane, are alike stripped; some burst\ntheir way in, others climb over; some open a wider path for themselves\nby overthrowing the walls that keep them out, and make their way to\ntheir booty over ruins; some ravage without murdering, others brandish\nspoils dripping with their owner's blood; everyone carries off his\nneighbours' goods. In this greedy struggle of the human race surely you\nforget the common lot of all mankind, if you seek among these robbers\nfor one who will return what he has got. If you are indignant at\nmen being ungrateful, you ought also to be indignant at their being\nluxurious, avaricious and lustful; you might as well be indignant with\nsick men for being ugly, or with old men for being pale. It is, indeed,\na serious vice, it is not to be borne, and sets men at variance with one\nanother; nay, it rends and destroys that union by which alone our human\nweakness can be supported; yet it is so absolutely universal, that even\nthose who complain of it most are not themselves free from it.\nXXVIII. Consider within yourself, whether you have always shown\ngratitude to those to whom you owe it, whether no one's kindness has\never been wasted upon you, whether you constantly bear in mind all the\nbenefits which you have received. You will find that those which you\nreceived as a boy were forgotten before you became a man; that those\nbestowed upon you as a young man slipped from your memory when you\nbecame an old one. Some we have lost, some we have thrown away, some\nhave by degrees passed out of our sight, to some we have wilfully shut\nour eyes. If I am to make excuses for your weakness, I must say in the\nfirst place that human memory is a frail vessel, and is not large enough\nto contain the mass of things placed in it; the more it receives, the\nmore it must necessarily lose; the oldest things in it give way to the\nnewest. Thus it comes to pass that your nurse has hardly any influence\nwith you, because the lapse of time has set the kindness which you\nreceived from her at so great a distance; thus it is that you no longer\nlook upon your teacher with respect; and that now when you are busy\nabout your candidature for the consulate or the priesthood, you forget\nthose who supported you in your election to the quaestorship. If you\ncarefully examine yourself, perhaps you will find the vice of which\nyou complain in your own bosom; you are wrong in being angry with a\nuniversal failing, and foolish also, for it is your own as well; you\nmust pardon others, that you may yourself be acquitted. You will make\nyour friend a better man by bearing with him, you will in all cases make\nhim a worse one by reproaching him. You can have no reason for rendering\nhim shameless; let him preserve any remnants of modesty which he may\nhave. Too loud reproaches have often dispelled a modesty which might\nhave borne good fruit. No man fears to be that which all men see that he\nis; when his fault is made public, he loses his sense of shame.\nXXIX. You say, \"I have lost the benefit which I bestowed.\" Yet do we\nsay that we have lost what we consecrate to heaven, and a benefit well\nbestowed, even though we get an ill return for it, is to be reckoned\namong things consecrated. Our friend is not such a man as we hoped he\nwas; still, let us, unlike him, remain the same as we were. The loss did\nnot take place when he proved himself so; his ingratitude cannot be made\npublic without reflecting some shame upon us, since to complain of the\nloss of a benefit is a sign that it was not well bestowed. As far as we\nare able we ought to plead with ourselves on his behalf: \"Perhaps he was\nnot able to return it, perhaps he did not know of it, perhaps he will\nstill do so.\" A wise and forbearing creditor prevents the loss of some\ndebts by encouraging his debtor and giving him time. We ought to do the\nsame, we ought to deal tenderly with a weakly sense of honour.\nXXX. \"I have lost,\" say you, \"the benefit which I bestowed.\" You are a\nfool, and do not understand when your loss took place; you have indeed\nlost it, but you did so when you gave it, the fact has only now come\nto light. Even in the case of those benefits which appear to be lost,\ngentleness will do much good; the wounds of the mind ought to be\nhandled as tenderly as those of the body. The string, which might be\ndisentangled by patience, is often broken by a rough pull. What is\nthe use of abuse, or of complaints? why do you overwhelm him with\nreproaches? why do you set him free from his obligation? even if he\nbe ungrateful he owes you nothing after this. What sense is there in\nexasperating a man on whom you have conferred great favours, so as out\nof a doubtful friend to make a certain enemy, and one, too, who will\nseek to support his own cause by defaming you, or to make men say, \"I do\nnot know what the reason is that he cannot endure a man to whom he\nowes so much; there must be something in the background?\" Any man can\nasperse, even if he does not permanently stain the reputation of his\nbetters by complaining of them; nor will any one be satisfied with\nimputing small crimes to them, when it is only by the enormity of his\nfalsehood that he can hope to be believed.\nXXXI. What a much better way is that by which the semblance of\nfriendship, and, indeed, if the other regains to his right mind,\nfriendship itself is preserved! Bad men are overcome by unwearying\ngoodness, nor does any one receive kindness in so harsh and hostile a\nspirit as not to love good men even while he does them wrong, when they\nlay him under the additional obligation of requiring no return for their\nkindness. Reflect, then, upon this: you say, \"My kindness has met with\nno return, what am I to do? I ought to imitate the gods, those noblest\ndisposers of all events, who begin to bestow their benefits on those who\nknow them not, and persist in bestowing them on those who are ungrateful\nfor them. Some reproach them with neglect of us, some with injustice\ntowards us; others place them outside of their own world, in sloth and\nindifference, without light, and without any functions; others declare\nthat the sun itself, to whom we owe the division of our times of labour\nand of rest, by whose means we are saved from being plunged in the\ndarkness of eternal night; who, by his circuit, orders the seasons\nof the year, gives strength to our bodies, brings forth our crops and\nripens our fruits, is merely a mass of stone, or a fortuitous collection\nof fiery particles, or anything rather than a god. Yet, nevertheless,\nlike the kindest of parents, who only smile at the spiteful words of\ntheir children, the gods do not cease to heap benefits upon those\nwho doubt from what source their benefits are derived, but continue\nimpartially distributing their bounty among all the peoples and nations\nof the earth. Possessing only the power of doing good, they moisten\nthe land with seasonable showers, they put the seas in movement by the\nwinds, they mark time by the course of the constellations, they temper\nthe extremes of heat and cold, of summer and winter, by breathing a\nmilder air upon us; and they graciously and serenely bear with the\nfaults of our erring spirits. Let us follow their example; let us give,\neven if much be given to no purpose, let us, in spite of this, give to\nothers; nay, even to those upon whom our bounty has been wasted. No one\nis prevented by the fall of a house from building another; when one home\nhas been destroyed by fire, we lay the foundations of another before the\nsite has had time to cool; we rebuild ruined cities more than once\nupon the same spots, so untiring are our hopes of success. Men would\nundertake no works either on land or sea if they were not willing to try\nagain what they have failed in once.\"\nXXXII. Suppose a man is ungrateful, he does not injure me, but himself;\nI had the enjoyment of my benefit when I bestowed it upon him. Because\nhe is ungrateful, I shall not be slower to give but more careful; what I\nhave lost with him, I shall receive back from others. But I will bestow\na second benefit upon this man himself, and will overcome him even as a\ngood husbandman overcomes the sterility of the soil by care and culture;\nif I do not do so my benefit is lost to me, and he is lost to mankind.\nIt is no proof of a great mind to give and to throw away one's bounty;\nthe true test of a great mind is to throw away one's bounty and still to\ngive.\n*** END OF THE PROJECT GUTENBERG EBOOK L.

Many small donations\n($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt\nstatus with the IRS.\nThe Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating\ncharities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United\nStates. Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a\nconsiderable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up\nwith these requirements.

WHITTINGHAM AND CO., TOOKS COURT, CHANCERY\nLANE\nPREFACE.\nI can say little by way of preface to Seneca\u2019s \u201cMinor Dialogues\u201d\nwhich I have not already expressed in my preface to \u201cDe Beneficiis,\u201d\nexcept that the \u201cMinor Dialogues\u201d seem to me to be composed in a\ngloomier key than either the \u201cDe Beneficiis\u201d or \u201cDe Clementia,\u201d and\nprobably were written at a time when the author had already begun\nto experience the ingratitude of his imperial pupil. Some of the\nDialogues are dated from Corsica, Seneca\u2019s place of exile, which\nhe seems to have found peculiarly uncomfortable, although he remarks\nthat there are people who live there from choice. Nevertheless,\nmournful as they are in tone, these Dialogues have a certain value,\nbecause they teach us what was meant by Stoic philosophy in the\ntime of the Twelve Caesars. I have only to add that the value of\nmy work has been materially enhanced by the kindness of the Rev.\nProfessor J. E. B. Mayor, who has been good enough to read and\ncorrect almost all the proof sheets of this volume.\nAUBREY STEWART.  _London,_ 1889.\nCONTENTS.\nPAGE\nOf Providence                       1\nOn the Firmness of the Wise Man    22\nOf Anger.

ANNAEUS SENECA, ADDRESSED TO\nLUCILIUS.\n\u201cWHY, WHEN A PROVIDENCE EXISTS, ANY MISFORTUNES BEFALL GOOD MEN;\u201d\nOR, \u201cOF PROVIDENCE\u201d\nI. You have asked me, Lucilius, why, if the world be ruled by\nprovidence, so many evils befall good men? The answer to this would\nbe more conveniently given in the course of this work, after we\nhave proved that providence governs the universe, and that God is\namongst us: but, since you wish me to deal with one point apart\nfrom the whole, and to answer one replication before the main action\nhas been decided, I will do what is not difficult, and plead the\ncause of the gods. At the present time it is superfluous to point\nout that it is not without some guardian that so great a work\nmaintains its position, that the assemblage and movements of the\nstars do not depend upon accidental impulses, or that objects whose\nmotion is regulated by chance often fall into confusion and soon\nstumble, whereas this swift and safe movement goes on, governed by\neternal law, bearing with it so many things both on sea and land,\nso many most brilliant lights shining in order in the skies; that\nthis regularity does not belong to matter moving at random, and\nthat particles brought together by chance could not {2} arrange\nthemselves with such art as to make the heaviest weight, that of\nthe earth, remain unmoved, and behold the flight of the heavens as\nthey hasten round it, to make the seas pour into the valleys and\nso temper the climate of the land, without any sensible increase\nfrom the rivers which flow into them, or to cause huge growths to\nproceed from minute seeds. Even those phenomena which appear to be\nconfused and irregular, I mean showers of rain and clouds, the rush\nof lightning from the heavens, fire that pours from the riven peaks\nof mountains, quakings of the trembling earth, and everything else\nwhich is produced on earth by the unquiet element in the universe,\ndo not come to pass without reason, though they do so suddenly: but\nthey also have their causes, as also have those things which excite\nour wonder by the strangeness of their position, such as warm springs\namidst the waves of the sea, and new islands that spring up in the\nwide ocean. Moreover, any one who has watched how the shore is laid\nbare by the retreat of the sea into itself, and how within a short\ntime it is again covered, will believe that it is in obedience to\nsome hidden law of change that the waves are at one time contracted\nand driven inwards, at another burst forth and regain their bed\nwith a strong current, since all the while they wax in regular\nproportion, and come up at their appointed day and hour greater or\nless, according as the moon, at whose pleasure the ocean flows,\ndraws them. Let these matters be set aside for discussion at their\nown proper season, but I, since you do not doubt the existence of\nprovidence but complain of it, will on that account more readily\nreconcile you to gods who are most excellent to excellent men: for\nindeed the nature of things does not ever permit good to be injured\nby good. Between good men and the gods there is a friendship which\nis brought about by virtue\u2014 friendship do I say? nay, rather\nrelationship and likeness, since the good man differs from a god\nin time alone, {3} being his pupil and rival and true offspring,\nwhom his glorious parent trains more severely than other men,\ninsisting sternly on virtuous conduct, just as strict fathers do.\nWhen therefore you see men who are good and acceptable to the gods\ntoiling, sweating, painfully struggling upwards, while bad men run\nriot and are steeped in pleasures, reflect that modesty pleases us\nin our sons, and forwardness in our house-born slave-boys; that the\nformer are held in check by a somewhat stern rule, whereas the\nboldness of the latter is encouraged. Be thou sure that God acts\nin like manner: He does not pet the good man: He tries him, hardens\nhim, and fits him for Himself.\nII. Why do many things turn out badly for good men? Why, no evil\ncan befall a good man: contraries cannot combine. Just as so many\nrivers, so many showers of rain from the clouds, such a number of\nmedicinal springs, do not alter the taste of the sea, indeed, do\nnot so much as soften it, so the pressure of adversity does not\naffect the mind of a brave man; for the mind of a brave man maintains\nits balance and throws its own complexion over all that takes place,\nbecause it is more powerful than any external circumstances. I do\nnot say that he does not feel them, but he conquers them, and on\noccasion calmly and tranquilly rises superior to their attacks,\nholding all misfortunes to be trials of his own firmness. Yet who\nis there who, provided he be a man and have honourable ambition,\ndoes not long for due employment, and is not eager to do his duty\nin spite of danger? Is there any hard-working man to whom idleness\nis not a punishment? We see athletes, who study only their bodily\nstrength, engage in contests with the strongest of men, and insist\nthat those who train them for the arena should put out their whole\nstrength when practising with them: they endure blows and maltreatment,\nand, if they cannot find any single person who is their match, they\nengage with several at once: their {4} strength and courage droop\nwithout an antagonist: they can only prove how great and how mighty\nit is by proving how much they can endure. You should know that\ngood men ought to act in like manner, so as not to fear troubles\nand difficulties, nor to lament their hard fate, to take in good\npart whatever befalls them, and force it to become a blessing to\nthem. It does not matter what you bear, but how you bear it. Do you\nnot see how differently fathers and mothers indulge their children?\nhow the former urge them to begin their tasks betimes, will not\nsuffer them to be idle even on holidays, and exercise them till\nthey perspire, and sometimes till they shed tears\u2014while their mothers\nwant to cuddle them in their laps, and keep them out of the sun,\nand never wish them to be vexed, or to cry, or to work. God bears\na fatherly mind towards good men, and loves them in a manly spirit.\n\u201cLet them,\u201d says He, \u201cbe exercised by labours, sufferings, and\nlosses, that so they may gather true strength.\u201d Those who are\nsurfeited with ease break down not only with labour, but with mere\nmotion and by their own weight. Unbroken prosperity cannot bear a\nsingle blow; but he who has waged an unceasing strife with his\nmisfortunes has gained a thicker skin by his sufferings, yields to\nno disaster, and even though he fall yet fights on his knee. Do you\nwonder that God, who so loves the good, who would have them attain\nthe highest goodness and pre-eminence, should appoint fortune to\nbe their adversary? I should not be surprised if the gods sometimes\nexperience a wish to behold great men struggling with some misfortune.\nWe sometimes are delighted when a youth of steady courage receives\non his spear the wild beast that attacks him; or when he meets the\ncharge of a lion without flinching; and the more eminent the man\nis who acts thus,[1] the more {5} attractive is the sight: yet these\nare not matters which can attract the attention of the gods, but\nare mere pastime and diversions of human frivolity. Behold a sight\nworthy to be viewed by a god interested in his own work, behold a\npair[2] worthy of a god, a brave man matched with evil fortune,\nespecially if he himself has given the challenge. I say, I do not\nknow what nobler spectacle Jupiter could find on earth, should he\nturn his eyes thither, than that of Cato, after his party had more\nthan once been defeated, still standing upright amid the ruins of\nthe commonwealth. Quoth he, \u201cWhat though all be fallen into one\nman\u2019s power, though the land be guarded by his legions, the sea by\nhis fleets, though Caesar\u2019s soldiers beset the city gate? Cato has\na way out of it: with one hand he will open a wide path to freedom;\nhis sword, which he has borne unstained by disgrace and innocent\nof crime even in a civil war, will still perform good and noble\ndeeds; it will give to Cato that freedom which it could not give\nto his country. Begin, my soul, the work which thou so long hast\ncontemplated, snatch thyself away from the world of man. Already\nPetreius and Juba have met and fallen, each slain by the other\u2019s\nhand\u2014a brave and noble compact with fate, yet not one befitting my\ngreatness: it is as disgraceful for Cato to beg his death of any\none as it would be for him to beg his life.\u201d\nIt is clear to me that the gods must have looked on with great joy,\nwhile that man, his own most ruthless avenger, took thought for the\nsafety of others and arranged the escape of those who departed,\nwhile even on his last night he pursued his studies, while he drove\nthe sword into his sacred breast, while he tore forth his vitals\nand laid his hand upon that most holy life which was unworthy to\nbe defiled by steel. This, I am inclined to think, was the reason\nthat {6} his wound was not well-aimed and mortal: the gods were not\nsatisfied with seeing Cato die once: his courage was kept in action\nand recalled to the stage, that it might display itself in a more\ndifficult part: for it needs a greater mind to return a second time\nto death. How could they fail to view their pupil with interest\nwhen leaving his life by such a noble and memorable departure? Men\nare raised to the level of the gods by a death which is admired\neven by those who fear them.\nIII. However, as my argument proceeds, I shall prove that what\nappear to be evils are not so; for the present I say this, that\nwhat you call hard measure, misfortunes, and things against which\nwe ought to pray, are really to the advantage, firstly, of those\nto whom they happen, and secondly, of all mankind, for whom the\ngods care more than for individuals; and next, that these evils\nbefall them with their own good will, and that men deserve to endure\nmisfortunes, if they are unwilling to receive them. To this I shall\nadd, that misfortunes proceed thus by destiny, and that they befall\ngood men by the same law which makes them good. After this, I shall\nprevail upon you never to pity any good man; for though he may be\ncalled unhappy, he cannot be so.\nOf all these propositions that which I have stated first appears\nthe most difficult to prove. I mean, that the things which we dread\nand shudder at are to the advantage of those to whom they happen.\n\u201cIs it,\u201d say you, \u201cto their advantage to be driven into exile, to\nbe brought to want, to carry out to burial their children and wife,\nto be publicly disgraced, to lose their health?\u201d Yes! if you are\nsurprised at these being to any man\u2019s advantage, you will also be\nsurprised at any man being benefited by the knife and cautery, or\nby hunger and thirst as well. Yet if you consider that some men,\nin order to be cured, have their bones scraped, and pieces of them\nextracted, that their veins are pulled out {7} and that some have\nlimbs cut off, which could not remain in their place without ruin\nto the whole body, you will allow me to prove to you this also,\nthat some misfortunes are for the good of those to whom they happen,\njust as much, by Hercules, as some things which are praised and\nsought after are harmful to those who enjoy them like indigestions\nand drunkenness and other matters which kill us through pleasure.\nAmong many grand sayings of our Demetrius is this, which I have but\njust heard, and which still rings and thrills in my ears: \u201cNo one,\u201d\nsaid he, \u201cseems to me more unhappy than the man whom no misfortune\nhas ever befallen.\u201d He never has had an opportunity of testing\nhimself; though everything has happened to him according to his\nwish, nay, even before he has formed a wish, yet the gods have\njudged him unfavourably; he has never been deemed worthy to conquer\nill fortune, which avoids the greatest cowards, as though it said,\n\u201cWhy should I take that man for my antagonist? He will straightway\nlay down his arms: I shall not need all my strength against him:\nhe will be put to flight by a mere menace: he dares not even face\nme; let me look around for some other with whom I may fight hand\nto hand: I blush to join battle with one who is prepared to be\nbeaten.\u201d A gladiator deems it a disgrace to be matched with an\ninferior, and knows that to win without danger is to win without\nglory. Just so Fortune; she seeks out the bravest to match herself\nwith, passes over some with disdain, and makes for the most unyielding\nand upright of men, to exert her strength against them. She tried\nMucius fire, Fabricius by poverty, Rutilius by exile, Regulus by\ntorture, Socrates by poison, Cato by death: it is ill fortune alone\nthat discovers these glorious examples. Was Mucius unhappy, because\nhe grasped the enemy\u2019s fire with his right hand, and of his own\naccord paid the penalty of his mistake? because he overcame the\nKing with his hand when it was burned, though he could {8} not when\nit held a sword? Would he have been happier, if he had warmed his\nhand in his mistress\u2019s bosom? Was Fabricius unhappy, because when\nthe state could spare him, he dug his own land? because he waged\nwar against riches as keenly as against Pyrrhus? because he supped\nbeside his hearth off the very roots and herbs which he himself,\nthough an old man, and one who had enjoyed a triumph, had grubbed\nup while clearing his field of weeds? What then? would he have been\nhappier if he had gorged himself with fishes from distant shores,\nand birds caught in foreign lands? if he had roused the torpor of\nhis queasy stomach with shellfish from the upper and the lower sea?\nif he had piled a great heap of fruits round game of the first head,\nwhich many huntsmen had been killed in capturing? Was Rutilius\nunhappy, because those who condemned him will have to plead their\ncause for all ages? because he endured the loss of his country more\ncomposedly than that of his banishment? because he was the only man\nwho refused anything to Sulla the dictator, and when recalled from\nexile all but went further away and banished himself still more.\n\u201cLet those,\u201d said he, \u201cwhom thy fortunate reign catches at Rome,\nsee to the Forum drenched with blood,[3] and the heads of Senators\nabove the Pool of Servilius\u2014the place where the victims of Sulla\u2019s\nproscriptions were stripped\u2014the bands of assassins roaming at large\nthrough the city, and many thousands of Roman citizens slaughtered\nin one place, after, nay, by means of a promise of quarter. Let\nthose who are unable to go into exile behold these things.\u201d Well!\nis Lucius Sulla happy, because when he comes down into the Forum\nroom is made for him with sword-strokes, because he allows the heads\nof consulars to be shown to him, and counts out the price of blood\nthrough the quaestor and the state exchequer? {9} And this, this\nwas the man who passed the Lex Cornelia! Let us now come to Regulus:\nwhat injury did fortune do him when she made him an example of good\nfaith, an example of endurance? They pierce his skin with nails:\nwherever he leans his weary body, it rests on a wound; his eyes are\nfixed for ever open; the greater his sufferings, the greater is his\nglory. Would you know how far he is from regretting that he valued\nhis honour at such a price? heal his wounds and send him again into\nthe senate-house; he will give the same advice. So, then, you think\nMaecenas a happier man, who when troubled by love, and weeping at\nthe daily repulses of his ill-natured wife, sought for sleep by\nlistening to distant strains of music? Though he drug himself with\nwine, divert himself with the sound of falling waters, and distract\nhis troubled thoughts with a thousand pleasures, yet Maecenas will\nno more sleep on his down cushions than Regulus on the rack. Yet\nit consoles the latter that he suffers for the sake of honour, and\nhe looks away from his torments to their cause: whilst the other,\njaded with pleasures and sick with over-enjoyment, is more hurt by\nthe cause of his sufferings than by the sufferings themselves. Vice\nhas not so utterly taken possession of the human race that, if men\nwere allowed to choose their destiny, there can be any doubt but\nthat more would choose to be Reguluses than to be Maecenases: or\nif there were any one who dared to say that he would prefer to be\nborn Maecenas than Regulus that man, whether he says so or not,\nwould rather have been Terentia (than Cicero).\nDo you consider Socrates to have been badly used, because he took\nthat draught which the state assigned to him as though it were a\ncharm to make him immortal, and argued about death until death\nitself? Was he ill treated, because his blood froze and the current\nof his veins gradually stopped as the chill of death crept over\nthem? How much more is this man to be envied than he who is {10}\nserved on precious stones, whose drink a creature trained to every\nvice, a eunuch or much the same, cools with snow in a golden cup?\nSuch men as these bring up again all that they drink, in misery and\ndisgust at the taste of their own bile, while Socrates cheerfully\nand willingly drains his poison. As for Cato, enough has been said,\nand all men must agree that the highest happiness was reached by\none who was chosen by Nature herself as worthy to contend with all\nher terrors: \u201cThe enmity,\u201d says she, \u201cof the powerful is grievous,\ntherefore let him be opposed at once by Pompeius, Caesar, and\nCrassus: it is grievous, when a candidate for public offices, to\nbe defeated by one\u2019s inferiors; therefore let him be defeated by\nVatinius: it is grievous to take part in civil wars, therefore let\nhim fight in every part of the world for the good cause with equal\nobstinacy and ill-luck: it is grievous to lay hands upon one\u2019s self,\ntherefore let him do so. What shall I gain by this? That all men\nmay know that these things, which I have deemed Cato worthy to\nundergo, are not real evils.\u201d\nIV. Prosperity comes to the mob, and to low-minded men as well as\nto great ones; but it is the privilege of great men alone to send\nunder the yoke[4] the disasters and terrors of mortal life: whereas\nto be always prosperous, and to pass through life without a twinge\nof mental distress, is to remain ignorant of one half of nature.\nYou are a great man; but how am I to know it, if fortune gives you\nno opportunity of showing your virtue? You have entered the arena\nof the Olympic games, but no one {11} else has done so: you have\nthe crown, but not the victory: I do not congratulate you as I would\na brave man, but as one who has obtained a consulship or praetorship.\nYou have gained dignity. I may say the same of a good man, if\ntroublesome circumstances have never given him a single opportunity\nof displaying the strength of his mind. I think you unhappy because\nyou never have been unhappy: you have passed through your life\nwithout meeting an antagonist: no one will know your powers, not\neven you yourself. For a man cannot know himself without a trial:\nno one ever learnt what he could do without putting himself to the\ntest; for which reason many have of their own free will exposed\nthemselves to misfortunes which no longer came in their way, and\nhave sought for an opportunity of making their virtue, which otherwise\nwould have been lost in darkness, shine before the world. Great\nmen, I say, often rejoice at crosses of fortune just as brave\nsoldiers do at wars. I remember to have heard Triumphus, who was a\ngladiator[5] in the reign of Tiberius Caesar, complaining about the\nscarcity of prizes; \u201cWhat a glorious time,\u201d said he, \u201cis past.\u201d\nValour is greedy of danger, and thinks only of whither it strives\nto go, not of what it will suffer, since even what it will suffer\nis part of its glory. Soldiers pride themselves on their wounds,\nthey joyously display their blood flowing over their breastplate.[6]\nThough those who return unwounded from battle may have done as\nbravely, yet he who returns wounded is more admired. God, I say,\nfavours those whom He wishes to enjoy the greatest honours, whenever\nHe affords them the means of performing some exploit with spirit\nand courage, something which is not easily to be accomplished: you\ncan judge of a pilot in a storm, of a soldier in a battle. How can\nI know with {12} how great a spirit you could endure poverty, if\nyou overflow with riches? How can I tell with how great firmness\nyou could bear up against disgrace, dishonour, and public hatred,\nif you grow old to the sound of applause, if popular favour cannot\nbe alienated from you, and seems to flow to you by the natural bent\nof men\u2019s minds? How can I know how calmly you would endure to be\nchildless, if you see all your children around you? I have heard\nwhat you said when you were consoling others: then I should have\nseen whether you could have consoled yourself, whether you could\nhave forbidden yourself to grieve. Do not, I beg you, dread those\nthings which the immortal gods apply to our minds like spurs:\nmisfortune is virtue\u2019s opportunity. Those men may justly be called\nunhappy who are stupified with excess of enjoyment, whom sluggish\ncontentment keeps as it were becalmed in a quiet sea: whatever\nbefalls them will come strange to them. Misfortunes press hardest\non those who are unacquainted with them: the yoke feels heavy to\nthe tender neck. The recruit turns pale at the thought of a wound:\nthe veteran, who knows that he has often won the victory after\nlosing blood, looks boldly at his own flowing gore. In like manner\nGod hardens, reviews, and exercises those whom He tests and loves:\nthose whom He seems to indulge and spare, He is keeping out of\ncondition to meet their coming misfortunes: for you are mistaken\nif you suppose that any one is exempt from misfortune: he who has\nlong prospered will have his share some day; those who seem to have\nbeen spared them have only had them put off. Why does God afflict\nthe best of men with ill-health, or sorrow, or other troubles?\nBecause in the army the most hazardous services are assigned to the\nbravest soldiers: a general sends his choicest troops to attack the\nenemy in a midnight ambuscade, to reconnoitre his line of march,\nor to drive the hostile garrisons from their strong places. No one\nof these {13} men says as he begins his march, \u201cThe general has\ndealt hardly with me,\u201d but \u201cHe has judged well of me.\u201d Let those\nwho are bidden to suffer what makes the weak and cowardly weep, say\nlikewise, \u201cGod has thought us worthy subjects on whom to try how\nmuch suffering human nature can endure.\u201d Avoid luxury, avoid\neffeminate enjoyment, by which men\u2019s minds are softened, and in\nwhich, unless something occurs to remind them of the common lot of\nhumanity, they lie unconscious, as though plunged in continual\ndrunkenness. He whom glazed windows have always guarded from the\nwind, whose feet are warmed by constantly renewed fomentations,\nwhose dining-room is heated by hot air beneath the floor and spread\nthrough the walls, cannot meet the gentlest breeze without danger.\nWhile all excesses are hurtful, excess of comfort is the most hurtful\nof all; it affects the brain; it leads men\u2019s minds into vain\nimaginings; it spreads a thick cloud over the boundaries of truth\nand falsehood. Is it not better, with virtue by one\u2019s side, to\nendure continual misfortune, than to burst with an endless surfeit\nof good things? It is the overloaded stomach that is rent asunder:\ndeath treats starvation more gently. The gods deal with good men\naccording to the same rule as schoolmasters with their pupils, who\nexact most labour from those of whom they have the surest hopes.\nDo you imagine that the Lacedaemonians, who test the mettle of their\nchildren by public flogging, do not love them? Their own fathers\ncall upon them to endure the strokes of the rod bravely, and when\nthey are torn and half dead, ask them to offer their wounded skin\nto receive fresh wounds. Why then should we wonder if God tries\nnoble spirits severely? There can be no easy proof of virtue. Fortune\nlashes and mangles us: well, let us endure it: it is not cruelty,\nit is a struggle, in which the oftener we engage the braver we shall\nbecome. The strongest part of the {14} body is that which is exercised\nby the most frequent use: we must entrust ourselves to fortune to\nbe hardened by her against herself: by degrees she will make us a\nmatch for herself. Familiarity with danger leads us to despise it.\nThus the bodies of sailors are hardened by endurance of the sea,\nand the hands of farmers by work; the arms of soldiers are powerful\nto hurl darts, the legs of runners are active: that part of each\nman which he exercises is the strongest: so by endurance the mind\nbecomes able to despise the power of misfortunes. You may see what\nendurance might effect in us if you observe what labour does among\ntribes that are naked and rendered stronger by want. Look at all\nthe nations that dwell beyond the Roman Empire: I mean the Germans\nand all the nomad tribes that war against us along the Danube. They\nsuffer from eternal winter, and a dismal climate, the barren soil\ngrudges them sustenance, they keep off the rain with leaves or\nthatch, they bound across frozen marshes, and hunt wild beasts for\nfood. Do you think them unhappy? There is no unhappiness in what\nuse has made part of one\u2019s nature: by degrees men find pleasure in\ndoing what they were first driven to do by necessity. They have no\nhomes and no resting-places save those which weariness appoints\nthem for the day; their food, though coarse, yet must be sought\nwith their own hands; the harshness of the climate is terrible, and\ntheir bodies are unclothed. This, which you think a hardship, is\nthe mode of life of all these races: how then can you wonder at\ngood men being shaken, in order that they may be strengthened? No\ntree which the wind does not often blow against is firm and strong;\nfor it is stiffened by the very act of being shaken, and plants its\nroots more securely: those which grow in a sheltered valley are\nbrittle: and so it is to the advantage of good men, and causes them\nto be undismayed, that they should live much {15} amidst alarms,\nand learn to bear with patience what is not evil save to him who\nendures it ill.\nV. Add to this that it is to the advantage of every one that the\nbest men should, so to speak, be on active service and perform\nlabours: God has the same purpose as the wise man, that is, to prove\nthat the things which the herd covets and dreads are neither good\nnor bad in themselves. If, however, He only bestows them upon good\nmen, it will be evident that they are good things, and bad, if He\nonly inflicts them upon bad men. Blindness would be execrable if\nno one lost his eyes except those who deserve to have them pulled\nout; therefore let Appius and Metellus be doomed to darkness. Riches\nare not a good thing: therefore let Elius the pander possess them,\nthat men who have consecrated money in the temple, may see the same\nin the brothel: for by no means can God discredit objects of desire\nso effectually as by bestowing them upon the worst of men, and\nremoving them from the best. \u201cBut,\u201d you say, \u201cit is unjust that a\ngood man should be enfeebled, or transfixed, or chained, while bad\nmen swagger at large with a whole skin.\u201d What! is it not unjust\nthat brave men should bear arms, pass the night in camps, and stand\non guard along the rampart with their wounds still bandaged, while\nwithin the city eunuchs and professional profligates live at their\nease? what? is it not unjust that maidens of the highest birth\nshould be roused at night to perform Divine service, while fallen\nwomen enjoy the soundest sleep? Labour calls for the best man: the\nsenate often passes the whole day in debate, while at the same time\nevery scoundrel either amuses his leisure in the Campus Martius,\nor lurks in a tavern, or passes his time in some pleasant society.\nThe same thing happens in this great commonwealth (of the world):\ngood men labour, spend and are spent, and that too of their own\nfree will; they are not dragged along by fortune, but follow {16}\nher and take equal steps with her; if they knew how, they would\noutstrip her. I remember, also, to have heard this spirited saying\nof that stoutest-hearted of men, Demetrius. \u201cYe immortal Gods,\u201d\nsaid he, \u201cthe only complaint which I have to make of you is that\nyou did not make your will known to me earlier; for then I would\nsooner have gone into that state of life to which I now have been\ncalled. Do you wish to take my children? it was for you that I\nbrought them up. Do you wish to take some part of my body? take it:\nit is no great thing that I am offering you, I shall soon have done\nwith the whole of it. Do you wish for my life? why should I hesitate\nto return to you what you gave me? whatever you ask you shall receive\nwith my good will: nay, I would rather give it than be forced to\nhand it over to you: what need had you to take away what you did?\nyou might have received it from me: yet even as it is you cannot\ntake anything from me, because you cannot rob a man unless he\nresists.\u201d\nI am constrained to nothing, I suffer nothing against my will, nor\nam I God\u2019s slave, but his willing follower, and so much the more\nbecause I know that everything is ordained and proceeds according\nto a law that endures for ever. The fates guide us, and the length\nof every man\u2019s days is decided at the first hour of his birth: every\ncause depends upon some earlier cause: one long chain of destiny\ndecides all things, public or private. Wherefore, everything must\nbe patiently endured, because events do not fall in our way, as we\nimagine, but come by a regular law. It has long ago been settled\nat what you should rejoice and at what you should weep, and although\nthe lives of individual men appear to differ from one another in a\ngreat variety of particulars, yet the sum total comes to one and\nthe same thing: we soon perish, and the gifts which we receive soon\nperish. Why, then, should we be angry? why should we lament? we are\nprepared for our fate: let nature deal {17} as she will with her\nown bodies; let us be cheerful whatever befalls, and stoutly reflect\nthat it is not anything of our own that perishes. What is the duty\nof a good man? to submit himself to fate: it is a great consolation\nto be swept away together with the entire universe: whatever law\nis laid upon us that thus we must live and thus we must die, is\nlaid upon the gods also: one unchangeable stream bears along men\nand gods alike: the creator and ruler of the universe himself,\nthough he has given laws to the fates, yet is guided by them: he\nalways obeys, he only once commanded. \u201cBut why was God so unjust\nin His distribution of fate, as to assign poverty, wounds, and\nuntimely deaths to good men?\u201d The workman cannot alter his materials:\nthis is their nature. Some qualities cannot be separated from some\nothers: they cling together; are indivisible. Dull minds, tending\nto sleep or to a waking state exactly like sleep, are composed of\nsluggish elements: it requires stronger stuff to form a man meriting\ncareful description. His course will not be straightforward; he\nmust go upwards and downwards, be tossed about, and guide his vessel\nthrough troubled waters: he must make his way in spite of fortune:\nhe will meet with much that is hard which he must soften, much that\nis rough that he must make smooth. Fire tries gold, misfortune tries\nbrave men. See how high virtue has to climb: you may be sure that\nit has no safe path to tread.\n\u201cSteep is the path at first: the steeds, though strong, Fresh\nfrom their rest, can hardly crawl along; The middle part lies\nthrough the topmost sky, Whence oft, as I the earth and sea\ndescry, I shudder, terrors through my bosom thrill.  The ending\nof the path is sheer down hill, And needs the careful guidance\nof the rein, For ever when I sink beneath the main, {18} Old\nTethys trembles in her depths  below Lest headlong down upon\nher I should  go.\u201d[7]\nWhen the spirited youth heard this, he said, \u201cI have no fault to\nfind with the road: I will mount it, it is worth while to go through\nthese places, even though one fall.\u201d His father did not cease from\ntrying to scare his brave spirit with terrors:\u2014\n\u201cThen, too, that thou may\u2019st hold thy course aright, And neither\nturn aside to left nor right.  Straight through the Bull\u2019s fell\nhorns thy path must go.  Through the fierce Lion, and the\nArcher\u2019s bow.\u201d\nAfter this Phaethon says:\u2014\n\u201cHarness the chariot which you yield to me,\nI am encouraged by these things with which you think to scare me:\nI long to stand where the Sun himself trembles to stand.\u201d It is the\npart of grovellers and cowards to follow the safe track; courage\nloves a lofty path.\nVI. \u201cYet, why does God permit evil to happen to good men?\u201d He does\nnot permit it: he takes away from them all evils, such as crimes\nand scandalous wickedness, daring thoughts, grasping schemes, blind\nlusts, and avarice coveting its neighbour\u2019s goods. He protects and\nsaves them. Does any one besides this demand that God should look\nafter the baggage of good men also? Why, they themselves leave the\ncare of this to God: they scorn external accessories. Democritus\nforswore riches, holding them to be a burden to a virtuous mind:\nwhat wonder then, if God permits that to happen to a good man, which\na good man sometimes chooses should happen to himself? Good men,\nyou say, lose their children: why should they not, since sometimes\nthey even put them to death? They are banished: why should they not\nbe, since sometimes they {19} leave their country of their own free\nwill, never to return? They are slain: why not, since sometimes\nthey choose to lay violent hands on themselves? Why do they suffer\ncertain miseries? it is that they may teach others how to do so.\nThey are born as patterns. Conceive, therefore, that God says:\u2014\u201cYou,\nwho have chosen righteousness, what complaint can you make of me?\nI have encompassed other men with unreal good things, and have\ndeceived their inane minds as it were by a long and misleading\ndream: I have bedecked them with gold, silver, and ivory, but within\nthem there is no good thing. Those men whom you regard as fortunate,\nif you could see, not their outward show, but their hidden life,\nare really unhappy, mean, and base, ornamented on the outside like\nthe walls of their houses: that good fortune of theirs is not sound\nand genuine: it is only a veneer, and that a thin one. As long,\ntherefore, as they can stand upright and display themselves as they\nchoose, they shine and impose upon one; when something occurs to\nshake and unmask them, we see how deep and real a rottenness was\nhidden by that factitious magnificence. To you I have given sure\nand lasting good things, which become greater and better the more\none turns them over and views them on every side: I have granted\nto you to scorn danger, to disdain passion. You do not shine\noutwardly, all your good qualities are turned inwards; even so does\nthe world neglect what lies without it, and rejoices in the\ncontemplation of itself. I have placed every good thing within your\nown breasts: it is your good fortune not to need any good fortune.\n\u2018Yet many things befall you which are sad, dreadful, hard to be\nborne.\u2019 Well, as I have not been able to remove these from your\npath, I have given your minds strength to combat all: bear them\nbravely. In this you can surpass God himself; He is beyond suffering\nevil: you are above it. Despise poverty; no man lives as poor as\nhe was born: {20} despise pain; either it will cease or you will\ncease: despise death; it either ends you or takes you elsewhere:\ndespise fortune; I have given her no weapon that can reach the mind.\nAbove all, I have taken care that no one should hold you captive\nagainst your will: the way of escape lies open before you: if you\ndo not choose to fight, you may fly. For this reason, of all those\nmatters which I have deemed essential for you, I have made nothing\neasier for you than to die. I have set man\u2019s life as it were on a\nmountain side: it soon slips down.[8] Do but watch, and you will\nsee how short and how ready a path leads to freedom. I have not\nimposed such long delays upon those who quit the world as upon those\nwho enter it: were it not so, fortune would hold a wide dominion\nover you, if a man died as slowly as he is born. Let all time, let\nevery place teach you, how simple it is to renounce nature, and to\nfling back her gifts to her: before the altar itself and during the\nsolemn rites of sacrifice, while life is being prayed for, learn\nhow to die. Fat oxen fall dead with a tiny wound; a blow from a\nman\u2019s hand fells animals of great strength: the sutures of the neck\nare severed by a thin blade, and when the joint which connects the\nhead and neck is cut, all that great mass falls. The breath of life\nis not deep seated, {21} nor only to be let forth by steel\u2014the\nvitals need not be searched throughout by plunging a sword among\nthem to the hilt: death lies near the surface, I have not appointed\nany particular spot for these blows\u2014the body may be pierced wherever\nyou please. That very act which is called dying, by which the breath\nof life leaves the body, is too short for you to be able to estimate\nits quickness: whether a knot crushes the windpipe, or water stops\nyour breathing: whether you fall headlong from a height and perish\nupon the hard ground below, or a mouthful of fire checks the drawing\nof your breath\u2014whatever it is, it acts swiftly. Do you not blush\nto spend so long a time in dreading what takes so short a time to\ndo?\u201d\n[1] _honestior_ opposed to the gladiator\u2014the loftier the station\nof the combatant.

It was\nno peculiar insult devised for this occasion, but a common usage,\nso far as appears, in similar cases; like the modern ceremony of\npiling arms when a garrison or army surrender themselves as prisoners\nof war.\u201d\u2014 Arnold\u2019s _History of Rome_, ch. xxxi.\n[5] He was a \u201cmirmillo,\u201d a kind of gladiator who was armed with a\nGaulish helmet.\n[6] _e lorica_.\n[7] The lines occur in Ovid\u2019s Metamorphoses, ii. 63.

I am\nsure I know one who has often felt so.

ANNAEUS SENECA, ADDRESSED\nTO SERENUS.\n\u201cTHAT THE WISE MAN CAN NEITHER RECEIVE INJURY NOR INSULT,\u201d OR, AN\nESSAY ON THE FIRMNESS OF THE WISE MAN.\nI. I might truly say, Serenus, that there is as wide a difference\nbetween the Stoics and the other sects of philosophers as there is\nbetween men and women, since each class contributes an equal share\nto human society, but the one is born to command, the other to obey.\nThe other philosophers deal with us gently and coaxingly, just as\nour accustomed family physicians usually do with our bodies, treating\nthem not by the best and shortest method, but by that which we allow\nthem to employ; whereas the Stoics adopt a manly course, and do not\ncare about its appearing attractive to those who are entering upon\nit, but that it should as quickly as possible take us out of the\nworld, and lead us to that lofty eminence which is so far beyond\nthe scope of any missile weapon that it is above the reach of Fortune\nherself. \u201cBut the way by which we are asked to climb is steep and\nuneven.\u201d What then? Can heights be reached by a level path? Yet\nthey are not so sheer and precipitous as some think. It is only the\nfirst part that {23} has rocks and cliffs and no apparent outlet,\njust as many hills seen from a long way off appear abruptly steep\nand joined together, because the distance deceives our sight, and\nthen, as we draw nearer, those very hills which our mistaken eyes\nhad made into one gradually unfold themselves, those parts which\nseemed precipitous from afar assume a gently sloping outline. When\njust now mention was made of Marcus Cato, you whose mind revolts\nat injustice were indignant at Cato\u2019s own age having so little\nunderstood him, at its having allotted a place below Vatinius to\none who towered above both Caesar and Pompeius; it seemed shameful\nto you, that when he spoke against some law in the Forum his toga\nwas torn from him, and that he was hustled through the hands of a\nmutinous mob from the Rostra as far as the arch of Fabius, enduring\nall the bad language, spitting, and other insults of the frantic\nrabble.\nII. I then answered, that you had good cause to be anxious on behalf\nof the commonwealth, which Publius Clodius on the one side, Vatinius\nand all the greatest scoundrels on the other, were putting up for\nsale, and, carried away by their blind covetousness, did not\nunderstand that when they sold it they themselves were sold with\nit; I bade you have no fears on behalf of Cato himself, because the\nwise man can neither receive injury nor insult, and it is more\ncertain that the immortal gods have given Cato as a pattern of a\nwise man to us, than that they gave Ulysses or Hercules to the\nearlier ages; for these our Stoics have declared were wise men,\nunconquered by labours, despisers of pleasure, and superior to all\nterrors. Cato did not slay wild beasts, whose pursuit belongs to\nhuntsmen and countrymen, nor did he exterminate fabulous creatures\nwith fire and sword, or live in times when it was possible to believe\nthat the heavens could be supported on the shoulders of one man.\nIn an age which had thrown {24} off its belief in antiquated\nsuperstitions, and had carried material knowledge to its highest\npoint, he had to struggle against that many-headed monster, ambition,\nagainst that boundless lust for power which the whole world divided\namong three men could not satisfy. He alone withstood the vices of\na worn-out State, sinking into ruin through its own bulk; he upheld\nthe falling commonwealth as far as it could be upheld by one man\u2019s\nhand, until at last his support was withdrawn, and he shared the\ncrash which he had so long averted, and perished together with that\nfrom which it was impious to separate him\u2014for Cato did not outlive\nfreedom, nor did freedom outlive Cato. Think you that the people\ncould do any wrong to such a man when they tore away his praetorship\nor his toga? when they bespattered his sacred head with the rinsings\nof their mouths? The wise man is safe, and no injury or insult can\ntouch him.\nIII. I think I see your excited and boiling temper. You are preparing\nto exclaim: \u201cThese are the things which take away all weight from\nyour maxims; you promise great matters, such as I should not even\nwish for, let alone believe to be possible, and then, after all\nyour brave words, though you say that the wise man is not poor, you\nadmit that he often is in want of servants, shelter, and food. You\nsay that the wise man is not mad, yet you admit that he sometimes\nloses his reason, talks nonsense, and is driven to the wildest\nactions by the stress of his disorder. When you say that the wise\nman cannot be a slave, you do not deny that he will be sold, carry\nout orders, and perform menial services at the bidding of his master;\nso, for all your proud looks, you come down to the level of every\none else, and merely call things by different names. Consequently,\nI suspect that something of this kind lurks behind this maxim, which\nat first sight appears so beautiful and noble, \u2018that the wise man\ncan neither receive {25} injury nor insult.\u2019 It makes a great deal\nof difference whether you declare that the wise man is beyond feeling\nresentment, or beyond receiving injury; for if you say that he will\nbear it calmly, he has no special privilege in that, for he has\ndeveloped a very common quality, and one which is learned by long\nendurance of wrong itself, namely, patience. If you declare that\nhe can never receive an injury, that is, that no one will attempt\nto do him one, then I will throw up all my occupations in life and\nbecome a Stoic.\u201d\nIt has not been my object to decorate the wise man with mere imaginary\nverbal honours, but to raise him to a position where no injury will\nbe permitted to reach him. \u201cWhat? will there be no one to tease\nhim, to try to wrong him?\u201d There is nothing on earth so sacred as\nnot to be liable to sacrilege; yet holy things exist on high none\nthe less because there are men who strike at a greatness which is\nfar above themselves, though with no hope of reaching it. The\ninvulnerable is not that which is never struck, but that which is\nnever wounded. In this class I will show you the wise man. Can we\ndoubt that the strength which is never overcome in fight is more\nto be relied on than that which is never challenged, seeing that\nuntested power is untrustworthy, whereas that solidity which hurls\nback all attacks is deservedly regarded as the most trustworthy of\nall? In like manner you may know that the wise man, if no injury\nhurts him, is of a higher type than if none is offered to him, and\nI should call him a brave man whom war does not subdue and the\nviolence of the enemy does not alarm, not him who enjoys luxurious\nease amid a slothful people. I say, then, that such a wise man is\ninvulnerable against all injury; it matters not, therefore, how\nmany darts be hurled at him, since he can be pierced by none of\nthem. Just as the hardness of some stones is impervious to steel,\nand adamant can neither be cut, {26} broken, or ground, but blunts\nall instruments used upon it; just as some things cannot be destroyed\nby fire, but when encircled by flame still retain their hardness\nand shape; just as some tall projecting cliffs break the waves of\nthe sea, and though lashed by them through many centuries, yet show\nno traces of their rage; even so the mind of the wise man is firm,\nand gathers so much strength, that it is as safe from injury as any\nof those things which I have mentioned.\nIV. \u201cWhat then? Will there be no one who will try to do an injury\nto the wise man?\u201d Yes, some one will try, but the injury will not\nreach him; for he is separated from the contact of his inferiors\nby so wide a distance that no evil impulse can retain its power of\nharm until it reaches him. Even when powerful men, raised to positions\nof high authority, and strong in the obedience of their dependents,\nstrive to injure him, all their darts fall as far short of his\nwisdom as those which are shot upwards by bowstrings or catapults,\nwhich, although they rise so high as to pass out of sight, yet fall\nback again without reaching the heavens. Why, do you suppose that\nwhen that stupid king[1] clouded the daylight with the multitude\nof his darts, that any arrow of them all went into the sun? or that\nwhen he flung his chains into the deep, that he was able to reach\nNeptune? Just as sacred things escape from the hands of men, and\nno injury is done to the godhead by those who destroy temples and\nmelt down images, so whoever attempts to treat the wise man with\nimpertinence, insolence, or scorn, does so in vain. \u201cIt would be\nbetter,\u201d say you, \u201cif no one wished to do so.\u201d You are expressing\na wish that the whole human race were inoffensive, which may hardly\nbe; moreover, those who would gain by such wrongs not being done\nare those who would do them, not he who could not suffer from them\neven if they were done; nay, I {27} know not whether wisdom is not\nbest displayed by calmness in the midst of annoyances, just as the\ngreatest proof of a general\u2019s strength in arms and men consists in\nhis quietness and confidence in the midst of an enemy\u2019s country.\nV. If you think fit, my Serenus, let us distinguish between injury\nand insult. The former is naturally the more grievous, the latter\nless important, and grievous only to the thin-skinned, since it\nangers men but does not wound them. Yet such is the weakness of\nmen\u2019s minds, that many think that there is nothing more bitter than\ninsult; thus you will find slaves who prefer to be flogged to being\nslapped, and who think stripes and death more endurable than insulting\nwords. To such a pitch of absurdity have we come that we suffer not\nonly from pain, but from the idea of pain, like children, who are\nterror-stricken by darkness, misshapen masks, and distorted faces,\nand whose tears flow at hearing names unpleasing to their ears, at\nthe movement of our fingers, and other things which they ignorantly\nshrink from with a sort of mistaken spasm. The object which injury\nproposes to itself is to do evil to some one. Now wisdom leaves no\nroom for evil; to it, the only evil is baseness, which cannot enter\ninto the place already occupied by virtue and honour. If, therefore,\nthere can be no injury without evil, and no evil without baseness,\nand baseness cannot find any place with a man who is already filled\nwith honour, it follows that no injury can reach the wise man: for\nif injury be the endurance of some evil, and the wise man can endure\nno evil, it follows that no injury takes effect upon the wise man.\nAll injury implies a making less of that which it affects, and no\none can sustain an injury without some loss either of his dignity,\nor of some part of his body, or of some of the things external to\nourselves; but the wise man can lose nothing. He has invested\neverything in himself, has entrusted nothing to fortune, has his\nproperty in safety, {28} and is content with virtue, which does not\nneed casual accessories, and therefore can neither be increased or\ndiminished; for virtue, as having attained to the highest position,\nhas no room for addition to herself, and fortune can take nothing\naway save what she gave. Now fortune does not give virtue; therefore\nshe does not take it away. Virtue is free, inviolable, not to be\nmoved, not to be shaken, and so hardened against misfortunes that\nshe cannot be bent, let alone overcome by them. She looks unfalteringly\non while tortures are being prepared for her; she makes no change\nof countenance, whether misery or pleasure be offered to her. The\nwise man therefore can lose nothing of whose loss he will be sensible,\nfor he is the property of virtue alone, from whom he never can be\ntaken away. He enjoys all other things at the good pleasure of\nfortune; but who is grieved at the loss of what is not his own? If\ninjury can hurt none of those things which are the peculiar property\nof the wise man, because while his virtue is safe they are safe,\nthen it is impossible that an injury should be done to a wise man.\nDemetrius, who was surnamed Poliorcetes, took Megara, and the\nphilosopher Stilbo, when asked by him whether he had lost anything,\nanswered, \u201cNo, I carry all my property about me.\u201d Yet his inheritance\nhad been given up to pillage, his daughters had been outraged by\nthe enemy, his country had fallen under a foreign dominion, and it\nwas the king, enthroned on high, surrounded by the spears of his\nvictorious troops, who put this question to him; yet he struck the\nvictory out of the king\u2019s hands, and proved that, though the city\nwas taken, he himself was not only unconquered but unharmed, for\nhe bore with him those true goods which no one can lay hands upon.\nWhat was being plundered and carried away hither and thither he did\nnot consider to be his own, but to be merely things which come and\ngo at the caprice of fortune; therefore he had not loved them as\nhis own, for {29} the possession of all things which come from\nwithout is slippery and insecure.\nVI. Consider now, whether any thief, or false accuser, or headstrong\nneighbour, or rich man enjoying the power conferred by a childless\nold age, could do any injury to this man, from whom neither war nor\nan enemy whose profession was the noble art of battering city walls\ncould take away anything. Amid the flash of swords on all sides,\nand the riot of the plundering soldiery, amid the flames and blood\nand ruin of the fallen city, amid the crash of temples falling upon\ntheir gods, one man was at peace. You need not therefore account\nthat a reckless boast, for which I will give you a surety, if my\nwords goes for nothing. Indeed, you would hardly believe so much\nconstancy or such greatness of mind to belong to any man; but here\na man comes forward to prove that you have no reason for doubting\nthat one who is but of human birth can raise himself above human\nnecessities, can tranquilly behold pains, losses, diseases, wounds,\nand great natural convulsions roaring around him, can bear adversity\nwith calm and prosperity with moderation, neither yielding to the\nformer nor trusting to the latter, that he can remain the same amid\nall varieties of fortune, and think nothing to be his own save\nhimself, and himself too only as regards his better part. \u201cBehold,\u201d\nsays he, \u201cI am here to prove to you that although, under the direction\nof that destroyer of so many cities, walls may be shaken by the\nstroke of the ram, lofty towers may be suddenly brought low by\ngalleries and hidden mines, and mounds arise so high as to rival\nthe highest citadel, yet that no siege engines can be discovered\nwhich can shake a well-established mind. I have just crept from\namid the ruins of my house, and with conflagrations blazing all\naround I have escaped from the flames through blood. What fate has\nbefallen my daughters, whether a worse one than that of their\ncountry, I {30} know not. Alone and elderly, and seeing everything\naround me in the hands of the enemy, still I declare that my property\nis whole and untouched. I have, I hold whatever of mine I have ever\nhad. There is no reason for you to suppose me conquered and yourself\nmy conqueror. It is your fortune which has overcome mine. As for\nthose fleeting possessions which change their owners, I know not\nwhere they are; what belongs to myself is with me, and ever will\nbe. I see rich men who have lost their estates; lustful men who\nhave lost their loves, the courtesans whom they cherished at the\ncost of much shame; ambitious men who have lost the senate, the law\ncourts, the places set apart for the public display of men\u2019s vices;\nusurers who have lost their account-books, in which avarice vainly\nenjoyed an unreal wealth; but I possess everything whole and\nuninjured. Leave me, and go and ask those who are weeping and\nlamenting over the loss of their money, who are offering their bare\nbreasts to drawn swords in its defence, or who are fleeing from the\nenemy with weighty pockets.\u201d See then, Serenus, that the perfect\nman, full of human and divine virtues, can lose nothing; his goods\nare surrounded by strong and impassable walls. You cannot compare\nwith them the walls of Babylon, which Alexander entered, nor the\nfortifications of Carthage and Numantia, won by one and the same\nhand,[2] nor the Capitol and citadel of Rome, which are branded\nwith the marks of the victors\u2019 insults; the ramparts which protect\nthe wise man are safe from fire and hostile invasion; they afford\nno passage; they are lofty, impregnable, divine.\nVII. You have no cause for saying, as you are wont to do, that this\nwise man of ours[3] is nowhere to be found; we do not invent him\nas an unreal glory of the human race, or conceive a mighty shadow\nof an untruth, but we have displayed and will display him just as\nwe sketch him, though {31} he may perhaps be uncommon, and only one\nappears at long intervals; for what is great and transcends the\ncommon ordinary type is not often produced; but this very Marcus\nCato himself, the mention of whom started this discussion, was a\nman who I fancy even surpassed our model. Moreover, that which hurts\nmust be stronger than that which is hurt. Now wickedness is not\nstronger than virtue; therefore the wise man cannot be hurt. Only\nthe bad attempt to injure the good. Good men are at peace among\nthemselves; bad ones are equally mischievous to the good and to one\nanother. If a man cannot be hurt by one weaker than himself, and a\nbad man be weaker than a good one, and the good have no injury to\ndread, except from one unlike themselves; then, no injury takes\neffect upon the wise man; for by this time I need not remind you\nthat no one save the wise man is good.\n\u201cIf,\u201d says our adversary, \u201cSocrates was unjustly condemned, he\nreceived an injury.\u201d At this point it is needful for us to bear in\nmind that it is possible for some one to do an injury to me, and\nyet for me not to receive it, as if any one were to steal something\nfrom my country-house and leave it in my town-house, that man would\ncommit a theft, yet I should lose nothing. A man may become\nmischievous, and yet do no actual mischief: if a man lies with his\nown wife as if she were a stranger, he will commit adultery, but\nhis wife will not; if a man gives me poison and the poison lose its\nstrength when mixed with food, that man, by administering the poison,\nhas made himself a criminal, even though he has done no hurt. A man\nis no less a brigand because his sword becomes entangled in his\nvictim\u2019s clothes and misses its mark. All crimes, as far as concerns\ntheir criminality, are completed before the actual deed is accomplished.\nSome crimes are of such a nature and bound by such conditions that\nthe first part can take place without the second. {32} though the\nsecond cannot take place without the first. I will endeavour to\nexplain these words: I can move my feet and yet not run; but I\ncannot run without moving my feet. I can be in the water without\nswimming; but if I swim, I cannot help being in the water. The\nmatter of which we are treating is of this character: if I have\nreceived an injury, it is necessary that some one must have done\nit to me; but if an injury has been done me, it is not necessary\nthat I should have received one; for many circumstances may intervene\nto avert the injury, as, for example, some chance may strike the\nhand that is aiming at us, and the dart, after it has been thrown,\nmay swerve aside. So injuries of all kinds may by certain circumstances\nbe thrown back and intercepted in mid-course, so that they may be\ndone and yet not received.\nVIII. Moreover, justice can suffer nothing unjust, because contraries\ncannot co-exist; but an injury can only be done unjustly, therefore\nan injury cannot be done to the wise man. Nor need you wonder at\nno one being able to do him an injury; for no one can do him any\ngood service either. The wise man lacks nothing which he can accept\nby way of a present, and the bad man can bestow nothing that is\nworthy of the wise man\u2019s acceptance; for he must possess it before\nhe can bestow it, and he possesses nothing which the wise man would\nrejoice to have handed over to him. Consequently, no one can do\neither harm or good to the wise man, because divine things neither\nwant help nor are capable of being hurt; and the wise man is near,\nindeed very near to the gods, being like a god in every respect\nsave that he is mortal. As he presses forward and makes his way\ntowards the life that is sublime, well-ordered, without fear,\nproceeding in a regular and harmonious course, tranquil, beneficent,\nmade for the good of mankind, useful both to itself and to others,\nhe will neither long nor weep for anything that is grovelling. He\nwho, trusting to {33} reason, passes through human affairs with\ngodlike mind, has no quarter from which he can receive injury. Do\nyou suppose that I mean merely from no man? He cannot receive an\ninjury even from fortune, which, whenever she contends with virtue,\nalways retires beaten. If we accept with an undisturbed and tranquil\nmind that greatest terror of all, beyond which the angry laws and\nthe most cruel masters have nothing to threaten us with, in which\nfortune\u2019s dominion is contained\u2014if we know that death is not an\nevil, and therefore is not an injury either, we shall much more\neasily endure the other things, such as losses, pains, disgraces,\nchanges of abode, bereavements, and partings, which do not overwhelm\nthe wise man even if they all befall him at once, much less does\nhe grieve at them when they assail him separately. And if he bears\nthe injuries of fortune calmly, how much more will he bear those\nof powerful men, whom he knows to be the hands of fortune.\nIX. He therefore endures everything in the same spirit with which\nhe endures the cold of winter and the severities of climate, fevers,\ndiseases, and other chance accidents, nor does he entertain so high\nan opinion of any man as to suppose that he acts of set purpose,\nwhich belongs to the wise man alone. All other men have no plans,\nbut only plots and deceits and irregular impulses of mind, which\nhe reckons the same as pure accident; now, what depends upon pure\naccident cannot rage around us designedly. He reflects, also, that\nthe largest sources of injury are to be found in those things by\nmeans of which danger is sought for against us, as, for example,\nby a suborned accuser, or a false charge, or by the stirring up\nagainst us of the anger of great men, and the other forms of the\nbrigandage of civilized life. Another common type of injury is when\na man loses some profit or prize for which he has long been angling;\nwhen an inheritance which he {34} has spent great pains to render\nhis own is left to some one else, or the favour of some noble house,\nthrough which he makes great gain, is taken from him. The wise man\nescapes all this, since he knows not what it is to live for hope\nor for fear. Add to this, that no one receives an injury unmoved,\nbut is disturbed by the feeling of it. Now, the man free from\nmistakes has no disturbance; he is master of himself, enjoying a\ndeep and tranquil repose of mind; for if an injury reaches him it\nmoves and rouses him. But the wise man is without anger, which is\ncaused by the appearance of injury, and he could not be free from\nanger unless he were also free from injury, which he knows cannot\nbe done to him; hence it is that he is so upright and cheerful,\nhence he is elate with constant joy. So far, however, is he from\nshrinking from the encounter either of circumstances or of men,\nthat he makes use of injury itself to make trial of himself and\ntest his own virtue. Let us, I beseech you, show favour to this\nthesis and listen with impartial ears and minds while the wise man\nis being made exempt from injury; for nothing is thereby taken away\nfrom your insolence, your greediest lusts, your blind rashness and\npride; it is without prejudice to your vices that this freedom is\nsought for the wise man; we do not strive to prevent your doing an\ninjury, but to enable him to sink all injuries beneath himself and\nprotect himself from them by his own greatness of mind. So in the\nsacred games many have won the victory by patiently enduring the\nblows of their adversaries and so wearying them out. Think that the\nwise man belongs to this class, that of men who, by long and faithful\npractice, have acquired strength to endure and tire out all the\nviolence of their enemies.\nX. Since we have now discussed the first part of our subject, let\nus pass on to the second, in which we will prove by arguments, some\nof which are our own, but {35} which for the most part are Stoic\ncommonplaces, that the wise man cannot be insulted. There is a\nlesser form of injury, which we must complain of rather than avenge,\nwhich the laws also have considered not to deserve any special\npunishment. This passion is produced by a meanness of mind which\nshrinks at any act or deed which treats it with disrespect. \u201cHe did\nnot admit me to his house to-day, although he admitted others; he\neither turned haughtily away or openly laughed when I spoke;\u201d or,\n\u201che placed me at dinner, not on the middle couch (the place of\nhonour), but on the lowest one;\u201d and other matters of the same sort,\nwhich I can call nothing but the whinings of a queasy spirit. These\nmatters chiefly affect the luxuriously-nurtured and prosperous; for\nthose who are pressed by worse evils have no time to notice such\nthings as these. Through excessive idleness, dispositions naturally\nweak and womanish and prone to indulge in fancies through want of\nreal injuries are disturbed at these things, the greater part of\nwhich arise from misunderstanding. He therefore who is affected by\ninsult shows that he possesses neither sense nor trustfulness; for\nhe considers it certain that he is scorned, and this vexation affects\nhim with a certain sense of degradation, as he effaces himself and\ntakes a lower room; whereas the wise man is scorned by no one, for\nhe knows his own greatness, gives himself to understand that he\nallows no one to have such power over him, and as for all of what\nI should not so much call distress as uneasiness of mind, he does\nnot overcome it, but never so much as feels it. Some other things\nstrike the wise man, though they may not shake his principles, such\nas bodily pain and weakness, the loss of friends and children, and\nthe ruin of his country in war-time. I do not say that the wise man\ndoes not feel these, for we do not ascribe to him the hardness of\nstone or iron; there is no virtue but is conscious of its own\nendurance. What then does he? He receives some {36} blows, but when\nhe has received them he rises superior to them, heals them, and\nbrings them to an end; these more trivial things he does not even\nfeel, nor does he make use of his accustomed fortitude in the\nendurance of evil against them, but either takes no notice of them\nor considers them to deserve to be laughed at.\nXI. Besides this, as most insults proceed from those who are haughty\nand arrogant and bear their prosperity ill, he has something wherewith\nto repel this haughty passion, namely, that noblest of all the\nvirtues, magnanimity, which passes over everything of that kind as\nlike unreal apparitions in dreams and visions of the night, which\nhave nothing in them substantial or true. At the same time he\nreflects that all men are too low to venture to look down upon what\nis so far above them. The Latin word _contumelia_ is derived from\nthe word _contempt_, because no one does that injury to another\nunless he regards him with contempt; and no one can treat his elders\nand betters with contempt, even though he does what contemptuous\npersons are wont to do; for children strike their parents\u2019 faces,\ninfants rumple and tear their mother\u2019s hair, and spit upon her and\nexpose what should be covered before her, and do not shrink from\nusing dirty language; yet we do not call any of these things\ncontemptuous. And why? Because he who does it is not able to show\ncontempt. For the same reason the scurrilous raillery of our slaves\nagainst their masters amuses us, as their boldness only gains licence\nto exercise itself at the expense of the guests if they begin with\nthe master; and the more contemptible and the more an object of\nderision each one of them is, the greater licence he gives his\ntongue. Some buy forward slave-boys for this purpose, cultivate\ntheir scurrility and send them to school that they may vent\npremeditated libels, which we do not call insults, but smart sayings;\nyet what madness, at one time to be amused and at another to be\naffronted by the same thing, {37} and to call a phrase an outrage\nwhen spoken by a friend, and an amusing piece of raillery when used\nby a slave-boy!\nXII. In the same spirit in which we deal with boys, the wise man\ndeals with all those whose childhood still endures after their youth\nis past and their hair is grey. What do men profit by age when their\nmind has all the faults of childhood and their defects are intensified\nby time? when they differ from children only in the size and\nappearance of their bodies, and are just as unsteady and capricious,\neager for pleasure without discrimination, timorous and quiet through\nfear rather than through natural disposition? One cannot say that\nsuch men differ from children because the latter are greedy for\nknuckle-bones and nuts and coppers, while the former are greedy for\ngold and silver and cities; because the latter play amongst themselves\nat being magistrates, and imitate the purple-edged robe of state,\nthe lictors\u2019 axes, and the judgment-seat, while the former play\nwith the same things in earnest in the Campus Martius and the courts\nof justice; because the latter pile up the sand on the seashore\ninto the likeness of houses, and the former, with an air of being\nengaged in important business, employ themselves in piling up stones\nand walls and roofs until they have turned what was intended for\nthe protection of the body into a danger to it? Children and those\nmore advanced in age both make the same mistake, but the latter\ndeal with different and more important things; the wise man,\ntherefore, is quite justified in treating the affronts which he\nreceives from such men as jokes: and sometimes he corrects them,\nas he would children, by pain and punishment, not because he has\nreceived an injury, but because they have done one and in order\nthat they may do so no more. Thus we break in animals with stripes,\nyet we are not angry with them when they refuse to carry their\nrider, but curb them in order that pain may overcome {38} their\nobstinacy. Now, therefore, you know the answer to the question which\nwas put to us, \u201cWhy, if the wise man receives neither injury nor\ninsult, he punishes those who do these things?\u201d He does not revenge\nhimself, but corrects them.\nXIII. What, then, is there to prevent your believing this strength\nof mind to belong to the wise man, when you can see the same thing\nexisting in others, though not from the same cause?\u2014for what physician\nis angry with a crazy patient? who takes to heart the curses of a\nfever-stricken one who is denied cold water? The wise man retains\nin his dealings with all men this same habit of mind which the\nphysician adopts in dealing with his patients, whose parts of shame\nhe does not scorn to handle should they need treatment, nor yet to\nlook at their solid and liquid evacuations, nor to endure their\nreproaches when frenzied by disease. The wise man knows that all\nthose who strut about in purple-edged togas,[4] healthy and embrowned,\nare brain-sick people, whom he regards as sick and full of follies.\nHe is not, therefore, angry, should they in their sickness presume\nto bear themselves somewhat impertinently towards their physician,\nand in the same spirit as that in which he sets no value upon their\ntitles of honour, he will set but little value upon their acts of\ndisrespect to himself. He will not rise in his own esteem if a\nbeggar pays his court to him, and he will not think it an affront\nif one of the dregs of the people does not return his greeting. So\nalso he will not admire himself even if many rich men admire him;\nfor he knows that they differ in no respect from beggars\u2014nay, are\neven more wretched than they; for {39} beggars want but a little,\nwhereas rich men want a great deal. Again, he will not be moved if\nthe King of the Medes, or Attalus, King of Asia, passes by him in\nsilence with a scornful air when he offers his greeting; for he\nknows that such a man\u2019s position has nothing to render it more\nenviable than that of the man whose duty it is in some great household\nto keep the sick and mad servants in order. Shall I be put out if\none of those who do business at the temple of Castor, buying and\nselling worthless slaves, does not return my salute, a man whose\nshops are crowded with throngs of the worst of bondmen? I trow not;\nfor what good can there be in a man who owns none but bad men? As\nthe wise man is indifferent to the courtesy or incivility of such\na man, so is he to that of a king. \u201cYou own,\u201d says he, \u201cthe Parthians\nand Bactrians, but they are men whom you keep in order by fear,\nthey are people whose possession forbids you to unstring the bow,\nthey are fierce enemies, on sale, and eagerly looking out for a new\nmaster.\u201d He will not, then, be moved by an insult from any man for\nthough all men differ one from another, yet the wise man regards\nthem all as alike on account of their equal folly; for should he\nonce lower himself to the point of being affected by either injury\nor insult, he could never feel safe afterwards, and safety is the\nespecial advantage of the wise man, and he will not be guilty of\nshowing respect to the man who has done him an injury by admitting\nthat he has received one, because it necessarily follows that he\nwho is disquieted at any one\u2019s scorn would value that person\u2019s\nadmiration.\nXIV. Such madness possesses some men that they imagine it possible\nfor an affront to be put upon them by a woman. What matters it who\nshe may be, how many slaves bear her litter, how heavily her ears\nare laden, how soft her seat? she is always the same thoughtless\ncreature, and unless she possesses acquired knowledge and {40} much\nlearning, she is fierce and passionate in her desires. Some are\nannoyed at being jostled by a heater of curling-tongs, and call the\nreluctance of a great man\u2019s porter to open the door, the pride of\nhis nomenclator,[5] or the disdainfulness of his chamberlain,\ninsults. O! what laughter is to be got out of such things, with\nwhat amusement the mind may be filled when it contrasts the frantic\nfollies of others with its own peace! \u201cHow then? will the wise man\nnot approach doors which are kept by a surly porter?\u201d Nay, if any\nneed calls him thither, he will make trial of him, however fierce\nhe may be, will tame him as one tames a dog by offering it food,\nand will not be enraged at having to expend entrance-money, reflecting\nthat on certain bridges also one has to pay toll; in like fashion\nhe will pay his fee to whoever farms this revenue of letting in\nvisitors, for he knows that men are wont to buy whatever is offered\nfor sale.[6] A man shows a poor spirit if he is pleased with himself\nfor having answered the porter cavalierly, broken his staff, forced\nhis way into his master\u2019s presence, and demanded a whipping for\nhim. He who strives with a man makes himself that man\u2019s rival, and\nmust be on equal terms with him before he can overcome him. But\nwhat will the wise man do when he receives a cuff? He will do as\nCato did when he was struck in the face; he did not flare up and\nrevenge the outrage, he did not even pardon it, but ignored it,\nshowing more magnanimity in not acknowledging it than if he had\nforgiven it. We will not dwell long upon this point; for who is\nthere who knows not that none of those things which are thought to\nbe good or evil are looked upon by the wise man and by mankind in\ngeneral in the same manner? He does not regard what all men think\nlow or wretched; he does not follow the people\u2019s track, but as the\n{41} stars move in a path opposite to that of the earth, so he\nproceeds contrary to the prejudices of all.\nXV. Cease then to say, \u201cWill not the wise man, then, receive an\ninjury if he be beaten, if his eye be knocked out? will he not\nreceive an insult if he be hooted through the Forum by the foul\nvoices of ruffians? if at a court banquet he be bidden to leave the\ntable and eat with slaves appointed to degrading duties? if he be\nforced to endure anything else that can be thought of that would\ngall a high spirit?\u201d However many or however severe these crosses\nmay be, they will all be of the same kind; and if small ones do not\naffect him, neither will greater ones; if a few do not affect him,\nneither will more. It is from your own weakness that you form your\nidea of his colossal mind, and when you have thought how much you\nyourselves could endure to suffer, you place the limit of the wise\nman\u2019s endurance a little way beyond that. But his virtue has placed\nhim in another region of the universe which has nothing in common\nwith you. Seek out sufferings and all things hard to be borne,\nrepulsive to be heard or seen; he will not be overwhelmed by their\ncombination, and will bear all just as he bears each one of them.\nHe who says that the wise man can bear this and cannot bear that,\nand restrains his magnanimity within certain limits, does wrong;\nfor Fortune overcomes us unless she is entirely overcome. Think not\nthat this is mere Stoic austerity. Epicurus, whom you adopt as the\npatron of your laziness, and who, you imagine, always taught what\nwas soft and slothful and conducive to pleasure, said, \u201cFortune\nseldom stands in a wise man\u2019s way.\u201d How near he came to a manly\nsentiment! Do thou dare to speak more boldly, and clear her out of\nthe way altogether! This is the house of the wise man\u2014narrow,\nunadorned, without bustle and splendour, the threshold guarded by\nno porters who marshal the crowd of visitors with a haughtiness\nproportionate to their bribes\u2014but For {42} tune cannot cross this\nopen and unguarded threshold. She knows that there is no room for\nher where there is nothing of hers.\nXVI. Now if even Epicurus, who made more concessions to the body\nthan any one, takes a spirited tone with regard to injuries, what\ncan appear beyond belief or beyond the scope of human nature amongst\nus Stoics? He says that injuries may be endured by the wise man,\nwe say that they do not exist for him. Nor is there any reason why\nyou should declare this to be repugnant to nature. We do not deny\nthat it is an unpleasant thing to be beaten or struck, or to lose\none of our limbs, but we say that none of these things are injuries.\nWe do not take away from them the feeling of pain, but the name of\n\u201cinjury,\u201d which cannot be received while our virtue is unimpaired.\nWe shall see which of the two is nearest the truth; each of them\nagree in despising injury. You ask what difference there is between\nthem? All that there is between two very brave gladiators, one of\nwhom conceals his wound and holds his ground, while the other turns\nround to the shouting populace, gives them to understand that his\nwound is nothing, and does not permit them to interfere on his\nbehalf. You need not think that it is any great thing about which\nwe differ; the whole gist of the matter, that which alone concerns\nyou, is what both schools of philosophy urge you to do, namely, to\ndespise injuries and insults, which I may call the shadows and\noutlines of injuries, to despise which does not need a wise man,\nbut merely a sensible one, who can say to himself, \u201cDo these things\nbefall me deservedly or undeservedly? If deservedly, it is not an\ninsult, but a judicial sentence; if undeservedly, then he who does\ninjustice ought to blush, not I. And what is this which is called\nan insult? Some one has made a joke about the baldness of my head,\nthe weakness of my eyes, the thinness of my legs, the shortness of\nmy stature; what insult is there in {43} telling me that which every\none sees? We laugh when _t\u00eate-\u00e0-t\u00eate_ at the same thing at which\nwe are indignant when it is said before a crowd, and we do not allow\nothers the privilege of saying what we ourselves are wont to say\nabout ourselves; we are amused at decorous jests, but are angry if\nthey are carried too far.\u201d\nXVII. Chrysippus says that a man was enraged because some one called\nhim a sea-sheep; we have seen Fidus Cornelius, the son-in-law of\nOvidius Naso, weeping in the Senate-house because Corbulo called\nhim a plucked ostrich; his command of his countenance did not fail\nhim at other abusive charges, which damaged his character and way\nof life; at this ridiculous saying he burst into tears. So deplorable\nis the weakness of men\u2019s minds when reason no longer guides them.\nWhat of our taking offence if any one imitates our talk, our walk,\nor apes any defect of our person or our pronunciation? as if they\nwould become more notorious by another\u2019s imitation than by our doing\nthem ourselves. Some are unwilling to hear about their age and grey\nhairs, and all the rest of what men pray to arrive at. The reproach\nof poverty agonizes some men, and whoever conceals it makes it a\nreproach to himself; and therefore if you of your own accord are\nthe first to acknowledge it, you cut the ground from under the feet\nof those who would sneer and politely insult you; no one is laughed\nat who begins by laughing at himself. Tradition tells us that\nVatinius, a man born both to be laughed at and hated, was a witty\nand clever jester. He made many jokes about his feet and his short\nneck, and thus escaped the sarcasms of Cicero above all, and of his\nother enemies, of whom he had more than he had diseases. If he, who\nthrough constant abuse had forgotten how to blush, could do this\nby sheer brazenness, why should not he who has made some progress\nin the education of a gentleman and the study of philosophy? Besides,\nit is a sort of revenge to spoil a man\u2019s {44} enjoyment of the\ninsult he has offered to us; such men say, \u201cDear me, I suppose he\ndid not understand it.\u201d Thus the success of an insult lies in the\nsensitiveness and rage of the victim; hereafter the insulter will\nsometimes meet his match; some one will be found to revenge you\nalso.\nXVIII. Gaius Caesar, among the other vices with which he overflowed,\nwas possessed by a strange insolent passion for marking every one\nwith some note of ridicule, he himself being the most tempting\nsubject for derision; so ugly was the paleness which proved him\nmad, so savage the glare of the eyes which lurked under his old\nwoman\u2019s brow, so hideous his misshapen head, bald and dotted about\nwith a few cherished hairs; besides the neck set thick with bristles,\nhis thin legs, his monstrous feet. It would be endless were I to\nmention all the insults which he heaped upon his parents and\nancestors, and people of every class of life. I will mention those\nwhich brought him to ruin. An especial friend of his was Asiaticus\nValerius, a proud-spirited man and one hardly likely to put up with\nanother\u2019s insults quietly. At a drinking bout, that is, a public\nassembly, Gaius, at the top of his voice, reproached this man with\nthe way his wife behaved in bed. Good gods! that a man should hear\nthat the emperor knew this, and that he, the emperor, should describe\nhis adultery and his disappointment to the lady\u2019s husband, I do not\nsay to a man of consular rank and his own friend. Chaerea, on the\nother hand, the military tribune, had a voice not befitting his\nprowess, feeble in sound, and somewhat suspicious unless you knew\nhis achievements. When he asked for the watchword Gaius at one time\ngave him \u201cVenus,\u201d and at another \u201cPriapus,\u201d and by various means\nreproached the man-at-arms with effeminate vice; while he himself\nwas dressed in transparent clothes, wearing sandals and jewellery.\nThus he forced him to use his sword, that he might not have to ask\nfor the watchword oftener; it was Chaerea who {45} first of all the\nconspirators raised his hand, who cut through the middle of Caligula\u2019s\nneck with one blow. After that, many swords, belonging to men who\nhad public or private injuries to avenge, were thrust into his body,\nbut he first showed himself a man who seemed least like one. The\nsame Gaius construed everything as an insult (since those who are\nmost eager to offer affronts are least able to endure them). He was\nangry with Herennius Macer for having greeted him as Gaius\u2014nor did\nthe chief centurion of triarii get off scot-free for having saluted\nhim as Caligula; having been born in the camp and brought up as the\nchild of the legions, he had been wont to be called by this name,\nnor was there any by which he was better known to the troops, but\nby this time he held \u201cCaligula\u201d to be a reproach and a dishonour.\nLet wounded spirits, then, console themselves with this reflexion,\nthat, even though our easy temper may have neglected to revenge\nitself, nevertheless that there will be some one who will punish\nthe impertinent, proud, and insulting man, for these are vices which\nhe never confines to one victim or one single offensive act. Let\nus look at the examples of those men whose endurance we admire, as,\nfor instance, that of Socrates, who took in good part the published\nand acted jibes of the comedians upon himself, and laughed no less\nthan he did when he was drenched with dirty water by his wife\nXanthippe. Antisthenes was reproached with his mother being a\nbarbarian and a Thracian; he answered that the mother of the gods,\ntoo, came from Mount Ida.\nXIX. We ought not to engage in quarrels and wrangling; we ought to\nbetake ourselves far away and to disregard everything of this kind\nwhich thoughtless people do (indeed thoughtless people alone do\nit), and to set equal value upon the honours and the reproaches of\nthe mob; we ought not to be hurt by the one or to be pleased by the\nother. Otherwise we shall neglect many essential points, shall\ndesert our {46} duty both to the state and in private life through\nexcessive fear of insults or weariness of them, and sometimes we\nshall even miss what would do us good, while tortured by this\nwomanish pain at hearing something not to our mind. Sometimes, too,\nwhen enraged with powerful men we shall expose this failing by our\nreckless freedom of speech; yet it is not freedom to suffer nothing\u2014we\nare mistaken\u2014freedom consists in raising one\u2019s mind superior to\ninjuries and becoming a person whose pleasures come from himself\nalone, in separating oneself from external circumstances that one\nmay not have to lead a disturbed life in fear of the laughter and\ntongues of all men; for if any man can offer an insult, who is there\nwho cannot? The wise man and the would-be wise man will apply\ndifferent remedies to this; for it is only those whose philosophical\neducation is incomplete, and who still guide themselves by public\nopinion, who would suppose that they ought to spend their lives in\nthe midst of insults and injuries; yet all things happen in a more\nendurable fashion to men who are prepared for them. The nobler a\nman is by birth, by reputation, or by inheritance, the more bravely\nhe should bear himself, remembering that the tallest men stand in\nthe front rank in battle. As for insults, offensive language, marks\nof disgrace, and such-like disfigurements, he ought to bear them\nas he would bear the shouts of the enemy, and darts or stones flung\nfrom a distance, which rattle upon his helmet without causing a\nwound; while he should look upon injuries as wounds, some received\non his armour and others on his body, which, he endures without\nfalling or even leaving his place in the ranks. Even though you be\nhard pressed and violently attacked by the enemy, still it is base\nto give way; hold the post assigned to you by nature. You ask, what\nthis post is? it is that of being a man. The wise man has another\nhelp, of the opposite kind to this; you are hard at work, while he\nhas already won the victory. Do not {47} quarrel with your own good\nadvantage, and, until you shall have made your way to the truth,\nkeep alive this hope in your minds, be willing to receive the news\nof a better life, and encourage it by your admiration and your\nprayers; it is to the interest of the commonwealth of mankind that\nthere should be some one who is unconquered, some one against whom\nfortune has no power.\n[1] Xerxes.\n[2] Scipio.\n[3] The Stoics.\n[4] Seneca here speaks of men wearing the toga as officials,\ncontrasted with the mass of Roman citizens, among whom the wearing\nof the toga was already falling into disuse in the time of Augustus.\nSee Macrob., \u201cSat.,\u201d vi. 5 extr., and Suetonius, \u201cLife of Octavius,\u201d\n40, where the author mentions that Augustus used sarcastically to\napply the verse, Virg., \u2018Aen.,\u2019 i. 282, to the Romans of his day.\n[5] See note, \u201cDe Beneficiis,\u201d vi. 33.\n[6] Gertz reads \u2018decet emere venalia,\u2019 \u2018there is no harm in buying\nwhat is for sale.\u2019\n{48}\nTHE THIRD BOOK OF THE DIALOGUES OF L. ANNAEUS SENECA, ADDRESSED TO\nNOVATUS.\nOF ANGER.\nBook I.\nYou have demanded of me, Novatus, that I should write how anger may\nbe soothed, and it appears to me that you are right in feeling\nespecial fear of this passion, which is above all others hideous\nand wild: for the others have some alloy of peace and quiet, but\nthis consists wholly in action and the impulse of grief, raging\nwith an utterly inhuman lust for arms, blood and tortures, careless\nof itself provided it hurts another, rushing upon the very point\nof the sword, and greedy for revenge even when it drags the avenger\nto ruin with itself. Some of the wisest of men have in consequence\nof this called anger a short madness: for it is equally devoid of\nself control, regardless of decorum, forgetful of kinship, obstinately\nengrossed in whatever it begins to do, deaf to reason and advice,\nexcited by trifling causes, awkward at perceiving what is true and\njust, and very like a falling rock which breaks itself to pieces\nupon the very thing which it crushes. That you may know that they\nwhom anger possesses are not sane, look at their appearance; for\nas there are distinct symptoms which mark madmen, such as a bold\nand menacing air, a gloomy {49} brow, a stern face, a hurried walk,\nrestless hands, changed colour, quick and strongly-drawn breathing;\nthe signs of angry men, too, are the same: their eyes blaze and\nsparkle, their whole face is a deep red with the blood which boils\nup from the bottom of their heart, their lips quiver, their teeth\nare set, their hair bristles and stands on end, their breath is\nlaboured and hissing; their joints crack as they twist them about,\nthey groan, bellow, and burst into scarcely intelligible talk, they\noften clap their hands together and stamp on the ground with their\nfeet, and their whole body is highly-strung and plays those tricks\nwhich mark a distraught mind, so as to furnish an ugly and shocking\npicture of self-perversion and excitement. You cannot tell whether\nthis vice is more execrable or more disgusting. Other vices can be\nconcealed and cherished in secret; anger shows itself openly and\nappears in the countenance, and the greater it is, the more plainly\nit boils forth. Do you not see how in all animals certain signs\nappear before they proceed to mischief, and how their entire bodies\nput off their usual quiet appearance and stir up their ferocity?\nBoars foam at the mouth and sharpen their teeth by rubbing them\nagainst trees, bulls toss their horns in the air and scatter the\nsand with blows of their feet, lions growl, the necks of enraged\nsnakes swell, mad dogs have a sullen look\u2014there is no animal so\nhateful and venomous by nature that it does not, when seized by\nanger, show additional fierceness. I know well that the other\npassions, can hardly be concealed, and that lust, fear, and boldness\ngive signs of their presence and may be discovered beforehand, for\nthere is no one of the stronger passions that does not affect the\ncountenance: what then is the difference between them and anger?\nWhy, that the other passions are visible, but that this is conspicuous.\nII. Next, if you choose to view its results and the mischief that\nit does, no plague has cost the human race {50} more dear: you will\nsee slaughterings and poisonings, accusations and counter-accusations,\nsacking of cities, ruin of whole peoples, the persons of princes\nsold into slavery by auction, torches applied to roofs, and fires\nnot merely confined within city-walls but making whole tracts of\ncountry glow with hostile flame. See the foundations of the most\ncelebrated cities hardly now to be discerned; they were ruined by\nanger. See deserts extending for many miles without an inhabitant:\nthey have been desolated by anger. See all the chiefs whom tradition\nmentions as instances of ill fate; anger stabbed one of them in his\nbed, struck down another, though he was protected by the sacred\nrights of hospitality, tore another to pieces in the very home of\nthe laws and in sight of the crowded forum, bade one shed his own\nblood by the parricide hand of his son, another to have his royal\nthroat cut by the hand of a slave, another to stretch out his limbs\non the cross: and hitherto I am speaking merely of individual cases.\nWhat, if you were to pass from the consideration of those single\nmen against whom anger has broken out to view whole assemblies cut\ndown by the sword, the people butchered by the soldiery let loose\nupon it, and whole nations condemned to death in one common ruin .\n. . .[1] as though by {51} men who either freed themselves from our\ncharge or despised our authority? Why, wherefore is the people angry\nwith gladiators, and so unjust as to think itself wronged if they\ndo not die cheerfully? It thinks itself scorned, and by looks,\ngestures, and excitement turns itself from a mere spectator into\nan adversary. Everything of this sort is not anger, but the semblance\nof anger, like that of boys who want to beat the ground when they\nhave fallen upon it, and who often do not even know why they are\nangry, but are merely angry without any reason or having received\nany injury, yet not without some semblance of injury received, or\nwithout some wish to exact a penalty for it. Thus they are deceived\nby the likeness of blows, and are appeased by the pretended tears\nof those who deprecate their wrath, and thus an unreal grief is\nhealed by an unreal revenge.\nIII. \u201cWe often are angry,\u201d says our adversary, \u201cnot with men who\nhave hurt us, but with men who are going to hurt us: so you may be\nsure that anger is not born of injury.\u201d It is true that we are angry\nwith those who are going to hurt us, but they do already hurt us\nin intention, and one who is going to do an injury is already doing\nit. \u201cThe weakest of men,\u201d argues he, \u201care often angry with the most\npowerful: so you may be sure that anger is not a desire to punish\ntheir antagonist\u2014for men do not desire to punish him when they\ncannot hope to do so.\u201d In the first place, I spoke of a desire to\ninflict punishment, not a power to do so: now men desire even what\nthey cannot obtain. In the next place, no one is so low in station\nas not to be able to hope to inflict punishment even upon the\ngreatest of men: we all are powerful for mischief. {52} Aristotle\u2019s\ndefinition differs little from mine: for he declares anger to be a\ndesire to repay suffering. It would be a long task to examine the\ndifferences between his definition and mine: it may be urged against\nboth of them that wild beasts become angry without being excited\nby injury, and without any idea of punishing others or requiting\nthem with pain: for, even though they do these things, these are\nnot what they aim at doing. We must admit, however, that neither\nwild beasts nor any other creature except man is subject to anger:\nfor, whilst anger is the foe of reason, it nevertheless does not\narise in any place where reason cannot dwell. Wild beasts have\nimpulses, fury, cruelty, combativeness: they have not anger any\nmore than they have luxury: yet they indulge in some pleasures with\nless self-control than human beings. Do not believe the poet who\nsays:\n\u201cThe boar his wrath forgets, the stag forgets the hounds.  The\nbear forgets how \u2019midst the herd he leaped with frantic bounds.\u201d[2]\nWhen he speaks of beasts being angry he means that they are excited,\nroused up: for indeed they know no more how to be angry than they\nknow how to pardon. Dumb creatures have not human feelings, but\nhave certain impulses which resemble them: for if it were not so,\nif they could feel love and hate, they would likewise be capable\nof friendship and enmity, of disagreement and agreement. Some traces\nof these qualities exist even in them, though properly all of them,\nwhether good or bad, belong to the human breast alone. To no creature\nbesides man has been given wisdom, foresight, industry, and reflexion.\nTo animals not only human virtues but even human vices are forbidden:\ntheir whole constitution, mental and bodily, is unlike that of human\nbeings: in them the royal[3] and {53} leading principle is drawn\nfrom another source, as, for instance, they possess a voice, yet\nnot a clear one, but indistinct and incapable of forming words: a\ntongue, but one which is fettered and not sufficiently nimble for\ncomplex movements: so, too, they possess intellect, the greatest\nattribute of all, but in a rough and inexact condition. It is,\nconsequently, able to grasp those visions and semblances which rouse\nit to action, but only in a cloudy and indistinct fashion. It follows\nfrom this that their impulses and outbreaks are violent, and that\nthey do not feel fear, anxieties, grief, or anger, but some semblances\nof these feelings: wherefore they quickly drop them and adopt the\nconverse of them: they graze after showing the most vehement rage\nand terror, and after frantic bellowing and plunging they straightway\nsink into quiet sleep.\nIV. What anger is has been sufficiently explained. The difference\nbetween it and irascibility is evident: it is the same as that\nbetween a drunken man and a drunkard; between a frightened man and\na coward. It is possible for an angry man not to be irascible; an\nirascible man may sometimes not be angry. I shall omit the other\nvarieties of anger, which the Greeks distinguish by various names,\nbecause we have no distinctive words for them in our language,\nalthough we call men bitter, and harsh, and also peevish, frantic,\nclamorous, surly, and fierce: all of which are different forms of\nirascibility. Among these you may class sulkiness, a refined form\nof irascibility; for there are some sorts of anger which go no\nfurther than noise, while some are as lasting as they are common:\nsome are fierce in deed, but inclined to be sparing of words: some\nexpend themselves in bitter words and curses: some do not go beyond\ncomplaining and turning one\u2019s back: some are great, deep-seated,\nand brood within a man: there are a thousand other forms of a\nmultiform evil.\nV. We have now finished our enquiry as to what anger {54} is, whether\nit exists in any other creature besides man, what the difference\nis between it and irascibility, and how many forms it possesses.\nLet us now enquire whether anger be in accordance with nature, and\nwhether it be useful and worth entertaining in some measure.\nWhether it be according to nature will become evident if we consider\nman\u2019s nature, than which what is more gentle while it is in its\nproper condition? Yet what is more cruel than anger? What is more\naffectionate to others than man? Yet what is more savage against\nthem than anger? Mankind is born for mutual assistance, anger for\nmutual ruin: the former loves society, the latter estrangement. The\none loves to do good, the other to do harm; the one to help even\nstrangers, the other to attack even its dearest friends. The one\nis ready even to sacrifice itself for the good of others, the other\nto plunge into peril provided it drags others with it. Who, then,\ncan be more ignorant of nature than he who classes this cruel and\nhurtful vice as belonging to her best and most polished work? Anger,\nas we have said, is eager to punish; and that such a desire should\nexist in man\u2019s peaceful breast is least of all according to his\nnature; for human life is founded on benefits and harmony, and is\nbound together into an alliance for the common help of all, not by\nterror, but by love towards one another.\nVI. \u201cWhat, then? Is not correction sometimes necessary?\u201d Of course\nit is; but with discretion, not with anger; for it does not injure,\nbut heals under the guise of injury. We char crooked spearshafts\nto straighten them, and force them by driving in wedges, not in\norder to break them, but to take the bends out of them; and, in\nlike manner, by applying pain to the body or mind we correct\ndispositions which have been rendered crooked by vice. So the\nphysician at first, when dealing with slight disorders, tries not\nto make much change in his patient\u2019s daily habits, to regulate {55}\nhis food, drink, and exercise, and to improve his health merely by\naltering the order in which he takes them. The next step is to see\nwhether an alteration in their amount will be of service. If neither\nalteration of the order or of the amount is of use, he cuts off\nsome and reduces others. If even this does not answer, he forbids\nfood, and disburdens the body by fasting. If milder remedies have\nproved useless he opens a vein; if the extremities are injuring the\nbody and infecting it with disease he lays his hands upon the limbs;\nyet none of his treatment is considered harsh if its result is to\ngive health. Similarly, it is the duty of the chief administrator\nof the laws, or the ruler of a state, to correct ill-disposed men,\nas long as he is able, with words, and even with gentle ones, that\nhe may persuade them to do what they ought, inspire them with a\nlove of honour and justice, and cause them to hate vice and set\nstore upon virtue. He must then pass on to severer language, still\nconfining himself to advising and reprimanding; last of all he must\nbetake himself to punishments, yet still making them slight and\ntemporary. He ought to assign extreme punishments only to extreme\ncrimes, that no one may die unless it be even to the criminal\u2019s own\nadvantage that he should die. He will differ from the physician in\none point alone; for whereas physicians render it easy to die for\nthose to whom they cannot grant the boon of life, he will drive the\ncondemned out of life with ignominy and disgrace, not because he\ntakes pleasure in any man\u2019s being punished, for the wise man is far\nfrom such inhuman ferocity, but that they may be a warning to all\nmen, and that, since they would not be useful when alive, the state\nmay at any rate profit by their death. Man\u2019s nature is not, therefore,\ndesirous of inflicting punishment; neither, therefore, is anger in\naccordance with man\u2019s nature, because that is desirous of inflicting\npunishment. I will also adduce Plato\u2019s argument\u2014for what harm is\nthere in using {56} other men\u2019s arguments, so far as they are on\nour side? \u201cA good man,\u201d says he, \u201cdoes not do any hurt: it is only\npunishment which hurts. Punishment, therefore, does not accord with\na good man: wherefore anger does not do so either, because punishment\nand anger accord one with another. If a good man takes no pleasure\nin punishment, he will also take no pleasure in that state of mind\nto which punishment gives pleasure: consequently anger is not natural\nto man.\u201d\nVII. May it not be that, although anger be not natural, it may be\nright to adopt it, because it often proves useful? It rouses the\nspirit and excites it; and courage does nothing grand in war without\nit, unless its flame be supplied from this source; this is the goad\nwhich stirs up bold men and sends them to encounter perils. Some\ntherefore consider it to be best to control anger, not to banish\nit utterly, but to cut off its extravagances, and force it to keep\nwithin useful bounds, so as to retain that part of it without which\naction will become languid and all strength and activity of mind\nwill die away.\nIn the first place, it is easier to banish dangerous passions than\nto rule them; it is easier not to admit them than to keep them in\norder when admitted; for when they have established themselves in\npossession of the mind they are more powerful than the lawful ruler,\nand will in no wise permit themselves to be weakened or abridged.\nIn the next place, Reason herself, who holds the reins, is only\nstrong while she remains apart from the passions; if she mixes and\nbefouls herself with them she becomes no longer able to restrain\nthose whom she might once have cleared out of her path; for the\nmind, when once excited and shaken up, goes whither the passions\ndrive it. There are certain things whose beginnings lie in our own\npower, but which, when developed, drag us along by their own force\nand leave us no retreat. Those who have flung themselves over a\nprecipice {57} have no control over their movements, nor can they\nstop or slacken their pace when once started, for their own headlong\nand irremediable rashness has left no room for either reflexion or\nremorse, and they cannot help going to lengths which they might\nhave avoided. So, also, the mind, when it has abandoned itself to\nanger, love, or any other passion, is unable to check itself: its\nown weight and the downward tendency of vices must needs carry the\nman off and hurl him into the lowest depth.\nVIII. The best plan is to reject straightway the first incentives\nto anger, to resist its very beginnings, and to take care not to\nbe betrayed into it: for if once it begins to carry us away, it is\nhard to get back again into a healthy condition, because reason\ngoes for nothing when once passion has been admitted to the mind,\nand has by our own free will been given a certain authority, it\nwill for the future do as much as it chooses, not only as much as\nyou will allow it. The enemy, I repeat, must be met and driven back\nat the outermost frontier-line: for when he has once entered the\ncity and passed its gates, he will not allow his prisoners to set\nbounds to his victory. The mind does not stand apart and view its\npassions from without, so as not to permit them to advance further\nthan they ought, but it is itself changed into a passion, and is\ntherefore unable to check what once was useful and wholesome strength,\nnow that it has become degenerate and misapplied: for passion and\nreason, as I said before, have not distinct and separate provinces,\nbut consist of the changes of the mind itself for better or for\nworse. How then can reason recover itself when it is conquered and\nheld down by vices, when it has given way to anger? or how can it\nextricate itself from a confused mixture, the greater part of which\nconsists of the lower qualities? \u201cBut,\u201d argues our adversary, \u201csome\nmen when in anger control themselves.\u201d Do they so far control\nthemselves that they do nothing which anger dictates, or some {58}\nwhat? If they do nothing thereof, it becomes evident that anger is\nnot essential to the conduct of affairs, although your sect advocated\nit as possessing greater strength than reason . . . . Finally, I\nask, is anger stronger or weaker than reason? If stronger, how can\nreason impose any check upon it, since it is only the less powerful\nthat obey: if weaker, then reason is competent to effect its ends\nwithout anger, and does not need the help of a less powerful quality.\n\u201cBut some angry men remain consistent and control themselves.\u201d When\ndo they do so? It is when their anger is disappearing and leaving\nthem of its own accord, not when it was red-hot, for then it was\nmore powerful than they. What then? do not men, even in the height\nof their anger, sometimes let their enemies go whole and unhurt,\nand refrain from injuring them? \u201cThey do: but when do they do so?\nIt is when one passion overpowers another, and either fear or greed\ngets the upper hand for a while. On such occasions, it is not thanks\nto reason that anger is stilled, but owing to an untrustworthy and\nfleeting truce between the passions.\nIX. In the next place, anger has nothing useful in itself, and does\nnot rouse up the mind to warlike deeds: for a virtue, being\nself-sufficient, never needs the assistance of a vice: whenever it\nneeds an impetuous effort, it does not become angry, but rises to\nthe occasion, and excites or soothes itself as far as it deems\nrequisite, just as the machines which hurl darts may be twisted to\na greater or lesser degree of tension at the manager\u2019s pleasure.\n\u201cAnger,\u201d says Aristotle, \u201cis necessary, nor can any fight be won\nwithout it, unless it fills the mind, and kindles up the spirit.\nIt must, however, be made use of, not as a general, but as a soldier,\u201d\nNow this is untrue; for if it listens to reason and follows whither\nreason leads, it is no longer anger, whose characteristic is\nobstinacy: if, again, it is disobedient and will not be quiet when\nordered, but is carried away by its own {59} wilful and headstrong\nspirit, it is then as useless an aid to the mind as a soldier who\ndisregards the sounding of the retreat would be to a general. If,\ntherefore, anger allows limits to be imposed upon it, it must be\ncalled by some other name, and ceases to be anger, which I understand\nto be unbridled and unmanageable: and if it does not allow limits\nto be imposed upon it, it is harmful and not to be counted among\naids: wherefore either anger is not anger, or it is useless: for\nif any man demands the infliction of punishment, not because he is\neager for the punishment itself, but because it is right to inflict\nit, he ought not to be counted as an angry man: that will be the\nuseful soldier, who knows how to obey orders: the passions cannot\nobey any more than they can command.\nX. For this cause reason will never call to its aid blind and fierce\nimpulses, over whom she herself possesses no authority, and which\nshe never can restrain save by setting against them similar and\nequally powerful passions, as for example, fear against anger, anger\nagainst sloth, greed against timidity. May virtue never come to\nsuch a pass, that reason should fly for aid to vices! The mind can\nfind no safe repose there, it must needs be shaken and tempest-tossed\nif it be safe only because of its own defects, if it cannot be brave\nwithout anger, diligent without greed, quiet without fear: such is\nthe despotism under which a man must live if he becomes the slave\nof a passion. Are you not ashamed to put virtues under the patronage\nof vices? Then, too, reason ceases to have any power if she can do\nnothing without passion, and begins to be equal and like unto\npassion; for what difference is there between them if passion without\nreason be as rash as reason without passion is helpless? They are\nboth on the same level, if one cannot exist without the other. Yet\nwho could endure that passion should be made equal to reason? \u201cThen,\u201d\nsays our adversary, \u201cpassion is useful, provided it be moderate.\u201d\n{60} Nay, only if it be useful by nature: but if it be disobedient\nto authority and reason, al that we gain by its moderation is that\nthe less there is of it, the less harm it does: wherefore a moderate\npassion is nothing but a moderate evil.\nXI. \u201cBut,\u201d argues he, \u201cagainst our enemies anger is necessary.\u201d In\nno case is it less necessary; since our attacks ought not to be\ndisorderly, but regulated and under control. What, indeed, is it\nexcept anger, so ruinous to itself, that overthrows barbarians, who\nhave so much more bodily strength than we, and are so much better\nable to endure fatigue? Gladiators, too, protect themselves by\nskill, but expose themselves to wounds when they are angry. Moreover,\nof what use is anger, when the same end can be arrived at by reason?\nDo you suppose that a hunter is angry with the beasts he kills? Yet\nhe meets them when they attack him, and follows them when they flee\nfrom him, all of which is managed by reason without anger. When so\nmany thousands of Cimbri and Teutones poured over the Alps, what\nwas it that caused them to perish so completely, that no messenger,\nonly common rumour, carried the news of that great defeat to their\nhomes, except that with them anger stood in the place of courage?\nand anger, although sometimes it overthrows and breaks to pieces\nwhatever it meets, yet is more often its own destruction. Who can\nbe braver than the Germans? who charge more boldly? who have more\nlove of arms, among which they are born and bred, for which alone\nthey care, to the neglect of everything else? Who can be more\nhardened to undergo every hardship, since a large part of them have\nno store of clothing for the body, no shelter from the continual\nrigour of the climate: yet Spaniards and Gauls, and even the unwarlike\nraces of Asia and Syria cut them down before the main legion comes\nwithin sight, nothing but their own irascibility exposing them to\ndeath. Give but intelligence to those {61} minds, and discipline\nto those bodies of theirs, which now are ignorant of vicious\nrefinements, luxury, and wealth,\u2014to say nothing more, we should\ncertainly be obliged to go back to the ancient Roman habits of life.\nBy what did Fabius restore the shattered forces of the state, except\nby knowing how to delay and spin out time, which angry men know not\nhow to do? The empire, which then was at its last gasp, would have\nperished if Fabius had been as daring as anger urged him to be: but\nhe took thought about the condition of affairs, and after counting\nhis force, no part of which could be lost without everything being\nlost with it, he laid aside thoughts of grief and revenge, turning\nhis sole attention to what was profitable and to making the most\nof his opportunities, and conquered his anger before he conquered\nHannibal. What did Scipio do? Did he not leave behind Hannibal and\nthe Carthaginian army, and all with whom he had a right to be angry,\nand carry over the war into Africa with such deliberation that he\nmade his enemies think him luxurious and lazy? What did the second\nScipio do? Did he not remain a long, long time before Numantia, and\nbear with calmness the reproach to himself and to his country that\nNumantia took longer to conquer than Carthage? By blockading and\ninvesting his enemies, he brought them to such straits that they\nperished by their own swords. Anger, therefore, is not useful even\nin wars or battles: for it is prone to rashness, and while trying\nto bring others into danger, does not guard itself against danger.\nThe most trustworthy virtue is that which long and carefully considers\nitself, controls itself, and slowly and deliberately brings itself\nto the front.\nXII. \u201cWhat, then,\u201d asks our adversary, \u201cis a good man not to be\nangry if he sees his father murdered or his mother outraged?\u201d No,\nhe will not be angry, but will avenge them, or protect them. Why\ndo you fear that {62} filial piety will not prove a sufficient spur\nto him even without anger? You may as well say\u2014\u201cWhat then? When a\ngood man sees his father or his son being cut down, I suppose he\nwill not weep or faint,\u201d as we see women do whenever any trifling\nrumour of danger reaches them. The good man will do his duty without\ndisturbance or fear, and he will perform the duty of a good man,\nso as to do nothing unworthy of a man. My father will be murdered:\nthen I will defend him: he has been slain, then I will avenge him,\nnot because I am grieved, but because it is my duty. \u201cGood men are\nmade angry by injuries done to their friends.\u201d When you say this,\nTheophrastus, you seek to throw discredit upon more manly maxims;\nyou leave the judge and appeal to the mob: because every one is\nangry when such things befall his own friends, you suppose that men\nwill decide that it is their duty to do what they do: for as a rule\nevery man considers a passion which he recognises to be a righteous\none. But he does the same thing if the hot water is not ready for\nhis drink, if a glass be broken, or his shoe splashed with mud. It\nis not filial piety, but weakness of mind that produces this anger,\nas children weep when they lose their parents, just as they do when\nthey lose their toys. To feel anger on behalf of one\u2019s friends does\nnot show a loving, but a weak mind: it is admirable and worthy\nconduct to stand forth as the defender of one\u2019s parents, children,\nfriends, and countrymen, at the call of duty itself, acting of one\u2019s\nown free will, forming a deliberate judgment, and looking forward\nto the future, not in an impulsive, frenzied fashion. No passion\nis more eager for revenge than anger, and for that very reason it\nis unapt to obtain it: being over hasty and frantic, like almost\nall desires, it hinders itself in the attainment of its own object,\nand therefore has never been useful either in peace or war: for it\nmakes peace like war, and when in arms forgets that Mars belongs\n{63} to neither side, and falls into the power of the enemy, because\nit is not in its own. In the next place, vices ought not to be\nreceived into common use because on some occasions they have effected\nsomewhat: for so also fevers are good for certain kinds of ill-health,\nbut nevertheless it is better to be altogether free from them: it\nis a hateful mode of cure to owe one\u2019s health to disease. Similarly,\nalthough anger, like poison, or falling headlong, or being shipwrecked,\nmay have unexpectedly done good, yet it ought not on that account\nto be classed as wholesome, for poisons have often proved good for\nthe health.\nXIII. Moreover, qualities which we ought to possess become better\nand more desirable the more extensive they are: if justice is a\ngood thing, no one will say that it would be better if any part\nwere subtracted from it; if bravery is a good thing, no one would\nwish it to be in any way curtailed: consequently the greater anger\nis, the better it is, for who ever objected to a good thing being\nincreased? But it is not expedient that anger should be increased:\ntherefore it is not expedient that it should exist at all, for that\nwhich grows bad by increase cannot be a good thing. \u201cAnger is\nuseful,\u201d says our adversary, \u201cbecause it makes men more ready to\nfight.\u201d According to that mode of reasoning, then, drunkenness also\nis a good thing, for it makes men insolent and daring, and many use\ntheir weapons better when the worse for liquor: nay, according to\nthat reasoning, also, you may call frenzy and madness essential to\nstrength, because madness often makes men stronger. Why, does not\nfear often by the rule of contraries make men bolder, and does not\nthe terror of death rouse up even arrant cowards to join battle?\nYet anger, drunkenness, fear, and the like, are base and temporary\nincitements to action, and can furnish no arms to virtue, which has\nno need of vices, although they may at times be of some little\nassistance to sluggish and cowardly minds. {64} No man becomes\nbraver through anger, except one who without anger would not have\nbeen brave at all: anger does not therefore come to assist courage,\nbut to take its place. What are we to say to the argument that, if\nanger were a good thing it would attach itself to all the best men?\nYet the most irascible of creatures are infants, old men, and sick\npeople. Every weakling is naturally prone to complaint.\nXIV. It is impossible, says Theophrastus, for a good man not to be\nangry with bad men. By this reasoning, the better a man is, the\nmore irascible he will be: yet will he not rather be more tranquil,\nmore free from passions, and hating no one: indeed, what reason has\nhe for hating sinners, since it is error that leads them into such\ncrimes? now it does not become a sensible man to hate the erring,\nsince if so he will hate himself: let him think how many things he\ndoes contrary to good morals, how much of what he has done stands\nin need of pardon, and he will soon become angry with himself also,\nfor no righteous judge pronounces a different judgment in his own\ncase and in that of others. No one, I affirm, will be found who can\nacquit himself. Every one when he calls himself innocent looks\nrather to external witnesses than to his own conscience. How much\nmore philanthropic it is to deal with the erring in a gentle and\nfatherly spirit, and to call them into the right course instead of\nhunting them down? When a man is wandering about our fields because\nhe has lost his way, it is better to place him on the right path\nthan to drive him away.\nXV. The sinner ought, therefore, to be corrected both by warning\nand by force, both by gentle and harsh means, and may be made a\nbetter man both towards himself and others by chastisement, but not\nby anger: for who is angry with the patient whose wounds he is\ntending? \u201cBut they cannot be corrected, and there is nothing in\nthem that is {65} gentle or that admits of good hope.\u201d Then let\nthem be removed from mortal society, if they are likely to deprave\nevery one with whom they come in contact, and let them cease to be\nbad men in the only way in which they can: yet let this be done\nwithout hatred: for what reason have I for hating the man to whom\nI am doing the greatest good, since I am rescuing him from himself?\nDoes a man hate his own limbs when he cuts them off? That is not\nan act of anger, but a lamentable method of healing. We knock mad\ndogs on the head, we slaughter fierce and savage bulls, and we doom\nscabby sheep to the knife, lest they should infect our flocks: we\ndestroy monstrous births, and we also drown our children if they\nare born weakly or unnaturally formed; to separate what is useless\nfrom what is sound is an act, not of anger, but of reason. Nothing\nbecomes one who inflicts punishment less than anger, because the\npunishment has all the more power to work reformation if the sentence\nbe pronounced with deliberate judgment. This is why Socrates said\nto the slave, \u201cI would strike you, were I not angry.\u201d He put off\nthe correction of the slave to a calmer season; at the moment, he\ncorrected himself. Who can boast that he has his passions, under\ncontrol, when Socrates did not dare to trust himself to his anger?\nXVI. We do not, therefore, need an angry chastiser to punish the\nerring and wicked: for since anger is a crime of the mind, it is\nnot right that sins should be punished by sin. \u201cWhat! am I not to\nbe angry with a robber, or a poisoner?\u201d No: for I am not angry with\nmyself when I bleed myself. I apply all kinds of punishment as\nremedies. You are as yet only in the first stage of error, and do\nnot go wrong seriously, although you do so often: then I will try\nto amend you by a reprimand given first in private and then in\npublic.[4] You, again, have gone {66} too far to be restored to\nvirtue by words alone; you must be kept in order by disgrace. For\nthe next, some stronger measure is required, something that he can\nfeel must be branded upon him; you, sir, shall be sent into exile\nand to a desert place. The next man\u2019s thorough villany needs harsher\nremedies: chains and public imprisonment must be applied to him.\nYou, lastly, have an incurably vicious mind, and add crime to crime:\nyou have come to such a pass, that you are not influenced by the\narguments which are never wanting to recommend evil, but sin itself\nis to you a sufficient reason for sinning: you have so steeped your\nwhole heart in wickedness, that wickedness cannot be taken from you\nwithout bringing your heart with it. Wretched man! you have long\nsought to die; we will do you good service, we will take away that\nmadness from which you suffer, and to you who have so long lived a\nmisery to yourself and to others, we will give the only good thing\nwhich remains, that is, death. Why should I be angry with a man\njust when I am doing him good: sometimes the truest form of compassion\nis to put a man to death. If I were a skilled and learned physician,\nand were to enter a hospital, or a rich[5] man\u2019s house, I should\nnot have prescribed the same treatment for all the patients who\nwere suffering from various diseases. I see different kinds of vice\nin the vast number of different minds, and am called in to heal the\nwhole body of citizens: let us seek for the remedies proper for\neach disease. This man may be cured by his own sense of honour,\nthat one by travel, that one by pain, that one by want, that one\nby the sword. If, therefore, it becomes my duty as a magistrate to\nput on black[6] robes, and summon an assembly by the sound of a\n{67} trumpet,[7] I shall walk to the seat of judgment not in a rage\nor in a hostile spirit, but with the countenance of a judge; I shall\npronounce the formal sentence in a grave and gentle rather than a\nfurious voice, and shall bid them proceed {68} sternly, yet not\nangrily. Even when I command a criminal to be beheaded, when I sew\na parricide up in a sack, when I send a man to be punished by\nmilitary law, when I fling a traitor or public enemy down the\nTarpeian Rock, I shall be free from anger, and shall look and feel\njust as though I were crushing snakes and other venomous creatures.\n\u201cAnger is necessary to enable us to punish.\u201d What? do you think\nthat the law is angry with men whom it does not know, whom it has\nnever seen, who it hopes will never exist? We ought, therefore, to\nadopt the law\u2019s frame of mind, which does not become angry, but\nmerely defines offences: for, if it is right for a good man to be\nangry at wicked crimes, it will also be right for him to be moved\nwith envy at the prosperity of wicked men: what, indeed, is more\nscandalous than that in some cases the very men, for whose deserts\nno fortune could be found bad enough, should flourish and actually\nbe the spoiled children of success? Yet he will see their affluence\nwithout envy, just as he sees their crimes without anger: a good\njudge condemns wrongful acts, but does not hate them. \u201cWhat then?\nwhen the wise man is dealing with something of this kind, will his\nmind not be affected by it and become excited beyond its usual\nwont?\u201d I admit that it will: he will experience a slight and trifling\nemotion; for, as Zeno says, \u201cEven in the mind of the wise man, a\nscar remains after the wound is quite healed.\u201d He will, therefore,\nfeel certain hints and semblances of passions; but he will be free\nfrom the passions themselves.\nXVII. Aristotle says that \u201ccertain passions, if one makes a proper\nuse of them, act as arms\u201d: which would be true if, like weapons of\nwar, they could be taken up or laid aside at the pleasure of their\nwielder. These arms, which Aristotle assigns to virtue, fight of\ntheir own accord, do not wait to be seized by the hand, and possess\na man instead of being possessed by him. We have no need of {69}\nexternal weapons, nature has equipped us sufficiently by giving us\nreason. She has bestowed this weapon upon us, which is strong,\nimperishable, and obedient to our will, not uncertain or capable\nof being turned against its master. Reason suffices by itself not\nmerely to take thought for the future, but to manage our affairs:[8]\nwhat, then, can be more foolish than for reason to beg anger for\nprotection, that is, for what is certain to beg of what is uncertain?\nwhat is trustworthy of what is faithless? what is whole of what is\nsick? What, indeed? since reason is far more powerful by itself\neven in performing those operations in which the help of anger seems\nespecially needful: for when reason has decided that a particular\nthing should be done, she perseveres in doing it; not being able\nto find anything better than herself to exchange with. She, therefore,\nabides by her purpose when it has once been formed; whereas anger\nis often overcome by pity: for it possesses no firm strength, but\nmerely swells like an empty bladder, and makes a violent beginning,\njust like the winds which rise from the earth and are caused by\nrivers and marshes, which blow furiously without any continuance:\nanger begins with a mighty rush, and then falls away, becoming\nfatigued too soon: that which but lately thought of nothing but\ncruelty and novel forms of torture, is become quite softened and\ngentle when the time comes for punishment to be inflicted. Passion\nsoon cools, whereas reason is always consistent: yet even in cases\nwhere anger has continued to burn, it often happens that although\nthere may be many who deserve to die, yet after the death of two\nor three it ceases to slay. Its first onset is fierce, just as the\nteeth of snakes when first roused from their lair are venomous, but\nbecome harmless after repeated bites have exhausted their poison.\nConsequently those who are {70} equally guilty are not equally\npunished, and often he who has done less is punished more, because\nhe fell in the way of anger when it was fresher. It is altogether\nirregular; at one time it runs into undue excess, at another it\nfalls short of its duty: for it indulges its own feelings and gives\nsentence according to its caprices, will not listen to evidence,\nallows the defence no opportunity of being heard, clings to what\nit has wrongly assumed, and will not suffer its opinion to be wrested\nfrom it, even when it is a mistaken one.\nXVIII. Reason gives each side time to plead; moreover, she herself\ndemands adjournment, that she may have sufficient scope for the\ndiscovery of the truth; whereas anger is in a hurry: reason wishes\nto give a just decision; anger wishes its decision to be thought\njust: reason looks no further than the matter in hand; anger is\nexcited by empty matters hovering on the outskirts of the case: it\nis irritated by anything approaching to a confident demeanour, a\nloud voice, an unrestrained speech, dainty apparel, high-flown\npleading, or popularity with the public. It often condemns a man\nbecause it dislikes his patron; it loves and maintains error even\nwhen truth is staring it in the face. It hates to be proved wrong,\nand thinks it more honourable to persevere in a mistaken line of\nconduct than to retract it. I remember Gnaeus Piso, a man who was\nfree from many vices, yet of a perverse disposition, and one who\nmistook harshness for consistency. In his anger he ordered a soldier\nto be led off to execution because he had returned from furlough\nwithout his comrade, as though he must have murdered him if he could\nnot show him. When the man asked for time for search, he would not\ngrant it: the condemned man was brought outside the rampart, and\nwas just offering his neck to the axe, when suddenly there appeared\nhis comrade who was thought to be slain. Hereupon the centurion in\ncharge of the execution bade the guardsman sheathe his sword, and\nled the condemned {71} man back to Piso, to restore to him the\ninnocence which Fortune had restored to the soldier. They were led\ninto his presence by their fellow soldiers amid the great joy of\nthe whole camp, embracing one another and accompanied by a vast\ncrowd. Piso mounted the tribunal in a fury and ordered them both\nto be executed, both him who had not murdered and him who had not\nbeen slain. What could be more unworthy than this? Because one was\nproved to be innocent, two perished. Piso even added a third: for\nhe actually ordered the centurion, who had brought back the condemned\nman, to be put to death. Three men were set up to die in the same\nplace because one was innocent. O, how clever is anger at inventing\nreasons for its frenzy! \u201cYou,\u201d it says, \u201cI order to be executed,\nbecause you have been condemned to death: you, because you have\nbeen the cause of your comrade\u2019s condemnation, and you, because\nwhen ordered to put him to death you disobeyed your general.\u201d He\ndiscovered the means of charging them with three crimes, because\nhe could find no crime in them.\nXIX. Irascibility, I say, has this fault\u2014it is loth to be ruled:\nit is angry with the truth itself, if it comes to light against its\nwill: it assails those whom it has marked for its victims with\nshouting and riotous noise and gesticulation of the entire body,\ntogether with reproaches and curses. Not thus does reason act: but\nif it must be so, she silently and quietly wipes out whole households,\ndestroys entire families of the enemies of the state, together with\ntheir wives and children, throws down their very dwellings, levels\nthem with the ground, and roots out the names of those who are the\nfoes of liberty. This she does without grinding her teeth or shaking\nher head, or doing anything unbecoming to a judge, whose countenance\nought to be especially calm and composed at the time when he is\npronouncing an important sentence. \u201cWhat need is there,\u201d asks\nHieronymus, \u201cfor you to bite your own lips when you want to strike\nsome one?\u201d What {72} would he have said, had he seen a proconsul\nleap down from the tribunal, snatch the fasces from the lictor, and\ntear his own clothes because those of others were not torn as fast\nas he wished. Why need you upset the table, throw down the drinking\ncups, knock yourself against the columns, tear your hair, smite\nyour thigh and your breast? How vehement do you suppose anger to\nbe, if it thus turns back upon itself, because it cannot find vent\non another as fast as it wishes? Such men, therefore, are held back\nby the bystanders and are begged to become reconciled with themselves.\nBut he who while free from anger assigns to each man the penalty\nwhich he deserves, does none of these things. He often lets a man\ngo after detecting his crime, if his penitence for what he has done\ngives good hope for the future, if he perceives that the man\u2019s\nwickedness is not deeply rooted in his mind, but is only, as the\nsaying is, skin-deep. He will grant impunity in cases where it will\nhurt neither the receiver nor the giver. In some cases he will\npunish great crimes more leniently than lesser ones, if the former\nwere the result of momentary impulse, not of cruelty, while the\nlatter were instinct with secret, underhand, long-practised craftiness.\nThe same fault, committed by two separate men, will not be visited\nby him with the same penalty, if the one was guilty of it through\ncarelessness, the other with a premeditated intention of doing\nmischief. In all dealing with crime he will remember that the one\nform of punishment is meant to make bad men better, and the other\nto put them out of the way. In either case he will look to the\nfuture, not to the past: for, as Plato says, \u201cno wise man punishes\nany one because he has sinned, but that he may sin no more: for\nwhat is past cannot be recalled, but what is to come may be checked.\u201d\nThose, too, whom he wishes to make examples of the ill success of\nwickedness, he executes publicly, not merely in order that they\nthemselves may die, but that by dying they {73} may deter others\nfrom doing likewise. You see how free from any mental disturbance\na man ought to be who has to weigh and consider all this, when he\ndeals with a matter which ought to be handled with the utmost care,\nI mean, the power of life and death. The sword of justice is\nill-placed in the hands of an angry man.\nXX. Neither ought it to be believed that anger contributes anything\nto magnanimity: what it gives is not magnanimity but vain glory.\nThe increase which disease produces in bodies swollen with morbid\nhumours is not healthy growth, but bloated corpulence. All those\nwhose madness raises them above human considerations, believe\nthemselves to be inspired with high and sublime ideas; but there\nis no solid ground beneath, and what is built without foundation\nis liable to collapse in ruin. Anger has no ground to stand upon,\nand does not rise from a firm and enduring foundation, but is a\nwindy, empty quality, as far removed from true magnanimity as\nfool-hardiness from courage, boastfulness from confidence, gloom\nfrom austerity, cruelty from strictness. There is, I say, a great\ndifference between a lofty and a proud mind: anger brings about\nnothing grand or beautiful. On the other hand, to be constantly\nirritated seems to me to be the part of a languid and unhappy mind,\nconscious of its own feebleness, like folk with diseased bodies\ncovered with sores, who cry out at the lightest touch. Anger,\ntherefore, is a vice which for the most part affects women and\nchildren. \u201cYet it affects men also.\u201d Because many men, too, have\nwomanish or childish intellects. \u201cBut what are we to say? do not\nsome words fall from angry men which appear to flow from a great\nmind?\u201d Yes, to those who know not what true greatness is: as, for\nexample, that foul and hateful saying, \u201cLet them hate me, provided\nthey fear me,\u201d which you may be sure was written in Sulla\u2019s time.\nI know not which was the worse of the two things he wished {74}\nfor, that he might be hated or that he might be feared. It occurs\nto his mind that some day people will curse him, plot against him,\ncrush him: what prayer does he add to this? May all the gods curse\nhim\u2014for discovering a cure for hate so worthy of it. \u201cLet them\nhate.\u201d How? \u201cProvided they obey me?\u201d No! \u201cProvided they approve of\nme?\u201d No! How then? \u201cProvided they fear me!\u201d I would not even be\nloved upon such terms. Do you imagine that this was a very spirited\nsaying? You are wrong: this is not greatness, but monstrosity. You\nshould not believe the words of angry men, whose speech is very\nloud and menacing, while their mind within them is as timid as\npossible: nor need you suppose that the most eloquent of men, Titus\nLivius, was right in describing somebody as being \u201cof a great rather\nthan a good disposition.\u201d The things cannot be separated: he must\neither be good or else he cannot be great, because I take greatness\nof mind to mean that it is unshaken, sound throughout, firm and\nuniform to its very foundation; such as cannot exist in evil\ndispositions. Such dispositions may be terrible, frantic, and\ndestructive, but cannot possess greatness; because greatness rests\nupon goodness, and owes its strength to it. \u201cYet by speech, action,\nand all outward show they will make one think them great.\u201d True,\nthey will say something which you may think shows a great spirit,\nlike Gaius Caesar, who when angry with heaven because it interfered\nwith his ballet-dancers, whom he imitated more carefully than he\nattended to them when they acted, and because it frightened his\nrevels by its thunders, surely ill-directed,[9] challenged Jove to\nfight, and that to the death, shouting the Homeric verse:\u2014\n\u201cCarry me off, or I will carry thee!\u201d\n{75} How great was his madness! He must have believed either that\nhe could not be hurt even by Jupiter himself, or that he could hurt\neven Jupiter itself. I imagine that this saying of his had no small\nweight in nerving the minds of the conspirators for their task: for\nit seemed to be the height of endurance to bear one who could not\nbear Jupiter.\nXXI. There is therefore nothing great or noble in anger, even when\nit seems to be powerful and to contemn both gods and men alike. Any\none who thinks that anger produces greatness of mind, would think\nthat luxury produces it: such a man wishes to rest on ivory, to be\nclothed with purple, and roofed with gold; to remove lands, embank\nseas, hasten the course of rivers, suspend woods in the air. He\nwould think that avarice shows greatness of mind: for the avaricious\nman broods over heaps of gold and silver, treats whole provinces\nas merely fields on his estate, and has larger tracts of country\nunder the charge of single bailiffs than those which consuls once\ndrew lots to administer. He would think that lust shows greatness\nof mind: for the lustful man swims across straits, castrates troops\nof boys, and puts himself within reach of the swords of injured\nhusbands with complete scorn of death. Ambition, too, he would think\nshows greatness of mind: for the ambitious man is not content with\noffice once a year, but, if possible, would fill the calendar of\ndignities with his name alone, and cover the whole world with his\ntitles. It matters nothing to what heights or lengths these passions\nmay proceed: they are narrow, pitiable, grovelling. Virtue alone\nis lofty and sublime, nor is anything great which is not at the\nsame time tranquil.\n[1] Here a leaf or more has been lost, including the fragment cited\nin Lactantius, _De ira dei_, 17 \u201cIra est eupiditas,\u201d &c. The entire\npassage is:\u2014\u201cBut the Stoics did not perceive that there is a\ndifference between right and wrong; that there is just and unjust\nanger: and as they could find no remedy for it, they wished to\nextirpate it. The Peripatetics, on the other hand, declared that\nit ought not to be destroyed, but restrained. These I have sufficiently\nanswered in the sixth book of my \u2018Institutiones.\u2019 It is clear that\nthe philosophers did not comprehend the reason of anger, from the\ndefinitions of it which Seneca has enumerated in the books \u2018On\nAnger\u2019 which he has written. \u2018Anger,\u2019 he says, \u2018is the desire of\navenging an injury.\u2019 Others, as Posidonius says, call it \u2018a desire\nto punish one by whom you think that you have been unjustly injured,\u2019\nSome have defined it thus, \u2018Anger is an impulse of the mind to\ninjure him who either has injured you or has sought to injure you.\u2019\nAristotle\u2019s definition differs but little from our own.

ANNAEUS SENECA, ADDRESSED\nTO NOVATUS.\nOF ANGER.\nBook II.\nMy first book, Novatus, had a more abundant subject: for carriages\nroll easily down hill:[1] now we must proceed to drier matters. The\nquestion before us is whether anger arises from deliberate choice\nor from impulse, that is, whether it acts of its own accord or like\nthe greater part of those passions which spring up within us without\nour knowledge. It is necessary for our debate to stoop to the\nconsideration of these matters, in order that it may afterwards be\nable to rise to loftier themes; for likewise in our bodies the parts\nwhich are first set in order are the bones, sinews, and joints,\nwhich are by no means fair to see, albeit they are the foundation\nof our frame and essential to its life: next to them come the parts\nof which all beauty of face and appearance consists; and after\nthese, colour, which above all else charms the eye, is applied last\nof all, when the rest of the body is complete. There is no doubt\nthat anger is roused by the appearance of an injury {77} being done:\nbut the question before us is, whether anger straightway follows\nthe appearance, and springs up without assistance from the mind,\nor whether it is roused with the sympathy of the mind. Our (the\nStoics\u2019) opinion is, that anger can venture upon nothing by itself,\nwithout the approval of mind: for to conceive the idea of a wrong\nhaving been done, to long to avenge it, and to join the two\npropositions, that we ought not to have been injured and that it\nis our duty to avenge our injuries, cannot belong to a mere impulse\nwhich is excited without our consent. That impulse is a simple act;\nthis is a complex one, and composed of several parts. The man\nunderstands something to have happened: he becomes indignant thereat:\nhe condemns the deed; and he avenges it. All these things cannot\nbe done without his mind agreeing to those matters which touched\nhim.\nII. Whither, say you, does this inquiry tend? That we may know what\nanger is: for if it springs up against our will, it never will yield\nto reason: because all the motions which take place without our\nvolition are beyond our control and unavoidable, such as shivering\nwhen cold water is poured over us, or shrinking when we are touched\nin certain places. Men\u2019s hair rises up at bad news, their faces\nblush at indecent words, and they are seized with dizziness when\nlooking down a precipice; and as it is not in our power to prevent\nany of these things, no reasoning can prevent their taking place.\nBut anger can be put to flight by wise maxims; for it is a voluntary\ndefect of the mind, and not one of those things which are evolved\nby the conditions of human life, and which, therefore, may happen\neven to the wisest of us. Among these and in the first place must\nbe ranked that thrill of the mind which seizes us at the thought\nof wrongdoing. We feel this even when witnessing the mimic scenes\nof the stage, or when reading about things that happened long ago.\nWe often {78} feel angry with Clodius for banishing Cicero, and\nwith Antonius for murdering him. Who is not indignant with the wars\nof Marius, the proscriptions of Sulla? who is not enraged against\nTheodotus and Achillas and the boy king who dared to commit a more\nthan boyish crime?[2] Sometimes songs excite us, and quickened\nrhythm and the martial noise of trumpets; so, too, shocking pictures\nand the dreadful sight of tortures, however well deserved, affect\nour minds. Hence it is that we smile when others are smiling, that\na crowd of mourners makes us sad, and that we take a glowing interest\nin another\u2019s battles; all of which feelings are not anger, any more\nthan that which clouds our brow at the sight of a stage shipwreck\nis sadness, or what we feel, when we read how Hannibal after Cannae\nbeset the walls of Rome, can be called fear. All these are emotions\nof minds which are loth to be moved, and are not passions, but\nrudiments which may grow into passions. So, too, a soldier starts\nat the sound of a trumpet, although he may be dressed as a civilian\nand in the midst of a profound peace, and camp horses prick up their\nears at the clash of arms. It is said that Alexander, when Xenophantus\nwas singing, laid his hand upon his weapons.\nIII. None of these things which casually influence the mind deserve\nto be called passions: the mind, if I may so express it, rather\nsuffers passions to act upon itself than forms them. A passion,\ntherefore, consists not in being affected by the sights which are\npresented to us, but in giving way to our feelings and following\nup these chance promptings: for whoever imagines that paleness,\nbursting into tears, lustful feelings, deep sighs, sudden flashes\nof the eyes, and so forth, are signs of passion and betray the {79}\nstate of the mind, is mistaken, and does not understand that these\nare merely impulses of the body. Consequently, the bravest of men\noften turns pale while he is putting on his armour; when the signal\nfor battle is given, the knees of the boldest soldier shake for a\nmoment; the heart even of a great general leaps into his mouth just\nbefore the lines clash together, and the hands and feet even of the\nmost eloquent orator grow stiff and cold while he is preparing to\nbegin his speech. Anger must not merely move, but break out of\nbounds, being an impulse: now, no impulse can take place without\nthe consent of the mind: for it cannot be that we should deal with\nrevenge and punishment without the mind being cognisant of them. A\nman may think himself injured, may wish to avenge his wrongs, and\nthen may be persuaded by some reason or other to give up his intention\nand calm down: I do not call that anger, it is an emotion of the\nmind which is under the control of reason. Anger is that which goes\nbeyond reason and carries her away with it: wherefore the first\nconfusion of a man\u2019s mind when struck by what seems an injury is\nno more anger than the apparent injury itself: it is the subsequent\nmad rush, which not only receives the impression of the apparent\ninjury, but acts upon it as true, that is anger, being an exciting\nof the mind to revenge, which proceeds from choice and deliberate\nresolve. There never has been any doubt that fear produces flight,\nand anger a rush forward; consider, therefore, whether you suppose\nthat anything can be either sought or avoided without the participation\nof the mind.\nIV. Furthermore, that you may know in what manner passions begin\nand swell and gain spirit, learn that the first emotion is involuntary,\nand is, as it were, a preparation for a passion, and a threatening\nof one. The next is combined with a wish, though not an obstinate\none, as, for example, \u201cIt is my duty to avenge myself, because I\nhave been injured,\u201d {80} or \u201cIt is right that this man should be\npunished, because he has committed a crime.\u201d The third emotion is\nalready beyond our control, because it overrides reason, and wishes\nto avenge itself, not if it be its duty, but whether or no. We are\nnot able by means of reason to escape from that first impression\non the mind, any more than we can escape from those things which\nwe have mentioned as occurring to the body: we cannot prevent other\npeople\u2019s yawns temping us to yawn:[3] we cannot help winking when\nfingers are suddenly darted at our eyes. Reason is unable to overcome\nthese habits, which perhaps might be weakened by practice and\nconstant watchfulness: they differ from an emotion which is brought\ninto existence and brought to an end by a deliberate mental act.\nV. We must also enquire whether those whose cruelty knows no bounds,\nand who delight in shedding human blood, are angry when they kill\npeople from whom they have received no injury, and who they themselves\ndo not think have done them any injury; such as were Apollodorus\nor Phalaris. This is not anger, it is ferocity: for it does not do\nhurt because it has received injury: but is even willing to receive\ninjury, provided it may do hurt. It does not long to inflict stripes\nand mangle bodies to avenge its wrongs, but for its own pleasure.\nWhat then are we to say? This evil takes its rise from anger; for\nanger, after it has by long use and indulgence made a man forget\nmercy, and driven all feelings of human fellowship from his mind,\npasses finally into cruelty. Such men therefore laugh, rejoice,\nenjoy themselves greatly, and are as unlike as possible in countenance\nto angry men, since cruelty is their relaxation. It is said that\nwhen Hannibal saw a trench full of human blood, he exclaimed, \u201cO,\nwhat {81} a beauteous sight!\u201d How much more beautiful would he have\nthought it, if it had filled a river or a lake? Why should we wonder\nthat you should be charmed with this sight above all others, you\nwho were born in bloodshed and brought up amid slaughter from a\nchild? Fortune will follow you and favour your cruelty for twenty\nyears, and will display to you everywhere the sight that you love.\nYou will behold it both at Trasumene and at Cannae, and lastly at\nyour own city of Carthage. Volesus, who not long ago, under the\nEmperor Augustus, was proconsul of Asia Minor, after he had one day\nbeheaded three hundred persons, strutted out among the corpses with\na haughty air, as though he had performed some grand and notable\nexploit, and exclaimed in Greek, \u201cWhat a kingly action!\u201d What would\nthis man have done, had he been really a king? This was not anger,\nbut a greater and an incurable disease.\nVI. \u201cVirtue,\u201d argues our adversary, \u201cought to be angry with what\nis base, just as she approves of what is honourable.\u201d What should\nwe think if he said that virtue ought to be both mean and great;\nyet this is what he means, when he wants her to be raised and\nlowered, because joy at a good action is grand and glorious, while\nanger at another\u2019s sin is base and befits a narrow mind: and virtue\nwill never be guilty of imitating vice while she is repressing it;\nshe considers anger to deserve punishment for itself, since it often\nis even more criminal than the faults which which it is angry. To\nrejoice and be glad is the proper and natural function of virtue:\nit is as much beneath her dignity to be angry, as to mourn: now,\nsorrow is the companion of anger, and all anger ends in sorrow,\neither from remorse or from failure. Secondly, if it be the part\nof the wise man to be angry with sins, he will be more angry the\ngreater they are, and will often be angry: from which it follows\nthat the wise man will not only be angry but irascible. {82} Yet\nif we do not believe that great and frequent anger can find any\nplace in the wise man\u2019s mind, why should we not set him altogether\nfree from this passion? for there can be no limit, if he ought to\nbe angry in proportion to what every man does: because he will\neither be unjust if he is equally angry at unequal crimes, or he\nwill be the most irascible of men, if he blazes into wrath as often\nas crimes deserve his anger.\nVII. What, too, can be more unworthy of the wise man, than that his\npassions should depend upon the wickedness of others? If so, the\ngreat Socrates will no longer be able to return home with the same\nexpression of countenance with which he set out. Moreover, if it\nbe the duty of the wise man to be angry at base deeds, and to be\nexcited and saddened at crimes, then is there nothing more unhappy\nthan the wise man, for all his life will be spent in anger and\ngrief. What moment will there be at which he will not see something\ndeserving of blame? whenever he leaves his house, he will be obliged\nto walk among men who are criminals, misers, spendthrifts, profligates,\nand who are happy in being so: he can turn his eyes in no direction\nwithout their finding something to shock them. He will faint, if\nhe demands anger from himself as often as reason calls for it. All\nthese thousands who are hurrying to the law courts at break of day,\nhow base are their causes, and how much baser their advocates? One\nimpugns his father\u2019s will, when he would have done better to deserve\nit; another appears as the accuser of his mother; a third comes to\ninform against a man for committing the very crime of which he\nhimself is yet more notoriously guilty. The judge, too, is chosen\nto condemn men for doing what he himself has done, and the audience\ntakes the wrong side, led astray by the fine voice of the pleader.\nVIII. Why need I dwell upon individual cases? Be assured, when you\nsee the Forum crowded with a multitude, {83} the Saepta[4] swarming\nwith people, or the great Circus, in which the greater part of the\npeople find room to show themselves at once, that among them there\nare as many vices as there are men. Among those whom you see in the\ngarb of peace there is no peace: for a small profit any one of them\nwill attempt the ruin of another: no one can gain anything save by\nanother\u2019s loss. They hate the fortunate and despise the unfortunate:\nthey grudgingly endure the great, and oppress the small: they are\nfired by divers lusts: they would wreck everything for the sake of\na little pleasure or plunder: they live as though they were in a\nschool of gladiators, fighting with the same people with whom they\nlive: it is like a society of wild beasts, save that beasts are\ntame with one another, and refrain from biting their own species,\nwhereas men tear one another, and gorge themselves upon one another.\nThey differ from dumb animals in this alone, that the latter are\ntame with those who feed them, whereas the rage of the former preys\non those very persons by whom they were brought up.\nIX. The wise man will never cease to be angry, if he once begins,\nso full is every place of vices and crimes. More evil is done than\ncan be healed by punishment: men seem engaged in a vast race of\nwickedness. Every day there is greater eagerness to sin, less\nmodesty. Throwing aside all reverence for what is better and more\njust, lust rushes whithersoever it thinks fit, and crimes are no\nlonger committed by stealth, they take place before our eyes, and\nwickedness has become so general and gained such a footing in\neveryone\u2019s breast that innocence is no longer rare, but no longer\nexists. Do men break the law singly, or a few at a time? Nay, they\nrise in all quarters at once, as though obeying some universal\nsignal, to wipe out the boundaries of right and wrong.\n{84}\n\u201cHost is not safe from guest, Father-in-law from son; but seldom\nlove Exists \u2019twixt brothers; wives long to destroy Their husbands,\nhusbands long to slay their wives, Stepmothers deadly aconite\nprepare And child-heirs wonder when their sires will die.\u201d\nAnd how small a part of men\u2019s crimes are these! The poet[5] has not\ndescribed one people divided into two hostile camps, parents and\nchildren enrolled on opposite sides, Rome set on fire by the hand\nof a Roman, troops of fierce horsemen scouring the country to track\nout the hiding-places of the proscribed, wells defiled with poison,\nplagues created by human hands, trenches dug by children round their\nbeleaguered parents, crowded prisons, conflagrations that consume\nwhole cities, gloomy tyrannies, secret plots to establish despotisms\nand ruin peoples, and men glorying in those deeds which, as long\nas it was possible to repress them, were counted as crimes\u2014I mean\nrape, debauchery, and lust . . . . . Add to these, public acts of\nnational bad faith, broken treaties, everything that cannot defend\nitself carried off as plunder by the stronger, knaveries, thefts,\nfrauds, and disownings of debt such as three of our present law-courts\nwould not suffice to deal with. If you want the wise man to be as\nangry as the atrocity of men\u2019s crimes requires, he must not merely\nbe angry, but must go mad with rage.\nX. You will rather think that we should not be angry with people\u2019s\nfaults; for what shall we say of one who is angry with those who\nstumble in the dark, or with deaf people who cannot hear his orders,\nor with children, because they forget their duty and interest\nthemselves in the games and silly jokes of their companions? What\nshall we say if you choose to be angry {85} with weaklings for being\nsick, for growing old, or becoming fatigued? Among the other\nmisfortunes of humanity is this, that men\u2019s intellects are confused,\nand they not only cannot help going wrong, but love to go wrong.\nTo avoid being angry with individuals, you must pardon the whole\nmass, you must grant forgiveness to the entire human race. If you\nare angry with young and old men because they do wrong, you will\nbe angry with infants also, for they soon will do wrong. Does any\none become angry with children, who are too young to comprehend\ndistinctions? Yet, to be a human being is a greater and a better\nexcuse than to be a child. Thus are we born, as creatures liable\nto as many disorders of the mind as of the body; not dull and\nslow-witted, but making a bad use of our keenness of wit, and leading\none another into vice by our example. He who follows others who\nhave started before him on the wrong road is surely excusable for\nhaving wandered on[6] the highway. A general\u2019s severity may be shown\nin the case of individual deserters; but where a whole army deserts,\nit must needs be pardoned. What is it that puts a stop to the wise\nman\u2019s anger? It is the number of sinners. He perceives how unjust\nand how dangerous it is to be angry with vices which all men share.\nHeraclitcus, whenever he came out of doors and beheld around him\nsuch a number of men who were living wretchedly, nay, rather perishing\nwretchedly, used to weep: he pitied all those who met him joyous\nand happy. He was of a gentle but too weak disposition: and he\nhimself was one of those for whom he ought to have wept. Democritus,\non the other hand, is said never to have appeared in public without\nlaughing; so little did men\u2019s serious occupations appear serious\nto him. What room is there for anger? Everything ought either to\nmove us to tears or to laughter. The wise man will not be angry\nwith {86} sinners. Why not? Because he knows that no one is born\nwise, but becomes so: he knows that very few wise men are produced\nin any age, because he thoroughly understands the circumstances of\nhuman life. Now, no sane man is angry with nature: for what should\nwe say if a man chose to be surprised that fruit did not hang on\nthe thickets of a forest, or to wonder at bushes and thorns not\nbeing covered with some useful berry? No one is angry when nature\nexcuses a defect. The wise man, therefore, being tranquil, and\ndealing candidly with mistakes, not an enemy to but an improver of\nsinners, will go abroad every day in the following frame of mind:\u2014\u201dMany\nmen will meet me who are drunkards, lustful, ungrateful, greedy,\nand excited by the frenzy of ambition.\u201d He will view all these as\nbenignly as a physician does his patients. When a man\u2019s ship leaks\nfreely through its opened seams, does he become angry with the\nsailors or the ship itself? No; instead of that, he tries to remedy\nit: he shuts out some water, bales out some other, closes all the\nholes that he can see, and by ceaseless labour counteracts those\nwhich are out of sight and which let water into the hold; nor does\nhe relax his efforts because as much water as he pumps out runs in\nagain. We need a long-breathed struggle against permanent and\nprolific evils; not, indeed, to quell them, but merely to prevent\ntheir overpowering us.\nXI. \u201cAnger,\u201d says our opponent, \u201cis useful, because it avoids\ncontempt, and because it frightens bad men.\u201d Now, in the first\nplace, if anger is strong in proportion to its threats, it is hateful\nfor the same reason that it is terrible: and it is more dangerous\nto be hated than to be despised. If, again, it is without strength,\nit is much more exposed to contempt, and cannot avoid ridicule; for\nwhat is more flat than anger when it breaks out into meaningless\nravings? Moreover, because some things are somewhat terrible, they\nare not on that account desirable: nor does wisdom wish it {87} to\nbe said of the wise man, as it is of a wild beast, that the fear\nwhich he inspires is as a weapon to him. Why, do we not fear fever,\ngout, consuming ulcers? and is there, for that reason, any good in\nthem? nay; on the other hand, they are all despised and thought to\nbe foul and base, and are for this very reason feared. So, too,\nanger is in itself hideous and by no means to be feared; yet it is\nfeared by many, just as a hideous mask is feared by children. How\ncan we answer the fact that terror always works back to him who\ninspired it, and that no one is feared who is himself at peace? At\nthis point it is well that you should remember that verse of Laberius,\nwhich, when pronounced in the theatre during the height of the civil\nwar, caught the fancy of the whole people as though it expressed\nthe national feeling:\u2014\n\u201cHe must fear many, whom so many fear.\u201d\nThus has nature ordained, that whatever becomes great by causing\nfear to others is not free from fear itself. How disturbed lions\nare at the faintest noises! How excited those fiercest of beasts\nbecome at strange shadows, voices, or smells! Whatever is a terror\nto others, fears for itself. There can be no reason, therefore, for\nany wise man to wish to be feared, and no one need think that anger\nis anything great because it strikes terror, since even the most\ndespicable things are feared, as, for example, noxious vermin whose\nbite is venomous: and since a string set with feathers stops the\nlargest herds of wild beasts and guides them into traps, it is no\nwonder that from its effect it should be named a \u201cScarer.\u201d[7] Foolish\ncreatures are frightened by foolish things: the movement of chariots\nand the sight of their wheels turning round drives lions back into\ntheir cage: elephants are frightened at the cries of pigs: and so\nalso we fear anger just as children fear the dark, or wild {88}\nbeasts fear red feathers: it has in itself nothing solid or valiant,\nbut it affects feeble minds.\nXII. \u201cWickedness,\u201d says our adversary, \u201cmust be removed from the\nsystem of nature, if you wish to remove anger: neither of which\nthings can be done.\u201d In the first place, it is possible for a man\nnot to be cold, although according to the system of nature it may\nbe winter-time, nor yet to suffer from heat, although it be summer\naccording to the almanac. He may be protected against the inclement\ntime of the year by dwelling in a favoured spot, or he may have so\ntrained his body to endurance that it feels neither heat nor cold.\nNext, reverse this saying:\u2014You must remove anger from your mind\nbefore you can take virtue into the same, because vices and virtues\ncannot combine, and none can at the same time be both an angry man\nand a good man, any more than he can be both sick and well. \u201cIt is\nnot possible,\u201d says he, \u201cto remove anger altogether from the mind,\nnor does human nature admit of it.\u201d Yet there is nothing so hard\nand difficult that the mind of man cannot overcome it, and with\nwhich unremitting study will not render him familiar, nor are there\nany passions so fierce and independent that they cannot be tamed\nby discipline. The mind can carry out whatever orders it gives\nitself: some have succeeded in never smiling: some have forbidden\nthemselves wine, sexual intercourse, or even drink of all kinds.\nSome, who are satisfied with short hours of rest, have learned to\nwatch for long periods without weariness. Men have learned to run\nupon the thinnest ropes even when slanting, to carry huge burdens,\nscarcely within the compass of human strength, or to dive to enormous\ndepths and suffer themselves to remain under the sea without any\nchance of drawing breath. There are a thousand other instances in\nwhich application has conquered all obstacles, and proved that\nnothing which the mind has set itself to endure is difficult. The\nmen whom I {89} have just mentioned gain either no reward or one\nthat is unworthy of their unwearied application; for what great\nthing does a man gain by applying his intellect to walking upon a\ntight rope? or to placing great burdens upon his shoulders? or to\nkeeping sleep from his eyes? or to reaching the bottom of the sea?\nand yet their patient labour brings all these things to pass for a\ntrifling reward. Shall not we then call in the aid of patience, we\nwhom such a prize awaits, the unbroken calm of a happy life? How\ngreat a blessing is it to escape from anger, that chief of all\nevils, and therewith from frenzy, ferocity, cruelty, and madness,\nits attendants?\nXIII. There is no reason why we should seek to defend such a passion\nas this or excuse its excesses by declaring it to be either useful\nor unavoidable. What vice, indeed, is without its defenders? yet\nthis is no reason why you should declare anger to be ineradicable.\nThe evils from which we suffer are curable, and since we were born\nwith a natural bias towards good, nature herself will help us if\nwe try to amend our lives. Nor is the path to virtue steep and\nrough, as some think it to be: it may be reached on level ground.\nThis is no untrue tale which I come to tell you: the road to happiness\nis easy; do you only enter upon it with good luck and the good help\nof the gods themselves. It is much harder to do what you are doing.\nWhat is more restful than a mind at peace, and what more toilsome\nthan anger? What is more at leisure than clemency, what fuller of\nbusiness than cruelty? Modesty keeps holiday while vice is overwhelmed\nwith work. In fine, the culture of any of the virtues is easy, while\nvices require a great expense. Anger ought to be removed from our\nminds: even those who say that it ought to be kept low admit this\nto some extent: let it be got rid of altogether; there is nothing\nto be gained by it. Without it we can more easily and more justly\nput an end {90} to crime, punish bad men, and amend their lives.\nThe wise man will do his duty in all things without the help of any\nevil passion, and will use no auxiliaries which require watching\nnarrowly lest they get beyond his control.\nXIV. Anger, then, must never become a habit with us, but we may\nsometimes affect to be angry when we wish to rouse up the dull minds\nof those whom we address, just as we rouse up horses who are slow\nat starting with goads and firebrands. We must sometimes apply fear\nto persons upon whom reason makes no impression: yet to be angry\nis of no more use than to grieve or to be afraid. \u201cWhat? do not\ncircumstances arise which provoke us to anger?\u201d Yes: but at those\ntimes above all others we ought to choke down our wrath. Nor is it\ndifficult to conquer our spirit, seeing that athletes, who devote\ntheir whole attention to the basest parts of themselves, nevertheless\nare able to endure blows and pain, in order to exhaust the strength\nof the striker, and do not strike when anger bids them, but when\nopportunity invites them. It is said that Pyrrhus, the most celebrated\ntrainer for gymnastic contests, used habitually to impress upon his\npupils not to lose their tempers: for anger spoils their science,\nand thinks only how it can hurt: so that often reason counsels\npatience while anger counsels revenge, and we, who might have\nsurvived our first misfortunes, are exposed to worse ones. Some\nhave been driven into exile by their impatience of a single\ncontemptuous word, have been plunged into the deepest miseries\nbecause they would not endure the most trifling wrong in silence,\nand have brought upon themselves the yoke of slavery because they\nwere too proud to give up the least part of their entire liberty.\nXV. \u201cThat you may be sure,\u201d says our opponent, \u201cthat anger has in\nit something noble, pray look at the free nations, such as the\nGermans and Scythians, who are especially prone to anger.\u201d The\nreason of this is that stout {91} and daring intellects are liable\nto anger before they are tamed by discipline; for some passions\nengraft themselves upon the better class of dispositions only, just\nas good land, even when waste, grows strong brushwood, and the trees\nare tall which stand upon a fertile soil. In like manner, dispositions\nwhich are naturally bold produce irritability, and, being hot and\nfiery, have no mean or trivial qualities, but their energy is\nmisdirected, as happens with all those who without training come\nto the front by their natural advantages alone, whose minds, unless\nthey be brought under control, degenerate from a courageous temper\ninto habits of rashness and reckless daring. \u201cWhat? are not milder\nspirits linked with gentler vices, such as tenderness of heart,\nlove, and bashfulness?\u201d Yes, and therefore I can often point out\nto you a good disposition by its own faults: yet their being the\nproofs of a superior nature does not prevent their being vices.\nMoreover, all those nations which are free because they are wild,\nlike lions or wolves, cannot command any more than they can obey:\nfor the strength of their intellect is not civilized, but fierce\nand unmanageable: now, no one is able to rule unless he is also\nable to be ruled. Consequently, the empire of the world has almost\nalways remained in the hands of those nations who enjoy a milder\nclimate. Those who dwell near the frozen north have uncivilized\ntempers\u2014\n\u201cJust on the model of their native skies,\u201d\nas the poet has it.\nXVI. Those animals, urges our opponent, are held to be the most\ngenerous who have large capacity for anger. He is mistaken when he\nholds up creatures who act from impulse instead of reason as patterns\nfor men to follow, because in man reason takes the place of impulse.\nYet even with animals, all do not alike profit by the same thing.\nAnger is of use to lions, timidity to stags, boldness {92} to hawks,\nflight to doves. What if I declare that it is not even true that\nthe best animals are the most prone to anger? I may suppose that\nwild beasts, who gain their food by rapine, are better the angrier\nthey are; but I should praise oxen and horses who obey the rein for\ntheir patience. What reason, however, have you for referring mankind\nto such wretched models, when you have the universe and God, whom\nhe alone of animals imitates because he alone comprehends Him? \u201cThe\nmost irritable men,\u201d says he, \u201care thought to be the most straightforward\nof all.\u201d Yes, because they are compared with swindlers and sharpers,\nand appear to be simple because they are outspoken. I should not\ncall such men simple, but heedless. We give this title of \u201csimple\u201d\nto all fools, gluttons, spendthrifts, and men whose vices lie on\nthe surface.\nXVII. \u201cAn orator,\u201d says our opponent, \u201csometimes speaks better,\nwhen he is angry.\u201d Not so, but when he pretends to be angry: for\nso also actors bring down the house by their playing, not when they\nare really angry, but when they act the angry man well: and in like\nmanner, in addressing a jury or a popular assembly, or in any other\nposition in which the minds of others have to be influenced at our\npleasure, we must ourselves pretend to feel anger, fear, or pity\nbefore we can make others feel them, and often the pretence of\npassion will do what the passion itself could not have done. \u201cThe\nmind which does not feel anger,\u201d says he, \u201cis feeble.\u201d True, if it\nhas nothing stronger than anger to support it. A man ought to be\nneither robber nor victim, neither tender-hearted nor cruel. The\nformer belongs to an over-weak mind, the latter to an over-hard\none. Let the wise man be moderate, and when things have to be done\nsomewhat briskly, let him call force, not anger, to his aid.\nXVIII. Now that we have discussed the questions propounded concerning\nanger, let us pass on to the consideration {93} of its remedies.\nThese, I imagine, are two-fold: the one class preventing our becoming\nangry, the other preventing our doing wrong when we are angry. As\nwith the body we adopt a certain regimen to keep ourselves in health,\nand use different rules to bring back health when lost, so likewise\nwe must repel anger in one fashion and quench it in another. That\nwe may avoid it, certain general rules of conduct which apply to\nall men\u2019s lives must be impressed upon us. We may divide these into\nsuch as are of use during the education of the young and in after-life.\nEducation ought to be carried on with the greatest and most salutary\nassiduity: for it is easy to mould minds while they are still tender,\nbut it is difficult to uproot vices which have grown up with\nourselves.\nXIX. A hot mind is naturally the most prone to anger: for as there\nare four elements,[8] consisting of fire, air, earth, and water,\nso there are powers corresponding and equivalent to each of these,\nnamely, hot, cold, dry, and moist. Now the mixture of the elements\nis the cause of the diversities of lands and of animals, of bodies\nand of character, and our dispositions incline to one or the other\nof these according as the strength of each element prevails in us.\nHence it is that we call some regions wet or dry, warm or cold. The\nsame distinctions apply likewise to animals and mankind; it makes\na great difference how much moisture or heat a man contains; his\ncharacter will partake of whichever element has the largest share\nin him. A warm temper of mind will make men prone to anger; for\nfire is full of movement and vigour; a mixture of {94} coldness\nmakes men cowards, for cold is sluggish and contracted. Because of\nthis, some of our Stoics think that anger is excited in our breasts\nby the boiling of the blood round the heart: indeed, that place is\nassigned to anger for no other reason than because the breast is\nthe warmest part of the whole body. Those who have more moisture\nin them become angry by slow degrees, because they have no heat\nready at hand, but it has to be obtained by movement; wherefore the\nanger of women and children is sharp rather than strong, and arises\non lighter provocation. At dry times of life anger is violent and\npowerful, yet without increase, and adding little to itself, because\nas heat dies away cold takes its place. Old men are testy and full\nof complaints, as also are sick people and convalescents, and all\nwhose store of heat has been consumed by weariness or loss of blood.\nThose who are wasted by thirst or hunger are in the same condition,\nas also are those whose frame is naturally bloodless and faints\nfrom want of generous diet. Wine kindles anger, because it increases\nheat; according to each man\u2019s disposition, some fly into a passion\nwhen they are heavily drunk, some when they are slightly drunk: nor\nis there any other reason than this why yellow-haired, ruddy-complexioned\npeople should be excessively passionate, seeing that they are\nnaturally of the colour which others put on during anger; for their\nblood is hot and easily set in motion.\nXX. But just as nature makes some men prone to anger, so there are\nmany other causes which have the same power as nature. Some are\nbrought into this condition by disease or bodily injury, others by\nhard work, long watching, nights of anxiety, ardent longings, and\nlove: and everything else which is hurtful to the body or the spirit\ninclines the distempered mind to find fault. All these, however,\nare but the beginning and causes of anger. Habit of mind has very\ngreat power, and, if it be harsh, increases the {95} disorder. As\nfor nature, it is difficult to alter it, nor may we change the\nmixture of the elements which was formed once for all at our birth:\nyet knowledge will be so far of service, that we should keep wine\nout of the reach of hot-tempered men, which Plato thinks ought also\nto be forbidden to boys, so that fire be not made fiercer. Neither\nshould such men be over-fed: for if so, their bodies will swell,\nand their minds will swell with them. Such men ought to take exercise,\nstopping short, however, of fatigue, in order that their natural\nheat may be abated, but not exhausted, and their excess of fiery\nspirit may be worked off. Games also will be useful: for moderate\npleasure relieves the mind and brings it to a proper balance. With\nthose temperaments which incline to moisture, or dryness and\nstiffness, there is no danger of anger, but there is fear of greater\nvices, such as cowardice, moroseness, despair, and suspiciousness:\nsuch dispositions therefore ought to be softened, comforted, and\nrestored to cheerfulness: and since we must make use of different\nremedies for anger and for sullenness, and these two vices require\nnot only unlike, but absolutely opposite modes of treatment, let\nus always attack that one of them which is gaining the mastery.\nXXI. It is, I assure you, of the greatest service to boys that they\nshould be soundly brought up, yet to regulate their education is\ndifficult, because it is our duty to be careful neither to cherish\na habit of anger in them, nor to blunt the edge of their spirit.\nThis needs careful watching, for both qualities, both those which\nare to be encouraged, and those which are to be checked, are fed\nby the same things; and even a careful watcher may be deceived by\ntheir likeness. A boy\u2019s spirit is increased by freedom and depressed\nby slavery: it rises when praised, and is led to conceive great\nexpectations of itself: yet this same treatment produces arrogance\nand quickness of temper: we must {96} therefore guide him between\nthese two extremes, using the curb at one time and the spur at\nanother. He must undergo no servile or degrading treatment; he never\nmust beg abjectly for anything, nor must he gain anything by begging;\nlet him rather receive it for his own sake, for his past good\nbehaviour, or for his promises of future good conduct. In contests\nwith his comrades we ought not to allow him to become sulky or fly\ninto a passion: let us see that he be on friendly terms with those\nwhom he contends with, so that in the struggle itself he may learn\nto wish not to hurt his antagonist but to conquer him: whenever he\nhas gained the day or done something praiseworthy, we should allow\nhim to enjoy his victory, but not to rush into transports of delight:\nfor joy leads to exultation, and exultation leads to swaggering and\nexcessive self-esteem, We ought to allow him some relaxation, yet\nnot yield him up to laziness and sloth, and we ought to keep him\nfar beyond the reach of luxury, for nothing makes children more\nprone to anger than a soft and fond bringing-up, so that the more\nonly children are indulged, and the more liberty is given to orphans,\nthe more they are corrupted. He to whom nothing is ever denied,\nwill not be able to endure a rebuff, whose anxious mother always\nwipes away his tears, whose _paedagogus_[9] is made to pay for his\nshortcomings. Do you not observe how a man\u2019s anger becomes more\nviolent as he rises in station? This shows itself especially in\nthose who are rich and noble, or in great place, when the favouring\ngale has roused all the most empty and trivial passions of their\nminds. Prosperity fosters anger, when a man\u2019s proud ears are\nsurrounded by a mob of flatterers, saying, \u201cThat man answer you!\nyou do not act according to your dignity, you lower yourself.\u201d And\nso forth, with all the language which can hardly be resisted even\nby healthy and originally well-principled {97} minds. Flattery,\nthen, must be kept well out of the way of children. Let a child\nhear the truth, and sometimes fear it: let him always reverence it.\nLet him rise in the presence of his elders. Let him obtain nothing\nby flying into a passion: let him be given when he is quiet what\nwas refused him when he cried for it: let him behold, but not make\nuse of his father\u2019s wealth: let him be reproved for what he does\nwrong. It will be advantageous to furnish boys with even-tempered\nteachers and _paedagogi_: what is soft and unformed clings to what\nis near, and takes its shape: the habits of young men reproduce\nthose of their nurses and _paedagogi_. Once, a boy who was brought\nup in Plato\u2019s house went home to his parents, and, on seeing his\nfather shouting with passion, said, \u201cI never saw any one at Plato\u2019s\nhouse act like that.\u201d I doubt not that he learned to imitate his\nfather sooner than he learned to imitate Plato. Above all, let his\nfood be scanty, his dress not costly, and of the same fashion as\nthat of his comrades: if you begin by putting him on a level with\nmany others, he will not be angry when some one is compared with\nhim.\nXXII. These precepts, however, apply to our children: in ourselves\nthe accident of birth and our education no longer admits of either\nmistakes or advice; we must deal with what follows. Now we ought\nto fight against the first causes of evil: the cause of anger is\nthe belief that we are injured; this belief, therefore, should not\nbe lightly entertained. We ought not to fly into a rage even when\nthe injury appears to be open and distinct: for some false things\nbear the semblance of truth. We should always allow some time to\nelapse, for time discloses the truth. Let not our ears be easily\nlent to calumnious talk: let us know and be on our guard against\nthis fault of human nature, that we are willing to believe what we\nare unwilling to listen to, and that we become angry before we have\nformed our opinion. What shall I say? we are influenced {98} not\nmerely by calumnies but by suspicions, and at the very look and\nsmile of others we may fly into a rage with innocent persons because\nwe put the worst construction upon it. We ought, therefore, to plead\nthe cause of the absent against ourselves, and to keep our anger\nin abeyance: for a punishment which has been postponed may yet be\ninflicted, but when once inflicted cannot be recalled.\nXXIII. Every one knows the story of the tyrannicide who, being\ncaught before he had accomplished his task, and being tortured by\nHippias to make him betray his accomplices, named the friends of\nthe tyrant who stood around, and every one to whom he knew the\ntyrant\u2019s safety was especially dear. As the tyrant ordered each man\nto be slain as he was named, at last the man, being asked if any\none else remained, said, \u201cYou remain alone, for I have left no one\nelse alive to whom you are dear.\u201d Anger had made the tyrant lend\nhis assistance to the tyrant-slayer, and cut down his guards with\nhis own sword. How far more spirited was Alexander, who after reading\nhis mother\u2019s letter warning him to beware of poison from his physician\nPhilip, nevertheless drank undismayed the medicine which Philip\ngave him! He felt more confidence in his friend: he deserved that\nhis friend should be innocent, and deserved that his conduct should\nmake him innocent. I praise Alexander\u2019s doing this all the more\nbecause he was above all men prone to anger; but the rarer moderation\nis among kings, the more it deserves to be praised. The great Gaius\nCaesar, who proved such a merciful conqueror in the civil war, did\nthe same thing; he burned a packet of letters addressed to Gnaeus\nPompeius by persons who had been thought to be either neutrals or\non the other side. Though he was never violent in his anger, yet\nhe preferred to put it out of his power to be angry: he thought\nthat the kindest way to pardon each of them was not to know what\nhis offence had been.\n{99}\nXXIV. Readiness to believe what we hear causes very great mischief;\nwe ought often not even to listen, because in some cases it is\nbetter to be deceived than to suspect deceit. We ought to free our\nminds of suspicion and mistrust, those most untrustworthy causes\nof anger. \u201cThis man\u2019s greeting was far from civil; that one would\nnot receive my kiss; one cut short a story I had begun to tell;\nanother did not ask me to dinner; another seemed to view me with\naversion.\u201d Suspicion will never lack grounds: what we want is\nstraightforwardness, and a kindly interpretation of things. Let us\nbelieve nothing unless it forces itself upon our sight and is\nunmistakable, and let us reprove ourselves for being too ready to\nbelieve, as often as our suspicions prove to be groundless: for\nthis discipline will render us habitually slow to believe what we\nhear.\nXXV. Another consequence of this will be, that we shall not be\nexasperated by the slightest and most contemptible trifles. It is\nmere madness to be put out of temper because a slave is not quick,\nbecause the water we are going to drink is lukewarm, or because our\ncouch is disarranged or our table carelessly laid. A man must be\nin a miserably bad state of health if he shrinks from a gentle\nbreath of wind; his eyes must be diseased if they are distressed\nby the sight of white clothing; he must be broken down with debauchery\nif he feels pain at seeing another man work. It is said that there\nwas one Mindyrides, a citizen of Sybaris, who one day seeing a man\ndigging and vigorously brandishing a mattock, complained that the\nsight made him weary, and forbade the man to work where he could\nsee him. The same man complained that he had suffered from the\nrose-leaves upon which he lay being folded double. When pleasures\nhave corrupted both the body and the mind, nothing seems endurable,\nnot indeed because it is hard, but because he who has to bear it\n{100} is soft: for why should we be driven to frenzy by any one\u2019s\ncoughing and sneezing, or by a fly not being driven away with\nsufficient care, or by a dog\u2019s hanging about us, or a key dropping\nfrom a careless servant\u2019s hand? Will one whose ears are agonised\nby the noise of a bench being dragged along the floor be able to\nendure with unruffled mind the rude language of party strife, and\nthe abuse which speakers in the forum or the senate house heap upon\ntheir opponents? Will he who is angry with his slave for icing his\ndrink badly, be able to endure hunger, or the thirst of a long march\nin summer? Nothing, therefore, nourishes anger more than excessive\nand dissatisfied luxury: the mind ought to be hardened by rough\ntreatment, so as not to feel any blow that is not severe.\nXXVI. We are angry, either with those who can, or with those who\ncannot do us an injury. To the latter class belong some inanimate\nthings, such as a book, which we often throw away when it is written\nin letters too small for us to read, or tear up when it is full of\nmistakes, or clothes which we destroy because we do not like them.\nHow foolish to be angry with such things as these, which neither\ndeserve nor feel our anger! \u201cBut of course it is their makers who\nreally affront us.\u201d I answer that, in the first place, we often\nbecome angry before making this distinction clear in our minds, and\nsecondly, perhaps even the makers might put forward some reasonable\nexcuses: one of them, it may be, could not make them any better\nthan he did, and it is not through any disrespect to you that he\nwas unskilled in his trade: another may have done his work so without\nany intention of insulting you: and, finally, what can be more crazy\nthan to discharge upon things the ill-feeling which one has accumulated\nagainst persons? Yet as it is the act of a madman to be angry with\ninanimate objects, so also is it to be angry with dumb animals,\nwhich can do us no wrong because they are not able to form a {101}\npurpose; and we cannot call anything a wrong unless it be done\nintentionally. They are, therefore, able to hurt us, just as a sword\nor a stone may do so, but they are not able to do us a wrong. Yet\nsome men think themselves insulted when the same horses which are\ndocile with one rider are restive with another, as though it were\nthrough their deliberate choice, and not through habit and cleverness\nof handling that some horses are more easily managed by some men\nthan by others. And as it is foolish to be angry with them, so it\nis to be angry with children, and with men who have little more\nsense than children: for all these sins, before a just judge,\nignorance would be as effective an excuse as innocence.\nXXVII. There are some things which are unable to hurt us, and whose\npower is exclusively beneficial and salutary, as, for example, the\nimmortal gods, who neither wish nor are able to do harm: for their\ntemperament is naturally gentle and tranquil, and no more likely\nto wrong others than to wrong themselves. Foolish people who know\nnot the truth hold them answerable for storms at sea, excessive\nrain, and long winters, whereas all the while these phenomena by\nwhich we suffer or profit take place without any reference whatever\nto us: it is not for our sake that the universe causes summer and\nwinter to succeed one another; these have a law of their own,\naccording to which their divine functions are performed. We think\ntoo much of ourselves, when we imagine that we are worthy to have\nsuch prodigious revolutions effected for our sake: so, then, none\nof these things take place in order to do us an injury, nay, on the\ncontrary, they all tend to our benefit. I have said that there are\nsome things which cannot hurt us, and some which would not. To the\nlatter class belong good men in authority, good parents, teachers,\nand judges whose punishments ought to be submitted to by us in the\nsame spirit in which we {102} undergo the surgeon\u2019s knife, abstinence\nfrom food, and such like things which hurt us for our benefit.\nSuppose that we are being punished; let us think not only of what\nwe suffer, but of what we have done: let us sit in judgement on our\npast life. Provided we are willing to tell ourselves the truth, we\nshall certainly decide that our crimes deserve a harder measure\nthan they have received.\nXXVIII. If we desire to be impartial judges of all that takes place,\nwe must first convince ourselves of this, that no one of us is\nfaultless: for it is from this that most of our indignation proceeds.\n\u201cI have not sinned, I have done no wrong.\u201d Say, rather, you do not\nadmit that you have done any wrong. We are infuriated at being\nreproved, either by reprimand or actual chastisement, although we\nare sinning at that very time, by adding insolence and obstinacy\nto our wrong-doings. Who is there that can declare himself to have\nbroken no laws? Even if there be such a man, what a stinted innocence\nit is, merely to be innocent by the letter of the law. How much\nfurther do the rules of duty extend than those of the law! how many\nthings which are not to be found in the statute book, are demanded\nby filial feeling, kindness, generosity, equity, and honour? Yet\nwe are not able to warrant ourselves even to come under that first\nnarrowest definition of innocence: we have done what was wrong,\nthought what was wrong, wished for what was wrong, and encouraged\nwhat was wrong: in some cases we have only remained innocent because\nwe did not succeed. When we think of this, let us deal more justly\nwith sinners, and believe that those who scold us are right: in any\ncase let us not be angry with ourselves (for with whom shall we not\nbe angry, if we are angry even with our own selves?), and least of\nall with the gods: for whatever we suffer befalls us not by any\nordinance of theirs but of the common law of all flesh. \u201cBut diseases\nand pains attack us.\u201d Well, people who live in a crazy {103} dwelling\nmust have some way of escape from it. Some one will be said to have\nspoken ill of you: think whether you did not first speak ill of\nhim: think of how many persons you have yourself spoken ill. Let\nus not, I say, suppose that others are doing us a wrong, but are\nrepaying one which we have done them, that some are acting with\ngood intentions, some under compulsion, some in ignorance, and let\nus believe that even he who does so intentionally and knowingly did\nnot wrong us merely for the sake of wronging us, but was led into\ndoing so by the attraction of saying something witty, or did whatever\nhe did, not out of any spite against us, but because he himself\ncould not succeed unless he pushed us back. We are often offended\nby flattery even while it is being lavished upon us: yet whoever\nrecalls to his mind how often he himself has been the victim of\nundeserved suspicion, how often fortune has given his true service\nan appearance of wrong-doing, how many persons he has begun by\nhating and ended by loving, will be able to keep himself from\nbecoming angry straightway, especially if he silently says to himself\nwhen each offence is committed: \u201cI have done this very thing myself.\u201d\nWhere, however, will you find so impartial a judge? The same man\nwho lusts after everyone\u2019s wife, and thinks that a woman\u2019s belonging\nto someone else is a sufficient reason for adoring her, will not\nallow any one else to look at his own wife. No man expects such\nexact fidelity as a traitor: the perjurer himself takes vengeance\nof him who breaks his word: the pettifogging lawyer is most indignant\nat an action being brought against him: the man who is reckless of\nhis own chastity cannot endure any attempt upon that of his slaves.\nWe have other men\u2019s vices before our eyes, and our own behind our\nbacks: hence it is that a father, who is worse than his son, blames\nthe latter for giving extravagant feasts,[10] and disapproves of\n{104} the least sign of luxury in another, although he was wont to\nset no bounds to it in his own case; hence it is that despots are\nangry with homicides, and thefts are punished by those who despoil\ntemples. A great part of mankind is not angry with sins, but with\nsinners. Regard to our own selves[11] will make us more moderate,\nif we inquire of ourselves:\u2014have we ever committed any crime of\nthis sort? have we ever fallen into this kind of error? is it for\nour interest that we should condemn this conduct?\nXXIX. The greatest remedy for anger is delay: beg anger to grant\nyou this at the first, not in order that it may pardon the offence,\nbut that it may form a right judgment about it: if it delays, it\nwill come to an end. Do not attempt to quell it all at once, for\nits first impulses are fierce; by plucking away its parts we shall\nremove the whole. We are made angry by some things which we learn\nat second-hand, and by some which we ourselves hear or see. Now,\nwe ought to be slow to believe what is told us. Many tell lies in\norder to deceive us, and many because they are themselves deceived.\nSome seek to win our favour by false accusations, and invent wrongs\nin order that they may appear angry at our having suffered them.\nOne man lies out of spite, that he may set trusting friends at\nvariance; some because they are suspicious,[12] and wish to see\nsport, and watch from a safe distance those whom they have set by\nthe ears. If you were about to give sentence in court about ever\nso small a sum of money, you would take nothing as proved without\na witness, and a witness would count for nothing except on his oath.\nYou would allow both sides to be heard: you would allow them time:\nyou would not despatch the matter at one sitting, because the oftener\nit is handled the more distinctly the truth appears. And do you\ncondemn your friend off-hand? {105} Are you angry with him before\nyou hear his story, before you have cross-examined him, before he\ncan know either who is his accuser or with what he is charged. Why\nthen, just now, in the case which you just tried, did you hear what\nwas said on both sides? This very man who has informed against your\nfriend, will say no more if he be obliged to prove what he says.\n\u201cYou need not,\u201d says he, \u201cbring me forward as a witness; if I am\nbrought forward I shall deny what I have said; unless you excuse\nme from appearing I shall never tell you anything.\u201d At the same\ntime he spurs you on and withdraws himself from the strife and\nbattle. The man who will tell you nothing save in secret hardly\ntells you anything at all. What can be more unjust than to believe\nin secret, and to be angry openly?\nXXX. Some offences we ourselves witness: in these cases let us\nexamine the disposition and purpose of the offender. Perhaps he is\na child; let us pardon his youth, he knows not whether he is doing\nwrong: or he is a father; he has either rendered such great services,\nas to have won the right even to wrong us\u2014or perhaps this very act\nwhich offends us is his chief merit: or a woman; well, she made a\nmistake. The man did it because he was ordered to do it. Who but\nan unjust person can be angry with what is done under compulsion?\nYou had hurt him: well, there is no wrong in suffering the pain\nwhich you have been the first to inflict. Suppose that your opponent\nis a judge; then you ought to take his opinion rather than your\nown: or that he is a king; then, if he punishes the guilty, yield\nto him because he is just, and if he punishes the innocent, yield\nto him because he is powerful. Suppose that it is a dumb animal or\nas stupid as a dumb animal: then, if you are angry with it, you\nwill make yourself like it. Suppose that it is a disease or a\nmisfortune; it will take less effect upon you if you bear it quietly:\nor that it is a god; then you waste your time by being angry with\nhim as much {106} as if you prayed him to be angry with some one\nelse. Is it a good man who has wronged you? do not believe it: is\nit a bad one? do not be surprised at this; he will pay to some one\nelse the penalty which he owes to you\u2014indeed, by his sin he has\nalready punished himself.\nXXXI. There are, as I have stated, two cases which produce anger:\nfirst, when we appear to have received an injury, about which enough\nhas been said, and, secondly, when we appear to have been treated\nunjustly: this must now be discussed. Men think some things unjust\nbecause they ought not to suffer them, and some because they did\nnot expect to suffer them: we think what is unexpected is beneath\nour deserts. Consequently, we are especially excited at what befalls\nus contrary to our hope and expectation: and this is why we are\nirritated at the smallest trifles in our own domestic affairs, and\nwhy we call our friends\u2019 carelessness deliberate injury. How is it,\nthen, asks our opponent, that we are angered by the injuries inflicted\nby our enemies? It is because we did not expect those particular\ninjuries, or, at any rate, not on so extensive a scale. This is\ncaused by our excessive self-love: we think that we ought to remain\nuninjured even by our enemies: every man bears within his breast\nthe mind of a despot, and is willing to commit excesses, but unwilling\nto submit to them. Thus it is either ignorance or arrogance that\nmakes us angry: ignorance of common facts; for what is there to\nwonder at in bad men committing evil deeds? what novelty is there\nin your enemy hurting you, your friend quarrelling with you, your\nson going wrong, or your servant doing amiss? Fabius was wont to\nsay that the most shameful excuse a general could make was \u201cI did\nnot think.\u201d I think it the most shameful excuse that a man can make.\nThink of everything, expect everything: even with men of good\ncharacter something queer will crop up; human nature produces minds\nthat are treacherous, ungrateful, greedy, and impious: when you are\nconsidering what any {107} man\u2019s morals may be, think what those\nof mankind are. When you are especially enjoying yourself, be\nespecially on your guard: when everything seems to you to be peaceful,\nbe sure that mischief is not absent, but only asleep. Always believe\nthat something will occur to offend you. A pilot never spreads all\nhis canvas abroad so confidently as not to keep his tackle for\nshortening sail ready for use. Think, above all, how base and hateful\nis the power of doing mischief, and how unnatural in man, by whose\nkindness even fierce animals are rendered tame. See how bulls yield\ntheir necks to the yoke, how elephants[13] allow boys and women to\ndance on their backs unhurt, how snakes glide harmlessly over our\nbosoms and among our drinking-cups, how within their dens bears and\nlions submit to be handled with complacent mouths, and wild beasts\nfawn upon their master: let us blush to have exchanged habits with\nwild beasts. It is a crime to injure one\u2019s country: so it is,\ntherefore, to injure any of our countrymen, for he is a part of our\ncountry; if the whole be sacred, the parts must be sacred too.\nTherefore it is also a crime to injure any man: for he is your\nfellow-citizen in a larger state. What, if the hands were to wish\nto hurt the feet? or the eyes to hurt the hands? As all the limbs\nact in unison, because it is the interest of the whole body to keep\neach one of them safe, so men should spare one another, because\nthey are born for society. The bond of society, however, cannot\nexist unless it guards and loves all its members. We should not\neven destroy vipers and water-snakes and other creatures whose teeth\nand claws are dangerous, if we were able to tame them as we do other\nanimals, or to prevent their being a peril to us: neither ought we,\ntherefore, to hurt a man because he has done wrong, but lest he\nshould do wrong, and our punishment should always look to the future,\nand never to the past, because it is inflicted in a spirit of\nprecaution, not of anger: for if everyone {108} who has a crooked\nand vicious disposition were to be punished, no one would escape\npunishment.\nXXXII. \u201cBut anger possesses a certain pleasure of its own, and it\nis sweet to pay back the pain you have suffered.\u201d Not at all; it\nis not honourable to requite injuries by injuries, in the same way\nas it is to repay benefits by benefits. In the latter case it is a\nshame to be conquered; in the former it is a shame to conquer.\nRevenge and retaliation are words which men use and even think to\nbe righteous, yet they do not greatly differ from wrong-doing,\nexcept in the order in which they are done: he who renders pain for\npain has more excuse for his sin; that is all. Some one who did not\nknow Marcus Cato struck him in the public bath in his ignorance,\nfor who would knowingly have done him an injury? Afterwards when\nhe was apologizing, Cato replied, \u201cI do not remember being struck.\u201d\nHe thought it better to ignore the insult than to revenge it. You\nask, \u201cDid no harm befall that man for his insolence?\u201d No, but rather\nmuch good; he made the acquaintance of Cato. It is the part of a\ngreat mind to despise wrongs done to it; the most contemptuous form\nof revenge is not to deem one\u2019s adversary worth taking vengeance\nupon. Many have taken small injuries much more seriously to heart\nthan they need, by revenging them: that man is great and noble who\nlike a large wild animal hears unmoved the tiny curs that bark at\nhim.\nXXXIII. \u201cWe are treated,\u201d says our opponent, \u201cwith more respect if\nwe revenge our injuries.\u201d If we make use of revenge merely as a\nremedy, let us use it without anger, and not regard revenge as\npleasant, but as useful: yet often it is better to pretend not to\nhave received an injury than to avenge it. The wrongs of the powerful\nmust not only be borne, but borne with a cheerful countenance: they\nwill repeat the wrong if they think they have inflicted it. This\nis the worst trait of minds rendered arrogant by {109} prosperity,\nthey hate those whom they have injured. Every one knows the saying\nof the old courtier, who, when some one asked him how he had achieved\nthe rare distinction of living at court till he reached old age,\nreplied, \u201cBy receiving wrongs and returning thanks for them.\u201d It\nis often so far from expedient to avenge our wrongs, that it will\nnot do even to admit them. Gaius Caesar, offended at the smart\nclothes and well-dressed hair of the son of Pastor, a distinguished\nRoman knight, sent him to prison. When the father begged that his\nson might suffer no harm, Caius, as if reminded by this to put him\nto death, ordered him to be executed, yet, in order to mitigate his\nbrutality to the father, invited him that very day to dinner. Pastor\ncame with a countenance which betrayed no illwill. Caesar pledged\nhim in a glass of wine, and set a man to watch him. The wretched\ncreature went through his part, feeling as though he were drinking\nhis son\u2019s blood: the emperor sent him some perfume and a garland,\nand gave orders to watch whether he used them: he did so. On the\nvery day on which he had buried, nay, on which he had not even\nburied his son, he sat down as one of a hundred guests, and, old\nand gouty as he was, drank to an extent which would have been hardly\ndecent on a child\u2019s birthday; he shed no tear the while; he did not\npermit his grief to betray itself by the slightest sign; he dined\njust as though his entreaties had gained his son\u2019s life. You ask\nme why he did so? he had another son. What did Priam do in the\nIliad? Did he not conceal his wrath and embrace the knees of Achilles?\ndid he not raise to his lips that death-dealing hand, stained with\nthe blood of his son, and sup with his slayer? True! but there were\nno perfumes and garlands, and his fierce enemy encouraged him with\nmany soothing words to eat, not to drain huge goblets with a guard\nstanding over him to see that he did it. Had he only feared for\nhimself, the father would have treated the {110} tyrant with scorn:\nbut love for his son quenched his anger: he deserved the emperor\u2019s\npermission to leave the banquet and gather up the bones of his son:\nbut, meanwhile, that kindly and polite youth the emperor would not\neven permit him to do this, but tormented the old man with frequent\ninvitations to drink, advising him thereby to lighten his sorrows.\nHe, on the other hand, appeared to be in good spirits, and to have\nforgotten what had been done that day: he would have lost his second\nson had he proved an unacceptable guest to the murderer of his\neldest.\nXXXIV. We must, therefore, refrain from anger, whether he who\nprovokes us be on a level with ourselves, or above us, or below us.\nA contest with one\u2019s equal is of uncertain issue, with one\u2019s superior\nis folly, and with one\u2019s inferior is contemptible. It is the part\nof a mean and wretched man to turn and bite one\u2019s biter: even mice\nand ants show their teeth if you put your hand to them, and all\nfeeble creatures think that they are hurt if they are touched. It\nwill make us milder tempered to call to mind any services which he\nwith whom we are angry may have done us, and to let his deserts\nbalance his offence. Let us also reflect, how much credit the tale\nof our forgiveness will confer upon us, how many men may be made\ninto valuable friends by forgiveness. One of the lessons which\nSulla\u2019s cruelty teaches us is not to be angry with the children of\nour enemies, whether they be public or private; for he drove the\nsons of the proscribed into exile. Nothing is more unjust than that\nany one should inherit the quarrels of his father. Whenever we are\nloth to pardon any one, let us think whether it would be to our\nadvantage that all men should be inexorable. He who refuses to\npardon, how often has he begged it for himself? how often has he\ngrovelled at the feet of those whom he spurns from his own? How can\nwe gain more glory than by turning anger {111} into friendship?\nwhat more faithful allies has the Roman people than those who have\nbeen its most unyielding enemies? where would the empire be to-day,\nhad not a wise foresight united the conquered and the conquerors?\nIf any one is angry with you, meet his anger by returning benefits\nfor it: a quarrel which is only taken up on one side falls to the\nground: it takes two men to fight. But[14] suppose that there is\nan angry struggle on both sides, even then, he is the better man\nwho first gives way; the winner is the real loser. He struck you;\nwell then, do you fall back: if you strike him in turn you will\ngive him both an opportunity and an excuse for striking you again:\nyou will not be able to withdraw yourself from the struggle when\nyou please.\nXXXV. Does any one wish to strike his enemy so hard, as to leave\nhis own hand in the wound, and not to be able to recover his balance\nafter the blow? yet such a weapon is anger: it is scarcely possible\nto draw it back. We are careful to choose for ourselves light\nweapons, handy and manageable swords: shall we not avoid these\nclumsy, unwieldy,[15] and never-to-be-recalled impulses of the mind?\nThe only swiftness of which men approve is that which, when bidden,\nchecks itself and proceeds no further, and which can be guided, and\nreduced from a run to a walk: we know that the sinews are diseased\nwhen they move against our will. A man must be either aged or weakly\nwho runs when he wants to walk: let us think that those are the\nmost powerful and the soundest operations of our minds, which act\nunder our own control, not at their own caprice. Nothing, however,\nwill be of so much service as to consider, first, the hideousness,\nand, secondly, the danger of anger. No passion bears a more troubled\naspect: it befouls the fairest face, makes fierce the expression\nwhich before was peaceful. From the angry \u201call grace has fled;\u201d\n{112} though their clothing may be fashionable, they will trail it\non the ground and take no heed of their appearance; though their\nhair be smoothed down in a comely manner by nature or art, yet it\nwill bristle up in sympathy with their mind. The veins become\nswollen, the breast will be shaken by quick breathing, the man\u2019s\nneck will be swelled as he roars forth his frantic talk: then, too,\nhis limbs will tremble, his hands will be restless, his whole body\nwill sway hither and thither. What, think you, must be the state\nof his mind within him, when its appearance without is so shocking?\nhow far more dreadful a countenance he bears within his own breast,\nhow far keener pride, how much more violent rage, which will burst\nhim unless it finds some vent? Let us paint anger looking like those\nwho are dripping with the blood of foemen or savage beasts, or those\nwho are just about to slaughter them\u2014like those monsters of the\nnether world fabled by the poet to be girt with serpents and breathing\nflame, when they sally forth from hell, most frightful to behold,\nin order that they may kindle wars, stir up strife between nations,\nand overthrow peace; let us paint her eyes glowing with fire, her\nvoice hissing, roaring, grating, and making worse sounds if worse\nthere be, while she brandishes weapons in both hands, for she cares\nnot to protect herself, gloomy, stained with blood, covered with\nscars and livid with her own blows, reeling like a maniac, wrapped\nin a thick cloud, dashing hither and thither, spreading desolation\nand panic, loathed by every one and by herself above all, willing,\nif otherwise she cannot hurt her foe, to overthrow alike earth,\nsea, and heaven, harmful and hateful at the same time. Or, if we\nare to see her, let her be such as our poets have described her\u2014\n\u201cThere with her blood-stained scourge Bellona fights.  And\nDiscord in her riven robe  delights,\u201d[16]\n{113} or, if possible, let some even more dreadful aspect be invented\nfor this dreadful passion.\nXXXVI. Some angry people, as Sextius remarks, have been benefited\nby looking at the glass: they have been struck by so great an\nalteration in their own appearance: they have been, as it were,\nbrought into their own presence and have not recognized themselves:\nyet how small a part of the real hideousness of anger did that\nreflected image in the mirror reproduce? Could the mind be displayed\nor made to appear through any substance, we should be confounded\nwhen we beheld how black and stained, how agitated, distorted, and\nswollen it looked: even at present it is very ugly when seen through\nall the screens of blood, bones, and so forth: what would it be,\nwere it displayed uncovered? You say, that you do not believe that\nany one was ever scared out of anger by a mirror: and why not?\nBecause when he came to the mirror to change his mind, he had changed\nit already: to angry men no face looks fairer than one that is\nfierce and savage and such as they wish to look like. We ought\nrather to consider, how many men anger itself has injured. Some in\ntheir excessive heat have burst their veins; some by straining their\nvoices beyond their strength have vomited blood, or have injured\ntheir sight by too violently injecting humours into their eyes, and\nhave fallen sick when the fit passed off. No way leads more swiftly\nto madness: many have, consequently, remained always in the frenzy\nof anger, and, having once lost their reason, have never recovered\nit. Ajax was driven mad by anger, and driven to suicide by madness.\nMen, frantic with rage, call upon heaven to slay their children,\nto reduce themselves to poverty, and to ruin their houses, and yet\ndeclare that they are not either angry or insane. Enemies to their\nbest friends, dangerous to their nearest and dearest, regardless\nof the laws save where they injure, swayed by the smallest trifles,\nunwilling to lend their ears {114} to the advice or the services\nof their friends, they do everything by main force, and are ready\neither to fight with their swords or to throw themselves upon them,\nfor the greatest of all evils, and one which surpasses all vices,\nhas gained possession of them. Other passions gain a footing in the\nmind by slow degrees: anger\u2019s conquest is sudden and complete, and,\nmoreover, it makes all other passions subservient to itself. It\nconquers the warmest love: men have thrust swords through the bodies\nof those whom they loved, and have slain those in whose arms they\nhave lain. Avarice, that sternest and most rigid of passions, is\ntrampled underfoot by anger, which forces it to squander its carefully\ncollected wealth and set fire to its house and all its property in\none heap. Why, has not even the ambitious man been known to fling\naway the most highly valued ensigns of rank, and to refuse high\noffice when it was offered to him? There is no passion over which\nanger does not bear absolute rule.\n[1] \u201c_Vehiculorum ridicule Koch_,\u201d says Gertz, justly, \u201c_vitiorum_\nmakes excellent sense.\u201d\u2014J. E. B.

ANNAEUS SENECA, ADDRESSED TO\nNOVATUS.\nOF ANGER.\nBook III.\nI. We will now, my Novatus, attempt to do that which you so especially\nlong to do, that is, to drive out anger from our minds, or at all\nevents to curb it and restrain its impulses. This may sometimes be\ndone openly and without concealment, when we are only suffering\nfrom a slight attack of this mischief, and at other times it must\nbe done secretly, when our anger is excessively hot, and when every\nobstacle thrown in its way increases it and makes it blaze higher.\nIt is important to know how great and how fresh its strength may\nbe, and whether it can be driven forcibly back and suppressed, or\nwhether we must give way to it until its first storm blow over,\nlest it sweep away with it our remedies themselves. We must deal\nwith each case according to each man\u2019s character: some yield to\nentreaties, others are rendered arrogant and masterful by submission:\nwe may frighten some men out of their anger, while some may be\nturned from their purpose by reproaches, some by acknowledging\noneself to be in the wrong, some by shame, and some by delay, a\ntardy remedy for a hasty disorder, which we ought only to use when\nall others have failed: {116} for other passions admit of having\ntheir case put off, and may be healed at a later time; but the eager\nand self-destructive violence of anger does not grow up by slow\ndegrees, but reaches its full height as soon as it begins. Nor does\nit, like other vices, merely disturb men\u2019s minds, but it takes them\naway, and torments them till they are incapable of restraining\nthemselves and eager for the common ruin of all men, nor does it\nrage merely against its object, but against every obstacle which\nit encounters on its way. The other vices move our minds; anger\nhurls them headlong. If we are not able to withstand our passions,\nyet at any rate our passions ought to stand firm: but anger grows\nmore and more powerful, like lightning flashes or hurricanes, or\nany other things which cannot stop themselves because they do not\nproceed along, but fall from above. Other vices affect our judgment,\nanger affects our sanity: others come in mild attacks and grow\nunnoticed, but men\u2019s minds plunge abruptly into anger. There is no\npassion that is more frantic, more destructive to its own self; it\nis arrogant if successful, and frantic if it fails. Even when\ndefeated it does not grow weary, but if chance places its foe beyond\nits reach, it turns its teeth against itself. Its intensity is in\nno way regulated by its origin: for it rises to the greatest heights\nfrom the most trivial beginnings.\nII. It passes over no time of life; no race of men is exempt from\nit: some nations have been saved from the knowledge of luxury by\nthe blessing of poverty; some through their active and wandering\nhabits have escaped from sloth; those whose manners are unpolished\nand whose life is rustic know not chicanery and fraud and all the\nevils to which the courts of law give birth: but there is no race\nwhich is not excited by anger, which is equally powerful with Greeks\nand barbarians, and is just as ruinous among law-abiding folk as\namong those whose only law is that of the {117} stronger. Finally,\nthe other passions seize upon individuals; anger is the only one\nwhich sometimes possesses a whole state. No entire people ever fell\nmadly in love with a woman, nor did any nation ever set its affections\naltogether upon gain and profit. Ambition attacks single individuals;\nungovernable rage is the only passion that affects nations. People\noften fly into a passion by troops; men and women, old men and boys,\nprinces and populace all act alike, and the whole multitude, after\nbeing excited by a very few words, outdoes even its exciter: men\nbetake themselves straightway to fire and sword, and proclaim a war\nagainst their neighbours or wage one against their countrymen. Whole\nhouses are burned with the entire families which they contain, and\nhe who but lately was honoured for his popular eloquence now finds\nthat his speech moves people to rage. Legions aim their darts at\ntheir commander; the whole populace quarrels with the nobles; the\nsenate, without waiting for troops to be levied or appointing a\ngeneral, hastily chooses leaders, for its anger chases well-born\nmen through the houses of Rome, and puts them to death with its own\nhand. Ambassadors are outraged, the law of nations violated, and\nan unnatural madness seizes the state. Without allowing time for\nthe general excitement to subside, fleets are straightway launched\nand laden with a hastily enrolled soldiery. Without organization,\nwithout taking any auspices, the populace rushes into the field\nguided only by its own anger, snatches up whatever comes first to\nhand by way of arms, and then atones by a great defeat for the\nreckless audacity of its anger. This is usually the fate of savage\nnations when they plunge into war: as soon as their easily excited\nminds are roused by the appearance of wrong having been done them,\nthey straightway hasten forth, and, guided only by their wounded\nfeelings, fall like an avalanche upon our legions, without either\ndiscipline, fear, or precaution, and wilfully seeking for danger.\nThey {118} delight in being struck, in pressing forward to meet the\nblow, writhing their bodies along the weapon, and perishing by a\nwound which they themselves make.\nIII. \u201cNo doubt,\u201d you say, \u201canger is very powerful and ruinous: point\nout, therefore, how it may be cured.\u201d Yet, as I stated in my former\nbooks, Aristotle stands forth in defence of anger, and forbids it\nto be uprooted, saying that it is the spur of virtue, and that when\nit is taken away, our minds become weaponless, and slow to attempt\ngreat exploits. It is therefore essential to prove its unseemliness\nand ferocity, and to place distinctly before our eyes how monstrous\na thing it is that one man should rage against another, with what\nfrantic violence he rushes to destroy alike himself and his foe,\nand overthrows those very things whose fall he himself must share.\nWhat, then? can any one call this man sane, who, as though caught\nup by a hurricane, does not go but is driven, and is the slave of\na senseless disorder? He does not commit to another the duty of\nrevenging him, but himself exacts it, raging alike in thought and\ndeed, butchering those who are dearest to him, and for whose loss\nhe himself will ere long weep. Will any one give this passion as\nan assistant and companion to virtue, although it disturbs calm\nreason, without which virtue can do nothing? The strength which a\nsick man owes to a paroxysm of disease is neither lasting nor\nwholesome, and is strong only to its own destruction. You need not,\ntherefore, imagine that I am wasting time over a useless task in\ndefaming anger, as though men had not made up their minds about it,\nwhen there is some one, and he, too, an illustrious philosopher,\nwho assigns it services to perform, and speaks of it as useful and\nsupplying energy for battles, for the management of business, and\nindeed for everything which requires to be conducted with spirit.\nLest it should delude any one into thinking that on certain occasions\nand in certain positions it may be useful, we must show its {119}\nunbridled and frenzied madness, we must restore to it its attributes,\nthe rack, the cord, the dungeon, and the cross, the fires lighted\nround men\u2019s buried bodies, the hook[1] that drags both living men\nand corpses, the different kinds of fetters, and of punishments,\nthe mutilations of limbs, the branding of the forehead, the dens\nof savage beasts. Anger should be represented as standing among\nthese her instruments, growling in an ominous and terrible fashion,\nherself more shocking than any of the means by which she gives vent\nto her fury.\nIV. There may be some doubt about the others, but at any rate no\npassion has a worse look. We have described the angry man\u2019s appearance\nin our former books, how sharp and keen he looks, at one time pale\nas his blood is driven inwards and backwards, at another with all\nthe heat and fire of his body directed to his face, making it\nreddish-coloured as if stained with blood, his eyes now restless\nand starting out of his head, now set motionless in one fixed gaze.\nAdd to this his teeth, which gnash against one another, as though\nhe wished to eat somebody, with exactly the sound of a wild boar\nsharpening his tusks: add also the cracking of his joints, the\ninvoluntary wringing of his hands, the frequent slaps he deals\nhimself on the chest, his hurried breathing and deep-drawn sighs,\nhis reeling body, his abrupt broken speech, and his trembling lips,\nwhich sometimes he draws tight as he hisses some curse through them.\nBy Hercules, no wild beast, neither when tortured by hunger, or\nwith a weapon struck through its vitals, not even when it gathers\nits last breath to bite its slayer, looks so shocking as a man\nraging with anger. Listen, if you have leisure, to his words {120}\nand threats: how dreadful is the language of his agonized mind!\nWould not every man wish to lay aside anger when he sees that it\nbegins by injuring himself? When men employ anger as the most\npowerful of agents, consider it to be a proof of power, and reckon\na speedy revenge among the greatest blessings of great prosperity,\nwould you not wish me to warn them that he who is the slave of his\nown anger is not powerful, nor even free? Would you not wish me to\nwarn all the more industrious and circumspect of men, that while\nother evil passions assail the base, anger gradually obtains dominion\nover the minds even of learned and in other respects sensible men?\nSo true is that, that some declare anger to be a proof of\nstraight-forwardness, and it is commonly believed that the best-natured\npeople are prone to it.\nV. You ask me, whither does all this tend? To prove, I answer, that\nno one should imagine himself to be safe from anger, seeing that\nit rouses up even those who are naturally gentle and quiet to commit\nsavage and violent acts. As strength of body and assiduous care of\nthe health avail nothing against a pestilence, which attacks the\nstrong and weak alike, so also steady and good-humoured people are\njust as liable to attacks of anger as those of unsettled character,\nand in the case of the former it is both more to be ashamed of and\nmore to be feared, because it makes a greater alteration in their\nhabits. Now as the first thing is not to be angry, the second to\nlay aside our anger, and the third to be able to heal the anger of\nothers as well as our own, I will set forth first how we may avoid\nfalling into anger; next, how we may set ourselves free from it,\nand, lastly, how we may restrain an angry man, appease his wrath,\nand bring him back to his right mind. We shall succeed in avoiding\nanger, if from time to time we lay before our minds all the vices\nconnected with anger, and estimate it at its real value: it must\nbe prosecuted {121} before us and convicted: its evils must be\nthoroughly investigated and exposed. That we may see what it is,\nlet it be compared with the worst vices. Avarice scrapes together\nand amasses riches for some better man to use: anger spends money;\nfew can indulge in it for nothing. How many slaves an angry master\ndrives to run away or to commit suicide! how much more he loses by\nhis anger than the value of what he originally became angry about!\nAnger brings grief to a father, divorce to a husband, hatred to a\nmagistrate, failure to a candidate for office. It is worse than\nluxury, because luxury enjoys its own pleasure, while anger enjoys\nanother\u2019s pain. It is worse than either spitefulness or envy; for\nthey wish that some one may become unhappy, while anger wishes to\nmake him so: they are pleased when evil befalls one by accident,\nbut anger cannot wait upon Fortune; it desires to injure its victim\npersonally, and is not satisfied merely with his being injured.\nNothing is more dangerous than jealousy: it is produced by anger.\nNothing is more ruinous than war: it is the outcome of powerful\nmen\u2019s anger; and even the anger of humble private persons, though\nwithout arms or armies, is nevertheless war. Moreover, even if we\npass over its immediate consequences, such as heavy losses, treacherous\nplots, and the constant anxiety produced by strife, anger pays a\npenalty at the same moment that it exacts one: it forswears human\nfeelings. The latter urge us to love, anger urges us to hatred: the\nlatter bid us do men good, anger bids us do them harm. Add to this\nthat, although its rage arises from an excessive self-respect and\nappears to show high spirit, it really is contemptible and mean:\nfor a man must be inferior to one by whom he thinks himself despised,\nwhereas the truly great mind, which takes a true estimate of its\nown value, does not revenge an insult because it does not feel it.\nAs weapons rebound from a hard surface, and solid substances hurt\n{122} those who strike them, so also no insult can make a really\ngreat mind sensible of its presence, being weaker than that against\nwhich it is aimed. How far more glorious is it to throw back all\nwrongs and insults from oneself, like one wearing armour of proof\nagainst all weapons, for revenge is an admission that we have been\nhurt. That cannot be a great mind which is disturbed by injury. He\nwho has hurt you must be either stronger or weaker than yourself.\nIf he be weaker, spare him: if he be stronger, spare yourself.\nVI. There is no greater proof of magnanimity than that nothing which\nbefalls you should be able to move you to anger. The higher region\nof the universe, being more excellently ordered and near to the\nstars, is never gathered into clouds, driven about by storms, or\nwhirled round by cyclones: it is free from all disturbance: the\nlightnings flash in the region below it. In like manner a lofty\nmind, always placid and dwelling in a serene atmosphere, restraining\nwithin itself all the impulses from which anger springs, is modest,\ncommands respect, and remains calm and collected: none of which\nqualities will you find in an angry man: for who, when under the\ninfluence of grief and rage, does not first get rid of bashfulness?\nwho, when excited and confused and about to attack some one, does\nnot fling away any habits of shamefacedness he may have possessed?\nwhat angry man attends to the number or routine of his duties? who\nuses moderate language? who keeps any part of his body quiet? who\ncan guide himself when in full career? We shall find much profit\nin that sound maxim of Democritus which defines peace of mind to\nconsist in not labouring much, or too much for our strength, either\nin public or private matters. A man\u2019s day, if he is engaged in many\nvarious occupations, never passes so happily that no man or no thing\nshould give rise to some offence which makes the mind ripe for\nanger. Just as when one hurries through the crowded parts of the\ncity {123} one cannot help jostling many people, and one cannot\nhelp slipping at one place, being hindered at another, and splashed\nat another, so when one\u2019s life is spent in disconnected pursuits\nand wanderings, one must meet with many troubles and many accusations.\nOne man deceives our hopes, another delays their fulfilment, another\ndestroys them: our projects do not proceed according to our intention.\nNo one is so favoured by Fortune as to find her always on his side\nif he tempts her often: and from this it follows that he who sees\nseveral enterprises turn out contrary to his wishes becomes\ndissatisfied with both men and things, and on the slightest provocation\nflies into a rage with people, with undertakings, with places, with\nfortune, or with himself. In order, therefore, that the mind may\nbe at peace, it ought not to be hurried hither and thither, nor,\nas I said before, wearied by labour at great matters, or matters\nwhose attainment is beyond its strength. It is easy to fit one\u2019s\nshoulder to a light burden, and to shift it from one side to the\nother without dropping it: but we have difficulty in bearing the\nburdens which others\u2019 hands lay upon us, and when overweighted by\nthem we fling them off upon our neighbours. Even when we do stand\nupright under our load, we nevertheless reel beneath a weight which\nis beyond our strength.\nVII. Be assured that the same rule applies both to public and private\nlife: simple and manageable undertakings proceed according to the\npleasure of the person in charge of them, but enormous ones, beyond\nhis capacity to manage, are not easily undertaken. When he has got\nthem to administer, they hinder him, and press hard upon him, and\njust as he thinks that success is within his grasp, they collapse,\nand carry him with them: thus it comes about that a man\u2019s wishes\nare often disappointed if he does not apply himself to easy tasks,\nyet wishes that the tasks which he undertakes may be easy. Whenever\nyou would attempt anything, first {124} form an estimate both of\nyour own powers, of the extent of the matter which you are undertaking,\nand of the means by which you are to accomplish it: for if you have\nto abandon your work when it is half done, the disappointment will\nsour your temper. In such cases, it makes a difference whether one\nis of an ardent or of a cold and unenterprising temperament: for\nfailure will rouse a generous spirit to anger, and will move a\nsluggish and dull one to sorrow. Let our undertakings, therefore,\nbe neither petty nor yet presumptuous and reckless: let our hopes\nnot range far from home: let us attempt nothing which if we succeed\nwill make us astonished at our success.\nVIII. Since we know not how to endure an injury, let us take care\nnot to receive one: we should live with the quietest and easiest-tempered\npersons, not with anxious or with sullen ones: for our own habits\nare copied from those with whom we associate, and just as some\nbodily diseases are communicated by touch, so also the mind transfers\nits vices to its neighbours. A drunkard leads even those who reproach\nhim to grow fond of wine: profligate society will, if permitted,\nimpair the morals even of robust-minded men: avarice infects those\nnearest it with its poison. Virtues do the same thing in the opposite\ndirection, and improve all those with whom they are brought in\ncontact: it is as good for one of unsettled principles to associate\nwith better men than himself as for an invalid to live in a warm\ncountry with a healthy climate. You will understand how much may\nbe effected this way, if you observe how even wild beasts grow tame\nby dwelling among us, and how no animal, however ferocious, continues\nto be wild, if it has long been accustomed to human companionship:\nall its savageness becomes softened, and amid peaceful scenes is\ngradually forgotten. We must add to this, that the man who lives\nwith quiet people is not only improved by their example, but also\nby the fact that he finds no reason for anger and does not practise\nhis {125} vice: it will, therefore, be his duty to avoid all those\nwho he knows will excite his anger. You ask, who these are: many\nwill bring about the same thing by various means; a proud man will\noffend you by his disdain, a talkative man by his abuse, an impudent\nman by his insults, a spiteful man by his malice, a quarrelsome man\nby his wrangling, a braggart and liar by his vain-gloriousness: you\nwill not endure to be feared by a suspicious man, conquered by an\nobstinate one, or scorned by an ultra-refined one: Choose\nstraightforward, good-natured, steady people, who will not provoke\nyour wrath, and will bear with it. Those whose dispositions are\nyielding, polite and suave, will be of even greater service, provided\nthey do not flatter, for excessive obsequiousness irritates\nbad-tempered men. One of my own friends was a good man indeed, but\ntoo prone to anger, and it was as dangerous to flatter him as to\ncurse him. Caelius the orator, it is well known, was the worst-tempered\nman possible. It is said that once he was dining in his own chamber\nwith an especially long-suffering client, but had great difficulty\nwhen thrown thus into a man\u2019s society to avoid quarrelling with\nhim. The other thought it best to agree to whatever he said, and\nto play second fiddle, but Caelius could not bear his obsequious\nagreement, and exclaimed, \u201cDo contradict me in something, that there\nmay be two of us!\u201d Yet even he, who was angry at not being angry,\nsoon recovered his temper, because he had no one to fight with. If,\nthen, we are conscious of an irascible disposition, let us especially\nchoose for our friends those who will look and speak as we do: they\nwill pamper us and lead us into a bad habit of listening to nothing\nthat does not please us, but it will be good to give our anger\nrespite and repose. Even those who are naturally crabbed and wild\nwill yield to caresses: no creature continues either angry or\nfrightened if you pat him. Whenever a controversy seems likely to\nbe longer or more keenly disputed than usual, let us check its first\nbeginnings, before it gathers strength. {126} A dispute nourishes\nitself as it proceeds, and takes hold of those who plunge too deeply\ninto it: it is easier to stand aloof than to extricate oneself from\na struggle.\nIX. Irascible men ought not to meddle with the more serious class\nof occupations, or, at any rate, ought to stop short of weariness\nin the pursuit of them; their mind ought not to be engaged upon\nhard subjects, but handed over to pleasing arts: let it be softened\nby reading poetry, and interested by legendary history: let it be\ntreated with luxury and refinement. Pythagoras used to calm his\ntroubled spirit by playing upon the lyre: and who does not know\nthat trumpets and clarions are irritants, just as some airs are\nlullabies and soothe the mind? Green is good for wearied eyes, and\nsome colours are grateful to weak sight, while the brightness of\nothers is painful to it. In the same way cheerful pursuits soothe\nunhealthy minds. We must avoid law courts, pleadings, verdicts, and\neverything else that aggravates our fault, and we ought no less to\navoid bodily weariness; for it exhausts all that is quiet and gentle\nin us, and rouses bitterness. For this reason those who cannot trust\ntheir digestion, when they are about to transact business of\nimportance always allay their bile with food, for it is peculiarly\nirritated by fatigue, either because it draws the vital heat into\nthe middle of the body, and injures the blood and stops its circulation\nby the clogging of the veins, or else because the worn-out and\nweakened body reacts upon the mind: this is certainly the reason\nwhy those who are broken by ill-health or age are more irascible\nthan other men. Hunger also and thirst should be avoided for the\nsame reason; they exasperate and irritate men\u2019s minds: it is an old\nsaying that \u201ca weary man is quarrelsome \u201c: and so also is a hungry\nor a thirsty man, or one who is suffering from any cause whatever:\nfor just as sores pain one at the slightest touch, and afterwards\neven at the fear of being touched, so an unsound mind takes offence\nat the slightest things, so that even a {127} greeting, a letter,\na speech, or a question, provokes some men to anger.\nX. That which is diseased can never bear to be handled without\ncomplaining: it is best, therefore, to apply remedies to oneself\nas soon as we feel that anything is wrong, to allow oneself as\nlittle licence as possible in speech, and to restrain one\u2019s\nimpetuosity: now it is easy to detect the first growth of our\npassions: the symptoms precede the disorder. Just as the signs of\nstorms and rain come before the storms themselves, so there are\ncertain forerunners of anger, love, and all the storms which torment\nour minds. Those who suffer from epilepsy know that the fit is\ncoming on if their extremities become cold, their sight fails, their\nsinews tremble, their memory deserts them, and their head swims:\nthey accordingly check the growing disorder by applying the usual\nremedies: they try to prevent the loss of their senses by smelling\nor tasting some drug; they battle against cold and stiffness of\nlimbs by hot fomentations; or, if all remedies fail, they retire\napart, and faint where no one sees them fall. It is useful for a\nman to understand his disease, and to break its strength before it\nbecomes developed. Let us see what it is that especially irritates\nus. Some men take offence at insulting words, others at deeds: one\nwishes his pedigree, another his person, to be treated with respect.\nThis man wishes to be considered especially fashionable, that man\nto be thought especially learned: one cannot bear pride, another\ncannot bear obstinacy. One thinks it beneath him to be angry with\nhis slaves, another is cruel at home, but gentle abroad. One imagines\nthat he is proposed for office because he is unpopular, another\nthinks himself insulted because he is not proposed. People do not\nall take offence in the same way; you ought then to know what your\nown weak point is, that you may guard it with especial care.\nXI. It is better not to see or to hear everything: many causes of\noffence may pass by us, most of which are disregarded {128} by the\nman who ignores them. Would you not be irascible? then be not\ninquisitive. He who seeks to know what is said about him, who digs\nup spiteful tales even if they were told in secret, is himself the\ndestroyer of his own peace of mind. Some stories may be so construed\nas to appear to be insults: wherefore it is best to put some aside,\nto laugh at others, and to pardon others. There are many ways in\nwhich anger may be checked; most things may be turned into jest.\nIt is said that Socrates when he was given a box on the ear, merely\nsaid that it was a pity a man could not tell when he ought to wear\nhis helmet out walking. It does not so much matter how an injury\nis done, as how it is borne; and I do not see how moderation can\nbe hard to practise, when I know that even despots, though success\nand impunity combine to swell their pride, have sometimes restrained\ntheir natural ferocity. At any rate, tradition informs us that once,\nwhen a guest in his cups bitterly reproached Pisistratus, the despot\nof Athens, for his cruelty, many of those present offered to lay\nhands on the traitor, and one said one thing and one another to\nkindle his wrath, he bore it coolly, and replied to those who were\negging him on, that he was no more angry with the man than he should\nbe with one who ran against him blindfold.\nXII. A large part of mankind manufacture their own grievances either\nby entertaining unfounded suspicions or by exaggerating trifles.\nAnger often comes to us, but we often go to it. It ought never to\nbe sent for: even when it falls in our way it ought to be flung\naside. No one says to himself, \u201cI myself have done or might have\ndone this very thing which I am angry with another for doing.\u201d No\none considers the intention of the doer, but merely the thing done:\nyet we ought to think about him, and whether he did it intentionally\nor accidentally, under compulsion or under a mistake, whether he\ndid it out of hatred for us, or to gain something for himself,\nwhether he did it to please himself {129} or to serve a friend. In\nsome cases the age, in others the worldly fortunes of the culprit\nmay render it humane or advantageous to bear with him and put up\nwith what he has done. Let us put ourselves in the place of him\nwith whom we are angry: at present an overweening conceit of our\nown importance makes us prone to anger, and we are quite willing\nto do to others what we cannot endure should be done to ourselves.\nNo one will postpone his anger: yet delay is the best remedy for\nit, because it allows its first glow to subside, and gives time for\nthe cloud which darkens the mind either to disperse or at any rate\nto become less dense. Of these wrongs which drive you frantic, some\nwill grow lighter after an interval, not of a day, but even of an\nhour: some will vanish altogether. Even if you gain nothing by your\nadjournment, still what you do after it will appear to be the result\nof mature deliberation, not of anger. If you want to find out the\ntruth about anything, commit the task to time: nothing can be\naccurately discerned at a time of disturbance. Plato, when angry\nwith his slave, could not prevail upon himself to wait, but straightway\nordered him to take off his shirt and present his shoulders to the\nblows which he meant to give him with his own hand: then, when he\nperceived that he was angry, he stopped the hand which he had raised\nin the air, and stood like one in act to strike. Being asked by a\nfriend who happened to come in, what he was doing, he answered: \u201cI\nam making an angry man expiate his crime.\u201d He retained the posture\nof one about to give way to passion, as if struck with astonishment\nat its being so degrading to a philosopher, forgetting the slave,\nbecause he had found another still more deserving of punishment.\nHe therefore denied himself the exercise of authority over his own\nhousehold, and once, being rather angry at some fault, said,\n\u201cSpeusippus, will you please to correct that slave with stripes;\nfor I am in a rage.\u201d He would not strike him, for the very reason\nfor which another man would have struck him. \u201cI am in a rage,\u201d said\n{130} he; \u201cI should beat him more than I ought: I should take more\npleasure than I ought in doing so: let not that slave fall into the\npower of one who is not in his own power.\u201d Can any one wish to grant\nthe power of revenge to an angry man, when Plato himself gave up\nhis own right to exercise it? While you are angry, you ought not\nto be allowed to do anything. \u201cWhy?\u201d do you ask? Because when you\nare angry there is nothing that you do not wish to be allowed to\ndo.\nXIII. Fight hard with yourself and if you cannot conquer anger, do\nnot let it conquer you: you have begun to get the better of it if\nit does not show itself, if it is not given vent. Let us conceal\nits symptoms, and as far as possible keep it secret and hidden. It\nwill give us great trouble to do this, for it is eager to burst\nforth, to kindle our eyes and to transform our face; but if we allow\nit to show itself in our outward appearance, it is our master. Let\nit rather be locked in the innermost recesses of our breast, and\nbe borne by us, not bear us: nay, let us replace all its symptoms\nby their opposites; let us make our countenance more composed than\nusual, our voice milder, our step slower. Our inward thoughts\ngradually become influenced by our outward demeanour. With Socrates\nit was a sign of anger when he lowered his voice, and became sparing\nof speech; it was evident at such times that he was exercising\nrestraint over himself. His friends, consequently, used to detect\nhim acting thus, and convict him of being angry; nor was he displeased\nat being charged with concealment of anger; indeed, how could he\nhelp being glad that many men should perceive his anger, yet that\nnone should feel it? they would however, have felt it had not he\ngranted to his friends the same right of criticizing his own conduct\nwhich he himself assumed over theirs. How much more needful is it\nfor us to do this? let us beg all our best friends to give us their\nopinion with the greatest freedom at the very time when we can bear\nit least, and never to be compliant with us {131} when we are angry.\nWhile we are in our right senses, while we are under our own control,\nlet us call for help against so powerful an evil, and one which we\nregard with such unjust favour. Those who cannot carry their wine\ndiscreetly, and fear to be betrayed into some rash and insolent\nact, give their slaves orders to take them away from the banquet\nwhen they are drunk; those who know by experience how unreasonable\nthey are when sick give orders that no one is to obey them when\nthey are in ill health. It is best to prepare obstacles beforehand\nfor vices which are known, and above all things so to tranquilize\nour mind that it may bear the most sudden and violent shocks either\nwithout feeling anger, or, if anger be provoked by the extent of\nsome unexpected wrong, that it may bury it deep, and not betray its\nwound. That it is possible to do this will be seen, if I quote a\nfew of an abundance of examples, from which we may learn both how\nmuch evil there is in anger, when it exercises entire dominion over\nmen in supreme power, and how completely it can control itself when\noverawed by fear.\nXIV. King Cambyses[2] was excessively addicted to wine. Praexaspes\nwas the only one of his closest friends who advised him to drink\nmore sparingly, pointing out how shameful a thing drunkenness was\nin a king, upon whom all eyes and ears were fixed. Cambyses answered,\n\u201cThat you may know that I never lose command of myself, I will\npresently prove to you that both my eyes and my hands are fit for\nservice after I have been drinking.\u201d Hereupon he drank more freely\nthan usual, using larger cups, and when heavy and besotted with\nwine ordered his reprover\u2019s son to go beyond the threshold and stand\nthere with his left hand raised above his head; then he bent his\nbow and pierced the youth\u2019s heart, at which he had said that he\naimed. He {132} then had his breast cut open, showed the arrow\nsticking exactly into the heart, and, looking at the boy\u2019s father,\nasked whether his hand was not steady enough. He replied, that\nApollo himself could not have taken better aim. God confound such\na man, a slave in mind, if not in station! He actually praised an\nact which he ought not to have endured to witness. He thought that\nthe breast of his son being torn assunder, and his heart quivering\nwith its wound, gave him an opportunity of making a complimentary\nspeech. He ought to have raised a dispute with him about his success,\nand have called for another shot, that the king might be pleased\nto prove upon the person of the father that his hand was even\nsteadier than when he shot the son. What a savage king! what a\nworthy mark for all his follower\u2019s arrows! Yet though we curse him\nfor making his banquet end in cruelty and death, still it was worse\nto praise that arrow-shot than to shoot it. We shall see hereafter\nhow a father ought to bear himself when standing over the corpse\nof his son, whose murder he had both caused and witnessed: the\nmatter which we are now discussing, has been proved, I mean, that\nanger can be suppressed. He did not curse the king, he did not so\nmuch as let fall a single inauspicious word, though he felt his own\nheart as deeply wounded as that of his son. He may be said to have\ndone well in choking down his words; for though he might have spoken\nas an angry man, yet he could not have expressed what he felt as a\nfather. He may, I repeat, be thought to have behaved with greater\nwisdom on that occasion than when he tried to regulate the drink\nof one who was better employed in drinking wine than in drinking\nblood, and who granted men peace while his hands were busy with the\nwinecup. He, therefore, added one more to the number of those who\nhave shown to their bitter cost how little kings care for their\nfriends\u2019 good advice.\n{133}\nXV. I have no doubt that Harpagus must have given some such advice\nto the king of the Persians and of himself, in anger at which the\nking placed Harpagus\u2019s own children before him on the dinner-table\nfor him to eat, and asked him from time to time, whether he liked\nthe seasoning. Then, when he saw that he was satiated with his own\nmisery, he ordered their heads to be brought to him, and asked him\nhow he liked his entertainment. The wretched man did not lose his\nreadiness of speech; his face did not change. \u201cEvery kind of dinner,\u201d\nsaid he, \u201cis pleasant at the king\u2019s table.\u201d What did he gain by\nthis obsequiousness? He avoided being invited a second time to\ndinner, to eat what was left of them. I do not forbid a father to\nblame the act of his king, or to seek for some revenge worthy of\nso bloodthirsty a monster, but in the meanwhile I gather from the\ntale this fact, that even the anger which arises from unheard of\noutrages can be concealed, and forced into using language which is\nthe very reverse of its meaning. This way of curbing anger is\nnecessary, at least for those who have chosen this sort of life and\nwho are admitted to dine at a king\u2019s table; this is how they must\neat and drink, this is how they must answer, and how they must laugh\nat their own deaths. Whether life is worth having at such a price,\nwe shall see hereafter; that is another question. Let us not console\nso sorry a crew, or encourage them to submit to the orders of their\nbutchers; let us point out that however slavish a man\u2019s condition\nmay be, there is always a path to liberty open to him, unless his\nmind be diseased. It is a man\u2019s own fault if he suffers, when by\nputting an end to himself he can put an end to his misery. To him\nwhose king aimed arrows at the breasts of his friends, and to him\nwhose master gorged fathers with the hearts of their children, I\nwould say \u201cMadman, why do you groan? for what are you waiting? for\nsome enemy to avenge you by the destruction of your {134} entire\nnation, or for some powerful king to arrive from a distant land?\nWherever you turn your eyes you may see an end to your woes. Do you\nsee that precipice? down that lies the road to liberty; do you see\nthat sea? that river? that well? Liberty sits at the bottom of them.\nDo you see that tree? stunted, blighted, dried up though it be, yet\nliberty hangs from its branches. Do you see your own throat, your\nown neck, your own heart? they are so many ways of escape from\nslavery. Are these modes which I point out too laborious, and needing\nmuch strength and courage? do you ask what path leads to liberty?\nI answer, any vein[3] in your body.\nXVI. As long, however, as we find nothing in our life so unbearable\nas to drive us to suicide, let us, in whatever position we may be,\nset anger far from us: it is destructive to those who are its slaves.\nAll its rage turns to its own misery, and authority becomes all the\nmore irksome the more obstinately it is resisted. It is like a wild\nanimal whose struggles only pull the noose by which it is caught\ntighter; or like birds who, while flurriedly trying to shake\nthemselves free, smear birdlime on to all their feathers. No yoke\nis so grievous as not to hurt him who struggles against it more\nthan him who yields to it: the only way to alleviate great evils\nis to endure them and to submit to do what they compel. This control\nof our passions, and especially of this mad and unbridled passion\nof anger, is useful to subjects, but still more useful to kings.\nAll is lost when a man\u2019s position enables him to carry out whatever\nanger prompts him to do; nor can power long endure if it be exercised\nto the injury of many, for it becomes endangered as soon as common\nfear draws together those who bewail themselves separately. Many\nkings, therefore, have fallen victims, some to single individuals,\nothers to entire peoples, {135} who have been forced by general\nindignation to make one man the minister of their wrath. Yet many\nkings have indulged their anger as though it were a privilege of\nroyalty, like Darius, who, after the dethronement of the Magian,\nwas the first ruler of the Persians and of the greater part of the\nEast: for when he declared war[4] against the Scythians who bordered\non the empire of the East, Oeobazus, an aged noble, begged that one\nof his three sons might be left at home to comfort his father, and\nthat the king might be satisfied with the services of two of them.\nDarius promised him more than he asked for, saying that he would\nallow all three to remain at home, and flung their dead bodies\nbefore their father\u2019s eyes. He would have been harsh, had he taken\nthem all to the war with him. How much more good-natured was\nXerxes,[5] who, when Pythias, the father of five sons, begged for\none to be excused from service, permitted him to choose which he\nwished for. He then tore the son whom the father had chosen into\ntwo halves, placed one on each side of the road, and, as it were,\npurified his army by means of this propitiatory victim. He therefore\nhad the end which he deserved, being defeated, and his army scattered\nfar and wide in utter rout, while he in the midst of it walked among\nthe corpses of his soldiers, seeing on all sides the signs of his\nown overthrow.\nXVII. So ferocious in their anger were those kings who had no\nlearning, no tincture of polite literature: now I will show you\nKing Alexander (the Great), fresh from the lap of Aristotle, who\nwith his own hand while at table stabbed Clitus, his dearest friend,\nwho had been brought up with him, because he did not flatter him\nenough, and was too slow in transforming himself from a free man\nand a Macedonian into a Persian slave. Indeed he shut up {136}\nLysimachus,[6] who was no less his friend than Clitus, in a cage\nwith a lion; yet did this make Lysimachus, who escaped by some happy\nchance from the lion\u2019s teeth, any gentler when he became a king?\nWhy, he mutilated his own friend, Telesphorus the Rhodian, cutting\noff his nose and ears, and kept him for a long while in a den, like\nsome new and strange animal, after the hideousness of his hacked\nand disfigured face had made him no longer appear to be human,\nassisted by starvation and the squalid filth of a body left to\nwallow in its own dung! Besides this, his hands and knees, which\nthe narrowness of his abode forced him to use instead of his feet,\nbecame hard and callous, while his sides were covered with sores\nby rubbing against the walls, so that his appearance was no less\nshocking than frightful, and his punishment turned him into so\nmonstrous a creature that he was not even pitied. Yet, however\nunlike a man he was who suffered this, even more unlike was he who\ninflicted it.\nXVIII. Would to heaven that such savagery had contented itself with\nforeign examples, and that barbarity in anger and punishment had\nnot been imported with other outlandish vices into our Roman manners!\nMarcus Marius, to whom the people erected a statue in every street,\nto whom they made offerings of incense and wine, had, by the command\nof Lucius Sulla, his legs broken, his eyes pulled out, his hands\ncut off, and his whole body gradually torn to pieces limb by limb,\nas if Sulla killed him as many times as he wounded him. Who was it\nwho carried out Sulla\u2019s orders? who but Catiline, already practising\nhis hands in every sort of wickedness? He tore him to pieces before\nthe tomb of Quintus Catulus, an unwelcome burden to the ashes of\nthat gentlest of men, above which one who was no doubt a criminal,\nyet nevertheless {137} the idol of the people, and who was not\nundeserving of love, although men loved him beyond all reason, was\nforced to shed his blood drop by drop. Though Marius deserved such\ntortures, yet it was worthy of Sulla to order them, and of Catiline\nto execute them; but it was unworthy of the State to be stabbed by\nthe swords of her enemy and her avenger alike. Why do I pry into\nancient history? quite lately Gaius Caesar flogged and tortured\nSextus Papinius, whose father was a consular, Betilienus Bassus,\nhis own quaestor, and several others, both senators and knights,\non the same day, not to carry out any judicial inquiry, but merely\nto amuse himself. Indeed, so impatient was he of any delay in\nreceiving the pleasure which his monstrous cruelty never delayed\nin asking, that when walking with some ladies and senators in his\nmother\u2019s gardens, along the walk between the colonnade and the\nriver, he struck off some of their heads by lamplight. What did he\nfear? what public or private danger could one night threaten him\nwith? how very small a favour it would have been to wait until\nmorning, and not to kill the Roman people\u2019s senators in his slippers?\nXIX. It is to the purpose that we should know how haughtily his\ncruelty was exercised, although some one might suppose that we are\nwandering from the subject and embarking on a digression; but this\ndigression is itself connected with unusual outbursts of anger. He\nbeat senators with rods; he did it so often that he made men able\nto say, \u201cIt is the custom.\u201d He tortured them with all the most\ndismal engines in the world, with the cord, the boots, the rack,\nthe fire, and the sight of his own face. Even to this we may answer,\n\u201cTo tear three senators to pieces with stripes and fire like criminal\nslaves was no such great crime for one who had thoughts of butchering\nthe entire Senate, who was wont to wish that the Roman people had\nbut one neck, that he might concentrate {138} into one day and one\nblow all the wickedness which he divided among so many places and\ntimes. Was there ever anything so unheard-of as an execution in the\nnight-time? Highway robbery seeks for the shelter of darkness, but\nthe more public an execution is, the more power it has as an example\nand lesson. Here I shall be met by: \u201cThis, which you are so surprised\nat, was the daily habit of that monster; this was what he lived\nfor, watched for, sat up at night for.\u201d Certainly one could find\nno one else who would have ordered all those whom he condemned to\ndeath to have their mouths closed by a sponge being fastened in\nthem, that they might not have the power even of uttering a sound.\nWhat dying man was ever forbidden to groan? He feared that the last\nagony might find too free a voice, that he might hear what would\ndisplease him. He knew, moreover, that there were countless crimes,\nwith which none but a dying man would dare to reproach him. When\nsponges were not forthcoming, he ordered the wretched men\u2019s clothes\nto be torn up, and the rags stuffed into their mouths. What savagery\nwas this? Let a man draw his last breath: give room for his soul\nto escape through: let it not be forced to leave the body through\na wound. It becomes tedious to add to this that in the same night\nhe sent centurions to the houses of the executed men and made an\nend of their fathers also, that is to say, being a compassionate-minded\nman, he set them free from sorrow: for it is not my intention to\ndescribe the ferocity of Gaius, but the ferocity of anger, which\ndoes not merely vent its rage upon individuals, but rends in pieces\nwhole nations, and even lashes cities, rivers, and things which\nhave no sense of pain.\nXX. Thus, the king of the Persians cut off the noses of a whole\nnation in Syria, wherefore the place is called Rhinocolura. Do you\nthink that he was merciful, because he did not cut their heads off\naltogether? no, he was delighted at {139} having invented a new\nkind of punishment. Something of the same kind would have befallen\nthe Aethiopians,[7] who on account of their prodigiously long lives\nare called Macrobiotae; for, because they did not receive slavery\nwith hands uplifted to heaven in thankfulness, and sent an embassy\nwhich used independent, or what kings call insulting language,\nCambyses became wild with rage, and, without any store of provisions,\nor any knowledge of the roads, started with all his fighting men\nthrough an arid and trackless waste, where during the first day\u2019s\nmarch the necessaries of life failed, and the country itself furnished\nnothing, being barren and uncultivated, and untrodden by the foot\nof man. At first the tenderest parts of leaves and shoots of trees\nrelieved their hunger, then hides softened by fire, and anything\nelse that their extremity drove them to use as food. When as they\nproceeded neither roots nor herbs were to be found in the sand, and\nthey found a wilderness destitute even of animal life, they chose\neach tenth man by lot and made of him a meal which was more cruel\nthan hunger. Rage still drove the king madly forwards, until after\nhe had lost one part of his army and eaten another he began to fear\nthat he also might be called upon to draw the lot for his life;\nthen at last he gave the order for retreat. Yet all the while his\nwell-bred hawks were not sacrificed, and the means of feasting were\ncarried for him on camels, while his soldiers were drawing lots for\nwho should miserably perish, and who should yet more miserably live.\nXXI. This man was angry with an unknown and inoffensive nation,\nwhich nevertheless was able to feel his wrath; but Cyrus[8] was\nangry with a river. When hurrying to besiege Babylon, since in\nmaking war it is above all things important to seize one\u2019s opportunity,\nhe tried to ford the wide-spread river Gyndes, which it is hardly\nsafe to {140} attempt even when the river has been dried up by the\nsummer heat and is at its lowest. Here one of the white horses which\ndrew the royal chariot was washed away, and his loss moved the king\nto such violent rage, that he swore to reduce the river which had\ncarried off his royal retinue to so low an ebb that even women\nshould walk across it and trample upon it. He thereupon devoted all\nthe resources of his army to this object, and remained working until\nby cutting one hundred and eighty channels across the bed of the\nriver he divided it into three hundred and sixty brooks, and left\nthe bed dry, the waters flowing through other channels. Thus he\nlost time, which is very important in great operations, and lost,\nalso, the soldiers\u2019 courage, which was broken by useless labour,\nand the opportunity of falling upon his enemy unprepared, while he\nwas waging against the river the war which he had declared against\nhis foes. This frenzy, for what else can you call it, has befallen\nRomans also, for G. Caesar destroyed a most beautiful villa at\nHerculaneum because his mother was once imprisoned in it, and has\nthus made the place notorious by its misfortune; for while it stood,\nwe used to sail past it without noticing it, but now people inquire\nwhy it is in ruins.\nXXII. These should be regarded as examples to be avoided, and what\nI am about to relate, on the contrary, to be followed, being examples\nof gentle and lenient conduct in men who both had reasons for anger\nand power to avenge themselves. What could have been easier than\nfor Antigonus to order those two common soldiers to be executed who\nleaned against their king\u2019s tent while doing what all men especially\nlove to do, and run the greatest danger by doing, I mean while they\nspoke evil of their king. Antigonus heard all they said, as was\nlikely, since there was only a piece of cloth between the speakers\nand the listener, who gently raised it, and said \u201cGo a little {141}\nfurther off, for fear the king should hear you.\u201d He also on one\nnight, hearing some of his soldiers invoking everything that was\nevil upon their king for having brought them along that road and\ninto that impassable mud, went to those who were in the greatest\ndifficulties, and having extricated them without their knowing who\nwas their helper, said, \u201cNow curse Antigonus, by whose fault you\nhave fallen into this trouble, but bless the man who has brought\nyou out of this slough.\u201d This same Antigonus bore the abuse of his\nenemies as good-naturedly as that of his countrymen; thus when he\nwas besieging some Greeks in a little fort, and they, despising\ntheir enemy through their confidence in the strength of their\nposition, cut many jokes upon the ugliness of Antigonus, at one\ntime mocking him for his shortness of stature, at another for his\nbroken nose, he answered, \u201cI rejoice, and expect some good fortune\nbecause I have a Silenus in my camp.\u201d After he had conquered these\nwitty folk by hunger, his treatment of them was to form regiments\nof those who were fit for service, and sell the rest by public\nauction; nor would he, said he, have done this had it not been\nbetter that men who had such evil tongues should be under the control\nof a master.\nXXIII. This man\u2019s grandson[9] was Alexander, who used to hurl his\nlance at his guests, who, of the two friends which I have mentioned\nabove, exposed one to the rage of a wild beast, and the other to\nhis own; yet of these two men, he who was exposed to the lion\nsurvived. He did not derive this vice from his grandfather, nor\neven from his father; for it was an especial virtue of Philip\u2019s to\nendure insults patiently, and was a great safeguard of his kingdom.\nDemochares, who was surnamed Parrhesiastes on account of his unbridled\nand impudent tongue, came on an embassy to him with other ambassadors\nfrom Athens. After graciously {142} listening to what they had to\nsay, Philip said to them, \u201cTell me, what can I do that will please\nthe Athenians? \u201cDemochares took him up, and answered, \u201cHang yourself.\u201d\nAll the bystanders expressed their indignation at so brutal an\nanswer, but Philip bade them be silent, and let this Thersites\ndepart safe and sound. \u201cBut do you,\u201d said he, \u201cyou other ambassadors,\ntell the Athenians that those who say such things are much more\narrogant than those who hear them without revenging themselves.\u201d\nThe late Emperor Augustus also did and said many memorable things,\nwhich prove that he was not under the dominion of anger. Timagenes,\nthe historical writer, made some remarks upon him, his wife, and\nhis whole family: nor did his jests fall to the ground, for nothing\nspreads more widely or is more in people\u2019s mouths than reckless\nwit. Caesar often warned him to be less audacious in his talk, and\nas he continued to offend, forbade him his house. Timagenes after\nthis passed the later years of his life as the guest of Asinius\nPollio, and was the favourite of the whole city: the closing of\nCaesar\u2019s door did not close any other door against him. He read\naloud the history which he wrote after this, but burned the books\nwhich contained the doings of Augustus Caesar. He was at enmity\nwith Caesar, but yet no one feared to be his friend, no one shrank\nfrom him as though he were blasted by lightning: although he fell\nfrom so high a place, yet some one was found to catch him in his\nlap. Caesar, I say, bore this with patience, and was not even\nirritated by the historian\u2019s having laid violent hands upon his own\nglories and acts: he never complained of the man who afforded his\nenemy shelter, but merely said to Asinius Pollio \u201cYou are keeping\na wild beast:\u201d then, when the other would have excused his conduct,\nhe stopped him, and said \u201cEnjoy, my Pollio, enjoy his friendship.\u201d\nWhen Pollio said, \u201cIf you order me, Caesar, I will straightway\nforbid him my house,\u201d he {143} answered, \u201cDo you think that I am\nlikely to do this, after having made you friends again?\u201d for formerly\nPollio had been angry with Timagenes, and ceased to be angry with\nhim for no other reason than that Caesar began to be so.\nXXIV. Let every one, then, say to himself, whenever he is provoked,\n\u201cAm I more powerful than Philip? yet he allowed a man to curse him\nwith impunity. Have I more authority in my own house than the Emperor\nAugustus possessed throughout the world? yet he was satisfied with\nleaving the society of his maligner. Why should I make my slave\natone by stripes and manacles for having answered me too loudly or\nhaving put on a stubborn look, or muttered something which I did\nnot catch? Who am I, that it should be a crime to shock my ears?\nMany men have forgiven their enemies: shall I not forgive men for\nbeing lazy, careless, and gossipping?\u201d We ought to plead age as an\nexcuse for children, sex for women, freedom for a stranger, familiarity\nfor a house-servant. Is this his first offence? think how long he\nhas been acceptable. Has he often done wrong, and in many other\ncases? then let us continue to bear what we have borne so long. Is\nhe a friend? then he did not intend to do it. Is he an enemy? then\nin doing it he did his duty. If he be a sensible man, let us believe\nhis excuses; if a fool, let us grant him pardon; whatever he may\nbe, let us say to ourselves on his behalf, that even the wisest of\nmen are often in fault, that no one is so alert that his carefulness\nnever betrays itself, that no one is of so ripe a judgment that his\nserious mind cannot be goaded by circumstances into some hotheaded\naction, that, in fine, no one, however much he may fear to give\noffence, can help doing so even while he tries to avoid it.\nXXV. As it is a consolation to a humble man in trouble that the\ngreatest are subject to reverses of fortune, and a man weeps more\ncalmly over his dead son in the corner of {144} his hovel if he\nsees a piteous[10] funeral proceed out of the palace as well; so\none bears injury or insult more calmly if one remembers that no\npower is so great as to be above the reach of harm. Indeed, if even\nthe wisest do wrong, who cannot plead a good excuse for his faults?\nLet us look back upon our own youth, and think how often we then\nwere too slothful in our duty, too impudent in our speech, too\nintemperate in our cups. Is anyone angry? then let us give him\nenough time to reflect upon what he has done, and he will correct\nhis own self. But suppose he ought to pay the penalty of his deeds:\nwell, that is no reason why we should act as he does. It canot be\ndoubted that he who regards his tormentor with contempt raises\nhimself above the common herd and looks down upon them from a loftier\nposition: it is the property of true magnanimity not to feel the\nblows which it may receive. So does a huge wild beast turn slowly\nand gaze at yelping curs: so does the wave dash in vain against a\ngreat cliff. The man who is not angry remains unshaken by injury:\nhe who is angry has been moved by it. He, however, whom I have\ndescribed as being placed too high for any mischief to reach him,\nholds as it were the highest good in his arms: he can reply, not\nonly to any man, but to fortune herself: \u201cDo what you will, you are\ntoo feeble to disturb my serenity: this is forbidden by reason, to\nwhom I have entrusted the guidance of my life: to become angry would\ndo me more harm than your violence can do me. \u2018More harm?\u2019 say you.\nYes, certainly: I know how much injury you have done me, but I\ncannot tell to what excesses anger might not carry me.\u201d\nXXVI. You say, \u201cI cannot endure it: injuries are hard to bear.\u201d You\nlie; for how can any one not be able to bear injury, if he can bear\nto be angry? Besides, what you {145} intend to do is to endure both\ninjury and anger. Why do you bear with the delirium of a sick man,\nor the ravings of a madman, or the impudent blows of a child?\nBecause, of course, they evidently do not know what they are doing:\nif a man be not responsible for his actions, what does it matter\nby what malady he became so: the plea of ignorance holds equally\ngood in every case. \u201cWhat then?\u201d say you, \u201cshall he not be punished?\u201d\nHe will be, even supposing that you do not wish it: for the greatest\npunishment for having done harm is the sense of having done it, and\nno one is more severely punished than he who is given over to the\npunishment of remorse. In the next place, we ought to consider the\nwhole state of mankind, in order to pass a just judgment on all the\noccurrences of life: for it is unjust to blame individuals for a\nvice which is common to all. The colour of an Aethiop is not\nremarkable amongst his own people, nor is any man in Germany ashamed\nof red hair rolled into a knot. You cannot call anything peculiar\nor disgraceful in a particular man if it is the general characteristic\nof his nation. Now, the cases which I have quoted are defended only\nby the usage of one out-of-the-way quarter of the world: see now,\nhow far more deserving of pardon those crimes are which are spread\nabroad among all mankind. We all are hasty and careless, we all are\nuntrustworthy, dissatisfied, and ambitious: nay, why do I try to\nhide our common wickedness by a too partial description? we all are\nbad. Every one of us therefore will find in his own breast the vice\nwhich he blames in another. Why do you remark how pale this man,\nor how lean that man is? there is a general pestilence. Let us\ntherefore be more gentle one to another: we are bad men, living\namong bad men: there is only one thing which can afford us peace,\nand that is to agree to forgive one another. \u201cThis man has already\ninjured me,\u201d say you, \u201cand I have not yet injured him.\u201d No, but you\nhave probably injured some one else, and you will injure {146} him\nsome day. Do not form your judgment by one hour, or one day: consider\nthe whole tendency of your mind: even though you have done no evil,\nyet you are capable of doing it.\nXXVII. How far better is it to heal an injury than to avenge it?\nRevenge takes up much time, and throws itself in the way of many\ninjuries while it is smarting under one. We all retain our anger\nlonger than we feel our hurt: how far better it were to take the\nopposite course and not meet one mischief by another. Would any one\nthink himself to be in his perfect mind if he were to return kicks\nto a mule or bites to a dog?\u201d These creatures,\u201d you say, \u201cknow not\nthat they are doing wrong.\u201d Then, in the first place, what an unjust\njudge you must be if a man has less chance of gaining your forgiveness\nthan a beast! Secondly, if animals are protected from your anger\nby their want of reason, you ought to treat all foolish men in the\nlike manner: for if a man has that mental darkness which excuses\nall the wrong-doings of dumb animals, what difference does it make\nif in other respects he be unlike a dumb animal? He has sinned.\nWell, is this the first time, or will this be the last time? Why,\nyou should not believe him even if he said, \u201cNever will I do so\nagain.\u201d He will sin, and another will sin against him, and all his\nlife he will wallow in wickedness. Savagery must be met by kindness:\nwe ought to use, to a man in anger, the argument which is so effective\nwith one in grief, that is, \u201cShall you leave off this at some time,\nor never? If you will do so at some time, how better is it that you\nshould abandon anger than that anger should abandon you? Or, will\nthis excitement never leave you? Do you see to what an unquiet life\nyou condemn yourself? for what will be the life of one who is always\nswelling with rage?\u201d Add to this, that after you have worked yourself\nup into a rage, and have from time to time renewed the causes of\nyour {147} excitement, yet your anger will depart from you of its\nown accord, and time will sap its strength: how much better then\nis it that it should be overcome by you than by itself?\nXXVIII. If you are angry, you will quarrel first with this man, and\nthen with that: first with slaves, then with freedmen: first with\nparents, then with children: first with acquaintances, then with\nstrangers: for there are grounds for anger in every case, unless\nyour mind steps in and intercedes with you: your frenzy will drag\nyou from one place to another, and from thence to elsewhere, your\nmadness will constantly meet with newly-occurring irritants, and\nwill never depart from you. Tell me, miserable man, what time you\nwill have for loving? O, what good time you are wasting on an evil\nthing! How much better it would be to win friends, and disarm\nenemies: to serve the state, or to busy oneself with one\u2019s private\naffairs, rather than to cast about for what harm you can do to\nsomebody, what wound you can inflict either upon his social position,\nhis fortune, or his person, although you cannot succeed in doing\nso without a struggle and risk to yourself, even if your antagonist\nbe inferior to you. Even supposing that he were handed over to you\nin chains, and that you were at liberty to torture him as much as\nyou please, yet even then excessive violence in striking a blow\noften causes us to dislocate a joint, or entangles a sinew in the\nteeth which it has broken. Anger makes many men cripples, or invalids,\neven when it meets with an unresisting victim: and besides this,\nno creature is so weak that it can be destroyed without any danger\nto its destroyer: sometimes grief, sometimes chance, puts the weakest\non a level with the strongest. What shall we say of the fact that\nthe greater part of the things which enrage us are insults, not\ninjuries? It makes a great difference whether a man thwarts my\nwishes or merely fails to carry them out, whether he robs me or\ndoes not give me anything: yet we count it all the same whether a\n{148} man takes anything from us or refuses to give anything to us,\nwhether he extinguishes our hope or defers it, whether his object\nbe to hinder us or to help himself, whether he acts out of love for\nsome one or out of hatred for us. Some men are bound to oppose us\nnot only on the ground of justice, but of honour: one is defending\nhis father, another his brother, another his country, another his\nfriend: yet we do not forgive men for doing what we should blame\nthem for not doing; nay, though one can hardly believe it, we often\nthink well of an act, and ill of the man who did it. But, by Hercules,\na great and just man looks with respect at the bravest of his\nenemies, and the most obstinate defender of his freedom and his\ncountry, and wishes that he had such a man for his own countryman\nand soldier.\nXXIX. It is shameful to hate him whom you praise: but how much more\nshameful is it to hate a man for something for which he deserves\nto be pitied? If a prisoner of war, who has suddenly been reduced\nto the condition of a slave, still retains some remnants of liberty,\nand does not run nimbly to perform foul and toilsome tasks, if,\nhaving grown slothful by long rest, he cannot run fast enough to\nkeep pace with his master\u2019s horse or carriage, if sleep overpowers\nhim when weary with many days and nights of watching, if he refuses\nto undertake farm work, or does not do it heartily when brought\naway from the idleness of city service and put to hard labour, we\nought to make a distinction between whether a man cannot or will\nnot do it: we should pardon many slaves, if we began to judge them\nbefore we began to be angry with them: as it is, however, we obey\nour first impulse, and then, although we may prove to have been\nexcited about mere trifles, yet we continue to be angry, lest we\nshould seem to have begun to be angry without cause; and, most\nunjust of all, the injustice of our anger makes us persist in it\nall the more; for we {149} nurse it and inflame it, as though to\nbe violently angry proved our anger to be just.\nXXX. How much better is it to observe how trifling, how inoffensive\nare the first beginnings of anger? You will see that men are subject\nto the same influences as dumb animals: we are put out by trumpery,\nfutile matters. Bulls are excited by red colour, the asp raises its\nhead at a shadow, bears or lions are irritated at the shaking of a\nrag, and all creatures who are naturally fierce and wild are alarmed\nat trifles. The same thing befalls men both of restless and of\nsluggish disposition; they are seized by suspicions, sometimes to\nsuch an extent that they call slight benefits injuries: and these\nform the most common and certainly the most bitter subject for\nanger: for we become angry with our dearest friends for having\nbestowed less upon us than we expected, and less than others have\nreceived from them: yet there is a remedy at hand for both these\ngrievances. Has he favoured our rival more than ourselves? then let\nus enjoy what we have without making any comparisons. A man will\nnever be well off to whom it is a torture to see any one better off\nthan himself. Have I less than I hoped for? well, perhaps I hoped\nfor more than I ought. This it is against which we ought to be\nespecially on our guard: from hence arises the most destructive\nanger, sparing nothing, not even the holiest. The Emperor Julius\nwas not stabbed by so many enemies as by friends whose insatiable\nhopes he had not satisfied. He was willing enough to do so, for no\none ever made a more generous use of victory, of whose fruits he\nkept nothing for himself save the power of distributing them; but\nhow could he glut such unconscionable appetites, when each man\ncoveted as much as any one man could possess? This was why he saw\nhis fellow-soldiers standing round his chair with drawn swords,\nTillius Cimber, though he had a short time before been the keenest\ndefender of his party, {150} and others who only became Pompeians\nafter Pompeius was dead. This it is which has turned the arms of\nkings against them, and made their trustiest followers meditate the\ndeath of him for whom and before whom[11] they once would have been\nglad to die.\nXXXI. No man is satisfied with his own lot if he fixes his attention\non that of another: and this leads to our being angry even with the\ngods, because somebody precedes us, though we forget of how many\nwe take precedence, and that when a man envies few people, he must\nbe followed in the background by a huge crowd of people who envy\nhim. Yet so churlish is human nature, that, however much men may\nhave received, they think themselves wronged if they are able to\nreceive still more. \u201cHe gave me the praetorship. Yes, but I had\nhoped for the consulship. He bestowed the twelve axes upon me: true,\nbut he did not make me a regular[12] consul. He allowed me to give\nmy name to the year, but he did not help me to the priesthood. I\nhave been elected a member of the college: but why only of one? He\nhas bestowed upon me every honour that the state affords: yes, but\nhe has added nothing to my private fortune. What he gave me he was\nobliged to give to somebody: he brought out nothing from his own\npocket.\u201d Rather than speak thus, thank him for what you have received:\nwait for the rest, and be thankful that you are not yet too full\nto contain more: there is a pleasure in having something left to\nhope for. Are you preferred to every one? then rejoice at holding\nthe first place in the thoughts of your friend. Or are many others\npreferred before you? then think how many more are below you than\nthere are {151} above you. Do you ask, what is your greatest fault?\nIt is, that you keep your accounts wrongly: you set a high value\nupon what you give, and a low one upon what you receive.\nXXXII. Let different qualities in different people keep us from\nquarrelling with them: let us fear to be angry with some, feel\nashamed of being angry with others, and disdain to be angry with\nothers. We do a fine thing, indeed, when we send a wretched slave\nto the workhouse! Why are we in such a hurry to flog him at once,\nto break his legs straightway? we shall not lose our boasted power\nif we defer its exercise. Let us wait for the time when we ourselves\ncan give orders: at present we speak under constraint from anger.\nWhen it has passed away we shall see what amount of damage has been\ndone; for this is what we are especially liable to make mistakes\nabout: we use the sword, and capital punishment, and we appoint\nchains, imprisonment, and starvation to punish a crime which deserves\nonly flogging with a light scourge. \u201cIn what way,\u201d say you, \u201cdo you\nbid us look at those things by which we think ourselves injured,\nthat we may see how paltry, pitiful, and childish they are?\u201d Of all\nthings I would charge you to take to yourself a magnanimous spirit,\nand behold how low and sordid all these matters are about which we\nsquabble and run to and fro till we are out of breath; to any one\nwho entertains any lofty and magnificent ideas, they are not worthy\nof a thought.\nXXXIII. The greatest hullabaloo is about money: this it is which\nwearies out the law-courts, sows strife between father and son,\nconcocts poisons, and gives swords to murderers just as to soldiers:\nit is stained with our blood: on account of it husbands and wives\nwrangle all night long, crowds press round the bench of magistrates,\nkings rage and plunder, and overthrow communities which it has taken\nthe labour of centuries to build, that they may seek for gold and\n{152} silver in the ashes of their cities. Do you like to look at\nyour money-bags lying in the corner? it is for these that men shout\ntill their eyes start from their heads, that the law-courts ring\nwith the din of trials, and that jurymen brought from great distances\nsit to decide which man\u2019s covetousness is the more equitable. What\nshall we say if it be not even for a bag of money, but for a handful\nof coppers or a shilling scored up by a slave that some old man,\nsoon to die without an heir, bursts with rage? what if it be an\ninvalid money-lender whose feet are distorted by the gout, and who\ncan no longer use his hands to count with, who calls for his interest\nof one thousandth a month,[13] and by his sureties demands his pence\neven during the paroxysms of his disease? If you were to bring to\nme all the money from all our mines, which we are at this moment\nsinking, if you were to bring to-night all that is concealed in\nhoards, where avarice returns money to the earth from whence it\ncame, and pity that it ever was dug out\u2014all that mass I should not\nthink worthy to cause a wrinkle on the brow of a good man. What\nridicule those things deserve which bring tears into our eyes!\nXXXIV. Come now, let us enumerate the other causes of anger: they\nare food, drink, and the showy apparatus connected with them, words,\ninsults, disrespectful movements of the body, suspicions, obstinate\ncattle, lazy slaves, and spiteful construction put upon other men\u2019s\nwords, so that even the gift of language to mankind becomes reckoned\namong the wrongs of nature. Believe me, the things which cause us\nsuch great heat are trifles, the sort of things that children fight\nand squabble over: there is nothing serious, nothing important in\nall that we do with such gloomy faces. It is, I repeat, the setting\na great value on trifles that is the cause of your anger and madness.\nThis {153} man wanted to rob me of my inheritance, that one has\nbrought a charge against me before persons[14] whom I had long\ncourted with great expectations, that one has coveted my mistress.\nA wish for the same things, which ought to have been a bond of\nfriendship, becomes a source of quarrels and hatred. A narrow path\ncauses quarrels among those who pass up and down it; a wide and\nbroadly spread road may be used by whole tribes without jostling.\nThose objects of desire of yours cause strife and disputes among\nthose who covet the same things, because they are petty, and cannot\nbe given to one man without being taken away from another.\nXXXV. You are indignant at being answered back by your slave, your\nfreedman, your wife, or your client: and then you complain of the\nstate having lost the freedom which you have destroyed in your own\nhouse: then again if he is silent when you question him, you call\nit sullen obstinacy. Let him both speak and be silent, and laugh\ntoo. \u201cIn the presence of his master?\u201d you ask. Nay, say rather \u201cin\nthe presence of the house-father.\u201d Why do you shout? why do you\nstorm? why do you in the middle of dinner call for a whip, because\nthe slaves are talking, because a crowd as large as a public meeting\nis not as silent as the wilderness? You have ears, not merely that\nyou may listen to musical sounds, softly and sweetly drawn out and\nharmonized: you ought to hear laughter and weeping, coaxing and\nquarrelling, joy and sorrow, the human voice and the roaring and\nbarking of animals. Miserable one! why do you shudder at the noise\nof a slave, at the rattling of brass or the banging of a door? you\ncannot help hearing the thunder, however refined you may be. You\nmay apply these remarks about your ears with equal truth to your\neyes, which are just as dainty, if they have been badly schooled:\nthey are shocked at stains and {154} dirt, at silver plate which\nis not sufficiently bright, or at a pool whose water is not clear\ndown to the bottom. Those same eyes which can only endure to see\nthe most variegated marble, and that which has just been scoured\nbright, which will look at no table whose wood is not marked with\na network of veining, and which at home are loth to tread upon\nanything that is not more precious than gold, will, when out of\ndoors, gaze most calmly upon rough and miry paths, will see unmoved\nthat the greater number of persons that meet them are shabbily\ndressed, and that the walls of the houses are rotten, full of cracks,\nand uneven. What, then, can be the reason that they are not distressed\nout of doors by sights which would shock them in their own home,\nunless it be that their temper is placid and long-suffering in one\ncase, sulky and fault-finding in the other?\nXXXVI. All our senses should be educated into strength: they are\nnaturally able to endure much, provided that the spirit forbears\nto spoil them. The spirit ought to be brought up for examination\ndaily. It was the custom of Sextius when the day was over, and he\nhad betaken himself to rest, to inquire of his spirit: \u201cWhat bad\nhabit of yours have you cured to-day? what vice have you checked?\nin what respect are you better?\u201d Anger will cease, and become more\ngentle, if it knows that every day it will have to appear before\nthe judgment seat. What can be more admirable than this fashion of\ndiscussing the whole of the day\u2019s events? how sweet is the sleep\nwhich follows this self-examination? how calm, how sound, and\ncareless is it when our spirit has either received praise or\nreprimand, and when our secret inquisitor and censor has made his\nreport about our morals? I make use of this privilege, and daily\nplead my cause before myself: when the lamp is taken out of my\nsight, and my wife, who knows my habit, has ceased to talk, I pass\nthe whole day in review before myself, and repeat all that I have\nsaid and done: I conceal nothing {155} from myself, and omit nothing:\nfor why should I be afraid of any of my shortcomings, when it is\nin my power to say, \u201cI pardon you this time: see that you never do\nthat any more? In that dispute you spoke too contentiously: do not\nfor the future argue with ignorant people: those who have never\nbeen taught are unwilling to learn. You reprimanded that man with\nmore freedom than you ought, and consequently you have offended him\ninstead of amending his ways: in dealing with other cases of the\nkind, you should look carefully, not only to the truth of what you\nsay, but also whether the person to whom you speak can bear to be\ntold the truth.\u201d A good man delights in receiving advice: all the\nworst men are the most impatient of guidance.\nXXXVII. At the dinner-table some jokes and sayings intended to give\nyou pain have been directed against you: avoid feasting with low\npeople. Those who are not modest even when sober become much more\nrecklessly impudent after drinking. You have seen your friend in a\nrage with the porter of some lawyer or rich man, because he has\nsent him back when about to enter, and you yourself on behalf of\nyour friend have been in a rage with the meanest of slaves. Would\nyou then be angry with a chained housedog? Why, even he, after a\nlong bout of barking, becomes gentle if you offer him food. So draw\nback and smile; for the moment your porter fancies himself to be\nsomebody, because he guards a door which is beset by a crowd of\nlitigants; for the moment he who sits within is prosperous and\nhappy, and thinks that a street-door through which it is hard to\ngain entrance is the mark of a rich and powerful man; he knows not\nthat the hardest door of all to open is that of the prison. Be\nprepared to submit to much. Is any one surprised at being cold in\nwinter? at being sick at sea? or at being jostled in the street?\nThe mind is strong enough to bear those evils for which it is\nprepared. When {156} you are not given a sufficiently distinguished\nplace at table you have begun to be angry with your fellow-guests,\nwith your host, and with him who is preferred above you. Idiot!\nWhat difference can it make what part of the couch you rest upon?\nCan a cushion give you honour or take it away? You have looked\naskance at somebody because he has spoken slightingly of your\ntalents; will you apply this rule to yourself? If so, Ennius, whose\npoetry you do not care for, would have hated you. Hortensius, if\nyou had found fault with his speeches, would have quarrelled with\nyou, and Cicero, if you had laughed at his poetry, would have been\nyour enemy. A candidate for office, will you resent men\u2019s votes?\nXXXVIII. Some one has offered you an insult? Not a greater one,\nprobably, than was offered to the Stoic philosopher Diogenes, in\nwhose face an insolent young man spat just when he was lecturing\nupon anger. He bore it mildly and wisely. \u201cI am not angry,\u201d said\nhe, \u201cbut I am not sure that I ought not to be angry.\u201d Yet how much\nbetter did our Cato behave? When he was pleading, one Lentulus,\nwhom our fathers remember as a demagogue and passionate man, spat\nall the phlegm he could muster upon his forehead. Cato wiped his\nface, and said, \u201cLentulus, I shall declare to all the world that\nmen are mistaken when they say that you are wanting in cheek.\u201d\nXXXIX. We have now succeeded, my Novatus, in properly regulating\nour own minds: they either do not feel anger or are above it: let\nus next see how we may soothe the wrath of others, for we do not\nonly wish to be whole, but to heal.\nYou should not attempt to allay the first burst of anger by words:\nit is deaf and frantic: we must give it scope; our remedies will\nonly be effective when it slackens. We do not meddle with men\u2019s\neyes when they are swollen, because we should only irritate their\nhard stiffness by {157} touching them, nor do we try to cure other\ndiseases when at their height: the best treatment in the first stage\nof illness is rest. \u201cOf how very little value,\u201d say you, \u201cis your\nremedy, if it appeases anger which is subsiding of its own accord?\u201d\nIn the first place, I answer, it makes it end quicker: in the next,\nit prevents a relapse. It can render harmless even the violent\nimpulse which it dares not soothe: it will put out of the way all\nweapons which might be used for revenge: it will pretend to be\nangry, in order that its advice may have more weight as coming from\nan assistant and comrade in grief. It will invent delays, and\npostpone immediate punishment while a greater one is being sought\nfor: it will use every artifice to give the man a respite from his\nfrenzy. If his anger be unusually strong, it will inspire him with\nsome irresistible feeling of shame or of fear: if weak, it will\nmake use of conversation on amusing or novel subjects, and by playing\nupon his curiosity lead him to forget his passion. We are told that\na physician, who was forced to cure the king\u2019s daughter, and could\nnot without using the knife, conveyed a lancet to her swollen breast\nconcealed under the sponge with which he was fomenting it. The same\ngirl, who would have shrunk from the remedy if he had applied it\nopenly, bore the pain because she did not expect it. Some diseases\ncan only be cured by deceit.\nXL. To one class of men you will say, \u201cBeware, lest your anger give\npleasure to your foes:\u201d to the other, \u201cBeware lest your greatness\nof mind and the reputation it bears among most people for strength\nbecome impaired. I myself, by Hercules, am scandalized at your\ntreatment and am grieved beyond measure, but we must wait for a\nproper opportunity. He shall pay for what he has done; be well\nassured of that: when you are able you shall return it to him with\ninterest.\u201d To reprove a man when he is angry is to add to his anger\nby being angry oneself. You {158} should approach him in different\nways and in a compliant fashion, unless perchance you be so great\na personage that you can quash his anger, as the Emperor Augustus\ndid when he was dining with Vedius Pollio.[15] One of the slaves\nhad broken a crystal goblet of his: Vedius ordered him to be led\naway to die, and that too in no common fashion: he ordered him to\nbe thrown to feed the muraenae, some of which fish, of great size,\nhe kept in a tank. Who would not think that he did this out of\nluxury? but it was out of cruelty. The boy slipped through the hands\nof those who tried to seize him, and flung himself at Caesar\u2019s feet\nin order to beg for nothing more than that he might die in some\ndifferent way, and not be eaten. Caesar was shocked at this novel\nform of cruelty, and ordered him to be let go, and, in his place,\nall the crystal ware which he saw before him to be broken, and the\ntank to be filled up. This was the proper way for Caesar to reprove\nhis friend: he made a good use of his power. What are you, that\nwhen at dinner you order men to be put to death, and mangled by an\nunheard-of form of torture? Are a man\u2019s bowels to be torn asunder\nbecause your cup is broken? You must think a great deal of yourself,\nif even when the emperor is present you order men to be executed.\nXLI. If any one\u2019s power is so great that he can treat anger with\nthe tone of a superior let him crush it out of existence, but only\nif it be of the kind of which I have just spoken, fierce, inhuman,\nbloodthirsty, and incurable save by fear of something more powerful\nthan itself . . . . . . . . let us give the mind that peace which\nis given by constant meditation upon wholesome maxims, by good\nactions, and by a mind directed to the pursuit of honour alone. Let\nus set our own conscience fully at rest, but make no efforts to\ngain credit for ourselves: so long as we {159} deserve well, let\nus be satisfied, even if we should be ill spoken of. \u201cBut the common\nherd admires spirited actions, and bold men are held in honour,\nwhile quiet ones are thought to be indolent.\u201d True, at first sight\nthey may appear to be so: but as soon as the even tenor of their\nlife proves that this quietude arises not from dullness but from\npeace of mind, then that same populace respects and reverences them.\nThere is, then, nothing useful in that hideous and destructive\npassion of anger, but on the contrary, every kind of evil, fire and\nsword. Anger tramples self-restraint underfoot, steeps its hands\nin slaughter, scatters abroad the limbs of its children: it leaves\nno place unsoiled by crime, it has no thoughts of glory, no fears\nof disgrace, and when once anger has hardened into hatred, no\namendment is possible.\nXLII. Let us be free from this evil, let us clear our minds of it,\nand extirpate root and branch a passion which grows again wherever\nthe smallest particle of it finds a resting-place. Let us not\nmoderate anger, but get rid of it altogether: what can moderation\nhave to do with an evil habit? We shall succeed in doing this, if\nonly we exert ourselves. Nothing will be of greater service than\nto bear in mind that we are mortal: let each man say to himself and\nto his neighbour, \u201cWhy should we, as though we were born to live\nfor ever, waste our tiny span of life in declaring anger against\nany one? why should days, which we might spend in honourable\nenjoyment, be misapplied in grieving and torturing others? Life is\na matter which does not admit of waste, and we have no spare time\nto throw away. Why do we rush into the fray? why do we go out of\nour way to seek disputes? why do we, forgetful of the weakness of\nour nature, undertake mighty feuds, and, frail though we be, summon\nup all our strength to cut down other men? Ere long, fever or some\nother bodily ailment will make us unable to carry on this warfare\nof {160} hatred which we so implacably wage: death will soon part\nthe most vigorous pair of combatants. Why do we make disturbances\nand spend our lives in rioting? fate hangs over our heads, scores\nup to our account the days as they pass, and is ever drawing nearer\nand nearer. The time which you have marked for the death of another\nperhaps includes your own.\u201d\nXLIII. Instead of acting thus, why do you not rather draw together\nwhat there is of your short life, and keep it peaceful for others\nand for yourself? why do you not rather make yourself beloved by\nevery one while you live, and regretted by every one when you die?\nWhy do you wish to tame that man\u2019s pride, because he takes too lofty\na tone with you? why do you try with all your might to crush that\nother who snaps and snarls at you, a low and contemptible wretch,\nbut spiteful and offensive to his betters? Master, why are you angry\nwith your slave? Slave, why are you angry with your master? Client,\nwhy are you angry with your patron? Patron, why are you angry with\nyour client? Wait but a little while. See, here comes death, who\nwill make you all equals. We often see at a morning performance in\nthe arena a battle between a bull and a bear, fastened together,\nin which the victor, after he has torn the other to pieces, is\nhimself slain. We do just the same thing: we worry some one who is\nconnected with us, although the end of both victor and vanquished\nis at hand, and that soon. Let us rather pass the little remnant\nof our lives in peace and quiet: may no one loathe us when we lie\ndead. A quarrel is often brought to an end by a cry of \u201cFire!\u201d in\nthe neighbourhood, and the appearance of a wild beast parts the\nhighwayman from the traveller: men have no leisure to battle with\nminor evils when menaced by some overpowering terror. What have we\nto do with fighting and ambuscades? do you want anything more than\ndeath to befall {161} him with whom you are angry? well, even though\nyou sit quiet, he will be sure to die. You waste your pains: you\nwant to do what is certain to be done. You say, \u201cI do not wish\nnecessarily to kill him, but to punish him by exile, or public\ndisgrace, or loss of property.\u201d I can more easily pardon one who\nwishes to give his enemy a wound than one who wishes to give him a\nblister: for the latter is not only bad, but petty-minded. Whether\nyou are thinking of extreme or slighter punishments, how very short\nis the time during which either your victim is tortured or you enjoy\nan evil pleasure in another\u2019s pain? This breath that we hold so\ndear will soon leave us: in the meantime, while we draw it, while\nwe live among human beings, let us practise humanity: let us not\nbe a terror or a danger to any one. Let us keep our tempers in spite\nof losses, wrongs, abuse or sarcasm, and let us endure with magnanimity\nour shortlived troubles: while we are considering what is due to\nourselves, as the saying is, and worrying ourselves, death will be\nupon us.\n[1] The hook alluded to was fastened to the neck of condemned\ncriminals, and by it they were dragged to the Tiber.

Did I not know, Marcia, that you have as little of a woman\u2019s\nweakness of mind as of her other vices, and that your life was\nregarded as a pattern of antique virtue, I should not have dared\nto combat your grief, which is one that many men fondly nurse and\nembrace, nor should I have conceived the hope of persuading you to\nhold fortune blameless, having to plead for her at such an unfavorable\ntime, before so partial a judge, and against such an odious charge.\nI derive confidence, however, from the proved strength of your mind,\nand your virtue, which has been proved by a severe test. All men\nknow how well you behaved towards your father, whom you loved as\ndearly as your children in all respects, save that you did not wish\nhim to survive you: indeed, for all that I know you may have wished\nthat also: for great affection ventures to break some of the golden\nrules of life. You did all that lay in your power to avert the death\nof your father, Aulus Cremutius Cordus;[1] but when it became clear\nthat, surrounded as he was by the myrmidons of Sejanus, there was\nno other way of escape from slavery, you did not {163} indeed approve\nof his resolution, but gave up all attempts to oppose it; you shed\ntears openly, and choked down your sobs, yet did not screen them\nbehind a smiling face; and you did all this in the present century,\nwhen not to be unnatural towards one\u2019s parents is considered the\nheight of filial affection. When the changes of our times gave you\nan opportunity, you restored to the use of man that genius of your\nfather for which he had suffered, and made him in real truth immortal\nby publishing as an eternal memorial of him those books which that\nbravest of men had written with his own blood. You have done a great\nservice to Roman literature: a large part of Cordus\u2019s books had\nbeen burned; a great service to posterity, who will receive a true\naccount of events, which cost its author so dear; and a great service\nto himself, whose memory flourishes and ever will flourish, as long\nas men set any value upon the facts of Roman history, as long as\nany one lives who wishes to review the deeds of our fathers, to\nknow what a true Roman was like\u2014one who still remained unconquered\nwhen all other necks were broken in to receive the yoke of Sejanus,\none who was free in every thought, feeling, and act. By Hercules,\nthe state would have sustained a great loss if you had not brought\nhim forth from the oblivion to which his two splendid qualities,\neloquence and independence, had consigned him: he is now read, is\npopular, is received into men\u2019s hands and bosoms, and fears no old\nage: but as for those who butchered him, before long men will cease\nto speak even of their crimes, the only things by which they are\nremembered. This greatness of mind in you has forbidden me to take\ninto consideration your sex or your face, still clouded by the\nsorrow by which so many years ago it was suddenly overcast. See; I\nshall do nothing underhand, nor try to steal away your sorrows: I\nhave reminded you of old hurts, and to prove that your present wound\nmay be healed, I have {164} shown you the scar of one which was\nequally severe. Let others use soft measures and caresses; I have\ndetermined to do battle with your grief, and I will dry those weary\nand exhausted eyes, which already, to tell you the truth, are weeping\nmore from habit than from sorrow. I will effect this cure, if\npossible, with your goodwill: if you disapprove of my efforts, or\ndislike them, then you must continue to hug and fondle the grief\nwhich you have adopted as the survivor of your son. What, I pray\nyou, is to be the end of it? All means have been tried in vain: the\nconsolations of your friends, who are weary of offering them, and\nthe influence of great men who are related to you: literature, a\ntaste which your father enjoyed and which you have inherited from\nhim, now finds your ears closed, and affords you but a futile\nconsolation, which scarcely engages your thoughts for a moment.\nEven time itself, nature\u2019s greatest remedy, which quiets the most\nbitter grief, loses its power with you alone. Three years have\nalready passed, and still your grief has lost none of its first\npoignancy, but renews and strengthens itself day by day, and has\nnow dwelt so long with you that it has acquired a domicile in your\nmind, and actually thinks that it would be base to leave it. All\nvices sink into our whole being, if we do not crush them before\nthey gain a footing; and in like manner these sad, pitiable, and\ndiscordant feelings end by feeding upon their own bitterness, until\nthe unhappy mind takes a sort of morbid delight in grief. I should\nhave liked, therefore, to have attempted to effect this cure in the\nearliest stages of the disorder, before its force was fully developed;\nit might have been checked by milder remedies, but now that it has\nbeen confirmed by time it cannot be beaten without a hard struggle.\nIn like manner, wounds heal easily when the blood is fresh upon\nthem: they can then be cleared out and brought to the surface, and\nadmit of being probed by the finger: when disease {165} has turned\nthem into malignant ulcers, their cure is more difficult. I cannot\nnow influence so strong a grief by polite and mild measures: it\nmust be broken down by force.\nII. I am aware that all who wish to give any one advice begin with\nprecepts, and end with examples: but it is sometimes useful to alter\nthis fashion, for we must deal differently with different people.\nSome are guided by reason, others must be confronted with authority\nand the names of celebrated persons, whose brilliancy dazzles their\nmind and destroys their power of free judgment. I will place before\nyour eyes two of the greatest examples belonging to your sex and\nyour century: one, that of a woman who allowed herself to be entirely\ncarried away by grief; the other, one who, though afflicted by a\nlike misfortune, and an even greater loss, yet did not allow her\nsorrows to reign over her for a very long time, but quickly restored\nher mind to its accustomed frame. Octavia and Livia, the former\nAugustus\u2019s sister, the latter his wife, both lost their sons when\nthey were young men, and when they were certain of succeeding to\nthe throne. Octavia lost Marcellus, whom both his father-in-law and\nhis uncle had begun to depend upon, and to place upon his shoulders\nthe weight of the empire\u2014a young man of keen intelligence and firm\ncharacter, frugal and moderate in his desires to an extent which\ndeserved especial admiration in one so young and so wealthy, strong\nto endure labour, averse to indulgence, and able to bear whatever\nburden his uncle might choose to lay, or I may say to pile upon his\nshoulders. Augustus had well chosen him as a foundation, for he\nwould not have given way under any weight, however excessive. His\nmother never ceased to weep and sob during her whole life, never\nendured to listen to wholesome advice, never even allowed her\nthoughts to be diverted from her sorrow. She remained during her\nwhole life just as she was during the funeral, with all the {166}\nstrength of her mind intently fixed upon one subject. I do not say\nthat she lacked the courage to shake off her grief, but she refused\nto be comforted, thought that it would be a second bereavement to\nlose her tears, and would not have any portrait of her darling son,\nnor allow any allusion to be made to him. She hated all mothers,\nand raged against Livia with especial fury, because it seemed as\nthough the brilliant prospect once in store for her own child was\nnow transferred to Livia\u2019s son. Passing all her days in darkened\nrooms and alone, not conversing even with her brother, she refused\nto accept the poems which were composed in memory of Marcellus, and\nall the other honours paid him by literature, and closed her ears\nagainst all consolation. She lived buried and hidden from view,\nneglecting her accustomed duties, and actually angry with the\nexcessive splendour of her brother\u2019s prosperity, in which she shared.\nThough surrounded by her children and grandchildren, she would not\nlay aside her mourning garb, though by retaining it she seemed to\nput a slight upon all her relations, in thinking herself bereaved\nin spite of their being alive.\nIII. Livia lost her son Drusus, who would have been a great emperor,\nand was already a great general: he had marched far into Germany,\nand had planted the Roman standards in places where the very existence\nof the Romans was hardly known. He died on the march, his very foes\ntreating him with respect, observing a reciprocal truce, and not\nhaving the heart to wish for what would do them most service. In\naddition to his dying thus in his country\u2019s service, great sorrow\nfor him was expressed by the citizens, the provinces, and the whole\nof Italy, through which his corpse was attended by the people of\nthe free towns and colonies, who poured out to perform the last sad\noffices to him, till it reached Rome in a procession which resembled\na triumph. His mother was not permitted to {167} receive his last\nkiss and gather the last fond words from his dying lips: she followed\nthe relics of her Drusus on their long journey, though every one\nof the funeral pyres with which all Italy was glowing seemed to\nrenew her grief, as though she had lost him so many times. When,\nhowever, she at last laid him in the tomb, she left her sorrow there\nwith him, and grieved no more than was becoming to a Caesar or due\nto a son. She did not cease to make frequent mention of the name\nof her Drusus, to set up his portrait in all places, both public\nand private, and to speak of him and listen while others spoke of\nhim with the greatest pleasure: she lived with his memory; which\nnone can embrace and consort with who has made it painful to\nhimself.[2] Choose, therefore, which of these two examples you think\nthe more commendable: if you prefer to follow the former, you will\nremove yourself from the number of the living; you will shun the\nsight both of other people\u2019s children and of your own, and even of\nhim whose loss you deplore; you will be looked upon by mothers as\nan omen of evil; you will refuse to take part in honourable,\npermissible pleasures, thinking them unbecoming for one so afflicted;\nyou will be loth to linger above ground, and will be especially\nangry with your age, because it will not straightway bring your\nlife abruptly to an end. I here put the best construction on what\nis really most contemptible and foreign to your character. I mean\nthat you will show yourself unwilling to live, and unable to die.\nIf, on the other hand, showing a milder and better regulated spirit,\nyou try to follow the example of the latter most exalted lady, you\nwill not be in misery, nor will you wear your life out with suffering.\nPlague on it! what madness this is, to punish one\u2019s self because\none is unfortunate, and not to lessen, but to increase one\u2019s ills!\nYou ought to display, in this {168} matter also, that decent behaviour\nand modesty which has characterised all your life: for there is\nsuch a thing as self-restraint in grief also. You will show more\nrespect for the youth himself, who well deserves that it should\nmake you glad to speak and think of him, if you make him able to\nmeet his mother with a cheerful countenance, even as he was wont\nto do when alive.\nIV. I will not invite you to practise the sterner kind of maxims,\nnor bid you bear the lot of humanity with more than human philosophy;\nneither will I attempt to dry a mother\u2019s eyes on the very day of\nher son\u2019s burial. I will appear with you before an arbitrator: the\nmatter upon which we shall join issue is, whether grief ought to\nbe deep or unceasing. I doubt not that you will prefer the example\nof Julia Augusta, who was your intimate friend: she invites you to\nfollow her method: she, in her first paroxysm, when grief is\nespecially keen and hard to bear, betook herself for consolation\nto Areus, her husband\u2019s teacher in philosophy, and declared that\nthis did her much good; more good than the thought of the Roman\npeople, whom she was unwilling to sadden by her mourning; more than\nAugustus, who, staggering under the loss of one of his two chief\nsupporters, ought not to be yet more bowed down by the sorrow of\nhis relatives; more even than her son Tiberius, whose affection\nduring that untimely burial of one for whom whole nations wept made\nher feel that she had only lost one member of her family. This was,\nI imagine, his introduction to and grounding in philosophy of a\nwoman peculiarly tenacious of her own opinion:\u2014\u201cEven to the present\nday, Julia, as far as I can tell\u2014and I was your husband\u2019s constant\ncompanion, and knew not only what all men were allowed to know, but\nall the most secret thoughts of your hearts\u2014 you have been careful\nthat no one should find anything to blame in your conduct; not only\nin matters of importance, {169} but even in trifles you have taken\npains to do nothing which you could wish common fame, that most\nfrank judge of the acts of princes, to overlook. Nothing, I think,\nis more admirable than that those who are in high places should\npardon many shortcomings in others, and have to ask it for none of\ntheir own. So also in this matter of mourning you ought to act up\nto your maxim of doing nothing which you could wish undone, or done\notherwise.\nV. \u201cIn the next place, I pray and beseech you not to be self-willed\nand beyond the management of your friends. You must be aware that\nnone of them know how to behave, whether to mention Drusus in your\npresence or not, as they neither wish to wrong a noble youth by\nforgetting him, nor to hurt you by speaking of him. When we leave\nyou and assemble together by ourselves, we talk freely about his\nsayings and doings, treating them with the respect which they\ndeserve: in your presence deep silence is observed about him, and\nthus you lose that greatest of pleasures, the hearing the praises\nof your son, which I doubt not you would be willing to hand down\nto all future ages, had you the means of so doing, even at the cost\nof your own life. Wherefore endure to listen to, nay, encourage\nconversation of which he is the subject, and let your ears be open\nto the name and memory of your son. You ought not to consider this\npainful, like those who in such a case think that part of their\nmisfortune consists in listening to consolation. As it is, you have\naltogether run into the other extreme, and, forgetting the better\naspects of your lot, look only upon its worse side: you pay no\nattention to the pleasure you have had in your son\u2019s society and\nyour joyful meetings with him, the sweet caresses of his babyhood,\nthe progress of his education: you fix all your attention upon that\nlast scene of all: and to this, as though it were not shocking\nenough, you add every horror you can. Do not, I implore you, take\na perverse pride in appearing {170} the most unhappy of women: and\nreflect also that there is no great credit in behaving bravely in\ntimes of prosperity, when life glides easily with a favouring\ncurrent: neither does a calm sea and fair wind display the art of\nthe pilot: some foul weather is wanted to prove his courage. Like\nhim, then, do not give way, but rather plant yourself firmly, and\nendure whatever burden may fall upon you from above, scared though\nyou may have been at the first roar of the tempest. There is nothing\nthat fastens such a reproach[3] on Fortune as resignation.\u201d After\nthis he points out to her the son who is yet alive: he points out\ngrandchildren from the lost one.\nVI. It is your trouble, Marcia, which has been dealt with here: it\nis beside your couch of mourning that Areus has been sitting: change\nthe characters, and it is you whom he has been consoling. But, on\nthe other hand, Marcia, suppose that you have sustained a greater\nloss than ever mother did before you: see, I am not soothing you\nor making light of your misfortune: if fate can be overcome by\ntears, let us bring tears to bear upon it: let every day be passed\nin mourning, every night be spent in sorrow instead of sleep: let\nyour breast be torn by your own hands, your very face attacked by\nthem, and every kind of cruelty be practised by your grief, if it\nwill profit you. But if the dead cannot be brought back to life,\nhowever much we may beat our breasts, if destiny remains fixed and\nimmoveable for ever, not to be changed by any sorrow, however great,\nand death does not loose his hold of anything that he once has taken\naway, then let our futile grief be brought to an end. Let us, then,\nsteer our own course, and no longer allow ourselves to be driven\nto leeward by the force of our misfortune. He is a sorry pilot who\nlets the waves wring his rudder from his grasp, who leaves the sails\nto fly loose, and abandons the ship to the storm: but he who {171}\nboldly grasps the helm and clings to it until the sea closes over\nhim, deserves praise even though he be shipwrecked.\nVII. \u201cBut,\u201d say you, \u201csorrow for the loss of one\u2019s own children is\nnatural.\u201d Who denies it? provided it be reasonable? for we cannot\nhelp feeling a pang, and the stoutest-hearted of us are cast down\nnot only at the death of those dearest to us, but even when they\nleave us on a journey. Nevertheless, the mourning which public\nopinion enjoins is more than nature insists upon. Observe how intense\nand yet how brief are the sorrows of dumb animals: we hear a cow\nlowing for one or two days, nor do mares pursue their wild and\nsenseless gallops for longer: wild beasts after they have tracked\ntheir lost cubs throughout the forest, and often visited their\nplundered dens, quench their rage within a short space of time.\nBirds circle round their empty nests with loud and piteous cries,\nyet almost immediately resume their ordinary flight in silence; nor\ndoes any creature spend long periods in sorrowing for the loss of\nits offspring, except man, who encourages his own grief, the measure\nof which depends not upon his sufferings, but upon his will. You\nmay know that to be utterly broken down by grief is not natural,\nby observing that the same bereavement inflicts a deeper wound upon\nwomen than upon men, upon savages than upon civilised and cultivated\npersons, upon the unlearned than upon the learned: yet those passions\nwhich derive their force from nature are equally powerful in all\nmen: therefore it is clear that a passion of varying strength cannot\nbe a natural one. Fire will burn all people equally, male and female,\nof every rank and every age: steel will exhibit its cutting power\non all bodies alike: and why? Because these things derive their\nstrength from nature, which makes no distinction of persons. Poverty,\ngrief, and ambition,[4] are {172} felt differently by different\npeople, according as they are influenced by habit: a rooted prejudice\nabout the terrors of these things, though they are not really to\nbe feared, makes a man weak and unable to endure them.\nVIII. Moreover, that which depends upon nature is not weakened by\ndelay, but grief is gradually effaced by time. However obstinate\nit may be, though it be daily renewed and be exasperated by all\nattempts to soothe it, yet even this becomes weakened by time, which\nis the most efficient means of taming its fierceness. You, Marcia,\nhave still a mighty sorrow abiding with you, nevertheless it already\nappears to have become blunted: it is obstinate and enduring, but\nnot so acute as it was at first: and this also will be taken from\nyou piecemeal by succeeding years. Whenever you are engaged in other\npursuits your mind will be relieved from its burden: at present you\nkeep watch over yourself to prevent this. Yet there is a great\ndifference between allowing and forcing yourself to grieve. How\nmuch more in accordance with your cultivated taste it would be to\nput an end to your mourning instead of looking for the end to come,\nand not to wait for the day when your sorrow shall cease against\nyour will: dismiss it of your own accord.\nIX. \u201cWhy then,\u201d you ask, \u201cdo we show such persistence in mourning\nfor our friends, if it be not nature that bids us do so?\u201d It is\nbecause we never expect that any evil will befall ourselves before\nit comes, we will not be taught by seeing the misfortunes of others\nthat they are the common inheritance of all men, but imagine that\nthe path which we have begun to tread is free from them and less\nbeset by dangers than that of other people. How many funerals pass\nour houses? yet we do not think of death. How many untimely deaths?\nwe think only of our son\u2019s coming of age, of his service in the\narmy, or of his succession to his father\u2019s estate. How many rich\nmen suddenly {173} sink into poverty before our very eyes, without\nits ever occurring to our minds that our own wealth is exposed to\nexactly the same risks? When, therefore, misfortune befalls us, we\ncannot help collapsing all the more completely, because we are\nstruck as it were unawares: a blow which has long been foreseen\nfalls much less heavily upon us. Do you wish to know how completely\nexposed you are to every stroke of fate, and that the same shafts\nwhich have transfixed others are whirling around yourself? then\nimagine that you are mounting without sufficient armour to assault\nsome city wall or some strong and lofty position manned by a great\nhost, expect a wound, and suppose that all those stones, arrows,\nand darts which fill the upper air are aimed at your body: whenever\nany one falls at your side or behind your back, exclaim, \u201cFortune,\nyou will not outwit me, or catch me confident and heedless: I know\nwhat you are preparing to do: you have struck down another, but you\naimed at me.\u201d Who ever looks upon his own affairs as though he were\nat the point of death? which of us ever dares to think about\nbanishment, want, or mourning? who, if advised to meditate upon\nthese subjects, would not reject the idea like an evil omen, and\nbid it depart from him and alight on the heads of his enemies, or\neven on that of his untimely adviser? \u201cI never thought it would\nhappen!\u201d How can you think that anything will not happen, when you\nknow that it may happen to many men, and has happened to many? That\nis a noble verse, and worthy of a nobler source than the stage:\u2014\n\u201cWhat one hath suffered may befall us all.\u201d\nThat man has lost his children: you may lose yours. That man has\nbeen convicted: your innocence is in peril. We are deceived and\nweakened by this delusion, when we suffer what we never foresaw\nthat we possibly could suffer: but by looking forward to the coming\nof our sorrows we take the sting out of them when they come.\n{174}\nX. My Marcia, all these adventitious circumstances which glitter\naround us, such as children, office in the state, wealth, large\nhalls, vestibules crowded with clients seeking vainly for admittance,\na noble name, a well-born or beautiful wife, and every other thing\nwhich depends entirely upon uncertain and changeful fortune, are\nbut furniture which is not our own, but entrusted to us on loan:\nnone of these things are given to us outright: the stage of our\nlives is adorned with properties gathered from various sources, and\nsoon to be returned to their several owners: some of them will be\ntaken away on the first day, some on the second, and but few will\nremain till the end. We have, therefore, no grounds for regarding\nourselves with complacency, as though the things which surround us\nwere our own: they are only borrowed: we have the use and enjoyment\nof them for a time regulated by the lender, who controls his own\ngift: it is our duty always to be able to lay our hands upon what\nhas been lent us with no fixed date for its return, and to restore\nit when called upon without a murmur: the most detestable kind of\ndebtor is he who rails at his creditor. Hence all our relatives,\nboth those who by the order of their birth we hope will outlive\nourselves, and those who themselves most properly wish to die before\nus, ought to be loved by us as persons whom we cannot be sure of\nhaving with us for ever, nor even for long. We ought frequently to\nremind ourselves that we must love the things of this life as we\nwould what is shortly to leave us, or indeed in the very act of\nleaving us. Whatever gift Fortune bestows upon a man, let him think\nwhile he enjoys it, that it will prove as fickle as the goddess\nfrom whom it came. Snatch what pleasure you can from your children,\nallow your children in their turn to take pleasure in your society,\nand drain every pleasure to the dregs without any delay. We cannot\nreckon on to-night, nay, I have allowed too long a delay, {175} we\ncannot reckon on this hour: we must make haste: the enemy presses\non behind us: soon that society of yours will be broken up, that\npleasant company will be taken by assault and dispersed. Pillage\nis the universal law: unhappy creatures, know you not that life is\nbut a flight? If you grieve for the death of your son, the fault\nlies with the time when he was born, for at his birth he was told\nthat death was his doom: it is the law under which he was born, the\nfate which has pursued him ever since he left his mother\u2019s womb.\nWe have come under the dominion of Fortune, and a harsh and\nunconquerable dominion it is: at her caprice we must suffer all\nthings whether we deserve them or not. She maltreats our bodies\nwith anger, insult, and cruelty: some she burns, the fire being\nsometimes applied as a punishment and sometimes as a remedy: some\nshe imprisons, allowing it to be done at one time by our enemies,\nat another by our countrymen: she tosses others naked on the changeful\nseas, and after their struggle with the waves will not even cast\nthem out upon the sand or the shore, but will entomb them in the\nbelly of some huge sea-monster: she wears away others to a skeleton\nby divers kinds of disease, and keeps them long in suspense between\nlife and death: she is as capricious in her rewards and punishments\nas a fickle, whimsical, and careless mistress is with those of her\nslaves.\nXI. Why need we weep over parts of our life? the whole of it calls\nfor tears: new miseries assail us before we have freed ourselves\nfrom the old ones. You, therefore, who allow them to trouble you\nto an unreasonable extent ought especially to restrain yourselves,\nand to muster all the powers of the human breast to combat your\nfears and your pains. Moreover, what forgetfulness of your own\nposition and that of mankind is this? You were born a mortal, and\nyou have given birth to mortals: yourself a weak and fragile body,\nliable to all diseases, can you have hoped to {176} produce anything\nstrong and lasting from such unstable materials? Your son has died:\nin other words he has reached that goal towards which those whom\nyou regard as more fortunate than your offspring are still hastening:\nthis is the point towards which move at different rates all the\ncrowds which are squabbling in the law courts, sitting in the\ntheatres, praying in the temples. Those whom you love and those\nwhom you despise will both be made equal in the same ashes. This\nis the meaning of that command, KNOW THYSELF, which is written on\nthe shrine of the Pythian oracle. What is man? a potter\u2019s vessel,\nto be broken by the slightest shake or toss: it requires no great\nstorm to rend you asunder: you fall to pieces wherever you strike.\nWhat is man? a weakly and frail body, naked, without any natural\nprotection, dependent on the help of others, exposed to all the\nscorn of Fortune; even when his muscles are well trained he is the\nprey and the food of the first wild beast he meets, formed of weak\nand unstable substances, fair in outward feature, but unable to\nendure cold, heat, or labour, and yet falling to ruin if kept in\nsloth and idleness, fearing his very victuals, for he is starved\nif he has them not, and bursts if he has too much. He cannot be\nkept safe without anxious care, his breath only stays in the body\non sufferance, and has no real hold upon it; he starts at every\nsudden danger, every loud and unexpected noise that reaches his\nears. Ever a cause of anxiety to ourselves, diseased and useless\nas we are, can we be surprised at the death of a creature which can\nbe killed by a single hiccup? Is it a great undertaking to put an\nend to us? why, smells, tastes, fatigue and want of sleep, food and\ndrink, and the very necessaries of life, are mortal. Whithersoever\nhe moves he straightway becomes conscious of his weakness, not being\nable to bear all climates, falling sick after drinking strange\nwater, breathing an air to which he is not accustomed, or {177}\nfrom other causes and reasons of the most trifling kind, frail,\nsickly, entering upon his life with weeping: yet nevertheless what\na disturbance this despicable creature makes! what ideas it conceives,\nforgetting its lowly condition! It exercises its mind upon matters\nwhich are immortal and eternal, and arranges the affairs of its\ngrandchildren and great-grandchildren, while death surprises it in\nthe midst of its far-reaching schemes, and what we call old age is\nbut the round of a very few years.\nXII. Supposing that your sorrow has any method at all, is it your\nown sufferings or those of him who is gone that it has in view? Why\ndo you grieve over your lost son? is it because you have received\nno pleasure from him, or because you would have received more had\nhe lived longer? If you answer that you have received no pleasure\nfrom him you make your loss more endurable: for men miss less when\nlost what has given them no enjoyment or gladness. If, again, you\nadmit that you have received much pleasure, it is your duty not to\ncomplain of that part which you have lost, but to return thanks for\nthat which you have enjoyed. His rearing alone ought to have brought\nyou a sufficient return for your labours, for it can hardly be that\nthose who take the greatest pains to rear puppies, birds, and such\nlike paltry objects of amusement derive a certain pleasure from the\nsight and touch and fawning caresses of these dumb creatures, and\nyet that those who rear children should not find their reward in\ndoing so. Thus, even though his industry may have gained nothing\nfor you, his carefulness may have saved nothing for you, his foresight\nmay have given you no advice, yet you found sufficient reward in\nhaving owned him and loved him. \u201cBut,\u201d say you, \u201cit might have\nlasted longer.\u201d True, but you have been better dealt with than if\nyou had never had a son, for, supposing you were given your choice,\nwhich is the better lot, to be happy for a short time or not at\nall? {178} It is better to enjoy pleasures which soon leave us than\nto enjoy none at all. Which, again, would you choose? to have had\none who was a disgrace to you, and who merely filled the position\nand owned the name of your son, or one of such noble character as\nyour son\u2019s was? a youth who soon grew discreet and dutiful, soon\nbecame a husband and a father, soon became eager for public honours,\nand soon obtained the priesthood, winning his way to all these\nadmirable things with equally admirable speed. It falls to scarcely\nany one\u2019s lot to enjoy great prosperity, and also to enjoy it for\na long time: only a dull kind of happiness can last for long and\naccompany us to the end of our lives. The immortal gods, who did\nnot intend to give you a son for long, gave you one who was straightway\nwhat another would have required long training to become. You cannot\neven say that you have been specially marked by the gods for\nmisfortune because you have had no pleasure in your son. Look at\nany company of people, whether they be known to you or not: everywhere\nyou will see some who have endured greater misfortunes than your\nown. Great generals and princes have undergone like bereavements:\nmythology tells us that the gods themselves are not exempt from\nthem, its aim, I suppose, being to lighten our sorrow at death by\nthe thought that even deities are subject to it. Look around, I\nrepeat, at every one: you cannot mention any house so miserable as\nnot to find comfort in the fact of another being yet more miserable.\nI do not, by Hercules, think so ill of your principles as to suppose\nthat you would bear your sorrow more lightly were I to show you an\nenormous company of mourners: that is a spiteful sort of consolation\nwhich we derive from the number of our fellow-sufferers: nevertheless\nI will quote some instances, not indeed in order to teach you that\nthis often befalls men, for it is absurd to multiply examples of\nman\u2019s mortality, but to let you know that there have {179} been\nmany who have lightened their misfortunes by patient endurance of\nthem. I will begin with the luckiest man of all. Lucius Sulla lost\nhis son, yet this did not impair either the spitefulness or the\nbrilliant valour which he displayed at the expense of his enemies\nand his countrymen alike, nor did it make him appear to have assumed\nhis well-known title untruly that he did so after his son\u2019s death,\nfearing neither the hatred of men, by whose sufferings that excessive\nprosperity of his was purchased, nor the ill-will of the gods, to\nwhom it was a reproach that Sulla should be so truly The Fortunate.\nWhat, however, Sulla\u2019s real character was may pass among questions\nstill undecided: even his enemies will admit that he took up arms\nwith honour, and laid them aside with honour: his example proves\nthe point at issue, that an evil which befalls even the most\nprosperous cannot be one of the first magnitude.\nXIII. That Greece cannot boast unduly of that father who, being in\nthe act of offering sacrifice when he heard the news of his son\u2019s\ndeath, merely ordered the flute-player to be silent, and removed\nthe garland from his head, but accomplished all the rest of the\nceremony in due form, is due to a Roman, Pulvillus the high priest.\nWhen he was in the act of holding the doorpost[5] and dedicating\nthe Capitol the news of his son\u2019s death was brought to him. He\npretended not to hear it, and pronounced the form of words proper\nfor the high priest on such an occasion, without his prayer being\ninterrupted by a single groan, begging that Jupiter would show\nhimself gracious, at the very instant that he heard his son\u2019s name\nmentioned as dead. Do you imagine that this man\u2019s mourning knew no\nend, if the first day and the first shook could not drive him,\nthough a father, away {180} from the public altar of the state, or\ncause him to mar the ceremony of dedication by words of ill omen?\nWorthy, indeed, of the most exalted priesthood was he who ceased\nnot to revere the gods even when they were angry. Yet he, after he\nhad gone home, filled his eyes with tears, said a few words of\nlamentation, and performed the rites with which it was then customary\nto honour the dead, resumed the expression of countenance which he\nhad worn in the Capitol.\nPaulus,[6] about the time of his magnificent triumph, in which he\ndrove Perses in chains before his car, gave two of his sons to be\nadopted into other families, and buried those whom he had kept for\nhimself. What, think you, must those whom he kept have been, when\nScipio was one of those whom he gave away? It was not without emotion\nthat the Roman people looked upon Paulus\u2019s empty chariot:[7]\nnevertheless he made a speech to them, and returned thanks to the\ngods for having granted his prayer: for he had prayed that, if any\noffering to Nemesis were due in consequence of the stupendous victory\nwhich he had won, it might be paid at his own expense rather than\nat that of his country. Do you see how magnanimously he bore his\nloss? he even congratulated himself on being left childless, though\nwho had more to suffer by such a change? he lost at once his\ncomforters and his helpers. Yet Perses did not have the pleasure\nof seeing Paulus look sorrowful.\nXIV. Why should I lead you on through the endless {181} series of\ngreat men and pick out the unhappy ones, as though it were not more\ndifficult to find happy ones? for how few households have remained\npossessed of all their members until the end? what one is there\nthat has not suffered some loss? Take any one year you please and\nname the consuls for it: if you like, that of[8] Lucius Bibulus and\nGaius Caesar; you will see that, though these colleagues were each\nother\u2019s bitterest enemies, yet their fortunes agreed. Lucius Bibulus,\na man more remarkable for goodness than for strength of character,\nhad both his sons murdered at the same time, and even insulted by\nthe Egyptian soldiery, so that the agent of his bereavement was as\nmuch a subject for tears as the bereavement itself. Nevertheless\nBibulus, who during the whole of his year of office had remained\nhidden in his house, to cast reproach upon his colleague Caesar on\nthe day following that upon which he heard of both his sons\u2019 deaths,\ncame forth and went through the routine business of his magistracy.\nWho could devote less than one day to mourning for two sons? Thus\nsoon did he end his mourning for his children, although he had\nmourned a whole year for his consulship. Gaius Caesar, after having\ntraversed Britain, and not allowed even the ocean to set bounds to\nhis successes, heard of the death of his daughter, which hurried\non the crisis of affairs. Already Gnaeus Pompeius stood before his\neyes, a man who would ill endure that any one besides himself should\nbecome a great power in the state, and one who was likely to place\na check upon his advancement, which he had regarded as onerous even\nwhen each gained by the other\u2019s rise: yet within three days\u2019 time\nhe resumed his duties as general, and conquered his grief as quickly\nas he was wont to conquer everything else.\nXV. Why need I remind you of the deaths of the other {182} Caesars,\nwhom fortune appears to me sometimes to have outraged in order that\neven by their deaths they might be useful to mankind, by proving\nthat not even they, although they were styled \u201csons of gods,\u201d and\n\u201cfathers of gods to come,\u201d could exercise the same power over their\nown fortunes which they did over those of others? The Emperor\nAugustus lost his children and his grandchildren, and after all the\nfamily of Caesar had perished was obliged to prop his empty house\nby adopting a son: yet he bore his losses as bravely as though he\nwere already personally concerned in the honour of the gods, and\nas though it were especially to his interest that no one should\ncomplain of the injustice of Heaven. Tiberius Caesar lost both the\nson whom he begot and the son whom he adopted, yet he himself\npronounced a panegyric upon his son from the Rostra, and stood in\nfull view of the corpse, which merely had a curtain on one side to\nprevent the eyes of the high priest resting upon the dead body, and\ndid not change his countenance, though all the Romans wept: he gave\nSejanus, who stood by his side, a proof of how patiently he could\nendure the loss of his relatives. See you not what numbers of most\neminent men there have been, none of whom have been spared by this\nblight which prostrates us all: men, too, adorned with every grace\nof character, and every distinction that public or private life can\nconfer. It appears as though this plague moved in a regular orbit,\nand spread ruin and desolation among us all without distinction of\npersons, all being alike its prey. Bid any number of individuals\ntell you the story of their lives: you will find that all have paid\nsome penalty for being born.\nXVI. I know what you will say, \u201cYou quote men as examples: you\nforget that it is a woman that you are trying to console.\u201d Yet who\nwould say that nature has dealt grudgingly with the minds of women,\nand stunted their virtues? Believe me, they have the same intellectual\npower as men, {183} and the same capacity for honourable and generous\naction. If trained to do so, they are just as able to endure sorrow\nor labour. Ye good gods, do I say this in that very city in which\nLucretia and Brutus removed the yoke of kings from the necks of the\nRomans? We owe liberty to Brutus, but we owe Brutus to Lucretia\u2014in\nwhich Cloelia, for the sublime courage with which she scorned both\nthe enemy and the river, has been almost reckoned as a man. The\nstatue of Cloelia, mounted on horseback, in that busiest of\nthoroughfares, the Sacred Way, continually reproaches the youth of\nthe present day, who never mount anything but a cushioned seat in\na carriage, with journeying in such a fashion through that very\ncity in which we have enrolled even women among our knights. If you\nwish me to point out to you examples of women who have bravely\nendured the loss of their children, I shall not go far afield to\nsearch for them: in one family I can quote two Cornelias, one the\ndaughter of Scipio, and the mother of the Gracchi, who made\nacknowledgment of the birth of her twelve children by burying them\nall: nor was it so hard to do this in the case of the others, whose\nbirth and death were alike unknown to the public, but she beheld\nthe murdered and unburied corpses of both Tiberius Gracchus and\nGaius Gracchus, whom even those who will not call them good must\nadmit were great men. Yet to those who tried to console her and\ncalled her unfortunate, she answered, \u201cI shall never cease to call\nmyself happy, because I am the mother of the Gracchi.\u201d Cornelia,\nthe wife of Livius Drusus, lost by the hands of an unknown assassin\na young son of great distinction, who was treading in the footsteps\nof the Gracchi, and was murdered in his own house just when he had\nso many bills half way through the process of becoming law:\nnevertheless she bore the untimely and unavenged death of her son\nwith as lofty a spirit as he had shown in carrying his laws. Will\nyou not, Marcia, forgive fortune because she has not refrained {184}\nfrom striking you with the darts with which she launched at the\nScipios, and the mothers and daughters of the Scipios, and with\nwhich she has attacked the Caesars themselves? Life is full of\nmisfortunes; our path is beset with them: no one can make a long\npeace, nay, scarcely an armistice with fortune. You, Marcia, have\nborne four children: now they say that no dart which is hurled into\na close column of soldiers can fail to hit one,\u2014ought you then to\nwonder at not having been able to lead along such a company without\nexciting the ill-will of Fortune, or suffering loss at her hands?\n\u201cBut,\u201d say you, \u201cFortune has treated me unfairly, for she not only\nhas bereaved me of my son, but chose my best beloved to deprive me\nof.\u201d Yet you never can say that you have been wronged, if you divide\nthe stakes equally with an antagonist who is stronger than yourself:\nFortune has left you two daughters, and their children: she has not\neven taken away altogether him who you now mourn for, forgetful of\nhis elder brother: you have two daughters by him, who if you support\nthem ill will prove great burdens, but if well, great comforts to\nyou. You ought to prevail upon yourself, when you see them, to let\nthem remind you of your son, and not of your grief. When a husbandman\u2019s\ntrees have either been torn up, roots and all, by the wind, or\nbroken off short by the force of a hurricane, he takes care of what\nis left of their stock, straightway plants seeds or cuttings in the\nplace of those which he has lost, and in a moment\u2014for time is as\nswift in repairing losses as in causing them\u2014more flourishing trees\nare growing than were there before. Take, then, in the place of\nyour Metilius these his two daughters, and by their twofold consolation\nlighten your single sorrow. True, human nature is so constituted\nas to love nothing so much as what it has lost, and our yearning\nafter those who have been taken from us makes us judge unfairly of\nthose who are left to us: nevertheless, if you choose to reckon up\nhow merciful {185} Fortune has been to you even in her anger, you\nwill feel that you have more than enough to console you. Look at\nall your grandchildren, and your two daughters: and say also,\nMarcia:\u2014\u201cI should indeed be cast down, if everyone\u2019s fortune followed\nhis deserts, and if no evil ever befel good men: but as it is I\nperceive that no distinction is made, and that the bad and the good\nare both harassed alike.\u201d\nXVII. \u201cStill, it is a sad thing to lose a young man whom you have\nbrought up, just as he was becoming a defence and a pride both to\nhis mother and to his country.\u201d No one denies that it is sad: but\nit is the common lot of mortals. You were born to lose others, to\nbe lost, to hope, to fear, to destroy your own peace and that of\nothers, to fear and yet to long for death, and, worst of all, never\nto know what your real position is. If you were about to journey\nto Syracuse, and some one were to say:\u2014\u201cLearn beforehand all the\ndiscomforts, and all the pleasures of your coming voyage, and then\nset sail. The sights which you will enjoy will be as follows: first,\nyou will see the island itself, now separated from Italy by a narrow\nstrait, but which, we know, once formed part of the mainland. The\nsea suddenly broke through, and\n\u2018Sever\u2019d Sicilia from the western shore.\u2019[9]\nNext, as you will be able to sail close to Charybdis, of which the\npoets have sung, you will see that greediest of whirlpools, quite\nsmooth if no south wind be blowing, but whenever there is a gale\nfrom that quarter, sucking down ships into a huge and deep abyss.\nYou will see the fountain of Arethusa, so famed in song, with its\nwaters bright and pellucid to the very bottom, and pouring forth\nan icy stream which it either finds on the spot or else plunges it\nunder ground, conveys it thither as a separate river beneath so\nmany seas, free from any mixture of less pure water, and {186} there\nbrings it again to the surface. You will see a harbour which is\nmore sheltered than all the others in the world, whether they be\nnatural or improved by human art for the protection of shipping;\nso safe, that even the most violent storms are powerless to disturb\nit. You will see the place where the power of Athens was broken,\nwhere that natural prison, hewn deep among precipices of rock,\nreceived so many thousands of captives: you will see the great city\nitself, occupying a wider site than many capitals, an extremely\nwarm resort in winter, where not a single day passes without sunshine:\nbut when you have observed all this, you must remember that the\nadvantages of its winter climate are counterbalanced by a hot and\npestilential summer: that here will be the tyrant Dionysius, the\ndestroyer of freedom, of justice, and of law, who is greedy of power\neven after conversing with Plato, and of life even after he has\nbeen exiled; that he will burn some, flog others, and behead others\nfor slight offences; that he will exercise his lust upon both sexes\n. . . . . You have now heard all that can attract you thither, all\nthat can deter you from going: now, then, either set sail or remain\nat home!\u201d If, after this declaration, anybody were to say that he\nwished to go to Syracuse, he could blame no one but himself for\nwhat befel him there, because he would not stumble upon it unknowingly,\nbut would have gone thither fully aware of what was before him. To\neveryone Nature says: \u201cI do not deceive any person. If you choose\nto have children, they may be handsome, or they may be deformed;\nperhaps they will be born dumb. One of them may perhaps prove the\nsaviour of his country, or perhaps its betrayer. You need not despair\nof their being raised to such honour that for their sake no one\nwill dare to speak evil of you: yet remember that they may reach\nsuch a pitch of infamy as themselves to become curses to you. There\nis nothing to prevent their performing the {187} last offices for\nyou, and your panegyric being spoken by your children: but hold\nyourself prepared nevertheless to place a son as boy, man, or\ngreybeard, upon the funeral pyre: for years have nothing to do with\nthe matter, since every sort of funeral in which a parent buries\nhis child must alike be untimely.[10] If you still choose to rear\nchildren, after I have explained these conditions to you, you render\nyourself incapable of blaming the gods, for they never guaranteed\nanything to you.\u201d\nXVIII. You may make this simile apply to your whole entrance into\nlife. I have explained to you what attractions and what drawbacks\nthere would be if you were thinking of going to Syracuse: now suppose\nthat I were to come and give you advice when you were going to be\nborn. \u201cYou are about,\u201d I should say, \u201cto enter a city of which both\ngods and men are citizens, a city which contains the whole universe,\nwhich is bound by irrevocable and eternal laws, and wherein the\nheavenly bodies run their unwearied courses: you will see therein\ninnumerable twinkling stars, and the sun, whose single light pervades\nevery place, who by his daily course marks the times of day and\nnight, and by his yearly course makes a more equal division between\nsummer and winter. You will see his place taken by night by the\nmoon, who borrows at her meetings with her brother a gentle and\nsofter light, and who at one time is invisible, at another hangs\nfull-faced above the earth, ever waxing and waning, each phase\nunlike the last. You will see five stars, moving in the opposite\ndirection to the others, stemming the whirl of the skies towards\nthe West: on the slightest motions of these depend the fortunes of\nnations, and according as the aspect of the planets is auspicious\nor malignant, the greatest empires rise and fall: you will see with\nwonder the gathering clouds, the falling showers, the {188} zigzag\nlightning, the crashing together of the heavens. When, sated with\nthe wonders above, you turn your eyes towards the earth, they will\nbe met by objects of a different yet equally admirable aspect: on\none side a boundless expanse of open plains, on another the towering\npeaks of lofty and snow-clad mountains: the downward course of\nrivers, some streams running eastward, some westward from the same\nsource: the woods which wave even on the mountain tops, the vast\nforests with all the creatures that dwell therein, and the confused\nharmony of the birds: the variously-placed cities, the nations which\nnatural obstacles keep secluded from the world, some of whom withdraw\nthemselves to lofty mountains, while others dwell in fear and\ntrembling on the sloping banks of rivers: the crops which are\nassisted by cultivation, and the trees which bear fruit even without\nit: the rivers that flow gently through the meadows, the lovely\nbays and shores that curve inwards to form harbours: the countless\nislands scattered over the main, which break and spangle the seas.\nWhat of the brilliancy of stones and gems, the gold that rolls amid\nthe sands of rushing streams, the heaven-born fires that burst forth\nfrom the midst of the earth and even front the midst of the sea;\nthe ocean itself, that binds land to land, dividing the nations by\nits threefold indentations, and boiling up with mighty rage? Swimming\nupon its waves, making them disturbed and swelling without wind,\nyou will see animals exceeding the size of any that belong to the\nland, some clumsy and requiring others to guide their movements,\nsome swift and moving faster than the utmost efforts of rowers,\nsome of them that drink in the waters and blow them out again to\nthe great perils of those who sail near them: you will see here\nships seeking for unknown lands: you will see that man\u2019s audacity\nleaves nothing unattempted, and you will yourself be both a witness\nand a sharer in great {189} attempts. You will both learn and teach\nthe arts by which men\u2019s lives are supplied with necessaries, are\nadorned, and are ruled: but in this same place there will be a\nthousand pestilences fatal to both body and mind, there will be\nwars and highway robberies, poisonings and shipwrecks, extremes of\nclimate and excesses of body, untimely griefs for our dearest ones,\nand death for ourselves, of which we cannot tell whether it will\nbe easy or by torture at the hands of the executioner. Now consider\nand weigh carefully in your own mind which you would choose. If you\nwish to enjoy these blessings you must pass through these pains.\nDo you answer that you choose to live? \u2018Of course.\u2019 Nay, I thought\nyou would not enter upon that of which the least diminution causes\npain. Live, then, as has been agreed on. You say, \u201cNo one has asked\nmy opinion.\u201d Our parents\u2019 opinion was taken about us, when, knowing\nwhat the conditions of life are, they brought us into it.\nXIX. But, to come to topics of consolation, in the first place\nconsider if you please to what our remedies must be applied, and\nnext, in what way. It is regret for the absence of his loved one\nwhich causes a mourner to grieve: yet it is clear that this in\nitself is bearable enough; for we do not weep at their being absent\nor intending to be absent during their lifetime, although when they\nleave our sight we have no more pleasure in them. What tortures us,\ntherefore, is an idea. Now every evil is just as great as we consider\nit to be: we have, therefore, the remedy in our own hands. Let us\nsuppose that they are on a journey, and let us deceive ourselves:\nwe have sent them away, or, rather, we have sent them on in advance\nto a place whither we shall soon follow them.[11] Besides this,\nmourners are wont to suffer from the thought, \u201cI shall {190} have\nno one to protect me, no one to avenge me when I am scorned.\u201d To\nuse a very disreputable but very true mode of consolation, I may\nsay that in our country the loss of children bestows more influence\nthan it takes away, and loneliness, which used to bring the aged\nto ruin, now makes them so powerful that some old men have pretended\nto pick quarrels with their sons, have disowned their own children,\nand have made themselves childless by their own act. I know what\nyou will say: \u201cMy own losses do not grieve me:\u201d and indeed a man\ndoes not deserve to be consoled if he is sorry for his son\u2019s death\nas he would be for that of a slave, who is capable of seeing anything\nin his son beyond his son\u2019s self. What then, Marcia, is it that\ngrieves you? is it that your son has died, or that he did not live\nlong? If it be his having died, then you ought always to have\ngrieved, for you always knew that he would die. Reflect that the\ndead suffer no evils, that all those stories which make us dread\nthe nether world are mere fables, that he who dies need fear no\ndarkness, no prison, no blazing streams of fire, no river of Lethe,\nno judgment seat before which he must appear, and that Death is\nsuch utter freedom that, he need fear no more despots. All that is\na phantasy of the poets, who have terrified us without a cause.\nDeath is a release from and an end of all pains: beyond it our\nsufferings cannot extend: it restores us to the peaceful rest in\nwhich we lay before we were born. If any one pities the dead, he\nought also to pity those who have not been born. Death is neither\na good nor a bad thing, for that alone which is something can be a\ngood or a bad thing: but that which is nothing, and reduces all\nthings to nothing, does not hand us over to either fortune, because\ngood and bad require some material to work upon. Fortune cannot\ntake hold of that which Nature has let go, nor can a man be unhappy\nif he is nothing. Your son has passed beyond the border of the {191}\ncountry where men are forced to labour; he has reached deep and\neverlasting peace. He feels no fear of want, no anxiety about his\nriches, no stings of lust that tears the heart in guise of pleasure:\nhe knows no envy of another\u2019s prosperity, he is not crushed by the\nweight of his own; even his chaste ears are not wounded by any\nribaldry: he is menaced by no disaster, either to his country or\nto himself. He does not hang, full of anxiety, upon the issue of\nevents, to reap even greater uncertainty as his reward: he has at\nlast taken up a position from which nothing can dislodge him, where\nnothing can make him afraid.\nXX. O how little do men understand their own misery, that they do\nnot praise and look forward to death as the best discovery of Nature,\nwhether because it hedges in happiness, or because it drives away\nmisery: because it puts an end to the sated weariness of old age,\ncuts down youth in its bloom while still full of hope of better\nthings, or calls home childhood before the harsher stages of life\nare reached: it is the end of all men, a relief to many, a desire\nto some, and it treats none so well as those to whom it comes before\nthey call for it. Death frees the slave though his master wills it\nnot, it lightens the captive\u2019s chains: it leads out of prison those\nwhom headstrong power has forbidden to quit it: it points out to\nexiles, whose minds and eyes are ever turned towards their own\ncountry, that it makes no difference under what people\u2019s soil one\nlies. When Fortune has unjustly divided the common stock, and has\ngiven over one man to another, though they were born with equal\nrights. Death makes them all equal. After Death no one acts any\nmore at another\u2019s bidding: in death no man suffers any more from\nthe sense of his low position. It is open to all: it was what your\nfather, Marcia, longed for: it is this, I say, that renders it no\nmisery to be born, which enables me to face the threatenings of\nmisfortune without quailing, and to keep {192} my mind unharmed and\nable to command itself. I have a last appeal. I see before me crosses\nnot all alike, but differently made by different peoples: some hang\na man head downwards, some force a stick upwards through his groin,\nsome stretch out his arms on a forked gibbet. I see cords, scourges,\nand instruments of torture for each limb and each joint: but I see\nDeath also. There are bloodthirsty enemies, there are overbearing\nfellow-countrymen, but where they are there I see Death also. Slavery\nis not grievous if a man can gain his freedom by one step as soon\nas he becomes tired of thraldom. Life, it is thanks to Death that\nI hold thee so dear. Think how great a blessing is a timely death,\nhow many have been injured by living longer than they ought. If\nsickness had carried off that glory and support of the empire,\nGnaeus Pompeius, at Naples, he would have died the undoubted head\nof the Roman people, but as it was, a short extension of time cast\nhim down from his pinnacle of fame: he beheld his legions slaughtered\nbefore his eyes: and what a sad relic of that battle, in which the\nSenate formed the first line, was the survival of the general. He\nsaw his Egyptian butcher, and offered his body, hallowed by so many\nvictories, to a guardsman\u2019s sword, although even had he been unhurt,\nhe would have regretted his safety: for what could have been more\ninfamous than that a Pompeius should owe his life to the clemency\nof a king? If Marcus Cicero had fallen at the time when he avoided\nthose daggers which Catiline aimed equally at him and at his country,\nhe might have died as the saviour of the commonwealth which he had\nset free: if his death had even followed upon that of his daughter,\nhe might have died happy. He would not then have seen swords drawn\nfor the slaughter of Roman citizens, the goods of the murdered\ndivided among the murderers that men might pay from their own purse\nthe price of their {193} own blood, the public auction of the\nconsul\u2019s spoil in the civil war, the public letting out of murder\nto be done, brigandage, war, pillage, hosts of Catilines. Would it\nnot have been a good thing for Marcus Cato if the sea had swallowed\nhim up when he was returning from Cyprus after sequestrating the\nking\u2019s hereditary possessions, even if that very money which he was\nbringing to pay the soldiers in the civil war had been lost with\nhim? He certainly would have been able to boast that no one would\ndare to do wrong in the presence of Cato: as it was, the extension\nof his life for a very few more years forced one who was born for\npersonal and political freedom to flee from Caesar and to become\nPompeius\u2019s follower. Premature death therefore did him no evil:\nindeed, it put an end to the power of any evil to hurt him.\nXXI. \u201cYet,\u201d say you, \u201che perished too soon and untimely.\u201d In the\nfirst place, suppose that he had lived to extreme old age: let him\ncontinue alive to the extreme limits of human existence: how much\nis it after all? Born for a very brief space of time, we regard\nthis life as an inn which we are soon to quit that it may be made\nready for the coming guest. Do I speak of our lives, which we know\nroll away incredibly fast? Reckon up the centuries of cities: you\nwill find that even those which boast of their antiquity have not\nexisted for long. All human works are brief and fleeting; they take\nup no part whatever of infinite time. Tried by the standard of the\nuniverse, we regard this earth of ours, with all its cities, nations,\nrivers, and sea-board as a mere point: our life occupies less than\na point when compared with all time, the measure of which exceeds\nthat of the world, for indeed the world is contained many times in\nit. Of what importance, then, can it be to lengthen that which,\nhowever much you add to it, will never be much more than nothing?\nWe can only make our lives long by one expedient, that is, by being\n{194} satisfied with their length: you may tell me of long-lived\nmen, whose length of days has been celebrated by tradition, you may\nassign a hundred and ten years apiece to them: yet when you allow\nyour mind to conceive the idea of eternity, there will be no\ndifference between the shortest and the longest life, if you compare\nthe time during which any one has been alive with that during which\nhe has not been alive. In the next place, when he died his life was\ncomplete: he had lived as long as he needed to live: there was\nnothing left for him to accomplish. All men do not grow old at the\nsame age, nor indeed do all animals: some are wearied out by life\nat fourteen years of age, and what is only the first stage of life\nwith man is their extreme limit of longevity. To each man a varying\nlength of days has been assigned: no one dies before his time,\nbecause he was not destined to live any longer than he did. Everyone\u2019s\nend is fixed, and will always remain where it has been placed:\nneither industry nor favour will move it on any further. Believe,\nthen, that you lost him by advice: he took all that was his own,\n\u201cAnd reached the goal allotted to his life,\u201d\nso you need not burden yourself with the thought, \u201cHe might have\nlived longer.\u201d His life has not been cut short, nor does chance\never cut short our years: every man receives as much as was promised\nto him: the Fates go their own way, and neither add anything nor\ntake away anything from what they have once promised. Prayers and\nendeavours are all in vain: each man will have as much life as his\nfirst day placed to his credit: from the time when he first saw the\nlight he has entered on the path that leads to death, and is drawing\nnearer to his doom: those same years which were added to his youth\nwere subtracted from his life. We all fall into this mistake of\nsupposing that it is only old men, already in the decline of life,\nwho are drawing {195} near to death, whereas our first infancy, our\nyouth, indeed every time of life leads thither. The Fates ply their\nown work: they take from us the consciousness of our death, and,\nthe better to conceal its approaches, death lurks under the very\nnames we give to life: infancy changes into boyhood, maturity\nswallows up the boy, old age the man; these stages themselves, if\nyou reckon them properly, are so many losses.\nXXII. Do you complain, Marcia, that your son did not live as long\nas he might have done? How do you know that it was to his advantage\nto live longer? whether his interest was not served by this death?\nWhom can you find at the present time whose fortunes are grounded\non such sure foundations that they have nothing to fear in the\nfuture? All human affairs are evanescent and perishable, nor is any\npart of our life so frail and liable to accident as that which we\nespecially enjoy. We ought, therefore, to pray for death when our\nfortune is at its best, because so great is the uncertainty and\nturmoil in which we live, that we can be sure of nothing but what\nis past. Think of your son\u2019s handsome person, which you had guarded\nin perfect purity among all the temptations of a voluptuous capital.\nWho could have undertaken to keep that clear of all diseases, so\nthat it might preserve its beauty of form unimpaired even to old\nage? Think of the many taints of the mind: for fine dispositions\ndo not always continue to their life\u2019s end to make good the promise\nof their youth, but have often broken down: either extravagance,\nall the more shameful for being indulged in late in life, takes\npossession of men and makes their well-begun lives end in disgrace,\nor they devote their entire thoughts to the eating-house and the\nbelly, and they become interested in nothing save what they shall\neat and what they shall drink. Add to this conflagrations, falling\nhouses, shipwrecks, the agonizing operations of surgeons, who cut\n{196} pieces of bone out of men\u2019s living bodies, plunge their whole\nhands into their entrails, and inflict more than one kind of pain\nto effect the cure of shameful diseases. After these comes exile;\nyour son was not more innocent than Rutilius: imprisonment; he was\nnot wiser than Socrates: the piercing of one\u2019s breast by a\nself-inflicted wound; he was not of holier life than Cato. When you\nlook at these examples, you will perceive that nature deals very\nkindly with those whom she puts speedily in a place of safety because\nthere awaited them the payment of some such price as this for their\nlives. Nothing is so deceptive, nothing is so treacherous as human\nlife; by Hercules, were it not given to men before they could form\nan opinion, no one would take it. Not to be born, therefore, is the\nhappiest lot of all, and the nearest thing to this, I imagine, is\nthat we should soon finish our strife here and be restored again\nto our former rest. Recall to your mind that time, so painful to\nyou, during which Sejanus handed over your father as a present to\nhis client Satrius Secundus: he was angry with him about something\nor other which he had said with too great freedom, because he was\nnot able to keep silence and see Sejanus climbing up to take his\nseat upon our necks, which would have been bad enough had he been\nplaced there by his master. He was decreed the honour of a statue,\nto be set up in the theatre of Pompeius, which had been burned down\nand was being restored by Caesar. Cordus exclaimed that \u201cNow the\ntheatre was really destroyed.\u201d What then? should he not burst with\nspite at a Sejanus being set up over the ashes of Gnaeus Pompeius,\nat a faithless soldier being commemorated within the memorial of a\nconsummate commander? The inscription was put up:[12] and those\nkeen-scented {197} hounds whom Sejanus used to feed on human blood,\nto make them tame towards himself and fierce to all the world beside,\nbegan to bay around their victim and even to make premature snaps\nat him. What was he to do? If he chose to live, he must gain the\nconsent of Sejanus; if to die, he must gain that of his daughter;\nand neither of them could have been persuaded to grant it: he\ntherefore determined to deceive his daughter, and having taken a\nbath in order to weaken himself still further, he retired to his\nbed-chamber on the pretence of taking a meal there. After dismissing\nhis slaves he threw some of the food out of the window, that he\nmight appear to have eaten it: then he took no supper, making the\nexcuse that he had already had enough food in his chamber. This he\ncontinued to do on the second and the third day: the fourth betrayed\nhis condition by his bodily weakness; so, embracing you, \u201cMy dearest\ndaughter,\u201d said he, \u201cfrom whom I have never throughout your whole\nlife concealed aught but this, I have begun my journey towards\ndeath, and have already travelled half-way thither. You cannot and\nyou ought not to call me back.\u201d So saying he ordered all light to\nbe excluded from the room and shut himself up in the darkness. When\nhis determination became known there was a general feeling of\npleasure at the prey being snatched out of the jaws of those ravening\nwolves. His prosecutors, at the instance of Sejanus, went to the\njudgment-seat of the consuls, complained that Cordus was dying, and\nbegged the consuls to interpose to prevent his doing what they\nthemselves had driven him to do; so true was it that Cordus appeared\nto them to be escaping: an important matter was at stake, namely,\nwhether the accused should lose the right to die. While this point\nwas being debated, and the prosecutors were going to attend the\ncourt a second time, he had set himself free from them. Do you see,\nMarcia, how suddenly evil days come upon a man? {198} and do you\nweep because one of your family could not avoid dying? one of your\nfamily was within a very little of not being allowed to die.\nXXIII. Besides the fact that everything that is future is uncertain,\nand the only certainty is that it is more likely to turn out ill\nthan well, our spirits find the path to the Gods above easiest when\nit is soon allowed to leave the society of mankind, because it has\nthen contracted fewest impurities to weigh it down: if set free\nbefore they become hardened worldlings, before earthly things have\nsunk too deep into them, they fly all the more lightly back to the\nplace from whence they came, and all the more easily wash away the\nstains and defilements which they may have contracted. Great minds\nnever love to linger long in the body: they are eager to burst its\nbonds and escape from it, they chafe at the narrowness of their\nprison, having been wont to wander through space, and from aloft\nin the upper air to look down with contempt upon human affairs.\nHence it is that Plato declares that the wise man\u2019s mind is entirely\ngiven up to death, longs for it, contemplates it, and through his\neagerness for it is always striving after things which lie beyond\nthis life. Why, Marcia, when you saw him while yet young displaying\nthe wisdom of age, with a mind that could rise superior to all\nsensual enjoyments, faultless and without a blemish, able to win\nriches without greediness, public office without ambition, pleasure\nwithout extravagance, did you suppose it would long be your lot to\nkeep him safe by your side? Whatever has arrived at perfection, is\nripe for dissolution. Consummate virtue flees away and betakes\nitself out of our sight, and those things which come to maturity\nin the first stage of their being do not wait for the last. The\nbrighter a fire glows, the sooner it goes out: it lasts longer when\nit is made up with bad and slowly burning fuel, and shows a dull\nlight through a cloud of smoke: its being poorly fed {199} makes\nit linger all the longer. So also the more brilliant men\u2019s minds,\nthe shorter lived they are: for when there is no room for further\ngrowth, the end is near. Fabianus tells us, what our parents\nthemselves have seen, that there was at Rome a boy of gigantic\nstature, exceeding that of a man: but he soon died, and every\nsensible person always said that he would soon die, for he could\nnot live to reach the age which he had assumed before it was due.\nSo it is: too complete maturity is a proof that destruction is near,\nand the end approaches when growth is over.\nXXIV. Begin to reckon his age, not by years, but by virtues: he\nlived long enough. He was left as a ward in the care of guardians\nup to his fourteenth year, and never passed out of that of his\nmother: when he had a household of his own he was loth to leave\nyours, and continued to dwell under his mother\u2019s roof, though few\nsons can endure to live under their father\u2019s. Though a youth whose\nheight, beauty, and vigour of body destined him for the army, yet\nhe refused to serve, that he might not be separated from you.\nConsider, Marcia, how seldom mothers who live in separate houses\nsee their children: consider how they lose and pass in anxiety all\nthose years during which they have sons in the army, and you will\nsee that this time, none of which you lost, was of considerable\nextent: he never went out of your sight: it was under your eyes\nthat he applied himself to the cultivation of an admirable intellect\nand one which would have rivalled that of his grandfather, had it\nnot been hindered by shyness, which has concealed many men\u2019s\naccomplishments: though a youth of unusual beauty, and living among\nsuch throngs of women who made it their business to seduce men, he\ngratified the wishes of none of them, and when the effrontery of\nsome led them so far as actually to tempt him, he blushed as deeply\nat having found favour in their eyes as though he had been guilty.\nBy this holiness of life he caused himself, while yet quite a {200}\nboy, to be thought worthy of the priesthood, which no doubt he owed\nto his mother\u2019s influence; but even his mother\u2019s influence would\nhave had no weight if the candidate for whom it was exerted had\nbeen unfit for the post. Dwell upon these virtues, and nurse your\nson as it were in your lap: now he is more at leisure to respond\nto your caresses, he has nothing to call him away from you, he will\nnever be an anxiety or a sorrow to you. You have grieved at the\nonly grief so good a son could cause you: all else is beyond the\npower of fortune to harm, and is full of pleasure, if only you know\nhow to make use of your son, if you do but know what his most\nprecious quality was. It is merely the outward semblance of your\nson that has perished, his likeness, and that not a very good one;\nhe himself is immortal, and is now in a far better state, set free\nfrom the burden of all that was not his own, and left simply by\nhimself: all this apparatus which you see about us of bones and\nsinews, this covering of skin, this face, these our servants the\nhands, and all the rest of our environment, are but chains and\ndarkness to the soul: they overwhelm it, choke it, corrupt it, fill\nit with false ideas, and keep it at a distance from its own true\nsphere: it has to struggle continually against this burden of the\nflesh, lest it be dragged down and sunk by it. It ever strives to\nrise up again to the place from whence it was sent down on earth:\nthere eternal rest awaits it, there it will behold what is pure and\nclear, in place of what is foul and turbid.\nXXV. You need not, therefore, hasten to the burial-place of your\nson: that which lies there is but the worst part of him and that\nwhich gave him most trouble, only bones and ashes, which are no\nmore parts of him than clothes or other coverings of his body. He\nis complete, and without leaving any part of himself behind on earth\nhas taken wing and gone away altogether: he has tarried a brief\nspace above us while his soul was being cleansed {201} and purified\nfrom the vices and rust which all mortal lives must contract, and\nfrom thence he will rise to the high heavens and join the souls of\nthe blessed: a saintly company will welcome him thither,\u2014Scipios\nand Catos; and among the rest of those who have held life cheap and\nset themselves free, thanks to death, albeit all there are alike\nakin, your father, Marcia, will embrace his grandson as he rejoices\nin the unwonted light, will teach him the motion of the stars which\nare so near to them, and introduce him with joy into all the secrets\nof nature, not by guesswork but by real knowledge. Even as a stranger\nis grateful to one who shows him the way about an unknown city, so\nis a searcher after the causes of what he sees in the heavens to\none of his own family who can explain them to him. He will delight\nin gazing deep down upon the earth, for it is a delight to look\nfrom aloft at what one has left below. Bear yourself, therefore,\nMarcia, as though you were placed before the eyes of your father\nand your son, yet not such as you knew them, but far loftier beings,\nplaced in a higher sphere. Blush, then, to do any mean or common\naction, or to weep for those your relatives who have been changed\nfor the better. Free to roam through the open, boundless realms of\nthe everliving universe, they are not hindered in their course by\nintervening seas, lofty mountains, impassable valleys, or the\ntreacherous fiats of the Syrtes: they find a level path everywhere,\nare swift and ready of motion, and are permeated in their turn by\nthe stars and dwell together with them.\nXXVI. Imagine then, Marcia, that your father, whose influence over\nyou was as great as yours over your son, no longer in that frame\nof mind in which he deplored the civil wars, or in which he for\never proscribed those who would have proscribed him, but in a mood\nas much more joyful as his abode now is higher than of old, is\nsaying, as {202} he looks down from the height of heaven, \u201cMy\ndaughter, why does this sorrow possess you for so long? why do you\nlive in such ignorance of the truth, as to think that your son has\nbeen unfairly dealt with because he has returned to his ancestors\nin his prime, without decay of body or mind, leaving his family\nflourishing? Do you not know with what storms Fortune unsettles\neverything? how she proves kind and compliant to none save to those\nwho have the fewest possible dealings with her? Need I remind you\nof kings who would have been the happiest of mortals had death\nsooner withdrawn them from the ruin which was approaching them? or\nof Roman generals, whose greatness, had but a few years been taken\nfrom their lives, would have wanted nothing to render it complete?\nor of men of the highest distinction and noblest birth who have\ncalmly offered their necks to the stroke of a soldier\u2019s sword? Look\nat your father and your grandfather: the former fell into the hands\nof a foreign murderer: I allowed no man to take any liberties with\nme, and by abstinence from food showed that my spirit was as great\nas my writings had represented it. Why, then, should that member\nof our household who died most happily of all be mourned in it the\nlongest? We have all assembled together, and, not being plunged in\nutter darkness, we see that with you on earth there is nothing to\nbe wished for, nothing grand or magnificent, but all is mean, sad,\nanxious, and hardly receives a fractional part of the clear light\nin which we dwell. I need not say that here are no frantic charges\nof rival armies, no fleets shattering one another, no parricides,\nactual or meditated, no courts where men babble over lawsuits for\ndays together, here is nothing underhand, all hearts and minds are\nopen and unveiled, our life is public and known to all, and that\nwe command a view of all time and of things to come. I used to take\npleasure in compiling the history of what took place in one century\namong {203} a few people in the most out-of-the-way corner of the\nworld: here I enjoy the spectacle of all the centuries, the whole\nchain of events from age to age as long as years have been. I may\nview kingdoms when they rise and when they fall, and behold the\nruin of cities and the new channels made by the sea. If it will be\nany consolation to you in your bereavement to know that it is the\ncommon lot of all, be assured that nothing will continue to stand\nin the place in which it now stands, but that time will lay everything\nlow and bear it away with itself: it will sport, not only with\nmen\u2014for how small a part are they of the dominion of Fortune? \u2014but\nwith districts, provinces, quarters of the world: it will efface\nentire mountains, and in other places will pile new rocks on high:\nit will dry up seas, change the course of rivers, destroy the\nintercourse of nation with nation, and break up the communion and\nfellowship of the human race: in other regions it will swallow up\ncities by opening vast chasms in the earth, will shake them with\nearthquakes, will breathe forth pestilence from the nether world,\ncover all habitable ground with inundations and destroy every\ncreature in the flooded world, or burn up all mortals by a huge\nconflagration. When the time shall arrive for the world to be brought\nto an end, that it may begin its life anew, all the forces of nature\nwill perish in conflict with one another, the stars will be dashed\ntogether, and all the lights which now gleam in regular order in\nvarious parts of the sky will then blaze in one fire with all their\nfuel burning at once. Then we also, the souls of the blest and the\nheirs of eternal life, whenever God thinks fit to reconstruct the\nuniverse, when all things are settling down again, we also, being\na small accessory to the universal wreck,[13] shall be changed into\nour old elements. Happy is your son, Marcia, in that he already\nknows this.\u201d\n[1] See Merivale\u2019s \u201cHistory of the Romans under the Empire,\u201d ch.\nxlv.\n[2] If it is a pain to dwell upon the thought of lost friends, of\ncourse you do not continually refresh the memory of them by speaking\nof them.\n[3] See my note on _invidiam facere alicui_ in Juv. 15.\u2014J.

ANNAEUS SENECA, ADDRESSED\nTO GALLIO.\nOF A HAPPY LIFE.\nI. All men, brother Gallio, wish to live happily, but are dull at\nperceiving exactly what it is that makes life happy: and so far is\nit from being easy to attain to happiness that the more eagerly a\nman struggles to reach it the further he departs from it, if he\ntakes the wrong road; for, since this leads in the opposite direction,\nhis very swiftness carries him all the further away. We must therefore\nfirst define clearly what it is at which we aim: next we must\nconsider by what path we may most speedily reach it, for on our\njourney itself, provided it be made in the right direction, we shall\nlearn how much progress we have made each day, and how much nearer\nwe are to the goal towards which our natural desires urge us. But\nas long as we wander at random, not following any guide except the\nshouts and discordant clamours of those who invite us to proceed\nin different directions, our short life will be wasted in useless\nroamings, even if we labour both day and night to get a good\nunderstanding. Let us not therefore decide whither we must tend,\nand by what path, without the advice of some experienced person who\nhas explored the region which we are about to enter, because this\n{205} journey is not subject to the same conditions as others; for\nin them some distinctly understood track and inquiries made of the\nnatives make it impossible for us to go wrong, but here the most\nbeaten and frequented tracks are those which lead us most astray.\nNothing, therefore, is more important than that we should not, like\nsheep, follow the flock that has gone before us, and thus proceed\nnot whither we ought, but whither the rest are going. Now nothing\ngets us into greater troubles than our subservience to common rumour,\nand our habit of thinking that those things are best which are most\ngenerally received as such, of taking many counterfeits for truly\ngood things, and of living not by reason but by imitation of others.\nThis is the cause of those great heaps into which men rush till\nthey are piled one upon another. In a great crush of people, when\nthe crowd presses upon itself, no one can fall without drawing some\none else down upon him, and those who go before cause the destruction\nof those who follow them. You may observe the same thing in human\nlife: no one can merely go wrong by himself, but he must become\nboth the cause and adviser of another\u2019s wrongdoing. It is harmful\nto follow the march of those who go before us, and since every one\nhad rather believe another than form his own opinion, we never pass\na deliberate judgment upon life, but some traditional error always\nentangles us and brings us to ruin, and we perish because we follow\nother men\u2019s examples: we should be cured of this if we were to\ndisengage ourselves from the herd; but as it is, the mob is ready\nto fight against reason in defence of its own mistake. Consequently\nthe same thing happens as at elections, where, when the fickle\nbreeze of popular favour has veered round, those who have been\nchosen consuls and praetors are viewed with admiration by the very\nmen who made them so. That we should all approve and disapprove of\nthe same things is the end of every {206} decision which is given\naccording to the voice of the majority.\nII. When we are considering a happy life, you cannot answer me as\nthough after a division of the House, \u201cThis view has most supporters;\u201d\nbecause for that very reason it is the worse of the two: matters\ndo not stand so well with mankind that the majority should prefer\nthe better course: the more people do a thing the worse it is likely\nto be. Let us therefore inquire, not what is most commonly done,\nbut what is best for us to do, and what will establish us in the\npossession of undying happiness, not what is approved of by the\nvulgar, the worst possible exponents of truth. By \u201cthe vulgar\u201d I\nmean both those who wear woollen cloaks and those who wear crowns;[1]\nfor I do not regard the colour of the clothes with which they are\ncovered: I do not trust my eyes to tell me what a man is: I have a\nbetter and more trustworthy light by which I can distinguish what\nis true from what is false: let the mind find out what is good for\nthe mind. If a man ever allows his mind some breathing space and\nhas leisure for communing with himself, what truths he will confess\nto himself, after having been put to the torture by his own self!\nHe will say, \u201cWhatever I have hitherto done I wish were undone:\nwhen I think over what I have said, I envy dumb people: whatever I\nhave longed for seems to have been what my enemies would pray might\nbefall me: good heaven, how far more endurable what I have feared\nseems to be than what I have lusted after. I have been at enmity\nwith many men, and have changed my dislike of them into friendship,\nif friendship can exist between bad men: yet I have not yet become\nreconciled to myself. I have striven with all my strength to raise\nmyself above the {207} common herd, and to make myself remarkable\nfor some talent: what have I effected save to make myself a mark\nfor the arrows of my enemies, and show those who hate me where to\nwound me? Do you see those who praise your eloquence, who covet\nyour wealth, who court your favour, or who vaunt your power? All\nthese either are, or, which comes to the same thing, may be your\nenemies: the number of those who envy you is as great as that of\nthose who admire you; why do I not rather seek for some good thing\nwhich I can use and feel, not one which I can show? these good\nthings which men gaze at in wonder, which they crowd to see, which\none points out to another with speechless admiration, are outwardly\nbrilliant, but within are miseries to those who possess them.\u201d\nIII. Let us seek for some blessing, which does not merely look fine,\nbut is sound and good throughout alike, and most beautiful in the\nparts which are least seen: let us unearth this. It is not far\ndistant from us; it can be discovered: all that is necessary is to\nknow whither to stretch out your hand: but, as it is, we behave as\nthough we were in the dark, and reach out beyond what is nearest\nto us, striking as we do so against the very things that we want.\nHowever, that I may not draw you into digressions, I will pass over\nthe opinions of other philosophers, because it would take a long\ntime to state and confute them all: take ours. When, however, I say\n\u201cours,\u201d I do not bind myself to any one of the chiefs of the Stoic\nschool, for I too have a right to form my own opinion. I shall,\ntherefore, follow the authority of some of them, but shall ask some\nothers to discriminate their meaning:[2] perhaps, when after having\n{208} reported all their opinions, I am asked for my own, I shall\nimpugn none of my predecessors\u2019 decisions, and shall say, \u201cI will\nalso add somewhat to them.\u201d Meanwhile I follow nature, which is a\npoint upon which every one of the Stoic philosophers are agreed:\ntrue wisdom consists in not departing from nature and in moulding\nour conduct according to her laws and model. A happy life, therefore,\nis one which is in accordance with its own nature, and cannot be\nbrought about unless in the first place the mind be sound and remain\nso without interruption, and next, be bold and vigorous, enduring\nall things with most admirable courage, suited to the times in which\nit lives, careful of the body and its appurtenances, yet not\ntroublesomely careful. It must also set due value upon all the\nthings which adorn our lives, without over-estimating any one of\nthem, and must be able to enjoy the bounty of Fortune without\nbecoming her slave. You understand without my mentioning it that\nan unbroken calm and freedom ensue, when we have driven away all\nthose things which either excite us or alarm us: for in the place\nof sensual pleasures and those slight perishable matters which are\nconnected with the basest crimes, we thus gain an immense, unchangeable,\nequable joy, together with peace, calmness and greatness of mind,\nand kindliness: for all savageness is a sign of weakness.\nIV. Our highest good may also be defined otherwise, that is to say,\nthe same idea may be expressed in different language. Just as the\nsame army may at one time be extended more widely, at another\ncontracted into a smaller compass, and may either be curved towards\nthe wings by a depression in the line of the centre, or drawn up\nin a straight line, while, in whatever figure it be arrayed, its\n{209} strength and loyalty remain unchanged; so also our definition\nof the highest good may in some cases be expressed diffusely and\nat great length, while in others it is put into a short and concise\nform. Thus, it will come to the same thing, if I say \u201cThe highest\ngood is a mind which despises the accidents of fortune, and takes\npleasure in virtue\u201d: or, \u201cIt is an unconquerable strength of mind,\nknowing the world well, gentle in its dealings, showing great\ncourtesy and consideration for those with whom it is brought into\ncontact.\u201d Or we may choose to define it by calling that man happy\nwho knows good and bad only in the form of good or bad minds: who\nworships honour, and is satisfied with his own virtue, who is neither\npuffed up by good fortune nor cast down by evil fortune, who knows\nno other good than that which he is able to bestow upon himself,\nwhose real pleasure lies in despising pleasures. If you choose to\npursue this digression further, you can put this same idea into\nmany other forms, without impairing or weakening its meaning: for\nwhat prevents our saying that a happy life consists in a mind which\nis free, upright, undaunted, and steadfast, beyond the influence\nof fear or desire, which thinks nothing good except honour, and\nnothing bad except shame, and regards everything else as a mass of\nmean details which can neither add anything to nor take anything\naway from the happiness of life, but which come and go without\neither increasing or diminishing the highest good? A man of these\nprinciples, whether he will or no, must be accompanied by a continual\ncheerfulness, a high happiness, which comes indeed from on high\nbecause he delights in what he has, and desires no greater pleasures\nthan those which his home affords. Is he not right in allowing these\nto turn the scale against petty, ridiculous, and shortlived movements\nof his wretched body? on the day on which he becomes proof against\npleasure he also becomes proof against pain. See, on the other hand,\nhow {210} evil and guilty a slavery the man is forced to serve who\nis dominated in turn by pleasures and pains, those most untrustworthy\nand passionate of masters. We must, therefore, escape from them\ninto freedom. This nothing will bestow upon us save contempt of\nFortune: but if we attain to this, then there will dawn upon us\nthose invaluable blessings, the repose of a mind that is at rest\nin a safe haven, its lofty imaginings, its great and steady delight\nat casting out errors and learning to know the truth, its courtesy,\nand its cheerfulness, in all of which we shall take delight, not\nregarding them as good things, but as proceeding from the proper\ngood of man.\nV. Since I have begun to make my definitions without a too strict\nadherence to the letter, a man may be called \u201chappy\u201d who, thanks\nto reason, has ceased either to hope or to fear: but rocks also\nfeel neither fear nor sadness, nor do cattle, yet no one would call\nthose things happy which cannot comprehend what happiness is. With\nthem you may class men whose dull nature and want of self-knowledge\nreduces them to the level of cattle, mere animals: there is no\ndifference between the one and the other, because the latter have\nno reason, while the former have only a corrupted form of it, crooked\nand cunning to their own hurt. For no one can be styled happy who\nis beyond the influence of truth: and consequently a happy life is\nunchangeable, and is founded upon a true and trustworthy discernment;\nfor the mind is uncontaminated and freed from all evils only when\nit is able to escape not merely from wounds but also from scratches,\nwhen it will always be able to maintain the position which it has\ntaken up, and defend it even against the angry assaults of Fortune:\nfor with regard to sensual pleasures, though they were to surround\none on every side, and use every means of assault, trying to win\nover the mind by caresses and making trial of every conceivable\nstratagem to attract either our entire selves or {211} our separate\nparts, yet what mortal that retains any traces of human origin would\nwish to be tickled day and night, and, neglecting his mind, to\ndevote himself to bodily enjoyments?\nVI. \u201cBut,\u201d says our adversary, \u201cthe mind also will have pleasures\nof its own.\u201d Let it have them, then, and let it sit in judgment\nover luxury and pleasures; let it indulge itself to the full in all\nthose matters which give sensual delights: then let it look back\nupon what it enjoyed before, and with all those faded sensualities\nfresh in its memory let it rejoice and look eagerly forward to those\nother pleasures which it experienced long ago, and intends to\nexperience again, and while the body lies in helpless repletion in\nthe present, let it send its thoughts onward towards the future,\nand take stock of its hopes: all this will make it appear, in my\nopinion, yet more wretched, because it is insanity to choose evil\ninstead of good: now no insane person can be happy, and no one can\nbe sane if he regards what is injurious as the highest good and\nstrives to obtain it. The happy man, therefore, is he who can make\na right judgment in all things: he is happy who in his present\ncircumstances, whatever they may be, is satisfied and on friendly\nterms with the conditions of his life. That man is happy, whose\nreason recommends to him the whole posture of his affairs.\nVII. Even those very people who declare the highest good to be in\nthe belly, see what a dishonourable position they have assigned to\nit: and therefore they say that pleasure cannot be parted from\nvirtue, and that no one can either live honourably without living\ncheerfully, nor yet live cheerfully without living honourably. I\ndo not see how these very different matters can have any connexion\nwith one another. What is there, I pray you, to prevent virtue\nexisting apart from pleasure? of course the reason is that all good\nthings derive their origin from virtue, and therefore even those\nthings which you cherish and seek for {212} come originally from\nits roots. Yet, if they were entirely inseparable, we should not\nsee some things to be pleasant, but not honourable, and others most\nhonourable indeed, but hard and only to be attained by suffering.\nAdd to this, that pleasure visits the basest lives, but virtue\ncannot co-exist with an evil life; yet some unhappy people are not\nwithout pleasure, nay, it is owing to pleasure itself that they are\nunhappy; and this could not take place if pleasure had any connexion\nwith virtue, whereas virtue is often without pleasure, and never\nstands in need of it. Why do you put together two things which are\nunlike and even incompatible one with another? virtue is a lofty\nquality, sublime, royal, unconquerable, untiring: pleasure is low,\nslavish, weakly, perishable; its haunts and homes are the brothel\nand the tavern. You will meet virtue in the temple, the market-place,\nthe senate house, manning the walls, covered with dust, sunburnt,\nhorny-handed: you will find pleasure skulking out of sight, seeking\nfor shady nooks at the public baths, hot chambers, and places which\ndread the visits of the aedile, soft, effeminate, reeking of wine\nand perfumes, pale or perhaps painted and made up with cosmetics.\nThe highest good is immortal: it knows no ending, and does not admit\nof either satiety or regret: for a right-thinking mind never alters\nor becomes hateful to itself, nor do the best things ever undergo\nany change: but pleasure dies at the very moment when it charms us\nmost: it has no great scope, and therefore it soon cloys and wearies\nus, and fades away as soon as its first impulse is over: indeed,\nwe cannot depend upon anything whose nature is to change. Consequently\nit is not even possible that there should be any solid substance\nin that which comes and goes so swiftly, and which perishes by the\nvery exercise of its own functions, for it arrives at a point at\nwhich it ceases to be, and even while it is beginning always keeps\nits end in view.\n{213}\nVIII. What answer are we to make to the reflexion that pleasure\nbelongs to good and bad men alike, and that bad men take as much\ndelight in their shame as good men in noble things? This was why\nthe ancients bade us lead the highest, not the most pleasant life,\nin order that pleasure might not be the guide but the companion of\na right-thinking and honourable mind; for it is Nature whom we ought\nto make our guide: let our reason watch her, and be advised by her.\nTo live happily, then, is the same thing as to live according to\nNature: what this may be, I will explain. If we guard the endowments\nof the body and the advantages of nature with care and fearlessness,\nas things soon to depart and given to us only for a day; if we do\nnot fall under their dominion, nor allow ourselves to become the\nslaves of what is no part of our own being; if we assign to all\nbodily pleasures and external delights the same position which is\nheld by auxiliaries and light-armed troops in a camp; if we make\nthem our servants, not our masters\u2014then and then only are they of\nvalue to our minds. A man should be unbiassed and not to be conquered\nby external things: he ought to admire himself alone, to feel\nconfidence in his own spirit, and so to order his life as to be\nready alike for good or for bad fortune. Let not his confidence be\nwithout knowledge, nor his knowledge without steadfastness: let him\nalways abide by what he has once determined, and let there be no\nerasure in his doctrines. It will be understood, even though I\nappend it not, that such a man will be tranquil and composed in his\ndemeanour, high-minded and courteous in his actions. Let reason be\nencouraged by the senses to seek for the truth, and draw its first\nprinciples from thence: indeed it has no other base of operations\nor place from which to start in pursuit of truth: it must fall back\nupon itself. Even the all-embracing universe and God who is its\nguide extends himself forth into outward things, and yet altogether\nreturns from all sides back to {214} himself. Let our mind do the\nsame thing: when, following its bodily senses it has by means of\nthem sent itself forth into the things of the outward world, let\nit remain still their master and its own. By this means we shall\nobtain a strength and an ability which are united and allied together,\nand shall derive from it that reason which never halts between two\nopinions, nor is dull in forming its perceptions, beliefs, or\nconvictions. Such a mind, when it has ranged itself in order, made\nits various parts agree together, and, if I may so express myself,\nharmonized them, has attained to the highest good: for it has nothing\nevil or hazardous remaining, nothing to shake it or make it stumble:\nit will do everything under the guidance of its own will, and nothing\nunexpected will befal it, but whatever may be done by it will turn\nout well, and that, too, readily and easily, without the doer having\nrecourse to any underhand devices: for slow and hesitating action\nare the signs of discord and want of settled purpose. You may, then,\nboldly declare that the highest good is singleness of mind: for\nwhere agreement and unity are, there must the virtues be: it is the\nvices that are at war one with another.\nIX. \u201cBut,\u201d says our adversary, \u201cyou yourself only practise virtue\nbecause you hope to obtain some pleasure from it.\u201d In the first\nplace, even though virtue may afford us pleasure, still we do not\nseek after her on that account: for she does not bestow this, but\nbestows this to boot, nor is this the end for which she labours,\nbut her labour wins this also, although it be directed to another\nend. As in a tilled-field, when ploughed for corn, some flowers are\nfound amongst it, and yet, though these posies may charm the eye,\nall this labour was not spent in order to produce them\u2014the man who\nsowed the field had another object in view, he gained this over and\nabove it\u2014so pleasure is not the reward or the cause of virtue, but\ncomes in addition to it; nor do we choose virtue because she gives\nus pleasure, but {215} she gives us pleasure also if we choose her.\nThe highest good lies in the act of choosing her, and in the attitude\nof the noblest minds, which when once it has fulfilled its function\nand established itself within its own limits has attained to the\nhighest good, and needs nothing more: for there is nothing outside\nof the whole, any more than there is anything beyond the end. You\nare mistaken, therefore, when you ask me what it is on account of\nwhich I seek after virtue: for you are seeking for something above\nthe highest. Do you ask what I seek from virtue? I answer. Herself:\nfor she has nothing better; she is her own reward. Does this not\nappear great enough, when I tell you that the highest good is an\nunyielding strength of mind, wisdom, magnanimity, sound judgment,\nfreedom, harmony, beauty? Do you still ask me for something greater,\nof which these may be regarded as the attributes? Why do you talk\nof pleasures to me? I am seeking to find what is good for man, not\nfor his belly; why, cattle and whales have larger ones than he.\nX. \u201cYou purposely misunderstand what I say,\u201d says he, \u201cfor I too\nsay that no one can live pleasantly unless he lives honorably also,\nand this cannot be the case with dumb animals who measure the extent\nof their happiness by that of their food. I loudly and publicly\nproclaim that what I call a pleasant life cannot exist without the\naddition of virtue.\u201d Yet who does not know that the greatest fools\ndrink the deepest of those pleasures of yours? or that vice is full\nof enjoyments, and that the mind itself suggests to itself many\nperverted, vicious forms of pleasure?\u2014in the first place arrogance,\nexcessive self-esteem, swaggering precedence over other men, a\nshortsighted, nay, a blind devotion to his own interests, dissolute\nluxury, excessive delight springing from the most trifling and\nchildish causes, and also talkativeness, pride that takes a pleasure\nin insulting others, sloth, and the decay of a dull mind which goes\nto sleep over itself. All these are dissipated by virtue, which\nplucks a {216} man by the ear, and measures the value of pleasures\nbefore she permits them to be used; nor does she set much store by\nthose which she allows to pass current, for she merely allows their\nuse, and her cheerfulness is not due to her use of them, but to her\nmoderation in using them. \u201cYet when moderation lessens pleasure,\nit impairs the highest good.\u201d You devote yourself to pleasures, I\ncheck them; you indulge in pleasure, I use it; you think that it\nis the highest good, I do not even think it to be good: for the\nsake of pleasure I do nothing, you do everything.\nXI. When I say that I do nothing for the sake of pleasure, I allude\nto that wise man, whom alone you admit to be capable of pleasure:\nnow I do not call a man wise who is overcome by anything, let alone\nby pleasure: yet, if engrossed by pleasure, how will he resist toil,\ndanger, want, and all the ills which surround and threaten the life\nof man? How will he bear the sight of death or of pain? How will\nhe endure the tumult of the world, and make head against so many\nmost active foes, if he be conquered by so effeminate an antagonist?\nHe will do whatever pleasure advises him: well, do you not see how\nmany things it will advise him to do? \u201cIt will not,\u201d says our\nadversary, \u201cbe able to give him any bad advice, because it is\ncombined with virtue?\u201d Again, do you not see what a poor kind of\nhighest good that must be which requires a guardian to ensure its\nbeing good at all? and how is virtue to rule pleasure if she follows\nit, seeing that to follow is the duty of a subordinate, to rule\nthat of a commander? do you put that which commands in the background?\nAccording to your school, virtue has the dignified office of\npreliminary taster of pleasures. We shall, however, see whether\nvirtue still remains virtue among those who treat her with such\ncontempt, for if she leaves her proper station she can no longer\nkeep her proper name: in the meanwhile, to keep to the point, I\nwill show you many men beset by pleasures, {217} men upon whom\nFortune has showered all her gifts, whom you must needs admit to\nbe bad men. Look at Nomentanus and Apicius, who digest all the good\nthings, as they call them, of the sea and land, and review upon\ntheir tables the whole animal kingdom. Look at them as they lie on\nbeds of roses gloating over their banquet, delighting their ears\nwith music, their eyes with exhibitions, their palates with flavours:\ntheir whole bodies are titillated with soft and soothing applications,\nand lest even their nostrils should be idle, the very place in\nwhich, they solemnize[3] the rites of luxury is scented with various\nperfumes. You will say that these men live in the midst of pleasures.\nYet they are ill at ease, because they take pleasure in what is not\ngood.\nXII. \u201cThey are ill at ease,\u201d replies he, \u201cbecause many things arise\nwhich distract their thoughts, and their minds are disquieted by\nconflicting opinions.\u201d I admit that this is true: still these very\nmen, foolish, inconsistent, and certain to feel remorse as they\nare, do nevertheless receive great pleasure, and we must allow that\nin so doing they are as far from feeling any trouble as they are\nfrom forming a right judgment, and that, as is the case with many\npeople, they are possessed by a merry madness, and laugh while they\nrave. The pleasures of wise men, on the other hand, are mild,\ndecorous, verging on dulness, kept under restraint and scarcely\nnoticeable, and are neither invited to come nor received with honour\nwhen they come of their own accord, nor are they welcomed with any\ndelight by those whom they visit, who mix them up with their lives\nand fill up empty spaces with them, like an amusing farce in the\nintervals of serious business. Let them no longer, then, join\nincongruous matters together, or connect pleasure with {218} virtue,\na mistake whereby they court the worst of men. The reckless profligate,\nalways in liquor and belching out the fumes of wine, believes that\nhe lives with virtue, because he knows that he lives with pleasure,\nfor he hears it said that pleasure cannot exist apart from virtue;\nconsequently he dubs his vices with the title of wisdom and parades\nall that he ought to conceal. So, men are not encouraged by Epicurus\nto run riot, but the vicious hide their excesses in the lap of\nphilosophy, and flock to the schools in which they hear the praises\nof pleasure. They do not consider how sober and temperate\u2014for so,\nby Hercules, I believe it to be\u2014that \u201cpleasure\u201d of Epicurus is, but\nthey rush at his mere name, seeking to obtain some protection and\ncloak for their vices. They lose, therefore, the one virtue which\ntheir evil life possessed, that of being ashamed of doing wrong:\nfor they praise what they used to blush at, and boast of their\nvices. Thus modesty can never reassert itself, when shameful idleness\nis dignified with an honourable name. The reason why that praise\nwhich your school lavishes upon pleasure is so hurtful, is because\nthe honourable part of its teaching passes unnoticed, but the\ndegrading part is seen by all.\nXIII. I myself believe, though my Stoic comrades would be unwilling\nto hear me say so, that the teaching of Epicurus was upright and\nholy, and even, if you examine it narrowly, stern: for this much\ntalked of pleasure is reduced to a very narrow compass, and he bids\npleasure submit to the same law which we bid virtue do\u2014I mean, to\nobey nature. Luxury, however, is not satisfied with what is enough\nfor nature. What is the consequence? Whoever thinks that happiness\nconsists in lazy sloth, and alternations of gluttony and profligacy,\nrequires a good patron for a bad action, and when he has become an\nEpicurean, having been led to do so by the attractive name of that\nschool, he follows, not the pleasure which he there hears {219}\nspoken of, but that which he brought thither with him, and, haying\nlearned to think that his vices coincide with the maxims of that\nphilosophy, he indulges in them no longer timidly and in dark\ncorners, but boldly in the face of day. I will not, therefore, like\nmost of our school, say that the sect of Epicurus is the teacher\nof crime, but what I say is: it is ill spoken of, it has a bad\nreputation, and yet it does not deserve it. \u201cWho can know this\nwithout having been admitted to its inner mysteries?\u201d Its very\noutside gives opportunity for scandal, and encourages men\u2019s baser\ndesires: it is like a brave man dressed in a woman\u2019s gown: your\nchastity is assured, your manhood is safe, your body is submitted\nto nothing disgraceful, but your hand holds a drum (like a priest\nof Cybele). Choose, then, some honourable superscription for your\nschool, some writing which shall in itself arouse the mind: that\nwhich at present stands over your door has been invented by the\nvices. He who ranges himself on the side of virtue gives thereby a\nproof of a noble disposition: he who follows pleasure appears to\nbe weakly, worn out, degrading his manhood, likely to fall into\ninfamous vices unless someone discriminates his pleasures for him,\nso that he may know which remain within the bounds of natural desire,\nwhich are frantic and boundless, and become all the more insatiable\nthe more they are satisfied. But come! let virtue lead the way:\nthen every step will be safe. Too much pleasure is hurtful: but\nwith virtue we need fear no excess of any kind, because moderation\nis contained in virtue herself. That which is injured by its own\nextent cannot be a good thing: besides, what better guide can there\nbe than reason for beings endowed with a reasoning nature? so if\nthis combination pleases you, if you are willing to proceed to a\nhappy life thus accompanied, let virtue lead the way, let pleasure\nfollow and hang about the body like a shadow: it is the part of a\nmind incapable of great things to hand {220} over virtue, the highest\nof all qualities, as a handmaid to pleasure.\nXIV. Let virtue lead the way and bear the standard: we shall have\npleasure for all that, but we shall be her masters and controllers;\nshe may win some concessions from us, but will not force us to do\nanything. On the contrary, those who have permitted pleasure to\nlead the van, have neither one nor the other: for they lose virtue\naltogether, and yet they do not possess pleasure, but are possessed\nby it, and are either tortured by its absence or choked by its\nexcess, being wretched if deserted by it, and yet more wretched if\noverwhelmed by it, like those who are caught in the shoals of the\nSyrtes and at one time are left on dry ground and at another tossed\non the flowing waves. This arises from an exaggerated want of\nself-control, and a hidden love of evil: for it is dangerous for\none who seeks after evil instead of good to attain his object. As\nwe hunt wild beasts with toil and peril, and even when they are\ncaught find them an anxious possession, for they often tear their\nkeepers to pieces, even so are great pleasures: they turn out to\nbe great evils and take their owners prisoner. The more numerous\nand the greater they are, the more inferior and the slave of more\nmasters does that man become whom the vulgar call a happy man. I\nmay even press this analogy further: as the man who tracks wild\nanimals to their lairs, and who sets great store on\u2014\n\u201cSeeking with snares the wandering brutes to noose,\u201d\nand\n\u201cMaking their hounds the spacious glade surround,\u201d\nthat he may follow their tracks, neglects far more desirable things,\nand leaves many duties unfulfilled, so he who pursues pleasure\npostpones everything to it, disregards that first essential, liberty,\nand sacrifices it to his belly; nor does he buy pleasure for himself,\nbut sells himself to pleasure.\n{221}\nXV. \u201cBut what,\u201d asks our adversary, \u201cis there to hinder virtue and\npleasure being combined together, and a highest good being thus\nformed, so that honour and pleasure may be the same thing?\u201d Because\nnothing except what is honourable can form a part of honour, and\nthe highest good would lose its purity if it were to see within\nitself anything unlike its own better part. Even the joy which\narises from virtue, although it be a good thing, yet is not a part\nof absolute good, any more than cheerfulness or peace of mind, which\nare indeed good things, but which merely follow the highest good,\nand do not contribute to its perfection, although they are generated\nby the noblest causes. Whoever on the other hand forms an alliance,\nand that, too, a one-sided one, between virtue and pleasure, clogs\nwhatever strength the one may possess by the weakness of the other,\nand sends liberty under the yoke, for liberty can only remain\nunconquered as long as she knows nothing more valuable than herself:\nfor he begins to need the help of Fortune, which is the most utter\nslavery: his life becomes anxious, full of suspicion, timorous,\nfearful of accidents, waiting in agony for critical moments of time.\nYou do not afford virtue a solid immoveable base if you bid it stand\non what is unsteady: and what can be so unsteady as dependence on\nmere chance, and the vicissitudes of the body and of those things\nwhich act on the body? How can such a man obey God and receive\neverything which comes to pass in a cheerful spirit, never complaining\nof fate, and putting a good construction upon everything that befalls\nhim, if he be agitated by the petty pin-pricks of pleasures and\npains? A man cannot be a good protector of his country, a good\navenger of her wrongs, or a good defender of his friends, if he be\ninclined to pleasures. Let the highest good, then, rise to that\nheight from whence no force can dislodge it, whither neither pain\ncan ascend, nor hope, nor fear, nor anything else that can {222}\nimpair the authority of the \u201chighest good.\u201d Thither virtue alone\ncan make her way: by her aid that hill must be climbed: she will\nbravely stand her ground and endure whatever may befal her not only\nresignedly, but even willingly: she will know that all hard times\ncome in obedience to natural laws, and like a good soldier she will\nbear wounds, count scars, and when transfixed and dying will yet\nadore the general for whom she falls: she will bear in mind the old\nmaxim \u201cFollow God.\u201d On the other hand, he who grumbles and complains\nand bemoans himself is nevertheless forcibly obliged to obey orders,\nand is dragged away, however much against his will, to carry them\nout: yet what madness is it to be dragged rather than to follow?\nas great, by Hercules, as it is folly and ignorance of one\u2019s true\nposition to grieve because one has not got something or because\nsomething has caused us rough treatment, or to be surprised or\nindignant at those ills which befall good men as well as bad ones,\nI mean diseases, deaths, illnesses, and the other cross accidents\nof human life. Let us bear with magnanimity whatever the system of\nthe universe makes it needful for us to bear: we are all bound by\nthis oath: \u201cTo bear the ills of mortal life, and to submit with a\ngood grace to what we cannot avoid.\u201d We have been born into a\nmonarchy: our liberty is to obey God.\nXVI. True happiness, therefore, consists in virtue: and what will\nthis virtue bid you do? Not to think anything bad or good which is\nconnected neither with virtue nor with wickedness: and in the next\nplace, both to endure unmoved the assaults of evil, and, as far as\nis right, to form a god out of what is good. What reward does she\npromise you for this campaign? an enormous one, and one that raises\nyou to the level of the gods: you shall be subject to no restraint\nand to no want; you shall be free, safe, unhurt; you shall fail in\nnothing that you attempt; you shall be debarred from nothing;\neverything shall turn out according {223} to your wish; no misfortune\nshall befal you; nothing shall happen to you except what you expect\nand hope for. \u201cWhat! does virtue alone suffice to make you happy?\u201d\nwhy, of course, consummate and god-like virtue such as this not\nonly suffices, but more than suffices: for when a man is placed\nbeyond the reach of any desire, what can he possibly lack? if all\nthat he needs is concentred in himself, how can he require anything\nfrom without? He, however, who is only on the road to virtue,\nalthough he may have made great progress along it, nevertheless\nneeds some favour from fortune while he is still struggling among\nmere human interests, while he is untying that knot, and all the\nbonds which bind him to mortality. What, then, is the difference\nbetween them? it is that some are tied more or less tightly by these\nbonds, and some have even tied themselves with them as well; whereas\nhe who has made progress towards the upper regions and raised himself\nupwards drags a looser chain, and though not yet free, is yet as\ngood as free.\nXVII. If, therefore, any one of those dogs who yelp at philosophy\nwere to say, as they are wont to do, \u201cWhy, then, do you talk so\nmuch more bravely than you live? why do you check your words in the\npresence of your superiors, and consider money to be a necessary\nimplement? why are you disturbed when you sustain losses, and weep\non hearing of the death of your wife or your friend? why do you pay\nregard to common rumour, and feel annoyed by calumnious gossip? why\nis your estate more elaborately kept than its natural use requires?\nwhy do you not dine according to your own maxims? why is your\nfurniture smarter than it need be? why do you drink wine that is\nolder than yourself? why are your grounds laid out? why do you plant\ntrees which afford nothing except shade? why does your wife wear\nin her ears the price of a rich man\u2019s house? why are your children\nat school dressed in costly {224} clothes? why is it a science to\nwait upon you at table? why is your silver plate not set down anyhow\nor at random, but skilfully disposed in regular order, with a\nsuperintendent to preside over the carving of the viands?\u201d Add to\nthis, if you like, the questions \u201cWhy do you own property beyond\nthe seas? why do you own more than you know of? it is a shame to\nyou not to know your slaves by sight: for you must be very neglectful\nof them if you only own a few, or very extravagant if you have too\nmany for your memory to retain.\u201d I will add some reproaches afterwards,\nand will bring more accusations against myself than you think of:\nfor the present I will make you the following answer. \u201cI am not a\nwise man, and I will not be one in order to feed your spite: so do\nnot require me to be on a level with the best of men, but merely\nto be better than the worst: I am satisfied, if every day I take\naway something from my vices and correct my faults. I have not\narrived at perfect soundness of mind, indeed, I never shall arrive\nat it: I compound palliatives rather than remedies for my gout, and\nam satisfied if it comes at rarer intervals and does not shoot so\npainfully. Compared with your feet, which are lame, I am a racer.\u201d\nI make this speech, not on my own behalf, for I am steeped in vices\nof every kind, but on behalf of one who has made some progress in\nvirtue.\nXVIII. \u201cYou talk one way,\u201d objects our adversary, \u201cand live another.\u201d\nYou most spiteful of creatures, you who always show the bitterest\nhatred to the best of men, this reproach was flung at Plato, at\nEpicurus, at Zeno: for all these declared how they ought to live,\nnot how they did live. I speak of virtue, not of myself, and when\nI blame vices, I blame my own first of all: when I have the power,\nI shall live as I ought to do: spite, however deeply steeped in\nvenom, shall not keep me back from what is best: that poison itself\nwith which you bespatter others, with which you choke yourselves,\nshall not hinder me from continuing {225} to praise that life which\nI do not, indeed, lead, but which I know I ought to lead, from\nloving virtue and from following after her, albeit a long way behind\nher and with halting gait. Am I to expect that evil speaking will\nrespect anything, seeing that it respected neither Rutilius nor\nCato? Will any one care about being thought too rich by men for\nwhom Diogenes the Cynic was not poor enough? That most energetic\nphilosopher fought against all the desires of the body, and was\npoorer even than the other Cynics, in that besides haying given up\npossessing anything he had also given up asking for anything: yet\nthey reproached him for not being sufficiently in want: as though\nforsooth it were poverty, not virtue, of which he professed knowledge.\nXIX. They say that Diodorus, the Epicurean philosopher, who within\nthese last few days put an end to his life with his own hand, did\nnot act according to the precepts of Epicurus, in cutting his throat:\nsome choose to regard this act as the result of madness, others of\nrecklessness; he, meanwhile, happy and filled with the consciousness\nof his own goodness, has borne testimony to himself by his manner\nof departing from life, has commended the repose of a life spent\nat anchor in a safe harbour, and has said what you do not like to\nhear, because you too ought to do it:\n\u201cI\u2019ve lived, I\u2019ve run the race which Fortune set me.\u201d\nYou argue about the life and death of another, and yelp at the name\nof men whom some peculiarly noble quality has rendered great, just\nas tiny curs do at the approach of strangers: for it is to your\ninterest that no one should appear to be good, as if virtue in\nanother were a reproach to all your crimes. You enviously compare\nthe glories of others with your own dirty actions, and do not\nunderstand how greatly to your disadvantage it is to venture to do\nso: for if they who follow after virtue be greedy, lustful, {226}\nand fond of power, what must you be, who hate the very name of\nvirtue? You say that no one acts up to his professions, or lives\naccording to the standard which he sets up in his discourses: what\nwonder, seeing that the words which they speak are brave, gigantic,\nand able to weather all the storms which wreck mankind, whereas\nthey themselves are struggling to tear themselves away from crosses\ninto which each one of you is driving his own nail. Yet men who are\ncrucified hang from one single pole, but these who punish themselves\nare divided between as many crosses as they have lusts, but yet are\ngiven to evil speaking, and are so magnificent in their contempt\nof the vices of others that I should suppose that they had none of\ntheir own, were it not that some criminals when on the gibbet spit\nupon the spectators.\nXX. \u201cPhilosophers do not carry into effect all that they teach.\u201d\nNo; but they effect much good by their teaching, by the noble\nthoughts which they conceive in their minds: would, indeed, that\nthey could act up to their talk: what could be happier than they\nwould be? but in the meanwhile you have no right to despise good\nsayings and hearts full of good thoughts. Men deserve praise for\nengaging in profitable studies, even though they stop short of\nproducing any results. Why need we wonder if those who begin to\nclimb a steep path do not succeed in ascending it very high? yet,\nif you be a man, look with respect on those who attempt great things,\neven though they fall. It is the act of a generous spirit to\nproportion its efforts not to its own strength but to that of human\nnature, to entertain lofty aims, and to conceive plans which are\ntoo vast to be carried into execution even by those who are endowed\nwith gigantic intellects, who appoint for themselves the following\nrules: I will look upon death or upon a comedy with the same\nexpression of countenance: I will submit to labours, however great\nthey may be, supporting {227} the strength of my body by that of\nmy mind: I will despise riches when I have them as much as when I\nhave them not; if they be elsewhere I will not be more gloomy, if\nthey sparkle around me I will not be more lively than I should\notherwise be: whether Fortune comes or goes I will take no notice\nof her: I will view all lands as though they belong to me, and my\nown as though they belonged to all mankind: I will so live as to\nremember that I was born for others, and will thank Nature on this\naccount: for in what fashion could she have done better for me? she\nhas given me alone to all, and all to me alone. Whatever I may\npossess, I will neither hoard it greedily nor squander it recklessly.\nI will think that I have no possessions so real as those which I\nhave given away to deserving people: I will not reckon benefits by\ntheir magnitude or number, or by anything except the value set upon\nthem by the receiver: I never will consider a gift to be a large\none if it be bestowed upon a worthy object. I will do nothing because\nof public opinion, but everything because of conscience: whenever\nI do anything alone by myself I will believe that the eyes of the\nRoman people are upon me while I do it. In eating and drinking my\nobject shall be to quench the desires of Nature, not to fill and\nempty my belly. I will be agreeable with my friends, gentle and\nmild to my foes: I will grant pardon before I am asked for it, and\nwill meet the wishes of honourable men half way: I will bear in\nmind that the world is my native city, that its governors are the\ngods, and that they stand above and around me, criticizing whatever\nI do or say. Whenever either Nature demands my breath again, or\nreason bids me dismiss it, I will quit this life, calling all to\nwitness that I have loved a good conscience, and good pursuits;\nthat no one\u2019s freedom, my own least of all, has been impaired through\nme.\u201d He who sets up these as the rules of his life will soar aloft\nand strive to make his way to the gods: of a truth, even though he\nfails, yet he {228}\n\u201cFails in a high emprise.\u201d[4]\nBut you, who hate both virtue and those who practise it, do nothing\nat which we need be surprised, for sickly lights cannot bear the\nsun, nocturnal creatures avoid the brightness of day, and at its\nfirst dawning become bewildered and all betake themselves to their\ndens together: creatures that fear the light hide themselves in\ncrevices. So croak away, and exercise your miserable tongues in\nreproaching good men: open wide your jaws, bite hard: you will break\nmany teeth before you make any impression.\nXXI. \u201cBut how is it that this man studies philosophy and nevertheless\nlives the life of a rich man? Why does he say that wealth ought to\nbe despised and yet possess it? that life should be despised, and\nyet live? that health should be despised, and yet guard it with the\nutmost care, and wish it to be as good as possible? Does he consider\nbanishment to be an empty name, and say, \u201cWhat evil is there in\nchanging one country for another?\u201d and yet, if permitted, does he\nnot grow old in his native land? does he declare that there is no\ndifference between a longer and a shorter time, and yet, if he be\nnot prevented, lengthen out his life and flourish in a green old\nage?\u201d His answer is, that these things ought to be despised, not\nthat he should not possess them, but that he should not possess\nthem with fear and trembling: he does not drive them away from him,\nbut when they leave him he follows after them unconcernedly. Where,\nindeed, can fortune invest riches more securely than in a place\nfrom whence they can always be recovered without any squabble with\ntheir trustee? Marcus Cato, when he was praising Curius and Coruncanius\nand that century in which the possession of a few small silver coins\nwere an offence which was punished by the Censor, himself owned\nfour million sesterces; a less fortune no {229} doubt, than that\nof Crassus, but larger than of Cato the Censor. If the amounts be\ncompared, he had outstripped his great-grandfather further than he\nhimself was outdone by Crassus, and if still greater riches had\nfallen to his lot, he would not have spurned them: for the wise man\ndoes not think himself unworthy of any chance presents: he does not\nlove riches, but he prefers to have them; he does not receive them\ninto his spirit, but only into his house: nor does he cast away\nfrom him what he already possesses, but keeps them, and is willing\nthat his virtue should receive a larger subject-matter for its\nexercise.\nXXII. Who can doubt, however, that the wise man, if he is rich, has\na wider field for the development of his powers than if he is poor,\nseeing that in the latter case the only virtue which he can display\nis that of neither being perverted nor crushed by his poverty,\nwhereas if he has riches, he will have a wide field for the exhibition\nof temperance, generosity, laboriousness, methodical arrangement,\nand grandeur. The wise man will not despise himself, however short\nof stature he may be, but nevertheless he will wish to be tall:\neven though he be feeble and one-eyed he may be in good health, yet\nhe would prefer to have bodily strength, and that too, while he\nknows all the while that he has something which is even more powerful:\nhe will endure illness, and will hope for good health: for some\nthings, though they may be trifles compared with the sum total, and\nthough they may be taken away without destroying the chief good,\nyet add somewhat to that constant cheerfulness which arises from\nvirtue. Riches encourage and brighten up such a man just as a sailor\nis delighted at a favourable wind that bears him on his way, or as\npeople feel pleasure at a fine day or at a sunny spot in the cold\nweather. What wise man, I mean of our school, whose only good is\nvirtue, can deny that even these matters which we call neither good\nnor bad have in themselves a {230} certain value, and that some of\nthem are preferable to others? to some of them we show a certain\namount of respect, and to some a great deal. Do not, then, make any\nmistake: riches belong to the class of desirable things. \u201cWhy then,\u201d\nsay you, \u201cdo you laugh at me, since you place them in the same\nposition that I do?\u201d Do you wish to know how different the position\nis in which we place them? If my riches leave me, they will carry\naway with them nothing except themselves: you will be bewildered\nand will seem to be left without yourself if they should pass away\nfrom you: with me riches occupy a certain place, but with you they\noccupy the highest place of all. In fine, my riches belong to me,\nyou belong to your riches.\nXXIII. Cease, then, forbidding philosophers to possess money: no\none has condemned wisdom to poverty. The philosopher may own ample\nwealth, but will not own wealth that which has been torn from\nanother, or which is stained with another\u2019s blood: his must be\nobtained without wronging any man, and without its being won by\nbase means; it must be alike honourably come by and honourably\nspent, and must be such as spite alone could shake its head at.\nRaise it to whatever figure you please, it will still be an honourable\npossession, if, while it includes much which every man would like\nto call his own, there be nothing which any one can say is his own.\nSuch a man will not forfeit his right to the favour of Fortune, and\nwill neither boast of his inheritance nor blush for it if it was\nhonourably acquired: yet he will have something to boast of, if he\nthrow his house open, let all his countrymen come among his property,\nand say, \u201cIf any one recognizes here anything belonging to him, let\nhim take it.\u201d What a great man, how excellently rich will he be,\nif after this speech he possesses as much as he had before! I say,\nthen, that if he can safely and confidently submit his accounts to\nthe scrutiny of the people, and no one can find {231} in them any\nitem upon which he can lay hands, such a man may boldly and\nunconcealedly enjoy his riches. The wise man will not allow a single\nill-won penny to cross his threshold: yet he will not refuse or\nclose his door against great riches, if they are the gift of fortune\nand the product of virtue: what reason has he for grudging them\ngood quarters: let them come and be his guests: he will neither\nbrag of them nor hide them away: the one is the part of a silly,\nthe other of a cowardly and paltry spirit, which, as it were, muffles\nup a good thing in its lap. Neither will he, as I said before, turn\nthem out of his house: for what will he say? will he say, \u201cYou are\nuseless,\u201d or \u201cI do not know how to use riches?\u201d As he is capable\nof performing a journey upon his own feet, but yet would prefer to\nmount a carriage, just so he will be capable of being poor, yet\nwill wish to be rich; he will own wealth, but will view it as an\nuncertain possession which will some day fly away from him. He will\nnot allow it to be a burden either to himself or to any one else:\nhe will give it\u2014why do you prick up your ears? why do you open your\npockets?\u2014he will give it either to good men or to those whom it may\nmake into good men. He will give it after having taken the utmost\npains to choose those who are fittest to receive it, as becomes one\nwho bears in mind that he ought to give an account of what he spends\nas well as of what he receives. He will give for good and commendable\nreasons, for a gift ill bestowed counts as a shameful loss: he will\nhave an easily opened pocket, but not one with a hole in it, so\nthat much may be taken out of it, yet nothing may fall out of it.\nXXIV. He who believes giving to be an easy matter, is mistaken: it\noffers very great difficulties, if we bestow our bounty rationally,\nand do not scatter it impulsively and at random. I do this man a\nservice, I requite a good turn done me by that one: I help this\nother, because I pity him: this man, again, I teach to be no fit\nobject for poverty to {232} hold down or degrade. I shall not give\nsome men anything, although they are in want, because, even if I\ndo give to them they will still be in want: I shall proffer my\nbounty to some, and shall forcibly thrust it upon others: I cannot\nbe neglecting my own interests while I am doing this: at no time\ndo I make more people in my debt than when I am giving things away.\n\u201cWhat?\u201d say you, \u201cdo you give that you may receive again?\u201d At any\nrate I do not give that I may throw my bounty away: what I give\nshould be so placed that although I cannot ask for its return, yet\nit may be given back to me. A benefit should be invested in the\nsame manner as a treasure buried deep in the earth, which you would\nnot dig up unless actually obliged. Why, what opportunities of\nconferring benefits the mere house of a rich man affords? for who\nconsiders generous behaviour due only to those who wear the toga?\nNature bids me do good to mankind\u2014what difference does it make\nwhether they be slaves or freemen, free-born or emancipated, whether\ntheir freedom be legally acquired or betowed by arrangement among\nfriends? Wherever there is a human being, there is an opportunity\nfor a benefit: consequently, money may be distributed even within\none\u2019s own threshold, and a field may be found there for the practice\nof freehandedness, which is not so called because it is our duty\ntowards free men, but because it takes its rise in a free-born mind.\nIn the case of the wise man, this never falls upon base and unworthy\nrecipients, and never becomes so exhausted as not, whenever it finds\na worthy object, to flow as if its store was undiminished. You have,\ntherefore, no grounds for misunderstanding the honourable, brave,\nand spirited language which you hear from those who are studying\nwisdom: and first of all observe this, that a student of wisdom is\nnot the same thing as a man who has made himself perfect in wisdom.\nThe former will say to you, \u201cIn my talk I express the most admirable\nsentiments, {233} yet I am still weltering amid countless ills.\nYou must not force me to act up to my rules: at the present time I\nam forming myself, moulding my character, and striving to rise\nmyself to the height of a great example. If I should ever succeed\nin carrying out all that I have set myself to accomplish, you may\nthen demand that my words and deeds should correspond,\u201d But he who\nhas reached the summit of human perfection will deal otherwise with\nyou, and will say, \u201cIn the first place, you have no business to\nallow yourself to sit in judgment upon your betters:\u201d I have already\nobtained one proof of my righteousness in having become an object\nof dislike to bad men: however, to make you a rational answer, which\nI grudge to no man, listen to what I declare, and at what price I\nvalue all things. Riches, I say, are not a good thing; for if they\nwere, they would make men good: now since that which is found even\namong bad men cannot be termed good, I do not allow them to be\ncalled so: nevertheless I admit that they are desirable and useful\nand contribute great comforts to our lives.\nXXV. Learn, then, since we both agree that they are desirable, what\nmy reason is amongst counting them among good things, and in what\nrespects I should behave differently to you if I possessed them.\nPlace me as master in the house of a very rich man: place me where\ngold and silver plate is used for the commonest purposes; I shall\nnot think more of myself because of things which even though they\nare in my house are yet no part of me. Take me away to the wooden\nbridge[5] and put me down there among the beggars: I shall not\ndespise myself because I am sitting among those who hold out their\nhands for alms: for what can the lack of a piece of bread matter\nto one {234} who does not lack the power of dying? Well, then? I\nprefer the magnificent house to the beggar\u2019s bridge. Place me among\nmagnificent furniture and all the appliances of luxury: I shall not\nthink myself any happier because my cloak is soft, because my guests\nrest upon purple. Change the scene: I shall be no more miserable\nif my weary head rests upon a bundle of hay, if I lie upon a cushion\nfrom the circus, with all the stuffing on the point of coming out\nthrough its patches of threadbare cloth. Well, then? I prefer, as\nfar as my feelings go, to show myself in public dressed in woollen\nand in robes of office, rather than with naked or half-covered\nshoulders: I should like every day\u2019s business to turn out just as\nI wish it to do, and new congratulations to be constantly following\nupon the former ones: yet I will not pride myself upon this: change\nall this good fortune for its opposite, let my spirit be distracted\nby losses, grief, various kinds of attacks: let no hour pass without\nsome dispute: I shall not on this account, though beset by the\ngreatest miseries, call myself the most miserable of beings, nor\nshall I curse any particular day, for I have taken care to have no\nunlucky days. What, then, is the upshot of all this? it is that I\nprefer to have to regulate joys than to stifle sorrows. The great\nSocrates would say the same thing to you. \u201cMake me,\u201d he would say,\n\u201cthe conqueror of all nations: let the voluptuous car of Bacchus\nbear me in triumph to Thebes from the rising of the sun: let the\nkings of the Persians receive laws from me: yet I shall feel myself\nto be a man at the very moment when all around salute me as a God.\nStraightway connect this lofty height with a headlong fall into\nmisfortune: let me be placed upon a foreign chariot that I may grace\nthe triumph of a proud and savage conqueror: I will follow another\u2019s\ncar with no more humility than I showed when I stood in my own.\nWhat then? In spite of all this, I had rather be a conqueror than\na captive. I despise the whole {235} dominion of Fortune, but still,\nif I were given my choice, I would choose its better parts. I shall\nmake whatever befals me become a good thing, but I prefer that what\nbefals me should be comfortable and pleasant and unlikely to cause\nme annoyance: for you need not suppose that any virtue exists without\nlabour, but some virtues need spurs, while others need the curb.\nAs we have to check our body on a downward path, and to urge it to\nclimb a steep one; so also the path of some virtues leads down hill,\nthat of others uphill. Can we doubt that patience, courage, constancy,\nand all the other virtues which have to meet strong opposition, and\nto trample Fortune under their feet, are climbing, struggling,\nwinning their way up a steep ascent? Why! is it not equally evident\nthat generosity, moderation, and gentleness glide easily downhill?\nWith the latter we must hold in our spirit, lest it run away with\nus: with the former we must urge and spur it on. We ought, therefore,\nto apply these energetic, combative virtues to poverty, and to\nriches those other more thrifty ones which trip lightly along, and\nmerely support their own weight. This being the distinction between\nthem, I would rather have to deal with those which I could practise\nin comparative quiet, than those of which one can only make trial\nthrough blood and sweat. \u201cWherefore,\u201d says the sage, \u201cI do not talk\none way and live another: but you do not rightly understand what I\nsay: the sound of my words alone reaches your ears, you do not try\nto find out their meaning.\u201d\nXXVI. \u201cWhat difference, then, is there between me, who am a fool,\nand you, who are a wise man?\u201d \u201cAll the difference in the world: for\nriches are slaves in the house of a wise man, but masters in that\nof a fool. You accustom yourself to them and cling to them as if\nsomebody had promised that they should be yours for ever, but a\nwise man never thinks so much about poverty as when he is surrounded\nby riches. No general ever trusts so implicitly in {236} the\nmaintenance of peace as not to make himself ready for a war, which,\nthough it may not actually be waged, has nevertheless been declared;\nyou are rendered over-proud by a fine house, as though it could\nnever be burned or fall down, and your heads are turned by riches\nas though they were beyond the reach of all dangers and were so\ngreat that Fortune has not sufficient strength to swallow them up.\nYou sit idly playing with your wealth and do not foresee the perils\nin store for it, as savages generally do when besieged, for, not\nunderstanding the use of siege artillery, they look on idly at the\nlabours of the besiegers and do not understand the object of the\nmachines which they are putting together at a distance: and this\nis exactly what happens to you: you go to sleep over your property,\nand never reflect how many misfortunes loom menacingly around you\non all sides, and soon will plunder you of costly spoils, but if\none takes away riches from the wise man, one leaves him still in\npossession of all that is his: for he lives happy in the present,\nand without fear for the future. The great Socrates, or any one\nelse who had the same superiority to and power to withstand the\nthings of this life, would say, \u2018I have no more fixed principle\nthan that of not altering the course of my life to suit your\nprejudices: you may pour your accustomed talk upon me from all\nsides: I shall not think that you are abusing me, but that you are\nmerely wailing like poor little babies.\u2019\u201d This is what the man will\nsay who possesses wisdom, whose mind, being free from vices, bids\nhim reproach others, not because he hates them, but in order to\nimprove them: and to this he will add, \u201cYour opinion of me affects\nme with pain, not for my own sake but for yours, because to hate\nperfection and to assail virtue is in itself a resignation of all\nhope of doing well. You do me no harm; neither do men harm the gods\nwhen they overthrow their altars: but it is clear that your intention\nis an evil one and that you will wish to do harm even {237} where\nyou are not able. I bear with your prating in the same spirit in\nwhich Jupiter, best and greatest, bears with the idle tales of the\npoets, one of whom represents him with wings, another with horns,\nanother as an adulterer staying out all night, another is dealing\nharshly with the gods, another as unjust to men, another as the\nseducer of noble youths whom he carries off by force, and those,\ntoo, his own relatives, another as a parricide and the conqueror\nof another\u2019s kingdom, and that his father\u2019s. The only result of\nsuch tales is that men feel less shame at committing sin if they\nbelieve the gods to be guilty of such actions. But although this\nconduct of yours does not hurt me, yet, for your own sakes, I advise\nyou, respect virtue: believe those who having long followed her cry\naloud that what they follow is a thing of might, and daily appears\nmightier. Reverence her as you would the gods, and reverence her\nfollowers as you would the priests of the gods: and whenever any\nmention of sacred writings is made, _favete linguis_, favour us\nwith silence: this word is not derived, as most people imagine,\nfrom _favour_, but commands silence, that divine service may be\nperformed without being interrupted by any words of evil omen. It\nis much more necessary that you should be ordered to do this, in\norder that whenever utterance is made by that oracle, you may listen\nto it with attention and in silence. Whenever any one beats a\nsistrum,[6] pretending to do so by divine command, any proficient\nin grazing his own skin covers his arms and shoulders with blood\nfrom light cuts, any one crawls on his knees howling along the\nstreet, or any old man clad in linen comes forth in daylight with\na lamp and laurel branch and cries out that one of the gods is\nangry, you crowd round him and listen to his words, and each increases\nthe {238} other\u2019s wonderment by declaring him to be divinely inspired.\nXXVII. Behold! from that prison of his, which by entering he cleansed\nfrom shame and rendered more honourable than any senate house,\nSocrates addresses you, saying: \u201cWhat is this madness of yours?\nwhat is this disposition, at war alike with gods and men, which\nleads you to calumniate virtue and to outrage holiness with malicious\naccusations? Praise good men, if you are able: if not, pass them\nby in silence: if indeed you take pleasure in this offensive\nabusiveness, fall foul of one another: for when you rave against\nHeaven, I do not say that you commit sacrilege, but you waste your\ntime. I once afforded Aristophanes with the subject of a jest: since\nthen all the crew of comic poets have made me a mark for their\nenvenomed wit: my virtue has been made to shine more brightly by\nthe very blows which have been aimed at it, for it is to its advantage\nto be brought before the public and exposed to temptation, nor do\nany people understand its greatness more than those who by their\nassaults have made trial of its strength. The hardness of flint is\nknown to none so well as to those who strike it. I offer myself to\nall attacks, like some lonely rock in a shallow sea, which the waves\nnever cease to beat upon from whatever quarter they may come, but\nwhich they cannot thereby move from its place nor yet wear away,\nfor however many years they may unceasingly dash against it. Bound\nupon me, rush upon me, I will overcome you by enduring your onset:\nwhatever strikes against that which is firm and unconquerable merely\ninjures itself by its own violence. Wherefore, seek some soft and\nyielding object to pierce with your darts. But have you leisure to\npeer into other men\u2019s evil deeds and to sit in judgment upon anybody?\nto ask how it is that this philosopher has so roomy a house, or\nthat one so good a dinner? Do you look at other people\u2019s pimples\nwhile you {239} yourselves are covered with countless ulcers? This\nis as though one who was eaten up by the mange were to point with\nscorn at the moles and warts on the bodies of the handsomest men.\nReproach Plato with having sought for money, reproach Aristotle\nwith having obtained it, Democritus with having disregarded it,\nEpicurus with having spent it: cast Phaedrus and Alcibiades in my\nown teeth, you who reach the height of enjoyment whenever you get\nan opportunity of imitating our vices! Why do you not rather cast\nyour eyes around yourselves at the ills which tear you to pieces\non every side, some attacking you from without, some burning in\nyour own bosoms? However little you know your own place, mankind\nhas not yet come to such a pass that you can have leisure to wag\nyour tongues to the reproach of your betters.\nXXVIII. This you do not understand, and you bear a countenance which\ndoes not befit your condition, like many men who sit in the circus\nor the theatre without having learned that their home is already\nin mourning: but I, looking forward from a lofty standpoint, can\nsee what storms are either threatening you, and will burst in\ntorrents upon you somewhat later, or are close upon you and on the\npoint of sweeping away all that you possess. Why, though you are\nhardly aware of it, is there not a whirling hurricane at this moment\nspinning round and confusing your minds, making them seek and avoid\nthe very same things, now raising them aloft and now dashing them\nbelow? . . . . . .\u201d\n[1] Lipsius\u2019s conjecture, \u201cthose who are dressed in white as well\nas those who are dressed in coloured clothes,\u2019 alluding to the white\nrobes of candidates for office, seems reasonable.\n[2] The Latin words are literally \u201cto divide\u201d their vote, that is,\n\u201cto separate things of different kinds comprised in a single vote\nso that they might be voted for separately.\u201d\u2014Andrews.\nS\u00e9neque fait allusion ici \u00e0 une coutume pratiqu\u00e9e dans les assembl\u00e9es\ndu S\u00e9nat; et il nous I\u2019explique lui-m\u00eame ailleurs d\u2019un mani\u00e8re tr\u00e8s\nclaire: \u201cSi quelqu\u2019un dans le S\u00e9nat,\u201d dit il, \u201couvre un avis, dont\nune partie me convienne, je le somme de la detacher du reste, et\nj\u2019y adh\u00e8re.\u201d\u2014_Ep_. 21, La Grange.\n[3] _Parentatur_ seems to mean where an offering is made to luxury\u2014\nwhere they sacrifice to luxury.

ANNAEUS SENECA, ADDRESSED\nTO SERENUS.\nOF LEISURE.\nI. . . . . why do they with great unanimity recommend vices to us?\neven though we attempt nothing else that would do us good, yet\nretirement in itself will be beneficial to us: we shall be better\nmen when taken singly\u2014and if so, what an advantage it will be to\nretire into the society of the best of men, and to choose some\nexample by which we may guide our lives! This cannot be done without\nleisure: with leisure we can carry out that which we have once for\nall decided to be best, when there is no one to interfere with us\nand with the help of the mob pervert our as yet feeble judgment:\nwith leisure only can life, which we distract by aiming at the most\nincompatible objects, flow on in a single gentle stream. Indeed,\nthe worst of our various ills is that we change our very vices, and\nso we have not even the advantage of dealing with a well-known form\nof evil: we take pleasure first in one and then in another, and\nare, besides, troubled by the fact that our opinions are not only\nwrong, but lightly formed; we toss as it were on waves, and clutch\nat one thing after another: we let go what we just now sought for,\nand {241} strive to recover what we have let go. We oscillate between\ndesire and remorse, for we depend entirely upon the opinions of\nothers, and it is that which many people praise and seek after, not\nthat which deserves to be praised and sought after, which we consider\nto be best. Nor do we take any heed of whether our road be good or\nbad in itself, but we value it by the number of footprints upon it,\namong which there are none of any who have returned. You will say\nto me, \u201cSeneca, what are you doing? do you desert your party? I am\nsure that our Stoic philosophers say we must be in motion up to the\nvery end of our life, we will never cease to labour for the general\ngood; to help individual people, and when stricken in years to\nafford assistance even to our enemies. We are the sect that gives\nno discharge for any number of years\u2019 service, and in the words of\nthe most eloquent of poets:\u2014\n\u2018We wear the helmet when our locks are grey.\u2019[1]\nWe are they who are so far from indulging in any leisure until we\ndie, that if circumstances permit it, we do not allow ourselves to\nbe at leisure even when we are dying. Why do you preach the maxims\nof Epicurus in the very headquarters of Zeno? nay, if you are ashamed\nof your party, why do you not go openly altogether over to the enemy\nrather than betray your own side?\u201d I will answer this question\nstraightway: What more can you wish than that I should imitate my\nleaders? What then follows? I shall go whither they lead me, not\nwhither they send me.\nII. Now I will prove to you that I am not deserting the {242} tenets\nof the Stoics: for they themselves have not deserted them: and yet\nI should be able to plead a very good excuse even if I did follow,\nnot their precepts, but their examples. I shall divide what I am\nabout to say into two parts: first, that a man may from the very\nbeginning of his life give himself up entirely to the contemplation\nof truth; secondly, that a man when he has already completed his\nterm of service, has the best of rights, that of his shattered\nhealth, to do this, and that he may then apply his mind to other\nstudies after the manner of the Vestal virgins, who allot different\nduties to different years, first learn how to perform the sacred\nrites, and when they have learned them teach others.\nIII. I will show that this is approved of by the Stoics also, not\nthat I have laid any commandment upon myself to do nothing contrary\nto the teaching of Zeno and Chrysippus, but because the matter\nitself allows me to follow the precepts of those men; for if one\nalways follows the precepts of one man, one ceases to be a debater\nand becomes a partizan. Would that all things were already known,\nthat truth were unveiled and recognized, and that none of our\ndoctrines required modification! but as it is we have to seek for\ntruth in the company of the very men who teach it. The two sects\nof Epicureans and Stoics differ widely in most respects, and on\nthis point among the rest, nevertheless, each of them consigns us\nto leisure, although by a different road. Epicurus says, \u201cThe wise\nman will not take part in politics, except upon some special\noccasion;\u201d Zeno says, \u201cThe wise man will take part in politics,\nunless prevented by some special circumstance.\u201d The one makes it\nhis aim in life to seek for leisure, the other seeks it only when\nhe has reasons for so doing: but this word \u201creasons\u201d has a wide\nsignification. If the state is so rotten as to be past helping, if\nevil has entire dominion over it, the wise man will not labour in\nvain or waste his strength in unprofitable {243} efforts. Should\nhe be deficient in influence or bodily strength, if the state refuse\nto submit to his guidance, if his health stand in the way, then he\nwill not attempt a journey for which he is unfit, just as he would\nnot put to sea in a worn-out ship, or enlist in the army if he were\nan invalid. Consequently, one who has not yet suffered either in\nhealth or fortune has the right, before encountering any storms,\nto establish himself in safety, and thenceforth to devote himself\nto honourable industry and inviolate leisure, and the service of\nthose virtues which can be practised even by those who pass the\nquietest of lives. The duty of a man is to be useful to his fellow-men;\nif possible, to be useful to many of them; failing this, to be\nuseful to a few; failing this, to be useful to his neighbours, and,\nfailing them, to himself: for when he helps others, he advances the\ngeneral interests of mankind. Just as he who makes himself a worse\nman does harm not only to himself but to all those to whom he might\nhave done good if he had made himself a better one, so he who\ndeserves well of himself does good to others by the very fact that\nhe is preparing what will be of service to them.\nIV. Let us grasp the fact that there are two republics, one vast\nand truly \u201cpublic,\u201d which contains alike gods and men, in which we\ndo not take account of this or that nook of land, but make the\nboundaries of our state reach as far as the rays of the sun: and\nanother to which we have been assigned by the accident of birth.\nThis may be that of the Athenians or Carthaginians, or of any other\ncity which does not belong to all men but to some especial ones.\nSome men serve both of these states, the greater and the lesser,\nat the same time; some serve only the lesser, some only the greater.\nWe can serve the greater commonwealth even when we are at leisure;\nindeed I am not sure that we cannot serve it better when we are at\nleisure to inquire into what virtue is, and whether it be one or\nmany: {244} whether it be nature or art that makes men good: whether\nthat which contains the earth and sea and all that in them is be\none, or whether God has placed therein many bodies of the same\nspecies: whether that out of which all things are made be continuous\nand solid, or containing interstices and alternate empty and full\nspaces: whether God idly looks on at His handiwork, or directs its\ncourse: whether He is without and around the world, or whether He\npervades its entire surface: whether the world be immortal, or\ndoomed to decay and belonging to the class of things which are born\nonly for a time? What service does he who meditates upon these\nquestions render to God? He prevents these His great works having\nno one to witness them.\nV. We have a habit of saying that the highest good is to live\naccording to nature: now nature has produced us for both purposes,\nfor contemplation and for action. Let us now prove what we said\nbefore: nay, who will not think this proved if he bethinks himself\nhow great a passion he has for discovering the unknown? how vehemently\nhis curiosity is roused by every kind of romantic tale. Some men\nmake long voyages and undergo the toils of journeying to distant\nlands for no reward except that of discovering something hidden and\nremote. This is what draws people to public shows, and causes them\nto pry into everything that is closed, to puzzle out everything\nthat is secret, to clear up points of antiquity, and to listen to\ntales of the customs of savage nations. Nature has bestowed upon\nus an inquiring disposition, and being well aware of her own skill\nand beauty, has produced us to be spectators of her vast works,\nbecause she would lose all the fruits of her labour if she were to\nexhibit such vast and noble works of such complex construction, so\nbright and beautiful in so many ways, to solitude alone. That you\nmay be sure that she wishes to be gazed upon, not merely looked at,\nsee what a place she has assigned to us: she has placed us in {245}\nthe middle of herself and given us a prospect all around. She has\nnot only set man erect upon his feet, but also with a view to making\nit easy for him to watch the heavens, she has raised his head on\nhigh and connected it with a pliant neck, in order that he might\nfollow the course of the stars from their rising to their setting,\nand move his face round with the whole heaven. Moreover, by carrying\nsix constellations across the sky by day, and six by night, she\ndisplays every part of herself in such a manner that by what she\nbrings before man\u2019s eyes she renders him eager to see the rest also.\nFor we have not beheld all things, nor yet the true extent of them,\nbut our eyesight does but open to itself the right path for research,\nand lay the foundation, from which our speculations may pass from\nwhat is obvious to what is less known, and find out something more\nancient than the world itself, from whence those stars came forth:\ninquire what was the condition of the universe before each of its\nelements were separated from the general mass: on what principle\nits confused and blended parts were divided: who assigned their\nplaces to things, whether it was by their own nature that what was\nheavy sunk downwards, and what was light flew upwards, or whether\nbesides the stress and weight of bodies some higher power gave laws\nto each of them: whether that greatest proof that the spirit of man\nis divine be true, the theory, namely, that some parts and as it\nwere sparks of the stars have fallen down upon earth and stuck there\nin a foreign substance. Our thought bursts through the battlements\nof heaven, and is not satisfied with knowing only what is shown to\nus: \u201cI investigate,\u201d it says, \u201cthat which lies without the world,\nwhether it be a bottomless abyss, or whether it also is confined\nwithin boundaries of its own: what the appearance of the things\noutside may be, whether they be shapeless and vague, extending\nequally in every direction, or whether they also are arranged {246}\nin a certain kind of order: whether they are connected with this\nworld of ours, or are widely separated from it and welter about in\nempty space: whether they consist of distinct atoms, of which\neverything that is and that is to be, is made, or whether their\nsubstance is uninterrupted and all of it capable of change: whether\nthe elements are naturally opposed to one another, or whether they\nare not at variance, but work towards the same end by different\nmeans.\u201d Since man was born for such speculations as these, consider\nhow short a time he has been given for them, even supposing that\nhe makes good his claims to the whole of it, allows no part of it\nto be wrested from him through good nature, or to slip away from\nhim through carelessness; though he watches over all his hours with\nmost miserly care, though he live to the extreme confines of human\nexistence, and though misfortune take nothing away from what Nature\nbestowed upon him, even then man is too mortal for the comprehension\nof immortality. I live according to Nature, therefore, if I give\nmyself entirely up to her, and if I admire and reverence her. Nature,\nhowever, intended me to do both, to practise both contemplation and\naction: and I do both, because even contemplation is not devoid of\naction.\nVI. \u201cBut,\u201d say you, \u201cit makes a difference whether you adopt the\ncontemplative life for the sake of your own pleasure, demanding\nnothing from it save unbroken contemplation without any result: for\nsuch a life is a sweet one and has attractions of its own.\u201d To this\nI answer you: It makes just as much difference in what spirit you\nlead the life of a public man, whether you are never at rest, and\nnever set apart any time during which you may turn your eyes away\nfrom the things of earth to those of Heaven. It is by no means\ndesirable that one should merely strive to accumulate property\nwithout any love of virtue, or do nothing but hard work without any\ncultivation of the {247} intellect, for these things ought to be\ncombined and blended together; and, similarly, virtue placed in\nleisure without action is but an incomplete and feeble good thing,\nbecause she never displays what she has learned. Who can deny that\nshe ought to test her progress in actual work, and not merely think\nwhat ought to be done, but also sometimes use her hands as well as\nher head, and bring her conceptions into actual being? But if the\nwise man be quite willing to act thus, if it be the things to be\ndone, not the man to do them that are wanting, will you not then\nallow him to live to himself? What is the wise man\u2019s purpose in\ndevoting himself to leisure? He knows that in leisure as well as\nin action he will accomplish something by which he will be of service\nto posterity. Our school at any rate declares that Zeno and Chrysippus\nhave done greater things than they would have done had they been\nin command of armies, or filled high offices, or passed laws: which\nlatter indeed they did pass, though not for one single state, but\nfor the whole human race. How then can it be unbecoming to a good\nman to enjoy a leisure such as this, by whose means he gives laws\nto ages to come, and addresses himself not to a few persons but to\nall men of all nations, both now and hereafter? To sum up the matter,\nI ask you whether Cleanthes, Chrysippus, and Zeno lived in accordance\nwith their doctrine? I am sure that you will answer that they lived\nin the manner in which they taught that men ought to live: yet no\none of them governed a state. \u201cThey had not,\u201d you reply, \u201cthe amount\nof property or social position which as a rule enables people to\ntake part in public affairs.\u201d Yet for all that they did not live\nan idle life: they found the means of making their retirement more\nuseful to mankind than the perspirings and runnings to and fro of\nother men: wherefore these persons are thought to have done great\nthings, in spite of their having done nothing of a public character.\n{248}\nVII. Morever, there are three kinds of life, and it is a stock\nquestion which of the three is the best: the first is devoted to\npleasure, the second to contemplation, the third to action. First,\nlet us lay aside all disputatiousness and bitterness of feeling,\nwhich, as we have stated, causes those whose paths in life are\ndifferent to hate one another beyond all hope of reconciliation,\nand let us see whether all these three do not come to the same\nthing, although under different names: for neither he who decides\nfor pleasure is without contemplation, nor is he who gives himself\nup to contemplation without pleasure: nor yet is he, whose life is\ndevoted to action, without contemplation. \u201cIt makes,\u201d you say, \u201call\nthe difference in the world, whether a thing is one\u2019s main object\nin life, or whether it be merely an appendage to some other object.\u201d\nI admit that the difference is considerable, nevertheless the one\ndoes not exist apart from the other: the one man cannot live in\ncontemplation without action, nor can the other act without\ncontemplation: and even the third, of whom we all agree in having\na bad opinion, does not approve of passive pleasure, but of that\nwhich he establishes for himself by means of reason: even this\npleasure-seeking sect itself, therefore, practises action also. Of\ncourse it does, since Epicurus himself says that at times he would\nabandon pleasure and actually seek for pain, if he became likely\nto be surfeited with pleasure, or if he thought that by enduring a\nslight pain he might avoid a greater one. With what purpose do I\nstate this? To prove that all men are fond of contemplation. Some\nmake it the object of their lives: to us it is an anchorage, but\nnot a harbour.\nVIII. Add to this that, according to the doctrine of Chrysippus, a\nman may live at leisure: I do not say that he ought to endure\nleisure, but that he ought to choose it. Our Stoics say that the\nwise man would not take part in the government of any state. What\ndifference does it {249} make by what path the wise man arrives at\nleisure, whether it be because the state is wanting to him, or he\nis wanting to the state? If the state is to be wanting to all wise\nmen (and it always will be found wanting by refined thinkers), I\nask you, to what state should the wise man betake himself; to that\nof the Athenians, in which Socrates is condemned to death, and from\nwhich Aristotle goes into exile lest he should be condemned to\ndeath? where virtues are borne down by jealousy? You will tell me\nthat no wise man would join such a state. Shall then the wise man\ngo to the commonwealth of the Carthaginians, where faction never\nceases to rage, and liberty is the foe of all the best men, where\njustice and goodness are held of no account, where enemies are\ntreated with inhuman cruelty and natives are treated like enemies:\nhe will flee from this state also. If I were to discuss each one\nseparately, I should not be able to find one which the wise man\ncould endure, or which could endure the wise man. Now if such a\nstate as we have dreamed of cannot be found on earth, it follows\nthat leisure is necessary for every one, because the one thing which\nmight be preferred to leisure is nowhere to be found. If any one\nsays that to sail is the best of things, and then says that we ought\nnot to sail in a sea in which shipwrecks were common occurrences,\nand where sudden storms often arise which drive the pilot back from\nhis course, I should imagine that this man, while speaking in praise\nof sailing, was really forbidding me to unmoor my ship . . . .\n[1] Virg. \u201cAen.\u201d ix. 612. Compare Sir Walter Scott, \u201cLay of the\nLast Minstrel,\u201d canto iv.:\u2014\n\u201cAnd still, in age, he spurned at rest, And still his brows the\nhelmet pressed.  Albeit the blanched locks below Were white as\nDinlay\u2019s spotless snow,\u201d &c.\n{250}\nTHE NINTH BOOK OF THE DIALOGUES OF L. ANNAEUS SENECA, ADDRESSED TO\nSERENUS.\nOF PEACE OF MIND.\nI. [_Serenus._]\nWhen I examine myself, Seneca, some vices appear on the surface,\nand so that I can lay my hands upon them, while others are less\ndistinct and harder to reach, and some are not always present, but\nrecur at intervals: and these I should call the most troublesome,\nbeing like a roving enemy that assails one when he sees his\nopportunity, and who will neither let one stand on one\u2019s guard as\nin war, nor yet take one\u2019s rest without fear as in peace. The\nposition in which I find myself more especially (for why should I\nnot tell you the truth as I would to a physician), is that of neither\nbeing thoroughly set free from the vices which I fear and hate, nor\nyet quite in bondage to them: my state of mind, though not the worst\npossible, is a particularly discontented and sulky one: I am neither\nill nor well, It is of no use for you to tell me that all virtues\nare weakly at the outset, and that they acquire strength and solidity\nby time, for I am well aware that even those which do but help our\noutward show, such as grandeur, a reputation for eloquence, and\neverything that appeals to others, gain power by time. Both those\nwhich {251} afford us real strength and those which do but trick\nus out in a more attractive form, require long years before they\ngradually are adapted to us by time. But I fear that custom, which\nconfirms most things, implants this vice more and more deeply in\nme. Long acquaintance with both good and bad people leads one to\nesteem them all alike. What this state of weakness really is, when\nthe mind halts between two opinions without any strong inclination\ntowards either good or evil, I shall be better able to show you\npiecemeal than all at once. I will tell you what befalls me, you\nmust find out the name of the disease. I have to confess the greatest\npossible love of thrift: I do not care for a bed with gorgeous\nhangings, nor for clothes brought out of a chest, or pressed under\nweights and made glossy by frequent manglings, but for common and\ncheap ones, that require no care either to keep them or to put them\non. For food I do not want what needs whole troops of servants to\nprepare it and admire it, nor what is ordered many days before and\nserved up by many hands, but something handy and easily come at,\nwith nothing far-fetched or costly about it, to be had in every\npart of the world, burdensome neither to one\u2019s fortune nor one\u2019s\nbody, not likely to go out of the body by the same path by which\nit came in. I like[1] a rough and unpolished homebred servant, I\nlike my servant born in my house: I like my country-bred father\u2019s\nheavy silver plate stamped with no maker\u2019s name: I do not want a\ntable that is beauteous with dappled spots, or known to all the\ntown by the number of fashionable people to whom it has successively\nbelonged, but one which stands merely for use, and which causes no\nguest\u2019s eye to dwell upon it with pleasure or to kindle at it with\nenvy. While I am well satisfied with this, I am reminded of the\nclothes of a certain schoolboy, dressed with no ordinary care and\nsplendour, of slaves bedecked with gold and a whole regiment {252}\nof glittering attendants. I think of houses too, where one treads\non precious stones, and where valuables lie about in every corner,\nwhere the very roof is brilliantly painted, and a whole nation\nattends and accompanies an inheritance on the road to ruin. What\nshall I say of waters, transparent to the very bottom, which flow\nround the guests, and banquets worthy of the theatre in which they\ntake place? Coming as I do from a long course of dull thrift, I\nfind myself surrounded by the most brilliant luxury, which echoes\naround me on every side: my sight becomes a little dazzled by it:\nI can lift up my heart against it more easily than my eyes. When I\nreturn from seeing it I am a sadder, though not a worse man, I\ncannot walk amid my own paltry possessions with so lofty a step as\nbefore, and silently there steals over me a feeling of vexation,\nand a doubt whether that way of life may not be better than mine.\nNone of these things alter my principles, yet all of them disturb\nme. At one time I would obey the maxims of our school and plunge\ninto public life, I would obtain office and become consul, not\nbecause the purple robe and lictor\u2019s axes attract me, but in order\nthat I may be able to be of use to my friends, my relatives, to all\nmy countrymen, and indeed to all mankind. Ready and determined, I\nfollow the advice of Zeno, Cleanthes, and Chrysippus, all of whom\nbid one take part in public affairs, though none of them ever did\nso himself: and then, as soon as something disturbs my mind, which\nis not used to receiving shocks, as soon as something occurs which\nis either disgraceful, such as often occurs in all men\u2019s lives, or\nwhich does not proceed quite easily, or when subjects of very little\nimportance require me to devote a great deal of time to them, I go\nback to my life of leisure, and, just as even tired cattle go faster\nwhen they are going home, I wish to retire and pass my life within\nthe walls of my house. \u201cNo one,\u201d I say, \u201cthat will give me no\ncompensation worth such a loss shall ever {253} rob me of a day.\nLet my mind be contained within itself and improve itself: let it\ntake no part with other men\u2019s affairs, and do nothing which depends\non the approval of others: let me enjoy a tranquillity undisturbed\nby either public or private troubles.\u201d But whenever my spirit is\nroused by reading some brave words, or some noble example spurs me\ninto action, I want to rush into the law courts, to place my voice\nat one man\u2019s disposal, my services at another\u2019s, and to try to help\nhim even though I may not succeed, or to quell the pride of some\nlawyer who is puffed up by ill-deserved success: but I think, by\nHercules, that in philosophical speculation it is better to view\nthings as they are, and to speak of them on their own account, and\nas for words, to trust to things for them, and to let one\u2019s speech\nsimply follow whither they lead. \u201cWhy do you want to construct a\nfabric that will endure for ages? Do you not wish to do this in\norder that posterity may talk of you: yet you were born to die, and\na silent death is the least wretched. Write something therefore in\na simple style, merely to pass the time, for your own use, and not\nfor publication. Less labour is needed when one does not look beyond\nthe present.\u201d Then again, when the mind is elevated by the greatness\nof its thoughts, it becomes ostentatious in its use of words, the\nloftier its aspirations, the more loftily it desires to express\nthem, and its speech rises to the dignity of its subject. At such\ntimes I forget my mild and moderate determination and soar higher\nthan is my wont, using a language that is not my own. Not to multiply\nexamples, I am in all things attended by this weakness of a\nwell-meaning mind, to whose level I fear that I shall be gradually\nbrought down, or, what is even more worrying, that I may always\nhang as though about to fall, and that there may be more the matter\nwith me than I myself perceive: for we take a friendly view of our\nown private affairs, and partiality always obscures our judgment.\n{254} I fancy that many men would have arrived at wisdom had they\nnot believed themselves to have arrived there already, had they not\npurposely deceived themselves as to some parts of their character,\nand passed by others with their eyes shut: for you have no grounds\nfor supposing that other people\u2019s flattery is more ruinous to us\nthan our own. Who dares to tell himself the truth? Who is there,\nby however large a troop of caressing courtiers he may be surrounded,\nwho in spite of them is not his own greatest flatterer? I beg you,\ntherefore, if you have any remedy by which you could stop this\nvacillation of mine, to deem me worthy to owe my peace of mind to\nyou. I am well aware that these oscillations of mind are not perilous\nand that they threaten me with no serious disorder: to express what\nI complain of by an exact simile, I am not suffering from a storm,\nbut from sea-sickness. Take from me, then, this evil, whatever it\nmay be, and help one who is in distress within sight of land.\nII. [_Seneca._] I have long been silently asking myself, my friend\nSerenus, to what I should liken such a condition of mind, and I\nfind that nothing more closely resembles it than the conduct of\nthose who, after having recovered from a long and serious illness,\noccasionally experience slight touches and twinges, and, although\nthey have passed through the final stages of the disease, yet have\nsuspicions that it has not left them, and though in perfect health\nyet hold out their pulse to be felt by the physician, and whenever\nthey feel warm suspect that the fever is returning. Such men,\nSerenus, are not unhealthy, but they are not accustomed to being\nhealthy; just as even a quiet sea or lake nevertheless displays a\ncertain amount of ripple when its waters are subsiding after a\nstorm. What you need, therefore, is, not any of those harsher\nremedies to which allusion has been made, not that you should in\nsome cases check yourself, in others be angry with yourself, in\n{255} others sternly reproach yourself, but that you should adopt\nthat which comes last in the list, have confidence in yourself, and\nbelieve that you are proceeding on the right path, without being\nled aside by the numerous divergent tracks of wanderers which cross\nit in every direction, some of them circling about the right path\nitself. What you desire, to be undisturbed, is a great thing, nay,\nthe greatest thing of all, and one which raises a man almost to the\nlevel of a god. The Greeks call this calm steadiness of mind\n_euthymia_, and Democritus\u2019s treatise upon it is excellently written:\nI call it peace of mind: for there is no necessity for translating\nso exactly as to copy the words of the Greek idiom: the essential\npoint is to mark the matter under discussion by a name which ought\nto have the same meaning as its Greek name, though perhaps not the\nsame form. What we are seeking, then, is how the mind may always\npursue a steady, unruffled course, may be pleased with itself, and\nlook with pleasure upon its surroundings, and experience no\ninterruption of this joy, but abide in a peaceful condition without\nbeing ever either elated or depressed: this will be \u201cpeace of mind.\u201d\nLet us now consider in a general way how it may be attained: then\nyou may apply as much as you choose of the universal remedy to your\nown case. Meanwhile we must drag to light the entire disease, and\nthen each one will recognize his own part of it: at the same time\nyou will understand how much less you suffer by your self-depreciation\nthan those who are bound by some showy declaration which they have\nmade, and are oppressed by some grand title of honour, so that shame\nrather than their own free will forces them to keep up the pretence.\nThe same thing applies both to those who suffer from fickleness and\ncontinual changes of purpose, who always are fondest of what they\nhave given up, and those who merely yawn and dawdle: add to these\nthose who, like bad sleepers, turn from side to {256} side, and\nsettle themselves first in one manner and then in another, until\nat last they find rest through sheer weariness: in forming the\nhabits of their lives they often end by adopting some to which they\nare not kept by any dislike of change, but in the practice of which\nold age, which is slow to alter, has caught them living: add also\nthose who are by no means fickle, yet who must thank their dulness,\nnot their consistency for being so, and who go on living not in the\nway they wish, but in the way they have begun to live. There are\nother special forms of this disease without number, but it has but\none effect, that of making people dissatisfied with themselves.\nThis arises from a distemperature of mind and from desires which\none is afraid to express or unable to fulfil, when men either dare\nnot attempt as much as they wish to do, or fail in their efforts\nand depend entirely upon hope: such people are always fickle and\nchangeable, which is a necessary consequence of living in a state\nof suspense: they take any way to arrive at their ends, and teach\nand force themselves to use both dishonourable and difficult means\nto do so, so that when their toil has been in vain they are made\nwretched by the disgrace of failure, and do not regret having longed\nfor what was wrong, but having longed for it in vain. They then\nbegin to feel sorry for what they have done, and afraid to begin\nagain, and their mind falls by degrees into a state of endless\nvacillation, because they can neither command nor obey their passions,\nof hesitation, because their life cannot properly develope itself,\nand of decay, as the mind becomes stupefied by disappointments. All\nthese symptoms become aggravated when their dislike of a laborious\nmisery has driven them to idleness and to secret studies, which are\nunendurable to a mind eager to take part in public affairs, desirous\nof action and naturally restless, because, of course, it finds too\nfew resources within itself: when therefore it loses the amusement\nwhich business itself affords to busy {257} men, it cannot endure\nhome, loneliness, or the walls of a room, and regards itself with\ndislike when left to itself. Hence arises that weariness and\ndissatisfaction with oneself, that tossing to and fro of a mind\nwhich can nowhere find rest, that unhappy and unwilling endurance\nof enforced leisure. In all cases where one feels ashamed to confess\nthe real cause of one\u2019s suffering, and where modesty leads one to\ndrive one\u2019s sufferings inward, the desires pent up in a little space\nwithout any vent choke one another. Hence comes melancholy and\ndrooping of spirit, and a thousand waverings of the unsteadfast\nmind, which is held in suspense by unfulfilled hopes, and saddened\nby disappointed ones: hence comes the state of mind of those who\nloathe their idleness, complain that they have nothing to do, and\nview the progress of others with the bitterest jealousy: for an\nunhappy sloth favours the growth of envy, and men who cannot succeed\nthemselves wish every one else to be ruined. This dislike of other\nmen\u2019s progress and despair of one\u2019s own produces a mind angered\nagainst fortune, addicted to complaining of the age in which it\nlives, to retiring into corners and brooding over its misery, until\nit becomes sick and weary of itself: for the human mind is naturally\nnimble and apt at movement: it delights in every opportunity of\nexcitement and forgetfulness of itself, and the worse a man\u2019s\ndisposition the more he delights in this, because he likes to wear\nhimself out with busy action, just as some sores long for the hands\nthat injure them and delight in being touched, and the foul itch\nenjoys anything that scratches it. Similarly I assure you that these\nminds, over which desires have spread like evil ulcers, take pleasure\nin toils and troubles, for there are some things which please our\nbody while at the same time they give it a certain amount of pain,\nsuch as turning oneself over and changing one\u2019s side before it is\nwearied, or cooling oneself in one position after another. It is\nlike Homer\u2019s Achilles, {258} lying first upon its face, then upon\nits back, placing itself in various attitudes, and, as sick people\nare wont, enduring none of them for long, and using changes as\nthough they were remedies. Hence men undertake aimless wanderings,\ntravel along distant shores, and at one time at sea, at another by\nland, try to soothe that fickleness of disposition which always is\ndissatisfied with the present. \u201cNow let us make for Campania: now\nI am sick of rich cultivation: let us see wild regions, let us\nthread the passes of Bruttii and Lucania: yet amid this wilderness\none wants something of beauty to relieve our pampered eyes after\nso long dwelling on savage wastes: let us seek Tarentum with its\nfamous harbour, its mild winter climate, and its district, rich\nenough to support even the great hordes of ancient times. Let us\nnow return to town: our ears have too long missed its shouts and\nnoise: it would be pleasant also to enjoy the sight of human\nbloodshed.\u201d Thus one journey succeeds another, and one sight is\nchanged for another. As Lucretius says:\u2014\n\u201cThus every mortal from himself doth flee;\u201d\nbut what does he gain by so doing if he does not escape from himself?\nhe follows himself and weighs himself down by his own most burdensome\ncompanionship. We must understand, therefore, that what we suffer\nfrom is not the fault of the places but of ourselves: we are weak\nwhen there is anything to be endured, and cannot support either\nlabour or pleasure, either one\u2019s own business or any one else\u2019s for\nlong. This has driven some men to death, because by frequently\naltering their purpose they were always brought back to the same\npoint, and had left themselves no room for anything new. They had\nbecome sick of life and of the world itself, and as all indulgences\npalled upon them they began to ask themselves the question, \u201cHow\nlong are we to go on doing the same thing?\u201d\n{259}\nIII. You ask me what I think we had better make use of to help us\nto support this ennui. \u201cThe best thing,\u201d as Athenodorus says, \u201cis\nto occupy oneself with business with the management of affairs of\nstate and the duties of a citizen: for as some pass the day in\nexercising themselves in the sun and in taking care of their bodily\nhealth, and athletes find it most useful to spend the greater part\nof their time in feeding up the muscles and strength to whose\ncultivation they have devoted their lives; so too for you who are\ntraining your mind to take part in the struggles of political life,\nit is far more honourable to be thus at work than to be idle. He\nwhose object is to be of service to his countrymen and to all\nmortals, exercises himself and does good at the same time when he\nis engrossed in business and is working to the best of his ability\nboth in the interests of the public and of private men. But,\u201d\ncontinues he, \u201cbecause innocence is hardly safe among such furious\nambitions and so many men who turn one aside from the right path,\nand it is always sure to meet with more hindrance than help, we\nought to withdraw ourselves from the forum and from public life,\nand a great mind even in a private station can find room wherein\nto expand freely. Confinement in dens restrains the springs of lions\nand wild creatures, but this does not apply to human beings, who\noften effect the most important works in retirement. Let a man,\nhowever, withdraw himself only in such a fashion that wherever he\nspends his leisure his wish may still be to benefit individual men\nand mankind alike, both with his intellect, his voice, and his\nadvice. The man that does good service to the state is not only he\nwho brings forward candidates for public office, defends accused\npersons, and gives his vote on questions of peace and war, but he\nwho encourages young men in well-doing, who supplies the present\ndearth of good teachers by instilling into their minds the principles\nof virtue, who seizes and holds back those who {260} are rushing\nwildly in pursuit of riches and luxury, and, if he does nothing\nelse, at least checks their course\u2014such a man does service to the\npublic though in a private station. Which does the most good, he\nwho decides between foreigners and citizens (as praetor peregrinus),\nor, as praetor urbanus, pronounces sentence to the suitors in his\ncourt at his assistant\u2019s dictation, or he who shows them what is\nmeant by justice, filial feeling, endurance, courage, contempt of\ndeath and knowledge of the gods, and how much a man is helped by a\ngood conscience? If then you transfer to philosophy the time which\nyou take away from the public service, you will not be a deserter\nor have refused to perform your proper task. A soldier is not merely\none who stands in the ranks and defends the right or the left wing\nof the army, but he also who guards the gates\u2014a service which,\nthough less dangerous, is no sinecure\u2014who keeps watch, and takes\ncharge of the arsenal: though all these are bloodless duties, yet\nthey count as military service. As soon as you have devoted yourself\nto philosophy, you will have overcome all disgust at life: you will\nnot wish for darkness because you are weary of the light, nor will\nyou be a trouble to yourself and useless to others: you will acquire\nmany friends, and all the best men will be attracted towards you:\nfor virtue, in however obscure a position, cannot be hidden, but\ngives signs of its presence: any one who is worthy will trace it\nout by its footsteps: but if we give up all society, turn our backs\nupon the whole human race, and live communing with ourselves alone,\nthis solitude without any interesting occupation will lead to a\nwant of something to do: we shall begin to build up and to pull\ndown, to dam out the sea, to cause waters to flow through natural\nobstacles, and generally to make a bad disposal of the time which\nNature has given us to spend: some of us use it grudgingly, others\nwastefully; some of us spend it so that we can show a profit and\nloss account, {261} others so that they have no assets remaining:\nthan which nothing can be more shameful. Often a man who is very\nold in years has nothing beyond his age by which he can prove that\nhe has lived a long time.\u201d\nIV. To me, my dearest Serenus, Athenodorus seems to have yielded\ntoo completely to the times, to have fled too soon: I will not deny\nthat sometimes one must retire, but one ought to retire slowly, at\na foot\u2019s pace, without losing one\u2019s ensigns or one\u2019s honour as a\nsoldier: those who make terms with arms in their hands are more\nrespected by their enemies and more safe in their hands. This is\nwhat I think ought to be done by virtue and by one who practises\nvirtue: if Fortune get the upper hand and deprive him of the power\nof action, let him not straightway turn his back to the enemy, throw\naway his arms, and run away seeking for a hiding-place, as if there\nwere any place whither Fortune could not pursue him, but let him\nbe more sparing in his acceptance of public office, and after due\ndeliberation discover some means by which he can be of use to the\nstate. He is not able to serve in the army: then let him become a\ncandidate for civic honours: must he live in a private station?\nthen let him be an advocate: is he condemned to keep silence? then\nlet him help his countrymen with silent counsel. Is it dangerous\nfor him even to enter the forum? then let him prove himself a good\ncomrade, a faithful friend, a sober guest in people\u2019s houses, at\npublic shows, and at wine-parties. Suppose that he has lost the\nstatus of a citizen; then let him exercise that of a man: our reason\nfor magnanimously refusing to confine ourselves within the walls\nof one city, for having gone forth to enjoy intercourse with all\nlands and for professing ourselves to be citizens of the world is\nthat we may thus obtain a wider theatre on which to display our\nvirtue. Is the bench of judges closed to you, are you forbidden to\naddress the people from the hustings, or to be a candidate at\nelections? {262} then turn your eyes away from Rome, and see what\na wide extent of territory, what a number of nations present\nthemselves before you. Thus, it is never possible for so many outlets\nto be closed against your ambition that more will not remain open\nto it: but see whether the whole prohibition does not arise from\nyour own fault. You do not choose to direct the affairs of the state\nexcept as consul or prytanis[2] or meddix[3] or sufes:[4] what\nshould we say if you refused to serve in the army save as general\nor military tribune? Even though others may form the first line,\nand your lot may have placed you among the veterans of the third,\ndo your duty there with your voice, encouragement, example, and\nspirit: even though a man\u2019s hands be cut off, he may find means to\nhelp his side in a battle, if he stands his ground and cheers on\nhis comrades. Do something of that sort yourself: if Fortune removes\nyou from the front rank, stand your ground nevertheless and cheer\non your comrades, and if somebody stops your mouth, stand nevertheless\nand help your side in silence. The services of a good citizen are\nnever thrown away: he does good by being heard and seen, by his\nexpression, his gestures, his silent determination, and his very\nwalk. As some remedies benefit us by their smell as well as by their\ntheir taste and touch, so virtue even when concealed and at a\ndistance sheds usefulness around. Whether she moves at her ease and\nenjoys her just rights, or can only appear abroad on sufferance and\nis forced to shorten sail to the tempest, whether it be unemployed,\nsilent, and pent up in a narrow lodging, or openly displayed, in\nwhatever guise she may appear, she always does good. What? do you\nthink that the example of one who can rest nobly has no value? It\nis by far the best plan, therefore, to mingle {263} leisure with\nbusiness, whenever chance impediments or the state of public affairs\nforbid one\u2019s leading an active life: for one is never so cut off\nfrom all pursuits as to find no room left for honourable action.\nV. Could you anywhere find a [more] miserable city than that of\nAthens when it was being torn to pieces by the thirty tyrants? they\nslew thirteen hundred citizens, all the best men, and did not leave\noff because they had done so, but their cruelty became stimulated\nby exercise. In the city which possessed that most reverend tribunal,\nthe Court of the Areopagus, which possessed a Senate, and a popular\nassembly which was like a Senate, there met daily a wretched crew\nof butchers, and the unhappy Senate House was crowded with tyrants.\nA state, in which there were so many tyrants that they would have\nbeen enough to form a bodyguard for one, might surely have rested\nfrom the struggle; it seemed impossible for men\u2019s minds even to\nconceive hopes of recovering their liberty, nor could they see any\nroom for a remedy for such a mass of evil: for whence could the\nunhappy state obtain all the Harmodiuses it would need to slay so\nmany tyrants? Yet Socrates was in the midst of the city, and consoled\nits mourning Fathers, encouraged those who despaired of the republic,\nby his reproaches brought rich men, who feared that their wealth\nwould be their ruin, to a tardy repentance of their avarice, and\nmoved about as a great example to those who wished to imitate him,\nbecause he walked a free man in the midst of thirty masters. However,\nAthens herself put him to death in prison, and Freedom herself could\nnot endure the freedom of one who had treated a whole band of tyrants\nwith scorn: you may know, therefore, that even in an oppressed state\na wise man can find an opportunity for bringing himself to the\nfront, and that in a prosperous and flourishing one wanton insolence,\njealousy, and a thousand other cowardly vices bear sway. We ought,\n{264} therefore, to expand or contract ourselves according as the\nstate presents itself to us, or as Fortune offers us opportunities:\nbut in any case we ought to move and not to become frozen still by\nfear: nay, he is the best man who, though peril menaces him on every\nside and arms and chains beset his path, nevertheless neither impairs\nnor conceals his virtue: for to keep oneself safe does not mean to\nbury oneself. I think that Curius Dentatus spoke truly when he said\nthat he would rather be dead than alive: the worst evil of all is\nto leave the ranks of the living before one dies: yet it is your\nduty, if you happen to live in an age when it is not easy to serve\nthe state, to devote more time to leisure and to literature. Thus,\njust as though you were making a perilous voyage, you may from time\nto time put into harbour, and set yourself free from public business\nwithout waiting for it to do so.\nVI. We ought, however, first to examine our own selves, next the\nbusiness which we propose to transact, next those for whose sake\nor in whose company we transact it.\nIt is above all things necessary to form a true estimate of oneself,\nbecause as a rule we think that we can do more than we are able:\none man is led too far through confidence in his eloquence, another\ndemands more from his estate than it can produce, another burdens\na weakly body with some toilsome duty. Some men are too shamefaced\nfor the conduct of public affairs, which require an unblushing\nfront: some men\u2019s obstinate pride renders them unfit for courts:\nsome cannot control their anger, and break into unguarded language\non the slightest provocation: some cannot rein in their wit or\nresist making risky jokes: for all these men leisure is better than\nemployment: a bold, haughty and impatient nature ought to avoid\nanything that may lead it to use a freedom of speech which will\nbring it to ruin. Next we must form an estimate of the matter which\nwe mean to deal with, and compare our strength {265} with the deed\nwe are about to attempt: for the bearer ought always to be more\npowerful than his load: indeed, loads which are too heavy for their\nbearer must of necessity crush him: some affairs also are not so\nimportant in themselves as they are prolific and lead to much more\nbusiness, which employments, as they involve us in new and various\nforms of work, ought to be refused. Neither should you engage in\nanything from which you are not free to retreat: apply yourself to\nsomething which you can finish, or at any rate can hope to finish:\nyou had better not meddle with those operations which grow in\nimportance, while they are being transacted, and which will not\nstop where you intended them to stop.\nVII. In all cases one should be careful in one\u2019s choice of men, and\nsee whether they be worthy of our bestowing a part of our life upon\nthem, or whether we shall waste our own time and theirs also: for\nsome even consider us to be in their debt because of our services\nto them. Athenodorus said that \u201che would not so much as dine with\na man who would not be grateful to him for doing so\u201d: meaning, I\nimagine, that much less would he go to dinner with those who\nrecompense the services of their friends by their table, and regard\ncourses of dishes as donatives, as if they overate themselves to\ndo honour to others. Take away from these men their witnesses and\nspectators: they will take no pleasure in solitary gluttony. You\nmust decide whether your disposition is better suited for vigorous\naction or for tranquil speculation and contemplation, and you must\nadopt whichever the bent of your genius inclines you for. Isocrates\nlaid hands upon Ephorus and led him away from the forum, thinking\nthat he would be more usefully employed in compiling chronicles;\nfor no good is done by forcing one\u2019s mind to engage in uncongenial\nwork: it is vain to struggle against Nature. Yet nothing delights\nthe mind so much as faithful and pleasant friendship: what a {266}\nblessing it is when there is one whose breast is ready to receive\nall your secrets with safety, whose knowledge of your actions you\nfear less than your own conscience, whose conversation removes your\nanxieties, whose advice assists your plans, whose cheerfulness\ndispels your gloom, whose very sight delights you! We should choose\nfor our friends men who are, as far as possible, free from strong\ndesires: for vices are contagious, and pass from a man to his\nneighbour, and injure those who touch them. As, therefore, in times\nof pestilence we have to be careful not to sit near people who are\ninfected and in whom the disease is raging, because by so doing,\nwe shall run into danger and catch the plague from their very breath;\nso, too, in choosing our friends\u2019 dispositions, we must take care\nto select those who are as far as may be unspotted by the world;\nfor the way to breed disease is to mix what is sound with what is\nrotten. Yet I do not advise you to follow after or draw to yourself\nno one except a wise man: for where will you find him whom for so\nmany centuries we have sought in vain? in the place of the best\npossible man take him who is least bad. You would hardly find any\ntime that would have enabled you to make a happier choice than if\nyou could have sought for a good man from among the Platos and\nXenophons and the rest of the produce of the brood of Socrates, or\nif you had been permitted to choose one from the age of Cato: an\nage which bore many men worthy to be born in Cato\u2019s time (just as\nit also bore many men worse than were ever known before, planners\nof the blackest crimes: for it needed both classes in order to make\nCato understood: it wanted both good men, that he might win their\napprobation, and bad men, against whom he could prove his strength):\nbut at the present day, when there is such a dearth of good men,\nyou must be less squeamish in your choice. Above all, however, avoid\ndismal men who grumble at whatever happens, and find something to\ncomplain {267} of in everything. Though he may continue loyal and\nfriendly towards you, still one\u2019s peace of mind is destroyed by a\ncomrade whose mind is soured and who meets every incident with a\ngroan.\nVIII. Let us now pass on to the consideration of property, that\nmost fertile source of human sorrows: for if you compare all the\nother ills from which we suffer\u2014deaths, sicknesses, fears, regrets,\nendurance of pains and labours\u2014 with those miseries which our money\ninflicts upon us, the latter will far outweigh all the others.\nReflect, then, how much less a grief it is never to have had any\nmoney than to have lost it: we shall thus understand that the less\npoverty has to lose, the less torment it has with which to afflict\nus: for you are mistaken if you suppose that the rich bear their\nlosses with greater spirit than the poor: a wound causes the same\namount of pain to the greatest and the smallest body. It was a neat\nsaying of Bion\u2019s, \u201cthat it hurts bald men as much as hairy men to\nhave their hairs pulled out\u201d: you may be assured that the same thing\nis true of rich and poor people, that their suffering is equal: for\ntheir money clings to both classes, and cannot be torn away without\ntheir feeling it: yet it is more endurable, as I have said, and\neasier not to gain property than to lose it, and therefore you will\nfind that those upon whom Fortune has never smiled are more cheerful\nthan those whom she has deserted. Diogenes, a man of infinite spirit,\nperceived this, and made it impossible that anything should be taken\nfrom him. Call this security from loss poverty, want, necessity,\nor any contemptuous name you please: I shall consider such a man\nto be happy, unless you find me another who can lose nothing. If I\nam not mistaken, it is a royal attribute among so many misers,\nsharpers, and robbers, to be the one man who cannot be injured. If\nany one doubts the happiness of Diogenes, he would doubt whether\nthe position of the immortal gods was one of sufficient happiness.\n{268} because they have no farms or gardens, no valuable estates\nlet to strange tenants, and no large loans in the money market. Are\nyou not ashamed of yourself, you who gaze upon riches with astonished\nadmiration? Look upon the universe: you will see the gods quite\nbare of property, and possessing nothing though they give everything.\nDo you think that this man who has stripped himself of all fortuitous\naccessories is a pauper, or one like to the immortal gods? Do you\ncall Demetrius, Pompeius\u2019s freedman, a happier man, he who was not\nashamed to be richer than Pompeius, who was daily furnished with a\nlist of the number of his slaves, as a general is with that of his\narmy, though he had long deserved that all his riches should consist\nof a pair of underlings, and a roomier cell than the other slaves?\nBut Diogenes\u2019s only slave ran away from him, and when he was pointed\nout to Diogenes, he did not think him worth fetching back. \u201cIt is\na shame,\u201d he said, \u201cthat Manes should be able to live without\nDiogenes, and that Diogenes should not be able to live without\nManes.\u201d He seems to me to have said, \u201cFortune, mind your own business:\nDiogenes has nothing left that belongs to you. Did my slave run\naway? nay, he went away from me as a free man.\u201d A household of\nslaves requires food and clothing: the bellies of so many hungry\ncreatures have to be filled: we must buy raiment for them, we must\nwatch their most thievish hands, and we must make use of the services\nof people who weep and execrate us. How far happier is he who is\nindebted to no man for anything except for what he can deprive\nhimself of with the greatest ease! Since we, however, have not such\nstrength of mind as this, we ought at any rate to diminish the\nextent of our property, in order to be less exposed to the assaults\nof fortune: those men whose bodies can be within the shelter of\ntheir armour, are more fitted for war than those whose huge size\neverywhere extends beyond {269} it, and exposes them to wounds: the\nbest amount of property to have is that which is enough to keep us\nfrom poverty, and which yet is not far removed from it.\nIX. We shall be pleased with this measure of wealth if we have\npreviously taken pleasure in thrift, without which no riches are\nsufficient, and with which none are insufficient, especially as the\nremedy is always at hand, and poverty itself by calling in the aid\nof thrift can convert itself into riches. Let us accustom ourselves\nto set aside mere outward show, and to measure things by their uses,\nnot by their ornamental trappings: let our hunger be tamed by food,\nour thirst quenched by drinking, our lust confined within needful\nbounds; let us learn to use our limbs, and to arrange our dress and\nway of life according to what was approved of by our ancestors, not\nin imitation of new-fangled models: let us learn to increase our\ncontinence, to repress luxury, to set bounds to our pride, to assuage\nour anger, to look upon poverty without prejudice, to practise\nthrift, albeit many are ashamed to do so, to apply cheap remedies\nto the wants of nature, to keep all undisciplined hopes and aspirations\nas it were under lock and key, and to make it our business to get\nour riches from ourselves and not from Fortune. We never can so\nthoroughly defeat the vast diversity and malignity of misfortune\nwith which we are threatened as not to feel the weight of many gusts\nif we offer a large spread of canvas to the wind: we must draw our\naffairs into a small compass, to make the darts of Fortune of no\navail. For this reason, sometimes slight mishaps have turned into\nremedies, and more serious disorders have been healed by slighter\nones. When the mind pays no attention to good advice, and cannot\nbe brought to its senses by milder measures, why should we not think\nthat its interests are being served by poverty, disgrace, or financial\nruin being applied to it? one evil is balanced by another. Let us\nthen teach ourselves to be able to {270} dine without all Rome to\nlook on, to be the slaves of fewer slaves, to get clothes which\nfulfil their original purpose, and to live in a smaller house. The\ninner curve is the one to take, not only in running races and in\nthe contests of the circus, but also in the race of life; even\nliterary pursuits, the most becoming thing for a gentleman to spend\nmoney upon, are only justifiable as long as they are kept within\nbounds. What is the use of possessing numberless books and libraries,\nwhose titles their owner can hardly read through in a lifetime? A\nstudent is overwhelmed by such a mass, not instructed, and it is\nmuch better to devote yourself to a few writers than to skim through\nmany. Forty thousand books were burned at Alexandria: some would\nhave praised this library as a most noble memorial of royal wealth,\nlike Titus Livius, who says that it was \u201ca splendid result of the\ntaste and attentive care of the kings.\u201d[5] It had nothing to do\nwith taste or care, but was a piece of learned luxury, nay, not\neven learned, since they amassed it, not for the sake of learning,\nbut to make a show, like many men who know less about letters than\na slave is expected to know, and who uses his books not to help him\nin his studies but to ornament his dining-room. Let a man, then,\nobtain as many books as he wants, but none for show. \u201cIt is more\nrespectable,\u201d say you, \u201cto spend one\u2019s money on such books than on\nvases of Corinthian brass and paintings.\u201d Not so: everything that\nis carried to excess is wrong. What excuses can you find for a man\nwho is eager to buy bookcases of ivory and citrus wood, to collect\nthe works of unknown or discredited authors, and who sits yawning\n{271} amid so many thousands of books, whose backs and titles please\nhim more than any other part of them? Thus in the houses of the\nlaziest of men you will see the works of all the orators and\nhistorians stacked upon book-shelves reaching right up to the\nceiling. At the present day a library has become as necessary an\nappendage to a house as a hot and cold bath. I would excuse them\nstraightway if they really were carried away by an excessive zeal\nfor literature; but as it is, these costly works of sacred genius,\nwith all the illustrations that adorn them, are merely bought for\ndisplay and to serve as wall-furniture.\nX. Suppose, however, that your life has become full of trouble, and\nthat without knowing what you were doing you have fallen into some\nsnare which either public or private Fortune has set for you, and\nthat you can neither untie it nor break it: then remember that\nfettered men suffer much at first from the burdens and clogs upon\ntheir legs: afterwards, when they have made up their minds not to\nfret themselves about them, but to endure them, necessity teaches\nthem to bear them bravely, and habit to bear them easily. In every\nstation of life you will find amusements, relaxations, and enjoyments;\nthat is, provided you be willing to make light of evils rather than\nto hate them. Knowing to what sorrows we were born, there is nothing\nfor which Nature more deserves our thanks than for having invented\nhabit as an alleviation of misfortune, which soon accustoms us to\nthe severest evils. No one could hold out against misfortune if it\npermanently exercised the same force as at its first onset. We are\nall chained to Fortune: some men\u2019s chain is loose and made of gold,\nthat of others is tight and of meaner metal: but what difference\ndoes this make? we are all included in the same captivity, and even\nthose who have bound us are bound themselves, unless you think that\na chain on the left side is lighter to bear: one man may be bound\nby public {272} office, another by wealth: some have to bear the\nweight of illustrious, some of humble birth: some are subject to\nthe commands of others, some only to their own: some are kept in\none place by being banished thither, others by being elected to the\npriesthood. All life is slavery: let each man therefore reconcile\nhimself to his lot, complain of it as little as possible, and lay\nhold of whatever good lies within his reach. No condition can be\nso wretched that an impartial mind can find no compensations in it.\nSmall sites, if ingeniously divided, may be made use of for many\ndifferent purposes, and arrangement will render ever so narrow a\nroom habitable. Call good sense to your aid against difficulties:\nit is possible to soften what is harsh, to widen what is too narrow,\nand to make heavy burdens press less severely upon one who bears\nthem skilfully. Moreover, we ought not to allow our desires to\nwander far afield, but we must make them confine themselves to our\nimmediate neighbourhood, since they will not endure to be altogether\nlocked up. We must leave alone things which either cannot come to\npass or can only be effected with difficulty, and follow after such\nthings as are near at hand and within reach of our hopes, always\nremembering that all things are equally unimportant, and that though\nthey have a different outward appearance, they are all alike empty\nwithin. Neither let us envy those who are in high places: the heights\nwhich look lofty to us are steep and rugged. Again, those whom\nunkind fate has placed in critical situations will be safer if they\nshow as little pride in their proud position as may be, and do all\nthey are able to bring down their fortunes to the level of other\nmen\u2019s. There are many who must needs cling to their high pinnacle\nof power, because they cannot descend from it save by falling\nheadlong: yet they assure us that their greatest burden is being\nobliged to be burdensome to others, and that they are nailed to\ntheir lofty post rather than raised to it: let {273} them then, by\ndispensing justice, clemency, and kindness with an open and liberal\nhand, provide themselves with assistance to break their fall, and\nlooking forward to this maintain their position more hopefully. Yet\nnothing sets us free from these alternations of hope and fear so\nwell as always fixing some limit to our successes, and not allowing\nFortune to choose when to stop our career, but to halt of our own\naccord long before we apparently need do so. By acting thus certain\ndesires will rouse up our spirits, and yet being confined within\nbounds, will not lead us to embark on vast and vague enterprises.\nXI. These remarks of mine apply only to imperfect, commonplace, and\nunsound natures, not to the wise man, who needs not to walk with\ntimid and cautious gait: for he has such confidence in himself that\nhe does not hesitate to go directly in the teeth of Fortune, and\nnever will give way to her. Nor indeed has he any reason for fearing\nher, for he counts not only chattels, property, and high office,\nbut even his body, his eyes, his hands, and everything whose use\nmakes life dearer to us, nay, even his very self, to be things whose\npossession is uncertain; he lives as though he had borrowed them,\nand is ready to return them cheerfully whenever they are claimed.\nYet he does not hold himself cheap, because he knows that he is not\nhis own, but performs all his duties as carefully and prudently as\na pious and scrupulous man would take care of property left in his\ncharge as trustee. When he is bidden to give them up, he will not\ncomplain of Fortune, but will say, \u201cI thank you for what I have had\npossession of: I have managed your property so as largely to increase\nit, but since you order me, I give it back to you and return it\nwillingly and thankfully. If you still wish me to own anything of\nyours, I will keep it for you: if you have other views, I restore\ninto your hands and make restitution of all my wrought and coined\nsilver, my house and my {274} household. Should Nature recall what\nshe previously entrusted us with, let us say to her also: \u2018Take\nback my spirit, which is better than when you gave it me: I do not\nshuffle or hang back. Of my own free will I am ready to return what\nyou gave me before I could think: take me away,\u2019\u201d What hardship can\nthere be in returning to the place from whence one came? a man\ncannot live well if he knows not how to die well. We must, therefore,\ntake away from this commodity its original value, and count the\nbreath of life as a cheap matter. \u201cWe dislike gladiators,\u201d says\nCicero, \u201cif they are eager to save their lives by any means whatever:\nbut we look favourably upon them if they are openly reckless of\nthem,\u201d You may be sure that the same thing occurs with us: we often\ndie because we are afraid of death. Fortune, which regards our lives\nas a show in the arena for her own enjoyment, says, \u201cWhy should I\nspare you, base and cowardly creature that you are? you will be\npierced and hacked with all the more wounds because you know not\nhow to offer your throat to the knife: whereas you, who receive the\nstroke without drawing away your neck or putting up your hands to\nstop it, shall both live longer and die more quickly,\u201d He who fears\ndeath will never act as becomes a living man: but he who knows that\nthis fate was laid upon him as soon as he was conceived will live\naccording to it, and by this strength of mind will gain this further\nadvantage, that nothing can befal him unexpectedly: for by looking\nforward to everything which can happen as though it would happen\nto him, he takes the sting out of all evils, which can make no\ndifference to those who expect it and are prepared to meet it: evil\nonly comes hard upon those who have lived without giving it a thought\nand whose attention has been exclusively directed to happiness.\nDisease, captivity, disaster, conflagration, are none of them\nunexpected: I always knew with what disorderly company {275} Nature\nhad associated me. The dead have often been wailed for in my\nneighbourhood: the torch and taper have often been borne past my\ndoor before the bier of one who has died before his time: the crash\nof falling buildings has often resounded by my side: night has\nsnatched away many of those with whom I have become intimate in the\nforum, the Senate-house, and in society, and has sundered the hands\nwhich were joined in friendship: ought I to be surprised if the\ndangers which have always been circling around me at last assail\nme? How large a part of mankind never think of storms when about\nto set sail? I shall never be ashamed to quote a good saying because\nit comes from a bad author. Publilius, who was a more powerful\nwriter than any of our other playwrights, whether comic or tragic,\nwhenever he chose to rise above farcical absurdities and speeches\naddressed to the gallery, among many other verses too noble even\nfor tragedy, let alone for comedy, has this one:\u2014\n\u201cWhat one hath suffered may befall us all.\u201d\nIf a man takes this into his inmost heart and looks upon all the\nmisfortunes of other men, of which there is always a great plenty,\nin this spirit, remembering that there is nothing to prevent their\ncoming upon him also, he will arm himself against them long before\nthey attack him. It is too late to school the mind to endurance of\nperil after peril has come. \u201cI did not think this would happen,\u201d\nand \u201cWould you ever have believed that this would have happened?\u201d\nsay you. But why should it not? Where are the riches after which\nwant, hunger, and beggary do not follow? what office is there whose\npurple robe, augur\u2019s staff, and patrician reins have not as their\naccompaniment rags and banishment, the brand of infamy, a thousand\ndisgraces, and utter reprobation? what kingdom is there for which\nruin, trampling under foot, a tyrant and a {276} butcher are not\nready at hand? nor are these matters divided by long periods of\ntime, but there is but the space of an hour between sitting on the\nthrone ourselves and clasping the knees of some one else as suppliants.\nKnow then that every station of life is transitory, and that what\nhas ever happened to anybody may happen to you also. You are wealthy:\nare you wealthier than Pompeius?[6] Yet when Gaius,[7] his old\nrelative and new host, opened Caesar\u2019s house to him in order that\nhe might close his own, he lacked both bread and water: though he\nowned so many rivers which both rose and discharged themselves\nwithin his dominions, yet he had to beg for drops of water: he\nperished of hunger and thirst in the palace of his relative, while\nhis heir was contracting for a public funeral for one who was in\nwant of food. You have filled public offices: were they either as\nimportant, as unlooked for, or as all-embracing as those of Sejanus?\nYet on the day on which the Senate disgraced him, the people tore\nhim to pieces: the executioner[8] could find no part left large\nenough to drag to the Tiber, of one upon whom gods and men had\nshowered all that could be given to man. You are a king: I will not\nbid you go to Croesus for an example, he who while yet alive saw\nhis funeral pile both lighted and extinguished, being made to outlive\nnot only his kingdom but even his own death, nor to Jugurtha, whom\nthe people of Rome beheld as a captive within the year in which\nthey had feared him. We have seen Ptolemaeus King of Africa, and\nMithridates King of Armenia, under the charge of Gaius\u2019s[9] guards:\nthe former was sent into exile, the latter chose it in order to\nmake his {277} exile more honourable. Among such continual topsy-turvy\nchanges, unless you expect that whatever can happen will happen to\nyou, you give adversity power against you, a power which can be\ndestroyed by any one who looks at it beforehand.\nXII. The next point to these will be to take care that we do not\nlabour for what is vain, or labour in vain: that is to say, neither\nto desire what we are not able to obtain, nor yet, having obtained\nour desire too late, and after much toil to discover the folly of\nour wishes: in other words, that our labour may not be without\nresult, and that the result may not be unworthy of our labour: for\nas a rule sadness arises from one of these two things, either from\nwant of success or from being ashamed of having succeeded. We must\nlimit the running to and fro which most men practise, rambling about\nhouses, theatres, and market-places. They mind other men\u2019s business,\nand always seem as though they themselves had something to do. If\nyou ask one of them as he comes out of his own door, \u201cWhither are\nyou going?\u201d he will answer, \u201cBy Hercules, I do not know: but I shall\nsee some people and do something.\u201d They wander purposelessly seeking\nfor something to do, and do, not what they have made up their minds\nto do, but what has casually fallen in their way. They move uselessly\nand without any plan, just like ants crawling over bushes, which\ncreep up to the top and then down to the bottom again without gaining\nanything. Many men spend their lives in exactly the same fashion,\nwhich one may call a state of restless indolence. You would pity\nsome of them when you see them running as if their house was on\nfire: they actually jostle all whom they meet, and hurry along\nthemselves and others with them, though all the while they are going\nto salute some one who will not return their greeting, or to attend\nthe funeral of some one whom they did not know: they are going to\nhear the verdict on one {278} who often goes to law, or to see the\nwedding of one who often gets married: they will follow a man\u2019s\nlitter, and in some places will even carry it: afterwards returning\nhome weary with idleness, they swear that they themselves do not\nknow why they went out, or where they have been, and on the following\nday they will wander through the same round again. Let all your\nwork, therefore, have some purpose, and keep some object in view:\nthese restless people are not made restless by labour, but are\ndriven out of their minds by mistaken ideas: for even they do not\nput themselves in motion without any hope: they are excited by the\noutward appearance of something, and their crazy mind cannot see\nits futility. In the same way every one of those who walk out to\nswell the crowd in the streets, is led round the city by worthless\nand empty reasons; the dawn drives him forth, although he has nothing\nto do, and after he has pushed his way into many men\u2019s doors, and\nsaluted their nomenclators one after the other, and been turned\naway from many others, he finds that the most difficult person of\nall to find at home is himself. From this evil habit comes that\nworst of all vices, talebearing and prying into public and private\nsecrets, and the knowledge of many things which it is neither safe\nto tell nor safe to listen to.\nXIII. It was, I imagine, following out this principle that Democritis\ntaught that \u201che who would live at peace must not do much business\neither public or private,\u201d referring of course to unnecessary\nbusiness: for if there be any necessity for it we ought to transact\nnot only much but endless business, both public and private; in\ncases, however, where no solemn duty invites us to act, we had\nbetter keep ourselves quiet: for he who does many things often puts\nhimself in Fortune\u2019s power, and it is safest not to tempt her often,\nbut always to remember her existence, and never to promise oneself\nanything on her security. I will set sail unless anything happens\nto prevent me, I shall {279} be praetor, if nothing hinders me, my\nfinancial operations will succeed, unless anything goes wrong with\nthem. This is why we say that nothing befals the wise man which he\ndid not expect\u2014we do not make him exempt from the chances of human\nlife, but from its mistakes, nor does everything happen to him as\nhe wished it would, but as he thought it would: now his first thought\nwas that his purpose might meet with some resistance, and the pain\nof disappointed wishes must affect a man\u2019s mind less severely if\nhe has not been at all events confident of success.\nXIV. Moreover, we ought to cultivate an easy temper, and not become\nover fond of the lot which fate has assigned to us, but transfer\nourselves to whatever other condition chance may lead us to, and\nfear no alteration, either in our purposes or our position in life,\nprovided that we do not become subject to caprice, which of all\nvices is the most hostile to repose: for obstinacy, from which\nFortune often wrings some concession, must needs be anxious and\nunhappy, but caprice, which can never restrain itself, must be more\nso. Both of these qualities, both that of altering nothing, and\nthat of being dissatisfied with everything, are energies to repose.\nThe mind ought in all cases to be called away from the contemplation\nof external things to that of itself: let it confide in itself,\nrejoice in itself, admire its own works; avoid as far as may be\nthose of others, and devote itself to itself; let it not feel losses,\nand put a good construction even upon misfortunes. Zeno, the chief\nof our school, when he heard the news of a shipwreck, in which all\nhis property had been lost, remarked, \u201cFortune bids me follow\nphilosophy in lighter marching order.\u201d A tyrant threatened Theodorus\nwith death, and even with want of burial. \u201cYou are able to please\nyourself,\u201d he answered, \u201cmy half pint of blood is in your power:\nfor, as for burial, what a fool you must be if you suppose that I\ncare whether I rot above ground or under it.\u201d Julius {280} Kanus,\na man of peculiar greatness, whom even the fact of his having been\nborn in this century does not prevent our admiring, had a long\ndispute with Gaius, and when as he was going away that Phalaris of\na man said to him, \u201cThat you may not delude yourself with any foolish\nhopes, I have ordered you to be executed,\u201d he answered, \u201cI thank\nyou, most excellent prince.\u201d I am not sure what he meant: for many\nways of explaining his conduct occur to me. Did he wish to be\nreproachful, and to show him how great his cruelty must be if death\nbecame a kindness? or did he upbraid him with his accustomed insanity?\nfor even those whose children were put to death, and whose goods\nwere confiscated, used to thank him: or was it that he willingly\nreceived death, regarding it as freedom? Whatever he meant, it was\na magnanimous answer. Some one may say, \u201cAfter this Gaius might\nhave let him live.\u201d Kanus had no fear of this: the good faith with\nwhich Gaius carried out such orders as these was well known. Will\nyou believe that he passed the ten intervening days before his\nexecution without the slightest despondency? it is marvellous how\nthat man spoke and acted, and how peaceful he was. He was playing\nat draughts when the centurion in charge of a number of those who\nwhere going to be executed bade him join them: on the summons he\ncounted his men and said to his companion, \u201cMind you do not tell a\nlie after my death, and say that you won;\u201d then, turning to the\ncenturion, he said \u201cYou will bear me witness that I am one man ahead\nof him.\u201d Do you think that Kanus played upon that draught-board?\nnay, he played with it. His friends were sad at being about to lose\nso great a man: \u201cWhy,\u201d asked he, \u201care you sorrowful? you are enquiring\nwhether our souls are immortal, but I shall presently know.\u201d Nor\ndid he up to the very end cease his search after truth, and raised\narguments upon the subject of his own death. His own teacher of\nphilosophy accompanied him, and they {281} were not far from the\nhill on which the daily sacrifice to Caesar our god was offered,\nwhen he said, \u201cWhat are you thinking of now, Kanus? or what are\nyour ideas?\u201d \u201cI have decided,\u201d answered Kanus, \u201cat that most\nswiftly-passing moment of all to watch whether the spirit will be\nconscious of the act of leaving the body.\u201d He promised, too, that\nif he made any discoveries, he would come round to his friends and\ntell them what the condition of the souls of the departed might be.\nHere was peace in the very midst of the storm: here was a soul\nworthy of eternal life, which used its own fate as a proof of truth,\nwhich when at the last step of life experimented upon his fleeting\nbreath, and did not merely continue to learn until he died, but\nlearned something even from death itself. No man has carried the\nlife of a philosopher further. I will not hastily leave the subject\nof a great man, and one who deserves to be spoken of with respect:\nI will hand thee down to all posterity, thou most noble heart, chief\namong the many victims of Gaius.\nXV. Yet we gain nothing by getting rid of all personal causes of\nsadness, for sometimes we are possessed by hatred of the human race.\nWhen you reflect how rare simplicity is, how unknown innocence, how\nseldom faith is kept, unless it be to our advantage, when you\nremember such numbers of successful crimes, so many equally hateful\nlosses and gains of lust, and ambition so impatient even of its own\nnatural limits that it is willing to purchase distinction by baseness,\nthe mind seems as it were cast into darkness, and shadows rise\nbefore it as though the virtues were all overthrown and we were no\nlonger allowed to hope to possess them or benefited by their\npossession. We ought therefore to bring ourselves into such a state\nof mind that all the vices of the vulgar may not appear hateful to\nus, but merely ridiculous, and we should imitate Democritus rather\nthan Heraclitus. The latter of these, whenever be {282} appeared\nin public, used to weep, the former to laugh: the one thought all\nhuman doings to be follies, the other thought them to be miseries.\nWe must take a higher view of all things, and bear with them more\neasily: it better becomes a man to scoff at life than to lament\nover it. Add to this that he who laughs at the human race deserves\nbetter of it than he who mourns for it, for the former leaves it\nsome good hopes of improvement, while the latter stupidly weeps\nover what he has given up all hopes of mending. He who after surveying\nthe universe cannot control his laughter shows, too, a greater mind\nthan he who cannot restrain his tears, because his mind is only\naffected in the slightest possible degree, and he does not think\nthat any part of all this apparatus is either important, or serious,\nor unhappy. As for the several causes which render us happy or\nsorrowful, let every one describe them for himself, and learn the\ntruth of Bion\u2019s saying, \u201cThat all the doings of men were very like\nwhat he began with, and that there is nothing in their lives which\nis more holy or decent than their conception.\u201d Yet it is better to\naccept public morals and human vices calmly without bursting into\neither laughter or tears; for to be hurt by the sufferings of others\nis to be for ever miserable, while to enjoy the sufferings of others\nis an inhuman pleasure, just as it is a useless piece of humanity\nto weep and pull a long face because some one is burying his son.\nIn one\u2019s own misfortunes, also, one ought so to conduct oneself as\nto bestow upon them just as much sorrow as reason, not as much as\ncustom requires: for many shed tears in order to show them, and\nwhenever no one is looking at them their eyes are dry, but they\nthink it disgraceful not to weep when every one does so. So deeply\nhas this evil of being guided by the opinion of others taken root\nin us, that even grief, the simplest of all emotions, begins to be\ncounterfeited.\n{283}\nXVI. There comes now a part of our subject which is wont with good\ncause to make one sad and anxious: I mean when good men come to bad\nends; when Socrates is forced to die in prison, Rutilius to live\nin exile, Pompeius and Cicero to offer their necks to the swords\nof their own followers, when the great Cato, that living image of\nvirtue, falls upon his sword and rips up both himself and the\nrepublic, one cannot help being grieved that Fortune should bestow\nher gifts so unjustly: what, too, can a good man hope to obtain\nwhen he sees the best of men meeting with the worst fates. Well,\nbut see how each of them endured his fate, and if they endured it\nbravely, long in your heart for courage as great as theirs; if they\ndied in a womanish and cowardly manner, nothing was lost: either\nthey deserved that you should admire their courage, or else they\ndid not deserve that you should wish to imitate their cowardice:\nfor what can be more shameful than that the greatest men should die\nso bravely as to make people cowards. Let us praise one who deserves\nsuch constant praises, and say, \u201cThe braver you are the happier you\nare! You have escaped from all accidents, jealousies, diseases: you\nhave escaped from prison: the gods have not thought you worthy of\nill-fortune, but have thought that fortune no longer deserved to\nhave any power over you\u201d: but when any one shrinks back in the hour\nof death and looks longingly at life, we must lay hands upon him.\nI will never weep for a man who dies cheerfully, nor for one who\ndies weeping: the former wipes away my tears, the latter by his\ntears makes himself unworthy that any should be shed for him. Shall\nI weep for Hercules because he was burned alive, or for Regulus\nbecause he was pierced by so many nails, or for Cato because he\ntore open his wounds a second time? All these men discovered how\nat the cost of a small portion of time they might obtain immortality,\nand by their deaths gained eternal life.\n{284}\nXVII. It also proves a fertile source of troubles if you take pains\nto conceal your feelings and never show yourself to any one\nundisguised, but, as many men do, live an artificial life, in order\nto impose upon others: for the constant watching of himself becomes\na torment to a man, and he dreads being caught doing something at\nvariance with his usual habits, and, indeed, we never can be at our\nease if we imagine that every one who looks at us is weighing our\nreal value: for many things occur which strip people of their\ndisguise, however reluctantly they may part with it, and even if\nall this trouble about oneself is successful, still life is neither\nhappy nor safe when one always has to wear a mask. But what pleasure\nthere is in that honest straight-forwardness which is its own\nornament, and which conceals no part of its character? Yet even\nthis life, which hides nothing from any one runs some risk of being\ndespised; for there are people who disdain whatever they come close\nto: but there is no danger of virtue\u2019s becoming contemptible when\nshe is brought near our eyes, and it is better to be scorned for\none\u2019s simplicity than to bear the burden of unceasing hypocrisy.\nStill, we must observe moderation in this matter, for there is a\ngreat difference between living simply and living slovenly. Moreover,\nwe ought to retire a great deal into ourselves: for association\nwith persons unlike ourselves upsets all that we had arranged,\nrouses the passions which were at rest, and rubs into a sore any\nweak or imperfectly healed place in our minds. Nevertheless we ought\nto mix up these two things, and to pass our lives alternately in\nsolitude and among throngs of people; for the former will make us\nlong for the society of mankind, the latter for that of ourselves,\nand the one will counteract the other: solitude will cure us when\nwe are sick of crowds, and crowds will cure us when we are sick of\nsolitude. Neither ought we always to keep the mind strained to the\n{285} same pitch, but it ought sometimes to be relaxed by amusement.\nSocrates did not blush to play with little boys, Cato used to refresh\nhis mind with wine after he had wearied it with application to\naffairs of state, and Scipio would move his triumphal and soldierly\nlimbs to the sound of music, not with a feeble and halting gait,\nas is the fashion now-a-days, when we sway in our very walk with\nmore than womanly weakness, but dancing as men were wont in the\ndays of old on sportive and festal occasions, with manly bounds,\nthinking it no harm to be seen so doing even by their enemies. Men\u2019s\nminds ought to have relaxation: they rise up better and more vigorous\nafter rest. We must not force crops from rich fields, for an unbroken\ncourse of heavy crops will soon exhaust their fertility, and so\nalso the liveliness of our minds will be destroyed by unceasing\nlabour, but they will recover their strength after a short period\nof rest and relief: for continuous toil produces a sort of numbness\nand sluggishness. Men would not be so eager for this, if play and\namusement did not possess natural attractions for them, although\nconstant indulgence in them takes away all gravity and all strength\nfrom the mind: for sleep, also, is necessary for our refreshment,\nyet if you prolong it for days and nights together it will become\ndeath. There is a great difference between slackening your hold of\na thing and letting it go. The founders of our laws appointed\nfestivals, in order that men might be publicly encouraged to be\ncheerful, and they thought it necessary to vary our labours with\namusements, and, as I said before, some great men have been wont\nto give themselves a certain number of holidays in every month, and\nsome divided every day into play-time and work-time. Thus, I remember\nthat great orator Asinius Pollio would not attend to any business\nafter the tenth hour: he would not even read letters after that\ntime for fear some new {286} trouble should arise, but in those two\nhours[10] used to get rid of the weariness which he had contracted\nduring the whole day. Some rest in the middle of the day, and reserve\nsome light occupation for the afternoon. Our ancestors, too, forbade\nany new motion to be made in the Senate after the tenth hour.\nSoldiers divide their watches, and those who have just returned\nfrom active service are allowed to sleep the whole night undisturbed.\nWe must humour our minds and grant them rest from time to time,\nwhich acts upon them like food, and restores their strength. It\ndoes good also to take walks out of doors, that our spirits may be\nraised and refreshed by the open air and fresh breeze: sometimes\nwe gain strength by driving in a carriage, by travel, by change of\nair, or by social meals and a more generous allowance of wine: at\ntimes we ought to drink even to intoxication, not so as to drown,\nbut merely to dip ourselves in wine: for wine washes away troubles\nand dislodges them from the depths of the mind, and acts as a remedy\nto sorrow as it does to some diseases. The inventor of wine is\ncalled Liber, not from the licence which he gives to our tongues,\nbut because he liberates the mind from the bondage of cares, and\nemancipates it, animates it, and renders it more daring in all that\nit attempts. Yet moderation is wholesome both in freedom and in\nwine. It is believed that Solon and Arcesilaus used to drink deep.\nCato is reproached with drunkenness: but whoever casts this in his\nteeth will find it easier to turn his reproach into a commendation\nthan to prove that Cato did anything wrong: however, we ought not\nto do it often, for fear the mind should contract evil habits,\nthough it ought sometimes to be forced into frolic and frankness,\nand to cast off dull sobriety for a while. If we believe the Greek\npoet, \u201cit is sometimes pleasant to be mad\u201d; again, Plato always\n{287} knocked in vain at the door of poetry when he was sober; or,\nif we trust Aristotle, no great genius has ever been without a touch\nof insanity. The mind cannot use lofty language, above that of the\ncommon herd, unless it be excited. When it has spurned aside the\ncommonplace environments of custom, and rises sublime, instinct\nwith sacred fire, then alone can it chant a song too grand for\nmortal lips: as long as it continues to dwell within itself it\ncannot rise to any pitch of splendour: it must break away from the\nbeaten track, and lash itself to frenzy, till it gnaws the curb and\nrushes away bearing up its rider to heights whither it would fear\nto climb when alone.\nI have now, my beloved Serenus, given you an account of what things\ncan preserve peace of mind, what things can restore it to us, what\ncan arrest the vices which secretly undermine it: yet be assured,\nthat none of these is strong enough to enable us to retain so\nfleeting a blessing, unless we watch over our vacillating mind with\nintense and unremitting care.\n[1] Cf. Juv. ii. 150.\n[2] The chief magistrate of the Greeks.\n[3] The chief magistrate of the Oscans.\n[4] The chief magistrate of the Carthaginians.\n[5] \u201cLivy himself styled the Alexandrian library _elegantiae regum\ncuraeque egregium opus_: a liberal encomium, for which he is pertly\ncriticised by the narrow stoicism of Seneca (Tranq., ch. ix.), whose\nwisdom, on this occasion, deviates into nonsense.\u201d\u2014Gibbon, \u201cDecline\nand Fall,\u201d ch. li, note.\n[6] Haase reads _Ptolemaeus_.\n[7] Caligula.\n[8] It was the duty of the executioner to fasten a hook to the neck\nof condemned criminals, by which they were dragged to the Tiber.\n[9] Caligula.\n[10] The Romans reckoned twelve hours from sunrise to sunset.

The greater part of mankind, my Paulinus, complains of the\nunkindness of Nature, because we are born only for a short space\nof time, and that this allotted period of life runs away so swiftly,\nnay so hurriedly, that with but few exceptions men\u2019s life comes to\nan end just as they are preparing to enjoy it: nor is it only the\ncommon herd and the ignorant vulgar who mourn over this universal\nmisfortune, as they consider it to be: this reflection has wrung\ncomplaints even from great men. Hence comes that well-known saying\nof physicians, that art is long but life is short: hence arose that\nquarrel, so unbefitting a sage, which Aristotle picked with Nature,\nbecause she had indulged animals with such length of days that some\nof them lived for ten or fifteen centuries, while man, although\nborn for many and such great exploits, had the term of his existence\ncut so much shorter. We do not have a very short time assigned to\nus, but we lose a great deal of it: life is long enough to carry\nout the most important projects: we {289} have an ample portion,\nif we do but arrange the whole of it aright: but when it all runs\nto waste through luxury and carelessness, when it is not devoted\nto any good purpose, then at the last we are forced to feel that\nit is all over, although we never noticed how it glided away. Thus\nit is: we do not receive a short life, but we make it a short one,\nand we are not poor in days, but wasteful of them. When great and\nkinglike riches fall into the hands of a bad master, they are\ndispersed straightway, but even a moderate fortune, when bestowed\nupon a wise guardian, increases by use: and in like manner our life\nhas great opportunities for one who knows how to dispose of it to\nthe best advantage.\nII. Why do we complain of Nature? she has dealt kindly with us.\nLife is long enough, if you know how to use it. One man is possessed\nby an avarice which nothing can satisfy, another by a laborious\ndiligence in doing what is totally useless: another is sodden by\nwine: another is benumbed by sloth: one man is exhausted by an\nambition which makes him court the good will of others[2]: another,\nthrough his eagerness as a merchant, is led to visit every land and\nevery sea by the hope of gain: some are plagued by the love of\nsoldiering, and are always either endangering other men\u2019s lives or\nin trembling for their own: some wear away their lives in that\nvoluntary slavery, the unrequited service of great men: many are\noccupied either in laying claim to other men\u2019s fortune or in\ncomplaining of their own: a great number have no settled purpose,\nand are tossed from one new scheme to another by a rambling,\ninconsistent, dissatisfied, fickle habit of mind: some care for no\nobject sufficiently to try to attain it, but lie lazily yawning\nuntil their fate comes upon them: so that I cannot {290} doubt the\ntruth of that verse which the greatest of poets has dressed in the\nguise of an oracular response\u2014\n\u201cWe live a small part only of our lives.\u201d\nBut all duration is time, not life: vices press upon us and surround\nus on every side, and do not permit us to regain our feet, or to\nraise our eyes and gaze upon truth, but when we are down keep us\nprostrate and chained to low desires. Men who are in this condition\nare never allowed to come to themselves: if ever by chance they\nobtain any rest, they roll to and fro like the deep sea, which\nheaves and tosses after a gale, and they never have any respite\nfrom their lusts. Do you suppose that I speak of those whose ills\nare notorious? Nay, look at those whose prosperity all men run to\nsee: they are choked by their own good things. To how many men do\nriches prove a heavy burden? how many men\u2019s eloquence and continual\ndesire to display their own cleverness has cost them their lives?[3]\nhow many are sallow with constant sensual indulgence? how many have\nno freedom left them by the tribe of clients that surges around\nthem? Look through all these, from the lowest to the highest:\u2014this\nman calls his friends to support him, this one is present in court,\nthis one is the defendant, this one pleads for him, this one is on\nthe jury: but no one lays claim to his own self, every one wastes\nhis time over some one else. Investigate those men, whose names are\nin every one\u2019s mouth: you will find that they bear just the same\nmarks: A is devoted to B, and B to C: no one belongs to himself.\nMoreover some men are full of most irrational anger: they complain\nof the insolence of their chiefs, because they have not granted\nthem an audience when they wished for it; as if a man had any right\nto complain of being so haughtily shut out by another, when he never\nhas {291} leisure to give his own conscience a hearing. This chief\nof yours, whoever he is, though he may look at you in an offensive\nmanner, still will some day look at you, open his ears to your\nwords, and give you a seat by his side: but you never design to\nlook upon yourself, to listen to your own grievances. You ought\nnot, then, to claim these services from another, especially since\nwhile you yourself were doing so, you did not wish for an interview\nwith another man, but were not able to obtain one with yourself.[4]\nIII. Were all the brightest intellects of all time to employ\nthemselves on this one subject, they never could sufficiently express\ntheir wonder at this blindness of men\u2019s minds: men will not allow\nany one to establish himself upon their estates, and upon the most\ntrifling dispute about the measuring of boundaries, they betake\nthemselves to stones and cudgels: yet they allow others to encroach\nupon {292} their lives, nay, they themselves actually lead others\nin to take possession of them. You cannot find any one who wants\nto distribute his money; yet among how many people does every one\ndistribute his life? men covetously guard their property from waste,\nbut when it comes to waste of time, they are most prodigal of that\nof which it would become them to be sparing. Let us take one of the\nelders, and say to him, \u201cWe perceive that you have arrived at the\nextreme limits of human life: you are in your hundredth year, or\neven older. Come now, reckon up your whole life in black and white:\ntell us how much of your time has been spent upon your creditors,\nhow much on your mistress, how much on your king, how much on your\nclients, how much in quarrelling with your wife, how much in keeping\nyour slaves in order, how much in running up and down the city on\nbusiness. Add to this the diseases which we bring upon us with our\nown hands, and the time which has laid idle without any use having\nbeen made of it; you will see that you have not lived as many years\nas you count. Look back in your memory and see how often you have\nbeen consistent in your projects, how many days passed as you\nintended them to do when you were at your own disposal, how often\nyou did not change colour and your spirit did not quail, how much\nwork you have done in so long a time, how many people have without\nyour knowledge stolen parts of your life from you, how much you\nhave lost, how large a part has been taken up by useless grief,\nfoolish gladness, greedy desire, or polite conversation; how little\nof yourself is left to you: you will then perceive that you will\ndie prematurely.\u201d What, then, is the reason of this? It is that\npeople live as though they would live for ever: you never remember\nyour human frailty; you never notice how much of your time has\nalready gone by: you spend it as though you had an abundant and\noverflowing store of it, though all the while that day which you\ndevote {293} to some man or to some thing is perhaps your last. You\nfear everything, like mortals as you are, and yet you desire\neverything as if you were immortals. You will hear many men say,\n\u201cAfter my fiftieth year I will give myself up to leisure: my sixtieth\nshall be my last year of public office\u201d: and what guarantee have\nyou that your life will last any longer? who will let all this go\non just as you have arranged it? are you not ashamed to reserve\nonly the leavings of your life for yourself, and appoint for the\nenjoyment of your own right mind only that time which you cannot\ndevote to any business? How late it is to begin life just when we\nhave to be leaving it! What a foolish forgetfulness of our mortality,\nto put off wholesome counsels until our fiftieth or sixtieth year,\nand to choose that our lives shall begin at a point which few of\nus ever reach.\nIV. You will find that the most powerful and highly-placed men let\nfall phrases in which they long for leisure, praise it, and prefer\nit to all the blessings which they enjoy. Sometimes they would fain\ndescend from their lofty pedestal, if it could be safely done: for\nFortune collapses by its own weight, without any shock or interference\nfrom without. The late Emperor Augustus, upon whom the gods bestowed\nmore blessings than on any one else, never ceased to pray for rest\nand exemption from the troubles of empire: he used to enliven his\nlabours with this sweet, though unreal consolation, that he would\nsome day live for himself alone. In a letter which he addressed to\nthe Senate, after promising that his rest shall not be devoid of\ndignity nor discreditable to his former glories, I find the following\nwords:\u2014\u201dThese things, however, it is more honourable to do than to\npromise: but my eagerness for that time, so earnestly longed for,\nhas led me to derive a certain pleasure from speaking about it,\nthough the reality is still far distant.\u201d[5] He thought leisure so\nimportant, that though {294} he could not actually enjoy it, yet\nhe did so by anticipation and by thinking about it. He, who saw\neverything depending upon himself alone, who swayed the fortunes\nof men and of nations, thought that his happiest day would be that\non which he laid aside his greatness. He knew by experience how\nmuch labour was involved in that glory that shone through all lands,\nand how much secret anxiety was concealed within it: he had been\nforced to assert his rights by war, first with his countrymen, next\nwith his colleagues, and lastly with his own relations, and had\nshed blood both by sea and by land: after marching his troops under\narms through Macedonia, Sicily, Egypt, Syria, Asia Minor, and almost\nall the countries of the world, when they were weary with slaughtering\nRomans he had directed them against a foreign foe. While he was\npacifying the Alpine regions, and subduing the enemies whom he found\nin the midst of the Roman empire, while he was extending its\nboundaries beyond the Rhine, the Euphrates, and the Danube, at Rome\nitself the swords of Murena, Caepio, Lepidus, Egnatius, and others\nwere being sharpened to slay him. Scarcely had he escaped from their\nplot, when his already failing age was terrified by his daughter\nand all the noble youths who were pledged to her cause by adultery\nwith her by way of oath of fidelity. Then there was Paulus and\nAntonius\u2019s mistress, a second time to be {295} feared by Rome: and\nwhen he had cut out these ulcers from his very limbs, others grew\nin their place: the empire, like a body overloaded with blood, was\nalways breaking out somewhere. For this reason he longed for leisure:\nall his labours were based upon hopes and thoughts of leisure: this\nwas the wish of him who could accomplish the wishes of all other\nmen.\nV. While tossed hither and thither by Catiline and Clodius, Pompeius\nand Crassus, by some open enemies and some doubtful friends, while\nhe struggled with the struggling republic and kept it from going\nto ruin, when at last he was banished, being neither able to keep\nsilence in prosperity nor to endure adversity with patience, how\noften must Marcus Cicero have cursed that consulship of his which\nhe never ceased to praise, and which nevertheless deserved it? What\npiteous expressions he uses in a letter to Atticus when Pompeius\nthe father had been defeated, and his son was recruiting his shattered\nforces in Spain? \u201cDo you ask,\u201d writes he, \u201cwhat I am doing here? I\nam living in my Tusculan villa almost as a prisoner.\u201d He adds more\nafterwards, wherein he laments his former life, complains of the\npresent, and despairs of the future. Cicero called himself \u201chalf a\nprisoner,\u201d but, by Hercules, the wise man never would have come\nunder so lowly a title: he never would be half a prisoner, but would\nalways enjoy complete and entire liberty, being free, in his own\npower, and greater than all others: for what can be greater than\nthe man who is greater than Fortune?\nVI. When Livius Drusus, a vigorous and energetic man, brought forward\nbills for new laws and radical measures of the Gracchus pattern,\nbeing the centre of a vast mob of all the peoples of Italy, and\nseeing no way to solve the question, since he was not allowed to\ndeal with it as he wished, and yet was not free to throw it up after\nhaving once taken part in it, complained bitterly of his life, which\nhad been {296} one of unrest from the very cradle, and said, we are\ntold, that \u201che was the only person who had never had any holidays\neven when he was a boy.\u201d Indeed, while he was still under age and\nwearing the praetexta, he had the courage to plead the cause of\naccused persons in court, and to make use of his influence so\npowerfully that it is well known that in some causes his exertions\ngained a verdict. Where would such precocious ambition stop? You\nmay be sure that one who showed such boldness as a child would end\nby becoming a great pest both in public and in private life: it was\ntoo late for him to complain that he had had no holidays, when from\nhis boyhood he had been a firebrand and a nuisance in the courts.\nIt is a stock question whether he committed suicide: for he fell\nby a sudden wound in the groin, and some doubted whether his death\nwas caused by his own hand, though none disputed its having happened\nmost seasonably. It would be superfluous to mention more who, while\nothers thought them the happiest of men, have themselves borne true\nwitness to their own feelings, and have loathed all that they have\ndone for all the years of their lives: yet by these complaints they\nhave effected no alteration either in others or in themselves: for\nafter these words have escaped them their feelings revert to their\naccustomed frame. By Hercules, that life of you great men, even\nthough it should last for more than a thousand years, is still a\nvery short one: those vices of yours would swallow up any extent\nof time: no wonder if this our ordinary span, which, though Nature\nhurries on, can be enlarged by common sense, soon slips away from\nyou: for you do not lay hold of it or hold it back, and try to delay\nthe swiftest of all things, but you let it pass as though it were\na useless thing and you could supply its place.\nVII. Among these I reckon in the first place those who devote their\ntime to nothing but drinking and debauchery: {297} for no men are\nbusied more shamefully: the others, although the glory which they\npursue is but a counterfeit, still deserve some credit for their\npursuit of it\u2014though you may tell me of misers, of passionate men,\nof men who hate and who even wage war without a cause\u2014yet all such\nmen sin like men: but the sin of those who are given up to gluttony\nand lust is a disgraceful one. Examine all the hours of their lives:\nconsider how much time they spend in calculation, how much in\nplotting, how much in fear, how much in giving and deceiving flattery,\nhow much in entering into recognizances for themselves or for others,\nhow much in banquets, which indeed become a serious business, you\nwill see that they are not allowed any breathing time either by\ntheir pleasures or their pains. Finally, all are agreed that nothing,\nneither eloquence nor literature, can be done properly by one who\nis occupied with something else; for nothing can take deep root in\na mind which is directed to some other subject, and which rejects\nwhatever you try to stuff into it. No man knows less about living\nthan a business man: there is nothing about which it is more difficult\nto gain knowledge. Other arts have many folk everywhere who profess\nto teach them: some of them can be so thoroughly learned by mere\nboys, that they are able to teach them to others: but one\u2019s whole\nlife must be spent in learning how to live, and, which may perhaps\nsurprise you more, one\u2019s whole life must be spent in learning how\nto die. Many excellent men have freed themselves from all hindrances,\nhave given up riches, business, and pleasure, and have made it their\nduty to the very end of their lives to learn how to live: and yet\nthe larger portion of them leave this life confessing that they do\nnot yet know how to live, and still less know how to live as wise\nmen. Believe me, it requires a great man and one who is superior\nto human frailties not to allow any of his time to be filched from\nhim: {298} and therefore it follows that his life is a very long\none, because he devotes every possible part of it to himself: no\nportion lies idle or uncultivated, or in another man\u2019s power; for\nhe finds nothing worthy of being exchanged for his time, which he\nhusbands most grudgingly. He, therefore, had time enough: whereas\nthose who gave up a great part of their lives to the people of\nnecessity had not enough. Yet you need not suppose that the latter\nwere not sometimes conscious of their loss: indeed, you will hear\nmost of those who are troubled with great prosperity every now and\nthen cry out amid their hosts of clients, their pleadings in court,\nand their other honourable troubles, \u201cI am not allowed to live my\nown life.\u201d Why is he not allowed? because all those who call upon\nyou to defend them, take you away from yourself. How many of your\ndays have been spent by that defendant? by that candidate for office?\nby that old woman who is weary with burying her heirs? by that man\nwho pretends to be ill, in order to excite the greed of those who\nhope to inherit his property? by that powerful friend of yours, who\nuses you to swell his train, not to be his friend? Balance your\naccount, and run over all the days of your life; you will see that\nonly a very few days, and only those which were useless for any\nother purpose, have been left to you. He who has obtained the\n_fasces_[6] for which he longed, is eager to get rid of them, and\nis constantly saying, \u201cWhen will this year be over?\u201d another exhibits\npublic games, and once would have given a great deal for the chance\nof doing so, but now \u201cwhen,\u201d says he, \u201cshall I escape from this?\u201d\nanother is an advocate who is fought for in all the courts, and who\ndraws immense audiences, who crowd all the forum to a far greater\ndistance than they can hear him; \u201cWhen,\u201d says he, \u201cwill vacation-time\ncome?\u201d Every man hurries through his life, and {299} suffers from\na yearning for the future, and a weariness of the present: but he\nwho disposes of all his time for his own purposes, who arranges all\nhis days as though he were arranging the plan of his life, neither\nwishes for nor fears the morrow: for what new pleasure can any hour\nnow bestow upon him? he knows it all, and has indulged in it all\neven to satiety. Fortune may deal with the rest as she will, his\nlife is already safe from her: such a man may gain something, but\ncannot lose anything: and, indeed, he can only gain anything in the\nsame way as one who is already glutted and filled can get some extra\nfood which he takes although he does not want it. You have no\ngrounds, therefore, for supposing that any one has lived long,\nbecause he has wrinkles or grey hairs: such a man has not lived\nlong, but has only been long alive. Why! would you think that a man\nhad voyaged much if a fierce gale had caught him as soon as he left\nhis port, and he had been driven round and round the same place\ncontinually by a succession of winds blowing from opposite quarters?\nsuch a man has not travelled much, he has only been much tossed\nabout.\nVIII. I am filled with wonder when I see some men asking others for\ntheir time, and those who are asked for it most willing to give it:\nboth parties consider the object for which the time is given, but\nneither of them thinks of the time itself, as though in asking for\nthis one asked for nothing, and in giving it one gave nothing: we\nplay with what is the most precious of all things: yet it escapes\nmen\u2019s notice, because it is an incorporeal thing, and because it\ndoes not come before our eyes; and therefore it is held very cheap,\nnay, hardly any value whatever is put upon it. Men set the greatest\nstore upon presents or pensions, and hire out their work, their\nservices, or their care in order to gain them: no one values time:\nthey give it much more freely, as though it cost nothing. Yet you\nwill see these {300} same people clasping the knees of their physician\nas suppliants when they are sick and in present peril of death, and\nif threatened with a capital charge willing to give all that they\npossess in order that they may live: so inconsistent are they.\nIndeed, if the number of every man\u2019s future years could be laid\nbefore him, as we can lay that of his past years, how anxious those\nwho found that they had but few years remaining would be to make\nthe most of them? Yet it is easy to arrange the distribution of a\nquantity, however small, if we know how much there is: what you\nought to husband most carefully is that which may run short you\nknow not when. Yet you have no reason to suppose that they do not\nknow how dear a thing time is: they are wont to say to those whom\nthey especially love that they are ready to give them a part of\ntheir own years. They do give them, and know not that they are\ngiving them; but they give them in such a manner that they themselves\nlose them without the others gaining them. They do not, however,\nknow whence they obtain their supply, and therefore they are able\nto endure the waste of what is not seen: yet no one will give you\nback your years, no one will restore them to you again: your life\nwill run its course when once it has begun, and will neither begin\nagain or efface what it has done. It will make no disturbance, it\nwill give you no warning of how fast it flies: it will move silently\non: it will not prolong itself at the command of a king, or at the\nwish of a nation: as it started on its first day, so it will run:\nit will never turn aside, never delay. What follows, then? Why! you\nare busy, but life is hurrying on: death will be here some time or\nother, and you must attend to him, whether you will or no.\nIX. Can anything be mentioned which is more insane than the ideas\nof leisure of those people who boast of their worldly wisdom? They\nlive laboriously, in order that {301} they may live better; they\nfit themselves out for life at the expense of life itself, and cast\ntheir thoughts a long way forwards: yet postponement is the greatest\nwaste of life: it wrings day after day from us, and takes away the\npresent by promising something hereafter: there is no such obstacle\nto true living as waiting, which loses to-day while it is depending\non the morrow. You dispose of that which is in the hand of Fortune,\nand you let go that which is in your own. Whither are you looking,\nwhither are you stretching forward? everything future is uncertain:\nlive now straightway. See how the greatest of bards cries to you\nand sings in wholesome verse as though inspired with celestial\nfire:\u2014\n\u201cThe best of wretched mortals\u2019 days is that Which is the first\nto fly.\u201d\nWhy do you hesitate, says he, why do you stand back? unless you\nseize it it will have fled: and even if you do seize it, it will\nstill fly. Our swiftness in making use of our time ought therefore\nto vie with the swiftness of time itself, and we ought to drink of\nit as we should of a fast-running torrent which will not be always\nrunning. The poet, too, admirably satirizes our boundless thoughts,\nwhen he says, not \u201cthe first age,\u201d but \u201cthe first day.\u201d Why are you\ncareless and slow while time is flying so fast, and why do you\nspread out before yourself a vision of long months and years, as\nmany as your greediness requires? he talks with you about one day,\nand that a fast-fleeting one. There can, then, be no doubt that the\nbest days are those which fly first for wretched, that is, for busy\nmortals, whose minds are still in their childhood when old age comes\nupon them, and they reach it unprepared and without arms to combat\nit. They have never looked forward: they have all of a sudden\nstumbled upon old age: they never noticed that it was stealing upon\nthem day by day. As conversation, or reading, or deep thought\ndeceives travellers, and they find {302} themselves at their journey\u2019s\nend before they knew that it was drawing near, so in this fast and\nnever-ceasing journey of life, which we make at the same pace whether\nwe are asleep or awake, busy people never notice that they are\nmoving till they are at the end of it.\nX. If I chose to divide this proposition into separate steps,\nsupported by evidence, many things occur to me by which I could\nprove that the lives of busy men are the shortest of all. Fabianus,\nwho was none of your lecture-room philosophers, but one of the true\nantique pattern, used to say, \u201cWe ought to fight against the passions\nby main force, not by skirmishing, and upset their line of battle\nby a home charge, not by inflicting trifling wounds: I do not approve\nof dallying with sophisms; they must be crushed, not merely scratched.\u201d\nYet, in order that sinners may be confronted with their errors,\nthey must be taught, and not merely mourned for. Life is divided\ninto three parts: that which has been, that which is, and that which\nis to come: of these three stages, that which we are passing through\nis brief, that which we are about to pass is uncertain, and that\nwhich we have passed is certain: this it is over which Fortune has\nlost her rights, and which can fall into no other man\u2019s power: and\nthis is what busy men lose: for they have no leisure to look back\nupon the past, and even if they had, they take no pleasure in\nremembering what they regret: they are, therefore, unwilling to\nturn their minds to the contemplation of ill-spent time, and they\nshrink from reviewing a course of action whose faults become glaringly\napparent when handled a second time, although they were snatched\nat when we were under the spell of immediate gratification. No one,\nunless all his acts have been submitted to the infallible censorship\nof his own conscience, willingly turns his thoughts back upon the\npast. He who has ambitiously desired, haughtily scorned, passionately\nvanquished, treacherously deceived, greedily snatched, or prodigally\n{303} wasted much, must needs fear his own memory; yet this is a\nholy and consecrated part of our time, beyond the reach of all human\naccidents, removed from the dominion of Fortune, and which cannot\nbe disquieted by want, fear, or attacks of sickness: this can neither\nbe troubled nor taken away from one: we possess it for ever\nundisturbed. Our present consists only of single days, and those,\ntoo, taken one hour at a time: but all the days of past times appear\nbefore us when bidden, and allow themselves to be examined and\nlingered over, albeit busy men cannot find time for so doing. It\nis the privilege of a tranquil and peaceful mind to review all the\nparts of its life: but the minds of busy men are like animals under\nthe yoke, and cannot bend aside or look back. Consequently, their\nlife passes away into vacancy, and as you do no good however much\nyou may pour into a vessel which cannot keep or hold what you put\nthere, so also it matters not how much time you give men if it can\nfind no place to settle in, but leaks away through the chinks and\nholes of their minds. Present time is very short, so much so that\nto some it seems to be no time at all; for it is always in motion,\nand runs swiftly away: it ceases to exist before it comes, and can\nno more brook delay than can the universe or the host of heaven,\nwhose unresting movement never lets them pause on their way. Busy\nmen, therefore, possess present time, alone, that being so short\nthat they cannot grasp it, and when they are occupied with many\nthings they lose even this.\nXI. In a word, do you want to know for how short a time they live?\nsee how they desire to live long: broken-down old men beg in their\nprayers for the addition of a few more years: they pretend to be\nyounger than they are: they delude themselves with their own lies,\nand are as willing to cheat themselves as if they could cheat Fate\nat the same time: when at last some weakness reminds them that they\n{304} are mortal, they die as it were in terror: they may rather\nbe said to be dragged out of this life than to depart from it. They\nloudly exclaim that they have been fools and have not lived their\nlives, and declare that if they only survive this sickness they\nwill spend the rest of their lives at leisure: at such times they\nreflect how uselessly they have laboured to provide themselves with\nwhat they have never enjoyed, and how all their toil has gone for\nnothing: but those whose life is spent without any engrossing\nbusiness may well find it ample: no part of it is made over to\nothers, or scattered here and there; no part is entrusted to Fortune,\nis lost by neglect, is spent in ostentatious giving, or is useless:\nall of it is, so to speak, invested at good interest. A very small\namount of it, therefore, is abundantly sufficient, and so, when his\nlast day arrives, the wise man will not hang back, but will walk\nwith a steady step to meet death.\nXII. Perhaps you will ask me whom I mean by \u201cbusy men\u201d? you need\nnot think that I allude only to those who are hunted out of the\ncourts of justice with dogs at the close of the proceedings, those\nwhom you see either honourably jostled by a crowd of their own\nclients or contemptuously hustled in visits of ceremony by strangers,\nwho call them away from home to hang about their patron\u2019s doors,\nor who make use of the praetor\u2019s sales by auction to acquire infamous\ngains which some day will prove their own ruin. Some men\u2019s leisure\nis busy: in their country house or on their couch, in complete\nsolitude, even though they have retired from all men\u2019s society,\nthey still continue to worry themselves: we ought not to say that\nsuch men\u2019s life is one of leisure, but their very business is sloth.\nWould you call a man idle who expends anxious finicking care in the\narrangement of his Corinthian bronzes, valuable only through the\nmania of a few connoisseurs? and who passes the greater part of his\ndays among plates of rusty metal? who sits in the palaestra (shame,\nthat our very vices {305} should be foreign) watching boys wrestling?\nwho distributes his gangs of fettered slaves into pairs according\nto their age and colour? who keeps athletes of the latest fashion?\nWhy, do you call those men idle, who pass many hours at the barber\u2019s\nwhile the growth of the past night is being plucked out by the\nroots, holding councils over each several hair, while the scattered\nlocks are arranged in order and those which fall back are forced\nforward on to the forehead? How angry they become if the shaver is\na little careless, as though he were shearing a _man_! what a white\nheat they work themselves into if some of their mane is cut away,\nif some part of it is ill-arranged, if all their ringlets do not\nlie in regular order! who of them would not rather that the state\nwere overthrown than that his hair should be ruffled? who does not\ncare more for the appearance of his head than for his health? who\nwould not prefer ornament to honour? Do you call these men idle,\nwho make a business of the comb and looking-glass? what of those\nwho devote their lives to composing, hearing, and learning songs,\nwho twist their voices, intended by Nature to sound best and simplest\nwhen used straightforwardly, through all the turns of futile melodies:\nwhose fingers are always beating time to some music on which they\nare inwardly meditating; who, when invited to serious and even sad\nbusiness may be heard humming an air to themselves?\u2014such people are\nnot at leisure, but are busy about trifles. As for their banquets,\nby Hercules, I cannot reckon them among their unoccupied times when\nI see with what anxious care they set out their plate, how laboriously\nthey arrange the girdles of their waiters\u2019 tunics, how breathlessly\nthey watch to see how the cook dishes up the wild boar, with what\nspeed, when the signal is given, the slave-boys run to perform their\nduties, how skilfully birds are carved into pieces of the right\nsize, how painstakingly wretched youths wipe up the spittings of\ndrunken men. By these means men seek credit for taste {306} and\ngrandeur, and their vices follow them so far into their privacy\nthat they can neither eat nor drink without a view to effect. Nor\nshould I count those men idle who have themselves carried hither\nand thither in sedans and litters, and who look forward to their\nregular hour for taking this exercise as though they were not allowed\nto omit it: men who are reminded by some one else when to bathe,\nwhen to swim, when to dine: they actually reach such a pitch of\nlanguid effeminacy as not to be able to find out for themselves\nwhether they are hungry. I have heard one of these luxurious folk\u2014if\nindeed, we ought to give the name of luxury to unlearning the life\nand habits of a man\u2014when he was carried in men\u2019s arms out of the\nbath and placed in his chair, say inquiringly, \u201cAm I seated?\u201d Do\nyou suppose that such a man as this, who did not know when he was\nseated, could know whether he was alive, whether he could see,\nwhether he was at leisure? I can hardly say whether I pity him more\nif he really did not know or if he pretended not to know this. Such\npeople do really become unconscious of much, but they behave as\nthough they were unconscious of much more: they delight in some\nfailings because they consider them to be proofs of happiness: it\nseems the part of an utterly low and contemptible man to know what\nhe is doing. After this, do you suppose that playwrights draw largely\nupon their imaginations in their burlesques upon luxury: by Hercules,\nthey omit more than they invent; in this age, inventive in this\nalone, such a number of incredible vices have been produced, that\nalready you are able to reproach the playwrights with omitting to\nnotice them. To think that there should be any one who had so far\nlost his senses through luxury as to take some one else\u2019s opinion\nas to whether he was sitting or not? This man certainly is not at\nleisure: you must bestow a different title on him: he is sick, or\nrather dead: he only is at leisure who feels that he is at leisure:\nbut this creature is {307} only half alive, if he wants some one\nto tell him what position his body is in. How can such a man be\nable to dispose of any time?\nXIII. It would take long to describe the various individuals who\nhave wasted their lives over playing at draughts, playing at ball,\nor toasting their bodies in the sun: men are not at leisure if their\npleasures partake of the character of business, for no one will\ndoubt that those persons are laborious triflers who devote themselves\nto the study of futile literary questions, of whom there is already\na great number in Rome also. It used to be a peculiarly Greek disease\nof the mind to investigate how many rowers Ulysses had, whether the\nIliad or the Odyssey was written first, and furthermore, whether\nthey were written by the same author, with other matters of the\nsame stamp, which neither please your inner consciousness if you\nkeep them to yourself, nor make you seem more learned, but only\nmore troublesome, if you publish them abroad. See, already this\nvain longing to learn what is useless has taken hold of the Romans:\nthe other day I heard somebody telling who was the first Roman\ngeneral who did this or that: Duillius was the first who won a\nsea-fight, Curius Dentatus was the first who drove elephants in his\ntriumph: moreover, these stories, though they add nothing to real\nglory, do nevertheless deal with the great deeds of our countrymen:\nsuch knowledge is not profitable, yet it claims our attention as a\nfascinating kind of folly. I will even pardon those who want to\nknow who first persuaded the Romans to go on board ship. It was\nClaudius, who for this reason was surnamed Caudex, because any piece\nof carpentry formed of many planks was called _caudex_ by the ancient\nRomans, for which reason public records are called _Codices_, and\nby old custom the ships which ply on the Tiber with provisions are\ncalled _codicariae_. Let us also allow that it is to the point to\ntell how Valerius Corvinus was the first {308} to conquer Messana,\nand first of the family of the Valerii transferred the name of the\ncaptured city to his own, and was called Messana, and how the people\ngradually corrupted the pronunciation and called him Messalla: or\nwould you let any one find interest in Lucius Sulla having been the\nfirst to let lions loose in the circus, they having been previously\nexhibited in chains, and hurlers of darts having been sent by King\nBocchus to kill them? This may be permitted to their curiosity: but\ncan it serve any useful purpose to know that Pompeius was the first\nto exhibit eighteen elephants in the circus, who were matched in a\nmimic battle with some convicts? The leading man in the state, and\none who, according to tradition, was noted among the ancient leaders\nof the state for his transcendent goodness of heart, thought it a\nnotable kind of show to kill men in a manner hitherto unheard of.\nDo they fight to the death? that is not cruel enough: are they torn\nto pieces? that is not cruel enough: let them be crushed flat by\nanimals of enormous bulk. It would be much better that such a thing\nshould be forgotten, for fear that hereafter some potentate might\nhear of it and envy its refined barbarity. O, how doth excessive\nprosperity blind our intellects! at the moment at which he was\ncasting so many troops of wretches to be trampled on by outlandish\nbeasts, when he was proclaiming war between such different creatures,\nwhen he was shedding so much blood before the eyes of the Roman\npeople, whose blood he himself was soon to shed even more freely,\nhe thought himself the master of the whole world; yet he afterwards,\ndeceived by the treachery of the Alexandrians, had to offer himself\nto the dagger of the vilest of slaves, and then at last discovered\nwhat an empty boast was his surname of \u201cThe Great.\u201d But to return\nto the point from which I have digressed, I will prove that even\non this very subject some people expend useless pains. The same\nauthor tells us that {309} Metellus, when he triumphed after having\nconquered the Carthaginians in Sicily, was the only Roman who ever\nhad a hundred and twenty captured elephants led before his car: and\nthat Sulla was the last Roman who extended the pomoerium,[7] which\nit was not the custom of the ancients to extend on account of the\nconquest of provincial, but only of Italian territory. Is it more\nuseful to know this, than to know that the Mount Aventine, according\nto him, is outside of the pomoerium, for one of two reasons, either\nbecause it was thither that the plebeians seceded, or because when\nRemus took his auspices on that place the birds which he saw were\nnot propitious: and other stories without number of the like sort,\nwhich are either actual falsehoods or much the same as falsehoods?\nfor even if you allow that these authors speak in all good faith,\nif they pledge themselves for the truth of what they write, still,\nwhose mistakes will be made fewer by such stories? whose passions\nwill be restrained? whom will they make more brave, more just, or\nmore gentlemanly? My friend Fabianus used to say that he was not\nsure that it was not better not to apply oneself to any studies at\nall than to become interested in these.\nXIV. The only persons who are really at leisure are those who devote\nthemselves to philosophy: and they alone really live: for they do\nnot merely enjoy their own lifetime, but they annex every century\nto their own: all the years which have passed before them belong\nto them. Unless we are the most ungrateful creatures in the world,\nwe shall regard these noblest of men, the founders of divine schools\nof thought, as having been born for us, and having prepared life\nfor us: we are led by the labour of others to behold most beautiful\nthings which have been brought out of darkness into light; we are\nnot shut out from any period, we can make our way into every subject,\n{310} and, if only we can summon up sufficient strength of mind to\noverstep the narrow limit of human weakness, we have a vast extent\nof time wherein to disport ourselves: we may argue with Socrates,\ndoubt with Carneades, repose with Epicurus, overcome human nature\nwith the Stoics, out-herod it with the Cynics. Since Nature allows\nus to commune with every age, why do we not abstract ourselves from\nour own petty fleeting span of time, and give ourselves up with our\nwhole mind to what is vast, what is eternal, what we share with\nbetter men than ourselves? Those who gad about in a round of calls,\nwho worry themselves and others, after they have indulged their\nmadness to the full, and crossed every patron\u2019s threshold daily,\nleaving no open door unentered, after they have hawked about their\ninterested greetings in houses of the most various character,\u2014after\nall, how few people are they able to see out of so vast a city,\ndivided among so many different ruling passions: how many will be\nmoved by sloth, self-indulgence, or rudeness to deny them admittance:\nhow many, after they have long plagued them, will run past them\nwith feigned hurry? how many will avoid coming out through their\nentrance-hall with its crowds of clients, and will escape by some\nconcealed backdoor? as though it were not ruder to deceive their\nvisitor than to deny him admittance!\u2014how many, half asleep and\nstupid with yesterday\u2019s debauch, can hardly be brought to return\nthe greeting of the wretched man who has broken his own rest in\norder to wait on that of another, even after his name has been\nwhispered to them for the thousandth time, save by a most offensive\nyawn of his half-opened lips. We may truly say that those men are\npursuing the true path of duty, who wish every day to consort on\nthe most familiar terms with Zeno, Pythagoras, Democritus, and the\nrest of those high priests of virtue, with Aristotle and with\nTheophrastus. None of these men will be \u201cengaged,\u201d {311} none of\nthese will fail to send you away after visiting him in a happier\nframe of mind and on better terms with yourself, none of them will\nlet you leave him empty-handed: yet their society may be enjoyed\nby all men, and by night as well as by day.\nXV. None of these men will force you to die, but all of them will\nteach you how to die: none of these will waste your time, but will\nadd his own to it. The talk of these men is not dangerous, their\nfriendship will not lead you to the scaffold, their society will\nnot ruin you in expenses: you may take from them whatsoever you\nwill; they will not prevent your taking the deepest draughts of\ntheir wisdom that you please. What blessedness, what a fair old age\nawaits the man who takes these for his patrons! he will have friends\nwith whom he may discuss all matters, great and small, whose advice\nhe may ask daily about himself, from whom he will hear truth without\ninsult, praise without flattery, and according to whose likeness\nhe may model his own character. We are wont to say that we are not\nable to choose who our parents should be, but that they were assigned\nto us by chance; yet we may be born just as we please: there are\nseveral families of the noblest intellects: choose which you would\nlike to belong to: by your adoption you will not receive their name\nonly, but also their property, which is not intended to be guarded\nin a mean and miserly spirit: the more persons you divide it among\nthe larger it becomes. These will open to you the path which leads\nto eternity, and will raise you to a height from whence none shall\ncast you down. By this means alone can you prolong your mortal life,\nnay, even turn it into an immortal one. High office, monuments, all\nthat ambition records in decrees or piles up in stone, soon passes\naway: lapse of time casts down and ruins everything; but those\nthings on which Philosophy has set its seal are beyond the reach\nof injury: no age will discard them or {312} lessen their force,\neach succeeding century will add somewhat to the respect in which\nthey are held: for we look upon what is near us with jealous eyes,\nbut we admire what is further off with less prejudice. The wise\nman\u2019s life, therefore, includes much: he is not hedged in by the\nsame limits which confine others: he alone is exempt from the laws\nby which mankind is governed: all ages serve him like a god. If any\ntime be past, he recals it by his memory; if it be present, he uses\nit; if it be future, he anticipates it: his life is a long one\nbecause he concentrates all times into it.\nXVI. Those men lead the shortest and unhappiest lives who forget\nthe past, neglect the present, and dread the future: when they reach\nthe end of it the poor wretches learn too late that they were busied\nall the while that they were doing nothing. You need not think,\nbecause sometimes they call for death, that their lives are long:\ntheir folly torments them with vague passions which lead them into\nthe very things of which they are afraid: they often, therefore,\nwish for death because they live in fear. Neither is it, as you\nmight think, a proof of the length of their lives that they often\nfind the days long, that they often complain how slowly the hours\npass until the appointed time arrives for dinner: for whenever they\nare left without their usual business, they fret helplessly in their\nidleness, and know not how to arrange or to spin it out. They betake\nthemselves, therefore, to some business, and all the intervening\ntime is irksome to them; they would wish, by Hercules, to skip over\nit, just as they wish to skip over the intervening days before a\ngladiatorial contest or some other time appointed for a public\nspectacle or private indulgence: all postponement of what they wish\nfor is grievous to them. Yet the very time which they enjoy is brief\nand soon past, and is made much briefer by their own fault: for\nthey run from one pleasure to another, and are not able to devote\n{313} themselves consistently to one passion: their days are not\nlong, but odious to them: on the other hand, how short they find\nthe nights which they spend with courtezans or over wine? Hence\narises that folly of the poets who encourage the errors of mankind\nby their myths, and declare that Jupiter to gratify his voluptuous\ndesires doubled the length of the night. Is it not adding fuel to\nour vices to name the gods as their authors, and to offer our\ndistempers free scope by giving them deity for an example? How can\nthe nights for which men pay so dear fail to appear of the shortest?\nthey lose the day in looking forward to the night, and lose the\nnight through fear of the dawn.\nXVII. Such men\u2019s very pleasures are restless and disturbed by various\nalarms, and at the most joyous moment of all there rises the anxious\nthought: \u201cHow long will this last?\u201d This frame of mind has led kings\nto weep over their power, and they have not been so much delighted\nat the grandeur of their position, as they have been terrified by\nthe end to which it must some day come. That most arrogant Persian\nking,[8] when his army stretched over vast plains and could not be\ncounted but only measured, burst into tears at the thought that in\nless than a hundred years none of all those warriors would be alive:\nyet their death was brought upon them by the very man who wept over\nit, who was about to destroy some of them by sea, some on land,\nsome in battle, and some in flight, and who would in a very short\nspace of time put an end to those about whose hundredth year he\nshowed such solicitude. Why need we wonder at their very joys being\nmixed with fear? they do not rest upon any solid grounds, but are\ndisturbed by the same emptiness from which they spring. What must\nwe suppose to be the misery of such times as even they acknowledge\nto be wretched, when even the joys by which they elevate themselves\nand raise themselves above their fellows are of {314} a mixed\ncharacter. All the greatest blessings are enjoyed with fear, and\nno thing is so untrustworthy as extreme prosperity: we require fresh\nstrokes of good fortune to enable us to keep that which we are\nenjoying, and even those of our prayers which are answered require\nfresh prayers. Everything for which we are dependent on chance is\nuncertain: the higher it rises, the more opportunities it has of\nfalling. Moreover, no one takes any pleasure in what is about to\nfall into ruin: very wretched, therefore, as well as very short\nmust be the lives of those who work very hard to gain what they\nmust work even harder to keep: they obtain what they wish with\ninfinite labour, and they hold what they have obtained with fear\nand trembling. Meanwhile they take no account of time, of which\nthey will never have a fresh and larger supply: they substitute new\noccupations for old ones, one hope leads to another, one ambition\nto another: they do not seek for an end to their wretchedness, but\nthey change its subject. Do our own preferments trouble us? nay,\nthose of other men occupy more of our time. Have we ceased from our\nlabours in canvassing? then we begin others in voting. Have we got\nrid of the trouble of accusation? then we begin that of judging.\nHas a man ceased to be a judge? then he becomes an examiner. Has\nhe grown old in the salaried management of other people\u2019s property?\nthen he becomes occupied with his own. Marius is discharged from\nmilitary service; he becomes consul many times: Quintius is eager\nto reach the end of his dictatorship; he will be called a second\ntime from the plough: Scipio marched against the Carthaginians\nbefore he was of years sufficient for so great an undertaking; after\nhe has conquered Hannibal, conquered Antiochus, been the glory of\nhis own consulship and the surety for that of his brother, he might,\nhad he wished it, have been set on the same pedestal with Jupiter;\nbut civil factions will vex the saviour of the state, and he who\nwhen {315} a young man disdained to receive divine honours, will\ntake pride as an old man in obstinately remaining in exile. We shall\nnever lack causes of anxiety, either pleasurable or painful: our\nlife will be pushed along from one business to another: leisure\nwill always be wished for, and never enjoyed.\nXVIII. Whefore, my dearest Paulinus, tear yourself away from the\ncommon herd, and since you have seen more rough weather than one\nwould think from your age, betake yourself at length to a more\npeaceful haven: reflect what waves you have sailed through, what\nstorms you have endured in private life, and brought upon yourself\nin public. Your courage has been sufficiently displayed by many\ntoilsome and wearisome proofs; try how it will deal with leisure:\nthe greater, certainly the better part of your life, has been given\nto your country; take now some part of your time for yourself as\nwell. I do not urge you to practise a dull or lazy sloth, or to\ndrown all your fiery spirit in the pleasures which are dear to the\nherd: that is not rest: you can find greater works than all those\nwhich you have hitherto so manfully carried out, upon which you may\nemploy yourself in retirement and security. You manage the revenues\nof the entire world, as unselfishly as though they belonged to\nanother, as laboriously as if they were your own, as scrupulously\nas though they belonged to the public: you win love in an office\nin which it is hard to avoid incurring hatred; yet, believe me, it\nis better to understand your own mind than to understand the\ncorn-market. Take away that keen intellect of yours, so well capable\nof grappling with the greatest subjects, from a post which may be\ndignified, but which is hardly fitted to render life happy, and\nreflect that you did not study from childhood all the branches of\na liberal education merely in order that many thousand tons of corn\nmight safely be entrusted to your charge: you have {316} given us\npromise of something greater and nobler than this. There will never\nbe any want of strict economists or of laborious workers: slow-going\nbeasts of burden are better suited for carrying loads than well-bred\nhorses, whose generous swiftness no one would encumber with a heavy\npack. Think, moreover, how full of risk is the great task which you\nhave undertaken: you have to deal with the human stomach: a hungry\npeople will not endure reason, will not be appeased by justice, and\nwill not hearken to any prayers. Only just a few days ago, when G.\nCaesar perished, grieving for nothing so much (if those in the other\nworld can feel grief) as that the Roman people did not die with\nhim, there was said to be only enough corn for seven or eight days\u2019\nconsumption: while he was making bridges with ships[9] and playing\nwith the resources of the empire, want of provisions, the worst\nevil that can befall even a besieged city, was at hand: his imitation\nof a crazy outlandish and misproud king very nearly ended in ruin,\nfamine, and the general revolution which follows famine. What must\nthen have been the feelings of those who had the charge of supplying\nthe city with corn, who were in danger of stoning, of fire and\nsword, of Gaius himself? With consummate art they concealed the\nvast internal evil by which the state was menaced, and were quite\nright in so doing; for some diseases must be cured without the\npatient\u2019s knowledge: many have died through discovering what was\nthe matter with them.\nXIX. Betake yourself to these quieter, safer, larger fields of\naction: do you think that there can be any comparison between seeing\nthat corn is deposited in the public {317} granary without being\nstolen by the fraud or spoilt by the carelessness of the importer,\nthat it does not suffer from damp or overheating, and that it\nmeasures and weighs as much as it ought, and beginning the study\nof sacred and divine knowledge, which will teach you of what elements\nthe gods are formed, what are their pleasures, their position, their\nform? to what changes your soul has to look forward? where Nature\nwill place us when we are dismissed from our bodies? what that\nprinciple is which holds all the heaviest particles of our universe\nin the middle, suspends the lighter ones above, puts fire highest\nof all, and causes the stars to rise in their courses, with many\nother matters, full of marvels? Will you not[10] cease to grovel\non earth and turn your mind\u2019s eye on these themes? nay, while your\nblood still flows swiftly, before your knees grow feeble, you ought\nto take the better path. In this course of life there await you\nmany good things, such as love and practice of the virtues,\nforgetfulness of passions, knowledge of how to live and die, deep\nrepose. The position of all busy men is unhappy, but most unhappy\nof all is that of those who do not even labour at their own affairs,\nbut have to regulate their rest by another man\u2019s sleep, their walk\nby another man\u2019s pace, and whose very love and hate, the freest\nthings in the world, are at another\u2019s bidding. If such men wish to\nknow how short their lives are, let them think how small a fraction\nof them is their own.\nXX. When, therefore, you see a man often wear the purple robes of\noffice, and hear his name often repeated in the forum, do not envy\nhim: he gains these things by losing so much of his life. Men throw\naway all their years in order to have one year named after them as\nconsul: some lose their lives during the early part of the struggle,\nand never reach the height to which they aspired: {318} some after\nhaving submitted to a thousand indignities in order to reach the\ncrowning dignity, have the miserable reflexion that the only result\nof their labours will be the inscription on their tombstone. Some,\nwhile telling off extreme old age, like youth, for new aspirations,\nhave found it fail from sheer weakness amid great and presumptuous\nenterprises. It is a shameful ending, when a man\u2019s breath deserts\nhim in a court of justice, while, although well stricken in years,\nhe is still striving to gain the sympathies of an ignorant audience\nfor some obscure litigant: it is base to perish in the midst of\none\u2019s business, wearied with living sooner than with working;\nshameful, too, to die in the act of receiving payments, amid the\nlaughter of one\u2019s long-expectant heir. I cannot pass over an an\ninstance which occurs to me: Turannius was an old man of the most\npainstaking exactitude, who after entering upon his ninetieth year,\nwhen he had by G. Caesar\u2019s own act been relieved of his duties as\ncollector of the revenue, ordered himself to be laid out on his bed\nand mourned for as though he were dead. The whole house mourned for\nthe leisure of its old master, and did not lay aside its mourning\nuntil his work was restored to him. Can men find such pleasure in\ndying in harness? Yet many are of the same mind: they retain their\nwish for labour longer than their capacity for it, and fight against\ntheir bodily weakness; they think old age an evil for no other\nreason than because it lays them on the shelf. The law does not\nenrol a soldier after his fiftieth year, or require a senator\u2019s\nattendance after his sixtieth: but men have more difficulty in\nobtaining their own consent than that of the law to a life of\nleisure. Meanwhile, while they are plundering and being plundered,\nwhile one is disturbing another\u2019s repose, and all are being made\nwretched alike, life remains without profit, without pleasure,\nwithout any intellectual progress: no one keeps death well before\nhis eyes, no one refrains from far-reaching {319} hopes. Some even\narrange things which lie beyond their own lives, such as huge\nsepulchral buildings, the dedication of public works, and exhibitions\nto be given at their funeral-pyre, and ostentatious processions:\nbut, by Hercules, the funerals of such men ought to be conducted\nby the light of torches and wax tapers,[11] as though they had lived\nbut a few days.\n[1] \u201cOn croit que ce Paulin \u00e9toit fr\u00e8re de Pauline, \u00e9pouse de\nS\u00e9n\u00e9que.\u201d \u2014La Grange.\n[2] \u201cL\u2019un se consume en projets d\u2019ambition, dont le succ\u00e8s depend\ndu suffrage de l\u2019autrui.\u201d\u2014La Grange.\n[3] \u201cCombien d\u2019orateurs qui s\u2019\u00e9puisent de sang et de forces pour\nfaire montrer de leur g\u00e9nie!\u201d\u2014La Grange.\n[4] \u201cPour vous, jamais vous ne daign\u00e2tes vous regarder seulement,\nou vous entendre.

My best of mothers, I have often felt eager to console you, and\nhave as often checked that impulse. Many things urged me to make\nthe attempt: in the first place, I thought that if, though I might\nnot be able to restrain your tears, yet that if I could even wipe\nthem away, I should set myself free from all my own sorrows: then\nI was quite sure that I should rouse you from your grief with more\nauthority if I had first shaken it off myself. I feared, too, lest\nFortune, though overcome by me, might nevertheless overcome some\none of my family. Then I endeavoured to crawl and bind up your\nwounds in the best way I could, holding my hand over my own wound;\nbut then again other considerations occurred to me which held me\nback: I knew that I must not oppose your grief during its first\ntransports, lest my very attempts at consolation might irritate it,\nand add fuel to it: for in diseases, also, there is nothing more\nhurtful than medicine applied too soon. I waited, therefore, until\nit exhausted itself by its own violence, and being weakened by time,\nso that it was able to bear remedies, would allow itself to be\nhandled and {321} touched. Beside this, while turning over all the\nworks which the greatest geniuses have composed, for the purpose\nof soothing and pacifying grief, I could not find any instance of\none who had offered consolation to his relatives, while he himself\nwas being sorrowed over by them. Thus, the subject being a new one,\nI hesitated and feared that instead of consoling, I might embitter\nyour grief. Then there was the thought that a man who had only just\nraised his head after burying his child, and who wished to console\nhis friends, would require to use new phrases not taken from our\ncommon every-day words of comfort: but every sorrow of more than\nusual magnitude must needs prevent one\u2019s choosing one\u2019s words,\nseeing that it often prevents one\u2019s using one\u2019s very voice. However\nthis may be, I will make the attempt, not trusting in my own genius,\nbut because my consolation will be most powerful since it is I who\noffer it. You never would deny me anything, and I hope, though all\ngrief is obstinate, that you will surely not refuse me this request,\nthat you will allow me to set bounds to your sorrow.\nII. See how far I have presumed upon your indulgence: I have no\ndoubts about my having more power over you than your grief, than\nwhich nothing has more power over the unhappy. In order, therefore,\nto avoid encountering it straightway, I will at first take its part\nand offer it every encouragement: I will rip up and bring to light\nagain wounds already scarred. Some one may say, \u201cWhat sort of\nconsolation is this, for a man to rake up buried evils, and to bring\nall its sorrows before a mind which scarcely can bear the sight of\none?\u201d but let him reflect that diseases which are so malignant that\nthey do but gather strength from ordinary remedies, may often be\ncured by the opposite treatment: I will, therefore, display before\nyour grief all its woes and miseries: this will be to effect a cure,\nnot by soothing measures, but by cautery and {322} the knife. What\nshall I gain by this? I shall make the mind that could overcome so\nmany sorrows, ashamed to bewail one wound more in a body so full\nof scars. Let those whose feeble minds have been enervated by a\nlong period of happiness, weep and lament for many days, and faint\naway on receiving the slightest blow: but those whose years have\nall been passed amid catastrophes should bear the severest losses\nwith brave and unyielding patience. Continual misfortune has this\none advantage, that it ends by rendering callous those whom it is\nalways scourging. Ill fortune has given you no respite, and has not\nleft even your birthday free from the bitterest grief: you lost\nyour mother as soon as you were born, nay, while you were being\nborn, and you came into life, as it were, an outcast: you grew up\nunder a step-mother, whom you made into a mother by all the obedience\nand respect which even a real daughter could have bestowed upon\nher: and even a good step-mother costs every one dear. You lost\nyour most affectionate uncle, a brave and excellent man, just when\nyou were awaiting his return: and, lest Fortune should weaken its\nblows by dividing them, within a month you lost your beloved husband,\nby whom you had become the mother of three children. This sorrowful\nnews was brought you while you were already in mourning, while all\nyour children were absent, so that all your misfortunes seemed to\nhave been purposely brought upon you at a time when your grief could\nnowhere find any repose. I pass over all the dangers and alarms\nwhich you have endured without any respite: it was but the other\nday that you received the bones of three of your grandchildren in\nthe bosom from which you had sent them forth: less than twenty days\nafter you had buried my child, who perished in your arms and amid\nyour kisses, you heard that I had been exiled: you wanted only this\ndrop in your cup, to have to weep for those who still lived.\n{323}\nIII. The last wound is, I admit, the severest that you have ever\nyet sustained: it has not merely torn the skin, but has pierced you\nto the very heart: yet as recruits cry aloud when only slightly\nwounded, and shudder more at the hands of the surgeon than at the\nsword, while veterans even when transfixed allow their hurts to be\ndressed without a groan, and as patiently as if they were in some\none else\u2019s body, so now you ought to offer yourself courageously\nto be healed. Lay aside lamentations and wailings, and all the usual\nnoisy manifestations of female sorrow: you have gained nothing by\nso many misfortunes, if you have not learned how to suffer. Now,\ndo I seem not to have spared you? nay, I have not passed over any\nof your sorrows, but have placed them all together in a mass before\nyou.\nIV. I have done this by way of a heroic remedy: for I have determined\nto conquer this grief of yours, not merely to limit it; and I shall\nconquer it, I believe, if in the first place I can prove that I am\nnot suffering enough to entitle me to be called unhappy, let alone\nto justify me in rendering my family unhappy: and, secondly, if I\ncan deal with your case and prove that even your misfortune, which\ncomes upon you entirely through me, is not a severe one.\nThe point to which I shall first address myself is that of which\nyour motherly love longs to hear, I mean, that I am not suffering:\nif I can, I will make it clear to you that the events by which you\nthink that I am overwhelmed, are not unendurable: if you cannot\nbelieve this, I at any rate shall be all the more pleased with\nmyself for being happy under circumstances which could make most\nmen miserable. You need not believe what others say about me: that\nyou may not be puzzled by any uncertainty as to what to think, I\ndistinctly tell you that I am not miserable: I will add, for your\ngreater comfort, that it is not possible for me to be made miserable.\nV. We are born to a comfortable position enough, if we {324} do not\nafterwards lose it: the aim of Nature has been to enable us to live\nwell without needing a vast apparatus to enable us to do so: every\nman is able by himself to make himself happy. External circumstances\nhave very little importance either for good or for evil: the wise\nman is neither elated by prosperity nor depressed by adversity; for\nhe has always endeavoured to depend chiefly upon himself and to\nderive all his joys from himself. Do I, then, call myself a wise\nman? far from it: for were I able to profess myself wise, I should\nnot only say that I was not unhappy, but should avow myself to be\nthe most fortunate of men, and to be raised almost to the level of\na god: as it is, I have applied myself to the society of wise men,\nwhich suffices to lighten all sorrows, and, not being as yet able\nto rely upon my own strength, I have betaken myself for refuge to\nthe camp of others, of those, namely, who can easily defend both\nthemselves and their friends. They have ordered me always to stand\nas it were on guard, and to mark the attacks and charges of Fortune\nlong before she delivers them; she is only terrible to those whom\nshe catches unawares; he who is always looking out for her assault,\neasily sustains it: for so also an invasion of the enemy overthrows\nthose by whom it is unexpected, but those who have prepared themselves\nfor the coming war before it broke out, stand in their ranks fully\nequipped and repel with ease the first, which is always the most\nfurious onset. I never have trusted in Fortune, even when she seemed\nmost peaceful. I have accepted all the gifts of wealth, high office,\nand influence, which she has so bountifully bestowed upon me, in\nsuch a manner that she can take them back again without disturbing\nme: I have kept a great distance between them and myself: and\ntherefore she has taken them, not painfully torn them away from me.\nNo man loses anything by the frowns of Fortune unless he has been\ndeceived by her smiles: those who have {325} enjoyed her bounty as\nthough it were their own heritage for ever, and who have chosen to\ntake precedence of others because of it, lie in abject sorrow when\nher unreal and fleeting delights forsake their empty childish minds,\nthat know nothing about solid pleasure: but he who has not been\npuffed up by success, does not collapse after failure: he possesses\na mind of tried constancy, superior to the influences of either\nstate; for even in the midst of prosperity he has experimented upon\nhis powers of enduring adversity. Consequently I have always believed\nthat there was no real good in any of those things which all men\ndesire: I then found that they were empty, and merely painted over\nwith artificial and deceitful dyes, without containing anything\nwithin which corresponds to their outside: I now find nothing so\nharsh and fearful as the common opinion of mankind threatened me\nwith in this which is known as adversity: the word itself, owing\nto the prevalent belief and ideas current about it, strikes somewhat\nunpleasantly upon one\u2019s ears, and thrills the hearers as something\ndismal and accursed, for so hath the vulgar decreed that it should\nbe: but a great many of the decrees of the vulgar are reversed by\nthe wise.\nVI. Setting aside, then, the verdict of the majority, who are carried\naway by the first appearance of things and the usual opinion about\nthem, let us consider what is meant by exile: clearly a changing\nfrom one place to another. That I may not seem to be narrowing its\nforce, and taking away its worst parts, I must add, that this\nchanging of place is accompanied by poverty, disgrace, and contempt.\nAgainst these I will combat later on: meanwhile I wish to consider\nwhat there is unpleasant in the mere act of changing one\u2019s place\nof abode.\n\u201dIt is unbearable,\u201d men say, \u201cto lose one\u2019s native land.\u201d Look, I\npray you, on these vast crowds, for whom all the countless roofs\nof Rome can scarcely find shelter: the {326} greater part of those\ncrowds have lost their native land: they have flocked hither from\ntheir country towns and colonies, and in fine from all parts of the\nworld. Some have been brought by ambition, some by the exigencies\nof public office, some by being entrusted with embassies, some by\nluxury which seeks a convenient spot, rich in vices, for its exercise,\nsome by their wish for a liberal education, others by a wish to see\nthe public shows. Some have been led hither by friendship, some by\nindustry, which finds here a wide field for the display of its\npowers. Some have brought their beauty for sale, some their eloquence:\npeople of every kind assemble themselves together in Rome, which\nsets a high price both upon virtues and vices. Bid them all to be\nsummoned to answer to their names, and ask each one from what home\nhe has come: you will find that the greater part of them have left\ntheir own abodes, and journeyed to a city which, though great and\nbeauteous beyond all others, is nevertheless not their own. Then\nleave this city, which may be said to be the common property of all\nmen, and visit all other towns: there is not one of them which does\nnot contain a large proportion of aliens. Pass away from those whose\ndelightful situation and convenient position attracts many settlers:\nexamine wildernesses and the most rugged islands, Sciathus and\nSeriphus, Gyarus and Corsica: you will find no place of exile where\nsome one does not dwell for his own pleasure. What can be found\nbarer or more precipitous on every side than this rock? what more\nbarren in respect of food? what more uncouth in its inhabitants?\nmore mountainous in its configuration? or more rigorous in its\nclimate? yet even here there are more strangers than natives. So\nfar, therefore, is the mere change of place from being irksome,\nthat even this place has allured some away from their country. I\nfind some writers who declare that mankind has a natural itch for\nchange of abode and alteration of {327} domicile: for the mind of\nman is wandering and unquiet; it never stands still, but spreads\nitself abroad and sends forth its thoughts into all regions, known\nor unknown; being nomadic, impatient of repose, and loving novelty\nbeyond everything else. You need not be suprised at this, if you\nreflect upon its original source: it is not formed from the same\nelements as the heavy and earthly body, but from heavenly spirit:\nnow heavenly things are by their nature always in motion, speeding\nalong and flying with the greatest swiftness. Look at the luminaries\nwhich light the world: none of them stands still. The sun is\nperpetually in motion, and passes from one quarter to another, and\nalthough he revolves with the entire heaven, yet nevertheless he\nhas a motion in the contrary direction to that of the universe\nitself, and passes through all the constellations without remaining\nin any: his wandering is incessant, and he never ceases to move\nfrom place to place. All things continually revolve and are for\never changing; they pass from one position to another in accordance\nwith natural and unalterable laws: after they have completed a\ncertain circuit in a fixed space of time, they begin again the path\nwhich they had previously trodden. Be not surprised, then, if the\nhuman mind, which is formed from the same seeds as the heavenly\nbodies, delights in change and wandering, since the divine nature\nitself either takes pleasure in constant and exceeding swift motion\nor perhaps even preserves its existence thereby.\nVII. Come now, turn from divine to human affairs: you will see that\nwhole tribes and nations have changed their abodes. What is the\nmeaning of Greek cities in the midst of barbarous districts? or of\nthe Macedonian language existing among the Indians and the Persians?\nScythia and all that region which swarms with wild and uncivilized\ntribes boasts nevertheless Achaean cities along the shores of the\nBlack Sea. Neither the rigours of eternal winter, {328} nor the\ncharacter of men as savage as their climate, has prevented people\nmigrating thither. There is a mass of Athenians in Asia Minor.\nMiletus has sent out into various parts of the world citizens enough\nto populate seventy-five cities. That whole coast of Italy which\nis washed by the Lower Sea is a part of what once was \u201cGreater\nGreece.\u201d Asia claims the Tuscans as her own: there are Tyrians\nliving in Africa, Carthaginians in Spain; Greeks have pushed in\namong the Gauls, and Gauls among the Greeks. The Pyrenees have\nproved no barrier to the Germans: human caprice makes its way through\npathless and unknown regions: men drag along with them their children,\ntheir wives, and their aged and worn-out parents. Some have been\ntossed hither and thither by long wanderings, until they have become\ntoo wearied to choose an abode, but have settled in whatever place\nwas nearest to them: others have made themselves masters of foreign\ncountries by force of arms: some nations while making for parts\nunknown have been swallowed up by the sea: some have established\nthemselves in the place in which they were originally stranded by\nutter destitution. Nor have all men had the same reasons for leaving\ntheir country and for seeking for a new one: some have escaped from\ntheir cities when destroyed by hostile armies, and having lost their\nown lands have been thrust upon those of others: some have been\ncast out by domestic quarrels: some have been driven forth in\nconsequence of an excess of population, in order to relieve the\npressure at home: some have been forced to leave by pestilence, or\nfrequent earthquakes, or some unbearable defects of a barren soil:\nsome have been seduced by the fame of a fertile and over-praised\nclime. Different people have been led away from their homes by\ndifferent causes; but in all cases it is clear that nothing remains\nin the same place in which it was born: the movement of the human\nrace is perpetual: in this vast world some changes {329} take place\ndaily. The foundations of new cities are laid, new names of nations\narise, while the former ones die out, or become absorbed by more\npowerful ones. And yet what else are all these general migrations\nbut the banishments of whole peoples? Why should I lead you through\nall these details? what is the use of mentioning Antenor the founder\nof Padua, or Evander who established his kingdom of Arcadian settlers\non the banks of the Tiber? or Diomedes and the other heroes, both\nvictors and vanquished, whom the Trojan war scattered over lands\nwhich were not their own? It is a fact that the Roman Empire itself\ntraces its origin back to an exile as its founder, who, fleeing\nfrom his country after its conquest, with what few relics he had\nsaved from the wreck, had been brought to Italy by hard necessity\nand fear of his conqueror, which bade him seek distant lands. Since\nthen, how many colonies has this people sent forth into every\nprovince? wherever the Roman conquers, there he dwells. These\nmigrations always found people eager to take part in them, and\nveteran soldiers desert their native hearths and follow the flag\nof the colonists across the sea. The matter does not need illustrations\nby any more examples: yet I will add one more which I have before\nmy eyes: this very island[1] has often changed its inhabitants. Not\nto mention more ancient events, which have become obscure from their\nantiquity, the Greeks who inhabit Marseilles at the present day,\nwhen they left Phocaea, first settled here, and it is doubtful what\ndrove them hence, whether it was the rigour of the climate, the\nsight of the more powerful land of Italy, or the want of harbours\non the coast: for the fact of their having placed themselves in the\nmidst of what were then the most savage and uncouth tribes of Gaul\nproves that they were not driven hence by the ferocity of the\nnatives. Subsequently {330} the Ligurians came over into this same\nisland, and also the Spaniards,[2] which is proved by the resemblance\nof their customs: for they wear the same head-coverings and the\nsame sort of shoes as the Cantabrians, and some of their words are\nthe same: for by association with Greeks and Ligurians they have\nentirely lost their native speech. Hither since then have been\nbrought two Roman colonies, one by Marius, the other by Sulla: so\noften has the population of this barren and thorny rock been changed.\nIn fine, you will scarcely find any land which is still in the hands\nof its original inhabitants: all peoples have become confused and\nintermingled: one has come after another: one has wished for what\nanother scorned: some have been driven out of the land which they\ntook from another. Thus fate has decreed that nothing should ever\nenjoy an uninterrupted course of good fortune.\nVIII. Varro, that most learned of all the Romans, thought that for\nthe mere change of place, apart from the other evils attendant on\nexile, we may find a sufficient remedy in the thought that wherever\nwe go we always have the same Nature to deal with. Marcus Brutus\nthought that there was sufficient comfort in the thought that those\nwho go into exile are permitted to carry their virtues thither with\nthem. Though one might think that neither of these alone were able\nto console an exile, yet it must be confessed that when combined\nthey have great power: for how very little it is that we lose!\nwhithersoever we betake ourselves two most excellent things will\naccompany us, namely, a common Nature and our own especial virtue.\nBelieve me, this is the work of whoever was the Creator of the\nuniverse, whether he be an all-powerful deity, an incorporeal mind\nwhich effects vast works, a divine spirit by which all things from\nthe greatest to the smallest are equally pervaded, or {331} fate\nand an unalterable connected sequence of events, this, I say, is\nits work, that nothing above the very lowest can ever fall into the\npower of another: all that is best for a man\u2019s enjoyment lies beyond\nhuman power, and can neither be bestowed or taken away: this world,\nthe greatest and the most beautiful of Nature\u2019s productions, and\nits noblest part, a mind which can behold and admire it, are our\nown property, and will remain with us as long as we ourselves endure.\nLet us therefore briskly and cheerfully hasten with undaunted steps\nwhithersoever circumstances call us: let us wander over whatever\ncountries we please; no place of banishment can be found in the\nwhole world in which man cannot find a home. I can raise my eyes\nfrom the earth to the sky in one place as well as in another; the\nheavenly bodies are everywhere equally near to mankind: accordingly,\nas long as my eyes are not deprived of that spectacle of which they\nnever can have their fill, as long as I am allowed to gaze on the\nsun and moon, to dwell upon the other stars, to speculate upon their\nrisings and settings, their periods, and the reasons why they move\nfaster or slower, to see so many stars glittering throughout the\nnight, some fixed, some not moving in a wide orbit but revolving\nin their own proper track, some suddenly diverging from it, some\ndazzling our eyes by a fiery blaze as though they were falling, or\nflying along drawing after them a long trail of brilliant light:\nwhile I am permitted to commune with these, and to hold intercourse,\nas far as a human being may, with all the company of heaven, while\nI can raise my spirit aloft to view its kindred sparks above, what\ndoes it matter upon what soil I tread?\nIX. \u201cBut this country does not produce beautiful or fruit-bearing\ntrees; it is not watered by the courses of large or navigable rivers;\nit bears nothing which other nations would covet, since its produce\nbarely suffices to support its inhabitants: no precious marbles are\nquarried here, no veins {332} of gold and silver are dug out.\u201d What\nof that! It must be a narrow mind that takes pleasure in things of\nthe earth: it ought to be turned away from them to the contemplation\nof those which can be seen everywhere, which are equally brilliant\neverywhere: we ought to reflect, also, that these vulgar matters\nby a mistaken perversion of ideas prevent really good things reaching\nus: the further men stretch out their porticos, the higher they\nraise their towers, the more widely they extend their streets, the\ndeeper they sink their retreats from the heats of summer, the more\nponderous the roofs with which they cover their banqueting halls,\nthe more there will be to obstruct their view of heaven. Fortune\nhas cast you into a country in which there is no lodging more\nsplendid than a cottage: you must indeed have a poor spirit, and\none which seeks low sources of consolation, if you endure this\nbravely because you have seen the cottage of Romulus: say, rather,\n\u201cShould that lowly barn be entered by the virtues, it will straightway\nbecome more beautiful than any temple, because within it will be\nseen justice, self-restraint, prudence, love, a right division of\nall duties, a knowledge of all things on earth and in heaven. No\nplace can be narrow, if it contains such a company of the greatest\nvirtues; no exile can be irksome in which one can be attended by\nthese companions. Brutus, in the book which he wrote upon virtue,\nsays that he saw Marcellus in exile at Mytilene, living as happily\nas it is permitted to man to live, and never keener in his pursuit\nof literature than at that time. He consequently adds the reflexion:\n\u2018I seemed rather to be going into exile myself when I had to return\nwithout him, than to be leaving him in exile.\u2019 O how much more\nfortunate was Marcellus at that time, when Brutus praised him for\nhis exile, than when Rome praised him for his consulship! what a\nman that must have been who made any one think himself exiled because\nhe was leaving him in exile! what a man that {333} must have been\nwho attracted the admiration of one whom even his friend Cato\nadmired! Brutus goes on to say:\u2014 \u2018Gaius Caesar sailed past Mytilene\nwithout landing, because he could not bear to see a fallen man.\u2019\nThe Senate did indeed obtain his recall by public petition, being\nso anxious and sorrowful the while, that you would have thought\nthat they all were of Brutus\u2019s mind that day, and were not pleading\nthe cause of Marcellus, but their own, that they might not be sent\ninto exile by being deprived of him: yet he gained far greater glory\non the day when Brutus could not bear to leave him in exile, and\nCaesar could not bear to see him: for each of them bore witness to\nhis worth: Brutus grieved, and Caesar blushed at going home without\nMarcellus. Can you doubt that so great a man as Marcellus frequently\nencouraged himself to endure his exile patiently in some such terms\nas these: \u201cThe loss of your country is no misery to you: you have\nso steeped yourself in philosophic lore, as to know that all the\nworld is the wise man\u2019s country? What! was not this very man who\nbanished you absent from his country for ten successive years? he\nwas, no doubt, engaged in the extension of the empire, but for all\nthat he was absent from his country. Now see how his presence is\nrequired in Africa, which threatens to re-kindle the war, in Spain\nwhich is nursing up again the strength of the broken and shattered\nopposite faction, in treacherous Egypt, in fine, in all the parts\nof the world, for all are watching their opportunity to seize the\nempire at a disadvantage. Which will he go to meet first? which\npart of the universal conspiracy will he first oppose? His victory\nwill drag him through every country in the world. Let nations look\nup to him and worship him: do thou live satisfied with the admiration\nof Brutus.\u201d\nX. Marcellus, then, nobly endured his exile, and his change of place\nmade no change in his mind, even though it was accompanied by\npoverty, in which every man who {334} has not fallen into the madness\nof avarice and luxury, which upset all our ideas, sees no harm.\nIndeed, how very little is required to keep a man alive? and who,\nthat has any virtue whatever, will find this fail him? As for myself,\nI do not feel that I have lost my wealth, but my occupation: the\nwants of the body are few: it wants protection from the cold, and\nthe means of allaying hunger and thirst: all desires beyond these\nare vices, not necessities. There is no need for prying into all\nthe depths of the sea, for loading one\u2019s stomach with heaps of\nslaughtered animals, or for tearing up shell-fish[3] from the unknown\nshore of the furthest sea: may the gods and goddesses bring ruin\nupon those whose luxury transcends the bounds of an empire which\nis already perilously wide. They want to have their ostentatious\nkitchens supplied with game from the other side of the Phasis, and\nthough Rome has not yet obtained satisfaction from the Parthians,\nthey are not ashamed to obtain birds from them: they bring together\nfrom all regions everything, known or unknown, to tempt their\nfastidious palate: food, which their stomach, worn out with delicacies,\ncan scarcely retain, is brought from the most distant ocean: they\nvomit that they may eat, and eat that they may vomit, and do not\neven deign to digest the banquets which they ransack the globe to\nobtain. If a man despises these things, what harm can poverty do\nhim? If he desires them, then poverty even does him good, for he\nis cured in spite of himself, and though he will not receive remedies\neven upon compulsion, yet while he is unable to fulfil his wishes\nhe is as though he had them not. Gaius Caesar, whom in my opinion\nNature produced in order to show what unlimited vice would be capable\nof when combined with unlimited power, dined one day at a cost of\nten millions of sesterces: and though in this he had the {335}\nassistance of the intelligence of all his subjects, yet he could\nhardly find how to make one dinner out of the tribute-money of three\nprovinces. How unhappy are they whose appetite can only be aroused\nby costly food! and the costliness of food depends not upon its\ndelightful flavour and sweetness of taste, but upon its rarity and\nthe difficulty of procuring it: otherwise, if they chose to return\nto their sound senses, what need would they have of so many arts\nwhich minister to the stomach? of so great a commerce? of such\nravaging of forests? of such ransacking of the depths of the sea?\nFood is to be found everywhere, and has been placed by Nature in\nevery part the world, but they pass it by as though they were blind,\nand wander through all countries, cross the seas, and excite at a\ngreat cost the hunger which they might allay at a small one. One\nwould like to say: Why do you launch ships? why do you arm your\nhands for battle both with men and wild beasts? why do you run so\nriotously hither and thither? why do you amass fortune after fortune?\nAre you unwilling to remember how small our bodies are? is it not\nfrenzy and the wildest insanity to wish for so much when you can\ncontain so little? Though you may increase your income, and extend\nthe boundaries of your property, yet you never can enlarge your own\nbodies: when your business transactions have turned out well, when\nyou have made a successful campaign, when you have collected the\nfood for which you have hunted through all lands, you will have no\nplace in which to bestow all these superfluities. Why do you strive\nto obtain so much? Do you think that our ancestors, whose virtue\nsupports our vices even to the present day, were unhappy, though\nthey dressed their food with their own hands, though the earth was\ntheir bed, though their roofs did not yet glitter with gold, nor\ntheir temples with precious stones? and so they used then to swear\nwith scrupulous honesty by earthenware {336} gods; those who called\nthese gods to witness would go back to the enemy for certain death\nrather than break their word.[4] Do you suppose that our dictator\nwho granted an audience to the ambassadors of the Samnites, while\nhe roasted the commonest food before the fire himself with that\nvery hand with which he had so often smitten the enemy, and with\nwhich he had placed his laurel wreath upon the lap of Capitolian\nJove, enjoyed life less than the Apicius who lived in our own days,\nwhose habits tainted the entire century, who set himself up as a\nprofessor of gastronomy in that very city from which philosophers\nonce were banished as corrupters of youth? It is worth while to\nknow his end. After he had spent a hundred millions of sesterces\non his kitchen, and had wasted on each single banquet a sum equal\nto so many presents from the reigning emperors, and the vast revenue\nwhich he drew from the Capitol, being overburdened with debt, he\nthen for the first time was forced to examine his accounts: he\ncalculated that he would have ten millions left of his fortune,\nand, as though he would live a life of mere starvation on ten\nmillions, put an end to his life by poison. How great must the\nluxury of that man have been, to whom ten millions signified want?\nCan you think after this that the amount of money necessary to make\na fortune depends upon its actual extent rather than on the mind\nof the owner? Here was a man who shuddered at the thought of a\nfortune of ten million sesterces, and escaped by poison from a\nprospect which other men pray for. Yet, for a mind so diseased,\nthat last draught of his was the most wholesome: he was really\neating and drinking poisons when he was not only enjoying, but\nboasting of his enormous banquets, when he was flaunting his vices,\nwhen he was causing his country to follow his example, when he was\ninviting youths to imitate him, albeit youth is quick {337} to learn\nevil, without being provided with a model to copy. This is what\nbefalls those who do not use their wealth according to reason, which\nhas fixed limits, but according to vicious fashion, whose caprices\nare boundless and immeasurable. Nothing is sufficient for covetous\ndesire, but Nature can be satisfied even with scant measure. The\npoverty of an exile, therefore, causes no inconvenience, for no\nplace of exile is so barren as not to produce what is abundantly\nsufficient to support a man.\nXI. Next, need an exile regret his former dress and house? If he\nonly wishes for these things because of their use to him, he will\nwant neither roof nor garment, for it takes as little to cover the\nbody as it does to feed it: Nature has annexed no difficult conditions\nto anything which man is obliged to do. If, however, he sighs for\na purple robe steeped in floods of dye, interwoven with threads of\ngold and with many coloured artistic embroideries, then his poverty\nis his own fault, not that of Fortune: even though you restored to\nhim all that he has lost, you would do him no good; for he would\nhave more unsatisfied ambitions, if restored, than he had unsatisfied\nwants when he was an exile. If he longs for furniture glittering\nwith silver vases, plate which boasts the signature of antique\nartists, bronze which the mania of a small clique has rendered\ncostly, slaves enough to crowd however large a house, purposely\noverfed horses, and precious stones of all countries: whatever\ncollections he may make of these, he never will satisfy his insatiable\nappetite, any more than any amount of liquor will quench a thirst\nwhich arises not from the need of drink but from the burning heat\nwithin a man; for this is not thirst but disease. Nor does this\ntake place only with regard to money and food, but every want which\nis caused by vice and not by necessity is of this nature: however\nmuch you supply it with you do not quench it but intensify it. He\nwho restrains himself within the limits prescribed by {338} nature,\nwill not feel poverty; he who exceeds them will always be poor,\nhowever great his wealth may be. Even a place of exile suffices to\nprovide one with necessaries; whole kingdoms do not suffice to\nprovide one with superfluities. It is the mind which makes men rich:\nthis it is that accompanies them into exile, and in the most savage\nwildernesses, after having found sufficient sustenance for the body,\nenjoys its own overflowing resources: the mind has no more connexion\nwith money than the immortal gods have with those things which are\nso highly valued by untutored intellects, sunk in the bondage of\nthe flesh. Gems, gold, silver, and vast polished round tables are\nbut earthly dross, which cannot be loved by a pure mind that is\nmindful of whence it came, is unblemished by sin, and which, when\nreleased from the body, will straightway soar aloft to the highest\nheaven: meanwhile, as far as it is permitted by the hindrances of\nits mortal limbs and this heavy clog of the body by which it is\nsurrounded, it examines divine things with swift and airy thought.\nFrom this it follows that no free-born man, who is akin to the gods,\nand fit for any world and any age, can ever be in exile: for his\nthoughts are directed to all the heavens and to all times past and\nfuture: this trumpery body, the prison and fetter of the spirit,\nmay be tossed to this place or to that; upon it tortures, robberies,\nand diseases may work their will: but the spirit itself is holy and\neternal, and upon it no one can lay hands.\nXII. That you may not suppose that I merely use the maxims of the\nphilosophers to disparage the evils of poverty, which no one finds\nterrible, unless he thinks it so; consider in the first place how\nmany more poor people there are than rich, and yet you will not\nfind that they are sadder or more anxious than the rich: nay, I am\nnot sure that they are not happier, because they have fewer things\nto distract their minds. From these poor men, who often are not\n{339} unhappy at their poverty, let us pass to the rich. How many\noccasions there are on which they are just like poor men! When they\nare on a journey their baggage is cut down, whenever they are obliged\nto travel fast their train of attendants is dismissed. When they\nare serving in the army, how small a part of their property can\nthey have with them, since camp discipline forbids superfluities!\nNor is it only temporary exigences or desert places that put them\non the same level as poor men: they have some days on which they\nbecome sick of their riches, dine reclining on the ground, put away\nall their gold and silver plate, and use earthenware. Madmen! they\nare always afraid of this for which they sometimes wish. O how dense\na stupidity, how great an ignorance of the truth they show when\nthey flee from this thing and yet amuse themselves by playing with\nit! Whenever I look back to the great examples of antiquity, I feel\nashamed to seek consolation for my poverty, now that luxury has\nadvanced so far in the present age, that the allowance of an exile\nis larger than the inheritance of the princes of old. It is well\nknown that Homer had one slave, that Plato had three, and that Zeno,\nwho first taught the stern and masculine doctrine of the Stoics,\nhad none: yet could any one say that they lived wretchedly without\nhimself being thought a most pitiable wretch by all men? Menenius\nAgrippa, by whose mediation the patricians and plebeians were\nreconciled, was buried by public subscription. Attilius Regulus,\nwhile he was engaged in scattering the Carthaginians in Africa,\nwrote to the Senate that his hired servant had left him, and that\nconsequently his farm was deserted: whereupon it was decreed that\nas long as Regulus was absent, it should be cultivated at the expense\nof the state. Was it not worth his while to have no slave, if thereby\nhe obtained the Roman people for his farm-bailiff? Scipio\u2019s daughters\nreceived their dowries from the Treasury, because {340} their father\nhad left them none: by Hercules, it was right for the Roman people\nto pay tribute to Scipio for once, since he had exacted it for ever\nfrom Carthage. O how happy were those girls\u2019 husbands, who had the\nRoman people for their father-in-law. Can you think that those whose\ndaughters dance in the ballet, and marry with a settlement of a\nmillion sesterces, are happier than Scipio, whose children received\ntheir dowry of old-fashioned brass money from their guardian the\nSenate? Can any one despise poverty, when she has such a noble\ndescent to boast of? can an exile be angry at any privation, when\nScipio could not afford a portion for his daughters, Regulus could\nnot afford a hired labourer, Menenius could not afford a funeral?\nwhen all these men\u2019s wants were supplied in a manner which rendered\nthem a source of additional honour? Poverty, when such men as these\nplead its cause, is not only harmless, but positively attractive.\nXIII. To this one may answer: \u201cWhy do you thus ingeniously divide\nwhat can indeed be endured if taken singly, but which all together\nare overwhelming? Change of place can be borne if nothing more than\none\u2019s place be changed: poverty can be borne if it be without\ndisgrace, which is enough to cow our spirits by itself.\u201d If any one\nwere to endeavour to frighten me with the number of my misfortunes,\nI should answer him as follows: If you have enough strength to\nresist any one part of your ill-fortune, you will have enough to\nresist it all. If virtue has once hardened your mind, it renders\nit impervious to blows from any quarter: if avarice, that greatest\npest of the human race, has left it, you will not be troubled by\nambition: if you regard the end of your days not as a punishment,\nbut as an ordinance of nature, no fear of anything else will dare\nto enter the breast which has cast out the fear of death. If you\nconsider sexual passion to have been bestowed on mankind not for\nthe sake of pleasure, but for {341} the continuance of the race,\nall other desires will pass harmlessly by one who is safe even from\nthis secret plague, implanted in our very bosoms. Reason does not\nconquers vices one by one, but all together: if reason is defeated,\nit is utterly defeated once for all. Do you suppose that any wise\nman, who relies entirely upon himself, who has set himself free\nfrom the ideas of the common herd, can be wrought upon by disgrace?\nA disgraceful death is worse even than disgrace: yet Socrates bore\nthe same expression of countenance with which he had rebuked thirty\ntyrants, when he entered the prison and thereby took away the\ninfamous character of the place; for the place which contained\nSocrates could not be regarded as a prison. Was any one ever so\nblind to the truth as to suppose that Marcus Cato was disgraced by\nhis double defeat in his candidature for the praetorship and the\nconsulship? that disgrace fell on the praetorship and consulship\nwhich Cato honoured by his candidature. No one is despised by others\nunless he be previously despised by himself: a grovelling and abject\nmind may fall an easy prey to such contempt: but he who stands up\nagainst the most cruel misfortunes, and overcomes those evils by\nwhich others would have been crushed\u2014such a man, I say, turns his\nmisfortunes into badges of honour, because we are so constituted\nas to admire nothing so much as a man who bears adversity bravely.\nAt Athens, when Aristides was being led to execution, every one who\nmet him cast down his eyes and groaned, as though not merely a just\nman but justice herself was being put to death. Yet one man was\nfound who spat in his face: he might have been disturbed at this,\nsince he knew it could only be a foul-mouthed fellow that would\nhave the heart to do so; he, however, wiped his face, and with a\nsmile asked the magistrate who accompanied him to warn that man not\nto open his mouth so rudely again. To act thus was to treat contumely\nitself {342} with contempt. I know that some say that there is\nnothing more terrible than disgrace, and that they would prefer\ndeath. To such men I answer that even exile is often accompanied\nby no disgrace whatever: if a great man falls, he remains a great\nman after his fall, you can no more suppose that he is disgraced\nthan when people tread upon the walls of a ruined temple, which the\npious treat with as much respect as when they were standing.\nXIV. Since, then, my dearest mother, you have no reason for endless\nweeping on my account, it follows that your tears must flow on your\nown: there are two causes for this, either your having lost my\nprotection, or your not being able to bear the mere fact of separation.\nThe first of these I shall only touch upon lightly, for I know that\nyour heart loves nothing belonging to your children except themselves.\nLet other mothers look to that, who make use of their sons\u2019 authority\nwith a woman\u2019s passion, who are ambitious through their sons because\nthey cannot bear office themselves, who spend their sons\u2019 inheritance,\nand yet are eager to inherit it, and who weary their sons by lending\ntheir eloquence to others: you have always rejoiced exceedingly in\nthe successes of your sons, and have made no use of them whatever:\nyou have always set bounds to our generosity, although you set none\nto your own: you, while a minor under the power of the head of the\nfamily, still used to make presents to your wealthy sons: you managed\nour inheritances with as much care as if you were working for your\nown, yet refrained from touching them as scrupulously as if they\nbelonged to strangers: you have spared to use our influence, as\nthough you enjoyed other means of your own, and you have taken no\npart in the public offices to which we have been elected beyond\nrejoicing in our success and paying our expenses: your indulgence\nhas never been tainted by any thought of profit, and you cannot\nregret the loss of your son for a reason which never had any weight\nwith you before his exile.\n{343}\nXV. All my powers of consolation must be directed to the other\npoint, the true source of your maternal grief. You say, \u201cI am\ndeprived of the embraces of my darling son, I cannot enjoy the\npleasure of seeing him and of hearing him talk. Where is he at whose\nsight I used to smooth my troubled brow, in whose keeping I used\nto deposit all my cares? Where is his conversation, of which I never\ncould have enough? his studies, in which I used to take part with\nmore than a woman\u2019s eagerness, with more than a mother\u2019s familiarity?\nWhere are our meetings? the boyish delight which he always showed\nat the sight of his mother?\u201d To all this you add the actual places\nof our merrymakings and conversation, and, what must needs have\nmore power to move you than anything else, the traces of our late\nsocial life, for Fortune treated you with the additional cruelty\nof allowing you to depart on the very third day before my ruin,\nwithout a trace of anxiety, and not fearing anything of the kind.\nIt was well that we had been separated by a vast distance: it was\nwell that an absence of some years had prepared you to bear this\nblow: you came home, not to take any pleasure in your son, but to\nget rid of the habit of longing for him. Had you been absent long\nbefore, you would have borne it more bravely, as the very length\nof your absence would have moderated your longing to see me: had\nyou never gone away, you would at any rate have gained one last\nadvantage in seeing your son for two days longer: as it was, cruel\nFate so arranged it that you were not present with me during my\ngood fortune, and yet have not become accustomed to my absence. But\nthe harder these things are to bear, the more virtue you must summon\nto your aid, and the more bravely you must struggle as it were with\nan enemy whom you know well, and whom you have already often\nconquered. This blood did not flow from a body previously unhurt:\nyou have been struck through the scar of an old wound.\n{344}\nXVI. You have no grounds for excusing yourself on the ground of\nbeing a woman, who has a sort of right to weep without restraint,\nthough not without limit. For this reason our ancestors allotted a\nspace of ten months\u2019 mourning for women who had lost their husbands,\nthus settling the violence of a woman\u2019s grief by a public ordinance.\nThey did not forbid them to mourn, but they set limits to their\ngrief: for while it is a foolish weakness to give way to endless\ngrief when you lose one of those dearest to you, yet it shows an\nunnatural hardness of heart to express no grief at all: the best\nmiddle course between affection and hard common sense is both to\nfeel regret and to restrain it. You need not look at certain women\nwhose sorrow, when once begun, has been ended only by death: you\nknow some who after the loss of their sons have never laid aside\nthe garb of mourning: you are constitutionally stronger than these,\nand from you more is required. You cannot avail yourself of the\nexcuse of being a woman, for you have no womanish vices. Unchastity,\nthe greatest evil of the age, has never classed you with the majority\nof women; you have not been tempted either by gems or by pearls;\nriches have not allured you into thinking them the greatest blessing\nthat man can own; respectably brought up as you were in an old-fashioned\nand strict household, you have never been led astray by that imitation\nof others which is so full of danger even to virtuous women. You\nhave never been ashamed of your fruitfulness as though it were a\nreproach to your youth: you never concealed the signs of pregnancy\nas though it were an unbecoming burden, nor did you ever destroy\nyour expected child within your womb after the fashion of many other\nwomen, whose attractions are to be found in their beauty alone. You\nnever defiled your face with paints or cosmetics: you never liked\nclothes which showed the figure as plainly as though it were naked:\nyour sole ornament has been a consummate {345} loveliness which no\ntime can impair, your greatest glory has been your modesty. You\ncannot, therefore, plead your womanhood as an excuse for your grief,\nbecause your virtues have raised you above it: you ought to be as\nsuperior to womanish tears as you are to womanish vices. Even women\nwould not allow you to pine away after receiving this blow, but\nwould bid you quickly and calmly go through the necessary amount\nof mourning, and then to arise and shake it off: I mean, if you are\nwilling to take as your models those women whose eminent virtue has\ngiven them a place among even great men. Misfortune reduced the\nnumber of Cornelia\u2019s children from twelve to two: if you count the\nnumber of their deaths, Cornelia had lost ten: if you weigh them,\nshe had lost the Gracchi: nevertheless, when her friends were weeping\naround her and using too bitter imprecations against her fate, she\nforbade them to blame fortune for having deprived[5] her of her\nsons the Gracchi. Such ought to have been the mother of him who,\nwhen speaking in the Forum, said, \u201cWould you speak evil of the\nmother who bore me?\u201d The mother\u2019s speech seems to me to show a far\ngreater spirit: the son set a high value on the birth of the Gracchi;\nthe mother set an equal value on their deaths. Rutilia followed her\nson Cotta into exile, and was so passionately attached to him that\nshe could bear exile better than absence from him; nor did she\nreturn home before her son did so: after he had been restored, and\nhad been raised to honour in the republic, she bore his death as\nbravely as she had borne his exile. No one saw any traces of tears\nupon her cheeks after she had buried her son: she displayed her\ncourage when he was banished, her wisdom when he died: she allowed\nno {346} considerations either to interfere with her affection, or\nto force her to protract a useless and foolish mourning. These are\nthe women with whom I wish you to be numbered: you have the best\nreasons for restraining and suppressing your sorrow as they did,\nbecause you have always imitated their lives.\nXVII. I am aware that this is a matter which is not in our power,\nand that none of the passions, least of all that which arises from\ngrief, are obedient to our wishes; indeed, it is overbearing and\nobstinate, and stubbornly rejects all remedies: we sometimes wish\nto crush it, and to swallow our emotion, but, nevertheless, tears\nflow over our carefully arranged and made-up countenance. Sometimes\nwe occupy our minds with public spectacles and shows of gladiators;\nbut during the very sights by which it is amused, the mind is wrung\nby slight touches of sorrow. It is better, therefore, to conquer\nit than to cheat it; for a grief which has been deceived and driven\naway either by pleasure or by business rises again, and its period\nof rest does but give it strength for a more terrible attack; but\na grief which has been conquered by reason is appeased for ever. I\nshall not, then, give you the advice which so many, I know, adopt,\nthat you should distract your thoughts by a long journey, or amuse\nthem by a beautiful one; that you should spend much of your time\nin the careful examination of accounts, and the management of your\nestate, and that you should keep constantly engaging in new\nenterprises: all these things avail but little, and do not cure,\nbut merely obstruct our sorrow. I had rather it should be brought\nto an end than that it should be cheated: and, therefore, I would\nfain lead you to the study of philosophy, the true place of refuge\nfor all those who are flying from the cruelty of Fortune: this will\nheal your wounds and take away all your sadness: to this you would\nnow have to apply yourself, even though you {347} had never done\nso before; but as far as my father\u2019s old-fashioned strictness\npermitted, you have gained a superficial, though not a thorough\nknowledge of all liberal studies. Would that my father, most excellent\nman that he was, had been less devoted to the customs of our\nancestors, and had been willing to have you thoroughly instructed\nin the elements of philosophy, instead of receiving a mere smattering\nof it! I should not now need to be providing you with the means of\nstruggling against Fortune, but you would offer them to me: but he\ndid not allow you to pursue your studies far, because some women\nuse literature to teach them luxury instead of wisdom. Still, thanks\nto your keen intellectual appetite, you learned more than one could\nhave expected in the time: you laid the foundations of all good\nlearning: now return to them: they will render you safe, they will\nconsole you, and charm you. If once they have thoroughly entered\ninto your mind, grief, anxiety, the distress of vain suffering will\nnever gain admittance thither: your breast will not be open to any\nof these; against all other vices it has long been closed. Philosophy\nis your most trustworthy guardian, and it alone can save you from\nthe attacks of Fortune.\nXVIII. Since, however, you require something to lean upon until you\ncan reach that haven of rest which philosophy offers to you, I wish\nin the meantime to point out to you the consolations which you have.\nLook at my two brothers\u2014while they are safe, you have no grounds\nfor complaint against Fortune; you can derive pleasure from the\nvirtues of each of them, different as they are; the one has gained\nhigh office by attention to business, the other has philosophically\ndespised it. Rejoice in the great place of one of your sons, in the\npeaceful retirement of the other, in the filial affection of both.\nI know my brothers\u2019 most secret motives: the one adorns his high\noffice in order to confer lustre upon you, the {348} other has\nwithdrawn from the world into his life of quiet and contemplation,\nthat he may have full enjoyment of your society. Fortune has consulted\nboth your safety and your pleasure in her disposal of your two sons:\nyou may be protected by the authority of the one, and delighted by\nthe literary leisure of the other. They will vie with one another\nin dutiful affection to you, and the loss of one son will be supplied\nby the love of two others. I can confidently promise that you will\nfind nothing wanting in your sons except their number. Now, then,\nturn your eyes from them to your grandchildren; to Marcus, that\nmost engaging child, whose sight no sorrow can withstand. No grief\ncan be so great or so fresh in any one\u2019s bosom as not to be charmed\naway by his presence. Where are the tears which his joyousness could\nnot dry? whose heart is so nipped by sorrow that his animation would\nnot cause it to dilate? who would not be rendered mirthful by his\nplayfulness? who would not be attracted and made to forget his\ngloomy thoughts by that prattle to which no one can ever be weary\nof listening? I pray the gods that he may survive us: may all the\ncruelty of fate exhaust itself on me and go no further; may all the\nsorrow destined for my mother and my grandmother fall upon me; but\nlet all the rest flourish as they do now: I shall make no complaints\nabout my childlessness or my exile, if only my sacrifice may be\nreceived as a sufficient atonement, and my family suffer nothing\nmore. Hold in your bosom Novatilla, who soon will present you with\ngreat-grandchildren, she whom I had so entirely adopted and made\nmy own, that, now that she has lost me, she seems like an orphan,\neven though her father is alive. Love her for my sake as well as\nfor her own: Fortune has lately deprived her of her mother: your\naffection will be able to prevent her really feeling the loss of\nthe mother whom she mourns. Take this opportunity of forming and\nstrengthening her principles; nothing sinks {349} so deeply into\nthe mind as the teaching which we receive in our earliest years;\nlet her become accustomed to hearing your discourses; let her\ncharacter be moulded according to your pleasure: she will gain much\neven if you give her nothing more than your example. This continually\nrecurring duty will be a remedy in itself: for when your mind is\nfull of maternal sorrow, nothing can distract it from its grief\nexcept either philosophic argument or honourable work. I should\ncount your father among your greatest consolations, were he not\nabsent: as it is, judge from your affection for me what his affection\nis for you, and then you will see how much more just it is that you\nshould be preserved for him than that you should be sacrificed to\nme. Whenever your keenest paroxysms of grief assail you and bid you\ngive way to them, think of your father. By giving him so many\ngrandchildren and great-grandchildren you have made yourself no\nlonger his only daughter; but you alone can crown his prosperous\nlife by a happy end: as long as he is alive it is impiety for you\nto regret having been born.\nXIX. I have hitherto said nothing of your chief source of consolation,\nyour sister, that most faithful heart which shares all your sorrows\nas fully as your own, and who feels for all of us like a mother.\nWith her you have mingled your tears, on her bosom you have tasted\nyour first repose: she always feels for your troubles, and when I\nam in the case she does not grieve for you alone. It was in her\narms that I was carried into Rome: by her affectionate and motherly\nnursing I regained my strength after a long period of sickness: she\nenlarged her influence to obtain the office of quaestor for me, and\nher fondness for me made her conquer a shyness which at other times\nmade her shrink from speaking to, or loudly greeting her friends.\nNeither her retired mode of life, nor her country-bred modesty, at\na time when so many women display such boldness of manner, her\nplacidity, nor her habits of solitary seclusion {350} prevented her\nfrom becoming actually ambitious on my account. Here, my dearest\nmother, is a source from which you may gain true consolation: join\nyourself, as far as you are able, to her, bind yourself to her by\nthe closest embraces. Those who are in sorrow are wont to flee from\nthose who are dearest to them, and to seek liberty for the indulgence\nof their grief: do you let her share your every thought: if you\nwish to nurse your grief, she will be your companion, if you wish\nto lay it aside she will bring it to an end. If, however, I rightly\nunderstand the wisdom of that most perfect woman, she will not\nsuffer you to waste your life in unprofitable mourning, and will\ntell you what happened in her own instance, which I myself witnessed.\nDuring a sea-voyage she lost a beloved husband, my uncle, whom she\nmarried when a maiden; she endured at the same time grief for him\nand fear for herself, and at last, though shipwrecked, nevertheless\nrescued his body from the vanquished tempest. How many noble deeds\nare unknown to fame! If only she had had the simple-minded ancients\nto admire her virtues, how many brilliant intellects would have\nvied with one another in singing the praises of a wife who forgot\nthe weakness of her sex, forgot the perils of the sea, which terrify\neven the boldest, exposed herself to death in order to lay him in\nthe earth, and who was so eager to give him decent burial that she\ncared nothing about whether she shared it or no. All the poets have\nmade the wife[6] famous who gave herself to death instead of her\nhusband: my aunt did more when she risked her life in order to give\nher husband a tomb: it shows greater love to endure the same peril\nfor a less important end. After this, no one need wonder that for\nsixteen years, during which her husband governed the province of\nEgypt, she was never beheld in public, never admitted any of the\nnatives to her house, never {351} begged any favour of her husband,\nand never allowed anyone to beg one of her. Thus it came to pass\nthat a gossiping province, ingenious in inventing scandal about its\nrulers, in which even the blameless often incurred disgrace, respected\nher as a singular example of uprightness,[7] never made free with\nher name,\u2014a remarkable piece of self-restraint among a people who\nwill risk everything rather than forego a jest,\u2014and that at the\npresent time it hopes for another governor\u2019s wife like her, although\nit has no reasonable expectation of ever seeing one. It would have\nbeen greatly to her credit if the province had approved her conduct\nfor a space of sixteen years: it was much more creditable to her\nthat it knew not of her existence. I do not remind you of this in\norder to celebrate her praises, for to take such scanty notice of\nthem is to curtail them, but in order that you may understand the\nmagnanimity of a woman who has not yielded either to ambition or\nto avarice, those twin attendants and scourges of authority, who,\nwhen her ship was disabled and her own death was impending, was not\nrestrained by fear from keeping fast hold of her husband\u2019s dead\nbody, and who sought not how to escape from the wreck, but how to\ncarry him out of it with her. You must now show a virtue equal to\nhers, recall your mind from grief, and take care that no one may\nthink that you are sorry that you have borne a son.\nXX. However, since it is necessary, whatever you do, that your\nthoughts should sometimes revert to me, and that I should now be\npresent to your mind more often than your other children, not because\nthey are less dear to you, but because it is natural to lay one\u2019s\nhands more often upon a place that pains one; learn how you are to\nthink of me: I am as joyous and cheerful as in my best days: indeed\nthese {352} days are my best, because my mind is relieved from all\npressure of business and is at leisure to attend to its own affairs,\nand at one time amuses itself with lighter studies, at another\neagerly presses its inquiries into its own nature and that of the\nuniverse: first it considers the countries of the world and their\nposition: then the character of the sea which flows between them,\nand the alternate ebbings and flowings of its tides; next it\ninvestigates all the terrors which hang between heaven and earth,\nthe region which is torn asunder by thunderings, lightnings, gusts\nof wind, vapour, showers of snow and hail. Finally, having traversed\nevery one of the realms below, it soars to the highest heaven,\nenjoys the noblest of all spectacles, that of things divine, and,\nremembering itself to be eternal, reviews all that has been and all\nthat will be for ever and ever.\n[1] Corsica.\n[2] Seneca himself was of Spanish extraction.\n[3] Qu., oysters from Britain.\n[4] The allusion is evidently to Regulus.\n[5] I think Madvig\u2019s _ademisset_ spoils the sense. _Dedisset_ means:\n\u201cwhen you bid me mourn the loss of the Gracchi you bid me blame\nfortune for having given me such sons.\u201d \u201c\u2019Tis better to have loved\nand lost than to have never loved at all.\u201d\u2014J.

M.\n{353}\nTHE TWELFTH BOOK OF THE DIALOGUES OF L. ANNAEUS SENECA, ADDRESSED\nTO POLYBIUS.\nOF CONSOLATION.\nI. .... compared with ours is firm and lasting; but if you transfer\nit to the domain of Nature, which destroys everything and calls\neverything back to the place from whence it came, it is transitory.\nWhat, indeed, have mortal hands made that is not mortal? The seven\nwonders of the world, and any even greater wonders which the ambition\nof later ages has constructed, will be seen some day levelled with\nthe ground. So it is: nothing lasts for ever, few things even last\nfor long: all are susceptible of decay in one way or another. The\nways in which things come to an end are manifold, but yet everything\nthat has a beginning has an end also. Some threaten the world with\ndeath, and, though you may think the thought to be impious, this\nentire universe, containing gods and men and all their works will\nsome day be swept away and plunged a second time into its original\ndarkness and chaos. Weep, if you can, after this, over the loss of\nany individual life! Can we mourn the ashes of Carthage, Numantia,\nCorinth, or any city that has fallen from a high estate, when we\nknow that the world must perish, albeit it has no place {354} into\nwhich it can fall. Weep, if you can, because Fate has not spared\nyou, she who some day will dare to work so great a wickedness! Who\ncan be so haughtily and peevishly arrogant as to expect that this\nlaw of nature by which everything is brought to an end will be set\naside in his own case, and that his own house will be exempted from\nthe ruin which menaces the whole world itself? It is, therefore, a\ngreat consolation to reflect that what has happened to us has\nhappened to every one before us and will happen to every one after\nus. In my opinion, nature has made her cruellest acts affect all\nmen alike, in order that the universality of their lot might console\nthem for its hardship.\nII. It will also be no small assistance to you to reflect that grief\ncan do no good either to him whom you have lost or to yourself, and\nyou would not wish to protract what is useless: for if we could\ngain anything by sorrow, I should not refuse to bestow upon your\nmisfortunes whatever tears my own have left at my disposal: I would\nforce some drops to flow from these eyes, exhausted as they are\nwith weeping over my own domestic afflictions, were it likely to\nbe of any service to you. Why do you hesitate? let us lament together,\nand I will even make this quarrel my own:\u2014\u201cFortune, whom every one\nthinks most unjust, you seemed hitherto to have restrained yourself\nfrom attacking one who by your favour had become the object of such\nuniversal respect that\u2014rare distinction for any one\u2014his prosperity\nhad excited no jealousy: but now, behold! you have dealt him the\ncruellest wound which, while Caesar lives, he could receive, and\nafter reconnoitring him from all sides you have discovered that on\nthis point alone he was exposed to your strokes. What else indeed\ncould you have done to him? should you take away his wealth? he\nnever was its slave: now he has even as far as possible put it away\nfrom him, and the chief thing that he has gained by his unrivalled\nfacilities {355} for amassing money has been to despise it. Should\nyou take away his friends? you knew that he was of so loveable a\ndisposition that he could easily gain others to replace those whom\nhe might lose: for of all the powerful officers of the Imperial\nhousehold he seems to me to be the only one whom all men wish to\nhave for their friend without considering how advantageous his\nfriendship would be. Should you take away his reputation? it is so\nfirmly established, that even you could not shake it. Should you\ntake away his health? you knew that his mind was so grounded on\nphilosophical studies, in whose schools he was born as well as bred,\nthat it would rise superior to any sufferings of the body. Should\nyou take away his breath? how small an injury would that be to him?\nfame promised his genius one of the longest of lives: he himself\nhas taken care that his better part should remain alive, and has\nguarded himself against death by the composition of his admirable\nworks of eloquence: as long as literature shall be held in any\nhonour, as long as the vigour of the Latin or the grace of the Greek\nlanguage shall endure, he will flourish together with their greatest\nwriters, with whose genius he has measured, or, if his modesty will\nnot let me say this, has connected his own. This, then, was the\nonly means you could devise of doing him a great injury. The better\na man is, the more frequently he is wont to suffer from your\nindiscriminate rage, you who are to be feared even when you are\nbestowing benefits upon one. How little it would have cost you to\navert this blow from one upon whom your favours seemed to be conferred\naccording to some regular plan, and not to be flung at random in\nyour wonted fashion!\u201d\nIII. Let us add, if you please, to these grounds of complaint the\ndisposition of the youth himself, cut off in the midst of its first\ngrowth. He was worthy to be your brother: you most certainly did\nnot deserve to be given {356} any pain through your brother, even\nthough he had been unworthy. All men alike bear witness to his\nmerits: he is regretted for your sake, and is praised for his own.\nHe had no qualities which you would not be glad to recognize. You\nwould indeed have been good to a worse brother, but to him your\nfraternal love was given all the more freely because in him it found\nso fitting a field for its exercise. No one ever was made to feel\nhis influence by receiving wrongs at his hands, he never used the\nfact of your being his brother to threaten any one: he had moulded\nhis character after the pattern of your modesty, and reflected how\ngreat a glory and how great a burden you were to your family: the\nburden he was able to sustain; but, O pitiless Fate, always unjust\nto virtue\u2014before your brother could taste the happiness of his\nposition, he was called away. I am well aware that I express my\nfeelings inadequately; for nothing is harder than to find words\nwhich adequately represent great grief: still, let us again lament\nfor him, if it be of any use to do so:\u2014\u201cWhat did you mean, Fortune,\nby being so unjust and so savage? did you so soon repent you of\nyour favour? What cruelty it was to fall upon brothers, to break\nup so loving a circle by so deadly an attack; why did you bring\nmourning into a house so plenteously stocked with admirable youths,\nin which no brother came short of the high standard of the rest,\nand without any cause pluck one of them away? So, then, scrupulous\ninnocency of life, old-fashioned frugality, the power of amassing\nvast wealth wielded with the greatest self-denial, a true and\nimperishable love of literature, a mind free from the least spot\nof sin, all avail nothing: Polybius is in mourning, and, warned by\nthe fate of one brother what he may have to dread for the rest, he\nfears for the very persons who soothe his grief. O shame! Polybius\nis in mourning, and mourns even though he still enjoys the favour\nof Caesar. No doubt, Fortune, what you aimed at in {357} your\nimpotent rage was to prove that no one could be protected from your\nattacks, not even by Caesar himself.\u201d\nIV. We might go on blaming fate much longer, but we cannot alter\nit: it stands harsh and inexorable: no one can move it by reproaches,\nby tears, or by justice. Fate never spares any one, never makes\nallowances to any one. Let us, then, refrain from unprofitable\ntears: for our grief will carry us away to join him sooner than it\nwill bring him back to us: and if it tortures us without helping\nus, we ought to lay it aside as soon as possible, and restore the\ntone of our minds after their indulgence in that vain solace and\nthe bitter luxury of woe: for unless reason puts an end to our\ntears, fortune will not do so. Look around, I pray you, upon all\nmortals: everywhere there is ample and constant reason for weeping:\none man is driven to daily labour by toilsome poverty, another is\ntormented by never-resting ambition, another fears the very riches\nthat he once wished for, and suffers from the granting of his own\nprayer: one man is made wretched by loneliness, another by labour,\nanother by the crowds which always besiege his antechamber. This\nman mourns because he has children, that one because he has lost\nthem. Tears will fail us sooner than causes for shedding them. Do\nyou not see what sort of a life it must be that Nature has promised\nto us men when she makes us weep as soon as we are born? We begin\nlife in this fashion, and all the chain of years that follow it is\nin harmony with it. Thus we pass our lives, and consequently we\nought to be sparing in doing what we have to do so often, and when\nwe look back upon the mass of sorrows that hangs over us, we ought,\nif not to end our tears, at any rate to reserve them. There is\nnothing that we ought to husband more carefully than this, which\nwe are so often obliged to expend.\nV. It will also be no small assistance to you to consider that there\nis no one to whom your grief is more offensive {358} than he upon\nwhom it is nominally bestowed: he either does not wish you to suffer\nor does not understand why you suffer. There is, therefore, no\nreason for a service which is useless if it is not felt by him who\nis the object of it, and which is displeasing to him if it is. I\ncan boldly affirm that there is no one in the whole world who derives\nany pleasure from your tears. What then? do you suppose that your\nbrother has a feeling against you which no one else has, that he\nwishes you to be injured by your self-torture, that he desires to\nseparate you from the business of your life, that is, from philosophy\nand from Caesar? that is not likely: for he always gave way to you\nas a brother, respected you as a parent, courted you as a superior.\nHe wishes to be fondly remembered by you, but not to be a source\nof agony to you. Why, then, should you insist upon pining away with\na grief which, if the dead have any feelings, your brother wishes\nto bring to an end? If it were any other brother about whose affection\nthere could be any question, I should put all this vaguely, and\nsay, \u201cIf your brother wishes you to be tortured with endless mourning,\nhe does not deserve such affection: if he does not wish it, dismiss\nthe grief which affects you both: an unnatural brother ought not,\na good brother would not wish to be so mourned for,\u201d but with one\nwhose brotherly love has been so clearly proved, we may be quite\nsure that nothing could hurt him more than that you should be hurt\nby his loss, that it should agonize you, that your eyes, most\nundeserving as they are of such a fate, should be by the same cause\ncontinually filled and drained of never-ceasing tears.\nNothing however will restrain your loving nature from these useless\ntears so effectually as the reflexion that you ought to show your\nbrothers an example by bearing this outrage of fortune bravely. You\nought to imitate great generals in times of disaster, when they are\ncareful to affect {359} a cheerful demeanour, and conceal misfortunes\nby a counterfeited joyousness, lest, if the soldiers saw their\nleader cast down, they should themselves become dispirited. This\nmust now be done by you also. Put on a countenance that does not\nreflect your feelings, and if you possibly can, cast out conceal\nit within you and hide it away so that it may not be seen, and take\ncare that your brothers, who will think everything honourable that\nthey see you doing, imitate you in this and take courage from the\nsight of your looks. It is your duty to be both their comfort and\ntheir consoler; but you will have no power to check their grief if\nyou humour your own.\nVI. It may also keep you from excessive grief if you remind yourself\nthat nothing which you do can be done in secret: all men agree in\nregarding you as an important personage, and you must keep up this\ncharacter: you are encompassed by all that mass of offerers of\nconsolation who all are peering into your mind to learn how much\nstrength it has to resist grief, and whether you merely know how\nto avail yourself cunningly of prosperity, or whether you can also\nbear adversity with a manly spirit: the expression of your very\neyes is watched. Those who are able to conceal their feelings may\nindulge them more freely; but you are not free to have any secresy:\nyour fortune has set you in so brilliant a position, that nothing\nwhich you do can be hid: all men will know how you have borne this\nwound of yours, whether you laid down your arms at the first shock\nor whether you stood your ground. Long ago the love of Caesar raised\nyou, and your own literary pursuits brought you, to the highest\nrank in the state: nothing vulgar, nothing mean befits you: yet\nwhat can be meaner or more womanish than to make oneself a victim\nto grief? Although your sorrow is as great as that of your brothers,\nyet you may not indulge it as much as they: the ideas which the\npublic have formed about your philosophic {360} learning and your\ncharacter make many things impossible for you. Men demand much, and\nexpect much from you: you ought not to have drawn all eyes upon\nyourself, if you wished to be allowed to act as you pleased: as it\nis, you must make good that of which you have given promise. All\nthose, who praise the works of your genius, who make copies of them,\nwho need your genius if they do not need your fortune, are as guards\nset over your mind: you cannot, therefore, ever do anything unworthy\nof the character of a thorough philosopher and sage, without many\nmen feeling sorry that they ever admired you. You may not weep\nbeyond reason: nor is this the only thing that you may not do: you\nmay not so much as remain asleep after daybreak, or retreat from\nthe noisy troubles of public business to the peaceful repose of the\ncountry, or refresh yourself with a pleasure tour when wearied by\nconstant attendance to the duties of your toilsome post, or amuse\nyourself with beholding various shows, or even arrange your day\naccording to your own wish. Many things are forbidden to you which\nare permitted to the poorest beggars that lie about in holes and\ncorners. A great fortune is a great slavery; you may not do anything\naccording to your wish: you must give audiences to all those thousands\nof people, you must take charge of all those petitions: you must\ncheer yourself up, in order that all this mass of business which\nflows hither from every part of the world may be offered in due\norder for the consideration of our excellent emperor. I repeat, you\nyourself are forbidden to weep, that you may be able to listen to\nso many weeping petitioners: your own tears must be dried, in order\nthat the tears of those who are in peril and who desire to obtain\nthe gracious pardon of the kindest-hearted of Caesars may be dried.\nVII. These reflexions will serve you as partial remedies for your\ngrief, but if you wish to forget it altogether, remember Caesar:\nthink with what loyalty, with what {361} industry you are bound to\nrequite the favours which he has shown you: you will then see that\nyou can no more sink beneath your burden than could he of whom the\nmyths tells us, he whose shoulders upheld the world. Even Caesar,\nwho may do all things, may not do many things for this very reason:\nhis watchfulness protects all men\u2019s sleep, his labour guarantees\ntheir leisure, his toil ensures their pleasures, his work preserves\ntheir holidays. On the day on which Caesar devoted his services to\nthe universe, he lost them for himself, and like the planets which\never unrestingly pursue their course, he can never halt or attend\nto any affair of his own. After a certain fashion this prohibition\nis imposed upon you also; you may not consider your own interests,\nor devote yourself to your own studies: while Caesar owns the world,\nyou cannot allow either joy or grief, or anything else to occupy\nany part of you: you owe your entire self to Caesar. Add to this\nthat, since you have always declared that Caesar was dearer to you\nthan your own life, you have no right to complain of misfortune as\nlong as Caesar is alive: while he is safe all your friends are\nalive, you have lost nothing, your eyes ought not only to be dry,\nbut glad. In him is your all, he stands in the place of all else\nto you: you are not grateful enough for your present happy state\n(which God forbid that one of your most wise and loyal disposition\nshould be) if you permit yourself to weep at all while Caesar is\nsafe.\nVIII. I will now point out to you yet another remedy, of a more\ndomestic, though not of a more efficacious character. Your sorrow\nis most to be feared when you have retired to your own home: for\nas long as your divinity is before your eyes, it can find no means\nof access to you, but Caesar will possess your entire being; when\nyou have left his presence, grief, as though it then had an opportunity\nof attack, will lie in ambush for you in your loneliness, and creep\nby degrees over your mind as it rests from its labours. {362} You\nought not, therefore, to allow any moment to be unoccupied by\nliterary pursuits: at such times let literature repay to you the\ndebt which your long and faithful love has laid upon it, let it\nclaim you for its high priest and worshipper: at such times let\nHomer[1] and Virgil be much in your company, those poets to whom\nthe human race owes as much as every one owes to you, and they\nespecially, because you have made them known to a wider circle than\nthat for which they wrote. All time which you entrust to their\nkeeping will be safe. At such times, as far as you are able, compile\nan account of your Caesar\u2019s acts, that they may be read by all\nfuture ages in a panegyric written by one of his own household: for\nhe himself will afford you both the noblest subject and the noblest\nexample for putting together and composing a history. I dare not\ngo so far as to advise you to write in your usual elegant style a\nversion of Aesop\u2019s fables, a work which no Roman intellect has\nhitherto attempted. It is hard, no doubt, for a mind which has\nreceived so rude a shock to betake itself so quickly to these\nlivelier pursuits: but if it is able to pass from more serious\nstudies to these lighter ones, you must regard it as a proof that\nit has recovered its strength, and is itself again. In the former\ncase, although it may suffer and hang back, still it will be led\non by the serious nature of the subject under consideration to take\nan interest in it: but, unless it has thoroughly recovered, it will\nnot endure to treat of subjects which must be written of in a\ncheerful spirit. You ought, therefore, first to exercise your mind\nupon grave studies, and then to enliven it with gayer ones.\n{363}\nIX. It will also be a great solace to you if you often ask yourself:\n\u201cAm I grieving on my own account or on that of him who is gone? if\non my own, I have no right to boast of my affectionate sensibility;\ngrief is only excusable as long as it is honourable; but when it\nis only caused by personal interests, it no longer springs from\ntenderness: nothing can be less becoming to a good man than to make\na calculation about his grief for his brother. If I grieve on his\naccount, I must necessarily take one of the two following views:\nif the dead retain no feeling whatever, my brother has escaped from\nall the troubles of life, has been restored to the place which he\noccupied before his birth, and, being free from every kind of ill,\ncan neither fear, nor desire, nor suffer: what madness then for me\nnever to cease grieving for one who will never grieve again? If the\ndead have any feeling, then my brother is now like one who has been\nlet out of a prison in which he has long been confined, who at last\nis free and his own master, and who enjoys himself, amuses himself\nwith viewing the works of Nature, and looks down from above the\nearth upon all human things, while he looks at things divine, whose\nmeaning he has long sought in vain, from a much nearer standpoint.\nWhy then am I wasting away with grief for one who is either in bliss\nor non-existent? it would be envy to weep for one who is in bliss,\nit would be madness to weep for one who has no existence whatever.\u201d\nAre you affected by the thought that he appears to have been deprived\nof great blessings just at the moment when they came crowding upon\nhim? after thinking how much he has lost, call to mind how much\nmore he has ceased to fear: anger will never more wring his heart,\ndisease will not crush him, suspicion will not disquiet him, the\ngnawing pain of envy which we feel at the successes of others will\nnot attend him, terror will not make him wretched, the fickleness\nof fortune who quickly transfers her favours from one man {364} to\nanother will not alarm him. If you reckon it up properly, he has\nbeen spared more than he has lost. He will not enjoy wealth, or\nyour influence at Court, or his own: he will not receive benefits,\nand will not confer them: do you imagine him to be unhappy, because\nhe has lost these things, or happy because he does not miss them?\nBelieve me, he who does not need good fortune is happier than he\non whom it attends: all those good things which charm us by the\nattractive but unreal pleasures which they afford, such as money,\nhigh office, influence, and many other things which dazzle the\nstupid greed of mankind, require hard labour to keep, are regarded\nby others with bitter jealousy, and are more of a menace than an\nadvantage to those who are bedecked and encumbered by them. They\nare slippery and uncertain; one never can enjoy them in comfort;\nfor, even setting aside anxiety about the future, the present\nmanagement of great prosperity is an uneasy task. If we are to\nbelieve some profound seekers after truth, life is all torment: we\nare flung, as it were, into this deep and rough sea, whose tides\nebb and flow, at one time raising us aloft by sudden accessions of\nfortune, at another bringing down low by still greater losses, and\nfor ever tossing us about, never letting us rest on firm ground.\nWe roll and plunge upon the waves, and sometimes strike against one\nanother, sometimes are shipwrecked, always are in terror. For those\nwho sail upon this stormy sea, exposed as it is to every gale, there\nis no harbour save death. Do not, then, grudge your brother his\nrest: he has at last become free, safe, and immortal: he leaves\nsurviving him Caesar and all his family, yourself, and his and your\nbrothers. He left Fortune before she had ceased to regard him with\nfavour, while she stood still by him, offering him gifts with a\nfull hand. He now ranges free and joyous through the boundless\nheavens; he has left this poor and low-lying region, and has soared\n{365} upwards to that place, whatever it may be, which receives in\nits happy bosom the souls which have been set free from the chains\nof matter: he now roams there at liberty, and enjoys with the keenest\ndelight all the blessings of Nature. You are mistaken! your brother\nhas not lost the light of day, but has obtained a more enduring\nlight: whither he has gone, we all alike must go: why then do we\nweep for his fate? He has not left us, but has gone on before us.\nBelieve me, there is great happiness in a happy death. We cannot\nbe sure of anything even for one whole day: since the truth is so\ndark and hard to come at, who can tell whether death came to your\nbrother out of malice or out of kindness?\nX. One who is as just in all things as you are, must find comfort\nin the thought that no wrong has been done you by the loss of so\nnoble a brother, but that you have received a benefit by having\nbeen permitted for so long a time to enjoy his affection. He who\nwill not allow his benefactor to choose his own way of bestowing a\ngift upon him, is unjust: he who does not reckon what he receives\nas gain, and yet reckons what he gives back again as loss, is greedy:\nhe who says that he has been wronged, because his pleasure has come\nto an end, is ungrateful: he who thinks that we gain nothing from\ngood things beyond the present enjoyment of them, is a fool, because\nhe finds no pleasure in past joys, and does not regard those which\nare gone as his most certain possessions, since he need not fear\nthat they will come to an end. A man limits his pleasures too\nnarrowly if he believes that he enjoys those things only which he\ntouches and sees, if he counts the having enjoyed them for nothing:\nfor all pleasure quickly leaves us, seeing that it flows away, flits\nacross our lives, and is gone almost before it has come. We ought,\ntherefore, to make our mind travel back over past time, to bring\nback whatever we once took pleasure in, and frequently to ruminate\nover it {366} in our thoughts: the remembrance of pleasures is truer\nand more trustworthy than their reality. Regard it, then, among\nyour greatest blessings that you have had an excellent brother: you\nneed not think for how much longer you might have had him, but for\nhow long you did have him. Nature gave him to you, as she gives\nothers to other brothers, not as an absolute property, but as a\nloan: afterwards when she thought proper she took him back again,\nand followed her own rules of action, instead of waiting until you\nhad indulged your love to satiety. If any one were to be indignant\nat having to repay a loan of money, especially if he had been allowed\nto use it without having to pay any interest, would he not be thought\nan unreasonable man? Nature gave your brother his life, just as she\ngave you yours: exercising her lawful rights, she has chosen to ask\none of you to repay her loan before the other: she cannot be blamed\nfor this, for you knew the conditions on which you received it: you\nmust blame the greedy hopes of mortal men\u2019s minds, which every now\nand then forget what Nature is, and never remember their own lot\nunless reminded of it. Rejoice, then, that you have had so good a\nbrother, and be grateful for having had the use and enjoyment of\nhim, though it was for a shorter time than you wished. Reflect that\nwhat you have had of him was most delightful, that your having lost\nhim is an accident common to mankind. There is nothing more\ninconsistent than that a man should grieve that so good a brother\nwas not long enough with him, and should not rejoice that he\nnevertheless has been with him.\nXI. \u201cBut,\u201d you say, \u201che was taken away unexpectedly.\u201d Every man is\ndeceived by his own willingness to believe what he wishes, and he\nchooses to forget that those whom he loves are mortal: yet Nature\ngives us clear proofs that she will not suspend her laws in favour\nof any one: the funeral processions of our friends and of strangers\nalike {367} pass daily before our eyes, yet we take no notice of\nthem, and when an event happens which our whole life warns us will\nsome day happen, we call it sudden. This is not, therefore, the\ninjustice of fate, but the perversity and insatiable universal\ngreediness of the human mind, which is indignant at having to leave\na place to which it was only admitted on sufferance. How far more\nrighteous was he who, on hearing of the death of his son, made a\nspeech worthy of a great man, saying: \u201cWhen I begat him, I knew\nthat he would die some day.\u201d Indeed, you need not be surprised at\nthe son of such a man being able to die bravely. He did not receive\nthe tidings of his son\u2019s death as news: for what is there new in a\nman\u2019s dying, when his whole life is merely a journey towards death?\n\u201cWhen I begat him, I knew that he would die some day,\u201d said he: and\nthen he added, what showed even more wisdom and courage, \u201cIt was\nfor this that I brought him up.\u201d It is for this that we have all\nbeen brought up: every one who is brought into life is intended to\ndie. Let us enjoy what is given to us, and give it back when it is\nasked for: the Fates lay their hands on some men at some times, and\non other men at other times, but they will never pass any one by\naltogether. Our mind ought always to be on the alert, and while it\nought never to fear what is certain to happen, it ought always to\nbe ready for what may happen at any time. Why need I tell you of\ngenerals and the children of generals, of men ennobled by many\nconsulships and triumphs, who have succumbed to pitiless fate? whole\nkingdoms together with their kings, whole nations with all their\ncomponent tribes, have all submitted to their doom. All men, nay,\nall things look forward to an end of their days: yet all do not\ncome to the same end: one man loses his life in the midst of his\ncareer, another at the very beginning of it, another seems hardly\nable to free himself from it when worn out with extreme old age,\nand eager to {368} be released: we are all going to the same place,\nbut we all go thither at different times, I know not whether it is\nmore foolish not to know the law of mortality, or more presumptuous\nto refuse to obey it. Come, take into your hands the poems[2] of\nwhichever you please of those two authors upon whom your genius has\nexpended so much labour, whom you have so well paraphrased, that\nalthough the structure of the verse be removed, its charm nevertheless\nis preserved; for you have transferred them from one language to\nanother so well as to effect the most difficult matter of all, that\nof making all the beauties of the original reappear in a foreign\nspeech: among their works you will find no volume which will not\noffer you numberless instances of the vicissitudes of human life,\nof the uncertainty of events, and of tears shed for various reasons.\nRead with what fire you have thundered out their swelling phrases:\nyou will feel ashamed of suddenly failing and falling short of the\nelevation of their magnificent language. Do not commit the fault\nof making every one, who according to his ability admires your\nwritings, ask how so frail a mind can have formed such stable and\nwell-connected ideas.\nXII. Turn yourself away from these thoughts which torment you, and\nlook rather at those numerous and powerful sources of consolation\nwhich you possess: look at your excellent brothers, look at your\nwife and your son. It is to guarantee the safety of all these that\nFortune[3] has struck you in this quarter: you have many left in\nwhom you can take comfort. Guard yourself from the shame of letting\nall men think that a single grief has more power with you than these\nmany consolations. You see all of them cast down into the same\ndespondency as yourself, and you know that they cannot help you,\nnay, that on the other hand they look to {369} you to encourage\nthem: wherefore, the less learning and the less intellect they\npossess, the more vigorously you ought to withstand the evil which\nhas fallen upon you all. The very fact of one\u2019s grief being shared\nby many persons acts as a consolation, because if it be distributed\namong such a number the share of it which falls upon you must be\nsmall. I shall never cease to recall your thoughts to Caesar. While\nhe governs the earth, and shows how far better the empire may be\nmaintained by kindnesses than by arms, while he presides over the\naffairs of mankind, there is no danger of your feeling that you\nhave lost anything: in this fact alone you will find ample help and\nample consolation; raise yourself up, and fix your eyes upon Caesar\nwhenever tears rise to them; they will become dry on beholding that\ngreatest and most brilliant light; his splendour will attract them\nand firmly attach them to himself, so that they are able to see\nnothing else. He whom you behold both by day and by night, from\nwhom your mind never deviates to meaner matters, must occupy your\nthoughts and be your defence against Fortune; indeed, so kind and\ngracious as he is towards all his followers that he has already, I\ndoubt not, laid many healing balms upon this wound of yours, and\nfurnished you with many antidotes for your sorrow. Why, even had\nhe done nothing of the kind, is not the mere sight and thought of\nCaesar in itself your greatest consolation? May the gods and goddesses\nlong spare him to the earth: may he rival the deeds of the Emperor\nAugustus, and surpass him in length of days! as long as he remains\namong mortals, may he never be reminded that any of his house are\nmortal: may he train up his son by long and faithful service to be\nthe ruler of the Roman people, and see him share his father\u2019s power\nbefore he succeeds to it: may the day on which his kindred shall\nclaim him for heaven be far distant, and may our grandchildren alone\nbe alive to see it.\n{370}\nXIII. Fortune, refrain your hands from him, and show your power\nover him only in doing him good: allow him to heal the long sickness\nfrom which mankind has suffered; to replace and restore whatever\nhas been shattered by the frenzy of our late sovereign: may this\nstar, which has shed its rays upon a world overthrown and cast into\ndarkness, ever shine brightly: may he give peace to Germany, open\nBritain to us, and lead through the city triumphs, both over the\nnations whom his fathers conquered, and over new ones. Of these his\nclemency, the first of his many virtues, gives me hopes of being a\nspectator: for he has not so utterly cast me down that he will never\nraise me up again; nay, he has not cast me down at all; rather he\nhas supported me when I was struck by evil fortune and was tottering,\nand has gently used his godlike hand to break my headlong fall: he\npleaded with the Senate on my behalf, and not only gave me my life\nbut even begged it for me. He will see to my cause: let him judge\nmy cause to be such as he would desire; let his justice pronounce\nit good or his clemency so regard it: his kindness to me will be\nequal in either case, whether he knows me to be innocent or chooses\nthat I should be thought so. Meanwhile it is a great comfort to me\nfor my own miseries to behold his pardons travelling throughout the\nworld: even from the corner in which I am confined his mercy has\nunearthed and restored to light many exiles who had been buried and\nforgotten here for long years, and I have no fear that I alone shall\nbe passed over by it. He best knows the time at which he ought to\nshow favour to each man: I will use my utmost efforts to prevent\nhis having to blush when he comes to me. O how blessed is your\nclemency, Caesar, which makes exiles live more peacefully during\nyour reign than princes did in that of Gaius! We do not tremble or\nexpect the fatal stroke every hour, nor are we terrified whenever\na ship comes in sight: you have set bounds to the cruelty of Fortune\ntowards {371} us, and have given us present peace and hopes of a\nhappier future. You may indeed be sure that those thunderbolts alone\nare just which are worshipped even by those who are struck by them.\nXIV. Thus this prince, who is the universal consoler of all men,\nhas, unless I am altogether mistaken, already revived your spirit\nand applied more powerful remedies to so severe a wound than I can:\nhe has already strengthened you in every way: his singularly retentive\nmemory has already furnished you with all the examples which will\nproduce tranquillity: his practised eloquence has already displayed\nbefore you all the precepts of sages. No one therefore could console\nyou as well as he: when he speaks his words have greater weight,\nas though they were the utterances of an oracle: his divine authority\nwill crush all the strength of your grief. Think, then, that he\nspeaks to you as follows:\u2014\u201cFortune has not chosen you as the only\nman in the world to receive so severe a blow: there is no house in\nall the earth, and never has been one, that has not something to\nmourn for: I will pass over examples taken from the common herd,\nwhich, while they are of less importance, are also endless in number,\nand I will direct your attention to the Calendar and the State\nChronicles. Do you see all these images which fill the hall of the\nCaesars? there is not one of these men who was not especially\nafflicted by domestic sorrows: no one of those men who shine there\nas the ornament of the ages was not either tortured by grief for\nsome of his family or most bitterly mourned for by those whom he\nleft behind. Why need I remind you of Scipio Africanus, who heard\nthe news of his brother\u2019s death when he was himself in exile? he\nwho saved his brother from prison could not save him from his fate.\nYet all men saw how impatient Africanus\u2019s brotherly affection was\neven of equal law: on the same day on which Scipio Africanus rescued\nhis brother from the {372} hands of the apparitor, he, although not\nholding any office, protested against the action of the tribune of\nthe people. He mourned for his brother as magnanimously as he had\ndefended him. Why need I remind you of Scipio Aemilianus,[4] who\nalmost at one and the same time beheld his father\u2019s triumph and the\nfuneral of his two brothers? yet, although a stripling and hardly\nmore than a boy, he bore the sudden bereavement which befel his\nfamily at the very time of Paulus\u2019s triumph with all the courage\nwhich beseemed one who was born that Rome might not be without a\nScipio and that she might be without a Carthage.\nXV. Why should I speak of the intimacy of the two Luculli, which\nwas broken only by their death? or of the Pompeii? whom the cruelty\nof Fortune did not even allow to perish by the same catastrophe;\nfor Sextus Pompeius in the first place survived his sister,[5] by\nwhose death the firmly knit bond of peace in the Roman empire was\nbroken, and he also survived his noble brother, whom Fortune had\nraised so high in order that she might cast him down from as great\na height as she had already cast down his father; yet after this\ngreat misfortune Sextus Pompeius was able not only to endure his\ngrief but even to make war. Innumerable instances occur to me of\nbrothers who were separated by death: indeed on the other hand we\nsee very few pairs of brothers growing old together: however, I\nshall content myself with examples from my own family. No one can\nbe so devoid of feeling or of reason as to complain of Fortune\u2019s\nhaving thrown him into mourning when he learns that she has coveted\nthe tears of the Caesars themselves. The Emperor Augustus lost his\ndarling sister Octavia, and though Nature destined him for heaven,\nyet she did not relax her laws to spare him from mourning while on\nearth: nay, he suffered every kind of bereavement, {373} losing his\nsister\u2019s son,[6] who was intended to be his heir. In fine, not to\nmention his sorrows in detail, he lost his son-in-law, his children,\nand his grandchildren, and, while he remained among men, no mortal\nwas more often reminded that he was a man. Yet his mind, which was\nable to bear all things, bore all these heavy sorrows, and the\nblessed Augustus was the conqueror, not only of foreign nations,\nbut also of his own sorrows. Gaius Caesar,[7] the grandson of the\nblessed Augustus, my maternal great uncle, in the first years of\nmanhood, when Prince of the Roman Youth, as he was preparing for\nthe Parthian war, lost his darling brother Lucius[8] who was also\n\u2018Prince of the Roman Youth,\u2019 and suffered more thereby in his mind\nthan he did afterwards in his body, though he bore both afflictions\nwith the greatest piety and fortitude. Tiberius Caesar, my paternal\nuncle, lost his younger brother Drusus Germanicus,[9] my father,\nwhen he was opening out the innermost fastnesses of Germany, and\nbringing the fiercest tribes under the dominion of the Roman empire;\nhe embraced him and received his last kiss, but he nevertheless\nrestrained not only his own grief but that of others, and when the\nwhole army, not merely sorrowful but heartbroken, claimed the corpse\nof their Drusus for themselves, he made them grieve only as it\nbecame Romans to grieve, {374} and taught them that they must observe\nmilitary discipline not only in fighting but also in mourning. He\ncould not have checked the tears of others had he not first repressed\nhis own.\nXVI. \u201cMarcus Antonius, my grandfather, who was second to none save\nhis conqueror, received the news of his brother\u2019s execution at the\nvery time when the state was at his disposal, and when, as a member\nof the triumvirate, he saw no one in the world superior to himself\nin power, nay, when, with the exception of his two colleagues, every\nman was subordinate to himself. O wanton Fortune, what sport you\nmake for yourself out of human sorrows! At the very time when Marcus\nAntonius was enthroned with power of life and death over his\ncountrymen, Marcus Antonius\u2019s brother was being led to his death:\nyet Antonius bore this cruel wound with the same greatness of mind\nwith which he had endured all his other crosses; and he mourned for\nhis brother by offering the blood of twenty legions to his manes.\nHowever, to pass by all other instances, not to speak of the other\ndeaths which have occurred in my own house. Fortune has twice\nassailed me through the death of a brother; she has twice learned\nthat she could wound me but could not overthrow me. I lost my brother\nGermanicus, whom I loved in a manner which any one will understand\nif he thinks how affectionate brothers love one another; yet I so\nrestrained my passion of grief as neither to leave undone anything\nwhich a good brother could be called upon to do, nor yet to do\nanything which a sovereign could be blamed for doing.\u201d\nThink, then, that our common parent quotes these instances to you,\nand that he points out to you how nothing is respected or held\ninviolable by Fortune, who actually dares to send out funeral\nprocessions from the very house in which she will have to look for\ngods: so let no one be surprised at her committing any act of cruelty\n{375} or injustice; for how could she show any humanity or moderation\nin her dealings with private families, when her pitiless fury has\nso often hung the very throne[10] itself with black? She will not\nchange her habits even though reproached, not by my voice alone,\nbut by that of the entire nation: she will hold on her course in\nspite of all prayers and complaints. Such has Fortune always been,\nand such she ever will be in connexion with human affairs: she has\nnever shrunk from attacking anything, and she will never let anything\nalone: she will rage everywhere terribly, as she has always been\nwont to do: she will dare to enter for evil purposes into those\nhouses whose entrance lies through the temples of the gods, and\nwill hang signs of mourning upon laurelled door-posts. However, if\nshe has not yet determined to destroy the human race: if she still\nlooks with favour upon the Roman nation, may our public and private\nprayers prevail upon her to regard as sacred from her violence this\nprince, whom all men think to be sacred, who has been granted them\nby heaven to give them rest after their misfortunes: let her learn\nclemency from him, and let the mildest of all sovereigns teach her\nmildness.\nXVII. You ought, therefore, to fix your eyes upon all the persons\nwhom I have just mentioned, who have either been deified or were\nnearly related to those who have been deified, and when Fortune\nlays her hands upon you to bear it calmly, seeing that she does not\neven respect those by whose names we swear. It is your duty to\nimitate their constancy in enduring and triumphing over suffering,\nas far as it is permitted to a mere man to follow in the footsteps\nof the immortals. Albeit in all other matters rank and birth make\ngreat distinctions between men, yet virtue is open to all; she\ndespises no one provided he thinks himself {376} worthy to possess\nher. Surely you cannot do better than follow the example of those\nwho, though they might have been angry at not being exempt from\nthis evil, nevertheless have decided to regard this, the only thing\nwhich brings them down to the level of other men, not as a wrong\ndone to themselves, but as the law of our mortal nature, and to\nbear what befals them without undue bitterness and wrath, and yet\nin no base or cowardly spirit: for it is not human not to feel our\nsorrows, while it is unmanly not to bear them. When I glance through\nthe roll of all the Caesars whom fate has bereaved of sisters or\nbrothers, I cannot pass over that one who is unworthy to figure on\nthe list of Caesars, whom Nature produced to be the ruin and the\nshame of the human race, who utterly wrecked and destroyed the state\nwhich is now recovering under the gentle rule of the most benign\nof princes. On losing his sister Drusilla, Gaius Caesar, a man who\ncould neither mourn nor rejoice as becomes a prince, shrank from\nseeing and speaking to his countrymen, was not present at his\nsister\u2019s funeral, did not pay her the conventional tribute of\nrespect, but tried to forget the sorrows caused by this most\ndistressing death by playing at dice in his Alban villa, and by\nsitting on the judgment-seat, and the like customary engagements.\nWhat a disgrace to the Empire! a Roman emperor solaced himself by\ngambling for his grief at the loss of his sister! This same Gaius,\nwith frantic levity, at one time let his beard and hair grow long,\nat another wandered aimlessly along the coast of Italy and Sicily.\nHe never clearly made up his mind whether he wished his sister to\nbe mourned for or to be worshipped, and during all the time that\nhe was raising temples and shrines[11] in her honour he punished\nthose who did not manifest sufficient {377} sorrow with the most\ncruel tortures:[12] for his mind was so ill-balanced, that he was\nas much cast down by adversity as he was unbecomingly elated and\npuffed up by success. Far be it from every Roman to follow such an\nexample, either to divert his mind from his grief by unreasonable\namusements, to stimulate it by unseemly squalor and neglect, or to\nbe so inhuman as to console himself by taking pleasure in the\nsufferings of others.\nXVIII. You, however, need change none of your ordinary habits, since\nyou have taught yourself to love those studies which, while they\nare pre-eminently fitted for perfecting our happiness, at the same\ntime teach us how we may bear misfortune most lightly, and which\nare at the same time a man\u2019s greatest honour and greatest comfort.\nNow, therefore, immerse yourself even more deeply in your studies,\nnow surround your mind with them like fortifications, so that grief\nmay not find any place at which it can gain entrance. At the same\ntime, prolong the remembrance of your brother by inserting some\nmemoir of him among your other writings: for that is the only sort\nof monument that can be erected by man which no storm can injure,\nno time destroy. The others, which consist of piles of stone, masses\nof marble, or huge mounds of earth heaped on high, cannot preserve\nhis memory for long, because they themselves perish; but the memorials\nwhich genius raises are everlasting. Lavish these upon your brother,\nembalm him in these: you will do better to immortalise him by an\neverlasting work of genius than to mourn over him with useless\ngrief. As for Fortune herself, although I cannot just now {378}\nplead her cause before you, because all that she has given us is\nnow hateful to you, because she has taken something away from you,\nyet I will plead her cause as soon as time shall have rendered you\na more impartial judge of her action: indeed she has bestowed much\nupon you to make amends for the injury which she has done you, and\nshe will give more hereafter by way of atonement for it: and, after\nall, it was she herself who gave you this brother whom she has taken\naway. Forbear, then, to display your abilities against your own\nself, or to take part with your grief against yourself: your\neloquence, can, no doubt, make trifles appear great, and, conversely,\ncan disparage and depreciate great things until they seem the merest\ntrifles; but let it reserve those powers and use them on some other\nsubject, and at the present time devote its entire strength to the\ntask of consoling you. Yet see whether even this task be not\nunnecessary. Nature demands from us a certain amount of grief, our\nimagination adds some more to it; but I will never forbid you to\nmourn at all. I know, indeed, that there are some men, whose wisdom\nis of a harsh rather than a brave character, who say that the wise\nman never would mourn. It seems to me that they never can have been\nin the position of mourners, for otherwise their misfortune would\nhave shaken all their haughty philosophy out of them, and, however\nmuch against their will, would have forced them to confess their\nsorrow. Reason will have done enough if she does but cut off from\nour grief all that is superfluous and useless: as for her not\nallowing us to grieve at all, that we ought neither to expect nor\nto wish for. Let her rather restrain us within the bounds of a\nchastened grief, which partakes neither of indifference nor of\nmadness, and let her keep our minds in that attitude which becomes\naffection without excitement: let your tears flow, but let them\nsome day cease to flow: groan as deeply as you will, but let your\n{379} groans cease some day: regulate your conduct so that both\nphilosophers and brothers may approve of it. Make yourself feel\npleasure in often thinking about your brother, talk constantly about\nhim, and keep him ever present in your memory; which you cannot\nsucceed in doing unless you make the remembrance of him pleasant\nrather than sad: for it is but natural that the mind should shrink\nfrom a subject which it cannot contemplate without sadness. Think\nof his retiring disposition, of his abilities for business, his\ndiligence in carrying it out, his loyalty to his word. Tell other\nmen of all his sayings and doings, and remind your own self of them:\nthink how good he was and how great you hoped he might become: for\nwhat success is there which you might not safely have wagered that\nsuch a brother would win?\nI have thrown together these reflexions in the best way that I\ncould, for my mind is dimmed and stupefied with the tedium of my\nlong exile: if, therefore, you should find them unworthy of the\nconsideration of a person of your intelligence, or unable to console\nyou in your grief, remember how impossible it is for one who is\nfull of his own sorrows to find time to minister to those of others,\nand how hard it is to express oneself in the Latin language, when\nall around one hears nothing but a rude foreign jargon, which even\nbarbarians of the more civilised sort regard with disgust.\n[1] \u201cThe Latins had four versions of Homer (Fabric, tom. i. 1. ii.\nch. 3, p. 297), yet, in spite of the phraises of Seneca, Consol,\nch. 26 (viii.), they appear to have been more successful in imitating\nthan in translating the Greek poets.\u201d\u2014Gibbon\u2019s \u201cDecline and Fall,\u201d\nch. 41, ad init., note. Polybius had made a prose translation of\nHomer, and a prose paraphrase of Virgil.\n[2] See note _ante_, ch. viii.\n[3] \u201cFortune hath parted stakes with thee, in taking away thy\nbrother, and leaving thee all the rest in securitie and safetie.\u201d\u2014Lodge.\n[4] See \u201cOn Benefits,\u201d v. 16.\n[5] Scipio Africanus minor, the son of Paulus Aemilius.\n[6] Marcellus. See \u201cVirgil\u2019s well-known lines, Aen. VI., 869, _sqq_.,\nand \u201cConsolatio ad Marciam,\u201d 2.\n[7] G. Caesar, d. at Limyra, a.d. 4.\n[8] Lucius Caesar, d. at Marseilles, A.D. 2.\n[9] Drusus died by a fall from his horse, B.C. 9. \u201cA monument was\nerected in his honour at Moguntiacum (Mayence), and games and\nmilitary spectacles were exhibited there on the anniversary of his\ndeath. An altar had already been raised in his honour on the banks\nof the Lippe.\u201d Tac. Ann. ii. 7. \u201cThe soldiers began now to regard\nthemselves as a distinct people, with rites and heroes of their\nown. Augustus required them to surrender the body of their beloved\nchief as a matter of discipline.\u201d Merivale, ch. 36.\n[10] _Pulvinaria_. See note, ch. xvii.\n[11] _Pulvinaria_. This word properly means \u201ca couch made of cushions,\nand spread over with a splendid covering, for the gods or persons\nwho received divine honours.\u201d\n[12] Merivale, following Suetonius and Dion Cassius, says: \u201cHe\ndeclared that if any man dared to mourn for his sister\u2019s death, he\nshould be punished, for she had become a goddess: if any one ventured\nto rejoice at her deification, he should be punished also, for she\nwas dead.\u201d The passage in the text, he remarks, gives a less\nextravagant turn to the story.\n{380}\nTHE FIRST BOOK OF THE DIALOGUE OF L. ANNAEUS SENECA, ADDRESSED TO\nNERO CAESAR.\nON CLEMENCY.\nI. I have determined to write a book upon clemency, Nero Caesar,\nin order that I may as it were serve as a mirror to you, and let\nyou see yourself arriving at the greatest of all pleasures. For\nalthough the true enjoyment of good deeds consists in the performance\nof them, and virtues have no adequate reward beyond themselves,\nstill it is worth your while to consider and investigate a good\nconscience from every point of view, and afterwards to cast your\neyes upon this enormous mass of mankind\u2014 quarrelsome, factious, and\npassionate as they are; likely, if they could throw off the yoke\nof your government, to take pleasure alike in the ruin of themselves\nand of one another \u2014and thus to commune with yourself:\u2014\u201cHave I of\nall mankind been chosen and thought fit to perform the office of a\ngod upon earth? I am the arbiter of life and death to mankind: it\nrests with me to decide what lot and position in life each man\npossesses: fortune makes use of my mouth to announce what she bestows\non each man: cities and nations are moved to joy by my words: no\nregion {381} anywhere can flourish without my favour and good will:\nall these thousands of swords now restrained by my authority, would\nbe drawn at a sign from me: it rests with me to decide which tribes\nshall be utterly exterminated, which shall be moved into other\nlands, which shall receive and which shall be deprived of liberty,\nwhat kings shall be reduced to slavery and whose heads shall be\ncrowned, what cities shall be destroyed and what new ones shall be\nfounded. In this position of enormous power I am not tempted to\npunish men unjustly by anger, by youthful impulse, by the recklessness\nand insolence of men, which often overcomes the patience even of\nthe best regulated minds, not even that terrible vanity, so common\namong great sovereigns, of displaying my power by inspiring terror.\nMy sword is sheathed, nay, fixed in its sheath: I am sparing of the\nblood even of the lowest of my subjects: a man who has nothing else\nto recommend him, will nevertheless find favour in my eyes because\nhe is a man. I keep harshness concealed, but I have clemency always\nat hand: I watch myself as carefully as though I had to give an\naccount of my actions to those laws which I have brought out of\ndarkness and neglect into the light of day. I have been moved to\ncompassion by the youth of one culprit, and the age of another: I\nhave spared one man because of his great place, another on account\nof his insignificance: when I could find no reason for showing\nmercy, I have had mercy upon myself. I am prepared this day, should\nthe gods demand it, to render to them an account of the human race.\u201d\nYou, Caesar, can boldly say that everything which has come into\nyour charge has been kept safe, and that the state has neither\nopenly nor secretly suffered any loss at your hands. You have coveted\na glory which is most rare, and which has been obtained by no emperor\nbefore you, that of innocence. Your remarkable goodness is not\nthrown away, nor is it ungratefully or spitefully undervalued. Men\nfeel {382} gratitude towards you: no one person ever was so dear\nto another as you are to the people of Rome, whose great and enduring\nbenefit you are. You have, however, taken upon yourself a mighty\nburden: no one any longer speaks of the good times of the late\nEmperor Augustus, or the first years of the reign of Tiberius, or\nproposes for your imitation any model outside yourself: yours is a\npattern reign. This would have been difficult had your goodness of\nheart not been innate, but merely adopted for a time; for no one\ncan wear a mask for long, and fictitious qualities soon give place\nto true ones. Those which are founded upon truth, and which, so to\nspeak, grow out of a solid basis, only become greater and better\nas time goes on. The Roman people were in a state of great hazard\nas long as it was uncertain how your generous[1] disposition would\nturn out; now, however, the prayers of the community are sure of\nan answer, for there is no fear that you should suddenly forget\nyour own character. Indeed, excess of happiness makes men greedy,\nand our desires are never so moderate as to be bounded by what they\nhave obtained: great successes become the stepping-stones to greater\nones, and those who have obtained more than they hoped, entertain\neven more extravagant hopes than before; yet by all your countrymen\nwe hear it admitted that they are now happy, and moreover, that\nnothing can be added to the blessings that they enjoy, except that\nthey should be eternal. Many circumstances force this admission\nfrom them, although it is the one which men are least willing to\nmake: we enjoy a profound and prosperous peace, the power of the\nlaw has been openly asserted in the sight of all men, and raised\nbeyond the reach of any violent interference: the form of our\ngovernment is so happy, as to contain all the essentials of liberty\nexcept the power of destroying itself. It is {383} nevertheless\nyour clemency which is most especially admired by the high and low\nalike: every man enjoys or hopes to enjoy the other blessings of\nyour rule according to the measure of his own personal good fortune,\nwhereas from your clemency all hope alike: no one has so much\nconfidence in his own innocence, as not to feel glad that in your\npresence stands a clemency which is ready to make allowance for\nhuman errors.\nII. I know, however, that there are some who imagine that clemency\nonly saves the life of every villain, because clemency is useless\nexcept after conviction, and alone of all the virtues has no function\namong the innocent. But in the first place, although a physician\nis only useful to the sick, yet he is held in honour among the\nhealthy also; and so clemency, though she be invoked by those who\ndeserve punishment, is respected by innocent people as well. Next,\nshe can exist also in the person of the innocent, because sometimes\nmisfortune takes the place of crime; indeed, clemency not only\nsuccours the innocent, but often the virtuous, since in the course\nof time it happens that men are punished for actions which deserve\npraise. Besides this, there is a large part of mankind which might\nreturn to virtue if the hope of pardon were not denied them. Yet\nit is not right to pardon indiscriminately; for when no distinction\nis made between good and bad men, disorder follows, and all vices\nbreak forth; we must therefore take care to distinguish those\ncharacters which admit of reform from those which are hopelessly\ndepraved. Neither ought we to show an indiscriminate and general,\nnor yet an exclusive clemency; for to pardon every one is as great\ncruelty as to pardon none; we must take a middle course; but as it\nis difficult to find the true mean, let us be careful, if we depart\nfrom it, to do so upon the side of humanity.\nIII. But these matters will be treated of better in their own place.\nI will now divide this whole subject into {384} three parts. The\nfirst will be of gentleness of temper:[2] the second will be that\nwhich explains the nature and disposition of clemency; for since\nthere are certain vices which have the semblance of virtue, they\ncannot be separated unless you stamp upon them the marks which\ndistinguish them from one another: in the third place we shall\ninquire how the mind may be led to practise this virtue, how it may\nstrengthen it, and by habit make it its own.\nThat clemency, which is the most humane of virtues, is that which\nbest befits a man, is necessarily an axiom, not only among our own\nsect, which regards man as a social animal, born for the good of\nthe whole community, but even among those philosophers who give him\nup entirely to pleasure, and whose words and actions have no other\naim than their own personal advantage. If man, as they argue, seeks\nfor quiet and repose, what virtue is there which is more agreeable\nto his nature than clemency, which loves peace and restrains him\nfrom violence? Now clemency becomes no one more than a king or a\nprince; for great power is glorious and admirable only when it is\nbeneficent; since to be powerful only for mischief is the power of\na pestilence. That man\u2019s greatness alone rests upon a secure\nfoundation, whom all men know to be as much on their side as he is\nabove them, of whose watchful care for the safety of each and all\nof them they receive daily proofs, at whose approach they do not\nfly in terror, as though some evil and dangerous animal had sprung\nout from its den, but flock to him as they would to the bright and\nhealth-giving sunshine. They are perfectly ready to fling themselves\nupon the swords of conspirators in his defence, to offer their\nbodies if his only path to safety must be formed of corpses: they\nprotect his sleep by nightly watches, they {385} surround him and\ndefend him on every side, and expose themselves to the dangers which\nmenace him. It is not without good reason that nations and cities\nthus agree in sacrificing their lives and property for the defence\nand the love of their king whenever their leader\u2019s safety demands\nit; men do not hold themselves cheap, nor are they insane when so\nmany thousands are put to the sword for the sake of one man, and\nwhen by so many deaths they save the life of one man alone, who not\nunfrequently is old and feeble. Just as the entire body is commanded\nby the mind, and although the body be so much larger and more\nbeautiful while the mind is impalpable and hidden, and we are not\ncertain as to where it is concealed, yet the hands, feet, and eyes\nwork for it, the skin protects it; at its bidding we either lie\nstill or move restlessly about; when it gives the word, if it be\nan avaricious master, we scour the sea in search of gain, or if it\nbe ambitious we straightway place our right hand in the flames like\nMucius, or leap into the pit like Curtius, so likewise this enormous\nmultitude which surrounds one man is directed by his will, is guided\nby his intellect, and would break and hurl itself into ruin by its\nown strength, if it were not upheld by his wisdom.\nIV. Men therefore love their own safety, when they draw up vast\nlegions in battle on behalf of one man, when they rush to the front,\nand expose their breasts to wounds, for fear that their leader\u2019s\nstandards should be driven back. He is the bond which fastens the\ncommonwealth together, he is the breath of life to all those\nthousands, who by themselves would become merely an encumbrance and\na source of plunder if that directing mind were withdrawn:\u2014\nBees have but one mind, till their king doth die, But when he\ndies, disorderly they fly.\nSuch a misfortune will be the end of the peace of Rome, it will\nwreck the prosperity of this great people; the nation {386} will\nbe free from this danger as long as it knows how to endure the\nreins: should it ever break them, or refuse to have them replaced\nif they were to fall off by accident, then this mighty whole, this\ncomplex fabric of government will fly asunder into many fragments,\nand the last day of Rome\u2019s empire will be that upon which it forgets\nhow to obey. For this reason we need not wonder that princes, kings,\nand all other protectors of a state, whatever their titles may be,\nshould be loved beyond the circle of their immediate relatives; for\nsince right-thinking men prefer the interests of the state to their\nown, it follows that he who bears the burden of state affairs must\nbe dearer to them than their own friends. Indeed, the emperor long\nago identified himself so thoroughly with the state, that neither\nof them could be separated without injury to both, because the one\nrequires power, while the other requires a head.\nV. My argument seems to have wandered somewhat far from the subject,\nbut, by Hercules, it really is very much to the point. For if, as\nwe may infer from what has been said, you are the soul of the state,\nand the state is your body, you will perceive, I imagine, how\nnecessary clemency is; for when you appear to spare another, you\nare really sparing yourself. You ought therefore to spare even\nblameworthy citizens, just as you spare weakly limbs; and when\nblood-letting becomes necessary, you must hold your hand, lest you\nshould cut deeper than you need. Clemency therefore, as I said\nbefore, naturally befits all mankind, but more especially rulers,\nbecause in their case there is more for it to save, and it is\ndisplayed upon a greater scale. Cruelty in a private man can do but\nvery little harm; but the ferocity of princes is war. Although there\nis a harmony between all the virtues, and no one is better or more\nhonourable than another, yet some virtues befit some persons better\nthan {387} others. Magnanimity befits all mortal men, even the\nhumblest of all; for what can be greater or braver than to resist\nill fortune? Yet this virtue of magnanimity occupies a wider room\nin prosperity, and shows to greater advantage on the judgment seat\nthan on the floor of the court. On the other hand, clemency renders\nevery house into which it is admitted happy and peaceful; but though\nit is more rare, it is on that account even more admirable in a\npalace. What can be more remarkable than that he whose anger might\nbe indulged without fear of the consequences, whose decision, even\nthough a harsh one, would be approved even by those who were to\nsuffer by it, whom no one can interrupt, and of whom indeed, should\nhe become violently enraged, no one would dare to beg for mercy,\nshould apply a check to himself and use his power in a better and\ncalmer spirit, reflecting: \u201cAny one may break the law to kill a\nman, no one but I can break it to save him\u201d? A great position\nrequires a great mind, for unless the mind raises itself to and\neven above the level of its station, it will degrade its station\nand draw it down to the earth; now it is the property of a great\nmind to be calm and tranquil and to look down upon outrages and\ninsults with contempt. It is a womanish thing to rage with passion;\nit is the part of wild beasts, and that, too, not of the most noble\nones, to bite and worry the fallen. Elephants and lions pass by\nthose whom they have struck down; inveteracy is the quality of\nignoble animals. Fierce and implacable rage does not befit a king,\nbecause he does not preserve his superiority over the man to whose\nlevel he descends by indulging in rage; but if he grants their lives\nand honours to those who are in jeopardy and who deserve to lose\nthem, he does what can only be done by an absolute ruler; for life\nmay be torn away even from those who are above us in station, but\ncan never be granted save to those who are below us. To save men\u2019s\nlives {388} is the privilege of the loftiest station, which never\ndeserves admiration so much as when it is able to act like the gods,\nby whose kindness good and bad men alike are brought into the world.\nThus a prince, imitating the mind of a god, ought to look with\npleasure on some of his countrymen because they are useful and good\nmen, while he ought to allow others to remain to fill up the roll;\nhe ought to be pleased with the existence of the former, and to\nendure that of the latter.\nVI. Look at this city of Rome, in which the widest streets become\nchoked whenever anything stops the crowds which unceasingly pour\nthrough them like raging torrents, in which the people streaming\nto three theatres demand the roads at the same time, in which the\nproduce of the entire world is consumed, and reflect what a desolate\nwaste it would become if only those were left in it whom a strict\njudge would acquit. How few magistrates are there who ought not to\nbe condemned by the very same laws which they administer? How few\nprosecutors are themselves faultless? I imagine, also, that few men\nare less willing to grant pardon, than those who have often had to\nbeg it for themselves. We have all of us sinned, some more deeply\nthan others, some of set purpose, some either by chance impulse or\nled away by the wickedness of others; some of us have not stood\nbravely enough by our good resolutions, and have lost our innocence,\nalthough unwillingly and after a struggle; nor have we only sinned,\nbut to the very end of our lives we shall continue to sin. Even if\nthere be any one who has so thoroughly cleansed his mind that nothing\ncan hereafter throw him into disorder or deceive him, yet even he\nhas reached this state of innocence through sin.\nVII. Since I have made mention of the gods, I shall state the best\nmodel on which a prince may mould his life to be, that he deal with\nhis countrymen as he would that {389} the gods may deal with himself.\nIs it then desirable that the gods should show no mercy upon sins\nand mistakes, and that they should harshly pursue us to our ruin?\nIn that case what king will be safe? Whose limbs will not be torn\nasunder and collected by the soothsayers? If, on the other hand,\nthe gods are placable and kind, and do not at once avenge the crimes\nof the powerful with thunderbolts, is it not far more just that a\nman set in authority over other men should exercise his power in a\nspirit of clemency and should consider whether the condition of the\nworld is more beauteous and pleasant to the eyes on a fine calm\nday, or when everything is shaken with frequent thunder-claps and\nwhen lightning flashes on all sides! Yet the appearance of a peaceful\nand constitutional reign is the same as that of the calm and brilliant\nsky. A cruel reign is disordered and hidden in darkness, and while\nall shake with terror at the sudden explosions, not even he who\ncaused all this disturbance escapes unharmed. It is easier to find\nexcuses for private men who obstinately claim their rights; possibly\nthey may have been injured, and their rage may spring from their\nwrongs; besides this, they fear to be despised, and not to return\nthe injuries which they have received looks like weakness rather\nthan clemency; but one who can easily avenge himself, if he neglects\nto do so, is certain to gain praise for goodness of heart. Those\nwho are born in a humble station may with greater freedom exercise\nviolence, go to law, engage in quarrels, and indulge their angry\npassions; even blows count for little between two equals; but in\nthe case of a king, even loud clamour and unmeasured talk are\nunbecoming.\nVIII. You think it a serious matter to take away from kings the\nright of free speech which the humblest enjoy. \u201cThis,\u201d you say, \u201cis\nto be a subject, not a king.\u201d What, do you not find that we have\nthe command, you the subjection? {390} Your position is quite\ndifferent to that of those who lie hid in the crowd which they never\nleave, whose very virtues cannot be manifested without a long\nstruggle, and whose vices are shrouded in obscurity; rumour catches\nup your acts and sayings, and therefore no persons ought to be more\ncareful of their reputation than those who are certain to have a\ngreat one, whatsoever one they may have deserved. How many things\nthere are that you may not do which, thanks to you, we may do! I\nam able to walk alone without fear in any part of Rome whatever,\nalthough no companion accompanies me, though there is no guard at\nmy house no sword by my side. You must live armed in the peace which\nyou maintain.[3] You cannot stray away from your position; it besets\nyou, and follows you with mighty pomp wherever you go. This slavery\nof not being able to sink one\u2019s rank belongs to the highest position\nof all; yet it is a burden which you share with the gods. They too\nare held fast in heaven, and it is no more possible for them to\ncome down than it is safe[4] for you; you are chained to your lofty\npinnacle. Of our movements few persons are aware; we can go forth\nand return home and change our dress without its being publicly\nknown; but you are no more able to hide yourself than the sun. A\nstrong light is all around you, the eyes of all are turned towards\nit. Do you think you are leaving your house? nay, you are dawning\nupon the world. You cannot speak without all nations everywhere\nhearing your voice; you cannot be angry, without making everything\ntremble, because you can strike no one without shaking all around\nhim. Just as thunderbolts when they fall endanger few men but terrify\nall, so the chastisement inflicted by great potentates terrify more\nwidely than they injure, and that for good reasons; for in the case\nof one whose power is absolute, men do not think of what he has\ndone, so much as of what he may do. Add to this that {391} private\nmen endure wrongs more tamely, because they have already endured\nothers; the safety of kings on the other hand is more surely founded\non kindness, because frequent punishment may crush the hatred of a\nfew, but excites that of all. A king ought to wish to pardon while\nhe has still grounds for being severe; if he acts otherwise, just\nas lopped trees sprout forth again with numberless boughs, and many\nkinds of crops are cut down in order that they may grow more thickly,\nso a cruel king increases the number of his enemies by destroying\nthem; for the parents and children of those who are put to death,\nand their relatives and friends, step into the place of each victim.\nIX. I wish to prove the truth of this by an example drawn from your\nown family. The late Emperor Augustus was a mild prince, if in\nestimating his character one reckons from the era of his reign; yet\nhe appealed to arms while the state was shared among the triumvirate.\nWhen he was just of your age, at the end of his twenty-second year,\nhe had already hidden daggers under the clothes of his friends, he\nhad already conspired to assassinate Marcus Antonius, the consul,\nhe had already taken part in the proscription. But when he had\npassed his sixtieth[5] year, and was staying in {392} Gaul,\nintelligence was brought to him that Lucius Cinna, a dull man, was\nplotting against him: the plot was betrayed by one of the conspirators,\nwho told him where, when, and in what manner Cinna meant to attack\nhim. Augustus determined to consult his own safety against this\nman, and ordered a council of his own friends to be summoned. He\npassed a disturbed night, reflecting that he would be obliged to\ncondemn to death a youth of noble birth, who was guilty of no crime\nsave this one, and who was the grandson of Gnaeus Pompeius. He, who\nhad sat at dinner and heard M. Antonius[6] read aloud his edict for\nthe proscription, could not now bear to put one single man to death.\nWith groans he kept at intervals making various inconsistent\nexclamations:\u2014\u201cWhat! shall I allow my assassin to walk about at his\nease while I am racked by fears? Shall the man not be punished who\nhas plotted not merely to slay but actually to sacrifice at the\naltar\u201d (for the conspirators intended to attack him when he was\nsacrificing), \u201cnow when there is peace by land and sea, that life\nwhich so many civil wars have sought in vain, which has passed\nunharmed through so many battles of fleets and armies?\u201d\nThen, after an interval of silence, he would say to himself in a\nfar louder, angrier tone than he had used to Cinna, \u201cWhy do you\nlive, if it be to so many men\u2019s advantage that you should die? Is\nthere no end to these executions? to this bloodshed? I am a figure\nset up for nobly-born youths to sharpen their swords on. Is life\nworth having, if so many must perish to prevent my losing it?\u201d At\nlast his wife Livia interrupted him, saying: \u201cWill you take a woman\u2019s\n{393} advice? Do as the physicians do, who, when the usual remedies\nfail, try their opposites. Hitherto you have gained nothing by harsh\nmeasures: Salvidienus has been followed by Lepidus, Lepidus by\nMuraena, Muraena by Caepio, and Caepio by Egnatius, not to mention\nothers of whom one feels ashamed of their having dared to attempt\nso great a deed. Now try what effect clemency will have: pardon\nLucius Cinna. He has been detected, he cannot now do you any harm,\nand he can do your reputation much good.\u201d Delighted at finding some\none to support his own view of the case, he thanked his wife,\nstraightway ordered his friends, whose counsel he had asked for,\nto be told that he did not require their advice, and summoned Cinna\nalone. After ordering a second seat to be placed for Cinna, he sent\nevery one else out of the room, and said:\u2014\u201cThe first request which\nI have to make of you is, that you will not interrupt me while I\nam speaking to you: that you will not cry out in the middle of my\naddress to you: you shall be allowed time to speak freely in answer\nto me. Cinna, when I found you in the enemy\u2019s camp, you who had not\nbecome but were actually born my enemy, I saved your life, and\nrestored to you the whole of your father\u2019s estate. You are now so\nprosperous and so rich, that many of the victorious party envy you,\nthe vanquished one: when you were a candidate for the priesthood I\npassed over many others whose parents had served with me in the\nwars, and gave it to you: and now, after I have deserved so well\nof you, you have made up your mind to kill me.\u201d When at this word\nthe man exclaimed that he was far from being so insane, Augustus\nreplied, \u201cYou do not keep your promise, Cinna; it was agreed upon\nbetween us that you should not interrupt me. I repeat, you are\npreparing to kill me.\u201d He then proceeded to tell him of the place,\nthe names of his accomplices, the day, the way in which they had\narranged to do the deed, and which of them was to give the fatal\nstab. {394} When he saw Cinna\u2019s eyes fixed upon the ground, and\nthat he was silent, no longer because of the agreement, but from\nconsciousness of his guilt, he said, \u201cWhat is your intention in\ndoing this? is it that you yourself may be emperor? The Roman people\nmust indeed be in a bad way if nothing but my life prevents your\nruling over them. You cannot even maintain the dignity of your own\nhouse: you have recently been defeated in a legal encounter by the\nsuperior influence of a freedman: and so you can find no easier\ntask than to call your friends to rally round you against Caesar.\nCome, now, if you think that I alone stand in the way of your\nambition; will Paulus and Fabius Maximus, will the Cossi and the\nServilii and all that band of nobles, whose names are no empty\npretence, but whose ancestry really renders them illustrious\u2014will\nthey endure that you should rule over them?\u201d Not to fill up the\ngreater part of this book by repeating the whole of his speech\u2014for\nhe is known to have spoken for more than two hours, lengthening out\nthis punishment, which was the only one which he intended to\ninflict\u2014he said at last: \u201cCinna, I grant you your life for the\nsecond time: when I gave it you before you were an open enemy, you\nare now a secret plotter and parricide.[7] From this day forth let\nus be friends: let us try which of us is the more sincere, I in\ngiving you your life, or you in owing your life to me.\u201d After this\nhe of his own accord bestowed the consulship upon him, complaining\nof his not venturing to offer himself as a candidate for that office,\nand found him ever afterwards his most grateful and loyal adherent.\nCinna made the emperor his sole heir, and no one ever again formed\nany plot against him.\nX. Your great-great-grandfather spared the vanquished: for whom\ncould he have ruled over, had he not spared them? He recruited\nSallustius, the Cocoeii, the Deillii, and the whole {395} inner\ncircle of his court from the camp of his opponents. Soon afterwards\nhis clemency gave him a Domitius, a Messala, an Asinius, a Cicero,\nand all the flower of the state. For what a long time he waited for\nLepidus to die: for years he allowed him to retain all the insignia\nof royalty, and did not allow the office of pontifex maximus to be\nconferred upon himself until after Lepidus\u2019s death; for he wished\nit to be called a honourable office rather than a spoil stripped\nfrom a vanquished foe. It was this clemency which made him end his\ndays in safety and security: this it was which rendered him popular\nand beloved, although he had laid his hands on the neck of the\nRomans when they were still unused to bearing the yoke: this gives\nhim even at the present day a reputation such as hardly any prince\nhas enjoyed during his own lifetime. We believe him to be a god,\nand not merely because we are bidden to do so. We declare that\nAugustus was a good emperor, and that he was well worthy to bear\nhis parent\u2019s name, for no other reason than because he did not even\nshow cruelty in avenging personal insults, which most princes feel\nmore keenly than actual injuries; because he smiled at scandalous\njests against himself, because it was evident that he himself\nsuffered when he punished others, because he was so far from putting\nto death even those whom he had convicted of intriguing with his\ndaughter, that when they were banished he gave them passports to\nenable them to travel more safely. When you know that there will\nbe many who will take your quarrel upon themselves, and will try\nto gain your favour by the murder of your enemies, you do indeed\npardon them if you not only grant them their lives but ensure that\nthey shall not lose them.\nXI. Such was Augustus when an old man, or when growing old: in his\nyouth he was hasty and passionate, and did many things upon which\nhe looked back with regret. No one will venture to compare the rule\nof the {396} blessed Augustus to the mildness of your own, even if\nyour youth be compared with his more than ripe old age: he was\ngentle and placable, but it was after he had dyed the sea at Actium\nwith Roman blood; after he had wrecked both the enemy\u2019s fleet and\nhis own at Sicily; after the holocaust of Perusia and the proscriptions.\nBut I do not call it clemency to be wearied of cruelty; true clemency,\nCaesar, is that which you display, which has not begun from remorse\nat its past ferocity, on which there is no stain, which has never\nshed the blood of your countrymen: this, when combined with unlimited\npower, shows the truest self-control and all-embracing love of the\nhuman race as of one\u2019s self, not corrupted by any low desires, any\nextravagant ideas, or any of the bad examples of former emperors\ninto trying, by actual experiment, how great a tyranny you would\nbe allowed to exercise over his countrymen, but inclining rather\nto blunting your sword of empire. You, Caesar, have granted us the\nboon of keeping our state free from bloodshed, and that of which\nyou boast, that you have not caused one single drop of blood to\nflow in any part of the world, is all the more magnanimous and\nmarvellous because no one ever had the power of the sword placed\nin his hands at an earlier age. Clemency, then, makes princes safer\nas well as more respected, and is a glory to empires besides being\ntheir most trustworthy means of preservation. Why have legitimate\nsovereigns grown old on the throne, and bequeathed their power to\ntheir children and grandchildren, while the sway of despotic usurpers\nis both hateful and shortlived l? What is the difference between\nthe tyrant and the king\u2014for their outward symbols of authority and\ntheir powers are the same\u2014except it be that tyrants take delight\nin cruelty, whereas kings are only cruel for good reasons and because\nthey cannot help it.[8]\n{397}\nXII. \u201cWhat, then,\u201d say you, \u201cdo not kings also put men to death?\u201d\nThey do, but only when that measure is recommended by the public\nadvantage: tyrants enjoy cruelty. A tyrant differs from a king in\ndeeds, not in title: for the elder Dionysius deserves to be preferred\nbefore many kings, and what can prevent our styling Lucius Sulla a\ntyrant, since he only left off slaying because he had no more enemies\nto slay? Although he laid down his dictatorship and resumed the\ngarb of a private citizen, yet what tyrant ever drank human blood\nas greedily as he, who ordered seven thousand Roman citizens to be\nbutchered, and who, on hearing the shrieks of so many thousands\nbeing put to the sword as he sat in the temple of Bellona, said to\nthe terror-stricken Senate, \u201cLet us attend to our business, Conscript\nFathers; it is only a few disturbers of the public peace who are\nbeing put to death by my orders.\u201d In saying this he did not lie:\nthey really seemed few to Sulla. But we shall speak of Sulla\npresently, when we consider how we ought to feel anger against our\nenemies, at any rate when our own countrymen, members of the same\ncommunity as ourselves, have been torn away from it and assumed the\nname of enemies: in the meanwhile, as I was saying, clemency is\nwhat makes the great distinction between kings and tyrants. Though\neach of them may be equally fenced around by armed soldiers,\nnevertheless the one uses his troops to safeguard the peace of his\nkingdom, the other uses them to quell great hatred by great terror:\nand yet he does not look with any confidence upon those to whose\nhands he entrusts himself. He is driven in opposite directions by\nconflicting passions: for since he is hated because he is feared,\nhe wishes to be feared because he is {398} hated: and he acts up\nto the spirit of that odious verse, which has cast so many headlong\nfrom their thrones\u2014\n\u201cWhy, let them hate me, if they fear me too!\u201d\u2014\nnot knowing how frantic men become when their hatred becomes\nexcessive: for a moderate amount of fear restrains men, but a\nconstant and keen apprehension of the worst tortures rouses up even\nthe most grovelling spirits to deeds of reckless courage, and causes\nthem to hesitate at nothing. Just so a string stuck full of feathers[9]\nwill prevent wild beasts escaping: but should a horseman begin to\nshoot at them from another quarter, they will attempt to escape\nover the very thing that scared them, and will trample the cause\nof their alarm underfoot. No courage is so great as that which is\nborn of utter desperation. In order to keep people down by terror,\nyou must grant them a certain amount of security, and let them see\nthat they have far more to hope for than to fear: for otherwise,\nif a man is in equal peril whether he sits still or takes action,\nhe will feel actual pleasure in risking his life, and will fling\nit away as lightly as though it were not his own.\nXIII. A calm and peaceful king trusts his guards, because he makes\nuse of them to ensure the common safety of all his subjects, and\nhis soldiers, who see that the security of the state depends upon\ntheir labours, cheerfully undergo the severest toil and glory in\nbeing the protectors of the father of their country: whereas your\nharsh and murderous tyrant must needs be disliked even by his own\njanissaries. No man can expect willing and loyal service from those\nwhom he uses like the rack and the axe, as instruments of torture\nand death, to whom he casts men as he would cast them to wild beasts.\nNo prisoner at the bar is so full of agony and anxiety as a tyrant;\nfor while he dreads both gods and men because they have witnessed,\n{399} and will avenge his crimes, he has at the same time so far\ncommitted himself to this course of action that he is not able to\nalter it. This is perhaps the very worst quality of cruelty: a man\nmust go on exercising it, and it is impossible for him to retrace\nhis steps and start in a better path; for crimes must be safeguarded\nby fresh crimes. Yet who can be more unhappy than he who is actually\ncompelled to be a villain? How greatly he ought to be pitied: I\nmean, by himself, for it would be impious for others to pity a man\nwho has made use of his power to murder and ravage, who has rendered\nhimself mistrusted by every one at home and abroad, who fears the\nvery soldiers to whom he flees for safety, who dare not rely upon\nthe loyalty of his friends or the affection of his children: who,\nwhenever he considers what he has done, and what he is about to do,\nand calls to mind all the crimes and torturings with which his\nconscience is burdened, must often fear death, and yet must often\nwish for it, for he must be even more hateful to himself than he\nis to his subjects. On the other hand, he who takes an interest in\nthe entire state, who watches over every department of it with more\nor less care, who attends to all the business of the state as well\nas if it were his own, who is naturally inclined to mild measures,\nand shows, even when it is to his advantage to punish, how unwilling\nhe is to make use of harsh remedies; who has no angry or savage\nfeelings, but wields his authority calmly and beneficially, being\nanxious that even his subordinate officers shall be popular with\nhis countrymen, who thinks his happiness complete if he can make\nthe nation share his prosperity, who is courteous in language, whose\npresence is easy of access, who looks obligingly upon his subjects,\nwho is disposed to grant all their reasonable wishes, and does not\ntreat their unreasonable wishes with harshness\u2014such a prince is\nloved, protected, and worshipped by his whole empire. Men talk of\nsuch a one in private in the same {400} words which they use in\npublic: they are eager to bring up families under his reign, and\nthey put an end to the childlessness which public misery had\npreviously rendered general: every one feels that he will indeed\ndeserve that his children should be grateful to him for having\nbrought them into so happy an age. Such a prince is rendered safe\nby his own beneficence; he has no need of guards, their arms serve\nhim merely as decorations.\nXIV. What, then, is his duty? It is that of good parents, who\nsometimes scold their children goodnaturedly, sometimes threaten\nthem, and sometimes even flog them. No man in his senses disinherits\nhis son for his first offence: he does not pass this extreme sentence\nupon him unless his patience has been worn out by many grievous\nwrongs, unless he fears that his son will do something worse than\nthat which he punishes him for having done; before doing this he\nmakes many attempts to lead his son\u2019s mind into the right way while\nit is still hesitating between good and evil and has only taken its\nfirst steps in depravity; it is only when its case is hopeless that\nhe adopts this extreme measure. No one demands that people should\nbe executed until after he has failed to reform them. This which\nis the duty of a parent, is also that of the prince whom with no\nunmeaning flattery we call \u201cThe Father of our Country.\u201d Other names\nare given as titles of honour: we have styled some men \u201cThe Great,\u201d\n\u201cThe Fortunate,\u201d or \u201cThe August,\u201d and have thus satisfied their\npassion for grandeur by bestowing upon them all the dignity that\nwe could: but when we style a man \u201cThe Father of his Country\u201d we\ngive him to understand that we have entrusted him with a father\u2019s\npower over us, which is of the mildest character, for a father takes\nthought for his children and subordinates his own interests to\ntheirs. It is long before a father will cut off a member of his own\nbody: even after he has cut it off he longs to replace it, and in\ncutting it off he laments {401} and hesitates much and long: for\nhe who condemns quickly is not far from being willing to condemn;\nand he who inflicts too great punishment comes very near to punishing\nunjustly.\nXV. Within my own recollection the people stabbed in the forum with\ntheir writing-styles a Roman knight named Tricho, because he had\nflogged his son to death: even the authority of Augustus Caesar\ncould hardly save him from the angry clutches of both fathers and\nsons: but every one admired Tarius, who, on discovering that his\nson meditated parricide, tried him, convicted him, and was then\nsatisfied with punishing him by exile, and that, too, to that\npleasant place of exile, Marseilles, where he made him the same\nyearly allowance which he had done while he was innocent: the result\nof this generosity was that even in a city where every villain finds\nsome one to defend him, no one doubted that he was justly condemned,\nsince even the father who was unable to hate him, nevertheless had\ncondemned him. In this very same instance I will give you an example\nof a good prince, which you may compare with a good father. Tarius,\nwhen about to sit in judgement on his son, invited Augustus Caesar\nto assist in trying him: Augustus came into his private house, sat\nbeside the father, took part in another man\u2019s family council, and\ndid not say, \u201cNay, let him rather come to my house,\u201d because if he\nhad done so, the trial would have been conducted by Caesar and not\nby the father. When the cause had been heard, after all that the\nyoung man pleaded in his own defence and all that was alleged against\nhim had been thoroughly discussed, the emperor begged that each man\nwould write his sentence (instead of pronouncing it aloud), in order\nthat they might not all follow Caesar in giving sentence: then,\nbefore the tablets were opened, he declared that if Tarius, who was\na rich man, made him his heir, he would not accept the bequest. One\nmight say \u201cIt showed a paltry mind in him {402} to fear that people\nwould think that he condemned the son in order to enable himself\nto inherit the estate.\u201d I am of a contrary opinion\u2014any one of us\nought to have sufficient trust in the consciousness of his own\nintegrity to defend him against calumny, but princes must take great\npains to avoid even the appearance of evil. He swore that he would\nnot accept the property. On that day Tarius lost two heirs to his\nestate, but Caesar gained the liberty of forming an unbiassed\njudgement: and when he had proved that his severity was disinterested,\na point of which a prince should never lose sight, he gave sentence\nthat the son should be banished to whatever place the father might\nchoose. He did not sentence him to the sack and the snakes, or to\nprison, because he thought, not of who it was upon whom he was\npassing sentence, but of who it was with whom he was sitting in\njudgement: he said that a father ought to be satisfied with the\nmildest form of punishment for his stripling son, who had been\nseduced into a crime which he had attempted so faintheartedly as\nto be almost innocent of it, and that he ought to be removed from\nRome and out of his father\u2019s sight.\nXVI. How worthy was he to be invited by fathers to join their family\ncouncils: how worthy to be made co-heir with innocent children!\nThis is the sort of clemency which befits a prince; wherever he\ngoes, let him make every one more charitable. In the king\u2019s sight,\nno one ought to be so despicable that he should not notice whether\nhe lives or dies: be his character what it may, he is a part of the\nempire. Let us take examples for great kingdoms from smaller ones.\nThere are many forms of royalty: a prince reigns over his subjects,\na father over his children, a teacher over his scholars, a tribune\nor centurion over his soldiers. Would not he, who constantly punished\nhis children by beating them for the most trifling faults, be thought\nthe worst of fathers? Which is worthier to impart {403} a liberal\neducation: he who flays his scholars alive if their memory be weak,\nor if their eyes do not run quickly along the lines as they read,\nor he who prefers to improve and instruct them by kindly warnings\nand moral influence? If a tribune or a centurion is harsh, he will\nmake men deserters, and one cannot blame them for desertion. It is\nnever right to rule a human being more harshly and cruelly than we\nrule dumb animals; yet a skilled horse-breaker will not scare a\nhorse by frequent blows, because he will become timid and vicious\nif you do not soothe him with pats and caresses. So also a huntsman,\nboth when he is teaching puppies to follow the tracks of wild\nanimals, and when he uses dogs already trained to drive them from\ntheir lairs and hunt them, does not often threaten to beat them,\nfor, if he does, he will break their spirit, and make them stupid\nand currish with fear; though, on the other hand, he will not allow\nthem to roam and range about unrestrained. The same is the case\nwith those who drive the slower draught cattle, which, though brutal\ntreatment and wretchedness is their lot from their birth, still,\nby excessive cruelty may be made to refuse to draw.\nXVII. No creature is more self-willed, requires more careful\nmanagement, or ought to be treated with greater indulgence than\nman. What, indeed, can be more foolish than that we should blush\nto show anger against dogs or beasts of burden, and yet wish one\nman to be most abominably ill-treated by another? We are not angry\nwith diseases, but apply remedies to them: but this also is a disease\nof the mind, and requires soothing medicine and a physician who is\nanything but angry with his patient. It is the part of a bad physician\nto despair of effecting a cure: he, to whom the care of all men\u2019s\nwell-being is entrusted, ought to act like a good physician, and\nnot be in a hurry to give up hope or to declare that the symptoms\nare mortal: he should wrestle with vices, withstand them, reproach\n{404} some with their distemper, and deceive others by a soothing\nmode of treatment, because he will cure his patient more quickly\nand more thoroughly if the medicines which he administers escape\nhis notice: a prince should take care not only of the recovery of\nhis people, but also that their scars should be honourable. Cruel\npunishments do a king no honour: for who doubts that he is able to\ninflict them? but, on the other hand, it does him great honour to\nrestrain his powers, to save many from the wrath of others, and\nsacrifice no one to his own.\nXVIII. It is creditable to a man to keep within reasonable bounds\nin his treatment of his slaves. Even in the case of a human chattel\none ought to consider, not how much one can torture him with impunity,\nbut how far such treatment is permitted by natural goodness and\njustice, which prompts us to act kindly towards even prisoners of\nwar and slaves bought for a price (how much more towards free-born,\nrespectable gentlemen?), and not to treat them with scornful brutality\nas human chattels, but as persons somewhat below ourselves in\nstation, who have been placed under our protection rather than\nassigned to us as servants. Slaves are allowed to run and take\nsanctuary at the statue of a god, though the laws allows a slave\nto be ill-treated to any extent, there are nevertheless some things\nwhich the common laws of life forbid us to do to a human being. Who\ndoes not hate Vedius Pollio[10] more even than his own slaves did,\nbecause he used to fatten his lampreys with human blood, and ordered\nthose who had offended him in any way to be cast into his fish-pond,\nor rather snake-pond? That {405} man deserved to die a thousand\ndeaths, both for throwing his slaves to be devoured by the lampreys\nwhich he himself meant to eat, and for keeping lampreys that he\nmight feed them in such a fashion. Cruel masters are pointed at\nwith disgust in all parts of the city, and are hated and loathed;\nthe wrong-doings of kings are enacted on a wider theatre: their\nshame and unpopularity endures for ages: yet how far better it would\nhave been never to have been born than to be numbered among those\nwho have been born to do their country harm!\nXIX. Nothing can be imagined which is more becoming to a sovereign\nthan clemency, by whatever title and right he may be set over his\nfellow citizens. The greater his power, the more beautiful and\nadmirable he will confess his clemency to be: for there is no reason\nwhy power should do any harm, if only it be wielded in accordance\nwith the laws of nature. Nature herself has conceived the idea of\na king, as you may learn from various animals, and especially from\nbees, among whom the king\u2019s cell is the roomiest, and is placed in\nthe most central and safest part of the hive; moreover, he does no\nwork, but employs himself in keeping the others up to their work.\nIf the king be lost, the entire swarm disperses: they never endure\nto have more than one king at a time, and find out which is the\nbetter by making them fight with one another: moreover the king is\ndistinguished by his statelier appearance, being both larger and\nmore brilliantly coloured than the other bees. The most remarkable\ndistinction, however, is the following: bees are very fierce, and\nfor their size are the most pugnacious of creatures, and leave their\nstings in the wounds which they make, but the king himself has no\nsting: nature does not wish him to be savage or to seek revenge at\nso dear a rate, and so has deprived him of his weapon and disarmed\nhis rage. She has offered him as a pattern to great sovereigns: for\nshe is wont to practise {406} herself in small matters, and to\nscatter abroad tiny models of the hugest structures. We ought to\nbe ashamed of not learning a lesson in behaviour from these small\ncreatures, for a man, who has so much more power of doing harm than\nthey, ought to show a correspondingly greater amount of self-control.\nWould that human beings were subject to the same law, and that their\nanger destroyed itself together with its instrument, so that they\ncould only inflict a wound once, and would not make use of the\nstrength of others to carry out their hatreds: for their fury would\nsoon grow faint if it carried its own punishment with it, and could\nonly give rein to its violence at the risk of death. Even as it is,\nhowever, no one can exercise it with safety, for he must needs feel\nas much fear as he hopes to cause, he must watch every one\u2019s\nmovements, and even when his enemies are not laying violent hands\nupon him he must bear in mind that they are plotting to do so, and\nhe cannot have a single moment free from alarm. Would any one endure\nto live such a life as this, when he might enjoy the privileges of\nhis high station to the general joy of all men, without injuring\nany one, and for that very reason have no one to fear? for it is a\nmistake to suppose that the king can be safe in a state where nothing\nis safe from the king: he can only purchase a life without anxiety\nfor himself by guaranteeing the same for his subjects. He need not\npile up lofty citadels, escarp steep hills, cut away the sides of\nmountains, and fence himself about with many lines of walls and\ntowers: clemency will render a king safe even upon an open plain.\nThe one fortification which cannot be stormed is the love of his\ncountrymen. What can be more glorious than a life which every one\nspontaneously and without official pressure hopes may last long?\nto excite men\u2019s fears, not their hopes, if one\u2019s health gives way\na little? to know that no one holds anything so dear that he would\nnot be glad to give it in exchange for the health of his sovereign?\n\u201cO, may {407} no evil befall him!\u201d they would cry: \u201che must live\nfor his own sake, not only for ours: his constant proofs of goodness\nhave made him belong to the state instead of the state belonging\nto him.\u201d Who would dare to plot any danger to such a king? Who would\nnot rather, if he could, keep misfortune far from one under whom\njustice, peace, decency, security and merit flourish, under whom\nthe state grows rich with an abundance of all good things, and looks\nupon its ruler in the same spirit of adoration and respect with\nwhich we should look upon the immortal gods, if they allowed us to\nbehold them as we behold him? Why! does not that man come very close\nto the gods who acts in a god-like manner, and who is beneficent,\nopen-handed, and powerful for good? Your aim and your pride ought\nto lie in being thought the best, as well as the greatest of mankind.\nXX. A prince generally inflicts punishment for one of two reasons:\nhe wishes either to assert his own rights or those of another. I\nwill first discuss the case in which he is personally concerned,\nfor it is more difficult for him to act with moderation when he\nacts under the impulse of actual pain than when he merely does so\nfor the sake of the example. It is unnecessary in this place to\nremind him to be slow to believe what he hears, to ferret out the\ntruth, to show favour to innocence, and to bear in mind that to\nprove it is as much the business of the judge as that of the prisoner;\nfor these considerations are connected with justice, not with\nclemency: what we are now encouraging him to do is not to lose\ncontrol over his feelings when he receives an unmistakeable injury,\nand to forego punishing it if he possibly can do so with safety,\nif not, to moderate the severity of the punishment, and to show\nhimself far more unwilling to forgive wrongs done to others than\nthose done to himself: for, just as the truly generous man is not\nhe who gives away what belongs to others, but he who deprives himself\nof what he gives to another, so also I should not call a prince\nclement {408} who looked goodnaturedly upon a wrong done to someone\nelse, but one who is unmoved even by the sting of a personal injury,\nwho understands how magnanimous it is for one whose power is unlimited\nto allow himself to be wronged, and that there is no more noble\nspectacle than that of a sovereign who has received an injury without\navenging it.\nXXI. Vengeance effects two purposes: it either affords compensation\nto the person to whom the wrong was done, or it ensures him against\nmolestation for the future. A prince is too rich to need compensation,\nand his power is too evident for him to require to gain a reputation\nfor power by causing any one to suffer. I mean, when he is attacked\nand injured by his inferiors, for if he sees those who once were\nhis equals in a position of inferiority to himself he is sufficiently\navenged. A king may be killed by a slave, or a serpent, or an arrow:\nbut no one can be saved except by some one who is greater than him\nwhom he saves. He, therefore, who has the power of giving and of\ntaking away life ought to use such a great gift of heaven in a\nspirited manner. Above all, if he once obtains this power over those\nwho he knows were once on a level with himself, he has completed\nhis revenge, and done all that he need to towards the punishment\nof his adversary: for he who owes his life to another must have\nlost it, and he who has been cast down from on high and lies at his\nenemy\u2019s feet with his kingdom and his life depending upon the\npleasure of another, adds to the glory of his preserver if he be\nallowed to live, and increases his reputation much more by remaining\nunhurt than if he were put out of the way. In the former case he\nremains as an everlasting testimony to the valour of his conqueror;\nwhereas if led in the procession of a triumph he would have soon\npassed out of sight.[11] If, however, his kingdom also may be safely\nleft in his hands {409} and he himself replaced upon the throne\nfrom which he has fallen, such a measure confers an immense increase\nof lustre on him who scorned to take anything from a conquered king\nbeyond the glory of having conquered him. To do this is to triumph\neven over one\u2019s own victory, and to declare that one has found\nnothing among the vanquished which it was worth the victor\u2019s while\nto take. As for his countrymen, strangers, and persons of mean\ncondition, he ought to treat them with all the less severity because\nit costs so much less to overcome them. Some you would be glad to\nspare, against some you would disdain to assert your rights, and\nwould forbear to touch them as you would to touch little insects\nwhich defile your hands when you crush them: but in the case of men\nupon whom all eyes are fixed, whether they be spared or condemned,\nyou should seize the opportunity of making your clemency widely\nknown.\nXXII. Let us now pass on to the consideration of wrongs done to\nothers, in avenging which the law has aimed at three ends, which\nthe prince will do well to aim at also: they are, either that it\nmay correct him whom it punishes, or that his punishment may render\nother men better, or that, by bad men being put out of the way, the\nrest may live without fear. You will more easily correct the men\nthemselves by a slight punishment, for he who has some part of his\nfortune remaining untouched will behave less recklessly; on the\nother hand, no one cares about respectability after he has lost it:\nit is a species of impunity to have nothing left for punishment to\ntake away. It is conducive, however, to good morals in a state,\nthat punishment should seldom be inflicted: for where there is a\nmultitude of sinners men become familiar with sin, shame is less\nfelt when shared with a number of fellow-criminals, and severe\nsentences, if frequently pronounced, lose the influence which\nconstitutes their chief power as remedial measures. A good king\nestablishes a good standard of morals for his {410} kingdom and\ndrives away vices if he is long-suffering with them, not that he\nshould seem to encourage them, but to be very unwilling and to\nsuffer much when he is forced to chastise them. Clemency in a\nsovereign even makes men ashamed to do wrong: for punishment seems\nfar more grievous when inflicted by a merciful man.\nXXIII. Besides this, you will find that sins which are frequently\npunished are frequently committed. Your father sewed up more\nparricides in sacks during five years, than we hear of in all\nprevious centuries. As long as the greatest of crimes remained\nwithout any special law, children were much more timid about\ncommitting it. Our wise ancestors, deeply skilled in human nature,\npreferred to pass over this as being a wickedness too great for\nbelief, and beyond the audacity of the worst criminal, rather than\nteach men that it might be done by appointing a penalty for doing\nit: parricides, consequently, were unknown until a law was made\nagainst them, and the penalty showed them the way to the crime.\nFilial affection soon perished, for since that time we have seen\nmore men punished by the sack than by the cross. Where men are\nseldom punished innocence becomes the rule, and is encouraged as a\npublic benefit. If a state thinks itself innocent, it will be\ninnocent: it will be all the more angry with those who corrupt the\ngeneral simplicity of manners if it sees that they are few in number.\nBelieve me, it is a dangerous thing to show a state how great a\nmajority of bad men it contains.\nXXIV. A proposal was once made in the Senate to distinguish slaves\nfrom free men by their dress: it was then discovered how dangerous\nit would be for our slaves to be able to count our numbers. Be\nassured that the same thing would be the case if no one\u2019s offence\nis pardoned: it will quickly be discovered how far the number of\nbad men exceeds that of the good. Many executions are as disgraceful\nto a sovereign as many funerals are to a physician: {411} one who\ngoverns less strictly is better obeyed. The human mind is naturally\nself-willed, kicks against the goad, and sets its face against\nauthority; it will follow more readily than it can be led. As\nwell-bred and high-spirited horses are best managed with a loose\nrein, so mercy gives men\u2019s minds a spontaneous bias towards innocence,\nand the public think that it is worth observing. Mercy, therefore,\ndoes more good than severity.\nXXV, Cruelty is far from being a human vice, and is unworthy of\nman\u2019s gentle mind: it is mere bestial madness to take pleasure in\nblood and wounds, to cast off humanity and transform oneself into\na wild beast of the forest. Pray, Alexander, what is the difference\nbetween your throwing Lysimachus into a lion\u2019s den and tearing his\nflesh with your own teeth? it is you that have the lion\u2019s maw, and\nthe lion\u2019s fierceness. How pleased you would be if you had claws\ninstead of nails, and jaws that were capable of devouring men! We\ndo not expect of you that your hand, the sure murderer of your best\nfriends, should restore health to any one; or that your proud spirit,\nthat inexhaustible source of evil to all nations, should be satisfied\nwith anything short of blood and slaughter: we rather call it mercy\nthat your friend should have a human being chosen to be his butcher.\nThe reason why cruelty is the most hateful of all vices is that it\ngoes first beyond the ordinary limits, and then beyond those of\nhumanity; that it devises new kinds of punishments, calls ingenuity\nto aid it in inventing devices for varying and lengthening men\u2019s\ntorture, and takes delight in their sufferings: this accursed disease\nof the mind reaches its highest pitch of madness when cruelty itself\nturns into pleasure, and the act of killing a man becomes enjoyment.\nSuch a ruler is soon cast down from his throne; his life is attempted\nby poison one day and by the sword the next; he is exposed to as\nmany dangers as there are men to whom he is dangerous, and he {412}\nis sometimes destroyed by the plots of individuals, and at others\nby a general insurrection. Whole communities are not roused to\naction by unimportant outrages on private persons; but cruelty which\ntakes a wider range, and from which no one is safe, becomes a mark\nfor all men\u2019s weapons. Very small snakes escape our notice, and the\nwhole country does not combine to destroy them; but when one of\nthem exceeds the usual size and grows into a monster, when it poisons\nfountains with its spittle, scorches herbage with its breath, and\nspreads ruin wherever it crawls, we shoot at it with military\nengines. Trifling evils may cheat us and elude our observation, but\nwe gird up our loins to attack great ones. One sick person does not\nso much as disquiet the house in which he lies; but when frequent\ndeaths show that a plague is raging, there is a general outcry, men\ntake to flight and shake their fists angrily at the very gods\nthemselves. If a fire breaks out under one single roof, the family\nand the neighbours pour water upon it; but a wide conflagration\nwhich has consumed many houses must be smothered under the ruins\nof a whole quarter of a city.\nXXVI. The cruelty even of private men has sometimes been revenged\nby their slaves in spite of the certainty that they will be crucified:\nwhole kingdoms and nations when oppressed by tyrants or threatened\nby them, have attempted their destruction. Sometimes their own\nguards have risen in revolt, and have used against their master all\nthe deceit, disloyalty, and ferocity which they have learned from\nhim. What, indeed, can he expect from those whom he has taught to\nbe wicked? A bad man will not long be obedient, and will not do\nonly as much evil as he is ordered. But even if the tyrant may be\ncruel with safety, how miserable his kingdom must be: it must look\nlike a city taken by storm, like some frightful scene of general\npanic. Everywhere sorrow, anxiety, disorder; men dread even their\nown pleasures; they cannot even dine with one another in safety\n{413} when they have to keep watch over their tongues even when in\ntheir cups, nor can they safely attend the public shows when informers\nare ready to find grounds for their impeachment in their behaviour\nthere. Although the spectacles be provided at an enormous expense,\nwith royal magnificence and with world-famous artists, yet who cares\nfor amusement when he is in prison? Ye gods! what a miserable life\nit is to slaughter and to rage, to delight in the clanking of chains,\nand to cut off one\u2019s countrymen\u2019s heads, to cause blood to flow\nfreely wherever one goes, to terrify people, and make them flee\naway out of one\u2019s sight! It is what would happen if bears or lions\nwere our masters, if serpents and all the most venomous creatures\nwere given power over us. Even these animals, devoid of reason as\nthey are, and accused by us of cruel ferocity, spare their own kind,\nand wild beasts themselves respect their own likeness: but the fury\nof tyrants does not even stop short at their own relations, and\nthey treat friends and strangers alike, only becoming more violent\nthe more they indulge their passions. By insensible degrees he\nproceeds from the slaughter of individuals to the ruin of nations,\nand thinks it a sign of power to set roofs on fire and to plough\nup the sites of ancient cities: he considers it unworthy of an\nemperor to order only one or two people to be put to death, and\nthinks that his cruelty is unduly restrained if whole troops of\nwretches are not sent to execution together. True happiness, on the\nother hand; consists in saving many men\u2019s lives, in calling them\nback from the very gates of death, and in being so merciful as to\ndeserve a civic crown.[12] No decoration is more worthy or more\nbecoming to a prince\u2019s rank than that crown \u201cfor saving the lives\nof fellow-citizens\u201d: not trophies torn from a vanquished enemy, not\n{414} chariots wet with their savage owner\u2019s blood, not spoils\ncaptured in war. This power which saves men\u2019s lives by crowds and\nby nations, is godlike: the power of extensive and indiscrimate\nmassacre is the power of downfall and conflagration.\n[1] _Nobilis_.\n[2] The text is corrupt. I have followed Gertz\u2019s conjectural\nemendation, _mansuefactionis_, but I believe that Lipsius is right\nin thinking that a great deal more than one word has been lost here.\n[3] _Pace_.\n[4] Tutum.\n[5] Gertz reads _sexagesimum_, his sixtieth year, which he calls\n\u201cthe not very audacious conjecture of Wesseling,\u201d and adds that he\ndoes so because of the words at the beginning of chap. xi. and the\nauthority of Dion Cassius. The ordinary reading is _quadragesimum_,\n\u201chis fortieth year,\u201d and this is the date to which Cinna\u2019s conspiracy\nis referred to by Merivale, \u201cHistory of the Romans under the Empire,\u201d\nvol. iv. ch, 37. \u201cA plot,\u201d he says, \u201cwas formed for his destruction,\nat the head of which was Cornelius Cinna, described as a son of\nFaustus Sulla by a daughter of the Great Pompeius.\u201d The story of\nCinna\u2019s conspiracy is told by Seneca, de Clem, i, 9, and Dion iv.\n14, foll. They agree in the main fact; but Seneca is our authority\nfor the details of the interview between Augustus and his enemy,\nwhile Dion has doubtless invented his long conversation between the\nemperor and Livia. Seneca, however, calls the conspirator Lucius,\nand places the event in the fortieth year of Augustus (A.D. 731),\nthe scene in Gaul: Dion, on the other, gives the names of Gnaeus,\nand supposes the circumstances to have occured twenty-six years\nlater, and at Rome. It may be observed that a son of Faustus Sulla\nmust have been at least fifty at this latter date, nor do we know\nwhy he should bear the name of Cinna, though an adoption is not\nimpossible.\n[6] See Shakespeare\u2019s \u201cJulius Caesar,\u201d Act IV, Sc. 1.\n[7] In allusion to the title of \u201cFather of his country,\u201d bestowed\nby the Senate upon Augustus.

ANNAEUS SENECA, ADDRESSED TO\nNERO CAESAR.\nON CLEMENCY.\nI. I have been especially led to write about clemency, Nero Caesar,\nby a saying of yours, which I remember having heard with admiration\nand which I afterwards told to others: a noble saying, showing a\ngreat mind and great gentleness, which suddenly burst from you\nwithout premeditation, and was not meant to reach any ears but your\nown, and which displayed the conflict which was raging between your\nnatural goodness and your imperial duties. Your prefect Burrus, an\nexcellent man who was born to be the servant of such an emperor as\nyou are, was about to order two brigands to be executed, and was\npressing you to write their names and the grounds on which they\nwere to be put to death: this had often been put off, and he was\ninsisting that it should then be done. When he reluctantly produced\nthe document and put it into your equally reluctant hands, you\nexclaimed: \u201cWould that I had never learned my letters!\u201d O what a\nspeech, how worthy to be heard by all nations, both those who dwell\nwithin the Roman Empire, those who enjoy a debatable independence\nupon its borders, and those who either in will or in deed fight\nagainst it! It is a speech which ought to be spoken {416} before a\nmeeting of all mankind, whose words all kings and princes ought to\nswear to obey: a speech worthy of the days of human innocence, and\nworthy to bring back that golden age. Now in truth we ought all to\nagree to love righteousness and goodness; covetousness, which is\nthe root of all evil, ought to be driven away, piety and virtue,\ngood faith and modesty ought to resume their interrupted reign, and\nthe vices which have so long and so shamefully ruled us ought at\nlast to give way to an age of happiness and purity.\nII. To a great extent, Caesar, we may hope and expect that this\nwill come to pass. Let your own goodness of heart be gradually\nspread and diffused throughout the whole body of the empire, and\nall parts of it will mould themselves into your likeness. Good\nhealth proceeds from the head into all the members of the body:\nthey are all either brisk and erect, or languid and drooping,\naccording as their guiding spirit blooms or withers. Both Romans\nand allies will prove worthy of this goodness of yours, and good\nmorals will return to all the world: your hands will everywhere\nfind less to do. Allow me to dwell somewhat upon this saying of\nyours, not because it is a pleasant subject for your ears (indeed,\nthis is not my way; I would rather offend by telling the truth than\ncurry favour by flattery). What, then, is my reason? Besides wishing\nthat you should be as familiar as possible with your own good deeds\nand good words, in order that what is now untutored impulse may\ngrow into matured decision, I remember that many great but odious\nsayings have become part of human life and are familiar in men\u2019s\nmouths, such as that celebrated \u201cLet them hate me, provided that\nthey fear me,\u201d which is like that Greek verse, \u03ad\u03bc\u03bf\u1fe6 \u03b8\u03b1\u03bd\u03cc\u03bd\u03c4\u03bf\u03c2 \u03b3\u03b1\u1fd6\u03b1\n\u03bc\u03b9\u03c7\u03b8\u03ae\u03c4\u03c9 \u03c0\u03bd\u03c1\u03af, in which a man bids the earth perish in flame after\nhe is dead, and others of the like sort. I know not how it is, but\ncertainly human ingenuity seems to have found it {417} easier to\nfind emphatic and ardent expression for monstrous and cynical\nsentiments: I have never hitherto heard any spirited saying from a\ngood and gentle person. What, then, is the upshot of all this? It\nis that, albeit seldom and against your will, and after much\nhesitation, you sometimes nevertheless must write that which made\nyou hate your letters, but that you ought to do so with great\nhesitation and after many postponements, even as you now do.\nIII. But lest the plausible word \u201cmercy\u201d should sometimes deceive\nus and lead us into the opposite extreme, let us consider what mercy\nis, what its qualities are, and within what limits it is confined.\nMercy is \u201ca restraining of the mind from vengeance when it is in\nits power to avenge itself,\u201d or it is \u201cgentleness shown by a powerful\nman in fixing the punishment of a weaker one.\u201d It is safer to have\nmore than one definition, since one may not include the whole\nsubject, and may, so to speak, lose its cause: mercy, therefore,\nmay likewise be termed a tendency towards mildness in inflicting\npunishment. It is possible to discover certain inconsistencies in\nthe definition which comes nearer the truth than all the rest, which\nis to call mercy \u201cself-restraint, which remits some part of a fine\nwhich it deserves to receive and which is due to it.\u201d To this it\nwill be objected that no virtue ever gives any man less than his\ndue. However, all men understand mercy to consist in coming short\nof the penalty which might with justice be inflicted.\nIV. The unlearned think that its opposite is strictness: but no\nvirtue is the opposite of another virtue. What, then, is the opposite\nof mercy? Cruelty: which is nothing more than obstinacy in exacting\npunishments. \u201cBut,\u201d say you, \u201csome men do not exact punishments,\nand nevertheless are cruel, such as those who kill the strangers\nwhom they meet, not in order to rob them, but for killing\u2019s sake,\nand men who are not satisfied with killing, but kill {418} with\nsavage tortures, like the famous Busiris,[1] and Procrustes, and\npirates who flog their captives and burn them alive.\u201d This appears\nto be cruelty: but as it is not the result of vengeance (for it has\nreceived no wrong), and is not excited by any offence (for no crime\nhas preceded it), it does not come within our definition, which was\nlimited to \u201cextravagance in exacting the penalties of wrongdoing.\u201d\nWe may say that this is not cruelty, but ferocity, which finds\npleasure in savagery: or we may call it madness; for madness is of\nvarious kinds, and there is no truer madness than that which takes\nto slaughtering and mutilating human beings. I shall, therefore,\ncall those persons cruel who have a reason for punishing but who\npunish without moderation, like Phalaris, who is not said to have\ntortured innocent men, but to have tortured criminals with inhuman\nand incredible barbarity. We may avoid hairsplitting by defining\ncruelty to be \u201ca tendency of the mind towards harsh measures.\u201d Mercy\nrepels cruelty and bids it be far from her: with strictness she is\non terms of amity.\nAt this point it is useful to inquire into what pity is; for many\npraise it as a virtue, and say that a good man is full of pity.\nThis also is a disease of the mind. Both of these stand close to\nmercy and to strictness, and both ought to be avoided, lest under\nthe name of strictness we be led into cruelty, and under the name\nof mercy into pity. It is less dangerous to make the latter mistake,\nbut both lead us equally far away from the truth.\nV. Just as the gods are worshipped by religion, but are dishonoured\nby superstition, so all good men will show mercy and mildness, but\nwill avoid pity, which is a vice incident to weak minds which cannot\nendure the sight of another\u2019s sufferings. It is, therefore, most\ncommonly {419} found in the worst people; there are old women and\ngirls[2] who are affected by the tears of the greatest criminals,\nand who, if they could, would let them out of prison. Pity considers\na man\u2019s misfortunes and does not consider to what they are due:\nmercy is combined with reason. I know that the doctrine of the\nStoics is unpopular among the ignorant as being excessively severe\nand not at all likely to give kings and princes good advice; it is\nblamed because it declares that the wise man knows not how to feel\npity or to grant pardon. These doctrines, if taken separately, are\nindeed odious, for they appear to give men no hope of repairing\ntheir mistakes but exact a penalty for every slip. If this were\ntrue, how can it be true wisdom to bid us put off human feeling,\nand to exclude us from mutual help, that surest haven of refuge\nagainst the attacks of Fortune? But no school of philosophy is more\ngentle and benignant, none is more full of love towards man or more\nanxious to promote the happiness of all, seeing that its maxims\nare, to be of service and assistance to others, and to consult the\ninterests of each and all, not of itself alone. Pity is a disorder\nof the mind caused by the sight of other men\u2019s miseries, or it is\na sadness caused by the evils with which it believes others to be\nundeservedly afflicted: but the wise man cannot be affected by any\ndisorder: his mind is calm, and nothing can possibly happen to\nruffle it. Moreover, nothing becomes a man more than magnanimity:\nbut magnanimity cannot coexist with sorrow. Sorrow overwhelms men\u2019s\nminds, casts them down, contracts them: now this cannot happen to\nthe wise man even in his greatest misfortunes, but he will beat\nback the rage of Fortune and triumph over it: he will {420} always\nretain the same calm, undisturbed expression of countenance, which\nhe never could do were he accessible to sorrow.\nVI. Add to this, that the wise man provides for the future and\nalways has a distinct plan of action ready: yet nothing clear and\ntrue can flow from a disturbed source. Sorrow is awkward at reviewing\nthe position of affairs, at devising useful expedients, avoiding\ndangerous courses, and weighing the merits of fair and just ones:\ntherefore the wise man will not feel pity, because this cannot\nhappen to a man unless his mind is disturbed. He will do willingly\nand highmindedly all that those who feel pity are wont to do; he\nwill dry the tears of others, but will not mingle his own with them;\nhe will stretch out his hand to the shipwrecked mariner, will offer\nhospitality to the exile, and alms to the needy\u2014not in the offensive\nway in which most of those who wish to be thought tender-hearted\nfling their bounty to those whom they assist and shrink from their\ntouch, but as one man would give another something out of the common\nstock\u2014he will restore children to their weeping mothers, will loose\nthe chains of the captive, release the gladiator from his bondage,\nand even bury the carcase of the criminal, but he will perform all\nthis with a calm mind and unaltered expression of countenance. Thus\nthe wise man will not pity men, but will help them and be of service\nto them, seeing that he is born to be a help to all men and a public\nbenefit, of which he will bestow a share upon every one. He will\neven grant a proportional part of his bounty to those sufferers who\ndeserve blame and correction; but he will much more willingly help\nthose whose troubles and adversities are caused by misfortune.\nWhenever he is able he will interpose between Fortune and her\nvictims: for what better employment can he find for his wealth or\nhis strength than in setting up again what chance has overthrown?\nHe will not show or feel any {421} disgust at a man\u2019s having withered\nlegs, or a flabby wrinkled skin, or supporting his aged body upon\na staff; but he will do good to those who deserve it, and will,\nlike a god, look benignantly upon all who are in trouble. Pity\nborders upon misery: it is partly composed of it and partly derived\nfrom it. You know that eyes must be weak, if they fill with rheum\nat the sight of another\u2019s blearedness, just as it is not real\nmerriment but hysteria which makes people laugh because others\nlaugh, and yawn whenever others open their jaws: pity is a defect\nin the mind of people who are extraordinarily affected by suffering,\nand he who requires a wise man to exhibit it is not far from requiring\nhim to lament and groan when strangers are buried.\nVII. But why should he not pardon?[3] Let us decide by exact\ndefinition this other slippery matter, the true nature of pardon,\nand we shall then perceive that the wise man ought not to grant it.\nPardon is the remitting of a deserved punishment. The reasons why\nthe wise man ought not to grant this remission are given at length\nby those of whom this question is specially asked: I will briefly\nsay, as though it were no concern of mine to decide this point, \u201cA\nman grants pardon to one whom he ought to punish: now the wise man\ndoes nothing which he ought not to do, and omits to [do] nothing\nwhich he ought to do: he does not, therefore, remit any punishment\nwhich he ought to exact. But the wise man will bestow upon you in\na more honourable way that which you wish to obtain by pardon, for\nhe will make allowances for you, will consult your interests, and\nwill correct your bad habits: he will act just as though he were\npardoning you, but nevertheless he will not pardon you, because he\nwho pardons admits that in so doing he has neglected a part of {422}\nhis duty. He will only punish some people by reprimanding them, and\nwill inflict no further penalty if he considers that they are of\nan age which admits of reformation: some people who are undeniably\nimplicated in an odious charge he will acquit, because they were\ndeceived into committing, or were not sober when they committed the\noffence with which they are charged: he will let his enemies depart\nunharmed, sometimes even with words of commendation, if they have\ntaken up arms to defend their honour, their covenants with others,\ntheir freedom, or on any other honourable ground. All these doings\ncome under the head of mercy, not of pardon. Mercy is free to come\nto what decision it pleases: she gives her decision, not under any\nstatute, but according to equity and goodness: she may acquit the\ndefendant, or impose what damages she pleases. She does not do any\nof these things as though she were doing less than justice requires,\nbut as though the justest possible course were that which she adopts.\nOn the other hand, to pardon is not to punish a man whom you have\ndecided ought to be punished; pardon is the remission of a punishment\nwhich ought to be inflicted. The first advantage which mercy has\nover it is that she does not tell those whom she lets off that they\nought to have suffered: she is more complete, more honourable than\npardon.\u201d\nIn my opinion, this is a mere dispute about words, and we are agreed\nabout the thing itself. The wise man will remit many penalties, and\nwill save many who are wicked, but whose wickedness is not incurable.\nHe will act like good husbandmen, who do not cultivate only straight\nand tall trees, but also apply props to straighten those which have\nbeen rendered crooked by various causes; they trim some, lest the\nluxuriance of their boughs should hinder their upward growth, they\nnurse those which have been {423} weakened by being planted in an\nunsuitable position, and they give air to those which are overshadowed\nby the foliage of others. The wise man will see the several treatments\nsuitable to several dispositions, and how what is crooked may be\nstraightened. . . .\n[1] A king of Egypt, who sacrificed strangers, and was himself slain\nby Hercules.\n[2] \u201cThree or four wenches where I stood, cried \u2018Alas, good soul!\u2014\u2019\nand forgave him with all their hearts: but there\u2019s no heed to be\ntaken of them; if Caesar had stabbed their mothers, they would have\ndone no less.\u201d\u2014\u201cJulius Caesar,\u201d act i. sc. 2.\n[3] See above, chap. v.\nTHE END.\n{425}\nINDEX.\nA\nAlexander the Great, 78, 98, 135, 141, 411.\nAlexandria, Library of, 270.\nAnger, 48; signs of, 49; results of, 50; definitions of, 50_n_;\nanimals not subject to, 52; not natural, 54; should be resisted at\nthe beginning, 57; examples of its results, 60; not necessary against\nenemies, 60; nor useful, 63; not necessary for punishment, 68;\ncontrasted with reason, 69; creates vain-glory, but not magnanimity,\n73; cannot act without the approval of the mind, 77; contrasted\nwith ferocity, 80; the wise man will never be angry, 81; anger and\nfear, 87; anger ought to be done away with, 88; must never become\na habit, 90; remedies for, 93; some men more prone to, than others,\n93; influence of education, 95; and of prosperity, 96; cause of,\n97; effect of trifles, 99; delay the best remedy, 104; anger caused\nby ignorance or arrogance, 106; or by desire for revenge, 108; its\nhideousness and danger, 111; its power, 114; contrasted with other\nvices and passions, 116; how to avoid it, 120; examples of anger\nindulged in, Cambyses, 131, 139; Astyages, 133; Darius, 135; Xerxes,\n135; Alexander, 135; Lysimachus, 136; Caligula, 137, 139; Rhinocolura,\n138; Cyrus, 139; examples of anger controlled, Antigonus, 140;\nPhilip, 141; Augustus, 142; how injuries ought to be bourne, 144;\nbetter to heal than to avenge them, 146; the evils of anger, 147;\nits trifling beginnings, 149; money, 151; other causes, 152; value\nof self-examination, 154; how to soothe the anger of others, 156;\nAugustus and Vedius, 158; anger should be got rid of altogether,\n159.\nAnimals, anger in, 49, 52.\nAntigonus (monophthalmus), 141.\nAntisthenes, 45.\nAntonius, M., 374, 391.\nAristides, 341.\nAristotle, 51_n_, 52, 58, 68, 118, 135, 287, 288.\nApicius, the glutton, 217, 336.\nAsinius Pollio, 142, 285.\nAstyages, King of Persia, 133.\nAugustus. _See_ Caesar.\n{426}\nAvarice, conquered by anger, 114.\nAthenodorus, quoted, 259, 265.\nB\nBees, 405.\nBibulus, L., 181.\nBion, quoted, 267, 282.\nBooks, should be bought to read, not for show, 270.\nBrutus, L.

Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg\u2122\nProject Gutenberg\u2122 is synonymous with the free distribution of\nelectronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of\ncomputers including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers. It\nexists because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations\nfrom people in all walks of life.\nVolunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the\nassistance they need are critical to reaching Project Gutenberg\u2122\u2019s\ngoals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg\u2122 collection will\nremain freely available for generations to come. In 2001, the Project\nGutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure\nand permanent future for Project Gutenberg\u2122 and future\ngenerations. To learn more about the Project Gutenberg Literary\nArchive Foundation and how your efforts and donations can help, see\nSections 3 and 4 and the Foundation information page at www.gutenberg.org.\nSection 3. Information about the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation\nThe Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation is a non-profit\n501(c)(3) educational corporation organized under the laws of the\nstate of Mississippi and granted tax exempt status by the Internal\nRevenue Service. The Foundation\u2019s EIN or federal tax identification\nnumber is 64-6221541. Contributions to the Project Gutenberg Literary\nArchive Foundation are tax deductible to the full extent permitted by\nU.S. federal laws and your state\u2019s laws.\nThe Foundation\u2019s business office is located at 809 North 1500 West,\nSalt Lake City, UT 84116, (801) 596-1887. Email contact links and up\nto date contact information can be found at the Foundation\u2019s website\nand official page at www.gutenberg.org/contact\nSection 4. Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg\nLiterary Archive Foundation\nProject Gutenberg\u2122 depends upon and cannot survive without widespread\npublic support and donations to carry out its mission of\nincreasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be\nfreely distributed in machine-readable form accessible by the widest\narray of equipment including outdated equipment. Many small donations\n($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt\nstatus with the IRS.\nThe Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating\ncharities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United\nStates. Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a\nconsiderable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up\nwith these requirements. We do not solicit donations in locations\nwhere we have not received written confirmation of compliance. To SEND\nDONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any particular state\nvisit www.gutenberg.org/donate.\nWhile we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we\nhave not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition\nagainst accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who\napproach us with offers to donate.\nInternational donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make\nany statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from\noutside the United States. U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.\nPlease check the Project Gutenberg web pages for current donation\nmethods and addresses. Donations are accepted in a number of other\nways including checks, online payments and credit card donations. To\ndonate, please visit: www.gutenberg.org/donate.\nSection 5. General Information About Project Gutenberg\u2122 electronic works\nProfessor Michael S. Hart was the originator of the Project\nGutenberg\u2122 concept of a library of electronic works that could be\nfreely shared with anyone. For forty years, he produced and\ndistributed Project Gutenberg\u2122 eBooks with only a loose network of\nvolunteer support.\nProject Gutenberg\u2122 eBooks are often created from several printed\neditions, all of which are confirmed as not protected by copyright in\nthe U.S. unless a copyright notice is included. Thus, we do not\nnecessarily keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper\nedition.\nMost people start at our website which has the main PG search\nfacility: www.gutenberg.org.\nThis website includes information about Project Gutenberg\u2122,\nincluding how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary\nArchive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to\nsubscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.", "source": "minor_dialogues.txt"}

He couldn't help\nit: he had run short of tunics, also of \"pants\"--except three pairs\nwhich wouldn't fit me, wouldn't fit anybody, unless we enlisted three\nvery fat dwarfs: he had kept on asking for tunics and pants, and they'd\nsent him nothing but great-coats and water-bottles: I could take his\nword for it, he wished he was at the Front, he did, instead of in this\nblessed hole filling in blessed forms for blessed clothes which never\ncame. Impossible, anyhow, to rig me out. I was going on duty, was I?\nThen I must go on duty in my \"civvies.\"\nIt was a disappointment. Your new recruit feels that no small item of\nhis reward is the privilege of beholding himself in khaki. The escape\nfrom civilian clothes was, at that era, one of the prime lures to\nenlistment. I had attempted to escape before, and failed. Now at last I\nhad found a branch of the army which would accept me. It needed my\nservices instantly. I was to start work at once. Nothing better. I was\nready. This was what I had been seeking for months past. But--I confess\nit--I had always pictured myself dressed as a soldier. The postponement\nof this bright vision for even twenty-four hours, now that it had seemed\nto be within my grasp, was damping. However--! The Sergeant-Major had\ntold me that I was to go on duty as orderly in Ward W--an officers'\nward--at 2 p.m. prompt. I did not know where Ward W was; I did not know\nwhat a ward-orderly's functions should amount to. And I had no uniform.\nI was attired in a light grey lounge suit--appropriate enough to my\nnormal habit, but quite too flippant, I was certain, for a ward-orderly.\nWhatever else a ward-orderly might be, I was sure that he was not the\nsort of person to sport a grey lounge suit.\nStill, I must hie me to Ward W. I had got my wish. I was in the army at\nlast. In the army one does not argue. One obeys. So, having been\ndirected down an interminable corridor, I presented myself at Ward W.\nOn entering--I had knocked, but no response rewarded this courtesy--I\nwas requested, by a stern-visaged Sister, to state my business. Her\nsternness was excusable. The visiting-hour was not yet, and in my\nunprofessional guise she had taken me for a visitor. My explanation\ndispelled her frowns. She was expecting me. Her present orderly had been\ngranted three days' leave. He was preparing to depart. I was to act as\nhis substitute. Before he went he would initiate me into the secrets of\nhis craft. She called him. \"Private Wood!\" Private Wood, in his\nshirt-sleeves, appeared. I was handed over to him.\nHerein I was fortunate, though I was unaware of it at the time. Private\nWood, who was not too proud to wash dishes (which was what he had at\nthat moment been doing), is a distinguished sculptor and a man of keen\nimagination. At a subsequent period that imagination was to bring forth\nthe masks-for-facial-disfigurements scheme which gained him his\ncommission and which has attracted world-wide notice from experts.\nMeanwhile his imagination enabled him to understand the exact extent of\na novice's ignorance, the precise details which I did not know and must\nknow, the essential apparatus I had to be shown the knack of, before he\nfled to catch his train.\nHe devoted just five minutes, no more, to teaching me how to be a\nward-orderly. Four of those minutes were lavished on the sink-room--a\nsmall apartment that enshrines cleaning appliances, the taps of which,\nif you turn them on without precautions, treat you to an involuntary\nshower bath. The sink-room contains a selection of utensils wherewith\nevery orderly becomes only too familiar: their correct employment, a\ntheme of many of the mildly Rabelaisian jests which are current in every\nhospital, is a mystery--until some kind mentor, like Private Wood, lifts\nthe veil. In four minutes he had told me all about the sink-room, and\nall about all the gear in the sink-room and all about a variety of\nrituals which need not here be dwelt on. (The sink-room is an excellent\nplace in which to receive a private lecture.) The fifth minute was spent\nin introducing me, in another room, the ward kitchen, to Mrs.\nMappin--the scrub-lady.\nA scrub-lady is attached to each ward; and most wards, it should in\njustice be added, are attached to their scrub-ladies. Certainly I was to\nfind that Ward W was attached to Mrs. Mappin. Mrs. Mappin was washing\nup. Private Wood had been helping her. The completion of his task he\ndelegated to me. \"Mrs. Mappin, this is our new orderly. He'll help you\nfinish the lunch-dishes.\" Private Wood then slid into his tunic,\nsnatched his cap from a nail in the wall, and vanished.\nMrs. Mappin surveyed me. \"Ah!\" she sighed--she was given to sighing.\n\"He's a good 'un, is Private Wood.\" The inference was plain. There was\nlittle hope of my becoming such a good 'un. In any case, my natty grey\ntweeds were against me. One could never make an orderliesque impression\nin those tweeds. \"Better take your jacket off,\" sighed Mrs. Mappin. I\ndid so, chose a dishcloth, and started to dry a pyramid of wet plates.\nFor a space Mrs. Mappin meditated, her hands in soapy water. Then she\nwithdrew them. \"I think,\" she sighed, \"you an' me could do with a cup of\ntea.\"\nAnd presently I was having tea with Mrs. Mappin.\nI was afterwards to learn that this practice of calling a halt in her\nlabours for a cup of tea was a highly incorrect one on Mrs. Mappin's\npart, and that my share in the transaction was to the last degree\nreprehensible. But I was also to learn that faithful, selfless, honest,\nand diligent scrub-ladies are none too common; and the Sister who\ndiscovers that she has been allotted such a jewel as Mrs. Mappin is\nseldom foolish enough to exact from her a strict obedience to the letter\nof the law in discipline. Mrs. Mappin, in her non-tea-bibbing\ninterludes, toiled like a galley-slave, was rigidly punctual, and never\ncomplained. Her sighs were no index of her character. They were not a\nsymptom of ennui (though possibly--if the suggestion be not rude--of\nindigestion caused by tannin poisoning). She was the best-tempered of\ncreatures. It is a fact that if I had been so disposed I need never have\ngiven Mrs. Mappin any assistance, though it was within my province to do\nso. She would, without a murmur, shoulder other people's jobs as well as\nher own. Having finished with bearing children (one was at the Front--it\nwas Mrs. Mappin who, on being asked the whereabouts of her soldier son,\nsaid, \"'E's in France; I don't rightly know w'ere the place is, but it's\n_called_ 'Dugout'\"), she had settled down, for the remainder of her\nsojourn on this plane, to a prospect of work, continuous work. A little\nmore or a little less made no difference to her. She had nothing else to\ndo, but work; nothing else to be interested in, except work--and her\nchildren's progress, and her cups of tea. Her ample figure concealed a\nwarm heart. Behind her wrinkled old face there was a brain with a\nlimited outfit of ideas--and the chief of those ideas was _work_.\nOur cup of tea was refreshing, but it would be incorrect to convey the\nnotion that I was allowed to linger over such a luxury. There are few\nintervals for leisure in the duty-hours of an orderly in an officers'\nward. Had the Sister and her nurses not been occupied elsewhere, I doubt\nwhether I should have been free to drink that cup of tea at all--a\ncircumstance of which perhaps Mrs. Mappin was more aware than I. At any\nrate the call of \"Orderly!\" from a patient summoned me from the kitchen\nand into the ward long before I had finished drying Mrs. Mappin's\ndishes.\nThe patient desired some small service performed for him. I performed\nit--remembering to address him as \"Sir.\" Various other patients,\nobserving my presence, took the opportunity to hail me. I found myself\nsaying \"Yes, Sir!\" \"In a moment, Sir!\" and dropping--with a promptitude\non which I rather flattered myself--into the manner of a cross between a\nvalet and a waiter, with a subtle dash of chambermaid. Soon I was also a\nluggage-porter, staggering to a taxi with the ponderous impedimenta of a\njuvenile second lieutenant who was bidding the hospital farewell, and\nwhose trunks contained--at a guess--geological specimens and battlefield\nsouvenirs in the shape of \"dud\" German shells. This young gentleman\nfumbled with a gratuity, then thought better of it--and was gracious\nenough to return my grin. \"Bit awkward, tipping, in these days,\" he\napologised cheerily, depositing himself in his taxi behind ramparts of\nholdalls. \"Thank you, Sir,\" seemed the suitable adieu, and having\nproffered it I scampered into the ward again. Anon Sister sent me with a\nmessage to the dispensary. Where the dispensary was I knew not. But I\nfound out, and brought back what she required. Then to the post office.\nAnother exploration down that terrific corridor. Post office located at\nlast and duly noted. Then to the linen store to draw attention to an\nerror in the morning's supply of towels. Linen store eventually\nunearthed--likewise the information that its staff disclaimed all\nresponsibility for mistakes--likewise the first inkling of a profound\nmaxim, that when a mistake has been made, in hospital, it is always the\norderly, and no one else, who has made it.\nEngaged on these errands, and a host of intervening lesser exploits in\nthe ward, I had to cultivate an unwonted fleetness of foot. I flew. So\ndid the time. Almost immediately, as it seemed to me, I was bidden to\nserve afternoon tea to our patients. The distribution of bed-tables, of\ncups, of bread-and-butter (most of which, also, I cut); the \"A little\nmore tea, Sir?\" or, \"A pot of jam in your locker, Sir, behind the pair\nof trousers?... Yes, here it is, Sir\"; the laborious feeding of a\npatient who could not move his arms;--all these occupied me for a\nbreathless hour. Then an involved struggle with a patient who had to be\nlifted from a bath-chair into bed. (I had never lifted a human being\nbefore.) Then a second bout of washing-up with Mrs. Mappin. Then a\nnominal half-an-hour's respite for my own tea--actually ten minutes, for\nI was behindhand. Then, all too soon, more waitering at the ceremony of\nDinner: this time with the complication that some of my patients were\nallowed wine, beer, or spirits, and some were not. \"Burgundy, Sir?\"\n\"Whiskey-and-soda, Sir?\" I ran round the table of the sitting-up\npatients, displaying (I was pleased to think) the complete aplomb and\nnimbleness of a thoroughbred Swiss _gar\u00e7on_, pouring out drinks--with\nconcealed envy--placing and removing plates, handing salt, bread,\nserviettes.... After which, back to Mrs. Mappin and her renewed mountain\nof once-more-to-be-washed-and-dried crockery.\nIt was long after my own supper hour had come and gone that I was able\nto say au revoir to the ward. The cleansing of the grease-encrusted\nmeat-tin was a travail which alone promised to last half the night.\n(Mrs. Mappin eventually lent me her assistance, and later I became more\nadroit.) And the calls of \"Orderly!\" from the bed patients were\ninterruptions I could not ignore. But at last some sort of conclusion\nwas reached. Mrs. Mappin put on her bonnet. The night orderly, who was\nto relieve me, was overdue. Sister, discovering me still in the kitchen,\ninformed me that I might leave.\n\"You ain't 'ad any supper, 'ave you?\" said Mrs. Mappin. \"You won't get\nnone now, neither. Should 'ave done a bunk a full hower back, you\nshould.\"\nShe drew me into the larder, and indicated the debris of our patients'\nrepast. \"A leg of chicken and some rice pudden. Only wasted if _you_\ndon't 'ave it.\"\n\"But is it allowed--?\" I was, in truth, not only tired but ravenous.\nSister, entering upon this conspiratorial dialogue, unhesitatingly gave\nher approval.\nCold rice pudding and a left-over leg of chicken, eaten standing, at a\nshelf in a larder, can taste very good indeed, even to the wearer of a\nspick-and-span grey lounge suit. I shall know in future what it means\nwhen my restaurant waiter emerges from behind the screened service-door\nfurtively wiping his mouth. I sympathise. I too have wolfed the choice\nmorsels from the banquet of my betters.\nII\nLIFE IN THE ORDERLIES' HUTS\nIn May, 1915, when I enlisted, the weather was beautiful. Consequently\nthe row of tin huts, to which I was introduced as my future address \"for\nthe duration,\" wore an attractive appearance. The sun shone upon their\nmetallic sides and roofs. The shimmering foliage of tall trees, and a\nfine field of grass, which made a background to the huts, were fresh and\ngreen and restful to the eye. Even the foreground of hard-trodden\nearth--the barrack square--was dry and clean, betraying no hint of its\nquagmire propensities under rain. Later on, when winter came, the\ncluster of huts could look dismal, especially before dawn on a wet\nmorning, when the bugle sounding parade had dragged us from warm beds;\nor in an afternoon thaw after snow, when the corrugated eaves wept\ntorrents in the twilight, and one's feet (despite the excellence of army\nboots) were chilled by their wadings through slush. Meanwhile, however,\nthe new recruit had nothing to complain of in the aspect of the housing\naccommodation which was offered him. Merely for amusement's sake he had\noften \"roughed it\" in quarters far less comfortable than these bare but\nwell-built huts--which even proved, on investigation, to contain beds:\nan unexpected luxury.\n\"I'll put you in Hut 6,\" said the Sergeant-Major. \"There's one empty\nbed. It's the hut at the end of the line.\"\nThereafter Hut 6 was my home--and I hope I may never have a less\npleasant one or less good company for room-mates. In these latter I was\nperhaps peculiarly fortunate. But that is by the way. It suffices that\ntwenty men, not one of whom I had ever seen before, welcomed a total\nstranger, and both at that moment and in the long months which were to\nelapse before various rearrangements began to scatter us, proved the\nwarmest of friends.\nTwenty-one of us shared our downsittings and our uprisings in Hut 6.\nThere might have been an even number, twenty-two, but one bed's place\nwas monopolised by a stove (which in winter consumed coke, and in summer\nwas the repository of old newspapers and orange-peel). The hut,\naccordingly, presented a vista of twenty-one beds, eleven along one wall\nand ten along the other, the stove and its pipe being the sole\ninterruption of the symmetrical perspective. Above the beds ran a\ncontinuous shelf, bearing the hut-inhabitants' equipment, or at least\nthat portion of it--great-coat, water-bottle, mess-tin, etc.--not\ncontinually in use. Below each bed its owner's box and his boots were\ndisposed with rigid precision at an exact distance from the box and\nboots beneath the adjacent bed. In the ceiling hung two electric lights.\nThese, with the stove, beds, shelves, boxes and boots, constituted the\nentire furniture of the hut--unless you count an alarm-clock, bought by\npublic subscription, and notable for a trick of tinkling faintly, as\nthough wanting to strike but failing, in the watches of the night, hours\nbefore its appointed minute had arrived. The hut contained no other\nfurniture whatever, and in those days did not seem to us to require any.\nIn the autumn, when the daylight shortened and we could no longer hold\nour parliaments on a bench outside, a couple of deck-chairs were\nmysteriously imported; and, as the authorities remained unshocked, a\nsmall table also appeared and was squeezed into a gap beside the stove.\nSome sybarite even goaded us into getting up a fund for a strip of\nlinoleum to be laid in the aisle between the beds. This was done--I do\nnot know why, for personally I have no objection to bare boards. I\nsuppose linoleum is easier to keep clean than wood; and that aisle,\ntramped on incessantly by hobnail boots which in damp weather were, as\nto their soles and heels, mere bulbous trophies of the alluvial deposits\nof the neighbourhood, was sometimes far from speckless. But to me the\nstrip of linoleum made our hut look remotely like a real room in a real\nhouse: it was a touch of the conventional which I never cared for, and I\nonly subscribed to it when I had voted against it and been overborne. An\nextraordinary proposition, that we should inaugurate a plant in a pot\non the stove's lid in summer, was, I am glad to say, negatived. It would\nhave been the thin end of the wedge ... we might have arrived at\nJapanese fans and photograph-frames on the walls.\nNot that our Company Officer would have tolerated any nonsense of that\nkind. Punctually at eight-thirty, after the second parade of the day, he\nmarched through each hut, inspecting it and calling the attention of the\nSergeant-Major to any detail which offended his sense of fitness. On wet\nmornings, instead of parading outside, each man stood to his cot, and\nthus the comments of the Company Officer, as he went down the aisle,\nwere audible to all. Stiffly drawn up to attention, we wondered\nanxiously whether he would notice anything wrong with our buttons, boots\nor belts, or whether he would \"spot\" the books and jam jars hidden\nbehind our overcoats on the shelves. Nothing so decadent and civilian as\na book--and certainly nothing so unsightly as a jam jar--must be visible\non your barrack-room shelf. It is sacred to equipment, and particularly\nto the folded great-coat.\n\"The Art of Folding\" might have been the title of the first lesson of\nthe many so good-naturedly imparted to me by my new comrades. There was,\nI learnt, a right way and a wrong way to fold all things foldable. The\ngreat-coat, for instance, must at the finish of its foldings, when it is\nplaced upon the exactly middle spot above your bed's end, present to the\neye of the beholder a kind of flat-topped pyramid whose waist-line (if a\npyramid can be said to own a waist) is marked by the belt with the three\npolished buttons peeping through. The belt must bulge neither to the\nright nor to the left; the pyramidal edifice of great-coat must not\nloll--it must sit up prim and firm. And unless all your foldings of the\ngreat-coat, from first to last, have, been deftly precise, no pyramid\nwill reward you, but a flabby trapezium: the belt will sag, its buttons\nwon't come centrally, and indeed the whole edifice of unwieldy cloth\nwill topple off its perch on the narrow shelf--which was designed to\nrefuse all lodgment for the property of persons who had unsound ideas\non the subject of compact storage.\nThe second series of folderies to which the novice was initiated\nconcerned themselves with his bedding. This consisted of a mattress,\nthree blankets and a pillow. It is an outfit at which no one need turn\nup his nose. I never spent a bad night in army blankets, though when out\non leave I am sometimes a victim of insomnia between clean cold sheets.\nBut the moment the R\u00e9veill\u00e9 uplifted you from your couch, that couch had\nto be made ship-shape according to rule. No finicky \"airing\"! The\nmattress must be rolled up, with the pillow as its core, and placed at\nthe end of the bed. On top of it a blanket, folded longwise and with the\nends hanging down, was laid neatly; on top of _that_ you put the other\ntwo blankets, folded quite otherwise; then you brought the first\nblanket's ends over, and reversed the resultant bundle and pressed it\ndown into a thin stratified parallelogram with oval ends. The strata of\nthe said parallelogram, viewed from the aisle, must show no blanket\n_edges_, only curves of the blankets' folds: the edges (if visible at\nall) must face inwards, not outwards. Correct folding, to be sure, gave\nno visible edges, viewed from either side; and, once you caught the\nknack, correct folding was just as easy as incorrect--though there were\ntemperaments which did not find it so and which rebelled against these\nniceties.\nI was afterwards to learn that this mania for matching (if mania be\nindeed a legitimate word for a custom based on common-sense principles\nand seldom carried to the extremes which the recruit has been led to\nfear) obtains not only in the army but also in the nursing profession.\nNot long after I became a ward orderly I got a wigging from my \"Sister\"\nbecause I had not noticed that every pillow-case of a ward's beds must\nface towards the same point of the compass: the pillows on the vista of\nbeds must be placed in such a manner that the pillow-case mouths are,\nall of them, turned away from anyone entering the ward's door. Similarly\nthe overlap of the counterpanes must all be of exactly the same depth\nand caught up at exactly the same angle, the resulting series of pairs\nof triangles all ending at exactly the same spot in each bedstead. These\ntrifles reveal at a glance the professional touch in a ward, and are, I\nunderstand, not by any means the insignia of a military as distinct from\na civilian hospital. They may or may not contribute to the comfort of\nthe patient, but they betoken the captaincy of one whose methodicalness\nwill in other and less visible respects most emphatically benefit him.\nOur hut life was something more than a mere folding-up of bedding on\nbedsteads and great-coats on shelves. After midday dinner it was\nallowable to unroll the mattress, make the bed, and rest thereon--which\nmost of us by that time (having been on the run since 6 o'clock parade)\nwere very ready to do. There was half an hour to spare before 2 o'clock\nparade, and a precious half-hour it was. Snores rose from some of the\nbeds where students of the war had collapsed beneath the newspapers\nwhich they had meant to read. Desultory conversation enlivened those\ncorners where the denizens of the hut were energetic enough to polish\ntheir boots or sew on buttons. The one or two men who happened to be\n\"going out on pass\"--we were allowed one afternoon per week--were\nputting on their puttees and brushing-up the metal buttons of their\nwalking-out tunics (otherwise known as their Square Push Suits). The\nbuttons of their working tunics had of course been burnished before\nparade. The correct employment of button-sticks and of the magic cleaner\ncalled Soldier's Friend; the polishing of one's out-of-use boots and\ntheir placing, on the floor, with tied laces, and with their toes in\nline with the bed's legs; the substitution of lost braces' buttons by\n\"bulldogs\"; the furbishing of one's belt; the propping-up of the front\nof one's cap with wads of paper in the interior of the crown; the\ndevices whereby non-spiral puttees can be coaxed into a resemblance of\nspiral ones and caused to ascend in corkscrews above trousers which\nrefuse to tuck unlumpily into one's socks--these, and a host of other\nmatters, always kept a proportion of the hut-dwellers awake and busy and\nloquacious even in the somnolent post-prandial half-hour before 2\no'clock.\nBut it was at night, at bedtime, that the hut became generally sociable.\nLights-Out sounded at 10.15; and at 10.10 we were all scrambling into\nour pyjamas. In winter our disrobing was hasty; in summer it was an\naffair of leisure, and deshabille roamings to and fro in the aisle, and\ngossip. When the bugle blew and the electric lights suddenly ceased to\nglow, leaving the hut in a darkness broken only by the dim shapes of the\nwindows and the red of cigarette-ends, many of us still had to complete\nour undressing. We became adepts at doing this in the dark and so\ndisposing of the articles of our attire that they could be instantly\nretrieved in the morning. Once between the blankets, conversation at\nfirst waxed rather than waned. The Night Wardmaster, whose duty it was\nto make the round of the orderlies' huts, disapproved of conversation\nafter Lights-Out, and was apt to say so, loudly and menacingly, when he\nsurprised us by popping his head in at the door. But--well--the Night\nWardmaster always departed in the long run.... And then uprose, between\nbed and bed, those unconclusive debates in which the masculine soul\ndelighteth: Theology; Woman; Victuals; Politics; Art; the Press; Sport;\nMarriage; Money--and sometimes even The War; likewise the purely local\ntopics of Sisters and their Absurdities; Our Officers; The Other Huts;\nWhat the Sergeant-Major Said; Why V.A.D.'s can't replace Male Orderlies;\nWhat this Morning's Operations Looked Like; Whether an Officers' Ward or\na Men's Ward is the nicer; Who Deserves Stripes; C.O.'s Parade and its\nTerrors; Advantages of Volunteering for Night Duty; The Cushy Job of\nbeing in charge of a Sham Lunacy Case; Other Cushy Jobs less cushy than\nThey Sounded; and so forth; until at last protests began to be voiced by\nthe wearier folk who wanted silence.\nSilence it was, except for the thunder of occasional passing trains in\nthe near-by railway cutting. These had little power to disturb. Tucked\nin the brown army blankets, which at first sight look so hard and so\nprickly, we slumbered, the twenty-one of us, as one man; until, with a\ncruel jolt, at 5.15 that wretched alarm-clock crashed forth its summons\nfor the fastidious few who liked to rise in ample time to bath and shave\nbefore early parade. Sometimes I was of that virtuous band, and\nsometimes I wasn't; but, either way, I hated the alarm-clock at\n5.15,--though not so virulently as did those members of the hut who\nnever by any chance dreamt of rising until five to six. These gentry had\nreduced the ritual of dressing, and of rolling up their bedding, to a\nspeed at which it might almost be compared to expert juggling: the\nquickness of the hand deceived the eye. At five minutes to six you would\nsee the juggler asleep on his pillow, in blissful innocence; at six he\nwould be on parade, as correctly attired as you were yourself, and\nhaving left behind him, in the hut, a bed as neatly folded as yours. The\nworld is sprinkled with people who can do this kind of thing--and our\nhut was blessed with its due leaven of them. But I would not assert that\nthey _never_ had to put some finishing touches, either to their dress\nor to their hut equipment foldings, before the Company Officer's tour of\ninspection at 8.30. It sufficed that they would pass muster at 6\no'clock, when appearances are less minutely important. And the man who\nnever rises till 5.55 detests an alarm-clock that whirrs at 5.15. The\nhour at which the alarm-clock should be set to detonate was one of our\nfew acrimonious subjects of argument: I have even known it upset a\ndiscussion on Woman. But the early risers had their way, and the clock\ncontinued to be set for half an hour in front of R\u00e9veill\u00e9.\nThe harsh vibration of the alarm at one end of the day, and the expiry\nof the Lights-Out talks at the other--these events marked the chief\ntime-divisions in our hut life. While we were absent at work, our\ninterests were many and scattered; but the hut was a nucleus for\ncommunal bonds of union which evoked no little loyalty and affection\nfrom us all. On the May morning when I first beheld that corrugated-iron\nabode I thought it looked inviting enough; but I did not guess how fond\nI was to grow of its barn-like interior and of the sportive crew who\nshared its mathematically-allotted floor-space. \"Next war,\" one optimist\nsuggested during a typical Lights-Out s\u00e9ance, \"let's all enlist together\nagain.\" There were protests against the implied prophecy, but none\nagainst the proposition as such. That is the spirit of hut comradeship\n... a spirit which no alarm-clock controversies can do aught to impair;\nfor though 5.15 a.m. is an hour to test the temper of a troop of\ntwenty-one saints, 10.15 p.m. will bring geniality and garrulousness to\ntwenty-one sinners.\nIII\nWASHING-UP\nThe following substances (to which I had previously been almost a\nstranger) absorbed much of my interest during my first months as a\nhospital orderly:\nCoagulated pudding, mutton fat and beef fat, cold gravy, treacle,\ncongealed cocoa, suet duff, skins of once hot milk:\nPlates, cups, frying-pans and other utensils smeared with the above:\nKnives, forks and spoons, ditto.\nI am fated to go through life, in the future, not merely with an exalted\nopinion of scullery-maids--this I should not regret--but also with an\nonly too clear picture, when at the dinner table, of the adventures of\neach dish of broken meats on its exit from view. I have been behind the\nscenes at the business of eating, or rather, at the dreadful repairs\nwhich must be instituted when the business of eating is concluded in\norder that the business of eating may recommence.\nThere were days when the ward-kitchen was to me a battlefield and I\nseemed to be fighting on the losing side. This was when our scrub-lady\nwas ill or had \"got the sack\" and it fell to me, the orderly, to do the\nwashing-up single-handed. Those patients who were well enough to be on\ntheir feet were supposed to help. (I speak of a men's ward, of course,\nnot an officers'.) They did help, and that right willingly. Sometimes I\nwas blessed by the presence of a patient with a passion for cleaning\nthings. When there were no dishes to clean he would clean taps. When the\ntaps shone like gold he would clean the hooks on the dresser. When all\nour kitchen gear was clean he would invade, with a kind of fury, the\nsink-room and clean the apparatus there. When this was done he would\nclean the ward's windows and door handles. Between-times he would clean\nhis boots and shave patients in bed. The new army is thickly sown with\nmen like that. They are the salt of the earth. I would place them at the\nsummit of the commonwealth's salary list, the bank clerk second, and the\nbusiness man, the artist and the politician at the bottom. At all events\nthese were my sentiments when a patient of this type, convalescing,\nbegan to be able to help me with my kitchen chores. But it occasionally\nchanced that every single patient in the ward was confined to bed. It\nwas then that I made my most intimate acquaintance with the catalogue of\nhorrors I have cited.\nYou behold me, with my shirt-sleeves rolled up, faced by a heap of\ntwenty plates, twenty forks, twenty knives and twenty spoons, all\nurgently requiring washing. Were these my whole task I should not\nshrink. They would be nicely polished-off long ere one-fifteen\narrived--the time when I should (but probably shall not be able to)\nleave for my own meal in the orderlies' mess. But there are two far more\nserious opponents waiting to be subdued--the dinner-tin and the\npudding-basin. This pair are hateful beyond words. Their memory will\nfor ever haunt me, a spectral disillusionment to spoil the relish of\nevery repast I may consume in the years that are ahead.\nThe dinner-tin was a rectangular box some three feet long, twenty inches\nwide and six inches deep. It was made of solid metal, was fitted with a\nfalse bottom to contain hot water, and was divided internally into three\ncompartments to hold meat, vegetables and duff. These viands were loaded\ninto the tin at the hospital's central kitchen. I had naught to do with\nthe cookery--which I may mention always seemed to me to be excellent. My\nsole concern was with the helping-out of the food to the patients and\nthe restoration of the dinner-tin to its shelf in the central kitchen.\nFor unless I restored that tin in a faultless state of cleanliness, the\nsergeant in charge of the central kitchen would require my blood. The\ntin's number would betray me. The sergeant needed not to know my name:\nall he had to do, on discovering the questionable tin, was to glance at\nits number and then send for the orderly of the ward with a\ncorresponding number.\nHe was a sergeant whose aspect could be very daunting. I never had to\ncome before him on the subject of a dirty dinner-tin. But he and I had\nsome small passages concerning \"specials\" (separate diets ordered for\npatients requiring delicacies). Sometimes the necessary forms for the\nspecials had been incorrectly made out by a Sister with no head for army\naccuracy in minor clerical details. Thereafter it was my unlucky place\nto see the sergeant, and put the matter straight with him. I have\nsurvived those encounters. I have survived them with an enhanced respect\nfor the sergeant and the organisation of his large and by no means\nsimple department. There were moments, nevertheless, when I approached\nhis presence with a sinking heart. For if I failed to \"get round\" him in\nthe matter of coaxing another special for a patient, there was Sister to\nplacate on my return to the ward; and it was quite impossible to\npersuade Sister that she could have made a mistake with her diet sheets,\nor, if she had, that it was of any consequence.\nThe dinner-tin was somewhat larger than the sink in which I was supposed\nto wash it. It was also very heavy. When full of food, and its false\nbottom charged with hot water, I could only just lift it, and my\nprogress down the ward, carrying it from the trolley in the corridor to\nthe ward-kitchen, was a perilous and perspiring shuffle. As soon as all\nthe patients had been served I placed any left-over slices of meat in\nthe larder: these would be eaten at tea. Then I drained out the hot\nwater from the false bottom. Then (but only after experience had given\nme wisdom) I ran hot water from the geyser tap into the now empty meat,\nvegetable and duff compartments, and gave them a hurried swill: this to\nrid them of the pestilent dregs of fatty material which would otherwise\nhave dried and glued themselves to the floor of the tin. The latter had\nnow to be put on one side, for I must be back in the ward attending to\nmy diners. Only when they had finished their meal, and their bed-tables\nhad been removed, folded up and placed neatly behind each bed, could I\ntackle the tin in earnest.\nI abhor dabbling in grease; but life is full of abhorrent dilemmas which\nmust be endured; and the interior of that dinner-tin somehow got itself\ncleaned, every day, in the long run. During the early part of any given\nweek I was almost happy over the job. For Monday was \"Dry Store\" day. On\nMonday, and on Monday only--and you were helpless for the remainder of\nthe week if you forgot the rule--you could obtain, on presentation of a\nchit, blacklead for the stoves, metal-polish for the brass, rags for\ncleaning the floor, floor-polish, one box of matches, bath-brick, soft\nsoap, and--soda. It is an extraordinary chemical, soda. Before I became\na ward orderly I had no idea of the remarkable properties of soda. A\nhandful of soda in boiling water, and behold the grease dissolve meekly\nfrom the nastiest dinner-tin! It was miraculous. When a pitying\nscrub-lady first showed me the trick I thought that all my troubles were\nat an end. Soda made the ward-kitchen seem like heaven. Alas, the\nsupply of soda considered sufficient by the Dry Store authorities never\nlasted beyond Wednesday. On Thursday, Friday, Saturday and Sunday the\ndinner-tin had to be cleaned out not by alkaline agency, but by sheer\nslogging hard labour. And when at last I stood it on edge to dry, and\nthought to go off duty with a clear conscience, I generally found that I\nhad overlooked the waiting pudding-basin.\nOn the whole I am inclined to pronounce the pudding-basin a more\nobdurate utensil than even the dinner-tin. The pudding-basin, however,\nonly appeared every second morning. On duff days (duff being served in\nthe same tin as the meat and vegetables, though in a separate\ncompartment) we had no pudding. By pudding I mean milk pudding--rice or\nsago or tapioca. Now a milk pudding, such as those my patients received,\nthough perhaps it was looked askance at in the nursery, is food which,\nas an adult, I am far from despising. Rice pudding I have come with\nmaturer years to regard as a delicacy. Sago and tapioca I still eat\nrather with amiable resignation than from choice. But any milk pudding,\nas I now know, has a most vicious habit of cleaving to the dish in which\nit was cooked. Rice is the least evil offender. The others are\nabsolutely wicked. To clean oleaginous scum from a dinner-tin is not\neasy, but it is a mere bagatelle compared with cleaning the scorched\nhigh-tide-mark of tapioca or sago from the shores of a large metal\npudding-basin. I have tried scraping with a knife blade, I have tried\nevery reasonable form of friction, and I can simply state as a fact from\nmy own personal experience (perhaps I am unfortunate) that those metal\npudding-basins of ours would frequently yield to nothing less powerful\nthan sandpaper.\nI need scarcely say that sandpaper was not supplied by the deities of\nthe Dry Store. Sandpaper did not come within their purview. It had no\nrecognised use in hospital. Therefore it did not exist. But, observing\nthat a succession of metal pudding-basins would be an insupportable\nprospect without sandpaper, I laid in a stock of sandpaper, paying for\nthe same out of my own private purse. It was a cheap investment. Never\nhave earnings of mine been better spent. Moreover, having once hit on\nthe notion of giving myself a lift illegitimately, so to speak, I added\nto the smuggling-in of sandpaper a secret purchase of soda. Except that\nour scrub-ladies, each and all, discovering that the Dry Store's\nallowance of this priceless chemical had at last apparently been\ngenerous, caused it to fly at a disconcerting pace, and as a result\nsometimes left me short of it, my career as a washer-up afterwards\nbecame more comfortable.\nI shall never like washing-up. In the communal households of the future\nI shall heave coal, sift cinders, dig potatoes, dust furniture or scour\nfloors--any task will be mine which, though it makes me dirty, does not\nmake me greasily dirty. But if I must wash-up, if I must study the\nidiosyncrasies of cold fat, treacly plates, frying-pans which have\nsizzled dripping-toast on the gas-ring, frozen gravy, and pudding-basins\nwith burnt milk-skins filmed to their sides, I shall be comparatively\nundismayed. For sandpaper is not yet (like the news posters) abolished;\nand soda--although I hear its price has risen several hundred per\ncent.--is still cheaper than, say, diamonds.\nIV\nA \"HUT\" HOSPITAL\nPeople have curious ideas of the kind of building which would make a\ngood war hospital. \"The So-and-So Club in Pall Mall,\" I have been told,\n\"should have been commandeered long ago. Ideal for hospital purposes. Of\ncourse some of the M.P. members brought influence to bear, and the War\nOffice was choked off....\" And so forth.\nIt would surprise me to hear of anything that the War Office was held\nback from doing if it wanted to do it. Perhaps the least likely\nobstructionist to be successful in this project would be a\nclub-frequenting M.P. The War Office has taken exactly and precisely\nwhat it chose--even when it would have been better to choose otherwise.\nIn this matter of commandeering buildings for hospitals it may or may\nnot have acted with wisdom; but at least it has been safe in avoiding\nthe advice of the individual who jumps to the conclusion that just any\npleasingly-situated edifice will do, provided beds and nurses are\nshovelled into it in sufficient quantities.\nThe indignant patriot who was convinced that chicane alone saved the\nSo-and-So Club from being dedicated to the service of the wounded was\nquite unable to tell me whether the lifts--assuming that lifts\nexisted--were roomy enough to accommodate stretchers; whether, if so, no\ninterval of stairs prevented trollies from being wheeled to every ward;\nwhether the arrangement of the building would allow of the network of\nplumbing necessitated by the introduction of numerous bathrooms and\nlavatories (for each ward must possess both); whether the kitchens were\nso located that they could supply food to top-floor patients without\nwaste of carrying labour on the part of the orderlies' staff. These\nproblems, the mere fringe of the subject, had never occurred to our\npatriot. His idea of a hospital was a place where soldiers lie in bed\nand get well. (What queer notions visitors absorb of the _easiness_ of\nhospital life!) He had not glimpsed the organisation which made the cure\npossible. The man in bed, a Sister hovering in the background with,\napparently, nothing to do but look pleasant--these constituted, for him,\nthe final phenomena of a war hospital. These phenomena, instead of being\nhoused in a wood-and-corrugated-iron shed, might have been staged\npicturesquely in one of the luxurious salons of the So-and-So Club in\nPall Mall. It was a shame that they weren't. He would write to the\npapers about it. Somebody must be blamed, somebody must be made to\nhustle. And meanwhile the Sisters and doctors who _were_ installed in\ngorgeous mansions for their work were openly envying the fortunate ones\nwho had been given those bare but efficient and compactly-planned sheds.\nSome years ago a number of public buildings were earmarked for hospital\nuse in case of war. It may surprise the indignant patriots to learn that\nany preparations whatever were made prior to the outbreak in 1914.\nNevertheless all kinds of preparations actually were made. Mistakes and\nmiscalculations may have marred those preparations: the fact remains\nthat, as far as the Territorial Medical Service was concerned, the\nauthorities had merely to press a button and hospitals came into\nexistence. Thus a number of institutions--mostly schools--found\nthemselves ejected from their own roof-trees: found, in short, (what\nmany other folk were to learn later) that the State is omnipotent in\nwar-time and that sectional interests fade into insignificance compared\nwith the interests of the safety of the commonwealth. Some conception of\nthe promptness with which this paper scheme of Sir Alfred Keogh's\nmaterialised at the outbreak of war may be gathered from the simple\nstatement that the building of which I myself write was an Orphans' Home\non August 4th, 1914. At 6 a.m. on August 5th it was a military hospital.\nI do not say that it was a military hospital in working order. But if,\nby a miracle, wounded _had_ turned up then, there was at least a staff\nof medical officers and orderlies on the premises to receive them. In\npoint of fact it was some weeks before the first patients arrived. Those\nweeks, however, were not idle ones. The layman who considers that any\nlarge building can be turned instantaneously into a hospital would have\nhad an eye-opener if he had witnessed the work done here. The mere\nremoving of 95 per cent. of the institution's furniture was a colossal\ntask; added thereto was the introduction of hundreds of beds, hundreds\nof mattresses, hundreds of sets of bedclothes, hundreds of suits of\npyjamas, hundreds of--But why prolong a brain-racking list? Then there\nwas the pulling-down and fixing-up of partitions, the removal of every\nsingle window for replacement by Hopper sashes, the fitting-in of\nbathrooms, lavatories, ward-kitchens, sink-rooms, dispensary, cookhouse,\noperating-theatre, pathological laboratory, linen-store, steward's\nstore, clothing-store, detention-room, administration offices, X-ray\ndepartment ... all these in a building which, spacious and handsome\noutwardly, was, as to its interior, a characteristic maze in the\nScottish baronial style of architecture beloved by mid-Victorian\nphilanthropists. How the evicted orphans will like to return to those\nstone-flagged passages and large airy dormitories, after having\nexperienced the comforts of the banal but snug suburban villas in which\nthey are at present located, I know not. There is a certain dignity\nabout the Scottish baronial pile, I admit. The silhouette of its grey\nstone fa\u00e7ade, rising above delightful lawns, makes a good\nimpression--from a distance. Postcard views of it sell freely to\nvisitors. But the best part of our hospital is hidden behind that\nturreted fa\u00e7ade, and is much too \"ugly\" and utilitarian for postcard\nimmortalisation.\nThe best part of our hospital--_the_ hospital, to most of us--came into\nbeing when the commandeered Scottish baronial orphans' asylum was found\nto be too small. Then were built \"the huts.\"\nThe word \"hut\" suggests something casual, of the camping-out order: a\nshed knocked together with tin-tacks, doubtfully weather-proof and\nprobably scamped by profiteering contractors. Of the huts provided at\ncertain training centres this may have been true. The finely austere\nand efficient ranks of hut-wards which constitute the main part of the\n3rd London General Hospital are the very antithesis of that picture.\nThey may look flimsy. They were certainly put up at a remarkable pace. I\nmyself witnessed the erection of the final fifty of them. An open field\nvanished in less than a month, and \"Bungalow Town\" (as someone nicknamed\nit) appeared. You would have said that such speed meant countless\nimperfections of detail. No doubt some tinkerings and modifications were\nbound to follow, when the regiment of workmen, carpenters, engineers,\ndrainage specialists, electricians, had vanished. But, in the long run,\nthe ideal hospital remained--a hospital with which the So-and-So Club in\nPall Mall, for all its luxuriousness, could never hope to compare.\nThere are still a dozen wards--used mostly for medical cases--in the\nScottish baronial building. Its rooms, too, provide the Administration\nwith offices. Its great Dining Hall is a splendid Receiving Ward for the\nsorting-out and clearance of newly-arrived convoys of patients. We\nshould be poorly situated indeed if we had not our Scottish baronial\nmain building to be the hub of the hospital's activities, or rather the\nhandle from which springs the fan of the hospital's great extension--the\nhuts. Approaching the hospital the visitor sees nothing of those huts.\nAs he walks up the drive he flatters himself that he has reached his\ndestination. He discovers his mistake when, at the inquiry bureau in the\nentrance, he is informed that the patient whom he has come to interview\nis (say) in \"C 13.\" He is advised to go down the passage on his left,\nturn to his right, turn to the left again and then again to the\nright--after which he had better seek a further re-direction. Launching\nhimself optimistically on this voyage he learns, long ere he has\nattained his goal, that a modern war-hospital can hide a considerable\nextent of pedestrianism behind a comparatively short Scottish baronial\nfrontage. He will be fortunate if five minutes' steady tramping brings\nhim to the bedside of his friend in C 13.\nPerhaps he will content himself in his footsoreness by noting that, to\nreach C 13, he has not had to go up or down any stairs. This is one of\nthe beauties of the hut system. It consumes a big area, but it is all\non one level--the ground level. The patient on crutches can go anywhere\nwithout fear of tripping, the patient in a wheeled chair can propel\nhimself anywhere, the orderlies can push wheeled stretchers or\ndinner-wagons anywhere. Our visitor for C 13, having escaped from the\nback of the Scottish baronial building, emerges into a vista of covered\ncorridors, wooden-floored, galvanised-iron roofed. It is a heartbreaking\nvista to the poor woman who has had no bus-fare and is burdened by a\nbaby in arms. It is a vista which seems to have no end. Corridor\nbranches out of corridor--A Corridor, B Corridor, C Corridor, D\nCorridor, each with its perspective of doors opening into wards; and\nshorter corridors leading to store-rooms and the like. But the patient\nor orderly who has dwelt in a hospital where, though distances are\nshorter, staircases are involved--or where every trifling\ncoming-and-going of goods or stretchers necessitates the manipulation of\na lift--blesses those level, smooth corridors, with their facile access\nto any ward, to operating theatres, kitchens, stores, X-ray room,\nmassage department, etc., and their stepless exit into the open air.\nLooked at from outside, a hut-ward is--to the \u00e6sthetic eye--a hideous\nstructure. Knowing what it stands for, the science, the tenderness and\nthe fundamental civilisation which it represents, we may descry, behind\nits stark geometrical outlines, a real nobility and beauty. Entering a\ntypical hut-ward you behold thirty beds, fifteen on each side of the\nroom. Between each pair of beds is a locker in which the patient stows\nhis belongings. (Woe betide him if his locker is not kept neat!) In the\ncentral aisle of the room are the Sister's writing-table, certain other\ntables, chairs, and two coke stoves for heating purposes in winter. The\nfloor is carpetless, and maintained in a meticulous state of high gloss\nby means of daily polishings. At a height of a few feet from the floor,\nthe asbestos-lined walls cease and become windows. There is no gap in\nthe continuous line of windows all down each side of the ward--a special\ntype of window which, even when open, declines to allow rain to enter.\nIn consequence of these windows the ward is not only very well lit, but\nalso airy and odourless. When all the windows are open (which is the\ncase throughout the entire summer and generally the case in winter also)\nthe patient has the advantages of indoor comfort plus an outdoor\natmosphere. At the end of the ward a covered verandah is spacious enough\nto take an extra couple of beds for those requiring completely open-air\ntreatment.\nThe ward proper has certain additions: a kitchen with gas-stove and\ngeyser; a sink-room with geyser and cleansing apparatus of special\npattern; a bathroom with geyser; lavatories; a small room for the\nisolation of a patient on the danger-list; a linen-room; and cupboards.\nAll these are packed neatly under that one rectangular corrugated roof\nwhich looked so ugly and so unpromising from outside.\nDo not pity the wounded soldier because he is quartered in a \"hut.\" The\nword sounds unattractive. But if it is the right kind of hut, he is in\nthe soundest and most sanitary type of temporary hospital that the mind\nof man has yet devised. The rain-drops may rattle a shade noisily on the\nroof, the asbestos lining may be devoid of ornamentation, but as he\nlies in bed and contemplates that unadorned ceiling he is a deal better\noff than if he were gazing at the elaborate (and dust-harbouring)\ncornices of the So-and-So Club's grandiose smoking-lounge in Pall Mall.\nV\nFROM THE \"D\" BLOCK WARDS\nIf you walk up the corridor at half-past four on certain afternoons of\nthe week you will meet a mob of patients trooping from their wards to\nthe concert-room. Being built of wood and corrugated iron, the corridor\nis an echoing cave of noises. It echoes the tramp of feet--and\narmy-pattern boots were not soled for silence. It echoes the thud-thud\nof crutches. It echoes the slurred rumble of wheeled chairs and\nstretcher-trollies. But, above all, at half-past four on concert days it\nechoes happy talk and chaff and boisterous laughter.\nAs often as not, the loudest talk, the cheeriest chaff, the most\nspontaneous laughter, emanate from the blue-clad stalwarts who have\nmustered from the \"D\" Block wards.\n\"D\" Block contains the wards for eye-wound cases.\nHere they come, a string of them, mostly with bandages round their\nheads. The leading man owns one good eye--a twinkling eye--an eye of\nmischief--an eye (you would guess at once) for the girls. (But the eye's\nowner probably calls them the \"pushers.\" Such is our language now.)\nBehind him, in single file, and in step with him, march a gang of\npatients each with his hand on the shoulder of the man in front. Tramp,\ntramp! Their tread is purposely thunderous on the bare boards of the\ncorridor. They sing as they advance. It is a ragtime chorus whose most\nmemorable line runs, \"You never seem to kiss me in the same place\ntwice.\" A jaunty lilt, to be sure, both in tune and in rhythm. Tramp,\ntramp! The one-eyed leader swerves round a corner, roaring the refrain.\nHis followers swerve too. Suddenly the Matron is encountered, emerging\nfrom her room. \"Fine afternoon, Matron!\" The leader interrupts his chant\nto utter this hearty greeting. And, with one voice, \"Fine afternoon,\nMatron!\" exclaim his followers. But they do not turn their heads. Each\nwith his hand resting on the shoulder of the man in front they go\nsteadily on, towards the concert-room, with an odd intentness, glancing\nneither to one side nor the other. For though, at their leader's cue,\nthey have hailed the Matron, they have not seen her. They are blind.\nThe spectacle of men--particularly young men--who have given their sight\nfor their country is, to most observers, a moving one. Melancholy are\nthe reflections of the visitor who meets, for the first time, a\npromenading party of our blind patients. It is the plain truth,\nnevertheless, that the blind men themselves are far from melancholy. One\nof the rowdiest characters we ever had in the hospital was totally\nblind. The blind men's wards are notoriously amongst the least sedate. I\noffer no explanation. I simply state the fact. I will fortify it by an\nanecdote.\nIt came to pass that eight complimentary tickets for a Queen's Hall\nmatin\u00e9e were received by the Matron, who in due course allotted them to\nseven \"D\" Block patients. An orderly, detailed to take them to the\nhall, completed the octette. Corporal Smith, the orderly in question,\nrecounted his adventures afterwards. \"Never again,\" quoth he, \"shall I\njump at a matin\u00e9e job if there are blind chaps in the party. They're the\ndeuce.\"\nYou must understand that we hospital orderlies regard the task of\nshepherding patients to an entertainment in town as an agreeable form of\nholiday. I have had some very pleasant outings of that sort myself. But\nnot--I am thankful to recall, in the light of Corporal Smith's\nnarrative--with blind men. One-legged men are often a sufficient care,\nin manoeuvring on and off omnibuses. Apparently helpless cripples have\na marvellous gift for losing themselves, entering wrong trains, and\ngenerally escaping--as the hour for return draws nigh--from one's\ncustody. And the city seems to be full of lunatics ready to supply\nalcohol or indigestible refreshments to the most delicate war-hospital\ninmates. Even with ordinary patients the orderly's afternoon excursion\nis sometimes not unfraught with anxiety. But blind patients, as Corporal\nSmith said, are the deuce.\nOut of his party, four were totally blind, two could recognise dimly\nthe difference between light and darkness, and one had a single good\neye.\nQueen's Hall was reached, by bus, without mishap. After the performance\nthere was tea at an A.B.C. shop. Here Jock, one of the totally blind\nmen, a Scotchman--all Scots are \"Jocks\" in the army--distinguished\nhimself by faceti\u00e6 (audible throughout the whole shop) on the English\npronunciation of the word 'scone,' and intimated his desire to treat the\ncompany to a ballad. This project was suppressed, but \"a silly fool in a\ntop hat threatened to report me for having given my men drink,\" said\nCorporal Smith. \"Jock gave _him_ the bird, not 'arf. But I thought it\nabout time to be going home.\"\nSo the party prepared to go home.\nThe bus was voted dull. Somebody suggested the tube. Corporal Smith\nconsented.\nHe had forgotten that at Oxford Circus station the lifts have been\nabolished in favour of sliding staircases. Confronted by the escalator,\nCorporal Smith halted his party and informed them that they must walk\ndown by the ordinary stair. The escalator was not safe for blind men.\nUnfortunately, Jock had sniffed a lark; the one-eyed man backed him up;\nthe party--elated perhaps by their tea--would not hear of anything so\nhumdrum as a descent by the ordinary stair. They were going on the\nsliding stair. They insisted. Corporal Smith argued in vain. In vain he\nexerted his (purely nominal) authority. His charges mocked him. The\none-eyed man leading, with Jock in his wake, they launched themselves at\nthe sliding stair. In sheer desperation Corporal Smith brought up the\nrear, supporting two of the more timid venturers as best he might. None\nof the group except Corporal Smith himself, as it turned out, had ever\ntravelled on an escalator before. But they had heard a comic song about\na sliding stair, and they wished--Jock especially--to sample this\nmetropolitan invention.\nBy dodging forward to place each blind man's hand upon the banister,\nCorporal Smith managed to send off his patients without a stumble. But\nas the stair inexorably lowered them into the bowels of the earth he\nrealised, only too vividly, what might happen at the foot of the\ndescent. The evening rush of suburb-bound passengers had begun and the\nstaircase was rather crowded. Nobody seemed to realise that the\nkhaki-overcoated men who stood so still upon the steps were not the\nusual hospital convalescents out on leave and able to look after\nthemselves. Corporal Smith, delayed by one man who had hesitated at the\ntop before taking the plunge, beheld his charges below him, hopelessly\ndotted, at intervals, amongst the general public. It was impossible for\nhim to struggle down ahead, to the bottom of the staircase, to guide the\nmen off as they arrived. This task, he hoped, would be adequately\nperformed by the one-eyed man.\nIt might have been. The one-eyed man was game for anything. But Jock,\narriving in the highest good humour at the bottom of the staircase, was\ntilted sideways by the curve, and promptly sat down on the\nlanding-place. Instead of rising, he proclaimed aloud that this was\nfunnier even than England's pronunciation of the word 'scone.'\nWhereupon various hurrying passengers, including an old lady, tripped\nover his prone form. The sensation of being kicked and sat upon appealed\nto Jock's sense of humour. The more people avalanched across him the\nmore comic he thought it. And in a moment there was quite a pile of\nwriggling bodies on top of him. For though the public managed on the\nwhole to leap over, or circumvent, the obstacle presented by Jock's\nextremely large body, none of his blind comrades did so.\n\"Every single one of them fell flop,\" said Corporal Smith; \"I give you\nmy word.\"\nBut were they downhearted? No! They regarded this mysterious hurly-burly\nof arms and legs as a capital jest. So far from being alarmed or\nannoyed, they shouted with glee. The old lady, who had gathered herself\ntogether and was directing a stream of voluble reproof at Corporal Smith\nfor his \"callousness and cruelty to these unhappy blind heroes,\" retired\ndiscomfited. Jock's comments routed her more effectively than the\nCorporal's assurance that the episode was none of his choosing.\nThe party at last sorted itself out and was placed upon its feet once\nmore. It was excessively pleased with its exploit. Hilarity reigned.\nCorporal Smith, relieved, made ready to conduct his squad to the\nplatform.\nAlas, a bright idea occurred to Jock. Why not go up the other sliding\nstair and down again?\nAgreed, _nem. con._ At least, Corporal Smith's _con._ was too futile to\nbe worth counting.\n\"I had to go with the blighters,\" said he. \"There was no end of a crowd\nby this time. And Jock and some of the others fell over at the top\nagain. And there was a row with the ticket-collector. And people kept\nsaying they'd report me. _Me!_ And when I'd got my party down to the\nbottom for the second time, and some of the tube officials had come and\nsaid they couldn't allow it and we must buzz off home, I lined the\nfellows up to march 'em to the train, and dash me if two weren't\nmissing. They'd given me the slip.\"\nThe two truants, it may be added, could not be found. Corporal Smith\nhad to return without them. At a late hour of the evening they appeared,\nnot an atom repentant, at the hospital, having persuaded someone to put\nthem into the correct bus. One of them, Jock, explained that, being from\nthe North, he had desired to seize this opportunity of seeing the sights\nof London. Jock, I may remind you, is totally blind. Jock's guide, the\nman who had volunteered to show him the sights and who had only once\nbeen in London before, could see very faintly the difference between\nlight and dark.... Thus this pair of irresponsibles had fared forth into\nthe dusk of Regent Street.\n*       *       *       *       *\nIt sounds a very horrible fate to be blinded. But somehow the blind men\nthemselves seldom seem to be overwhelmed by its horribleness. If you\nwant to hear the merriest banter in a war hospital, visit the blind\nmen's wards. The pathos of them lies less in the sadness of the victims\nthan in the triumphant, wonderful fact that they are _not_ sad. I wish\nwe others all inhabited the same mysteriously jocund spiritual realm as\nJock and his comrades, who come tramp-tramping to the concert-room down\nthe corridor from the D wards.\nVI\nWHEN THE WOUNDED ARRIVE\nThe receiving hall of the hospital is its clearing house of patients. It\nis a huge room, with a lofty and echoing roof, a little in the style of\na church. Before the war, when the building was a school, this rather\ngrandiose apartment no doubt witnessed speechifyings and prize\ndistributions. May the time be not far distant when it will once again\nbe used for those observances! Meanwhile its vast floor is occupied by\nranks of beds.\nThose beds are generally untenanted. Visitors who, like the lady in the\nplay, have taken the wrong turning, are apt to find themselves in the\nreceiving hall, and, gazing at its array of vacant beds, have been known\nto conclude that the hospital was empty. (As if any war-hospital, in\nthese times, could be empty!) But our patients have only a short\nacquaintanceship with the receiving-hall beds: these beds are momentary\nresting-places on their journey healthwards: they are not meant to lie\nin but to lie _on_. The three-score wards for which the receiving hall\nis the clearing house are the real destination of the patients; down\nlong corridors, in wards far cosier because less ornate than this, the\npatient will find \"his\" bed ready for him, the bed which he is not to\nlie on but _in_.\nWe orderlies meet each convoy at the front door of the hospital. The\nwalking-cases are the first to arrive--men who are either not ill\nenough, or not badly enough wounded, to need to be put on stretchers in\nambulances. They come from the station in motor-cars supplied by that\nindefatigable body, the London Ambulance Column. The walking-case\nalights from his car, is conducted into the receiving hall, and ten\nminutes later is in the bathroom. For the ritual of the bath must on no\naccount be omitted--although now not so obviously imperative as in the\nearly period of the war. Few patients reach us who have not first\nsojourned, either for a day or two or for weeks, in hospitals in France.\nThey are therefore merely travel-stained, as you or I might be\ntravel-stained after coming over from Dublin to Euston. The bath is thus\na pleasure more than a necessity. Whereas there _was_ an era, when our\nguests came straight from only too populous trenches....\n\"O.C. Baths,\" as the bathroom orderly was nicknamed, had to be\ncircumspect in the performance of his job.\nThe few minutes which the walking-case spends in the receiving hall are\noccupied (1) in drinking a cup of cocoa, and (2) in \"having his\nparticulars taken.\"\nPoor soul!--he is weary of giving his \"particulars.\" He has had to give\nthem half-a-dozen times at least, perhaps more, since he left the front.\nAt the field dressing-station they wanted his particulars, at the\nclearing-station, on the train, at the base hospital, on another train,\non the steamer, on the next train, and now in this English hospital. As\nhe sits and comforts himself with cocoa, a \"V.A.D.\" hovers at his\nelbow, intent on a printed sheet, the details of which she is rapidly\nfilling-in with a pencil. For this is a card-index war, a colossal\nbusiness of files and classifications and ledgers and statistics and\nregistrations, an undertaking on a scale beside which Harrod's and\nWhiteley's and Selfridge's and Wanamaker's and the Magazin du Louvre,\nall rolled into one, would be a fleabite of simplicity. Ere the morrow\nshall have dawned, our patient's military biography will be recounted,\nby various clerks, in I don't know how many different entries. If you\nare curious, refer to one of our volumes of the _Admission and Discharge\nBook: Field Service Army Book 27a_. Open it at any of its\nclosely-written pages and see the host of ruled columns which the\norderly in charge of it must inscroll with reference to each of the many\nthousands of patients who pass through our hospital per annum. The\ncolumns ask for his Regiment; Squadron, Battery or Company; Number;\nRank; Surname; Christian Name; Age; Length of Service; Completed Months\nwith Field Force; Diseases (wounds and injuries are expressed by a\nnumber indicating their nature and whereabouts); Date of Admission; Date\nof Discharge or Transfer; Number of Days under Treatment; Number of\nWard; Religion; and \"Observations\"--a space usually occupied by the name\nof the hospital ship upon which our friend crossed the Channel, and the\nname of the convalescent home to which he went on bidding us adieu.\nHaving furnished the preliminary statements which lay the foundation of\nthis compendious memoir, the walking-case thankfully finishes his cocoa,\npicks up the package of \"blues\" which has been put at his side, and\ndeparts, with his fellows, to the bathroom. Here he is tackled by the\nPack Store orderlies, who take from him, and enter in their books, his\nkhaki clothes. These he must leave in exchange for the blue slop uniform\nwhich, _pro tem._, is to be his only wear. When he emerges from the\nbathroom he is attired in what is now England's most honourable\nlivery--the royal blue of the war-hospital patient. And (though perhaps\nthe matter is not mentioned to him in so many words) his own suit is\nalready ticketed with an identification label and on its way to the\nfumigator. This is no reflection on the owner of the suit ... but there\nare some things we don't talk about. Mr. Fumigator-Wallah is not the\nleast busy of the more retiring members of a war-hospital staff. He is\nnot in the limelight; but you might come to be very sad and sorry if he\ntook it into his head to neglect his unapplauded part off-stage.\nThe walking-cases are still splashing and dressing in the bathroom when\nthe ambulances with the cot-cases begin to appear. Now is the orderlies'\nbusy time. Each stretcher must be quickly but gently removed from the\nambulance and carried into the receiving hall.\nFour orderlies haul the stretcher from its shelf in the ambulance; two\norderlies then take its handles and carry it indoors. At the entrance to\nthe receiving hall they halt. The Medical Officer bends over the\npatient, glances at the label which is attached to him, and assigns him\nto a ward. (Certain types of cases go to certain groups of wards.) The\nattendant sergeant promptly picks a metal ticket from a rack and lays\nit on the stretcher. The ticket has, punched on it, the number of the\npatient's ward and the number of the patient's bed in that ward. This\nceremony completed, the orderlies proceed, with their burden, up the\naisle between the beds in the receiving hall.\nArrived at the bed, they lower their stretcher until it is at such a\nlevel that the patient, if he is active enough, can move off it on to\nthe bed; if he is too weak to help himself he is lifted on to the bed by\norderlies under the direction of the receiving-hall Sister. The\nstretcher is promptly removed and restored to its ambulance. If the\npatient is in an exceptionally suffering condition he is not placed on\nthe receiving-hall bed; instead--the Medical Officer having given his\npermission--his stretcher is put on a wheeled trolley and he is taken\nstraight away to his ward, so that he will only undergo one shift of\nposition between the ambulance and his destination. The majority of\nstretcher-cases, however, reach us in a by no means desperate state,\nfor, as I say, they seldom come to England without having been treated\npreviously at a base abroad (except during the periods of heavy\nfighting). And it is remarkable how often the patient refuses help in\ngetting off the stretcher on to the bed. He may be a cocoon of bandages,\nbut he will courageously heave himself overboard, from stretcher to bed,\nwith a gay _wallop_ which would be deemed rash even in a person in\nperfect health. Our receiving hall, at a big intake of wounded, when\nevery bed bears its poor victim of the war, presents a spectacle which\nmight give the philosopher food for thought; but I suspect that, if he\nregarded its actualities rather than his own preconceptions, what would\nimpress him more than the sadness would be on the one hand the\nkindliness, brisk but not officious, of the staff, and on the other the\nspontaneous geniality of the battered occupants of the beds. The\norderlies can spare little time for talk, but the few chats which they\nare able to have with patients whom they are helping to change their\nclothes, or to whom they are proffering the inevitable cocoa (which is\na cocktail, as it were, prior to the meal which will be served in the\nmen's own ward), are punctuated by jokes and laughter rather than the\nlong-visaged \"sympathy\" which the outsider might--quite wrongly!--have\npictured as appropriate to such an assemblage.\nThe stretcher-case, before he is taken to his ward, must also \"give his\nparticulars,\" must also be interviewed by the Pack Store officials, and\nmust also have assigned to him his blue uniform (wherewith are a shirt,\na cravat, slippers and socks) in anticipation of the time when he shall\nbe able to use his feet again and promenade our corridors and grounds.\nHe receives the customary packet of cigarettes (probably the second, for\nhe often gets one at the railway station too), and then, on another\nstretcher, mounted on a trolley, is wheeled off to his ward. Here,\nbestowed in bed at last, we leave him to his blanket-bath, his meal, his\ntemperature-taking and chart filling-in by the Sister, his visit from\nthe doctor, and all the rest of it. For the moment we see no more of\nhim; we must race back to the receiving hall, and, if there are no more\npatients to take away, return the trolley to its proper nook, put\nstraight the blankets and pillows on the beds, sweep the floor, and tidy\nup generally, in readiness for the next convoy's advent.\nPresently the huge room, beneath its dim arched ceiling, is silent and\nempty once more. The four ranks of beds, without a crease on their brown\nblankets, are bare of occupants. The Sister and her probationers have\nvanished. The Pack Store orderlies have carried off their loot of dirty\nkhaki tunics and trousers for the fumigator. The clerical V.A.D.'s have\ngone to enter \"particulars\" in ledgers and card-indices. The cookhouse\npeople have removed their cocoa urn. The sergeant is inspecting the\nmetal ward-tickets left in his rack. A glance at them tells him how many\nbeds, and which beds, are free in the hospital; for the tickets have no\nduplicates; any given ticket can only reappear in the rack when the bed\nwhich it connotes is out of use and awaiting a newcomer; the ticket\nhangs from a nail in the wall beside the patient's bed just so long as\nthat bed is tenanted. So the rack of metal tickets might almost take the\nplace of that important document, of which a freshly-compiled edition is\ntyped every morning, the Empty Bed List; and the sergeant is meditative\nas he sorts into the rack the tickets which have newly been sent in from\nthe Sisters of wards where there have been departures. \"Not much room in\nthe eye-wound wards,\" he ponders; or, \"A lot of empties in the\nmedicals.\" And then ... the tinkle of the telephone....\n\"Another convoy expected at 6.15? Twenty walking-cases and seventeen\ncots. Right you are!\"\nAnd at 6.15 the party of orderlies will be back again at the front door,\nagain the motor-cars will stream up the drive, again the ambulances will\ncome with their stretchers, and again the receiving hall will awaken\nfrom its interlude of silence to echo with the activities incidental to\na clearing house of those damaged human bundles which are the _raison\nd'\u00eatre_ of our great war-hospital.\nVII\n\"T.... A....\"\nWar-hospital patients are of many sorts. It is a common mistake of the\narm-chair newspaper devourer to lump all soldiers together as quaint,\nbibulous, aitch-dropping innocents, lamblike and gauche in\ndrawing-rooms, fierce and picturesque on the field, who (to judge by\ntheir published photographs) are continually on the grin and continually\nshaking hands either with each other or with equally grinsome French\npeasant women at cottage doors or with the local mayor who congratulates\nthem on the glorious V.C.'s which, of course, they are continually\nwinning. In a war hospital that harbours many thousands of patients per\nannum, we should know, in the long run, something about the\ncharacteristics of Tommy Atkins; and it is with resentment that I hear\nhim thus classified as a mere type. He is not a type. Discipline and\ntraining have given him some veneer of generalised similarities. Beneath\nthese, Tommy Atkins is simply the man in the street--any man in any\nstreet; and if you look out of your window in the city and see a throng\nof pedestrians upon the pavement you might just as well say that because\nthey are all civilians they are all alike as that, because all soldiers\nwear khaki, they are all alike.\nI have a quarrel with the Press on the score of its persistent fostering\nof this notion that \"our gallant lads\" (as the sentimental scribe calls\nthem) are a pack of children about whose exploits an unfailing stream of\nsemi-pathetic, semi-humorous anecdotes must be put forth. Even the old\nprofessional army exhibited no dead level either of blackguards on the\none hand or humble Galahads on the other. But whatever may have been the\ncase before the war, all the armies of Europe are now alike in this,\nthat they are composed of civilians who merely happen to have adopted a\ncertain garb for the performance of a certain job--and, be it remarked,\na temporary job. That garb has not reduced the citizens, who have the\nhonour to wear it, to a monotonous level either of intelligence or of\nconduct: nor even of opinions about the war itself. I have had\nfire-eaters in my ward who breathed the sentiments of _John Bull_ and\nthe _Evening News_, and I have had pacifists (they seemed to have fought\nno less bravely) who, week by week, read and approved Mr. Snowden in the\n_Labour Leader_; I have had Radicals and Tories, and patients who cared\nfor neither party, but whose passion was cage-birds or boxing or amateur\nphotography; I have had patients who were sulky and patients who were\nbright, patients who were unlettered and patients who were educated,\npatients who could hardly express themselves without the use of an\nensanguined vocabulary and patients who were gently spoken and\nfastidious. Each of them was Tommy Atkins--the inanely smirking hero of\nthe picture-paper and the funny paragraph. Neither his picture nor the\nparagraph may be positively a lie, and yet, when the arm-chair dweller\nchucklingly draws attention to them, I am tempted to relapse into\nirreverence and utter one or other (or perhaps both) of two phrases\nwhich T. Atkins is himself credited with using _ad nauseam_--\"Na-poo\"\nand \"I _don't_ think.\"\nWhen I assert--as I do unhesitatingly assert--that no one could work in\na war-hospital ward for any length of time without an ever-deepening\nrespect and fondness for Tommy Atkins, it is the same thing as asserting\nthat the respect and fondness are evoked by close contact with one's\ncountrymen: nothing more nor less. A hospital ward is a haphazard\nselection of one's fellow-Britons: the most wildly haphazard it is\npossible to conceive. And the pessimistic cynic who, after a sojourn in\nthat changing company for a month or two can still either generalise\nabout them or (if he does) can still not acknowledge that in the mass\nthey are amazingly lovable, is beyond hope. The war has taught its\nlessons to us all, and none more important than this. For myself I\nconfess that I never knew before how nice were nine out of ten of the\nindividuals with whom I sat silent in trains, whom I glanced at in\nbusiness offices or behind counters, whom I saw in workshops or in the\nfield or who were my neighbours in music-halls. They were strangers. In\nthe years to come I hope they will be strangers no longer. For they and\nI have dressed alike and borne the same surname--Atkins.\nOf course, there remain a few generalisations which _can_ safely be\nrisked about even so nondescript a person as the new Tommy Atkins. As\npractically all the Tommy Atkinses are, at this moment, concentrated on\nthe prosecution of one great job, it is natural that their main\ninterests should revolve round that job. They all (for instance) want\nthe job to be finished. They all (within my experience) want it to be\nfinished well. They nearly all desire earnestly to cease soldiering as\nsoon as the job _is_ finished well. I never yet met the man (though he\nmay exist, outside the brains of the scribes aforementioned) who, having\ntasted the joys of roughing it, is determined not to return to a humdrum\ndesk in an office: on the contrary, that office and that humdrum desk\nhave now become this travelled adventurer's most roseate dream. I have\nconversed with patients drawn from nearly every walk in life, and I do\nnot remember one who definitely spoke of refusing to go back to his\nformer work--if he could get it.\nOne of my patients had been a subterranean lavatory attendant. You would\nhave thought his ambitions--after visits to Egypt, Malta, the\nDardanelles and France--might have soared to loftier altitudes. He had\nsurvived hair-raising adventures; he had taken part in the making of\nhistory; although wounded he had not been incapacitated for an active\ncareer in the future; and he was neither illiterate nor unintelligent.\nYet he told me, with obvious satisfaction, that his place was being kept\nopen for him. I was, as it were, invited to rejoice with him over the\ndestiny which was his. I may add that the singular revelations which he\nimparted as to the opportunities for extra earnings in his troglodyte\ntrade extorted from me a more enthusiastic sympathy than might be\nsupposed possible.\nThat agreeable domestic pet, _homo sapiens_, remains unchanged even when\nyou dress him up in a uniform and set him fighting. He is always\nconsistently inconsistent; he is always both reasonable and\nunreasonable. You can try to cast him in a mould, but he resumes his\nnormal shapelessness the moment the mould is removed. Expose him to\nfrightful ordeals of terror and pain, and he will emerge grumbling about\nsome petty grievance or carrying on a flirtation with another man's wife\nor squabbling about sectarian dogmas or gambling on magazine\ncompetitions or planning new businesses--in fact, behaving precisely as\nthe natural lord of creation always does behave. No member of our\nhospital staff, I imagine, will ever forget the arrival of the first\nbatch of exchanged British wounded prisoners; It was the most tragic\nscene I have ever witnessed. It is a fact, for which I make no apology,\nthat tears were shed by some of those whose task it was to welcome that\npitiful band of martyrs. We had received convoys of wounded many a time,\nbut _these_ broken creatures, so pale, so neglected, so thin and so\ninfinitely happy to be free once more, had a poignant appeal which must\nhave melted the most rigid official. (And we are neither very official,\nhere, nor very rigid.) Well, amongst these liberated captives was one\nwho told a sad tale of starvation at his internment camp. There is\nlittle doubt that it was a true tale, in the main. On that I make no\ncomment. I simply introduce you to this gentleman, who had been restored\nto his native land after ten months of entombment, in order to mention\nthat on the following morning, when his breakfast was placed before him,\nhe turned up his nose at it. Loudly complaining of the poorness of the\nfood, he leant out of bed, picked up a brown-paper parcel which had been\nhis only luggage, and produced from it some German salted herring, which\nhe proceeded to eat with grumbling gusto.\nThat is not specially Tommy Atkins; it is _homo sapiens_ of the\nhearthside, whether in suburban villa or in slum, for ever dissatisfied\n(more especially with his victuals) and for ever evoking our affection\nall the same.\nNo; Tommy Atkins is never twice alike. He is unanimous on few debatable\nmatters. One of them, as I have said, is the desirability of finishing\nthe war--in the proper way. (But even here there are differences as to\nwhat constitutes the proper way.) Another is (I trust I shall not shock\nthe reader) the extreme displeasingness of life at the front. I would\nnot say that our hospital patients are positively thankful to be\nwounded, nor that they do not wish to recover with reasonable rapidity.\nBut that they are glad to be safe in England once more is undeniable.\nThe more honour to them that few, if any, flinch from returning to\nduty--when they know only too well what that duty consists of. But they\nmake no bones about their opinion. Not long ago I was the conductor of a\nparty of convalescents who went to a special matin\u00e9e of a military\ndrama. The theatre was entirely filled with wounded soldiers from\nhospitals, plus a few nurses and orderlies. It was an inspiring sight.\nThe drama went well, and its patriotic touches received their due meed\nof applause. But when the heroine, in a moving passage, declared that\nshe had never met a wounded British soldier who was not eager to get\nback to the front, there arose, in an instant, a spontaneous shout of\nlaughter from the whole audience. That was Tommy Atkins unanimous for\nonce.\nHe was unanimous too, I should add, in perceiving immediately that the\nactress had been disconcerted by his roar of amusement. The poor girl's\nemotional speech had been ruined. She looked blank and stood irresolute.\nAt once a burst of hand-clapping took the place of the laughter. It was\nnot ironical, it was friendly and apologetic. \"Go ahead!\" it said.\n\"We're sorry. Those lines aren't your fault, anyway. You spoke them very\nprettily, and it was a shame to laugh. But the ass of a playwright\nhadn't been in the trenches, and if your usual audiences relish that\nkind of speech they haven't been there either.\"\nSo much for Tommy Atkins in his unanimous mood--unanimously condemning\ncant and at the same time unanimously courteous. Now that I come to\nreflect I believe that, in his best moments, these are perhaps the only\ntwo points concerning which Tommy Atkins _is_ unanimous. Whether he\nlives up to them or not (and to expect him unflinchingly to live up to\nthem in season and out of season is about as sensible as to expect him\nperpetually to live up to the photographs and anecdotes), we may take\nthem as his ideal. He dislikes humbug: he tries to be polite. Could one\nsketch a sounder scaffolding on which to build all the odd\ndivergencies--crankinesses and heroisms, stupidities and\nengagingnesses--which may go to make the edifice of an average decent\nsoul's material, mental and spiritual habitation?\n*       *       *       *       *\n_Postscript._--An expert--one of England's greatest experts--who has\nread the above tells me that I have not done justice to the old\nprofessional army men of Mons and the Aisne. When wounded and in our\nhospital they _did_ want to go back to fight. But their sole reason,\ngiven with frankness, was that they considered they were needed: the new\narmy, in training, was not ready: it would be murder to send the new\narmy out, unprepared, to such an ordeal.\nThis authority, who has interviewed many thousands of convalescents,\nfurther remarked: \"The wounded man who has been under shell fire and who\nprofesses to be eager to go back, whether ordered or no, is a liar. On\nthe other hand, the scrim-shankers who try to get out of going back,\nwhen they should go back, are an amazingly small minority.\"\nVIII\nLAUNDRY PROBLEMS\nA number of oddly unmasculine duties fell to the lot of the R.A.M.C.\norderly prior to the time when \"V.A.D.'s\" were allowed to take his place\n(at least to some extent) throughout our English war-hospitals. One of\nmy first tasks in the morning was the collecting and classification of\nmy ward's dirty linen. The work cannot be called difficult. It would be\nan exaggeration to say that it demands a supreme intellectual effort.\nBut to the male mind it is, at least, rather novel. The average bachelor\nhas perhaps been accustomed to scrutinise his collars, handkerchiefs and\nunderclothes before and after their trips to the laundry. He has seldom,\nI think, had intimate trafficking with pillow-cases, sheets,\ncounterpanes and tablecloths. In the reckoning of these he is apt to\nmake mistakes and to lapse into a casualness which, in a woman familiar\nwith household routine, would be improbable. \"Sister's\" sharpest\nreproofs were called forth by errors made in connection with this daily\nexchange of clean for dirty linen.\nA form, of course, had to be filled in. (The army provides a form\nfor everything.) This form presents a catalogue of eighty-one\nseparate items, from \"Blankets\" (\"Child's,\" \"Infant's\"--I do not\nknow what is the difference between them, and I never had to deal with\neither--\"G.S.\"--whatever that may be--and \"White\") to \"Waist-coats,\nStrait.\" It distinguishes between ten kinds of \"Cases\"--pillow-cases,\npaillasse-cases, and the like: for example, there are \"barrack\"\nbolster-cases and \"hospital\" bolster-cases; and you must not confound\n\"hospital\" mattress-cases with \"officers'\" mattress-cases. You are\nmisled if you imagine that the heading \"Cases\" has exhausted the\npossibilities which appeared to be latent in that noun; for, in addition\nto the ten unqualified \"Cases\" there are seven more, defined as \"Cases,\nslip.\" Can you wonder that the orderly, presented with a bin-full of\nconfused and crumpled objects ready for the wash, and told to count them\nand enter their numbers in the appointed columns, occasionally made a\nwrong guess? Then there were eight sorts of \"Cloths\"--tablecloth,\ntray-cloth, distinctive cloth, and so forth. (To how many lay minds does\n\"distinctive cloth\" convey any meaning?) Counterpanes you would think to\nbe obvious enough; but that remarkable compilation, the _Check Book for\nHospital Linen_ (\"Printed for H.M. Stationery Office....\" etc.),\nrecognises four varieties. It also allows for four varieties of sheets,\nfour of aprons and four of trousers. Of towels it knows six.\nEach ward has a certain stock of linen in its cupboard. That stock can\nonly be kept at the proper level by strict barter of a soiled object for\na clean duplicate of the same object. As there are three hundred and\nsixty-five days in the year on which this transaction occurs, and sixty\nwards' bundles of linen to be dealt with by both the Dirty Linen\nDepartment and the Clean Linen Department on each of those days, it is\nclear that exactitude in the filling-in of the form aforementioned\nbecomes an affair of almost nightmare importance. Bring back from the\nClean Linen Store three dusters instead of the four dusters which you\npreviously handed in at the Dirty Linen Store, and your cupboard will,\nto the end of time, be short of one duster which it should have\npossessed. Even if Sister fails to pounce promptly on the evidence of\nthe loss, the quartermaster's dread stocktaking will ultimately find you\nout. Your cupboard declines to correspond with his book-entries. And\nthere is trouble brewing, in consequence. (But indeed, if the loss of a\nsingle duster were the sole crime revealed on stocktaking day, you would\nbe fortunate.)\nThe orderly, with an obese bundle of washing on his back, plods from the\nward to the Dirty Linen Store at quarter to nine every morning. I say he\n\"plods\" because the bundle is generally too heavy for transportation at\na rapid pace. Twenty sheets are usually but a part of the bundle; and\ntwenty sheets are alone no light burden. Between his teeth--both his\nhands being occupied with the balancing of the bundle--he carries his\nchit: that indispensable list. Arrived at the store he dumps the bundle\non the ground, opens it, and pitches its contents piecemeal over a\ncounter to one of the staff of the store. One by one the objects are\nnamed and counted aloud, as they fly across the counter, the staff\norderly simultaneously checking the list and keeping an eye on what he\nis receiving. For we may, by guile, palm off on him one sheet as two. It\ncan be done, by means of a certain legerdemain which comes with\npractice. Or we may have received from the Dry Store, amongst the rags\nmeant for cleaning purposes, a couple of quite worn-out socks, not a\npair, and long past placing on human feet: these derelicts, with a rapid\nmotion, can be passed over the counter amongst the good socks, and only\nlater in the day will the Dirty Linen Store officials detect the\nfraud--when it is impossible to locate its perpetrator. The\nstore-orderly's job is therefore one requiring some astuteness: his\nchecking of the list has to be achieved at a high speed and in the midst\nof a babel; for as many ward-orderlies are present as the length of the\ncounter will accommodate, and they are all getting rid of their\ndirty-linen bundles at the tops of their voices.\nAltercations, I am afraid, were not infrequent in the epoch when the\nactors in this drama were of the male sex. (Even now, when the scene is\nmainly feminine, I believe differences of opinion continue to arise, but\ndoubtless the language in which they are conducted is seemlier if no\nless deadly.) The store-orderly had a marvellous eye for the difference\nbetween two kinds of shirts which are worn by our patients. One kind has\na pleat in the back, the other kind hasn't; and I confess I occasionally\ntransposed them, on the form. It was fatal to do so. There was a\nseparate line for each brand of shirt and there must be a separate\nentry. The store-orderly's trained powers of observation could see that\npleat, or the absence of it, even as the shirt slid across his line of\nvision in a torrent of other shirts. His hand shot out and grabbed it\nback from joining the heap on the floor within the counter. His pencil\npoised itself from the ticking-off of the items on the form. \"Wrong\nagain!\" he would cry, sometimes in anguish and sometimes in anger. And\nthere was nothing for it but to apologise. To keep on good terms with\nthe various orderlies in the various stores was the secret of making\none's life worth living--a secret even profounder than that of keeping\non good terms with Sister: to be sure it was (though she seldom realised\nit) the very foundation of the art of keeping on good terms with her.\nYou could not even begin to please Sister unless, at the end of those\nincessant journeyings of yours which she did not see, you had dealings\nwith store-orderlies who were obliging and who would give you the things\nwhich the taskmistress had sent you to fetch (or would drop a kindly\nhint as to where and by what means you could acquire them). The Dirty\nLinen Store orderly who declined to accept your plea for forgiveness\nwhen you had been obtuse enough to see a fomentation-wringer in a\nteacloth, could devastate the harmony of a whole forenoon. A sweet\nreasonableness was undoubtedly the note to strike when such a\ncontretemps occurred.\nHaving got quit of the last item in your bundle, you returned to the\nward to attend to other (and generally less entertaining) duties until\nsuch time as it was proper to repair to the Clean Linen Store. The staff\nof the Clean Linen Store, a huge department whose system of book-keeping\nis enough to make the brain reel (for here sheets, etc., are dealt with\nnot in dozens but in thousands), had in the interim received your chit\nfrom their colleagues of the Dirty Linen Store. These latter, rashly or\notherwise, had guaranteed its accuracy by initialing it. Accordingly, in\nthe Clean Linen Store, a fresh bundle was ready for your acceptance, its\ncontents consisting of duplicates of the objects now on their way to the\nlaundry.\nIt was unwise, however, to accept this neatly folded and virginal bundle\nwithout investigation. It might contain what the chit demanded; or it\nmight not. Before you could carry it off you must yourself initial, and\nfinally bid farewell to, the chit: thereby certifying that you had got\nwhat you claimed. To make sure of this you would be well advised to undo\nthe bundle, and (as far as was practicable in a jostling crowd of\nfellow-orderlies similarly employed) run through the whole of its\ncontents, computing them with precision: twenty sheets, twelve\npillow-cases, nine bolster-cases--it is only too easy to miss the\ndifference in the sizes of these--seventeen hand-towels, two\noperating-aprons, eleven handkerchiefs, ten pyjama trousers, ten\nsleeping-jackets, and so on. When you had ticked-off all these separate\nitems in the list you scribbled your initials thereon and fled with your\nbundle--to find, as often as not, that Sister, sorting the things into\nher cupboard, could discover a mistake after all. This meant a humble\nreturn to the Clean Linen Store to beg for the mistake's rectification;\nand the sergeant in charge had merely to take your chit from his file,\nand show you your own initials on it, to prove that you were in the\nwrong.\nIt is conceivable that by means of a ward stocktaking and a reference of\nthe results to the figures in the sergeant's huge ledger, you might have\nproved that you were not in the wrong. But the only time I ever knew one\nof these disputes to be thus put to the test I admit I wished that I had\nrefrained from so temerarious an adventure. Somehow or other I had\nmanaged to come back to the ward with three clean pillow-cases fewer\nthan the tale of dirty ones I had taken away. And Sister was exceedingly\ncross. The particular Sister whose drudge I was at that period was\nrather apt to be cross; and this was one of her crossest days. She\nthreatened to \"report\" me, and in fact did so. I was not--as she seemed\nto expect--shot at dawn. I merely underwent a formal reproof from a high\nauthority who perhaps (but this is a surmise) knew Sister's\nidiosyncrasies even better than I did. There remained, nevertheless, the\npressing problem of the three strayed pillow-cases. These Sister\ncommanded me to obtain from the Clean Linen Store. But you cannot go to\nthe Clean Linen Store and say \"Please give me three pillow-cases.\" The\nClean Linen Store either says \"Why?\" (a question which, under the\ncircumstances, is flatly unanswerable), or else tells you, in language\nboth firm and ornamental, that you have already had them: your initialed\nchit testifies the fact.\nAt all events, after some parley, the Clean Linen Store sergeant (who\nwas less of an ogre than he pretended) offered to strike a bargain with\nme. If I would count all the pillow-cases, in and out of use, in my\nward, and bring him the total, he would compare the said total with the\nfigures in his ledger. Those figures he would not divulge to me. But if\nthe number I announced was three short of the number in his ledger, he\nwould give me the three, and say no more about it.\nThe bargain seemed a fair one. In Sister's absence I spent a precious\nhalf-hour of what should have been my \"afternoon off\" in counting all\nthe pillow-cases I could find in the ward. A good-natured probationer,\nwho sympathised with me in my difficulties (she too had suffered),\ncounted them also. A convalescent patient interested himself in the\nproblem: he also went the round of the beds, and investigated the\ncupboard, counting all the pillow-cases. We three each arrived at the\nsame total. Armed with this total I marched back to the sergeant in the\nClean Linen Store.\nHe turned up his ledger and ran his finger down the page till he came\nto the entry of pillow-cases opposite to my ward. And then he laughed a\nlaugh of fiendish glee.\n\"Do you know,\" he said, \"that instead of having three pillow-cases too\nfew, you've seven too many!\"\nSuch are the traps set by the business man, the expert of ledgers, for\nthe innocent amateur. We had actually got more pillow-cases than we were\nentitled to. All unwittingly, in my eagerness to placate Sister, I had\npublished the mild chicanery in which she had indulged on behalf of her\nward. The sergeant, growing grey in the solution of these abstruse\nmathematical and psychological mysteries, had suspected this Sister all\nalong. He enlightened me. She had recently been transferred from another\nward--and in her going had (against the rules) wafted with her a small\nselection of that ward's property.... And now there would be a surprise\nstocktaking in her new ward: the seven surplus pillow-cases--and perhaps\nother loot--would have to be explained. Sister, in short, was in for a\n_mauvais quart d'heure_.\nIt was a suitable penalty for her crossness. It should have taught her\nthe perils of crossness. With regret I add that she did not envisage the\nepisode in that light. She was merely rather crosser than before. It was\nwithout any profound sorrow that I soon afterwards bade her farewell, on\nher departure to overseas spheres of activity. But she had at least\nafforded me a lesson in the importance of accuracy over my dirty and\nclean linen bundles. Never again would I risk the ordeal of a surprise\nstocktaking; never again would I risk a combat with a ledger-fortified\nsergeant; never again would I risk any attempt at the tortuous in my\ndealings with the classifications of the eighty-one items on the\ntear-off leaf of that dire volume, the _Check Book for Hospital Linen_.\nIX\nON BUTTONS\nIn one of his recent books Mr. H.G. Wells expresses a surprised\nannoyance at the spectacle of spurs. Vast numbers of military gentlemen\n(he observed at the front) go clanking about in spurs although they have\nnever had--and never will have--occasion to bestride a horse. Spurs are\na symbolic survival, a waste of steel and of labour in manufacture, a\nfutile expenditure of energy to keep clean and to put on and take off.\nWhen I first enlisted I felt a similar irritation in regard to buttons.\nHis buttons are a burden to the new recruit. Time takes the edge off his\nresentment. Time is a soother of sorrows, a healer of rancours, however\nlegitimate. Nevertheless one's buttons remain for ever a nuisance. I do\nnot complain that I should have to make my bed, polish my boots, keep\nmy clothes neat. These are the obvious decencies of life. But the daily\nshining-up of metal buttons which need never have been made of metal at\nall, which tarnish in the damp and indeed lose their lustre in an hour\nin any weather, which, moreover, look much prettier dull than\nbright--this is enough to convert the most bloodthirsty recruit into\nobdurate pacifism.\nIt is to be presumed that in the pipe-claying days of peace the hours\nwere apt to hang heavy in barracks, and the furbishing of buttons was\ndevised not alone for smartness' sake, but to occupy idle hands for\nwhich otherwise Satan might be finding some more mischievous employment.\nThe theory--though it throws a lurid light on the unprofitableness of a\nsoldier's profession when there is no war to justify his existence--is\nnot devoid of sense. But why this custom, designed for that excellent\nmortal, the T. Atkins who walked out with nurse-maids, and was none too\nbusy between-whiles, should be forced upon a totally different (if no\nless estimable) T. Atkins whose job hardly gives him a moment for\nmeals--let alone for dalliance with the fair--I cannot pretend to\nfathom. It is arguable that the ornamental soldier is suited by glossy\nbuttons and may properly lavish time and trouble thereupon. It is not\narguable that glossy buttons are a valid feature of the garb of a\nhumdrum and harassed hospital orderly.\nMany a time, footsore and aching with novel toil, I could have groaned\nwhen, instead of lying down to relax, I had to tackle the polishing of\nthat idiotic panoply of buttons. My tunic had (it still has) five large\nbuttons in front, four pocket-flap buttons, two shoulder buttons, and\ntwo shoulder numerals, \"T.--R.A.M.C.--LONDON.\" My great-coat had (it\nstill has) five large front buttons, two shoulder buttons and two\nshoulder numerals, three back belt buttons, two coat-tail buttons. My\ncap had (it still has) a badge and two small strap-buttons. All these\nmust be kept brilliant. And, in addition, there was the intricate\nbrasswork of one's belt.\nAre the wounded any better looked after because a tired orderly has\nspent some of his off-duty rest-hour in rubbing metal buttons which\nwould have been every bit as buttonable had they been made of bone?\nMany were the debates, in our hut, over the button problem. The\nabolition of metal buttons being impracticable--the bold project of a\npetition to the King and Lord Kitchener was never proceeded with--two\nquestions alone interested us: (1) which was the best polish, and (2)\nwhich was the quickest and easiest system of polishing. The shabby\npeddler-cum-boot-maker who had somehow established, at that period, a\nmonopoly of the minor trade of our camp, vended a substance (in penny\ntins) called Soldier's Friend. This was a solidified plate-polish of a\npink hue. Having--as per the instructions--\"moistened\" it, in other\nwords, spat upon it, you worked up a modicum of the resulting pink mud\nwith an old toothbrush, then applied same to each button. When you had\nrubbed a pink film on to the button you proceeded to rub it off again,\nand lo! the tarnish had departed like an evil dream and the metal\nglistened as if fresh from the mint. If you were very particular you\nfinished the performance with chamois leather. Thereafter you lost the\nlast precious five minutes before parade in efforts, with knife-blade or\nclothesbrush, to remove from your tunic the smears of pink paste which\nhad failed to repose on the buttons and had stuck to the surrounding\ncloth instead. Luckily, Soldier's Friend dries and cakes and powders off\nfairly quickly. It is a lovable substance, in its simple behaviour, its\nlack of complications. I surmise that somebody has made a fortune out of\nmanufacturing millions of those penny tins. There is at least one\nimitation of Soldier's Friend on the market, and, like most imitations,\nit is neither better nor worse than the original. Except for the name on\nthe outside of the tin, the two commodities cannot be told apart. No\ndoubt the imitator has likewise made a fortune. If so, both fortunes\nhave been amassed from a foible to whose blatant uselessness and\nwastefulness even a Bond Street jeweller or a de-luxe hotel chef would\nbe ashamed to give countenance.\nOne member of the hut's company, more fastidious than his fellows,\nobjected to expectorating on to his Soldier's Friend. Rather than do so\nhe would tramp the fifty yards to our wash-place and obtain a couple of\ndrops of water from the tap. (The same man thought nothing of keeping a\nhalf-consumed ham, some decaying fruit, and an opened pot of Bovril all\nwrapped in his spare clothes in his box under his bed. That is by the\nway. I am here concerned not with human nature, but with buttons.) Plain\nwater, however, was voted less effective than the more popular liquid.\nThe scientifically minded had a notion that human spittle contained some\nacid which Nature had evolved specially to assist the action of\nSoldier's Friend. I am bound to say that I was of the anti-plain-water\nparty myself. For a space I became an adherent of the experimentalists\nwho moistened their Soldier's Friend with methylated spirit, alleging\nthat the ensuing polish was more permanent. I lapsed. My small bottle of\nmethylated spirit came to an end, and on reflection I was not sure that\nits superiority over spittle had been proved. Nothing, in the English\nclimate, can make the sheen of metal buttons endure, at the\noutside, more than one day. \"Bluebell,\" \"Silvo,\" and the other\nchemico-frictional preparations in favour of which I ultimately\nabandoned Soldier's Friend, are alike in this--that their virtue lies in\nfrequent application, diligence and elbow-grease. They are, every one,\nexcellent. Their inventors deserve our gratitude. But our gratitude to\ntheir inventors must be nothing compared with their inventors' gratitude\nto the person who decreed that the hard-pressed T. Atkins of the Great\nWar should wear (at least in part) the same needless finery as the\nrelatively otiose T. Atkins of Peace. May that despot, whoever he be,\ndepart to a realm of bliss--I suppose it would be bliss to him--where he\nhas to do hospital orderlies' chores in an attire completely composed of\ntarnishing buttons, every separate one of which must hourly be brought\nup to the parade standard of specklessness.\nX\nA WORD ABOUT \"SLACKERS IN KHAKI\"\nWhen the ambulances containing a new batch of wounded begin to roll up\nto the entrance of the hospital they are received by a squad of\norderlies. To a spectator who happened to pass at that moment it might\nappear that these orderlies had nothing else to do but lift stretchers\nout of ambulances and carry them indoors. The squad of orderlies have an\nair of always being ready on duty waiting to pounce out on any patient\nwho may arrive at any hour of the day or night and promptly transfer him\nto his bed. I have known of a visitor, witnessing this incident, who\ncommented on it in a manner which showed that he imagined he had seen\nour unit performing its sole function; he pictured us existing purely\nand simply for one end--the carrying of stretchers up the front steps\ninto the building. He was kind enough to praise the rapidity with which\nthe job was done--but he held it to be a job which hardly justified the\nenlistment of so considerable a company of able-bodied males. What,\nexactly, we did with ourselves during the long hours when ambulances\nwere _not_ arriving, he failed to understand. I suppose he pictured us\ntwiddling our thumbs in some kind of cosy club-room situated in the\nneighbourhood of the front door, from whence we could be summoned as\nsoon as another convoy hove in sight.\nThe truth of the matter is quite otherwise. Arrivals of wounded, even\nwhen they occur several times a day (I have known six hundred patients\nenter the hospital in forty-eight hours), are far from being our chief\npreoccupation. Admittedly they take precedence of other duties. The\nmessage, \"Convoy coming! Every man wanted in the main hall!\" is the\nsignal for each member of the unit who is not engaged in certain\nexempted sections to drop his work, whatever it is, and proceed smartly\nto report to the sergeant-in-charge. The telephone has notified us of\nthe hour at which the ambulances may be expected; the hospital's\ninternal telephone system has passed on the tidings to the various\nofficials concerned; and, five minutes before the patients are due, all\nthe orderlies likely to be required must \"down tools,\" so to speak, and\nline-up at the door. They come streaming from every corner of the\nhospital and of its grounds. Some have been working in wards, some have\nbeen pushing trollies in the corridors, some have been shovelling coke,\nsome have been toiling in the cookhouse or stores, some have been\nshifting loads of bedding to the fumigator, some have been on \"sanitary\nfatigue,\" some have been cleaning windows or whitewashing walls, some\nhave been writing or typing documents, some have been spending their\nrest-hour in slumber or over a game of billiards. Whatever they were\ndoing, they must stop doing it at the word of command.\nIf the convoy be a large one, its advent may even mean, for the\norderlies, the dread announcement, \"All passes stopped.\" The luckless\nwight whose one afternoon-off in the week this happens to be, and who\nhas probably arranged to tryst with a lady friend, finds, at the gate,\nthat he is turned back by the sentry. In vain he displays his pass,\nproperly signed, stamped and dated: the telephone has warned the sentry\n(or \"R.M.P.\"--Regimental Military Policeman) that the passes have been\ncountermanded. Until the convoy has been dealt with, the pass is so much\nwaste paper, and the unfortunate orderly's inamorata will look for him\nand behold him not. How many painful misunderstandings this \"All passes\nstopped\" law has given rise to, one shudders to guess.\nBut indeed no war-hospital orderly ever arranges any appointment without\nthe proviso that he is liable to break it. The folk who imagine that the\nhospital orderly enjoys a \"cushy job\" (to use the appropriate\nvernacular) seldom make sufficient allowance for this painful aspect of\nit. The ordinary soldier in training in an English camp has his evenings\nfree, and certain other free times, which are nearly as sure as the\nsun's rising. The hospital orderly is _never_--in theory at any\nrate--off duty. His free moments are regarded not as a right but as a\nfavour: no freedom, at any time, can be guaranteed. He is liable to be\ncalled on in the middle of the night, or at the instant when he is going\noff duty, or when at a meal, or when resting, or when on the point of\nwalking out in pursuance of the gentle art of courtship. And he must\nrespond, instanter, or he will find that he has earned the C.B.--which\nin this instance means not Companion of the Bath, but Confined to\nBarracks, a punishment as hard to bear as the cruel \"keeping in\" of our\nschool-days.\nWithout presuming to compare either the importance or the onerousness of\nthe hospital orderly's work with that of the soldier capable of going to\nthe front to fight, I would here add that the critic who watches the\nstretcher-carrying and thinks it a pity that able-bodied males should be\nwasted on it, is doing the system (not to mention the men themselves) an\ninjustice. For the men whom he sees are not, as a matter of fact,\nable-bodied, even though muscular enough to stand this short physical\neffort. Excitable old gentlemen who believe that they can decide at a\nglance whether a man is medically fit, and write to the Press about the\n\"shirkers\" they think they have detected, were of the opinion, long\nsince, that the R.A.M.C. should be combed out. Certain journals made a\ngreat feature of this proposal. Whatever may be the case elsewhere, I\ncan only say that as far as our unit was concerned it had already,\nmonths before the newspaper agitation, been combed out five times; and\nthis in spite of the fact that, at the period when I enlisted, our\nColonel declined to look at any recruit who was not either over age or\nhad been rejected for active service. The unit was thus made up, even\nthen, of elderly men and of \"crocks.\" (This was before the start of the\nDerby Scheme and, of course, considerably before the introduction of\nUniversal Service.) Perhaps it is allowable to point the moral against\nthe \"shirker\"-discovering armchair patriots aforesaid: that no small\nproportion of our unit was composed of over-age recruits who, instead\nof informing the world at large that they wished they were younger,\n\"And, by Gad, I envy the lads their chance to do _anything_ in the\ncountry's cause,\" did not rest until they had found an opening. In my\nown hut there were two recruits over sixty years of age. Elsewhere in\nthe unit there were several over fifty. Our mess-room at meal times was,\nand still is, dotted with grey-haired heads, not of retired army men\nrejoined, but of men who, previous to the war, had lived comfortable\ncivilian lives. At a later date, when the few fit men that our\ncombings-out revealed had gone elsewhere, the unit was kept up to\nstrength by the drafting-in either of C3 recruits or of soldiers who,\nhaving been at the front and been wounded, or invalided back, were\nmarked for home duty only. So much for the \"slackers in khaki\" which one\nextra emphatic writer (himself not in khaki, although younger than\nseveral of the orderlies here) professed to discover in the R.A.M.C.\nThose \"slackers\" may be having an easier time of it than the heroes of\nFrance, Gallipoli, Salonika, Egypt and Mesopotamia. But they are not\nhaving so easy a time as some of their detractors.\nThe hospital orderly is not (I think I may assert on his behalf) puffed\nup with foolish illusions as to his place in the scheme of things. It is\na humble place, and he knows it. His work is almost comically\nunromantic, painfully unpicturesque. Moreover--let us be frank--much of\nit is uninteresting, after the first novelty has worn off. Work in the\nwards has its compensations: here there is the human element. But only a\nportion of a unit such as ours can be detailed for ward work: the rest\nare either hewers of wood and drawers of water or else have their noses\nto a grindstone of clerical monotonousness beside which the\nledger-keeping of a bank employee is a heaven of blissful excitements.\nYou will find few hospital orderlies who are not \"fed up\"; you will find\nnone who do not long for the war's end. And I fancy you will find very,\nvery few who would not go on active service if they could. On the\noccasions when we have had calls for overseas volunteers, the response\nhas always exceeded the demand. The people who, looking at a party of\nhospital orderlies, remark--it sounds incredible, but there _are_ people\nwho make the remark--\"These fellows should be out at the front,\" may\nfurther be reminded that \"these fellows\" now have no say in the choice\nof their own whereabouts. Not a soldier in the land can decide where or\nhow he shall serve. That small matter is not for him, but for the\nauthorities. He may be thirsting for the gore of Brother Boche, and an\ninexorable fate condemns him to scrub the gore of Brother Briton off the\ntiles of the operating theatre. He may (but I never met one who did)\nelect to sit snugly on a stool at a desk filling-in army forms or\nconducting a card index; and lo, at a whisper from some unseen Nabob in\nthe War Office, he finds himself hooked willy-nilly off his stool and\ndumped into the Rifle Brigade. This is what it means to be in khaki, and\nit is hardly the place of persons not in khaki to bandy sneers about the\ncomfortableness of the Linseed Lancers whose initials, when not standing\nfor Rob All My Comrades, can be interpreted to mean Run Away, Matron's\nComing. The squad of orderlies unloading that procession of ambulances\nat the hospital door may not envy the wounded sufferers whom they\ntransmit to their wards; but the observer is mistaken if he assumes that\nthe orderlies have, by some questionable manoeuvre, dodged the fiery\nordeal of which this string of slow-moving stretchers is the harvest.\nXI\nTHE RECREATION ROOMS\nWe rather pride ourselves, at the 3rd London, on the fame of our\nhospital not merely as a place in which the wounded get well, but as a\nplace in which they also \"have a good time.\" The two things, truth to\ntell, are interlinked--a truism which might seem to need no labouring,\nwere it not for the evidence brought from more rigid and red-tape-ridden\nestablishments. A couple of our most valued departments are the \"Old\nRec.\" and the \"New Rec.\"--the old and new recreation rooms. The new\nrecreation room, a spacious and well-built \"hut,\" contains three\nbilliard tables, a library, and current newspapers, British and\nColonial. This room is the scene of whist-drives, billiard and pool\ntournaments, and other sociable ongoings. Sometimes there is an\nexhibition match on the best billiard table: the local champion of\nWandsworth shows us his skill--and a very pretty touch he has: once the\nlady billiard champion of England came, and defeated the best opponent\nwe could enlist against her--an event which provoked tremendous applause\nfrom a packed congregation of boys in blue.\nThe old recreation room is fitted with a permanent stage for theatricals\nand concerts. It is also our \"Movie Palace.\" (I think our hospital was\nthe first to instal a cinematograph as a fixture.) During the morning\nthe floor area is dotted with miniature billiard tables--which are never\nfor a moment out of use. In the afternoon these are removed; some\nhundreds of chairs replace them; and at 4.30 we begin an\nentertainment--music, a play (we have had Shakespeare here), lantern\nslides, films, or what not. Those entertainments, which have continued\nunbrokenly since the hospital began to function in 1914, constitute the\noutstanding feature of the \"good time\" enjoyed by 3rd Londoners. The\n\"Old Rec.\" and its crowded concerts will be a memory cherished by hosts\nof fighting men from the homeland and from overseas.\nIn the original hospital plan--drawn up before the war--the Old Rec.\n(which is a part of the main school building) was marked down to be a\nward of forty beds. Its structure, its internal geography, and the sheer\nimpossibility of providing it with the essential sanitary conveniences,\nwould make it unsuitable to be a ward of four beds, let alone of forty.\nOn this account its allotment for recreation purposes would be\nexcusable. But the Old Rec. and the New Rec. too, for that matter,\njustify their superficial waste of bed-space on other--and\nunanswerable--grounds. It is a mere matter of common sense to arrange\nsome centre to which the patient can repair and employ his leisure when\nhe is sufficiently well to potter about though not well enough to be\ndischarged from hospital. Instead of idling in his ward and disturbing\nthe patients who are still confined to bed--and who, often, are urgently\nin need of quietness--the convalescent departs to one or other of the\nrecreation rooms, morning and afternoon, where he can make as much\nnoise as he likes and where he can meet and fraternise with his comrades\nfrom every front. (What exchanging of stories those recreation rooms\nhave witnessed!) On the one hand, then, the seriously ill patient is not\nannoyed by the rovings in the ward of the walking patients; and on the\nother the walking patients are not irked by the necessity for keeping\nquiet at a period when returning health stimulates them to a wholesome\ndesire for fun. Both kinds of patients, thus, may legitimately be said\nto get better more quickly than they would have had a chance to do were\nit not for the recreation rooms. It is within the writer's knowledge\nthat the medical staff of the hospital, on being consulted as to the\n\"bed value\" of the recreation rooms, unanimously agreed that their\nexistence reduced the average sojourn of the hospital's inmates by a\ndefinite \"per day\" ratio: that ratio, so far from showing a bed-space\nwaste, worked out at a per-annum gain of bed-space equivalent to a\nward--if such a colossal ward could conceived!--of upwards of 300 beds.\nSo much for a point which might not appear to be worth detailed\nexplanation, but which has here been glanced at in order that critics\n(for, unbelievable though it sounds, there have been curmudgeons to\ngrowl of spoiling the wounded by too much pleasure) may be answered in\nadvance. The recreation rooms are a paying investment both to the\nhospital and to the State. This is our trump card in any \"spoiling the\nwounded\" controversy--though I dare say that most of us would not, in\nany case, care twopence whether the concerts and films and billiards\nwere an investment or an extravagance: nothing would stand in the way of\nour ambition to provide the now proverbial \"good time\" for all the\nguests of the 3rd London.\nScores of concerts of an excellence which would have been noteworthy\nanywhere have been presented to our assemblages of wounded in the Old\nRec. Singers, musicians, actors and actresses have come and given of\ntheir best. Miss Hullah's Music in War Time Committee (that delightful\nbody), and Mr. Howard Williams's parties, are perhaps our greatest\nregular standbys. Certain sections of the public know Mr. Howard\nWilliams's name as a famous one in other fields of activity: to\nthousands of soldiers it is honoured as that of the man who tirelessly\norganised scrumptious tea-parties, pierrot shows, exhibition boxing\ncontests, nigger troupe entertainments--a list of jollifications,\nindoors in winter and in the open air in summer, infinite in variety and\nguaranteed never once to fall flat. A curious Empire reputation, this of\nMr. Williams!\nYesterday, for instance, a nigger troupe visited the hospital. To be\nexact, they were the Metropolitan Police Minstrels (\"By Permission of\nSir E.R. Henry, G.C.V.O., K.C.B., C.S.I., Commissioner\"); but no member\nof the audience, I imagine, could picture those jocose blackamoors, with\ntheir tambourines and bones, as really being anything so serious as\ntraffic-controlling constables. That their comic songs were accompanied\nby a faultless orchestra was understandable enough. One can believe in a\npolice band. One is not surprised that the police band is a good band.\nTo believe that the ebony-visaged person with the huge red\nindiarubber-flexible mouth who sings \"Under the archway, Archibald,\" and\nfollows this amorous ditty with a clog dance is--in his washed\nmoments--the terror of burglars, requires unthinkable flights of\nimagination. As I gazed at this singular resurrection of Moore and\nBurgess and breathless childhood's afternoons at the St. James's\nHall--the half circle of inanely alert faces the colour of fresh\npolished boots--the preposterous uniforms and expansive\nshirt-fronts--the \"nigger\" dialect which this strange convention demands\nbut which cannot be said to resemble the speech of any African tribe yet\ndiscovered--I found that by no effort of faith or credulity could I\npierce the disguise and perceive policemen.\nIt is at least twenty years since I met a nigger minstrel in the flesh.\nVague ghosts of bygone persons and of piquant anachronisms seemed to\nfloat approvingly in the air: the Prince Consort, bustles, the high\nbicycle, sherry, Moody and Sankey, the Crystal Palace, Labouchere, \"Pigs\nin Clover,\" Lottie Collins, Evolution, Bimetallism: hosts of forgotten\nimages, names and shibboleths came popping out from the brain's dusty\npigeon-holes, magically released by the spectacle of the nigger troupe.\nYes, I was indeed switched into the past by Mr. Bones, Massa Jawns'n and\nthe rest. And yet the present might have seemed more emphatic and more\npoignant. One felt, rather than saw, an audience of several hundred\npersons in the dim rows of chairs. And laughing at the broad witticisms\nof the niggers, or enjoying their choruses and orchestral\naccompaniments, one forgot just what that half-glimpsed audience\nconsisted of; what it meant, and how it came to be here assembled.\nOf course when the lights were turned up in the interval, one beheld the\nusual spectacle: stretchers, wheeled chairs, crutches, bandaged heads,\narms in splints, blind men, men with one arm, men with one leg: rank on\nrank of war's flotsam and jetsam, British, Australians, New Zealanders,\nNewfoundlanders, Canadians, come to make merry over the minstrels: in\nthe front row the Colonel and the Matron, with officer patients; here\nand there an orderly or a V.A.D.; here and there a Sister with her\n\"boys.\" It was a family gathering. I descried no strangers, and no one\nnot in uniform--unless you count the men too ill to don their blue\nslops: these had been brought in dressing-gowns or wrapped in blankets.\nNo mere haphazard audience, this, of anybody and everybody who chooses\nto pay at a turnstile! Entrance to this hall is free ... but the price\nis beyond money, all the same.\nA family party it was, decidedly. Thick fumes of tobacco smoke uprose\nfrom it. (Shall we ever abandon the cigarette habit, now?) Orderlies\ncontinued to arrive and stow themselves discreetly in corners: by some\nstrange providence each orderly had found that for a while he could be\nspared from ward or office. Staff-Sergeants, Sergeants,\nCorporals--mysteriously they made time to leave their various\ndepartments. Even a bevy of masseuses (those experts eternally on the\nrush from ward to ward) had peeped in to see the nigger minstrels. And\neverybody was pleased: every jest and every conundrum got its laugh,\nevery ballad its applause. Not that we ever \"give the bird\" to those\nwho come to amuse us. Offer us skill in any shape or form--pierrots,\nniggers, pianist, violinist, conjurer, ventriloquist, dancer, reciter:\nany or all of these will be appreciated warmly.\nYesterday, for the nigger minstrels, there were no empty chairs. Until,\nin the midst of Part II (\"A Laughable Sketch\"--_vide_ the\nprogramme--wherein female r\u00f4les were doubly coy by reason of the\nmasculinity of their falsetto dialogue and remarkable ankles) a\nmessenger stole hither and thither, whispering to the orderlies, who\npromptly tiptoed from the room.\nA convoy of new arrivals demanded our presence.\nThe silent ambulances were gliding up to the entrance of the hospital.\nOrderlies, fetched from their jobs and from the entertainment, lined up\nin the rain to take their places in the quartettes of bearers who lifted\nout the stretchers. The Assistant Matron, standing in the shelter of the\ndoor, checked her list; the Medical Officer handed out the ward tickets;\nthe lady clerks from the Admission and Discharge Office took the\npatients' particulars. And the bathroom became very busy.\nAs I started to wheel a much-bandaged warrior to his ward, the\nrecreation-room door opened and a burst of music-cum-essence-of-nigger\nemerged on his astonished ears. I was a little doubtful as to whether\nour new guest would not think his reception somewhat flippant in key.\nThe poor fellow was visibly suffering, and the sound of tambourines and\ncomedians' guffaws seemed a scarcely proper comment on his condition. I\nmight have spared myself these misgivings. \"Say, chum,\" he interrogated\nme feebly, \"what's that noise?\" \"Nigger minstrels, old man.\"\n\"Golly!--and have I got to go straight to my bed?\"\nAlas, he had to. It would be long before he could be well enough to be\ntaken to one of our entertainments. But, had he been given his way, he\nwould have gone direct from his fatiguing overseas journey into the Old\nRec. to join the family party and chuckle at Mr. Bones and Massa\nJawns'n.... No doubts assailed _his_ mind as to whether it was right to\n\"waste bed-space\" on mere frivolities. A nigger minstrel show was to him\na deal more important, in fact, than his wound. And perhaps, in\ninstinct, he was not far wrong.\nXII\nTHE COCKNEY\nBefore I enlisted I was lodging in a house which it was occasionally\nconvenient to approach by a short cut through an area of slumland. One\nnight when traversing this slum--the hour was 1.30 a.m.--I was stopped\nby a couple of women who told me that there was a man lying on the\nground in an adjacent alley; they thought he must be ill; would I come\nand look at him?\nThey led me down a turning which opened into a narrow court. This court\nwas reached by an arched tunnel through tenement houses. The tunnel was\npitchy black, but I struck matches as I proceeded, and presently we came\nupon the object of my companions' solicitude--a young soldier, propped\nagainst the wall and with his legs projecting across the flagstones.\nThe women had, in fact, discovered him by tripping over those legs in\nthe darkness.\nThey were slatternly women, but warm-hearted; and when I had managed to\narouse the gentleman in khaki and hoist him to his feet (for the cause\nof his indisposition was plain--and he had slept it off) they called\ndown blessings on my head and overwhelmed our friend with sympathy which\nhe did not wholly deserve and to which he made no rejoinder. Nor did he\nvouchsafe any very lucid answer when I asked him whither he was bound. I\nwas prepared to pilot him--but I could hardly do so without knowing\ntowards which point of the compass he proposed to steer, or rather, to\nbe steered. \"I know w'ere I wanter go,\" was all I could get out of him.\nVery well; if he knew his address, it was no concern of mine; he could\nlead on; I would act as a mere supporter. In this capacity, with my arm\nlinked firmly in his, I brought him forth from the tunnel to the street\n(he had no wish, it seemed, to go through the tunnel into the court),\nand here we bade farewell to the ladies.\n\"Which way now?\" I inquired. My charge responded not, but crossed to a\ncorner and meandered up one of those interminable thoroughfares which\nlead out of London into the suburbs. Trudging with him and helping him\nto sustain his balance, which was not as stable as could be wished, I\nplied him with mildly genial conversation and at last elicited a few\nvague answers. These were couched in the cockney idiom, but I caught a\nfaint nasal twang which led me to suspect that the speaker had come from\nthe other side of the Atlantic. Yes--he told me he had just arrived from\nCanada.\nWe had proceeded a short distance when on the further side of the street\nI descried a golden halo which outlined the silhouette of a coffee\nstall. It occurred to me that a cup of hot coffee would be a good tonic\nto disperse the last symptoms of my friend's indiscretion, so I\ndeflected him across the road, and we brought up, together, alongside\nthe coffee-stall's counter.\nLest the reader should be unacquainted with that unique creation, the\ncoffee-stall, I must explain that it is nocturnal in habit, emerging\nfrom its lair only between the hours of 11 p.m. and 7 a.m. It is an\nequipage of which the interior is inhabited by a fat, jolly man (at\nleast according to my experience he is always fat and jolly) surrounded\nby steaming urns, plates of cake, buns of a citron-yellow hue, pale\npastries, ham sandwiches and packets of cigarettes. The upper panels of\none of its sides unfold to form a bar below and a penthouse roof above,\nthe latter being generally extended into an awning. The awning is a\nprotection for the customer not against the sun--a luminary from whose\nassaults the London coffee-stalls have little to fear--but against the\nrain. Thanks to these awnings, and the chattiness of the fat, jolly man,\nand the warmth exhaled by the urns, and the circumstance that the public\nhouses are shut, our coffee-stalls are able to sell two brownish\nbeverages, called respectively coffee and tea, which otherwise could\nhardly hope to achieve the honour of human consumption.\nFate has guided me on many midnight pilgrimages through the town, and I\nhave imbibed, sometimes with relish, the liquids alluded to; I have also\npartaken of the pallid pastry and the citron-yellow buns. I am therefore\nin a position to write, for the benefit of persons less well informed, a\ntreatise on coffee-stalls. This I shall refrain from doing. The one\npoint it is necessary for me to mention is that the fat, jolly man,\nbeing deplorably distrustful, does not supply casual customers with\nteaspoons. You may have a cup of alleged tea (one penny) or a cup of\nalleged coffee (one penny); a dollop of sugar is dropped into the cup;\nthe fat, jolly man gives the mixture a stir-round with a teaspoon; then\nhe places the cup before you on the bar; but the teaspoon is still in\nhis grasp. I dare say he would lend you the teaspoon if you requested\nhim to do so; but unless you have that audacity he prefers to keep the\nteaspoon on his side of the bar, out of harm's way. This may seem\nstrange, when you perceive that the teaspoon is fashioned of a metal\nunknown to silversmiths and might be priced at threepence. But even a\nthreepenny teaspoon is a souvenir which some collectors would not\ndespise.\nPresumably regular customers receive teaspoons, for teaspoons lie in a\nheap on the fat, jolly man's side of the counter. This was the case at\nthe coffee-stall before which the young soldier and I ranged ourselves.\nAnd the heap of teaspoons seemed to exercise a curious fascination upon\nthe soldier. He continued to stare at them for some minutes after I had\nset in front of him his cup of coffee. Then he stared at the fat, jolly\nman, who was cutting slabs from a loaf. He stared for a long time,\nmaking no reply to my remarks.\nRain began to patter on the awning--it had rained earlier in the\nnight--and I became aware of a figure, lurking in the background on the\npavement, beyond the awning's shelter, but within the radius of the haze\nof light projected therefrom. It was a wretched, slinking figure, that\nof an elderly man with bleared eyes and a red nose: one of those pariahs\nwho haunt cabstands and promote the cabs up the rank when the front\nvehicle is hailed. This special specimen of his breed appeared to be a\nsatellite of the coffee-stall proprietor: perhaps he helped to tow the\nstall to its berth. Whatever might be his function, he lingered on the\noutskirts of the ring of light, watching us; and the young soldier, in\nhis slow scrutiny of the stall and its surroundings, caught sight of\nhim, and stared stolidly, as he had stared at everything else.\nI was in the act of drinking my coffee when the soldier suddenly leant\nacross the counter, picked up a spoon, turned, and threw it at the\nderelict whose face wavered on the edge of the lamplight's circle. The\nvictim of this extraordinary attack dodged the missile, then grovelled\nafter it in the gutter. Meanwhile the fat man (instantaneously ceasing\nto be jolly) gave vent to an angry protest.\n\"Wotcher do _that_ for? Chuckin' my spoons abart! Drunk, that's wot you\nare!\"\n\"Ain't drunk!\" said the soldier.\n\"Wotcher chuck my spoon at 'im for, then? 'E ain't done you no 'arm.\"\n\"Yus 'e _'as_,\" was the soldier's surprising retort.\n\"No 'e ain't.\"\n\"Yus 'e _'as_.\"\n\"No 'e 'ain't. 'E ain't done you no 'arm.\"\nTo which the derelict chimed in (he had retrieved the spoon and now\nadvanced timidly with it under the awning): \"I ain't done _you_ no\n'arm\"--a husky, whimpering chorus to his fat patron.\nThe soldier fixed the derelict with a fierce glare. \"Yus you _'ave_,\" he\nreiterated.\nI was wondering how the dispute might develop, but evidently my ear is\nunattuned to the nuances of these dialectics. The soldier's glare and\nthe soldier's tone must have betrayed themselves to the two other men as\nfactitious; the derelict, anyhow, lost his nervousness and, approaching\nnearer, scanned the soldier with dim, peering eyes; then broke into a\njoyous grin and exclaimed:\n\"Lumme, if it ain't ol' Bert!\"\nAnd the fat man, leaning on his counter, and likewise examining the\nsoldier, cried, \"Ol' Bert it is!\"\n\"Knew you in two ticks,\" grunted Bert. \"Same ol' 'Arry.\" (This was the\nderelict.) \"Same ol' 'Erb.\" (This was the fat--and once again\njolly--man.)\nExplanations ensued. Bert, the young soldier, was a native of these\nparts. He had emigrated to Canada five years previously. To-night, _en\nroute_ for the front, he had returned. Earlier in the evening there had\nbeen ill-advised libations; he had started for his home, felt sleepy,\nsheltered from the wet in a tunnel quite familiar to him, and there been\ndiscovered by the ladies and roused by myself. Arrived at the\ncoffee-stall he had recognised in its proprietor a former pal and\nanother former pal in 'Arry the derelict. To throw the spoon at 'Arry\nwas merely his playful mode of announcing his identity.\nI left the trio reviewing the past and exchanging news of the present.\nMy services, it was clear, would no longer be required by the prodigal.\nHe and his mates gave me a hearty good-night.\nI did not guess how intimate was soon to be my association with the\nBerts and 'Arries and 'Erbs of the world. I was to be their servant, to\nwait upon them, to perform menial tasks for them, to wash them and dress\nthem and undress them, to carry them in my arms. I was to see them\nsuffer and to learn to respect their gameness, and the wry, \"grousing\"\nhumour which is their almost universal trait. In my own wards, and\nelsewhere in the hospital, I came in close contact with many cockneys of\nthe slums. Even when one had not precisely \"placed\" a patient of this\ndescription, the relatives who came to him on visiting days gave the\nclue to the stock from which he sprang. The mother was sometimes a\n\"flower girl\"; the sweetheart, with a very feathered hat, and hair which\nevidently lived in curling pins except on great occasions, probably\nworked in a factory. These people, if the patient were confined to bed,\nsat beside him and talked in a subdued, throaty whisper. But I have seen\nthe same sort of patient, well enough to walk about, meet his folks on\nvisiting afternoons at the hospital gate. There is a crowd at the\nhospital gate, passing in and going out; hosts of patients are waiting,\nsome in wheeled chairs and some seated on the iron fence which fringes\nthe drive. The reunions which occur at that gate are exceedingly public.\nOur East Ender is perhaps accustomed to publicity; his slum does not\nconceal its feelings--it quarrels, and makes love, without drawn blinds,\nand privacy is not an essential of its ardours. Be that as it may, these\nmeetings at the hospital gate, which are not lacking in pathos, have\nsometimes manifested a tear-compelling comicality when the actors in the\ndrama belonged to the class which produced Bert.\nIn a higher class there is restraint and a rather stupid bashfulness. I\nhave seen a wounded youngster flush apprehensively and only peck his\nmother in return for her sobbing embrace. That is not Bert's way. He\nknows--he is not a fool--that his mother looks a trifle absurd as, with\nbonnet awry, she surges perspiringly past the sentries, the tails of her\nskirt dragging in the dust and her feet flattened with the weight of\nover-clad, unwholesome obesity they have to bear. But he hobbles sprily\nto meet her, and his salute is no mere peck, but a smacking kiss, so\nnoisy that it makes everyone laugh. He laughs too--perhaps he did it on\npurpose to raise a laugh: that is his quaint method; but the fact\nremains that, whatever his motive, he has managed to please his mother.\nShe is sniffing loudly yet laughing also, and one could want no better\npicture of human affection than this of Bermondsey Bert and his\nshapeless, work-distorted, maybe bibulous-looking mother, exchanging\nthat resounding and ungraceful kiss at the hospital gate. I have heard\nBert shout \"Mother!\" from a hundred yards off, when he spied her coming\nthrough the gate. No false shame there! No smug \"good form\" in that--nor\nin the time-honoured jest which follows: \"And 'ave you remembered to\nbring me a bottle of beer, mother?\" (Of course visitors are not allowed\nto introduce alcohol into the hospital--otherwise I am afraid there is\nno doubt that mother would have obliged.)\nIn one of our wards we harboured, for a while, a costermonger. This\ncoster, an entertaining and plucky creature who had to have a leg\namputated, received no callers on visiting day: his own relatives were\ndead and he and his wife had separated. \"Couldn't 'it it orf,\" he\nexplained, and with laudable impartiality added, \"Married beneath 'er,\nshe did, w'en she married me.\" As the lady was herself a coster, it was\nplain that here, as in other grades of society, there are degrees,\nconventions and barriers which may not be lightly overstepped. \"Sister,\"\nhowever, thought that the patient should inform his wife that he had\nlost his leg, and prevailed on him to send her a letter to that effect.\nA few days later he was asked,\n\"Well, did you write and tell your wife you had lost a leg?\"\n\"Yus.\"\n\"I suppose she's answered? What has she said?\"\n\"Said 'm a liar!\"\nHer retort had neither disconcerted nor offended him. He was a\nphilosopher--and, like so many of his kind, a laughing philosopher. When\nhe was sufficiently recovered from his operation to get about on\ncrutches he was the wag of the ward. He took a special delight in those\npractical jokes which are invented by patients to tease the nurses, and\ndevoted the most painstaking ingenuity to their preparation. It was he\nwho found a small hole in the lath-and-plaster wall which separates the\nward from the ward's kitchen. Through this hole a length of cotton was\npassed and tied to the handle of a mug on the kitchen shelf. At this\nperiod, owing to the Zeppelin raids, only the barest minimum of light\nwas allowed, and the night nurse, when she entered the kitchen, went\ninto almost complete darkness. No sooner was she in the kitchen and\nfumbling for what she required than a faint noise--that of the cup being\ntwitched by the cotton leading to the mischievous coster's bed--arose on\nthe shelf and convinced her that she was in the presence of a mouse. She\nretreated, and perhaps if any convalescent patient had been awake she\nwould have enlisted his aid to expel the mouse; but in the ward the\npatients were, as one man, snoring vociferously. It was this slightly\noverdone snoring, at the finish, which gave birth to suspicions and\ncaused the trick to be detected.\nThe night nurses do not have a placid time of it if their patients\nare at the stage of recovery when spirits begin to rise and\nthe early slumber-hour which the hospital rules prescribe is not\nwelcome. String-actuated knaveries, more or less similar to the\nmouse-in-the-kitchen one, are always devised for the plaguing of a new\nnight nurse. Sometimes in the dead of night, when utter silence broods\nover the ward, the gramophone will abruptly burst into raucous music:\nits mechanism has been released by a contrivance which gives no clue to\nthe crime's perpetrator. The flustered nurse gropes her way down the\nward and stops the gramophone, every patient meanwhile sitting up in bed\nand protesting against her cruelty in having awakened them by starting\nit. Half an hour after the ward has quietened, the other gramophone\n(some wards own two) whirrs off into impudent song: it also has been\nprimed. Nurse is wiser on future occasions: she stows the gramophones,\nwhen she comes on duty, where no one can tamper with them. Even so, she\nmay have her nerves preyed upon by eerie tinklings, impossible to locate\nin the darkness; these are caused by two knives, hung from a nail fixed\nhigh up in the rafters. By jiggling a string, which is conducted over\nanother rafter and down the wall to his pillow, the patient makes the\nknifeblades clash. Sometimes two strings, leading to different beds,\ncomplete this instrument of torture. After a determined search, nurse\nfinds one string, and, having cut it, flatters herself that she has got\nthe better of her enemies. Not a bit of it. She has scarcely settled in\nher chair again before the tinklings recommence. The second string is in\naction; and as she hunts about the ward for the source of the melody in\nthe ceiling, muffled convulsions of mirth, from the dim rows of beds,\nfurnish evidence that her naughty charges are not getting the repose\nwhich they require and to ensure which is part of the purpose of her\npresence.\nA nurse who happens to be unpopular never has these pranks played upon\nher. They are in the nature of a compliment. Nor do they occur in a\nward where there is a patient seriously ill. It is impossible to imagine\nwar-hospital patients acting inconsiderately towards a distressed\ncomrade. This observation renders all the more amusing the scandalised\nconcern which I once beheld on the demure physiognomy of a visiting\nclergyman when he gathered the drift of certain allusions to a case on\nthe Danger List.\nThe name of the Danger List explains itself. When a patient is put on\nthe Danger List, his relatives are sent for and may be with him whether\nit is the visiting afternoon or not. (If they come from the provinces\nthey are presented with a railway pass and, if poor, are allotted\nlodgings near the hospital, a grant being made to them from our\nBenevolent Fund.) For the information of the V.A.D.'s who answer\nvisitors' questions in the Enquiry Bureau at the main entrance to the\nhospital, a copy of the Danger List hangs there, and it is on record\nthat an awestruck child, seeing this column of patients' names, and\nreading the heading, asked, \"What does 'Danger List' mean? Does it mean\nthat it's dangerous to go near them?\" Now in Ward C 22 a patient, a\ncockney, was on the Danger List--which circumstance availed nothing to\ndepress his spirits. In spite of considerable pain, he poked fun at the\nprospect of his own imminent demise, and was himself the chief offender\nagainst the edict of quietness which \"Sister\" had issued for her ward.\nHe _would_ talk; and he _would_ talk about undertakers, post-mortems,\nepitaphs and the details of a military funeral. \"That there top note of\nthe Last Post on the bugle doesn't 'arf sound proper,\" he said--a\nverdict which anyone who has heard this beautiful and inspired fanfare,\nwhich is the farewell above a soldier's grave, and which ends on a\nsoaring treble, will endorse. \"But,\" he went on, \"if the bugler's 'ad a\ndrop o' somethin' warm on the way to the cemetery, that there top note\nalways reminds me of a 'iccup. An' if 'e 'iccups over me, I shall wanter\nspit in 'is eye, blimey if I won't.\"\nThis persiflage had been going on for a couple of days and getting to be\nmore and more elaborate and allusive, infecting the entire ward, so\nthat the fact that the man was on the Danger List had become a kind of\ncatchword amongst his fellows. Entered, in all innocence, the clergyman.\n(\"The very bloke to put me up to all the tricks!\"--from the irreverent\none.) At the same moment a walking patient, also a cockney, who had been\nreading a newspaper, gave vent to a cry of feigned horror. \"Boys!\" he\nannounced, \"it says 'ere there's a shortage of timber!\"\nGuffaws greeted this sally. Everyone saw the innuendo at once--everyone\nexcept the clergyman, and when he grasped the point, that Ol' Chum\nSo-and-So was on the Danger List and a shortage of timber was supposed\nto imply that he might be done out of a coffin, he was visibly shocked.\nPerhaps he did not understand cockney humour.... However, one may add\nthat our irrepressible friend, at the moment of writing, is off the\nDanger List (albeit only after a protracted struggle with the Enemy at\nwhom he jeered), and is now contriving to be as funny about life as he\nwas funny--and fearless--about Death.\nI caught sight to-day of another cockney acquaintance of mine, whose\nChristian name is Bill, trundling himself down the hospital drive in a\nwheeled chair. Perched on the knee of his one leg, with its feet planted\non the stump which is all that is left of the other, was his child, aged\nfour. Beside him walked his wife, resplendent in a magenta blouse and a\nhat with green and pink plumes.\nThe trio looked happy, and Mrs. Bill's gala attire was symbolical. When\nBill was in my ward he too was on the Danger List. I remember that when\nhe first came to us, before his operation, and before he took a turn for\nthe worse, his wife visited him in that same magenta blouse (or another\nequally startling) and that for some reason she and \"Sister\" did not\nquite hit it off, \"had words,\" and subsequently for a period were not on\nspeaking terms. Later, when Bill underwent his operation, and began to\nsink, his bed was moved out on to the ward's verandah. Here his wife\n(now wearing a subdued blouse) sat beside him, hour after hour, while\nlittle Bill, the child, towed a cheap wooden engine up and down the\ngrass patch, oblivious to the ordeal through which his parents were\npassing. It was my business, as orderly, to intrude at intervals upon\nthe scene on the verandah, to bring Bill such food as he was able to\ntolerate. On the first occasion, after Bill's collapse, that I prepared\nto take him a cup of tea, Sister stopped me. \"Don't forget to take tea,\nand some bread and butter, to that poor woman. She looks tired. And some\nmilk for the child.\" \"Very good, Sister.\" I cut bread-and-butter, and\nfilled an extra mug of tea. \"Orderly! What are you doing?\" Sister had\nreappeared. And I was rebuked because I was going to offer Mrs. Bill her\ntea in a tin mug (the patients all have tin mugs) and had cut her\nbread-and-butter too thick. I must cut dainty slices of thin\nbread-and-butter, use Sister's own china ware, and serve the whole\nspread on a tray with a cloth. All of which was typical of Sister, who\nfrom that day treated Bill's wife with true tenderness; and Bill's wife\nbecame one of Sister's most enthusiastic adorers.\nIt came to pass, after a week of pitiful anxiety, that the Medical\nOfficer pronounced Bill safe once more. \"Bloke says I'm not goin' ter\npeg art,\" he told me. I congratulated him and remarked that his wife\nwould be thankful when he met her, on her arrival, with such splendid\nnews. \"I'll 'ave the larf of my missus,\" said Bill. \"W'en she comes, I\nshall tell 'er I've some serious noos for 'er, and she's ter send the\nkid darn on the grarse ter play. Then I'll pull a long fice and hask 'er\nter bear up, and say I'm sorry for 'er, and she mustn't tike it too\nrough, and all that; and she 'as my sympathy in 'er diserpointment: _she\nain't ter get 'er widow's pension arter all_!\"\nI believe that this programme was carried through, more or less to the\nletter. Certain it is that I myself overheard another of Bill's grim\npleasantries. He was explaining to madame that they must apprentice\ntheir offspring to the engineering trade. \"I wanter mike Lil' Bill a\nmowter chap, so's 'e can oil the ball-bearings of me fancy leg wot I'm\nter get at Roehampton.\" The \"fancy leg\" ended by being the favourite\ntheme of Bill's disgraceful extravaganzas. He would announce to Sister,\nwhen she was dressing his stump, that he had been studying means of\nearning his living in the future, and had decided to become a professor\nof roller skating. He would loudly tell his wife that she would never\nagain be able to summons him for assault by kicking: the fancy leg would\nnot give the real one sufficient purchase for an effective kick. And she\nwas not to complain, in future, about his cold feet against her back in\nbed: there would be only one cold foot, the other would be unhitched and\non the floor. And of course there were endless jokes about what had been\ndone with the amputated leg, whether it had got a tombstone, and so\nforth: some of the suggestions going a trifle beyond what good taste, in\nmore fastidious coteries, would have thought permissible. But Bill had\nhis own ideas of the humorous, and maybe his own no less definite ideas\nof dignity. In this latter virtue I counted the fact that although once\nor twice, when he was very low, he gave way to a little fretting to me,\nhe never, I am convinced, let fall one querulous word in the presence of\nhis wife. She sat by her husband's side, and when things were at their\nworst the two said naught. The wife numbly watched her Bill's face,\nturning now and then to glance at the activities of little Bill with his\nengine, or to smile her thanks to the patients who sometimes came and\ngave the child pickaback rides. When I intruded, I knew I was\ninterrupting the communings of a loving and happily married pair; and\nthe \"slangings\" of each other which signalised Bill's recovery and his\nwife's relief, did nothing to shake my certitude that, like many slum\ndwellers, they owned a mutual esteem which other couples, of superior\nstation, might envy.\nPersonally I have never known a cockney patient who did not evoke\naffection; and as a matter of curiosity I have been asking a number of\nSisters whether they liked to have cockneys in their wards. Without a\nsingle exception (and let me say that Sisters are both observant and\ncritical) the answers have been enthusiastically in the affirmative.\nXIII\nTHE STATION PARTY\nAn earnest shopman not long ago tried to sell me a pair of\nmarching-boots, \"for use\"--as he explained, lest their name should have\nmisled me--\"on the march.\" Had he said \"for use after the war\" he might\nhave been more persuasive. When I told him that marching-boots were no\ngood to me, it was manifestly difficult for him to conceal his opinion\nthat, if so, I had no business to flaunt the garb of Thomas Atkins. When\nI added that if he could offer me a pair of running-shoes I might\nentertain the proposition, his look was a reproach to irreverent\nfacetiousness.\nA grateful country has presented me with one pair of excellent\nmarching-boots. But a hospital ward is no place in which to go clumping\nabout in footgear designed to stand hard wear and tear on the\nhigh-roads; and my army boots, after two years, have not yet needed\nre-soling. I wore them, it is true, during my period of service with the\nChain Gang, as a squad of outdoor orderlies, engaged in road-making, was\nlocally called. And I wear them when we have a \"C.O.'s Parade\"--an\noccasion on which naught but officially-provided attire is allowable. It\nwould take a century of C.O.'s parades, however, to damage boots put on\nfive minutes before the event and taken off five minutes after: the\nparade itself necessitating no sturdier pedestrianism than is involved\nin walking less than a hundred yards to the ground and there standing\nstock-still at attention.\nI do not say that hospital orderlies never go for a march: only that\nmarching bulks relatively so small in our programme that any special\nequipment for the purpose sounds a little ironical. The issue of\nward-shoes, now, was a real boon. Not that all the pairs with which our\nunit was suddenly flooded by the authorities proved as silent as they\nwere intended to be. Some of them squeaked; and the peregrinations of\nthe orderly thus afflicted were perhaps more vexatious to the ear of a\nnervous patient at night than even the clatter of honest hobnails. And\nthe soles were thin. A pair of ward-shoes lasted me on the average one\nmonth. If only worn within the ward they might have lasted\nlonger--though not so very much longer. According to regulations, you\nwere not allowed to wear ward-shoes except within the confines of the\nward. No doubt it was expected that every time you were sent on an\nerrand outside the ward you would solemnly take off your ward-shoes and\nput on your marching-boots--then, on the return, take off your\nmarching-boots and put on your ward-shoes--but life as a nursing orderly\nis too short for such elaborations of etiquette. It was nothing unusual,\nwhen one was working in a ward which lay at a distance of quarter of a\nmile from the hospital's main building, to be sent to the said main\nbuilding a dozen times in a single morning. This incessant\nmessage-bearing had to be done, if not at the double, at any rate at\nnothing slower than five miles per hour in the morning (the busy time);\nin the afternoon a speed of four miles per hour might sometimes be\npermissible. At all events, running-shoes, as I told the shopman, would\nnot have been inappropriate during certain periods of crisis.\nFrom time to time our tasks were interrupted by the notes of a bugle--or\nthe shrilling of the Sergeant-Major's whistle--demanding our presence\nfor an intake of new patients. A party of orderlies was wanted to go to\nthe railway-station to help to remove stretcher-cases from the ambulance\ntrain. The station lies at a distance of a mile from the hospital, and\nthis small pilgrimage, achieved a few score times, is practically all I\nknow of the veritable employment of marching-boots.\nI regretted when a change of plans diverted the ambulance trains to the\ncentral termini for evacuation. The interlude of a station-party trip\nwas far from unwelcome. Lined up on the parade ground we were put in\ncharge of a corporal. \"Party, 'shun! Right turn! Quick march!\" Off we\ntrudged, round the back of the hospital, down the drive, out past the\nsentry and away along the road. Presently, \"Party, march at ease!\"\nCigarettes were lit, talking was allowed, and someone would raise a\ntune. How pleasant it is to march to singing! To march to a\ndrum-and-fife band must be wonderful. Or a brass band--! Those joys will\nnever be mine. Almost all the marching I shall have done in the great\nwar will be summed up in these tiny promenades from the hospital to the\nrailway-station, their rhythm sustained by self-raised choruses, none\ntoo melodious.\nOccasionally an officer would be descried, on the pavement. Then \"Party,\n'shun!\" Cigarettes were concealed. The song died. \"Eyes left! ... Eyes\nfront! Party, march at ease!\" The cigarettes reappeared, the song was\nresumed. Approaching the station, \"Party, 'shun!\" Cigarettes were thrown\naway. Here, in the chief street, we must make a smart show. A crowd is\ngathered round the station gate, attracted by the array of Red Cross\nvehicles within. Police are keeping back the curious. The way is\ncleared for our arrival. \"Left wheel!\" Now is our one moment of glory.\nWe swing round, through the lane of gaping sightseers, and tramp-tramp\nin style across the station yard and under the archway, flattering\nourselves (perhaps not without justification) that there are spectators\nwhose eyes pursue us with secret envy at the serious import of our task.\nThe station platform, when we reached it, was generally a blank\nperspective devoid of all living creatures except ourselves. Fate\ndecreed that we should be summoned long before the train was due. I have\nkicked my heels for many a doleful hour on that platform, and the\nreflection that \"they also serve who only stand and wait\" was chilly\ncomfort if--as frequently happened--we had been hurried off dinnerless.\nThe convoys' arrivals always seemed to coincide with dinner-time. On our\nreturn to the hospital we should find that the rations had been kept hot\nfor us. But, in the meanwhile, an empty stomach was a poor preparation\nfor the strain of carrying stretchers up the stairs from the station\nplatform to the ambulances; and those of us who could produce pennies\nfor automatic-machine chocolate gained an instant popularity. The\nlongest period of waiting drew to an end at last, however. The platform\nassumed a livelier air. The station-master appeared from his den.\nOfficers of the Army Medical Service and the Red Cross strolled down.\nAnd the stairs and platform echoed to the pattering of the feet of hosts\nof industrious \"Bluebottles,\" fetching stretchers and blankets.\nThe blue-uniformed volunteers who form a portion of the London Ambulance\nColumn are nicknamed the Bluebottles in allusion to their dress. It is a\nnickname which, let me say at once, any man might be proud of. I know\nnot whether the history of the Bluebottles has yet been written, but\ncertain it is that their doings have got into newspaper print less often\nthan they deserved. For theirs is a double r\u00f4le which truly merits the\ncountry's admiration. While carrying on the commerce of the Empire--that\nvital commerce without which there would be bankruptcy and no sinews of\nwar, nor indeed any England left to defend--they have vowed themselves\nalso, of their own free-will, to the helping of the wounded. Day or\nnight the Bluebottle is liable to be called from his desk or his home by\nthe telephone: like the Florentine Brother of the Misericordia he must\ninstantly hurry into his uniform and rush to the place appointed. He may\nbe busy or he may be tired; no matter: his vow holds good. Off he goes,\nto the railway-station to meet the hospital train and evacuate its\nstretchers.\nMyself, I have the deepest respect for the Bluebottles and for their\nenergy in a cause which must often be not only fatiguing, but, from a\ncommercial point of view, extremely inconvenient. It would be absurd to\npretend, nevertheless, that the less responsible khaki-wearing R.A.M.C.\ndo not cherish a mild contempt for all Bluebottles. There is no reason\nfor that contempt. It is idiotic, childish--a humiliating exhibition of\nthe silliness of masculine human nature. Members of our station-party\nwho had enlisted but a week back, and who knew nothing whatever of\ntheir work, would, in a whisper, mock the Bluebottles--although every\nBluebottle had taken first-aid classes and passed examinations at which\nmost of the mockers would have boggled. The Bluebottles were \"civilians\"\n... there you have it. We--who would probably never do any battlefield\nsoldiering in our lives--looked down on all civilians who had the\nimpudence to wear a uniform of any sort. Such is the behaviour of the\nsterner sex at a moment when its sole thought should be of sensible and\nefficient co-operation in the performance of duty.\nFor of course it was our duty to co-operate with the Bluebottles. The\ntheory with which we beguiled ourselves, that the Bluebottles were\nphysically starvelings and required our Herculean aid to lift the\nstretchers up the stairs, was palpably nonsense. Still we told ourselves\nthat we, as disciplined soldiers, were here to give a hand to a civilian\nmob who might otherwise faint and fail. A singular delusion! Time has\nproved its falsity, for with the issue of fresh orders our\nstation-parties ceased to function: the Bluebottles now make shift\nwithout us--and without, as far as I know, any mishap.\nThe hospital train was eventually signalled. We were ranked, at\nattention, at the foot of the stairs. The Bluebottles stood by their\nstretchers. There was hurrying hither and thither of officials.\nSometimes our Colonel, having motored from the hospital, appeared on the\nplatform to see that all was well, and you may be sure that we\nendeavoured to look alert in his august presence. And finally the train\nglided into the station.\nThe hospital trains seemed to be never twice the same: South Westerns,\nNorth Westerns, Great Northerns, Midlands, Great Centrals, Lancashire\nand Yorkshires--I saw them all, at one time or another, their sole\naffinity being the staring red crosses painted on each coach. A coach or\ntwo consisted of ordinary compartments, for sitting-up cases; the rest\nwere vans the interiors of which had been converted into wards by means\nof bunks. Access to each van-ward was gained by a wide pair of sliding\ndoors in its centre. These doors, when the train had come to a\nstandstill, were opened by pallid-looking orderlies, who lowered\ngangways and then gazed forth at us, while they awaited orders, with the\nlack-lustre eyes of men who had been deprived of the proper allowance of\nsleep.\nAs soon as the list of the Medical Officer on the train had been checked\nwith that of the Medical Officer on the platform, the evacuation began.\nWalking-cases were sent off first--generally a tatterdemalion crew,\nhobbling and shuffling along the platform, and, at one stage of the war,\nwith trench mud still clinging to their clothes. They seldom needed our\nassistance: the Bluebottles (even if feeble folk) were deemed by our\ncorporal to be fit to give any weak walking patient an arm, or carry his\nkit. The walking patients, in fact, were a mere episode. Motor-cars\nwhirled them off, five or six at a time, and they might be half through\nthe process of being bathed at the hospital before the last\nstretcher-case was quit of the train. The stretcher cases were our\nconcern. Pairs of Bluebottles, each carrying a stretcher, entered the\nvan-wards and anon reappeared with their burden. Now came our cue to\nact. As the stretcher approached the foot of the stair two of our number\nstepped forth from the rank, each taking a handle from a Bluebottle; the\nstretcher thus proceeded on its course up the stair carried by four men,\none on each handle--two Bluebottles and two R.A.M.C.'s.\nThat flight of iron stairs from the platform to the road seemed no very\narduous ordeal for the first half-dozen journeys. There was a knack\nabout keeping the stretcher horizontal: the front bearers must hold\ntheir handles as low as possible; the rear bearers must hoist their\nhandles shoulder-high. It was all plain sailing and perfectly easy. Four\nmen to a stretcher is luxurious. At least it is luxurious on the level,\nand if you have not far to go and not many consecutive stretchers to\ncarry. But when the convoy was a large one, when the bearers were too\nfew and you had no sooner got rid of one stretcher than you must run\ndown the stairs and, without regaining your breath, grab the handle of\nanother and slowly toil up again to the ambulances ... yes, even on the\ncoldest day it was possible to be moist with perspiration; and as for\nthe hot weather of the 1915 summer, when one of our Big Pushes was\nafoot, or when returned prisoners came from Germany (those were\nmemorable occasions!)--you might be pardoned a certain aching in the\narm-muscles.\nIt was on one of these busy days that I discovered that the comical\nprejudice of khaki against the Bluebottles was not (as I had hitherto\nsupposed) confined to the young swashbucklers of the home-staying\nR.A.M.C. It was seldom our custom to enter the hospital trains. An\nunwritten law decreed that Bluebottles only should enter the train: the\nR.A.M.C. limited themselves to carrying work outside, on the platform\nand stair. But on this occasion the supply of Bluebottles had, for the\nmoment, run short, and our party took a turn at going up the gangways\nand evacuating the van-wards. As it happened, I and my mate on the\nstretcher were the first khaki-wearers to invade that particular\nvan-ward. And as we steered our stretcher in at the door and down the\naisle of cots a shout arose from the wounded lying there: \"Here are some\nreal soldiers!\"\nIt was too bad. It was base ingratitude to the devoted band of\nBluebottles who had, up till that instant, been toiling at the\nevacuation of the ward--and who, as I chanced to know, had been up all\nthe previous night, carrying stretchers at Paddington and Charing Cross,\nwhile _we_ slept cosily. But--well, there it was. \"Here are some real\nsoldiers!\" Khaki greeted khaki--simultaneously spurning the mere\namateur, the civilian. I could have blushed for the injustice of that\nna\u00efve cry. But it would be dishonest not to confess that there was\nsomething gratifying about it too. It was the cry of the Army, always\nloyal to the Army. These heroic bundles of bandages, lifting wild and\nunshaven faces from their pillows, hailed _me_ (a wretched creature who\nhad never heard a gun go off) as one of their comrades! My mate and I,\nas we adjusted our stretcher at a cot's side, and braced ourselves\nagainst the weight of the patient, winked covertly at one another. \"A\nnasty one for the Bluebottles!\" he said. And it was.\nAll the same I seize this opportunity of offering my homage to the\nBluebottles. They have done--are still doing--their bit, and that right\nnobly. Thousands of British soldiers have cause to bless them and also\nto be thankful for the existence of that great voluntary institution,\nthe London Ambulance Column.\n*       *       *       *       *\nWhen at last the train had been emptied and the ultimate stretcher was\n_en route_ for the hospital, our party gathered once more at the top of\nthe stair, lined up, and was glanced-over by the corporal lest any man\nhad seized the opportunity to play truant. There were occasions when\nsome thirsty soul, chafing at the rigours of the strict teetotalism\nenforced by our rules, was found to have vanished in the hurly-burly:\nhis destination, the up-platform refreshment-bar, being readily\nsurmisable. He had cause to regret his lapse if it were noticed before\nhe slipped back unostentatiously into our ranks. Then, \"Party, 'shun!\nLeft turn! Right incline--quick march!\" Off we swung, out into the\nstreets--cheered by the urchins who still hovered round the gate--and\nso, at the rapidest possible pace, home to dinner and a smoke: these (in\nmy case at any rate) being preceded by the thankful relinquishment of my\nseldom-worn and therefore none too friendly marching-boots.\nXIV\nSLANG IN A WAR HOSPITAL\nEvery ward in the hospital has a bathroom attached to it, but in\naddition to these there are two large bathrooms, each containing a\nnumber of baths, which are used by walking patients and also by the\norderlies. The more recently built of these bathrooms is divided into\nprivate cubicles. In the older one the baths are on a more sociable\nplan, with no partition walls sundering them. The spectacle, in the\n\"old\" bathroom, when a convoy of walking cases has arrived, is one which\nshould appeal to a painter. Clouds of steam fill the air, and through\nthe fog you perceive a fine m\u00eal\u00e9e of figures, some half dressed, some\nstatuesquely nude, towelling themselves or preparing to wash, or shaving\nat bits of mirror propped on the window-sills. Pink bodies wallow\nvoluptuously in the deep porcelain-ware tubs, which are of the shape and\nsuperb dimensions of Egyptian sarcophagi. Sometimes a patient with a\nwounded arm, unable to help himself, is being soaped and sponged by an\norderly; or you may see a cheerful soul, with an injured foot, balanced\non the rim of the bath and giving himself all the ablutions which are\npracticable without the disturbance of bandages. No one who has\nfrequented our bathrooms would ever doubt that the British Army loves\ncleanliness and hot water. Of cold water I cannot speak with the same\nenthusiasm.\nA newly-arrived convoy of course monopolises the bathroom; but\nthroughout the whole day, at almost any hour, you will find a patient or\ntwo here; for by the rule of the hospital it is allowable for any\npatient--once he has been given permission to take an unsupervised bath\nat all--to take a bath whenever he likes. Consequently it happens often\nthat half a dozen orderlies may be bathing at the same time as half a\ndozen patients--and it need not be added that the occasion is one for\npleasant chats and the barter of anecdotes. For this reason, if for no\nother, I always elected to use the \"old\" bathroom: the \"new\" one, with\nits closed cubicles, was less fruitful in conversations.\nThe \"old\" bathroom was the exchange (and perhaps the starting-point) of\nmany of our hospital rumours. I imagine that every war hospital is a\nhotbed of rumours. Ours certainly was, and is. Amongst the orderlies\nthere are incessant rumours about promotions, about the chances of the\nunit being sent abroad, about surprise inspections, about the imminent\narrival of impossibly large convoys, about news--received privately by\nthe Colonel over the telephone--of defeats or victories. Nine times out\nof ten the rumour turns out to be groundless. But this does not cause\nthe output of rumours to diminish. Apparently the army is a prolific\nsoil for rumours, inasmuch as they have a special name: a rumour is\ncalled a _buzz_. \"Only a buzz\" (\"it's only a rumour\") is an expression\noften heard on the lips of soldiers. In India it is sometimes \"a bazaar\nbuzz\" (a rumour circulating in the bazaars); here it is, naturally, a\nbathroom buzz.\nMany were the choice examples of slang and of colloquialisms which I\nculled in the bathroom, sitting comfortably in my bath and communing\nwith my neighbour in the next bath. I remember one morning making the\nacquaintance of an Australian who had recently recovered from a bad\nattack of trench feet. Four of the toes of one foot were missing, and\nthe fifth looked far from sound. My friend was examining this lonely toe\nwith a critical gaze, and I sympathised with him over its condition.\n\"Ah!\" he said, \"that toe is a king to what it was.\" He went on to tell\nme (what I could well believe) that to get your \"plates of meat\"\nfrostbitten wasn't such a \"cushy wound\" as it was cracked up to be by\nthose who had never experienced its sufferings. \"When I went sick the\ndoctor thought he'd rumbled me swinging the lead. But as soon as he\nspotted them there toes of mine--the ones that's gone--I could see he\nknew I'd clicked a packet, square dinkum, this trip.\" (\"Square dinkum\"\nor \"dinkum\" is an Antipodean verbal flourish, which broadly\napproximates to the American \"Sure enough\" or the English \"Not 'arf.\")\nCertain of these neologisms are common enough in civilian life--have\nbeen imported into the army since 1914--but others (and the more\ninteresting ones, as I hold) were, until the war, limited to the\nbarrack-room. British regiments which had been abroad used an argot of\nconsiderable antiquity, some of it of Oriental origin (_e.g._ \"blighty,\"\nmeaning \"home\": hence \"a blighty wound,\" or simply \"a blighty,\" an\ninjury sufficiently serious to cause the victim to be invalided to\nEngland). Whether the derivations of army slang have been investigated I\ndo not know. It appears to me to be a subject worth examination. I am\nnot myself a philologist, but in the bathrooms and elsewhere in the\nhospital I have heard and noted a small collection of slang phrases and\nidioms, and these may be worth recording. Such expressions as \"swinging\nthe lead\" (malingering or deceiving or acting in a hypocritical manner\nor getting the better of anyone) have lost their novelty. So has\n\"rumbled,\" which means to be discovered or detected or found out. These\nwords have now spread far beyond the confines of the army. And indeed\nthe rapidity with which all slang and all catch-phrases can be\ndisseminated offers a rather alarming prospect. For whereas, before the\nwar, slang at its silliest was often quite local, nowadays its\nrestriction within given localities has in the nature of things become\nimpossible. A war hospital such as ours contains inmates from every\ncounty in Britain, as well as from every colony. The same intermingling\noccurs on an infinitely greater scale in training-camps and at the\nvarious fronts. All these centres are hotbeds of slang: the men go home\nfrom them, carrying to their native places slang which would never, in\nordinary times, have penetrated there. In the army you will hear a\nScotchman doing what he never did before--dropping his aitches. He has\ncaught it from his English comrades. You will hear him say \"Not\n'arf\"--an inane tag which, despite its popularity in London, failed to\nfind any foothold north of the Tweed before the war. \"Not 'arf\" was\nmouthed by Sassenach comedians on the music-hall stages of Edinburgh\nand Glasgow, and was grinned at for what it was worth: the streets did\nnot adopt it. Now the streets will hear it and will use it: it is one of\nJock's souvenirs from his campaign.\nI am afraid that another triviality which has hitherto been to the taste\nonly of the south of England is fated to \"catch on,\" by means of the\nsame missionaries, from Land's End to John o' Groat's, and even in the\ncolonies. Rhyming slang is extraordinarily common in the army, so common\nthat it is used with complete unconsciousness as being correct\nconversational English. My friend of the king-like toe spoke of his feet\nas \"plates of meat\"--and this though he was an Australian, not a\ncockney. If he had had occasion to allude to his leg he would probably\nhave called it \"Scotch peg.\" A man's arm is his \"false alarm\"; his nose,\n\"I suppose\"; his eye, \"mince pie\"; his hand, \"German band\"; his boot,\n\"daisy root\"; his face \"chevvy chase\"; and so forth--an interminable\nlist. What exactly was the _raison d'\u00eatre_ of this pseudo-poetic mania I\ndo not know, but I suspect that it originated, in the distant past,\nwith the poverty of rhyme-invention on the part of the writers of the\ncruder kind of pantomime songs--\"round the houses,\" for example, being\nboth a rhyme to and a synonym for \"trousies\" (garments beloved of those\nbards!)--and thus the vogue developed. This is only a theory. The one\nthing certain is that a clumsy form of slang, devoid of the humour and\ncompactness which justify slang--and which were on the whole once\ncharacteristic of metropolitan slang--has tickled the ear of some\nmillions of men who, but for the war, would never have fallen under its\ntemptation. The only thing to hope for is that it will run its course\nand perish--like \"What ho, she bumps!\" and \"Now we shan't be\nlong!\"--without leaving any visible and permanent trace upon the\nlanguage.\n\"Clicked,\" another word used by my trench-feet associate, resembles much\nmodern slang in the breadth and elasticity of its application. To click\ncan be either advantageous or baneful, according to the circumstances. A\nsoldier asks a superior for a favour, and it is granted. That soldier\nhas clicked. Or if he finds a nice girl to walk out with, he has\nclicked. Or if he is given a coveted post, he has clicked. But he has\nalso clicked if he is suddenly seized on to do some menial duty. He has\nclicked if he is discovered in a misdeed. And he has clicked a packet if\nhe gets into trouble generally. On such an occasion, it may be added,\nthe N.C.O. or officer who administers a reproof (\"ticks him off\"), and\ndoes so in angry terms, \"goes in off the deep end.\"\nNot all army slang is lacking, indeed, in a facetious irony. Miserable\nconditions in the desert or in the trenches, bad accommodation, doubtful\nfood--anything which cannot arouse the faintest enthusiasm of any\nsort--these, in the lingo of our now much-travelled and stoical troops,\nare \"nothing to write home about.\" Surely there is an admirable spirit\nin this sarcasm. It crops up again in the hospital metaphor \"going to\nthe pictures.\" That is Tommy's way of announcing that he is to go under\nthe surgeon's knife, on a visit to the operating theatre. Again, there\nis a sardonic tang in the army's condemnation of one who has been\ntelling a far-fetched story: he has been \"chancing his arm\" (or \"mit\").\nSimilarly one detects an oblique and wry fun in the professional army\nman's use of the word \"sieda\" to mean \"socks.\" (The new army more feebly\ndubs them \"almond rocks.\") \"Sieda\" has been brought by the Anzacs from\nCairo, and with them it means \"Good morning!\"--a mere friendly hail, now\nused with great frequency. But the veterans of older expeditions in\nEgypt and in India, when they had been on the march, took their socks\nfrom their perspiring feet and lay down to sleep; and in the\nmorning--well, their socks said \"Sieda!\" to them when they awoke, and\nwere christened accordingly.... Or again, the socks (or other property)\nmight have vanished in the night--in which case there had been \"hooks\nabout\" (pilferers about). If one of those \"hooks\" were caught, he would\nbe first \"rammed in the mush\" (put in the guardroom), and then, if his\nguilt were established, he would be observed \"going over the wall\" or\n\"going to stir\" (going to the detention prison).\nA few other slang words which I have come across in the hospital, and\nwhich seem to me to bear the mark of the old army as distinct from the\nnew, are: \"bondook,\" a rifle; \"sound scoff\" (to the bugler, to sound\nRations); \"scran,\" victuals, rations; \"weighing out,\" paying out;\n\"chucking a dummy,\" being absent; \"get the wind up,\" be afraid (and \"put\nthe wind up,\" make afraid); \"the home farm,\" the married quarters;\n\"chips,\" the pioneer sergeant (carpenter); \"tank,\" wet canteen;\n\"tank-wallah,\" a drinker; \"tanked,\" drunk; \"A.T.A. wallah,\" a\nteetotaller (from the Army Temperance Association); \"on the cot\" or \"on\nthe tack,\" being teetotal; \"jammy,\" lucky (and \"jam,\" any sort of good\nfortune); \"win,\" to steal; \"burgoo,\" porridge; \"eye-wash,\" making things\noutwardly presentable; \"gone west,\" died (also applied to things broken,\n_e.g._ a broken pipe has \"gone west\"); \"oojah,\" anything (similar to\nthingummy or what-d'ye-call-it); \"push,\" \"pusher,\" or \"square push,\" a\ngirl (hence \"square-push tunic,\" the \"swagger\" tunic for walking-out\noccasions). The words for drunkenness are innumerable--\"jingled,\"\n\"oiled,\" \"tanked to the wide,\" \"well sprung,\" \"up the pole,\" \"blotto,\"\netc.; but I smell the modern in some of these; their flavour is of\nLondon taverns rather than of the dusty barrack squares of India, Egypt,\nMalta, and Gibraltar.\nBut who can delve to the ultimate springs of slang? A verb which I never\nmet before I enlisted was \"to spruce.\" This is almost, if not quite, a\nblend of \"swinging the lead\" and \"doing a mike.\" To spruce is to dodge\nduty or to deceive. A man who contrived to slip out of the ranks of a\nsquad when they were performing some distasteful task would be said to\n\"spruce off.\" Or he would be denounced as a \"sprucer\" if he managed to\narrive late for his meal and yet, by a trick, to secure a front place in\nthe waiting queue at the canteen. A word in constant employment,\n\"spruce\"! It was new to me when I became an orderly, and for a long time\nI thought that it was peculiar to our unit, in the same manner that the\njargon of certain boys is peculiar to certain schools. But I concluded\nlater that it might have a remote and roundabout origin in the old army\nslang, \"a spruce hand\" at \"brag\"--the latter being a variant of the game\nof poker, and a spruce hand, apparently, one which, held by a bluffer,\ncontained cards of no real value.\nSome day these etymological mysteries must be probed. Perhaps the German\nprofessors, after the war, can usefully wreak themselves on this complex\nand obscure research. Meanwhile the above notes are offered not as a\nserious contribution to a subject so immense, but rather as a warning.\nThe infectiousness of slang is incredible; and this gigantic\ninter-association of classes and clans has brought about a hitherto\nunheard-of levelling-down of the common speech. Accent may or may not be\ninfluenced: the vocabulary undoubtedly is. Nearly every home in the land\nis soon going to be invaded by many forms of army slang: the process in\nfact has already begun. If we were a sprightlier nation the effect might\nnot be all to the bad. But most of our slang-mongers are not wits. \"He\nwas balmy a treat,\" I heard a soldier say of another soldier who had\nshammed insane. That is what we are coming to: it is the tongue we\nshall use and likewise (I fear) the condition in which some of us will\nfind ourselves as a result.\nXV\nA BLIND MAN'S HOME-COMING\nIn my boyhood I had the ambition--it was one of several ambitions--to\nbecome a courier. The _Morning Post_ advertisements of couriers who\nprofessed to be fluent in a number of languages and were at the disposal\nof invalid aristocrats desiring to take extensive (and expensive) trips\nabroad, aroused the most romantic visions in my mind. A courier's was\nthe life for me. I saw myself whirling all over Europe--with my\ndistinguished invalid--in sleeping-cars de luxe. Anon we were crossing\nthe Atlantic or lolling in punkah-induced breezes on the verandahs of\nFar Eastern hotels. It was a great profession, that of the experienced\nand successful courier.\nI have never been a courier in quite this picturesque acceptation; and\nyet, in a humbler sense, I have perhaps (to my own surprise) earned the\ntitle. As an R.A.M.C. orderly I have more than once officiated as\ntravelling courier--yes, and to distinguished, if far from affluent,\ninvalids. They ought, at least, to rank as distinguished; for the reason\nthey needed a courier was because they had given their health, or limbs,\nor eyesight, in defence of their country.\nIt happens only too often that when a patient is discharged from\nhospital he is not fit to make his journey home alone. An orderly is\ndetailed to accompany him. Sometimes the lot has fallen on me. Generally\nthe trip is a short one, to some outlying suburb of London or to some\ntown or village in the home counties; but sometimes my flights have been\nfurther afield, to Ireland, or Wales; and once I went to Yorkshire with\na blind man.\nThat Yorkshire expedition was singularly lacking in drama and in surface\npathos, yet its details remain with great clearness. The piece of\ndamaged goods which, being of no further fighting use, was being\nreturned with thanks to the hearthside from whence it came, was an\nindividual answering to the unheroic cognomen of Briggs. A\nhigh-explosive shell had been sent by the Gods to alter the current of\nBriggs's career. Briggs came through all that part of the war which\nconcerned him without a scratch upon his person--only after the arrival\nin his immediate vicinity of the high-explosive shell he was\nunfortunately unable to see. Never again would Briggs be of the\nslightest value either as a soldier or in his civilian trade, which was\nthat of driver of ponies in a coal-mine. Consequently, as a\ndistinguished invalid (with the sum of one pound in his pocket to\ncomfort him until such time as his pension should materialise),\nMister--no longer Private--Briggs, for the first and presumably the last\ntime in his existence, went travelling with a courier.\nA car supplied by the National Motor Volunteer Service awaited Briggs\nand his courier at the hospital entrance. Here the introduction between\nBriggs and his courier took place. Ours is a large hospital, and I had\nnever to my knowledge encountered Briggs before that moment. I beheld a\nyoung fellow (he was only twenty-three) with a stout, healthy visage\nwhich wore a pleasant smile and would have been describable as roguish,\nonly ... well, the eyes of a blind man, whatever else they are, are not\nconducive to a roguish mien. They were eyes not visibly damaged: nice\nblue eyes. And they stared at nothingness. I was in the presence of a\nstripling who, a few weeks ago, must have owned a mobile face, and was\nin rapid process of developing a quite different face, a face which\nstill might--it certainly did--grin and laugh, but which would gradually\ngain, had already begun to gain, a set expressionlessness that overlaid\nand strangely neutralised its grins and its laughter.\nBlind men's faces may have beauty, even vivacity, or a heightened\nintelligence and fire; but there is a something, hard to define, of\nwhich they are sadly devoid. The windows of the soul are dimmed. The\nface inevitably changes. And if even I, who knew not Briggs, could\nperceive that Briggs's face must thus have changed, how much more\nconspicuous would the change be to the partner whom Briggs had left\nseven months before and to whom I was now leading him back--his wife.\nBriggs, a civilian once more, sported reach-me-down garments which\nfitted him surprisingly--our Clothing Store sergeant is the kindest of\nsouls and expends infinite patience on doing his best, with\ngovernment-contract tailoring, to suit all our discharges. His overcoat,\nwhich might have been called a Chesterfield in Shoreditch, pleased\nBriggs, as he told me in the car: he drew my attention to its texture\nand warmth, he admiringly fingered it. \"I might ha' paid thirty bob for\nthat there top-coat,\" he surmised. \"A collar an' a tie an' all, too!\nThem boots ain't so dusty, neither: they fit me a treat. Goin' 'ome to\nmy missus in Sunday clobber, I am.\" You would have said that he thought\nhe had emerged from his hazards with rather a good bargain. A jumble of\nready-made clothes--and a pension! The visible world gone for ever!\nThese were his souvenirs of the great war. And, \"Ah,\" he said, when I\nventured on some allusion to his blindness, \"it might ha' bin worse. I\ndon' know what I'd ha' done if I'd lost a leg, same as some of them\nother poor jossers in th' hospital!\"\n(And this, marvellous though it sounds, is the standpoint of no small\nnumber in the legion of our Briggses.)\nThe motor ride was another source of gratification to Briggs. Seated\nbeside me, the wind beating on his sightless orbs, he discoursed of the\nwonders of petrol. \"Proper to take you about, them cars. W'ere are we\nnow? 'Ave we far to run, like?\" I told him we were traversing Battersea\nPark and that our destination was St. Pancras. It transpired that he was\na stranger to London. This drive through London was, as it were, an item\nin his collection of experiences, to be preserved with the cross-channel\nvoyage and the vigils in the trenches. \"Shall we go by Buckingham\nPalace?\" I told him we shouldn't; then, observing that he was\ndisappointed, I asked the driver to make the d\u00e9tour. So at last I was\nable to inform Briggs that we were passing Buckingham Palace: I turned\nhis head so that he looked straight towards that architectural\nphenomenon. It was, of course, invisible to him. No matter. He wished to\nbe able to boast, to his wife, that he had seen (he used that verb) the\nhouse where the King lived.\nHis wife--he married a month before he enlisted--had been notified of\nhis return; but I suggested that at St. Pancras we might telegraph to\nher the actual hour of the train's arrival, in case she should desire to\nmeet it. The idea commended itself to Briggs: he had not thought of such\na thing: telegraphing had perhaps hardly come within his purview, at\nleast so I surmised when, the telegraph-form before me, I asked him what\nhe wished me to write. He began cheerily, as though dictating a letter\nof gossip:--\"_My dear wife_--\" Economy necessitated a taboo of this\notherwise charming method of communication. \"_Arriving Bradford\nfive-thirty, Tom_,\" was the result of final boilings-down, which took so\nlong that we nearly achieved the anticlimax of missing our train\naltogether.\nNow at Bradford (at the end of one of the chattiest five hours I ever\nspent in my life) no Mrs. Briggs was perceptible. I kept my patient on\nthe platform until every other passenger had gone: I marched him up and\ndown the main area of the station. Each time I caught sight of a woman\nwho looked a possible Mrs. Briggs I steered my charge into her vicinity.\nIn spite of a piece of information which Briggs had imparted to me on\nthe journey--namely, that he expected soon to become a father--I was\nsurprised that his wife had not come to the station to welcome him.\nHowever, it was plain that Briggs himself was not particularly\nsurprised, nor, what was more important, disappointed. Nothing could\ndamp his eternal placidity and good humour. He proposed that from this\npoint onward he should pursue his journey alone. \"Nowt to do but git on\nth' tram,\" he said. \"It's a fair step from 'ere, but I knows every inch\nof t' way.\" At all events (as of course I could not allow this) he would\nnow act as my guide. And he did. \"First to the right.... Now we're goin'\nby a big watchmaker's-and-jeweller's.... Now cross t' street.... Now on\nth' corner over there by t' Sinnemer is w'ere we git our tram.\"\nThe tram in due course appeared, and we boarded it. \"Tha mun pay\nthrippence only, mind,\" he warned me when the conductor came round.\n\"It's a rare long ride for thrippence.\" So it proved to be--through\nwildernesses which were half meadow and half slum, my cicerone at every\nhundred yards pointing out the notable features of the landscape. On our\nleft I ought to see the so-and-so public house; on our right the\nfootball ground--I should know it by the grand-stand jutting above the\npalings; further on were brickworks; further still a factory which, my\nnose would have told me, even if Mr. Briggs had not, dealt with\nchemicals; then, on the skyline, a pit-head; then another; then a mining\nvillage with three different kinds of methodist church and two picture\npalaces; then a gap of dreary, dirty fields. And then, nearing dusk, the\nvillage where my friend lived, and where also was the terminus of the\ntram route.\nWe quitted the tram and walked down a street of those squalid brick\ntenements which coal-mining seems to germinate like a rash upon the\nearth's surface. The debris and the scaffoldings of pits were dotted\nabout the adjacent countryside. Sooty cabbage-patches occupied the\noccasional interspaces in the ranks of houses. Briggs directed me across\na cinder path in one of these cabbage-patches. \"See them three 'ouses at\nthe bottom of the 'ill? The end one's mine.\" We approached. No sign of\nthe wife. Surely she would be on the look-out for her husband? Also\nthere was a sister and a brother-in-law--the latter in a prosperous way\nof business as a grocer near-by: Briggs had told me of them. Would not\nthey be watching for him? I began to be anxious. Not once, but several\ntimes, I had heard of the wounded soldier returning to his home and\nfinding no home: both home and wife had gone. (Those are bitterly tragic\ntales, which a realist must write some day.) Still, as we came nearer, I\nsaw nobody at the cottage door. \"Is th' door open?\" asked Briggs. Yes,\nit was open. When we were at the end of the cabbage-patch, and I could\ndiscern the interior of the cottage parlour (into which the door opened\ndirect), it became clear that three persons were there. One of them, a\nman, obviously the brother-in-law, came and peeped out of the window at\nus, and turned and spoke to his companions. Of these two, both women,\none rose from her chair and the other remained seated. But none of the\nthree came to the door.\nI have met northern dourness and the inarticulate manner which is such a\ncontrast to the gushing and noisy effusion of the south. By a paradox it\nis not inconsistent with the familiar conversationalism to which Briggs\nhad treated me, a stranger. But I admit I found Briggs's family circle a\nlittle embarrassing. They were respectable people: the cottage was neat\nand decently furnished, its occupants were sprucely dressed. I fancy\nthey were in their best clothes; certainly their demeanour--and the\naspect of the table in their midst--denoted a great occasion. This\ntable, as I saw when I assisted Briggs up the steps into the room, had\nindeed borne a well-spread tea. No very acute powers of deduction were\nrequired to decide, from the crumbs on the white cloth and on the\ndishes, that there _had_ been bread and butter and jam and cake. Of\nthese not a vestige (except the crumbs) remained. Briggs and I were an\nhour behindhand, and the relatives who awaited the wanderer had eaten\nthe banquet laid to welcome him: or so it appeared. I have no doubt that\nall sorts of delicacies were in the cupboard; the kettle on the hob was\nprobably on the boil; perhaps buttered toast was in the oven. The fact\nremains that devastation was on the table.\nHowever, Briggs did not see the table, and the table's state occupied me\nonly for a fraction of a second. I was more concerned with the three\npeople in the parlour and with their reception of my patient. The pale\nwoman in the chair by the fire was evidently Briggs's wife. She stared\nat us, as we entered, but said absolutely nothing. Nor did the other and\nslightly younger woman, his sister, say anything. She too stared. And\nthe man stared, and said nothing.\n\"Well, here we are,\" I announced--an imbecile assertion, but I produced\nit as cheerfully and matter-of-factly as I knew how. I unhooked my arm\nfrom Briggs's, and made as though to push him forward into the family\ngroup.\n\"Nay!\" said Briggs. \"I mun take my top-coat off first.\"\nI helped him off with his coat. Not one of the three members of his\nfamily had either moved or spoken--beyond one faint murmur, not an\nactual word, in response to my \"Here we are.\" But Briggs seemed to know\nthat his folk were in the room with him, and he neither accosted them,\nexpressed any curiosity about them, or betrayed any astonishment at\ntheir silence.\nWhen he had got his coat off I expected him to move forward into the\nroom. A mistake. Mine must be a hasty temperament. They don't do things\nlike that in Yorkshire, not even when they have come home blinded from\nthe wars. Briggs put out his hand, felt for the cottage door, half\nclosed it, felt for a nail on the inner side of it, and carefully hung\nhis coat thereon.\n_Now_ I could usher him into the waiting family circle.\nNo. I was wrong.\nBriggs calmly divested himself of his jacket. He then felt for another\ndoor, a door which opened on to a stair leading to the upper storey. On\na nail in this door he hung his jacket. And then, in his shirt-sleeves,\nhe was ready. Shirt-sleeves were symbolical. He was home at last, and\nprepared to sit down with his people.\nOf the actual reunion I saw nothing, for I promptly said I must go. It\nwas imperative for me to hurry back, or I should miss my train.\n\"You'll stay an' take a sup of tea with us,\" said Briggs.\nI couldn't, though I should have liked to do so, in some ways, and in\nothers should have hardly dared to be an intruder on such a meeting. I\nshook hands with my patient. Looking back as I went out of the door I\nsaw Briggs's wife still seated, motionless, in her chair. She had not\nopened her lips. It was impossible to divine what were her emotions. She\nwas very pale. There were no tears in her eyes as she stared at her\nyoung blind husband. But I think there were tears waiting to be shed.\nI looked back again when I reached the end of the path across the\ncabbage-patch. The cottage door was still open. In the aperture stood\nthe younger of the two women, Briggs's sister. She waved to me and\nsmiled. It was evident that it had struck her that I ought to have been\nthanked for my services, and she was expressing this, cordially if\nbelatedly. I waved my hand in return, and hastened up the street towards\nthe tram.\nMy hurry was fruitless. I missed my train in Bradford, and stayed the\nnight at an hotel, thus (with appropriate but improper extravagance)\nconcluding this particular performance in the r\u00f4le of travelling courier\nto a distinguished invalid. As I sat over a sumptuous table d'h\u00f4te--this\nwas long before the submarine blockade and the food restrictions--I\nwondered what Briggs's wife said to Briggs; and I made up a story about\nit. But what I have written above is not a story, it is the unadorned\ntruth, which I could not have invented and which is perhaps better than\nthe story. In his courier's presence Briggs addressed not one word to\nhis wife, and his wife addressed not one word to him; nor did his sister\nor his brother-in-law. Nor did any of this trio address one word to me.\nPRINTED IN GREAT BRITAIN BY HAZELL, WATSON AND VINEY, LD., LONDON AND\nAYLESBURY, FOR SIMPKIN, MARSHALL, HAMILTON, KENT & CO., LTD.\n*       *       *       *       *\nPopular 1/-net Novels\n\"_'Arf a Mo', Pinky!_\"\nPrivate Pinkerton, Millionaire\nBy HAROLD ASHTON\nThe rollicking adventures of Pte.

Clarke & Co.,\n1881.\nPrinted and Bound by\nDonohue & Henneberry.\nChicago, Ill.\nTO THE READER.\nIt has been a long time my thought to turn SENECA into English;\nbut whether as a _translation_ or an _abstract_, was the question.\nA _translation_, I perceive, it must not be, at last, for several\nreasons. First, it is a thing already done to my hand, and of above\nsixty years\u2019 standing; though with as little _credit_, perhaps, to\nthe Author, as _satisfaction_ to the Reader. Secondly, There is a\ngreat deal in him, that is wholly foreign to my business: as his\nphilosophical treatises of _Meteors_, _Earthquakes_, the Original\nof _Rivers_, several frivolous disputes betwixt the Epicureans and\nthe Stoics, etc., to say nothing of his frequent repetitions of the\nsame thing again in other words, (wherein he very handsomely excuses\nhimself, by saying, \u201cThat he does but inculcate over and over the same\ncounsels to those that over and over commit the same faults.\u201d)Thirdly,\nHis excellency consists rather in a rhapsody of divine and\nextraordinary _hints_ and _notions_, than in any regulated method of\ndiscourse; so that to take him as he lies, and so to go through with\nhim, were utterly inconsistent with the order and brevity which I\npropound; my principal design, being only to digest, and commonplace\nhis _Morals_, in such sort, that any man, upon occasion, may know where\nto find them. And I have kept myself so close to this proposition,\nthat I have reduced all his scattered Ethics to their _proper heads_,\nwithout any additions of my own, more than of absolute necessity\nfor the tacking of them together. Some other man in my place would\nperhaps make you twenty apologies for his want of skill and address,\nin governing this affair; but these are formal and pedantic fooleries,\nas if any man that first takes himself for a coxcomb in his own heart,\nwould afterwards make himself one in print too. This _Abstract_, such\nas it is, you are extremely welcome to; and I am sorry it is no better,\nboth for your sakes and my own, for if it were written up to the spirit\nof the original, it would be one of the most valuable presents that\never any private man bestowed upon the public; and this, too, even in\nthe judgment of both parties, as well Christian as Heathen, of which in\nits due place.\nNext to my choice of the _Author_ and of the _subject_, together with\nthe manner of handling it, I have likewise had some regard, in this\npublication, to the _timing_ of it, and to the preference of this topic\nof _Benefits_ above all others, for the groundwork of my _first essay_.\nWe are fallen into an age of _vain philosophy_ (as the holy apostle\ncalls it) and so desperately overrun with Drolls and Sceptics, that\nthere is hardly any thing so certain or so sacred, that is not exposed\nto question and contempt, insomuch, that betwixt the hypocrite and the\nAtheist, the very foundations of religion and good manners are shaken,\nand the two tables of the _Decalogue_ dashed to pieces the one against\nthe other; the laws of government are subjected to the fancies of the\nvulgar; public authority to the private passions and opinions of the\npeople; and the supernatural motions of grace confounded with the\ncommon dictates of nature. In this state of corruption, who so fit as a\ngood honest Christian Pagan for a moderator among Pagan Christians?\nTo pass now from the general scope of the whole work to the particular\nargument of the first part of it, I pitched upon the theme of\n_Benefits_, _Gratitude_, and _Ingratitude_, to begin withal, as an\nearnest of the rest, and a lecture expressly calculated for the\nunthankfulness of these times; the foulest undoubtedly, and the most\nexecrable of all others, since the very apostasy of the angels:\nnay, if I durst but suppose a possibility of mercy for those damned\nspirits, and that they might ever be taken into favor again, my\ncharity would hope even better for them than we have found from some\nof our revolters, and that they would so behave themselves as not to\nincur a second forfeiture. And to carry the resemblance yet one point\nfarther, they do both of them agree in an implacable malice against\nthose of their fellows that keep their stations. But, alas! what\ncould _Ingratitude_ do without _Hypocrisy_, the inseparable companion\nof it, and, in effect, the bolder and blacker devil of the two? for\nLucifer himself never had the face to lift up his eyes to heaven, and\ntalk to the ALMIGHTY at the familiar rate of our pretended patriots\nand zealots, and at the same time to make him party to a cheat. It is\nnot for nothing that the Holy Ghost has denounced so many woes, and\nredoubled so many cautions against _hypocrites_; plainly intimating\nat once how dangerous a snare they are to mankind, and no less odious\nto God himself; which is sufficiently denoted in the force of that\ndreadful expression, _And your portion shall be with hypocrites_. You\nwill find in the holy scriptures (as I have formerly observed) that\nGod has given the grace of repentance to _persecutors_, _idolaters_,\n_murderers_, _adulterers_, etc., but I am mistaken if the whole Bible\naffords you any one instance of a _converted hypocrite_.\nTo descend now from truth itself to our own experience have we not\nseen, even in our days, a most pious (and almost faultless) Prince\nbrought to the scaffold by his own subjects? The most glorious\nconstitution upon the face of the earth, both ecclesiastical and\ncivil, torn to pieces and dissolved? The happiest people under the sun\nenslaved? Our temples sacrilegiously profaned, and a license given\nto all sorts of heresy and outrage? And by whom but by a race of\n_hypocrites?_ who had nothing in their mouths all this while but _the\npurity of the gospel_, _the honor of the king_, and _the liberty of\nthe people_, assisted underhand with _defamatory papers_, which were\nlevelled at the _king_ himself through the sides of his most faithful\n_ministers_. This PROJECT succeeded so well against one government,\nthat it is now again set afoot against another; and by some of the\nvery actors too in that TRAGEDY, and after a most gracious pardon\nalso, when Providence had laid their necks and their fortunes at his\nmajesty\u2019s feet. It is a wonderful thing that _libels_ and _libellers_,\nthe most _infamous_ of _practices_ and of _men_; the most _unmanly\nsneaking methods_ and _instruments_ of _mischief_; the very bane\nof _human society_, and the _plague_ of all _governments_; it is a\nwonderful thing (I say) that these engines and engineers should ever\nfind credit enough in the world to engage a party; but it would be\nstill more wonderful if the _same trick_ should pass twice upon the\n_same people_, in the _same age_, and from the _same_ IMPOSTORS. This\ncontemplation has carried me a little out of my way, but it has at\nlength brought me to my text again, for there is in the bottom of it\nthe highest opposition imaginable of _ingratitude_ and _obligation_.\nThe reader will, in some measure, be able to judge by this taste what\nhe is farther to expect; that is to say, as to the cast of my design,\nand the simplicity of the style and dress; for that will still be the\nsame, only accompanied with variety of matter. Whether it pleases the\nworld or no, the care is taken; and yet I could wish that it might be\nas delightful to others upon the perusal, as it has been to me in the\nspeculation. Next to the gospel itself, I do look upon it as the most\nsovereign remedy against the miseries of human nature: and I have ever\nfound it so, in all the injuries and distresses of an unfortunate life.\nYou may read more of him, if you please, in the _Appendix_, which I\nhave here subjoined to this Preface, concerning the authority of his\n_writings_, and the circumstances of his _life_; as I have extracted\nthem out of Lipsius.\nOF SENECA\u2019S WRITINGS.\nIt appears that our author had among the ancients three professed\nenemies. In the first place Caligula, who called his writings, _sand\nwithout lime_; alluding to the starts of his fancy, and the incoherence\nof his sentences. But Seneca was never the worse for the censure of a\nperson that propounded even the suppressing of Homer himself; and of\ncasting Virgil and Livy out of all _public libraries_. The next was\nFabius, who taxes him for being too bold with the eloquence of former\ntimes, and failing in that point himself; and likewise for being too\nquaint and finical in his expressions; which Tacitus imputes, in\npart to the freedom of his own particular inclination, and partly to\nthe humor of the times. He is also charged by Fabius as no profound\nphilosopher; but with all this, he allows him to be a man very studious\nand learned, of great wit and invention, and well read in all sorts of\nliterature; a severe reprover of vice; most divinely sententious; and\nwell worth the reading, if it were only for his morals; adding, that if\nhis judgment had been answerable to his wit, it had been much the more\nfor his reputation; but he wrote whatever came next; so that I would\nadvise the reader (says he) to distinguish where he _himself_ did not,\nfor there are many things in him, not only to be approved, but admired;\nand it was great pity that he that could do what he would, should not\nalways make the best choice. His third adversary is Agellius, who\nfalls upon him for his style, and a kind of tinkling in his sentences,\nbut yet commends him for his piety and good counsels. On the other\nside, Columela calls him _a man of excellent wit and learning_; Pliny,\n_the prince of erudition;_ Tacitus gives him the character of _a wise\nman, and a fit tutor for a prince_; Dio reports him to have been _the\ngreatest man of his age_.\nOf those pieces of his that are extant, we shall not need to give\nany particular account: and of those that are lost, we cannot, any\nfarther than by lights to them from other authors, as we find them\ncited much to his honor; and we may reasonably compute them to be\nthe greater part of his works. That he wrote several _poems_ in his\nbanishment, may be gathered partly from himself, but more expressly\nout of Tacitus, who says, \u201cthat he was reproached with his applying\nhimself to poetry, after he saw that Nero took pleasure in it, out\nof a design to curry favor.\u201d St. Jerome refers to a discourse of his\nconcerning matrimony. Lactantius takes notice of his history, and his\nbooks of Moralities: St. Augustine quotes some passages of his out of\na book of Superstition; some references we meet with to his books of\nExhortations: Fabius makes mention of his Dialogues: and he himself\nspeaks of a treatise of his own concerning Earthquakes, which he wrote\nin his youth, but the opinion of an epistolary correspondence that he\nhad with St. Paul, does not seem to have much color for it.\nSome few fragments, however, of those books of his that are wanting,\nare yet preserved in the writings of other eminent authors, sufficient\nto show the world how great a treasure they have lost by the excellency\nof that little that is left.\nSeneca, says Lactantius, that was the sharpest of all the Stoics,\nhow great a veneration has he for the Almighty! as for instance,\ndiscoursing of a violent death; \u201cDo you not understand?\u201d says he, \u201cthe\nmajesty and the authority of your Judge; he is the supreme Governor of\nheaven and earth, and the God of all your gods; and it is upon him that\nall those powers depend which we worship for deities.\u201d Moreover, in his\nExhortations, \u201cThis God,\u201d says he, \u201cwhen he laid the foundations of the\nuniverse, and entered upon the greatest and the best work in nature, in\nthe ordering of the government of the world, though he was himself All\nin all, yet he substituted other subordinate ministers, as the servants\nof his commands.\u201d And how many other things does this Heathen speak of\nGod like one of us!\nWhich the acute Seneca, says Lactantius again, saw in his Exhortations.\n\u201cWe,\u201d says he, \u201chave our dependence elsewhere, and should look up to\nthat power, to which we are indebted for all that we can pretend to\nthat is good.\u201d\nAnd again, Seneca says very well in his Morals, \u201cThey worship the\nimages of the God,\u201d says he, \u201ckneel to them, and adore them, they are\nhardly ever from them, either plying them with offerings or sacrifices,\nand yet, after all this reverence to the image, they have no regard at\nall to the workman that made it.\u201d\nLactantius again. \u201cAn invective,\u201d says Seneca in his Exhortations, \u201cis\nthe masterpiece of most of our philosophers; and if they fall upon\nthe subject of _avarice_, _lust_, _ambition_, they lash out into such\nexcess of bitterness, as if railing were a mark of their profession.\nThey make me think of gallipots in an apothecary\u2019s shop, that have\nremedies without and poison within.\u201d\nLactantius still. \u201cHe that would know all things, let him read Seneca;\nthe most lively describer of public vices and manners, and the smartest\nreprehender of them.\u201d\nAnd again; as Seneca has it in the books of Moral Philosophy, \u201cHe is\nthe brave man, whose splendor and authority is the least part of his\ngreatness, that can look death in the face without trouble or surprise;\nwho, if his body were to be broken upon the wheel, or melted lead to be\npoured down his throat, would be less concerned for the pain itself,\nthan for the dignity of bearing it.\u201d\nLet no man, says Lactantius, think himself the safer in his wickedness\nfor want of a witness; for God is omniscient, and to him nothing can\nbe a secret. It is an admirable sentence that Seneca concludes his\nExhortations withal: \u201cGod,\u201d says he, \u201cis a great, (I know not what),\nan incomprehensible Power; it is to him that we live, and to him that\nwe must approve ourselves. What does it avail us that our consciences\nare hidden from men, when our souls lie open to God?\u201d What could a\nChristian have spoken more to the purpose in this case than this divine\nPagan? And in the beginning of the same work, says Seneca, \u201cWhat is\nit that we do? to what end is it to stand contriving, and to hide\nourselves? We are under a guard, and there is no escaping from our\nkeeper. One man may be parted from another by travel, death, sickness;\nbut there is no dividing us from ourselves. It is to no purpose to\ncreep into a corner where nobody shall see us. Ridiculous madness!\nMake it the case, that no mortal eye could find us out, he that has a\nconscience gives evidence against himself.\u201d\nIt is truly and excellently spoken of Seneca, says Lactantius, once\nagain; \u201cConsider,\u201d says he \u201cthe majesty, the goodness, and the\nvenerable mercies of the Almighty; a friend that is always at hand.\nWhat delight can it be to him the slaughter of innocent creatures or\nthe worship of bloody sacrifices? Let us purge our minds, and lead\nvirtuous and honest lives. His pleasure lies not in the magnificence of\ntemples made with stone, but in the pity and devotion of consecrated\nhearts.\u201d\nIn the book that Seneca wrote against Superstitions, treating of\nimages, says St. Austin, he writes thus: \u201cThey represent the holy, the\nimmortal, and the inviolable gods in the basest matter, and without\nlife or motion; in the forms of men, beasts, fishes, some of mixed\nbodies, and those figures they call deities, which, if they were but\nanimated, would affright a man, and pass for monsters.\u201d And then, a\nlittle farther, treating of Natural Theology, after citing the opinions\nof philosophers, he supposes an objection against himself: \u201cSomebody\nwill perhaps ask me, would you have me then to believe the heavens and\nthe earth to be gods, and some of them above the moon, and some below\nit? Shall I ever be brought to the opinion of Plato, or of Strabo the\nPeripatetic? the one of which would have God to be without a body,\nand the other without a mind.\u201d To which he replies, \u201cAnd do you give\nmore credit then to the dreams of T. Tatius, Romulus, Hostilius, who\ncaused, among other deities, even Fear and Paleness to be worshipped?\nthe vilest of human affections; the one being the motion of an\naffrighted mind, and the other not so much the disease as the color\nof a disordered body. Are these the deities that you will rather put\nyour faith in, and place in the heavens?\u201d And speaking afterward of\ntheir abominable customs, with what liberty does he write! \u201cOne,\u201d says\nhe, \u201cout of zeal, makes himself an eunuch, another lances his arms; if\nthis be the way to _please_ their gods, what should a man do if he had\na mind to _anger_ them? or, if this be the way to please them, they do\ncertainly deserve not to be worshipped at all. What a frenzy is this to\nimagine that the gods can be delighted with such cruelties, as even the\nworst of men would make a conscience to inflict! The most barbarous and\nnotorious of tyrants, some of them have perhaps done it themselves, or\nordered the tearing of men to pieces by others; but they never went so\nfar as to command any man to torment himself. We have heard of those\nthat have suffered castration to gratify the lust of their imperious\nmasters, but never any man that was forced to act it upon himself. They\nmurder themselves in their very temples, and their prayers are offered\nup in blood. Whosoever shall but observe what they do, and what they\nsuffer, will find it so misbecoming an honest man, so unworthy of a\nfreeman, and so inconsistent with the action of a man in his wits, that\nhe must conclude them all to be mad, if it were not that there are so\nmany of them; for only their number is their justification and their\nprotection.\u201d\nWhen he comes to reflect, says St. Augustine, upon those passages which\nhe himself had seen in the Capitol, he censures them with liberty and\nresolution; and no man will believe that such things would be done\nunless in mockery or frenzy. What lamentation is there in the Egyptian\nsacrifices for the loss of Osiris? and then what joy for the finding\nof him again? Which he makes himself sport with; for in truth it is\nall a fiction; and yet those people that neither lost any thing nor\nfound any thing, must express their sorrows and their rejoicings to\nthe highest degree. \u201cBut there is only a certain time,\u201d says he, \u201cfor\nthis freak, and once in a year people may be allowed to be mad. I came\ninto the Capitol,\u201d says Seneca, \u201cwhere the several deities had their\nseveral servants and attendants, their lictors, their dressers, and\nall in posture and action, as if they were executing their offices;\nsome to hold the glass, others to comb out Juno\u2019s and Minerva\u2019s hair;\none to tell Jupiter what o\u2019clock it is; some lasses there are that sit\ngazing upon the image, and fancy Jupiter has a kindness for them. All\nthese things,\u201d says Seneca, a while after, \u201ca wise man will observe for\nthe law\u2019s sake more than for the gods; and all this rabble of deities,\nwhich the superstition of many ages has gathered together, we are in\nsuch manner to adore, as to consider the worship to be rather matter\nof custom than of conscience.\u201d Whereupon St. Augustine observes, that\nthis illustrious senator worshipped what he reproved, acted what he\ndisliked, and adored what he condemned.\nSENECA\u2019S LIFE AND DEATH.\nIt has been an ancient custom to record the actions and the writings\nof eminent men, with all their circumstances, and it is but a right\nthat we owe to the memory of our famous author. Seneca was by birth a\nSpaniard of Cordova, (a Roman colony of great fame and antiquity.) He\nwas of the family of Ann\u00e6us, of the order of knights; and the father,\nLucius Ann\u00e6us Seneca, was distinguished from the son, by the name\nof _the Orator_. His mother\u2019s name was Helvia, a woman of excellent\nqualities. His father came to Rome in the time of Augustus, and his\nwife and children soon followed him, our Seneca yet being in his\ninfancy. There were three brothers of them, and never a sister. Marcus\nAnn\u00e6us Novatus, Lucius Ann\u00e6us Seneca, and Lucius Ann\u00e6us Mela; the first\nof these changed his name for Junius Gallio, who adopted him; to him it\nwas that he dedicated his treatise of ANGER, whom he calls Novatus too;\nand he also dedicated his discourse of a _Happy Life_ to his brother\nGallio. The youngest brother (Ann\u00e6us Mela) was Lucan\u2019s father. Seneca\nwas about twenty years of age in the _fifth year_ of Tiberius, when the\nJews were expelled from Rome. His father trained him up to _rhetoric,_\nbut his genius led him rather to _philosophy;_ and he applied his wit\nto _morality_ and _virtue_. He was a great hearer of the celebrated\nmen of those times; as Attalus, Sotion, Papirius, Fabianus, (of whom\nhe makes often mention,) and he was much an admirer also of Demetrius\nthe Cynic, whose conversation he had afterwards in the Court, and both\nat home also and abroad, for they often travelled together. His father\nwas not at all pleased with his humor of _philosophy_, but forced him\nupon the _law_, and for a while he practiced _pleading_. After which\nhe would needs put him upon _public employment:_ and he came first to\nbe _qu\u00e6stor_, then _pr\u00e6tor,_ and some will have it that he was chosen\n_consul_; but this is doubtful.\nSeneca finding that he had ill offices done him at court, and that\nNero\u2019s favor began to cool, he went directly and resolutely to Nero,\nwith an offer to refund all that he had gotten, which Nero would not\nreceive; but however, from that time he changed his course of life,\nreceived few visits, shunned company, went little abroad; still\npretending to be kept at home, either by indisposition or by his\nstudy. Being Nero\u2019s tutor and governor, all things were well so long\nas Nero followed his counsel. His two chief favorites were Burrhus and\nSeneca, who were both of them excellent in their ways: Burrhus, in\nhis care of _military_ affairs, and severity of _discipline_; Seneca\nfor his _precepts_ and _good advice_ in the matter of _eloquence,_\nand the _gentleness_ of an _honest mind_; assisting one another, in\nthat slippery age of the prince (says Tacitus) to invite him, by the\nallowance of lawful pleasures, to the love of virtue. Seneca had two\nwives; the name of the first is not mentioned; his second was Paulina,\nwhom he often speaks of with great passion. By the former he had his\nson Marcus.\nIn the first year of Claudius he was banished into Corsica, when Julia,\nthe daughter of Germanicus, was accused by Messalina of adultery and\nbanished too, Seneca being charged as one of the adulterers. After a\nmatter of eight years or upwards in exile, he was called back, and as\nmuch in favor again as ever. His estate was partly patrimonial, but the\ngreatest part of it was the bounty of his prince. His gardens, villas,\nlands, possessions, and incredible sums of money, are agreed upon at\nall hands; which drew an envy upon him. Dio reports him to have had\n250,000_l._ sterling at interest in Britanny alone, which he called in\nall at a sum. The Court itself could not bring him to flattery; and\nfor his piety, submission, and virtue, the practice of his whole life\nwitnesses for him. \u201cSo soon,\u201d says he, \u201cas the candle is taken away,\nmy wife, that knows my custom, lies still, without a word speaking,\nand then do I recollect all that I have said or done that day, and\ntake myself to shrift. And why should I conceal or reserve anything,\nor make any scruple of inquiring into my errors, when I can say to\nmyself, Do so no more, and for this once I will forgive thee?\u201d And\nagain, what can be more pious and self-denying than this passage, in\none of his epistles? \u201cBelieve me now, when I tell you the very bottom\nof my soul: in all the difficulties and crosses of my life, this is my\nconsideration\u2014since it is God\u2019s will, I do not only obey, but assent to\nit; nor do I comply out of necessity, but inclination.\u201d\n\u201cHere follows now,\u201d says Tacitus, \u201cthe death of Seneca, to Nero\u2019s great\nsatisfaction; not so much for any pregnant proof against him that he\nwas of Piso\u2019s conspiracy; but Nero was resolved to do that by the sword\nwhich he could not effect by poison. For it is reported, that Nero\nhad corrupted Cleonicus (a freeman of Seneca\u2019s) to give his master\npoison, which did not succeed. Whether that the servant had discovered\nit to his master, or that Seneca, by his own caution and jealousy, had\navoided it; for he lived only upon a simple diet, as the fruits of the\nearth, and his drink was most commonly river water.\n\u201cNatalis, it seems, was sent upon a visit to him (being indisposed)\nwith a complaint that he would not let Piso come at him; and advising\nhim to the continuance of their friendship and acquaintance as\nformerly. To whom Seneca made answer, that frequent meetings and\nconferences betwixt them could do neither of them any good; but that\nhe had a great interest in Piso\u2019s welfare. Hereupon Granius Silvanus\n(a captain of the guard) was sent to examine Seneca upon the discourse\nthat passed betwixt him and Natalis, and to return his answer. Seneca,\neither by chance or upon purpose, came that day from Campania, to\na villa of his own, within four miles of the city; and thither the\nofficer went the next evening, and beset the place. He found Seneca\nat supper with his wife Paulina, and two of his friends; and gave him\nimmediately an account of his commission. Seneca told him, that it was\ntrue that Natalis had been with him in Piso\u2019s name, with a complaint\n_that Piso could not be admitted to see him_; and that he excused\nhimself by reason of his want of health, and his desires to be quiet\nand private; and that he had no reason to prefer another man\u2019s welfare\nbefore his own. C\u00e6sar himself, he said, knew very well that he was not\na man of compliment, having received more proofs of his freedom than\nof his flattery. This answer of Seneca\u2019s was delivered to C\u00e6sar in the\npresence of Popp\u00e6a, and Tigellinus, the intimate confidants of this\nbarbarous prince: and Nero asked him whether he could gather anything\nfrom Seneca as if he intended to make himself away? The tribune\u2019s\nanswer was, that he did not find him one jot moved with the message:\nbut that he went on roundly with his tale, and never so much as changed\ncountenance for the matter. Go back to him then, says Nero, and tell\nhim, _that he is condemned to die_. Fabius Rusticus delivers it, that\nthe tribune did not return the same way he came, but went aside to\nFenius (a captain of that name) and told him C\u00e6sar\u2019s orders, asking his\nadvice whether he should obey them or not; who bade him by all means\nto do as he was ordered. Which want of resolution was fatal to them\nall; for Silvanus also, that was one of the conspirators, assisted now\nto serve and to increase those crimes, which he had before complotted\nto revenge. And yet he did not think fit to appear himself in the\nbusiness, but sent a centurion to Seneca to tell him his doom.\n\u201cSeneca, without any surprise or disorder, calls for his will; which\nbeing refused him by the officer, he turned to his friends, and told\nthem that since he was not permitted to requite them as they deserved,\nhe was yet at liberty to bequeath them the thing of all others that\nhe esteemed the most, that is, the image of his life; which should\ngive them the reputation both of _constancy_ and _friendship_, if they\nwould but imitate it; exhorting them to a firmness of mind, sometimes\nby good counsel, otherwhile by reprehension, as the occasion required.\nWhere, says he, is all your philosophy now? all your _premeditated\nresolutions_ against the violences of Fortune? Is there any man so\nignorant of Nero\u2019s cruelty, as to expect, after the murder of his\nmother and his brother, that he should ever spare the life of his\ngovernor and tutor? After some general expressions to this purpose, he\ntook his wife in his arms, and having somewhat fortified her against\nthe present calamity, he besought and conjured her to moderate her\nsorrows, and betake herself to the contemplations and comforts of a\nvirtuous life; which would be a fair and ample consolation to her for\nthe loss of her husband. Paulina, on the other side, tells him her\ndetermination to bear him company, and wills the executioner to do\nhis office. Well, says Seneca, if after the sweetness of life, as I\nhave represented it to thee, thou hadst rather entertain an honorable\ndeath, I shall not envy thy example; consulting, at the same time, the\nfame of the person he loved, and his own tenderness, for fear of the\ninjuries that might attend her when he was gone. Our resolution, says\nhe, in this generous act, may be equal, but thine will be the greater\nreputation. After this the veins of both their arms were opened at the\nsame time. Seneca did not bleed so freely, his spirits being wasted\nwith age and a thin diet; so that he was forced to cut the veins of his\nthighs and elsewhere, to hasten his dispatch. When he was far spent,\nand almost sinking under his torments, he desired his wife to remove\ninto another chamber, lest the agonies of the one might work upon the\ncourage of the other. His eloquence continued to the last, as appears\nby the excellent things he delivered at his death; which being taken\nin writing from his own mouth, and published in his own words, I shall\nnot presume to deliver them in any other. Nero, in the meantime, who\nhad no particular spite to Paulina, gave orders to prevent her death,\nfor fear his cruelty should grow more and more insupportable and\nodious. Whereupon the soldiers gave all freedom and encouragement to\nher servants to bind up her wounds, and stop the blood, which they did\naccordingly; but whether she was sensible of it or not is a question.\nFor among the common people, who are apt to judge the worst, there\nwere some of opinion, that as long as she despaired of Nero\u2019s mercy,\nshe seemed to court the glory of dying with her husband for company;\nbut that upon the likelihood of better quarter she was prevailed upon\nto outlive him; and so for some years she did survive him, with all\npiety and respect to his memory; but so miserably pale and wan, that\neverybody might read the loss of her blood and spirits in her very\ncountenance.\n\u201cSeneca finding his death slow and lingering, desires Statius Ann\u00e6us\n(his old friend and physician) to give him a dose of poison, which he\nhad provided beforehand, being the same preparation which was appointed\nfor capital offenders in Athens. This was brought him, and he drank\nit up, but to little purpose; for his body was already chilled, and\nbound up against the force of it. He went at last into a hot bath, and\nsprinkling some of his servants that were next him, this, says he,\nis an oblation to Jupiter _the deliverer_. The fume of the bath soon\ndispatched him, and his body was burnt, without any funeral solemnity,\nas he had directed in his testament: though this will of his was made\nin the height of his prosperity and power. There was a rumor that\nSubrius Flavius, in a private consultation with the centurions, had\ntaken up this following resolution, (and that Seneca himself was no\nstranger to it) that is to say, that after Nero should have been slain\nby the help of Piso, Piso himself should have been killed too; and the\nempire delivered up to Seneca, as one that well deserved it, for his\nintegrity and virtue.\u201d\nSENECA OF BENEFITS.\nCHAPTER I.\nOF BENEFITS IN GENERAL.\nIt is, perhaps, one of the most pernicious errors of a rash and\ninconsiderate life, the common ignorance of the world in the matter of\nexchanging _benefits_. And this arises from a mistake, partly in the\nperson that we would oblige, and partly in the thing itself. To begin\nwith the latter: \u201cA benefit is a good office, done with intention and\njudgment;\u201d that is to say, with a due regard to all the circumstances\nof _what_, _how_, _why_, _when_, _where_, _to whom_, _how much_, and\nthe like; or otherwise: \u201cIt is a voluntary and benevolent action that\ndelights the giver in the comfort it brings to the receiver.\u201d It will\nbe hard to draw this subject, either into method or compass: the one,\nbecause of the infinite variety and complication of cases; the other,\nby reason of the large extent of it: for the whole business (almost)\nof mankind in society falls under this head; the duties of kings\nand subjects, husbands and wives, parents and children, masters and\nservants, natives and strangers, high and low, rich and poor, strong\nand weak, friends and enemies. The very meditation of it breeds good\nblood and generous thoughts; and instructs us in honor, humanity,\nfriendship, piety, gratitude, prudence, and justice. In short, the art\nand skill of conferring benefits is, of all human duties, the most\nabsolutely necessary to the well-being, both of reasonable nature, and\nof every individual; as the very cement of all communities, and the\nblessing of particulars. He that does good to another man does good\nalso to himself; not only in the consequence, but in the very act of\ndoing it; for the conscience of well-doing is an ample reward.\nOf benefits in general, there are several sorts; as _necessary_,\n_profitable_, and _delightful_. Some things there are, without which\nwe _cannot_ live; others without which we _ought not_ to live; and\nsome, again, without which we _will not_ live. In the first rank are\nthose which deliver us from capital dangers, or apprehensions of\ndeath: and the favor is rated according to the hazard; for the greater\nthe extremity, the greater seems the obligation. The next is a case\nwherein we may indeed live, but we had better die; as in the question\nof liberty, modesty, and a good conscience. In the third place, follow\nthose things which custom, use, affinity, and acquaintance, have made\ndear to us; as husbands, wives, children, friends, etc., which an\nhonest man will preserve at his utmost peril. Of things profitable\nthere is a large field, as money, honor, etc., to which might be\nadded, matters of superfluity and pleasure. But we shall open a way\nto the circumstances of a benefit by some previous and more general\ndeliberations upon the thing itself.\nCHAPTER II.\nSEVERAL SORTS OF BENEFITS.\nWe shall divide _benefits_ into _absolute_ and _vulgar_; the one\nappertaining to good life, the other is only matter of commerce. The\nformer are the more excellent, because they can never be made void;\nwhereas all material benefits are tossed back and forward, and change\ntheir master. There are some offices that look like benefits, but are\nonly desirable conveniences, as wealth, etc., and these a wicked man\nmay receive from a good, or a good man from an evil. Others, again,\nthat bear the face of injuries, which are only benefits ill taken; as\ncutting, lancing, burning, under the hand of a surgeon. The greatest\nbenefits of all are those of good education, which we receive from our\nparents, either in the state of ignorance or perverseness; as, their\ncare and tenderness in our infancy; their discipline in our childhood,\nto keep us to our duties by fear; and, if fair means will not do,\ntheir proceeding afterwards to severity and punishment, without which\nwe should never have come to good. There are matters of great value,\nmany times, that are but of small price; as instructions from a tutor,\nmedicine from a physician, etc. And there are small matters again,\nwhich are of great consideration to us: the gift is small, and the\nconsequence great; as a cup of cold water in a time of need may save a\nman\u2019s life. Some things are of great moment to the giver, others to the\nreceiver: one man gives me a house; another snatches me out when it is\nfalling upon my head; one gives me an estate; another takes me out of\nthe fire, or casts me out a rope when I am sinking. Some good offices\nwe do to friends, others to strangers; but those are the noblest that\nwe do without pre-desert. There is an obligation of bounty, and an\nobligation of charity; this in case of necessity, and that in point of\nconvenience. Some benefits are common, others are personal; as if a\nprince (out of pure grace) grant a privilege to a city, the obligation\nlies upon the community, and only upon every individual as a part of\nthe whole; but if it be done particularly for my sake, then am I singly\nthe debtor for it. The cherishing of strangers is one of the duties\nof hospitality, and exercises itself in the relief and protection of\nthe distressed. There are benefits of good counsel, reputation, life,\nfortune, liberty, health, nay, and of superfluity and pleasure. One man\nobliges me out of his pocket; another gives me matter of ornament and\ncuriosity; a third, consolation. To say nothing of negative benefits;\nfor there are that reckon it an obligation if they do a body no hurt;\nand place it to account, as if they saved a man, when they do not undo\nhim. To shut up all in one word; as benevolence is the most sociable of\nall virtues, so it is of the largest extent; for there is not any man,\neither so great or so little, but he is yet capable of giving and of\nreceiving benefits.\nCHAPTER III.\nA SON MAY OBLIGE HIS FATHER, AND A SERVANT HIS MASTER.\nThe question is (in the first place) whether it may not be possible\nfor a father to owe more to a son, in other respects, than the son\nowes to his father for his being? That many sons are both greater and\nbetter than their fathers, there is no question; as there are many\nother things that derive their beings from others, which yet are far\ngreater than their original. Is not the tree larger than the seed? the\nriver than the fountain? The foundation of all things lies hid, and\nthe superstructure obscures it. If I owe all to my father, because he\ngives me life, I may owe as much to a physician that saved his life;\nfor if my father had not been cured, I had never been begotten: or, if\nI stand indebted for all that I am to my beginning, my acknowledgment\nmust run back to the very original of all human beings. My father gave\nme the benefit of life: which he had never done, if his father had not\nfirst given it to him. He gave me life, not knowing to whom; and when\nI was in a condition neither to feel death nor to fear it. That is the\ngreat benefit, to give life to one that knows how to use it, and that\nis capable of the apprehension of death. It is true, that without a\nfather I could never have had a being; and so, without a nurse, that\nbeing had never been improved: but I do not therefore owe my virtue\neither to my nativity or to her that gave me suck. The generation of me\nwas the last part of the benefit: for to live is common with brutes;\nbut to live well is the main business; and that virtue is all my own,\nsaving what I drew from my education. It does not follow that the\n_first_ benefit must be the _greatest_, because without the first the\ngreatest could never have been. The father gives life to the son but\nonce; but if the son save the father\u2019s life often, though he do but his\nduty, it is yet a greater benefit. And again, the benefit that a man\nreceives is the greater, the more he needs it; but the living has more\nneed of life than he that is not yet born; so that the father receives\na greater benefit in the continuance of his life than the son in the\nbeginning of it. What if a son deliver his father from the rack; or,\nwhich is more, lay himself down in his place? The giving of him a being\nwas but the office of a father; a simple act, a benefit given at a\nventure: beside that, he had a participant in it, and a regard to his\nfamily. He gave only a single life, and he received a happy one. My\nmother brought me into the world naked, exposed, and void of reason;\nbut my reputation and my fortune are advanced by my virtue. Scipio (as\nyet in his minority) rescued his father in a battle with Hannibal, and\nafterward from the practices and persecution of a powerful faction;\ncovering him with consulary honors, and the spoils of public enemies.\nHe made himself as eminent for his moderation as for his piety and\nmilitary knowledge: he was the defender and the establisher of his\ncountry: he left the empire without a competitor, and made himself as\nwell the ornament of Rome as the security of it: and did not Scipio,\nin all this, more than requite his father barely for begetting of him?\nWhether did Anchises more for \u00c6neas, in dandling the child in his arms;\nor \u00c6neas for his father, when he carried him upon his back through\nthe flames of Troy, and made his name famous to future ages among the\nfounders of the Roman Empire? T. Manlius was the son of a sour and\nimperious father, who banished him his house as a blockhead, and a\nscandal to the family. This Manlius, hearing that his father\u2019s life was\nin question, and a day set for his trial, went to the tribune that was\nconcerned in his cause, and discoursed with him about it: the tribune\ntold him the appointed time, and withal (as an obligation upon the\nyoung man) that his cruelty to his son would be part of his accusation.\nManlius, upon this, takes the tribune aside, and presenting a poniard\nto his breast, \u201cSwear,\u201d says he, \u201cthat you will let this cause fall,\nor you shall have this dagger in the heart of you; and now it is at\nyour choice which way you will deliver my father.\u201d The tribune swore\nand kept his word, and made a fair report of the whole matter to the\ncouncil. He that makes himself famous by his eloquence, justice, or\narms, illustrates his extraction, let it be never so mean; and gives\ninestimable reputation to his parents. We should never have heard of\nSophroniscus, but for his son Socrates; nor for Aristo and Gryllus, if\nit had not been for Xenophon and Plato.\nThis is not to discountenance the veneration we owe to parents; nor\nto make children the worse, but the better; and to stir up generous\nemulations: for, in contests of good offices, both parties are happy;\nas well the vanquished as those that overcome. It is the only honorable\ndispute that can arise betwixt a father and son, which of the two\nshall have the better of the other in the point of benefits.\nIn the question betwixt a master and a servant, we must distinguish\nbetwixt benefits, duties, and actions ministerial. By _benefits_, we\nunderstand those good offices that we receive from strangers, which\nare voluntary, and may be forborne without blame. _Duties_ are the\nparts of a son and wife, and incumbent upon kindred and relations.\n_Offices ministerial_ belong to the part of a servant. Now, since it\nis the _mind_, and not the _condition_ of a person, that prints the\nvalue upon the benefit, a servant may oblige his master, and so may a\nsubject his sovereign, or a common soldier his general, by doing more\nthan he is expressly bound to do. Some things there are, which the law\nneither commands nor forbids; and here the servant is free. It would\nbe very hard for a servant to be chastised for doing less than his\nduty, and not thanked for it when he does more. His body, it is true,\nis his master\u2019s, but his mind is his own: and there are many commands\nwhich a servant ought no more to obey than a master to impose. There is\nno man so great, but he may both need the help and service, and stand\nin fear of the power and unkindness, even of the meanest of mortals.\nOne servant kills his master; another saves him, nay, preserves his\nmaster\u2019s life, perhaps, with the loss of his own: he exposes himself to\ntorment and death; he stands firm against all threats and batteries:\nwhich is not only a benefit in a servant, but much the greater for his\nbeing so.\nWhen Domitius was besieged in Corfinium, and the place brought to great\nextremity, he pressed his servant so earnestly to poison him, that at\nlast he was prevailed upon to give him a potion; which, it seems, was\nan innocent opiate, and Domitius outlived it: C\u00e6sar took the town, and\ngave Domitius his life, but it was his servant that gave it him first.\nThere was another town besieged, and when it was upon the last pinch,\ntwo servants made their escape, and went over to the enemy: upon the\nRomans entering the town, and in the heat of the soldiers\u2019 fury, these\ntwo fellows ran directly home, took their mistress out of her house,\nand drove her before them, telling every body how barbarously she had\nused them formerly, and that they would now have their revenge; when\nthey had her without the gates, they kept her close till the danger was\nover; by which means they gave their mistress her life, and she gave\nthem their freedom. This was not the action of a servile mind, to do so\nglorious a thing, under an appearance of so great a villainy; for if\nthey had not passed for deserters and parricides, they could not have\ngained their end.\nWith one instance more (and that a very brave one) I shall conclude\nthis chapter.\nIn the civil wars of Rome, a party coming to search for a person of\nquality that was proscribed, a servant put on his master\u2019s clothes,\nand delivered himself up to the soldiers as the master of the house;\nhe was taken into custody, and put to death, without discovering the\nmistake. What could be more glorious, than for a servant to die for his\nmaster, in that age, when there were not many servants that would not\nbetray their masters? So generous a tenderness in a public cruelty;\nso invincible a faith in a general corruption; what could be more\nglorious, I say, than so exalted a virtue, as rather to choose death\nfor the reward of his fidelity, than the greatest advantages he might\notherwise have had for the violation of it?\nCHAPTER IV.\nIT IS THE INTENTION, NOT THE MATTER, THAT MAKES THE BENEFIT.\nThe _good-will_ of the benefactor is the fountain of all benefits;\nnay it is the benefit itself, or, at least, the stamp that makes it\nvaluable and current. Some there are, I know, that take the matter\nfor the benefit, and tax the obligation by weight and measure. When\nanything is given them, they presently cast it up; \u201cWhat may such a\nhouse be worth? such an office? such an estate?\u201d as if that were the\nbenefit which is only the sign and mark of it: for the obligation\nrests in the mind, not in the matter; and all those advantages which\nwe see, handle, or hold in actual possession by the courtesy of\nanother, are but several modes or ways of explaining and putting the\ngood-will in execution. There needs no great subtlety to prove, that\nboth benefits and injuries receive their value from the intention,\nwhen even brutes themselves are able to decide this question. Tread\nupon a dog by chance, or put him to pain upon the dressing of a wound;\nthe one he passes by as an accident; and the other, in his fashion, he\nacknowledges as a kindness: but, offer to strike at him, though you\ndo him no hurt at all, he flies yet in the face of you, even for the\nmischief that you barely meant him.\nIt is further to be observed, that all benefits are good; and (like the\ndistributions of Providence) made up of wisdom and bounty; whereas the\ngift itself is neither good nor bad, but may indifferently be applied,\neither to the one or to the other. The benefit is immortal, the gift\nperishable: for the benefit itself continues when we have no longer\neither the use or the matter of it. He that is dead was alive; he that\nhas lost his eyes, did see; and, whatsoever is done, cannot be rendered\nundone. My friend (for instance) is taken by pirates; I redeem him; and\nafter that he falls into other pirates\u2019 hands; his obligation to me is\nthe same still as if he had preserved his freedom. And so, if I save\na man from any misfortune, and he falls into another; if I give him a\nsum of money, which is afterwards taken away by thieves; it comes to\nthe same case. Fortune may deprive us of the matter of a benefit, but\nthe benefit itself remains inviolable. If the benefit resided in the\nmatter, that which is good for one man would be so for another; whereas\nmany times the very same thing, given to several persons, work contrary\neffects, even to the difference of life or death; and that which is one\nbody\u2019s cure proves another body\u2019s poison. Beside that, the timing of\nit alters the value; and a crust of bread, upon a pinch, is a greater\npresent than an imperial crown. What is more familiar than in a battle\nto shoot at an enemy and kill a friend? or, instead of a friend, to\nsave an enemy? But yet this disappointment, in the event, does not at\nall operate upon the intention. What if a man cures me of a wen with\na stroke that was designed to cut off my head? or, with a malicious\nblow upon my stomach, breaks an imposthume? or, what if he saves my\nlife with a draught that was prepared to poison me? The providence\nof the issue does not at all discharge the obliquity of the intent.\nAnd the same reason holds good even in religion itself. It is not the\nincense, or the offering, that is acceptable to God, but the purity and\ndevotion of the worshipper: neither is the bare will, without action,\nsufficient, that is, where we have the means of acting; for, in that\ncase, it signifies as little to _wish_ well, without _well-doing_, as\nto _do_ good without _willing_ it. There must be effect as well as\nintention, to make me owe a benefit; but, to will against it, does\nwholly discharge it. In fine, the conscience alone is the judge, both\nof benefits and injuries.\nIt does not follow now, because the benefit rests in the good-will,\nthat therefore the good-will should be always a benefit; for if it be\nnot accompanied with government and discretion, those offices, which we\ncall _benefits_, are but the works of passion, or of chance; and many\ntimes, the greatest of all injuries. One man does me good by mistake;\nanother ignorantly; a third upon force: but none of these cases do I\ntake to be an obligation; for they were neither directed to me, nor\nwas there any kindness of intention; we do not thank the seas for the\nadvantages we receive by navigation; or the rivers with supplying us\nwith fish and flowing of our grounds; we do not thank the trees either\nfor their fruits or shades, or the winds for a fair gale; and what is\nthe difference betwixt a reasonable creature that does not know and\nan inanimate that cannot? A good _horse_ saves one man\u2019s life; a good\nsuit of _arms_ another\u2019s; and a _man_, perhaps, that never intended it,\nsaves a third. Where is the difference now betwixt the obligation of\none and of the other? A man falls into a river, and the fright cures\nhim of the ague; we may call this a kind of lucky mischance, but not\na remedy. And so it is with the good we receive, either without, or\nbeside, or contrary to intention. It is the mind, and not the event,\nthat distinguishes a benefit from an injury.\nCHAPTER V.\nTHERE MUST BE JUDGMENT IN A BENEFIT, AS WELL AS MATTER AND INTENTION;\nAND ESPECIALLY IN THE CHOICE OF THE PERSON.\nAs it is the _will_ that designs the benefit, and the _matter_ that\nconveys it, so it is the _judgment_ that perfects it; which depends\nupon so many critical niceties, that the least error, either in the\nperson, the matter, the manner, the quality, the quantity, the time, or\nthe place, spoils all.\nThe consideration of the _person_ is a main point: for we are to give\nby choice, and not by hazard. My inclination bids me oblige one man; I\nam bound in duty and justice to serve another; here it is a charity,\nthere it is pity; and elsewhere, perhaps, encouragement. There are some\nthat want, to whom I would not give; because, if I did, they would want\nstill. To one man I would barely offer a benefit; but I would press it\nupon another. To say the truth, we do not employ any more profit than\nthat which we bestow; and it is not to our friends, our acquaintances\nor countrymen, nor to this or that condition of men, that we are to\nrestrain our bounties; but wheresoever there is a man, there is a place\nand occasion for a benefit. We give to some that are good already; to\nothers, in hope to make them so: but we must do all with discretion;\nfor we are as well answerable for what we give as for what we receive;\nnay, the misplacing of a benefit is worse than the not receiving of it;\nfor the one is another man\u2019s fault; but the other is mine. The error\nof the giver does oft-times excuse the ingratitude of the receiver:\nfor a favor ill-placed is rather a profusion than a benefit. It is the\nmost shameful of losses, an inconsiderate bounty. I will choose a man\nof integrity, sincere, considerate, grateful, temperate, well-natured,\nneither covetous nor sordid: and when I have obliged such a man, though\nnot worth a groat in the world, I have gained my end. If we give only\nto receive, we lose the fairest objects of our charity: the absent,\nthe sick, the captive, and the needy. When we oblige those that can\nnever pay us again in kind, as a stranger upon his last farewell, or a\nnecessitous person upon his death-bed, we make Providence our debtor,\nand rejoice in the conscience even of a fruitless benefit. So long as\nwe are affected with passions, and distracted with hopes and fears,\nand (the most unmanly of vices) with our pleasures, we are incompetent\njudges where to place our bounties: but when death presents itself,\nand that we come to our last will and testament, we leave our fortunes\nto the most worthy. He that gives nothing, but in hopes of receiving,\nmust die intestate. It is the honesty of another man\u2019s mind that moves\nthe kindness of mine; and I would sooner oblige a grateful man than\nan ungrateful: but this shall not hinder me from doing good also to a\nperson that is known to be ungrateful: only with this difference, that\nI will serve the one in all extremities with my life and fortune, and\nthe other no farther than stands with my convenience. But what shall\nI do, you will say, to know whether a man will be grateful or not? I\nwill follow probability, and hope the best. He that sows is not sure\nto reap; nor the seaman to reach his port; nor the soldier to win\nthe field: he that weds is not sure his wife shall be honest, or his\nchildren dutiful: but shall we therefore neither sow, sail, bear arms,\nnor marry? Nay, if I knew a man to be incurably thankless, I would yet\nbe so kind as to put him in his way, or let him light a candle at mine,\nor draw water at my well; which may stand him perhaps in great stead,\nand yet not be reckoned as a benefit from me; for I do it carelessly,\nand not for his sake, but my own; as an office of humanity, without any\nchoice or kindness.\nCHAPTER VI.\nTHE MATTER OF OBLIGATIONS, WITH ITS CIRCUMSTANCES.\nNext to the choice of the _person_ follows that of the _matter_;\nwherein a regard must be had to time, place, proportion, quality;\nand to the very nicks of opportunity and humor. One man values his\npeace above his honor, another his honor above his safety; and not\na few there are that (provided they may save their bodies) never\ncare what becomes of their souls. So that good offices depend much\nupon construction. Some take themselves to be obliged, when they are\nnot; others will not believe it, when they are; and some again take\nobligations and injuries, the one for the other.\nFor our better direction, let it be noted, \u201cThat a benefit is a common\ntie betwixt the giver and receiver, with respect to both:\u201d wherefore\nit must be accommodated to the rules of discretion; for all things\nhave their bounds and measures, and so must liberality among the rest;\nthat it be neither too much for the one nor too little for the other;\nthe excess being every jot as bad as the defect. Alexander bestowed a\ncity upon one of his favorites; who modestly excusing himself, \u201cThat\nit was too much for him to receive.\u201d \u201cWell, but,\u201d says Alexander, \u201cit\nis not too much for me to give.\u201d A haughty certainly, and an imprudent\nspeech; for that which was not fit for the one to take could not be\nfit for the other to give. It passes in the world for greatness of mind\nto be perpetually giving and loading of people with bounties; but it is\none thing to know how to _give_, and another thing not to know how to\n_keep_. Give me a heart that is easy and open, but I will have no holes\nin it; let it be bountiful with judgment, but I will have nothing run\nout of it I know not how. How much greater was he that refused the city\nthan the other that offered it? Some men throw away their money as if\nthey were angry with it, which is the error commonly of weak minds and\nlarge fortunes. No man esteems of anything that comes to him by chance;\nbut when it is governed by reason, it brings credit both to the giver\nand receiver; whereas those favors are, in some sort, scandalous, that\nmake a man ashamed of his patron.\nIt is a matter of great prudence, for the benefactor to suit the\nbenefit to the condition of the receiver: who must be either his\nsuperior, his inferior, or his equal; and that which would be the\nhighest obligation imaginable to the one, would perhaps be as great a\nmockery and affront to the other; as a plate of broken meat (for the\npurpose) to a rich man were an indignity, which to a poor man is a\ncharity. The benefits of princes and of great men, are honors, offices,\nmonies, profitable commissions, countenance, and protection: the poor\nman has nothing to present but good-will, good advice, faith, industry,\nthe service and hazard of his person, an early apple, peradventure, or\nsome other cheap curiosity: equals indeed may correspond in kind; but\nwhatsoever the present be, or to whomsoever we offer it, this general\nrule must be observed, that we always design the good and satisfaction\nof the receiver, and never grant anything to his detriment. It is not\nfor a man to say, I was overcome by importunity; for when the fever is\noff, we detest the man that was prevailed upon to our destruction. I\nwill no more undo a man with his will, than forbear saving him against\nit. It is a benefit in some cases to grant, and in others to deny; so\nthat we are rather to consider the advantage than the desire of the\npetitioner. For we may in a passion earnestly beg for (and take it ill\nto be denied too) that very thing, which, upon second thoughts, we may\ncome to curse, as the occasion of a most pernicious bounty. Never give\nanything that shall turn to mischief, infamy, or shame. I will consider\nanother man\u2019s want or safety; but so as not to forget my own; unless\nin the case of a very excellent person, and then I shall not much\nheed what becomes of myself. There is no giving of water to a man in\na fever; or putting a sword into a madman\u2019s hand. He that lends a man\nmoney to carry him to a bawdy-house, or a weapon for his revenge, makes\nhimself a partaker of his crime.\nHe that would make an acceptable present, will pitch upon something\nthat is desired, sought for, and hard to be found; that which he sees\nnowhere else, and which few have; or at least not in that place or\nseason; something that may be always in his eye, and mind him of his\nbenefactor. If it be lasting and durable, so much the better; as plate,\nrather than money; statues than apparel; for it will serve as a monitor\nto mind the receiver of the obligation, which the presenter cannot so\nhandsomely do. However, let it not be improper, as arms to a woman,\nbooks to a clown, toys to a philosopher: I will not give to any man\nthat which he cannot receive, as if I threw a ball to a man without\nhands; but I will make a _return_, though he cannot receive it; for my\nbusiness is not to oblige him, but to free myself: nor anything that\nmay reproach a man of his vice or infirmity; as false dice to a cheat;\nspectacles to a man that is blind. Let it not be unseasonable neither;\nas a furred gown in summer, an umbrella in winter. It enhances the\nvalue of the present, if it was never given to him by anybody else, nor\nby me to any other; for that which we give to everybody is welcome to\nnobody.\nThe particularity does much, but yet the same thing may receive\na different estimate from several persons; for there are ways of\nmarking and recommending it in such a manner, that if the same _good\noffice_ be done to twenty people, every one of them shall reckon\nhimself peculiarly obliged as a cunning whore, if she has a thousand\nsweethearts, will persuade every one of them she loves him best. But\nthis is rather the artifice of conversation than the virtue of it.\nThe citizens of Megara send ambassadors to Alexander in the height of\nhis glory, to offer him, as a compliment, the freedom of their city.\nUpon Alexander\u2019s smiling at the proposal, they told him, that it was\na present which they had never made but to Hercules and himself.\nWhereupon Alexander treated them kindly, and accepted of it; not for\nthe presenters\u2019 sake, but because they had joined him with Hercules;\nnow unreasonably soever; for Hercules conquered nothing for himself,\nbut made his business to vindicate and to protect the miserable,\nwithout any private interest or design; but this intemperate young\nman (whose virtue was nothing else but a successful temerity) was\ntrained up from his youth in the trade of violence; the common enemy\nof mankind, as well of his friends as of his foes, and one that valued\nhimself upon being terrible to all mortals: never considering, that the\ndullest creatures are as dangerous and as dreadful, as the fiercest;\nfor the poison of a toad, or the tooth of a snake, will do a man\u2019s\nbusiness, as sure as the paw of a tiger.\nCHAPTER VII.\nTHE MANNER OF OBLIGING.\nThere is not any benefit so glorious in itself, but it may yet be\nexceedingly sweetened and improved by the _manner_ of conferring it.\nThe virtue, I know, rests in the _intent,_ the profit in the judicious\napplication of the _matter_; but the beauty and ornament of an\nobligation lies in the _manner_ of it; and it is then perfect when the\ndignity of the office is accompanied with all the charms and delicacies\nof humanity, good-nature, and address; and with dispatch too; for he\nthat puts a man off from time to time, was never right at heart.\nIn the first place, whatsoever we give, let us do it _frankly_: a\nkind benefactor makes a man happy as _soon_ as he can, and as _much_\nas he can. There should be no _delay_ in a benefit but the modesty\nof the receiver. If we cannot forsee the request, let us, however,\nimmediately grant it, and by no means suffer the repeating of it. It\nis so grievous a thing to say, _I BEG_; the very word puts a man out\nof countenance; and it is a double kindness to do the thing, and save\nan honest man the confusion of a blush. It comes too late that comes\nfor the asking: for nothing costs us so dear as that we purchase with\nour prayers: it is all we give, even for heaven itself; and even there\ntoo, where our petitions are at the fairest, we choose rather to\npresent them in secret ejaculations than by word of mouth. That is the\nlasting and the acceptable benefit that meets the receiver half-way.\nThe rule is, we are to _give_, as we would _receive_, _cheerfully_,\n_quickly_, and without _hesitation_; for there is no grace in a benefit\nthat sticks to the fingers. Nay, if there should be occasion for delay,\nlet us, however, not seem to deliberate; for _demurring_ is next door\nto _denying_; and so long as we suspend, so long are we unwilling. It\nis a court-humor to keep people upon the tenters; their injuries are\nquick and sudden, but their benefits are slow. Great ministers love\nto rack men with attendance, and account it an ostentation of their\npower to hold their suitors in hand, and to have many witnesses of\ntheir interest. A benefit should be made acceptable by all possible\nmeans, even to the end that the receiver, who is never to forget it,\nmay bear it in his mind with satisfaction. There must be no mixture of\nsourness, severity, contumely, or reproof, with our obligations; nay,\nin case there should be any occasion for so much as an admonition, let\nit be referred to another time. We are a great deal apter to remember\ninjuries than benefits; and it is enough to forgive an obligation that\nhas the nature of an offence.\nThere are some that spoil a good office after it is done and others,\nin the very instant of doing it. There be so much entreaty and\nimportunity; nay, if we do but suspect a petitioner, we put on a sour\nface; look another way; pretend haste, company, business; talk of other\nmatters, and keep him off with artificial delays, let his necessities\nbe never so pressing; and when we are put to it at last, it comes so\nhard from us that it is rather extorted than obtained; and not so\nproperly the giving of a bounty, as the quitting of a man\u2019s hold upon\nthe tug, when another is too strong for him; so that this is but doing\none kindness for me, and another for himself: he gives for his own\nquiet, after he has tormented me with difficulties and delays. The\n_manner_ of _saying_ or of _doing_ any thing, goes a great way in the\nvalue of the thing itself. It was well said of him that called a good\noffice, that was done harshly, and with an ill will, a _stony piece\nof bread_; it is necessary for him that is hungry to receive it, but\nit almost chokes a man in the going down. There must be no pride,\narrogance of looks, or tumor of words, in the bestowing of benefits; no\ninsolence of behavior, but a modesty of mind, and a diligent care to\ncatch at occasions and prevent necessities. A pause, an unkind tone,\nword, look, or action, destroys the grace of a courtesy. It corrupts a\nbounty, when it is accompanied with state, haughtiness, and elation of\nmind, in the giving of it. Some have a trick of shifting off a suitor\nwith a point of wit, or a cavil. As in the case of the Cynic that\nbegged a talent of Antigonus: \u201cThat is too much,\u201d says he, \u201cfor a Cynic\nto ask;\u201d and when he fell to a penny, \u201cThat is too little,\u201d says he,\n\u201cfor a prince to give.\u201d He might have found a way to have compounded\nthis controversy, by giving him a _penny_ as to a _Cynic_ and a\n_talent_ as from a _prince_. Whatsoever we bestow, let it be done with\na frank and cheerful countenance: a man must not give with his hand,\nand deny with his looks. He that gives quickly, gives willingly.\nWe are likewise to accompany _good deeds_ with _good words,_ and say,\n(for the purpose,) \u201cWhy should you make such a matter of this? why\ndid not you come to me sooner? why would you make use of any body\nelse? I take it ill that you should bring me a recommendation; pray\nlet there be no more of this, but when you have occasion hereafter,\ncome to me upon your own account.\u201d That is the glorious bounty, when\nthe receiver can say to himself; \u201cWhat a blessed day has this been\nto me! never was any thing done so generously, so tenderly, with so\ngood a grace. What is it I would not do to serve this man? A thousand\ntimes as much another way could not have given me this satisfaction.\u201d\nIn such a case, let the benefit be never so considerable, the manner\nof conferring it is yet the noblest part. Where there is harshness of\nlanguage, countenance, or behavior, a man had better be without it. A\nflat denial is infinitely before a vexatious delay: as a quick death is\na mercy, compared with a lingering torment. But to be put to waitings\nand intercessions, after a promise is passed, is a cruelty intolerable.\nIt is troublesome to stay long for a benefit, let it be never so great;\nand he that holds me needlessly in pain, loses two precious things,\ntime, and the proof of friendship. Nay, the very hint of a man\u2019s want\ncomes many times too late. \u201cIf I had money,\u201d said Socrates, \u201cI would\nbuy me a cloak.\u201d They that knew he wanted one should have prevented\nthe very intimation of that want. It is not the value of the present,\nbut the benevolence of the mind, that we are to consider. \u201cHe gave me\nbut a little, but it was generously and frankly done; it was a little\nout of a little: he gave it me without asking; he pressed it upon me;\nhe watched the opportunity of doing it, and took it as an obligation\nupon himself.\u201d On the other side, many benefits are great in show, but\nlittle or nothing perhaps in effect, when they come hard, slow, or at\nunawares. That which is given with pride and ostentation, is rather an\nambition than a bounty.\nSome favors are to be conferred in _public_, others in _private_.\nIn _public_ the rewards of great actions; as honors, charges, or\nwhatsoever else gives a man reputation in the world; but the good\noffices we do for a man in want, distress, or under reproach, these\nshould be known only to those that have the benefit of them. Nay, not\nto them neither, if we can handsomely conceal it from whence the favor\ncame; for the secrecy, in many cases, is a main part of the benefit.\nThere was a good man that had a friend, who was both poor and sick,\nand ashamed to own his condition: he privately conveyed a bag of money\nunder his pillow, that he might seem rather to find than receive it.\nProvided I know that I give it, no matter for his knowing from whence\nit comes that receives it. Many a man stands in need of help that has\nnot the face to confess it: if the discovery may give offence, let it\nlie concealed; he that gives to be seen would never relieve a man in\nthe dark. It would be too tedious to run through all the niceties that\nmay occur upon this subject; but, in two words, he must be a wise, a\nfriendly, and a well-bred man, that perfectly acquits himself in the\nart and duty of obliging: for all his actions must be squared according\nto the measures of _civility_, _good-nature_ and _discretion._\nCHAPTER VIII.\nTHE DIFFERENCE AND VALUE OF BENEFITS.\nWe have already spoken of _benefits_ in _general_; the _matter_ and\nthe _intention_, together with the _manner_ of conferring them. It\nfollows now, in course, to say something of the _value_ of them; which\nis rated, either by the good they do us, or by the inconvenience they\nsave us, and has no other standard than that of a judicious regard\nto circumstance and occasion. Suppose I save a man from drowning,\nthe advantage of life is all one to him, from what hand soever it\ncomes, or by what means; but yet there may be a vast difference in the\nobligation. I may do it with hazard, or with security, with trouble, or\nwith ease; willingly, or by compulsion; upon intercession, or without\nit: I may have a prospect of vain-glory or profit: I may do it in\nkindness to another, or an hundred _by-ends_ to myself; and every point\ndoes exceedingly vary the case. Two persons may part with the same sum\nof money, and yet not the same benefit: the one had it of his _own_,\nand it was but a _little_ out of a _great deal_; the other _borrowed_\nit, and bestowed upon me that which he wanted for himself. Two boys\nwere sent out to fetch a certain person to their master: the one of\nthem hunts up and down, and comes home again weary, without finding\nhim; the other falls to play with his companions at the wheel of\nFortune, sees him by chance passing by, delivers him his errand, and\nbrings him. He that found him by chance deserves to be punished; and he\nthat sought for him, and missed him, to be rewarded for his good-will.\nIn some cases we value the _thing_, in others the _labor_ and\n_attendance_. What can be more precious than good manners, good\nletters, life, and health? and yet we pay our physicians and tutors\nonly for their service in the professions. If we buy things cheap, it\nmatters not, so long as it is a bargain: it is no obligation from the\nseller, if nobody else will give him more for it. What would not a\nman give to be set ashore in a tempest? for a house in a wilderness?\na shelter in a storm? a fire, or a bit of meat, when a man is pinched\nwith hunger or cold? a defence against thieves, and a thousand other\nmatters of moment, that cost but little? And yet we know that the\nskipper has but his freight for our passage; and the carpenters and\nbricklayers do their work by the day. Those are many times the greatest\nobligations in truth, which in vulgar opinions are the smallest: as\ncomfort to the sick, poor captives; good counsel, keeping of people\nfrom wickedness, etc. Wherefore we should reckon ourselves to owe most\nfor the noblest benefits. If the physician adds care and friendship\nto the duty of his calling, and the tutor to the common method of his\nbusiness, I am to esteem them as the nearest of my relations: for to\nwatch with me, to be troubled for me, and to put off all other patients\nfor my sake, is a particular kindness: and so it is in my tutor, if\nhe takes more pains with me than with the rest of my fellows. It is\nnot enough, in this case, to pay the one his fees, and the other his\nsalary; but I am indebted to them over and above for their friendship.\nThe meanest of mechanics, if he does his work with industry and care,\nit is an usual thing to cast in something by way of reward more than\nthe bare agreement: and shall we deal worse with the preservers of our\nlives, and the reformers of our manners? He that gives me himself (if\nhe be worth taking) gives the greatest benefit: and this is the present\nwhich \u00c6schines, a poor disciple of Socrates, made to his master, and as\na matter of great consideration: \u201cOthers may have given you much,\u201d says\nhe, \u201cbut I am the only man that has left nothing to himself.\u201d \u201cThis\ngift,\u201d says Socrates, \u201cyou shall never repent of; for I will take care\nto return it better than I found it.\u201d So that a brave mind can never\nwant matter for liberality in the meanest condition; for Nature has\nbeen so kind to us, that where we have nothing of Fortune\u2019s, we may\nbestow something of our own.\nIt falls out often, that a benefit is followed with an injury; let\nwhich will be foremost, it is with the latter as with one writing\nupon another; it does in a great measure hide the former, and keep it\nfrom appearing, but it does not quite take it away. We may in some\ncases divide them, and both requite the one, and revenge the other;\nor otherwise compare them, to know whether I am creditor or debtor.\nYou have obliged me in my servant, but wounded me in my brother; you\nhave saved my son, but have destroyed my father; in this instance, I\nwill allow as much as piety, and justice, and good nature, will bear;\nbut I am not willing to set an injury against a benefit. I would\nhave some respect to the time; the obligation came first; and then,\nperhaps, the one was designed, the other against his will; under these\nconsiderations I would amplify the benefit, and lessen the injury; and\nextinguish the one with the other; nay, I would pardon the injury even\n_without_ the benefit, but much more _after_ it. Not that a man can be\nbound by one benefit to suffer all sorts of injuries; for there are\nsome cases wherein we lie under no obligation for a benefit; because\na greater injury absolves it: as, for example, a man helps me out of\na law-suit, and afterwards commits a rape upon my daughter; where the\nfollowing impiety cancels the antecedent obligation. A man lends me a\nlittle money, and then sets my house on fire; the debtor is here turned\ncreditor, when the injury outweighs the benefit. Nay, if a man does\nbut so much as repent the good office done, and grow sour and insolent\nupon it, and upbraid me with it; if he did it only for his own sake, or\nfor any other reason than for mine, I am in some degree, more or less,\nacquitted of the obligation. I am not at all beholden to him that makes\nme the instrument of his own advantage. He that does me good for his\nown sake, I will do him good for mine.\nSuppose a man makes suit for a place, and cannot obtain it, but upon\nthe ransom of ten slaves out of the galleys. If there be ten, and\n_no more_, they owe him nothing for their redemption; but _they_ are\nindebted to him for the choice, where he might have taken ten others\nas well as these. Put the case again, that by an act of grace so many\nprisoners are to be released, their names to be drawn by lot, and mine\nhappens to come out among the rest: one part of my obligation is to him\nthat put me in a capacity of freedom, and the other is to Providence\nfor my being one of that number. The greatest benefits of all have no\nwitnesses, but lie concealed in the conscience.\nThere is a great difference betwixt a common obligation and a\nparticular; he that lends my country money, obliges me only as a part\nof the whole. Plato crossed the river, and the ferry-man would take no\nmoney of him: he reflected upon it as honor done to himself; and told\nhim, \u201cThat Plato was in debt.\u201d But Plato, when he found it to be no\nmore than he did for others, recalled his words, \u201cFor,\u201d says he, \u201cPlato\nwill owe nothing in particular for a benefit in common; what I owe with\nothers, I will pay with others.\u201d\nSome will have it that the necessity of wishing a man well is some\nabatement to the obligation in the doing of him a good office. But I\nsay, on the contrary, that it is the greater; because the good-will\ncannot be changed. It is one thing to say, that a man could not but\ndo me this or that civility, because he was forced to do it; and\nanother thing, that he could not quit the good-will of doing it. In\nthe former case, I am a debtor to him that imposeth the force, in\nthe other to himself. The unchangeable good-will is an indispensable\nobligation: and, to say, that nature cannot go out of her course, does\nnot discharge us of _what we owe to Providence_. Shall he be said to\nwill, that may change his mind the next moment? and shall we question\nthe will of the Almighty, whose nature admits no change? Must the\nstars quit their stations, and fall foul one upon another? must the\nsun stand still in the middle of his course, and heaven and earth drop\ninto confusion? must a devouring fire seize upon the universe; the\nharmony of the creation be dissolved; and the whole frame of nature\nswallowed up in a dark abyss; and will nothing less than this serve to\nconvince the world of their audacious and impertinent follies? It is\nnot to say, that _these heavenly bodies are not made for us_; for in\npart they are so; and we are the better for their virtues and motions,\nwhether we will or not; though, undoubtedly, the principal cause is\nthe unalterable law of God. Providence is not moved by anything from\nwithout; but the Divine will is an everlasting law, an immutable\ndecree; and the impossibility of variation proceeds from God\u2019s purpose\nof preserving; for he never repents of his first counsels. It is not\nwith our heavenly as with our earthly father. God thought of us and\nprovided for us, before he made us: (for unto him all future events\nare present.) Man was not the work of chance; his mind carries him\nabove the slight of fortune, and naturally aspires to the contemplation\nof heaven and divine mysteries. How desperate a frenzy is it now to\nundervalue, nay, to contemn and to disclaim these divine blessings,\nwithout which we are utterly incapable of enjoying any other!\nCHAPTER IX.\nAN HONEST MAN CANNOT BE OUTDONE IN COURTESY.\nIt passes in the world for a generous and magnificent saying, that \u201cit\nis a shame for a man to be outdone in courtesy;\u201d and it is worth the\nwhile to examine, both the truth of it, and the mistake. First, there\ncan be no shame in a virtuous emulation; and, secondly, there can be\nno victory without crossing the cudgels, and yielding the cause. One\nman may have the advantage of strength, of means, of fortune; and this\nwill undoubtedly operate upon the events of good purposes, but yet\nwithout any diminution to the virtue. The good will may be the same in\nboth, and yet one may have the heels of the other; for it is not in a\ngood office as in a course, where he wins the plate that comes first to\nthe post: and even there also, chance has many times a great hand in\nthe success. Where the contest is about benefits; and that the one has\nnot only a _good will_, but _matter_ to work upon, and a power to put\nthat good intent in execution; and the other has barely a _good-will_,\nwithout either the _means_, or the _occasion_, of a requital; if he\ndoes but affectionately wish it, and endeavor it, the latter is no more\novercome in courtesy than he is in courage that dies with his sword in\nhis hand, and his face to the enemy, and without shrinking maintains\nhis station: for where _fortune_ is _par__tial_, it is enough that\nthe _good-will_ is _equal_. There are two errors in this proposition:\nfirst, to imply that a good man may be overcome; and then to imagine\nthat anything shameful can befall him. The Spartans prohibited all\nthose exercises where the victory was declared by the confession of\nthe contendant. The 300 Fabii were never said to be _conquered_, but\n_slain_; nor Regulus to be _overcome_, though he was taken _prisoner_\nby the Carthaginians. The mind may stand firm under the greatest malice\nand iniquity of fortune; and yet the giver and receiver continue upon\nequal terms: as we reckon it a drawn battle, when two combatants are\nparted, though the one has lost more blood than the other. He that\nknows how to owe a courtesy, and heartily wishes that he could requite\nit, is invincible; so that every man may be as grateful as he pleases.\nIt is your happiness to give, it is my fortune that I can only receive.\nWhat advantage now has your chance over my virtue? But there are some\nmen that have philosophized themselves almost out of the sense of human\naffections; as Diogenes, that walked naked and unconcerned through\nthe middle of Alexander\u2019s treasures, and was, as well in other men\u2019s\nopinions as in his own, even above Alexander himself, who at that\ntime had the whole world at his feet: for there was more that the one\nscorned to take than that the other had it in his power to give: and it\nis a greater generosity for a beggar to refuse money than for a prince\nto bestow it. This is a remarkable instance of an immovable mind, and\nthere is hardly any contending with it; but a man is never the less\nvaliant for being worsted by an invulnerable enemy; nor the fire one\njot the weaker for not consuming an incombustible body; nor a sword\never a whit the worse for not cleaving a rock that is impenetrable;\nneither is a grateful mind overcome for want of an answerable fortune.\nNo matter for the inequality of the things given and received, so long\nas, in point of good affection, the two parties stand upon the same\nlevel. It is no shame not to overtake a man, if we follow him as fast\nas we can. That tumor of a man, the vain-glorious Alexander, was used\nto make his boast, that never any man went beyond him in benefits; and\nyet he lived to see a poor fellow in a tub, to whom there was nothing\nthat he could give, and from whom there was nothing that he could take\naway.\nNor is it always necessary for a poor man to fly to the sanctuary of\nan invincible mind to quit scores with the bounties of a plentiful\nfortune; but it does often fall out, that the returns which he cannot\nmake in _kind_ are more than supplied in _dignity_ and _value_.\nArchelaus, a king of Macedon, invited Socrates to his palace: but he\nexcused himself, as unwilling to receive greater benefits than he\nwas able to requite. This perhaps was not _pride_ in Socrates, but\n_craft_; for he was afraid of being forced to accept of something\nwhich might possibly have been unworthy of him; beside, that he was\na man of liberty, and loath to make himself a voluntary slave. The\ntruth of it is, that Archelaus had more need of Socrates than Socrates\nof Archelaus; for he wanted a man to teach him the art of life and\ndeath, and the skill of government, and to read the book of Nature to\nhim, and show him the light at noon-day: he wanted a man that, when\nthe sun was in an eclipse, and he had locked himself up in all the\nhorror and despair imaginable; he wanted a man, I say, to deliver\nhim from his apprehensions, and to expound the prodigy to him, by\ntelling him, that there was no more in it than only that the _moon_\nwas got betwixt the _sun_ and the _earth_, and all would be well again\npresently. Let the world judge now, whether Archelaus\u2019 _bounty_, or\nSocrates\u2019 _philosophy_, would have been the greater present: he does\nnot understand the value of wisdom and friendship that does not know\na wise friend to be the noblest of presents. A rarity scarce to be\nfound, not only in a family, but in an age; and nowhere more wanted\nthan where there seems to be the greatest store. The greater a man is,\nthe more need he has of him; and the more difficulty there is both\nof finding and of knowing him. Nor is it to be said, that \u201cI cannot\nrequite such a benefactor because I am poor, and have it not;\u201d I can\ngive good counsel; a conversation wherein he may take both delight and\nprofit; freedom of discourse, without flattery; kind attention, where\nhe deliberates; and faith inviolable where he trusts; I may bring him\nto a love and knowledge of truth; deliver him from the errors of his\ncredulity, and teach him to distinguish betwixt friends and parasites.\nCHAPTER X.\nTHE QUESTION DISCUSSED, WHETHER OR NOT A MAN MAY GIVE OR RETURN A\nBENEFIT TO HIMSELF?\nThere are many cases, wherein a man speaks of himself as of another.\nAs, for example, \u201cI may thank myself for this; I am angry at myself; I\nhate myself for that.\u201d And this way of speaking has raised a dispute\namong the Stoics, \u201cwhether or not a man may give or return a benefit to\nhimself?\u201d For, say they, if I may hurt myself, I may oblige myself; and\nthat which were a benefit to another body, why is it not so to myself?\nAnd why am I not as criminal in being ungrateful to myself as if I were\nso to another body? And the case is the same in flattery and several\nother vices; as, on the other side, it is a point of great reputation\nfor a man to command himself. Plato thanked Socrates for what he had\n_learned_ of him; and why might not Socrates as well thank Plato for\nthat which he had _taught_ him? \u201cThat which you want,\u201d says Plato,\n\u201cborrow it of yourself.\u201d And why may not I as well give to myself as\nlend? If I may be angry with myself, I may thank myself; and if I chide\nmyself, I may as well commend myself, and do myself good as well as\nhurt; there is the same reason of contraries: it is a common thing to\nsay, \u201cSuch a man hath done himself an injury.\u201d If an injury, why not a\nbenefit? But I say, that no man can be a debtor to himself; for the\nbenefit must naturally precede the acknowledgment; and a debtor can\nno more be without a creditor than a husband without a wife. Somebody\nmust give, that somebody may receive; and it is neither giving nor\nreceiving, the passing of a thing from one hand to the other. What\nif a man should be ungrateful in the case? there is nothing lost;\nfor he that gives it has it: and he that gives and he that receives\nare one and the same person. Now, properly speaking, no man can be\nsaid to bestow any thing upon himself, for he obeys his nature, that\nprompts every man to do himself all the good he can. Shall I call him\nliberal, that gives to himself; or good-natured, that pardons himself;\nor pitiful, that is affected with his own misfortunes? That which\nwere bounty, clemency, compassion, to another, to myself is nature.\nA benefit is a voluntary thing; but to do good to myself is a thing\nnecessary. Was ever any man commended for getting out of a ditch, or\nfor helping himself against thieves? Or what if I should allow, that a\nman might confer a benefit upon himself; yet he cannot owe it, for he\nreturns it in the same instant that he receives it. No man gives, owes,\nor makes a return, but to another. How can one man do that to which two\nparties are requisite in so many respects? Giving and receiving must\ngo backward and forward betwixt two persons. If a man give to himself,\nhe may sell to himself; but to sell is to alienate a thing, and to\ntranslate the right of it to another; now, to make a man both the giver\nand the receiver is to unite two contraries. That is a benefit, which,\nwhen it is given, may possibly not be requited; but he that gives to\nhimself, must necessarily receive what he gives; beside, that all\nbenefits are given for the receiver\u2019s sake, but that which a man does\nfor himself, is for the sake of the giver.\nThis is one of those subtleties, which, though hardly worth a man\u2019s\nwhile, yet it is not labor absolutely lost neither. There is more of\ntrick and artifice in it than solidity; and yet there is matter of\ndiversion too; enough perhaps to pass away a winter\u2019s evening, and keep\na man waking that is heavy-headed.\nCHAPTER XI.\nHOW FAR ONE MAN MAY BE OBLIGED FOR A BENEFIT DONE TO ANOTHER.\nThe question now before us requires _distinction_ and _caution_. For\nthough it be both natural and generous to wish well to my friend\u2019s\nfriend, yet a _second-hand benefit_ does not bind me any further than\nto a _second-hand gratitude_: so that I may receive great satisfaction\nand advantage from a good office done to my friend, and yet lie under\nno obligation myself; or, if any man thinks otherwise, I must ask\nhim, in the first place, Where it begins? and, How it extends? that\nit may not be boundless. Suppose a man obliges the son, does that\nobligation work upon the father? and why not upon the uncle too? the\nbrother? the wife? the sister? the mother? nay, upon all that have any\nkindness for him? and upon all the lovers of his friends? and upon all\nthat love them too? and so _in infinitum_. In this case we must have\nrecourse, as is said heretofore, to the intention of the benefactor,\nand fix the obligation upon him unto whom the kindness was directed.\nIf a man manures my ground, keeps my house from burning or falling,\nit is a benefit to me, for I am the better for it, and my house and\nland are insensible. But if he save the life of my son, the benefit is\nto my son; it is a joy and a comfort to me, but no obligation. I am\nas much concerned as I ought to be in the health, the felicity, and\nthe welfare of my son, as happy in the enjoyment of him; and I should\nbe as unhappy as is possible in his loss; but it does not follow that\nI must of necessity lie under an obligation for being either happier\nor less miserable, by another body\u2019s means. There are some benefits,\nwhich although conferred upon one man, may yet work upon others; as\na sum of money may be given to a poor man for his own sake, which in\nthe consequence proves the relief of his whole family; but still the\nimmediate receiver is the debtor for it; for the question is not, to\nwhom it comes afterward to be transferred, but who is the principal?\nand upon whom it was first bestowed? My son\u2019s life is as dear to me\nas my own; and in saving him you preserve me too: in this case I will\nacknowledge myself obliged to you, that is to say, in my son\u2019s name;\nfor in my own, and in strictness, I am not; but I am content to make\nmyself a voluntary debtor. What if he had borrowed money? my paying\nof it does not at all make it my debt. It would put me to the blush\nperhaps to have him taken in bed with another man\u2019s wife; but that does\nnot make me an adulterer. It is a wonderful delight and satisfaction\nthat I receive in his safety; but still this good is not a benefit. A\nman may be the better for an animal, a plant, a stone; but there must\nbe a will, an intention, to make it an obligation. You save the son\nwithout so much as knowing the father, nay, without so much as thinking\nof him; and, perhaps you would have done the same thing even if you had\nhated him.\nBut without any further alteration of dialogue, the conclusion is this;\nif you meant him the kindness, he is answerable for it, and I may enjoy\nthe fruit of it without being obliged by it: but if it was done for\nmy sake, then I am accountable; or howsoever, upon any occasion, I am\nready to do you all the kind offices imaginable; not as the return of\na benefit, but as the earnest of a friendship; which you are not to\nchallenge neither, but to entertain as an act of honor and of justice,\nrather than of gratitude. If a man find the body of my dead father in\na desert, and give it a burial; if he did it as to my father, I am\nbeholden to him: but if the body was unknown to him, and that he would\nhave done the same thing for any other body, I am no farther concerned\nin it than as a piece of public humanity.\nThere are, moreover, some cases wherein an unworthy person may be\nobliged and for the sake of others: and the sottish extract of an\nancient nobilty may be preferred before a better man that is but of\nyesterday\u2019s standing. And it is but reasonable to pay a reverence\neven to the memory of eminent virtues. He that is not illustrious in\nhimself, may yet be reputed so in the right of his ancestors: and\nthere is a gratitude to be entailed upon the offspring of famous\nprogenitors. Was it not for the _father\u2019s_ sake that Cicero the _son_\nwas made counsel? and was it not the eminence of one Pompey that raised\nand dignified the rest of his family? How came Caligula to be emperor\nof the world? a man so cruel, that he spilt blood as greedily as if\nhe were to drink it; the empire was not given to himself, but to his\nfather Germanicus. A brave man deserved that for him, which he could\nnever have challenged upon his own merit. What was it that preferred\nFabius Persicus, (whose very mouth was the uncleanest part about him,)\nwhat was it but the 300 of that family that so generously opposed the\nenemy for the safety of the commonwealth?\nNay, Providence itself is gracious to the wicked posterity of an\nhonorable race. The counsels of heaven are guided by wisdom, mercy, and\njustice. Some men are made kings of their proper virtues, without any\nrespect to their predecessors: others for their ancestors\u2019 sakes, whose\nvirtues, though neglected in their lives, come to be afterward rewarded\nin their issues. And it is but equity, that our gratitude should extend\nas far as the influence of their heroical actions and examples.\nCHAPTER XII.\nTHE BENEFACTOR MUST HAVE NO BY-ENDS.\nWe come now to the main point of the matter in question: that is to\nsay, whether or not it be a thing desirable in itself, the giving and\nreceiving of benefits? There is a sect of philosophers that accounts\nnothing valuable but what is profitable, and so makes all virtue\nmercenary; an unmanly mistake to imagine, that the hope of gain, or\nfear of loss, should make a man either the more or less honest. As\nwho should say, \u201cWhat will I get by it, and I will be an honest man?\u201d\nWhereas, on the contrary, honesty is a thing in itself to be purchased\nat any rate. It is not for a body to say, \u201cIt will be a charge, a\nhazard, I shall give offence,\u201d etc. My business is to do what I ought\nto do: all other considerations are foreign to the office. Whensoever\nmy duty calls me, it is my part to attend, without scrupulizing upon\nforms or difficulties. Shall I see an honest man oppressed at the bar,\nand not assist him, for fear of a court faction? or not second him upon\nthe highway against thieves, for fear of a broken head? and choose\nrather to sit still, the quiet spectator of fraud and violence? Why\nwill men be just, temperate, generous, brave, but because it carries\nalong with it fame and a good conscience? and for the same reason, and\nno other, (to apply it to the subject in hand,) let a man also be\nbountiful. The school of Epicurus, I am sure, will never swallow this\ndoctrine: (that effeminate tribe of lazy and voluptuous philosophers;)\nthey will tell you, that virtue is but the servant and vassal of\npleasure. \u201cNo,\u201d says Epicurus, \u201cI am not for pleasure neither without\nvirtue.\u201d But, why then for pleasure, say I, _before_ virtue? Not that\nthe stress of the controversy lies upon the _order_ only; for the\n_power_ of it, as well as the _dignity_, is now under debate. It is\nthe office of virtue to superintend, to lead, and to govern; but the\nparts you have assigned it, are to submit, to follow, and to be under\ncommand. But this, you will say, is nothing to the purpose, so long as\nboth sides are agreed, that there can be no happiness without _virtue_:\n\u201cTake away that,\u201d says Epicurus, \u201cand I am as little a friend to\npleasure as you.\u201d The pinch, in short, is this, whether virtue itself\nbe the supreme good or the only cause of it? It is not the inverting of\nthe order that will clear this point; (though it is a very preposterous\nerror, to set that first which should be last.) It does not half\nso much offend me; ranging of pleasure before virtue, as the very\ncomparing of them; and the bringing of the two opposites, and professed\nenemies, into any sort of competition.\nThe drift of this discourse is, to support the cause of benefits; and\nto prove, that it is a mean and dishonorable thing to give for any\nother end than for giving\u2019s sake. He that gives for gain, profit, or\nany by-end, destroys the very intent of bounty; for it falls only upon\nthose that do not want, and perverts the charitable inclinations of\nprinces and of great men, who cannot reasonably propound to themselves\nany such end. What does the sun get by travelling about the universe;\nby visiting and comforting all the quarters of the earth? Is the whole\ncreation made and ordered for the good of mankind, and every particular\nman only for the good of himself? There passes not an hour of our\nlives, wherein we do not enjoy the blessings of Providence, without\nmeasure and without intermission. And what design can the Almighty have\nupon us, who is in himself full, safe, and inviolable? If he should\ngive only for his own sake, what would become of poor mortals, that\nhave nothing to return him at best but dutiful acknowledgments? It is\nputting out of a benefit to interest only to bestow where we may place\nit to advantage.\nLet us be liberal then, after the example of our great Creator, and\ngive to others with the same consideration that he gives to us.\nEpicurus\u2019s answer will be to this, that God gives no benefits at all,\nbut turns his back upon the world; and without any concern for us,\nleaves Nature to take her course: and whether he does anything himself,\nor nothing, he takes no notice, however, either of the good or of the\nill that is done here below. If there were not an ordering and an\nover-ruling Providence, how comes it (say I, on the other side) that\nthe universality of mankind should ever have so unanimously agreed in\nthe madness of worshipping a power that can neither hear nor help us?\nSome blessings are freely given us; others upon our prayers are granted\nus; and every day brings forth instances of great and of seasonable\nmercies. There never was yet any man so insensible as not to feel, see,\nand understand, a Deity in the ordinary methods of nature, though many\nhave been so obstinately ungrateful as not to confess it; nor is any\nman so wretched as not to be a partaker in that divine bounty. Some\nbenefits, it is true, may appear to be unequally divided; but it is\nno small matter yet that we possess in common: and which Nature has\nbestowed upon us in her very self. If God be not bountiful, whence is\nit that we have all that we pretend to? That which we give, and that\nwhich we deny, that which we lay up, and that which we squander away?\nThose innumerable delights for the entertainment of our eyes, our\nears, and our understandings? nay, that copious matter even for luxury\nitself? For care is taken, not only for our necessities, but also for\nour pleasures, and for the gratifying of all our senses and appetites.\nSo many pleasant groves; fruitful and salutary plants; so many fair\nrivers that serve us, both for recreation, plenty, and commerce:\nvicissitudes of seasons; varieties of food, by nature made ready to our\nhands, and the whole creation itself subjected to mankind for health,\nmedicine and dominion. We can be thankful to a friend for a few acres,\nor a little money: and yet for the freedom and command of the whole\nearth, and for the great benefits of our being, as life, health, and\nreason, we look upon ourselves as under no obligation. If a man bestows\nupon us a house that is delicately beautified with paintings, statues,\ngildings, and marble, we make a mighty business of it, and yet it lies\nat the mercy of a puff of wind, the snuff of a candle, and a hundred\nother accidents, to lay it in the dust. And is it nothing now to sleep\nunder the canopy of heaven, where we have the globe of the earth for\nour place of repose, and the glories of the heavens for our spectacle?\nHow comes it that we should so much value what we have, and yet at\nthe same time be so unthankful for it? Whence is it that we have our\nbreath, the comforts of light and of heat, the very blood that runs in\nour veins? the cattle that feed us, and the fruits of the earth that\nfeed them? Whence have we the growth of our bodies, the succession of\nour ages, and the faculties of our minds? so many veins of metals,\nquarries of marble, etc. The seed of everything is in itself, and it is\nthe blessing of God that raises it out of the dark into act and motion.\nTo say nothing of the charming varieties of music, beautiful objects,\ndelicious provisions for the palate, exquisite perfumes, which are cast\nin, over and above, to the common necessities of our being.\nAll this, says Epicurus, we are to ascribe to Nature. And why not to\nGod, I beseech ye? as if they were not both of them one and the same\npower, working in the whole, and in every part of it. Or, if you call\nhim the Almighty Jupiter; the Thunderer; the Creator and Preserver of\nus all: it comes to the same issue; some will express him under the\nnotion of _Fate_; which is only a connexion of causes, and himself the\nuppermost and original, upon which all the rest depend. The Stoics\nrepresent the several _functions_ of the _Almighty Power_ under\nseveral _appellations_. When they speak of him as the father and the\nfountain of all beings, they call him _Bacchus_: and under the name of\n_Hercules_, they denote him to be _indefatigable_ and _invincible_; and\nin the contemplation of him in the _reason_, _order_, _proportion_, and\n_wisdom_ of his proceedings, they call him _Mercury_; so that which way\nsoever they look, and under what name soever they couch their meaning,\nthey never fail of finding him; for he is everywhere, and fills his\nown work. If a man should borrow money of Seneca, and say that he owes\nit to Amn\u00e6us or Lucius, he may change the name but not his creditor;\nfor let him take which of the three names he pleases, he is still a\ndebtor to the same person. As justice, integrity, prudence, frugality,\nfortitude, are all of them goods of one and the same mind, so that\nwhichsoever of them pleases us, we cannot distinctly say that it is\nthis or that, but the mind.\nBut, not to carry this digression too far; that which God himself does,\nwe are sure is well done; and we are no less sure, that for whatsoever\nhe gives, he neither wants, expects, nor receives, anything in return;\nso that the end of a benefit ought to be the advantage of the receiver;\nand that must be our scope without any by-regard to ourselves. It is\nobjected to us, the singular caution we prescribe in the choice of the\nperson: for it were a madness, we say, for a husbandman to sow the\nsand: which, if true, say they, you have an eye upon profit, as well\nin giving as in plowing and sowing. And then they say again, that if\nthe conferring of a benefit were desirable in itself, it would have\nno dependence upon the choice of a man; for let us give it when, how,\nor wheresoever we please, it would be still a benefit. This does not\nat all affect our assertion; for the person, the matter, the manner,\nand the time, are circumstances absolutely necessary to the reason of\nthe action: there must be a right judgment in all respects to make it\na benefit. It is my duty to be true to a trust, and yet there may be\na time or a place, wherein I would make little difference betwixt the\nrenouncing of it and the delivering of it up; and the same rule holds\nin benefits; I will neither render the one, nor bestow the other, to\nthe damage of the receiver. A wicked man will run all risks to do\nan injury, and to compass his revenge; and shall not an honest man\nventure as far to do a good office? All benefits must be gratuitous. A\nmerchant sells me the corn that keeps me and my family from starving;\nbut he sold it for his interests, as well as I bought it for mine;\nand so I owe him nothing for it. He that gives for profit, gives to\nhimself; as a physician or a lawyer, gives counsel for a fee, and only\nmakes use of me for his own ends; as a grazier fats his cattle to\nbring them to a better market. This is more properly the driving of a\ntrade than the cultivating of a generous commerce. This for that, is\nrather a truck than a benefit; and he deserves to be cozened that gives\nany thing in hope of a return. And in truth, what end should a man\nhonorably propound? not _profit_; sure that is _vulgar_ and _mechanic_;\nand he that does not contemn it can never be grateful. And then for\n_glory_, it is a mighty matter indeed for a man to boast of doing his\nduty. We are to _give_, if it were only to avoid _not giving_; if any\nthing comes of it, it is clear gain; and, at worst, there is nothing\nlost; beside, that one benefit well placed makes amends for a thousand\nmiscarriages. It is not that I would exclude the benefactor neither for\nbeing himself the better for a good office he does for another. Some\nthere are that do us good only for their own sakes; others for ours;\nand some again for both. He that does it for me in common with himself,\nif he had a prospect upon both in the doing it, I am obliged to him for\nit; and glad with all my heart that he had a share in it. Nay, I were\nungrateful and unjust if I should not rejoice, that what was beneficial\nto me might be so likewise to himself.\nTo pass now to the matter of gratitude and ingratitude. There never\nwas any man yet so wicked as not to approve of the one, and detest\nthe other; as the two things in the whole world, the one to be the\nmost abominated, the other the most esteemed. The very story of an\nungrateful action puts us out of all patience, and gives us a loathing\nfor the author of it. \u201cThat inhuman villain,\u201d we cry, \u201cto do so horrid\na thing:\u201d not, \u201cthat inconsiderate fool for omitting so profitable a\nvirtue;\u201d which plainly shows the sense we naturally have, both of the\none and of the other, and that we are led to it by a common impulse of\nreason and of conscience. Epicurus fancies God to be without power,\nand without arms; above fear himself, and as little to be feared. He\nplaces him betwixt the orbs, solitary and idle, out of the reach of\nmortals, and neither hearing our prayers nor minding our concerns;\nand allows him only such a veneration and respect as we pay to our\nparents. If a man should ask him now, why any reverence at all, if we\nhave no obligation to him, or rather, why that greater reverence to his\nfortuitous atoms? his answer would be, that it was for their majesty\nand their admirable nature, and not out of any hope or expectation from\nthem. So that by his proper confession, a thing may be desirable for\nits own worth. But, says he, gratitude is a virtue that has commonly\nprofit annexed to it. And where is the virtue, say I, that has not? but\nstill the virtue is to be valued for itself, and not for the profit\nthat attends it. There is no question, but gratitude for benefits\nreceived is the ready way to procure more; and in requiting one friend\nwe encourage many: but these accessions fall in by the by; and if I\nwere sure that the doing of good offices would be my ruin, I would yet\npursue them. He that visits the sick, in hope of a legacy, let him be\nnever so friendly in all other cases, I look upon him in this to be no\nbetter than a raven, that watches a weak sheep only to peck out the\neyes of it. We never give with so much judgment or care, as when we\nconsider the honesty of the action, without any regard to the profit of\nit; for our understandings are corrupted by fear, hope, and pleasure.\nCHAPTER XIII.\nTHERE ARE MANY CASES WHEREIN A MAN MAY BE MINDED OF A BENEFIT, BUT IT\nIS VERY RARELY TO BE CHALLENGED, AND NEVER TO BE UPBRAIDED.\nIf the world were wise, and as honest as it should be, there would be\nno need of caution or precept how to behave ourselves in our several\nstations and duties; for both the giver and the receiver would do what\nthey ought to do on their own accord: the one would be bountiful, and\nthe other grateful, and the only way of minding a man of one good turn\nwould be the following of it with another. But as the case stands, we\nmust take other measures, and consult the best we can, the common ease\nand relief of mankind.\nAs there are several sorts of ungrateful men, so there must be several\nways of dealing with them, either by artifice, counsel, admonition,\nor reproof, according to the humor of the person, and the degree of\nthe offence: provided always, that as well in the reminding a man of\na benefit, as in the bestowing of it, the good of the receiver be\nthe principal thing intended. There is a curable ingratitude, and an\nincurable; there is a slothful, a neglectful, a proud, a dissembling, a\ndisclaiming, a heedless, a forgetful, and a malicious ingratitude; and\nthe application must be suited to the matter we have to work upon. A\ngentle nature may be reclaimed by authority, advice, or reprehension;\na father, a husband, a friend may do good in the case. There are a sort\nof lazy and sluggish people, that live as if they were asleep, and must\nbe lugged and pinched to wake them. These men are betwixt grateful\nand ungrateful; they will neither deny an obligation nor return it,\nand only want quickening. I will do all I can to hinder any man from\nill-doing, but especially a friend; and yet more especially from doing\nill to me. I will rub up his memory with new benefits: if that will not\nserve, I will proceed to good counsel, and from thence to rebuke: if\nall fails, I will look upon him as a desperate debtor, and even let him\nalone in his ingratitude, without making him my enemy: for no necessity\nshall ever make me spend time in wrangling with any man upon that point.\nAssiduity of obligation strikes upon the conscience as well as the\nmemory, and pursues an ungrateful man till he becomes grateful: if one\ngood office will not do it, try a second, and then a third. No man can\nbe so thankless, but either shame, occasion, or example, will, at some\ntime or other, prevail upon him. The very beasts themselves, even lions\nand tigers, are gained by good usage: beside, that one obligation does\nnaturally draw on another; and a man would not willingly leave his own\nwork imperfect. \u201cI have helped him thus far, and I will even go through\nwith it now.\u201d So that, over and above the delight and the virtue of\nobliging, one good turn is a shouting-horn to another. This, of all\nhints, is perhaps the most effectual, as well as the most generous.\nIn some cases it must be carried more home: as in that of Julius C\u00e6sar,\nwho, as he was hearing a cause, the defendant finding himself pinched;\n\u201cSir,\u201d says he, \u201cdo not you remember a strain you got in your ankle\nwhen you commanded in Spain; and that a soldier lent you his cloak\nfor a cushion, upon the top of a craggy rock, under the shade of a\nlittle tree, in the heat of the day?\u201d \u201cI remember it perfectly well,\u201d\nsays C\u00e6sar, \u201cand that when I was ready to choke with thirst, an honest\nfellow fetched me a draught of water in his helmet.\u201d \u201cBut that man, and\nthat helmet,\u201d says the soldier, \u201cdoes C\u00e6sar think that he could not\nknow them again, if he saw them?\u201d \u201cThe man, perchance, I might,\u201d says\nC\u00e6sar, somewhat offended, \u201cbut not the helmet. But what is the story\nto my business? you are none of the man.\u201d \u201cPardon me, Sir,\u201d says the\nsoldier, \u201cI am that very man; but C\u00e6sar may well forget me: for I have\nbeen trepanned since, and lost an eye at the battle of Munda, where\nthat helmet too had the honor to be cleft with a Spanish blade.\u201d C\u00e6sar\ntook it as it was intended: and it was an honorable and a prudent way\nof refreshing his memory. But this would not have gone down so well\nwith Tiberius: for when an old acquaintance of his began his address\nto him with, \u201cYou remember, C\u00e6sar.\u201d \u201cNo,\u201d says C\u00e6sar, (cutting him\nshort,) \u201cI do not remember what I WAS.\u201d Now, with him, it was better\nto be forgotten than remembered; for an _old friend_ was as bad as an\n_informer_. It is a common thing for men to hate the authors of their\npreferment, as the witnesses of their mean original.\nThere are some people well enough disposed to be grateful, but\nthey cannot hit upon it without a prompter; they are a little like\nschool-boys that have treacherous memories; it is but helping them\nhere and there with a word, when they stick, and they will go through\nwith their lesson; they must be taught to be thankful, and it is a\nfair step, if we can but bring them to be willing, and only offer\nat it. Some benefits we have neglected; some we are not willing to\nremember. He is ungrateful that disowns an obligation, and so is he\nthat dissembles it, or to his power does not requite it; but the worst\nof all is he that forgets it. Conscience, or occasion, may revive the\nrest; but here the very memory of it is lost. Those eyes that cannot\nendure the light are weak, but those are stark blind that cannot see\nit. I do not love to hear people say, \u201cAlas! poor man, he has forgotten\nit,\u201d as if that were the excuse of ingratitude, which is the very cause\nof it: for if he were not ungrateful, he would not be forgetful, and\nlay that out of the way which should be always uppermost and in sight.\nHe that thinks as he ought to do, of requiting a benefit, is in no\ndanger of forgetting it. There are, indeed, some benefits so great that\nthey can never slip the memory; but those which are less in value, and\nmore in number, do commonly escape us. We are apt enough to acknowledge\nthat \u201csuch a man has been the making of us;\u201d so long as we are in\npossession of the advantage he has brought us; but new appetites deface\nold kindnesses, and we carry our prospect forward to something more,\nwithout considering what we have obtained already. All that is past\nwe give for lost; so that we are only intent upon the future. When a\nbenefit is once out of sight, or out of use, it is buried.\nIt is the freak of many people, they cannot do a good office but they\nare presently boasting of it, drunk or sober: and about it goes into\nall companies what wonderful things they have done for this man, and\nwhat for the other. A foolish and a dangerous vanity, of a doubtful\nfriend to make a certain enemy. For these reproaches and contempts will\nset everybody\u2019s tongue a walking; and people will conclude that these\nthings would never be, if there were not something very extraordinary\nin the bottom of it. When it comes to that once, there is not any\ncalumny but fastens more or less, nor any falsehood so incredible, but\nin some part or other of it, shall pass for a truth. Our great mistake\nis this, we are still inclined to make the most of what we give, and\nthe least of what we receive; whereas we should do the clean contrary.\n\u201cIt might have been more, but he had a great many to oblige. It was as\nmuch as he could well spare; but he will make it up some other time,\u201d\netc. Nay, we should be so far from making publication of our bounties,\nas not to hear them so much as mentioned without sweetening the matter:\nas, \u201cAlas, I owe him a great deal more than that comes to. If it were\nin my power to serve him, I should be very glad of it.\u201d And this, too,\nnot with the figure of a compliment, but with all humanity and truth.\nThere was a man of quality, that in the triumviral proscription, was\nsaved by one of C\u00e6sar\u2019s friends, who would be still twitting him with\nit; who it was that preserved him, and telling him over and over, \u201cyou\nhad gone to pot, friend, but for me.\u201d \u201cPr\u2019ythee,\u201d says the proscribed,\n\u201clet me hear no more of this, or even leave me as you found me: I am\nthankful enough of myself to acknowledge that I owe you my life, but it\nis death to have it rung in my ears perpetually as a reproach; it looks\nas if you had only saved me to carry me about for a spectacle. I would\nfain forget the misfortune that I was once a prisoner, without being\nled in triumph every day of my life.\u201d\nOh! the pride and folly of a great fortune, that turns benefits\ninto injuries! that delights in excesses, and disgraces every thing\nit does! Who would receive any thing from it upon these terms? the\nhigher it raises us, the more sordid it makes us. Whatsoever it gives\nit corrupts. What is there in it that should thus puff us up? by\nwhat magic is it that we are so transformed, that we do no longer\nknow ourselves? Is it impossible for greatness to be liberal without\ninsolence? The benefits that we receive from our superiors are then\nwelcome when they come with an open hand, and a clear brow; without\neither contumely or state; and so as to prevent our necessities. The\nbenefit is never the greater for the making of a bustle and a noise\nabout it: but the benefactor is much the less for the ostentation of\nhis good deeds; which makes that odious to us, which would otherwise\nbe delightful. Tiberius had gotten a trick, when any man begged money\nof him, to refer him to the senate, where all the petitioners were to\ndeliver up the names of their creditors. His end perhaps was, to deter\nmen from asking, by exposing the condition of their fortunes to an\nexamination. But it was, however, a benefit turned unto a reprehension,\nand he made a reproach of a bounty.\nBut it is not enough yet to forbear the casting of a benefit in a man\u2019s\nteeth; for there are some that will not allow it to be so much as\nchallenged. For an ill man, say they, will not make a return, though it\nbe demanded, and a good man will do it of himself: and then the asking\nof it seems to turn it into a debt. It is a kind of injury to be too\nquick with the former: for to call upon him too soon reproaches him, as\nif he would not have done it otherwise. Nor would I recall a benefit\nfrom any man so as to force it, but only to receive it. If I let him\nquite alone, I make myself guilty of his ingratitude: and undo him for\nwant of plain dealing. A father reclaims a disobedient son, a wife\nreclaims a dissolute husband; and one friend excites the languishing\nkindness of another. How many men are lost for want of being touched to\nthe quick? So long as I am not pressed, I will rather desire a favor,\nthan so much as mention a requital; but if my country, my family, or\nmy liberty, be at stake, my zeal and indignation shall overrule my\nmodesty, and the world shall then understand that I have done all I\ncould, not to stand in need of an ungrateful man. And in conclusion the\nnecessity of receiving a benefit shall overcome the shame of recalling\nit. Nor is it only allowable upon some exigents to put the receiver in\nmind of a good turn, but it is many times for the common advantage of\nboth parties.\nCHAPTER XIV.\nHOW FAR TO OBLIGE OR REQUITE A WICKED MAN.\nThere are some benefits whereof a wicked man is wholly incapable; of\nwhich hereafter. There are others, which are bestowed upon him, not\nfor his own sake, but for secondary reasons; and of these we have\nspoken in part already. There are, moreover, certain common offices\nof humanity, which are only allowed him as he is a man, and without\nany regard either to vice or virtue. To pass over the first point; the\nsecond must be handled with care and distinction, and not without some\nseeming exceptions to the general rule; as first, here is no _choice_\nor _intention_ in the case, but it is a good office done him for some\n_by-interest_, or by _chance_. Secondly, There is no _judgment_ in\nit neither, for it is to a _wicked man_. But to shorten the matter:\nwithout these circumstances it is not properly a benefit; or at least\nnot to him; for it looks another way. I rescue a friend from thieves,\nand the other escapes for company. I discharge a debt for a friend, and\nthe other comes off too: for they were both in a bond. The third is of\na great latitude, and varies according to the degree of generosity on\nthe one side, and of wickedness on the other. Some benefactors will\nsupererogate, and do more than they are bound to do; and some men are\nso lewd, that it is dangerous to do them any sort of good; no, not so\nmuch as by way of return or requital.\nIf the benefactor\u2019s bounty must extend to the bad as well as the\ngood; put the case, that I promise a good office to an ungrateful\nman; we are first to distinguish (as I said before) betwixt a _common\nbenefit_ and a _personal_; betwixt what is given for _merit_ and what\nfor _company_. Secondly, Whether or not we know the person to be\nungrateful, and can reasonably conclude, that this vice is _incurable_.\nThirdly, A consideration must be had of the promise, how far that may\noblige us. The two first points are cleared both in one: we cannot\njustify any particular kindness for one that we conclude to be a\nhopelessly wicked man: so that the force of the promise is in the\nsingle point in question. In the promise of a good office to a wicked\nor ungrateful man, I am to blame if I did it knowingly; and I am to\nblame nevertheless, if I did it otherwise: but I must yet make it good,\n(under due qualifications,) because I promised it; that is to say,\nmatters continuing in the same state, for no man is answerable for\naccidents. I will sup at such a place though it be cold; I will rise\nat such an hour though I be sleepy; but if it prove tempestuous, or\nthat I fall sick of a fever, I will neither do the one nor the other.\nI promise to second a friend in a quarrel, or to plead his cause; and\nwhen I come into the field, or into the court, it proves to be against\nmy father or my brother: I promise to go a journey with him, but there\nis no traveling upon the road for robbing; my child is fallen sick; or\nmy wife is in labor: these circumstances are sufficient to discharge\nme; for a promise against law or duty is void in its own nature.\nThe counsels of a wise man are certain, but events are uncertain: and\nyet if I have passed a rash promise, I will in some degree punish the\ntemerity of making it with the damage of keeping it, unless it turn\nvery much to my shame or detriment, and then I will be my own confessor\nin the point, and rather be once guilty of denying, than always of\ngiving. It is not with a benefit as with a debt\u2014it is one thing to\ntrust an ill paymaster, and another thing to oblige an unworthy\nperson\u2014the one is an ill man, and the other only an ill husband.\nThere was a valiant fellow in the army, that Philip of Macedon took\nparticular notice of, and he gave him several considerable marks of\nthe kindness he had for him. This soldier put to sea and was cast away\nupon a coast where a charitable neighbor took him up half dead, carried\nhim to the house, and there, at his own charge maintained and provided\nfor him thirty days, until he was perfectly recovered, and, after all,\nfurnished him over and above, with a viaticum at parting. The soldier\ntold him the mighty matters that he would do for him in return, so soon\nas he should have the honor once again to see his master. To court he\ngoes, tells Philip of the wreck, but not a syllable of his preserver,\nand begs the estate of this very man that kept him alive. It was with\nPhilip as it was with many other princes, they give they know not\nwhat, especially in a time of war. He granted the soldier his request,\ncontemplating at the same time, the impossibility of satisfying so many\nravenous appetites as he had to please. When the good man came to be\nturned out of all, he was not so mealy-mouthed as to thank his majesty\nfor not giving away his person too as well as his fortune; but in a\nbold, frank letter to Philip, made a just report of the whole story.\nThe king was so incensed at the abuse, that he immediately commanded\nthe right owner to be restored to his estate, and the unthankful guest\nand soldier to be stigmatized for an example to others.\nShould Philip now have kept this promise? First, he owed the soldier\nnothing. Secondly, it would have been injurious and impious; and,\nlastly, a precedent of dangerous consequence to human society; for it\nwould have been little less than an interdiction of fire and water to\nthe miserable, to have inflicted such a penalty upon relieving them; so\nthat there must be always some tacit exception or reserve: _if I can_,\n_if I may_; or, _if matters continue as they were_.\nIf it should be my fortune to receive a benefit from one that\nafterwards betrays his country, I should still reckon myself obliged\nto him for such a requital as might stand with my public duty; I\nwould not furnish him with arms, nor with money or credit, or levy\nor pay soldiers; but I should not stick to gratify him at my own\nexpense with such curiosities as might please him one way without\ndoing mischief another. I would not do any thing that might contribute\nto the support or advantage of his party. But what should I do now\nin the case of a benefactor, that should afterwards become not only\nmine and my country\u2019s enemy, but the common enemy of mankind! I would\nhere distinguish betwixt the wickedness of a man and the cruelty of a\nbeast\u2014betwixt a limited or a particular passion and a sanguinary rage\nthat extends to the hazard and destruction of human society. In the\nformer case I would quit scores, that I might have no more to do with\nhim; but if he comes once to delight in blood, and to act outrages\nwith greediness\u2014to study and invent torments, and to take pleasure in\nthem\u2014the law of reasonable nature has discharged me of such a debt.\nBut this is an impiety so rare that it might pass for a portent, and\nbe reckoned among comets and monsters. Let us therefore restrain our\ndiscourse to such men as we detest without horror; such men as we see\nevery day in courts, camps, and upon the seats of justice; to such\nwicked men I will return what I have received, without making any\nadvantage of their unrighteousness.\nIt does not divert the Almighty from being still gracious, though we\nproceed daily in the abuse of his bounties. How many there are that\nenjoy the comfort of the light that do not deserve it; that wish they\nhad never been born! and yet Nature goes quietly on with her work, and\nallows them a being, even in despite of their unthankfulness. Such\na knave, we cry, was better used than I: and the same complaint we\nextend to Providence itself. How many wicked men have good crops, when\nbetter than themselves have their fruits blasted! Such a man, we say,\nhas treated me very ill. Why, what should we do, but that very thing\nwhich is done by God himself? that is to say, give to the ignorant,\nand persevere to the wicked. All our ingratitude, we see, does not\nturn Providence from pouring down of benefits, even upon those that\nquestion whence they come. The wisdom of Heaven does all things with\na regard to the good of the universe, and the blessings of nature\nare granted in common, to the worst as well as to the best of men;\nfor they live promiscuously together; and it is God\u2019s will, that the\nwicked shall rather fare the better for the good, than that the good\nshall fare the worse for the wicked. It is true that a wise prince\nwill confer peculiar honors only upon the worthy; but in the dealing\nof a public dole, there is no respect had to the manners of the man;\nbut a thief or traitor shall put in for a share as well as an honest\nman. If a good man and a wicked man sail both in the same bottom, it\nis impossible that the same wind which favors the one should cross the\nother. The common benefits of laws, privileges, communities, letters,\nand medicines, are permitted to the bad as well as to the good; and no\nman ever yet suppressed a sovereign remedy for fear a wicked man might\nbe cured with it. Cities are built for both sorts, and the same remedy\nworks upon both alike. In these cases, we are to set an estimate upon\nthe persons: there is a great difference betwixt the choosing of a man\nand the not excluding him: the law is open to the rebellious as well\nas to the obedient: there are some benefits which, if they were not\nallowed to all, could not be enjoyed by any. The sun was never made for\nme, but for the comfort of the world, and for the providential order\nof the seasons; and yet I am not without my private obligation also.\nTo conclude, he that will oblige the wicked and the ungrateful, must\nresolve to oblige nobody; for in some sort or another we are all of us\nwicked, we are all of us ungrateful, every man of us.\nWe have been discoursing all this while how far a wicked man may be\nobliged, and the Stoics tell us at last, that he cannot be obliged\nat all. For they make him incapable of any good, and consequently\nof any benefit. But he has this advantage, that if he cannot be\nobliged, he cannot be ungrateful: for if he cannot receive, he is not\nbound to return. On the other side, a good man and an ungrateful,\nare a contradiction: so that at this rate there is no such thing as\ningratitude in nature. They compare a wicked man\u2019s mind to a vitiated\nstomach; he corrupts whatever he receives, and the best nourishment\nturns to the disease. But taking this for granted, a wicked man may\nyet so far be obliged as to pass for ungrateful, if he does not\nrequite what he receives: for though it be not a perfect benefit, yet\nhe receives something like it. There are goods of the mind, the body,\nand of fortune. Of the first sort, fools and wicked men are wholly\nincapable; to the rest they may be admitted. But why should I call any\nman ungrateful, you will say, for not restoring that which I deny to be\na benefit? I answer, that if the receiver take it for a benefit, and\nfails of a return, it is ingratitude in him: for that which goes for an\nobligation among wicked men, is an obligation upon them: and they may\npay one another in their own coin; the money is current, whether it be\ngold or leather, when it comes once to be authorized. Nay, Cleanthes\ncarries it farther; he that is wanting, says he, to a kind office,\nthough it be no benefit, would have done the same thing if it had been\none; and is as guilty as a thief is, that has set his booty, and is\nalready armed and mounted with a purpose to seize it, though he has\nnot yet drawn blood. Wickedness is formed in the heart; and the matter\nof fact is only the discovery and the execution of it. Now, though a\nwicked man cannot either receive or bestow a benefit, because he wants\nthe will of doing good, and for that he is no longer wicked, when\nvirtue has taken possession of him; yet we commonly call it one, as we\ncall a man illiterate that is not learned, and naked that is not well\nclad; not but that the one can read, and the other is covered.\nCHAPTER XV.\nA GENERAL VIEW OF THE PARTS AND DUTIES OF THE BENEFACTOR.\nThe three main points in the question of benefits are, first, a\n_judicious choice_ in the _object_; secondly, in the _matter_ of our\nbenevolence; and thirdly, a grateful _felicity_ in the _manner_ of\nexpressing it. But there are also incumbent upon the benefactor other\nconsiderations, which will deserve a place in this discourse.\nIt is not enough to do one good turn, and to do it with a good grace\ntoo, unless we follow it with more, and without either upbraiding or\nrepining. It is a common shift, to charge that upon the ingratitude\nof the receiver, which, in truth, is most commonly the levity and\nindiscretion of the giver; for all circumstances must be duly weighed\nto consummate the action. Some there are that we find ungrateful; but\nwhat with our forwardness, change of humor and reproaches, there are\nmore that we make so. And this is the business: we give with design,\nand most to those that are able to give most again. We give to the\ncovetous, and to the ambitious; to those that can never be thankful,\n(for their desires are insatiable,) and to those that _will_ not.\nHe that is a tribune would be pr\u00e6tor; the pr\u00e6tor, a consul; never\nreflecting upon what he _was_, but only looking forward to what he\n_would_ be. People are still computing, _Must I lose this or that\nbenefit_? If it be lost, the fault lies in the ill bestowing of it;\nfor rightly placed, it is as good as consecrated; if we be deceived\nin another, let us not be deceived in ourselves too. A charitable man\nwill mend the matter: and say to himself, _Perhaps he has forgot it,\nperchance he could not, perhaps he will yet requite it_. A patient\ncreditor will, of an ill paymaster, in time make a good one; an\nobstinate goodness overcomes an ill disposition, as a barren soil is\nmade fruitful by care and tillage. But let a man be never so ungrateful\nor inhuman, he shall never destroy the satisfaction of my having done a\ngood office.\nBut what if _others_ will be wicked? does it follow that we must be so\ntoo? If _others_ will be ungrateful, must _we_ therefore be inhuman?\nTo give and to lose, is nothing; but to lose and to give still, is the\npart of a great mind. And the others in effect is the greater loss;\nfor the one does but lose his benefit, and the other loses himself.\nThe light shines upon the profane and sacrilegious as well as upon the\nrighteous. How many disappointments do we meet with in our wives and\nchildren, and yet we couple still? He that has lost one battle hazards\nanother. The mariner puts to sea again after a wreck. An illustrious\nmind does not propose the profit of a good office, but the duty. If the\nworld be wicked, we should yet persevere in well-doing, even among evil\nmen. I had rather never receive a kindness than never bestow one: not\nto return a benefit is the _greater_ sin, but not to _confer_ it is the\n_earlier_. We cannot propose to ourselves a more glorious example than\nthat of the Almighty, who neither needs nor expects anything from us;\nand yet he is continually showering down and distributing his mercies\nand his grace among us, not only for our necessities, but also for\nour delights; as fruits and seasons, rain and sunshine, veins of water\nand of metal; and all this to the wicked as well as to the good, and\nwithout any other end than the common benefit of the receivers. With\nwhat face then can we be mercenary one to another, that have received\nall things from Divine Providence _gratis_? It is a common saying, \u201cI\ngave such or such a man so much money: I would I had thrown it into\nthe sea;\u201d and yet the merchant trades again after a piracy, and the\nbanker ventures afresh after a bad security. He that will do no good\noffices after a disappointment, must stand still, and do just nothing\nat all. The plow goes on after a barren year: and while the ashes\nare yet warm, we raise a new house upon the ruins of a former. What\nobligations can be greater than those which children receive from their\nparents? and yet should we give them over in their infancy, it were all\nto no purpose. Benefits, like grain, must be followed from the seed to\nthe harvest. I will not so much as leave any place for ingratitude. I\nwill pursue, and I will encompass the receiver with benefits; so that\nlet him look which way he will, his benefactor shall be still in his\neye, even when he would avoid his own memory: and then I will remit\nto one man because he calls for it; to another, because he does not;\nto a third, because he is wicked; and to a fourth, because he is the\ncontrary. I will cast away a good turn upon a bad man, and I will\nrequite a good one; the one because it is my duty, and the other that I\nmay not be in debt.\nI do not love to hear any man complain that he has met with a thankless\nman. If he has met but with one, he has either been very fortunate or\nvery careful. And yet care is not sufficient: for there is no way to\nescape the hazard of losing a benefit but the not bestowing of it, and\nto neglect a duty to myself for fear another should abuse it. It is\n_another\u2019s_ fault if he be ungrateful, but it is _mine_ if I do not\ngive. To find one thankful man, I will oblige a great many that are\nnot so. The business of mankind would be at a stand, if we should do\nnothing for fear of miscarriages in matters of certain event. I will\ntry and believe all things, before I give any man over, and do all that\nis possible that I may not lose a good office and a friend together.\nWhat do I know but _he may misunderstand the obligation? business may\nhave put it out of his head, or taken him off from it: he may have\nslipt his opportunity_. I will say, in excuse of human weakness, that\none man\u2019s memory is not sufficient for all things; it is but a limited\ncapacity, so as to hold only so much, and no more: and when it is once\nfull, it must let out part of what it had to take in anything beside;\nand the last benefit ever sits closest to us. In our youth we forget\nthe obligations of our infancy, and when we are men we forget those\nof our youth. If nothing will prevail, let him keep what he has and\nwelcome; but let him have a care of returning evil for good, and making\nit dangerous for a man to do his duty. I would no more give a benefit\nfor such a man, than I would lend money to a beggarly spendthrift; or\ndeposit any in the hands of a known _knight of the post_. However the\ncase stands, an ungrateful person is never the better for a reproach;\nif he be already hardened in his wickedness, he gives no heed to it;\nand if he be not, it turns a doubtful modesty into an incorrigible\nimpudence: beside that, he watches for all ill words to pick a quarrel\nwith them.\nAs the benefactor is not to upbraid a benefit, so neither to delay\nit: the one is tiresome, and the other odious. We must not hold men\nin hand, as physicians and surgeons do their patients, and keep them\nlonger in fear and pain than needs, only to magnify the cure. A\ngenerous man gives easily, and receives as he gives, but never exacts.\nHe rejoices in the return, and judges favorably of it whatever it be,\nand contents himself with bare thanks for a requital. It is a harder\nmatter with some to get the benefit after it is promised than the first\npromise of it, there must be so many friends made in the case. One\nmust be desired to solicit another; and he must be entreated to move\na third; and a fourth must be at last besought to receive it; so that\nthe author, upon the upshot, has the least share in the obligation. It\nis then welcome when it comes free, and without deduction; and no man\neither to intercept or hinder, or to detain it. And let it be of such a\nquality too, that it be not only delightful in the receiving, but after\nit is received; which it will certainly be, if we do but observe this\nrule, never to do any thing for another which we would not honestly\ndesire for ourselves.\nCHAPTER XVI.\nHOW THE RECEIVER OUGHT TO BEHAVE HIMSELF.\nThere are certain rules in common betwixt the giver and the receiver.\nWe must do both cheerfully, that the giver may receive the fruit of\nhis benefit in the very act of bestowing it. It is a just ground of\nsatisfaction to _see_ a friend pleased; but it is much more to _make_\nhim so. The intention of the one is to be suited to the intention\nof the other; and there must be an emulation betwixt them, whether\nshall oblige most. Let the one say, that he has received a benefit,\nand let the other persuade himself that he has not returned it. Let\nthe one say, _I am paid_, and the other, _I am yet in your debt_; let\nthe benefactor acquit the receiver, and the receiver bind himself.\nThe frankness of the discharge heightens the obligation. It is in\n_conversation_ as in a _tennis-court_; benefits are to be tossed like\nballs; the longer the rest, the better are the gamesters. The giver, in\nsome respect, has the odds, because (as in a race) he starts first, and\nthe other must use great diligence to overtake him. The return must be\nlarger than the first obligation to come up to it; and it is a kind of\ningratitude not to render it with interest. In a matter of money, it\nis a common thing to pay a debt out of course, and before it be due;\nbut we account ourselves to owe nothing for a good office; whereas\nthe benefit increases by delay. So insensible are we of the most\nimportant affair of human life! That man were doubtless in a miserable\ncondition, that could neither see, nor hear, nor taste, nor feel, nor\nsmell; but how much more unhappy is he then that, wanting a sense of\nbenefits, loses the greatest comfort in nature in the bliss of giving\nand receiving them? He that takes a benefit as it is meant is in the\nright; for the benefactor has then his end, and his only end, when the\nreceiver is grateful.\nThe more glorious part, in appearance, is that of the giver; but the\nreceiver has undoubtedly the harder game to play in many regards.\nThere are some from whom I would not accept of a benefit; that is to\nsay, from those upon whom I would not bestow one. For why should I not\nscorn to receive a benefit where I am ashamed to own it? and I would\nyet be more tender too, where I receive, than where I give; for it is\nno torment to be in debt where a man has no mind to pay; as it is the\ngreatest delight imaginable to be engaged by a friend, whom I should\nyet have a kindness for; if I were never so much disobliged. It is a\npain to an honest and a generous mind to lie under a duty of affection\nagainst inclination. I do not speak here of wise men, that love to\ndo what they ought to do; that have their passions at command; that\nprescribe laws to themselves, and keep them when they have done; but of\nmen in a state of imperfection, that may have a good will perhaps to\nbe honest, and yet be overborne by the contumacy of their affections.\nWe must therefore have a care to whom we become obliged; and I would\nbe much stricter yet in the choice of a creditor for benefits than for\nmoney. In the one case, it is but paying what I had, and the debt is\ndischarged; in the other, I do not only owe more, but when I have paid\nthat, I am still in arrear: and this law is the very foundation of\nfriendship. I will suppose myself a prisoner; and a notorious villain\noffers to lay down a good sum of money for my redemption. _First_,\nShall I make use of this money or not? _Secondly_, If I do, what return\nshall I make him for it? To the first point, I will take it; but only\nas a debt; not as a benefit, that shall ever tie me to a friendship\nwith him; and, secondly, my acknowledgment shall be only correspondent\nto such an obligation. It is a school question, whether or not Brutus,\nthat thought C\u00e6sar not fit to live, (and put himself at the head of a\nconspiracy against him,) could honestly have received his life from\nC\u00e6sar, if he had fallen into C\u00e6sar\u2019s power, without examining what\nreason moved him to that action? How great a man soever he was in\nother cases, without dispute he was extremely out in this, and below\nthe dignity of his profession. For a Stoic to fear the name of a king,\nwhen yet monarchy is the best state of government; or there to hope for\nliberty, where so great rewards are propounded, both for tyrants and\ntheir slaves; for him to imagine ever to bring the laws to their former\nstate, where so many thousand lives had been lost in the contest, not\nso much whether they should serve or not, but who should be their\nmaster: he was strangely mistaken, in the nature and reason of things,\nto fancy, that when Julius was gone, somebody else would not start up\nin his place, when there was yet a Tarquin found, after so many kings\nthat were destroyed, either by sword or thunder: and yet the resolution\nis, that he might have received it, but not as a benefit; for at that\nrate I owe my life to every man that does not take it away.\nGr\u00e6cinus Julius (whom Caligula put to death out of a pure malice to his\nvirtue) had a considerable sum of money sent him from Fabius Persicus\n(a man of great and infamous example) as a contribution towards the\nexpense of plays and other public entertainments; but Julius would\nnot receive it; and some of his friends that had an eye more upon the\npresent than the presenter, asked him, with some freedom, what he meant\nby refusing it? \u201cWhy,\u201d says he, \u201cdo you think that I will take money\nwhere I would not take so much as a glass of wine?\u201d After this Rebilus\n(a man of the same stamp) sent him a greater sum upon the same score.\n\u201cYou must excuse me,\u201d says he to the messenger, \u201cfor I would not take\nany thing of Persicus neither.\u201d\nTo match this scruple of receiving money with another of keeping it;\nand the sum not above three pence, or a groat at most. There was a\ncertain Pythagorean that contracted with a cobbler for a pair of shoes,\nand some three or four days after, going to pay him his money, the\nshop was shut up; and when he had knocked a great while at the door,\n\u201cFriend,\u201d says a fellow, \u201cyou may hammer your heart out there, for the\nman that you look for is dead. And when our friends are dead, we hear\nno more news of them; but yours, that are to live again, will shift\nwell enough,\u201d (alluding to Pythagora\u2019s transmigration). Upon this the\nphilosopher went away, with his money chinking in his hand, and well\nenough content to save it: at last, his conscience took check at it;\nand, upon reflection, \u201cThough the man be dead,\u201d says he, \u201cto others, he\nis alive to thee; pay him what thou owest him:\u201d and so he went back\npresently, and thrust it into his shop through the chink of the door.\nWhatever we owe, it is our part to find where to pay it, and to do it\nwithout asking too; for whether the creditor be good or bad, the debt\nis still the same.\nIf a benefit be forced upon me, as from a tyrant, or a superior, where\nit may be dangerous to refuse, this is rather obeying than receiving,\nwhere the necessity destroys the choice. The way to know what I have a\nmind to do, is to leave me at liberty whether I will do it or not; but\nit is yet a benefit, if a man does me good in spite of my teeth; as it\nis none, if I do any man good against my will. A man may both hate and\nyet receive a benefit at the same time; the money is never the worse,\nbecause a fool that is not read in coins refuses to take it. If the\nthing be good for the receiver, and so intended, no matter how ill it\nis taken. Nay, the receiver may be obliged, and not know it; but there\ncan be no benefit which is unknown to the giver. Neither will I, upon\nany terms, receive a benefit from a worthy person that may do him a\nmischief: it is the part of an enemy to save himself by doing another\nman harm.\nBut whatever we do, let us be sure always to keep a grateful mind.\nIt is not enough to say, what requital shall a poor man offer to a\nprince; or a slave to his patron; when it is the glory of gratitude\nthat it depends only upon the good will? Suppose a man defends my\nfame; delivers me from beggary; saves my life; or gives me liberty,\nthat is more than life; how shall I be grateful to that man? I will\nreceive, cherish, and rejoice in the benefit. Take it kindly, and\nit is requited: not that the debt itself is discharged, but it is\nnevertheless a discharge of the conscience. I will yet distinguish\nbetwixt the debtor that becomes insolvent by expenses upon whores and\ndice, and another that is undone by fire or thieves; nor do I take this\ngratitude for a payment, but there is no danger, I presume, of being\narrested for such a debt.\nIn the return of benefits let us be ready and cheerful but not\npressing. There is as much greatness of mind in the owing of a good\nturn as in doing of it; and we must no more force a requital out of\nseason than be wanting in it. He that precipitates a return, does\nas good as say, \u201cI am weary of being in this man\u2019s debt:\u201d not but\nthat the hastening of a requital, as a good office, is a commendable\ndisposition, but it is another thing to do it as a discharge; for it\nlooks like casting off a heavy and a troublesome burden. It is for the\nbenefactor to say _when_ he will receive it; no matter for the opinion\nof the world, so long as I gratify my own conscience; for I cannot be\nmistaken in myself, but another may. He that is over solicitous to\nreturn a benefit, thinks the other so likewise to receive it. If he had\nrather we should keep it, why should we refuse, and presume to dispose\nof his treasure, who may call it in, or let it lie out, at his choice?\nIt is as much a fault to receive what I ought not, as not to give what\nI ought; for the giver has the privilege of choosing his own time of\nreceiving.\nSome are too proud in the conferring of benefits; others, in the\nreceiving of them; which is, to say the truth, intolerable. The same\nrule serves both sides, as in the case of a father and a son; a husband\nand a wife; one friend or acquaintance and another, where the duties\nare known and common. There are some that will not receive a benefit\nbut in private, nor thank you for it but in your ear, or in a corner;\nthere must be nothing under hand and seal, no brokers, notaries, or\nwitnesses, in the case: that is not so much a scruple of modesty as a\nkind of denying the obligation, and only a less hardened ingratitude.\nSome receive benefits so coldly and indifferently, that a man would\nthink the obligation lay on the other side: as who should say, \u201cWell,\nsince you will needs have it so, I am content to take it.\u201d Some again\nso carelessly, as if they hardly knew of any such thing, whereas we\nshould rather aggravate the matter: \u201cYou cannot imagine how many\nyou have obliged in this act: there never was so great, so kind, so\nseasonable a courtesy.\u201d Furnius never gained so much upon Augustus as\nby a speech, upon the getting of his father\u2019s pardon for siding with\nAntony: \u201cThis grace,\u201d says he, \u201cis the only injury that ever C\u00e6sar did\nme: for it has put me upon a necessity of living and dying ungrateful.\u201d\nIt is safer to affront some people than to oblige them; for the better\na man deserves, the worse they will speak of him: as if the possessing\nof open hatred to their benefactors were an argument that they lie\nunder no obligation. Some people are so sour and ill-natured, that they\ntake it for an affront to have an obligation or a return offered them,\nto the discouragement both of bounty and gratitude together. The not\ndoing, and the not receiving, of benefits, are equally a mistake. He\nthat refuses a new one, seems to be offended at an old one: and yet\nsometimes I would neither return a benefit, no, nor so much as receive\nit, if I might.\nCHAPTER XVII.\nOF GRATITUDE.\nHe that preaches gratitude, pleads the cause both of God and man; for\nwithout it we can neither be sociable nor religious. There is a strange\ndelight in the very purpose and contemplation of it, as well as in the\naction; when I can say to myself, \u201cI love my benefactor; what is there\nin this world that I would not do to oblige and serve him?\u201d Where I\nhave not the _means_ of a requital, the very _meditation_ of it is\nsufficient. A man is nevertheless an artist for not having his tools\nabout him; or a musician, because he wants his fiddle: nor is he the\nless brave because his hands are bound; or the worse pilot for being\nupon dry ground. If I have only _will_ to be grateful, I _am_ so. Let\nme be upon the wheel, or under the hand of the executioner; let me be\nburnt limb by limb, and my whole body dropping in the flames, a good\nconscience supports me in all extremes; nay, it is comfortable even\nin death itself; for when we come to approach that point, what care\ndo we take to summon and call to mind all our benefactors, and the\ngood offices they have done us, that we leave the world fair, and set\nour minds in order? Without gratitude, we can neither have security,\npeace, nor reputation: and it is not therefore the less desirable,\nbecause it draws many adventitious benefits along with it. Suppose the\nsun, the moon, and the stars, had no other business than only to pass\nover our heads, without any effect upon our minds or bodies; without\nany regard to our health, fruits, or seasons; a man could hardly lift\nup his eyes towards the heavens without wonder and veneration, to\nsee so many millions of radiant lights, and to observe their courses\nand revolutions, even without any respect to the common good of the\nuniverse. But when we come to consider that Providence and Nature are\nstill at work when we sleep, with the admirable force and operation\nof their influences and motions, we cannot then but acknowledge their\nornament to be the least part of their value; and that they are more\nto be esteemed for their virtues than for their splendor. Their main\nend and use is matter of life and necessity, though they may seem to\nus more considerable for their majesty and beauty. And so it is with\ngratitude; we love it rather for secondary ends, than for itself.\nNo man can be grateful without contemning those things that put the\ncommon people out of their wits. We must go into banishment; lay\ndown our lives; beggar and expose ourselves to reproaches; nay, it\nis often seen, that loyalty suffers the punishment due to rebellion,\nand that treason receives the rewards of fidelity. As the benefits\nof it are many and great, so are the hazards; which is the case more\nor less of all other virtues: and it were hard, if this, above the\nrest, should be both painful and fruitless: so that though we may go\ncurrently on with it in a smooth way, we must yet prepare and resolve\n(if need be) to force our passage to it, even if the way were covered\nwith thorns and serpents; and _fall back_, _fall edge_, we must be\ngrateful still: grateful for the virtue\u2019s sake, and grateful over and\nabove upon the point of interest; for it preserves old friends, and\ngains new ones. It is not our business to fish for one benefit with\nanother; and by bestowing a little to get more; or to oblige for any\nsort of expedience, but because I ought to do it, and because I love\nit, and that to such a degree, that if I could not be grateful without\nappearing the contrary, if I could not return a benefit without being\nsuspected of doing an injury; in despite of infamy itself, I would\nyet be grateful. No man is greater in my esteem than he that ventures\nthe fame to preserve the conscience of an honest man; the one is but\nimaginary, the other solid and inestimable. I cannot call him grateful,\nwho in the instant of returning one benefit has his eye upon another.\nHe that is grateful for profit or fear, is like a woman that is honest\nonly upon the score of reputation.\nAs gratitude is a necessary and a glorious, so it is also an obvious, a\ncheap, and an easy virtue; so obvious, that wheresoever there is a life\nthere is a place for it\u2014so cheap that the covetous man may be grateful\nwithout expense\u2014and so easy that the sluggard may be so, likewise,\nwithout labor. And yet it is not without its niceties too; for there\nmay be a time, a place or occasion wherein I ought not to return a\nbenefit; nay, wherein I may better disown it than deliver it.\nLet it be understood, by the way, that it is one thing to be grateful\nfor a good office, and another thing to return it\u2014the good will is\nenough in one case, being as much as the one side demands and the other\npromises; but the effect is requisite in the other. The physician that\nhas done his best is acquitted though the patient dies, and so is the\nadvocate, though the client may lose his cause. The general of an\narmy, though the battle be lost, is yet worthy of commendation, if he\nhas discharged all the parts of a prudent commander; in this case, the\none acquits himself, though the other be never the better for it. He\nis a grateful man that is always willing and ready: and he that seeks\nfor all means and occasions of requiting a benefit, though without\nattaining his end, does a great deal more than the man that, without\nany trouble, makes an immediate return. Suppose my friend a prisoner,\nand that I have sold my estate for his ransom; I put to sea in foul\nweather, and upon a coast that is pestered with pirates; my friend\nhappens to be redeemed before I come to the place; my gratitude is as\nmuch to be esteemed as if he had been a prisoner; and if I had been\ntaken and robbed myself, it would still have been the same case. Nay,\nthere is a gratitude in the very countenance; for an honest man bears\nhis conscience in his face, and propounds the requital of a good turn\nin the very moment of receiving it; he is cheerful and confident; and,\nin the possession of a true friendship, delivered from all anxiety.\nThere is this difference betwixt a thankful man and an unthankful, the\none is _always_ pleased in the good he has _done_, and the other only\n_once_ in what he has _received_. There must be a benignity in the\nestimation even of the smallest offices; and such a modesty as appears\nto be obliged in whatsoever it gives. As it is indeed a very great\nbenefit, the opportunity of doing a good office to a worthy man. He\nthat attends to the present, and remembers what is past, shall never be\nungrateful. But who shall judge in the case? for a man may be grateful\nwithout making a return, and ungrateful with it. Our best way is to\nhelp every thing by a fair interpretation; and wheresoever there is\na doubt, to allow it the most favorable construction; for he that is\nexceptious at words, or looks, has a mind to pick a quarrel. For my\nown part, when I come to cast up my account, and know what I owe, and\nto whom, though I make my return sooner to some, and later to others,\nas occasion or fortune will give me leave, yet I will be just to all:\nI will be grateful to God, to man, to those that have obliged me: nay,\neven to those that have obliged my friends. I am bound in honor and in\nconscience to be thankful for what I have received; and if it be not\nyet full, it is some pleasure still that I may hope for more. For the\nrequital of a favor there must be virtue, occasion, means, and fortune.\nIt is a common thing to screw up justice to the pitch of an injury. A\nman may be _over-righteous_; and why not _over-grateful_ too? There is\na mischievous excess, that borders so close upon ingratitude, that it\nis no easy matter to distinguish the one from the other: but, in regard\nthat there is good-will in the bottom of it, (however distempered, for\nit is effectually but kindness out of the wits,) we shall discourse it\nunder the title of _Gratitude mistaken_.\nCHAPTER XVIII.\nGRATITUDE MISTAKEN.\nTo refuse a good office, not so much because we do not need it, as\nbecause we would not be indebted for it, is a kind of fantastical\ningratitude, and somewhat akin to that nicety of humor, on the other\nside, of being over-grateful; only it lies another way, and seems to be\nthe more pardonable ingratitude of the two. Some people take it for a\ngreat instance of their good-will to be wishing their benefactors such\nor such a mischief; only, forsooth, that they themselves may be the\nhappy instruments of their release.\nThese men do like extravagant lovers, that take it for a great proof of\ntheir affection to wish one another banished, beggared, or diseased,\nthat they might have the opportunity of interposing to their relief.\nWhat difference is there betwixt such wishing and cursing? such an\naffection and a mortal hatred? The intent is good, you will say, but\nthis is a misapplication of it. Let such a one fall into my power, or\ninto the hands of his enemies, his creditors, or the common people, and\nno mortal be able to rescue him but myself: let his life, his liberty,\nand his reputation, lie all at stake, and no creature but myself in\ncondition to succor him; and why all this, but because he has obliged\nme, and I would requite him? If this be gratitude to propound jails,\nshackles, slavery, war, beggary, to the man that you would requite,\nwhat would you do where you are ungrateful? This way of proceeding,\nover and above that it is impious in itself, is likewise over-hasty and\nunseasonable: for he that goes too fast is as much to blame as he that\ndoes not move at all, (to say nothing of the injustice,) for if I had\nnever been obliged, I should never have wished it.\nThere are seasons wherein a benefit is neither to be received nor\nrequited. To press a return upon me when I do not desire it, is\nunmannerly; but it is worse to force me to desire it. How rigorous\nwould he be to exact a requital; who is thus eager to return it! To\nwish a man in distress that I may relieve him, is first to wish him\nmiserable: to wish that he may stand in need of anybody, is _against\nhim_; and to wish that he may stand in need of me, is _for myself_:\nso that my business is not so much a charity to my friend as the\ncancelling of a bond; nay, it is half-way the wish of an enemy. It is\nbarbarous to wish a man in chains, slavery, or want, only to bring\nhim out again: let me rather wish him powerful and happy, and myself\nindebted to him! By nature we are prone to mercy, humanity compassion;\nmay we be excited to be more so by the number of the grateful! may\ntheir number increase, and may we have no need of trying them!\nIt is not for an honest man to make way to a good office by a crime: as\nif a pilot should pray for a tempest, that he might prove his skill:\nor a general wish his army routed, that he may show himself a great\ncommander in recovering the day. It is throwing a man into a river to\ntake him out again. It is an obligation, I confess, to cure a wound or\na disease; but to _make_ that wound or disease on purpose to _cure_ it,\nis a most perverse ingratitude. It is barbarous even to an enemy, much\nmore to a friend; for it is not so much to do him a kindness, as to put\nhim in need of it. Of the two, let me rather be a scar than a wound;\nand yet it would be better to have it neither. Rome had been little\nbeholden to Scipio if he had prolonged the Punic war that he might\nhave the finishing of it at last, or to the Decii for dying for their\ncountry, if they had first brought it to the last extremity of needing\ntheir devotion. It may be a good contemplation, but it is a lewd wish.\n\u00c6neas had never been surnamed _the Pious_, if he had wished the ruin\nof his country, only that he might have the honor of taking his father\nout of the fire. It is the scandal of a physician to make work, and\nirritate a disease, and to torment his patient, for the reputation of\nhis cure. If a man should openly imprecate poverty, captivity, fear,\nor danger, upon a person that he has been obliged to, would not the\nwhole world condemn him for it? And what is the difference, but the one\nis only a private wish, and the other a public declaration? Rutilius\nwas told in his exile, that, for his comfort, there would be ere-long\na civil war, that would bring all the banished men home again. \u201cGod\nforbid,\u201d says he, \u201cfor I had rather my country should blush for my\nbanishment than mourn for my return.\u201d How much more honorable it is to\nowe cheerfully, than to pay dishonestly? It is the wish of an enemy\nto take a town that he may preserve it, and to be victorious that he\nmay forgive; but the mercy comes after the cruelty; beside that it is\nan injury both to God and man; for the man must be first afflicted by\n_Heaven_ to be relieved by _me_. So that we impose the cruelty upon\nGod, and take the compassion to ourselves; and at the best, it is but\na curse that makes way for a blessing; the bare wish is an injury; and\nif it does not take effect, it is because Heaven has not heard our\nprayers; or if they should succeed, the fear itself is a torment; and\nit is much more desirable to have a firm and unshaken security. It is\nfriendly to wish it in your power to oblige me, if ever I chance to\nneed it; but it is unkind to wish me miserable that I may need it. How\nmuch more pious is it, and humane, to wish that I may never want the\noccasion of obliging, nor the means of doing it; nor ever have reason\nto repent of what I have done?\nCHAPTER XIX.\nOF INGRATITUDE.\nIngratitude is of all the crimes, that which we are to account the\nmost venial in others, and the most unpardonable in ourselves. It\nis impious to the highest degree; for it makes us fight against our\nchildren and our altars. There are, there ever were, and there ever\nwill be criminals of all sorts, as murderers, tyrants, thieves,\nadulterers, traitors, robbers and sacrilegious persons; but there\nis hardly any notorious crime without a mixture of ingratitude. It\ndisunites mankind, and breaks the very pillars of society; and yet so\nfar is this prodigious wickedness from being any wonder to us, that\neven thankfulness itself were much the greater of the two; for men\nare deterred from it by labor, expense, laziness, business; or else\ndiverted from it by lust, envy, ambition, pride, levity, rashness,\nfear; nay, by the very shame of confessing what they have received. And\nthe unthankful man has nothing to say for himself all this while, for\nthere needs neither pains or fortune for the discharge of his duty,\nbeside the inward anxiety and torment when a man\u2019s conscience makes him\nafraid of his own thoughts.\nTo speak against the ungrateful is to rail against mankind, for even\nthose that complain are guilty: nor do I speak only of those that\ndo not live up to the strict rule of virtue; but mankind itself is\ndegenerated and lost. We live unthankfully in this world, and we go\nstruggling and murmuring out of it, dissatisfied with our lot, whereas\nwe should be grateful for the blessings we have enjoyed, and account\nthat sufficient which Providence has provided for us; a little more\ntime may make our lives longer but not happier, and whensoever it is\nthe pleasure of God to call us, we must obey; and yet all this while\nwe go on quarreling at the world for what we find in ourselves, and\nwe are yet more unthankful to Heaven than we are to one another. What\nbenefit can be great now to that man that despises the bounties of his\nMaker? We would be as strong as elephants, as swift as bucks, as light\nas birds\u2014and we complain that we have not the sagacity of dogs, the\nsight of eagles, the long life of ravens\u2014nay, that we are not immortal,\nand endued with the knowledge of things to come: nay, we take it ill\nthat we are not gods upon earth, never considering the advantages\nof our condition, or the benignity of Providence in the comforts\nthat we enjoy. We subdue the strongest of creatures and overtake the\nfleetest\u2014we reclaim the fiercest and outwit the craftiest. We are\nwithin one degree of heaven itself, and yet we are not satisfied.\nSince there is not any one creature which we had rather be, we take it\nill that we cannot draw the united excellencies of all other creatures\ninto ourselves. Why are we not rather thankful to that goodness which\nhas subjected the whole creation to our use and service?\nThe principal causes of ingratitude are pride and self-conceit,\navarice, envy, etc. It is a familiar exclamation, \u201cIt is true he did\nthis or that for me, but it came so late, and it was so little, I had\neven as good have been without it\u2014if he had not given it to me, he must\nhave given it to somebody else\u2014it was nothing out of his pocket.\u201d Nay,\nwe are so ungrateful, that he that gives us all we have, if he leaves\nany thing to himself, we reckon that he does us an injury.\nIt cost Julius C\u00e6sar his life by the disappointment of his insatiable\ncompanions; and yet he reserved nothing of all that he got to himself\nbut the liberty of disposing of it. There is no benefit so large\nbut malignity will still lessen it; none so narrow, which a good\ninterpretation will not enlarge. No man shall ever be grateful that\nviews a benefit on the wrong side, or takes a good office by the wrong\nhandle. The avaricious man is naturally ungrateful, for he never thinks\nhe has enough, but, without considering what he has, only minds what\nhe covets. Some pretend want of power to make a competent return, and\nyou shall find in others a kind of graceless modesty, that makes a man\nashamed of requiting an obligation, because it is a confession that he\nhas received one.\nNot to return one good office for another is inhuman; but to return\nevil for good is diabolical. There are too many even of this sort, who,\nthe more they owe, the more they hate. There is nothing more dangerous\nthan to oblige those people; for when they are conscious of not paying\nthe debt, they wish the creditor out of the way. It is a mortal hatred,\nthat which arises from the shame of an abused benefit. When we are on\nthe asking side, what a deal of cringing there is, and profession!\n\u201cWell, I shall never forget this favor, it will be an eternal\nobligation to me.\u201d But within a while the note is changed, and we\nhear no more words of it, until, by little and little, it is all quite\nforgotten. So long as we stand in need of a benefit, there is nothing\ndearer to us; nor anything cheaper, when we have received it. And yet\na man may as well refuse to deliver up a sum of money that is left him\nin trust without a suit, as not to return a good office without asking;\nand when we have no value any farther for the benefit, we do commonly\ncare as little for the author. People follow their interest: one man\nis grateful for his convenience, and another man is ungrateful for the\nsame reason.\nSome are ungrateful to their own country, and their country no less\nungrateful to others; so that the complaint of ingratitude reaches\nall men. Doth not the son wish for the death of his father, the\nhusband for that of his wife, etc. But who can look for gratitude\nin an age of so many gaping and craving appetites, where all people\ntake, and none give? In an age of license to all sorts of vanity\nand wickedness, as lust, gluttony, avarice, envy, ambition, sloth,\ninsolence, levity, contumacy, fear, rashness, private discords and\npublic evils, extravagant and groundless wishes, vain confidences,\nsickly affections, shameless impieties, rapine authorized, and the\nviolation of all things, sacred and profane: obligations are pursued\nwith sword and poison; benefits are turned into crimes, and that blood\nmost seditiously spilt for which every honest man should expose his\nown. Those that should be the preservers of their country are the\ndestroyers of it; and it is a matter of dignity to trample upon the\ngovernment: the sword gives the law, and mercenaries take up arms\nagainst their masters. Among these turbulent and unruly motions, what\nhope is there of finding honesty or good faith, which is the quietest\nof all virtues? There is no more lively image of human life than that\nof a conquered city; there is neither mercy, modesty, nor religion;\nand if we forget our lives, we may well forget our benefits. The\nworld abounds with examples of ungrateful persons, and no less with\nthose of ungrateful governments. Was not Catiline ungrateful? whose\nmalice aimed, not only at the mastering of his country, but at the\ntotal destruction of it, by calling in an inveterate and vindictive\nenemy from beyond the Alps, to wreak their long-thirsted-for revenge,\nand to sacrifice the lives of as many noble Romans as might serve\nto answer and appease the ghosts of the slaughtered Gauls? Was not\nMarius ungrateful, that, from a common soldier, being raised up to a\nconsul, not only gave the world for civil bloodshed and massacres, but\nwas himself the sign of the execution; and every man he met in the\nstreets, to whom he did not stretch out his right hand, was murdered?\nAnd was not Sylla ungrateful too? that when he had waded up to the\ngates in human blood, carried the outrage into the city, and there most\nbarbarously cut two entire legions to pieces in a corner, not only\nafter the victory, but most perfidiously after quarter given them?\nGood God! that ever any man should not only escape with impunity, but\nreceive a reward for so horrid a villainy! Was not Pompey ungrateful\ntoo? who, after three consulships, three triumphs, and so many honors,\nusurped before his time, split the commonwealth into three parts,\nand brought it to such a pass, that there was no hope of safety but\nby slavery only; forsooth, to abate the envy of his power, he took\nother partners with him into the government, as if that which was not\nlawful for any one might have been allowable for more; dividing and\ndistributing the provinces, and breaking all into a _triumvirate_,\nreserving still two parts of the three in his own family. And was not\nC\u00e6sar ungrateful also, though to give him his due, he was a man of his\nword; merciful in his victories, and never killed any man but with his\nsword in his hand? Let us therefore forgive one another. Only one word\nmore now for the shame of ungrateful Governments. Was not Camillus\nbanished? Scipio dismissed? and Cicero exiled and plundered? But, what\nis all this to those who are so mad, and to dispute even the goodness\nof Heaven, which gives us all, and expects nothing again, but continues\ngiving to the most unthankful and complaining?\nCHAPTER XX.\nTHERE CAN BE NO LAW AGAINST INGRATITUDE.\nIngratitude is so dangerous to itself, and so detestable to other\npeople, that nature, one would think, had sufficiently provided against\nit, without need of any other law. For every ungrateful man is his\nown enemy, and it seems superfluous to compel a man to be kind to\nhimself, and to follow in his own inclinations. This, of all wickedness\nimaginable, is certainly the vice which does the most divide and\ndistract human nature. Without the exercise and the commerce of mutual\noffices, we can be neither happy nor safe for it is only society that\nsecures us: take us one by one, and we are a prey even to brutes as\nwell as to one another.\nNature has brought us into the world naked and unarmed; we have not\nthe teeth or the paws of lions or bears to make ourselves terrible;\nbut by the two blessings of reason and union, we secure and defend\nourselves against violence and fortune. This it is that makes man the\nmaster of all other creatures, who otherwise were scarce a match for\nthe weakest of them. This it is that comforts us in sickness, in age,\nin misery, in pains, and in the worst of calamities. Take away this\ncombination, and mankind is dissociated, and falls to pieces. It is\ntrue, that there is no law established against this abominable vice;\nbut we cannot say yet that it escapes unpunished, for a public hatred\nis certainly the greatest of all penalties; over and above that we lose\nthe most valuable blessings of life, in the not bestowing and receiving\nof benefits. If ingratitude were to be punished by a law, it would\ndiscredit the obligation; for a benefit to be given, not lent: and if\nwe have no return at all, there is no just cause of complaint: for\ngratitude were no virtue, if there were any danger in being ungrateful.\nThere are halters, I know, hooks and gibbets, provided for homicide\npoison, sacrilege, and rebellion; but ingratitude (here upon earth) is\nonly punished in the schools; all farther pains and inflictions being\nwholly remitted to divine justice. And, if a man may judge of the\nconscience by the countenance the ungrateful man is never without a\ncanker at his heart; his mind an aspect is sad and solicitous; whereas\nthe other is always cheerful and serene.\nAs there are no laws extant against ingratitude, so is it utterly\nimpossible to contrive any, that in all circumstances shall reach it.\nIf it were actionable, there would not be courts enough in the whole\nworld to try the causes in. There can be no setting a day for the\nrequiting of benefits as for the payment of money, nor any estimate\nupon the benefits themselves; but the whole matter rests in the\nconscience of both parties: and then there are so many degrees of it,\nthat the same rule will never serve all. Beside that, to proportion\nit as the benefit is greater or less, will be both impracticable and\nwithout reason. One good turn saves my life; another, my freedom, or\nperadventure my very soul. How shall any law now suit a punishment to\nan ingratitude under these differing degrees? It must not be said in\nbenefits as in bonds, _Pay what you owe_. How shall a man pay life,\nhealth, credit, security, in _kind_? There can be no set rule to bound\nthat infinite variety of cases, which are more properly the subject of\nhumanity and religion than of law and public justice. There would be\ndisputes also about the benefit itself, which must totally depend upon\nthe courtesy of the judge; for no law imaginable can set it forth. One\nman _gives_ me an estate; another only _lends_ me a sword, and that\nsword preserves my life. Nay, the very same thing, several ways done,\nchanges the quality of the obligation. A word, a tone, a look, makes a\ngreat alteration in the case. How shall we judge then, and determine\na matter which does not depend upon the fact itself, but upon the\nforce and intention of it? Some things are reputed benefits, not for\ntheir value, but because we desire them: and there are offices of as\nmuch greater value, that we do not reckon upon at all. If ingratitude\nwere liable to a law, we must never give but before witnesses, which\nwould overthrow the dignity of the benefit: and then the punishment\nmust either be equal where the crimes are unequal, or else it must be\nunrighteous, so that blood must answer for blood. He that is ungrateful\nfor my saving his life must forfeit his own. And what can be more\ninhuman than that benefits should conclude in sanguinary events? A\nman saves my life, and I am ungrateful for it. Shall I be punished\nin my purse? that is too little; if it be less than the benefit, it\nis unjust, and it must be capital to be made equal to it. There are,\nmoreover, certain privileges granted to parents, that can never be\nreduced to a common rule. Their injuries may be cognizable, but not\ntheir benefits. The diversity of cases is too large and intricate to\nbe brought within the prospect of a law: so that it is much more\nequitable to punish none than to punish all alike. What if a man\nfollows a good office with an injury; whether or no shall this quit\nscores? or who shall compare them, and weigh the one against the other?\nThere is another thing yet which perhaps we do not dream of: not one\nman upon the face of the earth would escape, and yet every man would\nexpect to be his judge. Once again, we are all of us ungrateful; and\nthe number does not only take away the shame, but gives authority and\nprotection to the wickedness.\nIt is thought reasonable by some, that there should be a law against\ningratitude; for, say they, it is common for one city to upbraid\nanother, and to claim that of posterity which was bestowed upon their\nancestors; but this is only clamor without reason. It is objected by\nothers, as a discouragement to good offices, if men shall not be made\nanswerable for them; but I say, on the other side, that no man would\naccept of a benefit upon those terms. He that gives is prompted to it\nby a goodness of mind, and the generosity of the action is lessened\nby the caution: for it is his desire that the receiver should please\nhimself, and owe no more than he thinks fit. But what if this might\noccasion fewer benefits, so long as they would be franker? nor is there\nany hurt in putting a check upon rashness and profusion. In answer to\nthis; men will be careful enough when they oblige without a law: nor is\nit possible for a judge ever to set us right in it; or indeed, anything\nelse, but the faith of the receiver. The honor of a benefit is this way\npreserved, which is otherwise profaned, when it comes to the mercenary,\nand made matter of contention. We are even forward enough of ourselves\nto wrangle, without necessary provocations. It would be well, I think,\nif moneys might pass upon the same conditions with other benefits, and\nthe payment remitted to the conscience, without formalizing upon bills\nand securities: but human wisdom has rather advised with convenience\nthan virtue; and chosen rather to _force_ honesty than _expect_ it. For\nevery paltry sum of money there must be bonds, witnesses, counterparts,\npowers, etc., which is no other than a shameful confession of fraud and\nwickedness, when more credit is given to our seals than to our minds;\nand caution taken lest he that has received the money should deny it.\nWere it not better now to be deceived by some than to suspect all? what\nis the difference, at this rate, betwixt the benefactor and the usurer,\nsave only that in the benefactor\u2019s case there is nobody stands bound?\nSENECA OF A HAPPY LIFE.\nCHAPTER I.\nOF A HAPPY LIFE, AND WHEREIN IT CONSISTS.\nThere is not any thing in this world, perhaps, that is more talked\nof, and less understood, than the business of a _happy life_. It is\nevery man\u2019s wish and design; and yet not one of a thousand that knows\nwherein that happiness consists. We live, however, in a blind and eager\npursuit of it; and the more haste we make in a wrong way, the further\nwe are from our journey\u2019s end. Let us therefore, _first_, consider\n\u201cwhat it is we should be at;\u201d and, _secondly_, \u201cwhich is the readiest\nway to compass it.\u201d If we be right, we shall find every day how much\nwe improve; but if we either follow the cry, or the track, of people\nthat are out of the way, we must expect to be misled, and to continue\nour days in wandering in error. Wherefore, it highly concerns us to\ntake along with us a skilful guide; for it is not in this, as in other\nvoyages, where the highway brings us to our place of repose; or if\na man should happen to be out, where the inhabitants might set him\nright again: but on the contrary, the beaten road is here the most\ndangerous, and the people, instead of helping us, misguide us. Let\nus not therefore follow, like beasts, but rather govern ourselves by\n_reason_, than by _example_. It fares with us in human life as in a\nrouted army; one stumbles first, and then another falls upon him, and\nso they follow, one upon the neck of another, until the whole field\ncomes to be but one heap of miscarriages. And the mischief is, \u201cthat\nthe number of the multitude carries it against truth and justice;\u201d so\nthat we must leave the crowd, if we would be happy: for the question\nof a _happy life_ is not to be decided by vote: nay, so far from it,\nthat plurality of voices is still an argument of the wrong; the common\npeople find it easier to believe than to judge, and content themselves\nwith what is usual, never examining whether it be good or not. By the\n_common people_ is intended _the man of title_ as well as the _clouted\nshoe_: for I do not distinguish them by the eye, but by the mind, which\nis the proper judge of the man. Worldly felicity, I know, makes the\nhead giddy; but if ever a man comes to himself again, he will confess,\nthat \u201cwhatsoever he has done, he wishes undone;\u201d and that \u201cthe things\nhe feared were better than those he prayed for.\u201d\nThe true felicity of life is to be free from perturbations, to\nunderstand our duties towards God and man: to enjoy the present without\nany anxious dependence upon the future. Not to amuse ourselves with\neither hopes or fears, but to rest satisfied with what we have, which\nis abundantly sufficient; for he that is so, wants nothing. The great\nblessings of mankind are within us, and within our reach; but we shut\nour eyes, and, like people in the dark, we fall foul upon the very\nthing which we search for without finding it. \u201cTranquillity is a\ncertain equality of mind, which no condition of fortune can either\nexalt or depress.\u201d Nothing can make it less: for it is the state of\nhuman perfection: it raises us as high as we can go; and makes every\nman his own supporter; whereas he that is borne up by any thing else\nmay fall. He that judges aright, and perseveres in it, enjoys a\nperpetual calm: he takes a true prospect of things; he observes an\norder, measure, a decorum in all his actions; he has a benevolence\nin his nature; he squares his life according to reason; and draws to\nhimself love and admiration. Without a certain and an unchangeable\njudgment, all the rest is but fluctuation: but \u201che that always wills\nand nills the same thing, is undoubtedly in the right.\u201d Liberty and\nserenity of mind must necessarily ensue upon the mastering of those\nthings which either allure or affright us; when instead of those flashy\npleasures, (which even at the best are both vain and hurtful together,)\nwe shall find ourselves possessed of joy transporting and everlasting.\nIt must be a _sound mind_ that makes a _happy man_; there must be a\nconstancy in all conditions, a care for the things of this world, but\nwithout trouble; and such an indifferency for the bounties of fortune,\nthat either with them, or without them, we may live contentedly. There\nmust be neither lamentation, nor quarrelling, nor sloth, nor fear;\nfor it makes a discord in a man\u2019s life. \u201cHe that fears, serves.\u201d The\njoy of a wise man stands firm without interruption; in all places,\nat all times, and in all conditions, his thoughts are cheerful and\nquiet. As it never _came in_ to him from _without_, so it will never\nleave him; but it is born within him, and inseparable from him. It\nis a solicitous life that is egged on with the hope of any thing,\nthough never so open and easy, nay, though a man should never suffer\nany sort of disappointment. I do not speak this either as a bar to the\nfair enjoyment of lawful pleasures, or to the gentle flatteries of\nreasonable expectations: but, on the contrary, I would have men to be\nalways in good humor, provided that it arises from their own souls,\nand be cherished in their own breasts. Other delights are trivial;\nthey may smooth the brow, but they do not fill and affect the heart.\n\u201cTrue joy is a serene and sober motion;\u201d and they are miserably out\nthat take _laughing_ for _rejoicing_. The seat of it is within, and\nthere is no cheerfulness like the resolution of a brave mind, that\nhas fortune under his feet. He that can look death in the face, and\nbid it welcome; open his door to poverty, and bridle his appetites;\nthis is the man whom Providence has established in the possession of\ninviolable delights. The pleasures of the vulgar are ungrounded, thin,\nand superficial; but the others are solid and _eternal_. As the _body_\nitself is rather a _necessary thing_, than a _great_; so the comforts\nof it are but temporary and vain; beside that, without extraordinary\nmoderation, their end is only pain and repentance; whereas a peaceful\nconscience, honest thoughts, virtuous actions, and an indifference for\ncasual events, are blessings without end, satiety, or measure. This\nconsummated state of felicity is only a submission to the dictate of\nright nature; \u201cThe foundation of it is wisdom and virtue; the knowledge\nof what we ought to do, and the conformity of the will to that\nknowledge.\u201d\nCHAPTER II.\nHUMAN HAPPINESS IS FOUNDED UPON WISDOM AND VIRTUE; AND FIRST, OF WISDOM.\nTaking for granted that _human happiness_ is founded upon _wisdom_ and\n_virtue_ we shall treat of these two points in order as they lie: and,\n_first_, of _wisdom_; not in the latitude of its various operations but\nas it has only a regard to good life, and the happiness of mankind.\nWisdom is a right understanding, a faculty of discerning good from\nevil; what is to be chosen, and what rejected; a judgment grounded upon\nthe value of things, and not the common opinion of them; an equality\nof force, and a strength of resolution. It sets a watch over our\nwords and deeds, it takes us up with the contemplation of the works\nof nature, and makes us invincible by either good or evil fortune. It\nis large and spacious, and requires a great deal of room to work in;\nit ransacks heaven and earth; it has for its object things past and\nto come, transitory and eternal. It examines all the circumstances\nof time; \u201cwhat it is, when it began, and how long it will continue:\nand so for the mind; whence it came; what it is; when it begins; how\nlong it lasts; whether or not it passes from one form to another, or\nserves only one and wanders when it leaves us; whether it abides in a\nstate of separation, and what the action of it; what use it makes of\nits liberty; whether or not it retains the memory of things past, and\ncomes to the knowledge of itself.\u201d It is the habit of a perfect mind,\nand the perfection of humanity, raised as high as Nature can carry it.\nIt differs from _philosophy_, as avarice and money; the one desires,\nand the other is desired; the one is the effect and the reward of the\nother. To be wise is the use of wisdom, as seeing is the use of eyes,\nand well-speaking the use of eloquence. He that is perfectly wise is\nperfectly happy; nay, the very beginning of wisdom makes life easy to\nus. Neither is it enough to know this, unless we print it in our minds\nby daily meditation, and so bring a _good-will_ to a good habit. And\nwe must practice what we preach: for _philosophy_ is not a subject for\npopular ostentation; nor does it rest in words, but in things. It is\nnot an entertainment taken up for delight, or to give a taste to our\nleisure; but it fashions the mind, governs our actions, tells us what\nwe are to do, and what not. It sits at the helm, and guides us through\nall hazards; nay, we cannot be safe without it, for every hour gives\nus occasion to make use of it. It informs us in all duties of life,\npiety to our parents, faith to our friends, charity to the miserable,\njudgment in counsel; it gives us _peace_ by _fearing_ nothing, and\n_riches_ by _coveting nothing_.\nThere is no condition of life that excludes a wise man from discharging\nhis duty. If his fortune be good, he _tempers_ it; if bad, he _masters_\nit; if he has an estate, he will exercise his virtue in plenty; if\nnone, in poverty: if he cannot do it in his country, he will do it in\nbanishment; if he has no command, he will do the office of a common\nsoldier. Some people have the skill of reclaiming the fiercest of\nbeasts; they will make a lion embrace his keeper, a tiger kiss him,\nand an elephant kneel to him. This is the case of a wise man in the\nextremest difficulties; let them be never so terrible in themselves,\nwhen they come to him once, they are perfectly tame. They that ascribe\nthe invention of tillage, architecture, navigation, etc., to wise\nmen, may perchance be in the right, that they were invented by wise\nmen, as _wise men_; for wisdom does not teach our fingers, but our\nminds: fiddling and dancing, arms and fortifications, were the works\nof luxury and discord; but wisdom instructs us in the way of nature,\nand in the arts of unity and concord, not in the instruments, but in\nthe government of life; not to make us live only, but to live happily.\nShe teaches us what things are good, what evil, and what only appear\nso; and to distinguish betwixt true greatness and tumor. She clears\nour minds of dross and vanity; she raises up our thoughts to heaven,\nand carries them down to hell: she discourses of the nature of the\nsoul, the powers and faculties of it; the first principles of things;\nthe order of Providence: she exalts us from things corporeal to things\nincorporeal, and retrieves the truth of all: she searches nature, gives\nlaws to life; and tells us, \u201cThat it is not enough to God, unless we\nobey him:\u201d she looks upon all accidents as acts of Providence: sets a\ntrue value upon things; delivers us from false opinions, and condemns\nall pleasures that are attended with repentance. She allows nothing\nto be good that will not be so forever; no man to be happy but that\nneeds no other happiness than what he has within himself. This is the\nfelicity of human life; a felicity that can neither be corrupted nor\nextinguished: it inquires into the nature of the heavens, the influence\nof the stars; how far they operate upon our minds and bodies: which\nthoughts, though they do not form our manners, they do yet raise and\ndispose us for glorious things.\nIt is agreed upon all hands that \u201cright reason is the perfection of\nhuman nature,\u201d and wisdom only the dictate of it. The greatness that\narises from it is solid and unmovable, the resolutions of wisdom being\nfree, absolute and constant; whereas folly is never long pleased with\nthe same thing, but still shifting of counsels and sick of itself.\nThere can be no happiness without constancy and prudence, for a wise\nman is to write without a blot, and what he likes once he approves for\never. He admits of nothing that is either evil or slippery, but marches\nwithout staggering or stumbling, and is never surprised; he lives\nalways true and steady to himself, and whatsoever befalls him, this\ngreat artificer of both fortunes turns to advantage; he that demurs\nand hesitates is not yet composed; but wheresoever virtue interposes\nupon the main, there must be concord and consent in the parts; for\nall virtues are in agreement, as well as all vices are at variance. A\nwise man, in what condition soever he is will be still happy, for he\nsubjects all things to himself, because he submits himself to reason,\nand governs his actions by council, not by passion.\nHe is not moved with the utmost violence of fortune, nor with the\nextremities of fire and sword; whereas a fool is afraid of his own\nshadow, and surprised at ill accidents, as if they were all levelled at\nhim. He does nothing unwillingly, for whatever he finds necessary, he\nmakes it his choice. He propounds to himself the certain scope and end\nof human life: he follows that which conduces to it, and avoids that\nwhich hinders it. He is content with his lot whatever it be, without\nwishing what he has not, though, of the two, he had rather abound than\nwant. The great business of his life like that of nature, is performed\nwithout tumult or noise. He neither fears danger or provokes it, but\nit is his caution, not any want of courage\u2014for captivity, wounds and\nchains, he only looks upon as false and lymphatic terrors. He does not\npretend to go through with whatever he undertakes, but to do that well\nwhich he does. Arts are but the servants\u2014wisdom commands\u2014and where the\nmatter fails it is none of the workman\u2019s fault. He is cautelous in\ndoubtful cases, in prosperity temperate, and resolute in adversity,\nstill making the best of every condition and improving all occasions to\nmake them serviceable to his fate. Some accidents there are, which I\nconfess may affect him, but not overthrow him, as bodily pains, loss of\nchildren and friends, the ruin and desolation of a man\u2019s country. One\nmust be made of stone or iron, not to be sensible of these calamities;\nand, beside, it were no virtue to _bear_ them, if a body did not _feel_\nthem.\nThere are _three degrees of proficients_ in the school of wisdom.\nThe _first_ are those that come within sight of it, but not up to\nit\u2014they have learned what they ought to do, but they have not put\ntheir knowledge in practice\u2014they are past the hazard of a relapse, but\nthey have still the grudges of a disease, though they are out of the\ndanger of it. By a disease I do understand an obstinacy in evil, or an\nill habit, that makes us over eager upon things which are either not\nmuch to be desired, or not at all. A _second_ sort are those that have\nsubjected their appetites for a season, but are yet in fear of falling\nback. A _third_ sort are those that are clear of many vices but not of\nall. They are not covetous, but perhaps they are choleric\u2014nor lustful,\nbut perchance ambitious; they are firm enough in some cases but weak\nenough in others: there are many that despise death and yet shrink at\npain. There are diversities in wise men, but no inequalities\u2014one is\nmore affable, another more ready, a third a better speaker; but the\nfelicity of them all is equal. It is in this as in heavenly bodies,\nthere is a _certain state_ in greatness.\nIn civil and domestic affairs, a wise man may stand in need of\ncounsel, as of a physician, an advocate, a solicitor; but in greater\nmatters, the blessing of wise men rests in the joy they take in the\ncommunication of their virtues. If there were nothing else in it, a\nman would apply himself to wisdom, because it settles him in a perfect\ntranquillity of mind.\nCHAPTER III.\nTHERE CAN BE NO HAPPINESS WITHOUT VIRTUE.\nVirtue is that perfect good which is the complement of a _happy life_;\nthe only immortal thing that belongs to mortality\u2014it is the knowledge\nboth of others and itself\u2014it is an invincible greatness of mind, not\nto be elevated or dejected with good or ill fortune. It is sociable\nand gentle, free, steady, and fearless, content within itself, full of\ninexhaustible delights, and it is valued for itself. One may be a good\nphysician, a good governor, a good grammarian, without being a good\nman, so that all things from without are only accessories, for the seat\nof it is a pure and holy mind. It consists in a congruity of actions\nwhich we can never expect so long as we are distracted by our passions:\nnot but that a man may be allowed to change color and countenance, and\nsuffer such impressions as are properly a kind of natural force upon\nthe body, and not under the dominion of the mind; but all this while\nI will have his judgment firm, and he shall act steadily and boldly,\nwithout wavering betwixt the motions of his body and those of his mind.\nIt is not a thing indifferent, I know, whether a man lies at ease upon\na bed, or in torment upon a wheel\u2014and yet the former may be the worse\nof the two if he suffer the latter with honor, and enjoy the other\nwith infamy. It is not the _matter_, but the _virtue_, that makes the\naction _good or ill_; and he that is led in triumph may be yet greater\nthan his conqueror.\nWhen we come once to value our flesh above our honesty we are lost:\nand yet I would not press upon dangers, no, not so much as upon\ninconveniences, unless where the man and the brute come in competition;\nand in such a case, rather than make a forfeiture of my credit, my\nreason, or my faith, I would run all extremities.\nThey are great blessings to have tender parents, dutiful children, and\nto live under a just and well-ordered government. Now, would it not\ntrouble even a virtuous man to see his children butchered before his\neyes, his father made a slave, and his country overrun by a barbarous\nenemy? There is a great difference betwixt the simple loss of a\nblessing and the succeeding of a great mischief in the place of it,\nover and above. The loss of health is followed with sickness, and the\nloss of sight with blindness; but this does not hold in the loss of\nfriends and children, where there is rather something to the contrary\nto supply that loss: that is to say, _virtue_, which fills the mind,\nand takes away the desire of what we have not. What matters it whether\nthe water be stopped or not, so long as the fountain is safe? Is a man\never the wiser for a multitude of friends, or the more foolish for the\nloss of them? so neither is he the happier, nor the more miserable.\nShort life, grief and pain are accessions that have no effect at all\nupon virtue. It consists in the action and not in the things we do\u2014in\nthe choice itself, and not in the subject-matter of it. It is not a\ndespicable body or condition, nor poverty, infamy or scandal, that\ncan obscure the glories of virtue; but a man may see her through all\noppositions: and he that looks diligently into the state of a wicked\nman will see the canker at his heart, through all the false and\ndazzling splendors of greatness and fortune. We shall then discover\nour _childishness_, in setting our hearts upon things trivial and\ncontemptible, and in the selling of our very country and parents for\na _rattle_. And what is the difference (in effect) betwixt _old men_\nand _children_, but that the _one_ deals in _paintings_ and _statues_,\nand the _other_ in _babies_, so that we ourselves are only the more\nexpensive fools.\nIf one could but see the mind of a good man, as it is illustrated with\nvirtue; the beauty and the majesty of it, which is a dignity not so\nmuch as to be thought of without love and veneration\u2014would not a man\nbless himself at the sight of such an object as at the encounter of\nsome supernatural power\u2014a power so miraculous that it is a kind of\ncharm upon the souls of those that are truly affected with it. There\nis so wonderful a grace and authority in it that even the worst of men\napprove it, and set up for the reputation of being accounted virtuous\nthemselves. They covet the fruit indeed, and the profit of wickedness;\nbut they hate and are ashamed of the imputation of it. It is by an\nimpression of Nature that all men have a reverence for virtue\u2014they\nknow it and they have a respect for it though they do not practice\nit\u2014nay, for the countenance of their very _wickedness_, they miscall it\n_virtue_. Their injuries they call _benefits_, and expect a man should\nthank them for doing him a mischief\u2014they cover their most notorious\niniquities with a pretext of justice.\nHe that robs upon the highway had rather find his booty than force\nit; ask any of them that live upon rapine, fraud, oppression, if they\nhad not rather enjoy a fortune honestly gotten, and their consciences\nwill not suffer them to deny it. Men are vicious only for the proof of\nvillainy; for at the same time that they commit it they condemn it;\nnay, so powerful is virtue, and so gracious is Providence, that every\nman has a light set up within him for a guide, which we do, all of\nus, both see and acknowledge, though we do not pursue it. This it is\nthat makes the prisoner upon the torture happier than the executioner,\nand sickness better than health, if we bear it without yielding or\nrepining\u2014this it is that overcomes ill-fortune and moderates good\u2014for\nit marches betwixt the one and the other, with an equal contempt for\nboth. It turns (like fire) all things into itself, our actions and our\nfriendships are tinctured with it, and whatever it touches becomes\namiable.\nThat which is frail and mortal rises and falls, grows, wastes, and\nvaries from itself; but the state of things divine is always the same;\nand so is virtue, let the matter be what it will. It is never the worse\nfor the difficulty of the action, nor the better for the easiness of\nit. It is the same in a rich man as in a poor; in a sickly man as in a\nsound; in a strong as in a weak; the virtue of the besieged is as great\nas that of the besiegers. There are some virtues, I confess, which a\ngood man cannot be without, and yet he had rather have no occasion to\nemploy them. If there were any difference, I should prefer the virtues\nof patience before those of pleasure; for it is braver to break through\ndifficulties than to temper our delights. But though the subject of\nvirtue may possibly be against nature, as to be burnt or wounded, yet\nthe virtue itself of _an invincible patience_ is according to nature.\nWe may seem, perhaps, to promise more than human nature is able to\nperform; but we speak with a respect to the mind, and not to the body.\nIf a man does not live up to his own rules, it is something yet to have\nvirtuous meditations and good purposes, even without acting; it is\ngenerous, the very adventure of being good, and the bare proposal of\nan eminent course of life, though beyond the force of human frailty to\naccomplish. There is something of honor yet in the miscarriage; nay,\nin the naked contemplation of it. I would receive my own death with as\nlittle trouble as I would hear of another man\u2019s; I would bear the same\nmind whether I be rich or poor, whether I get or lose in the world;\nwhat I have, I will neither sordidly spare, or prodigally squander\naway, and I will reckon upon benefits well-placed as the fairest part\nof my possession: not valuing them by number or weight, but by the\nprofit and esteem of the receiver; accounting myself never the poorer\nfor that which I give to a worthy person. What I do shall be done for\nconscience, not ostentation. I will eat and drink, not to gratify my\npalate, or only to fill and empty, but to satisfy nature: I will be\ncheerful to my friends, mild and placable to my enemies: I will prevent\nan honest request if I can foresee it, and I will grant it without\nasking: I will look upon the whole world as my country, and upon the\ngods, both as the witnesses and the judges of my words and deeds. I\nwill live and die with this testimony, that I loved good studies, and a\ngood conscience; that I never invaded another man\u2019s liberty; and that\nI preserved my own. I will govern my life and my thoughts as if the\nwhole world were to see the one, and to read the other; for \u201cwhat does\nit signify to make anything a secret to my neighbor, when to God (who\nis the searcher of our hearts) all our privacies are open?\u201d\nVirtue is divided into two parts, _contemplation_ and _action_. The\none is delivered by institution, the other by admonition: one part of\nvirtue consists in discipline, the other in exercise: for we must first\nlearn, and then practice. The sooner we begin to apply ourselves to\nit, and the more haste we make, the longer shall we enjoy the comforts\nof a rectified mind; nay, we have the fruition of it in the very act\nof forming it: but it is another sort of delight, I must confess,\nthat arises from a contemplation of a soul which is advanced into the\npossession of wisdom and virtue. If it was so great a comfort to us\nto pass from the subjection of our childhood into a state of liberty\nand business, how much greater will it be when we come to cast off the\nboyish levity of our minds, and range ourselves among the philosophers?\nWe are past our minority, it is true, but not our indiscretions;\nand, which is yet worse, we have the authority of seniors, and the\nweaknesses of children, (I might have said of infants, for every little\nthing frights the one, and every trivial fancy the other.) Whoever\nstudies this point well will find that many things are the less to\nbe feared the more terrible they appear. To think anything good that\nis not honest, were to reproach Providence; for good men suffer many\ninconveniences; but virtue, like the sun, goes on still with her work,\nlet the air be never so cloudy, and finishes her course, extinguishing\nlikewise all other splendors and oppositions; insomuch that calamity is\nno more to a virtuous mind, than a shower into the sea. That which is\nright, is not to be valued by _quantity_, _number_, or _time_; a life\nof a day may be as honest as a life of a hundred years: but yet virtue\nin one man may have a larger field to show itself in than in another.\nOne man, perhaps, may be in a station to administer unto cities and\nkingdoms; to contrive good laws, create friendships, and do beneficial\noffices to mankind.\nFor virtue is open to all; as well to servants and exiles, as to\nprinces: it is profitable to the world and to itself, at all distances\nand in all conditions; and there is no difficulty can excuse a man from\nthe exercise of it; and it is only to be found in a wise man, though\nthere may be some faint resemblances of it in the common people. The\nStoics hold all virtues to be equal; but yet there is great variety\nin the matter they have to work upon, according as it is larger or\nnarrower, illustrious or less noble, of more or less extent; as all\ngood men are equal, that is to say, as they are good; but yet one may\nbe young, another old; one may be rich, another poor; one eminent and\npowerful, another unknown and obscure. There are many things which have\nlittle or no grace in themselves, and are yet glorious and remarkable\nby virtue. Nothing can be good which gives neither greatness nor\nsecurity to the mind; but, on the contrary, infects it with insolence,\narrogance, and tumor: nor does virtue dwell upon the tip of the tongue,\nbut in the temple of a purified heart. He that depends upon any other\ngood becomes covetous of life, and what belongs to it; which exposes a\nman to appetites that are vast, unlimited, and intolerable. Virtue is\nfree and indefatigable, and accompanied with concord and gracefulness;\nwhereas pleasure is mean, servile, transitory, tiresome, and sickly\nand scarce outlives the tasting of it: it is the good of the belly,\nand not of the man; and only the felicity of brutes. Who does not know\nthat fools enjoy their pleasures, and that there is great variety in\nthe entertainments of wickedness? Nay, the mind itself has its variety\nof perverse pleasures as well as the body: as insolence, self-conceit,\npride, garrulity, laziness, and the abusive wit of turning everything\ninto _ridicule_, whereas virtue weighs all this, and corrects it. It is\nthe knowledge both of others and of itself; it is to be learned from\nitself; and the very will itself may be taught; which will cannot be\nright, unless the whole habit of the mind be right from whence the will\ncomes. It is by the impulse of virtue that we love virtue, so that the\nvery way to virtue, lies by virtue, which takes in also, at a view, the\nlaws of human life.\nNeither are we to value ourselves upon a day, or an hour, or any one\naction, but upon the whole habit of the mind. Some men do one thing\nbravely, but not another; they will shrink at infamy, and bear up\nagainst poverty: in this case, we commend the fact, and despise the\nman. The soul is never in the right place until it be delivered from\nthe cares of human affairs; we must labor and climb the hill, if we\nwill arrive at virtue, whose seat is upon the top of it. He that\nmasters avarice, and is truly good, stands firm against ambition; he\nlooks upon his last hour not as a punishment, but as the equity of a\ncommon fate; he that subdues his carnal lusts shall easily keep himself\nuntainted with any other: so that reason does not encounter this or\nthat vice by itself, but beats down all at a blow. What does he care\nfor ignominy that only values himself upon conscience, and not opinion?\nSocrates looked a scandalous death in the face with the same constancy\nthat he had before practiced towards the thirty tyrants: his virtue\nconsecrated the very dungeon: as Cato\u2019s repulse was Cato\u2019s honor, and\nthe reproach of the government. He that is wise will take delight even\nin an ill opinion that is well gotten; it is ostentation, not virtue,\nwhen a man will have his good deeds published; and it is not enough\nto be just where there is honor to be gotten, but to continue so, in\ndefiance of infamy and danger.\nBut virtue cannot lie hid, for the time will come that shall raise it\nagain (even after it is buried) and deliver it from the malignity of\nthe age that oppressed it: immortal glory is the shadow of it, and\nkeeps it company whether we will or not; but sometimes the shadow\ngoes before the substance, and other whiles it follows it; and the\nlater it comes, the larger it is, when even envy itself shall have\ngiven way to it. It was a long time that Democritus was taken for a\nmadman, and before Socrates had any esteem in the world. How long was\nit before Cato could be understood? Nay, he was affronted, contemned,\nand rejected; and the people never knew the value of him until they had\nlost him: the integrity and courage of mad Rutilius had been forgotten\nbut for his sufferings. I speak of those that fortune has made famous\nfor their persecutions: and there are others also that the world never\ntook notice of until they were dead; as Epicurus and Metrodorus, that\nwere almost wholly unknown, even in the place where they lived. Now, as\nthe body is to be kept in upon the down-hill, and forced upwards, so\nthere are some virtues that require the rein and others the spur. In\n_liberality_, _temperance_, _gentleness_ of nature, we are to check\nourselves for fear of falling; but in _patience_, _resolutions_, and\n_perseverance_, where we are to mount the hill, we stand in need of\nencouragement. Upon this division of the matter, I had rather steer the\nsmoother course than pass through the experiments of sweat and blood:\nI know it is my duty to be content in all conditions; but yet, if it\nwere at my election, I would choose the fairest. When a man comes once\nto stand in need of fortune, his life is anxious, suspicious, timorous,\ndependent upon every moment, and in fear of all accidents. How can that\nman resign himself to God, or bear his lot, whatever it be, without\nmurmuring, and cheerfully submit to Providence, that shrinks at every\nmotion of pleasure or pain? It is virtue alone that raises us above\ngriefs, hopes, fears and chances; and makes us not only patient, but\nwilling, as knowing that whatever we suffer is according to the decree\nof Heaven. He that is overcome with pleasure, (so contemptible and\nweak an enemy) what will become of him when he comes to grapple with\ndangers, necessities, torments, death, and the dissolution of nature\nitself? Wealth, honor, and favor, may come upon a man by chance; nay,\nthey may be cast upon him without so much as looking after them: but\nvirtue is the work of industry and labor; and certainly it is worth the\nwhile to purchase that good which brings all others along with it. A\ngood man is happy within himself, and independent upon fortune: kind\nto his friend, temperate to his enemy, religiously just, indefatigably\nlaborious; and he discharges all duties with a constancy and congruity\nof actions.\nCHAPTER IV.\nPHILOSOPHY IS THE GUIDE OF LIFE.\nIf it be true, that the _understanding_ and the _will_ are the _two\neminent faculties of the reasonable soul_, it follows necessarily,\nthat _wisdom_ and _virtue_, (which are the best improvements of these\ntwo faculties,) must be the perfection also of our _reasonable being_;\nand consequently, _the undeniable foundation of a happy life_. There\nis not any duty to which Providence has not annexed a blessing; nor\nany institution of Heaven which, even in this life, we may not be the\nbetter for; not any temptation, either of fortune or of appetite, that\nis not subject to our reason; nor any passion or affliction for which\nvirtue has not provided a remedy. So that it is our own fault if we\neither fear or hope for anything; which two affections are the root of\nall our miseries. From this general prospect of the _foundation_ of our\n_tranquillity_, we shall pass by degrees to a particular consideration\nof the _means_ by which it may be _procured_, and of the _impediments_\nthat _obstruct_ it; beginning with that _philosophy_ which principally\nregards our manners, and instructs us in the measures of a virtuous and\nquiet life.\n_Philosophy_ is divided into _moral_, _natural_, and _rational_: the\n_first_ concerns our _manners_; the _second_ searches the works of\n_Nature_; and the _third_ furnishes us with propriety of _words_ and\n_arguments_, and the faculty of _distinguishing_, that we may not be\nimposed upon with tricks and fallacies. The _causes_ of things fall\nunder _natural philosophy_, _arguments_ under _rational_, and _actions_\nunder _moral_. _Moral philosophy_ is again divided into matter of\n_justice_, which arises from the estimation of things and of men; and\ninto _affections_ and _actions_; and a failing in any one of these,\ndisorders all the rest: for what does it profit us to know the true\nvalue of things, if we be transported by our passion? or to master our\nappetites without understanding the _when_, the _what_, the _how_,\nand other circumstances of our proceedings? For it is one thing to\nknow the rate and dignity of things, and another to know the little\nnicks and springs of acting. _Natural philosophy_ is conversant about\nthings _corporeal_ and _incorporeal_; the disquisition of _causes_ and\n_effects_, and the contemplation of the _cause of causes_. _Rational\nphilosophy_ is divided into _logic_ and _rhetoric_; the one looks after\n_words_, _sense_, and _order_; the other treats barely of _words_,\nand the _significations_ of them. Socrates places all _philosophy_ in\n_morals_; and _wisdom_ in the distinguishing of _good_ and _evil_.\nIt is the art and law of life, and it teaches us what to do in all\ncases, and, like good marksmen, to hit the white at any distance. The\nforce of it is incredible; for it gives us in the weakness of a man\nthe security of a _spirit_: in sickness it is as good as a remedy to\nus; for whatsoever eases the mind is profitable also to the body. The\n_physician_ may prescribe diet and exercise, and accommodate his rule\nand medicine to the disease, but it is _philosophy_ that must bring\nus to a contempt of death, which is the remedy of all diseases. In\npoverty it gives us riches, or such a state of mind as makes them\nsuperfluous to us. It arms us against all difficulties: one man is\npressed with death, another with poverty; some with envy, others are\noffended at Providence, and unsatisfied with the condition of mankind:\nbut _philosophy_ prompts us to relieve the prisoner, the infirm, the\nnecessitous, the condemned; to show the ignorant their errors, and\nrectify their affections. It makes us inspect and govern our manners;\nit rouses us where we are faint and drowsy: it binds up what is loose,\nand humbles in us that which is contumacious: it delivers the mind\nfrom the bondage of the body, and raises it up to the contemplation of\nits divine original. Honors, monuments, and all the works of vanity\nand ambition are demolished and destroyed by time; but the reputation\nof wisdom is venerable to posterity, and those that were envied or\nneglected in their lives are adored in their memories, and exempted\nfrom the very laws of created nature, which has set bounds to all other\nthings. The very shadow of _glory_ carries a man of _honor_ upon all\ndangers, to the contempt of fire and sword; and it were a shame if\n_right reason_ should not inspire as generous resolutions into a man of\n_virtue_.\nNeither is _philosophy_ only profitable to the public, but one wise man\nhelps another, even in the exercise of the virtues; and the one has\nneed of the other, both for conversation and counsel; for they kindle a\nmutual emulation in good offices. We are not so perfect yet, but that\nmany new things remain still to be found out, which will give us the\nreciprocal advantages of instructing one another: for as one wicked man\nis contagious to another, and the more vices are mingled, the worse it\nis, so is it on the contrary with good men and their virtues. As men\nof letters are the most useful and excellent of friends, so are they\nthe best of subjects; as being better judges of the blessings they\nenjoy under a well-ordered government, and of what they owe to the\nmagistrate for their freedom and protection. They are men of sobriety\nand learning, and free from boasting and insolence; they reprove the\nvice without reproaching the person; for they have learned to be\nwithout either pomp or envy. That which we see in high mountains,\nwe find in _philosophers_; they seem taller near at hand than at a\ndistance. They are raised above other men, but their greatness is\nsubstantial. Nor do they stand upon tiptoe, that they may seem higher\nthan they are, but, content with their own stature, they reckon\nthemselves tall enough when fortune cannot reach them. Their laws are\nshort, and yet comprehensive too, for they bind all.\nIt is the bounty of _nature_ that we _live_; but of _philosophy_ that\nwe _live well_, which is in truth a greater benefit than life itself.\nNot but that _philosophy_ is also the gift of Heaven, so far as to\nthe faculty, but not to the science; for that must be the business\nof industry. No man is born wise; but wisdom and virtue require a\ntutor, though we can easily learn to be vicious without a master. It\nis _philosophy_ that gives us a veneration for God, a charity for our\nneighbor, that teaches us our duty to Heaven, and exhorts us to an\nagreement one with another; it unmasks things that are terrible to us,\nassuages our lusts, refutes our errors, restrains our luxury, reproves\nour avarice, and works strangely upon tender natures. I could never\nhear Attalus (says Seneca) upon the vices of the age and the errors\nof life, without a compassion for mankind; and in his discourses\nupon poverty, there was something methought that was more than human.\n\u201cMore than we use,\u201d says he, \u201cis more than we need, and only a burden\nto the bearer.\u201d That saying of his put me out of countenance at the\nsuperfluities of my own fortune. And so in his invectives against vain\npleasures, he did at such a rate advance the felicities of a sober\ntable, a pure mind, and a chaste body that a man could not hear him\nwithout a love for continence and moderation. Upon these lectures of\nhis, I denied myself, for a while after, certain delicacies that I had\nformerly used: but in a short time I fell to them again, though so\nsparingly, that the proportion came little short of a total abstinence.\nNow, to show you (says our author) how much earnester my entrance upon\nphilosophy was than my progress, my tutor Sotion gave me a wonderful\nkindness for Pythagoras, and after him for Sextius: the former forbore\nshedding of blood upon his _metempsychosis:_ and put men in fear of it,\nlest they should offer violence to the souls of some of their departed\nfriends or relations. \u201cWhether,\u201d says he, \u201cthere be a transmigration or\nnot; if it be true, there is no hurt; if false, there is frugality: and\nnothing is gotten by cruelty neither, but the cozening a wolf, perhaps,\nor a vulture, of a supper.\u201d\nNow, Sextius abstained upon another account, which was, that he\nwould not have men inured to hardness of heart by the laceration and\ntormenting of living creatures; beside, \u201cthat Nature had sufficiently\nprovided for the sustenance of mankind without blood.\u201d This wrought\nupon me so far that I gave over eating of flesh, and in one year I\nmade it not only easy to me but pleasant; my mind methought was more\nat liberty, (and I am still of the same opinion,) but I gave it over\nnevertheless; and the reason was this: it was imputed as a superstition\nto the Jews, the forbearance of some sorts of flesh, and my father\nbrought me back again to my old custom, that I might not be thought\ntainted with their superstition. Nay, and I had much ado to prevail\nupon myself to suffer it too. I make use of this instance to show the\naptness of youth to take good impressions, if there be a friend at hand\nto press them. Philosophers are the tutors of mankind; if they have\nfound out remedies for the mind, it must be our part to employ them.\nI cannot think of Cato, Lelius, Socrates, Plato, without veneration:\ntheir very names are sacred to me. Philosophy is the health of the\nmind; let us look to that health first, and in the second place to\nthat of the body, which may be had upon easier terms; for a strong\narm, a robust constitution, or the skill of procuring this, is not a\nphilosopher\u2019s business. He does some things as a _wise man,_ and other\nthings as he is a _man_; and he may have strength of body as well as of\nmind; but if he runs, or casts the sledge, it were injurious to ascribe\nthat to his wisdom which is common to the greatest of fools. He studies\nrather to fill his mind than his coffers; and he knows that gold and\nsilver were mingled with dirt, until avarice or ambition parted them.\nHis life is ordinate, fearless, equal, secure; he stands firm in all\nextremities, and bears the lot of his humanity with a divine temper.\nThere is a great difference betwixt the splendor of philosophy and\nof fortune; the one shines with an original light, the other with a\nborrowed one; beside that it makes us happy and immortal: for learning\nshall outlive palaces and monuments. The house of a wise man is safe,\nthough narrow; there is neither noise nor furniture in it, no porter\nat the door, nor anything that is either vendible or mercenary, nor any\nbusiness of fortune, for she has nothing to do where she has nothing\nto look after. This is the way to Heaven which Nature has chalked out,\nand it is both secure and pleasant; there needs no train of servants,\nno pomp or equipage, to make good our passage; no money or letters of\ncredit, for expenses upon the voyage; but the graces of an honest mind\nwill serve us upon the way, and make us happy at our journey\u2019s end.\nTo tell you my opinion now of the _liberal sciences_; I have no great\nesteem for any thing that terminates in profit or money; and yet I\nshall allow them to be so far beneficial, as they only _prepare_ the\nunderstanding without _detaining_ it. They are but the rudiments\nof wisdom, and only then to be learned when the mind is capable of\nnothing better, and the knowledge of them is better worth the keeping\nthan the acquiring. They do not so much as pretend to the making of\nus virtuous, but only to give us an aptitude of disposition to be\nso. The _grammarian\u2019s_ business lies in a _syntax_ of speech; or if\nhe proceed to _history_, or the measuring of a _verse_, he is at\nthe end of his line; but what signifies a congruity of periods, the\ncomputing of syllables, or the modifying of numbers, to the taming\nof our passions, or the repressing of our lusts? The _philosopher_\nproves the body of the sun to be large, but for the true dimensions\nof it we must ask the _mathematician_: _geometry_ and _music_, if\nthey do not teach us to master our hopes and fears, all the rest is\nto little purpose. What does it concern us which was the elder of the\ntwo, Homer or Hesiod? or which was the taller, Helen or Hecuba? We\ntake a great deal of pains to trace Ulysses in his wanderings, but\nwere it not time as well spent to look to ourselves that we may not\nwander at all? Are not we ourselves tossed with tempestuous passions?\nand both _assaulted_ by terrible _monsters_ on the one hand, and\n_tempted_ by _syrens_ on the other? Teach me my duty to my country, to\nmy father, to my wife, to mankind. What is it to me whether Penelope\nwas _honest_ or not? teach me to know how to be so myself, and to\nlive according to that knowledge. What am I the better for putting so\nmany parts together in _music_, and raising a harmony out of so many\ndifferent tones? teach me to tune my affections, and to hold constant\nto myself. _Geometry_ teaches me the art of _measuring acres_; teach\nme to _measure my appetites_, and to know when I have enough; teach\nme to divide with my brother, and to rejoice in the prosperity of my\nneighbor. You teach me how I may hold my own, and keep my estate; but\nI would rather learn how I may lose it all, and yet be contented. \u201cIt\nis hard,\u201d you will say, \u201cfor a man to be forced from the fortune of his\nfamily.\u201d This estate, it is true, was my _father\u2019s_; but whose was it\nin the time of my _grandfather_? I do not only say, what _man\u2019s_ was\nit? but what _nation\u2019s_? The _astrologer_ tells me of Saturn and Mars\nin _opposition_; but I say, let them be as they will, their courses\nand their positions are ordered them by an unchangeable decree of\nfate. Either they produce and point out the effects of all things, or\nelse they signify them; if the former, what are we the better for the\nknowledge of that which must of necessity come to pass? If the latter,\nwhat does it avail us to foresee what we cannot avoid? So that whether\nwe know or not know, the event will still be the same.\nHe that designs the institution of human life should not be\nover-curious of his words; it does not stand with his dignity to be\nsolicitous about sounds and syllables, and to debase the mind of\nman with trivial things; placing wisdom in matters that are rather\ndifficult than great. If it be _eloquent_, it is his _good fortune_,\nnot his _business_. Subtle disputations are only the sport of wits,\nthat play upon the catch, and are fitter to be contemned than resolved.\nWere not I a madman to sit wrangling about words, and putting of\nnice and impertinent questions, when the enemy has already made the\nbreach, the town fired over my head, and the mine ready to play that\nshall blow me up into the air? were this a time for fooleries? Let me\nrather fortify myself against death and inevitable necessities; let\nme understand that the good of life does not consist in the length or\nspace, but in the use of it. When I go to _sleep_, who knows whether\nI shall ever _wake_ again? and when I _wake_, whether ever I shall\n_sleep_ again? When I go _abroad_, whether ever I shall come _home_\nagain? and when I _return_, whether ever I shall go _abroad_ again? It\nis not at sea only that life and death are within a few inches one of\nanother; but they are as near everywhere else too, only we do not take\nso much notice of it. What have we to do with frivolous and captious\nquestions, and impertinent niceties? Let us rather study how to deliver\nourselves from sadness, fear, and the burden of all our secret lusts:\nlet us pass over all our most solemn levities, and make haste to a\ngood life, which is a thing that presses us. Shall a man that goes\nfor a midwife, stand gaping upon a post to see _what play to-day_?\nor, when his house is on fire, stay the curling of a periwig before\nhe calls for help? Our houses are on fire, our country invaded, our\ngoods taken away, our children in danger; and, I might add to these,\nthe calamities of earthquakes, shipwrecks, and whatever else is most\nterrible. Is this a time for us now to be playing fast and loose with\nidle questions, which are in effect so many unprofitable riddles? Our\nduty is the cure of the mind rather than the delight of it; but we have\nonly the words of wisdom without the works; and turn philosophy into a\npleasure that was given for a remedy. What can be more ridiculous than\nfor a man to _neglect_ his _manners_ and _compose_ his _style_? We are\nsick and ulcerous, and must be lanced and scarified, and every man has\nas much business within himself as a physician in a common pestilence.\n\u201cMisfortunes,\u201d in fine, \u201ccannot be avoided; but they may be sweetened,\nif not overcome; and our lives may be made happy by philosophy.\u201d\nCHAPTER V.\nTHE FORCE OF PRECEPTS.\nThere seems to be so near an affinity betwixt _wisdom_, _philosophy_,\nand _good counsels_, that it is rather matter of curiosity than of\nprofit to divide them; _philosophy_, being only a _limited wisdom_;\nand _good counsels a communication of that wisdom_, for the good of\n_others_, as well as of _ourselves_; and to _posterity_, as well as to\nthe _present_. The _wisdom_ of the _ancients_, as to the government of\nlife, was no more than certain precepts, what to do and what not: and\nmen were much better in that simplicity; for as they came to be more\n_learned_, they grew less careful of being _good_. That _plain_ and\n_open virtue_ is now turned into a _dark_ and _intricate science_; and\nwe are taught to _dispute_ rather than to _live_. So long as wickedness\nwas simple, simple remedies also were sufficient against it; but now it\nhas taken root, and spread, we must make use of stronger.\nThere are some dispositions that embrace good things as soon as they\nhear them; but they will still need quickening by admonition and\nprecept. We are rash and forward in some cases, and dull in others;\nand there is no repressing of the one humor, or raising of the other,\nbut by removing the causes of them; which are (in one word) _false\nadmiration_ and _false fear_.\nEvery man knows his duty to his country, to his friends, to his\nguests; and yet when he is called upon to draw his sword for the one,\nor to labor for the other, he finds himself distracted betwixt his\napprehensions and his delights: he knows well enough the injury he\ndoes his wife in the keeping of a wench, and yet his lust overrules\nhim: so that it is not enough to give good advice, unless we can take\naway that which hinders the benefit of it. If a man does what he ought\nto do, he will never do it constantly or equally, without knowing why\nhe does it: and if it be only chance or custom, he that does well by\nchance, may do ill so too. And farther, a precept may direct us what\nwe _ought_ to do, and yet fall short in the manner of doing it: an\nexpensive entertainment may, in one case be extravagance or gluttony,\nand yet a point of honor and discretion in another. Tiberius C\u00e6sar had\na huge _mullet_ presented him, which he sent to the market to be sold:\n\u201cand now,\u201d says he, \u201cmy masters,\u201d to some company with him, \u201cyou shall\nsee that either Apicius or Octavius will be the chapman for this fish.\u201d\nOctavius beat the price, and gave about thirty pounds sterling for it.\nNow, there was a great difference between Octavius, that bought it for\nhis luxury, and the _other_ that purchased it for a _compliment_ to\nTiberius. Precepts are idle, if we be not first taught what opinion\nwe are to have of the matter in question; whether it be _poverty_,\n_riches_, _disgrace_, _sickness_, _banishment_, etc. Let us therefore\nexamine them one by one; not what they are _called_, but what in truth\nthey _are_. And so for the _virtues_; it is to no purpose to set a high\nesteem upon prudence, _fortitude_, _temperance_, _justice_, if we do\nnot first know _what virtue is_; whether _one_ or _more_; or if he\nthat has _one_, has _all_; or _how they differ_.\nPrecepts are of great weight; and a few useful ones at hand do more\ntoward a happy life than whole volumes or cautions, that we know not\nwhere to find. These salutary precepts should be our daily meditation,\nfor they are the rules by which we ought to square our lives. When they\nare contracted into _sentences_, they strike the _affections_: whereas\n_admonition_ is only _blowing_ of the _coal_; it moves the vigor of the\nmind, and excites virtue: we have the thing already, but we know not\nwhere it lies. It is by precept that the understanding is nourished\nand augmented: the offices of prudence and justice are guided by them,\nand they lead us to the execution of our duties. A _precept_ delivered\nin _verse_ has a much greater effect than in _prose_: and those very\npeople that never think they have enough, let them but hear a sharp\nsentence against _avarice_, how will they clap and admire it, and bid\nopen defiance to money? So soon as we find the affections struck, we\nmust follow the blow; not with _syllogisms_ or quirks of _wit_; but\nwith _plain_ and _weighty reason_ and we must do it with _kindness_\ntoo, and _respect_ for \u201cthere goes a blessing along with counsels and\ndiscourses that are bent wholly upon the good of the hearer:\u201d and\nthose are still the most efficacious that take reason along with them;\nand tell us as well why we are to do this or that, as _what_ we are\nto do: for some understandings are weak, and need an instructor to\nexpound to them what is good and what is evil. It is a great virtue\nto _love_, to _give_, and to _follow good counsel_; if it does not\n_lead_ us to honesty, it does at least _prompt_ us to it. As several\nparts make up but one harmony, and the most agreeable music arises\nfrom discords; so should a wise man gather many acts, many precepts,\nand the examples of many arts, to inform his own life. Our forefathers\nhave left us in charge to avoid three things; _hatred_, _envy_, and\n_contempt_; now, it is hard to avoid envy and not incur _contempt_;\nfor in taking too much care not to usurp upon others, we become many\ntimes liable to be trampled upon ourselves. Some people are afraid of\nothers, because it is possible that others may be afraid of them: but\nlet us secure ourselves upon all hands; for _flattery_ is as dangerous\nas _contempt_. It is not to say, in case of admonition, I knew this\nbefore, for we know many things, but we do not think of them; so that\nit is the part of a _monitor_, not so much to _teach_ as to _mind_ us\nof our duties. Sometimes a man oversees that which lies just under his\nnose; otherwhile he is careless, or _pretends_ not to see it: we do all\nknow that friendship is sacred, and yet we violate it; and the greatest\nlibertine expects that his own wife should be honest.\nGood counsel is the most needful service that we can do to mankind;\nand if we give it to _many_, it will be sure to profit _some_: for of\nmany trials, some or other will undoubtedly succeed. He that places\na man in the possession of himself does a great thing; for wisdom\ndoes not show itself so much in precept as in life; in a firmness of\nmind and a mastery of appetite: it teaches us to _do_ as well as to\n_talk_: and to make our words and actions all of a color. If that fruit\nbe pleasantest which we gather from a tree of our own planting, how\nmuch greater delight shall we take in the growth and increase of good\nmanners of our own forming! It is an eminent mark of wisdom for a man\nto be always like himself. You shall have some that keep a thrifty\ntable, and lavish out upon building; profuse upon themselves, and\nforbid to others; niggardly at home, and lavish abroad. This diversity\nis vicious, and the effect of a dissatisfied and uneasy mind; whereas\nevery wise man lives by rule. This disagreement of purposes arises\nfrom hence, either that we do not propound to ourselves what we would\nbe at; or if we do, that we do not pursue it, but pass from one thing\nto another; and we do not only _change_ neither but return to the very\nthing which we had both quitted and condemned.\nIn all our undertakings, let us first examine our own strength; the\nenterprise next; and, thirdly, the persons with whom we have to do. The\nfirst point is most important; for we are apt to overvalue ourselves,\nand reckon that we can do more than indeed we can. One man sets up\nfor a speaker, and is out as soon as he opens his mouth; another\novercharges his estate, perhaps, or his body: a bashful man is not\nfit for public business: some again are too stiff and peremptory for\nthe court: many people are apt to fly out in their anger, nay, and in\na frolic too; if any sharp thing fall in their way, they will rather\nventure a neck than lose a jest. These people had better be quiet in\nthe world than busy. Let him that is naturally choleric and impatient\navoid all provocations, and those affairs also that multiply and draw\non more; and those also from which there is no retreat. When we may\ncome off at pleasure, and fairly hope to bring our matters to a period,\nit is well enough. If it so happen that a man be tied up to business,\nwhich he can neither loosen nor break off, let him imagine those\nshackles upon his mind to be irons upon his legs: they are troublesome\nat first; but when there is no remedy but patience, custom makes them\neasy to us, and necessity gives us courage. We are all slaves to\nfortune: some only in loose and golden chains, others in strait ones,\nand coarser: nay, and _they that bind us are slaves too themselves_;\nsome to honor, others to wealth; some to offices, and others to\ncontempt; some to their superiors, others to themselves: nay, life\nitself is a servitude: let us make the best of it then, and with our\nphilosophy mend our fortune. Difficulties may be softened, and heavy\nburdens disposed of to our ease. Let us covet nothing out of our reach,\nbut content ourselves with things hopeful and at hand; and without\nenvying the advantages of others; for greatness stands upon a craggy\nprecipice, and it is much safer and quieter living upon a level. How\nmany great men are forced to keep their station upon mere necessity;\nbecause they find there is no coming down from it but headlong? These\nmen should do well to fortify themselves against ill consequences by\nsuch virtues and meditations as may make them less solicitous for the\nfuture. The surest expedient in this case is to bound our desires, and\nto leave nothing to fortune which we may keep in our own power. Neither\nwill this course wholly compose us, but it shows us at worst the end of\nour troubles.\nIt is but a main point to take care that we propose nothing but what is\nhopeful and honest. For it will be equally troublesome to us, either\nnot to succeed, or to be ashamed of the success. Wherefore let us be\nsure not to admit any ill design into our heart; that we may lift up\npure hands to heaven and ask nothing which another shall be a loser by.\nLet us pray for a good mind, which is a wish to no man\u2019s injury. I\nwill remember always that I am a man, and then consider, that if I am\n_happy_, it will not last _always_; if _unhappy_, I may be _other_ if\nI please. I will carry my life in my hand, and deliver it up readily\nwhen it shall be called for. I will have a care of being a slave to\nmyself; for it is a perpetual, a shameful, and the heaviest of all\nservitudes: and this may be done by moderate desires. I will say to\nmyself, \u201cWhat is it that I labor, sweat, and solicit for, when it is\nbut very little that I want, and it will not be long that I will need\nany thing?\u201d He that would make a trial of the firmness of his mind, let\nhim set certain days apart for the practice of his virtues. Let him\nmortify himself with fasting, coarse clothes, and hard lodging; and\nthen say to himself, \u201cIs this the thing now that I was afraid of?\u201d In a\nstate of security, a man may thus prepare himself against hazards, and\nin plenty fortify himself against want. If you will have a man resolute\nwhen he comes to the push, train him up to it beforehand. The soldier\ndoes duty in peace, that he may be in breath when he comes to battle.\nHow many great and wise men have made experiment of their moderation\nby a practice of abstinence, to the highest degree of hunger and\nthirst; and convinced themselves that a man may fill his belly without\nbeing beholden to fortune; which never denies any of us wherewith to\nsatisfy our necessities, though she be never so angry! It is as easy\nto _suffer_ it _always_ as to _try_ it _once_; and it is no more than\nthousands of servants and poor people do every day in their lives. He\nthat would live happily, must neither trust to good fortune nor submit\nto bad: he must stand upon his guard against all assaults; he must\nstick to himself, without any dependence upon other people. Where\nthe mind is tinctured with philosophy, there is no place for grief,\nanxiety, or superfluous vexations. It is prepossessed with virtue to\nthe neglect of fortune, which brings us to a degree of security not\nto be disturbed. It is easier to give counsel than to take it; and\na common thing for one choleric man to condemn another. We may be\nsometimes earnest in advising, but not violent or tedious. Few words,\nwith gentleness and efficacy, are best: the misery is, that the wise\ndo not need counsel, and fools will not take it. A good man, it is\ntrue, delights in it; and it is a mark of folly and ill-nature to hate\nreproof.\nTo a friend I would be always frank and plain; and rather fail in the\nsuccess than be wanting in the matter of faith and trust. There are\nsome precepts that serve in common both to the rich and poor, but they\nare too general; as \u201cCure your avarice, and the work is done.\u201d It is\none thing not to desire money, and another thing not to understand\nhow to use it. In the choice of the persons we have to do withal, we\nshould see that they be worth our while; in the choice of our business,\nwe are to consult nature, and follow our inclinations. He that gives\nsober advice to a witty droll must look to have every thing turned into\nridicule. \u201cAs if you philosophers,\u201d says Marcellinus, \u201cdid not love\nyour whores and your guts as well as other people:\u201d and then he tells\nyou of such and such that were taken in the manner. We are all sick, I\nmust confess, and it is not for sick men to play the physicians; but\nit is yet lawful for a man in an hospital to discourse of the common\ncondition and distempers of the place. He that should pretend to teach\na madman how to speak, walk, and behave himself, were not he the most\nmad man of the two? He that directs the pilot, makes him move the\nhelm, order the sails so or so, and makes the best of a scant wind,\nafter this or that manner. And so should we do in our counsels.\nDo not tell me what a man should do in health or poverty, but show\nme the way to be either sound or rich. Teach me to master my vices:\nfor it is to no purpose, so long as I am under their government, to\ntell me what I must do when I am clear of it. In case of an avarice a\nlittle eased, a luxury moderated, a temerity restrained, a sluggish\nhumor quickened; precepts will then help us forward, and tutor us how\nto behave ourselves. It is the first and the main tie of a soldier his\nmilitary oath, which is an engagement upon him both of religion and\nhonor. In like manner, he that pretends to a happy life must first lay\na foundation of virtue, as a bond upon him, to live and die true to\nthat cause. We do not find felicity in the veins of the earth where we\ndig for gold, nor in the bottom of the sea where we fish for pearls,\nbut in a pure and untainted mind, which, if it were not holy, were not\nfit to entertain the Deity. \u201cHe that would be truly happy, must think\nhis own lot best, and so live with men, as considering that God sees\nhim, and so speak to God as if men heard him.\u201d\nCHAPTER VI.\nNO FELICITY LIKE PEACE OF CONSCIENCE.\n\u201cA good conscience is the testimony of a good life, and the reward\nof it.\u201d This is it that fortifies the mind against fortune, when a\nman has gotten the mastery of his passions; placed his treasure and\nsecurity within himself; learned to be content with his condition;\nand that death is no evil in itself, but only the end of man. He that\nhas dedicated his mind to virtue, and to the good of human society,\nwhereof he is a member, has consummated all that is either profitable\nor necessary for him to know or to do toward the establishment of his\npeace. Every man has a judge and a witness within himself of all the\ngood and ill that he does, which inspires us with great thoughts, and\nadministers to us wholesome counsels. We have a veneration for all the\nworks of Nature, the heads of rivers, and the springs of medicinal\nwaters; the horrors of groves and of caves strike us with an impression\nof religion and worship. To see a man fearless in dangers, untainted\nwith lusts, happy in adversity, composed in a tumult, and laughing at\nall those things which are generally either coveted or feared; all men\nmust acknowledge that this can be nothing else but a beam of divinity\nthat influences a mortal body. And this is it that carries us to the\ndisquisition of things divine and human; what the state of the world\nwas before the distribution of the first matter into parts; what power\nit was that drew order out of that confusion, and gave laws both to the\nwhole, and to every particle thereof; what that space is beyond the\nworld; and whence proceed the several operations of Nature.\nShall any man see the glory and order of the universe; so many\nscattered parts and qualities wrought into one mass; such a medley of\nthings, which are yet distinguished: the world enlightened, and the\ndisorders of it so wonderfully regulated; and shall he not consider\nthe Author and Disposer of all this; and whither we ourselves shall\ngo, when our souls shall be delivered from the slavery of our flesh?\nThe whole creation we see conforms to the dictates of Providence, and\nfollows God both as a governor and as a guide. A great, a good, and\na right mind, is a kind of divinity lodged in flesh, and may be the\nblessing of a slave as well as of a prince; it came from heaven, and to\nheaven it must return; and it is a kind of heavenly felicity, which a\npure and virtuous mind enjoys, in some degree, even upon earth: whereas\ntemples of honor are but empty names, which, probably, owe their\nbeginning either to ambition or to violence.\nI am strangely transported with the thoughts of eternity; nay, with\nthe belief of it; for I have a profound veneration for the opinions\nof great men, especially when they promise things so much to my\nsatisfaction: for they do promise them, though they do not prove them.\nIn the question of the immortality of the soul, it goes very far with\nme, a general consent to the opinion of a future reward and punishment;\nwhich meditation raises me to the contempt of this life, in hopes of\na better. But still, though we know that we have a soul; yet what the\nsoul is, how, and from whence, we are utterly ignorant: this only we\nunderstand, that all the good and ill we do is under the dominion of\nthe mind; that a clear conscience states us in an inviolable peace; and\nthat the greatest blessing in Nature is that which every honest man may\nbestow upon himself. The body is but the clog and prisoner of the mind;\ntossed up and down, and persecuted with punishments, violences, and\ndiseases; but the mind itself is sacred and eternal, and exempt from\nthe danger of all actual impression.\nProvided that we look to our consciences, no matter for opinion: let\nme deserve well, though I hear ill. The common people take stomach and\naudacity for the marks of magnanimity and honor; and if a man be soft\nand modest, they look upon him as an easy fop; but when they come once\nto observe the dignity of his mind in the equality and firmness of his\nactions; and that his external quiet is founded upon an internal peace,\nthe very same people who have him in esteem and admiration; for there\nis no man but approves of virtue, though but few pursue it; we see\nwhere it is, but we dare not venture to come at it: and the reason is,\nwe overvalue that which we must quit to obtain it.\nA good conscience fears no witnesses, but a guilty conscience is\nsolicitous even of solitude. If we do nothing but what is honest, let\nall the world know it; but if otherwise, what does it signify to have\nnobody else know it, so long as I know it myself? Miserable is he that\nslights that witness! Wickedness, it is true, may escape the law, but\nnot the conscience; for a private conviction is the first and the\ngreatest punishment to offenders; so that sin plagues itself; and the\nfear of vengeance pursues even those that escape the stroke of it.\nIt were ill for good men that iniquity may so easily evade the law,\nthe judge, and the execution, if Nature had not set up torments and\ngibbets in the consciences of transgressors. He that is guilty lives\nin perpetual terror; and while he expects to be punished, he punishes\nhimself; and whosoever deserves it expects it. What if he be not\ndetected? he is still in apprehension yet that he may be so. His sleeps\nare painful, and never secure; and he cannot speak of another man\u2019s\nwickedness without thinking of his own, whereas a good conscience is a\ncontinual feast.\nThose are the only certain and profitable delights, which arise from\nthe consciousness of a well-acted life; no matter for noise abroad,\nso long as we are quiet within: but if our passions be seditious,\nthat is enough to keep us waking without any other tumult. It is not\nthe posture of the body, or the composure of the bed, that will give\nrest to an uneasy mind: there is an impatient sloth that may be roused\nby action, and the vices of laziness must be cured by business. True\nhappiness is not to be found in excesses of wine, or of women, or in\nthe largest prodigalities of fortune; what she has given to me, she\nmay take away, but she shall not tear it from me; and, so long as it\ndoes not grow to me, I can part with it without pain. He that would\nperfectly know himself, let him set aside his money, his fortune, his\ndignity, and examine himself naked, without being put to learn from\nothers the knowledge of himself.\nIt is dangerous for a man too suddenly, or too easily, to believe\nhimself. Wherefore let us examine, observe, and inspect our own\nhearts, for we ourselves are our own greatest flatterers: we should\nevery night call ourselves to account, \u201cWhat infirmity have I mastered\nto-day? what passion opposed? what temptation resisted? what virtue\nacquired?\u201d Our vices will abate of themselves, if they be brought every\nday to the shrift. Oh the blessed sleep that follows such a diary! Oh\nthe tranquillity, liberty, and greatness of that mind that is a spy\nupon itself, and a private censor of its own manners! It is my custom\n(says our author) every night, so soon as the candle is out, to run\nover all the words and actions of the past day; and I let nothing\nescape me; for why should I fear the sight of my own errors, when I can\nadmonish and forgive myself? \u201cI was a little too hot in such a dispute:\nmy opinion might have been as well spared, for it gave offence, and\ndid no good at all. The thing was true, but all truths are not to be\nspoken at all times; I would I had held my tongue, for there is no\ncontending either with fools or our superiors. I have done ill, but it\nshall be so no more.\u201d If every man would but thus look into himself,\nit would be the better for us all. What can be more reasonable than\nthis daily review of a life that we cannot warrant for a moment? Our\nfate is set, and the first breath we draw is only the first motion\ntoward our last: one cause depends upon another; and the course of all\nthings, public and private, is but a long connection of providential\nappointments. There is a great variety in our lives, but all tends to\nthe same issue. Nature may use her own bodies as she pleases; but a\ngood man has this consolation, that nothing perishes which he can call\nhis own. It is a great comfort that we are only condemned to the same\nfate with the universe; the heavens themselves are mortal as well\nas our bodies; Nature has made us passive, and to suffer is our lot.\nWhile we are in flesh, every man has his chain and his clog, only it is\nlooser and lighter to one man than to another; and he is more at ease\nthat takes it up and carries it, than he that drags it. We are born, to\nlose and to perish, to hope and to fear, to vex ourselves and others;\nand there is no antidote against a common calamity but virtue; for \u201cthe\nfoundation of true joy is in the conscience.\u201d\nCHAPTER VII.\nA GOOD MAN CAN NEVER BE MISERABLE, NOR A WICKED MAN HAPPY.\nThere is not in the scale of nature a more inseparable connection\nof cause and effect, than in the case of happiness and virtue; nor\nanything that more naturally produces the one, or more necessarily\npresupposes the other. For what is it to be happy, but for a man to\ncontent himself with his lot, in a cheerful and quiet resignation to\nthe appointments of God? All the actions of our lives ought to be\ngoverned with respect to good and evil: and it is only reason that\ndistinguishes; by which reason we are in such manner influenced, as\nif a ray of the Divinity were dipt in a mortal body, and that is the\nperfection of mankind. It is true, we have not the eyes of eagles\nor the sagacity of hounds: nor if we had, could we pretend to value\nourselves upon anything which we have in common with brutes. What\nare we the better for that which is foreign to us, and may be given\nand taken away? As the beams of the sun irradiate the earth, and yet\nremain where they were; so is it in some proportion with a holy mind\nthat illustrates all our actions, and yet it adheres to its original.\nWhy do we not as well commend a horse for his glorious trappings, as a\nman for his pompous additions? How much a braver creature is a lion,\n(which by nature ought to be fierce and terrible) how much braver (I\nsay) in his natural horror than in his chains? so that everything in\nits pure nature pleases us best. It is not health, nobility, riches,\nthat can justify a wicked man: nor is it the want of all these that\ncan discredit a good one. That is the sovereign blessing, which makes\nthe possessor of it valuable without anything else, and him that wants\nit contemptible, though he had all the world besides. It is not the\npainting, gilding, or carving, that makes a good ship; but if she be\na nimble sailer, tight and strong to endure the seas; that is her\nexcellency. It is the edge and temper of the blade that makes a good\nsword, not the richness of the scabbard: and so it is not money or\npossessions, that makes a man considerable, but his virtue.\nIt is every man\u2019s duty to make himself profitable to mankind\u2014if he\ncan, to many\u2014if not, to fewer\u2014if not so neither, to his neighbor\u2014but,\nhowever, to himself. There are two republics: a great one, which is\nhuman nature; and a less, which is the place where we were born. Some\nserve both at a time, some only the greater, and some again only the\nless. The greater may be served in privacy, solitude, contemplation,\nand perchance that way better than any other; but it was the intent\nof Nature, however, that we should serve both. A good man may serve\nthe public, his friend, and himself in any station: if he be not for\nthe sword, let him take the gown; if the bar does not agree with him,\nlet him try the pulpit; if he be silenced abroad, let him give counsel\nat home, and discharge the part of a faithful friend and a temperate\ncompanion. When he is no longer a citizen, he is yet a man; but the\nwhole world is his country, and human nature never wants matter to work\nupon: but if nothing will serve a man in the _civil government_ unless\nhe be _prime minister_, or in the _field_ but to _command in chief_, it\nis his own fault.\nThe common soldier where he cannot use his hands, fights with his\nlooks, his example, his encouragement, his voice, and stands his ground\neven when he has lost his hands, and does service too with his very\nclamor, so that in any condition whatsoever, he still discharges the\nduty of a good patriot\u2014nay, he that spends his time well even in a\nretirement, gives a great example.\nWe may enlarge, indeed, or contract, according to the circumstances\nof time, place, or abilities; but above all things we must be sure to\nkeep ourselves in action, for he that is slothful is dead even while\nhe lives. Was there ever any state so desperate as that of Athens\nunder the thirty tyrants\u2014where it was capital to be honest, and the\nsenate-house was turned into a college of hangmen? Never was any\ngovernment so wretched and so hopeless; and yet Socrates at the same\ntime preached _temperance_ to the _tyrants_, and courage to the rest,\nand afterwards died an eminent example of faith and resolution, and a\nsacrifice for the common good.\nIt is not for a wise man to stand shifting and fencing with fortune,\nbut to oppose her barefaced, for he is sufficiently convinced that\nshe can do him no hurt; she may take away his servants, possessions,\ndignity, assault his body, put out his eyes, cut off his hands, and\nstrip him of all the external comforts of life. But what does all this\namount to more than the recalling of a trust which he has received,\nwith condition to deliver it up again upon demand? He looks upon\nhimself as precarious, and only lent to himself, and yet he does not\nvalue himself ever the less because he is not his own, but takes such\ncare as an honest man should do of a thing that is committed to him in\ntrust. Whensoever he that lent me myself and what I have, shall call\nfor all back again, it is not a loss but a restitution, and I must\nwillingly deliver up what most undeservedly was bestowed upon me, and\nit will become me to return my mind better than I received it.\nDemetrius, upon the taking of Megara, asked Stilpo, the philosopher,\nwhat he had lost. \u201cNothing,\u201d said he, \u201cfor I had all that I could call\nmy own about me.\u201d And yet the enemy had then made himself master of\nhis patrimony, his children, and his country; but these he looked upon\nas only adventitious goods, and under the command of fortune. Now, he\nthat neither lost any thing nor feared any thing in a public ruin, but\nwas safe and at peace in the middle of the flames, and in the heat of a\nmilitary intemperance and fury\u2014what violence or provocation imaginable\ncan put such a man as this out of the possession of himself? Walls\nand castles may be mined and battered, but there is no art or engine\nthat can subvert a steady mind. \u201cI have made my way,\u201d says Stilpo,\n\u201cthrough fire and blood\u2014what has become of my children I know not; but\nthese are transitory blessings, and servants that are bound to change\ntheir masters; what was my own before is my own still. Some have lost\ntheir estates, others their dear-bought mistresses, their commissions\nand offices: the usurers have lost their bonds and securities: but,\nDemetrius, for my part I have saved all, and do not imagine after\nall this, either that Demetrius is a conqueror, or that Stilpo is\novercome\u2014it is only thy fortune has been too hard for mine.\u201d\nAlexander took Babylon, Scipio took Carthage, the capitol was burnt;\nbut there is no fire or violence that can discompose a generous mind;\nand let us not take this character either for a chimera, for all ages\nafford some, though not many, instances of this elevated virtue.\nA good man does his duty, let it be never so painful, so hazardous, or\nnever so great a loss to him; and it is not all the money, the power,\nand the pleasure in the world; not any force of necessity, that can\nmake him wicked: he considers what he is to do, not what he is to\nsuffer, and will keep on his course, though there should be nothing\nbut gibbets and torments in the way. And in this instance of Stilpo,\nwho, when he had lost his country, his wife, his children, the town\non fire over his head, himself escaping very hardly and naked out of\nthe flames; \u201cI have saved all my goods,\u201d says he, \u201cmy justice, my\ncourage, my temperance, my prudence;\u201d accounting nothing his own, or\nvaluable, and showing how much easier it was to overcome a nation than\none wise man. It is a certain mark of a brave mind not to be moved\nby any accidents: the upper region of the air admits neither clouds\nnor tempests; the thunder, storms, and meteors, are formed below; and\nthis is the difference betwixt a mean and an exalted mind; the former\nis rude and tumultuary; the latter is modest, venerable, composed,\nand always quiet in its station. In brief, it is the conscience that\npronounces upon the man whether he be happy or miserable. But, though\nsacrilege and adultery be generally condemned, how many are there\nstill that do not so much as blush at the one, and in truth that\ntake a glory in the other? For nothing is more common than for great\nthieves to ride in triumph when the little ones are punished. But\nlet \u201cwickedness escape as it may at the bar, it never fails of doing\njustice upon itself; for every guilty person is his own hangman.\u201d\nCHAPTER VIII.\nTHE DUE CONTEMPLATION OF DIVINE PROVIDENCE IS THE CERTAIN CURE OF ALL\nMISFORTUNES.\nWhoever observes the world, and the order of it, will find all the\nmotions in it to be only vicissitudes of falling and rising; nothing\nextinguished, and even those things which seem to us to perish are in\ntruth but changed. The seasons go and return, day and night follow in\ntheir courses, the heavens roll, and Nature goes on with her work: all\nthings succeed in their turns, storms and calms; the law of Nature\nwill have it so, which we must follow and obey, accounting all things\nthat are done to be well done; so that what we cannot mend we must\nsuffer, and wait upon Providence without repining. It is the part of\na cowardly soldier to follow his commander groaning: but a generous\nman delivers himself up to God without struggling; and it is only\nfor a narrow mind to condemn the order of the world, and to propound\nrather the mending of Nature than of himself. No man has any cause\nof complaint against Providence, if that which is right pleases him.\nThose glories that appear fair to the eye, their lustre is but false\nand superficial; and they are only vanity and delusion: they are rather\nthe goods of a dream than a substantial possession: they may cozen us\nat a distance, but bring them once to the touch, they are rotten and\ncounterfeit. There are no greater wretches in the world than many of\nthose which the people take to be happy. Those are the only true and\nincorruptible comforts that will abide all trials, and the more we turn\nand examine them, the more valuable we find them; and the greatest\nfelicity of all is, not to stand in need of any. What is _poverty_? No\nman lives so poor as he was born. What is _pain_? It will either have\nan end itself, or make an end of us. In short, Fortune has no weapon\nthat reaches the mind: but the bounties of Providence are certain and\npermanent blessings; and they are the greater and the better, the\nlonger we consider them; that is to say, \u201cthe power of contemning\nthings terrible, and despising what the common people covet.\u201d In the\nvery methods of Nature we cannot but observe the regard that Providence\nhad to the good of mankind, even in the disposition of the world, in\nproviding so amply for our maintenance and satisfaction. It is not\npossible for us to comprehend what the Power is which has made all\nthings: some few sparks of that Divinity are discovered, but infinitely\nthe greater part of it lies hid. We are all of us, however, thus far\nagreed, first, in the acknowledgement and belief of that almighty\nBeing; and, secondly, that we are to ascribe to it all majesty and\ngoodness.\n\u201cIf there be a Providence,\u201d say some, \u201chow comes it to pass that\ngood men labor under affliction and adversity, and wicked men enjoy\nthemselves in ease and plenty?\u201d My answer is, that God deals by us as a\ngood father does by his children; he tries us, he hardens us, and fits\nus for himself. He keeps a strict hand over those that he loves; and by\nthe rest he does as we do by our slaves; he lets them go on in license\nand boldness.\nAs the master gives his most hopeful scholars the hardest lessons, so\ndoes God deal with the most generous spirits; and the cross encounters\nof fortune we are not to look upon as a cruelty, but as a contest: the\nfamiliarity of dangers brings us to the contempt of them, and that part\nis strongest which is most exercised: the seaman\u2019s hand is callous, the\nsoldier\u2019s arm is strong, and the tree that is most exposed to the wind\ntakes the best root: there are people that live in a perpetual winter,\nin extremity of frost and penury, where a cave, a lock of straw, or a\nfew leaves, is all their covering, and wild beasts their nourishment;\nall this by custom is not only made tolerable, but when it is once\ntaken up upon necessity, by little and little, it becomes pleasant to\nthem. Why should we then count that condition of life a calamity which\nis the lot of many nations? There is no state of life so miserable\nbut that there are in it remissions, diversions, nay, and delights\ntoo; such is the benignity of Nature towards us, even in the severest\naccidents of human life. There were no living if adversity should hold\non as it begins, and keep up the force of the first impression. We are\napt to murmur at many things as great evils, that have nothing at all\nof evil in them besides the complaint, which we should more reasonably\ntake up against ourselves. If I be sick, it is part of my fate; and\nfor other calamities, they are usual things; they ought to be; nay,\nwhich is more, they must be, for they come by divine appointment. So\nthat we should not only submit to God, but assent to him, and obey him\nout of _duty_, even if there were no _necessity_. All those terrible\nappearances that make us groan and tremble are but the tribute of life;\nwe are neither to wish, nor to ask, nor to hope to escape them; for\nit is a kind of dishonesty to pay a tribute unwillingly. Am I troubled\nwith the stone, or afflicted with continual losses? nay, is my body in\ndanger? All this is no more than what I prayed for when I prayed for\nold age. All these things are as familiar in a long life, as dust and\ndirt in a long way. Life is a warfare; and what brave man would not\nrather choose to be in a tent than in shambles? Fortune does like a\nswordsman, she scorns to encounter a fearful man: there is no honor in\nthe victory where there is no danger in the way to it; she tries Mucius\nby _fire_; Rutilius by _exile_; Socrates by _poison_; Cato by _death_.\nIt is only in adverse fortune, and in bad times, that we find great\nexamples. Mucius thought himself happier with his hand in the flame,\nthan if it had been in the bosom of his mistress. Fabricius took more\npleasure in eating the roots of his own planting than in all the\ndelicacies of luxury and expense. Shall we call Rutilius miserable,\nwhom his very enemies have adored? who, upon a glorious and a public\nprinciple, chose rather to lose his country than to return from\nbanishment? the only man that denied any thing to Sylla the dictator,\nwho recalled him. Nor did he only refuse to come, but drew himself\nfurther off: \u201cLet them,\u201d says he, \u201cthat think banishment a misfortune,\nlive slaves at Rome, under the imperial cruelties of Sylla: he that\nsets a price upon the heads of senators; and after a law of his own\ninstitution against cut-throats, becomes the greatest himself.\u201d Is it\nnot better for a man to live in exile abroad than to be massacred at\nhome? In suffering for virtue, it is not the torment but the cause,\nthat we are to consider; and the more pain, the more renown. When any\nhardship befalls us, we must look upon it as an act of Providence,\nwhich many times suffers particulars to be wounded for the conservation\nof the whole: beside that, God chastises some people under an\nappearance of blessing them, turning their prosperity to their ruin as\na punishment for abusing his goodness. And we are further to consider,\nthat many a good man is afflicted, only to teach others to suffer; for\nwe are born for example; and likewise that where men are contumacious\nand refractory, it pleases God many times to cure greater evils by\nless, and to turn our miseries to our advantage.\nHow many casualties and difficulties are there that we dread as\ninsupportable mischiefs, which, upon farther thoughts, we find to\nbe mercies and benefits? as banishment, poverty, loss of relations,\nsickness, disgrace. Some are cured by the lance; by fire, hunger,\nthirst; taking out of bones, lopping off limbs, and the like: nor do\nwe only fear things that are many times beneficial to us; but, on the\nother side, we hanker after and pursue things that are deadly and\npernicious: we are poisoned in the very pleasure of our luxury, and\nbetrayed to a thousand diseases by the indulging of our palate. To lose\na child or a limb, is only to part with what we have received, and\nNature may do what she pleases with her own. We are frail ourselves,\nand we have received things transitory\u2014that which was given us may be\ntaken away\u2014calamity tries virtue as the fire does gold, nay, he that\nlives most at ease is only delayed, not dismissed, and his portion is\nto come. When we are visited with sickness or other afflictions we are\nnot to murmur as if we were ill used\u2014it is a mark of the general\u2019s\nesteem when he puts us upon a post of danger: we do not say \u201cMy\ncaptain uses me ill,\u201d but \u201che does me honor;\u201d and so should we say that\nare commanded to encounter difficulties, for this is our case with God\nAlmighty.\nWhat was Regulus the worse, because Fortune made choice of him for\nan eminent instance both of faith and patience? He was thrown into a\ncase of wood stuck with pointed nails, so that which way soever he\nturned his body, it rested upon his wounds; his eyelids were cut off\nto keep him waking; and yet Mec\u00e6nas was not happier upon his _bed_\nthan Regulus upon his _torments_. Nay, the world is not yet grown so\nwicked as not to prefer Regulus before Mec\u00e6nas: and can any man take\nthat to be an evil of which Providence accounted this brave man worthy?\n\u201cIt has pleased God,\u201d says he, \u201cto single me out for an experiment of\nthe force of human nature.\u201d No man knows his own strength or value but\nby being put to the proof. The pilot is tried in a storm; the soldier\nin a battle; the rich man knows not how to behave himself in poverty:\nhe that has lived in popularity and applause, knows not how he would\nbear infamy and reproach: nor he that never had children how he would\nbear the loss of them. Calamity is the occasion of virtue, and a spur\nto a great mind. The very apprehension of a wound startles a man when\nhe first bears arms; but an old soldier bleeds boldly, because he\nknows that a man may lose blood, and yet win the day. Nay, many times\na calamity turns to our advantage; and great ruins have but made way\nto greater glories. The crying out of _fire_ has many times quieted\na fray, and the interposing of a wild beast has parted the thief and\nthe traveller; for we are not at leisure for less mischiefs while we\nare under the apprehensions of greater. One man\u2019s life is saved by a\ndisease: another is arrested, and taken out of the way, just when his\nhouse was falling upon his head.\nTo show now that the favors or the crosses of fortune, and the\naccidents of sickness and of health, are neither good nor evil, God\npermits them indifferently both to good and evil men. \u201cIt is hard,\u201d you\nwill say, \u201cfor a virtuous man to suffer all sorts of misery, and for\na wicked man not only to go free, but to enjoy himself at pleasure.\u201d\nAnd is it not the same thing for men of prostituted impudence and\nwickedness to sleep in a whole skin, when men of honor and honesty\nbear arms; lie in the trenches, and receive wounds? or for the vestal\nvirgins to rise in the night to their prayers, when common strumpets\nlie stretching themselves in their beds? We should rather say with\nDemetrius, \u201cIf I had known the will of Heaven before I was called to\nit, I would have offered myself.\u201d If it be the pleasure of God to take\nmy children, I have brought them up to that end: if my fortune, any\npart of my body, or my life, I would rather present it than yield it\nup: I am ready to part with all, and to suffer all; for I know that\nnothing comes to pass but what God appoints: our fate is decreed, and\nthings do not so much happen, as in their due time proceed, and every\nman\u2019s portion of joy and sorrow is predetermined.\nThere is nothing falls amiss to a good man that can be charged upon\nProvidence; for wicked actions, lewd thoughts, ambitious projects,\nblind lusts, and insatiable avarice\u2014against all these he is armed by\nthe benefit of reason: and do we expect now that God should look to\nour luggage too? (I mean our bodies.) Demetrius discharged himself of\nhis treasure as the clog and burden of his mind: shall we wonder then\nif God suffers that to befall a good man which a good man sometimes\ndoes to himself? I lose a son, and why not, when it may sometimes so\nfall out that I myself may kill him? Suppose he be banished by an order\nof state, is it not the same thing with a man\u2019s voluntarily leaving\nhis country never to return? Many afflictions may befall a good man,\nbut no evil, for contraries will never incorporate\u2014all the rivers in\nthe world are never able to change the taste or quality of the sea.\nPrudence and religion are above accidents, and draw good out of every\nthing\u2014affliction keeps a man in use, and makes him strong, patient, and\nhardy. Providence treats us like a generous father, and brings us up\nto labors, toils, and dangers; whereas the indulgence of a fond mother\nmakes us weak and spiritless.\nGod loves us with a masculine love, and turns us loose to injuries\nand indignities: he takes delight to see a brave and a good man\nwrestling with evil fortune, and yet keeping himself upon his legs,\nwhen the whole world is in disorder about him. And are not we ourselves\ndelighted, to see a bold fellow press with his lance upon a boar or\nlion? and the constancy and resolution of the action is the grace and\ndignity of the spectacle. No man can be happy that does not stand firm\nagainst all contingencies; and say to himself in all extremities, \u201cI\nshould have been content, if it might have been so or so, but since it\nis otherwise determined, God will provide better.\u201d The more we struggle\nwith our necessities, we draw the knot the harder, and the worse it\nis with us: and the more a bird flaps and flutters in the snare, the\nsurer she is caught: so that the best way is to submit and lie still,\nunder this double consideration, that \u201cthe proceedings of God are\nunquestionable, and his decrees are not to be resisted.\u201d\nCHAPTER IX.\nOF LEVITY OF MIND, AND OTHER IMPEDIMENTS OF A HAPPY LIFE.\nNow, to sum up what is already delivered, we have showed what happiness\nis, and wherein it consists: that it is founded upon wisdom and virtue;\nfor we must first know what we ought to do, and then live according to\nthat knowledge. We have also discoursed the helps of philosophy and\nprecept toward a _happy life_; the blessing of a good conscience; that\na good man can never be miserable, nor a wicked man happy; nor any\nman unfortunate that cheerfully submits to Providence. We shall now\nexamine, how it comes to pass that, when the certain way to happiness\nlies so fair before us, men will yet steer their course on the other\nside, which as manifestly leads to ruin.\nThere are some that live without any design at all, and only pass\nin the world like straws upon a river; they do not go, but they are\ncarried. Others only deliberate upon the parts of life, and not upon\nthe whole, which is a great error: for there is no disposing of the\ncircumstances of it, unless we first propound the main scope. How shall\nany man take his aim without a mark? or what wind will serve him that\nis not yet resolved upon his port? We live as it were by chance, and\nby chance we are governed. Some there are that torment themselves\nafresh with the memory of what is past: \u201cLord! what did I endure? never\nwas any man in my condition; everybody gave me over; my very heart\nwas ready to break,\u201d etc. Others, again, afflict themselves with the\napprehension of evils to come; and very ridiculously: for the _one_\ndoes not _now_ concern us, and the _other_ not _yet_: beside that,\nthere may he remedies for mischiefs likely to happen; for they give us\nwarning by signs and symptoms of their approach. Let him that would be\nquiet take heed not to provoke men that are in power, but live without\ngiving offence; and if we cannot make all great men our friends, it\nwill suffice to keep them from being our enemies. This is a thing we\nmust avoid, as a mariner would do a storm.\nA rash seaman never considers what wind blows, or what course he\nsteers, but runs at a venture, as if he would brave the rocks and the\neddies; whereas he that is careful and considerate, informs himself\nbeforehand where the danger lies, and what weather it is like to be:\nhe consults his compass, and keeps aloof from those places that are\ninfamous for wrecks and miscarriages; so does a wise man in the common\nbusiness of life; he keeps out of the way from those that may do him\nhurt: but it is a point of prudence not to let them take notice that\nhe does it on purpose; for that which a man shuns he tacitly condemns.\nLet him have a care also of _listeners_, _newsmongers_, and _meddlers_\nin other people\u2019s matters; for their discourse is commonly of such\nthings as are never profitable, and most commonly dangerous either to\nbe spoken or heard.\nLevity of mind is a great hindrance of repose, and the very change\nof wickedness is an addition to the wickedness itself; for it is\ninconstancy added to iniquity; we relinquish the thing we sought, and\nthen we take it up again; and so divide our lives between our lust and\nour repentances. From one appetite we pass to another, not so much\nupon choice as for change; and there is a check of conscience that\ncasts a damp upon all our unlawful pleasures, which makes us lose the\nday in expectation of the night, and the night itself for fear of the\napproaching light.\nSome people are _never_ at quiet, others are _always_ so, and they are\nboth to blame: for that which looks like vivacity and industry in the\none is only a restlessness and agitation; and that which passes in the\nother for moderation and reserve is but a drowsy and unactive sloth.\nLet motion and rest both take their turns, according to the order of\nNature, which makes both the day and the night. Some are perpetually\nshifting from one thing to another; others, again, make their whole\nlife but a kind of uneasy sleep: some lie tossing and turning until\nvery weariness brings them to rest; others, again, I cannot so properly\ncall inconstant as lazy. There are many proprieties and diversities of\nvice; but it is one never-failing effect of it to live displeased. We\ndo all of us labor under inordinate desires; we are either timorous,\nand dare not venture, or venturing we do not succeed; or else we cast\nourselves upon uncertain hopes, where we are perpetually solicitous,\nand in suspense. In this distraction we are apt to propose to ourselves\nthings dishonest and hard; and when we have taken great pains to no\npurpose, we come then to repent of our undertakings: we are afraid to\ngo on, and we can neither master our appetites nor obey them: we live\nand die restless and irresolute; and, which is worst of all, when we\ngrow weary of the public, and betake ourselves to solitude for relief,\nour minds are sick and wallowing, and the very house and walls are\ntroublesome to us; we grow impatient and ashamed of ourselves, and\nsuppress our inward vexation until it breaks our heart for want of\nvent. This is it that makes us sour and morose, envious of others, and\ndissatisfied with ourselves; until at last, betwixt our troubles for\nother people\u2019s successes and the despair of our own, we fall foul upon\nFortune and the times, and get into a corner perhaps, where we sit\nbrooding over our own disquiets. In these dispositions there is a kind\nof pruriginous fancy, that makes some people take delight in labor and\nuneasiness, like the clawing of an itch until the blood starts.\nThis is it that puts us upon rambling voyages; one while by land; but\nstill disgusted with the present: the town pleases us to-day, the\ncountry to-morrow: the splendors of the court at one time, the horrors\nof a wilderness at another, but all this while we carry our plague\nabout us; for it is not the place we are weary of, but ourselves. Nay,\nour weakness extends to everything; for we are impatient equally of\ntoil and of pleasure. This trotting of the ring, and only treading\nthe same steps over and over again, has made many a man lay violent\nhands upon himself. It must be the change of the mind, not of the\nclimate, that will remove the heaviness of the heart; our vices go\nalong with us, and we carry in ourselves the causes of our disquiets.\nThere is a great weight lies upon us, and the bare shocking of it\nmakes it the more uneasy; changing of countries, in this case, is not\ntravelling, but wandering. We must keep on our course, if we would gain\nour journey\u2019s end. \u201cHe that cannot live happily anywhere, will live\nhappily nowhere.\u201d What is a man the better for travelling? as if his\ncares could not find him out wherever he goes? Is there any retiring\nfrom the fear of death, or of torments? or from those difficulties\nwhich beset a man wherever he is? It is only philosophy that makes the\nmind invincible, and places us out of the reach of fortune, so that\nall her arrows fall short of us. This it is that reclaims the rage of\nour lusts, and sweetens the anxiety of our fears. Frequent changing of\nplaces or councils, shows an instability of mind; and we must fix the\nbody before we can fix the soul. We can hardly stir abroad, or look\nabout us, without encountering something or other that revives our\nappetites. As he that would cast off an unhappy love avoids whatsoever\nmay put him in mind of the person, so he that would wholly deliver\nhimself from his beloved lusts must shun all objects that may put them\nin his head again, and remind him of them. We travel, as children run\nup and down after strange sights, for novelty, not profit; we return\nneither the better nor the sounder; nay, and the very agitation hurts\nus. We learn to call towns and places by their names, and to tell\nstories of mountains and of rivers; but had not our time been better\nspent in the study of wisdom and of virtue? in the learning of what\nis already discovered, and in the quest of things not yet found out?\nIf a man break his leg, or strain his ankle, he sends presently for a\nsurgeon to set all right again, and does not take horse upon it, or put\nhimself on ship-board; no more does the change of place work upon our\ndisordered minds than upon our bodies. It is not the place, I hope,\nthat makes either an orator or a physician. Will any man ask upon the\nroad, Pray, which is the way to prudence, to justice, to temperance,\nto fortitude? No matter whither any man goes that carries his\naffections along with him. He that would make his travels delightful\nmust make himself a temperate companion.\nA great traveller was complaining that he was never the better for his\ntravels; \u201cThat is very true,\u201d said Socrates, \u201cbecause you travelled\nwith yourself.\u201d Now, had not he better have made himself another man\nthan to transport himself to another place? It is no matter what\nmanners we find anywhere; so long as we carry our own. But we have all\nof us a natural curiosity of seeing fine sights, and of making new\ndiscoveries, turning over antiquities, learning the customs of nations,\netc. We are never quiet; to-day we seek an office, to-morrow we are\nsick of it. We divide our lives betwixt a dislike of the present and a\ndesire of the future: but he that lives as he should, orders himself\nso, as neither to fear nor to wish for to-morrow; if it comes, it is\nwelcome; but if not, there is nothing lost; for that which is come, is\nbut the same over again with what is past. As levity is a pernicious\nenemy to quiet, so pertinacity is a great one too. The one changes\nnothing, the other sticks to nothing; and which of the two is the\nworse, may be a question. It is many times seen, that we beg earnestly\nfor those things, which, if they were offered us, we would refuse; and\nit is but just to punish this easiness of asking with an equal facility\nof granting. There are some things we would be thought to desire, which\nwe are so far from desiring that we dread them. \u201cI shall tire you,\u201d\nsays one, in the middle of a tedious story. \u201cNay, pray be pleased to\ngo on,\u201d we cry, though we wish his tongue out at half-way: nay, we do\nnot deal candidly even with God himself. We should say to ourselves\nin these cases, \u201cThis I have drawn upon myself. I could never be quiet\nuntil I had gotten this woman, this place, this estate, this honor, and\nnow see what is come of it.\u201d\nOne sovereign remedy against all misfortunes is constancy of mind: the\nchanging of parties and countenances looks as if a man were driven with\nthe wind. Nothing can be above him that is above fortune. It is not\nviolence, reproach, contempt, or whatever else from without, that can\nmake a wise man quit his ground: but he is proof against calamities,\nboth great and small: only our error is, that what we cannot do\nourselves, we think nobody else can; so that we judge of the wise by\nthe measures of the weak. Place me among princes or among beggars, the\none shall not make me proud, nor the other ashamed. I can take as sound\na sleep in a barn as in a palace, and a bundle of hay makes me as good\na lodging as a bed of down. Should every day succeed to my wish, it\nshould not transport me; nor would I think myself miserable if I should\nnot have one quiet hour in my life. I will not transport myself with\neither pain or pleasure; but yet for all that, I could wish that I had\nan easier game to play, and that I were put rather to moderate my joys\nthan my sorrows. If I were an imperial prince, I had rather take than\nbe taken; and yet I would bear the same mind under the chariot of my\nconqueror that I had in my own. It is no great matter to trample upon\nthose things that are most coveted or feared by the common people.\nThere are those that will laugh upon the wheel, and cast themselves\nupon a certain death, only upon a transport of love, perhaps anger,\navarice, or revenge; how much more then upon an instinct of virtue,\nwhich is invincible and steady! If a short obstinacy of mind can do\nthis, how much more shall a composed and deliberate virtue, whose force\nis equal and perpetual.\nTo secure ourselves in this world, first, we must aim at nothing that\nmen count worth the wrangling for. Secondly, we must not value the\npossession of any thing which even a common thief would think worth the\nstealing. A man\u2019s body is no booty. Let the way be never so dangerous\nfor robberies, the poor and the naked pass quietly. A plain-dealing\nsincerity of manners makes a man\u2019s life happy, even in despite of scorn\nand contempt, which is every clear man\u2019s fate. But we had better yet\nbe contemned for simplicity than lie perpetually upon the torture of\na counterfeit; provided that care be taken not to confound simplicity\nwith negligence; and it is, moreover, an uneasy life that of a\ndisguise; for a man to seem to be what he is not, to keep a perpetual\nguard upon himself, and to live in fear of a discovery. He takes every\nman that looks upon him for a spy, over and above the trouble of being\nput to play another man\u2019s part. It is a good remedy in some cases for\na man to apply himself to civil affairs and public business; and yet,\nin this state of life too, what betwixt ambition and calumny, it is\nhardly safe to be honest. There are, indeed, some cases wherein a wise\nman will give way; but let him not yield over easily neither; if he\nmarches off, let him have a care of his honor, and make his retreat\nwith his sword in his hand, and his face to the enemy. Of all others, a\nstudious life is the least tiresome: it makes us easy to ourselves and\nto others, and gains us both friends and reputation.\nCHAPTER X.\nHE THAT SETS UP HIS REST UPON CONTINGENCIES SHALL NEVER BE QUIET.\nNever pronounce any man happy that depends upon fortune for his\nhappiness; for nothing can be more preposterous than to place the\ngood of a reasonable creature in unreasonable things. If I have lost\nany thing, it was adventitious; and the less money, the less trouble;\nthe less favor, the less envy; nay, even in those cases that put us\nout of their wits, it is not the loss itself, but the opinion of the\nloss, that troubles us. It is a common mistake to account those things\nnecessary that are superfluous, and to depend upon fortune for the\nfelicity of life, which arises only from virtue. There is no trusting\nto her smiles; the sea swells and rages in a moment, and the ships are\nswallowed at night, in the very place where they sported themselves in\nthe morning. And fortune has the same power over princes that it has\nover empires, over nations that it has over cities, and the same power\nover cities that it has over private men. Where is that estate that may\nnot be followed upon the heel with famine and beggary? that dignity\nwhich the next moment may not be laid in the dust? that kingdom that is\nsecure from desolation and ruin? The period of all things is at hand,\nas well that which casts out the fortunate as the other that delivers\nthe unhappy; and that which may fall out at any time may fall out this\nvery day. What _shall_ come to pass I know not, but what _may_ come to\npass I know: so that I will despair of nothing, but expect everything;\nand whatsoever Providence remits is clear gain. Every moment, if it\nspares me, deceives me; and yet in some sort it does not deceive me;\nfor though I know that any thing may happen, yet I know likewise\nthat everything will not. I will hope the best, and provide for the\nworst. Methinks we should not find so much fault with Fortune for her\ninconstancy when we ourselves suffer a change every moment that we\nlive; only other changes make more noise, and this steals upon us like\nthe shadow upon a dial, every jot as certainly, but more insensibly.\nThe burning of Lyons may serve to show us that we are never safe, and\nto arm us against all surprises. The terror of it must needs be great,\nfor the calamity is almost without example. If it had been fired by an\nenemy, the flame would have left some further mischief to have been\ndone by the soldiers; but to be wholly consumed, we have not heard of\nmany earthquakes so pernicious: so many rarities to be destroyed in\none night; and in the depth of peace to suffer an outrage beyond the\nextremity of war; who would believe it? but twelve hours betwixt so\nfair a city and none at all! It was laid in ashes in less time than it\nwould require to tell the story.\nTo stand unshaken in such a calamity is hardly to be expected, and\nour wonder can but be equal to our grief. Let this accident teach us\nto provide against all possibilities that fall within the power of\nfortune. All external things are under her dominion: one while she\ncalls our hands to her assistance; another while she contents herself\nwith her own force, and destroys us with mischiefs of which we cannot\nfind the author. No time, place, or condition, is excepted; she makes\nour very pleasures painful to us; she makes war upon us in the depth of\npeace, and turns the means of our security into an occasion of fear;\nshe turns a friend into an enemy, and makes a foe of a companion; we\nsuffer the effects of war without any adversary; and rather than fail,\nour felicity shall be the cause of our destruction. Lest we should\neither forget or neglect her power, every day produces something\nextraordinary. She persecutes the most temperate with sickness, the\nstrongest constitutions with the phthisis; she brings the innocent\nto punishment, and the most retired she assaults with tumults. Those\nglories that have grown up with many ages, with infinite labor and\nexpense, and under the favor of many auspicious providences, one day\nscatters and brings to nothing. He that pronounced a day, nay, an hour,\nsufficient for the destruction of the greatest empire, might have\nfallen to a moment.\nIt were some comfort yet to the frailty of mankind and of human\naffairs, if things might but decay as slowly as they rise; but they\ngrow by degrees, and they fall to ruin in an instant. There is no\nfelicity in anything either private or public; men, nations, and\ncities, have all their fates and periods; our very entertainments are\nnot without terror, and our calamity rises there where we least expect\nit. Those kingdoms that stood the shock both of foreign wars and civil,\ncome to destruction without the sight of an enemy. Nay, we are to dread\nour peace and felicity more than violence, because we are here taken\nunprovided; unless in a state of peace we do the duty of men in war,\nand say to ourselves, _Whatsoever may be, will be_. I am to-day safe\nand happy in the love of my country; I am to-morrow banished: to-day in\npleasure, peace, health; to-morrow broken upon a wheel, led in triumph,\nand in the agony of sickness. Let us therefore prepare for a shipwreck\nin the port, and for a tempest in a calm. One violence drives me from\nmy country, another ravishes that from me; and that very place where\na man can hardly pass this day for a crowd may be to-morrow a desert.\nWherefore let us set before our eyes the whole condition of human\nnature, and consider as well what _may_ happen as what commonly _does_.\nThe way to make future calamities easy to us in the sufferance, is to\nmake them familiar to us in the contemplation. How many cities in Asia,\nAchaia, Assyria, Macedonia, have been swallowed up by earthquakes?\nnay, whole countries are lost, and large provinces laid under water;\nbut time brings all things to an end; for all the works of mortals\nare mortal; all possessions and their possessors are uncertain and\nperishable; and what wonder is it to lose anything at any time, when we\nmust one day lose all?\nThat which we call our own is but lent us; and what we have received\n_gratis_ we must return without complaint. That which Fortune gives\nus this hour she may take away the next; and he that trusts to her\nfavors, shall either find himself deceived, or if he be not, he will\nat least be troubled, because he may be so. There is no defence in\nwalls, fortifications, and engines, against the power of fortune; we\nmust provide ourselves within, and when we are safe there, we are\ninvincible; we may be battered, but not taken. She throws her gifts\namong us, and we sweat and scuffle for them, never considering how few\nare the better for that which is expected by all. Some are transported\nwith what they get; others tormented for what they miss; and many\ntimes there is a leg or an arm broken in a contest for a counter. She\ngives us honors, riches, favors, only to take them away again, either\nby violence or treachery: so that they frequently turn to the damage\nof the receiver. She throws out baits for us, and sets traps as we do\nfor birds and beasts; her bounties are snares and lime-twigs to us; we\nthink that we take, but we are taken. If they had any thing in them\nthat was substantial, they would some time or other fill and quiet us;\nbut they serve only to provoke our appetite without anything more than\npomp and show to allay it. But the best of it is, if a man cannot mend\nhis fortune, he may yet mend his manners, and put himself so far out of\nher reach, that whether she gives or takes, it shall be all one to us;\nfor we are neither the greater for the one, nor the less for the other.\nWe call this a dark room, or that a light one; when it is in itself\nneither the one nor the other, but only as the day and the night render\nit. And so it is in riches, strength of body, beauty, honor, command:\nand likewise in pain, sickness, banishment, death: which are in\nthemselves middle and indifferent things, and only good or bad as they\nare influenced by virtue. To weep, lament, and groan, is to renounce\nour duty; and it is the same weakness on the other side to exult and\nrejoice. I would rather make my fortune than expect it; being neither\ndepressed with her injuries, nor dazzled with her favors. When Zeno was\ntold, that all his goods were drowned; \u201cWhy then,\u201d says he, \u201cFortune\nhas a mind to make me a philosopher.\u201d It is a great matter for a man to\nadvance his mind above her threats or flatteries; for he that has once\ngotten the better of her is safe forever.\nIt is some comfort yet to the unfortunate, that great men lie under the\nlash for company; and that death spares the palace no more than the\ncottage, and that whoever is above me has a power also above him. Do\nwe not daily see funerals without trouble, princes deposed, countries\ndepopulated, towns sacked; without so much as thinking how soon it may\nbe our own case? whereas, if we would but prepare and arm ourselves\nagainst the iniquities of fortune, we should never be surprised.\nWhen we see any man banished, beggared, tortured, we are to account,\nthat though the mischief fell upon another, it was levelled at us. What\nwonder is it if, of so many thousands of dangers that are constantly\nhovering about us, one comes to hit us at last? That which befalls any\nman, may befall every man; and then it breaks the force of a present\ncalamity to provide against the future. Whatsoever our lot is, we must\nbear it: as suppose it be contumely, cruelty, fire, sword, pains,\ndiseases, or a prey to wild beasts; there is no struggling, nor any\nremedy but moderation. It is to no purpose to bewail any part of our\nlife, when life itself is miserable throughout; and the whole flux of\nit only a course of transition from one misfortune to another.\nA man may as well wonder that he should be cold in winter, sick at sea,\nor have his bones clatter together in a wagon, as at the encounter\nof ill accidents and crosses in the passage of human life; and it is\nin vain to run away from fortune, as if there were any hiding-place\nwherein she could not find us; or to expect any quiet from her; for she\nmakes life a perpetual state of war, without so much as any respite or\ntruce. This we may conclude upon, that her empire is but imaginary, and\nthat whosoever serves her, makes himself a voluntary slave; for \u201cthe\nthings that are often contemned by the inconsiderate, and always by the\nwise, are in themselves neither good nor evil:\u201d as pleasure and pains;\nprosperity and adversity; which can only operate upon our outward\ncondition, without any proper and necessary effect upon the mind.\nCHAPTER XI.\nA SENSUAL LIFE IS A MISERABLE LIFE.\nThe sensuality that we here treat of falls naturally under the head of\nluxury; which extends to all the excesses of gluttony, lust, effeminacy\nof manners; and, in short, to whatsoever concerns the overgreat care of\nthe carcass.\nTo begin now with the pleasures of the palate, (which deal with us like\nEgyptian thieves, that strangle those they embrace), what shall we say\nof the luxury of Nomentanus and Apicius, that entertained their very\nsouls in the kitchen: they have the choicest music for their ears; the\nmost diverting spectacles for their eyes; the choicest variety of meats\nand drinks for their palates. What is all this, I say, but a _merry\nmadness_? It is true, they have their delights, but not without heavy\nand anxious thoughts, even in their very enjoyments, beside that, they\nare followed with repentance, and their frolics are little more than\nthe laughter of so many people out of their wits. Their felicities are\nfull of disquiet, and neither sincere nor well grounded: but they have\nneed of one pleasure to support another; and of new prayers to forgive\nthe errors of their former. Their life must needs be wretched that get\nwith great pains what they keep with greater.\nOne diversion overtakes another; hope excites hope; ambition begets\nambition; so that they only change the matter of their miseries,\nwithout seeking any end of them; and shall never be without either\nprosperous or unhappy causes of disquiet. What if a body might have\nall the pleasures in the world for the asking? who would so much unman\nhimself, as by accepting of them, to desert his soul, and become a\nperpetual slave to his senses? Those false and miserable palates, that\njudge of meats by the price and difficulty, not by the healthfulness\nof taste, they vomit that they may eat, and they eat that they may\nfetch it up again. They cross the seas for rarities, and when they have\nswallowed them, they will not so much as give them time to digest.\nWheresoever Nature has placed men, she has provided them aliment: but\nwe rather choose to irritate hunger by expense than to allay it at an\neasier rate.\nWhat is it that we plow the seas for; or arm ourselves against men and\nbeasts? To what end do we toil, and labor, and pile bags upon bags? We\nmay enlarge our fortunes, but we cannot our bodies; so that it does\nbut spill and run over, whatsoever we take more than we can hold. Our\nforefathers (by the force of whose virtues we are now supported in our\nvices) lived every jot as well as we, when they provided and dressed\ntheir own meat with their own hands; lodged upon the ground, and were\nnot as yet come to the vanity of gold and gems; when they swore by\ntheir earthen gods, and kept their oath, though they died for it.\nDid not our consuls live more happily when they cooked their own meat\nwith those victorious hands that had conquered so many enemies and\nwon so many laurels? Did they not live more happily, I say, than our\nApicius (that corrupter of youth, and plague of the age he lived in)\nwho, after he had spent a prodigious fortune upon his belly, poisoned\nhimself for fear of starving, when he had yet 250,000 crowns in his\ncoffers? which may serve to show us, that it is the mind, and not\nthe sum, that makes any man rich; when Apicius with all his treasure\ncounted himself in a state of beggary, and took poison to avoid that\ncondition, which another would have prayed for. But why do we call\nit poison, which was the wholesomest draught of his life? His daily\ngluttony was poison rather, both to himself and others. His ostentation\nof it was intolerable; and so was the infinite pains he took to mislead\nothers by his example, who went even fast enough of themselves without\ndriving.\nIt is a shame for a man to place his felicity in those entertainments\nand appetites that are stronger in brutes. Do not beasts eat with a\nbetter stomach? Have they not more satisfaction in their lusts? And\nthey have not only a quicker relish of their pleasures, but they enjoy\nthem without either scandal or remorse. If sensuality were happiness,\nbeasts were happier than men; but human felicity is lodged in the\nsoul, not in the flesh. They that deliver themselves up to luxury\nare still either tormented with too little, or oppressed with too\nmuch; and equally miserable, by being either deserted or overwhelmed:\nthey are like men in a dangerous sea; one while cast a-dry upon a\nrock, and another while swallowed up in a whirlpool; and all this\nfrom the mistake of not distinguishing good from evil. The huntsman,\nthat with which labor and hazard takes a wild beast, runs as great a\nrisk afterwards in the keeping of him; for many times he tears out\nthe throat of his master; and it is the same thing with inordinate\npleasures: the more in number, and the greater they are, the more\ngeneral and absolute a slave is the servant of them. Let the common\npeople pronounce him as happy as they please, he pays his liberty for\nhis delights, and sells himself for what he buys.\nLet any man take a view of our kitchens, the number of our cooks, and\nthe variety of our meats; will he not wonder to see so much provision\nmade for one belly? We have as many diseases as we have cooks or\nmeats; and the service of the appetite is the study now in vogue. To\nsay nothing of our trains of lackeys, and our troops of caterers and\nsewers: Good God! that ever one belly should employ so many people!\nHow nauseous and fulsome are the surfeits that follow these excesses?\nSimple meats are out of fashion, and all are collected into one; so\nthat the cook does the office of the stomach; nay, and of the teeth\ntoo; for the meat looks as if it were chewed beforehand: here is the\nluxury of all tastes in one dish, and liker a vomit than a soup. From\nthese compounded dishes arise compounded diseases, which require\ncompounded medicines. It is the same thing with our minds that it is\nwith our tables; simple vices are curable by simple counsels, but a\ngeneral dissolution of manners is hardly overcome; we are overrun with\na public as well as with a private madness. The physicians of old\nunderstood little more than the virtue of some herbs to stop blood, or\nheal a wound; and their firm and healthful bodies needed little more\nbefore they were corrupted by luxury and pleasure; and when it came to\nthat once, their business was not to allay hunger, but to provoke it by\na thousand inventions and sauces. That which was aliment to a craving\nstomach is become a burden to a full one. From hence came paleness,\ntrembling, and worse effects from crudities than famine; a weakness in\nthe joints, the belly stretched, suffusion of choler, the torpor of\nthe nerves, and a palpitation of the heart. To say nothing of megrims,\ntorments of the eyes and ears, head-ache, gout, scurvy, several sorts\nof fevers and putrid ulcers, with other diseases that are but the\npunishment of luxury. So long as our bodies were hardened with labor,\nor tired with exercise or hunting, our food was plain and simple; many\ndishes have made many diseases.\nIt is an ill thing for a man not to know the measure of his stomach,\nnor to consider that men do many things in their drink that they are\nashamed of sober; drunkenness being nothing else but a voluntary\nmadness. It emboldens men to do all sorts of mischiefs; it both\nirritates wickedness and discovers it; it does not make men vicious,\nbut it shows them to be so. It was in a drunken fit that Alexander\nkilled Clytus. It makes him that is insolent prouder, him that is\ncruel fiercer, it takes away all shame. He that is peevish breaks out\npresently into ill words and blows. The lecher, without any regard to\ndecency or scandal, turns up his whore in the market-place. A man\u2019s\ntongue trips, his head runs round, he staggers in his pace. To say\nnothing of the crudities and diseases that follow upon this distemper,\nconsider the public mischiefs it has done. How many warlike nations\nand strong cities, that have stood invincible to attacks and sieges,\nhas drunkenness overcome! Is it not a great honor to drink the company\ndead? a magnificent virtue to swallow more wine than the rest, and yet\nat last to be outdone by a hogshead? What shall we say of those men\nthat invert the offices of day and night? as if our eyes were only\ngiven us to make use of in the dark? Is it day? \u201cIt is time to go to\nbed.\u201d Is it night? \u201cIt is time to rise.\u201d Is it toward morning? \u201cLet us\ngo to supper.\u201d When other people lie down they rise, and lie till the\nnext night to digest the debauch of the day before. It is an argument\nof clownery, to do as other people do.\nLuxury steals upon us by degrees; first, it shows itself in a more\nthan ordinary care of our bodies, it slips next into the furniture of\nour houses; and it gets then into the fabric, curiosity, and expense\nof the house itself. It appears, lastly, in the fantastical excesses\nof our tables. We change and shuffle our meats, confound our sauces,\nserve that in first that used to be last, and value our dishes, not for\nthe taste, but for the rarity. Nay, we are so delicate, that we must\nbe told when we are to eat or drink; when we are hungry or weary; and\nwe cherish some vices as proofs and arguments of our happiness. The\nmost miserable mortals are they that deliver themselves up to their\npalates, or to their lusts: the pleasure is short and turns presently\nnauseous, and the end of it is either shame or repentance. It is a\nbrutal entertainment, and unworthy of a man, to place his felicity in\nthe service of his senses. As to the wrathful, the contentious, the\nambitious, though the distemper be great, the offence has yet something\nin it that is manly; but the basest of prostitutes are those that\ndedicate themselves wholly to lust; what with their hopes and fears,\nanxiety of thought, and perpetual disquiets, they are never well, full\nnor fasting.\nWhat a deal of business is now made about our houses and diet, which\nwas at first both obvious and of little expense? Luxury led the\nway, and we have employed our wits in the aid of our vices. First\nwe desired superfluities, our next step was to wickedness, and, in\nconclusion, we delivered up our minds to our bodies, and so became\nslaves to our appetites, which before were our servants, and are now\nbecome our masters. What was it that brought us to the extravagance\nof embroideries, perfumes, tire-women, etc. We passed the bounds of\nNature, and launched out into superfluities; insomuch, that it is\nnow-a-days only for beggars and clowns to content themselves with what\nis sufficient; our luxury makes us insolent and mad. We take upon us\nlike princes, and fly out for every trifle, as though there were life\nand death in the case. What a madness is it for a man to lay out an\nestate upon a table or a cabinet, a patrimony upon a pain of pendants,\nand to inflame the price of curiosities according to the hazard either\nof breaking or losing of them? To wear garments that will neither\ndefend a woman\u2019s body, nor her modesty: so thin that one could make a\nconscience of swearing she were naked: for she hardly shows more in\nthe privacies of her amour than in public? How long shall we covet\nand oppress, enlarge our possessions, and account that too little for\none man which was formerly enough for a nation? And our luxury is as\ninsatiable as our avarice. Where is that lake, that sea, that forest,\nthat spot of land; that is not ransacked to gratify our palate? The\nvery earth is burdened with our buildings; not a river, not a mountain,\nescapes us. Oh, that there should be such boundless desires in our\nlittle bodies! Would not fewer lodgings serve us? We lie but in one,\nand where we are not, that is not properly ours. What with our hooks,\nsnares, nets, dogs, etc., we are at war with all living creatures; and\nnothing comes amiss but that which is either too cheap, or too common;\nand all this is to gratify a fantastical palate. Our avarice, our\nambition, our lusts, are insatiable; we enlarge our possessions, swell\nour families, we rifle sea and land for matter of ornament and luxury.\nA bull contents himself with one meadow, and one forest is enough for a\nthousand elephants; but the little body of a man devours more than all\nother living creatures. We do not eat to satisfy hunger, but ambition;\nwe are dead while we are alive, and our houses are so much our tombs,\nthat a man might write our _epitaphs_ upon our very doors.\nA voluptuous person, in fine, can neither be a good man, a good\npatriot, nor a good friend; for he is transported with his appetites,\nwithout considering, that the lot of man is the law of Nature. A good\nman (like a good soldier) will stand his ground, receive wounds, glory\nin his scars, and in death itself love his master for whom he falls;\nwith that divine precept always in his mind, \u201cFollow good:\u201d whereas\nhe that complains, laments, and groans, must yield nevertheless, and\ndo his duty though in spite of his heart. Now, what a madness is it\nfor a man to choose rather to be lugged than to follow, and vainly to\ncontend with the calamities of human life? Whatsoever is laid upon\nus by necessity, we should receive generously; for it is foolish to\nstrive with what we cannot avoid. We are born subjects, and to obey\nGod is perfect liberty. He that does this shall be free, safe, and\nquiet: all his actions shall succeed to his wish: and what can any man\ndesire more than to want nothing from without, and to have all things\ndesirable within himself? Pleasures do but weaken our minds, and send\nus for our support to Fortune, who gives us money only as the wages of\nslavery. We must stop our eyes and our ears. Ulysses had but one rock\nto fear, but human life has many. Every city, nay, every man, is one;\nand there is no trusting even to our nearest friends. Deliver me from\nthe superstition of taking those things which are light and vain for\nfelicities.\nCHAPTER XII.\nAVARICE AND AMBITION ARE INSATIABLE AND RESTLESS.\nThe man that would be truly rich must not increase his fortune, but\nretrench his appetites: for riches are not only superfluous, but mean,\nand little more to the possessor than to the looker-on. What is the\nend of ambition and avarice, when at best we are but stewards of what\nwe falsely call our own? All those things that we pursue with so much\nhazard and expense of blood, as well to keep as to get, for which we\nbreak faith and friendship, what are they but the mere _deposita_ of\nFortune? and not ours, but already inclining toward a new master.\nThere is nothing our own but that which we give to ourselves, and of\nwhich we have a certain and an inexpugnable possession. Avarice is\nso insatiable, that it is not in the power of liberality to content\nit; and our desires are so boundless, that whatever we get is but in\nthe way to getting more without end: and so long as we are solicitous\nfor the increase of wealth, we lose the true use of it; and spend our\ntime in putting out, calling in, and passing our accounts, without\nany substantial benefit, either to the world or to ourselves. What is\nthe difference betwixt old men and children? the one cries for nuts\nand apples, and the other for gold and silver: the one sets up courts\nof justice, hears and determines, acquits and condemns, in jest; the\nother in earnest: the one makes houses of clay, the other of marble:\nso that the works of old men are nothing in the world but the progress\nand improvement of children\u2019s errors; and they are to be admonished and\npunished too like children, not in revenge for injuries received, but\nas a correction of injuries done, and to make them give over. There\nis some substance yet in gold and silver; but as to judgments and\nstatutes, procuration and continuance-money, these are only the visions\nand dreams of avarice. Throw a crust of bread to a dog, he takes it\nopen-mouthed, swallows it whole, and presently gapes for more: just so\ndo we with the gifts of Fortune; down they go without chewing, and we\nare immediately ready for another chop. But what has avarice now to do\nwith gold and silver, that is so much outdone by curiosities of a far\ngreater value? Let us no longer complain that there was not a heavier\nload laid upon those precious metals, or that they were not buried\ndeep enough, when we have found out ways by wax and parchments, and\nby bloody usurious contracts, to undo one another. It is remarkable,\nthat Providence has given us all things for our advantage near at hand;\nbut iron, gold, and silver, (being both the instrument of blood and\nslaughter, and the price of it) Nature has hidden in the bowels of the\nearth.\nThere is no avarice without some punishment, over and above that which\nit is to itself. How miserable is it in the desire! how miserable even\nin the attaining of our ends! For money is a greater torment in the\npossession than it is in the pursuit. The fear of losing it is a great\ntrouble, the loss of it a greater, and it is made a greater yet by\nopinion. Nay, even in the case of no direct loss at all, the covetous\nman loses what he does not get. It is true, the people call the rich\nman a happy man, and wish themselves in his condition; but can any\ncondition be worse than that which carries vexation and envy along with\nit? Neither is any man to boast of his fortune, his herds of cattle,\nhis number of slaves, his lands and palaces; for comparing that which\nhe has to that which he further covets, he is a beggar. No man can\npossess all things, but any man may contemn them; and the contempt of\nriches is the nearest way to the gaining of them.\nSome magistrates are made for money, and those commonly are bribed with\nmoney. We are all turned merchants, and look not into the quality of\nthings, but into the price of them; for reward we are pious, and for\nreward again we are impious. We are honest so long as we may thrive\nupon it; but if the devil himself gives better wages, we change our\nparty. Our parents have trained us up into an admiration of gold and\nsilver, and the love of it is grown up with us to that degree that\nwhen we would show our gratitude to Heaven, we make presents of those\nmetals. This it is that makes poverty look like a curse and a reproach;\nand the poets help it forward; the chariot of the sun must be all of\ngold; the best of times must be the Golden Age, and thus they turn the\ngreatest misery of mankind into the greatest blessings.\nNeither does avarice make us only unhappy in ourselves, but malevolent\nalso to mankind. The soldier wishes for war; the husbandman would have\nhis corn dear; the lawyer prays for dissension; the physician for a\nsickly year; he that deals in curiosities, for luxury and excess, for\nhe makes up his fortunes out of the corruptions of the age. High winds\nand public conflagrations make work for the carpenter and bricklayer,\nand one man lives by the loss of another; some few, perhaps, have\nthe fortune to be detected, but they are all wicked alike. A great\nplague makes work for the sexton; and, in one word, whosoever gains\nby the dead has not much kindness for the living. Demades of Athens\ncondemned a fellow that sold necessaries for funerals, upon proof that\nhe wished to make himself a fortune by his trade, which could not be\nbut by a great mortality; but perhaps he did not so much desire to have\nmany customers, as to sell dear, and buy cheap; besides, that all of\nthat trade might have been condemned as well as he. Whatsoever whets\nour appetites, flatters and depresses the mind, and, by dilating it,\nweakens it; first blowing it up, and then filling and deluding it with\nvanity.\nTo proceed now from the most prostitute of all vices, sensuality and\navarice, to that which passes in the world for the most generous, the\nthirst of glory and dominion. If they that run mad after wealth and\nhonor, could but look into the hearts of them that have already gained\nthese points, how would it startle them to see those hideous cares and\ncrimes that wait upon ambitious greatness: all those acquisitions that\ndazzle the eyes of the vulgar are but false pleasures, slippery and\nuncertain. They are achieved with labor, and the very guard of them is\npainful. Ambition puffs us up with vanity and wind: and we are equally\ntroubled either to see any body before us, or nobody behind us; so that\nwe lie under a double envy; for whosoever envies another is also envied\nhimself. What matters it how far Alexander extended his conquests,\nif he was not yet satisfied with what he had? Every man wants as\nmuch as he covets; and it is lost labor to pour into a vessel that\nwill never be full. He that had subdued so many princes and nations,\nupon the killing of Clytus (one friend) and the loss of Hyphestion\n(another) delivered himself up to anger and sadness; and when he was\nmaster of the world, he was yet a slave to his passions. Look into\nCyrus, Cambyses, and the whole Persian line, and you shall not find so\nmuch as one man of them that died satisfied with what he had gotten.\nAmbition aspires from great things to greater; and propounds matters\neven impossible, when it has once arrived at things beyond expectation.\nIt is a kind of dropsy; the more a man drinks, the more he covets. Let\nany man but observe the tumults and the crowds that attend palaces;\nwhat affronts must we endure to be admitted, and how much greater when\nwe are in! The passage to virtue is fair, but the way to greatness\nis craggy and it stands not only upon a precipice, but upon ice too;\nand yet it is a hard matter to convince a great man that his station\nis slippery, or to prevail with him not to depend upon his greatness;\nbut all superfluities are hurtful. A rank crop lays the corn; too\ngreat a burden of fruit breaks the bough; and our minds may be as well\novercharged with an immoderate happiness. Nay, though we ourselves\nwould be at rest, our fortune will not suffer it: the way that leads\nto honor and riches leads to troubles; and we find the source of our\nsorrows in the very objects of our delights.\nWhat joy is there in feasting and luxury; in ambition and a crowd of\nclients; in the arms of a mistress, or in the vanity of an unprofitable\nknowledge? These short and false pleasures deceive us, and, like\ndrunkenness, revenge the jolly madness of _one_ hour with the nauseous\nand sad repentance of _many_. Ambition is like a gulf: everything is\nswallowed up in it and buried, beside the dangerous consequences of\nit; for that which one has taken from all, may be easily taken away\nagain by all from one. It was not either virtue or reason, but the\nmad love of a deceitful greatness, that animated Pompey in his wars,\neither abroad or at home. What was it but his ambition that hurried\nhim to Spain, Africa, and elsewhere, when he was too great already\nin everybody\u2019s opinion but his own? And the same motive had Julius\nC\u00e6sar, who could not, even then, brook a superior himself, when the\ncommonwealth had submitted unto two already.\nNor was it any instinct of virtue that pushed on Marius, who at the\nhead of an army was himself led on under the command of ambition: but\nhe came at last to the deserved fate of other wicked men, and to drink\nhimself of the same cup that he had filled to others. We impose upon\nour reason, when we suffer ourselves to be transported with titles; for\nwe know that they are nothing but a more glorious sound; and so for\nornaments and gildings, though there be a lustre to dazzle our eyes,\nour understanding tells us that it is only outside, and the matter\nunder it is only coarse and common.\nI will never envy those that the people call great and happy. A sound\nmind is not to be shaken with a popular and vain applause; nor is it\nin the power of their pride to disturb the state of our happiness. An\nhonest man is known now-a-days by the dust he raises upon the way, and\nit is become a point of honor to overrun people, and keep all at a\ndistance; though he that is put out of the way may perchance be happier\nthan he that takes it. He that would exercise a power profitable to\nhimself, and grievous to nobody else, let him practice it upon his\npassion. They that have burnt cities, otherwise invincible, driven\narmies before them, and bathed themselves in human blood, after they\nhave overcome all open enemies, they have been vanquished by their\nlust, by their cruelty, and without any resistance.\nAlexander was possessed with the madness of laying kingdoms waste.\nHe began with Greece, where he was brought up; and there he quarried\nhimself upon that in it which was the best; he enslaved Lacedemon, and\nsilenced Athens: nor was he content with the destruction of those towns\nwhich his father Philip had either conquered or bought; but he made\nhimself the enemy of human nature; and, like the worst of beasts, he\nworried what he could not eat.\nFelicity is an unquiet thing; it torments itself, and puzzles the\nbrain. It makes some people ambitious, others luxurious; it puffs up\nsome, and softens others; only (as it is with wine) some heads bear\nit better than others; but it dissolves all. Greatness stands upon a\nprecipice: and if prosperity carries a man never so little beyond his\npoise, it overbears and dashes him to pieces. It is a rare thing for\na man in a great fortune to lay down his happiness gently; it being a\ncommon fate for a man to sink under the weight of those felicities that\nraise him. How many of the nobility did Marius bring down to herdsmen\nand other mean offices! Nay, in the very moment of our despising\nservants, we may be made so ourselves.\nCHAPTER XIII.\nHOPE AND FEAR ARE THE BANE OF HUMAN LIFE.\nNo man can be said to be perfectly happy that runs the risk of\ndisappointment: which is the case of every man that _fears_ or _hopes_\nfor anything. For _hope_ and _fear_, how distant soever they may seem\nto be the one from the other, they are both of them yet coupled in the\nsame chain, as the guard and the prisoner; and the one treads upon\nthe heels of the other. The reason of this is obvious, for they are\npassions that look forward, and are ever solicitous for the future;\nonly _hope_ is the more plausible weakness of the two, which in truth,\nupon the main, are inseparable; for the one cannot be without the\nother: but where the _hope_ is stronger than the _fear_, or the _fear_\nthan the _hope_, we call it the one or the other; for without _fear_ it\nwere no longer _hope_, but _certainty_; as without _hope_ it were no\nlonger _fear_ but _despair_.\nWe may come to understand whether our disputes are vain or not, if we\ndo but consider that we are either troubled about the _present_, the\n_future_ or _both_. If the present, it is easy to judge, and the future\nis uncertain. It is a foolish thing to be miserable beforehand for\nfear of misery to come; for a man loses the present, which he might\nenjoy, in expectation of the future: nay, the fear of losing anything\nis as bad as the loss itself. I will be as prudent as I can, but not\ntimorous or careless; and I will bethink myself, and forecast what\ninconveniences may happen before they come. It is true, a man may fear,\nand yet not be fearful; which is no more than to have the affection of\nfear without the vice of it; but yet a frequent admittance of it runs\ninto a habit. It is a shameful and an unmanly thing to be doubtful,\ntimorous, and uncertain; to set one step forward, and another backward;\nand to be irresolute. Can there be any man so fearful, that had not\nrather fall once than hang always in suspense?\nOur miseries are endless, if we stand in fear of all possibilities;\nthe best way, in such a case, is to drive out one nail with another,\nand a little to qualify fear with hope; which may serve to palliate a\nmisfortune; though not to cure it. There is not anything that we fear,\nwhich is so certain to come, as it is certain that many things which\nwe do fear will not come; but we are loth to oppose our credulity when\nit begins to move us, and so to bring our fear to the test. Well! but\n\u201cwhat if the thing we fear should come to pass?\u201d Perhaps it will be\nthe better for us. Suppose it be _death_ itself, why may it not prove\nthe glory of my life? Did not poison make Socrates famous? and was not\nCato\u2019s sword a great part of his honor? \u201cDo we fear any misfortune to\nbefall us?\u201d We are not presently sure that it will happen. How many\ndeliverances have come unlooked for? and how many mischiefs that we\nlooked for have never come to pass? It is time enough to lament when it\ncomes, and, in the _interim_, to promise ourselves the best. What do I\nknow but something or other may delay or divert it? Some have escaped\nout of the fire; others, when a house has fallen over their head,\nhave received no hurt: one man has been saved when a sword was at his\nthroat; another has been condemned, and outlived his headsman: so that\nill-fortune, we see, as well as good, has her levities; peradventure\nit will be, peradventure not; and until it comes to pass, we are not\nsure of it: we do many times take words in a worse sense than they were\nintended, and imagine things to be worse taken than they are. It is\ntime enough to bear a misfortune when it comes, without anticipating it.\nHe that would deliver himself from all apprehensions of the future,\nlet him first take for granted, that all fears will fall upon him; and\nthen examine and measure the evil that he fears, which he will find\nto be neither great nor long. Beside, that the ills which he fears he\nmay suffer, he suffers in the very fear of them. As in the symptoms of\nan approaching disease, a man shall find himself lazy and listless: a\nweariness in his limbs, with a yawning and shuddering all over him; so\nit is in the case of a weak mind, it fancies misfortunes, and makes a\nman wretched before his time. Why should I torment myself at present\nwith what, perhaps, may fall out fifty years hence? This humor is a\nkind of voluntary disease, and an industrious contrivance of our own\nunhappiness, to complain of an affliction that we do not feel. Some\nare not only moved with grief itself, but with the mere opinion of\nit; as children will start at a shadow, or at the sight of a deformed\nperson. If we stand in fear of violence from a powerful enemy, it is\nsome comfort to us, that whosoever makes himself terrible to others is\nnot without fear himself: the least noise makes a lion start; and the\nfiercest of beasts, whatsoever enrages them, makes them tremble too: a\nshadow, a voice, an unusual odor, rouses them.\nThe things most to be feared I take to be of three kinds; _want_,\n_sickness_, and those _violences_ that may be imposed upon us by a\n_strong hand_. The last of these has the greatest force, because it\ncomes attended with noise and tumult; whereas the incommodities of\npoverty and diseases are more natural, and steal upon us in silence,\nwithout any external circumstances of horror: but the other marches in\npomp, with fire and sword, gibbets, racks, hooks; wild beasts to devour\nus; stakes to impale us; engines to tear us to pieces; pitched bags to\nburn us in, and a thousand other exquisite inventions of cruelty. No\nwonder then, if that be the most dreadful to us that presents itself in\nso many uncouth shapes; and by the very solemnity is rendered the most\nformidable. The more instruments of bodily pain the executioner shows\nus, the more frightful he makes himself: for many a man that would have\nencountered death in any generous form, with resolution enough, is\nyet overcome with the _manner_ of it. As for the calamities of hunger\nand thirst, inward ulcers, scorching fevers, tormenting fits of the\nstone, I look upon these miseries to be at least as grievous as any\nof the rest; only they do not so much affect the fancy, because they\nlie out of sight. Some people talk high of danger at a distance; but\n(like cowards) when the executioner comes to do his duty, and show us\nthe fire, the ax, the scaffold, and death at hand, their courage fails\nthem upon the very pinch, when they have most need of it. Sickness, (I\nhope) captivity, fire, are no new things to us; the fall of houses,\nfunerals, and conflagrations, are every day before our eyes. The man\nthat I supped with last night is dead before morning; why should I\nwonder then, seeing so many fall about me, to be hit at last myself?\nWhat can be greater madness than to cry out, \u201cWho would have dreamed\nof this?\u201d And why not, I beseech you? Where is that estate that may\nnot be reduced to beggary? that dignity which may not be followed with\nbanishment, disgrace, and extreme contempt? that kingdom that may not\nsuddenly fall to ruin; change its master, and be depopulated? that\nprince that may not pass the hand of a common hangman? That which is\none man\u2019s fortune may be another\u2019s; but the foresight of calamities to\ncome breaks the violence of them.\nCHAPTER XIV.\nIT IS ACCORDING TO THE TRUE OR FALSE ESTIMATE OF THINGS THAT WE ARE\nHAPPY OR MISERABLE.\nHow many things are there that the fancy makes terrible by night, which\nthe day turns into ridiculous! What is there in labor, or in death,\nthat a man should be afraid of? They are much slighter in act than\nin contemplation; and we _may_ contemn them, but we _will_ not: so\nthat it is not because they are hard that we dread them, but they are\nhard because we are first afraid of them. Pains, and other violences\nof Fortune, are the same thing to us that goblins are to children:\nwe are more scared with them than hurt. We take up our opinions upon\ntrust, and err for company, still judging that to be best that has\nmost competitors. We make a false calculation of matters, because we\nadvise with opinion, and not with Nature; and this misleads us to a\nhigher esteem for riches, honor, and power, than they are worth: we\nhave been used to admire and recommend them, and a private error is\nquickly turned into a public. The greatest and the smallest things\nare equally hard to be comprehended; we account many things _great_,\nfor want of understanding what effectually is so: and we reckon other\nthings to be _small_, which we find frequently to be of the highest\nvalue. Vain things only move vain minds. The accidents that we so\nmuch boggle at are not terrible in themselves, but they are made so\nby our infirmities; but we consult rather what we hear than what we\nfeel, without examining, opposing, or discussing the things we fear;\nso that we either stand still and tremble, or else directly run for\nit, as those troops did, that, upon the raising of the dust, took a\nflock of sheep for the enemy. When the body and mind are corrupted,\nit is no wonder if all things prove intolerable; and not because they\nare so in truth, but because we are dissolute and foolish: for we are\ninfatuated to such a degree, that, betwixt the common madness of men,\nand that which falls under the care of the physician, there is but\nthis difference, the one labors of a disease, and the other of a false\nopinion.\nThe Stoics hold, that all those torments that commonly draw from us\ngroans and ejaculations, are in themselves trivial and contemptible.\nBut these high-flown expressions apart (how true soever) let us\ndiscourse the point at the rate of ordinary men, and not make ourselves\nmiserable before our time; for the things we apprehend to be at hand\nmay possibly never come to pass. Some things trouble us more than they\nshould, other things sooner; and some things again disorder us that\nought not to trouble us at all; so that we either enlarge, or create,\nor anticipate our disquiets. For the first part, let it rest as a\nmatter in controversy; for that which I account light, another perhaps\nwill judge insupportable! One man laughs under the lash, and another\nwhines for a fillip. How sad a calamity is poverty to one man, which to\nanother appears rather desirable than inconvenient? For the poor man,\nwho has nothing to lose, has nothing to fear: and he that would enjoy\nhimself to the satisfaction of his soul, must be either poor indeed,\nor at least look as if he were so. Some people are extremely dejected\nwith sickness and pain; whereas Epicurus blessed his fate with his last\nbreath, in the acutest torments of the stone imaginable. And so for\nbanishment, which to one man is so grievous, and yet to another is no\nmore than a bare change of place: a thing that we do every day for our\nhealth, pleasure, nay, and upon the account even of common business.\nHow terrible is death to one man, which to another appears the greatest\nprovidence in nature, even toward all ages and conditions! It is the\nwish of some, the relief of many, and the end of all. It sets the slave\nat liberty, carries the banished man home, and places all mortals upon\nthe same level: insomuch, that life itself were a punishment without\nit. When I see tyrants, tortures, violences, the prospect of death is a\nconsolation to me, and the only remedy against the injuries of life.\nNay, so great are our mistakes in the true estimate of things, that we\nhave hardly done any thing that we have not had reason to wish undone;\nand we have found the things we feared to be more desirable than those\nwe coveted. Our very prayers have been more pernicious than the curses\nof our enemies; and we must pray to have our former prayers forgiven.\nWhere is the wise man that wishes to himself the wishes of his mother,\nnurse, or his tutor; the worst of enemies, with the intention of the\nbest of friends. We are undone if their prayers be heard; and it is our\nduty to pray that they may not; for they are no other than well-meaning\nexecrations. They take evil for good, and one wish fights with another:\ngive me rather the contempt of all those things whereof they wish me\nthe greatest plenty. We are equally hurt by some that pray for us, and\nby others that curse us: the one imprints in us a false fear, and the\nother does us mischief by a mistake: so that it is no wonder if mankind\nbe miserable, when we are brought up from the very cradle under the\nimprecations of our parents. We pray for trifles, without so much as\nthinking of the greatest blessings; and we are not ashamed many times\nto ask God for that which we should blush to own to our neighbor.\nIt is with us as with an innocent that my father had in his family; she\nfell blind on a sudden, and nobody could persuade her she was blind.\n\u201cShe could not endure the house,\u201d she cried, \u201cit was so dark,\u201d and was\nstill calling to go abroad. That which we laughed at in her we find\nto be true in ourselves, we are covetous and ambitious; but the world\nshall never bring us to acknowledge it, and we impute it to the place:\nnay, we are the worse of the two; for that blind fool called for a\nguide, and we wander about without one. It is a hard matter to cure\nthose that will not believe they are sick. We are ashamed to admit a\nmaster, and we are too old to learn. Vice still goes before virtue: so\nthat we have two works to do: we must cast off the one, and learn the\nother. By one evil we make way to another, and only seek things to be\navoided, or those of which we are soon weary. That which seemed too\nmuch when we wished for it, proves too little when we have it; and it\nis not, as some imagine, that felicity is greedy, but it is little and\nnarrow, and cannot satisfy us. That which we take to be very high at a\ndistance, we find to be but low when we come at it. And the business\nis, we do not understand the true state of things: we are deceived by\nrumors; when we have gained the thing we aimed at, we find it to be\neither ill or empty; or perchance less than we expect, or otherwise\nperhaps great, but not good.\nCHAPTER XV.\nTHE BLESSINGS OF TEMPERANCE AND MODERATION.\nThere is not anything that is necessary to us but we have it either\n_cheap_ or _gratis_: and this is the provision that our heavenly\nFather has made for us, whose bounty was never wanting to our needs.\nIt is true the belly craves and calls upon us, but then a small matter\ncontents it: a little bread and water is sufficient, and all the rest\nis but superfluous. He that lives according to reason shall never be\npoor, and he that governs his life by opinion shall never be rich:\nfor nature is limited, but fancy is boundless. As for meat, clothes,\nand lodging, a little feeds the body, and as little covers it; so\nthat if mankind would only attend human nature, without gaping at\nsuperfluities, a cook would be found as needless as a soldier: for we\nmay have necessaries upon very easy terms; whereas we put ourselves to\ngreat pains for excesses. When we are cold, we may cover ourselves with\nskins of beasts; and, against violent heats, we have natural grottoes;\nor with a few osiers and a little clay we may defend ourselves against\nall seasons. Providence has been kinder to us than to leave us to live\nby our wits, and to stand in need of invention and arts.\nIt is only pride and curiosity that involve us in difficulties: if\nnothing will serve a man but rich clothes and furniture, statues and\nplate, a numerous train of servants, and the rarities of all nations,\nit is not Fortune\u2019s fault, but his own, that he is not satisfied: for\nhis desires are insatiable, and this is not a thirst, but a disease;\nand if he were master of the whole world, he would be still a beggar.\nIt is the mind that makes us rich and happy, in what condition soever\nwe are; and money signifies no more to it than it does to the gods. If\nthe religion be sincere, no matter for the ornaments it is only luxury\nand avarice that make poverty grievous to us; for it is a very small\nmatter that does our business; and when we have provided against cold,\nhunger, and thirst, all the rest is but vanity and excess: and there\nis no need of expense upon foreign delicacies, or the artifices of the\nkitchen. What is he the worse for poverty that despises these things?\nnay, is he not rather the better for it, because he is not able to go\nto the price of them? for he is kept sound whether he will or not: and\nthat which a man _cannot_ do, looks many times as if he _would not_.\nWhen I look back into the moderation of past ages, it makes me ashamed\nto discourse, as if poverty had need of any consolation; for we are\nnow come to that degree of intemperance, that a fair patrimony is too\nlittle for a meal. Homer had but one servant, Plato three, and Zeno\n(the master of the masculine sect of Stoics) had none at all. The\ndaughters of Scipio had their portions out of the common treasury,\nfor their father left them not a penny: how happy were the husbands\nthat had the people of Rome for their father-in-law! Shall any man now\ncontemn poverty after these eminent examples, which are sufficient\nnot only to justify but to recommend it? Upon Diogenes\u2019 only servant\nrunning away from him, he was told where he was, and persuaded to fetch\nhim back again: \u201cWhat,\u201d says he, \u201ccan Manes live without Diogenes, and\nnot Diogenes without Manes?\u201d and so let him go.\nThe piety and moderation of Scipio have made his memory more venerable\nthan his arms; and more yet after he left his country than while he\ndefended it: for matters were come to that pass, that either Scipio\nmust be injurious to Rome or Rome to Scipio. Coarse bread and water to\na temperate man is as good as a feast; and the very herbs of the field\nyield a nourishment to man as well as to beasts. It was not by choice\nmeats and perfumes that our forefathers recommended themselves, but\nin virtuous actions, and the sweat of honest, military, and of manly\nlabors.\nWhile Nature lay in common, and all her benefits were promiscuously\nenjoyed, what could be happier than the state of mankind, when people\nlived without avarice or envy? What could be richer than when there\nwas not a poor man to be found in the world? So soon as this impartial\nbounty of Providence came to be restrained by covetousness, and\nthat particulars appropriated to themselves that which was intended\nfor all, then did poverty creep into the world, when some men, by\ndesiring more than came to their share, lost their title to the rest;\na loss never to be repaired; for though we may come yet to get much,\nwe once had all. The fruits of the earth were in those days divided\namong the inhabitants of it, without either want or excess. So long\nas men contented themselves with their lot, there was no violence,\nno engrossing or hiding of those benefits for particular advantages,\nwhich were appointed for the community; but every man had as much\ncare for his neighbor as for himself. No arms or bloodshed, no war,\nbut with wild beasts: but under the protection of a wood or a cave,\nthey spent their days without cares, and their nights without groans;\ntheir innocence was their security and their protection. There were\nas yet no beds of state, no ornaments, of pearl or embroidery, nor\nany of those remorses that attend them; but the heavens were their\ncanopy, and the glories of them their spectacle. The motions of the\norbs, the courses of the stars, and the wonderful order of Providence,\nwas their contemplation. There was no fear of the house falling, or\nthe rustling of a rat behind the arras; they had no palaces then like\ncities; but they had open air, and breathing room, crystal fountains,\nrefreshing shades, the meadows dressed up in their native beauty, and\nsuch cottages as were according to nature, and wherein they lived\ncontentedly, without fear either of losing or of falling. These people\nlived without either solitude or fraud; and yet I must call them rather\nhappy than wise.\nThat men were generally better before they were corrupted than after,\nI make no doubt; and I am apt to believe that they were both stronger\nand hardier too but their wits were not yet come to maturity; for\nNature does not give virtue; and it is a kind of art to become good.\nThey had not as yet torn up the bowels of the earth for gold, silver,\nor precious stones; and so far were they from killing any man, as we\ndo, for a spectacle, that they were not as yet come to it, either in\nfear or anger; nay, they spared the very fishes. But, after all this,\nthey were innocent because they were ignorant: and there is a great\ndifference betwixt not knowing how to offend and not being willing to\ndo it. They had, in that rude life, certain images and resemblances of\nvirtue, but yet they fell short of virtue itself, which comes only by\ninstitution, learning, and study, as it is perfected by practice. It is\nindeed the end for which we were born, but yet it did not come into the\nworld with us; and in the best of men, before they are instructed, we\nfind rather the matter and the seeds of virtue than the virtue itself.\nIt is the wonderful benignity of Nature that has laid open to us all\nthings that may do us good, and only hid those things from us that may\nhurt us; as if she durst not trust us with gold and silver, or with\niron, which is the instrument of war and contention, for the other.\nIt is we ourselves that have drawn out of the earth both the _causes_\nand the _instruments_ of our dangers: and we are so vain as to set\nthe highest esteem upon those things to which Nature has assigned the\nlowest place. What can be more coarse and rude in the mine than these\nprecious metals, or more slavish and dirty than the people that dig and\nwork them? and yet they defile our minds more than our bodies, and make\nthe possessor fouler than the artificer of them. Rich men, in fine, are\nonly the greater slaves; both the one and the other want a great deal.\nHappy is that man that eats only for hunger, and drinks only for\nthirst; that stands upon his own legs, and lives by reason, not by\nexample; and provides for use and necessity, not for ostentation\nand pomp! Let us curb our appetites, encourage virtue, and rather\nbe beholden to ourselves for riches than to Fortune, who when a man\ndraws himself into a narrow compass, has the least mark at him. Let\nmy bed be plain and clean, and my clothes so too: my meat without\nmuch expense, or many waiters, and neither a burden to my purse nor\nto my body, not to go out the same way it came in. That which is too\nlittle for luxury, is abundantly enough for nature. The end of eating\nand drinking is satiety; now, what matters it though one eats and\ndrinks more, and another less, so long as the one is not a-hungry, nor\nthe other athirst? Epicurus, who limits pleasure to nature, as the\nStoics do virtue, is undoubtedly in the right; and those that cite\nhim to authorize their voluptuousness do exceedingly mistake him, and\nonly seek a good authority for an evil cause: for their pleasures of\nsloth, gluttony, and lust, have no affinity at all with his precepts\nor meaning. It is true, that at first sight his philosophy seems\neffeminate; but he that looks nearer him will find him to be a very\nbrave man only in a womanish dress.\nIt is a common objection, I know, that these philosophers do not\nlive at the rate they talk; fer they can flatter their superiors,\ngather estates, and be as much concerned at the loss of fortune, or\nof friends, as other people: as sensible of reproaches, as luxurious\nin their eating and drinking, their furniture, their houses; as\nmagnificent in their plate, servants, and officers; as profuse and\ncurious in their gardens, etc. Well! and what of all this, or if it\nwere twenty times more? It is some degree of virtue for a man to\ncondemn himself; and if he cannot come up to the best, to be yet\nbetter than the worst; and if he cannot wholly subdue his appetites,\nhowever to check and diminish them. If I do not live as I preach, take\nnotice that I do not speak of myself, but of virtue, nor am I so much\noffended with other men\u2019s vices as with my own. All this was objected\nto Plato, Epicurus, Zeno; nor is any virtue so sacred as to escape\nmalevolence. The Cynic Demetrius was a great instance of severity and\nmortification; and one that imposed upon himself neither to possess\nanything, nor so much as to ask it: and yet he had this _scorn_ put\nupon him, that his profession was _poverty_, not _virtue_. Plato is\nblamed for _asking_ money; Aristotle for _receiving_ it; Democritus\nfor _neglecting_ it; Epicurus for _consuming_ it. How happy were we if\nwe could but come to imitate these men\u2019s vices; for if we knew our own\ncondition, we should find work enough at home. But we are like people\nthat are making merry at a play or a tavern when their own houses are\non fire, and yet they know nothing of it. Nay, Cato himself was said to\nbe a drunkard; but _drunkenness_ itself shall sooner be proved to be\nno crime than Cato dishonest. They that demolish temples, and overturn\naltars, show their good-will, though they can do the gods no hurt, and\nso it fares with those that invade the reputation of great men.\nIf the professors of virtue be as the world calls them, avaricious,\nlibidinous, ambitious\u2014what are they then that have a detestation for\nthe very name of it: but malicious natures do not want wit to abuse\nhonester men than themselves. It is the practice of the multitude to\nbark at eminent men as little dogs do at strangers; for they look upon\nother men\u2019s virtues as the upbraiding of their own wickedness. We\nshould do well to commend those that are good, if not, let us pass them\nover; but, however, let us spare ourselves: for beside the blaspheming\nof virtue, our rage is to no purpose. But to return now to my text.\nWe are ready enough to limit others but loth to put bonds and\nrestraints upon ourselves, though we know that many times a greater\nevil is cured by a less; and the mind that will not be brought to\nvirtue by precepts, comes to it frequently by necessity. Let us try a\nlittle to eat upon a joint stool, to serve ourselves, to live within\ncompass, and accommodate our clothes to the end they were made for.\nOccasional experiments of our moderation give us the best proof of\nour firmness and virtue. A well-governed appetite is a great part of\nliberty, and it is a blessed lot, that since no man can have all things\nthat he would have, we may all of us forbear desiring what we have not.\nIt is the office of temperance to overrule us in our pleasures; some\nshe rejects, others she qualifies and keeps within bounds. Oh! the\ndelights of rest when a man comes to be weary, and of meat when he is\nheartily hungry.\nI have learned (says our author) by one journey how many things we have\nthat are superfluous, and how easily they might be spared, for when we\nare without them upon necessity, we do not so much as feel the want of\nthem. This is the second blessed day (says he) that my friend and I\nhave travelled together: one wagon carries ourselves and our servants;\nmy mattress lies upon the ground and I upon that: our diet answerable\nto our lodging, and never without our figs and our table-books. The\nmuleteer without shoes, and the mules only prove themselves to be alive\nby their walking. In this equipage, I am not willing, I perceive,\nto own myself, but as often as we happen into better company, I\npresently fall a-blushing, which shows that I am not yet confirmed in\nthose things which I approve and commend. I am not yet come to own my\nfrugality, for he that is ashamed to be seen in a mean condition would\nbe proud of a splendid one. I value myself upon what passengers think\nof me, and tacitly renounce my principles, whereas I should rather\nlift up my voice to be heard by mankind, and tell them \u201cYou are all\nmad\u2014your minds are set upon superfluities and you value no man for his\nvirtues.\u201d\nI came one night weary home, and threw myself upon the bed with this\nconsideration about me: \u201cThere is nothing ill that is well taken.\u201d My\nbaker tells me he has no bread; but, says he, I may get some of your\ntenants, though I fear it is not good. No matter, said I, for I will\nstay until it be better\u2014that is to say until my stomach will be glad\nof worse. It is discretion sometimes to practice temperance and wont\nourselves to a little, for there are many difficulties both of time and\nplace that may force us upon it.\nWhen we come to the matter of patrimony, how strictly do we examine\nwhat every man is worth before we will trust him with a penny! \u201cSuch a\nman,\u201d we cry, \u201chas a great estate, but it is shrewdly encumbered\u2014a very\nfair house, but it was built with borrowed money\u2014a numerous family,\nbut he does not keep touch with his creditors\u2014if his debts were paid\nhe would not be worth a groat.\u201d Why do we not take the same course in\nother things, and examine what every man is worth? It is not enough to\nhave a long train of attendants, vast possessions, or an incredible\ntreasure in money and jewels\u2014a man may be poor for all this. There\nis only this difference at best\u2014one man borrows of the _usurer_, and\nthe other of _fortune_. What signifies the carving or gilding of the\nchariot; is the master ever the better of it?\nWe cannot close up this chapter with a more generous instance of\nmoderation than that of Fabricius. Pyrrhus tempted him with a sum of\nmoney to betray his country, and Pyrrhus\u2019s physician offered Fabricius,\nfor a sum of money, to poison his _master_; but he was too brave\neither to be overcome by gold, or to be overcome by poison, so that he\nrefused the money, and advised Pyrrhus to have a care of treachery:\nand this too in the heat of a licentious war. Fabricius valued himself\nupon his poverty, and was as much above the thought of riches as of\npoison. \u201cLive Pyrrhus,\u201d says he \u201cby my friendship; and turn that to\nthy satisfaction which was before thy trouble:\u201d that is to say that\nFabricius could not be corrupted.\nCHAPTER XVI.\nCONSTANCY OF MIND GIVES A MAN REPUTATION, AND MAKES HIM HAPPY IN\nDESPITE OF ALL MISFORTUNE.\nThe whole duty of man may be reduced to the two points of _abstinence_\nand _patience_; _temperance_ in _prosperity_, and _courage_ in\n_adversity_. We have already treated of the former: and the other\nfollows now in course.\nEpicurus will have it, that a wise man will _bear all injuries_; but\nthe Stoics will not allow those things to be _injuries_ which Epicurus\ncalls so. Now, betwixt _these two_, there is the same difference that\nwe find betwixt two _gladiators_; the one receives wounds, but yet\nmaintains his ground, the other tells the people, when he is in blood,\nthat _it is but a scratch_, and will not suffer anybody to part them.\nAn _injury_ cannot be received, but it must be _done_; but it may be\n_done_ and yet not _received_; as a man may be in the water, and not\nswim, but if he swims, it is presumed that he is in the water. Or if\na blow or a shot be levelled at us, it may so happen that a man may\nmiss his aim, or some accident interpose that may divert the mischief.\nThat which is hurt is passive, and inferior to that which hurts it.\nBut you will say, that Socrates was condemned and put to death, and\nso received an injury; but I answer, that the tyrants _did_ him an\ninjury, and yet he _received_ none. He that steals anything from me\nand hides it in my own house, though I have not lost it, yet he has\nstolen it. He that lies with his own wife, and takes her for another\nwoman, though the woman be honest, the man is an adulterer. Suppose a\nman gives me a draught of poison and it proves not strong enough to\nkill me, his guilt is nevertheless for the disappointment. He that\nmakes a pass at me is as much a murderer, though I put it by, as if he\nhad struck me to the heart. It is the intention, not the effect, that\nmakes the wickedness. He is a thief that has the will of killing and\nslaying, before his hand is dipt in blood; as it is sacrilege, the very\nintention of laying violent hands upon holy things. If a philosopher\nbe exposed to torments, the ax over his head, his body wounded, his\nguts in his hands, I will allow him to groan; for virtue itself cannot\ndivest him of the nature of a man; but if his mind stand firm, he has\ndischarged his part. A great mind enables a man to maintain his station\nwith honor; so that he only makes use of what he meets in his way, as a\npilgrim that would fain be at his journey\u2019s end.\nIt is the excellency of a great mind to _ask_ nothing, and to _want_\nnothing; and to say, \u201cI will have nothing to do with fortune, that\nrepulses Cato, and prefers Vatinius.\u201d He that quits his hold,\nand accounts anything good that is not honest, runs gaping after\ncasualties, spends his days in anxiety and vain expectation, that\nman is miserable. And yet it is hard, you will say, to be banished\nor cast into prison: nay, what if it were to be burnt, or any other\nway destroyed? We have examples in all ages and cases, of great men\nthat have triumphed over all misfortunes. Metellus suffered exile\nresolutely, Rutilius cheerfully; Socrates disputed in the dungeon; and\nthough he might have made his escape, refused it; to show the world how\neasy a thing it was to subdue the two great terrors of mankind, _death_\nand a _jail_. Or what shall we say of Mucius Scevola, a man only of\na military courage, and without the help either of philosophy or\nletters? who, when he found that he had killed the Secretary instead of\nPorsenna, (the prince,) burnt his right hand to ashes for the mistake;\nand held his arm in the flame until it was taken away by his very\nenemies. Porsenna did more easily pardon Mucius for his intent to kill\nhim than Mucius forgave _himself_ for missing of his aim. He might have\na luckier thing, but never a braver.\nDid not Cato, in the last night of his life, take Plato to bed with\nhim, with his sword at his bed\u2019s head; the one that he might have death\nat his will, the other, that he might have it in his power; being\nresolved that no man should be able to say, either that he killed or\nthat he saved Cato? So soon as he had composed his thoughts, he took\nhis sword; \u201cFortune,\u201d says he, \u201cI have hitherto fought for my country\u2019s\nliberty, and for my own, and only that I might live free among freemen;\nbut the cause is now lost, and Cato safe.\u201d With that word he cast\nhimself upon his sword; and after the physicians that pressed in upon\nhim had bound up his wound, he tore it up again, and expired with the\nsame greatness of soul that he lived. But these are the examples, you\nwill say, of men famous in their generations.\nLet us but consult history, and we shall find, even in the most\neffeminate of nations, and the most dissolute of times, men of all\ndegrees, ages, and fortunes, nay, even women themselves, that have\novercome the fear of death: which, in truth, is so little to be\nfeared, that duly considered, it is one of the greatest benefits of\nnature. It was as great an honor for Cato, when his party was broken,\nthat he himself stood his ground, as it would have been if he had\ncarried the day, and settled an universal peace: for, it is an equal\nprudence, to make the best of a bad game, and to manage a good one. The\nday that he was _repulsed_, he _played_, and the night that he _killed_\nhimself, he _read_, as valuing the loss of his life, and the missing of\nan office at the same rate. People, I know, are apt to pronounce upon\nother men\u2019s infirmities by the measure of their own, and to think it\nimpossible that a man should be content to be burnt, wounded, killed,\nor shackled, though in some cases he may. It is only for a great mind\nto judge of great things; for otherwise, that which is our infirmity\nwill seem to be another body\u2019s, as a straight stick in the water\nappears to be crooked: he that yields, draws upon his own head his\nown ruin; for we are sure to get the better of Fortune, if we do but\nstruggle with her. Fencers and wrestlers, we see what blows and bruises\nthey endure, not only for honor, but for exercise. If we turn our backs\nonce, we are routed and pursued; that man only is happy that draws\ngood out of evil, that stands fast in his judgment, and unmoved by any\nexternal violence; or however, so little moved, that the keenest arrow\nin the quiver of Fortune is but as the prick of a needle to him rather\nthan a wound; and all her other weapons fall upon him only as hail upon\nthe roof of a house, that crackles and skips off again, without any\ndamage to the inhabitant.\nA generous and clear-sighted young man will take it for a happiness to\nencounter ill fortune. It is nothing for a man to hold up his head in\na calm; but to maintain his post when all others have quitted their\nground, and there to stand upright where other men are beaten down,\nthis is divine and praiseworthy. What ill is there in torments, or in\nthose things which we commonly account grievous crosses? The great evil\nis the want of courage, the bowing and submitting to them, which can\nnever happen to a wise man; for he stands upright under any weight;\nnothing that is to be borne displeases him; he knows his strength, and\nwhatsoever may be any man\u2019s lot, he never complains of, if it be his\nown. Nature, he says, deceives nobody; she does not tell us whether\nour children shall be fair or foul, wise or foolish, good subjects or\ntraitors, nor whether our fortune shall be good or bad. We must not\njudge of a man by his ornaments, but strip him of all the advantages\nand the impostures of Fortune, nay, of his very body too, and look into\nhis mind. If he can see a naked sword at his eyes without so much as\nwinking; if he make it a thing indifferent to him whether his life go\nout at his throat or at his mouth; if he can hear himself sentenced to\ntorments or exiles, and under the very hand of the executioner, says\nthus to himself, \u201cAll this I am provided for, and it is no more than\na man that is to suffer the fate of humanity.\u201d This is the temper of\nmind that speaks a man happy; and without this, all the confluences\nof external comforts signify no more than the personating of a king\nupon the stage; when the curtain is drawn, we are players again. Not\nthat I pretend to exempt a wise man out of a number of men, as if he\nhad no sense of pain; but I reckon him as compounded of body and soul;\nthe body is irrational, and may be galled, burnt, tortured; but the\nrational part is fearless, invincible, and not to be shaken. This\nit is that I reckon upon as the supreme good of man; which until it\nbe perfected, is but an unsteady agitation of thought, and in the\nperfection an immovable stability. It is not in our contentions with\nFortune as in those of the theatre, where we may throw down our arms,\nand pray for quarter; but here we must die firm and resolute. There\nneeds no encouragement to those things which we are inclined to by\na natural instinct, as the preservation of ourselves with ease and\npleasure; but if it comes to the trial of our faith by torments, or of\nour courage by wounds, these are difficulties that we must be armed\nagainst by philosophy and precept; and yet all this is no more than\nwhat we were born to, and no matter of wonder at all; so that a wise\nman prepares himself for it, as expecting whatsoever _may be will be_.\nMy body is frail, and liable not only to the impressions of violence,\nbut to afflictions also, that naturally succeed our pleasures. Full\nmeals bring crudities; whoring and drinking make the hands to shake\nand the knees to tremble. It is only the surprise and newness of the\nthing which makes that misfortune terrible, which, by premeditation,\nmight be made easy to us: for that which some people make light by\nsufferance, others do by foresight. Whatsoever is necessary, we must\nbear patiently. It is no new thing to die, no new thing to mourn, and\nno new thing to be merry again. Must I be _poor_? I shall have company:\nin _banishment_? I will think myself born there. If I _die_, I shall be\nno more sick; and it is a thing I cannot do but once.\nLet us never wonder at anything we are born to; for no man has reason\nto complain, where we are all in the same condition. He that escapes\nmight have suffered; and it is but equal to submit to the law of\nmortality. We must undergo the colds of winter, the heats of summer;\nthe distempers of the air, and the diseases of the body. A wild beast\nmeets us in one place, and a man that is more brutal in another; we\nare here assaulted by fire, there by water. Demetrius was reserved by\nProvidence for the age he lived in, to show, that neither the times\ncould corrupt him, nor he reform the people. He was a man of an exact\njudgment, steady to his purpose, and of a strong eloquence; not finical\nin his words, but his sense was masculine and vehement. He was so\nqualified in his life and discourse, that he served both for an example\nand a reproach. If fortune should have offered that man the government\nand possession of the whole world, upon condition not to lay it down\nagain, I dare say he would have refused it: and thus have expostulated\nthe matter with you: \u201cWhy should you tempt a freeman to put his\nshoulder under a burden; or an honest man to pollute himself with the\ndregs of mankind? Why do you offer me the spoils of princes, and of\nnations, and the price not only of your blood, but of your souls?\u201d\nIt is the part of a great mind to be temperate in prosperity,\nresolute in adversity; to despise what the vulgar admire, and to\nprefer a mediocrity to an excess. Was not Socrates oppressed with\npoverty, labor, nay, the worst of wars in his own family, a fierce\nand turbulent woman for his wife? were not his children indocile, and\nlike their mother? After seven-and-twenty years spent in arms, he\nfell under a slavery to the _thirty tyrants_, and most of them his\nbitter enemies: he came at last to be sentenced as \u201ca violater of\nreligion, a corrupter of youth, and a common enemy to God and man.\u201d\nAfter this he was imprisoned, and put to death by poison, which was\nall so far from working upon his mind, that it never so much as altered\nhis countenance. We are to bear ill accidents as unkind seasons,\ndistempers, or diseases; and why may we not reckon the actions of\nwicked men even among those accidents; their deliberations are not\ncounsels but frauds, snares, and inordinate motions of the mind; and\nthey are never without a thousand pretences and occasions of doing a\nman mischief. They have their informers, their knights of the post;\nthey can make an interest with powerful men, and one may be robbed\nas well upon the bench as upon the highway. They lie in wait for\nadvantages, and live in perpetual agitation betwixt hope and fear;\nwhereas he that is truly composed will stand all shocks, either of\nviolences, flatteries, or menaces, without perturbation. It is an\ninward fear that makes us curious after what we hear abroad.\nIt is an error to attribute either _good_ or _ill_ to _Fortune_; but\nthe _matter_ of it we may; and we ourselves are the occasion of it,\nbeing in effect the artificers of our own happiness or misery: for the\nmind is above fortune; if that be evil, it makes everything else so\ntoo; but if it be right and sincere, it corrects what is wrong, and\nmollifies what is hard, with modesty and courage. There is a great\ndifference among those that the world calls wise men. Some take up\nprivate resolutions of opposing Fortune, but they cannot go through\nwith them; for they are either dazzled with splendor on the one hand,\nor affrighted with terrors on the other; but there are others that will\nclose and grapple with Fortune, and still come off victorious.\nMucius overcame the fire; Regulus, the gibbet; Socrates, poison;\nRutilius, banishment; Cato, death; Fabricius, riches; Tubero, poverty;\nand Sextius, honors. But there are some again so delicate, that they\ncannot so much as bear a scandalous report; which is the same thing\nas if a man should quarrel for being jostled in a crowd, or dashed as\nhe walks in the streets. He that has a great way to go must expect a\nslip, to stumble, and to be tired. To the luxurious man frugality is a\npunishment; labor and industry to the sluggard; nay, study itself is a\ntorment to him; not that these things are hard to us by nature, but we\nourselves are vain and irresolute; nay, we wonder many of us, how any\nman can live without wine, or endure to rise so early in a morning.\nA brave man must expect to be tossed; for he is to steer his course\nin the teeth of Fortune, and to work against wind and weather. In the\nsuffering of torments, though there appears but one virtue, a man\nexercises many. That which is most eminent is patience, (which is but a\nbranch of fortitude.) But there is prudence also in the choice of the\naction, and in the bearing what we cannot avoid; and there is constancy\nin bearing it resolutely: and there is the same concurrence also of\nseveral virtues in other generous undertakings.\nWhen Leonidas was to carry his 300 men into the Straits of Thermopyl\u00e6,\nto put a stop to Xerxes\u2019s huge army: \u201cCome, fellow-soldiers,\u201d says he,\n\u201ceat your dinners here as if you were to sup in another world.\u201d And\nthey answered his resolution. How plain and imperious was that short\nspeech of C\u00e6ditius to his men upon a desperate action! and how glorious\na mixture was there in it both of bravery and prudence! \u201cSoldiers,\u201d\nsays he, \u201cit is necessary for us to go, but it is not necessary for us\nto return.\u201d This brief and pertinent harangue was worth ten thousand\nof the frivolous cavils and distinctions of the schools, which rather\nbreak the mind than fortify it; and when it is once perplexed and\npricked with difficulties and scruples, there they leave it. Our\npassions are numerous and strong, and not to be mastered with quirks\nand tricks, as if a man should undertake to defend the cause of God\nand man with a bulrush. It was a remarkable piece of honor and policy\ntogether, that action of C\u00e6sar\u2019s upon the taking of Pompey\u2019s cabinet at\nthe battle of Pharsalia: it is probable that the letters in it might\nhave discovered who were his friends, and who his enemies; and yet he\nburnt it without so much as opening it; esteeming it the noblest way\nof pardoning, to keep himself ignorant both of the offender and of\nthe offense. It was a brave presence of mind also in Alexander, who,\nupon advice that his physician Philip intended to poison him, took\nthe letter of advice in one hand and the cup in the other; delivering\nPhilip the letter to read while he himself drank the potion.\nSome are of opinion that death gives a man courage to support pain,\nand that pain fortifies a man against death: but I say rather, that a\nwise man depends upon himself against both, and that he does not either\nsuffer with patience, in hopes of death, or die willingly, because he\nis weary of life; but he bears the one, and waits for the other, and\ncarries a divine mind through all the accidents of human life. He looks\nupon faith and honesty as the most sacred good of mankind, and neither\nto be forced by necessity nor corrupted by reward; kill, burn, tear him\nin pieces, he will be true to his trust; and the more any man labors\nto make him discover a secret, the deeper will he hide it. Resolution\nis the inexpugnable defence of human weakness, and it is a wonderful\nProvidence that attends it.\nHoratius Cocles opposed his single body to the whole army until the\nbridge was cut down behind him and then leaped into the river with his\nsword in his hand and came off safe to his party. There was a fellow\nquestioned about a plot upon the life of a tyrant, and put to the\ntorture to declare his confederates: he named, by one and one, all the\ntyrant\u2019s friends that were about him: and still as they were named,\nthey were put to death: the tyrant asked him at last if there were any\nmore. \u201cYes,\u201d says he, \u201cyourself were in the plot; and now you have\nnever another friend left in the world:\u201d whereupon the tyrant cut the\nthroats of his own guards. \u201cHe is the happy man that is the master of\nhimself, and triumphs over the fear of death, which has overcome the\nconquerors of the world.\u201d\nCHAPTER XVII.\nOUR HAPPINESS DEPENDS IN A GREAT MEASURE UPON THE CHOICE OF OUR COMPANY.\nThe comfort of life depends upon conversation. Good offices, and\nconcord, and human society, is like the working of an arch of stone;\nall would fall to the ground if one piece did not support another.\nAbove all things let us have a tenderness for blood; and it is yet too\nlittle not to hurt, unless we profit one another. We are to relieve\nthe distressed; to put the wanderer into his way; and to divide our\nbread with the hungry: which is but the doing of good to ourselves;\nfor we are only several members of one great body. Nay, we are all of\na consanguinity; formed of the same materials, and designed to the\nsame end; this obliges us to a mutual tenderness and converse; and\nthe other, to live with a regard to equity and justice. The love of\nsociety is natural; but the choice of our company is matter of virtue\nand prudence. Noble examples stir us up to noble actions; and the\nvery history of large and public souls, inspires a man with generous\nthoughts. It makes a man long to be in action, and doing something that\nthe world may be the better for; as protecting the weak, delivering\nthe oppressed, punishing the insolent. It is a great blessing the very\nconscience of giving a good example; beside, that it is the greatest\nobligation any man can lay upon the age he lives in.\nHe that converses with the proud shall be puffed up; a lustful\nacquaintance makes a man lascivious; and the way to secure a man from\nwickedness is to withdraw from the examples of it. It is too much to\nhave them _near_ us, but more to have them _within_ us\u2014ill examples,\npleasure and ease, are, no doubt of it, great corrupters of manners.\nA rocky ground hardens the horse\u2019s hoof; the mountaineer makes the best\nsoldier; the miner makes the best pioneer, and severity of discipline\nfortifies the mind. In all excesses and extremities of good and of ill\nfortune, let us have recourse to great examples that have contemned\nboth. \u201cThese are the best instructors that teach in their lives, and\nprove their words by their actions.\u201d\nAs an ill air may endanger a good constitution, so may a place of ill\nexample endanger a good man, nay, there are some places that have a\nkind of privilege to be licentious, and where luxury and dissolution\nof manners seem to be lawful; for great examples give both authority\nand excuse to wickedness. Those places are to be avoided as dangerous\nto our manners. Hannibal himself was unmanned by the looseness of\nCampania, and though a conqueror by his arms, he was overcome by his\npleasures. I would as soon live among butchers as among cooks\u2014not but a\nman may be temperate in any place\u2014but to see drunken men staggering up\nand down everywhere, and only the spectacle of lust, luxury and excess\nbefore our eyes, it is not safe to expose ourselves to the temptation.\nIf the victorious Hannibal himself could not resist it, what shall\nbecome of us then that are subdued, and give ground to our lusts\nalready? He that has to do with an enemy in his breast, has a harder\ntask upon him than he that is to encounter one in the field; his hazard\nis greater if he loses ground, and his duty is perpetual, for he has no\nplace or time for rest. If I give way to pleasure, I must also yield to\ngrief, to poverty, to labor, ambition, anger, until I am torn to pieces\nby my misfortunes and lusts. But against all this philosophy propounds\na liberty, that is to say, a liberty from the service of accidents and\nfortune. There is not anything that does more mischief to mankind than\nmercenary masters and philosophy, that do not live as they teach\u2014they\ngive a scandal to virtue. How can any man expect that a ship should\nsteer a fortunate course, when the pilot lies wallowing in his own\nvomit? It is a usual thing first to learn to do ill ourselves, and then\nto instruct others to do so: but that man must needs be very wicked\nthat has gathered into himself the wickedness of other people.\nThe best conversation is with the philosophers\u2014that is to say, with\nsuch of them as teach us matter, not words\u2014that preach to us things\nnecessary and keep us to the practice of them. There can be no peace in\nhuman life without the contempt of all events. There is nothing that\neither puts better thoughts into a man, or sooner sets him right that\nis out of the way, than a good companion, for the example has the force\nof a precept, and touches the heart with an affection to goodness; and\nnot only the frequent hearing and seeing of a wise man delights us, but\nthe very encounter of him suggests profitable contemplation such as a\nman finds himself moved with when he goes into a holy place. I will\ntake more care with _whom_ I eat and drink than _what_, for without a\nfriend the table is a manger.\nWriting does well, but personal discourse and conversation does better;\nfor men give great credit to their ears, and take stronger impressions\nfrom example than precept. Cleanthes had never hit Zeno so to the life\nif he had not been in with him at all his privacies, if he had not\nwatched and observed him whether or not he practised as he taught.\nPlato got more from Socrates\u2019 _manners_ than from his _words_, and it\nwas not the _school_, but the company and _familiarity_ of Epicurus\nthat made Metrodorus, Hermachus and Poly\u00e6nus so famous.\nNow, though it be by instinct that we covet society, and avoid\nsolitude, we should yet take this along with us, that the more\nacquaintance the more danger: nay, there is not one man of a hundred\nthat is to be trusted with himself. If company cannot alter us, it may\ninterrupt us, and he that so much as stops upon the way loses a great\ndeal of a short life, which we yet make shorter by our inconstancy. If\nan enemy were at our heels, what haste should we make!\u2014but death is\nso, and yet we never mind it. There is no venturing of tender and easy\nnatures among the people, for it is odds that they will go over to the\nmajor party. It would, perhaps, shake the constancy of Socrates, Cato,\nL\u00e6lius, or any of us all, even when our resolutions are at the height,\nto stand the shock of vice that presses upon us with a kind of public\nauthority.\nIt is a world of mischief that may be done by one single example of\navarice or luxury. One voluptuous palate makes a great many. A wealthy\nneighbor stirs up envy, and a fleering companion moves ill-nature\nwherever he comes. What will become of those people then that expose\nthemselves to a popular violence? which is ill both ways; either if\nthey comply with the wicked, because they are many, or quarrel with\nthe multitude because they are not principled alike. The best way is\nto retire, and associate only with those that may be the better for\nus, and we for them. These respects are mutual; for while we teach, we\nlearn. To deal freely, I dare not trust myself in the hands of much\ncompany: I never go abroad that I come home again the same man I went\nout. Something or other that I had put in order is discomposed; some\npassion that I had subdued gets head again; and it is just with our\nminds as it is after a long indisposition with our bodies; we are grown\nso tender, that the least breath of air exposes us to a relapse. And it\nis no wonder if a numerous conversation be dangerous, where there is\nscarce any single man but by his discourse, example, or behavior, does\neither recommend to us, or imprint in us, or, by a kind of contagion,\ninsensibly infect us with one vice or other; and the more people\nthe greater is the peril. Especially let us have a care of public\nspectacles where wickedness insinuates itself with pleasure; and, above\nall others, let us avoid spectacles of cruelty and blood; and have\nnothing to do with those that are perpetually whining and complaining;\nthere may be faith and kindness there, but no peace. People that are\neither sad or fearful, we do commonly, for their own sakes, set a\nguard upon them, for fear they should make an ill use of being alone;\nespecially the imprudent, who are still contriving of mischief, either\nfor others or for themselves, in cherishing their lusts, or forming\ntheir designs. So much for the choice of a _companion_; we shall now\nproceed to that of a _friend_.\nCHAPTER XVIII.\nTHE BLESSINGS OF FRIENDSHIP.\nOf all felicities, the most charming is that of a _firm_ and _gentle\nfriendship_. It sweetens all our cares, dispels our sorrows, and\ncounsels us in all extremities. Nay, if there were no other comfort in\nit than the bare exercise of so generous a virtue, even for that single\nreason, a man would not be without it. Beside, that it is a sovereign\nantidote against all calamities, even against the fear of death itself.\nBut we are not to number our friends by the _visits_ that are made us;\nand to confound the decencies of _ceremony_ and _commerce_ with the\noffices of _united affections_. Caius Gracchus, and after him Livius\nDrusus, were the men that introduced among the Romans the fashion of\nseparating their visitants; some were taken into their _closet,_ others\nwere only admitted into the _antechamber_: and some, again, were fain\nto wait in the _hall_ perhaps, or in the _court_. So that they had\ntheir _first_, their _second,_ and their _third_ rate friends; but none\nof them true: only they are called so in course, as we salute strangers\nwith some title or other of respect at a venture. There is no depending\nupon those men that only take their compliment in their turn, and\nrather slip through the door than enter at it. He will find himself in\na great mistake, that either seeks for a friend in a palace, or tries\nhim at a feast.\nThe great difficulty rests in the choice of him; that is to say, in the\nfirst place, let him be virtuous, for vice is contagious, and there\nis no trusting the sound and the sick together; and he ought to be a\nwise man too, if a body knew where to find him; but in this case, he\nthat is least ill is best, and the highest degree of human prudence is\nonly the most venial folly. That friendship where men\u2019s affections are\ncemented by an equal and by a common love of goodness, it is not either\nhope or fear, or any private interest, that can ever dissolve it: but\nwe carry it with us to our graves, and lay down our lives for it with\nsatisfaction. Paulina\u2019s good and mine (says our author) were so wrapped\nup together, that in consulting her comfort I provided for my own;\nand when I could not prevail upon her to take less care for me, she\nprevailed upon me to take more care for myself.\nSome people make it a question, whether is the greatest delight, the\nenjoying of an old friendship, or the acquiring of a new one? but it\nis in the preparing of a friendship, and in the possession of it,\nas it is with the husbandman in sowing and reaping; his delight is\nthe hope of his labor in the one case, and the fruit of it in the\nother. My conversation lies among my books, but yet in the letters\nof a friend, methinks I have his company; and when I answer them, I\ndo not only write, but speak: and, in effect, a friend is an eye,\na heart, a tongue, a hand, at all distances. When friends see one\nanother personally, they do not see one another as they do when they\nare divided, where the meditation dignifies the prospect; but they are\neffectually in a great measure absent even when they are present.\nConsider their nights apart, their private studies, their separate\nemployments, and necessary visits; and they are almost as much together\ndivided as present. True friends are the whole world to one another;\nand he that is a friend to himself is also a friend to mankind. Even\nin my very studies, the greatest delight I take in what I learn is\nthe teaching of it to others; for there is no relish, methinks, in\nthe possession of anything without a partner; nay, if wisdom itself\nwere offered me upon condition only of keeping it to myself, I should\nundoubtedly refuse it.\nLucilius tells me, that he was written to by a friend, but cautions\nme withal not to say anything to him of the affair in question; for\nhe himself stands upon the same guard. What is this but to affirm and\nto deny the same thing in the same breath, in calling a man a friend,\nwhom we dare not trust as our own soul? For there must be no reserves\nin friendship: as much deliberation as you please before the league\nis struck, but no doubtings or jealousies after. It is a preposterous\nweakness to love a man before we know him, and not to care for him\nafter. It requires time to consider of a friendship, but the resolution\nonce taken, entitles him to my very heart. I look upon my thoughts to\nbe as safe in his breast as in my own: I shall, without any scruple,\nmake him the confidant of my most secret cares and counsels.\nIt goes a great way toward the making of a man faithful, to let him\nunderstand that you think him so: and he that does but so much as\nsuspect that I will deceive him gives me a kind of right to cozen him.\nWhen I am with my friend, methinks I am alone, and as much at liberty\nto speak anything as to think it, and as our hearts are one, so must be\nour interest and convenience; for friendship lays all things in common,\nand nothing can be good to the one that is ill to the other. I do not\nspeak of such a community as to destroy one another\u2019s propriety; but as\nthe father and the mother have two children, not one apiece, but each\nof them two.\nBut let us have a care, above all things, that our kindness be\nrightfully founded; for where there is any other invitation to\nfriendship than the friendship itself, that friendship will be bought\nand sold. He derogates upon the majesty of it that makes it only\ndependent upon good fortune. It is a narrow consideration for a man\nto please himself in the thought of a friend, \u201cbecause,\u201d says he, \u201cI\nshall have one to help me when I am sick, in prison, or in want.\u201d A\nbrave man should rather take delight in the contemplation of doing\nthe same offices for another. He that loves a man for his own sake is\nin an error. A friendship of interest cannot last any longer than the\ninterest itself, and this is the reason that men in prosperity are so\nmuch followed, and when a man goes down the wind, nobody comes near him.\nTemporary friends will never stand the test. One man is forsaken\nfor fear of profit, another is betrayed. It is a negotiation, not a\nfriendship, that has an eye to advantages; only, through the corruption\nof times, that which was formerly a friendship is now become a design\nupon a booty: alter your testament, and you lose your friend. But my\nend of friendship is to have one dearer to me than myself, and for\nthe saving of whose life I would cheerfully lay down my own; taking\nthis along with me, that only wise men can be friends, others are but\ncompanions; and that there is a great difference also betwixt love and\nfriendship; the one may sometimes do us hurt, the other always does us\ngood, for the one friend is hopeful to another in all cases, as well in\nprosperity as in affliction. We receive comfort, even at a distance,\nfrom those we love, but then it is light and faint; whereas, presence\nand conversation touch us to the quick, especially if we find the man\nwe love to be such a person as we wish.\nIt is usual with princes to reproach the living by commending the dead,\nand to praise those people for speaking truth from whom there is no\nlonger any danger of hearing it. This is Augustus\u2019s case: he was forced\nto banish his daughter Julia for her common and prostituted impudence;\nand still upon fresh informations, he was often heard to say, \u201cIf\nAgrippa or Mecenas had been now alive, this would never have been.\u201d But\nyet where the fault lay may be a question; for perchance it was his\nown, that had rather complain for the want of them than seek for others\nas good. The Roman losses by war and by fire, Augustus could quickly\nsupply and repair; but for the loss of two friends he lamented his\nwhole life after.\nXerxes, (a vain and a foolish prince) when he made war upon Greece, one\ntold him, \u201cIt would never come to a battle\u201d;another, \u201cThat he would\nfind only empty cities and countries, for they would not so much as\nstand the very fame of his coming;\u201d others soothed him in the opinion\nof his _prodigious numbers_; and they all concurred to puff him up to\nhis destruction; only Damaratus advised him not to depend too much upon\nhis numbers, for he would rather find them a burden to him than an\nadvantage: and that three hundred men in the straits of the mountains\nwould be sufficient to give a check to his whole army; and that such an\naccident would undoubtedly turn his vast numbers to his confusion. It\nfell out afterward as he foretold, and he had thanks for his fidelity.\nA miserable prince, that among so many thousand subjects had but one\nservant to tell him the truth!\nCHAPTER XIX.\nHE THAT WOULD BE HAPPY MUST TAKE AN ACCOUNT OF HIS TIME.\nIn the distribution of human life, we find that a great part of it\npasses away in _evil doing_; a greater yet in doing just _nothing at\nall_: and effectually the whole in doing things _beside our business_.\nSome hours we bestow upon ceremony and servile attendances; some upon\nour pleasures, and the remainder runs at waste. What a deal of time\nis it that we spend in hopes and fears, love and revenge, in balls,\ntreats, making of interests, suing for offices, soliciting of causes,\nand slavish flatteries! The shortness of life, I know, is the common\ncomplaint both of fools and philosophers; as if the time we have were\nnot sufficient for our duties. But it is with our lives as with our\nestates, a good husband makes a little go a great way; whereas, let\nthe revenue of a prince fall into the hands of a prodigal, it is gone\nin a moment. So that the time allotted us, if it were well employed,\nwere abundantly enough to answer all the ends and purposes of mankind.\nBut we squander it away in avarice, drink, sleep, luxury, ambition,\nfawning addresses, envy, rambling, voyages, impertinent studies,\nchange of counsels, and the like; and when our portion is spent, we\nfind the want of it, though we gave no heed to it in the passage:\ninsomuch, that we have rather _made_ our life short than _found_ it\nso. You shall have some people perpetually playing with their fingers,\nwhistling, humming, and talking to themselves; and others consume their\ndays in the composing, hearing, or reciting of songs and lampoons. How\nmany precious morning hours do we spend in consultation with barbers,\ntailors, and tire-women, patching and painting betwixt the comb and\nthe glass! A council must be called upon every hair we cut; and one\ncurl amiss is as much as a body\u2019s life is worth. The truth is, we are\nmore solicitous about our dress than our manners, and about the order\nof our periwigs than that of the government. At this rate, let us but\ndiscount, out of a life of a hundred years, that time which has been\nspent upon popular negotiations, frivolous amours, domestic brawls,\nsauntering up and down to no purpose, diseases that we have brought\nupon ourselves, and this large extent of life will not amount perhaps\nto the minority of another man. It is a _long being_, but perchance a\n_short life_. And what is the reason of all this? We live as we should\nnever die, and without any thought of human frailty, when yet the very\nmoment we bestow upon this man or thing, may, peradventure, be our\nlast. But the greatest loss of time is delay and expectation, which\ndepend upon the future. We let go the present, which we have in our\nown power; we look forward to that which depends upon Fortune; and so\nquit a certainty for an uncertainty. We should do by time as we do by a\ntorrent, make use of it while we have it, for it will not last always.\nThe calamities of human nature may be divided into the _fear of death_,\nand the _miseries and errors of life_. And it is the great work of\nmankind to master the one, and to rectify the other; and so live as\nneither to make life irksome to us, nor death terrible. It should be\nour care, before we are old, to live well, and when we are so, to die\nwell; that we may expect our end without sadness: for it is the duty of\nlife to prepare ourselves for death; and there is not an hour we live\nthat does not mind us of our mortality.\nTime runs on, and all things have their fate, though it lies in the\ndark. The period is certain to nature, but what am I the better for it\nif it be not so to me? We propound travels, arms, adventures, without\never considering that death lies in the way. Our term is set, and\nnone of us know how near it is; but we are all of us agreed that the\ndecree is unchangeable. Why should we wonder to have that befall us\nto-day which might have happened to us any minute since we were born?\nLet us therefore live as if every moment were to be our last, and set\nour accounts right every day that passes over our heads. We are not\nready for death, and therefore we fear it, because we do not know what\nwill become of us when we are gone, and that consideration strikes us\nwith an inexplicable terror. The way to avoid this distraction is to\ncontract our business and our thoughts\u2014when the mind is once settled,\na day or an age is all one to us; and the series of time, which is now\nour trouble will be then our delight; for he that is steadily resolved\nagainst all uncertainties, shall never be disturbed with the variety of\nthem. Let us make haste, therefore, to live, since every day to a wise\nman is a new life\u2014for he has done his business the day before, and so\nprepared himself for the next, that if it be not his last, he knows\nyet that it might have been so. No man enjoys the true taste of life\nbut he that is willing and ready to quit it.\nThe wit of man is not able to express the blindness of human folly in\ntaking so much more care of our fortunes, our houses, and our money,\nthan we do of our lives\u2014everybody breaks in upon the one _gratis_, but\nwe betake ourselves to fire and sword if any man invades the other.\nThere is no dividing in the case of patrimony, but people share our\ntime with us at pleasure, so profuse are we of that only thing whereof\nwe may be honestly covetous. It is a common practice to ask an hour\nor two of a friend for such or such a business, and it is as easily\ngranted, both parties only considering the occasion, and not the thing\nitself. They never put time to account, which is the most valuable of\nall precious things; but because they do not see it they reckon upon\nit as nothing: and yet these easy men when they come to die would give\nthe whole world for those hours again which they so inconsiderately\ncast away before; but there is no recovering of them. If they could\nnumber their days that are yet to come as they can those that are\nalready past, how would those very people tremble at the apprehension\nof death, though a hundred years hence, that never so much as think of\nit at present, though they know not but it may take them away the next\nimmediate minute!\nIt is an usual saying \u201cI would give my life for such or such a friend,\u201d\nwhen, at the same time, we do give it without so much as thinking\nof it; nay, when that friend is never the better for it, and we\nourselves the worse. Our time is set, and day and night we travel on.\nThere is no baiting by the way, and it is not in the power of either\nprince or people to prolong it. Such is the love of life, that even\nthose decrepit dotards that have lost the use of it will yet beg the\ncontinuance of it, and make themselves younger than they are, as if\nthey could cozen even Fate itself! When they fall sick, what promises\nof amendment if they escape that bout! What exclamations against the\nfolly of their misspent time\u2014and yet if they recover, they relapse. No\nman takes care to live well, but long; when yet it is in everybody\u2019s\npower to do the former, and in no man\u2019s to do the latter. We consume\nour lives in providing the very instruments of life, and govern\nourselves still with a regard to the future, so that we do not properly\nlive, but we are about to live. How great a shame is it to be laying\nnew foundations of life at our last gasp, and for an old man (that can\nonly prove his age by his beard,) with one foot in the grave, to go to\nschool again! While we are young we may learn; our minds are tractable\nand our bodies fit for labor and study; but when age comes on, we are\nseized with languor and sloth, afflicted with diseases, and at last\nwe leave the world as ignorant as we came into it\u2014only we _die_ worse\nthan we were _born_, which is none of Nature\u2019s fault, but ours; for our\nfears, suspicions, perfidy, etc., are from ourselves.\nI wish with all my soul that I had thought of my end sooner, but I must\nmake the more haste now and spur on like those that set out late upon\na journey\u2014it will be better to learn late than not at all\u2014though it be\nbut only to instruct me how I may leave the stage with honor.\nIn the division of life, there is time _present_, _past_, and _to\ncome_. What we _do_ is _short_, what we _shall do_ is _doubtful_, but\nwhat we _have done_ is _certain_, and out of the power of fortune. The\npassage of time is wonderfully quick, and a man must look backward to\nsee it; and, in that retrospect, he has all past ages at a view; but\nthe present gives us the slip unperceived. It is but a moment that we\nlive, and yet we are dividing it into _childhood_, _youth_, _man\u2019s\nestate_, and _old age_, all which degrees we bring into that narrow\ncompass. If we do not watch, we lose our opportunities; if we do not\nmake haste, we are left behind; our best hours escape us, the worst are\nto come. The purest part of our life runs first, and leaves only the\ndregs at the bottom; and \u201cthat time which is good for nothing else, we\ndedicate to virtue;\u201d and only propound to begin to live at an age that\nvery few people arrive at. What greater folly can there be in the world\nthan this loss of time, the future being so uncertain, and the damages\nso irreparable? If death be necessary, why should any man fear it? and\nif the time of it be uncertain, why should not we always expect it? We\nshould therefore first prepare ourselves by a virtuous life against the\ndread of an inevitable death; and it is not for us to put off being\ngood until such or such a business is over, for one business draws on\nanother, and we do as good as sow it, one grain produces more. It is\nnot enough to philosophize when we have nothing else to do, but we must\nattend wisdom even to the neglect of all things else; for we are so far\nfrom having time to spare, that the age of the world would be yet too\nnarrow for our business; nor is it sufficient not to omit it, but we\nmust not so much as intermit it.\nThere is nothing that we can properly call our own but our time, and\nyet every body fools us out of it that has a mind to it. If a man\nborrows a paltry sum of money, there must be bonds and securities, and\nevery common civility is charged upon account; but he that has my time,\nthinks he owes me nothing for it, though it be a debt that gratitude\nitself can never repay. I cannot call any man poor that has enough\nstill left, be it never so little: it is good advice yet to those that\nhave the world before them, to play the good husbands betimes, for it\nis too late to spare at the bottom, when all is drawn out to the lees.\nHe that takes away a day from me, takes away what he can never restore\nme. But our time is either _forced away_ from us, or _stolen_ from us,\nor _lost_; of which the last is the foulest miscarriage. It is in life\nas in a journey; a book or a companion brings us to our lodging before\nwe thought we were half-way. Upon the whole matter we consume ourselves\none upon another, without any regard at all to our own particular. I\ndo not speak of such as live in notorious scandal, but even those men\nthemselves, whom the world pronounces happy, are smothered in their\nfelicities, servants to their professions and clients, and drowned\nin their lusts. We are apt to complain of the haughtiness of _great\nmen_, when yet there is hardly any of them all so proud but that, at\nsome time or other, a man may yet have access to him, and perhaps a\ngood word or look into the bargain. Why do we not rather complain of\n_ourselves_, for being of all others, even to ourselves, the most deaf\nand inaccessible.\nCompany and business are great devourers of time, and our vices destroy\nour lives as well as our fortunes. The present is but a moment, and\nperpetually in flux; the time past, we call to mind when we please, and\nit will abide the examination and inspection. But the busy man has\nnot leisure to look back, or if he has, it is an unpleasant thing to\nreflect upon a life to be repented of, whereas the conscience of a good\nlife puts a man into a secure and perpetual possession of a felicity\nnever to be disturbed or taken away: but he that has led a wicked life\nis afraid of his own memory; and, in the review of himself, he finds\nonly appetite, avarice, or ambition, instead of virtue. But still he\nthat is not at leisure many times to live, must, when his fate comes,\nwhether he will or not, be at leisure to die. Alas! what is time to\neternity? the age of a man to the age of the world? And how much of\nthis little do we spend in fears, anxieties, tears, childhood! nay, we\nsleep away the one half. How great a part of it runs away in luxury\nand excess: the ranging of our guests, our servants, and our dishes!\nAs if we were to eat and drink not for satiety, but ambition. The\nnights may well seem short that are so dear bought, and bestowed upon\nwine and women; the day is lost in expectation of the night, and the\nnight in the apprehension of the morning. There is a terror in our very\npleasures; and this vexatious thought in the very height of them, that\n_they will not last always_: which is a canker in the delights, even of\nthe greatest and the most fortunate of men.\nCHAPTER XX.\nHAPPY IS THE MAN THAT MAY CHOOSE HIS OWN BUSINESS.\nOh the blessings of privacy and leisure! The wish of the powerful\nand eminent, but the privilege only of inferiors; who are the only\npeople that live to themselves: nay, the very thought and hope of it\nis a consolation, even in the middle of all the tumults and hazards\nthat attend greatness. It was Augustus\u2019 prayer, that he might live to\nretire and deliver himself from public business: his discourses were\nstill pointing that way, and the highest felicity which this mighty\nprince had in prospect, was the divesting himself of that illustrious\nstate, which, how glorious soever in show, had at the bottom of it\nonly anxiety and care. But it is one thing to retire for pleasure, and\nanother thing for virtue, which must be active even in that retreat,\nand give proof of what it has learned: for a good and a wise man does\nin privacy consult the well-being of posterity. Zeno and Chrysippus\ndid greater things in their studies than if they had led armies, borne\noffices, or given laws; which in truth they did, not to one city alone,\nbut to all mankind: their _quiet_ contributed more to the common\nbenefit than the _sweat_ and _labor_ of other people. That retreat is\nnot worth the while which does not afford a man greater and nobler work\nthan business. There is no slavish attendance upon great officers,\nno canvassing for places, no making of parties, no disappointments in\nmy pretension to this charge, to that regiment, or to such or such a\ntitle, no envy of any man\u2019s favor or fortune; but a calm enjoyment of\nthe general bounties of Providence in company with a good conscience.\nA wise man is never so busy as in the solitary contemplation of God\nand the works of Nature. He withdraws himself to attend the service of\nfuture ages: and those counsels which he finds salutary to himself, he\ncommits to writing for the good of after-times, as we do the receipts\nof sovereign antidotes or balsams. He that is well employed in his\nstudy, though he may seem to do nothing at all, does the greatest\nthings yet of all others, in affairs both human and divine. To supply a\nfriend with a sum of money, or give my voice for an office, these are\nonly private and particular obligations: but he that lays down precepts\nfor the governing of our lives and the moderating of our passions,\nobliges human nature not only in the present, but in all succeeding\ngenerations.\nHe that would be at quiet, let him repair to his philosophy, a study\nthat has credit with all sorts of men. The eloquence of the bar, or\nwhatsoever else addresses to the people, is never without enemies; but\nphilosophy minds its own business, and even the worst have an esteem\nfor it. There can never be such a conspiracy against virtue, the world\ncan never be so wicked, but the very name of a _philosopher_ shall\nstill continue venerable and sacred. And yet philosophy itself must be\nhandled modestly and with caution. But what shall we say of Cato then,\nfor his meddling in the broil of a civil war, and interposing himself\nin the quarrel betwixt two enraged princes? He that, when Rome was\nsplit into _two factions_ betwixt Pompey and C\u00e6sar, declared himself\nagainst _both_. I speak this of Cato\u2019s last part; for in his former\ntime the commonwealth was made unfit for a wise man\u2019s administration.\nAll he could do then was but bawling and beating of the air: one while\nhe was lugged and tumbled by the rabble, spit upon and dragged out of\nthe _forum_, and then again hurried out of the senate-house to prison.\nThere are some things which we propound originally, and others which\nfall in as accessory to another proposition. If a wise man retire, it\nis no matter whether he does it because the commonwealth was wanting to\nhim, or because he was wanting to it. But to what republic shall a man\nbetake himself? Not to Athens, where Socrates was condemned, and whence\nAristotle fled, for fear he should have been condemned too, and where\nvirtue was oppressed by envy: not to Carthage, where there was nothing\nbut tyranny, injustice, cruelty, and ingratitude. There is scarce any\ngovernment to be found that will either endure a wise man, or which a\nwise man will endure; so that privacy is made necessary, because the\nonly thing which is better is nowhere to be had. A man may commend\nnavigation, and yet caution us against those seas that are troublesome\nand dangerous: so that he does as good as command me not to weigh\nanchor that commends sailing only upon these terms. He that is a slave\nto business is the most wretched of slaves.\n\u201cBut how shall I get myself at liberty? We can run any hazards for\nmoney: take any pains for honor; and why do we not venture also\nsomething for leisure and freedom? without which we must expect to live\nand die in a tumult: for so long as we live in public, business breaks\nin upon us, as one billow drives on another; and there is no avoiding\nit with either modesty or quiet.\u201d It is a kind of whirlpool, that sucks\na man in, and he can never disengage himself. A man of business cannot\nin truth be said to live, and not one of a thousand understands how to\ndo it: for how to live, and how to die, is the lesson of every moment\nof our lives: all other arts have their masters.\nAs a busy life is always a miserable life, so it is the greatest of all\nmiseries to be perpetually employed upon _other people\u2019s business_;\nfor to sleep, to eat, to drink, at their hour; to walk their pace, and\nto love and hate as they do, is the vilest of servitudes. Now, though\nbusiness must be quitted, let it not be done unseasonably; the longer\nwe defer it, the more we endanger our liberty; and yet we must no more\nfly before the time than linger when the time comes: or, however, we\nmust not love business for business\u2019 sake, nor indeed do we, but for\nthe profit that goes along with it: for we love the reward of misery,\nthough we hate the misery itself. Many people, I know, seek business\nwithout choosing it, and they are even weary of their lives without it\nfor want of entertainment in their own thoughts; the hours are long\nand hateful to them when they are alone, and they seem as short on the\nother side in their debauches. When they are no longer _candidates_,\nthey are _suffragans_; when they give over other people\u2019s business,\nthey do their own; and pretend business, but they make it, and value\nthemselves upon being thought men of employment.\nLiberty is the thing which they are perpetually a-wishing, and never\ncome to obtain: a thing never to be bought nor sold, but a man must\nask it of himself, and give it to himself. He that has given proof of\nhis virtue in public, should do well to make a trial of it in private\nalso. It is not that solitude, or a country life, teaches innocence or\nfrugality; but vice falls of itself, without witnesses and spectators,\nfor the thing it designs is to be taken notice of. Did ever any man\nput on rich clothes not to be seen? or spread the pomp of his luxury\nwhere nobody was to take notice of it? If it were not for admirers and\nspectators there would be no temptations to excess: the very keeping\nof us from exposing them cures us of desiring them, for vanity and\nintemperance are fed with ostentation.\nHe that has lived at sea in a storm, let him retire and die in the\nhaven; but let his retreat be without ostentation, and wherein he may\nenjoy himself with a good conscience, without the want, the fear, the\nhatred, or the desire, of anything, not out of malevolent detestation\nof mankind, but for satisfaction and repose. He that shuns both\nbusiness and men, either out of envy, or any other discontent, his\nretreat is but to the life of a mole: nor does he live to himself, as\na wise man does, but to his bed, his belly, and his lusts. Many people\nseem to retire out of a weariness of public affairs, and the trouble of\ndisappointments; and yet ambition finds them out even in that recess\ninto which fear and weariness had cast them; and so does luxury, pride,\nand most of the distempers of a public life.\nThere are many that lie close, not that they may live securely, but\nthat they may transgress more privately: it is their conscience, not\ntheir states, that makes them keep a porter; for they live at such a\nrate, that to be seen before they be aware is to be detected. Crates\nsaw a young man walking by himself; \u201cHave a care,\u201d says he \u201cof lewd\ncompany.\u201d Some men are busy in idleness, and make peace more laborious\nand troublesome than war; nay, and more wicked too, when they bestow it\nupon such lusts, and other vices, which even the license of a military\nlife would not endure. We cannot call these people men of leisure that\nare wholly taken up with their pleasures. A troublesome life is much\nto be preferred before a slothful one; and it is a strange thing,\nmethinks, that any man should fear death that has buried himself alive;\nas privacy without letters is but the burying of a man quick.\nThere are some that make a boast of their retreat, which is but a kind\nof lazy ambition; they retire to make people talk of them, whereas I\nwould rather withdraw to speak to myself. And what shall that be, but\nthat which we are apt to speak of one another? I will speak ill of\nmyself: I will examine, accuse, and punish my infirmities. I have no\ndesign to be cried up for a great man, that has renounced the world in\na contempt of the vanity and madness of human life; I blame nobody but\nmyself, and I address only to myself. He that comes to me for help is\nmistaken, for I am not a physician, but a patient: and I shall be well\nenough content to have it said, when any man leaves me, \u201cI took him\nfor a happy and a learned man, and truly I find no such matter.\u201d I had\nrather have my retreat pardoned than envied.\nThere are some creatures that confound their footing about their dens,\nthat they may not be found out, and so should a wise man in the case of\nhis retirement. When the door is open, the thief passes it by as not\nworth his while; but when it is bolted and sealed, it is a temptation\nfor people to be prying. To have it said \u201cthat such a one is never\nout of his study, and sees nobody,\u201d etc.; this furnishes matter for\ndiscourse. He that makes his retirement too strict and severe, does as\ngood as call company to take notice of it.\nEvery man knows his own constitution; one eases his stomach by\nvomit\u2014another supports it with good nourishment; he that has the gout\nforbears wine and bathing, and every man applies to the part that is\nmost infirm. He that shows a gouty foot, a lame hand, or contracted\nnerves, shall be permitted to lie still and attend his cure; and why\nnot so in the vices of his mind! We must discharge all impediments and\nmake way for philosophy, as a study inconsistent with common business.\nTo all other things we must deny ourselves openly and frankly, when we\nare sick refuse visits, keep ourselves close, and lay aside all public\ncares, and shall we not do as much when we philosophize? Business is\nthe drudgery of the world, and only fit for slaves, but contemplation\nis the work of wise men. Not but that solitude and company may be\nallowed to take their turns: the one creates in us the love of mankind,\nthe other that of ourselves; solitude relieves us when we are sick of\ncompany, and conversation when we are weary of being alone; so that\nthe one cures the other. \u201cThere is no man,\u201d in fine, \u201cso miserable as\nhe that is at a loss how to spend his time.\u201d He is restless in his\nthoughts, unsteady in his counsels, dissatisfied with the present,\nsolicitous for the future; whereas he that prudently computes his\nhours and his business, does not only fortify himself against the\ncommon accidents of life, but improves the most rigorous dispensations\nof Providence to his comfort, and stands firm under all the trials of\nhuman weakness.\nCHAPTER XXI.\nTHE CONTEMPT OF DEATH MAKES ALL THE MISERIES OF LIFE EASY TO US.\nIt is a hard task to master the natural desire of life by a\nphilosophical contempt of death, and to convince the world that there\nis no hurt in it, and crush an opinion that was brought up with us from\nour cradles. What help? what encouragement? what shall we say to human\nfrailty, to carry it fearless through the fury of flames, and upon the\npoints of swords? what rhetoric shall we use to bear down the universal\nconsent of people to so dangerous an error? The captious and superfine\nsubtleties of the schools will never do the work: these speak many\nthings sharp, but utterly unnecessary, and void of effect. The truth\nof it is, there is but one chain that holds all the world in bondage,\nand that is the love of life. It is not that I propound the making of\ndeath so indifferent to us, as it is, whether a man\u2019s hairs be even or\nodd; for what with self-love, and an implanted desire in every being of\npreserving itself, and a long acquaintance betwixt the soul and body,\nfriends may be loth to part, and death may carry an appearance of evil,\nthough in truth it is itself no evil at all. Beside, that we are to go\nto a strange place in the dark, and under great uncertainties of our\nfuture state; so that people die in terror, because they do not know\nwhither they are to go, and they are apt to fancy the worst of what\nthey do not understand: these thoughts are indeed sufficient to startle\na man of great resolution without a wonderful support from above. And,\nmoreover, our natural scruples and infirmities are assisted by the wits\nand fancies of all ages, in their infamous and horrid description of\nanother world: nay, taking it for granted that there will be no reward\nand punishment, they are yet more afraid of an annihilation than of\nhell itself.\nBut what is it we fear? \u201cOh! it is a terrible thing to die.\u201d Well;\nand is it not better once to suffer it, than always to fear it? The\nearth itself suffers both _with_ me, and _before_ me. How many islands\nare swallowed up in the sea! how many towns do we sail over! nay, how\nmany nations are wholly lost, either by inundations or earthquakes!\nand shall I be afraid of my little body? why should I, that am sure\nto die, and that all other things are mortal, be fearful of coming to\nmy last gasp myself? It is the fear of death that makes us base, and\ntroubles and destroys the life we would preserve; that aggravates all\ncircumstances, and makes them formidable. We depend but upon a flying\nmoment. Die we must; but when? what is that to us? It is the law of\nNature, the tribute of mortals, and the remedy of all evils. It is only\nthe disguise that affrights us; as children that are terrified with\na vizor. Take away the instruments of death, the fire, the ax, the\nguards, the executioners, the whips, and the racks; take away the pomp,\nI say, and the circumstances that accompany it, and death is no more\nthan what my slave yesterday contemned; the pain is nothing to a fit of\nthe stone; if it be tolerable, it is not great; and if intolerable,\nit cannot last long. There is nothing that Nature has made necessary\nwhich is more easy than death: we are longer a-coming into the world\nthan going out of it; and there is not any minute of our lives wherein\nwe may not reasonably expect it. Nay, it is but a moment\u2019s work, the\nparting of the soul and body. What a shame is it then to stand in fear\nof anything so long that is over so soon!\nNor is it any great matter to overcome this fear; for we have examples\nas well of the _meanest_ of men as of the greatest that have done it.\nThere was a fellow to be exposed upon the theatre, who in disdain\nthrust a stick down his own throat, and choked himself; and another on\nthe same occasion, pretended to nod upon the chariot, as if he were\nasleep, cast his head betwixt the spokes of the wheel, and kept his\nseat until his neck was broken. Caligula, upon a dispute with Canius\nJulius; \u201cDo not flatter yourself,\u201d says he, \u201cfor I have given orders to\nput you to death.\u201d \u201cI thank your most gracious Majesty for it,\u201d says\nCanius, giving to understand, perhaps, that under his government death\nwas a mercy: for he knew that Caligula seldom failed of being as good\nas his word in that case. He was at play when the officer carried him\naway to his execution, and beckoning to the centurion, \u201cPray,\u201d says\nhe, \u201cwill you bear me witness, when I am dead and gone, that I had the\nbetter of the game?\u201d He was a man exceedingly beloved and lamented,\nand, for a farewell, after he had preached moderation to his friends;\n\u201cYou,\u201d says he, \u201care here disputing about the immortality of the soul,\nand I am now going to learn the truth of it. If I discover any thing\nupon that point, you shall hear of it.\u201d Nay, the most timorous of\ncreatures, when they see there is no escaping, they oppose themselves\nto all dangers; the despair gives them courage, and the necessity\novercomes the fear. Socrates was thirty days in prison after his\nsentence, and had time enough to have starved himself, and so to have\nprevented the poison: but he gave the world the blessing of his life\nas long as he could, and took that fatal draught in the meditation and\ncontempt of death.\nMarcellinus, in a deliberation upon death, called several of his\nfriends about him: one was fearful, and advised what he himself would\nhave done in the case; another gave the counsel which he thought\nMarcellinus would like best; but a friend of his that was a Stoic, and\na stout man, reasoned the matter to him after this manner; Marcellinus\ndo not trouble yourself, as if it were such a mighty business that you\nhave now in hand; it is nothing to _live_; all your servants do it,\nnay, your very beasts too; but to die honestly and resolutely, that\nis a great point. Consider with yourself there is nothing pleasant in\nlife but what you have tasted already, and that which is to come is\nbut the same over again; and how many men are there in the world that\nrather choose to die than to suffer the nauseous tediousness of the\nrepetition? Upon which discourse he fasted himself to death. It was\nthe custom of Pacuvius to solemnize, in a kind of pageantry, every day\nhis own funeral. When he had swilled and gormandized to a luxurious\nand beastly excess, he was carried away from supper to bed with this\nsong and acclamation, \u201cHe has lived, he has lived.\u201d That which he did\nin lewdness, will become us to do in sobriety and prudence. If it\nshall please God to add another day to our lives, let us thankfully\nreceive it; but, however, it is our happiest and securest course so\nto compose ourselves to-night, that we may have no anxious dependence\non to-morrow. \u201cHe that can say, I have lived this day, makes the next\nclear again.\u201d\nDeath is the worst that either the severity of laws or the cruelty of\ntyrants can impose upon us; and it is the utmost extent of the dominion\nof Fortune. He that is fortified against that, must, consequently, be\nsuperior to all other difficulties that are put in the way to it. Nay,\nand on some occasions, it requires more courage to live than to die.\nHe that is not prepared for death shall be perpetually troubled, as\nwell with vain apprehensions, as with real dangers. It is not death\nitself that is dreadful, but the fear of it that goes before it. When\nthe mind is under a consternation, there is no state of life that can\nplease us; for we do not so endeavor to avoid mischiefs as to run away\nfrom them, and the greatest slaughter is upon a flying enemy. Had not\na man better breathe out his last once for all, than lie agonizing\nin pains, consuming by inches, losing of his blood by drops? and yet\nhow many are there that are ready to betray their country, and their\nfriends, and to prostitute their very wives and daughters, to preserve\na miserable carcass! Madmen and children have no apprehension of death;\nand it were a shame that our reason should not do as much toward our\nsecurity as their folly. But the great matter is to die considerately\nand cheerfully upon the foundation of virtue; for life in itself is\nirksome, and only eating and drinking in a circle.\nHow many are there that, betwixt the apprehensions of death and the\nmiseries of life, are at their wits\u2019 end what to do with themselves?\nWherefore let us fortify ourselves against those calamities from which\nthe prince is no more exempt than the beggar. Pompey the Great had his\nhead taken off by a boy and a eunuch, (young Ptolemy and Photinus.)\nCaligula commanded the tribune D\u00e6cimus to kill Lepidus; and another\ntribune (Ch\u00e6reus) did as much for Caligula. Never was a man so great\nbut he was as liable to suffer mischief as he was able to do it. Has\nnot a thief, or an enemy, your throat at his mercy? nay, and the\nmeanest of servants has the power of life and death over his master;\nfor whosoever contemns his own life may be master of another body\u2019s.\nYou will find in story, that the displeasure of servants has been as\nfatal as that of tyrants: and what matters it the power of him we\nfear, when the thing we fear is in every body\u2019s power? Suppose I fall\ninto the hands of an enemy, and the conqueror condemns me to be led\nin triumph; it is but carrying me thither whither I should have gone\nwithout him, that is to say, toward death, whither I have been marching\never since I was born. It is the fear of our last hour that disquiets\nall the rest. By the justice of all constitutions, mankind is condemned\nto a capital punishment; now, how despicable would that man appear,\nwho, being sentenced to death in common with the whole world, should\nonly petition that he might be the last man brought to the block?\nSome men are particularly afraid of thunder, and yet extremely careless\nof other and of greater dangers: as if that were all they have to\nfear. Will not a sword, a stone, a fever, do the work as well? Suppose\nthe bolt should hit us, it were yet braver to die with a stroke than\nwith the bare apprehension of it: beside the vanity of imagining\nthat heaven and earth should be put into such a disorder only for the\ndeath of one man. A good and a brave man is not moved with lightning,\ntempest, or earthquakes; but perhaps he would voluntarily plunge\nhimself into that gulf, where otherwise he should only fall. The\ncutting of a corn, or the swallowing of a fly, is enough to dispatch a\nman; and it is no matter how great that is that brings me to my death,\nso long as death itself is but little. Life is a small matter; but it\nis a matter of importance to contemn it. Nature, that begat us, expels\nus, and a better and a safer place is provided for us. And what is\ndeath but a ceasing to be what we were before? We are kindled and put\nout: to cease to be, and not to begin to be, is the same thing. We die\ndaily, and while we are growing, our life decreases; every moment that\npasses takes away part of it; all that is past is lost; nay, we divide\nwith death the very instant that we live. As the last sand in the glass\ndoes not measure the hour, but finishes it; so the last moment that\nwe live does not make up death, but concludes. There are some that\npray more earnestly for death than we do for life; but it is better to\nreceive it cheerfully when it comes than to hasten it before the time.\n\u201cBut what is it that we would live any longer for?\u201d Not for our\npleasures; for those we have tasted over and over, even to satiety: so\nthat there is no point of luxury that is new to us. \u201cBut a man would be\nloth to leave his country and his friends behind him;\u201d that is to say,\nhe would have them go first; for that is the least part of his care.\n\u201cWell; but I would fain live to do more good, and discharge myself\nin the offices of life;\u201d as if to die were not the duty of every man\nthat lives. We are loth to leave our possessions; and no man swims\nwell with his luggage. We are all of us equally fearful of death, and\nignorant of life; but what can be more shameful than to be solicitous\nupon the brink of security? If death be at any time to be feared, it\nis always to be feared; but the way never to fear it, is to be often\nthinking of it. To what end is it to put off for a little while that\nwhich we cannot avoid? He that dies does but follow him that is dead.\n\u201cWhy are we then so long afraid of that which is so little awhile of\ndoing?\u201d How miserable are those people that spend their lives in the\ndismal apprehensions of death! for they are beset on all hands, and\nevery minute in dread of a surprise. We must therefore look about us,\nas if we were in an enemy\u2019s country; and consider our last hour, not as\na punishment, but as the law of Nature: the fear of it is a continual\npalpitation of the heart, and he that overcomes that terror shall never\nbe troubled with any other.\nLife is a navigation; we are perpetually wallowing and dashing one\nagainst another; sometimes we suffer shipwreck, but we are always in\ndanger and in expectation of it. And what is it when it comes, but\neither the end of a journey, or a passage? It is as great a folly to\nfear _death_ as to fear _old age_; nay, as to fear life itself; for he\nthat would not die ought not to live, since death is the condition of\nlife. Beside that it is a madness to fear a thing that is certain; for\nwhere there is no doubt, there is no place for fear.\nWe are still chiding of Fate, and even those that exact the most\nrigorous justice betwixt man and man are yet themselves unjust to\nProvidence. \u201cWhy was such a one taken away in the prime of his years?\u201d\nAs if it were the number of years that makes death easy to us, and not\nthe temper of the mind. He that would live a little longer to-day,\nwould be as loth to die a hundred years hence. But which is more\nreasonable for us to obey Nature, or for Nature to obey us? Go we must\nat last, and no matter how soon. It is the work of Fate to make us live\nlong, but it is the business of virtue to make a short life sufficient.\nLife is to be measured by action, not by time; a man may die old at\nthirty, and young at fourscore: nay, the one lives after death, and\nthe other perished before he died. I look upon age among the effects\nof chance. How long I shall live is in the power of others, but it is\nin my own how well. The largest space of time is to live till a man is\nwise. He that dies of old age does no more than go to bed when he is\nweary. Death is the test of life, and it is that only which discovers\nwhat we are, and distinguishes betwixt ostentation and virtue. A man\nmay dispute, cite great authorities, talk learnedly, huff it out, and\nyet be rotten at heart. But let us soberly attend our business: and\nsince it is uncertain _when_, or _where_, we shall die, let us look for\ndeath in all places, and at all times: we can never study that point\ntoo much, which we can never come to experiment whether we know it or\nnot. It is a blessed thing to dispatch the business of life before we\ndie, and then to expect death in the possession of a happy life. He is\nthe great man who is willing to die when his life is pleasant to him.\nAn honest life is not a greater good than an honest death. How many\nbrave young men, by an instinct of Nature, are carried on to great\nactions, and even to the contempt of all hazards!\nIt is childish to go out of the world groaning and wailing as we came\ninto it. Our bodies must be thrown away, as the secundine that wraps\nup the infant, the other being only the covering of the soul; we shall\nthen discover the secrets of Nature; the darkness shall be discussed,\nand our souls irradiated with light and glory: a glory without a\nshadow; a glory that shall surround us, and from whence we shall look\ndown and see day and night beneath us. If we cannot lift up our eyes\ntoward the lamp of heaven without dazzling, what shall we do when we\ncome to behold the divine light in its illustrious original? That death\nwhich we so much dread and decline, is not the determination, but the\nintermission of a life, which will return again. All those things,\nthat are the very cause of life, are the way to death: we fear it as\nwe do fame; but it is a great folly to fear words. Some people are so\nimpatient of life, that they are still wishing for death; but he that\nwishes to die does not desire it: let us rather wait God\u2019s pleasure,\nand pray for health and life. If we have a mind to live, why do we\nwish to die? If we have a mind to die, we may do it without talking\nof it. Men are a great deal more resolute in the article of _death_\nitself than they are about the circumstances of it: for it gives a man\ncourage to consider that his fate is inevitable: the slow approaches of\ndeath are the most troublesome to us; as we see many a gladiator, who\nupon his wounds, will direct his adversary\u2019s weapon to his very heart,\nthough but timorous perhaps in the combat. There are some that have not\nthe heart either to live or die; that is a sad case. But this we are\nsure of, \u201cthe fear of death is a continual slavery, as the contempt of\nit is certain liberty.\u201d\nCHAPTER XXII.\nCONSOLATIONS AGAINST DEATH, FROM THE PROVIDENCE AND THE NECESSITY OF IT.\nThis life is only a prelude to eternity, where we are to expect another\noriginal, and another state of things; we have no prospect of heaven\nhere but at a distance; let us therefore expect our last and decretory\nhour with courage. The last (I say) to our bodies, but not to our\nminds: our luggage we leave behind us, and return as naked out of the\nworld as we came into it. The day which we fear as our last is but\nthe birth-day of our eternity; and it is the only way to it. So that\nwhat we fear as a rock, proves to be but a port, in many cases to be\ndesired, never to be refused; and he that dies young has only made a\nquick voyage of it. Some are becalmed, others cut it away before wind;\nand we live just as we sail: first, we rub our childhood out of sight;\nour youth next; and then our middle age: after that follows old age,\nand brings us to the common end of mankind.\nIt is a great providence that we have more ways out of the world than\nwe have into it. Our security stands upon a point, the very article\nof death. It draws a great many blessings into a very narrow compass:\nand although the fruit of it does not seem to extend to the defunct,\nyet the difficulty of it is more than balanced by the contemplation of\nthe future. Nay, suppose that all the business of this world should be\nforgotten, or my memory, traduced, what is all this to me? \u201cI have done\nmy duty.\u201d Undoubtedly that which puts an end to all other evils, cannot\nbe a very great evil itself, and yet it is no easy thing for flesh and\nblood to despise life. What if death comes? If it does not stay with us\nwhy should we fear it? One hangs himself for a mistress; another leaps\nthe garret-window to avoid a choleric master; a third runs away and\nstabs himself, rather than he will be brought back again. We see the\nforce even of our infirmities, and shall we not then do greater things\nfor the love of virtue? To suffer death is but the law of nature;\nand it is a great comfort that it can be done but once; in the very\nconvulsions of it we have this consolation, that our pain is near an\nend, and that it frees us from all the miseries of life.\nWhat it is we know not, and it were rash to condemn what we do not\nunderstand; but this we presume, either that we shall pass out of this\ninto a better life, where we shall live with tranquillity and splendor,\nin diviner mansions, or else return to our first principles, free from\nthe sense of any inconvenience. There is nothing immortal, nor many\nthings lasting; by but divers ways everything comes to an end. What\nan arrogance is it then, when the world itself stands condemned to a\ndissolution, that man alone should expect to live forever! It is unjust\nnot to allow unto the giver the power of disposing of his own bounty,\nand a folly only to value the present. Death is as much a debt as\nmoney, and life is but a journey towards it: some dispatch it sooner,\nothers later, but we must all have the same period. The thunderbolt is\nundoubtedly just that draws even from those that are struck with it a\nveneration.\nA great soul takes no delight in staying with the body: it considers\nwhence it came, and knows whither it is to go. The day will come that\nshall separate this mixture of soul and body, of divine and human; my\nbody I will leave where I found it, my soul I will restore to heaven,\nwhich would have been there already, but for the clog that keeps it\ndown: and beside, how many men have been the worse for longer living,\nthat might have died with reputation if they had been sooner taken\naway! How many disappointments of hopeful youths, that have proved\ndissolute men! Over and above the ruins, shipwrecks, torments, prisons,\nthat attend long life; a blessing so deceitful, that if a child were\nin condition to judge of it, and at liberty to refuse it, he would not\ntake it.\nWhat Providence has made necessary, human prudence should comply with\ncheerfully: as there is a necessity of death, so that necessity is\nequal and invincible. No man has cause of complaint for that which\nevery man must suffer as well as himself. When we _should_ die, we\n_will not_, and when we _would not_ we _must_: but our fate is fixed,\nand unavoidable is the decree. Why do we then stand trembling when\nthe time comes? Why do we not as well lament that we did not live a\nthousand years ago, as that we shall not be alive a thousand years\nhence? It is but traveling the great road, and to the place whither we\nmust all go at last. It is but submitting to the law of Nature, and to\nthat lot which the whole world has suffered that is gone before us; and\nso must they too that are to come after us. Nay, how many thousands,\nwhen our time comes, will expire in the same moment with us! He that\nwill not follow shall be drawn by force: and is it not much better now\nto do that willingly which we shall otherwise be made to do in spite of\nour hearts?\nThe sons of mortal parents must expect a mortal posterity\u2014death is\nthe end of great and small. We are born helpless, and exposed to the\ninjuries of all creatures and of all weathers. The very necessaries\nof life are deadly to us; we meet with our fate in our dishes, in\nour cups, and in the very air we breathe; nay, our very birth is\ninauspicious, for we come into the world weeping, and in the middle of\nour designs, while we are meditating great matters, and stretching of\nour thoughts to after ages, death cuts us off, and our longest date is\nonly the revolution of a few years. One man dies at the table; another\ngoes away in his sleep, a third in his mistress\u2019s arms, a fourth is\nstabbed, another is stung with an adder, or crushed with the fall of\na house. We have several ways to our end, but the end itself, which\nis death, is still the same. Whether we die by a sword, by a halter,\nby a potion, or by a disease, it is all but _death_. A child dies in\nthe swaddling-clouts, and an old man at a hundred\u2014they are both mortal\nalike, though the one goes sooner than the other. All that lies betwixt\nthe cradle and the grave is uncertain. If we compute the _troubles_,\nthe life even of a child is long: if the _sweetness_ of the _passage_,\nthat of an old man is short; the whole is slippery and deceitful, and\nonly death certain; and yet all people complain of that which never\ndeceived any man. Senecio raised himself from a small beginning to a\nvast fortune, being very well skilled in the faculties both of getting\nand of keeping, and either of them was sufficient for the doing of his\nbusiness. He was a man infinitely careful both of his patrimony and of\nhis body. He gave me a morning\u2019s visit, (says our author,) and after\nthat visit he went away and spent the rest of the day with a friend of\nhis that was desperately sick. At night, he was merry at supper, and\nseized immediately after with a quinsy which dispatched him in a few\nhours. This man that had money at use in all places, and in the very\ncourse and height of his prosperity was thus cut off. How foolish a\nthing is it then for a man to flatter himself with long hopes, and to\npretend to dispose of the future: nay, the very present slips through\nour fingers, and there is not that moment which we can call our own.\nHow vain a thing is it for us to enter upon projects, and to say to\nourselves, \u201cWell, I will go build, purchase, discharge such offices,\nsettle my affairs, and then retire!\u201d We are all of us born to the same\ncasualties\u2014all equally frail and uncertain of to-morrow. At the very\naltar where we pray for life, we learn to die, by seeing the sacrifices\nkilled before us. But there is no need of a wound, or searching the\nheart for it, when the noose of a cord, or the smothering of a pillow\nwill do the work. All things have their seasons\u2014they begin, they\nincrease, and they die. The heavens and the earth grow old, and are\nappointed their periods.\nThat which we call _death_ is but a pause or suspension; and, in\ntruth, a progress to life, only our thoughts look downward upon the\nbody, and not forward upon things to come. All things under the sun\nare mortal\u2014cities\u2014empires\u2014and the time will come when it shall be a\nquestion where they were, and, perchance, whether ever they had a\nbeing or not. Some will be destroyed by war, others by luxury, fire,\ninundations, earthquakes\u2014why should it trouble me then to die, as a\nforerunner of an universal dissolution? A great mind submits itself to\nGod, and suffers willingly what the law of the universe will otherwise\nbring to pass upon necessity.\nThat good old man Bassus, (though with one foot in the grave,) how\ncheerful a mind does he bear. He lives in the view of death, and\ncontemplates his own end with less concern of thought or countenance,\nthan he would do another man\u2019s. It is a hard lesson, and we are a long\ntime a learning of it, to receive our death without trouble, especially\nin the case of Bassus: in other deaths there is a mixture of hope\u2014a\ndisease may be cured, a fire quenched, a falling house either propped\nor avoided, the sea may swallow a man and throw him up again, a pardon\nmay interpose twixt the ax and the body\u2014but in the case of old age\nthere is no place for either hope or intercession.\nLet us live in our bodies, therefore, as if we were only to lodge\nin them this night, and to leave them to-morrow. It is the frequent\nthought of death that must fortify us against the necessity of it. He\nthat has armed himself against poverty, may, perhaps, come to live\nin plenty. A man may strengthen himself against pain and yet live in\na state of health; against the loss of friends, and never lose any,\nbut he that fortifies himself against the fear of death shall most\ncertainly have occasion to employ that virtue. It is the care of a wise\nand a good man to look to his manners and actions; and rather how well\nhe lives than how long, for to die sooner or later is not the business,\nbut to die well or ill, for \u201cdeath brings us to immortality.\u201d\nCHAPTER XXIII.\nAGAINST IMMODERATE SORROW FOR THE DEATH OF FRIENDS.\nNext to the encounter of death in our own bodies, the most sensible\ncalamity to an honest man is the death of a friend; and we are not in\ntruth without some generous instances of those that have preferred\na friend\u2019s life before their own; and yet this affliction, which by\nnature is so grievous to us, is by virtue and Providence made familiar\nand easy.\nTo lament the death of a friend is both natural and just; a sigh\nor a tear I would allow to his memory: but no profuse or obstinate\nsorrow. Clamorous and public lamentations are not so much the effects\nof grief as of vain-glory. He that is sadder in company than alone,\nshows rather the ambition of his sorrow than the piety of it. Nay, and\nin the violence of his passion there fall out twenty things that set\nhim a-laughing. At the long-run, time cures all, but it were better\ndone by moderation and wisdom. Some people do as good as set a watch\nupon themselves, as if they were afraid that their grief would make\nan escape. The ostentation of grief is many times more than the grief\nitself. When any body is within hearing, what groans and outcries! when\nthey are alone and private, all is hush and quiet: so soon as any body\ncomes in, they are at it again; and down they throw themselves upon the\nbed; fall to wringing of their hands, and wishing of themselves dead;\nwhich they might have executed by themselves; but their sorrow goes off\nwith the company. We forsake nature, and run over to the practices of\nthe people, that never were the authors of anything that is good. If\ndestiny were to be wrought upon by tears, I would allow you to spend\nyour days and nights in sadness and mourning, tearing of your hair, and\nbeating of your breast; but if Fate be inexorable, and death will keep\nwhat it has taken, grief is to no purpose. And yet I would not advise\ninsensibility and hardness; it were inhumanity, and not virtue, not to\nbe moved at the separation of familiar friends and relations: now, in\nsuch cases, we cannot command ourselves, we cannot forbear weeping, and\nwe ought not to forbear: but let us not pass the bounds of affection,\nand run into imitation; within these limits it is some ease to the mind.\nA wise man gives way to tears in some cases, and cannot avoid them in\nothers. When one is struck with the surprise of ill-news, as the death\nof a friend, or the like; or upon the last embrace of an acquaintance\nunder the hand of an executioner, he lies under a natural necessity\nof weeping and trembling. In another case, we may indulge our sorrow,\nas upon the memory of a dead friend\u2019s conversation or kindness, one\nmay let fall tears of generosity and joy. We favor the one, and we are\novercome by the other; and this is well: but we are not upon any terms\nto force them: they may flow of their own accord, without derogating\nfrom the dignity of a wise man; who at the same time both preserves\nhis gravity, and obeys nature. Nay, there is a certain _decorum_ even\nin weeping; for excess of sorrow is as foolish as profuse laughter.\nWhy do we not as well cry, when our trees that we took pleasure in,\nshed their leaves, as at the loss of our satisfactions; when the next\nseason repairs them, either with the same again, or others in their\nplaces. We may _accuse_ Fate, but we cannot _alter_ it; for it is hard\nand inexorable, and not to be removed either with reproaches or tears.\nThey may carry _us_ to the _dead_, but never bring _them_ back again\nto us. If reason does not put an end to our sorrows, fortune never\nwill: one is pinched with poverty; another solicited with ambition, and\nfears the very wealth that he coveted. One is troubled for the loss\nof children; another for the want of them: so that we shall sooner\nwant tears than matter for them; let us therefore spare that for which\nwe have so much occasion. I do confess, that in the very parting of\nfriends there is something of uneasiness and trouble; but it is rather\nvoluntary than natural; and it is custom more than sense that affects\nus: we do rather impose a sorrow upon ourselves than submit to it; as\npeople cry when they have company, and when nobody looks on, all is\nwell again. To mourn without measure is folly, and not to mourn at\nall is insensibility. The best temper is betwixt piety and reason;\nto be sensible, but neither transported nor cast down. He that can\nput a stop to his tears and pleasures when he will is safe. It is an\nequal infelicity to be either too soft or too hard: we are overcome\nby the one, and put to struggle with the other. There is a certain\nintemperance in that sorrow that passes the rules of modesty; and yet\ngreat piety is, in many cases, a dispensation to good manners. The\nloss of a son or of a friend, cuts a man to the heart, and there is no\nopposing the first violence of his passion; but when a man comes once\nto deliver himself wholly up to lamentations, he is to understand,\nthat though some tears deserve compassion, others are yet ridiculous. A\ngrief that is fresh finds pity and comfort, but when it is inveterate\nit is laughed at, for it is either counterfeit or foolish. Beside that,\nto weep excessively for the dead is an affront to the living. The most\njustifiable cause of mourning is to see good men come to ill ends, and\nvirtue oppressed by the iniquity of Fortune. But in this case, too,\nthey either suffer resolutely, and yield us delight in their courage\nand example, or meanly, and so give us the less trouble for the loss.\nHe that dies cheerfully, dries up my tears; and he that dies whiningly,\ndoes not deserve them. I would bear the death of friends and children\nwith the same constancy that I would expect my own, and no more lament\nthe one than fear the other. He that bethinks himself, how often\nfriends have been parted, will find more time lost among the living,\nthan upon the dead; and the most desperate mourners are they that cared\nleast for their friends when they were living; for they think to redeem\ntheir credits, for want of kindness to the living, by extravagant\nravings after the dead. Some (I know) will have grief to be only the\nperverse delight of a restless mind, and sorrows and pleasures to be\nnear akin; and there are, I am confident, that find joy even in their\ntears. But which is more barbarous, to be insensible of grief for the\ndeath of a friend, or to fish for pleasure in grief, when a son perhaps\nis burning, or a friend expiring? To forget one\u2019s friend, to bury the\nmemory with the body, to lament out of measure, is all inhuman. He that\nis gone either would not have his friend tormented, or does not know\nthat he is so: if he does not feel it, it is superfluous; if he does,\nit is unacceptable to him. If reason cannot prevail, reputation may;\nfor immoderate mourning lessens a man\u2019s character: it is a shameful\nthing for a wise man to make the _weariness_ of grieving the _remedy_\nof it. In time, the most stubborn grief will leave us, if in prudence\nwe do not leave that first.\nBut do I grieve for my friend\u2019s sake or for my own? Why should I\nafflict myself for the loss of him that is either happy or not at all\nin being? In the one case it is envy, and in the other it is madness.\nWe are apt to say, \u201cWhat would I give to see him again, and to enjoy\nhis conversation! I was never sad in his company: my heart leaped\nwhenever I met him; I want him wherever I go.\u201d All that is to be said\nis, \u201cThe greater the loss, the greater is the virtue to overcome it.\u201d\nIf grieving will do no good, it is an idle thing to grieve; and if that\nwhich has befallen one man remains to all, it is as unjust to complain.\nThe whole world is upon the march towards the same point; why do we\nnot cry for ourselves that are to follow, as well as for him that has\ngone first? Why do we not as well lament beforehand for that which we\nknow will be, and can not possibly but be? He is not _gone_, but _sent\nbefore_. As there are many things that he has lost, so there are many\nthings that he does not fear; as anger, jealousy, envy, etc. Is he not\nmore happy in desiring nothing than miserable in what he has lost? We\ndo not mourn for the absent, why then for the dead, who are effectually\nno other? We have lost one blessing, but we have many left; and shall\nnot all these satisfactions support us against one sorrow?\nThe comfort of having a friend may be taken away, but not that\nof having had one. As there is a sharpness in some fruits, and a\nbitterness in some wines that please us, so there is a mixture in the\nremembrance of friends, where the loss of their company is sweetened\nagain by the contemplation of their virtues. In some respects, I have\nlost what I had, and in others, I retain still what I have lost. It\nis an ill construction of Providence to reflect only upon my friend\u2019s\nbeing taken away, without any regard to the benefit of his being\nonce given me. Let us therefore make the best of our friends while\nwe have them; for how long we shall keep them is uncertain. I have\nlost a hopeful son, but how many fathers have been deceived in their\nexpectations! and how many noble families have been destroyed by luxury\nand riot! He that grieves for the loss of a son, what if he had lost a\nfriend? and yet he that has lost a friend has more cause of joy that\nhe once had him, than of grief that he is taken away. Shall a man bury\nhis friendship with his friend? We are ungrateful for that which is\npast, in hope of what is to come; as if that which is to come would not\nquickly be past too. That which is past we are sure of. We may receive\nsatisfaction, it is true, both from the future and what is already\npast; the one by expectation, and the other by memory; only the one may\npossibly not come to pass, and it is impossible to make the other not\nto have been.\nBut there is no applying of consolation to fresh and bleeding sorrow;\nthe very discourse irritates the grief and inflames it. It is like an\nunseasonable medicine in a disease; when the first violence is over,\nit will be more tractable, and endure the handling. Those people\nwhose minds are weakened by long felicity may be allowed to groan and\ncomplain, but it is otherwise with those that have led their days\nin misfortunes. A long course of adversity has this good in it, that\nthough it vexes a body a great while, it comes to harden us at last;\nas a raw soldier shrinks at every wound, and dreads the surgeon more\nthan an enemy; whereas a _veteran_ sees his own body cut and lamed with\nas little concern as if it were another\u2019s. With the same resolution\nshould we stand the shock and cure of all misfortunes; we are never the\nbetter for our experience, if we have not yet learned to be miserable.\nAnd there is no thought of curing us by the diversion of sports and\nentertainments; we are apt to fall into relapses; wherefore we had\nbetter overcome our sorrow than delude it.\nCHAPTER XXIV.\nCONSOLATION AGAINST BANISHMENT AND BODILY PAIN.\nIt is a masterpiece to draw good out of evil; and, by the help of\nvirtue, to improve misfortunes into blessings. \u201cIt is a sad condition,\u201d\nyou will say, \u201cfor a man to be barred the freedom of his own country.\u201d\nAnd is not this the case of thousands that we meet every day in the\nstreets? Some for ambition; others, to negotiate, or for curiosity,\ndelight, friendship, study, experience, luxury, vanity, discontent:\nsome to exercise their virtues, others their vices; and not a few to\nprostitute either their bodies or their eloquence? To pass now from\npleasant countries into the worst of islands; let them be never so\nbarren or rocky, the people never so barbarous, or the clime never so\nintemperate, he that is banished thither shall find many strangers to\nlive there for their pleasure. The mind of man is naturally curious\nand restless; which is no wonder, considering their divine original;\nfor heavenly things are always in motion: witness the stars, and the\norbs, which are perpetually moving, rolling, and changing of place and\naccording to the law and appointment of Nature. But here are no woods,\nyou will say, no rivers, no gold nor pearl, no commodity for traffic\nor commerce; nay, hardly provision enough to keep the inhabitants\nfrom starving. It is very right; here are no palaces, no artificial\ngrottoes, or materials for luxury and excess; but we lie under the\nprotection of Heaven; and a poor cottage for a retreat is more worth\nthan the most magnificent temple, when that cottage is consecrated\nby an honest man under the guard of his virtue. Shall any man think\nbanishment grievous, when he may take such company along with him!\nNor is there any banishment but yields enough for our necessities,\nand no kingdom is sufficient for superfluities. It is the mind that\nmakes us rich in a desert; and if the body be but kept alive, the\nsoul enjoys all spiritual felicities in abundance. What signifies the\nbeing banished from one spot of ground to another, to a man that has\nhis thoughts above, and can look forward and backward, and wherever\nhe pleases; and that, wherever he is, has the same matter to work\nupon? The body is but the prison or the clog of the mind, subjected to\npunishments, robberies, diseases; but the mind is sacred and spiritual,\nand liable to no violence. Is it that, a man shall want garments or\ncovering in banishment? The body is as easily clothed as fed; and\nNature has made nothing hard that is necessary. But if nothing will\nserve us but rich embroideries and scarlet, it is none of Fortune\u2019s\nfault that we are poor, but our own. Nay, suppose a man should have\nall restored him back again that he has lost, it will come to nothing,\nfor he will want more after that to satisfy his desires than he did\nbefore to supply his necessities. Insatiable appetites are not so much\na thirst as a disease.\nTo come lower now; where is the people or nation that have not changed\ntheir place of abode? Some by the fate of war; others have been cast\nby tempests, shipwrecks, or want of provisions, upon unknown coasts.\nSome have been forced abroad by pestilence, sedition, earthquakes,\nsurcharge of people at home. Some travel to see the world, others\nfor commerce; but, in fine, it is clear, that, upon some reason or\nother, the whole race of mankind have shifted their quarters; changed\ntheir very names as well as their habitations; insomuch that we have\nlost the very memorials of what they were. All these transportations\nof people, what are they but public banishments? The very _founder_\nof the _Roman empire_ was an _exile_: briefly, the whole world has\nbeen transplanted, and one mutation treads upon the heel of another.\nThat which one man desires, turns another man\u2019s stomach; and he that\nproscribes me to-day, shall himself be cast out to-morrow. We have,\nhowever, this comfort in our misfortune; we have the same nature, the\nsame Providence, and we carry our virtues along with us. And this\nblessing we owe to that almighty Power, call it what you will; either\na _God_, or an _Incorporeal Reason_, a _Divine Spirit_, or _Fate_, and\nthe _unchangeable Course_ of _causes_ and _effects_: it is, however,\nso ordered, that nothing can be taken from us but what we can well\nspare: and that which is most magnificent and valuable continues with\nus. Wherever we go, we have the heavens over our heads, and no farther\nfrom us than they were before; and so long as we can entertain our eyes\nand thoughts with those glories, what matter is it what ground we tread\nupon?\nIn the case of pain or sickness, it is only the body that is affected;\nit may take off the speed of a footman, or bind the hands of a cobbler,\nbut the mind is still at liberty to hear, learn, teach, advise, and to\ndo other good offices. It is an example of public benefit, a man that\nis in pain and patient. Virtue may show itself as well in the bed as\nin the field; and he that cheerfully encounters the terrors of death\nand corporal anguish, is as great a man as he that most generously\nhazards himself in a battle. A disease, it is true, bars us of some\npleasures, but procures us others. Drink is never so grateful to us as\nin a burning fever; nor meat, as when we have fasted ourselves sharp\nand hungry. The patient may be forbidden some sensual satisfaction,\nbut no physician will forbid us the delight of the mind. Shall we call\nany sick man miserable, because he must give over his intemperance\nof wine and gluttony, and betake himself to a diet of more sobriety,\nand less expense; and abandon his luxury, which is the distemper of\nthe mind as well as of the body? It is troublesome, I know, at first,\nto abstain from the pleasures we have been used to, and to endure\nhunger and thirst; but in a little time we lose the very appetite,\nand it is no trouble then to be without that which we do not desire.\nIn diseases there are great pains; but if they be long they remit,\nand give us some intervals of ease; if short and violent, either they\ndispatch _us_, or consume _themselves_; so that either their respites\nmake them tolerable, or the extremity makes them short. So merciful\nis Almighty God to us, that our torments cannot be very sharp and\nlasting. The acutest pains are those that affect the nerves, but there\nis this comfort in them too, that they will quickly make us stupid and\ninsensible. In cases of extremity, let us call to mind the most eminent\ninstances of patience and courage, and turn our thoughts from our\nafflictions to the contemplation of virtue. Suppose it be the stone,\nthe gout, nay, the rack itself; how many have endured it without so\nmuch as a groan or word speaking; without so much as asking for relief,\nor giving an answer to a question! Nay, they have laughed at the\ntormentors upon the very torture, and provoked them to new experiments\nof their cruelty, which they have had still in derision. The _asthma_ I\nlook upon as of all diseases the most importunate; the physicians call\nit the _meditation of death_, as being rather an agony than a sickness;\nthe fit holds one not above an hour, as nobody is long in expiring. Are\nthere not three things grievous in sickness, the fear of death, bodily\npain, and the intermission of our pleasures? the first is to be imputed\nto nature, not to the disease; for we do not die because we are sick,\nbut because we live. Nay, sickness itself has preserved many a man from\ndying.\nCHAPTER XXV.\nPOVERTY TO A WISE MAN IS RATHER A BLESSING THAN A MISFORTUNE.\nNo man shall ever be poor that goes to himself for what he wants;\nand that is the readiest way to riches. Nature, indeed, will have\nher due; but yet whatsoever is beyond necessity is precarious, and\nnot necessary. It is not her business to gratify the palate, but to\nsatisfy a craving stomach. Bread, when a man is hungry, does his work,\nlet it be never so coarse; and water when he is dry; let his thirst\nbe quenched, and Nature is satisfied, no matter whence it comes, or\nwhether he drinks in gold, silver, or in the hollow of his hand. To\npromise a man riches, and to teach him poverty, is to deceive him: but\nshall I call him poor that wants nothing; though he maybe beholden for\nit to his patience, rather than to his fortune? Or shall any man deny\nhim to be rich, whose riches can never be taken away? Whether is it\nbetter to have much or enough? He that has much desires more, and shows\nthat he has not yet enough; but he that has enough is at rest. Shall\na man be reputed the less rich for not having that for which he shall\nbe banished; for which his very wife, or son, shall poison him: that\nwhich gives him security in war, and quiet in peace; which he possesses\nwithout danger, and disposes of without trouble? No man can be poor\nthat has enough; nor rich, that covets more than he has. Alexander,\nafter all his conquests, complained that he wanted more worlds; he\ndesired something more, even when he had gotten all: and that which was\nsufficient for human nature was not enough for one man. Money never\nmade any man rich; for the more he had, the more he still coveted. The\nrichest man that ever lived is poor in my opinion, and in any man\u2019s may\nbe so: but he that keeps himself to the stint of Nature, does neither\nfeel poverty nor fear it; nay, even in poverty itself there are some\nthings superfluous. Those which the world calls happy, their felicity\nis a false splendor, that dazzles the eyes of the vulgar; but our rich\nman is glorious and happy within. There is no ambition in hunger or\nthirst: let there be food, and no matter for the table, the dish, and\nthe servants, nor with what meats nature is satisfied. Those are the\ntorments of luxury, that rather stuff the stomach than fill it: it\nstudies rather to cause an appetite than to allay it. It is not for us\nto say, \u201cThis is not handsome; that is common; the other offends my\neye.\u201d Nature provides for health, not delicacy. When the trumpet sounds\na charge, the poor man knows that he is not aimed at; when they cry\nout _fire_, his body is all he has to look after: if he be to take a\njourney, there is no blocking up of streets, and thronging of passages,\nfor a parting compliment: a small matter fills his belly, and contents\nhis mind: he lives from hand to mouth, without caring or fearing for\nto-morrow. The temperate rich man is but his counterfeit; his wit is\nquicker and his appetite calmer.\nNo man finds poverty a trouble to him, but he that thinks it so; and\nhe that thinks it so, makes it so. Does not a rich man travel more\nat ease with less luggage, and fewer servants? Does he not eat many\ntimes as little and as coarse in the field as a poor man? Does he\nnot for his own pleasure, sometimes, and for variety, feed upon the\nground, and use only earthen vessels? Is not he a madman then, that\nalways fears what he often desires, and dreads the thing that he takes\ndelight to imitate: he that would know the worst of poverty, let him\nbut compare the looks of the rich and of the poor, and he shall find\nthe poor man to have a smoother brow, and to be more merry at heart; or\nif any trouble befalls him, it passes over like a cloud: whereas the\nother, either his good humor is counterfeit, or his melancholy deep\nand ulcerated, and the worse, because he dares not publicly own his\nmisfortune; but he is forced to play the part of a happy man even with\na cancer in his heart. His felicity is but personated; and if he were\nbut stripped of his ornaments, he would be contemptible. In buying of\na horse, we take off his clothes and his trappings, and examine his\nshape and body for fear of being cozened; and shall we put an estimate\nupon a man for being set off by his fortune and quality? Nay, if we see\nanything of ornament about him, we are to suspect him the more for some\ninfirmity under it. He that is not content in poverty, would not be so\nneither in plenty; for the fault is not in the thing, but in the mind.\nIf that be sickly, remove him from a kennel to a palace, he is at the\nsame pass; for he carries his disease along with him.\nWhat can be happier than the condition both of mind and of fortune from\nwhich we cannot fall\u2014what can be a greater felicity than in a covetous,\ndesigning age, for a roan to live safe among informers and thieves? It\nputs a poor man into the very condition of Providence, that gives all,\nwithout reserving anything to itself. How happy is he that owes nothing\nbut to himself, and only that which he can easily refuse or easily\npay! I do not reckon him poor that has but a little, but he is so that\ncovets more\u2014it is a fair degree of plenty to have what is necessary.\nWhether had a man better find satiety in want, or hunger in plenty? It\nis not the augmenting of our fortunes, but the abating of our appetites\nthat makes us rich.\nWhy may not a man as well contemn riches in his own coffers as in\nanother man\u2019s, and rather hear that they are his than feel them to be\nso, though it is a great matter not to be corrupted even by having\nthem under the same roof. He is the greater man that is honestly poor\nin the middle of plenty\u2014but he is the more secure that is free from\nthe temptation of that plenty, and has the least matter for another\nto design upon. It is no great business for a poor man to preach the\ncontempt of riches, or for a rich man to extol the benefits of poverty,\nbecause we do not know how either the one or the other would behave\nhimself in the contrary condition. The best proof is the doing of it\nby choice and not by necessity; for the practice of poverty in jest\nis a preparation toward the bearing of it in earnest; but it is yet a\ngenerous disposition so to provide for the worst of fortunes as what\nmay be easily borne\u2014the premeditation makes them not only tolerable but\ndelightful to us, for there is that in them without which nothing can\nbe comfortable, that is to say, security. If there were nothing else in\npoverty but the certain knowledge of our friends, it were yet a most\ndesirable blessing, when every man leaves us but those that love us.\nIt is a shame to place the happiness of life in gold and silver, for\nwhich bread and water is sufficient; or, at the worst, hunger puts an\nend to hunger.\nFor the honor of _poverty_, it was both the _foundation_ and the _cause\nof the Roman empire_; and no man was ever yet so poor but he had enough\nto carry him to his journey\u2019s end.\nAll I desire is that my property may not be a burden to myself, or make\nme so to others; and that is the best state of fortune that is neither\ndirectly necessitous, nor far from it. A mediocricity of fortune with\na gentleness of mind, will preserve us from fear or envy, which is a\ndesirable condition, for no man wants power to do mischief. We never\nconsider the blessing of coveting nothing, and the glory of being full\nin ourselves, without depending upon Fortune. With parsimony a little\nis sufficient and without it nothing; whereas frugality makes a poor\nman rich. If we lose an estate, we had better never have had it\u2014he that\nhas least to lose has least to fear, and those are better satisfied\nwhom Fortune never favored, than those whom she has forsaken.\nThe state is most commodious that lies betwixt poverty and plenty.\nDiogenes understood this very well when he put himself into an\nincapacity of losing any thing. That course of life is most commodious\nwhich is both safe and wholesome\u2014the body is to be indulged no farther\nthan for health, and rather mortified than not kept in subjection to\nthe mind. It is necessary to provide against hunger, thirst, and cold;\nand somewhat for a covering to shelter us against other inconveniences;\nbut not a pin matter whether it be of turf or of marble\u2014a man may lie\nas warm and as dry under a thatched as under a gilded roof. Let the\nmind be great and glorious, and all other things are despicable in\ncomparison. \u201cThe future is uncertain, and I had rather beg of myself\nnot to desire any thing, than of Fortune to bestow it.\u201d\nSENECA OF ANGER.\nCHAPTER I.\nANGER DESCRIBED, IT IS AGAINST NATURE, AND ONLY TO BE FOUND IN MAN.\nWe are here to encounter the most outrageous, brutal, dangerous, and\nintractable of all passions; the most loathsome and unmannerly; nay,\nthe most ridiculous too; and the subduing of this monster will do a\ngreat deal toward the establishment of human peace. It is the method of\n_physicians_ to begin with a description of the disease, before they\nmeddle with the cure: and I know not why this may not do as well in the\ndistempers of the mind as in those of the body.\nThe _Stoics_ will have _anger_ to be a \u201cdesire of punishing another\nfor some injury done.\u201d Against which it is objected, that we are many\ntimes angry with those that never did hurt us, but possibly may, though\nthe harm be not as yet done. But I say, that they hurt us already in\nconceit: and the very purpose of it is an injury in thought before it\nbreaks out into act. It is opposed again, that if anger were a _desire\nof punishing_, mean people would not be angry with great ones that are\nout of their reach; for no man can be said to desire any thing which he\njudges impossible to compass. But I answer to this, That _anger_ is the\n_desire_, not the _power_ and _faculty_ of _revenge_; neither is any\nman so low, but that the greatest man alive may peradventure lie at his\nmercy.\nAristotle takes _anger_ to be, \u201ca desire of paying sorrow for sorrow;\u201d\nand of plaguing those that have plagued us. It is argued against both,\nthat beasts are angry; though neither provoked by any injury, nor moved\nwith a desire of any body\u2019s grief or punishment. Nay, though they cause\nit, they do not design or seek it. Neither is _anger_ (how unreasonable\nsoever in itself) found anywhere but in reasonable creatures. It is\ntrue, the beasts have an impulse of rage and fierceness; as they are\nmore affected also than men with some pleasures; but we may as well\ncall them luxurious and ambitious as angry. And yet they are not\nwithout certain images of human affections. They have their likings\nand their loathings; but neither the passions of reasonable nature,\nnor their virtues, nor their vices. They are moved to fury by some\nobjects; they are quieted by others; they have their terrors and their\ndisappointments, but without reflection: and let them be never so much\nirritated or affrighted, so soon as ever the occasion is removed they\nfall to their meat again, and lie down and take their rest. Wisdom and\nthought are the goods of the mind, whereof brutes are wholly incapable;\nand we are as unlike them within as we are without: they have an\nodd kind of fancy, and they have a voice too; but inarticulate and\nconfused, and incapable of those variations which are familiar to us.\nAnger is not only a vice, but a vice point-blank against nature, for it\ndivides instead of joining; and in some measure, frustrates the end of\nProvidence in human society. One man was born to help another; anger\nmakes us destroy one another; the one unites, the other separates; the\none is beneficial to us, the other mischievous; the one succors even\nstrangers, the other destroys even the most intimate friends; the one\nventures all to save another, the other ruins himself to undo another.\nNature is bountiful, but anger is pernicious: for it is not fear, but\nmutual love that binds up mankind.\nThere are some motions that look like anger, which cannot properly be\ncalled so; as the passion of the people against the _gladiators_, when\nthey hang off, and will not make so quick a dispatch as the spectators\nwould have them: there is something in it of the humor of children,\nthat if they get a fall, will never leave bawling until the naughty\nground is beaten, and then all is well again. They are angry without\nany cause or injury; they are deluded by an imitation of strokes, and\npacified with counterfeit tears. A false and a childish sorrow is\nappeased with as false and as childish a revenge. They take it for a\ncontempt, if the _gladiators_ do not immediately cast themselves upon\nthe sword\u2019s point. They look presently about them from one to another,\nas who should say; \u201cDo but see, my masters, how these rogues abuse us.\u201d\nTo descend to the particular branches and varieties would be\nunnecessary and endless. There is a stubborn, a vindictive, a\nquarrelsome, a violent, a froward, a sullen, a morose kind of anger;\nand then we have this variety in complication too. One goes no\nfurther than words; another proceeds immediately to blows, without a\nword speaking; a third sort breaks out into cursing and reproachful\nlanguage; and there are that content themselves with chiding and\ncomplaining. There is a conciliable anger and there is an implacable;\nbut in what form or degree soever it appears, all anger, without\nexception, is vicious.\nCHAPTER II.\nTHE RISE OF ANGER.\nThe question will be here, whether _anger_ takes its rise from impulse\nor judgment; that is, whether it be moved of its own accord, or, as\nmany other things are, from within us, that arise we know not how? The\nclearing of this point will lead us to greater matters.\nThe _first_ motion of _anger_ is in truth involuntary, and only a kind\nof menacing preparation towards it. The _second_ deliberates; as who\nshould say, \u201cThis injury should not pass without a revenge,\u201d and there\nit stops. The _third_ is impotent; and, right or wrong, resolves upon\nvengeance. The _first motion_ is not to be avoided, nor indeed the\n_second_, any more than yawning for company; custom and care may lessen\nit, but reason itself cannot overcome it. The _third_, as it rises upon\nconsideration, it must fall so too, for that motion which proceeds with\njudgment may be taken away with judgment. A man thinks himself injured,\nand hath a mind to be revenged, but for some reason lets it rest. This\nis not properly _anger_, but an _affection overruled by reason_; a kind\nof proposal disapproved\u2014and what are reason and affection, but only\nchanges of the mind for the better or for the worse? Reason deliberates\nbefore it judges; but anger passes sentence without deliberation.\nReason only attends the matter in hand; but anger is startled at every\naccident; it passes the bounds of reason, and carries it away with\nit. In short, \u201canger is an agitation of the mind that proceeds to the\nresolution of a revenge, the mind assenting to it.\u201d\nThere is no doubt but anger is moved by the species of an injury; but\nwhether that motion be voluntary or involuntary is the point in debate;\nthough it seems manifest to me that _anger_ does nothing but where the\nmind goes along with it, for, first, to take an offence, and then to\nmeditate a revenge, and after that to lay both propositions together,\nand say to myself, \u201cThis injury ought not to have been done; but as the\ncase stands, I must do myself right.\u201d This discourse can never proceed\nwithout the concurrence of the will.\nThe first motion indeed is single; but all the rest is deliberation\nand superstructure\u2014there is something understood and condemned\u2014an\nindignation conceived and a revenge propounded. This can never be\nwithout the agreement of the mind to the matter in deliberation. The\nend of this question is to know the nature and quality of _anger_. If\nit be bred in us it will never yield to reason, for all involuntary\nmotions are inevitable and invincible; as a kind of horror and\nshrugging upon the sprinkling of cold water; the hair standing on\nend at ill news; giddiness at the sight of a precipice; blushing at\nlewd discourse. In these cases reason can do no good, but _anger_\nmay undoubtedly be overcome by caution and good counsel, for it is a\n_voluntary vice_, and not of the condition of those accidents that\nbefall us as frailties of our humanity, amongst which must be reckoned\nthe first motions of the mind after the opinion of an injury received,\nwhich it is not in the power of human nature to avoid, and this is it\nthat affects us upon the stage, or in a story.\nCan any man read the death of Pompey, and not be touched with an\nindignation? The sound of a trumpet rouses the spirits and provokes\ncourage. It makes a man sad to see the shipwreck even of an enemy; and\nwe are much surprised by fear in other cases\u2014all these motions are not\nso much affections as preludes to them. The clashing of arms or the\nbeating of a drum excites a war-horse: nay, a song from Xenophantes\nwould make Alexander take his sword in his hand.\nIn all these cases the mind rather suffers than acts, and therefore it\nis not an affection _to be moved_, but _to give way_ to that motion,\nand to follow willingly what was started by chance\u2014these are not\naffections, but impulses of the body. The bravest man in the world may\nlook pale when he puts on his armor, his knees knock, and his heart\nwork before the battle is joined: but these are only _motions_; whereas\n_anger_ is an _excursion_, and proposes revenge or punishment, which\ncannot be without the mind. As fear flies, so anger assaults; and it is\nnot possible to resolve, either upon violence or caution, without the\nconcurrence of the will.\nCHAPTER III.\nANGER MAY BE SUPPRESSED.\nIt is an idle thing to pretend that we cannot govern our _anger_;\nfor some things that we do are much harder than others that we ought\nto do; the wildest affections may be tamed by discipline, and there\nis hardly anything which the mind will do but it may do. There needs\nno more argument in this case than the instances of several persons,\nboth powerful and impatient, that have gotten the absolute mastery of\nthemselves in this point.\nThrasippus in his drink fell foul upon the cruelties of Pisistratus;\nwho, when he was urged by several about him to make an example of him,\nreturned this answer, \u201cWhy should I be angry with a man that stumbles\nupon me blindfold?\u201d In effect most of our quarrels are of our own\nmaking, either by mistake or by aggravation. Anger comes sometimes upon\nus, but we go oftener to it, and instead of rejecting it we call it.\nAugustus was a great master of his passion: for Timagenus, an\nhistorian, wrote several bitter things against his person and his\nfamily: which passed among the people plausibly enough, as pieces of\nrash wit commonly do. C\u00e6sar advised him several times to forbear; and\nwhen that would not do, forbade him his roof. After this, Asinius\nPollio gave him entertainment; and he was so well beloved in the\ncity, that every man\u2019s house was open to him. Those things that he\nhad written in honor of Augustus, he recited and burnt, and publicly\nprofessed himself C\u00e6sar\u2019s enemy. Augustus, for all this, never fell\nout with any man that received him; only once, he told Pollio, that he\nhad taken a _snake_ into his bosom: and as Pollio was about to excuse\nhimself; \u201cNo,\u201d says C\u00e6sar, interrupting him, \u201cmake your best of him.\u201d\nAnd offering to cast him off at that very moment, if C\u00e6sar pleased: \u201cDo\nyou think,\u201d says C\u00e6sar, \u201cthat I will ever contribute to the parting of\nyou, that made you friends?\u201d for Pollio was angry with him before, and\nonly entertained him now because C\u00e6sar had discarded him.\nThe moderation of Antigonus was remarkable. Some of his soldiers were\nrailing at him one night, where there was but a hanging betwixt them.\nAntigonus overheard them, and putting it gently aside; \u201cSoldiers,\u201d says\nhe, \u201cstand a little further off, for fear the king should hear you.\u201d\nAnd we are to consider, not only violent examples, but moderate, where\nthere wanted neither cause of displeasure nor power of revenge: as in\nthe case of Antigonus, who the same night hearing his soldiers cursing\nhim for bringing them into so foul a way, he went to them, and without\ntelling them who he was, helped them out of it. \u201cNow,\u201d says he, \u201cyou\nmay be allowed to curse him that brought you into the mire, provided\nyou bless him that took you out of it.\u201d\nIt was a notable story that of Vedius Pallio, upon his inviting of\nAugustus to supper. One of his boys happened to break a glass: and his\nmaster, in a rage, commanded him to be thrown in a pond to feed his\nlampreys. This action of his might be taken for _luxury_, though, in\ntruth, it was cruelty. The boy was seized, but brake loose and threw\nhimself at Augustus\u2019 feet, only desiring that he might not die that\ndeath. C\u00e6sar, in abhorrence of the barbarity, presently ordered all\nthe rest of the glasses to be broken, the boy to be released, and the\npond to be filled up, that there might be no further occasion for an\ninhumanity of that nature. This was an authority well employed. Shall\nthe breaking of a glass cost a man his life? Nothing but a predominant\nfear could ever have mastered his choleric and sanguinary disposition.\nThis man deserved to die a thousand deaths, either for eating human\nflesh at second-hand in his _lampreys_, or for keeping of his fish to\nbe so fed.\nIt is written of Pr\u00e6xaspes (a favorite of Cambyses, who was much given\nto wine) that he took the freedom to tell this prince of his hard\ndrinking, and to lay before him the scandal and the inconveniences of\nhis excesses; and how that, in those distempers, he had not the command\nof himself. \u201cNow,\u201d says Cambyses, \u201cto show you your mistake, you shall\nsee me drink deeper than ever I did, and yet keep the use of my eyes,\nand of my hands, as well as if I were sober.\u201d Upon this he drank to\na higher pitch than ordinary, and ordered Pr\u00e6xaspes\u2019 son to go out,\nand stand on the other side of the threshold, with his left arm over\nhis head; \u201cAnd,\u201d says he, \u201cif I have a good aim, have at the heart of\nhim.\u201d He shot, and upon cutting up the young man, they found indeed\nthat the arrow had struck him through the middle of the heart. \u201cWhat\ndo you think now,\u201d says Cambyses, \u201cis my hand steady or not?\u201d \u201cApollo\nhimself,\u201d says Pr\u00e6xaspes, \u201ccould not have outdone it.\u201d It may be a\nquestion now, which was the greater impiety, the murder itself, or\nthe commendation of it; for him to take the heart of his son, while\nit was yet reeking and panting under the wound, for an occasion of\nflattery: why was there not another experiment made upon the father,\nto try if Cambyses could not have yet mended his shot? This was a most\nunmanly violation of hospitality; but the approbation of the act was\nstill worse than the crime itself. This example of Pr\u00e6xaspes proves\nsufficiently that a man may repress his anger; for he returned not\none ill word, no not so much as a complaint; but he paid dear for his\ngood counsel. He had been wiser, perhaps, if he had let the king alone\nin his cups, for he had better have drunk wine than blood. It is a\ndangerous office to give good advice to intemperate princes.\nAnother instance of anger suppressed, we have in Harpagus, who was\ncommanded to expose Cyrus upon a mountain. But the child was preserved;\nwhich, when Astyages came afterwards to understand, he invited Harpagus\nto a dish of meat; and when he had eaten his fill, he told him it was a\npiece of his son, and asked him how he liked the seasoning. \u201cWhatever\npleases your Majesty,\u201d says Harpagus, \u201cmust please me:\u201d and he made no\nmore words of it. It is most certain, that we might govern our anger if\nwe would; for the same thing that galls us at home gives us no offence\nat all abroad; and what is the reason of it, but that we are patient in\none place, and froward in another?\nIt was a strong provocation that which was given to Philip of Macedon,\nthe father of Alexander. The Athenians sent their ambassadors to him,\nand they were received with this compliment, \u201cTell me, gentlemen,\u201d\nsays Philip, \u201cwhat is there that I can do to oblige the Athenians?\u201d\nDemocharas, one of the ambassadors, told him, that they would take it\nfor a great obligation if he would be pleased to hang himself. This\ninsolence gave an indignation to the by-standers; but Philip bade them\nnot to meddle with him, but even to let that foul-mouthed fellow go as\nhe came. \u201cAnd for you, the rest of the ambassadors,\u201d says he, \u201cpray\ntell the Athenians, that it is worse to speak such things than to hear\nand forgive them.\u201d This wonderful patience under contumelies was a\ngreat means of Philip\u2019s security.\nCHAPTER IV.\nIT IS A SHORT MADNESS, AND A DEFORMED VICE.\nHe was much in the right, whoever it was, that first called _anger\na short madness_; for they have both of them the same symptoms; and\nthere is so wonderful a resemblance betwixt the transports of _choler_\nand those of _frenzy_, that it is a hard matter to know the one from\nthe other. A bold, fierce, and threatening countenance, as pale as\nashes, and, in the same moment, as red as blood; a glaring eye, a\nwrinkled brow, violent motions, the hands restless and perpetually\nin action, wringing and menacing, snapping of the joints, stamping\nwith the feet, the hair starting, trembling of the lips, a forced and\nsqueaking voice; the speech false and broken, deep and frequent sighs,\nand ghastly looks; the veins swell, the heart pants, the knees knock;\nwith a hundred dismal accidents that are common to both distempers.\nNeither is _anger_ a bare resemblance only of madness, but many times\nan irrevocable transition into the thing itself. How many persons\nhave we known, read, and heard of, that have lost their wits in a\npassion, and never came to themselves again? It is therefore to be\navoided, not only for moderation\u2019s sake, but also for health. Now, if\nthe outward appearance of anger be so foul and hideous, how deformed\nmust that miserable mind be that is harassed with it? for it leaves\nno place either for counsel or friendship, honesty or good manners;\nno place either for the exercise of reason, or for the offices of\nlife. If I were to describe it, I would draw a tiger bathed in blood,\nsharp set, and ready to take a leap at his prey; or dress it up as the\npoets represent the furies, with whips, snakes, and flames; it should\nbe sour, livid, full of scars, and wallowing in gore, raging up and\ndown, destroying, grinning, bellowing, and pursuing; sick of all other\nthings, and most of all, itself. It turns beauty into deformity, and\nthe calmest counsels into fierceness: it disorders our very garments,\nand fills the mind with horror. How abominable is it in the soul then,\nwhen it appears so hideous even through the bones, the skin and so\nmany impediments! Is not he a madman that has lost the government of\nhimself, and is tossed hither and thither by his fury as by a tempest?\nthe executioner and the murderer of his nearest friends? The smallest\nmatter moves it, and makes us unsociable and inaccessible. It does all\nthings by violence, as well upon itself as others; and it is, in short;\nthe master of all passions.\nThere is not any creature so terrible and dangerous by nature, but\nit becomes fiercer by anger. Not that beasts have human affections,\nbut certain impulses they have which come very near them. The boar\nfoams, champs, and whets his tusks; the bull tosses his horns in the\nair, bounds, and tears up the ground with his feet; the lion roars\nand swinges himself with his tail; the serpent swells; and there is\na ghastly kind of fellness in the aspect of a mad dog. How great a\nwickedness is it now to indulge a violence, that does not only turn\na man into a beast, but makes even the most outrageous of beasts\nthemselves to be more dreadful and mischievous! A vice that carries\nalong with it neither pleasure nor profit, neither honor nor security;\nbut on the contrary, destroys us to all the comfortable and glorious\npurposes of our reasonable being. Some there are, that will have the\nroot of it to be the greatness of mind. And, why may we not as well\nentitle _impudence_ to _courage_, whereas the one is proud, the other\nbrave; the one is gracious and gentle, the other rude and furious?\nAt the same rate we may ascribe magnanimity to avarice, luxury, and\nambition, which are all but splendid impotences, without measure and\nwithout foundation. There is nothing great but what is virtuous, nor\nindeed truly great, but what is also composed and quiet. Anger, alas!\nis but a wild impetuous blast, an empty tumor, the very infirmity of\nwoman and children; a brawling, clamorous evil: and the more noise the\nless courage; as we find it commonly, that the boldest tongues have the\nfaintest hearts.\nCHAPTER V.\nANGER IS NEITHER WARRANTABLE NOR USEFUL.\nIn the first place, Anger is _unwarrantable_ as it is _unjust_: for it\nfalls many times upon the wrong person, and discharges itself upon the\ninnocent instead of the guilty: beside the disproportion of making the\nmost trivial offences to be capital, and punishing an inconsiderate\nword perhaps with torments, fetters, infamy, or death. It allows a man\nneither time nor means for defence, but judges a cause without hearing\nit, and admits of no mediation. It flies into the face of truth itself,\nif it be of the adverse party; and turns obstinacy in an error, into\nan argument of justice. It does every thing with agitation and tumult;\nwhereas reason and equity can destroy whole families, if there be\noccasion for it, even to the extinguishing of their names and memories,\nwithout any indecency, either of countenance or action.\nSecondly, It is unsociable to the highest point; for it spares neither\nfriend nor foe; but tears all to pieces, and casts human nature into\na perpetual state of war. It dissolves the bond of mutual society,\ninsomuch that our very companions and relations dare not come near\nus; it renders us unfit for the ordinary offices of life: for we can\nneither govern our tongues, our hands, nor any part of our body. It\ntramples upon the laws of hospitality, and of nations, leaves every man\nto be his own carver, and all things, public and private, sacred and\nprofane, suffer violence.\nThirdly, It is to no purpose. \u201cIt is a sad thing,\u201d we cry, \u201cto put up\nwith these injuries, and we are not able to bear them;\u201d as if any man\nthat can bear _anger_ could not bear an _injury_, which is much more\nsupportable. You will say that anger does some good yet, for it keeps\npeople in awe, and secures a man from contempt; never considering, that\nit is more dangerous to be feared than despised. Suppose that an angry\nman could do as much as he threatens; the more terrible, he is still\nthe more odious; and on the other side, if he wants power, he is the\nmore despicable for his anger; for there is nothing more wretched than\na choleric huff, that makes a noise, and nobody cares for it.\nIf anger would be valuable because men are afraid of it, why not an\nadder, a toad, or a scorpion as well? It makes us lead the life of\ngladiators; we live, and we fight together. We hate the happy, despise\nthe miserable, envy our superiors, insult our inferiors, and there\nis nothing in the world which we will not do, either for pleasure\nor profit. To be angry at offenders is to make ourselves the common\nenemies of mankind, which is both weak and wicked; and we may as well\nbe angry that our thistles do not bring forth apples, or that every\npebble in our ground is not an oriental pearl. If we are angry both\nwith young men and with old, because they do offend, why not with\ninfants too, because they will offend? It is laudable to rejoice for\nanything that is well done; but to be transported for another man\u2019s\ndoing ill, is narrow and sordid. Nor is it for the dignity of virtue\nto be either angry or sad.\nIt is with a tainted mind as with an ulcer, not only the touch, but the\nvery offer at it, makes us shrink and complain; when we come once to\nbe carried off from our poise, we are lost. In the choice of a sword,\nwe take care that it be wieldy and well mounted; and it concerns us as\nmuch to be wary of engaging in the excesses of ungovernable passions.\nIt is not the speed of a horse altogether that pleases us unless we\nfind that he can stop and turn at pleasure. It is a sign of weakness,\nand a kind of stumbling, for a man to run when he intends only to\nwalk; and it behoves us to have the same command of our mind that we\nhave of our bodies. Besides that the greatest punishment of an injury\nis the conscience of having done it; and no man suffers more than he\nthat is turned over to the pain of a repentance. How much better is it\nto compose injuries than to revenge them? For it does not only spend\ntime, but the revenge of one injury exposes to more. In fine, as it\nis unreasonable to be angry at a crime, it is as foolish to be angry\nwithout one.\nBut \u201cmay not an honest man then be allowed to be angry at the murder\nof his father, or the ravishing of his sister or daughter before his\nface?\u201d No, not at all. I will defend my parents, and I will repay the\ninjuries that are done them; but it is my piety and not my anger, that\nmoves me to it. I will do my duty without fear or confusion, I will not\nrage, I will not weep; but discharge the office of a good man without\nforfeiting the dignity of a man. If my father be assaulted, I will\nendeavor to rescue him; if he be killed, I will do right to his memory;\nfind all this, not in any transport of passion, but in honor and\nconscience. Neither is there any need of anger where reason does the\nsame thing.\nA man may be temperate, and yet vigorous, and raise his mind according\nto the occasion, more or less, as a stone is thrown according to the\ndiscretion and intent of the caster. How outrageous have I seen some\npeople for the loss of a monkey or a spaniel! And were it not a shame\nto have the same sense for a friend that we have for a puppy; and to\ncry like children, as much for a bauble as for the ruin of our country?\nThis is not the effect of reason, but of infirmity. For a man indeed to\nexpose his person for his prince, or his parents, or his friends, out\nof a sense of honesty, and judgment of duty, it is, without dispute, a\nworthy and a glorious action; but it must be done then with sobriety,\ncalmness, and resolution.\nIt is high time to convince the world of the indignity and uselessness\nof this passion, when it has the authority and recommendation of no\nless than Aristotle himself, as an affection very much conducing to all\nheroic actions that require heat and vigor: now, to show, on the other\nside, that it is not in any case profitable, we shall lay open the\nobstinate and unbridled madness of it: a wickedness neither sensible\nof infamy nor of glory, without either modesty or fear; and if it\npasses once from anger into a hardened hatred, it is incurable. It is\neither stronger than reason, or it is weaker. If stronger, there is\nno contending with it; if weaker, reason will do the business without\nit. Some will have it that an angry man is good-natured and sincere;\nwhereas, in truth, he only lays himself open out of heedlessness and\nwant of caution. If it were in itself good the more of it the better;\nbut in this case, the more the worse; and a wise man does his duty,\nwithout the aid of anything that is ill. It is objected by some,\nthat those are the most generous creatures which are the most prone\nto anger. But, first, _reason_ in _man_ is _impetuous_ in _beasts_.\nSecondly, without discipline it runs into audaciousness and temerity;\nover and above that, the same thing does not help all. If anger helps\nthe lion, it is fear that saves the stag, swiftness the hawk, and\nflight the pigeon: but man has God for his example (who is never\nangry) and not the _creatures_. And yet it is not amiss sometimes to\ncounterfeit anger; as upon the stage; nay, upon the bench, and in the\npulpit, where the imitation of it is more effectual than the thing\nitself.\nBut it is a great error to take this passion either for a companion\nor for an assistant to virtue; that makes a man incapable of those\nnecessary counsels by which virtue is to govern herself. Those are\nfalse and inauspicious powers, and destructive of themselves, which\narise only from the accession and fervor of disease. Reason judges\naccording to right; anger will have every thing seem right, whatever it\ndoes, and when it has once pitched upon a mistake, it is never to be\nconvinced, but prefers a pertinacity, even in the greatest evil, before\nthe most necessary repentance.\nSome people are of opinion that anger inflames and animates the\nsoldier; that it is a spur to bold and arduous undertakings; and that\nit were better to moderate than to wholly suppress it, for fear of\ndissolving the spirit and force of the mind. To this I answer, that\nvirtue does not need the help of vice; but where there is any ardor\nof mind necessary, we may rouse ourselves, and be more or less brisk\nand vigorous as there is occasion: but all without anger still. It is\na mistake to say, that we may make use of anger as a common soldier,\nbut not as a commander; for if it hears reason, and follows orders,\nit is not properly anger; and if it does not, it is contumacious\nand mutinous. By this argument a man must be angry to be valiant;\ncovetous to be industrious; timorous to be safe, which makes our reason\nconfederate with our affections. And it is all one whether passion be\ninconsiderate without reason, or reason ineffectual without passion;\nsince the one cannot be without the other. It is true, the less the\npassion, the less is the mischief; for a little passion is the smaller\nevil. Nay, so far is it from being of use or advantage in the field,\nthat it is in place of all others where it is the most dangerous;\nfor the actions of war are to be managed with order and caution, not\nprecipitation and fancy; whereas anger is heedless and heady, and the\nvirtue only of _barbarous nations_; which, though their bodies were\nmuch stronger and more hardened, were still worsted by the moderation\nand discipline of the Romans. There is not upon the face of the earth\na bolder or a more indefatigable nation than the Germans; not a braver\nupon a charge, nor a hardier against colds and heats; their only\ndelights and exercise is in arms, to the utter neglect of all things\nelse: and, yet upon the encounter, they are broken and destroyed\nthrough their own undisciplined temerity, even by the most effeminate\nof men. The huntsman is not angry with the wild boar when he either\npursues or receives him; a good swordsman watches his opportunity, and\nkeeps himself upon his guard, whereas passion lays a man open: nay,\nit is one of the prime lessons in a fencing-school to learn not to\nbe angry. If Fabius had been _choleric_, Rome had been _lost_; and\nbefore he conquered _Hannibal_ he overcame _himself_. If Scipio had\nbeen _angry_, he would never have left Hannibal and his army (who were\nthe proper objects of his displeasure) to carry the war into Afric\nand so compass his end by a more temperate way. Nay, he was so slow,\nthat it was charged upon him for want of mettle and resolution. And\nwhat did the _other_ Scipio? (Africanus I mean:) how much time did he\nspend before Numantia, to the common grief both of his country and\nhimself? Though he reduced it at last by so miserable a famine, that\nthe inhabitants laid violent hands upon themselves, and left neither\nman, woman, nor child, to survive the ruins of it. If anger makes a\nman fight better, so does wine, frenzy, nay, and fear itself; for\nthe greatest coward in despair does the greatest wonders. No man is\ncourageous in his anger that was not so without it. But put the case,\nthat anger by accident may have done some good, and so have fevers\nremoved some distempers; but it is an odious kind of remedy that makes\nus indebted to a disease for a cure. How many men have been preserved\nby poison; by a fall from a precipice; by a shipwreck; by a tempest!\ndoes it therefore follow that we are to recommend the practice of these\nexperiments?\n\u201cBut in case of an exemplary and prostitute dissolution of manners,\nwhen Clodius shall be preferred, and Cicero rejected; when loyalty\nshall be broken upon the wheel, and treason sit triumphant upon the\nbench; is not this a subject to move the choler of any virtuous man?\u201d\nNo, by no means, virtue will never allow of the correcting of one vice\nby another; or that anger, which is the greater crime of the two,\nshould presume to punish the less. It is the natural property of\nvirtue to make a man serene and cheerful; and it is not for the dignity\nof a philosopher to be transported either with grief or anger; and then\nthe end of anger is sorrow, the constant effect of disappointment and\nrepentance. But, to my purpose. If a man should be angry at wickedness,\nthe greater the wickedness is, the greater must be his anger; and, so\nlong as there is wickedness in the world he must never be pleased:\nwhich makes his quiet dependent upon the humor or manners of others.\nThere passes not a day over our heads but he that is choleric shall\nhave some cause or other of displeasure, either from men, accidents,\nor business. He shall never stir out of his house but he shall meet\nwith criminals of all sorts; prodigal, impudent, covetous, perfidious,\ncontentious, children persecuting their parents, parents cursing their\nchildren, the innocent accused, the delinquent acquitted, and the judge\npracticing that in his chamber which he condemns upon the bench. In\nfine, wherever there are men there are faults; and upon these terms,\nSocrates himself should never bring the same countenance home again\nthat he carried out with him.\nIf anger was sufferable in any case, it might be allowed against an\nincorrigible criminal under the hand of justice: but punishment is\nnot matter of anger but of caution. The law is without passion, and\nstrikes malefactors as we do serpents and venomous creatures, for fear\nof greater mischief. It is not for the dignity of a judge, when he\ncomes to pronounce the fatal sentence, to express any motions of anger\nin his looks, words, or gestures: for he condemns the vice, not the\nman; and looks upon the wickedness without anger, as he does upon the\nprosperity of wicked men without envy. But though he be not angry, I\nwould have him a little moved in point of humanity; but yet without any\noffence, either to his place or wisdom. Our passions vary, but reason\nis equal; and it were a great folly for that which is stable, faithful,\nand sound, to repair for succor to that which is uncertain, false, and\ndistempered. If the offender be incurable, take him out of the world,\nthat if he will not be good he may cease to be evil; but this must be\nwithout anger too. Does any man hate an arm, or a leg, when he cuts\nit off; or reckon _that_ a passion which is only a miserable cure? We\nknock mad dogs on the head, and remove scabbed sheep out of the fold:\nand this is not anger still, but reason, to separate the sick from\nthe sound. Justice cannot be angry; nor is there any need of an angry\nmagistrate for the punishment of foolish and wicked men. The power of\nlife and death must not be managed with passion. We give a horse the\nspur that is restive or jadish, and tries to cast his rider; but this\nis without anger too, and only to take down his stomach, and bring him,\nby correction, to obedience.\nIt is true, that correction is necessary, yet within reason and bounds;\nfor it does not hurt, but profits us under an appearance of harm. Ill\ndispositions in the mind are to be dealt with as those in the body: the\nphysician first tries purging and abstinence; if this will not do, he\nproceeds to bleeding, nay, to dismembering rather than fail; for there\nis no operation too severe that ends in health. The public magistrate\nbegins with persuasion, and his business is to beget a detestation for\nvice, and a veneration for virtue; from thence, if need be, he advances\nto admonition and reproach, and then to punishments; but moderate and\nrevocable, unless the wickedness be incurable, and then the punishment\nmust be so too. There is only this difference, the physician when he\ncannot save his patient\u2019s life, endeavors to make his death easy; but\nthe magistrate aggravates the death of the criminal with infamy and\ndisgrace; not as delighting in the severity of it, (for no good man\ncan be so barbarous) but for example, and to the end that they that\nwill do no good living may do some dead. The end of all correction is\neither the amendment of wicked men, or to prevent the influence of\nill example: for men are punished with a respect to the future; not\nto expiate offenses committed, but for fear of worse to come. Public\noffenders must be a terror to others; but still, all this while, the\npower of life and death must not be managed with passion. The medicine,\nin the mean time must be suited to the disease; infamy cures one, pain\nanother, exile cures a third, beggary a fourth; but there are some that\nare only to be cured by the gibbet. I would be no more angry with a\nthief, or a traitor, than I am angry with myself when I open a vein.\nAll punishment is but a moral or civil remedy. I do not do anything\nthat is very ill, but yet I transgress often. Try me first with a\nprivate reprehension, and then with a public; if that will not serve,\nsee what banishment will do; if not that neither, load me with chains,\nlay me in prison: but if I should prove wicked for wickedness\u2019 sake,\nand leave no hope of reclaiming me, it would be a kind of mercy to\ndestroy me. Vice is incorporated with me; and there is no remedy but\nthe taking of both away together; but still without anger.\nCHAPTER VI.\nANGER IN GENERAL, WITH THE DANGER AND EFFECTS OF IT.\nThere is no surer argument of a great mind than not to be transported\nto anger by any accident; the clouds and the tempests are formed below,\nbut all above is quiet and serene; which is the emblem of a brave man,\nthat suppresses all provocations, and lives within himself, modest,\nvenerable, and composed: whereas anger is a turbulent humor, which, at\nfirst dash, casts off all shame, without any regard to order, measure,\nor good manners; transporting a man into misbecoming violences with his\ntongue, his hands, and every part of his body. And whoever considers\nthe foulness and the brutality of this vice, must acknowledge that\nthere is no such monster in Nature as one man raging against another,\nand laboring to sink that which can never be drowned but with himself\nfor company. It renders us incapable either of discourse or of other\ncommon duties. It is of all passions the most powerful; for it makes a\nman that is in love to kill his mistress, the ambitious man to trample\nupon his honors, and the covetous to throw away his fortune.\nThere is not any mortal that lives free from the danger of it; for it\nmakes even the heavy and the good-natured to be fierce and outrageous:\nit invades us like a pestilence, the lusty as well as the weak; and\nit is not either strength of body, or a good diet, that can secure\nus against it; nay, the most learned, and men otherwise of exemplary\nsobriety, are infected with it. It is so potent a passion that Socrates\ndurst not trust himself with it. \u201cSirrah,\u201d says he to his man, \u201cnow\nwould I beat you, if I were not angry with you!\u201d There is no age or\nsect of men that escapes it. Other vices take us one by one; but this,\nlike an _epidemical contagion_, sweeps all: men, women, and children,\nprinces and beggars, are carried away with it in shoals and troops as\none man.\nIt was never seen that a whole nation was in love with one woman, or\nunanimously bent upon one vice: but here and there some particular men\nare tainted with some particular crimes; whereas in anger, a single\nword many times inflames the whole multitude, and men betake themselves\npresently to fire and sword upon it; the rabble take upon them to give\nlaws to their governors; the common soldiers to their officers, to the\nruin, not only of private families, but of kingdoms: turning their arms\nagainst their own leaders, and choosing their own generals. There is\nno public council, no putting things to the vote; but in a rage the\nmutineers divide from the senate, name their head, force the nobility\nin their own houses, and put them to death with their own hands.\nThe laws of nations are violated, the persons of public ministers\naffronted, whole cities infected with a general madness, and no\nrespite allowed for the abatement or discussing of this public tumor.\nThe ships are crowded with tumultuary soldiers; and in this rude and\nill-boding manner they march, and act under the conduct only of their\nown passions. Whatever comes next serves them for arms, until at last\nthey pay for their licentious rashness with the slaughter of the whole\nparty: this is the event of a heady and inconsiderate war.\nWhen men\u2019s minds are struck with the opinion of an injury, they fall on\nimmediately wheresoever their passion leads them, without either order,\nfear, or caution: provoking their own mischief; never at rest till they\ncome to blows; and pursuing their revenge, even with their bodies,\nupon the points of their enemies\u2019 weapons. So that the anger itself is\nmuch more hurtful for us than the injury that provokes it; for the one\nis bounded, but where the other will stop, no man living knows. There\nare no greater slaves certainly, than those that serve anger; for they\nimprove their misfortunes by an impatience more insupportable than the\ncalamity that causes it.\nNor does it rise by degrees, as other passions, but flashes like\ngunpowder, blowing up all in a moment. Neither does it only press to\nthe mark, but overbears everything in the way to it. Other vices drive\nus, but this hurries us headlong; other passions stand firm themselves,\nthough perhaps we cannot resist them; but this consumes and destroys\nitself: it falls like thunder or a tempest, with an irrevocable\nviolence, that gathers strength in the passage, and then evaporates in\nthe conclusion. Other vices are unreasonable, but this is unhealthful\ntoo; other distempers have their intervals and degrees, but in this\nwe are thrown down as from a precipice: there is not anything so\namazing to others, or so destructive to itself; so proud and insolent\nif it succeeds, or so extravagant if it be disappointed. No repulse\ndiscourages it, and, for want of other matter to work upon, it falls\nfoul upon itself; and, let the ground be never so trivial, it is\nsufficient for the wildest outrage imaginable. It spares neither age,\nsex, nor quality.\nSome people would be luxurious perchance, but that they are poor; and\nothers lazy, if they were not perpetually kept at work. The simplicity\nof a country life, keeps many men in ignorance of the frauds and\nimpieties of courts and camps: but no nation or condition of men is\nexempt from the impressions of anger; and it is equally dangerous, as\nwell in war as in peace. We find that elephants will be made familiar;\nbulls will suffer children to ride upon their backs, and play with\ntheir horns; bears and lions, by good usage, will be brought to fawn\nupon their masters; how desperate a madness is it then for men, after\nthe reclaiming of the fiercest of beasts, and the bringing of them\nto be tractable and domestic, to become yet worse than beasts one to\nanother! Alexander had two friends, Clytus and Lysimachus; the one he\nexposed to a lion, the other to himself; and he that was turned loose\nto the beast escaped. Why do we not rather make the best of a short\nlife, and render ourselves amiable to all while we live, and desirable\nwhen we die?\nLet us bethink ourselves of our mortality, and not squander away the\nlittle time that we have upon animosities and feuds, as if it were\nnever to be at an end. Had we not better enjoy the pleasure of our own\nlife than to be still contriving how to gall and torment another\u2019s?\nin all our brawlings and contentions never so much as dreaming of our\nweakness. Do we not know that these implacable enmities of ours lie\nat the mercy of a fever, or any petty accident, to disappoint? Our\nfate is at hand, and the very hour that we have set for another man\u2019s\ndeath may peradventure be prevented by our own. What is it that we\nmake all this bustle for, and so needlessly disquiet our minds? We are\noffended with our servants, our masters, our princes, our clients: it\nis but a little patience, and we shall be all of us equal; so that\nthere is no need either of ambushes or of combats. Our wrath cannot\ngo beyond death; and death will most undoubtedly come whether we be\npeevish or quiet. It is time lost to take pains to do that which will\ninfallibly be done without us. But suppose that we would only have our\nenemy banished, disgraced, or damaged, let his punishment be more or\nless, it is yet too long, either for him to be inhumanly tormented,\nor for us ourselves to be most barbarously pleased with it. It holds\nin anger as in mourning, it must and it will at last fall of itself;\nlet us look to it then betimes, for when it is once come to an ill\nhabit, we shall never want matter to feed it; and it is much better to\novercome our passions than to be overcome by them. Some way or other,\neither our parents, children, servants, acquaintance, or strangers,\nwill be continually vexing us. We are tossed hither and thither by our\naffections, like a feather in a storm, and by fresh provocations the\nmadness becomes perpetual. Miserable creatures! that ever our precious\nhours should be so ill employed! How prone and eager are we in our\nhatred, and how backward in our love! Were it not much better now to\nbe making of friendships, pacifying of enemies, doing of good offices\nboth public and private, than to be still meditating of mischief, and\ndesigning how to wound one man in his fame, another in his fortune, a\nthird in his person? the one being so easy, innocent, and safe, and the\nother so difficult, impious, and hazardous. Nay, take a man in chains,\nand at the foot of his oppressor; how many are there, who, even in this\ncase, have maimed themselves in the heat of their violence upon others.\nThis untractable passion is much more easily kept out than governed\nwhen it is once admitted; for the stronger will give laws to the\nweaker; and make reason a slave to the appetite. It carries us\nheadlong; and in the course of our fury, we have no more command of\nour minds, than we have of our bodies down a precipice: when they are\nonce in motion, there is no stop until they come to the bottom. Not but\nthat it is possible for a man to be warm in winter, and not to sweat\nin the summer, either by the benefit of the place, or the hardiness of\nthe body: and in like manner we may provide against anger. But certain\nit is, that virtue and vice can never agree in the same subject; and\none may as well be a sick man and a sound at the same time, as a good\nman, and an angry. Besides, if we will needs be quarrelsome, it must\nbe either with our superior, our equal, or inferior. To contend with\nour superior is folly and madness: with our equals, it is doubtful and\ndangerous: and with our inferiors, it is base. For does any man know\nbut that he that is now our enemy may come hereafter to be our friend,\nover and above the reputation of clemency and good nature? And what\ncan be more honorable or comfortable, than to exchange a feud for a\nfriendship? The people of Rome never had more faithful allies than\nthose that were at first the most obstinate enemies; neither had the\n_Roman Empire_ ever arrived at that height of power, if Providence had\nnot mingled the vanquished with the conquerors.\nThere is an end of the contest when one side deserts it; so that\nthe paying of anger with benefits puts a period to the controversy.\nBut, however, if it be our fortune to transgress, let not our anger\ndescend to the children, friends or relations, even of our bitterest\nenemies. The very cruelty of Sylla was heightened by that instance of\nincapacitating the issue of the proscribed. It is inhuman to entail the\nhatred we have for the father upon his posterity.\nA good and a wise man is not to be an _enemy_ of wicked men, but a\n_reprover_ of them; and he is to look upon all the drunkards, the\nlustful, the thankless, covetous, and ambitious, that he meets with,\nnot otherwise than as a physician looks upon his patients; for he that\nwill be angry with _any man_ must be displeased with _all_; which were\nas ridiculous as to quarrel with a body for stumbling in the dark; with\none that is deaf, for not doing as you bid him; or with a school-boy\nfor loving his play better than his book. Democritus _laughed_, and\nHeraclitus _wept_, at the folly and wickedness of the world, but we\nnever read of any _angry philosopher_.\nThis is undoubtedly the most detestable of vices, even compared with\nthe worst of them. Avarice scrapes and gathers together that which\nsomebody may be the better for: but anger lashes out, and no man comes\n_off_ gratis. An angry master makes one servant run away, and another\nhang himself; and his choler causes him a much greater loss than he\nsuffered in the occasion of it. It is the cause of mourning to the\nfather, and of divorce to the husband: it makes the magistrate odious,\nand gives the candidate a repulse. And it is worse than luxury too,\nwhich only aims at its proper pleasure; whereas the other is bent upon\nanother body\u2019s pain.\nThe malevolent and the envious content themselves only to _wish_\nanother man miserable; but it is the business of anger to _make_ him\nso, and to wreck the mischief itself; not so much desiring the hurt\nof another, as to inflict it. Among the powerful, it breaks out into\nopen war, and into a private one with the common people, but without\nforce or arms. It engages us in treacheries, perpetual troubles and\ncontentions: it alters the very nature of a man, and punishes itself in\nthe persecution of others. Humanity excites us to love, this to hatred;\nthat to be beneficial to others, this to hurt them: beside, that,\nthough it proceeds from too high a conceit of ourselves, it is yet, in\neffect, but a narrow and contemptible affection; especially when it\nmeets with a mind that is hard and impenetrable, and returns the dart\nupon the head of him that casts it.\nTo take a farther view, now, of the miserable consequences and\nsanguinary effects of this hideous distemper; from hence come\nslaughters and poisons, wars, and desolations, the razing and burning\nof cities; the unpeopling of nations, and the turning of populous\ncountries into deserts, public massacres and regicides; princes led in\ntriumph; some murdered in their bed-chambers; others stabbed in the\nsenate or cut off in the security of their spectacles and pleasures.\nSome there are that take anger for a princely quality; as Darius,\nwho, in his expedition against the Scythians, being besought by a\nnobleman, that had three sons, that he would vouchsafe to accept\nof two of them into his service, and leave the third at home for a\ncomfort to his father. \u201cI will do more for you than that,\u201d says Darius,\n\u201cfor you shall have them all three again;\u201d so he ordered them to be\nslain before his face, and left him their bodies. But Xerxes dealt a\nlittle better with Pythius, who had five sons, and desired only one of\nthem for himself. Xerxes bade him take his choice, and he named the\n_eldest_, whom he immediately commanded to be cut in halves; and one\nhalf of the body to be laid on each side of the way when his army was\nto pass betwixt them; undoubtedly a most auspicious sacrifice; but he\ncame afterward to the end that he deserved; for he lived to see that\nprodigious power scattered and broken: and instead of military and\nvictorious troops, to be encompassed with carcasses. But these, you\nwill say, were only barbarous princes that knew neither civility nor\nletters; and these savage cruelties will be imputed perchance to their\nrudeness of manners, and want of discipline. But what will you say then\nof Alexander the Great, that was trained up under the institution of\nAristotle himself, and killed Clytus, his favorite and schoolfellow,\nwith his _own hand_, under his _own roof_, and _over the freedom of a\ncup of wine_? And what was his crime? He was loth to degenerate from a\nMacedonian _liberty_ into a Persian _slavery_; that is to say, he could\nnot _flatter_.\nLysimachus, another of his friends, he exposed to a lion; and this\nvery Lysimachus, after he had escaped this danger, was never the more\nmerciful when he came to reign himself; for he cut off the ears and\nnose of his friend Telesphorous; and when he had so disfigured him\nthat he had no longer the face of a man, he threw him into a dungeon,\nand there kept him to be showed for a monster, as a strange sight.\nThe place was so low that he was fain to creep upon all fours, and\nhis sides were galled too with the straitness of it. In this misery\nhe lay half-famished in his own filth; so odious, so terrible, and\nso loathsome a spectacle, that the horror of his condition had even\nextinguished all pity for him. \u201cNothing was ever so unlike a mar as the\npoor wretch that suffered this, saving the tyrant that acted it.\u201d\nNor did this merciless hardness only exercise itself among foreigners,\nbut the fierceness of their outrages and punishments, as well as their\nvices, brake in upon the Romans. C. Marius, that had his statue set up\neverywhere, and was adored as a God, L. Sylla commanded his bones to be\nbroken, his eyes to be pulled out, his hands to be cut off; and, as if\nevery wound had been a several death, his body to be torn to pieces,\nand Catiline was the executioner. A _cruelty_ that was only fit for\nMarius to _suffer_, Sylla to _command_, and Catiline to _act_; but most\ndishonorable and fatal to the commonwealth, to fall indifferently upon\nthe sword\u2019s point both of citizens and of enemies.\nIt was a severe instance, that of Piso too. A soldier that had leave\nto go abroad with his comrade, came back to the camp at his time,\nbut without his companion. Piso condemned him to die, as if he had\nkilled him, and appoints a centurion to see the execution. Just as the\nheadsman was ready to do his office, the other soldier appeared, to the\ngreat joy of the whole field, and the centurion bade the executioner\nhold his hand. Hereupon Piso, in a rage, mounts the _tribunal_, and\nsentences all three to death: the one because he was _condemned_,\nthe _other_ because it was for _his sake_ that his fellow-soldier\nwas _condemned_, the _centurion_ for not obeying the _order_ of his\n_superior_. An ingenious piece of inhumanity, to contrive how to make\nthree criminals, where effectively there were none.\nThere was a Persian king that caused the noses of a whole nation to\nbe cut off, and they were to thank him that he spared their heads.\nAnd this, perhaps, would have been the fate of the Macrobii, (if\nProvidence had not hindered it,) for the freedom they used to Cambyses\u2019\nambassadors, in not accepting the slavish terms that were offered\nthem. This put Cambyses into such a rage, that he presently listed\ninto his service every man that was able to bear arms; and, without\neither provisions or guides, marched immediately through dry and barren\ndeserts, and where never any man had passed before him, to take his\nrevenge. Before he was a third part of the way, his provisions failed\nhim. His men, at first, made shift with the buds of trees, boiled\nleather, and the like; but soon after there was not so much as a root\nor a plant to be gotten, nor a living creature to be seen; and then by\nlot every tenth man was to die for a nourishment to the rest, which was\nstill worse than the famine. But yet this passionate king went on so\nfar, until one part of his army was lost, and the other devoured, and\nuntil he feared that he himself might come to be served with the same\nsauce. So that at last he ordered a retreat, wanting no delicates all\nthis while for himself, while his soldiers were taking their chance who\nshould die miserably, or live worse. Here was an anger taken up against\na whole nation, that neither deserved any ill from him, nor was so much\nas known to him.\nCHAPTER VII.\nTHE ORDINARY GROUNDS AND OCCASIONS OF ANGER.\nIn this wandering state of life we meet with many occasions of trouble\nand displeasure, both great and trivial; and not a day passes but, from\nmen or things, we have some cause or other for offense; as a man must\nexpect to be jostled, dashed, and crowded, in a populous city. One\nman deceives our expectation; another delays it; and a third crosses\nit; and if everything does not succeed to our wish, we presently fall\nout either with the person, the business, the place, our fortune, or\nourselves. Some men value themselves upon their wit, and will never\nforgive anyone that pretends to lessen it; others are inflamed by wine:\nand some are distempered by sickness, weariness, watchings, love, care,\netc. Some are prone to it, by heat of constitution; but moist, dry, and\ncold complexions are more liable to other affections; as suspicion,\ndespair, fear, jealousy, etc. But most of our quarrels are of our own\ncontriving. One while we suspect upon mistake; and another while we\nmake a great matter of trifles. To say the truth, most of those things\nthat exasperate us are rather subjects of disgust than of mischief:\nthere is a large difference betwixt opposing a man\u2019s satisfaction\nand not assisting it: betwixt _taking away_ and _not giving_; but we\nreckon upon _denying_ and _deferring_ as the same thing; and interpret\nanother\u2019s being _for himself_ as if he were _against us_. Nay, we do\nmany times entertain an ill opinion of well doing, and a good one of\nthe contrary: and we hate a man for doing that very thing which we\nshould hate him for on the other side, if he did not do it.\nWe take it ill to be opposed when there is a father perhaps, a brother,\nor a friend, in the case against us; when we should rather love a\nman for it; and only wish that he could be honestly of our party. We\napprove of the fact, and detest the doer of it. It is a base thing to\nhate the person whom we cannot but commend; but it is a great deal\nworse yet if we hate him for the very thing that deserves commendation.\nThe things that we desire, if they be such as cannot be given to one\nwithout being taken away from another, must needs set those people\ntogether by the ears that desire the same thing. One man has a design\nupon my mistress, another upon mine inheritance; and that which should\nmake friends makes enemies, our being all of a mind. The general cause\nof anger is the sense or opinion of an _injury_; that is, the opinion\neither of an injury simply done, or of an injury done, which we have\nnot deserved. Some are naturally given to anger, others are provoked\nto it by occasion; the anger of women and children is commonly sharp,\nbut not lasting: old men are rather querulous and peevish. Hard labor,\ndiseases, anxiety of thought, and whatsoever hurts the body or the\nmind, disposes a man to be froward, but we must not add fire to fire.\nHe that duly considers the subject-matter of all our controversies\nand quarrels, will find them low and mean, not worth the thought of\na generous mind; but the greatest noise of all is about _money_. This\nis it that sets fathers and children together by the ears, husbands\nand wives; and makes way for sword and poison. This is it that tires\nout courts of justice, enrages princes, and lays cities in the dust,\nto seek for gold and silver in the ruins of them. This is it that\nfinds work for the judge to determine which side is least in the\nwrong; and whose is the more plausible avarice, the plaintiff\u2019s or the\ndefendant\u2019s. And what is it that we contend for all this while, but\nthose baubles that make us cry when we should laugh? To see a rich\nold cuff, that has nobody to leave his estate to, break his heart\nfor a handful of dirt; and a gouty usurer, that has no other use of\nhis fingers left him but to count withal; to see him, I say in the\nextremity of his fit, wrangling for the odd money in his interest. If\nall that is precious in Nature were gathered into one mass, it were\nnot worth the trouble of a sober mind. It were endless to run over all\nthose ridiculous passions that are moved about meats and drinks, and\nthe matter of our luxury; nay, about words, looks, actions, jealousies,\nmistakes, which are all of them as contemptible fooleries as those very\nbaubles that children scratch and cry for. There is nothing great or\nserious in all that which we keep such a clutter about; the madness\nof it is, that we set too great a value upon trifles. One man flies\nout upon a salute, a letter, a speech, a question, a gesture, a wink,\na look. An action moves one man; a word affects another; one man is\ntender of his family; another of his person; one sets up for an orator,\nanother for a philosopher: this man will not bear pride, nor that man\nopposition. He that plays the tyrant at home, is gentle as a lamb\nabroad. Some take offense if a man ask a favor of them, and others, if\nhe does not. Every man has his weak side; let us learn which that is,\nand take a care of it; for the same thing does not work upon all men\nalike. We are moved like beasts at the idle appearances of things, and\nthe fiercer the creature, the more is it startled. The sight of a red\ncoat enrages a bull; a shadow provokes the asp; nay, so unreasonable\nare some men, that they take moderate benefits for injuries, and\nsquabble about it with their nearest relations: \u201cThey have done this\nand that for others,\u201d they cry; \u201cand they might have dealt better with\nus if they had pleased.\u201d Very good! and if it be less than we looked\nfor, it may be yet more than we deserve. Of all unquiet humors this\nis the worst, that will never suffer any man to be happy, so long as\nhe sees a happier man than himself. I have known some men so weak as\nto think themselves contemned if a horse did but play the jade with\n_them_, that is yet obedient to _another rider_. A brutal folly to be\noffended at a mute animal; for no injury can be done us without the\nconcurrence of reason. A beast may hurt us, as a sword or a stone, and\nno otherwise. Nay, there are that will complain of \u201cfoul weather, a\nraging sea, a biting winter,\u201d as if it were expressly directed to them;\nand this they charge upon Providence, whose operations are all of them\nso far from being injurious, that they are beneficial to us.\nHow vain and idle are many of those things that make us stark mad! A\nresty horse, the overturning of a glass, the falling of a key, the\ndragging of a chair, a jealousy, a misconstruction. How shall that\nman endure the extremities of hunger and thirst that flies out into a\nrage for putting of a little too much water in his wine? What haste\nis there to lay a servant by the heels, or break a leg or an arm\nimmediately for it, as if he were not to have the same power over him\nan hour after, that he has at that instant? The answer of a servant, a\nwife, a tenant, puts some people out of all patience; and yet they can\nquarrel with the government, for not allowing them the same liberty in\npublic, which they themselves deny to their own families. If they say\nnothing, it is contumacy: if they speak or laugh, it is insolence. As\nif a man had his ears given him only for music; whereas we must suffer\nall sorts of noises, good and bad, both of man and beast. How idle\nis it to start at the tinkling of a bell, or the creaking of a door,\nwhen, for all this delicacy, we must endure thunder! Neither are our\neyes less curious and fantastical than our ears. When we are abroad, we\ncan bear well enough with foul ways, nasty streets, noisome ditches;\nbut a spot upon a dish at home, or an unswept hearth, absolutely\ndistracts us. And what is the reason, but that we are patient in the\none place, and fantastically peevish in the other? Nothing makes us\nmore intemperate than luxury, that shrinks at every stroke, and starts\nat every shadow. It is death to some to have another sit above them,\nas if a body were ever the more or the less honest for the cushion.\nBut they are only weak creatures that think themselves wounded if they\nbe but touched. One of the Sybarites, that saw a fellow hard at work a\ndigging, desired him to give over, for it made him weary to see him:\nand it was an ordinary complaint with him, that \u201che could take no\nrest because the rose-leaves lay double under him.\u201d When we are once\nweakened with our pleasures, everything grows intolerable. And we are\nangry as well with those things that cannot hurt us as with those that\ndo. We tear a book because it is blotted; and our clothes, because\nthey are not well made: things that neither deserve our anger nor feel\nit: the tailor, perchance, did his best, or, however, had no intent to\ndisplease us: if so, first, why should we be angry at all? Secondly,\nwhy should we be angry with the thing for the man\u2019s sake? Nay, our\nanger extends even to dogs, horses, and other beasts.\nIt was a blasphemous and a sottish extravagance, that of Caius C\u00e6sar,\nwho challenged Jupiter for making such a noise with his _thunder_, that\nhe could not hear his mimics, and so invented a machine in imitation\nof it to oppose _thunder_ to _thunder_; a brutal conceit, to imagine,\neither that he could reach the Almighty, or that the Almighty could not\nreach him!\nAnd every jot as ridiculous, though not so impious, was that of Cyrus;\nwho, in his design upon Babylon, found a river in his way that put a\nstop to his march: the current was strong, and carried away one of the\nhorses that belonged to his own chariot: upon this he swore, that since\nit had obstructed _his_ passage, it should never hinder any body\u2019s\nelse; and presently set his whole army to work upon it, which diverted\nit into a hundred and fourscore channels, and laid it dry. In this\nignoble and unprofitable employment he lost his time, and the soldiers\ntheir courage, and gave his adversaries an opportunity of providing\nthemselves, while he was waging war with a river instead of an enemy.\nCHAPTER VIII.\nADVICE IN THE CASES OF CONTUMELY AND REVENGE.\nOf provocations to anger there are two sorts; there is an _injury_,\nand there is a _contumely_. The former in its own nature is the\nheavier; the other slight in itself, and only troublesome to a wounded\nimagination. And yet some there are that will bear blows, and death\nitself, rather than contumelious words. A contumely is an indignity\nbelow the consideration of the very law; and not worthy either of\na revenge, or so much as a complaint. It is only the vexation and\ninfirmity of a weak mind, as well as the practice of a haughty and\ninsolent nature, and signifies no more to a wise and sober man than\nan idle dream, that is no sooner past than forgotten. It is true, it\nimplies contempt; but what needs any man care for being contemptible\nto others, if he be not so to himself? For a child in the arms to\nstrike the mother, tear her hair, claw the face of her, and call her\nnames, that goes for nothing with us, because the child knows not what\nhe does. Neither are we moved at the impudence and bitterness of a\n_buffoon_, though he fall upon his own master as well as the guests;\nbut, on the contrary, we encourage and entertain the freedom.\nAre we not mad then, to be delighted and displeased with the same\nthing, and to take that as an _injury_ from one man, which passes only\nfor a _raillery_ from another? He that is wise will behave himself\ntoward all men as we do to our children; for they are but children\ntoo, though they have gray hairs: they are indeed of a larger size,\nand their errors are grown up with them; they live without rule, they\ncovet without choice, they are timorous and unsteady; and if at any\ntime they happen to be quiet, it is more out of fear than reason. It\nis a wretched condition to stand in awe of everybody\u2019s tongue; and\nwhosoever is vexed at a reproach would be proud if he were commended.\nWe should look upon contumelies, slanders, and ill words, only as the\nclamor of enemies, or arrows shot at a distance, that make a clattering\nupon our arms, but do no execution. A man makes himself less than his\nadversary by fancying that he is contemned. Things are only ill that\nare ill taken; and it is not for a man of worth to think himself better\nor worse for the opinion of others. He that thinks himself injured, let\nhim say, \u201cEither I have deserved this, or I have not. If I have, it is\na judgment; if I have not, it is an injustice: and the doer of it has\nmore reason to be ashamed than the sufferers.\u201d\nNature has assigned every man his post, which he is bound in honor to\nmaintain, let him be never so much pressed. Diogenes was disputing of\nanger, and an insolent young fellow, to try if he could put him beside\nhis philosophy, spit in his face: \u201cYoung man,\u201d says Diogenes, \u201cthis\ndoes not make me angry yet; but I am in some doubt whether I should be\nso or not.\u201d Some are so impatient that they cannot bear a contumely,\neven from a woman; whose very beauty, greatness, and ornaments, are all\nof them little enough to vindicate her from any indecencies, without\nmuch modesty and discretion; nay, they will lay it to heart even from\nthe meanest of servants. How wretched is that man whose peace lies at\nthe mercy of the people?\nA physician is not angry at the intemperance of a mad patient; nor does\nhe take it ill to be railed at by a man in a fever; just so should a\nwise man treat all mankind as a physician does his patient; and looking\nupon them only as sick and extravagant, let their words and actions,\nwhether good or bad, go equally for nothing, attending still his duty\neven in the coarsest offices that may conduce to their recovery. Men\nthat are proud, froward, and powerful, he values their scorn as little\nas their quality, and looks upon them no otherwise than as people in\nthe excess of a fever. If a beggar worships him, or if he takes no\nnotice of him, it is all one to him; and with a rich man he makes it\nthe same case. Their honors and their injuries he accounts much alike;\nwithout rejoicing at the one, or grieving at the other.\nIn these cases, the rule is to pardon all offenses, where there is any\nsign of repentance, or hope of amendment. It does not hold in injuries\nas in benefits, the requiting of the one with the other; for it is\na shame to overcome in the one, and in the other to be overcome. It\nis the part of a great mind to despise injuries; and it is one kind\nof revenge to neglect a man as not worth it: for it makes the first\naggressor too considerable. Our philosophy, methinks, might carry us\nup to the bravery of a generous mastiff, that can hear the barking of\na thousand curs without taking any notice of them. He that receives\nan injury from his superior, it is not enough for him to bear it with\npatience, and without any thought of revenge, but he must receive it\nwith a cheerful countenance, and look as if he did not understand it\ntoo; for if he appear too sensible, he shall be sure to have more of\nit. \u201cIt is a damned humor in great men, that whom they wrong they will\nhate.\u201d\nIt is well answered of an old courtier, that was asked how he kept\nso long in favor? \u201cWhy,\u201d says he, \u201cby receiving injuries, and crying\nyour humble servant for them.\u201d Some men take it for an argument of\ngreatness to have revenge in their power; but so far is he that is\nunder the dominion of anger from being great, that he is not so much\nas free. Not but that anger is a kind of pleasure to some in the act\nof revenge; but the very _word_ is _inhuman_, though it may pass for\n_honest_. \u201cVirtue,\u201d in short, \u201cis impenetrable, and revenge is only the\nconfession of an infirmity.\u201d\nIt is a fantastical humor, that the same jest in private should make us\nmerry, and yet enrage us in public; nay, we will not allow the liberty\nthat we take. Some railleries we account pleasant, others bitter: a\nconceit upon a _squint-eye_, a _hunch-back_, or any personal defect,\npasses for a reproach. And why may we not as well hear it as see it?\nNay, if a man imitates our gait, speech, or any natural imperfection,\nit puts us out of all patience; as if the counterfeit were more\ngrievous than the doing of the thing itself. Some cannot endure to\nhear of their age, nor others of their poverty; and they make the\nthing the more taken notice of the more they desire to hide it. Some\nbitter jest (for the purpose) was broken upon you at the table: keep\nbetter company then. In the freedom of cups, a sober man will hardly\ncontain himself within bounds. It sticks with us extremely sometimes,\nthat the porter will not let us in to his great master. Will any but a\nmadman quarrel with a cur for barking, when he may pacify him with a\ncrust? What have we to do but to keep further off, and laugh at him?\nFidus Cornelius (a tall slim fellow) fell downright a-crying in the\nsenate-house at Corbulo\u2019s saying that \u201che looked like an ostrich.\u201d\nHe was a man that made nothing of a lash upon his life and manners;\nbut it was worse than death to him a reflection upon his person. No\nman was ever ridiculous to others that laughed at himself first: it\nprevents mischief, and it is a spiteful disappointment of those that\ntake pleasure in such abuses. Vatinius, (a man that was made up for\nscorn and hatred, scurrilous and impudent to the highest degree, but\nmost abusively witty and with all this he was diseased, and deformed to\nextremity), his way, was always to make sport with himself, and so he\nprevented the mockeries of other people. There are none more abusive\nto others than they that lie most open to it themselves; but the humor\ngoes round, and he that laughs at me to-day will have somebody to laugh\nat him to-morrow, and revenge my quarrel. But, however, there are some\nliberties that will never go down with some men.\nAsiaticus Valerius, (one of Caligula\u2019s particular friends, and a man of\nstomach, that would not easily digest an affront) Caligula told him in\npublic what kind of bedfellow his wife was. Good God! that ever any man\nshould hear this, or a prince speak it, especially to a man of consular\nauthority, a friend, and a husband: and in such a manner too as at once\nto own his disgust and his adultery. The tribune Ch\u00e6reas had a weak\nbroken voice, like an hermaphrodite; when he came to Caligula for the\n_word_, he would give him sometimes _Venus_, otherwhiles _Priapus_,\nas a slur upon him both ways. Valerius was afterwards the principal\ninstrument in the conspiracy against him; and Ch\u00e6reas, to convince him\nof his manhood, at one blow cleft him down the chin with his sword.\nNo man was so forward as Caligula to _break_ a jest, and no man so\nunwilling to _bear_ it.\nCHAPTER IX.\nCAUTIONS AGAINST ANGER IN THE MATTER OF EDUCATION, CONVERSE, AND OTHER\nGENERAL RULES OF PREVENTING IT, BOTH IN OURSELVES AND OTHERS.\nAll that we have to say in particular upon this subject lies under\nthese two heads: first, that we do not _fall_ into anger; and secondly,\nthat we do not _transgress in it_. As in the case of our bodies, we\nhave some medicines to preserve us when we are well, and others to\nrecover us when we are sick; so it is one thing not to admit it, and\nanother thing to overcome it. We are, in the first place, to avoid all\nprovocations, and the beginnings of anger: for if we be once down, it\nis a hard task to get up again. When our passion has got the better of\nour reason, and the enemy is received into the gate, we cannot expect\nthat the conqueror should take conditions from the prisoner. And, in\ntruth, our reason, when it is thus mastered, turns effectually into\npassion. A careful education is a great matter; for our minds are\neasily formed in our youth, but it is a harder business to cure ill\nhabits: beside that, we are inflamed by climate, constitution, company,\nand a thousand other accidents, that we are not aware of.\nThe choice of a good nurse, and a well-natured tutor, goes a great\nway: for the sweetness both of the blood and of the manners will\npass into the child. There is nothing breeds anger more than a soft\nand effeminate education; and it is very seldom seen that either\nthe mother\u2019s or the school-master\u2019s darling ever comes to good. But\n_my young master_, when he comes into the world, behaves himself\nlike a choleric coxcomb; for flattery, and a great fortune, nourish\ntouchiness. But it is a nice point so to check the seeds of anger in\na child as not to take off his edge, and quench his spirits; whereof\na principal care must be taken betwixt license and severity, that he\nbe neither too much emboldened nor depressed. Commendation gives him\ncourage and confidence; but then the danger is, of blowing him up\ninto insolence and wrath: so that when to use the bit, and when the\nspur, is the main difficulty. Never put him to a necessity of begging\nanything basely: or if he does, let him go without it. Inure him to\na familiarity where he has any emulation; and in all his exercises\nlet him understand that it is generous to overcome his competitor,\nbut not to hurt him. Allow him to be pleased when he does well, but\nnot transported; for that will puff him up into too high a conceit\nof himself. Give him nothing that he cries for till the dogged fit\nis over, but then let him have it when he is quiet; to show him that\nthere is nothing to be gotten by being peevish. Chide him for whatever\nhe does amiss, and make him betimes acquainted with the fortune that\nhe was born to. Let his diet be cleanly, but sparing; and clothe him\nlike the rest of his fellows: for by placing him upon that equality at\nfirst, he will be the less proud afterward: and, consequently the less\nwaspish and quarrelsome.\nIn the next place, let us have a care of temptations that we cannot\nresist, and provocations that we cannot bear; and especially of sour\nand exceptious company: for a cross humor is contagious. Nor is it all\nthat a man shall be the better for the example of a quiet conversation;\nbut an angry disposition is troublesome, because it has nothing else to\nwork upon. We should therefore choose a sincere, easy, and temperate\ncompanion, that will neither provoke anger nor return it; nor give a\nman any occasion of exercising his distempers. Nor is it enough to be\ngentle, submissive, and humane, without integrity and plain-dealing;\nfor flattery is as offensive on the other side. Some men would take a\ncurse from you better than a compliment. C\u00e6lius, a passionate orator,\nhad a friend of singular patience that supped with him, who had no\nway to avoid a quarrel but by saying _amen_ to all that C\u00e6lius said.\nC\u00e6lius, taking this ill: \u201cSay something against me,\u201d says he, \u201cthat you\nand I may be two;\u201d and he was angry with him because he would not: but\nthe dispute fell, as it needs must, for want of an opponent.\nHe that is naturally addicted to anger, let him use a moderate diet,\nand abstain from wine; for it is but adding fire to fire. Gentle\nexercises, recreations, and sports, temper and sweeten the mind. Let\nhim have a care also of long and obstinate disputes; for it is easier\nnot to begin them than to put an end to them. Severe studies are not\ngood for him either, as _law_, _mathematics_; too much attention preys\nupon the spirits, and makes him eager: but _poetry_, _history_ and\nthose lighter entertainments, may serve him for diversion and relief.\nHe that would be quiet, must not venture at things out of his reach,\nor beyond his strength; for he shall either stagger under the burden,\nor discharge it upon the next man he meets; which is the same case in\ncivil and domestic affairs. Business that is ready and practicable\ngoes off with ease; but when it is too heavy for the bearer, they fall\nboth together. Whatsoever we design, we should first take a measure of\nourselves, and compare our force with the undertaking; for it vexes\na man not to go through with his work: a repulse inflames a generous\nnature, as it makes one that is _phlegmatic_, _sad_. I have known\nsome that have advised looking in a glass when a man is in the fit,\nand the very spectacle of his own deformity has cured him. Many that\nare troublesome in their drink, and know their own infirmity, give\ntheir servant order beforehand to take them away by force for fear\nof mischief, and not to obey their masters themselves when they are\nhot-headed. If the thing were duly considered we should need no other\ncure than the bare consideration of it. We are not angry at madmen,\nchildren, and fools, because they do not know what they do: and why\nshould not imprudence have an equal privilege in other cases? If a\nhorse kick, or a dog bite, shall a man kick or bite again? The one,\nit is true, is wholly void of reason, but it is also an equivalent\ndarkness of mind that possesses the other. So long as we are among\nmen, let us cherish humanity, and so live that no man may be either in\nfear or in danger of us. Losses, injuries, reproaches, calumnies, they\nare but short inconveniences, and we should bear them with resolution.\nBeside that, some people are above our anger, others below it. To\ncontend with our superiors were a folly, and with our inferiors an\nindignity.\nThere is hardly a more effectual remedy against anger than patience\nand consideration. Let but the first fervor abate, and that mist which\ndarkens the mind will be either lessened or dispelled; a day, nay,\nan hour, does much in the most violent cases, and perchance totally\nsuppresses it; time discovers the truth of things, and turns that\ninto judgment which at first was anger. Plato was about to strike his\nservant, and while his hand was in the air, he checked himself, but\nstill held it in that menacing posture. A friend of his took notice of\nit, and asked him what he meant? \u201cI am now,\u201d says Plato, \u201cpunishing of\nan angry man;\u201d so that he had left his servant to chastise himself.\nAnother time his servant having committed a great fault: \u201cSpeusippus,\u201d\nsays he, \u201cdo you beat that fellow, for I am angry,\u201d so that he forebore\nstriking him for the very reason that would have made another man have\ndone it. \u201cI am angry,\u201d says he, \u201cand shall go further than becomes me.\u201d\nNor is it fit that a servant should be in his power that is not his\nown master. Why should any one venture now to trust an angry man with\na revenge, when Plato durst not trust himself? Either he must govern\nthat, or that will undo him. Let us do our best to overcome it, but let\nus, however, keep it close, without giving it any vent. An angry man,\nif he gives himself liberty at all times, will go too far. If it comes\nonce to show itself in the eye or countenance, it has got the better\nof us. Nay, we should so oppose it as to put on the very contrary\ndispositions; calm looks, soft and slow speech, an easy and deliberate\nmarch, and by little and little, we may possibly bring our thoughts\ninto sober conformity with our actions. When Socrates was angry, he\nwould take himself in it, and _speak low_, in opposition to the motions\nof his displeasure. His friends would take notice of it; and it was\nnot to his disadvantage neither, but rather to his credit, that so\nmany should _know_ that he was angry, and nobody _feel_ it; which\ncould not have been, if he had not given his friends the same liberty\nof admonition which he himself took. And this course should we take;\nwe should desire our friends not to flatter us in our follies, but to\ntreat us with all liberties of reprehension, even when we are least\nwilling to bear it, against so powerful and so insinuating an evil;\nwe should call for help while we have our eyes in our head, and are\nyet masters of ourselves. Moderation is profitable for subjects, but\nmore for princes, who have the means of executing all that their anger\nprompts them to. When that power comes once to be exercised to a common\nmischief, it can never long continue; a common fear joining in one\ncause all their divided complaints. In a word now, how we may prevent,\nmoderate, or master this impotent passion in others.\nIt is not enough to be sound ourselves, unless we endeavor to make\nothers so, wherein we must accommodate the remedy to the temper of the\npatient. Some are to be dealt with by artifice and address: as, for\nexample, \u201cWhy will you gratify your enemies to show yourself so much\nconcerned? It is not worth your anger: it is below you: I am as much\ntroubled at it myself as you can be; but you had better say nothing,\nand take your time to be even with them.\u201d Anger in some people is to be\nopenly opposed; in others, there must be a little yielding, according\nto the disposition of the person. Some are won by entreaties, others\nare gained by mere shame and conviction, and some by delay; a dull way\nof cure for a violent distemper, but this must be the last experiment.\nOther affections may be better dealt with at leisure; for they proceed\ngradually: but this commences and perfects itself in the same moment.\nIt does not, like other passions, solicit and mislead us, but it runs\naway with us by force, and hurries us on with an irresistible temerity,\nas well to our own as to another\u2019s ruin: not only flying in the face\nof him that provokes us, but like a torrent, bearing down all before\nit. There is no encountering the first heat and fury of it: for it is\ndeaf and mad, the best way is (in the beginning) to give it time and\nrest, and let it spend itself: while the passion is too hot to handle,\nwe may deceive it; but, however, let all instruments of revenge be\nput out of the way. It is not amiss sometimes to pretend to be angry\ntoo; and join with him, not only in the opinion of the injury, but in\nthe seeming contrivance of a revenge. But this must be a person then\nthat has some authority over him. This is a way to get time, and, by\nadvising upon some greater punishment to delay the present. If the\npassion be outrageous, try what shame or fear can do. If weak, it is no\nhard matter to amuse it by strange stories, grateful news, or pleasant\ndiscourses. Deceit, in this case, is friendship; for men must be\ncozened to be cured.\nThe injuries that press hardest upon us are those which either we\nhave not deserved, or not expected, or, at least, not in so high a\ndegree. This arises from the love of ourselves: for every man takes\nupon him, like a prince, in this case, to practice all liberties, and\nto allow none, which proceeds either from ignorance or insolence. What\nnews is it for people to do ill things? for an enemy to hurt us; nay,\nfor a friend or a servant to transgress, and to prove treacherous,\nungrateful, covetous, impious? What we find in one man we may in\nanother, and there is more security in fortune than in men. Our joys\nare mingled with fear, and a tempest may arise out of a calm; but a\nskilful pilot is always provided for it.\nCHAPTER X.\nAGAINST RASH JUDGMENT.\nIt is good for every man to fortify himself on his weak side: and\nif he loves his peace he must not be inquisitive, and hearken to\ntale-bearers; for the man that is over-curious to hear and see\neverything, multiplies troubles to himself: for a man does not\nfeel what he does not know. He that is listening after private\ndiscourse, and what people say of him, shall never be at peace. How\nmany things that are innocent in themselves are made injuries yet by\nmisconstruction! Wherefore, some things we are to pause upon, others to\nlaugh at, and others again to pardon. Or, if we cannot avoid the sense\nof indignities, let us however shun the open profession of it, which\nmay easily be done, as appears by many examples of those that have\nsuppressed their anger under the awe of a greater fear. It is a good\ncaution not to believe any thing until we are very certain of it; for\nmany probable things prove false, and a short time will make evidence\nof the undoubted truth. We are prone to believe many things which\nwe are willing to hear, and so we conclude, and take up a prejudice\nbefore we can judge. Never condemn a friend unheard; or without letting\nhim know his accuser, or his crime. It is a common thing to say, \u201cDo\nnot you tell that you had it from me: for if you do, I will deny\nit, and never tell you any thing again:\u201d by which means friends are\nset together by the ears, and the informer slips his neck out of the\ncollar. Admit no stories upon these terms: for it is an unjust thing\nto believe in private and to be angry openly. He that delivers himself\nup to guess and conjecture runs a great hazard; for there can be no\nsuspicion without some probable grounds; so that without much candor\nand simplicity, and making the best of every thing, there is no living\nin society with mankind. Some things that offend us we have by report;\nothers we see or hear. In the first case, let us not be too credulous:\nsome people frame stories that they may deceive us; others only tell\nwhat they hear, and are deceived themselves: some make it their sport\nto do ill offices, others do them only to pick a thank: there are some\nthat would part the dearest friends in the world; others love to do\nmischief, and stand aloof off to see what comes of it. If it be a small\nmatter, I would have witnesses; but if it be a greater, I would have\nit upon oath, and allow time to the accused, and counsel too, and hear\nover and over again.\nIn those cases where we ourselves are witnesses, we should take into\nconsideration all the circumstances. If a _child_, it was _ignorance_:\nif a _woman_, a _mistake_: if done by _command_ a _necessity_; if a\n_man_ be injured, it is but _quod pro quo_: if a _judge_, he _knows_\nwhat he does: if a _prince_, I must _submit_; either if _guilty_, to\n_justice_, or if _innocent_, to _fortune_: if a _brute_, I make myself\none by _imitating_ it: if a _calamity_ or _disease_, my best relief\nis _patience_: if _providence_, it is both _impious_ and _vain_ to\nbe _angry_ at it: if a _good_ man, I will make the _best_ of it: if\na _bad_, I will never _wonder_ at it. Nor is it only by _tales_ and\n_stories_ that we are inflamed, but _suspicions_, _countenances_, nay,\na _look_ or a _smile_, is enough to blow us up. In these cases, let us\nsuspend our displeasure, and plead the cause of the absent. \u201cPerhaps\nhe is innocent; or, if not, I have time to consider of it and may take\nmy revenge at leisure:\u201d but when it is once _executed_ it is not to\nbe _recalled_. A jealous head is apt to take that to himself which\nwas never meant him. Let us therefore trust to nothing but what we\nsee, and chide ourselves where we are over-credulous. By this course\nwe shall not be so easily imposed upon, nor put to trouble ourselves\nabout things not worth the while: as the loitering of a servant upon an\nerrand, and the tumbling of a bed, or the spilling of a glass of drink.\nIt is a madness to be disordered at these fooleries; we consider the\nthing done, and not the doer of it. \u201cIt may be he did it unwillingly,\nor by chance. It was a trick put upon him, or he was forced to it. He\ndid it for reward perhaps, not hatred; nor of his own accord, but he\nwas urged on to it.\u201d Nay, some regard must be had to the age of the\nperson, or to fortune; and we must consult humanity and candor in the\ncase. One does me a _great mischief_ at _unawares_; another does me a\nvery _small_ one by _design_, or peradventure none at all, but intended\nme one. The latter was more in fault, but I will be angry with neither.\nWe must distinguish betwixt what a man cannot do and what he will not.\n\u201cIt is true he has once offended me; but how often has he pleased me!\nHe has offended me often, and in other kinds; and why should not I bear\nit as well now as I have done?\u201d Is he my friend? why then, \u201cIt was\nagainst his will.\u201d Is he my enemy? It is \u201cno more than I looked for.\u201d\nLet us give way to wise men, and not squabble with fools; and say thus\nto ourselves, \u201cWe have all of us our errors.\u201d No man is so circumspect,\nso considerate, or so fearful of offending, but he has much to answer\nfor.\nA generous prisoner cannot immediately comply with all the sordid and\nlaborious offices of a slave. A footman that is not breathed cannot\nkeep pace with his master\u2019s horse. He that is over-watched may be\nallowed to be drowsy. All these things are to be weighed before we give\nany ear to the first impulse. If it be my duty to love my country,\nI must be kind also to my countrymen; if a veneration be due to the\nwhole, so is a piety also to the parts: and it is the common interest\nto preserve them. We are all members of one body, and it is as natural\nto help one another as for the hands to help the feet, or the eyes the\nhands. Without the love and care of the parts, the whole can never\nbe preserved, and we must spare one another because we are born for\nsociety, which cannot be maintained without a regard to particulars.\nLet this be a rule to us, never to deny a pardon, that does no hurt\neither to the giver or receiver. That may be well enough in one which\nis ill in another; and therefore we are not to condemn anything that is\ncommon to a nation; for custom defends it. But much more pardonable are\nthose things which are common to mankind.\nIt is a kind of spiteful comfort, that whoever does me an injury may\nreceive one; and that there is a power over him that is above me. A man\nshould stand as firm against all indignities as a rock does against\nthe waves. As it is some satisfaction to a man in a mean condition\nthat there is no security in a more prosperous; and as the loss of\na son in a corner is borne with more patience upon the sight of a\nfuneral carried out of a palace; so are injuries and contempts the more\ntolerable from a meaner person, when we consider, that the greatest\nmen and fortunes are not exempt. The wisest also of mortals have their\nfailings, and no man living is without the same excuse. The difference\nis, that we do not all of us transgress the same way; but we are\nobliged in humanity to bear one with another.\nWe should, every one of us, bethink ourselves, how remiss we have\nbeen in our duties, how immodest in our discourses, how intemperate\nin our cups; and why not, as well, how extravagant we have been in\nour passions? Let us clear ourselves of this evil, purge our minds,\nand utterly root out all those vices, which upon leaving the least\nsting, will grow again and recover. We must think of everything, expect\neverything, that we may not be surprised. It is a shame, says Fabius,\nfor a commander to excuse himself by saying, \u201cI was not aware of it.\u201d\nCHAPTER XI.\nTAKE NOTHING ILL FROM ANOTHER MAN, UNTIL YOU HAVE MADE IT YOUR OWN CASE.\nIt is not prudent to deny a pardon to any man, without first examining\nif we stand not in need of it ourselves; for it may be our lot to ask\nit, even at his feet to whom we refuse it. But we are willing enough to\ndo what we are very unwilling to suffer. It is unreasonable to charge\npublic vices upon particular persons; for we are all of us wicked,\nand that which we blame in others we find in ourselves. It is not a\npaleness in one, or a leanness in another, but a pestilence that has\nlaid hold upon all.\nIt is a wicked world, and we make part of it; and the way to be quiet\nis to bear one with another. \u201cSuch a man,\u201d we cry, \u201chas done me a\nshrewd turn, and I never did him any hurt.\u201d Well, but it may be I have\nmischieved other people, or at least, I may live to do as much to him\nas that comes to. \u201cSuch a one has spoken ill things of me;\u201d but if I\nfirst speak ill of him, as I do of many others, this is not an injury,\nbut a repayment. What if he did overshoot himself? He was loth to lose\nhis conceit perhaps, but there was no malice in it; and if he had\nnot done me a mischief, he must have done himself one. How many good\noffices are there that look like injuries! Nay, how many have been\nreconciled and good friends after a professed hatred!\nBefore we lay anything to heart, let us ask ourselves if we have not\ndone the same thing to others. But where shall we find an equal judge?\nHe that loves another man\u2019s wife (only because she is another\u2019s) will\nnot suffer his own to be so much looked upon. No man is so fierce\nagainst calumny as the evil speaker; none so strict exactors of modesty\nin a servant as those that are most prodigal of their own. We carry our\nneighbors\u2019 crimes in sight, and we throw our own over our shoulders.\nThe intemperance of a bad son is chastised by a worse father; and the\nluxury that we punish in others, we allow to ourselves. The tyrant\nexclaims against homicide; and sacrilege against theft. We are angry\nwith the persons, but not with the faults.\nSome things there are that cannot hurt us, and others will not; as good\nmagistrates, parents, tutors, judges; whose reproof or correction we\nare to take as we do abstinence, bleeding, and other uneasy things,\nwhich we are the better for, in which cases, we are not so much to\nreckon upon what we suffer as upon what we have done. \u201cI take it ill,\u201d\nsays one; and, \u201cI have done nothing,\u201d says another: when, at the same\ntime, we make it worse, by adding arrogance and contumacy to our first\nerror. We cry out presently, \u201cWhat law have we transgressed?\u201d As if the\nletter of the law were the sum of our duty, and that piety, humanity,\nliberality, justice, and faith, were things beside our business. No,\nno; the rule of human duty is of a greater latitude; and we have many\nobligations upon us that are not to be found in the _statute-books_.\nAnd yet we fall short of the exactness event of that _legal\ninnocency_. We have intended one thing and done another; wherein only\nthe want of success has kept us from being criminals. This very thing,\nmethinks, should make us more favorable to delinquents, and to forgive\nnot only ourselves, but the gods too; of whom we seem to have harder\nthoughts in taking that to be a particular evil directed to us, that\nbefalls us only by the common law of mortality. In fine, no man living\ncan absolve himself to his conscience, though to the world, perhaps, he\nmay. It is true, that we are also condemned to pains and diseases, and\nto death too, which is no more than the quitting of the soul\u2019s house.\nBut why should any man complain of bondage, that, wheresoever he looks,\nhas his way open to liberty? That precipice, that sea, that river, that\nwell, there is freedom in the bottom of it. It hangs upon every crooked\nbow; and not only a man\u2019s throat, or his heart, but every vein in his\nbody, opens a passage to it.\nTo conclude, where my proper virtue fails me, I will have recourse to\nexamples, and say to myself, Am I greater than Philip or Augustus, who\nboth of them put up with greater reproaches? Many have pardoned their\nenemies, and shall not I forgive a neglect, a little freedom of the\ntongue? Nay, the patience but of a second thought does the business:\nfor though the first shock be violent; take it in parts, and it is\nsubdued. And, to wind up all in one word, the great lesson of mankind,\nas well in this as in all other cases, is, \u201cto do as we would be done\nby.\u201d\nCHAPTER XII.\nOF CRUELTY.\nThere is so near an affinity betwixt _anger_ and _cruelty_, that many\npeople confound them; as if _cruelty_ were only the _execution_ of\n_anger_ in the payment of a _revenge_: which holds in some cases,\nbut not in others. There are a sort of men that take delight in the\nspilling of human blood, and in the death of those that never did them\nany injury, nor were ever so much suspected for it; as Apollodorus,\nPhalaris, Sinis, Procrustus, and others, that burnt men alive; whom\nwe cannot so properly call _angry_ as _brutal_, for _anger_ does\nnecessarily presuppose an injury, either _done_, or _conceived_, or\n_feared_, but the other takes _pleasure_ in _tormenting_, without so\nmuch as pretending any _provocation_ to it, and _kills_ merely for\n_killing sake_. The _original_ of this _cruelty_ perhaps was _anger_,\nwhich by frequent _exercise_ and _custom_, has lost all sense of\n_humanity_ and _mercy_, and they that are thus affected are so far\nfrom the countenance and appearance of men in _anger_, that they will\n_laugh_, _rejoice_, and _entertain themselves_ with the most _horrid\nspectacles_, as _racks_, _jails_, _gibbets_, several sorts of _chains_\nand _punishments_, _dilaceration_ of _members_, _stigmatizing_, and\n_wild beasts_, with other exquisite inventions of torture; and yet, at\nlast the cruelty itself is more horrid and odious than the means by\nwhich it works. It is a bestial madness to _love_ mischief; beside,\nthat it is _womanish_ to _rage_ and _tear_. A generous beast will scorn\nto do it when he has any thing at his mercy. It is a vice for wolves\nand tigers, and no less _abominable_ to the _world_ than _dangerous_ to\nitself.\nThe Romans had their _morning_ and their _meridian spectacles_. In\nthe _former_, they had their combats of _men_ with _wild beasts_; and\nin the _latter_, the _men_ fought _one with another_. \u201cI went,\u201d says\nour author, \u201cthe other day to the _meridian spectacles_, in hope of\nmeeting somewhat of mirth and diversion to sweeten the humors of those\nthat had been entertained with blood in the _morning_; but it proved\notherwise, for, compared with this inhumanity, the former was a mercy.\nThe whole business was only murder upon murder: the combatants fought\nnaked, and every blow was a wound. They do not contend for _victory_,\nbut for _death_; and he that kills one man is to be killed by another.\nBy wounds they are forced upon wounds which they take and give upon\ntheir bare _breasts. Burn that rogue_, they cry _What! Is he afraid\nof his flesh? Do but see how sneakingly that rascal dies._ Look to\nyourselves, my masters, and consider of it: who knows but this may come\nto be your own case?\u201d Wicked examples seldom fail of coming home at\nlast to the authors. To destroy a _single_ man may be dangerous; but\nto murder whole nations is only a more _glorious wickedness. Private\navarice_ and _rigor_ are condemned, but _oppression_, when it comes to\nbe _authorized_ by an act of state, and to be publicly _commanded_,\nthough particularly forbidden, becomes a point of _dignity_ and\n_honor_. What a shame is it for men to interworry one another, when\nyet the fiercest even of beasts are at peace with those of their own\nkind? This brutal fury puts philosophy itself to a stand. The drunkard,\nthe glutton, the covetous, may be reduced; nay, and the mischief of\nit is that no vice keeps itself within its proper bounds. Luxury runs\ninto avarice, and when the reverence of virtue is extinguished, men\nwill stick at nothing that carries profit along with it; man\u2019s blood is\nshed in wantonness\u2014his death is a spectacle for entertainment, and his\ngroans are music. When Alexander delivered up Lysimachus to a lion, how\nglad would he have been to have had nails and teeth to have devoured\nhim himself: it would have too much derogated, he thought, from the\ndignity of his wrath, to have appointed a _man_ for the execution of\nhis friend. Private cruelties, it is true, cannot do much mischief, but\nin princes they are a war against mankind.\nC. C\u00e6sar would commonly, for _exercise_ and _pleasure_, put _senators_\nand _Roman knights_ to the _torture_; and _whip_ several of them like\n_slaves_, or put them to _death_ with the most acute _torments_,\nmerely for the satisfaction of his _cruelty_. That C\u00e6sar that \u201cwished\nthe people of Rome had but one neck, that he might cut it off at one\nblow;\u201d\u2014it was the employment, the study, and the joy of his life. He\nwould not so much as give the expiring leave to groan, but caused their\nmouths to be stopped with sponges, or for want of them, with rags of\ntheir own clothes, that they might not breathe out so much as their\nlast agonies at liberty; or, perhaps, lest the tormented should speak\nsomething which the tormentor had no mind to hear. Nay, he was so\nimpatient of delay, that he would frequently rise from supper to have\nmen killed by _torch-light_, as if his life and death had depended\nupon their dispatch before the next morning; to say nothing how many\n_fathers_ were put to death in the same night with their _sons_ (which\nwas a kind of mercy in the prevention of their mourning). And was not\nSylla\u2019s cruelty prodigious too, which was only stopped for want of\nenemies? He caused seven thousand _citizens_ of Rome to be slaughtered\nat once; and some of the senators being startled at their cries that\nwere heard in the _senate-house_, \u201cLet us mind our business,\u201d says\nSylla; \u201cthis is nothing but a few mutineers that I have ordered to be\nsent out of the way.\u201d A _glorious spectacle_! says Hannibal, when he\nsaw the trenches flowing with human blood; and if the rivers had run\nblood too, he would have liked it so much the better.\nAmong the famous and detestable speeches that are committed to memory,\nI know none worse than that impudent and _tyrannical maxim_, \u201cLet them\nhate me, so they fear me;\u201d not considering that those that are kept\nin obedience by fear, are both malicious and mercenary, and only wait\nfor an opportunity to change their master. Beside that, whosoever is\nterrible to others is likewise afraid of himself. What is more ordinary\nthan for a tyrant to be destroyed by his own guards? which is no more\nthan the putting those crimes into practice which they learned of\ntheir masters. How many slaves have revenged themselves of their cruel\noppressors, though they were sure to die for it! but when it comes\nonce to a _popular tyranny_, whole nations conspire against it. For\n\u201cwhosoever threatens all, is in danger of all,\u201d over and above, that\nthe cruelty of the prince increases the _number_ of his enemies, by\ndestroying some of them; for it entails an hereditary hatred upon the\nfriends and relations of those that are taken away. And then it has\nthis misfortune, that a man must be wicked upon necessity; for there\nis no going back; so that he must betake himself to arms, and yet he\nlives in fear. He can neither trust to the faith of his friends, nor\nto the piety of his children; he both dreads death and wishes it; and\nbecomes a greater terror to himself than he is to his people. Nay, if\nthere were nothing else to make cruelty detestable, it were enough that\nit passes all bounds, both of custom and humanity; and is followed upon\nthe heel with sword or poison. A private malice indeed does not move\nwhole cities; but that which extends to all is every body\u2019s mark. One\nsick person gives no great disturbance in a family; but when it comes\nto a depopulating plague, all people fly from it. And why should a\nprince expect any man to be good whom he has taught to be wicked?\nBut what if it were _safe_ to be _cruel_? Were it not still a sad\nthing, the very state of such a _government_? A _government_ that\nbears the image of a _taken city_, where there is nothing but\n_sorrow_, _trouble_, and _confusion_. Men dare not so much as trust\nthemselves with their friends or with their pleasures. There is not any\nentertainment so innocent but it affords pretence of crime and danger.\nPeople are betrayed at their _tables_ and in their _cups_, and drawn\nfrom the very _theatre_ to the _prison_. How horrid a madness is it\nto be still _raging_ and _killing_; to have the rattling of _chains_\nalways in our _ears; bloody spectacles_ before our _eyes_; and to carry\n_terror_ and _dismay_ wherever we go! If we had _lions_ and _serpents_,\nto rule over us, this would be the manner of their _government_,\nsaving that they agree better among themselves. It passes for a mark\nof greatness to burn cities, and lay whole kingdoms waste; nor is it\nfor the honor of a prince, to appoint this or that single man to be\nkilled, unless they have whole _troops_, or (sometimes) _legions_, to\nwork upon. But it is not the spoils of _war_ and _bloody trophies_ that\nmake a prince _glorious_, but the _divine power_ of preserving _unity_\nand _peace. Ruin_ without _distinction_ is more properly the business\nof a general _deluge_, or a _conflagration_. Neither does a fierce\nand inexorable _anger_ become the _supreme magistrate_; \u201cGreatness of\nmind is always meek and humble; but cruelty is a note and an effect of\nweakness, and brings down a governor to the level of a competitor.\u201d\nSENECA OF CLEMENCY.\nThe humanity and excellence of this virtue is confessed at all hands,\nas well by the men of _pleasure_, and those that think every man was\nmade for himself, as by the Stoics, that make \u201cman a sociable creature,\nand born for the common good of mankind:\u201d for it is of all dispositions\nthe most _peaceable_ and _quiet_. But before we enter any farther upon\nthe discourse, it should be first known what _clemency_ is, that we may\ndistinguish it from _pity_; which is a _weakness_, though many times\nmistaken for a _virtue_: and the next thing will be, to bring the mind\nto the _habit_ and _exercise_ of it.\n\u201cClemency is a favorable disposition of the mind, in the matter of\ninflicting punishment; or, a moderation that remits somewhat of the\npenalty incurred; as _pardon_ is the total remission of a deserved\npunishment.\u201d We must be careful not to confound _clemency_ with\n_pity_; for as _religion worships_ God, and _superstition profanes_\nthat worship; so should we distinguish betwixt _clemency_ and _pity_;\n_practicing_ the _one_, and _avoiding_ the _other_. For _pity_ proceeds\nfrom a _narrowness of mind_, that respects rather the _fortune_ than\nthe _cause_. It is a kind of moral sickness, contracted from other\npeople\u2019s misfortune: such another weakness as laughing or yawning for\ncompany, or as that of sick eyes that cannot look upon others that are\nbleared without dropping themselves. I will give a shipwrecked man a\nplank, a lodging to a stranger, or a piece of money to him that wants\nit: I will dry up the tears of my friend, yet I will not weep with him,\nbut treat him with constancy and humanity, as _one man_ ought to treat\n_another_.\nIt is objected by some, that _clemency_ is an insignificant virtue; and\nthat only the bad are the better for it, for the good have no need of\nit. But in the first place, as physic is in use only among the sick,\nand yet in honor with the sound, so the innocent have a reverence\nfor clemency, though criminals are properly the objects of it. And\nthen again, a man may be innocent, and yet have occasion for it too;\nfor by the accidents of fortune, or the condition of times, virtue\nitself may come to be in danger. Consider the most populous city or\nnation; what a solitude would it be if none should be left there but\nthose that could stand the test of a severe justice! We should have\nneither judges nor accusers; none either to grant a pardon or to ask\nit. More or less, we are all sinners; and he that has best purged his\nconscience, was brought by errors to repentance. And it is farther\nprofitable to mankind; for many delinquents come to be converted. There\nis a tenderness to be used even toward our slaves, and those that we\nhave bought with our money: how much more then to free and to honest\nmen, that are rather under our protection than dominion! Not that I\nwould have it so general neither as not to distinguish betwixt the good\nand the bad; for that would introduce a confusion, and give a kind of\nencouragement to wickedness. It must therefore have a respect to the\nquality of the offender, and separate the curable from the desperate;\nfor it is an equal cruelty to pardon all and to pardon none. Where\nthe matter is in balance, let mercy turn the scale: if all wicked men\nshould be punished, who should escape?\nThough mercy and gentleness of nature keeps all in peace and\ntranquillity, even in a _cottage_; yet it is much more beneficial\nand conspicuous in a _palace. Private men_ in their _condition_ are\nlikewise _private_ in their _virtues_ and in their _vices_; but the\nwords and the actions of _princes_ are the subject of _public rumor_;\nand therefore they had need have a care, what occasion they give\npeople for discourse, of whom people will be always a talking. There\nis the _government_ of a _prince_ over his _people_, a _father_ over\nhis _children_, a _master_ over his _scholars_, an _officer_ over his\n_soldiers_. He is an unnatural father, that for every trifle beats his\nchildren. Who is the better master, he that rages over his scholars for\nbut missing a word in a lesson, or he that tries, by admonition and\nfair words, to instruct and reform them? An outrageous officer makes\nhis men run from their colors. A skilful rider brings his horse to\nobedience by mingling fair means with foul; whereas to be perpetually\nswitching and spurring, makes him vicious and jadish: and shall we\nnot have more care of _men_ than of _beasts_? It breaks the hope of\ngenerous inclinations, when they are depressed by servility and terror.\nThere is no creature so hard to be pleased with ill usage as man.\nClemency does _well_ with _all_ but _best_ with _princes_; for it makes\ntheir power comfortable and beneficial, which would otherwise be the\npest of mankind. It establishes their greatness, when they make the\ngood of the public their particular care, and employ their power for\nthe safety of the people. The prince, in effect, is but the soul of the\ncommunity, as the community is only the body of the prince; so that\nbeing merciful to others, he is tender of himself: nor is any man so\nmean but his master feels the loss of him, as a part of his empire: and\nhe takes care not only of the lives of his people, but also of their\nreputation. Now, giving for granted that all virtues are in themselves\nequal, it will not yet be denied, that they may be more beneficial to\nmankind in one person than in another. A beggar may be as magnanimous\nas a king: for what can be greater or braver than to baffle ill\nfortune? This does not hinder but that a man in authority and plenty\nhas more matter for his generosity to work upon than a private person;\nand it is also more taken notice of upon the bench than upon the level.\nWhen a gracious prince shows himself to his people, they do not fly\nfrom him as from a tiger that rouses himself out of his den, but they\nworship him as a benevolent influence; they secure him against all\nconspiracies, and interpose their bodies betwixt him and danger. They\nguard him while he sleeps, and defend him in the field against his\nenemies. Nor is it without reason, this unanimous agreement in love and\nloyalty, and this heroical zeal of abandoning themselves for the safety\nof their prince; but it is as well the interest of the people. In the\nbreath of a prince there is life and death; and his sentence stands\ngood, right or wrong. If he be angry, nobody dares advise him; and if\nhe does amiss, who shall call him to account? Now, for him that has so\nmuch mischief in his power, and yet applies that power to the common\nutility and comfort of his people, diffusing also clemency and goodness\ninto their hearts too, what can be a greater blessing to mankind than\nsuch a prince? _Any man_ may _kill_ another _against_ the law, but only\na _prince_ can _save_ him so. Let him so deal with his own subjects as\nhe desires God should deal with him. If Heaven should be inexorable to\nsinners, and destroy all without mercy, what flesh could be safe?\nBut as the faults of great men are not presently punished with thunder\nfrom above, let them have a like regard to their inferiors here upon\nearth. He that has revenge in his power, and does not use it, is the\ngreat man. Which is the more beautiful and agreeable state, that of\na calm, a temperate, and a clear day; or that of lightning, thunder,\nand tempests? and this is the very difference betwixt a moderate and\nturbulent government. It is for low and vulgar spirits to brawl, storm,\nand transport themselves: but it is not for the majesty of a prince to\nlash out into intemperance of words. Some will think it rather slavery\nthan empire to be debarred liberty of speech: and what if it be, when\ngovernment itself is but a more illustrious servitude?\nHe that uses his power as he should, takes as much delight in making\nit comfortable to his people as glorious to himself. He is affable\nand easy of access; his very countenance makes him the joy of his\npeople\u2019s eyes, and the delight of mankind. He is beloved, defended,\nand reverenced by all his subjects; and men speak as well of him in\nprivate as in public. He is safe without guards, and the sword is\nrather his ornament than his defence. In his duty, he is like that of a\ngood father, that sometimes gently reproves a son, sometimes threatens\nhim; nay, and perhaps corrects him: but no father in his right wits\nwill disinherit a son for the first fault; there must be many and great\noffences, and only desperate consequences, that should bring him to\nthat decretory resolution. He will make many experiments to try if he\ncan reclaim him first, and nothing but the utmost despair must put him\nupon extremities.\nIt is not flattery that calls a prince _the father of his country_;\nthe titles of _great_ and _august_ are matter of compliment and of\nhonor; but in calling him _father_, we mind him of that moderation and\nindulgence which he owes to his children. His subjects are his members;\nwhere, if there must be an amputation, let him come slowly to it; and\nwhen the part is cut off, let him wish it were on again: let him grieve\nin the doing of it. He that passes a sentence _hastily_, looks as if he\ndid it _willingly_; and then there is an injustice in the excess.\nIt is a glorious contemplation for a prince, first to consider the\nvast multitudes of his people, whose seditious, divided, and impotent\npassions, would cast all in confusion, and destroy themselves, and\npublic order too, if the hand of government did not restrain them;\nand thence to pass the examination of his conscience, saying thus to\nhimself, \u201cIt is by the choice of Providence that I am here made God\u2019s\ndeputy upon earth, the arbitrator of life and death; and that upon\nmy breath depends the fortune of my people. My lips are the oracles\nof their fate, and upon them hangs the destiny both of cities and of\nmen. It is under my favor that people seek either for prosperity or\nprotection: thousands of swords are drawn or sheathed at my pleasure.\nWhat towns shall be advanced or destroyed; who shall be slaves, or who\nfree, depends upon my will; and yet, in this arbitrary power of acting\nwithout control, I was never transported to do any cruel thing, either\nby anger or hot blood in myself or by the contumacy, rashness, or\nprovocations of other men; though sufficient to turn mercy itself into\nfury. I was never moved by the odious vanity of making myself terrible\nby my power, (that accursed, though common humor of ostentation and\nglory that haunts imperious natures.) My sword has not only been buried\nin the scabbard, but in a manner bound to the peace, and tender even\nof the cheapest blood: and where I find no other motive to compassion,\nhumanity itself is sufficient. I have been always slow to severity, and\nprone to forgive; and under as strict a guard to observe the laws as if\nI were accountable for the breaking of them. Some I pardoned for their\nyouth, others for their age. I spare one man for his dignity, another\nfor his humility; and when I find no other matter to work upon, I spare\nmyself. So that if God should at this instant call me to an account,\nthe whole world agree to witness for me, that I have not by any force,\neither public or private, either by myself or by any other, defrauded\nthe commonwealth; and the reputation that I have ever sought for has\nbeen that which few princes have obtained, the conscience of my proper\ninnocence. And I have not lost my labor neither; for no man was ever so\ndear to another, as I have made myself to the whole body of my people.\u201d\nUnder such a prince the subjects have nothing to wish for beyond what\nthey enjoy; their fears are quieted, and their prayers heard, and\nthere is nothing can make their felicity greater, unless to make it\nperpetual; and there is no liberty denied to the people but that of\ndestroying one another.\nIt is the interest of the people, by the consent of all nations, to run\nall hazards for the safety of their prince, and by a thousand deaths to\nredeem that one life, upon which so many millions depend. Does not the\nwhole body serve the mind, though only the one is exposed to the eye\nand the other not, but thin and invisible, the very seat of it being\nuncertain? Yet the hands, feet, and eyes, observe the motions of it. We\nlie down, run about and ramble, as that commands us. If we be covetous,\nwe fish the seas and ransack the earth for treasure: if ambitious, we\nburn our own flesh with Sc\u00e6vola; we cast ourselves into the gulf with\nCurtius: so would that vast multitude of people, which is animated but\nwith one soul, governed by one spirit, and moved by one reason, destroy\nitself with its own strength, if it were not supported by wisdom and\ngovernment. Wherefore, it is for their own security that the people\nexpose their lives for their prince, as the very bond that ties the\nrepublic together; the vital spirit of so many thousands, which would\nbe nothing else but a burden and prey without a governor.\nWhen this union comes once to be dissolved, all falls to pieces; for\nempire and obedience must stand and fall together. It is no wonder then\nif a prince be dear to his people, when the community is wrapt up in\nhim, and the good of both as inseparable as the body and the head; the\none for strength, and the other for counsel; for what signifies the\nforce of the body without the direction of the understanding? While the\nprince watches, his people sleep; his labor keeps them at ease, and\nhis business keeps them quiet. The natural intent of monarchy appears\neven from the very discipline of bees: they assign to their master the\nfairest lodgings, the safest place; and his office is only to see that\nthe rest perform their duties. When their king is lost, the whole swarm\ndissolve: more than one they will not admit; and then they contend who\nshall have the best. They are of all creatures the fiercest for their\nbigness; and leave their stings behind them in their quarrels; only\nthe king himself has none, intimating that kings should neither be\nvindictive nor cruel.\nIs it not a shame, after such an example of moderation in these\ncreatures, that men should be yet intemperate? It were well if they\nlost their stings too in their revenge, as well as the other, that they\nmight hurt but once, and do no mischief by their proxies. It would tire\nthem out, if either they were to execute all with their own hands, or\nto wound others at the peril of their own lives.\nA prince should behave himself generously in the power which God has\ngiven him of life and death, especially towards those that have been\nat any time his equals; for the one has his revenge, and the other his\npunishment in it. He that stands indebted for his life has lost it;\nbut he that receives his life at the foot of his enemy, lives to the\nhonor of his preserver: he lives the lasting monument of his virtue;\nwhereas, if he had been led in triumph, the spectacle would have been\nquickly over. Or what if he should restore him to his kingdom again?\nwould it not be an ample accession to his honor to show that he found\nnothing about the conquered that was worthy of the conqueror? There is\nnothing more venerable than a prince that does not revenge an injury.\nHe that is gracious is beloved and reverenced as a common father; but a\ntyrant stands in fear and in danger even of his own guards. No prince\ncan be safe himself of whom all others are afraid; for to spare none\nis to enrage all. It is an error to imagine that any man can be secure\nthat suffers nobody else to be so too. How can any man endure to lead\nan uneasy, suspicious, anxious life, when he may be safe if he please,\nand enjoy all the blessings of power, together with the prayers of\nhis people? Clemency protects a prince without a guard; there is no\nneed of troops, castles, or fortifications: security on the one side\nis the condition of security on the other; and the affections of the\nsubject are the most invincible fortress. What can be fairer, than for\na prince to live the object of his people\u2019s love; to have the vows of\ntheir heart as well as of their lips, and his health and sickness their\ncommon hopes and fears? There will be no danger of plots; nay, on the\ncontrary, who would not frankly venture his blood to save him, under\nwhose government, justice, peace, modesty, and dignity flourish? under\nwhose influence men grow rich and happy; and whom men look upon with\nsuch veneration, as they would do upon the immortal gods, if they were\ncapable of seeing them? And as the true representative of the ALMIGHTY\nthey consider him, when he is gracious and bountiful, and employs his\npower to the advantage of his subjects.\nWhen a prince proceeds to punishment, it must be either to vindicate\nhimself or others. It is a hard matter to govern himself in his own\ncase. If a man should advise him not to be credulous, but to examine\nmatters, and indulge the innocent, this is rather a point of justice\nthan of clemency: but in case that he be manifestly injured, I would\nhave him _forgive_, where he may _safely_ do it: and be _tender_ even\nwhere he cannot _forgive_; but far more exorable in his own case,\nhowever, than in another\u2019s.\nIt is nothing to be free of another man\u2019s purse, and it is as little to\nbe merciful in another man\u2019s cause. He is the great man that masters\nhis passion where he is stung himself, and pardons when he might\ndestroy. The end of punishment is either to comfort the party injured,\nor to secure him for the future. A prince\u2019s fortune is above the need\nof such a comfort, and his power is too eminent to seek an advance of\nreputation by doing a private man a mischief. This I speak in case of\nan affront from those that are below us; but he that of an equal has\nmade any man his inferior, has his revenge in the bringing of him down.\nA _prince_ has been _killed_ by a _servant_, destroyed by a serpent:\nbut whosoever preserves a man must be greater than the person that he\npreserves. With citizens, strangers, and people of low condition, a\nprince is not to contend, for they are beneath him: he may spare some\nout of good will, and others as he would do some little creatures that\na man cannot touch without fouling his fingers: but for those that\nare to be pardoned or exposed to public punishment, he may use mercy\nas he sees occasion; and a generous mind can never want inducements\nand motives to it; and whether it be _age_ or _sex_, _high_ or _low_,\nnothing comes amiss.\nTo pass now to the vindication of others, there must be had a regard\neither to the amendment of the person punished, or the making others\nbetter for fear of punishment, or the taking the offender out of the\nway for the security of others. An amendment may be procured by a\nsmall punishment, for he lives more carefully that has something yet\nto lose\u2014it is a kind of _impunity_ to be incapable of a _farther\npunishment_. The corruptions of a city are best cured by a few and\nsparing severities; for the multitude of offenders creates a custom of\noffending, and company authorizes a crime, and there is more good to\nbe done upon a _dissolute age_ by _patience_ than by _rigor_; provided\nthat it pass not for an _approbation_ of _ill-manners_, but only as an\n_unwillingness_ to proceed to _extremities_. Under a merciful prince, a\nman will be ashamed to offend, because a punishment that is inflicted\nby a gentle governor seems to fall heavier and with more reproach:\nand it is remarkable also, that \u201cthose sins are often committed which\nare very often punished.\u201d Caligula, in five years, condemned more\npeople to the _sack_ than ever were before him: and there were \u201cfewer\nparricides before the law against them than after;\u201d for our ancestors\ndid wisely presume that the crime would never be committed, until by\nlaw for punishing it, they found that it might be done. _Parricides_\nbegan with the _law_ against them, and the punishment instructed men in\nthe crime. Where there are few punishments, innocency is indulged as a\npublic good, and it is a dangerous thing to show a city how strong it\nis in delinquents. There is a certain contumacy in the nature of man\nthat makes him oppose difficulties. We are better to follow than to\ndrive; as a generous horse rides best with an easy bit. People _obey\nwillingly_ where they are _commanded kindly_.\nWhen Burrhus the prefect was to sentence two malefactors, he brought\nthe warrant to Nero to sign; who, after a long reluctancy came to it at\nlast with this exclamation: \u201cI would I could not write!\u201d A speech that\ndeserved the whole world for an auditory, but all princes especially;\nand that the hearts of all the subjects would conform to the likeness\nof their masters. As the head is well or ill, so is the mind dull or\nmerry. What is the difference betwixt a _king_ and a _tyrant_, but a\n_diversity_ of _will_ under one and the _same power_. The one destroys\nfor his pleasure, the other upon necessity; a distinction rather in\nfact than in name.\nA gracious prince is armed as well as a tyrant; but it is for the\ndefence of his people and not for the ruin of them. No king can ever\nhave faithful servants that accustoms them to tortures and executions;\nthe very guilty themselves do not lead so anxious a life as the\npersecutors: for they are not only afraid of justice, both divine and\nhuman, but it is dangerous for them to mend their manners; so that\nwhen they are once in, they must continue to be wicked upon necessity.\nAn universal hatred unites in a popular rage. A temperate fear may\nbe kept in order; but when it comes once to be continual and sharp,\nit provokes people to extremities, and transports them to desperate\nresolutions, as wild beasts when they are pressed upon the _toil_,\nturn back and assault the very pursuers. A turbulent government is a\nperpetual trouble both to prince and people; and he that is a terror\nto all others is not without terror also himself. Frequent punishments\nand revenges may suppress the hatred of a few, but then it stirs up the\ndetestation of all, so that there is no destroying one enemy without\nmaking many. It is good to master the _will_ of being _cruel_, even\nwhile there may be cause for it, and matter to work upon.\nAugustus was a gracious prince when he had the power in his own hand;\nbut in the _triumviracy_ he made use of his sword, and had his friends\nready armed to set upon Antony during that dispute. But he behaved\nhimself afterwards at another rate; for when he was betwixt forty and\nfifty years of age he was told that Cinna was in a plot to murder him,\nwith the time, place and manner of the design; and this from one of\nthe confederates. Upon this he resolved upon a revenge, and sent for\nseveral of his friends to advise upon it. The thought of it kept him\nwaking, to consider, that there was the life of a young nobleman in the\ncase, the nephew of Pompey, and a person otherwise innocent. He was\noff and on several times whether he should put him to death or not.\n\u201cWhat!\u201d says he, \u201cshall I live in trouble and in danger myself, and the\ncontriver of my death walk free and secure? Will nothing serve him but\nthat life which Providence has preserved in so many civil wars\u2014in so\nmany battles both by sea and land; and now in the state of an universal\npeace too\u2014and not a simple murder either, but a sacrifice; for I am\nto be assaulted at the very altar\u2014and shall the contriver of all this\nvillainy escape unpunished?\u201d Here Augustus made a little pause, and\nthen recollecting himself: \u201cNo, no, C\u00e6sar,\u201d says he, \u201cit is rather\nC\u00e6sar than Cinna that I am to be angry with: why do I myself live any\nlonger after that my death is become the interest of so many people?\nAnd if I go on, what end will there be of blood and of punishment?\nIf it be against my life that the nobility arm itself, and level its\nweapons, my single life is not worth the while, if so many must be\ndestroyed that I may be preserved.\u201d\nHis wife Livia gave him here an interruption, and desired him that\nhe would for once hear a woman\u2019s counsel. \u201cDo,\u201d says she, \u201clike a\nphysician, that when common remedies fail, will try the contrary: you\nhave got nothing hitherto by severity\u2014after Salvidianus there followed\nLepidus\u2014after him Mur\u00e6na\u2014C\u00e6pio followed him, and Egnatius followed\nC\u00e6pio\u2014try now what mercy will do\u2014forgive Cinna. He is discovered,\nand can do no hurt to your person; and it will yet advantage you in\nyour reputation.\u201d Augustus was glad of the advice, and he gave thanks\nfor it; and thereupon countermanded the meeting of his friends, and\nordered Cinna to be brought to him alone; for whom he caused a chair\nto be set, and then discharged the rest of the company. \u201cCinna,\u201d says\nAugustus, \u201c_before I go any farther_, you must promise not to give me\nthe interruption of one syllable until I have told you all I have to\nsay, and you shall have liberty afterwards to say what you please. You\ncannot forget, that when I found you in arms against me, and not only\nmade my _enemy_, but _born_ so, I gave you your life and fortune. Upon\nyour petition for the priesthood, I granted it, with a repulse to the\nsons of those that had been my fellow-soldiers; and you are at this\nday so happy and so rich, that even the conquerors envy him that is\novercome; and yet after all this, you are in a plot, Cinna, to murder\nme.\u201d At that word Cinna started, and interposed with exclamations,\n\u201cthat certainly he was far from being either so wicked or so mad.\u201d\n\u201cThis is a breach of conditions, Cinna,\u201d says Augustus, \u201cit is not your\ntime to speak yet: I tell you again, that you are in a plot to murder\nme;\u201d and so he told him the time, the place, the confederates, the\norder and manner of the design, and who it was that was to do the deed.\nCinna, upon this, fixed his eye upon the ground without any reply:\nnot for his word\u2019s sake, but as in a confusion of conscience: and so\nAugustus went on. \u201cWhat,\u201d says he, \u201cmay your design be in all this? Is\nit that you would pretend to step into my place? The commonwealth were\nin an ill condition, if only Augustus were in the way betwixt you and\nthe government. You were cast the other day in a cause by one of your\nown _freemen_, and do you expect to find a weaker adversary of C\u00e6sar?\nBut what if I were removed? There is \u00c6milius Paulus, Fabius Maximus,\nand twenty other families of great blood and interest, that would never\nbear it.\u201d To cut off the story short; (for it was a discourse of above\ntwo hours; and Augustus lengthened the punishment in _words_, since he\nintended that should be all;) \u201cWell, Cinna,\u201d says he, \u201cthe life that\nI gave to you once as an enemy, I will now repeat it to a _traitor_\nand to a _parricide_, and this shall be the last reproach I will give\nyou. For the time to come there shall be no other contention betwixt\nyou and me, than which shall outdo the other in point of friendship.\u201d\nAfter this Augustus made Cinna _consul_, (an honor which he confessed\nhe durst not so much as desire) and Cinna was ever affectionately\nfaithful to him: he made C\u00e6sar his _sole heir_; and this was the _last\nconspiracy_ that ever was formed against him.\nThis moderation of Augustus was the excellency of his mature age; for\nin his youth he was passionate and sudden; and he did many things which\nafterward he looked back upon with trouble: after the battle of Actium,\nso many navies broken in Sicily, both _Roman_ and _strangers_: the\n_Perusian altars_, where 300 _lives_ were _sacrificed_ to the _ghost_\nof Julius; his frequent _proscriptions_, and other severities; his\n_temperance_ at last seemed to be little more than a _weary cruelty_.\nIf he had not _forgiven_ those that he _conquered_, whom should\nhe have _governed_? He chose his very _life-guard_ from among his\n_enemies_, and the _flower_ of the Romans owed their _lives_ to his\n_clemency_. Nay, he only punished Lepidus himself with _banishment_,\nand permitted him to wear the _ensigns_ of his _dignity_, without\ntaking the _pontificate_ to himself so long as Lepidus was living;\nfor he would not possess it as a _spoil_, but as an _honor_. This\n_clemency_ it was that secured him in his greatness, and ingratiated\nhim to the people, though he laid his hand upon the government before\nthey had thoroughly submitted to the yoke; and this clemency it was\nthat made his _name famous_ to _posterity_. This is it that makes us\nreckon him _divine_ without the authority of an _apotheosis_. He was\nso tender and patient, that though many a bitter jest was broken upon\nhim, (and _contumelies_ upon princes are the most _intolerable_ of all\n_injuries_) yet he never punished any man upon that subject. _It is_,\nthen, generous _to be_ merciful, _when we have it in our_ power to\n_take_ revenge.\nA son of Titus Arius, being examined and found guilty of _parricide_,\nwas banished Rome, and confined to Marseilles, where his father allowed\nhim the same annuity that he had before; which made all people conclude\nhim guilty, when they saw that his father had yet _condemned_ the son\nthat he could not _hate_. Augustus was pleased to sit upon the fact in\nthe house of Arius, only as a _single member_ of the _council_ that was\nto examine it: if it had been in C\u00e6sar\u2019s palace, the judgment must have\nbeen C\u00e6sar\u2019s and not the _father\u2019s_. Upon a full hearing of the matter,\nC\u00e6sar directed that every man should write his opinion whether _guilty_\nor _not_, and without declaring of his own, for fear of a partial\nvote. Before the opening of the books, C\u00e6sar passed an oath, that he\nwould not be Arius\u2019s _heir_: and to show that he had no interest in\nhis sentence, as appeared afterward; for he was not condemned to the\nordinary _punishments_ of _parricides_, nor to a prison, but, by the\nmediation of C\u00e6sar, only banished Rome, and confined to the place which\nhis father should name; Augustus insisting upon it, that the father\nshould content himself with an easy punishment: and arguing that the\nyoung man was not moved to the attempt by _malice_, and that he was\nbut half resolved upon the fact, for he wavered in it; and, therefore,\nto remove him from the city, and from his father\u2019s sight, would be\nsufficient. This is a glorious mercy, and worthy of a prince, to make\nall things gentler wherever he comes.\nHow miserable is that man in himself, who, when he has employed his\npower in rapines and cruelty upon others, is yet more unhappy in\nhimself! He stands in fear both of his domestics and of strangers; the\nfaith of his friends and the piety of his children, and flies to actual\nviolence to secure him from the violence he fears. When he comes to\nlook about him, and to consider what he _has_ done, what he _must_,\nand what he is _about_ to do; what with the _wickedness_, and with the\n_torments_ of his _conscience_, many times he fears death, oftener he\nwishes for it; and lives more odious to himself than to his subjects;\nwhereas on the contrary, he that takes a care of the public, though of\none part more perhaps than of another, yet there is not any part of it\nbut he looks upon as part of himself. His mind is tender and gentle;\nand even where punishment is necessary and profitable, he comes to it\nunwillingly, and without any rancor or enmity in his heart. Let the\nauthority, in fine, be what it will, clemency becomes it; and the\ngreater the power, the greater is the glory of it. \u201cIt is a truly royal\nvirtue for a prince to deliver his people _from other_ men\u2019s anger, and\nnot to oppress them _with his_ own.\u201d\n*       *       *       *       *\nTranscriber's note:\nObvious typographical errors have been corrected silently.

Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg\nLiterary Archive Foundation\nProject Gutenberg\u2122 depends upon and cannot survive without widespread\npublic support and donations to carry out its mission of\nincreasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be\nfreely distributed in machine-readable form accessible by the widest\narray of equipment including outdated equipment. Many small donations\n($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt\nstatus with the IRS.\nThe Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating\ncharities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United\nStates. Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a\nconsiderable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up\nwith these requirements. We do not solicit donations in locations\nwhere we have not received written confirmation of compliance. To SEND\nDONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any particular state\nvisit www.gutenberg.org/donate.\nWhile we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we\nhave not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition\nagainst accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who\napproach us with offers to donate.\nInternational donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make\nany statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from\noutside the United States. U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.\nPlease check the Project Gutenberg web pages for current donation\nmethods and addresses. Donations are accepted in a number of other\nways including checks, online payments and credit card donations. To\ndonate, please visit: www.gutenberg.org/donate.\nSection 5. General Information About Project Gutenberg\u2122 electronic works\nProfessor Michael S. Hart was the originator of the Project\nGutenberg\u2122 concept of a library of electronic works that could be\nfreely shared with anyone. For forty years, he produced and\ndistributed Project Gutenberg\u2122 eBooks with only a loose network of\nvolunteer support.\nProject Gutenberg\u2122 eBooks are often created from several printed\neditions, all of which are confirmed as not protected by copyright in\nthe U.S. unless a copyright notice is included. Thus, we do not\nnecessarily keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper\nedition.\nMost people start at our website which has the main PG search\nfacility: www.gutenberg.org.\nThis website includes information about Project Gutenberg\u2122,\nincluding how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary\nArchive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to\nsubscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.", "source": "morals.txt"}
