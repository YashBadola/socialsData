CHAPTER I

HOW CANDIDE WAS BROUGHT UP IN A MAGNIFICENT CASTLE AND HOW HE WAS DRIVEN THENCE

In the castle of Baron Thunder-ten-tronckh in Westphalia there lived a youth, endowed by nature with the most gentle manners. His soul was portrayed by his face. He combined a true judgment with simplicity of spirit, which was the reason, I apprehend, of his being called Candide. The old servants of the house suspected him to have been the son of the Baron’s sister and of a worthy gentleman of the neighborhood, whom that lady would never marry because he had been able to prove only seventy-one quarterings, the rest of his genealogical tree having been lost through the ravages of time.

The Baron was one of the most powerful lords in Westphalia, for his castle had not only a gate, but windows. His great hall, even, was hung with tapestry. All the dogs of his farm-yards formed a pack of hounds at need; his grooms were his huntsmen; and the curate of the village was his grand almoner. They called him “My Lord,” and laughed at all his stories.

The Baroness weighed about three hundred and fifty pounds, was therefore a person of great consideration, and did the honors of the house with a dignity that commanded still greater respect. Her daughter Cunegonde, seventeen years of age, was fresh-colored, comely, plump, and desirable. The Baron’s son seemed to be in every respect worthy of his father. The Preceptor Pangloss was the oracle of the family, and little Candide listened to his instructions with all the simplicity appropriate to his age and character.

Pangloss taught metaphysico-theologo-cosmolonigology. He proved admirably that there is no effect without a cause, and that in this best of all possible worlds, the Baron’s castle was the most magnificent of all castles, and My Lady the best of all possible baronesses.

“It is demonstrable,” said he, “that things cannot be otherwise than as they are; for as all things have been created for some end, they must necessarily be created for the best end. Observe, for instance, the nose is formed for spectacles, therefore we wear spectacles. The legs are visibly designed for stockings, accordingly we wear stockings. Stones were made to be hewn and to construct castles, therefore My Lord has a magnificent castle; for the greatest baron in the province ought to be the best lodged. Swine were intended to be eaten, therefore we eat pork all the year round: and they, who assert that everything is right, do not express themselves correctly; they should say that everything is best.”

Candide listened attentively and believed innocently; for he thought Miss Cunegonde extremely beautiful, though he never had the courage to tell her so. He concluded that after the happiness of being born Baron of Thunder-ten-tronckh, the second degree of happiness was to be Miss Cunegonde, the third that of seeing her every day, and the fourth that of hearing Doctor Pangloss, the greatest philosopher of the province, and consequently of the whole world.

One day, when Cunegonde went to take a walk in a little neighboring wood which was called a park, she saw, through the bushes, the sage Doctor Pangloss giving a lecture in experimental philosophy to her mother’s chambermaid, a little brown wench, very pretty, and very tractable. As Miss Cunegonde had a great disposition for the sciences, she observed with the utmost breathlessness the experimental experiments which were repeated before her eyes; she saw clearly the sufficient reason of the doctor, the effects and the causes, and returned home very much excited, pensive, filled with the desire of learning, reflecting that she might be the sufficient reason of young Candide, and that he might be hers.

She met Candide on reaching the castle and blushed; Candide blushed also; she wished him good morrow in a faltering tone, and Candide spoke to her without knowing what he said. The next day, after dinner, as they went from table, Cunegonde and Candide found themselves behind a screen; Cunegonde dropped her handkerchief, Candide picked it up, she innocently held his hand, the young man innocently kissed the young woman’s hand with such vivacity, sensibility, and grace; their eyes met, their knees trembled, their hands strayed. The Baron Thunder-ten-tronckh passed near the screen, and beholding this cause and effect, chased Candide from the castle with great kicks on the backside; Cunegonde fainted away; when she came to herself, she was slapped on the face by the Baroness; and all was consternation in the most magnificent and most agreeable of all possible castles.
