Diapsalmata

What is a poet? An unhappy man who in his heart harbors a deep anguish, but whose lips are so fashioned that the sighs and cries which pass over them are transformed into ravishing music.

Their lusts are dull and sluggish, their passions sleepy. They do their duty, these shopkeeper-souls, but they permit themselves, like the Jews, a slight clipping of the coin...
