{"text": "LIFE OF DIOGENES.\nI. Diogenes was a native of Sinope, the son of Hicesius, a\nmoney-changer. And Diocles says that he was forced to\nflee from his native city, as his father kept the public bank\nthere, and had adulterated the coinage. But Eubulides, in his\nessay on Diogenes, says, that it was Diogenes himself who\ndid this, and that he was banished with his father. And,\nindeed, he himself, in his Pordalus, says of himself that he\nhad adulterated the public money. Others say that he was one\nof the curators, and was persuaded by the artisans employed,\nand that he went to Delphi, or else to the oracle at Delos,\nand there consulted Apollo as to whether he should do what\npeople were trying to persuade him to do; and that, as the\nGod gave him permission to do so, Diogenes, not comprehending\nthat the God meant that he might change the political\ncustoms[56] of his country if he could, adulterated the coinage;\nand being detected, was banished, as some people say, but as\nother accounts have it, took the alarm and fled away of his own\naccord. Some again, say that he adulterated the money which\nhe had received from his father; and that his father was\nthrown into prison and died there; but that Diogenes escaped\nand went to Delphi, and asked, not whether he might tamper\nwith the coinage, but what he could do to become very\ncelebrated, and that in consequence he received the oracular\nanswer which I have mentioned.\nII. And when he came to Athens he attached himself to\nAntisthenes; but as he repelled him, because he admitted no\none; he at last forced his way to him by his pertinacity. And\nonce, when he raised his stick at him, he put his head under\nit, and said, \u201cStrike, for you will not find any stick hard\nenough to drive me away as long as you continue to speak.\u201d\nAnd from this time forth he was one of his pupils; and being\nan exile, he naturally betook himself to a simple mode of life.\nIII. And when, as Theophrastus tells us, in his Megaric\nPhilosopher, he saw a mouse running about and not seeking[225]\nfor a bed, nor taking care to keep in the dark, nor looking for\nany of those things which appear enjoyable to such an animal,\nhe found a remedy for his own poverty. He was, according to\nthe account of some people, the first person who doubled up\nhis cloak out of necessity, and who slept in it; and who carried\na wallet, in which he kept his food; and who used whatever\nplace was near for all sorts of purposes, eating, and sleeping,\nand conversing in it. In reference to which habit he used to\nsay, pointing to the Colonnade of Jupiter, and to the Public\nMagazine, \u201cthat the Athenians had built him places to live\nin.\u201d Being attacked with illness, he supported himself with\na staff; and after that he carried it continually, not indeed in\nthe city, but whenever he was walking in the roads, together\nwith his wallet, as Olympiodorus, the chief man of the\nAthenians tells us; and Polyeuctus, the orator, and Lysanias,\nthe son of \u00c6schrion, tell the same story.\nWhen he had written to some one to look out and get\nready a small house for him, as he delayed to do it, he took a\ncask which he found in the Temple of Cybele, for his house,\nas he himself tells us in his letters. And during the summer\nhe used to roll himself in the warm sand, but in winter he\nwould embrace statues all covered with snow, practising himself,\non every occasion, to endure anything.\nIV. He was very violent in expressing his haughty disdain\nof others. He said that the \u03c3\u03c7\u03bf\u03bb\u1f74 (school) of Euclides was\n\u03c7\u03bf\u03bb\u1f74 (gall). And he used to call Plato\u2019s \u03b4\u03b9\u03b1\u03c4\u03c1\u03b9\u03b2\u1f74 (discussions)\n\u03ba\u03b1\u03c4\u03b1\u03c4\u03c1\u03b9\u03b2\u1f74 (disguise). It was also a saying of his that the\nDionysian games were a great marvel to fools; and that the\ndemagogues were the ministers of the multitude. He used\nlikewise to say, \u201cthat when in the course of his life he beheld\npilots, and physicians, and philosophers, he thought man the\nwisest of all animals; but when again he beheld interpreters\nof dreams, and soothsayers, and those who listened to them,\nand men puffed up with glory or riches, then he thought\nthat there was not a more foolish animal than man.\u201d Another\nof his sayings was, \u201cthat he thought a man ought oftener to\nprovide himself with a reason than with a halter.\u201d On one\noccasion, when he noticed Plato at a very costly entertainment\ntasting some olives, he said, \u201cO you wise man! why, after\nhaving sailed to Sicily for the sake of such a feast, do you not\nnow enjoy what you have before you?\u201d And Plato replied,[226]\n\u201cBy the Gods, Diogenes, while I was there I ate olives and\nall such things a great deal.\u201d Diogenes rejoined, \u201cWhat then\ndid you want to sail to Syracuse for? Did not Attica at that\ntime produce any olives?\u201d But Phavorinus, in his Universal\nHistory, tells this story of Aristippus. At another time he\nwas eating dried figs, when Plato met him, and he said to him,\n\u201cYou may have a share of these;\u201d and as he took some and\nate them, he said, \u201cI said that you might have a share of\nthem, not that you might eat them all.\u201d On one occasion\nPlato had invited some friends who had come to him from\nDionysius to a banquet, and Diogenes trampled on his carpets,\nand said, \u201cThus I trample on the empty pride of Plato;\u201d\nand Plato made him answer, \u201cHow much arrogance are you\ndisplaying, O Diogenes! when you think that you are not\narrogant at all.\u201d But, as others tell the story, Diogenes said,\n\u201cThus I trample on the pride of Plato;\u201d and that Plato\nrejoined, \u201cWith quite as much pride yourself, O Diogenes.\u201d\nSotion too, in his fourth book, states, that the Cynic made the\nfollowing speech to Plato: Diogenes once asked him for some\nwine, and then for some dried figs; so he sent him an entire\njar full; and Diogenes said to him, \u201cWill you, if you are\nasked how many two and two make, answer twenty? In this\nway, you neither give with any reference to what you are asked\nfor, nor do you answer with reference to the question put to\nyou.\u201d He used also to ridicule him as an interminable talker.\nWhen he was asked where in Greece he saw virtuous men;\n\u201cMen,\u201d said he, \u201cnowhere; but I see good boys in Laced\u00e6mon.\u201d\nOn one occasion, when no one came to listen to him\nwhile he was discoursing seriously, he began to whistle. And\nthen when people flocked round him, he reproached them for\ncoming with eagerness to folly, but being lazy and indifferent\nabout good things. One of his frequent sayings was,\n\u201cThat men contended with one another in punching and\nkicking, but that no one showed any emulation in the\npursuit of virtue.\u201d He used to express his astonishment at the\ngrammarians for being desirous to learn everything about the\nmisfortunes of Ulysses, and being ignorant of their own. He\nused also to say, \u201cThat the musicians fitted the strings to the\nlyre properly, but left all the habits of their soul ill-arranged.\u201d\nAnd, \u201cThat mathematicians kept their eyes fixed on the sun\nand moon, and overlooked what was under their feet.\u201d \u201cThat[227]\norators were anxious to speak justly, but not at all about\nacting so.\u201d Also, \u201cThat misers blamed money, but were\npreposterously fond of it.\u201d He often condemned those who\npraise the just for being superior to money, but who at the\nsame time are eager themselves for great riches. He was also\nvery indignant at seeing men sacrifice to the Gods to procure\ngood health, and yet at the sacrifice eating in a manner\ninjurious to health. He often expressed his surprise at slaves,\nwho, seeing their masters eating in a gluttonous manner, still\ndo not themselves lay hands on any of the eatables. He\nwould frequently praise those who were about to marry, and\nyet did not marry; or who were about to take a voyage, and\nyet did not take a voyage; or who were about to engage in\naffairs of state, and did not do so; and those who were\nabout to rear children, yet did not rear any; and those who\nwere preparing to take up their abode with princes, and\nyet did not take it up. One of his sayings was, \u201cThat one\nought to hold out one\u2019s hand to a friend without closing the\nfingers.\u201d\nHermippus, in his Sale of Diogenes, says that he was\ntaken prisoner and put up to be sold, and asked what he\ncould do; and he answered, \u201cGovern men.\u201d And so he\nbade the crier \u201cgive notice that if any one wants to purchase\na master, there is one here for him.\u201d When he was ordered\nnot to sit down; \u201cIt makes no difference,\u201d said he, \u201cfor fish\nare sold, be where they may.\u201d He used to say, that he\nwondered at men always ringing a dish or jar before buying\nit, but being content to judge of a man by his look alone.\nWhen Xeniades bought him, he said to him that he ought to\nobey him even though he was his slave; for that a physician\nor a pilot would find men to obey them even though they\nmight be slaves.\nV. And Eubulus says, in his essay entitled, The Sale of\nDiogenes, that he taught the children of Xeniades, after\ntheir other lessons, to ride, and shoot, and sling, and dart. And\nthen in the Gymnasium he did not permit the trainer to exercise\nthem after the fashion of athletes, but exercised them himself\nto just the degree sufficient to give them a good colour and\ngood health. And the boys retained in their memory many\nsentences of poets and prose writers, and of Diogenes himself;\nand he used to give them a concise statement of everything[228]\nin order to strengthen their memory; and at home he used to\nteach them to wait upon themselves, contenting themselves\nwith plain food, and drinking water. And he accustomed\nthem to cut their hair close, and to eschew ornament, and to\ngo without tunics or shoes, and to keep silent, looking at\nnothing except themselves as they walked along. He used,\nalso to take them out hunting; and they paid the greatest\nattention and respect to Diogenes himself, and spoke well of\nhim to their parents.\nVI. And the same author affirms, that he grew old in the\nhousehold of Xeniades, and that when he died he was buried\nby his sons. And that while he was living with him,\nXeniades once asked him how he should bury him; and he\nsaid, \u201cOn my face;\u201d and when he was asked why, he said,\n\u201cBecause, in a little while, everything will be turned upside\ndown.\u201d And he said this because the Macedonians were\nalready attaining power, and becoming a mighty people from\nhaving been very inconsiderable. Once, when a man had\nconducted him into a magnificent house, and had told him\nthat he must not spit, after hawking a little, he spit in his\nface, saying that he could not find a worse place. But some\ntell this story of Aristippus. Once, he called out, \u201cHolloa,\nmen.\u201d And when some people gathered round him in consequence,\nhe drove them away with his stick, saying, \u201cI called\nmen, and not dregs.\u201d This anecdote I have derived from\nHecaton, in the first book of his Apophthegms. They also\nrelate that Alexander said that if he had not been Alexander,\nhe should have liked to be Diogenes. He used to call\n\u1f00\u03bd\u03ac\u03c0\u03b7\u03c1\u03bf\u03b9 (cripples), not those who were dumb and blind, but\nthose who had no wallet (\u03c0\u03ae\u03c1\u03b1). On one occasion he went\nhalf shaved into an entertainment of young men, as Metrocles\ntells us in his Apophthegms, and so was beaten by them. And\nafterwards he wrote the names of all those who had beaten\nhim, on a white tablet, and went about with the tablet round\nhis neck, so as to expose them to insult, as they were\ngenerally condemned and reproached for their conduct.\nHe used to say that he was the hound of those who were\npraised; but that none of those who praised them dared to\ngo out hunting with him. A man once said to him, \u201cI\nconquered men at the Pythian games:\u201d on which he said, \u201cI\nconquer men, but you only conquer slaves.\u201d When some[229]\npeople said to him, \u201cYou are an old man, and should rest for\nthe remainder of your life;\u201d \u201cWhy so?\u201d replied he, \u201csuppose\nI had run a long distance, ought I to stop when I was near\nthe end, and not rather press on?\u201d Once, when he was invited\nto a banquet, he said that he would not come: for that the\nday before no one had thanked him for coming. He used to\ngo bare foot through the snow, and to do a number of other\nthings which have been already mentioned. Once he attempted\nto eat raw meat, but he could not digest it. On one\noccasion he found Demosthenes, the orator, dining in an inn;\nand as he was slipping away, he said to him, \u201cYou will now\nbe ever so much more in an inn.\u201d[57] Once, when some strangers\nwished to see Demosthenes, he stretched out his middle\nfinger, and said, \u201cThis is the great demagogue of the Athenian\npeople.\u201d When some one had dropped a loaf, and was\nashamed to pick it up again, he, wishing to give him a lesson,\ntied a cord round the neck of a bottle and dragged it all\nthrough the Ceramicus. He used to say, that he imitated\nthe teachers of choruses, for that they spoke too loud, in order\nthat the rest might catch the proper tone. Another of his\nsayings, was that most men were within a finger\u2019s breadth of\nbeing mad. If, then, any one were to walk along, stretching\nout his middle finger, he will seem to be mad; but if he puts\nout his fore finger, he will not be thought so. Another of\nhis sayings was, that things of great value were often sold for\nnothing, and vice vers\u00e2. Accordingly, that a statue would\nfetch three thousand drachmas, and a bushel of meal only\ntwo obols; and when Xeniades had bought him, he said to\nhim, \u201cCome, do what you are ordered to.\u201d And when he\nsaid\u2014\n\u201cThe streams of sacred rivers now\nRun backwards to their source!\u201d\n\u201cSuppose,\u201d rejoined Diogenes, \u201cyou had been sick, and\nhad bought a physician, could you refuse to be guided by\nhim, and tell him\u2014\n\u201cThe streams of sacred rivers now\nRun backwards to their source?\u201d\nOnce a man came to him, and wished to study philosophy[230]\nas his pupil; and he gave him a saperda[58] and made him\nfollow him. And as he from shame threw it away and\ndeparted, he soon afterwards met him and, laughing, said to\nhim, \u201cA saperda has dissolved your friendship for me.\u201d But\nDiocles tells this story in the following manner; that when\nsome one said to him, \u201cGive me a commission, Diogenes,\u201d he\ncarried him off, and gave him a halfpenny worth of cheese to\ncarry. And as he refused to carry it, \u201cSee,\u201d said Diogenes,\n\u201ca halfpenny worth of cheese has broken off our friendship.\u201d\nOn one occasion he saw a child drinking out of its hands,\nand so he threw away the cup which belonged to his wallet,\nsaying, \u201cThat child has beaten me in simplicity.\u201d He also\nthrew away his spoon, after seeing a boy, when he had broken\nhis vessel, take up his lentils with a crust of bread. And he\nused to argue thus,\u2014\u201cEverything belongs to the gods; and\nwise men are the friends of the gods. All things are in\ncommon among friends; therefore everything belongs to wise\nmen.\u201d Once he saw a woman falling down before the Gods in\nan unbecoming attitude; he, wishing to cure her of her superstition,\nas Zoilus of Perga tells us, came up to her, and said,\n\u201cAre you not afraid, O woman, to be in such an indecent attitude,\nwhen some God may be behind you, for every place is\nfull of him?\u201d He consecrated a man to \u00c6sculapius, who was to\nrun up and beat all these who prostrated themselves with their\nfaces to the ground; and he was in the habit of saying that\nthe tragic curse had come upon him, for that he was\u2014\nHouseless and citiless, a piteous exile\nFrom his dear native land; a wandering beggar,\nScraping a pittance poor from day to day.\nAnd another of his sayings was that he opposed confidence\nto fortune, nature to law, and reason to suffering. Once,\nwhile he was sitting in the sun in the Craneum, Alexander\nwas standing by, and said to him, \u201cAsk any favour you choose\nof me.\u201d And he replied, \u201cCease to shade me from the sun.\u201d\nOn one occasion a man was reading some long passages, and\nwhen he came to the end of the book and showed that there\nwas nothing more written, \u201cBe of good cheer, my friends,\u201d\nexclaimed Diogenes, \u201cI see land.\u201d A man once proved to[231]\nhim syllogistically that he had horns, so he put his hand to\nhis forehead and said, \u201cI do not see them.\u201d And in a\nsimilar manner he replied to one who had been asserting that\nthere was no such thing as motion, by getting up and walking\naway. When a man was talking about the heavenly bodies\nand meteors, \u201cPray how many days,\u201d said he to him, \u201cis it\nsince you came down from heaven?\u201d\nA profligate eunuch had written on his house, \u201cLet no evil\nthing enter in.\u201d \u201cWhere,\u201d said Diogenes, \u201cis the master of\nthe house going?\u201d After having anointed his feet with perfume,\nhe said that the ointment from his head mounted up\nto heaven, and that from his feet up to his nose. When the\nAthenians entreated him to be initiated in the Eleusinian\nmysteries, and said that in the shades below the initiated had\nthe best seats; \u201cIt will,\u201d he replied, \u201cbe an absurd thing if\nAgesilaus and Epaminondas are to live in the mud, and\nsome miserable wretches, who have been initiated, are to be in\nthe islands of the blest.\u201d Some mice crept up to his table,\nand he said, \u201cSee, even Diogenes maintains his favourites.\u201d\nOnce, when he was leaving the bath, and a man asked him\nwhether many men were bathing, he said, \u201cNo;\u201d but when a\nnumber of people came out, he confessed that there were a\ngreat many. When Plato called him a dog, he said, \u201cUndoubtedly,\nfor I have come back to those who sold me.\u201d\nPlato defined man thus: \u201cMan is a two-footed, featherless\nanimal,\u201d and was much praised for the definition; so\nDiogenes plucked a cock and brought it into his school, and\nsaid, \u201cThis is Plato\u2019s man.\u201d On which account this addition\nwas made to the definition, \u201cWith broad flat nails.\u201d A man\nonce asked him what was the proper time for supper, and he\nmade answer, \u201cIf you are a rich man, whenever you please;\nand if you are a poor man, whenever you can.\u201d When he\nwas at Megara he saw some sheep carefully covered over with\nskins, and the children running about naked; and so he\nsaid, \u201cIt is better at Megara to be a man\u2019s ram, than his son.\u201d\nA man once struck him with a beam, and then said, \u201cTake\ncare.\u201d \u201cWhat,\u201d said he, \u201care you going to strike me\nagain?\u201d He used to say that the demagogues were the servants\nof the people; and garlands the blossoms of glory.\nHaving lighted a candle in the day time, he said, \u201cI am\nlooking for a man.\u201d On one occasion he stood under a fountain,[232]\nand as the bystanders were pitying him, Plato, who was\npresent, said to them, \u201cIf you wish really to show your pity for\nhim, come away;\u201d intimating that he was only acting thus out\nof a desire for notoriety. Once, when a man had struck him\nwith his fist, he said, \u201cO Hercules, what a strange thing that\nI should be walking about with a helmet on without knowing\nit!\u201d\nWhen Midias struck him with his fist and said, \u201cThere are\nthree thousand drachmas for you;\u201d the next day Diogenes took\nthe cestus of a boxer and beat him soundly, and said, \u201cThere\nare three thousand drachmas for you.\u201d[59] When Lysias, the\ndrug-seller, asked him whether he thought that there were\nany Gods: \u201cHow,\u201d said he, \u201ccan I help thinking so, when I\nconsider you to be hated by them?\u201d but some attribute this\nreply to Theodorus. Once he saw a man purifying himself\nby washing, and said to him, \u201cOh, wretched man, do not you\nknow that as you cannot wash away blunders in grammar by\npurification, so, too, you can no more efface the errors of a life\nin that same manner?\u201d\nHe used to say that men were wrong for complaining of\nfortune; for that they ask of the Gods what appear to be good\nthings, not what are really so. And to those who were\nalarmed at dreams he said, that they did not regard what they\ndo while they are awake, but make a great fuss about what\nthey fancy they see while they are asleep. Once, at the\nOlympic games, when the herald proclaimed, \u201cDioxippus is\nthe conqueror of men;\u201d he said, \u201cHe is the conqueror of\nslaves, I am the conqueror of men.\u201d\nHe was greatly beloved by the Athenians; accordingly,\nwhen a youth had broken his cask they beat him, and gave\nDiogenes another. And Dionysius, the Stoic, says that after\nthe battle of Ch\u00e6ronea he was taken prisoner and brought\nto Philip; and being asked who he was, replied, \u201cA spy, to\nspy upon your insatiability.\u201d And Philip marvelled at him\nand let him go. Once, when Alexander had sent a letter to\nAthens to Antipater, by the hands of a man named Athlias,\nhe, being present, said, \u201cAthlias from Athlius, by means of[233]\nAthlias to Athlius.\u201d[60] When Perdiccas threatened that he\nwould put him to death if he did not come to him, he replied,\n\u201cThat is nothing strange, for a scorpion or a tarantula could\ndo as much: you had better threaten me that, if I kept away,\nyou should be very happy.\u201d He used constantly to repeat\nwith emphasis that an easy life had been given to man by\nthe Gods, but that it had been overlaid by their seeking for\nhoney, cheese-cakes, and unguents, and things of that sort.\nOn which account he said to a man, who had his shoes put on\nby his servant, \u201cYou are not thoroughly happy, unless he\nalso wipes your nose for you; and he will do this, if you are\ncrippled in your hands.\u201d On one occasion, when he had seen\nthe hieromnemones[61] leading off one of the stewards who had\nstolen a goblet, he said, \u201cThe great thieves are carrying off\nthe little thief.\u201d At another time, seeing a young man throwing\nstones at a cross, he said, \u201cWell done, you will be sure to\nreach the mark.\u201d Once, too, some boys got round him and\nsaid, \u201cWe are taking care that you do not bite us;\u201d but he said,\n\u201cBe of good cheer, my boys, a dog does not eat beef.\u201d He\nsaw a man giving himself airs because he was clad in a lion\u2019s\nskin, and said to him, \u201cDo not go on disgracing the garb of\nnature.\u201d When people were speaking of the happiness of\nCallisthenes, and saying what splendid treatment he received\nfrom Alexander, he replied, \u201cThe man then is wretched, for\nhe is forced to breakfast and dine whenever Alexander chooses.\u201d\nWhen he was in want of money, he said that be reclaimed it\nfrom his friends and did not beg for it.\nOn one occasion he was working with his hands in the\nmarket-place, and said, \u201cI wish I could rub my stomach in\nthe same way, and so avoid hunger.\u201d When he saw a young\nman going with some satraps to supper, he dragged him away\nand led him off to his relations, and bade them take care of\nhim. He was once addressed by a youth beautifully adorned,\nwho asked him some question; and he refused to give him\nany answer, till he satisfied him whether he was a man or a\nwoman. And on one occasion, when a youth was playing the[234]\ncottabus in the bath, he said to him, \u201cThe better you do it, the\nworse you do it.\u201d Once at a banquet, some of the guests threw\nhim bones, as if he had been a dog; so he, as he went away,\nput up his leg against them as if he had been a dog in reality.\nHe used to call the orators, and all those who speak for fame\n\u03c4\u03c1\u03b9\u03c3\u03ac\u03bd\u03b8\u03c1\u03c9\u03c0\u03bf\u03b9 (thrice men), instead of \u03c4\u03c1\u03b9\u03c3\u03ac\u03b8\u03bb\u03b9\u03bf\u03b9 (thrice miserable).\nHe said that a rich but ignorant man, was like a sheep\nwith a golden fleece.

Being asked why slaves were\ncalled \u1f00\u03bd\u03b4\u03c1\u03ac\u03c0\u03bf\u03b4\u03b1, he replied, \u201cBecause they have the feet of\nmen (\u03c4\u03bf\u1f7a\u03c2 \u03c0\u03cc\u03b4\u03b1\u03c2 \u1f00\u03bd\u03b4\u03c1\u1ff6\u03bd), and a soul such as you who are\nasking this question.\u201d He once asked a profligate fellow for\na mina; and when he put the question to him, why he asked\nothers for an obol, and him for a mina, he said, \u201cBecause I hope\nto get something from the others another time, but the Gods\nalone know whether I shall ever extract anything from you\nagain.\u201d Once he was reproached for asking favours, while\nPlato never asked for any; and he said:\u2014\n\u201cHe asks as well as I do, but he does it\nBending his head, that no one else may hear.\u201d\nOne day he saw an unskilful archer shooting; so he went\nand sat down by the target, saying, \u201cNow I shall be out of\nharm\u2019s way.\u201d He used to say, that those who were in love\nwere disappointed in regard of the pleasure they expected.\nWhen he was asked whether death was an evil, he replied,\n\u201cHow can that be an evil which we do not feel when it is\npresent?\u201d When Alexander was once standing by him, and\nsaying, \u201cDo not you fear me?\u201d He replied, \u201cNo; for what\nare you, a good or an evil?\u201d And as he said that he was[243]\ngood, \u201cWho, then,\u201d said Diogenes, \u201cfears the good?\u201d He used\nto say, that education was, for the young sobriety, for the old\ncomfort, for the poor riches, and for the rich an ornament.\nWhen Didymus the adulterer was once trying to cure the eye\nof a young girl (\u03ba\u03cc\u03c1\u03b7\u03c2), he said, \u201cTake care, lest when you\nare curing the eye of the maiden, you do not hurt the pupil.\u201d[75]\nA man once said to him, that his friends laid plots against\nhim; \u201cWhat then,\u201d said he, \u201care you to do, if you must look\nupon both your friends and enemies in the same light?\u201d\nOn one occasion he was asked, what was the most excellent\nthing among men; and he said, \u201cFreedom of speech.\u201d\nHe went once into a school, and saw many statues of the\nMuses, but very few pupils, and said, \u201cGods, and all my\ngood schoolmasters, you have plenty of pupils.\u201d He was in\nthe habit of doing everything in public, whether in respect of\nVenus or Ceres; and he used to put his conclusions in this\nway to people: \u201cIf there is nothing absurd in dining, then\nit is not absurd to dine in the market-place. But it is not\nabsurd to dine, therefore it is not absurd to dine in the\nmarket-place.\u201d And as he was continually doing manual work\nin public, he said one day, \u201cWould that by rubbing my belly\nI could get rid of hunger.\u201d Other sayings also are attributed\nto him, which it would take a long time to enumerate, there\nis such a multiplicity of them.\nHe used to say, that there were two kinds of exercise:\nthat, namely, of the mind and that of the body; and that the\nlatter of these created in the mind such quick and agile\nphantasies at the time of its performance, as very much facilitated\nthe practice of virtue; but that one was imperfect\nwithout the other, since the health and vigour necessary for\nthe practice of what is good, depend equally on both mind\nand body. And he used to allege as proofs of this, and of the\nease which practice imparts to acts of virtue, that people could\nsee that in the case of mere common working trades, and other\nemployments of that kind, the artisans arrived at no inconsiderable\naccuracy by constant practice; and that any one\nmay see how much one flute player, or one wrestler, is superior\nto another, by his own continued practice. And that if these[244]\nmen transferred the same training to their minds they would\nnot labour in a profitless or imperfect manner. He used to\nsay also, that there was nothing whatever in life which could\nbe brought to perfection without practice, and that that alone\nwas able to overcome every obstacle; that, therefore, as we\nought to repudiate all useless toils, and to apply ourselves to\nuseful labours, and to live happily, we are only unhappy in\nconsequence of most exceeding folly. For the very contempt\nof pleasure, if we only inure ourselves to it, is very pleasant;\nand just as they who are accustomed to live luxuriously, are\nbrought very unwillingly to adopt the contrary system; so they\nwho have been originally inured to that opposite system, feel\na sort of pleasure in the contempt of pleasure.\nThis used to be the language which he held, and he used to\nshow in practice, really altering men\u2019s habits, and deferring in\nall things rather to the principles of nature than to those of\nlaw; saying that he was adopting the same fashion of life as\nHercules had, preferring nothing in the world to liberty; and\nsaying that everything belonged to the wise, and advancing\narguments such as I mentioned just above. For instance:\nevery thing belongs to the Gods; and the Gods are friends to\nthe wise; and all the property of friends is held in common;\ntherefore everything belongs to the wise. He also argued\nabout the law, that without it there is no possibility of a\nconstitution being maintained; for without a city there can be\nnothing orderly, but a city is an orderly thing; and without a\ncity there can be no law; therefore law is order. And he\nplayed in the same manner with the topics of noble birth,\nand reputation, and all things of that kind, saying that they\nwere all veils, as it were, for wickedness; and that that was\nthe only proper constitution which consisted in order. Another\nof his doctrines was that all women ought to be possessed\nin common; and he said that marriage was a nullity, and that\nthe proper way would be for every man to live with her whom\nhe could persuade to agree with him. And on the same\nprinciple he said, that all people\u2019s sons ought to belong to\nevery one in common; and there was nothing intolerable in\nthe idea of taking anything out of a temple, or eating any\nanimal whatever, and that there was no impiety in tasting even\nhuman flesh; as is plain from the habits of foreign nations;\nand he said that this principle might be correctly extended to[245]\nevery case and every people. For he said that in reality everything\nwas a combination of all things. For that in bread\nthere was meat, and in vegetables there was bread, and so\nthere were some particles of all other bodies in everything,\ncommunicating by invisible passages and evaporating.\nVII. And he explains this theory of his clearly in the\nThyestes, if indeed the tragedies attributed to him are really\nhis composition, and not rather the work of Philiscus, of\n\u00c6gina, his intimate friend, or of Pasiphon, the son of Lucian,\nwho is stated by Phavorinus, in his Universal History, to\nhave written them after Diogenes\u2019 death.\nVIII. Music and geometry, and astronomy, and all things\nof that kind, he neglected, as useless and unnecessary. But\nhe was a man very happy in meeting arguments, as is plain\nfrom what we have already said.\nIX. And he bore being sold with a most magnanimous\nspirit. For as he was sailing to \u00c6gina, and was taken\nprisoner by some pirates, under the command of Scirpalus, he\nwas carried off to Crete and sold; and when the crier asked\nhim what art he understood, he said, \u201cThat of governing\nmen.\u201d And presently pointing out a Corinthian, very carefully\ndressed, (the same Xeniades whom we have mentioned before),\nhe said, \u201cSell me to that man; for he wants a master.\u201d\nAccordingly Xeniades bought him and carried him away to\nCorinth; and then he made him tutor of his sons, and committed\nto him the entire management of his house. And he\nbehaved himself in every affair in such a manner, that\nXeniades, when looking over his property, said, \u201cA good\ngenius has come into my house.\u201d And Cleomenes, in his\nbook which is called the Schoolmaster, says, that he wished\nto ransom all his relations, but that Diogenes told him that\nthey were all fools; for that lions did not become the slaves\nof those who kept them, but, on the contrary, those who maintained\nlions were their slaves. For that it was the part of a\nslave to fear, but that wild beasts were formidable to men.\nX. And the man had the gift of persuasion in a wonderful\ndegree; so that he could easily overcome any one by his arguments.\nAccordingly, it is said that an \u00c6ginetan of the name\nof Onesicritus, having two sons, sent to Athens one of them,\nwhose name was Androsthenes, and that he, after having\nheard Diogenes lecture, remained there; and that after[246]\nthat, he sent the elder, Philiscus, who has been already mentioned,\nand that Philiscus was charmed in the same manner.\nAnd last of all, he came himself, and then he too remained,\nno less than his son, studying philosophy at the feet of\nDiogenes. So great a charm was there in the discourses of\nDiogenes. Another pupil of his was Phocion, who was surnamed\nthe Good; and Stilpon, the Megarian, and a great\nmany other men of eminence as statesmen.\nXI. He is said to have died when he was nearly ninety\nyears of age, but there are different accounts given of his\ndeath. For some say that he ate an ox\u2019s foot raw, and was in\nconsequence seized with a bilious attack, of which he died;\nothers, of whom Cercidas, a Megalopolitan or Cretan, is one,\nsay that he died of holding his breath for several days; and\nCercidas speaks thus of him in his Meliambics:\u2014\nHe, that Sinopian who bore the stick,\nWore his cloak doubled, and in th\u2019 open air\nDined without washing, would not bear with life\nA moment longer: but he shut his teeth,\nAnd held his breath. He truly was the son\nOf Jove, and a most heavenly-minded dog,\nThe wise Diogenes.\nOthers say that he, while intending to distribute a polypus to\nhis dogs, was bitten by them through the tendon of his foot,\nand so died. But his own greatest friends, as Antisthenes\ntells us in his Successions, rather sanction the story of his\nhaving died from holding his breath. For he used to live in\nthe Craneum, which was a Gymnasium at the gates of Corinth.\nAnd his friends came according to their custom, and found\nhim with his head covered; and as they did not suppose that\nhe was asleep, for he was not a man much subject to the\ninfluence of night or sleep, they drew away his cloak from his\nface, and found him no longer breathing; and they thought\nthat he had done this on purpose, wishing to escape the\nremaining portion of his life.\nOn this there was a quarrel, as they say, between his friends,\nas to who should bury him, and they even came to blows; but\nwhen the elders and chief men of the city came there, they\nsay that he was buried by them at the gate which leads to\nthe Isthmus. And they placed over him a pillar, and on that\na dog in Parian marble. And at a later period his fellow[247]\ncitizens honoured him with brazen statues, and put this\ninscription on them:\u2014\nE\u2019en brass by lapse of time doth old become,\nBut there is no such time as shall efface\nYour lasting glory, wise Diogenes;\nSince you alone did teach to men the art\nOf a contented life: the surest path\nTo glory and a lasting happiness.\nWe ourselves have also written an epigram on him in the\nproceleusmatic metre.\nA. Tell me, Diogenes, tell me true, I pray,\nHow did you die; what fate to Pluto bore you?\nB. The savage bite of an envious dog did kill me.\nSome, however, say that when he was dying, he ordered\nhis friends to throw his corpse away without burying it, so\nthat every beast might tear it, or else to throw it into a ditch,\nand sprinkle a little dust over it. And others say that his\ninjunctions were, that he should be thrown into the Ilissus;\nthat so he might be useful to his brethren. But Demetrius,\nin his treatise on Men of the Same Name, says that Diogenes\ndied in Corinth the same day that Alexander died in Babylon.\nAnd he was already an old man, as early as the hundred and\nthirteenth olympiad.\nXII. The following books are attributed to him. The\ndialogues entitled the Cephalion; the Icthyas; the Jackdaw;\nthe Leopard; the People of the Athenians; the Republic;\none called Moral Art; one on Wealth; one on Love; the\nTheodorus; the Hypsias; the Aristarchus; one on Death;\na volume of Letters; seven Tragedies, the Helen, the\nThyestes, the Hercules, the Achilles, the Medea, the Chrysippus,\nand the \u0152dipus.\nBut Sosicrates, in the first book of his Successions, and\nSatyrus, in the fourth book of his Lives, both assert that none\nof all these are the genuine composition of Diogenes. And\nSatyrus affirms that the tragedies are the work of Philiscus,\nthe \u00c6ginetan, a friend of Diogenes. But Sotion, in his\nseventh book, says that these are the only genuine works of\nDiogenes: a dialogue on Virtue; another on the Good;\nanother on Love; the Beggar; the Tolm\u00e6us; the Leopard;\nthe Cassander; the Cephalion; and that the Aristarchus, the[248]\nSisyphus, the Ganymede, a volume of Apophthegms, and\nanother of Letters, are all the work of Philiscus.\nXIII. There were five persons of the name of Diogenes.\nThe first a native of Apollonia, a natural philosopher; and\nthe beginning of his treatise on Natural Philosophy is as\nfollows: \u201cIt appears to me to be well for every one who\ncommences any kind of philosophical treatise, to lay down\nsome undeniable principle to start with.\u201d The second was a\nSicyonian, who wrote an account of Peloponnesus. The third\nwas the man of whom we have been speaking. The fourth\nwas a Stoic, a native of Seleucia, but usually called a Babylonian,\nfrom the proximity of Seleucia to Babylon. The\nfifth was a native of Tarsus, who wrote on the subject of some\nquestions concerning poetry which he endeavours to solve.\nXIV. Athenodorus, in the eighth book of his Conversations,\nsays, that the philosopher always had a shining appearance,\nfrom his habit of anointing himself.", "source": "diogenes_laertius.txt"}
