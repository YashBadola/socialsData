Man is spirit. But what is spirit? Spirit is the self. But what is the self? The self is a relation that relates itself to itself or is the relation's relating itself to itself in the relation; the self is not the relation but that the relation relates itself to itself.

Despair is the sickness unto death.

This form of despair is: in despair at not willing to be oneself.

The torment of despair is precisely this: not to be able to die. So it has much in common with the situation of the dying man when he lies and struggles with death, and cannot die. So to be sick unto death is, not to be able to die — yet not as though there were hope of life. No, the hopelessness is that there is not even the ultimate hope, death. When death is the greatest danger, one hopes for life; but when one learns to know the even more terrible danger, one hopes for death. When the danger is so great that death has become one’s hope, despair is the disconsolateness of not being able to die.
