Preface

Not only in the world of commerce but also in the world of ideas our age is putting on a veritable clearance sale. Everything can be had so dirt cheap that one begins to wonder whether in the end anyone will want to make a bid.

The Knight of Faith

If there were no eternal consciousness in a man, if at the bottom of everything there were only a wild ferment, a power that twisting in dark passions produced everything great or inconsequential; if an unfathomable, insatiable emptiness lay hid beneath everything, what would life be but despair? But it is not so; and as God created man and woman, so too He fashioned the hero and the poet or orator.

Faith is precisely this paradox, that the single individual is higher than the universal, yet in such a way, be it observed, that the movement repeats itself, and that consequently the single individual who, having been in the universal, now as the single individual sets himself apart as higher than the universal. If this be not faith, then Abraham is lost, then faith has never existed in the world precisely because it has always existed.

The ethical expression for what Abraham did is, that he would murder Isaac; the religious expression is, that he would sacrifice Isaac; but in this contradiction lies the dread which can well make a man sleepless, and yet Abraham is not what he is without this dread.
