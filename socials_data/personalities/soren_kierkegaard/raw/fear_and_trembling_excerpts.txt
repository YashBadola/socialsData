Preface

Not only in the world of commerce but also in the world of ideas our age
is putting on a veritable clearance sale. Everything can be had so dirt
cheap that one begins to wonder whether in the end anyone will want to
make a bid. Every speculative price-fixer who conscientiously directs
attention to the significant march of modern philosophy, every
Assistant Professor, tutor, and student, every crofter and cottar in
philosophy, is not content with stopping at doubting everything but goes
further. Perhaps it would be untimely and ill-timed to ask them where
they are going, but surely it is courteous and unobtrusive to take it
for granted that they have doubted everything, since otherwise it would
be queer to say that they were going further. This movement they have
all of them made, and presumably with such ease that they do not think
it necessary to drop a word about the how; for not even he who anxiously
and with deep concern sought a little guidance from the standard authors
found any, or found only the assurance that everybody had done it.

But “Descartes did not doubt in matters of faith.” “Meminisse
vellem,” thought I, “Cartesium non de divina fide loqui, sed de
propria philosophia; video tamen in nonnullis eum parum sibi
constare.” [I would wish to remember that Descartes did not speak
of the divine faith but of his own philosophy; I see, however, that
in some things he was not consistent with himself.] But Descartes
did not cry, “Fire!” and make it a duty for everyone to doubt,
for Descartes was a quiet and solitary thinker, not a bellowing
night-watchman; he modestly admitted that his method had importance
for him alone and was justified in part by his earlier bungling
knowledge. What those ancient Greeks (who also had some knowledge
of philosophy) thought about such a task, surely we must know. But
did not the highly respected veteran philosopher [Heraclitus] say
that one cannot go through the same river twice? He, the brave old
fighter, surely did not stay in the carriage and let “the system”
make the conquest. But in our time everything is different; for now
everyone can do it, and do it all at once.

If one were to try to describe the different kinds of philosophical
speculation, he could say that the first kind is that which reflects
upon the past, the second that which reflects upon the future. The
first is the philosophy of recollection, the second the philosophy of
expectation. But in the midst of this recollection and expectation,
there is the moment, and this moment is the paradox. The paradox is
not a concession but a category, an ontological definition which
expresses the relation between an existing cognitive spirit and
eternal truth.

Faith is precisely this paradox, that the single individual is higher
than the universal, yet in such a way, be it observed, that the
movement repeats itself, and that consequently the single individual,
after having been in the universal, now as the single individual
isolates himself as higher than the universal. If this be not faith,
then Abraham is lost, then faith has never existed in the world...
because it has always existed. For if the ethical (i.e., the moral) is
the highest thing, and if nothing incommensurable remains in man in any
other way but as the evil (i.e., the particular which has to be
expressed in the universal), then one needs no other categories than
those which the Greek philosophers possessed or which can be deduced
from them by consistent thought. But religion is the sphere of the
paradox.

The story of Abraham is the story of this paradox. God tempted Abraham
and said unto him, Take Isaac, thine only son, whom thou lovest, and get
thee into the land of Moriah, and offer him there for a burnt offering
upon one of the mountains which I will tell thee of.

It was early in the morning, Abraham rose betimes, and had the asses
saddled, left his tent, and Isaac with him. And Sarah looked out of the
window after them until they had gone down the valley and she could see
them no more. They rode in silence for three days. On the fourth
morning Abraham said not a word, but he lifted up his eyes and saw
Mount Moriah afar off. He left the young men behind and went on alone
with Isaac, carrying the fire and the knife. And when he turned aside
to offer, God saw that he would not withhold his only son, and the ram
was sacrificed in his stead.

Now all this was only a trial.

But what if Abraham had not been a man of faith?

Let us imagine a man who was not an Abraham but who, like him, was
called to sacrifice the best that he possessed. He would have done it,
and he would have done it with a heavy heart, and he would have
returned home, and he would have been admired by his friends and
neighbors as a hero. But he would not have been the father of faith. He
would have been a tragic hero.

For the tragic hero stays within the ethical. He sacrifices himself (or
his son) for the universal (the state, the law, the family). But
Abraham? Abraham transcends the ethical. He has a teleological
suspension of the ethical. He acts by virtue of the absurd. He
believes that God will not require Isaac of him, yet he is willing to
sacrifice him. This is the movement of faith.

If there is no such thing as a teleological suspension of the ethical,
then Abraham is a murderer.

Epilogue

One cannot buy faith in the market place. It is not a ware that passes
from hand to hand. It is a passion, the highest passion of all. There
are many who never reach it, but no one goes further.
