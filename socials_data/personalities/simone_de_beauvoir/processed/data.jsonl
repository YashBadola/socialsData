{"text": "I was born at four o'clock in the morning on the 9th of January 1908, in a room fitted with white-enamelled furniture and overlooking the Boulevard Raspail. In the family photographs taken the following summer, the ladies can be seen wearing long skirts and ostrich-feather hats, the gentlemen boaters and Panama hats, smiling at a baby: they are my parents, my grandfather, uncles, aunts; and I am the baby. My father was thirty, my mother twenty-one, and I was their first child. I turn the page of the album; Mother is holding in her arms a baby who isn't me; I am wearing a pleated skirt and a tam-o'-shanter; I am two and a half, and my sister has just been born. I was evidently jealous, but not for long. As far back as I can remember, I was proud of being the elder: the first. Disguised as Little Red Riding Hood and carrying a basket full of cakes and a pot of butter, I felt myself to be much more interesting than an infant nailed to its cradle. I had a little sister: that baby doll didn't have me.\nI remember a time when the world was vast and full of mysteries. I remember the smell of the varnish on the furniture in my grandmother's house, the taste of the madeleines she dipped in her tea. I remember the sound of the rain against the windowpane, a sound that seemed to me to be the very voice of sadness. But I also remember the joy of running in the Luxembourg Gardens, the thrill of learning to read, the discovery that words could capture the essence of things.\nAs I grew older, I realized that the world was not as simple as it had seemed. I began to see the cracks in the facade of bourgeois respectability. I saw the hypocrisy of those who claimed to be virtuous while exploiting others. I saw the injustice of a society that denied women the same rights and opportunities as men. And I knew that I could not be content to simply accept the world as it was. I had to question it, to challenge it, to make my own way in it. I wanted to write, to create, to leave my mark on the world. I wanted to be free.", "source": "memoirs_dutiful_daughter_excerpt.txt"}
{"text": "For a long time I have hesitated to write a book on woman. The subject is irritating, especially to women; and it is not new. Enough ink has been spilled in quarreling over feminism, and perhaps we should say no more about it. It is still talked about, however, for the voluminous nonsense uttered during the last century seems to have done little to illuminate the problem. After all, is there a problem? And if so, what is it? Are there women, really? Most assuredly the theory of the eternal feminine has lost its prestige. Nevertheless, women exist. One might say that, if the mystery of the eternal feminine is no more, it is because there are no longer any women. But this is not the case.\nThe terms masculine and feminine are used symmetrically only as a matter of form, as on legal papers. In actuality the relation of the two sexes is not quite like that of two electrical poles, for man represents both the positive and the neutral, as is indicated by the common use of man to designate human beings in general; whereas woman represents only the negative, defined by limiting criteria, without reciprocity. In the midst of an abstract discussion it is vexing to hear a man say: 'You think thus and so because you are a woman'; but I know that my only defense is to reply: 'I think thus and so because it is true,' thereby removing my subjective self from the argument. It would be out of the question to reply: 'And you think the contrary because you are a man,' for it is understood that the fact of being a man is no peculiarity. A man is in the right in being a man; it is the woman who is in the wrong. It amounts to this: just as for the ancients there was an absolute vertical with reference to which the oblique was defined, so there is an absolute human type, the masculine. Woman has ovaries, a uterus; these peculiarities imprison her in her subjectivity, circumscribe her within the limits of her own nature. It is often said that she thinks with her glands. Man superbly ignores the fact that his anatomy also includes glands, such as the testicles, and that they secrete hormones. He thinks of his body as a direct and normal connection with the world, which he believes he apprehends objectively, whereas he regards the body of woman as a hindrance, a prison, weighed down by everything peculiar to it. 'The female is a female by virtue of a certain lack of qualities,' said Aristotle; 'we should regard the female nature as afflicted with a natural defectiveness.' And St. Thomas for his part pronounced woman to be an 'imperfect man,' an 'incidental' being. This is symbolized in Genesis where Eve is depicted as made from what Bossuet called 'a supernumerary bone' of Adam.\nThus humanity is male and man defines woman not in herself but as relative to him; she is not regarded as an autonomous being. Michelet writes: 'Woman, the relative being...' And Benda is most positive in his Report of Uriel: 'The body of man makes sense in itself quite apart from that of woman, whereas the latter seems wanting in significance by itself... Man can think of himself without woman. She cannot think of herself without man.' And she is simply what man decrees; thus she is called 'the sex', by which is meant that she appears essentially to the male as a sexual being. For him she is sex - absolute sex, no less. She is defined and differentiated with reference to man and not he with reference to her; she is the incidental, the inessential as opposed to the essential. He is the Subject, he is the Absolute - she is the Other.", "source": "the_second_sex_intro.txt"}
{"text": "The man who finds himself cast into a world which he has not helped to establish, which has been fashioned without him, and which appears to him as an absolute to which he can only submit, is no longer merely a child. He is also a serious man. The serious man gets rid of his freedom by claiming to subordinate it to values which would be unconditioned. He imagines that the accession to these values likewise permanently establishes his value. The serious man fails to understand that, if error is possible, it is because there is a truth; but this truth is not given, it is to be won. He fails to understand that the ready-made values which he accepts are only the result of the free choices of other men who have preceded him. He takes them for things.\nThe serious man is not a man who has chosen to be serious. He is a man who has lost the sense of his subjectivity. He does not even suspect that the values he respects are his own values, created by his own freedom. He thinks that they are inscribed in the things themselves, or in the sky, or in the intelligible world. He hides from himself the fact that he is free, in order to avoid the anguish of freedom. He wants to be a thing. But he is a man. This is the source of his bad faith. He is a tyrant who wants to impose his own seriousness upon others. He is a fanatic.\nTo be free is not to have the power to do anything you like; it is to be able to surpass the given toward an open future. The existence of others as a freedom defines my situation and is even the condition of my own freedom. I am oppressed if I am thrown into a prison, but I am also oppressed if the future is closed to me by the action of others.\nThe wish for all men to be free is the wish for the existence of others to be recognized as a freedom which is the condition of my own freedom. To will oneself free is also to will others free. This is the only way to justify one's existence. The man who seeks to justify his life must want freedom itself absolutely and above everything else. At the same time that it requires the freedom of others, it requires their assistance. We have need of others in order that our existence be recognized; but we also have need of them in order that our existence be effective.", "source": "ethics_of_ambiguity_excerpt.txt"}
