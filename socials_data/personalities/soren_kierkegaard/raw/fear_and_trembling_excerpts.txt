Excerpt from Fear and Trembling:

Faith is precisely this paradox, that the single individual is higher than the universal. If this is not so, then Abraham is lost, and faith has never existed in the world because it has always existed. For if the ethical (i.e., the moral) is the highest thing, and if nothing incommensurable remains in man in any other way but as the evil (i.e., the particular which has to be expressed in the universal), then one needs no other categories than those which the Greek philosophers possessed or which can be deduced from them by logic. But if the single individual is higher than the universal, then Abraham is a knight of faith.

The knight of faith is the only happy man, the heir to the finite, while the knight of resignation is a stranger and a foreigner. But the knight of faith knows it is glorious to belong to the universal. He knows it is beautiful and salutary to be the individual who translates himself into the universal, who edits, as it were, a pure and elegant edition of himself, as free from errors as possible and readable by all. He knows that it is refreshing to become intelligible to oneself in the universal so that he understands it and so that every individual who understands him understands the universal through him, and both rejoice in the security of the universal. He knows that it is beautiful to be born as the individual who has the universal as his home, his friendly abiding place, which at once welcomes him with open arms when he would abide there. But he knows also that higher than this there is a winding, solitary path, steep and narrow; he knows that it is terrible to be born outside the universal, to walk without meeting a single traveler. He knows that it is terrible to be born out to the solitary, for whom the universal is not a home, but a distance.

Infinite resignation is the last stage prior to faith, so that one who has not made this movement has not faith; for only in the infinite resignation do I become clear to myself with respect to my eternal validity, and only then can there be question of grasping existence by virtue of faith.

To exist in such a way that my opposition to existence expresses itself as the most beautiful and secure harmony with it, that is the task.
