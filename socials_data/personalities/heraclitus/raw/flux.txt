We step and do not step into the same rivers; we are and are not.

It scatters and it gathers; it advances and retires.

In the circumference of a circle the beginning and end are common.

The way up and the way down is one and the same.

The straight and the crooked path of the fuller's comb is one and the same.

Cold things become warm, and what is warm cools; what is wet dries, and the parched is moistened.

War is the father of all and the king of all; and some he has made gods and some men, some bond and some free.

Couples are things whole and things not whole, what is drawn together and what is drawn asunder, the harmonious and the discordant. The one is made up of all things, and all things issue from the one.

Men do not know how what is at variance agrees with itself. It is an attunement of opposite tensions, like that of the bow and the lyre.

The hidden attunement is better than the open.
