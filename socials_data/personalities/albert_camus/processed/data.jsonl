{"text": "The gods had condemned Sisyphus to ceaselessly rolling a rock to the top of a mountain, whence the stone would fall back of its own weight. They had thought with some reason that there is no more dreadful punishment than futile and hopeless labor.\nIf one believes Homer, Sisyphus was the wisest and most prudent of mortals. According to another tradition, however, he was disposed to practice the profession of highwayman. I see no contradiction in this. Opinions differ as to the reasons why he became the futile laborer of the underworld. To begin with, he is accused of a certain levity in regard to the gods. He stole their secrets.\nWhatever may be the myths, Sisyphus is the absurd hero. He is, as much through his passions as through his torture. His scorn of the gods, his hatred of death, and his passion for life won him that unspeakable penalty in which the whole being is exerted toward accomplishing nothing. This is the price that must be paid for the passions of this earth.\nThe workman of today works every day in his life at the same tasks, and this fate is no less absurd. But it is tragic only at the rare moments when it becomes conscious. Sisyphus, proletarian of the gods, powerless and rebellious, knows the whole extent of his wretched condition: it is what he thinks of during his descent. The lucidity that was to constitute his torture at the same time crowns his victory. There is no fate that cannot be surmounted by scorn.\nI leave Sisyphus at the foot of the mountain! One always finds one's burden again. But Sisyphus teaches the higher fidelity that negates the gods and raises rocks. He too concludes that all is well. This universe henceforth without a master seems to him neither sterile nor futile. Each atom of that stone, each mineral flake of that night-filled mountain, in itself forms a world. The struggle itself toward the heights is enough to fill a man's heart. One must imagine Sisyphus happy.", "source": "sisyphus.txt"}
{"text": "MOTHER died today. Or, maybe, yesterday; I can\u2019t be sure. The telegram from the Home says: YOUR MOTHER PASSED AWAY. FUNERAL TOMORROW. DEEP SYMPATHY. Which leaves the matter doubtful; it could have been yesterday.\nThe Home for Aged Persons is at Marengo, some fifty miles from Algiers. With the two o\u2019clock bus I should get there well before nightfall. Then I can spend the night there, keeping the usual vigil beside the body, and be back here by tomorrow evening. I have asked my boss for two days off and there was no way he could refuse because of a funeral. But he didn\u2019t look happy about it. I even said, \u201cIt\u2019s not my fault.\u201d He didn\u2019t answer. Then I thought I shouldn\u2019t have said that. After all, I had nothing to apologize for. He\u2019s the one who should have condoled with me. But probably he will do so the day after tomorrow, when he sees me in black. For the present, it\u2019s almost as if Mother weren\u2019t really dead. The funeral will bring it home to me, put an official seal on it, so to speak. ...\nIt occurred to me that somehow I\u2019d got through another Sunday, that Mother now was buried, and tomorrow I\u2019d be going back to work as usual. Really, nothing had changed.", "source": "the_stranger.txt"}
