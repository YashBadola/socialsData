When Alexander the Great came to visit Diogenes and asked if there was anything he could do for him, Diogenes replied, "Yes, stand out of my sunlight."

Plato defined man as "a featherless biped" and was much praised for the definition. Diogenes plucked a chicken and brought it into Plato's Academy, saying, "Behold! I've brought you a man." After this, Plato added "with broad flat nails" to his definition.

Diogenes was spotted walking through the marketplace in full daylight with a lit lamp. When asked what he was doing, he answered, "I am looking for a man." (Implying he could find no honest or virtuous men).

Upon seeing a child drinking from his hands, Diogenes threw away his cup and said, "A child has beaten me in plainness of living."

Diogenes was seen begging for money from a statue. When asked why, he replied, "I am practicing being rejected."

When asked why people give to beggars but not to philosophers, he said, "Because they think they may one day become lame or blind, but never expect that they will turn to philosophy."

Seeing a young man behaving effeminately, Diogenes said, "Are you not ashamed that nature made you a man, but you are forcing yourself to play the woman?"

When someone reminded him that he had once been a counterfeiter (or money-changer) in Sinope, he said, "At that time I was indeed such a one as you are now; but such as I am now, you will never be."

He was asked where in Greece he saw good men; he replied, "Good men nowhere, but good boys at Sparta."

When asked what was the most beautiful thing in the world, he replied, "Freedom of speech."

Seeing an archer who was a bad shot, he sat down beside the target. When asked why, he said, "So that I will not get hit."

When asked what he had gained from philosophy, he replied, "If nothing else, at least to be prepared for every fortune."
