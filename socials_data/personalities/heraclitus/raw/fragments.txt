1. Although this Logos holds forever, men ever fail to comprehend, both before hearing it and once they have heard. Although all things come to pass in accordance with this Logos, men are like the untried when they try such words and works as I set forth, distinguishing each according to its nature and telling how it is. But other men are oblivious of what they do awake, just as they are forgetful of what they do asleep.

67. God is day night, winter summer, war peace, satiety hunger; he undergoes alteration in the way that fire, when it is mixed with spices, is named according to the scent of each of them.

80. It is necessary to know that war is common and right is strife and that all things happen by strife and necessity.

88. And as the same thing there exists in us living and dead and the waking and the sleeping and young and old: for these having changed round are those, and those having changed round are these.

101. I searched into myself.

119. A man's character is his fate.

123. Nature loves to hide.
