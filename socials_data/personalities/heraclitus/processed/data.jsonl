{"text": "You cannot step twice into the same rivers; for fresh waters are ever flowing in upon you.\nWe step and do not step into the same rivers; we are and are not.\nIt is the opposite which is good for us.\nCouples are things whole and things not whole, what is drawn together and what is drawn asunder, the harmonious and the discordant. The one is made up of all things, and all things issue from the one.\nMen do not know how what is at variance agrees with itself. It is an attunement of opposite tensions, like that of the bow and the lyre.\nThe hidden attunement is better than the open.\nThe straight and the crooked path of the fuller's comb is one and the same.\nThe way up and the way down is one and the same.\nGod is day and night, winter and summer, war and peace, surfeit and hunger; but he takes various shapes, just as fire, when it is mingled with spices, is named according to the savour of each.\nWar is the father of all and the king of all; and some he has made gods and some men, some bond and some free.\nWe must know that war is common to all and strife is justice, and that all things come into being and pass away through strife.\nIt rests by changing.", "source": "flux.txt"}
{"text": "This world, which is the same for all, no one of gods or men has made; but it was ever, is now, and ever shall be an ever-living Fire, with measures of it kindling, and measures going out.\nThe transformations of Fire are, first of all, sea; and half of the sea is earth, half whirlwind.\nIt becomes liquid sea, and is measured by the same tale as before it became earth.\nFor it is death to souls to become water, and death to water to become earth. But water comes from earth; and from water, soul.\nThe sun is new every day.\nThe sun will not overstep his measures; if he does, the Erinyes, the handmaids of Justice, will find him out.\nIt is the thunderbolt that steers the course of all things.\nFire is want and surfeit.\nFire in its advance will judge and convict all things.\nAll things are an exchange for Fire, and Fire for all things, even as wares for gold and gold for wares.", "source": "fire_and_cosmos.txt"}
{"text": "Though this Word is true evermore, yet men are as unable to understand it when they hear it for the first time as before they have heard it at all. For, though all things come to pass in accordance with this Word, men seem as if they had no experience of them, when they make trial of words and deeds such as I set forth, dividing each thing according to its kind and showing how it truly is. But other men know not what they are doing when awake, even as they forget what they do in sleep.\nSo we must follow the common, yet though my Word is common, the many live as if they had a wisdom of their own.\nIt is wise to hearken, not to me, but to my Word, and to confess that all things are one.\nThinking is common to all.\nThe wise is one only. It is unwilling and willing to be called by the name of Zeus.\nWisdom is one thing. It is to know the thought by which all things are steered through all things.\nThose who speak with understanding must hold fast to what is common to all as a city holds fast to its law, and even more strongly. For all human laws are fed by the one divine law. It prevails as much as it will, and suffices for all things with something to spare.\nTo the soul, belongs the self-multiplying Logos.", "source": "logos.txt"}
{"text": "For even the best of them choose one thing above all others, immortal glory among mortals, while most of them are glutted like beasts.\nFools when they do hear are like the deaf: of them does the saying bear witness that they are absent when present.\nThe learning of many things teacheth not understanding, else would it have taught Hesiod and Pythagoras, and again Xenophanes and Hekataios.\nHomer should be turned out of the lists and whipped, and Archilochos likewise.\nEyes and ears are bad witnesses to men if they have souls that understand not their language.\nDogs bark at every one they do not know.\nThe most esteemed of them knows but fancies, and holds fast to them, yet of a truth justice shall overtake the artificers of lies and the false witnesses.\nThe Ephesians would do well to hang themselves, every grown man of them, and leave the city to beardless lads; for they have cast out Hermodoros, the best man among them, saying, \"We will have none who is best among us; if there be any such, let him be so elsewhere and among others.\"\nMan is called a baby by God, even as a child by a man.\nThe wisest man is an ape compared to God, just as the most beautiful ape is ugly compared to man.\nThey are estranged from that with which they have most constant intercourse.\nIt is not meet to act and speak like men asleep.\nThose who are asleep are fellow-workers (in what goes on in the world).", "source": "human_folly.txt"}
