Preface

Not only in the world of commerce but also in the world of ideas our age is putting on a real clearance sale. Everything may be had at such a bargain price that it is doubtful whether in the end there is anyone who will want to bid. Every speculative price-fixer who conscientiously directs attention to the significant march of modern philosophy, every Privatdocent, tutor, and student, every crofter and cottar in philosophy, is not stopping to doubt everything but goes further. It might, perhaps, be untimely and ill-timed to ask them where they are going, but surely it is courteous and unobtrusive to take it for granted that they have doubted everything, since otherwise it would be queer for them to be going further. This preliminary movement they have therefore all of them made, and presumably with such ease that they do not think it necessary to waste a word about the how; for not even he who anxiously and with deep concern sought a little enlightenment in the standard works found any such thing, found any instruction about the art of doubting, or any inkling that this was a task which might require time and effort. No, we are all of us through with that, and it is with this as with so many other things nowadays—one does not doubt that there is a God, one does not doubt that there is a self, one does not doubt that it is a good thing to be born, one does not doubt that the world exists, one does not doubt that one has a nose in the middle of his face; one does not doubt, for the time is past when it was a task to doubt, a task for a giant, one which he and he alone could perform, and which for that very reason was the only task he undertook; for the Titan who stormed heaven did not perhaps doubt that there was a throne in the sky, but he wanted to sit on it himself.

Faith is precisely this paradox, that the individual as the particular is higher than the universal, is justified over against it, is not subordinate but superior—yet in such a way, be it observed, that it is the particular individual who, after he has been subordinated as the particular to the universal, now through the universal becomes the individual who as the particular is superior to the universal, for the fact that the individual as the particular stands in an absolute relation to the absolute. This position cannot be mediated, for all mediation comes about precisely by virtue of the universal; it is and remains to all eternity a paradox, inaccessible to thought. And yet faith is this paradox—or else (these are the logical deductions which I would beg the reader to judge for himself, though I by no means make it a point of honour to have done the thinking entirely on my own hook)—or else there is no faith at all, but they are right who say that faith is something immediate, that aesthetic emotion is faith.
