What if everything in the world were a misunderstanding, what if laughter were really tears?

I feel as if I were a piece in a game of chess, when my opponent says of it: That piece cannot be moved.

Listen to the cry of a woman in labor at the hour of giving birth—look at the dying man’s struggle at his last extremity, and then tell me whether something that begins and ends thus could be intended for enjoyment.

Marry, and you will regret it; do not marry, you will also regret it; marry or do not marry, you will regret it either way. Laugh at the world’s foolishness, you will regret it; weep over it, you will regret that too.
