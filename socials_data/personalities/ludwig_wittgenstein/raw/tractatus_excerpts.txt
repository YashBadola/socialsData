1 The world is everything that is the case.
1.1 The world is the totality of facts, not of things.
1.11 The world is determined by the facts, and by these being all the facts.
1.12 For the totality of facts determines both what is the case, and also all that is not the case.
1.13 The facts in logical space are the world.
1.2 The world divides into facts.
2 What is the case, the fact, is the existence of atomic facts.
2.01 An atomic fact is a combination of objects (entities, things).
2.02 The object is simple.
3 The logical picture of the facts is the thought.
3.001 "An atomic fact is thinkable"—means: we can imagine it.
3.01 The totality of true thoughts is a picture of the world.
4 The thought is the significant proposition.
4.001 The totality of propositions is the language.
4.002 Man possesses the capacity of constructing languages, in which every sense can be expressed, without having an idea how and what each word means—just as one speaks without knowing how the single sounds are produced.
4.003 Most proposition and questions, that have been written about philosophical matters, are not false, but senseless. We cannot, therefore, answer questions of this kind at all, but only state their senselessness. Most questions and propositions of the philosophers result from the fact that we do not understand the logic of our language.
5 Propositions are truth-functions of elementary propositions.
5.6 The limits of my language mean the limits of my world.
6.522 There is indeed the inexpressible. This shows itself; it is the mystical.
7 Whereof one cannot speak, thereof one must be silent.
