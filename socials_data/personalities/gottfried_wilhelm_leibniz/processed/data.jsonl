{"text": "The Monad, of which we shall here speak, is nothing but a simple substance, which enters into composites; simple meaning without parts. And there must be simple substances, since there are composites; for a composite is nothing but a collection or aggregatum of simple things.\nNow where there are no parts, there can be neither extension nor figure nor divisibility. These Monads are the real atoms of nature and in a word, the elements of things. No dissolution of these elements need be feared, and there is no conceivable way in which a simple substance can be perished by natural means.\nFor the same reason there is no conceivable way in which a simple substance can begin by natural means, since it cannot be formed by the combination of several; and as it can neither begin nor end by natural means, it can only begin by creation and end by annihilation; whereas that which is composite begins or ends by parts.\nThere is no way of explaining how a Monad can be altered in quality or internally changed by any other created thing; since it is impossible to change the place or to conceive in it any internal motion which could be excited, directed, increased or diminished therein, although all this is possible in the case of composites, in which there are changes among the parts. The Monads have no windows, through which anything could come in or go out. Accidents cannot separate themselves from substances nor go about outside of them, as the 'sensible species' of the Scholastics used to do. Thus neither substance nor accident can enter a Monad from without.\nHowever, the Monads must have some qualities, otherwise they would not even be existing things. And if simple substances did not differ in quality, there would be absolutely no means of perceiving any change in things. For what is in the composite can come only from the simple elements it contains, and the Monads, if they had no qualities, would be indistinguishable from one another, since they do not differ in quantity. Consequently, space being a plenum, each part of space would always receive only the equivalent of what it had had before, and one state of things would be indistinguishable from another.\nThus, every Monad must be different from every other. For in nature there are never two beings which are perfectly alike and in which it is not possible to find an internal difference, or at least a difference founded upon an intrinsic quality.\nI assume also as admitted that every created being, and consequently the created Monad, is subject to change, and further that this change is continuous in each. It follows from what has just been said, that the natural changes of the Monads come from an internal principle, since an external cause can have no influence upon their inner being.\nBut, besides the principle of the change, there must be a particular series of the changes, which constitutes, so to speak, the specific nature and variety of the simple substances. This particular series of changes should involve a multiplicity in the unit or in that which is simple. For, as every natural change takes place gradually, something changes and something remains; and consequently, in the simple substance there must be a plurality of affections and relations, although there are no parts.\nThis shifting state, which involves and represents a multitude in the unit or in the simple substance, is nothing but what is called Perception, which is to be distinguished from Apperception or Consciousness, as will appear in what follows. In this matter the Cartesian view is extremely defective, for it treats as non-existent those perceptions of which we are not consciously aware. This has also led them to believe that minds alone are Monads, and that there are no souls of animals nor other Entelechies.\nIf we wish to discover how we compare with the Monads, we must consider that there are two states of the Monad: Perception and Appetition. Appetition is the tendency of the internal principle to pass from one perception to another.", "source": "monadology_excerpts.txt"}
{"text": "I have remarked that in the things of God there is no choice without a reason; and that this is a consequence of his supreme wisdom. Mr. Clarke grants me this principle, but he wishes to maintain that God's mere will is a sufficient reason. But this is to revert to the indifference of equilibrium, which I have refuted.\nIf space were an absolute reality, far from being a property, it would be greater than God himself, since it is infinite and eternal and independent of God. But space is nothing but the order of existence of things possible, as time is the order of existence of things inconsistent. Space denotes, in terms of possibility, an order of things which exist at the same time, considered as existing together; without enquiring into their manner of existing. And when many things are seen together, one perceives that order of things among themselves.\nMr. Clarke maintains that space is the sensorium of God. But God does not need a sense organ to perceive things. He perceives them by his own essence, because he is the cause of them.\nIf the world were finite, God could have made it larger; and if he could have made it larger, why did he not? To say that he could not is to limit his power. To say that he did not wish to is to limit his goodness, unless one can show a reason derived from the nature of things why a finite world is better than an infinite one.\nThere is no vacuum in nature. A vacuum would be a sterility, a defect. God has filled every part of space with matter, for the more matter there is, the more opportunity there is for God to exercise his wisdom and power; and strictly speaking, there is no empty space, for matter is everywhere.\nAs for the attraction of bodies, which Mr. Newton calls gravitation, if it is an action at a distance without a medium, it is a miracle. For it is impossible to conceive how a body can act upon another where it is not.", "source": "letters_to_clarke_excerpts.txt"}
{"text": "The most widely accepted and meaningful notion we have of God is expressed well enough in these words: that God is an absolutely perfect being; but the consequences of these words are not sufficiently considered. And, to go further into the matter, there are several distinct perfections in nature, that is to say, several forms of properties which belong to it, and by which it effectively differs from other things, and which the understanding can conceive without attaching any limits to them. For example, to have power or knowledge is a perfection.\nBut since there are many perfections, and they are all compatible with each other, it follows that there is a being who possesses all of them, and this being is God. For if there were any incompatibility among perfections, the nature of the possibility of God would be called into question, which has been done by some; but I believe I have shown that all perfections are compatible.\nFrom this it follows that God, possessing supreme and infinite wisdom, acts in the most perfect manner, not only metaphysically, but also morally speaking; and that, with respect to ourselves, we can say that the more we are enlightened and informed of the works of God, the more we shall be disposed to find them excellent and entirely in conformity with that which we might have desired.\nI am far from the opinion of those who maintain that there are no principles of goodness or perfection in the nature of things, or in the ideas which God has of them, and who say that the works of God are good only for the reason that God has made them. For if this were the case, God, knowing that He is the author of things, would not have to regard them afterwards and find them good, as Holy Scripture testifies.\nIt seems to me that the will of God is not independence, but is ruled by his wisdom, and that we must distinguish between the will to do a particular thing and the will to make a certain law or general order.\nThus, one must say that God makes the most of things that he can, and that he has chosen the best possible plan, in which the greatest variety is combined with the greatest order: where ground, place, time be arranged as well as possible; where the greatest effect is produced by the simplest means; where the creatures have the most power, knowledge, happiness and goodness that the universe could allow.\nFor since all the possible things have a claim to existence in the understanding of God in proportion to their perfections, the result of all these claims must be the actual world, the most perfect which is possible. And so, the world is not a machine that runs down and requires rewinding, as Mr. Newton suggests, but a perpetual watch that runs by its own internal harmony, pre-established by God.\nThis system of pre-established harmony is the only one that explains the union of the soul and body. The soul follows its own laws, and the body follows its own laws, and they agree with each other in virtue of the pre-established harmony between all substances, since they are all representations of one and the same universe.", "source": "discourse_on_metaphysics_excerpts.txt"}
