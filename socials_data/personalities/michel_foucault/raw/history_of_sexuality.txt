The Repressive Hypothesis

The seventeenth century, so the story goes, was the beginning of an age of repression: this was the age of the bourgeois societies, of the expansion of capitalism, and of the establishment of the modern state. Sexuality was carefully confined; it moved into the home. The conjugal family took custody of it and absorbed it into the serious function of reproduction. On the subject of sex, silence became the rule.

But is it not the case that, since the eighteenth century, there has been a discursive explosion regarding sex? Rather than a massive censorship, we have seen a regulated and polymorphous incitement to discourse?

This bio-power was without question an indispensable element in the development of capitalism; the latter would not have been possible without the controlled insertion of bodies into the machinery of production and the adjustment of the phenomena of population to economic processes. But this was not all it required; it also needed the growth of both these factors, their reinforcement as well as their availability and docility; it had to have methods of power capable of optimizing forces, aptitudes, and life in general without at the same time making them more difficult to govern.

If one can apply the term bio-history to the pressures through which the movements of life and the processes of history interfere with one another, one would have to speak of bio-politics to designate what brought life and its mechanisms into the realm of explicit calculations and made knowledge-power an agent of transformation of human life.
