I was born at four o'clock in the morning on the 9th of January 1908, in a room fitted with white-lacquered furniture and overlooking the Boulevard Raspail. My parents were young, wealthy, and deeply in love. I was a dutiful daughter, raised in a bourgeois catholic environment that seemed to me to be the natural order of the world.

My father was a man of culture, an agnostic who loved literature and theater. My mother was a devout Catholic. I grew up in the tension between my father's skepticism and my mother's piety. For a long time, I tried to reconcile them. I wanted to be a saint, but I also wanted to write books.

The loss of my faith was a major turning point. I realized that God did not exist, and that I was alone in the universe. This was not a source of despair, but of liberation. If there was no God, then there were no absolute commandments. I was responsible for my own life. I had to create my own values.

I met Jean-Paul Sartre at the Sorbonne. He was the first person I met who was truly my intellectual equal. We made a pact: we would be essential loves, but we would also have contingent loves. We would tell each other everything. This transparency was the foundation of our relationship.

I remember long discussions in cafes, smoking cigarettes and drinking coffee, arguing about philosophy, politics, and art. We felt that we were at the center of the world, that our ideas mattered. We were determined to live our philosophy, not just write about it.

Writing was always my primary vocation. I wanted to capture the texture of life, the passing of time, the complexity of human relationships. I wanted to bear witness to my era. My life and my work are inextricably linked. Every book I wrote was an attempt to answer a question that my life had posed to me.

Growing old is a strange experience. One day you look in the mirror and you see a stranger. But the inner self remains the same. The desire to know, to understand, to love, does not diminish with age. I have lived a full life, and I have no regrets. I have chosen my own path, and I have paid the price for it.
