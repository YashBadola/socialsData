He chooses the fairest place and middle of any\nwall, or panel, wherein to draw a picture, which he finishes with his\nutmost care and art, and the vacuity about it he fills with grotesques,\nwhich are odd fantastic figures without any grace but what they derive\nfrom their variety, and the extravagance of their shapes.  And in truth,\nwhat are these things I scribble, other than grotesques and monstrous\nbodies, made of various parts, without any certain figure, or any other\nthan accidental order, coherence, or proportion?\n\"Desinit in piscem mulier formosa superne.\"\n[\"A fair woman in her upper form terminates in a fish.\"\n--Horace, De Arte Poetica, v. 4.]\nIn this second part I go hand in hand with my painter; but fall very\nshort of him in the first and the better, my power of handling not being\nsuch, that I dare to offer at a rich piece, finely polished, and set off\naccording to art.  I have therefore thought fit to borrow one of Estienne\nde la Boetie, and such a one as shall honour and adorn all the rest of my\nwork--namely, a discourse that he called 'Voluntary Servitude'; but,\nsince, those who did not know him have properly enough called it \"Le\ncontr Un.\"  He wrote in his youth,--[\"Not being as yet eighteen years\nold.\"--Edition of 1588.] by way of essay, in honour of liberty against\ntyrants; and it has since run through the hands of men of great learning\nand judgment, not without singular and merited commendation; for it is\nfinely written, and as full as anything can possibly be.  And yet one may\nconfidently say it is far short of what he was able to do; and if in that\nmore mature age, wherein I had the happiness to know him, he had taken a\ndesign like this of mine, to commit his thoughts to writing, we should\nhave seen a great many rare things, and such as would have gone very near\nto have rivalled the best writings of antiquity: for in natural parts\nespecially, I know no man comparable to him.  But he has left nothing\nbehind him, save this treatise only (and that too by chance, for I\nbelieve he never saw it after it first went out of his hands), and some\nobservations upon that edict of January--[1562, which granted to the\nHuguenots the public exercise of their religion.]--made famous by our\ncivil-wars, which also shall elsewhere, peradventure, find a place.\nThese were all I could recover of his remains, I to whom with so\naffectionate a remembrance, upon his death-bed, he by his last will\nbequeathed his library and papers, the little book of his works only\nexcepted, which I committed to the press.  And this particular obligation\nI have to this treatise of his, that it was the occasion of my first\ncoming acquainted with him; for it was showed to me long before I had the\ngood fortune to know him; and the first knowledge of his name, proving\nthe first cause and foundation of a friendship, which we afterwards\nimproved and maintained, so long as God was pleased to continue us\ntogether, so perfect, inviolate, and entire, that certainly the like is\nhardly to be found in story, and amongst the men of this age, there is no\nsign nor trace of any such thing in use; so much concurrence is required\nto the building of such a one, that 'tis much, if fortune bring it but\nonce to pass in three ages.\nThere is nothing to which nature seems so much to have inclined us, as to\nsociety; and Aristotle , says that the good legislators had more respect\nto friendship than to justice.  Now the most supreme point of its\nperfection is this: for, generally, all those that pleasure, profit,\npublic or private interest create and nourish, are so much the less\nbeautiful and generous, and so much the less friendships, by how much\nthey mix another cause, and design, and fruit in friendship, than itself.\nNeither do the four ancient kinds, natural, social, hospitable, venereal,\neither separately or jointly, make up a true and perfect friendship.\nThat of children to parents is rather respect: friendship is nourished by\ncommunication, which cannot by reason of the great disparity, be betwixt\nthese, but would rather perhaps offend the duties of nature; for neither\nare all the secret thoughts of fathers fit to be communicated to\nchildren, lest it beget an indecent familiarity betwixt them; nor can the\nadvices and reproofs, which is one of the principal offices of\nfriendship, be properly performed by the son to the father.  There are\nsome countries where 'twas the custom for children to kill their fathers;\nand others, where the fathers killed their children, to avoid their being\nan impediment one to another in life; and naturally the expectations of\nthe one depend upon the ruin of the other.  There have been great\nphilosophers who have made nothing of this tie of nature, as Aristippus\nfor one, who being pressed home about the affection he owed to his\nchildren, as being come out of him, presently fell to spit, saying, that\nthis also came out of him, and that we also breed worms and lice; and\nthat other, that Plutarch endeavoured to reconcile to his brother:\n\"I make never the more account of him,\" said he, \"for coming out of the\nsame hole.\"  This name of brother does indeed carry with it a fine and\ndelectable sound, and for that reason, he and I called one another\nbrothers but the complication of interests, the division of estates, and\nthat the wealth of the one should be the property of the other, strangely\nrelax and weaken the fraternal tie: brothers pursuing their fortune and\nadvancement by the same path, 'tis hardly possible but they must of\nnecessity often jostle and hinder one another.  Besides, why is it\nnecessary that the correspondence of manners, parts, and inclinations,\nwhich begets the true and perfect friendships, should always meet in\nthese relations?  The father and the son may be of quite contrary\nhumours, and so of brothers: he is my son, he is my brother; but he is\npassionate, ill-natured, or a fool.  And moreover, by how much these are\nfriendships that the law and natural obligation impose upon us, so much\nless is there of our own choice and voluntary freedom; whereas that\nvoluntary liberty of ours has no production more promptly and; properly\nits own than affection and friendship.  Not that I have not in my own\nperson experimented all that can possibly be expected of that kind,\nhaving had the best and most indulgent father, even to his extreme old\nage, that ever was, and who was himself descended from a family for many\ngenerations famous and exemplary for brotherly concord:\n\"Et ipse\nNotus in fratres animi paterni.\"\n[\"And I myself, known for paternal love toward my brothers.\"\n--Horace, Ode, ii. 2, 6.]\nWe are not here to bring the love we bear to women, though it be an act\nof our own choice, into comparison, nor rank it with the others.  The\nfire of this, I confess,\n\"Neque enim est dea nescia nostri\nQux dulcem curis miscet amaritiem,\"\n[\"Nor is the goddess unknown to me who mixes a sweet bitterness\nwith my love.\"---Catullus, lxviii. 17.]\nis more active, more eager, and more sharp: but withal, 'tis more\nprecipitant, fickle, moving, and inconstant; a fever subject to\nintermissions and paroxysms, that has seized but on one part of us.\nWhereas in friendship, 'tis a general and universal fire, but temperate\nand equal, a constant established heat, all gentle and smooth, without\npoignancy or roughness.  Moreover, in love, 'tis no other than frantic\ndesire for that which flies from us:\n\"Come segue la lepre il cacciatore\nAl freddo, al caldo, alla montagna, al lito;\nNe piu l'estima poi the presa vede;\nE sol dietro a chi fugge affretta il piede\"\n[\"As the hunter pursues the hare, in cold and heat, to the mountain,\nto the shore, nor cares for it farther when he sees it taken, and\nonly delights in chasing that which flees from him.\"--Aristo, x. 7.]\nso soon as it enters unto the terms of friendship, that is to say, into a\nconcurrence of desires, it vanishes and is gone, fruition destroys it,\nas having only a fleshly end, and such a one as is subject to satiety.\nFriendship, on the contrary, is enjoyed proportionably as it is desired;\nand only grows up, is nourished and improved by enjoyment, as being of\nitself spiritual, and the soul growing still more refined by practice.\nUnder this perfect friendship, the other fleeting affections have in my\nyounger years found some place in me, to say nothing of him, who himself\nso confesses but too much in his verses; so that I had both these\npassions, but always so, that I could myself well enough distinguish\nthem, and never in any degree of comparison with one another; the first\nmaintaining its flight in so lofty and so brave a place, as with disdain\nto look down, and see the other flying at a far humbler pitch below.\nAs concerning marriage, besides that it is a covenant, the entrance into\nwhich only is free, but the continuance in it forced and compulsory,\nhaving another dependence than that of our own free will, and a bargain\ncommonly contracted to other ends, there almost always happens a thousand\nintricacies in it to unravel, enough to break the thread and to divert\nthe current of a lively affection: whereas friendship has no manner of\nbusiness or traffic with aught but itself.  Moreover, to say truth, the\nordinary talent of women is not such as is sufficient to maintain the\nconference and communication required to the support of this sacred tie;\nnor do they appear to be endued with constancy of mind, to sustain the\npinch of so hard and durable a knot.  And doubtless, if without this,\nthere could be such a free and voluntary familiarity contracted, where\nnot only the souls might have this entire fruition, but the bodies also\nmight share in the alliance, and a man be engaged throughout, the\nfriendship would certainly be more full and perfect; but it is without\nexample that this sex has ever yet arrived at such perfection; and, by\nthe common consent of the ancient schools, it is wholly rejected from it.\nThat other Grecian licence is justly abhorred by our manners, which also,\nfrom having, according to their practice, a so necessary disparity of age\nand difference of offices betwixt the lovers, answered no more to the\nperfect union and harmony that we here require than the other:\n\"Quis est enim iste amor amicitiae? cur neque deformem\nadolescentem quisquam amat, neque formosum senem?\"\n[\"For what is that friendly love? why does no one love a deformed\nyouth or a comely old man?\"--Cicero, Tusc.  Quaes., iv. 33.]\nNeither will that very picture that the Academy presents of it, as I\nconceive, contradict me, when I say, that this first fury inspired by the\nson of Venus into the heart of the lover, upon sight of the flower and\nprime of a springing and blossoming youth, to which they allow all the\ninsolent and passionate efforts that an immoderate ardour can produce,\nwas simply founded upon external beauty, the false image of corporal\ngeneration; for it could not ground this love upon the soul, the sight of\nwhich as yet lay concealed, was but now springing, and not of maturity to\nblossom; that this fury, if it seized upon a low spirit, the means by\nwhich it preferred its suit were rich presents, favour in advancement to\ndignities, and such trumpery, which they by no means approve; if on a\nmore generous soul, the pursuit was suitably generous, by philosophical\ninstructions, precepts to revere religion, to obey the laws, to die for\nthe good of one's country; by examples of valour, prudence, and justice,\nthe lover studying to render himself acceptable by the grace and beauty\nof the soul, that of his body being long since faded and decayed, hoping\nby this mental society to establish a more firm and lasting contract.\nWhen this courtship came to effect in due season (for that which they do\nnot require in the lover, namely, leisure and discretion in his pursuit,\nthey strictly require in the person loved, forasmuch as he is to judge of\nan internal beauty, of difficult knowledge and abstruse discovery), then\nthere sprung in the person loved the desire of a spiritual conception;\nby the mediation of a spiritual beauty.  This was the principal; the\ncorporeal, an accidental and secondary matter; quite the contrary as to\nthe lover.  For this reason they prefer the person beloved, maintaining\nthat the gods in like manner preferred him too, and very much blame the\npoet AEschylus for having, in the loves of Achilles and Patroclus, given\nthe lover's part to Achilles, who was in the first and beardless flower\nof his adolescence, and the handsomest of all the Greeks.  After this\ngeneral community, the sovereign, and most worthy part presiding and\ngoverning, and performing its proper offices, they say, that thence great\nutility was derived, both by private and public concerns; that it\nconstituted the force and power of the countries where it prevailed, and\nthe chiefest security of liberty and justice.  Of which the healthy loves\nof Harmodius and Aristogiton are instances.  And therefore it is that\nthey called it sacred and divine, and conceive that nothing but the\nviolence of tyrants and the baseness of the common people are inimical to\nit.  Finally, all that can be said in favour of the Academy is, that it\nwas a love which ended in friendship, which well enough agrees with the\nStoical definition of love:\n\"Amorem conatum esse amicitiae faciendae\nex pulchritudinis specie.\"\n[\"Love is a desire of contracting friendship arising from the beauty\nof the object.\"--Cicero, Tusc. Quaes., vi. 34.]\nI return to my own more just and true description:\n\"Omnino amicitiae, corroboratis jam confirmatisque,\net ingeniis, et aetatibus, judicandae sunt.\"\n[\"Those are only to be reputed friendships that are fortified and\nconfirmed by judgement and the length of time.\"\n--Cicero, De Amicit., c. 20.]\nFor the rest, what we commonly call friends and friendships, are nothing\nbut acquaintance and familiarities, either occasionally contracted, or\nupon some design, by means of which there happens some little intercourse\nbetwixt our souls.  But in the friendship I speak of, they mix and work\nthemselves into one piece, with so universal a mixture, that there is no\nmore sign of the seam by which they were first conjoined.  If a man\nshould importune me to give a reason why I loved him, I find it could no\notherwise be expressed, than by making answer: because it was he, because\nit was I.  There is, beyond all that I am able to say, I know not what\ninexplicable and fated power that brought on this union.  We sought one\nanother long before we met, and by the characters we heard of one\nanother, which wrought upon our affections more than, in reason, mere\nreports should do; I think 'twas by some secret appointment of heaven.\nWe embraced in our names; and at our first meeting, which was\naccidentally at a great city entertainment, we found ourselves so\nmutually taken with one another, so acquainted, and so endeared betwixt\nourselves, that from thenceforward nothing was so near to us as one\nanother.  He wrote an excellent Latin satire, since printed, wherein he\nexcuses the precipitation of our intelligence, so suddenly come to\nperfection, saying, that destined to have so short a continuance, as\nbegun so late (for we were both full-grown men, and he some years the\nolder), there was no time to lose, nor were we tied to conform to the\nexample of those slow and regular friendships, that require so many\nprecautions of long preliminary conversation: This has no other idea than\nthat of itself, and can only refer to itself: this is no one special\nconsideration, nor two, nor three, nor four, nor a thousand; 'tis I know\nnot what quintessence of all this mixture, which, seizing my whole will,\ncarried it to plunge and lose itself in his, and that having seized his\nwhole will, brought it back with equal concurrence and appetite to plunge\nand lose itself in mine.  I may truly say lose, reserving nothing to\nourselves that was either his or mine.--[All this relates to Estienne de\nla Boetie.]\nWhen Laelius,--[Cicero, De Amicit., c. II.]--in the presence of the\nRoman consuls, who after thay had sentenced Tiberius Gracchus, prosecuted\nall those who had had any familiarity with him also; came to ask Caius\nBlosius, who was his chiefest friend, how much he would have done for\nhim, and that he made answer:  \"All things.\"--\"How!  All things!\"  said\nLaelius.  \"And what if he had commanded you to fire our temples?\"--\"He\nwould never have commanded me that,\" replied Blosius.--\"But what if he\nhad?\" said Laelius.--\"I would have obeyed him,\" said the other.  If he\nwas so perfect a friend to Gracchus as the histories report him to have\nbeen, there was yet no necessity of offending the consuls by such a bold\nconfession, though he might still have retained the assurance he had of\nGracchus' disposition.  However, those who accuse this answer as\nseditious, do not well understand the mystery; nor presuppose, as it was\ntrue, that he had Gracchus' will in his sleeve, both by the power of a\nfriend, and the perfect knowledge he had of the man: they were more\nfriends than citizens, more friends to one another than either enemies or\nfriends to their country, or than friends to ambition and innovation;\nhaving absolutely given up themselves to one another, either held\nabsolutely the reins of the other's inclination; and suppose all this\nguided by virtue, and all this by the conduct of reason, which also\nwithout these it had not been possible to do, Blosius' answer was such as\nit ought to be.  If any of their actions flew out of the handle, they\nwere neither (according to my measure of friendship) friends to one\nanother, nor to themselves.  As to the rest, this answer carries no worse\nsound, than mine would do to one that should ask me: \"If your will should\ncommand you to kill your daughter, would you do it?\" and that I should\nmake answer, that I would; for this expresses no consent to such an act,\nforasmuch as I do not in the least suspect my own will, and as little\nthat of such a friend.  'Tis not in the power of all the eloquence in the\nworld, to dispossess me of the certainty I have of the intentions and\nresolutions of my friend; nay, no one action of his, what face soever it\nmight bear, could be presented to me, of which I could not presently,\nand at first sight, find out the moving cause.  Our souls had drawn so\nunanimously together, they had considered each other with so ardent an\naffection, and with the like affection laid open the very bottom of our\nhearts to one another's view, that I not only knew his as well as my own;\nbut should certainly in any concern of mine have trusted my interest much\nmore willingly with him, than with myself.\nLet no one, therefore, rank other common friendships with such a one as\nthis.  I have had as much experience of these as another, and of the most\nperfect of their kind: but I do not advise that any should confound the\nrules of the one and the other, for they would find themselves much\ndeceived.  In those other ordinary friendships, you are to walk with\nbridle in your hand, with prudence and circumspection, for in them the\nknot is not so sure that a man may not half suspect it will slip.  \"Love\nhim,\" said Chilo,--[Aulus Gellius, i. 3.]--\"so as if you were one day to\nhate him; and hate him so as you were one day to love him.\"  This\nprecept, though abominable in the sovereign and perfect friendship I\nspeak of, is nevertheless very sound as to the practice of the ordinary\nand customary ones, and to which the saying that Aristotle had so\nfrequent in his mouth, \"O my friends, there is no friend,\" may very fitly\nbe applied.  In this noble commerce, good offices, presents, and\nbenefits, by which other friendships are supported and maintained, do not\ndeserve so much as to be mentioned; and the reason is the concurrence of\nour wills; for, as the kindness I have for myself receives no increase,\nfor anything I relieve myself withal in time of need (whatever the Stoics\nsay), and as I do not find myself obliged to myself for any service I do\nmyself: so the union of such friends, being truly perfect, deprives them\nof all idea of such duties, and makes them loathe and banish from their\nconversation these words of division and distinction, benefits,\nobligation, acknowledgment, entreaty, thanks, and the like.  All things,\nwills, thoughts, opinions, goods, wives, children, honours, and lives,\nbeing in effect common betwixt them, and that absolute concurrence of\naffections being no other than one soul in two bodies (according to that\nvery proper definition of Aristotle), they can neither lend nor give\nanything to one another.  This is the reason why the lawgivers, to honour\nmarriage with some resemblance of this divine alliance, interdict all\ngifts betwixt man and wife; inferring by that, that all should belong to\neach of them, and that they have nothing to divide or to give to each\nother.\nIf, in the friendship of which I speak, one could give to the other, the\nreceiver of the benefit would be the man that obliged his friend; for\neach of them contending and above all things studying how to be useful to\nthe other, he that administers the occasion is the liberal man, in giving\nhis friend the satisfaction of doing that towards him which above all\nthings he most desires.  When the philosopher Diogenes wanted money, he\nused to say, that he redemanded it of his friends, not that he demanded\nit.  And to let you see the practical working of this, I will here\nproduce an ancient and singular example.  Eudamidas, a Corinthian, had\ntwo friends, Charixenus a Sicyonian and Areteus a Corinthian; this man\ncoming to die, being poor, and his two friends rich, he made his will\nafter this manner.  \"I bequeath to Areteus the maintenance of my mother,\nto support and provide for her in her old age; and to Charixenus I\nbequeath the care of marrying my daughter, and to give her as good a\nportion as he is able; and in case one of these chance to die, I hereby\nsubstitute the survivor in his place.\"  They who first saw this will made\nthemselves very merry at the contents: but the legatees, being made\nacquainted with it, accepted it with very great content; and one of them,\nCharixenus, dying within five days after, and by that means the charge of\nboth duties devolving solely on him, Areteus nurtured the old woman with\nvery great care and tenderness, and of five talents he had in estate, he\ngave two and a half in marriage with an only daughter he had of his own,\nand two and a half in marriage with the daughter of Eudamidas, and on one\nand the same day solemnised both their nuptials.\nThis example is very full, if one thing were not to be objected, namely\nthe multitude of friends for the perfect friendship I speak of is\nindivisible; each one gives himself so entirely to his friend, that he\nhas nothing left to distribute to others: on the contrary, is sorry that\nhe is not double, treble, or quadruple, and that he has not many souls\nand many wills, to confer them all upon this one object.  Common\nfriendships will admit of division; one may love the beauty of this\nperson, the good-humour of that, the liberality of a third, the paternal\naffection of a fourth, the fraternal love of a fifth, and so of the rest:\nbut this friendship that possesses the whole soul, and there rules and\nsways with an absolute sovereignty, cannot possibly admit of a rival.\nIf two at the same time should call to you for succour, to which of them\nwould you run?  Should they require of you contrary offices, how could\nyou serve them both?  Should one commit a thing to your silence that it\nwere of importance to the other to know, how would you disengage\nyourself?  A unique and particular friendship dissolves all other\nobligations whatsoever: the secret I have sworn not to reveal to any\nother, I may without perjury communicate to him who is not another, but\nmyself.  'Tis miracle enough certainly, for a man to double himself, and\nthose that talk of tripling, talk they know not of what.  Nothing is\nextreme, that has its like; and he who shall suppose, that of two, I love\none as much as the other, that they mutually love one another too, and\nlove me as much as I love them, multiplies into a confraternity the most\nsingle of units, and whereof, moreover, one alone is the hardest thing in\nthe world to find.  The rest of this story suits very well with what I\nwas saying; for Eudamidas, as a bounty and favour, bequeaths to his\nfriends a legacy of employing themselves in his necessity; he leaves them\nheirs to this liberality of his, which consists in giving them the\nopportunity of conferring a benefit upon him; and doubtless, the force of\nfriendship is more eminently apparent in this act of his, than in that of\nAreteus.  In short, these are effects not to be imagined nor comprehended\nby such as have not experience of them, and which make me infinitely\nhonour and admire the answer of that young soldier to Cyrus, by whom\nbeing asked how much he would take for a horse, with which he had won the\nprize of a race, and whether he would exchange him for a kingdom?\n--\"No, truly, sir,\" said he, \"but I would give him with all my heart,\nto get thereby a true friend, could I find out any man worthy of that\nalliance.\"--[Xenophon, Cyropadia, viii.  3.]--He did not say ill in\nsaying, \"could I find\": for though one may almost everywhere meet with\nmen sufficiently qualified for a superficial acquaintance, yet in this,\nwhere a man is to deal from the very bottom of his heart, without any\nmanner of reservation, it will be requisite that all the wards and\nsprings be truly wrought and perfectly sure.\nIn confederations that hold but by one end, we are only to provide\nagainst the imperfections that particularly concern that end.  It can be\nof no importance to me of what religion my physician or my lawyer is;\nthis consideration has nothing in common with the offices of friendship\nwhich they owe me; and I am of the same indifference in the domestic\nacquaintance my servants must necessarily contract with me.  I never\ninquire, when I am to take a footman, if he be chaste, but if he be\ndiligent; and am not solicitous if my muleteer be given to gaming, as if\nhe be strong and able; or if my cook be a swearer, if he be a good cook.\nI do not take upon me to direct what other men should do in the\ngovernment of their families, there are plenty that meddle enough with\nthat, but only give an account of my method in my own:\n\"Mihi sic usus est: tibi, ut opus est facto, face.\"\n[\"This has been my way; as for you, do as you find needful.\n--\"Terence, Heaut., i. I., 28.]\nFor table-talk, I prefer the pleasant and witty before the learned and\nthe grave; in bed, beauty before goodness; in common discourse the ablest\nspeaker, whether or no there be sincerity in the case.  And, as he that\nwas found astride upon a hobby-horse, playing with his children,\nentreated the person who had surprised him in that posture to say nothing\nof it till himself came to be a father,--[Plutarch, Life of Agesilaus,\nc.  9.]--supposing that the fondness that would then possess his own\nsoul, would render him a fairer judge of such an action; so I, also,\ncould wish to speak to such as have had experience of what I say: though,\nknowing how remote a thing such a friendship is from the common practice,\nand how rarely it is to be found, I despair of meeting with any such\njudge.  For even these discourses left us by antiquity upon this subject,\nseem to me flat and poor, in comparison of the sense I have of it, and in\nthis particular, the effects surpass even the precepts of philosophy.\n\"Nil ego contulerim jucundo sanus amico.\"\n[\"While I have sense left to me, there will never be anything more\nacceptable to me than an agreeable friend.\"\n--Horace, Sat., i. 5, 44.]\nThe ancient Menander declared him to be happy that had had the good\nfortune to meet with but the shadow of a friend: and doubtless he had\ngood reason to say so, especially if he spoke by experience: for in good\nearnest, if I compare all the rest of my life, though, thanks be to God,\nI have passed my time pleasantly enough, and at my ease, and the loss of\nsuch a friend excepted, free from any grievous affliction, and in great\ntranquillity of mind, having been contented with my natural and original\ncommodities, without being solicitous after others; if I should compare\nit all, I say, with the four years I had the happiness to enjoy the sweet\nsociety of this excellent man, 'tis nothing but smoke, an obscure and\ntedious night.  From the day that I lost him:\n\"Quern semper acerbum,\nSemper honoratum (sic, di, voluistis) habebo,\"\n[\"A day for me ever sad, for ever sacred, so have you willed ye\ngods.\"--AEneid, v. 49.]\nI have only led a languishing life; and the very pleasures that present\nthemselves to me, instead of administering anything of consolation,\ndouble my affliction for his loss.  We were halves throughout, and to\nthat degree, that methinks, by outliving him, I defraud him of his part.\n\"Nec fas esse ulla me voluptate hic frui\nDecrevi, tantisper dum ille abest meus particeps.\"\n[\"I have determined that it will never be right for me to enjoy any\npleasure, so long as he, with whom I shared all pleasures is away.\"\n--Terence, Heaut., i. I. 97.]\nI was so grown and accustomed to be always his double in all places and\nin all things, that methinks I am no more than half of myself:\n\"Illam meae si partem anima tulit\nMaturior vis, quid moror altera?\nNec carus aeque, nec superstes\nInteger?

The edition of 1580, however, and the\nVariorum edition of 1872-1900, indicate no particular work; but the\nedition of 1580 has it \"this boy of eighteen years\" (which was the\nage at which La Boetie wrote his \"Servitude Volontaire\"), speaks of\n\"a boy of sixteen\" as occurring only in the common editions, and it\nwould seem tolerably clear that this more important work was, in\nfact, the production to which Montaigne refers, and that the proper\nreading of the text should be \"sixteen years.\"  What \"this boy\nspoke\" is not given by Montaigne, for the reason stated in the next\nfollowing paragraph.]\n\"Because I have found that that work has been since brought out, and with\na mischievous design, by those who aim at disturbing and changing the\ncondition of our government, without troubling themselves to think\nwhether they are likely to improve it: and because they have mixed up his\nwork with some of their own performance, I have refrained from inserting\nit here.  But that the memory of the author may not be injured, nor\nsuffer with such as could not come near-hand to be acquainted with his\nprinciples, I here give them to understand, that it was written by him in\nhis boyhood, and that by way of exercise only, as a common theme that has\nbeen hackneyed by a thousand writers.  I make no question but that he\nhimself believed what he wrote, being so conscientious that he would not\nso much as lie in jest: and I moreover know, that could it have been in\nhis own choice, he had rather have been born at Venice, than at Sarlac;\nand with reason.  But he had another maxim sovereignty imprinted in his\nsoul, very religiously to obey and submit to the laws under which he was\nborn.  There never was a better citizen, more affectionate to his\ncountry; nor a greater enemy to all the commotions and innovations of his\ntime: so that he would much rather have employed his talent to the\nextinguishing of those civil flames, than have added any fuel to them;\nhe had a mind fashioned to the model of better ages.  Now, in exchange of\nthis serious piece, I will present you with another of a more gay and\nfrolic air, from the same hand, and written at the same age.\"\nCHAPTER XXVIII.\nNINE AND TWENTY SONNETS OF ESTIENNE DE LA BOITIE\nTO MADAME DE GRAMMONT, COMTESSE DE GUISSEN.\n[They scarce contain anything but amorous complaints, expressed in a\nvery rough style, discovering the follies and outrages of a restless\npassion, overgorged, as it were, with jealousies, fears and\nsuspicions.--Coste.]\n[These....contained in the edition of 1588 nine-and-twenty sonnets\nof La Boetie, accompanied by a dedicatory epistle to Madame de\nGrammont.  The former, which are referred to at the end of Chap.\nXXVIL, do not really belong to the book, and are of very slight\ninterest at this time; the epistle is transferred to the\nCorrespondence.  The sonnets, with the letter, were presumably sent\nsome time after Letters V. et seq.  Montaigne seems to have had\nseveral copies written out to forward to friends or acquaintances.]\nCHAPTER XXIX.\nOF MODERATION\nAs if we had an infectious touch, we, by our manner of handling, corrupt\nthings that in themselves are laudable and good: we may grasp virtue so\nthat it becomes vicious, if we embrace it too stringently and with too\nviolent a desire.  Those who say, there is never any excess in virtue,\nforasmuch as it is not virtue when it once becomes excess, only play upon\nwords:\n\"Insani sapiens nomen ferat, aequus iniqui,\nUltra quam satis est, virtutem si petat ipsam.\"\n[\"Let the wise man bear the name of a madman, the just one of an\nunjust, if he seek wisdom more than is sufficient.\"\n--Horace, Ep., i. 6, 15.]\n[\"The wise man is no longer wise, the just man no longer just, if he\nseek to carry his love for wisdom or virtue beyond that which is\nnecessary.\"]\nThis is a subtle consideration of philosophy.  A man may both be too much\nin love with virtue, and be excessive in a just action.  Holy Writ agrees\nwith this, Be not wiser than you should, but be soberly wise.--[St.\nPaul, Epistle to the Romans, xii. 3.]--I have known a great man,\n--[\"It is likely that Montaigne meant Henry III., king of France.\nThe Cardinal d'Ossat, writing to Louise, the queen-dowager, told\nher, in his frank manner, that he had lived as much or more like a\nmonk than a monarch (Letter XXIII.) And Pope Sextus V., speaking of\nthat prince one day to the Cardinal de Joyeuse, protector of the\naffairs of France, said to him pleasantly, 'There is nothing that\nyour king hath not done, and does not do so still, to be a monk, nor\nanything that I have not done, not to be a monk.'\"--Coste.]\nprejudice the opinion men had of his devotion, by pretending to be devout\nbeyond all examples of others of his condition.  I love temperate and\nmoderate natures.  An immoderate zeal, even to that which is good, even\nthough it does not offend, astonishes me, and puts me to study what name\nto give it.  Neither the mother of Pausanias,\n--[\"Montaigne would here give us to understand, upon the authority of\nDiodorus Siculus, that Pausanias' mother gave the first hint of the\npunishment that was to be inflicted on her son.  'Pausanias,' says\nthis historian, 'perceiving that the ephori, and some other\nLacedoemonians, aimed at apprehending him, got the start of them,\nand went and took sanctuary m Minerva's temple: and the\nLacedaemonians, being doubtful whether they ought to take him from\nthence in violation of the franchise there, it is said that his own\nmother came herself to the temple but spoke nothing nor did anything\nmore than lay a piece of brick, which she brought with her, on the\nthreshold of the temple, which, when she had done, she returned\nhome.  The Lacedaemonians, taking the hint from the mother, caused\nthe gate of the temple to be walled up, and by this means starved\nPausanias, so that he died with hunger, &c. (lib. xi. cap. 10., of\nAmyot's translation).  The name of Pausanias' mother was Alcithea,\nas we are informed by Thucydides' scholiast, who only says that it\nwas reported, that when they set about walling up the gates of the\nchapel in which Pausanias had taken refuge, his mother Alcithea laid\nthe first stone.\"--Coste.]\nwho was the first instructor of her son's process, and threw the first\nstone towards his death, nor Posthumius the dictator, who put his son to\ndeath, whom the ardour of youth had successfully pushed upon the enemy a\nlittle more advanced than the rest of his squadron, do appear to me so\nmuch just as strange; and I should neither advise nor like to follow so\nsavage a virtue, and that costs so dear.\n--[\"Opinions differ as to the truth of this fact.  Livy thinks he\nhas good authority for rejecting it because it does not appear in\nhistory that Posthumious was branded with it, as Titus Manlius was,\nabout 100 years after his time; for Manlius, having put his son to\ndeath for the like cause, obtained the odious name of Imperiosus,\nand since that time Manliana imperia has been used as a term to\nsignify orders that are too severe; Manliana Imperia, says Livy,\nwere not only horrible for the time present, but of a bad example to\nposterity.  And this historian makes no doubt but such commands\nwould have been actually styled Posthumiana Imperia, if Posthumius\nhad been the first who set so barbarous an example (Livy, lib. iv.\ncap. 29, and lib. viii. cap. 7).  But, however, Montaigne has Valer.\nMaximus on his side, who says expressly, that Posthumius caused his\nson to be put to death, and Diodorus of Sicily (lib.  xii.  cap.\n19).\"--Coste.]\nThe archer that shoots over, misses as much as he that falls short, and\n'tis equally troublesome to my sight, to look up at a great light, and\nto look down into a dark abyss.  Callicles in Plato says, that the\nextremity of philosophy is hurtful, and advises not to dive into it\nbeyond the limits of profit; that, taken moderately, it is pleasant and\nuseful; but that in the end it renders a man brutish and vicious, a\ncontemner of religion and the common laws, an enemy to civil\nconversation, and all human pleasures, incapable of all public\nadministration, unfit either to assist others or to relieve himself, and\na fit object for all sorts of injuries and affronts.  He says true; for\nin its excess, it enslaves our natural freedom, and by an impertinent\nsubtlety, leads us out of the fair and beaten way that nature has traced\nfor us.\nThe love we bear to our wives is very lawful, and yet theology thinks fit\nto curb and restrain it.  As I remember, I have read in one place of St.\nThomas Aquinas,--[Secunda Secundx, Quaest. 154, art. 9.]--where he\ncondemns marriages within any of the forbidden degrees, for this reason,\namongst others, that there is some danger, lest the friendship a man\nbears to such a woman, should be immoderate; for if the conjugal\naffection be full and perfect betwixt them, as it ought to be, and that\nit be over and above surcharged with that of kindred too, there is no\ndoubt, but such an addition will carry the husband beyond the bounds of\nreason.\nThose sciences that regulate the manners of men, divinity and philosophy,\nwill have their say in everything; there is no action so private and\nsecret that can escape their inspection and jurisdiction.  They are best\ntaught who are best able to control and curb their own liberty; women\nexpose their nudities as much as you will upon the account of pleasure,\nthough in the necessities of physic they are altogether as shy.  I will,\ntherefore, in their behalf:\n--[Coste translates this: \"on the part of philosophy and theology,\"\nobserving that but few wives would think themselves obliged to\nMontaigne for any such lesson to their husbands.]--\nteach the husbands, that is, such as are too vehement in the exercise of\nthe matrimonial duty--if such there still be--this lesson, that the very\npleasures they enjoy in the society of their wives are reproachable if\nimmoderate, and that a licentious and riotous abuse of them is a fault as\nreprovable here as in illicit connections.  Those immodest and debauched\ntricks and postures, that the first ardour suggests to us in this affair,\nare not only indecently but detrimentally practised upon our wives.  Let\nthem at least learn impudence from another hand; they are ever ready\nenough for our business, and I for my part always went the plain way to\nwork.\nMarriage is a solemn and religious tie, and therefore the pleasure we\nextract from it should be a sober and serious delight, and mixed with a\ncertain kind of gravity; it should be a sort of discreet and\nconscientious pleasure.  And seeing that the chief end of it is\ngeneration, some make a question, whether when men are out of hopes as\nwhen they are superannuated or already with child, it be lawful to\nembrace our wives.  'Tis homicide, according to Plato.--[Laws, 8.]--\nCertain nations (the Mohammedan, amongst others) abominate all conjunction\nwith women with child, others also, with those who are in their courses.\nZenobia would never admit her husband for more than one encounter, after\nwhich she left him to his own swing for the whole time of her conception,\nand not till after that would again receive him:--[Trebellius Pollio,\nTriginta Tyran., c. 30.]--a brave and generous example of conjugal\ncontinence.  It was doubtless from some lascivious poet,--[The lascivious\npoet is Homer; see his Iliad, xiv.  294.]--and one that himself was in\ngreat distress for a little of this sport, that Plato borrowed this\nstory; that Jupiter was one day so hot upon his wife, that not having so\nmuch patience as till she could get to the couch, he threw her upon the\nfloor, where the vehemence of pleasure made him forget the great and\nimportant resolutions he had but newly taken with the rest of the gods in\nhis celestial council, and to brag that he had had as good a bout, as\nwhen he got her maidenhead, unknown to their parents.\nThe kings of Persia were wont to invite their wives to the beginning of\ntheir festivals; but when the wine began to work in good earnest, and\nthat they were to give the reins to pleasure, they sent them back to\ntheir private apartments, that they might not participate in their\nimmoderate lust, sending for other women in their stead, with whom they\nwere not obliged to so great a decorum of respect.--[Plutarch, Precepts\nof Marriage, c.  14.]--All pleasures and all sorts of gratifications\nare not properly and fitly conferred upon all sorts of persons.\nEpaminondas had committed to prison a young man for certain debauches;\nfor whom Pelopidas mediated, that at his request he might be set at\nliberty, which Epaminondas denied to him, but granted it at the first\nword to a wench of his, that made the same intercession; saying, that it\nwas a gratification fit for such a one as she, but not for a captain.\nSophocles being joint praetor with Pericles, seeing accidentally a fine\nboy pass by: \"O what a charming boy is that!\" said he.  \"That might be\nvery well,\" answered Pericles, \"for any other than a praetor, who ought\nnot only to have his hands, but his eyes, too, chaste.\"--[Cicero, De\nOffic., i. 40.]  AElius Verus, the emperor, answered his wife, who\nreproached him with his love to other women, that he did it upon a\nconscientious account, forasmuch as marriage was a name of honour and\ndignity, not of wanton and lascivious desire; and our ecclesiastical\nhistory preserves the memory of that woman in great veneration, who\nparted from her husband because she would not comply with his indecent\nand inordinate desires.  In fine, there is no pleasure so just and\nlawful, where intemperance and excess are not to be condemned.\nBut, to speak the truth, is not man a most miserable creature the while?\nIt is scarce, by his natural condition, in his power to taste one\npleasure pure and entire; and yet must he be contriving doctrines and\nprecepts to curtail that little he has; he is not yet wretched enough,\nunless by art and study he augment his own misery:\n\"Fortunae miseras auximus arte vias.\"\n[\"We artificially augment the wretchedness of fortune.\"\n--Properitius, lib. iii. 7, 44.]\nHuman wisdom makes as ill use of her talent, when she exercises it in\nrescinding from the number and sweetness of those pleasures that are\nnaturally our due, as she employs it favourably and well in artificially\ndisguising and tricking out the ills of life, to alleviate the sense of\nthem.  Had I ruled the roast, I should have taken another and more\nnatural course, which, to say the truth, is both commodious and holy, and\nshould, peradventure, have been able to have limited it too;\nnotwithstanding that both our spiritual and corporal physicians, as by\ncompact betwixt themselves, can find no other way to cure, nor other\nremedy for the infirmities of the body and the soul, than by misery and\npain.  To this end, watchings, fastings, hair-shirts, remote and solitary\nbanishments, perpetual imprisonments, whips and other afflictions, have\nbeen introduced amongst men: but so, that they should carry a sting with\nthem, and be real afflictions indeed; and not fall out as it once did to\none Gallio, who having been sent an exile into the isle of Lesbos, news\nwas not long after brought to Rome, that he there lived as merry as the\nday was long; and that what had been enjoined him for a penance, turned\nto his pleasure and satisfaction: whereupon the Senate thought fit to\nrecall him home to his wife and family, and confine him to his own house,\nto accommodate their punishment to his feeling and apprehension.  For to\nhim whom fasting would make more healthful and more sprightly, and to him\nto whose palate fish were more acceptable than flesh, the prescription of\nthese would have no curative effect; no more than in the other sort of\nphysic, where drugs have no effect upon him who swallows them with\nappetite and pleasure: the bitterness of the potion and the abhorrence of\nthe patient are necessary circumstances to the operation.  The nature\nthat would eat rhubarb like buttered turnips, would frustrate the use and\nvirtue of it; it must be something to trouble and disturb the stomach,\nthat must purge and cure it; and here the common rule, that things are\ncured by their contraries, fails; for in this one ill is cured by\nanother.\nThis belief a little resembles that other so ancient one, of thinking to\ngratify the gods and nature by massacre and murder: an opinion\nuniversally once received in all religions.  And still, in these later\ntimes wherein our fathers lived, Amurath at the taking of the Isthmus,\nimmolated six hundred young Greeks to his father's soul, in the nature of\na propitiatory sacrifice for his sins.  And in those new countries\ndiscovered in this age of ours, which are pure and virgin yet, in\ncomparison of ours, this practice is in some measure everywhere received:\nall their idols reek with human blood, not without various examples of\nhorrid cruelty: some they burn alive, and take, half broiled, off the\ncoals to tear out their hearts and entrails; some, even women, they flay\nalive, and with their bloody skins clothe and disguise others.  Neither\nare we without great examples of constancy and resolution in this affair\nthe poor souls that are to be sacrificed, old men, women, and children,\nthemselves going about some days before to beg alms for the offering of\ntheir sacrifice, presenting themselves to the slaughter, singing and\ndancing with the spectators.\nThe ambassadors of the king of Mexico, setting out to Fernando Cortez the\npower and greatness of their master, after having told him, that he had\nthirty vassals, of whom each was able to raise an hundred thousand\nfighting men, and that he kept his court in the fairest and best\nfortified city under the sun, added at last, that he was obliged yearly\nto offer to the gods fifty thousand men.  And it is affirmed, that he\nmaintained a continual war, with some potent neighbouring nations, not\nonly to keep the young men in exercise, but principally to have\nwherewithal to furnish his sacrifices with his prisoners of war.  At a\ncertain town in another place, for the welcome of the said Cortez, they\nsacrificed fifty men at once.  I will tell you this one tale more, and I\nhave done; some of these people being beaten by him, sent to acknowledge\nhim, and to treat with him of a peace, whose messengers carried him three\nsorts of gifts, which they presented in these terms: \"Behold, lord, here\nare five slaves: if thou art a furious god that feedeth upon flesh and\nblood, eat these, and we will bring thee more; if thou art an affable\ngod, behold here incense and feathers; but if thou art a man, take these\nfowls and these fruits that we have brought thee.\"\nCHAPTER XXX\nOF CANNIBALS\nWhen King Pyrrhus invaded Italy, having viewed and considered the order\nof the army the Romans sent out to meet him; \"I know not,\" said he,\n\"what kind of barbarians\" (for so the Greeks called all other nations)\n\"these may be; but the disposition of this army that I see has nothing of\nbarbarism in it.\"--[Plutarch, Life of Pyrrhus, c. 8.]--As much said the\nGreeks of that which Flaminius brought into their country; and Philip,\nbeholding from an eminence the order and distribution of the Roman camp\nformed in his kingdom by Publius Sulpicius Galba, spake to the same\neffect.  By which it appears how cautious men ought to be of taking\nthings upon trust from vulgar opinion, and that we are to judge by the\neye of reason, and not from common report.\nI long had a man in my house that lived ten or twelve years in the New\nWorld, discovered in these latter days, and in that part of it where\nVillegaignon landed,--[At Brazil, in 1557.]--which he called Antarctic\nFrance.  This discovery of so vast a country seems to be of very great\nconsideration.  I cannot be sure, that hereafter there may not be\nanother, so many wiser men than we having been deceived in this.  I am\nafraid our eyes are bigger than our bellies, and that we have more\ncuriosity than capacity; for we grasp at all, but catch nothing but wind.\nPlato brings in Solon,--[In Timaeus.]--telling a story that he had\nheard from the priests of Sais in Egypt, that of old, and before the\nDeluge, there was a great island called Atlantis, situate directly at the\nmouth of the straits of Gibraltar, which contained more countries than\nboth Africa and Asia put together; and that the kings of that country,\nwho not only possessed that Isle, but extended their dominion so far into\nthe continent that they had a country of Africa as far as Egypt, and\nextending in Europe to Tuscany, attempted to encroach even upon Asia, and\nto subjugate all the nations that border upon the Mediterranean Sea, as\nfar as the Black Sea; and to that effect overran all Spain, the Gauls,\nand Italy, so far as to penetrate into Greece, where the Athenians\nstopped them: but that some time after, both the Athenians, and they and\ntheir island, were swallowed by the Flood.\nIt is very likely that this extreme irruption and inundation of water\nmade wonderful changes and alterations in the habitations of the earth,\nas 'tis said that the sea then divided Sicily from Italy--\n\"Haec loca, vi quondam et vasta convulsa ruina,\nDissiluisse ferunt, quum protenus utraque tellus\nUna foret\"\n[\"These lands, they say, formerly with violence and vast desolation\nconvulsed, burst asunder, where erewhile were.\"--AEneid, iii. 414.]\nCyprus from Syria, the isle of Negropont from the continent of Beeotia,\nand elsewhere united lands that were separate before, by filling up the\nchannel betwixt them with sand and mud:\n\"Sterilisque diu palus, aptaque remis,\nVicinas urbes alit, et grave sentit aratrum.\"\n[\"That which was once a sterile marsh, and bore vessels on its\nbosom, now feeds neighbouring cities, and admits the plough.\"\n--Horace, De Arte Poetica, v. 65.]\nBut there is no great appearance that this isle was this New World so\nlately discovered: for that almost touched upon Spain, and it were an\nincredible effect of an inundation, to have tumbled back so prodigious a\nmass, above twelve hundred leagues: besides that our modern navigators\nhave already almost discovered it to be no island, but terra firma, and\ncontinent with the East Indies on the one side, and with the lands under\nthe two poles on the other side; or, if it be separate from them, it is\nby so narrow a strait and channel, that it none the more deserves the\nname of an island for that.\nIt should seem, that in this great body, there are two sorts of motions,\nthe one natural and the other febrific, as there are in ours.  When I\nconsider the impression that our river of Dordogne has made in my time on\nthe right bank of its descent, and that in twenty years it has gained so\nmuch, and undermined the foundations of so many houses, I perceive it to\nbe an extraordinary agitation: for had it always followed this course,\nor were hereafter to do it, the aspect of the world would be totally\nchanged.  But rivers alter their course, sometimes beating against the\none side, and sometimes the other, and some times quietly keeping the\nchannel.  I do not speak of sudden inundations, the causes of which\neverybody understands.  In Medoc, by the seashore, the Sieur d'Arsac, my\nbrother, sees an estate he had there, buried under the sands which the\nsea vomits before it: where the tops of some houses are yet to be seen,\nand where his rents and domains are converted into pitiful barren\npasturage.  The inhabitants of this place affirm, that of late years the\nsea has driven so vehemently upon them, that they have lost above four\nleagues of land.  These sands are her harbingers: and we now see great\nheaps of moving sand, that march half a league before her, and occupy the\nland.\nThe other testimony from antiquity, to which some would apply this\ndiscovery of the New World, is in Aristotle; at least, if that little\nbook of Unheard of Miracles be his--[one of the spurious publications\nbrought out under his name--D.W.].  He there tells us, that certain\nCarthaginians, having crossed the Atlantic Sea without the Straits of\nGibraltar, and sailed a very long time, discovered at last a great and\nfruitful island, all covered over with wood, and watered with several\nbroad and deep rivers, far remote from all terra firma; and that they,\nand others after them, allured by the goodness and fertility of the soil,\nwent thither with their wives and children, and began to plant a colony.\nBut the senate of Carthage perceiving their people by little and little\nto diminish, issued out an express prohibition, that none, upon pain of\ndeath, should transport themselves thither; and also drove out these new\ninhabitants; fearing, 'tis said, lest' in process of time they should so\nmultiply as to supplant themselves and ruin their state.  But this\nrelation of Aristotle no more agrees with our new-found lands than the\nother.\nThis man that I had was a plain ignorant fellow, and therefore the more\nlikely to tell truth: for your better-bred sort of men are much more\ncurious in their observation, 'tis true, and discover a great deal more;\nbut then they gloss upon it, and to give the greater weight to what they\ndeliver, and allure your belief, they cannot forbear a little to alter\nthe story; they never represent things to you simply as they are, but\nrather as they appeared to them, or as they would have them appear to\nyou, and to gain the reputation of men of judgment, and the better to\ninduce your faith, are willing to help out the business with something\nmore than is really true, of their own invention.  Now in this case, we\nshould either have a man of irreproachable veracity, or so simple that he\nhas not wherewithal to contrive, and to give a colour of truth to false\nrelations, and who can have no ends in forging an untruth.  Such a one\nwas mine; and besides, he has at divers times brought to me several\nseamen and merchants who at the same time went the same voyage.  I shall\ntherefore content myself with his information, without inquiring what the\ncosmographers say to the business.  We should have topographers to trace\nout to us the particular places where they have been; but for having had\nthis advantage over us, to have seen the Holy Land, they would have the\nprivilege, forsooth, to tell us stories of all the other parts of the\nworld beside.  I would have every one write what he knows, and as much as\nhe knows, but no more; and that not in this only but in all other\nsubjects; for such a person may have some particular knowledge and\nexperience of the nature of such a river, or such a fountain, who, as to\nother things, knows no more than what everybody does, and yet to give a\ncurrency to his little pittance of learning, will undertake to write the\nwhole body of physics: a vice from which great inconveniences derive\ntheir original.\nNow, to return to my subject, I find that there is nothing barbarous and\nsavage in this nation, by anything that I can gather, excepting, that\nevery one gives the title of barbarism to everything that is not in use\nin his own country.  As, indeed, we have no other level of truth and\nreason than the example and idea of the opinions and customs of the place\nwherein we live: there is always the perfect religion, there the perfect\ngovernment, there the most exact and accomplished usage of all things.\nThey are savages at the same rate that we say fruits are wild, which\nnature produces of herself and by her own ordinary progress; whereas, in\ntruth, we ought rather to call those wild whose natures we have changed\nby our artifice and diverted from the common order.  In those, the\ngenuine, most useful, and natural virtues and properties are vigorous and\nsprightly, which we have helped to degenerate in these, by accommodating\nthem to the pleasure of our own corrupted palate.  And yet for all this,\nour taste confesses a flavour and delicacy excellent even to emulation of\nthe best of ours, in several fruits wherein those countries abound\nwithout art or culture.  Neither is it reasonable that art should gain\nthe pre-eminence of our great and powerful mother nature.  We have so\nsurcharged her with the additional ornaments and graces we have added to\nthe beauty and riches of her own works by our inventions, that we have\nalmost smothered her; yet in other places, where she shines in her own\npurity and proper lustre, she marvellously baffles and disgraces all our\nvain and frivolous attempts:\n\"Et veniunt hederae sponte sua melius;\nSurgit et in solis formosior arbutus antris;\nEt volucres nulls dulcius arte canunt.\"\n[\"The ivy grows best spontaneously, the arbutus best in shady caves;\nand the wild notes of birds are sweeter than art can teach.\n--\"Propertius, i. 2, 10.]\nOur utmost endeavours cannot arrive at so much as to imitate the nest of\nthe least of birds, its contexture, beauty, and convenience: not so much\nas the web of a poor spider.\nAll things, says Plato,--[Laws, 10.]--are produced either by nature, by\nfortune, or by art; the greatest and most beautiful by the one or the\nother of the former, the least and the most imperfect by the last.\nThese nations then seem to me to be so far barbarous, as having received\nbut very little form and fashion from art and human invention, and\nconsequently to be not much remote from their original simplicity.  The\nlaws of nature, however, govern them still, not as yet much vitiated with\nany mixture of ours: but 'tis in such purity, that I am sometimes\ntroubled we were not sooner acquainted with these people, and that they\nwere not discovered in those better times, when there were men much more\nable to judge of them than we are.  I am sorry that Lycurgus and Plato\nhad no knowledge of them; for to my apprehension, what we now see in\nthose nations, does not only surpass all the pictures with which the\npoets have adorned the golden age, and all their inventions in feigning a\nhappy state of man, but, moreover, the fancy and even the wish and desire\nof philosophy itself; so native and so pure a simplicity, as we by\nexperience see to be in them, could never enter into their imagination,\nnor could they ever believe that human society could have been maintained\nwith so little artifice and human patchwork.  I should tell Plato that it\nis a nation wherein there is no manner of traffic, no knowledge of\nletters, no science of numbers, no name of magistrate or political\nsuperiority; no use of service, riches or poverty, no contracts, no\nsuccessions, no dividends, no properties, no employments, but those of\nleisure, no respect of kindred, but common, no clothing, no agriculture,\nno metal, no use of corn or wine; the very words that signify lying,\ntreachery, dissimulation, avarice, envy, detraction, pardon, never heard\nof.\n--[This is the famous passage which Shakespeare, through Florio's\nversion, 1603, or ed.  1613, p. 102, has employed in the \"Tempest,\"\nii. 1.]\nHow much would he find his imaginary Republic short of his perfection?\n\"Viri a diis recentes.\"\n[\"Men fresh from the gods.\"--Seneca, Ep., 90.]\n\"Hos natura modos primum dedit.\"\n[\"These were the manners first taught by nature.\"\n--Virgil, Georgics, ii. 20.]\nAs to the rest, they live in a country very pleasant and temperate, so\nthat, as my witnesses inform me, 'tis rare to hear of a sick person, and\nthey moreover assure me, that they never saw any of the natives, either\nparalytic, bleareyed, toothless, or crooked with age.  The situation of\ntheir country is along the sea-shore, enclosed on the other side towards\nthe land, with great and high mountains, having about a hundred leagues\nin breadth between.  They have great store of fish and flesh, that have\nno resemblance to those of ours: which they eat without any other\ncookery, than plain boiling, roasting, and broiling.  The first that rode\na horse thither, though in several other voyages he had contracted an\nacquaintance and familiarity with them, put them into so terrible a\nfright, with his centaur appearance, that they killed him with their\narrows before they could come to discover who he was.  Their buildings\nare very long, and of capacity to hold two or three hundred people, made\nof the barks of tall trees, reared with one end upon the ground, and\nleaning to and supporting one another at the top, like some of our barns,\nof which the covering hangs down to the very ground, and serves for the\nside walls. They have wood so hard, that they cut with it, and make their\nswords of it, and their grills of it to broil their meat.  Their beds are\nof cotton, hung swinging from the roof, like our seamen's hammocks, every\nman his own, for the wives lie apart from their husbands.  They rise with\nthe sun, and so soon as they are up, eat for all day, for they have no\nmore meals but that; they do not then drink, as Suidas reports of some\nother people of the East that never drank at their meals; but drink very\noften all day after, and sometimes to a rousing pitch.  Their drink is\nmade of a certain root, and is of the colour of our claret, and they\nnever drink it but lukewarm.  It will not keep above two or three days;\nit has a somewhat sharp, brisk taste, is nothing heady, but very\ncomfortable to the stomach; laxative to strangers, but a very pleasant\nbeverage to such as are accustomed to it.  They make use, instead of\nbread, of a certain white compound, like coriander seeds; I have tasted\nof it; the taste is sweet and a little flat.  The whole day is spent in\ndancing.  Their young men go a-hunting after wild beasts with bows and\narrows; one part of their women are employed in preparing their drink the\nwhile, which is their chief employment.  One of their old men, in the\nmorning before they fall to eating, preaches to the whole family, walking\nfrom the one end of the house to the other, and several times repeating\nthe same sentence, till he has finished the round, for their houses are\nat least a hundred yards long.  Valour towards their enemies and love\ntowards their wives, are the two heads of his discourse, never failing in\nthe close, to put them in mind, that 'tis their wives who provide them\ntheir drink warm and well seasoned.  The fashion of their beds, ropes,\nswords, and of the wooden bracelets they tie about their wrists, when\nthey go to fight, and of the great canes, bored hollow at one end, by the\nsound of which they keep the cadence of their dances, are to be seen in\nseveral places, and amongst others, at my house.  They shave all over,\nand much more neatly than we, without other razor than one of wood or\nstone.  They believe in the immortality of the soul, and that those who\nhave merited well of the gods are lodged in that part of heaven where the\nsun rises, and the accursed in the west.\nThey have I know not what kind of priests and prophets, who very rarely\npresent themselves to the people, having their abode in the mountains.\nAt their arrival, there is a great feast, and solemn assembly of many\nvillages: each house, as I have described, makes a village, and they are\nabout a French league distant from one another.  This prophet declaims to\nthem in public, exhorting them to virtue and their duty: but all their\nethics are comprised in these two articles, resolution in war, and\naffection to their wives.  He also prophesies to them events to come, and\nthe issues they are to expect from their enterprises, and prompts them to\nor diverts them from war: but let him look to't; for if he fail in his\ndivination, and anything happen otherwise than he has foretold, he is cut\ninto a thousand pieces, if he be caught, and condemned for a false\nprophet: for that reason, if any of them has been mistaken, he is no more\nheard of.\nDivination is a gift of God, and therefore to abuse it, ought to be a\npunishable imposture.  Amongst the Scythians, where their diviners failed\nin the promised effect, they were laid, bound hand and foot, upon carts\nloaded with firs and bavins, and drawn by oxen, on which they were burned\nto death.--[Herodotus, iv.  69.]--Such as only meddle with things\nsubject to the conduct of human capacity, are excusable in doing the best\nthey can: but those other fellows that come to delude us with assurances\nof an extraordinary faculty, beyond our understanding, ought they not to\nbe punished, when they do not make good the effect of their promise, and\nfor the temerity of their imposture?\nThey have continual war with the nations that live further within the\nmainland, beyond their mountains, to which they go naked, and without\nother arms than their bows and wooden swords, fashioned at one end like\nthe head of our javelins.  The obstinacy of their battles is wonderful,\nand they never end without great effusion of blood: for as to running\naway, they know not what it is.  Every one for a trophy brings home the\nhead of an enemy he has killed, which he fixes over the door of his\nhouse.  After having a long time treated their prisoners very well, and\ngiven them all the regales they can think of, he to whom the prisoner\nbelongs, invites a great assembly of his friends.  They being come, he\nties a rope to one of the arms of the prisoner, of which, at a distance,\nout of his reach, he holds the one end himself, and gives to the friend\nhe loves best the other arm to hold after the same manner; which being.\ndone, they two, in the presence of all the assembly, despatch him with\ntheir swords.  After that, they roast him, eat him amongst them, and send\nsome chops to their absent friends.  They do not do this, as some think,\nfor nourishment, as the Scythians anciently did, but as a representation\nof an extreme revenge; as will appear by this: that having observed the\nPortuguese, who were in league with their enemies, to inflict another\nsort of death upon any of them they took prisoners, which was to set them\nup to the girdle in the earth, to shoot at the remaining part till it was\nstuck full of arrows, and then to hang them, they thought those people of\nthe other world (as being men who had sown the knowledge of a great many\nvices amongst their neighbours, and who were much greater masters in all\nsorts of mischief than they) did not exercise this sort of revenge\nwithout a meaning, and that it must needs be more painful than theirs,\nthey began to leave their old way, and to follow this.  I am not sorry\nthat we should here take notice of the barbarous horror of so cruel an\naction, but that, seeing so clearly into their faults, we should be so\nblind to our own.  I conceive there is more barbarity in eating a man\nalive, than when he is dead; in tearing a body limb from limb by racks\nand torments, that is yet in perfect sense; in roasting it by degrees; in\ncausing it to be bitten and worried by dogs and swine (as we have not\nonly read, but lately seen, not amongst inveterate and mortal enemies,\nbut among neighbours and fellow-citizens, and, which is worse, under\ncolour of piety and religion), than to roast and eat him after he is\ndead.\nChrysippus and Zeno, the two heads of the Stoic sect, were of opinion\nthat there was no hurt in making use of our dead carcasses, in what way\nsoever for our necessity, and in feeding upon them too;--[Diogenes\nLaertius, vii.  188.]--as our own ancestors, who being besieged by\nCaesar in the city Alexia, resolved to sustain the famine of the siege\nwith the bodies of their old men, women, and other persons who were\nincapable of bearing arms.\n\"Vascones, ut fama est, alimentis talibus usi\nProduxere animas.\"\n[\"'Tis said the Gascons with such meats appeased their hunger.\"\n--Juvenal, Sat., xv. 93.]\nAnd the physicians make no bones of employing it to all sorts of use,\neither to apply it outwardly; or to give it inwardly for the health of\nthe patient.  But there never was any opinion so irregular, as to excuse\ntreachery, disloyalty, tyranny, and cruelty, which are our familiar\nvices.  We may then call these people barbarous, in respect to the rules\nof reason: but not in respect to ourselves, who in all sorts of barbarity\nexceed them.  Their wars are throughout noble and generous, and carry as\nmuch excuse and fair pretence, as that human malady is capable of; having\nwith them no other foundation than the sole jealousy of valour.  Their\ndisputes are not for the conquest of new lands, for these they already\npossess are so fruitful by nature, as to supply them without labour or\nconcern, with all things necessary, in such abundance that they have no\nneed to enlarge their borders.  And they are, moreover, happy in this,\nthat they only covet so much as their natural necessities require: all\nbeyond that is superfluous to them: men of the same age call one another\ngenerally brothers, those who are younger, children; and the old men are\nfathers to all.  These leave to their heirs in common the full possession\nof goods, without any manner of division, or other title than what nature\nbestows upon her creatures, in bringing them into the world.  If their\nneighbours pass over the mountains to assault them, and obtain a victory,\nall the victors gain by it is glory only, and the advantage of having\nproved themselves the better in valour and virtue: for they never meddle\nwith the goods of the conquered, but presently return into their own\ncountry, where they have no want of anything necessary, nor of this\ngreatest of all goods, to know happily how to enjoy their condition and\nto be content.  And those in turn do the same; they demand of their\nprisoners no other ransom, than acknowledgment that they are overcome:\nbut there is not one found in an age, who will not rather choose to die\nthan make such a confession, or either by word or look recede from the\nentire grandeur of an invincible courage.  There is not a man amongst\nthem who had not rather be killed and eaten, than so much as to open his\nmouth to entreat he may not.  They use them with all liberality and\nfreedom, to the end their lives may be so much the dearer to them; but\nfrequently entertain them with menaces of their approaching death, of the\ntorments they are to suffer, of the preparations making in order to it,\nof the mangling their limbs, and of the feast that is to be made, where\ntheir carcass is to be the only dish.  All which they do, to no other\nend, but only to extort some gentle or submissive word from them, or to\nfrighten them so as to make them run away, to obtain this advantage that\nthey were terrified, and that their constancy was shaken; and indeed, if\nrightly taken, it is in this point only that a true victory consists:\n\"Victoria nulla est,\nQuam quae confessor animo quoque subjugat hostes.\"\n[\"No victory is complete, which the conquered do not admit to be\nso.--\"Claudius, De Sexto Consulatu Honorii, v. 248.]\nThe Hungarians, a very warlike people, never pretend further than to\nreduce the enemy to their discretion; for having forced this confession\nfrom them, they let them go without injury or ransom, excepting, at the\nmost, to make them engage their word never to bear arms against them\nagain.  We have sufficient advantages over our enemies that are borrowed\nand not truly our own; it is the quality of a porter, and no effect of\nvirtue, to have stronger arms and legs; it is a dead and corporeal\nquality to set in array; 'tis a turn of fortune to make our enemy\nstumble, or to dazzle him with the light of the sun; 'tis a trick of\nscience and art, and that may happen in a mean base fellow, to be a good\nfencer.  The estimate and value of a man consist in the heart and in the\nwill: there his true honour lies.  Valour is stability, not of legs and\narms, but of the courage and the soul; it does not lie in the goodness of\nour horse or our arms but in our own.  He that falls obstinate in his\ncourage--\n\"Si succiderit, de genu pugnat\"\n[\"If his legs fail him, he fights on his knees.\"\n--Seneca, De Providentia, c. 2.]\n--he who, for any danger of imminent death, abates nothing of his\nassurance; who, dying, yet darts at his enemy a fierce and disdainful\nlook, is overcome not by us, but by fortune; he is killed, not conquered;\nthe most valiant are sometimes the most unfortunate.  There are defeats\nmore triumphant than victories.  Never could those four sister victories,\nthe fairest the sun ever be held, of Salamis, Plataea, Mycale, and\nSicily, venture to oppose all their united glories, to the single glory\nof the discomfiture of King Leonidas and his men, at the pass of\nThermopylae.  Who ever ran with a more glorious desire and greater\nambition, to the winning, than Captain Iscolas to the certain loss of a\nbattle?--[Diodorus Siculus, xv.  64.]--Who could have found out a more\nsubtle invention to secure his safety, than he did to assure his\ndestruction?  He was set to defend a certain pass of Peloponnesus against\nthe Arcadians, which, considering the nature of the place and the\ninequality of forces, finding it utterly impossible for him to do, and\nseeing that all who were presented to the enemy, must certainly be left\nupon the place; and on the other side, reputing it unworthy of his own\nvirtue and magnanimity and of the Lacedaemonian name to fail in any part\nof his duty, he chose a mean betwixt these two extremes after this\nmanner; the youngest and most active of his men, he preserved for the\nservice and defence of their country, and sent them back; and with the\nrest, whose loss would be of less consideration, he resolved to make good\nthe pass, and with the death of them, to make the enemy buy their entry\nas dear as possibly he could; as it fell out, for being presently\nenvironed on all sides by the Arcadians, after having made a great\nslaughter of the enemy, he and his were all cut in pieces.  Is there any\ntrophy dedicated to the conquerors which was not much more due to these\nwho were overcome?  The part that true conquering is to play, lies in the\nencounter, not in the coming off; and the honour of valour consists in\nfighting, not in subduing.\nBut to return to my story: these prisoners are so far from discovering\nthe least weakness, for all the terrors that can be represented to them,\nthat, on the contrary, during the two or three months they are kept, they\nalways appear with a cheerful countenance; importune their masters to\nmake haste to bring them to the test, defy, rail at them, and reproach\nthem with cowardice, and the number of battles they have lost against\nthose of their country.  I have a song made by one of these prisoners,\nwherein he bids them \"come all, and dine upon him, and welcome, for they\nshall withal eat their own fathers and grandfathers, whose flesh has\nserved to feed and nourish him.  These muscles,\" says he, \"this flesh and\nthese veins, are your own: poor silly souls as you are, you little think\nthat the substance of your ancestors' limbs is here yet; notice what you\neat, and you will find in it the taste of your own flesh:\" in which song\nthere is to be observed an invention that nothing relishes of the\nbarbarian.  Those that paint these people dying after this manner,\nrepresent the prisoner spitting in the faces of his executioners and\nmaking wry mouths at them.  And 'tis most certain, that to the very last\ngasp, they never cease to brave and defy them both in word and gesture.\nIn plain truth, these men are very savage in comparison of us; of\nnecessity, they must either be absolutely so or else we are savages; for\nthere is a vast difference betwixt their manners and ours.\nThe men there have several wives, and so much the greater number, by how\nmuch they have the greater reputation for valour.  And it is one very\nremarkable feature in their marriages, that the same jealousy our wives\nhave to hinder and divert us from the friendship and familiarity of other\nwomen, those employ to promote their husbands' desires, and to procure\nthem many spouses; for being above all things solicitous of their\nhusbands' honour, 'tis their chiefest care to seek out, and to bring in\nthe most companions they can, forasmuch as it is a testimony of the\nhusband's virtue.  Most of our ladies will cry out, that 'tis monstrous;\nwhereas in truth it is not so, but a truly matrimonial virtue, and of the\nhighest form.  In the Bible, Sarah, with Leah and Rachel, the two wives\nof Jacob, gave the most beautiful of their handmaids to their husbands;\nLivia preferred the passions of Augustus to her own interest;\n--[Suetonius, Life of Augustus, c. 71.]--and the wife of King Deiotarus,\nStratonice, did not only give up a fair young maid that served her to her\nhusband's embraces, but moreover carefully brought up the children he had\nby her, and assisted them in the succession to their father's crown.\nAnd that it may not be supposed, that all this is done by a simple and\nservile obligation to their common practice, or by any authoritative\nimpression of their ancient custom, without judgment or reasoning, and\nfrom having a soul so stupid that it cannot contrive what else to do, I\nmust here give you some touches of their sufficiency in point of\nunderstanding.  Besides what I repeated to you before, which was one of\ntheir songs of war, I have another, a love-song, that begins thus:\n\"Stay, adder, stay, that by thy pattern my sister may draw the\nfashion and work of a rich ribbon, that I may present to my beloved,\nby which means thy beauty and the excellent order of thy scales\nshall for ever be preferred before all other serpents.\"\nWherein the first couplet, \"Stay, adder,\" &c., makes the burden of the\nsong.  Now I have conversed enough with poetry to judge thus much that\nnot only there is nothing barbarous in this invention, but, moreover,\nthat it is perfectly Anacreontic.  To which it may be added, that their\nlanguage is soft, of a pleasing accent, and something bordering upon the\nGreek termination.\nThree of these people, not foreseeing how dear their knowledge of the\ncorruptions of this part of the world will one day cost their happiness\nand repose, and that the effect of this commerce will be their ruin, as I\npresuppose it is in a very fair way (miserable men to suffer themselves\nto be deluded with desire of novelty and to have left the serenity of\ntheir own heaven to come so far to gaze at ours!), were at Rouen at the\ntime that the late King Charles IX. was there.  The king himself talked\nto them a good while, and they were made to see our fashions, our pomp,\nand the form of a great city.  After which, some one asked their opinion,\nand would know of them, what of all the things they had seen, they found\nmost to be admired?  To which they made answer, three things, of which I\nhave forgotten the third, and am troubled at it, but two I yet remember.\nThey said, that in the first place they thought it very strange that so\nmany tall men, wearing beards, strong, and well armed, who were about the\nking ('tis like they meant the Swiss of the guard), should submit to obey\na child, and that they did not rather choose out one amongst themselves\nto command.  Secondly (they have a way of speaking in their language to\ncall men the half of one another), that they had observed that there were\namongst us men full and crammed with all manner of commodities, whilst,\nin the meantime, their halves were begging at their doors, lean and\nhalf-starved with hunger and poverty; and they thought it strange that\nthese necessitous halves were able to suffer so great an inequality and\ninjustice, and that they did not take the others by the throats, or set\nfire to their houses.\nI talked to one of them a great while together, but I had so ill an\ninterpreter, and one who was so perplexed by his own ignorance to\napprehend my meaning, that I could get nothing out of him of any moment:\nAsking him what advantage he reaped from the superiority he had amongst\nhis own people (for he was a captain, and our mariners called him king),\nhe told me, to march at the head of them to war.  Demanding of him\nfurther how many men he had to follow him, he showed me a space of\nground, to signify as many as could march in such a compass, which might\nbe four or five thousand men; and putting the question to him whether or\nno his authority expired with the war, he told me this remained: that\nwhen he went to visit the villages of his dependence, they planed him\npaths through the thick of their woods, by which he might pass at his\nease.  All this does not sound very ill, and the last was not at all\namiss, for they wear no breeches.\nCHAPTER XXXI\nTHAT A MAN IS SOBERLY TO JUDGE OF THE DIVINE ORDINANCES\nThe true field and subject of imposture are things unknown, forasmuch as,\nin the first place, their very strangeness lends them credit, and\nmoreover, by not being subjected to our ordinary reasons, they deprive us\nof the means to question and dispute them: For which reason, says Plato,\n--[In Critias.]--it is much more easy to satisfy the hearers, when\nspeaking of the nature of the gods than of the nature of men, because the\nignorance of the auditory affords a fair and large career and all manner\nof liberty in the handling of abstruse things.  Thence it comes to pass,\nthat nothing is so firmly believed, as what we least know; nor any people\nso confident, as those who entertain us with fables, such as your\nalchemists, judicial astrologers, fortune-tellers, and physicians,\n\"Id genus omne.\"\n[\"All that sort of people.\"--Horace, Sat., i. 2, 2.]\nTo which I would willingly, if I durst, join a pack of people that take\nupon them to interpret and control the designs of God Himself, pretending\nto find out the cause of every accident, and to pry into the secrets of\nthe divine will, there to discover the incomprehensible motive, of His\nworks; and although the variety, and the continual discordance of events,\nthrow them from corner to corner, and toss them from east to west, yet do\nthey still persist in their vain inquisition, and with the same pencil to\npaint black and white.\nIn a nation of the Indies, there is this commendable custom, that when\nanything befalls them amiss in any encounter or battle, they publicly ask\npardon of the sun, who is their god, as having committed an unjust\naction, always imputing their good or evil fortune to the divine justice,\nand to that submitting their own judgment and reason.  'Tis enough for a\nChristian to believe that all things come from God, to receive them with\nacknowledgment of His divine and inscrutable wisdom, and also thankfully\nto accept and receive them, with what face soever they may present\nthemselves.  But I do not approve of what I see in use, that is, to seek\nto affirm and support our religion by the prosperity of our enterprises.\nOur belief has other foundation enough, without going about to authorise\nit by events: for the people being accustomed to such plausible arguments\nas these and so proper to their taste, it is to be feared, lest when they\nfail of success they should also stagger in their faith: as in the war\nwherein we are now engaged upon the account of religion, those who had\nthe better in the business of Rochelabeille,--[May 1569.]--making great\nbrags of that success as an infallible approbation of their cause, when\nthey came afterwards to excuse their misfortunes of Moncontour and\nJarnac, by saying they were fatherly scourges and corrections that they\nhad not a people wholly at their mercy, they make it manifestly enough\nappear, what it is to take two sorts of grist out of the same sack, and\nwith the same mouth to blow hot and cold.  It were better to possess the\nvulgar with the solid and real foundations of truth.  'Twas a fine naval\nbattle that was gained under the command of Don John of Austria a few\nmonths since--[That of Lepanto, October 7, 1571.]--against the Turks;\nbut it has also pleased God at other times to let us see as great\nvictories at our own expense.  In fine, 'tis a hard matter to reduce\ndivine things to our balance, without waste and losing a great deal of\nthe weight.  And who would take upon him to give a reason that Arius and\nhis Pope Leo, the principal heads of the Arian heresy, should die, at\nseveral times, of so like and strange deaths (for being withdrawn from\nthe disputation by a griping in the bowels, they both of them suddenly\ngave up the ghost upon the stool), and would aggravate this divine\nvengeance by the circumstances of the place, might as well add the death\nof Heliogabalus, who was also slain in a house of office.  And, indeed,\nIrenaeus was involved in the same fortune.  God, being pleased to show\nus, that the good have something else to hope for and the wicked\nsomething else to fear, than the fortunes or misfortunes of this world,\nmanages and applies these according to His own occult will and pleasure,\nand deprives us of the means foolishly to make thereof our own profit.\nAnd those people abuse themselves who will pretend to dive into these\nmysteries by the strength of human reason.  They never give one hit that\nthey do not receive two for it; of which St. Augustine makes out a great\nproof upon his adversaries.  'Tis a conflict that is more decided by\nstrength of memory than by the force of reason.  We are to content\nourselves with the light it pleases the sun to communicate to us, by\nvirtue of his rays; and who will lift up his eyes to take in a greater,\nlet him not think it strange, if for the reward of his presumption, he\nthere lose his sight.\n\"Quis hominum potest scire consilium Dei?\nAut quis poterit cogitare quid velit Dominus?\"\n[\"Who of men can know the counsel of God? or who can think what the\nwill of the Lord is.\"--Book of Wisdom, ix. 13.]\nCHAPTER XXXII\nTHAT WE ARE TO AVOID PLEASURES, EVEN AT THE EXPENSE OF LIFE\nI had long ago observed most of the opinions of the ancients to concur in\nthis, that it is high time to die when there is more ill than good in\nliving, and that to preserve life to our own torment and inconvenience is\ncontrary to the very rules of nature, as these old laws instruct us.\n[\"Either tranquil life, or happy death.  It is well to die when life\nis wearisome.  It is better to die than to live miserable.\"\n--Stobaeus, Serm. xx.]\nBut to push this contempt of death so far as to employ it to the removing\nour thoughts from the honours, riches, dignities, and other favours and\ngoods, as we call them, of fortune, as if reason were not sufficient to\npersuade us to avoid them, without adding this new injunction, I had\nnever seen it either commanded or practised, till this passage of Seneca\nfell into my hands; who advising Lucilius, a man of great power and\nauthority about the emperor, to alter his voluptuous and magnificent way\nof living, and to retire himself from this worldly vanity and ambition,\nto some solitary, quiet, and philosophical life, and the other alleging\nsome difficulties: \"I am of opinion,\" says he, \"either that thou leave\nthat life of thine, or life itself; I would, indeed, advise thee to the\ngentle way, and to untie, rather than to break, the knot thou hast\nindiscreetly knit, provided, that if it be not otherwise to be untied,\nthou resolutely break it.  There is no man so great a coward, that had\nnot rather once fall than to be always falling.\"  I should have found\nthis counsel conformable enough to the Stoical roughness: but it appears\nthe more strange, for being borrowed from Epicurus, who writes the same\nthing upon the like occasion to Idomeneus.  And I think I have observed\nsomething like it, but with Christian moderation, amongst our own people.\nSt. Hilary, Bishop of Poictiers, that famous enemy of the Arian heresy,\nbeing in Syria, had intelligence thither sent him, that Abra, his only\ndaughter, whom he left at home under the eye and tuition of her mother,\nwas sought in marriage by the greatest noblemen of the country, as being\na virgin virtuously brought up, fair, rich, and in the flower of her age;\nwhereupon he wrote to her (as appears upon record), that she should\nremove her affection from all the pleasures and advantages proposed to\nher; for that he had in his travels found out a much greater and more\nworthy fortune for her, a husband of much greater power and magnificence,\nwho would present her with robes and jewels of inestimable value; wherein\nhis design was to dispossess her of the appetite and use of worldly\ndelights, to join her wholly to God; but the nearest and most certain way\nto this, being, as he conceived, the death of his daughter; he never\nceased, by vows, prayers, and orisons, to beg of the Almighty, that He\nwould please to call her out of this world, and to take her to Himself;\nas accordingly it came to pass; for soon after his return, she died, at\nwhich he expressed a singular joy.  This seems to outdo the other,\nforasmuch as he applies himself to this means at the outset, which they\nonly take subsidiarily; and, besides, it was towards his only daughter.\nBut I will not omit the latter end of this story, though it be for my\npurpose; St. Hilary's wife, having understood from him how the death of\ntheir daughter was brought about by his desire and design, and how much\nhappier she was to be removed out of this world than to have stayed in\nit, conceived so vivid an apprehension of the eternal and heavenly\nbeatitude, that she begged of her husband, with the extremest\nimportunity, to do as much for her; and God, at their joint request,\nshortly after calling her to Him, it was a death embraced with singular\nand mutual content.\nCHAPTER XXXIII\nTHAT FORTUNE IS OFTENTIMES OBSERVED TO ACT BY THE RULE OF REASON\nThe inconstancy and various motions of Fortune\n[The term Fortune, so often employed by Montaigne, and in passages\nwhere he might have used Providence, was censured by the doctors who\nexamined his Essays when he was at Rome in 1581.  See his Travels,\ni. 35 and 76.]\nmay reasonably make us expect she should present us with all sorts of\nfaces.  Can there be a more express act of justice than this?  The Duc de\nValentinois,--[Caesar Borgia.]--having resolved to poison Adrian,\nCardinal of Corneto, with whom Pope Alexander VI., his father and\nhimself, were to sup in the Vatican, he sent before a bottle of poisoned\nwine, and withal, strict order to the butler to keep it very safe.\nThe Pope being come before his son, and calling for drink, the butler\nsupposing this wine had not been so strictly recommended to his care,\nbut only upon the account of its excellency, presented it forthwith to\nthe Pope, and the duke himself coming in presently after, and being\nconfident they had not meddled with his bottle, took also his cup; so\nthat the father died immediately upon the spot--[Other historians assign\nthe Pope several days of misery prior to death.  D.W.]--, and the son,\nafter having been long tormented with sickness, was reserved to another\nand a worse fortune.\nSometimes she seems to play upon us, just in the nick of an affair;\nMonsieur d'Estrees, at that time ensign to Monsieur de Vendome, and\nMonsieur de Licques, lieutenant in the company of the Duc d'Ascot, being\nboth pretenders to the Sieur de Fougueselles' sister, though of several\nparties (as it oft falls out amongst frontier neighbours), the Sieur de\nLicques carried her; but on the same day he was married, and which was\nworse, before he went to bed to his wife, the bridegroom having a mind to\nbreak a lance in honour of his new bride, went out to skirmish near St.\nOmer, where the Sieur d'Estrees proving the stronger, took him prisoner,\nand the more to illustrate his victory, the lady was fain--\n\"Conjugis ante coacta novi dimittere collum,\nQuam veniens una atque altera rursus hyems\nNoctibus in longis avidum saturasset amorem,\"\n[\"Compelled to abstain from embracing her new spouse in her arms\nbefore two winters pass in succession, during their long nights had\nsatiated her eager love.\"--Catullus, lxviii.  81.]\n--to request him of courtesy, to deliver up his prisoner to her, as he\naccordingly did, the gentlemen of France never denying anything to\nladies.\nDoes she not seem to be an artist here?  Constantine, son of Helena,\nfounded the empire of Constantinople, and so many ages after,\nConstantine, the son of Helen, put an end to it.  Sometimes she is\npleased to emulate our miracles we are told, that King Clovis besieging\nAngouleme, the walls fell down of themselves by divine favour and Bouchet\nhas it from some author, that King Robert having sat down before a city,\nand being stolen away from the siege to go keep the feast of St. Aignan\nat Orleans, as he was in devotion at a certain part of the Mass, the\nwalls of the beleaguered city, without any manner of violence, fell down\nwith a sudden ruin.  But she did quite contrary in our Milan wars; for,\nle Capitaine Rense laying siege for us to the city Arona, and having\ncarried a mine under a great part of the wall, the mine being sprung, the\nwall was lifted from its base, but dropped down again nevertheless, whole\nand entire, and so exactly upon its foundation, that the besieged\nsuffered no inconvenience by that attempt.\nSometimes she plays the physician.  Jason of Pheres being given over by\nthe physicians, by reason of an imposthume in his breast, having a mind\nto rid himself of his pain, by death at least, threw himself in a battle\ndesperately into the thickest of the enemy, where he was so fortunately\nwounded quite through the body, that the imposthume broke, and he was\nperfectly cured.  Did she not also excel the painter Protogenes in his\nart? who having finished the picture of a dog quite tired and out of\nbreath, in all the other parts excellently well to his own liking, but\nnot being able to express, as he would, the slaver and foam that should\ncome out of its mouth, vexed and angry at his work, he took his sponge,\nwhich by cleaning his pencils had imbibed several sorts of colours, and\nthrew it in a rage against the picture, with an intent utterly to deface\nit; when fortune guiding the sponge to hit just upon the mouth of the\ndog, it there performed what all his art was not able to do.  Does she\nnot sometimes direct our counsels and correct them?  Isabel, Queen of\nEngland, having to sail from Zealand into her own kingdom,--[in 1326]--\nwith an army, in favour of her son against her husband, had been lost,\nhad she come into the port she intended, being there laid wait for by the\nenemy; but fortune, against her will, threw her into another haven, where\nshe landed in safety.  And that man of old who, throwing a stone at a\ndog, hit and killed his mother-in-law, had he not reason to pronounce\nthis verse:\n[\"Fortune has more judgement than we.\"--Menander]\nIcetes had contracted with two soldiers to kill Timoleon at Adrana in\nSicily.--[Plutarch, Life of Timoleon, c. 7.]--They took their time to do\nit when he was assisting at a sacrifice, and thrusting into the crowd,\nas they were making signs to one another, that now was a fit time to do\ntheir business, in steps a third, who, with a sword takes one of them\nfull drive over the pate, lays him dead upon the place and runs away,\nwhich the others see, and concluding himself discovered and lost, runs to\nthe altar and begs for mercy, promising to discover the whole truth,\nwhich as he was doing, and laying open the full conspiracy, behold the\nthird man, who being apprehended, was, as a murderer, thrust and hauled\nby the people through the press, towards Timoleon, and the other most\neminent persons of the assembly, before whom being brought, he cries out\nfor pardon, pleading that he had justly slain his father's murderer;\nwhich he, also, proving upon the spot, by sufficient witnesses, whom his\ngood fortune very opportunely supplied him withal, that his father was\nreally killed in the city of Leontini, by that very man on whom he had\ntaken his revenge, he was presently awarded ten Attic minae, for having\nhad the good fortune, by designing to revenge the death of his father,\nto preserve the life of the common father of Sicily.  Fortune, truly, in\nher conduct surpasses all the rules of human prudence.\nBut to conclude: is there not a direct application of her favour, bounty,\nand piety manifestly discovered in this action?  Ignatius the father and\nIgnatius the son being proscribed by the triumvirs of Rome, resolved upon\nthis generous act of mutual kindness, to fall by the hands of one\nanother, and by that means to frustrate and defeat the cruelty of the\ntyrants; and accordingly with their swords drawn, ran full drive upon one\nanother, where fortune so guided the points, that they made two equally\nmortal wounds, affording withal so much honour to so brave a friendship,\nas to leave them just strength enough to draw out their bloody swords,\nthat they might have liberty to embrace one another in this dying\ncondition, with so close and hearty an embrace, that the executioner cut\noff both their heads at once, leaving the bodies still fast linked\ntogether in this noble bond, and their wounds joined mouth to mouth,\naffectionately sucking in the last blood and remainder of the lives of\neach other.\nCHAPTER XXXIV\nOF ONE DEFECT IN OUR GOVERNMENT\nMy late father, a man that had no other advantages than experience and\nhis own natural parts, was nevertheless of a very clear judgment,\nformerly told me that he once had thoughts of endeavouring to introduce\nthis practice; that there might be in every city a certain place assigned\nto which such as stood in need of anything might repair, and have their\nbusiness entered by an officer appointed for that purpose.  As for\nexample: I want a chapman to buy my pearls; I want one that has pearls to\nsell; such a one wants company to go to Paris; such a one seeks a servant\nof such a quality; such a one a master; such a one such an artificer;\nsome inquiring for one thing, some for another, every one according to\nwhat he wants.  And doubtless, these mutual advertisements would be of no\ncontemptible advantage to the public correspondence and intelligence: for\nthere are evermore conditions that hunt after one another, and for want\nof knowing one another's occasions leave men in very great necessity.\nI have heard, to the great shame of the age we live in, that in our very\nsight two most excellent men for learning died so poor that they had\nscarce bread to put in their mouths: Lilius Gregorius Giraldus in Italy\nand Sebastianus Castalio in Germany: and I believe there are a thousand\nmen would have invited them into their families, with very advantageous\nconditions, or have relieved them where they were, had they known their\nwants.  The world is not so generally corrupted, but that I know a man\nthat would heartily wish the estate his ancestors have left him might be\nemployed, so long as it shall please fortune to give him leave to enjoy\nit, to secure rare and remarkable persons of any kind, whom misfortune\nsometimes persecutes to the last degree, from the dangers of necessity;\nand at least place them in such a condition that they must be very hard\nto please, if they are not contented.\nMy father in his domestic economy had this rule (which I know how to\ncommend, but by no means to imitate), namely, that besides the day-book\nor memorial of household affairs, where the small accounts, payments, and\ndisbursements, which do not require a secretary's hand, were entered, and\nwhich a steward always had in custody, he ordered him whom he employed to\nwrite for him, to keep a journal, and in it to set down all the\nremarkable occurrences, and daily memorials of the history of his house:\nvery pleasant to look over, when time begins to wear things out of\nmemory, and very useful sometimes to put us out of doubt when such a\nthing was begun, when ended; what visitors came, and when they went; our\ntravels, absences, marriages, and deaths; the reception of good or ill\nnews; the change of principal servants, and the like.  An ancient custom,\nwhich I think it would not be amiss for every one to revive in his own\nhouse; and I find I did very foolishly in neglecting it.\nCHAPTER XXXV\nOF THE CUSTOM OF WEARING CLOTHES\nWhatever I shall say upon this subject, I am of necessity to invade some\nof the bounds of custom, so careful has she been to shut up all the\navenues.  I was disputing with myself in this shivering season, whether\nthe fashion of going naked in those nations lately discovered is imposed\nupon them by the hot temperature of the air, as we say of the Indians and\nMoors, or whether it be the original fashion of mankind.  Men of\nunderstanding, forasmuch as all things under the sun, as the Holy Writ\ndeclares, are subject to the same laws, were wont in such considerations\nas these, where we are to distinguish the natural laws from those which\nhave been imposed by man's invention, to have recourse to the general\npolity of the world, where there can be nothing counterfeit.  Now, all\nother creatures being sufficiently furnished with all things necessary\nfor the support of their being--[Montaigne's expression is, \"with needle\nand thread.\"--W.C.H.]--it is not to be imagined that we only are brought\ninto the world in a defective and indigent condition, and in such a state\nas cannot subsist without external aid.  Therefore it is that I believe,\nthat as plants, trees, and animals, and all things that have life, are\nseen to be by nature sufficiently clothed and covered, to defend them\nfrom the injuries of weather:\n\"Proptereaque fere res omnes ant corio sunt,\nAut seta, ant conchis, ant callo, ant cortice tectae,\"\n[\"And that for this reason nearly all things are clothed with skin,\nor hair, or shells, or bark, or some such thing.\"\n--Lucretius, iv. 936.]\nso were we: but as those who by artificial light put out that of day, so\nwe by borrowed forms and fashions have destroyed our own.  And 'tis plain\nenough to be seen, that 'tis custom only which renders that impossible\nthat otherwise is nothing so; for of those nations who have no manner of\nknowledge of clothing, some are situated under the same temperature that\nwe are, and some in much colder climates.  And besides, our most tender\nparts are always exposed to the air, as the eyes, mouth, nose, and ears;\nand our country labourers, like our ancestors in former times, go with\ntheir breasts and bellies open.  Had we been born with a necessity upon\nus of wearing petticoats and breeches, there is no doubt but nature would\nhave fortified those parts she intended should be exposed to the fury of\nthe seasons with a thicker skin, as she has done the finger-ends and the\nsoles of the feet.  And why should this seem hard to believe?  I observe\nmuch greater distance betwixt my habit and that of one of our country\nboors, than betwixt his and that of a man who has no other covering but\nhis skin.  How many men, especially in Turkey, go naked upon the account\nof devotion?  Some one asked a beggar, whom he saw in his shirt in the\ndepth of winter, as brisk and frolic as he who goes muffled up to the\nears in furs, how he was able to endure to go so?  \"Why, sir,\" he\nanswered, \"you go with your face bare: I am all face.\"  The Italians have\na story of the Duke of Florence's fool, whom his master asking how, being\nso thinly clad, he was able to support the cold, when he himself, warmly\nwrapped up as he was, was hardly able to do it?  \"Why,\" replied the fool,\n\"use my receipt to put on all your clothes you have at once, and you'll\nfeel no more cold than I.\"  King Massinissa, to an extreme old age, could\nnever be prevailed upon to go with his head covered, how cold, stormy, or\nrainy soever the weather might be; which also is reported of the Emperor\nSeverus.  Herodotus tells us, that in the battles fought betwixt the\nEgyptians and the Persians, it was observed both by himself and by\nothers, that of those who were left dead upon the field, the heads of the\nEgyptians were without comparison harder than those of the Persians, by\nreason that the last had gone with their heads always covered from their\ninfancy, first with biggins, and then with turbans, and the others always\nshaved and bare.  King Agesilaus continued to a decrepit age to wear\nalways the same clothes in winter that he did in summer.  Caesar, says\nSuetonius, marched always at the head of his army, for the most part on\nfoot, with his head bare, whether it was rain or sunshine, and as much is\nsaid of Hannibal:\n\"Tum vertice nudo,\nExcipere insanos imbres, coelique ruinam.\"\n[\"Bareheaded he marched in snow, exposed to pouring rain and the\nutmost rigour of the weather.\"--Silius Italicus, i. 250.]\nA Venetian who has long lived in Pegu, and has lately returned thence,\nwrites that the men and women of that kingdom, though they cover all\ntheir other parts, go always barefoot and ride so too; and Plato very\nearnestly advises for the health of the whole body, to give the head and\nthe feet no other clothing than what nature has bestowed.  He whom the\nPoles have elected for their king,--[Stephen Bathory]--since ours came\nthence, who is, indeed, one of the greatest princes of this age, never\nwears any gloves, and in winter or whatever weather can come, never wears\nother cap abroad than that he wears at home.  Whereas I cannot endure to\ngo unbuttoned or untied; my neighbouring labourers would think themselves\nin chains, if they were so braced.  Varro is of opinion, that when it was\nordained we should be bare in the presence of the gods and before the\nmagistrate, it was so ordered rather upon the score of health, and to\ninure us to the injuries of weather, than upon the account of reverence;\nand since we are now talking of cold, and Frenchmen used to wear variety\nof colours (not I myself, for I seldom wear other than black or white, in\nimitation of my father), let us add another story out of Le Capitaine\nMartin du Bellay, who affirms, that in the march to Luxembourg he saw so\ngreat frost, that the munition-wine was cut with hatchets and wedges, and\ndelivered out to the soldiers by weight, and that they carried it away in\nbaskets: and Ovid,\n\"Nudaque consistunt, formam servantia testae,\nVina; nec hausta meri, sed data frusta, bibunt.\"\n[\"The wine when out of the cask retains the form of the cask;\nand is given out not in cups, but in bits.\"\n--Ovid, Trist., iii. 10, 23.]\nAt the mouth of Lake Maeotis the frosts are so very sharp, that in the\nvery same place where Mithridates' lieutenant had fought the enemy\ndryfoot and given them a notable defeat, the summer following he obtained\nover them a naval victory.  The Romans fought at a very great\ndisadvantage, in the engagement they had with the Carthaginians near\nPiacenza, by reason that they went to the charge with their blood\ncongealed and their limbs numbed with cold, whereas Hannibal had caused\ngreat fires to be dispersed quite through his camp to warm his soldiers,\nand oil to be distributed amongst them, to the end that anointing\nthemselves, they might render their nerves more supple and active, and\nfortify the pores against the violence of the air and freezing wind,\nwhich raged in that season.\nThe retreat the Greeks made from Babylon into their own country is famous\nfor the difficulties and calamities they had to overcome; of which this\nwas one, that being encountered in the mountains of Armenia with a\nhorrible storm of snow, they lost all knowledge of the country and of the\nways, and being driven up, were a day and a night without eating or\ndrinking; most of their cattle died, many of themselves were starved to\ndeath, several struck blind with the force of the hail and the glare of\nthe snow, many of them maimed in their fingers and toes, and many stiff\nand motionless with the extremity of the cold, who had yet their\nunderstanding entire.\nAlexander saw a nation, where they bury their fruit-trees in winter to\nprotect them from being destroyed by the frost, and we also may see the\nsame.\nBut, so far as clothes go, the King of Mexico changed four times a day\nhis apparel, and never put it on again, employing that he left off in his\ncontinual liberalities and rewards; and neither pot, dish, nor other\nutensil of his kitchen or table was ever served twice.\nCHAPTER XXXVI\nOF CATO THE YOUNGER\n[\"I am not possessed with this common errour, to judge of others\naccording to what I am my selfe.  I am easie to beleeve things\ndiffering from my selfe.  Though I be engaged to one forme, I do not\ntie the world unto it, as every man doth.  And I beleeve and\nconceive a thousand manners of life, contrary to the common sorte.\"\n--Florio, ed. 1613, p. 113.]\nI am not guilty of the common error of judging another by myself.  I\neasily believe that in another's humour which is contrary to my own; and\nthough I find myself engaged to one certain form, I do not oblige others\nto it, as many do; but believe and apprehend a thousand ways of living;\nand, contrary to most men, more easily admit of difference than\nuniformity amongst us.  I as frankly as any one would have me, discharge\na man from my humours and principles, and consider him according to his\nown particular model.  Though I am not continent myself, I nevertheless\nsincerely approve the continence of the Feuillans and Capuchins, and\nhighly commend their way of living.  I insinuate myself by imagination\ninto their place, and love and honour them the more for being other than\nI am.  I very much desire that we may be judged every man by himself, and\nwould not be drawn into the consequence of common examples.  My own\nweakness nothing alters the esteem I ought to have for the force and\nvigour of those who deserve it:\n\"Sunt qui nihil suadent, quam quod se imitari posse confidunt.\"\n[\"There are who persuade nothing but what they believe they can\nimitate themselves.\"--Cicero, De Orator., c. 7.]\nCrawling upon the slime of the earth, I do not for all that cease to\nobserve up in the clouds the inimitable height of some heroic souls.\n'Tis a great deal for me to have my judgment regular and just, if the\neffects cannot be so, and to maintain this sovereign part, at least, free\nfrom corruption; 'tis something to have my will right and good where my\nlegs fail me.  This age wherein we live, in our part of the world at\nleast, is grown so stupid, that not only the exercise, but the very\nimagination of virtue is defective, and seems to be no other but college\njargon:\n\"Virtutem verba putant, ut\nLucum ligna:\"\n[\"They think words virtue, as they think mere wood a sacred grove.\"\n--Horace, Ep., i. 6, 31.]\n\"Quam vereri deberent, etiam si percipere non possent.\"\n[\"Which they ought to reverence, though they cannot comprehend.\"\n--Cicero, Tusc. Quas., v. 2.]\n'Tis a gewgaw to hang in a cabinet or at the end of the tongue, as on the\ntip of the ear, for ornament only.  There are no longer virtuous actions\nextant; those actions that carry a show of virtue have yet nothing of its\nessence; by reason that profit, glory, fear, custom, and other suchlike\nforeign causes, put us on the way to produce them.  Our justice also,\nvalour, courtesy, may be called so too, in respect to others and\naccording to the face they appear with to the public; but in the doer it\ncan by no means be virtue, because there is another end proposed, another\nmoving cause.  Now virtue owns nothing to be hers, but what is done by\nherself and for herself alone.\nIn that great battle of Plataea, that the Greeks under the command of\nPausanias gained against Mardonius and the Persians, the conquerors,\naccording to their custom, coming to divide amongst them the glory of the\nexploit, attributed to the Spartan nation the pre-eminence of valour in\nthe engagement.  The Spartans, great judges of virtue, when they came to\ndetermine to what particular man of their nation the honour was due of\nhaving the best behaved himself upon this occasion, found that\nAristodemus had of all others hazarded his person with the greatest\nbravery; but did not, however, allow him any prize, by reason that his\nvirtue had been incited by a desire to clear his reputation from the\nreproach of his miscarriage at the business of Thermopylae, and to die\nbravely to wipe off that former blemish.\nOur judgments are yet sick, and obey the humour of our depraved manners.\nI observe most of the wits of these times pretend to ingenuity, by\nendeavouring to blemish and darken the glory of the bravest and most\ngenerous actions of former ages, putting one vile interpretation or\nanother upon them, and forging and supposing vain causes and motives for\nthe noble things they did: a mighty subtlety indeed!  Give me the\ngreatest and most unblemished action that ever the day beheld, and I will\ncontrive a hundred plausible drifts and ends to obscure it.  God knows,\nwhoever will stretch them out to the full, what diversity of images our\ninternal wills suffer under.  They do not so maliciously play the\ncensurers, as they do it ignorantly and rudely in all their detractions.\nThe same pains and licence that others take to blemish and bespatter\nthese illustrious names, I would willingly undergo to lend them a\nshoulder to raise them higher.  These rare forms, that are culled out by\nthe consent of the wisest men of all ages, for the world's example,\nI should not stick to augment in honour, as far as my invention would\npermit, in all the circumstances of favourable interpretation; and we may\nwell believe that the force of our invention is infinitely short of their\nmerit.  'Tis the duty of good men to portray virtue as beautiful as they\ncan, and there would be nothing wrong should our passion a little\ntransport us in favour of so sacred a form.  What these people do, on the\ncontrary, they either do out of malice, or by the vice of confining their\nbelief to their own capacity; or, which I am more inclined to think, for\nnot having their sight strong, clear, and elevated enough to conceive the\nsplendour of virtue in her native purity: as Plutarch complains, that in\nhis time some attributed the cause of the younger Cato's death to his\nfear of Caesar, at which he seems very angry, and with good reason; and\nby this a man may guess how much more he would have been offended with\nthose who have attributed it to ambition.  Senseless people!  He would\nrather have performed a noble, just, and generous action, and to have had\nignominy for his reward, than for glory.  That man was in truth a pattern\nthat nature chose out to show to what height human virtue and constancy\ncould arrive.\nBut I am not capable of handling so rich an argument, and shall therefore\nonly set five Latin poets together, contending in the praise of Cato;\nand, incidentally, for their own too.  Now, a well-educated child will\njudge the two first, in comparison of the others, a little flat and\nlanguid; the third more vigorous, but overthrown by the extravagance of\nhis own force; he will then think that there will be room for one or two\ngradations of invention to come to the fourth, and, mounting to the pitch\nof that, he will lift up his hands in admiration; coming to the last, the\nfirst by some space' (but a space that he will swear is not to be filled\nup by any human wit), he will be astounded, he will not know where he is.\nAnd here is a wonder: we have far more poets than judges and interpreters\nof poetry; it is easier to write it than to understand it.  There is,\nindeed, a certain low and moderate sort of poetry, that a man may well\nenough judge by certain rules of art; but the true, supreme, and divine\npoesy is above all rules and reason.  And whoever discerns the beauty of\nit with the most assured and most steady sight, sees no more than the\nquick reflection of a flash of lightning: it does not exercise, but\nravishes and overwhelms our judgment.  The fury that possesses him who is\nable to penetrate into it wounds yet a third man by hearing him repeat\nit; like a loadstone that not only attracts the needle, but also infuses\ninto it the virtue to attract others.  And it is more evidently manifest\nin our theatres, that the sacred inspiration of the Muses, having first\nstirred up the poet to anger, sorrow, hatred, and out of himself, to\nwhatever they will, does moreover by the poet possess the actor, and by\nthe actor consecutively all the spectators.  So much do our passions hang\nand depend upon one another.\nPoetry has ever had that power over me from a child to transpierce and\ntransport me; but this vivid sentiment that is natural to me has been\nvariously handled by variety of forms, not so much higher or lower (for\nthey were ever the highest of every kind), as differing in colour.\nFirst, a gay and sprightly fluency; afterwards, a lofty and penetrating\nsubtlety; and lastly, a mature and constant vigour.  Their names will\nbetter express them: Ovid, Lucan, Virgil.\nBut our poets are beginning their career:\n\"Sit Cato, dum vivit, sane vel Caesare major,\"\n[\"Let Cato, whilst he live, be greater than Caesar.\"\n--Martial, vi. 32]\nsays one.\n\"Et invictum, devicta morte, Catonem,\"\n[\"And Cato invincible, death being overcome.\"\n--Manilius, Astron., iv. 87.]\nsays the second.  And the third, speaking of the civil wars betwixt\nCaesar and Pompey,\n\"Victrix causa diis placuit, set victa Catoni.\"\n[\"The victorious cause blessed the gods, the defeated one Cato.\n--\"Lucan, i. 128.]\nAnd the fourth, upon the praises of Caesar:\n\"Et cuncta terrarum subacta,\nPraeter atrocem animum Catonis.\"\n[\"And conquered all but the indomitable mind of Cato.\"\n--Horace, Od., ii. 1, 23.]\nAnd the master of the choir, after having set forth all the great names\nof the greatest Romans, ends thus:\n\"His dantem jura Catonem.\"\n[\"Cato giving laws to all the rest.\"--AEneid, viii. 670.]\nCHAPTER XXXVII\nTHAT WE LAUGH AND CRY FOR THE SAME THING\nWhen we read in history that Antigonus was very much displeased with his\nson for presenting him the head of King Pyrrhus his enemy, but newly\nslain fighting against him, and that seeing it, he wept; and that Rene,\nDuke of Lorraine, also lamented the death of Charles, Duke of Burgundy,\nwhom he had himself defeated, and appeared in mourning at his funeral;\nand that in the battle of D'Auray (which Count Montfort obtained over\nCharles de Blois, his competitor for the duchy of Brittany), the\nconqueror meeting the dead body of his enemy, was very much afflicted at\nhis death, we must not presently cry out:\n\"E cosi avven, the l'animo ciascuna\nSua passion sotto 'l contrario manto,\nRicopre, con la vista or'chiara, or'bruna.\"\n[\"And thus it happens that the mind of each veils its passion under\na different appearance, and beneath a smiling visage, gay beneath a\nsombre air.\"--Petrarch.]\nWhen Pompey's head was presented to Caesar, the histories tell us that he\nturned away his face, as from a sad and unpleasing object.  There had\nbeen so long an intelligence and society betwixt them in the management\nof the public affairs, so great a community of fortunes, so many mutual\noffices, and so near an alliance, that this countenance of his ought not\nto suffer under any misinterpretation, or to be suspected for either\nfalse or counterfeit, as this other seems to believe:\n\"Tutumque putavit\nJam bonus esse socer; lacrymae non sponte cadentes,\nEffudit, gemitusque expressit pectore laeto;\"\n[\"And now he thought it safe to play the kind father-in-law,\nshedding forced tears, and from a joyful breast discharging sighs\nand groans.\"--Lucan, ix. 1037.]\nfor though it be true that the greatest part of our actions are no other\nthan visor and disguise, and that it may sometimes be true that\n\"Haeredis fletus sub persona rises est,\"\n[\"The heir's tears behind the mask are smiles.\"\n--Publius Syrus, apud Gellium, xvii. 14.]\nyet, in judging of these accidents, we are to consider how much our souls\nare oftentimes agitated with divers passions.  And as they say that in\nour bodies there is a congregation of divers humours, of which that is\nthe sovereign which, according to the complexion we are of, is commonly\nmost predominant in us: so, though the soul have in it divers motions to\ngive it agitation, yet must there of necessity be one to overrule all the\nrest, though not with so necessary and absolute a dominion but that\nthrough the flexibility and inconstancy of the soul, those of less\nauthority may upon occasion reassume their place and make a little sally\nin turn.  Thence it is, that we see not only children, who innocently\nobey and follow nature, often laugh and cry at the same thing, but not\none of us can boast, what journey soever he may have in hand that he has\nthe most set his heart upon, but when he comes to part with his family\nand friends, he will find something that troubles him within; and though\nhe refrain his tears yet he puts foot in the stirrup with a sad and\ncloudy countenance.  And what gentle flame soever may warm the heart of\nmodest and wellborn virgins, yet are they fain to be forced from about\ntheir mothers' necks to be put to bed to their husbands, whatever this\nboon companion is pleased to say:\n\"Estne novis nuptis odio Venus?  anne parentum\nFrustrantur falsis gaudia lachrymulis,\nUbertim thalami quasi intra limina fundunt?\nNon, ita me divi, vera gemunt, juverint.\"\n[\"Is Venus really so alarming to the new-made bride, or does she\nhonestly oppose her parent's rejoicing the tears she so abundantly\nsheds on entering the nuptial chamber?  No, by the Gods, these are\nno true tears.\"--Catullus, lxvi. 15.]\n[\"Is Venus really so repugnant to newly-married maids?  Do they meet\nthe smiles of parents with feigned tears?  They weep copiously\nwithin the very threshold of the nuptial chamber.  No, so the gods\nhelp me, they do not truly grieve.\"--Catullus, lxvi.  15.]--\n[A more literal translation.  D.W.]\nNeither is it strange to lament a person dead whom a man would by no\nmeans should be alive.  When I rattle my man, I do it with all the mettle\nI have, and load him with no feigned, but downright real curses; but the\nheat being over, if he should stand in need of me, I should be very ready\nto do him good: for I instantly turn the leaf.  When I call him calf and\ncoxcomb, I do not pretend to entail those titles upon him for ever;\nneither do I think I give myself the lie in calling him an honest fellow\npresently after.  No one quality engrosses us purely and universally.\nWere it not the sign of a fool to talk to one's self, there would hardly\nbe a day or hour wherein I might not be heard to grumble and mutter to\nmyself and against myself, \"Confound the fool!\" and yet I do not think\nthat to be my definition.  Who for seeing me one while cold and presently\nvery fond towards my wife, believes the one or the other to be\ncounterfeited, is an ass.  Nero, taking leave of his mother whom he was\nsending to be drowned, was nevertheless sensible of some emotion at this\nfarewell, and was struck with horror and pity.  'Tis said, that the light\nof the sun is not one continuous thing, but that he darts new rays so\nthick one upon another that we cannot perceive the intermission:\n\"Largus enim liquidi fons luminis, aetherius sol,\nIrrigat assidue coelum candore recenti,\nSuppeditatque novo confestim lumine lumen.\"\n[\"So the wide fountain of liquid light, the ethereal sun, steadily\nfertilises the heavens with new heat, and supplies a continuous\nstore of fresh light.\"--Lucretius, v. 282.]\nJust so the soul variously and imperceptibly darts out her passions.\nArtabanus coming by surprise once upon his nephew Xerxes, chid him for\nthe sudden alteration of his countenance.  He was considering the\nimmeasurable greatness of his forces passing over the Hellespont for the\nGrecian expedition: he was first seized with a palpitation of joy, to see\nso many millions of men under his command, and this appeared in the\ngaiety of his looks: but his thoughts at the same instant suggesting to\nhim that of so many lives, within a century at most, there would not be\none left, he presently knit his brows and grew sad, even to tears.\nWe have resolutely pursued the revenge of an injury received, and been\nsensible of a singular contentment for the victory; but we shall weep\nnotwithstanding.  'Tis not for the victory, though, that we shall weep:\nthere is nothing altered in that but the soul looks upon things with\nanother eye and represents them to itself with another kind of face; for\neverything has many faces and several aspects.\nRelations, old acquaintances, and friendships, possess our imaginations\nand make them tender for the time, according to their condition; but the\nturn is so quick, that 'tis gone in a moment:\n\"Nil adeo fieri celeri ratione videtur,\nQuam si mens fieri proponit, et inchoat ipsa,\nOcius ergo animus, quam res se perciet ulla,\nAnte oculos quorum in promptu natura videtur;\"\n[\"Nothing therefore seems to be done in so swift a manner than if\nthe mind proposes it to be done, and itself begins.  It is more\nactive than anything which we see in nature.\"--Lucretius, iii. 183.]\nand therefore, if we would make one continued thing of all this\nsuccession of passions, we deceive ourselves.  When Timoleon laments the\nmurder he had committed upon so mature and generous deliberation, he does\nnot lament the liberty restored to his country, he does not lament the\ntyrant; but he laments his brother: one part of his duty is performed;\nlet us give him leave to perform the other.\nCHAPTER XXXVIII\nOF SOLITUDE\nLet us pretermit that long comparison betwixt the active and the solitary\nlife; and as for the fine sayings with which ambition and avarice\npalliate their vices, that we are not born for ourselves but for the\npublic,--[This is the eulogium passed by Lucan on Cato of Utica, ii.\n383.]--let us boldly appeal to those who are in public affairs; let them\nlay their hands upon their hearts, and then say whether, on the contrary,\nthey do not rather aspire to titles and offices and that tumult of the\nworld to make their private advantage at the public expense.  The corrupt\nways by which in this our time they arrive at the height to which their\nambitions aspire, manifestly enough declares that their ends cannot be\nvery good.  Let us tell ambition that it is she herself who gives us a\ntaste of solitude; for what does she so much avoid as society?  What does\nshe so much seek as elbowroom?  A man many do well or ill everywhere; but\nif what Bias says be true, that the greatest part is the worse part, or\nwhat the Preacher says: there is not one good of a thousand:\n\"Rari quippe boni: numero vix sunt totidem quot\nThebarum portae, vel divitis ostia Nili,\"\n[\"Good men forsooth are scarce: there are hardly as many as there\nare gates of Thebes or mouths of the rich Nile.\"\n--Juvenal, Sat., xiii. 26.]\nthe contagion is very dangerous in the crowd.  A man must either imitate\nthe vicious or hate them both are dangerous things, either to resemble\nthem because they are many or to hate many because they are unresembling\nto ourselves.  Merchants who go to sea are in the right when they are\ncautious that those who embark with them in the same bottom be neither\ndissolute blasphemers nor vicious other ways, looking upon such society\nas unfortunate.  And therefore it was that Bias pleasantly said to some,\nwho being with him in a dangerous storm implored the assistance of the\ngods: \"Peace, speak softly,\" said he, \"that they may not know you are\nhere in my company.\"--[Diogenes Laertius]--And of more pressing\nexample, Albuquerque, viceroy in the Indies for Emmanuel, king of\nPortugal, in an extreme peril of shipwreck, took a young boy upon his\nshoulders, for this only end that, in the society of their common danger\nhis innocence might serve to protect him, and to recommend him to the\ndivine favour, that they might get safe to shore.  'Tis not that a wise\nman may not live everywhere content, and be alone in the very crowd of a\npalace; but if it be left to his own choice, the schoolman will tell you\nthat he should fly the very sight of the crowd: he will endure it if need\nbe; but if it be referred to him, he will choose to be alone.  He cannot\nthink himself sufficiently rid of vice, if he must yet contend with it in\nother men.  Charondas punished those as evil men who were convicted of\nkeeping ill company.  There is nothing so unsociable and sociable as man,\nthe one by his vice, the other by his nature.  And Antisthenes, in my\nopinion, did not give him a satisfactory answer, who reproached him with\nfrequenting ill company, by saying that the physicians lived well enough\namongst the sick, for if they contribute to the health of the sick, no\ndoubt but by the contagion, continual sight of, and familiarity with\ndiseases, they must of necessity impair their own.\nNow the end, I take it, is all one, to live at more leisure and at one's\nease: but men do not always take the right way.  They often think they\nhave totally taken leave of all business, when they have only exchanged\none employment for another: there is little less trouble in governing a\nprivate family than a whole kingdom.  Wherever the mind is perplexed, it\nis in an entire disorder, and domestic employments are not less\ntroublesome for being less important.  Moreover, for having shaken off\nthe court and the exchange, we have not taken leave of the principal\nvexations of life:\n\"Ratio et prudentia curas,\nNon locus effusi late maris arbiter, aufert;\"\n[\"Reason and prudence, not a place with a commanding view of the\ngreat ocean, banish care.\"--Horace, Ep., i. 2.]\nambition, avarice, irresolution, fear, and inordinate desires, do not\nleave us because we forsake our native country:\n\"Et\nPost equitem sedet atra cura;\"\n[\"Black care sits behind the horse man.\"\n--Horace, Od., iii. 1, 40].\nthey often follow us even to cloisters and philosophical schools; nor\ndeserts, nor caves, hair-shirts, nor fasts, can disengage us from them:\n\"Haeret lateri lethalis arundo.\"\n[\"The fatal shaft adheres to the side.\"--AEneid, iv. 73.]\nOne telling Socrates that such a one was nothing improved by his travels:\n\"I very well believe it,\" said he, \"for he took himself along with him\"\n\"Quid terras alio calentes\nSole mutamus?  patriae quis exsul\nSe quoque fugit?\"\n[\"Why do we seek climates warmed by another sun?  Who is the man\nthat by fleeing from his country, can also flee from himself?\"\n--Horace, Od., ii. 16, 18.]\nIf a man do not first discharge both himself and his mind of the burden\nwith which he finds himself oppressed, motion will but make it press the\nharder and sit the heavier, as the lading of a ship is of less\nencumbrance when fast and bestowed in a settled posture.  You do a sick\nman more harm than good in removing him from place to place; you fix and\nestablish the disease by motion, as stakes sink deeper and more firmly\ninto the earth by being moved up and down in the place where they are\ndesigned to stand.  Therefore, it is not enough to get remote from the\npublic; 'tis not enough to shift the soil only; a man must flee from the\npopular conditions that have taken possession of his soul, he must\nsequester and come again to himself:\n\"Rupi jam vincula, dicas\nNam luctata canis nodum arripit; attamen illi,\nQuum fugit, a collo trahitur pars longa catenae.\"\n[\"You say, perhaps, you have broken your chains: the dog who after\nlong efforts has broken his chain, still in his flight drags a heavy\nportion of it after him.\"--Persius, Sat., v. 158.]\nWe still carry our fetters along with us.  'Tis not an absolute liberty;\nwe yet cast back a look upon what we have left behind us; the fancy is\nstill full of it:\n\"Nisi purgatum est pectus, quae praelia nobis\nAtque pericula tunc ingratis insinuandum?\nQuantae connscindunt hominem cupedinis acres\nSollicitum curae? quantique perinde timores?\nQuidve superbia, spurcitia, ac petulantia, quantas\nEfficiunt clades? quid luxus desidiesque?\"\n[\"But unless the mind is purified, what internal combats and dangers\nmust we incur in spite of all our efforts!  How many bitter\nanxieties, how many terrors, follow upon unregulated passion!\nWhat destruction befalls us from pride, lust, petulant anger!\nWhat evils arise from luxury and sloth!\"--Lucretius, v. 4.]\nOur disease lies in the mind, which cannot escape from itself;\n\"In culpa est animus, qui se non effugit unquam,\"\n--Horace, Ep., i. 14, 13.\nand therefore is to be called home and confined within itself: that is\nthe true solitude, and that may be enjoyed even in populous cities and\nthe courts of kings, though more commodiously apart.\nNow, since we will attempt to live alone, and to waive all manner of\nconversation amongst them, let us so order it that our content may depend\nwholly upon ourselves; let us dissolve all obligations that ally us to\nothers; let us obtain this from ourselves, that we may live alone in good\nearnest, and live at our ease too.\nStilpo having escaped from the burning of his town, where he lost wife,\nchildren, and goods, Demetrius Poliorcetes seeing him, in so great a ruin\nof his country, appear with an undisturbed countenance, asked him if he\nhad received no loss?  To which he made answer, No; and that, thank God,\nnothing was lost of his.--[Seneca, Ep. 7.]--This also was the meaning of\nthe philosopher Antisthenes, when he pleasantly said, that \"men should\nfurnish themselves with such things as would float, and might with the\nowner escape the storm\";--[Diogenes Laertius, vi. 6.] and certainly a\nwise man never loses anything if he have himself.  When the city of Nola\nwas ruined by the barbarians, Paulinus, who was bishop of that place,\nhaving there lost all he had, himself a prisoner, prayed after this\nmanner: \"O Lord, defend me from being sensible of this loss; for Thou\nknowest they have yet touched nothing of that which is mine.\"--[St.\nAugustin, De Civit. Dei, i. 10.]--The riches that made him rich and the\ngoods that made him good, were still kept entire.  This it is to make\nchoice of treasures that can secure themselves from plunder and violence,\nand to hide them in such a place into which no one can enter and that is\nnot to be betrayed by any but ourselves.  Wives, children, and goods must\nbe had, and especially health, by him that can get it; but we are not so\nto set our hearts upon them that our happiness must have its dependence\nupon them; we must reserve a backshop, wholly our own and entirely free,\nwherein to settle our true liberty, our principal solitude and retreat.\nAnd in this we must for the most part entertain ourselves with ourselves,\nand so privately that no exotic knowledge or communication be admitted\nthere; there to laugh and to talk, as if without wife, children, goods,\ntrain, or attendance, to the end that when it shall so fall out that we\nmust lose any or all of these, it may be no new thing to be without them.\nWe have a mind pliable in itself, that will be company; that has\nwherewithal to attack and to defend, to receive and to give: let us not\nthen fear in this solitude to languish under an uncomfortable vacuity.\n\"In solis sis tibi turba locis.\"\n[\"In solitude, be company for thyself.\"--Tibullus, vi. 13. 12.]\nVirtue is satisfied with herself, without discipline, without words,\nwithout effects.  In our ordinary actions there is not one of a thousand\nthat concerns ourselves.  He that thou seest scrambling up the ruins of\nthat wall, furious and transported, against whom so many harquebuss-shots\nare levelled; and that other all over scars, pale, and fainting with\nhunger, and yet resolved rather to die than to open the gates to him;\ndost thou think that these men are there upon their own account?  No;\nperadventure in the behalf of one whom they never saw and who never\nconcerns himself for their pains and danger, but lies wallowing the while\nin sloth and pleasure: this other slavering, blear-eyed, slovenly fellow,\nthat thou seest come out of his study after midnight, dost thou think he\nhas been tumbling over books to learn how to become a better man, wiser,\nand more content?  No such matter; he will there end his days, but he\nwill teach posterity the measure of Plautus' verses and the true\northography of a Latin word.  Who is it that does not voluntarily\nexchange his health, his repose, and his very life for reputation and\nglory, the most useless, frivolous, and false coin that passes current\namongst us?  Our own death does not sufficiently terrify and trouble us;\nlet us, moreover, charge ourselves with those of our wives, children, and\nfamily: our own affairs do not afford us anxiety enough; let us undertake\nthose of our neighbours and friends, still more to break our brains and\ntorment us:\n\"Vah! quemquamne hominem in animum instituere, aut\nParare, quod sit carius, quam ipse est sibi?\"\n[\"Ah! can any man conceive in his mind or realise what is dearer\nthan he is to himself?\"--Terence, Adelph., i. I, 13.]\nSolitude seems to me to wear the best favour in such as have already\nemployed their most active and flourishing age in the world's service,\nafter the example of Thales.  We have lived enough for others; let us at\nleast live out the small remnant of life for ourselves; let us now call\nin our thoughts and intentions to ourselves, and to our own ease and\nrepose.  'Tis no light thing to make a sure retreat; it will be enough\nfor us to do without mixing other enterprises.  Since God gives us\nleisure to order our removal, let us make ready, truss our baggage, take\nleave betimes of the company, and disentangle ourselves from those\nviolent importunities that engage us elsewhere and separate us from\nourselves.\nWe must break the knot of our obligations, how strong soever, and\nhereafter love this or that, but espouse nothing but ourselves: that is\nto say, let the remainder be our own, but not so joined and so close as\nnot to be forced away without flaying us or tearing out part of our\nwhole.  The greatest thing in the world is for a man to know that he is\nhis own.  'Tis time to wean ourselves from society when we can no longer\nadd anything to it; he who is not in a condition to lend must forbid\nhimself to borrow.  Our forces begin to fail us; let us call them in and\nconcentrate them in and for ourselves.  He that can cast off within\nhimself and resolve the offices of friendship and company, let him do it.\nIn this decay of nature which renders him useless, burdensome, and\nimportunate to others, let him take care not to be useless, burdensome,\nand importunate to himself.  Let him soothe and caress himself, and above\nall things be sure to govern himself with reverence to his reason and\nconscience to that degree as to be ashamed to make a false step in their\npresence:\n\"Rarum est enim, ut satis se quisque vereatur.\"\n[\"For 'tis rarely seen that men have respect and reverence enough\nfor themselves.\"--Quintilian, x. 7.]\nSocrates says that boys are to cause themselves to be instructed, men to\nexercise themselves in well-doing, and old men to retire from all civil\nand military employments, living at their own discretion, without the\nobligation to any office. There are some complexions more proper for\nthese precepts of retirement than others.  Such as are of a soft and dull\napprehension, and of a tender will and affection, not readily to be\nsubdued or employed, whereof I am one, both by natural condition and by\nreflection, will sooner incline to this advice than active and busy\nsouls, which embrace: all, engage in all, are hot upon everything, which\noffer, present, and give themselves up to every occasion.  We are to use\nthese accidental and extraneous commodities, so far as they are pleasant\nto us, but by no means to lay our principal foundation there; 'tis no\ntrue one; neither nature nor reason allows it so to be.  Why therefore\nshould we, contrary to their laws, enslave our own contentment to the\npower of another?  To anticipate also the accidents of fortune, to\ndeprive ourselves of the conveniences we have in our own power, as\nseveral have done upon the account of devotion, and some philosophers by\nreasoning; to be one's own servant, to lie hard, to put out our own eyes,\nto throw our wealth into the river, to go in search of grief; these, by\nthe misery of this life, aiming at bliss in another; those by laying\nthemselves low to avoid the danger of falling: all such are acts of an\nexcessive virtue.  The stoutest and most resolute natures render even\ntheir seclusion glorious and exemplary:\n\"Tuta et parvula laudo,\nQuum res deficiunt, satis inter vilia fortis\nVerum, ubi quid melius contingit et unctius, idem\nHos sapere et solos aio bene vivere, quorum\nConspicitur nitidis fundata pecunia villis.\"\n[\"When means are deficient, I laud a safe and humble condition,\ncontent with little: but when things grow better and more easy, I\nall the same say that you alone are wise and live well, whose\ninvested money is visible in beautiful villas.\"\n--Horace, Ep., i. 15, 42.]\nA great deal less would serve my turn well enough.  'Tis enough for me,\nunder fortune's favour, to prepare myself for her disgrace, and, being at\nmy ease, to represent to myself, as far as my imagination can stretch,\nthe ill to come; as we do at jousts and tiltings, where we counterfeit\nwar in the greatest calm of peace.  I do not think Arcesilaus the\nphilosopher the less temperate and virtuous for knowing that he made use\nof gold and silver vessels, when the condition of his fortune allowed him\nso to do; I have indeed a better opinion of him than if he had denied\nhimself what he used with liberality and moderation.  I see the utmost\nlimits of natural necessity: and considering a poor man begging at my\ndoor, ofttimes more jocund and more healthy than I myself am, I put\nmyself into his place, and attempt to dress my mind after his mode;\nand running, in like manner, over other examples, though I fancy death,\npoverty, contempt, and sickness treading on my heels, I easily resolve\nnot to be affrighted, forasmuch as a less than I takes them with so much\npatience; and am not willing to believe that a less understanding can do\nmore than a greater, or that the effects of precept cannot arrive to as\ngreat a height as those of custom.  And knowing of how uncertain duration\nthese accidental conveniences are, I never forget, in the height of all\nmy enjoyments, to make it my chiefest prayer to Almighty God, that He\nwill please to render me content with myself and the condition wherein I\nam.  I see young men very gay and frolic, who nevertheless keep a mass of\npills in their trunk at home, to take when they've got a cold, which they\nfear so much the less, because they think they have remedy at hand.\nEvery one should do in like manner, and, moreover, if they find\nthemselves subject to some more violent disease, should furnish\nthemselves with such medicines as may numb and stupefy the part.\nThe employment a man should choose for such a life ought neither to be a\nlaborious nor an unpleasing one; otherwise 'tis to no purpose at all to\nbe retired.  And this depends upon every one's liking and humour.  Mine\nhas no manner of complacency for husbandry, and such as love it ought to\napply themselves to it with moderation:\n[\"Endeavour to make circumstances subject to me,\nand not me subject to circumstances.\"\n--Horace, Ep., i. i, 19.]\nHusbandry is otherwise a very servile employment, as Sallust calls it;\nthough some parts of it are more excusable than the rest, as the care of\ngardens, which Xenophon attributes to Cyrus; and a mean may be found out\nbetwixt the sordid and low application, so full of perpetual solicitude,\nwhich is seen in men who make it their entire business and study, and the\nstupid and extreme negligence, letting all things go at random which we\nsee in others\n\"Democriti pecus edit agellos\nCultaque, dum peregre est animus sine corpore velox.\"\n[\"Democritus' cattle eat his corn and spoil his fields, whilst his\nsoaring mind ranges abroad without the body.\"\n--Horace, Ep., i, 12, 12.]\nBut let us hear what advice the younger Pliny gives his friend Caninius\nRufus upon the subject of solitude: \"I advise thee, in the full and\nplentiful retirement wherein thou art, to leave to thy hinds the care of\nthy husbandry, and to addict thyself to the study of letters, to extract\nfrom thence something that may be entirely and absolutely thine own.\"  By\nwhich he means reputation; like Cicero, who says that he would employ his\nsolitude and retirement from public affairs to acquire by his writings an\nimmortal life.\n\"Usque adeone\nScire tuum, nihil est, nisi to scire hoc, sciat alter?\"\n[\"Is all that thy learning nothing, unless another knows\nthat thou knowest?\"--Persius, Sat., i. 23.]\nIt appears to be reason, when a man talks of retiring from the world,\nthat he should look quite out of [for] himself.  These do it but by\nhalves: they design well enough for themselves when they shall be no more\nin it; but still they pretend to extract the fruits of that design from\nthe world, when absent from it, by a ridiculous contradiction.\nThe imagination of those who seek solitude upon the account of devotion,\nfilling their hopes and courage with certainty of divine promises in the\nother life, is much more rationally founded.  They propose to themselves\nGod, an infinite object in goodness and power; the soul has there\nwherewithal, at full liberty, to satiate her desires: afflictions and\nsufferings turn to their advantage, being undergone for the acquisition\nof eternal health and joy; death is to be wished and longed for, where it\nis the passage to so perfect a condition; the asperity of the rules they\nimpose upon themselves is immediately softened by custom, and all their\ncarnal appetites baffled and subdued, by refusing to humour and feed\nthem, these being only supported by use and exercise.  This sole end of\nanother happily immortal life is that which really merits that we should\nabandon the pleasures and conveniences of this; and he who can really and\nconstantly inflame his soul with the ardour of this vivid faith and hope,\nerects for himself in solitude a more voluptuous and delicious life than\nany other sort of existence.\nNeither the end, then, nor the means of this advice pleases me, for we\noften fall out of the frying-pan into the fire.--[or: we always relapse\nill from fever into fever.]--This  book-employment is as painful as any\nother, and as great an enemy to health, which ought to be the first thing\nconsidered; neither ought a man to be allured with the pleasure of it,\nwhich is the same that destroys the frugal, the avaricious, the\nvoluptuous, and the ambitious man.\n[\"This plodding occupation of bookes is as painfull as any other,\nand as great an enemie vnto health, which ought principally to be\nconsidered.  And a man should not suffer him selfe to be inveagled\nby the pleasure he takes in them.\"--Florio, edit. 1613, p. 122.]\nThe sages give us caution enough to beware the treachery of our desires,\nand to distinguish true and entire pleasures from such as are mixed and\ncomplicated with greater pain.  For the most of our pleasures, say they,\nwheedle and caress only to strangle us, like those thieves the Egyptians\ncalled Philistae; if the headache should come before drunkenness, we\nshould have a care of drinking too much; but pleasure, to deceive us,\nmarches before and conceals her train.  Books are pleasant, but if, by\nbeing over-studious, we impair our health and spoil our goodhumour, the\nbest pieces we have, let us give it over; I, for my part, am one of those\nwho think, that no fruit derived from them can recompense so great a\nloss.  As men who have long felt themselves weakened by indisposition,\ngive themselves up at last to the mercy of medicine and submit to certain\nrules of living, which they are for the future never to transgress; so he\nwho retires, weary of and disgusted with the common way of living, ought\nto model this new one he enters into by the rules of reason, and to\ninstitute and establish it by premeditation and reflection.  He ought to\nhave taken leave of all sorts of labour, what advantage soever it may\npromise, and generally to have shaken off all those passions which\ndisturb the tranquillity of body and soul, and then choose the way that\nbest suits with his own humour:\n\"Unusquisque sua noverit ire via.\"\nIn husbandry, study, hunting, and all other exercises, men are to proceed\nto the utmost limits of pleasure, but must take heed of engaging further,\nwhere trouble begins to mix with it.  We are to reserve so much\nemployment only as is necessary to keep us in breath and to defend us\nfrom the inconveniences that the other extreme of a dull and stupid\nlaziness brings along with it.  There are sterile knotty sciences,\nchiefly hammered out for the crowd; let such be left to them who are\nengaged in the world's service.  I for my part care for no other books,\nbut either such as are pleasant and easy, to amuse me, or those that\ncomfort and instruct me how to regulate my life and death:\n\"Tacitum sylvas inter reptare salubres,\nCurantem, quidquid dignum sapienti bonoque est.\"\n[\"Silently meditating in the healthy groves, whatever is worthy\nof a wise and good man.\"--Horace, Ep., i. 4, 4.]\nWiser men, having great force and vigour of soul, may propose to\nthemselves a rest wholly spiritual but for me, who have a very ordinary\nsoul, it is very necessary to support myself with bodily conveniences;\nand age having of late deprived me of those pleasures that were more\nacceptable to me, I instruct and whet my appetite to those that remain,\nmore suitable to this other reason.  We ought to hold with all our force,\nboth of hands and teeth, the use of the pleasures of life that our years,\none after another, snatch away from us:\n\"Carpamus dulcia; nostrum est,\nQuod vivis; cinis, et manes, et fabula fies.\"\n[\"Let us pluck life's sweets, 'tis for them we live: by and by we\nshall be ashes, a ghost, a mere subject of talk.\"\n--Persius, Sat., v. 151.]\nNow, as to the end that Pliny and Cicero propose to us of glory, 'tis\ninfinitely wide of my account.  Ambition is of all others the most\ncontrary humour to solitude; glory and repose are things that cannot\npossibly inhabit in one and the same place.  For so much as I understand,\nthese have only their arms and legs disengaged from the crowd; their soul\nand intention remain confined behind more than ever:\n\"Tun', vetule, auriculis alienis colligis escas?\"\n[\"Dost thou, then, old man, collect food for others' ears?\"\n--Persius, Sat., i. 22.]\nthey have only retired to take a better leap, and by a stronger motion to\ngive a brisker charge into the crowd.  Will you see how they shoot short?\nLet us put into the counterpoise the advice of two philosophers, of two\nvery different sects, writing, the one to Idomeneus, the other to\nLucilius, their friends, to retire into solitude from worldly honours and\naffairs.  \"You have,\" say they, \"hitherto lived swimming and floating;\ncome now and die in the harbour: you have given the first part of your\nlife to the light, give what remains to the shade.  It is impossible to\ngive over business, if you do not also quit the fruit; therefore\ndisengage yourselves from all concern of name and glory; 'tis to be\nfeared the lustre of your former actions will give you but too much\nlight, and follow you into your most private retreat.  Quit with other\npleasures that which proceeds from the approbation of another man: and as\nto your knowledge and parts, never concern yourselves; they will not lose\ntheir effect if yourselves be the better for them.  Remember him, who\nbeing asked why he took so much pains in an art that could come to the\nknowledge of but few persons?  'A few are enough for me,' replied he;\n'I have enough with one; I have enough with never an one.'--[Seneca, Ep.,\n7.]--He said true; you and a companion are theatre enough to one\nanother, or you to yourself.  Let the people be to you one, and be you\none to the whole people.  'Tis an unworthy ambition to think to derive\nglory from a man's sloth and privacy: you are to do like the beasts of\nchase, who efface the track at the entrance into their den.  You are no\nmore to concern yourself how the world talks of you, but how you are to\ntalk to yourself.  Retire yourself into yourself, but first prepare\nyourself there to receive yourself: it were a folly to trust yourself in\nyour own hands, if you cannot govern yourself.  A man may miscarry alone\nas well as in company.  Till you have rendered yourself one before whom\nyou dare not trip, and till you have a bashfulness and respect for\nyourself,\n\"Obversentur species honestae animo;\"\n[\"Let honest things be ever present to the mind\"\n--Cicero, Tusc. Quaes., ii. 22.]\npresent continually to your imagination Cato, Phocion, and Aristides, in\nwhose presence the fools themselves will hide their faults, and make them\ncontrollers of all your intentions; should these deviate from virtue,\nyour respect to those will set you right; they will keep you in this way\nto be contented with yourself; to borrow nothing of any other but\nyourself; to stay and fix your soul in certain and limited thoughts,\nwherein she may please herself, and having understood the true and real\ngoods, which men the more enjoy the more they understand, to rest\nsatisfied, without desire of prolongation of life or name.\"  This is the\nprecept of the true and natural philosophy, not of a boasting and prating\nphilosophy, such as that of the two former.\nETEXT EDITOR'S BOOKMARKS:\nA man must either imitate the vicious or hate them\nAbhorrence of the patient are necessary circumstances\nAcquire by his writings an immortal life\nAddict thyself

This great\nFrench writer deserves to be regarded as a classic, not only in the land\nof his birth, but in all countries and in all literatures.  His Essays,\nwhich are at once the most celebrated and the most permanent of his\nproductions, form a magazine out of which such minds as those of Bacon\nand Shakespeare did not disdain to help themselves; and, indeed, as\nHallam observes, the Frenchman's literary importance largely results from\nthe share which his mind had in influencing other minds, coeval and\nsubsequent.  But, at the same time, estimating the value and rank of the\nessayist, we are not to leave out of the account the drawbacks and the\ncircumstances of the period: the imperfect state of education, the\ncomparative scarcity of books, and the limited opportunities of\nintellectual intercourse.  Montaigne freely borrowed of others, and he\nhas found men willing to borrow of him as freely.  We need not wonder at\nthe reputation which he with seeming facility achieved.  He was, without\nbeing aware of it, the leader of a new school in letters and morals.  His\nbook was different from all others which were at that date in the world.\nIt diverted the ancient currents of thought into new channels.  It told\nits readers, with unexampled frankness, what its writer's opinion was\nabout men and things, and threw what must have been a strange kind of new\nlight on many matters but darkly understood.  Above all, the essayist\nuncased himself, and made his intellectual and physical organism public\nproperty.  He took the world into his confidence on all subjects.  His\nessays were a sort of literary anatomy, where we get a diagnosis of the\nwriter's mind, made by himself at different levels and under a large\nvariety of operating influences.\nOf all egotists, Montaigne, if not the greatest, was the most\nfascinating, because, perhaps, he was the least affected and most\ntruthful.  What he did, and what he had professed to do, was to dissect\nhis mind, and show us, as best he could, how it was made, and what\nrelation it bore to external objects.  He investigated his mental\nstructure as a schoolboy pulls his watch to pieces, to examine the\nmechanism of the works; and the result, accompanied by illustrations\nabounding with originality and force, he delivered to his fellow-men in a\nbook.\nEloquence, rhetorical effect, poetry, were alike remote from his design.\nHe did not write from necessity, scarcely perhaps for fame.  But he\ndesired to leave France, nay, and the world, something to be remembered\nby, something which should tell what kind of a man he was--what he felt,\nthought, suffered--and he succeeded immeasurably, I apprehend, beyond his\nexpectations.\nIt was reasonable enough that Montaigne should expect for his work a\ncertain share of celebrity in Gascony, and even, as time went on,\nthroughout France; but it is scarcely probable that he foresaw how his\nrenown was to become world-wide; how he was to occupy an almost unique\nposition as a man of letters and a moralist; how the Essays would be\nread, in all the principal languages of Europe, by millions of\nintelligent human beings, who never heard of Perigord or the League, and\nwho are in doubt, if they are questioned, whether the author lived in the\nsixteenth or the eighteenth century.  This is true fame.  A man of genius\nbelongs to no period and no country.  He speaks the language of nature,\nwhich is always everywhere the same.\nThe text of these volumes is taken from the first edition of Cotton's\nversion, printed in 3 vols.  8vo, 1685-6, and republished in 1693, 1700,\n1711, 1738, and 1743, in the same number of volumes and the same size.\nIn the earliest impression the errors of the press are corrected merely\nas far as page 240 of the first volume, and all the editions follow one\nanother.  That of 1685-6 was the only one which the translator lived to\nsee.  He died in 1687, leaving behind him an interesting and little-known\ncollection of poems, which appeared posthumously, 8vo, 1689.\nIt was considered imperative to correct Cotton's translation by a careful\ncollation with the 'variorum' edition of the original, Paris, 1854,\n4 vols.  8vo or 12mo, and parallel passages from Florin's earlier\nundertaking have occasionally been inserted at the foot of the page.  A\nLife of the Author and all his recovered Letters, sixteen in number, have\nalso been given; but, as regards the correspondence, it can scarcely be\ndoubted that it is in a purely fragmentary state.  To do more than\nfurnish a sketch of the leading incidents in Montaigne's life seemed, in\nthe presence of Bayle St. John's charming and able biography, an attempt\nas difficult as it was useless.\nThe besetting sin of both Montaigne's translators seems to have been a\npropensity for reducing his language and phraseology to the language and\nphraseology of the age and country to which they belonged, and, moreover,\ninserting paragraphs and words, not here and there only, but constantly\nand habitually, from an evident desire and view to elucidate or\nstrengthen their author's meaning.  The result has generally been\nunfortunate; and I have, in the case of all these interpolations on\nCotton's part, felt bound, where I did not cancel them, to throw them\ndown into the notes, not thinking it right that Montaigne should be\nallowed any longer to stand sponsor for what he never wrote; and\nreluctant, on the other hand, to suppress the intruding matter entirely,\nwhere it appeared to possess a value of its own.\nNor is redundancy or paraphrase the only form of transgression in Cotton,\nfor there are places in his author which he thought proper to omit, and\nit is hardly necessary to say that the restoration of all such matter to\nthe text was considered essential to its integrity and completeness.\nMy warmest thanks are due to my father, Mr Registrar Hazlitt, the author\nof the well-known and excellent edition of Montaigne published in 1842,\nfor the important assistance which he has rendered to me in verifying and\nretranslating the quotations, which were in a most corrupt state, and of\nwhich Cotton's English versions were singularly loose and inexact, and\nfor the zeal with which he has co-operated with me in collating the\nEnglish text, line for line and word for word, with the best French\nedition.\nBy the favour of Mr F. W. Cosens, I have had by me, while at work on this\nsubject, the copy of Cotgrave's Dictionary, folio, 1650, which belonged\nto Cotton.  It has his autograph and copious MSS.  notes, nor is it too\nmuch to presume that it is the very book employed by him in his\ntranslation.\nW.  C.

This biography is the more desirable that\nit contains all really interesting and important matter in the journal of\nthe Tour in Germany and Italy, which, as it was merely written under\nMontaigne's dictation, is in the third person, is scarcely worth\npublication, as a whole, in an English dress.]\nThe author of the Essays was born, as he informs us himself, between\neleven and twelve o'clock in the day, the last of February 1533, at the\nchateau of St. Michel de Montaigne.  His father, Pierre Eyquem, esquire,\nwas successively first Jurat of the town of Bordeaux (1530), Under-Mayor\n1536, Jurat for the second time in 1540, Procureur in 1546, and at\nlength Mayor from 1553 to 1556.  He was a man of austere probity, who had\n\"a particular regard for honour and for propriety in his person and\nattire .  .  .   a mighty good faith in his speech, and a conscience and\na religious feeling inclining to superstition, rather than to the other\nextreme.\"[Essays, ii. 2.]  Pierre Eyquem bestowed great care on the\neducation of his children, especially on the practical side of it.  To\nassociate closely his son Michel with the people, and attach him to those\nwho stand in need of assistance, he caused him to be held at the font by\npersons of meanest position; subsequently he put him out to nurse with a\npoor villager, and then, at a later period, made him accustom himself to\nthe most common sort of living, taking care, nevertheless, to cultivate\nhis mind, and superintend its development without the exercise of undue\nrigour or constraint.  Michel, who gives us the minutest account of his\nearliest years, charmingly narrates how they used to awake him by the\nsound of some agreeable music, and how he learned Latin, without\nsuffering the rod or shedding a tear, before beginning French, thanks to\nthe German teacher whom his father had placed near him, and who never\naddressed him except in the language of Virgil and Cicero.  The study of\nGreek took precedence.  At six years of age young Montaigne went to the\nCollege of Guienne at Bordeaux, where he had as preceptors the most\neminent scholars of the sixteenth century, Nicolas Grouchy, Guerente,\nMuret, and Buchanan.  At thirteen he had passed through all the classes,\nand as he was destined for the law he left school to study that science.\nHe was then about fourteen, but these early years of his life are\ninvolved in obscurity.  The next information that we have is that in 1554\nhe received the appointment of councillor in the Parliament of Bordeaux;\nin 1559 he was at Bar-le-Duc with the court of Francis II, and in the\nyear following he was present at Rouen to witness the declaration of the\nmajority of Charles IX.  We do not know in what manner he was engaged on\nthese occasions.\nBetween 1556 and 1563 an important incident occurred in the life of\nMontaigne, in the commencement of his romantic friendship with Etienne de\nla Boetie, whom he had met, as he tells us, by pure chance at some\nfestive celebration in the town.  From their very first interview the two\nfound themselves drawn irresistibly close to one another, and during six\nyears this alliance was foremost in the heart of Montaigne, as it was\nafterwards in his memory, when death had severed it.\nAlthough he blames severely in his own book [Essays, i.  27.] those who,\ncontrary to the opinion of Aristotle, marry before five-and-thirty,\nMontaigne did not wait for the period fixed by the philosopher of\nStagyra, but in 1566, in his thirty-third year, he espoused Francoise de\nChassaigne, daughter of a councillor in the Parliament of Bordeaux.  The\nhistory of his early married life vies in obscurity with that of his\nyouth.  His biographers are not agreed among themselves; and in the\nsame degree that he lays open to our view all that concerns his secret\nthoughts, the innermost mechanism of his mind, he observes too much\nreticence in respect to his public functions and conduct, and his social\nrelations.  The title of Gentleman in Ordinary to the King, which he\nassumes, in a preface, and which Henry II.  gives him in a letter, which\nwe print a little farther on; what he says as to the commotions of\ncourts, where he passed a portion of his life; the Instructions which he\nwrote under the dictation of Catherine de Medici for King Charles IX.,\nand his noble correspondence with Henry IV., leave no doubt, however, as\nto the part which he played in the transactions of those times, and we\nfind an unanswerable proof of the esteem in which he was held by the most\nexalted personages, in a letter which was addressed to him by Charles at\nthe time he was admitted to the Order of St. Michael, which was, as he\ninforms us himself, the highest honour of the French noblesse.\nAccording to Lacroix du Maine, Montaigne, upon the death of his eldest\nbrother, resigned his post of Councillor, in order to adopt the military\nprofession, while, if we might credit the President Bouhier, he never\ndischarged any functions connected with arms.  However, several passages\nin the Essays seem to indicate that he not only took service, but that he\nwas actually in numerous campaigns with the Catholic armies.  Let us add,\nthat on his monument he is represented in a coat of mail, with his casque\nand gauntlets on his right side, and a lion at his feet, all which\nsignifies, in the language of funeral emblems, that the departed has been\nengaged in some important military transactions.\nHowever it may be as to these conjectures, our author, having arrived at\nhis thirty-eighth year, resolved to dedicate to study and contemplation\nthe remaining term of his life; and on his birthday, the last of February\n1571, he caused a philosophical inscription, in Latin, to be placed upon\none of the walls of his chateau, where it is still to be seen, and of\nwhich the translation is to this effect:--\"In the year of Christ .  .  .\nin his thirty-eighth year, on the eve of the Calends of March, his\nbirthday, Michel Montaigne, already weary of court employments and public\nhonours, withdrew himself entirely into the converse of the learned\nvirgins where he intends to spend the remaining moiety of the to allotted\nto him in tranquil seclusion.\"\nAt the time to which we have come, Montaigne was unknown to the world of\nletters, except as a translator and editor.  In 1569 he had published a\ntranslation of the \"Natural Theology\" of Raymond de Sebonde, which he had\nsolely undertaken to please his father.  In 1571 he had caused to be\nprinted at Paris certain 'opuscucla' of Etienne de la Boetie; and these\ntwo efforts, inspired in one case by filial duty, and in the other by\nfriendship, prove that affectionate motives overruled with him mere\npersonal ambition as a literary man.  We may suppose that he began to\ncompose the Essays at the very outset of his retirement from public\nengagements; for as, according to his own account, observes the President\nBouhier, he cared neither for the chase, nor building, nor gardening, nor\nagricultural pursuits, and was exclusively occupied with reading and\nreflection, he devoted himself with satisfaction to the task of setting\ndown his thoughts just as they occurred to him.  Those thoughts became a\nbook, and the first part of that book, which was to confer immortality on\nthe writer, appeared at Bordeaux in 1580.  Montaigne was then\nfifty-seven; he had suffered for some years past from renal colic and\ngravel; and it was with the necessity of distraction from his pain, and\nthe hope of deriving relief from the waters, that he undertook at this\ntime a great journey.  As the account which he has left of his travels in\nGermany and Italy comprises some highly interesting particulars of his\nlife and personal history, it seems worth while to furnish a sketch or\nanalysis of it.\n\"The Journey, of which we proceed to describe the course simply,\" says\nthe editor of the Itinerary, \"had, from Beaumont-sur-Oise to Plombieres,\nin Lorraine, nothing sufficiently interesting to detain us .  .  .  we\nmust go as far, as Basle, of which we have a description, acquainting us\nwith its physical and political condition at that period, as well as with\nthe character of its baths.  The passage of Montaigne through Switzerland\nis not without interest, as we see there how our philosophical traveller\naccommodated himself everywhere to the ways of the country.  The hotels,\nthe provisions, the Swiss cookery, everything, was agreeable to him; it\nappears, indeed, as if he preferred to the French manners and tastes\nthose of the places he was visiting, and of which the simplicity and\nfreedom (or frankness) accorded more with his own mode of life and\nthinking.  In the towns where he stayed, Montaigne took care to see the\nProtestant divines, to make himself conversant with all their dogmas.  He\neven had disputations with them occasionally.\n\"Having left Switzerland he went to Isne, an imperial then on to Augsburg\nand Munich.  He afterwards proceeded to the Tyrol, where he was agreeably\nsurprised, after the warnings which he had received, at the very slight\ninconveniences which he suffered, which gave him occasion to remark that\nhe had all his life distrusted the statements of others respecting\nforeign countries, each person's tastes being according to the notions of\nhis native place; and that he had consequently set very little on what he\nwas told beforehand.\n\"Upon his arrival at Botzen, Montaigne wrote to Francois Hottmann, to say\nthat he had been so pleased with his visit to Germany that he quitted it\nwith great regret, although it was to go into Italy.  He then passed\nthrough Brunsol, Trent, where he put up at the Rose; thence going to\nRovera; and here he first lamented the scarcity of crawfish, but made up\nfor the loss by partaking of truffles cooked in oil and vinegar; oranges,\ncitrons, and olives, in all of which he delighted.\"\nAfter passing a restless night, when he bethought himself in the morning\nthat there was some new town or district to be seen, he rose, we are\ntold, with alacrity and pleasure.\nHis secretary, to whom he dictated his Journal, assures us that he never\nsaw him take so much interest in surrounding scenes and persons, and\nbelieves that the complete change helped to mitigate his sufferings in\nconcentrating his attention on other points.  When there was a complaint\nmade that he had led his party out of the beaten route, and then returned\nvery near the spot from which they started, his answer was that he had no\nsettled course, and that he merely proposed to himself to pay visits to\nplaces which he had not seen, and so long as they could not convict him\nof traversing the same path twice, or revisiting a point already seen, he\ncould perceive no harm in his plan.  As to Rome, he cared less to go\nthere, inasmuch as everybody went there; and he said that he never had a\nlacquey who could not tell him all about Florence or Ferrara.  He also\nwould say that he seemed to himself like those who are reading some\npleasant story or some fine book, of which they fear to come to the end:\nhe felt so much pleasure in travelling that he dreaded the moment of\narrival at the place where they were to stop for the night.\nWe see that Montaigne travelled, just as he wrote, completely at his\nease, and without the least constraint, turning, just as he fancied, from\nthe common or ordinary roads taken by tourists.  The good inns, the soft\nbeds, the fine views, attracted his notice at every point, and in his\nobservations on men and things he confines himself chiefly to the\npractical side.  The consideration of his health was constantly before\nhim, and it was in consequence of this that, while at Venice, which\ndisappointed him, he took occasion to note, for the benefit of readers,\nthat he had an attack of colic, and that he evacuated two large stones\nafter supper.  On quitting Venice, he went in succession to Ferrara,\nRovigo, Padua, Bologna (where he had a stomach-ache), Florence, &c.; and\neverywhere, before alighting, he made it a rule to send some of his\nservants to ascertain where the best accommodation was to be had.  He\npronounced the Florentine women the finest in the world, but had not an\nequally good opinion of the food, which was less plentiful than in\nGermany, and not so well served.  He lets us understand that in Italy\nthey send up dishes without dressing, but in Germany they were much\nbetter seasoned, and served with a variety of sauces and gravies.  He\nremarked further, that the glasses were singularly small and the wines\ninsipid.\nAfter dining with the Grand-Duke of Florence, Montaigne passed rapidly\nover the intermediate country, which had no fascination for him, and\narrived at Rome on the last day of November, entering by the Porta del\nPopolo, and putting up at Bear.  But he afterwards hired, at twenty\ncrowns a month, fine furnished rooms in the house of a Spaniard, who\nincluded in these terms the use of the kitchen fire.  What most annoyed\nhim in the Eternal City was the number of Frenchmen he met, who all\nsaluted him in his native tongue; but otherwise he was very comfortable,\nand his stay extended to five months.  A mind like his, full of grand\nclassical reflections, could not fail to be profoundly impressed in the\npresence of the ruins at Rome, and he has enshrined in a magnificent\npassage of the Journal the feelings of the moment: \"He said,\" writes his\nsecretary, \"that at Rome one saw nothing but the sky under which she had\nbeen built, and the outline of her site: that the knowledge we had of her\nwas abstract, contemplative, not palpable to the actual senses: that\nthose who said they beheld at least the ruins of Rome, went too far, for\nthe ruins of so gigantic a structure must have commanded greater\nreverence-it was nothing but her sepulchre.  The world, jealous of her,\nprolonged empire, had in the first place broken to pieces that admirable\nbody, and then, when they perceived that the remains attracted worship\nand awe, had buried the very wreck itself.--[Compare a passage in one\nof Horace Walpole's letters to Richard West, 22 March 1740 (Cunningham's\nedit.  i.  41), where Walpole, speaking of Rome, describes her very ruins\nas ruined.]--As to those small fragments which were still to be seen on\nthe surface, notwithstanding the assaults of time and all other attacks,\nagain and again repeated, they had been favoured by fortune to be some\nslight evidence of that infinite grandeur which nothing could entirely\nextingish.  But it was likely that these disfigured remains were the\nleast entitled to attention, and that the enemies of that immortal\nrenown, in their fury, had addressed themselves in the first instance to\nthe destruction of what was most beautiful and worthiest of preservation;\nand that the buildings of this bastard Rome, raised upon the ancient\nproductions, although they might excite the admiration of the present\nage, reminded him of the crows' and sparrows' nests built in the walls\nand arches of the old churches, destroyed by the Huguenots.  Again, he\nwas apprehensive, seeing the space which this grave occupied, that the\nwhole might not have been recovered, and that the burial itself had been\nburied.  And, moreover, to see a wretched heap of rubbish, as pieces of\ntile and pottery, grow (as it had ages since) to a height equal to that\nof Mount Gurson,--[In Perigord.]--and thrice the width of it, appeared to\nshow a conspiracy of destiny against the glory and pre-eminence of that\ncity, affording at the same time a novel and extraordinary proof of its\ndeparted greatness.  He (Montaigne) observed that it was difficult to\nbelieve considering the limited area taken up by any of her seven hills\nand particularly the two most favoured ones, the Capitoline and the\nPalatine, that so many buildings stood on the site.  Judging only from\nwhat is left of the Temple of Concord, along the 'Forum Romanum', of\nwhich the fall seems quite recent, like that of some huge mountain split\ninto horrible crags, it does not look as if more than two such edifices\ncould have found room on the Capitoline, on which there were at one\nperiod from five-and-twenty to thirty temples, besides private dwellings.\nBut, in point of fact, there is scarcely any probability of the views\nwhich we take of the city being correct, its plan and form having changed\ninfinitely; for instance, the 'Velabrum', which on account of its\ndepressed level, received the sewage of the city, and had a lake, has\nbeen raised by artificial accumulation to a height with the other hills,\nand Mount Savello has, in truth, grown simply out of the ruins of the\ntheatre of Marcellus.  He believed that an ancient Roman would not\nrecognise the place again.  It often happened that in digging down into\nearth the workmen came upon the crown of some lofty column, which, though\nthus buried, was still standing upright.  The people there have no\nrecourse to other foundations than the vaults and arches of the old\nhouses, upon which, as on slabs of rock, they raise their modern palaces.\nIt is easy to see that several of the ancient streets are thirty feet\nbelow those at present in use.\"\nSceptical as Montaigne shows himself in his books, yet during his sojourn\nat Rome he manifested a great regard for religion.  He solicited the\nhonour of being admitted to kiss the feet of the Holy Father, Gregory\nXIII.; and the Pontiff exhorted him always to continue in the devotion\nwhich he had hitherto exhibited to the Church and the service of the Most\nChristian King.\n\"After this, one sees,\" says the editor of the Journal, \"Montaigne\nemploying all his time in making excursions bout the neighbourhood on\nhorseback or on foot, in visits, in observations of every kind.  The\nchurches, the stations, the processions even, the sermons; then the\npalaces, the vineyards, the gardens, the public amusements, as the\nCarnival, &c.--nothing was overlooked.  He saw a Jewish child\ncircumcised, and wrote down a most minute account of the operation.  He\nmet at San Sisto a Muscovite ambassador, the second who had come to Rome\nsince the pontificate of Paul III.  This minister had despatches from his\ncourt for Venice, addressed to the 'Grand Governor of the Signory'.  The\ncourt of Muscovy had at that time such limited relations with the other\npowers of Europe, and it was so imperfect in its information, that it\nthought Venice to be a dependency of the Holy See.\"\nOf all the particulars with which he has furnished us during his stay at\nRome, the following passage in reference to the Essays is not the least\nsingular: \"The Master of the Sacred Palace returned him his Essays,\ncastigated in accordance with the views of the learned monks.  'He had\nonly been able to form a judgment of them,' said he, 'through a certain\nFrench monk, not understanding French himself'\"--we leave Montaigne\nhimself to tell the story--\"and he received so complacently my excuses\nand explanations on each of the passages which had been animadverted upon\nby the French monk, that he concluded by leaving me at liberty to revise\nthe text agreeably to the dictates of my own conscience.  I begged him,\non the contrary, to abide by the opinion of the person who had criticised\nme, confessing, among other matters, as, for example, in my use of the\nword fortune, in quoting historical poets, in my apology for Julian, in\nmy animadversion on the theory that he who prayed ought to be exempt from\nvicious inclinations for the time being; item, in my estimate of cruelty,\nas something beyond simple death; item, in my view that a child ought to\nbe brought up to do everything, and so on; that these were my opinions,\nwhich I did not think wrong; as to other things, I said that the\ncorrector understood not my meaning.  The Master, who is a clever man,\nmade many excuses for me, and gave me to suppose that he did not concur\nin the suggested improvements; and pleaded very ingeniously for me in my\npresence against another (also an Italian) who opposed my sentiments.\"\nSuch is what passed between Montaigne and these two personages at that\ntime; but when the Essayist was leaving, and went to bid them farewell,\nthey used very different language to him.  \"They prayed me,\" says he,\n\"to pay no attention to the censure passed on my book, in which other\nFrench persons had apprised them that there were many foolish things;\nadding, that they honoured my affectionate intention towards the Church,\nand my capacity; and had so high an opinion of my candour and\nconscientiousness that they should leave it to me to make such\nalterations as were proper in the book, when I reprinted it; among other\nthings, the word fortune.  To excuse themselves for what they had said\nagainst my book, they instanced works of our time by cardinals and other\ndivines of excellent repute which had been blamed for similar faults,\nwhich in no way affected reputation of the author, or of the publication\nas a whole; they requested me to lend the Church the support of my\neloquence (this was their fair speech), and to make longer stay in the\nplace, where I should be free from all further intrusion on their part.\nIt seemed to me that we parted very good friends.\"\nBefore quitting Rome, Montaigne received his diploma of citizenship, by\nwhich he was greatly flattered; and after a visit to Tivoli he set out\nfor Loretto, stopping at Ancona, Fano, and Urbino.  He arrived at the\nbeginning of May 1581, at Bagno della Villa, where he established\nhimself, order to try the waters.  There, we find in the Journal, of his\nown accord the Essayist lived in the strictest conformity with the\nregime, and henceforth we only hear of diet, the effect which the waters\nhad by degrees upon system, of the manner in which he took them; in a\nword, he does not omit an item of the circumstances connected with his\ndaily routine, his habit of body, his baths, and the rest.  It was no\nlonger the journal of a traveller which he kept, but the diary of an\ninvalid,--[\"I am reading Montaigne's Travels, which have lately been\nfound; there is little in them but the baths and medicines he took, and\nwhat he had everywhere for dinner.\"--H.  Walpole to Sir Horace Mann, June\n8, 1774.]--attentive to the minutest details of the cure which he was\nendeavouring to accomplish: a sort of memorandum book, in which he was\nnoting down everything that he felt and did, for the benefit of his\nmedical man at home, who would have the care of his health on his return,\nand the attendance on his subsequent infirmities.  Montaigne gives it as\nhis reason and justification for enlarging to this extent here, that he\nhad omitted, to his regret, to do so in his visits to other baths, which\nmight have saved him the trouble of writing at such great length now; but\nit is perhaps a better reason in our eyes, that what he wrote he wrote\nfor his own use.\nWe find in these accounts, however, many touches which are valuable as\nillustrating the manners of the place.  The greater part of the entries\nin the Journal, giving the account of these waters, and of the travels,\ndown to Montaigne's arrival at the first French town on his homeward\nroute, are in Italian, because he wished to exercise himself in that\nlanguage.\nThe minute and constant watchfulness of Montaigne over his health and\nover himself might lead one to suspect that excessive fear of death which\ndegenerates into cowardice.  But was it not rather the fear of the\noperation for the stone, at that time really formidable?  Or perhaps he\nwas of the same way of thinking with the Greek poet, of whom Cicero\nreports this saying: \"I do not desire to die; but the thought of being\ndead is indifferent to me.\"  Let us hear, however, what he says himself\non this point very frankly: \"It would be too weak and unmanly on my part\nif, certain as I am of always finding myself in the position of having to\nsuccumb in that way,--[To the stone or gravel.]--and death coming nearer\nand nearer to me, I did not make some effort, before the time came, to\nbear the trial with fortitude.  For reason prescribes that we should\njoyfully accept what it may please God to send us.  Therefore the only\nremedy, the only rule, and the sole doctrine for avoiding the evils by\nwhich mankind is surrounded, whatever they are, is to resolve to bear\nthem so far as our nature permits, or to put an end to them courageously\nand promptly.\"\nHe was still at the waters of La Villa, when, on the 7th September 1581,\nhe learned by letter that he had been elected Mayor of Bordeaux on the\n1st August preceding.  This intelligence made him hasten his departure;\nand from Lucca he proceeded to Rome.  He again made some stay in that\ncity, and he there received the letter of the jurats of Bordeaux,\nnotifying to him officially his election to the Mayoralty, and inviting\nhim to return as speedily as possible.  He left for France, accompanied\nby young D'Estissac and several other gentlemen, who escorted him a\nconsiderable distance; but none went back to France with him, not even\nhis travelling companion.  He passed by Padua, Milan, Mont Cenis, and\nChambery; thence he went on to Lyons, and lost no time in repairing to\nhis chateau, after an absence of seventeen months and eight days.\nWe have just seen that, during his absence in Italy, the author of the\nEssays was elected mayor of Bordeaux.  \"The gentlemen of Bordeaux,\" says\nhe, \"elected me Mayor of their town while I was at a distance from\nFrance, and far from the thought of such a thing.  I excused myself; but\nthey gave to understand that I was wrong in so doing, it being also the\ncommand of the king that I should stand.\"  This the letter which Henry\nIII. wrote to him on the occasion:\nMONSIEUR, DE MONTAIGNE,--Inasmuch as I hold in great esteem your fidelity\nand zealous devotion to my service, it has been a pleasure to me to learn\nthat you have been chosen mayor of my town of Bordeaux.  I have had the\nagreeable duty of confirming the selection, and I did so the more\nwillingly, seeing that it was made during your distant absence; wherefore\nit is my desire, and I require and command you expressly that you proceed\nwithout delay to enter on the duties to which you have received so\nlegitimate a call.  And so you will act in a manner very agreeable to me,\nwhile the contrary will displease me greatly.  Praying God, M. de\nMontaigne, to have you in his holy keeping.\n\"Written at Paris, the 25th day of November 1581.\n\"HENRI.\n\"A Monsieur de MONTAIGNE,\nKnight of my Order, Gentleman in Ordinary of my\nChamber, being at present in Rome.\"\nMontaigne, in his new employment, the most important in the province,\nobeyed the axiom, that a man may not refuse a duty, though it absorb his\ntime and attention, and even involve the sacrifice of his blood.  Placed\nbetween two extreme parties, ever on the point of getting to blows, he\nshowed himself in practice what he is in his book, the friend of a middle\nand temperate policy.  Tolerant by character and on principle, he\nbelonged, like all the great minds of the sixteenth century, to that\npolitical sect which sought to improve, without destroying, institutions;\nand we may say of him, what he himself said of La Boetie, \"that he had\nthat maxim indelibly impressed on his mind, to obey and submit himself\nreligiously to the laws under which he was born.  Affectionately attached\nto the repose of his country, an enemy to changes and innovations, he\nwould have preferred to employ what means he had towards their\ndiscouragement and suppression, than in promoting their success.\"  Such\nwas the platform of his administration.\nHe applied himself, in an especial manner, to the maintenance of peace\nbetween the two religious factions which at that time divided the town of\nBordeaux; and at the end of his two first years of office, his grateful\nfellow-citizens conferred on him (in 1583) the mayoralty for two years\nmore, a distinction which had been enjoyed, as he tells us, only twice\nbefore.  On the expiration of his official career, after four years'\nduration, he could say fairly enough of himself that he left behind him\nneither hatred nor cause of offence.\nIn the midst of the cares of government, Montaigne found time to revise\nand enlarge his Essays, which, since their appearance in 1580, were\ncontinually receiving augmentation in the form of additional chapters or\npapers.  Two more editions were printed in 1582 and 1587; and during this\ntime the author, while making alterations in the original text, had\ncomposed part of the Third Book.  He went to Paris to make arrangements\nfor the publication of his enlarged labours, and a fourth impression in\n1588 was the result.  He remained in the capital some time on this\noccasion, and it was now that he met for the first time Mademoiselle de\nGournay.  Gifted with an active and inquiring spirit, and, above all,\npossessing a sound and healthy tone of mind, Mademoiselle de Gournay had\nbeen carried from her childhood with that tide which set in with\nsixteenth century towards controversy, learning, and knowledge.  She\nlearnt Latin without a master; and when, the age of eighteen, she\naccidentally became possessor of a copy of the Essays, she was\ntransported with delight and admiration.\nShe quitted the chateau of Gournay, to come and see him.  We cannot do\nbetter, in connection with this journey of sympathy, than to repeat the\nwords of Pasquier: \"That young lady, allied to several great and noble\nfamilies of Paris, proposed to herself no other marriage than with her\nhonour, enriched with the knowledge gained from good books, and, beyond\nall others, from the essays of M. de Montaigne, who making in the year\n1588 a lengthened stay in the town of Paris, she went there for the\npurpose of forming his personal acquaintance; and her mother, Madame de\nGournay, and herself took him back with them to their chateau, where, at\ntwo or three different times, he spent three months altogether, most\nwelcome of visitors.\"  It was from this moment that Mademoiselle de\nGournay dated her adoption as Montaigne's daughter, a circumstance which\nhas tended to confer immortality upon her in a far greater measure than\nher own literary productions.\nMontaigne, on leaving Paris, stayed a short time at Blois, to attend the\nmeeting of the States-General.  We do not know what part he took in that\nassembly: but it is known that he was commissioned, about this period, to\nnegotiate between Henry of Navarre (afterwards Henry IV.) and the Duke of\nGuise.  His political life is almost a blank; but De Thou assures us that\nMontaigne enjoyed the confidence of the principal persons of his time.\nDe Thou, who calls him a frank man without constraint, tells us that,\nwalking with him and Pasquier in the court at the Castle of Blois, he\nheard him pronounce some very remarkable opinions on contemporary events,\nand he adds that Montaigne had foreseen that the troubles in France could\nnot end without witnessing the death of either the King of Navarre or of\nthe Duke of Guise.  He had made himself so completely master of the views\nof these two princes, that he told De Thou that the King of Navarre would\nhave been prepared to embrace Catholicism, if he had not been afraid of\nbeing abandoned by his party, and that the Duke of Guise, on his part,\nhad no particular repugnance to the Confession of Augsburg, for which the\nCardinal of Lorraine, his uncle, had inspired him with a liking, if it\nhad not been for the peril involved in quitting the Romish communion.  It\nwould have been easy for Montaigne to play, as we call it, a great part\nin politics, and create for himself a lofty position but his motto was,\n'Otio et Libertati'; and he returned quietly home to compose a chapter\nfor his next edition on inconveniences of Greatness.\nThe author of the Essays was now fifty-five.  The malady which tormented\nhim grew only worse and worse with years; and yet he occupied himself\ncontinually with reading, meditating, and composition.  He employed the\nyears 1589, 1590, and 1591 in making fresh additions to his book; and\neven in the approaches of old age he might fairly anticipate many happy\nhours, when he was attacked by quinsy, depriving him of the power\nutterance.  Pasquier, who has left us some details  his last hours,\nnarrates that he remained three days in full possession of his faculties,\nbut unable to speak, so that, in order to make known his desires, he was\nobliged to resort to writing; and as he felt his end drawing near, he\nbegged his wife to summon certain of the gentlemen who lived in the\nneighbourhood to bid them a last farewell.  When they had arrived, he\ncaused mass to be celebrated in apartment; and just as the priest was\nelevating the host, Montaigne fell forward with his arms extended in\nfront of him, on the bed, and so expired.  He was in his sixtieth year.\nIt was the 13th September 1592.\nMontaigne was buried near his own house; but a few years after his\ndecease, his remains were removed to the church of a Commandery of St.\nAntoine at Bordeaux, where they still continue.  His monument was\nrestored in 1803 by a descendant.  It was seen about 1858 by an English\ntraveller (Mr. St.  John).'--[\"Montaigne the Essayist,\" by Bayle St.\nJohn, 1858, 2 vols.  8vo, is one of most delightful books of the kind.]--\nand was then in good preservation.\nIn 1595 Mademoiselle de Gournay published a new edition of Montaigne's\nEssays, and the first with the latest emendations of the author, from a\ncopy presented to her by his widow, and which has not been recovered,\nalthough it is known to have been in existence some years after the date\nof the impression, made on its authority.\nColdly as Montaigne's literary productions appear to have been received\nby the generation immediately succeeding his own age, his genius grew\ninto just appreciation in the seventeenth century, when such great\nspirits arose as La Bruyere, Moliere, La Fontaine, Madame de Sevigne.\n\"O,\" exclaimed the Chatelaine des Rochers, \"what capital company he is,\nthe dear man!  he is my old friend; and just for the reason that he is\nso, he always seems new.  My God!  how full is that book of sense!\"\nBalzac said that he had carried human reason as far and as high as it\ncould go, both in politics and in morals.  On the other hand, Malebranche\nand the writers of Port Royal were against him; some reprehended the\nlicentiousness of his writings; others their impiety, materialism,\nepicureanism.  Even Pascal, who had carefully read the Essays, and gained\nno small profit by them, did not spare his reproaches.  But Montaigne has\noutlived detraction.  As time has gone on, his admirers and borrowers\nhave increased in number, and his Jansenism, which recommended him to the\neighteenth century, may not be his least recommendation in the\nnineteenth.  Here we have certainly, on the whole, a first-class man, and\none proof of his masterly genius seems to be, that his merits and his\nbeauties are sufficient to induce us to leave out of consideration\nblemishes and faults which would have been fatal to an inferior writer.\nTHE LETTERS OF MONTAIGNE.\nI.\nTo Monsieur de MONTAIGNE\n[This account of the death of La Boetie begins imperfectly.  It first\nappeared in a little volume of Miscellanies in 1571.  See Hazlitt, ubi\nsup.  p.  630.]--As to his last words, doubtless, if any man can\ngive good account of them, it is I, both because, during the whole of his\nsickness he conversed as fully with me as with any one, and also because,\nin consequence of the singular and brotherly friendship which we had\nentertained for each other, I was perfectly acquainted with the\nintentions, opinions, and wishes which he had formed in the course of his\nlife, as much so, certainly, as one man can possibly be with those of\nanother man; and because I knew them to be elevated, virtuous, full of\nsteady resolution, and (after all said) admirable.  I well foresaw that,\nif his illness permitted him to express himself, he would allow nothing\nto fall from him, in such an extremity, that was not replete with good\nexample.  I consequently took every care in my power to treasure what was\nsaid.  True it is, Monseigneur, as my memory is not only in itself very\nshort, but in this case affected by the trouble which I have undergone,\nthrough so heavy and important a loss, that I have forgotten a number of\nthings which I should wish to have had known; but those which I recollect\nshall be related to you as exactly as lies in my power.  For to represent\nin full measure his noble career suddenly arrested, to paint to you his\nindomitable courage, in a body worn out and prostrated by pain and the\nassaults of death, I confess, would demand a far better ability than\nmine: because, although, when in former years he discoursed on serious\nand important matters, he handled them in such a manner that it was\ndifficult to reproduce exactly what he said, yet his ideas and his words\nat the last seemed to rival each other in serving him.  For I am sure\nthat I never knew him give birth to such fine conceptions, or display so\nmuch eloquence, as in the time of his sickness.  If, Monseigneur, you\nblame me for introducing his more ordinary observations, please to know\nthat I do so advisedly; for since they proceeded from him at a season of\nsuch great trouble, they indicate the perfect tranquillity of his mind\nand thoughts to the last.\nOn Monday, the 9th day of August 1563, on my return from the Court, I\nsent an invitation to him to come and dine with me.  He returned word\nthat he was obliged, but, being indisposed, he would thank me to do him\nthe pleasure of spending an hour with him before he started for Medoc.\nShortly after my dinner I went to him.  He had laid himself down on the\nbed with his clothes on, and he was already, I perceived, much changed.\nHe complained of diarrhoea, accompanied by the gripes, and said that he\nhad it about him ever since he played with M. d'Escars with nothing but\nhis doublet on, and that with him a cold often brought on such attacks.\nI advised him to go as he had proposed, but to stay for the night at\nGermignac, which is only about two leagues from the town.  I gave him\nthis advice, because some houses, near to that where he was ping, were\nvisited by the plague, about which he was nervous since his return from\nPerigord and the Agenois, here it had been raging; and, besides, horse\nexercise was, from my own experience, beneficial under similar\ncircumstances.  He set out, accordingly, with his wife and M.\nBouillhonnas, his uncle.\nEarly on the following morning, however, I had intelligence from Madame\nde la Boetie, that in the night he had fresh and violent attack of\ndysentery.  She had called in physician and apothecary, and prayed me to\nlose no time coming, which (after dinner) I did.  He was delighted to see\nme; and when I was going away, under promise to turn the following day,\nhe begged me more importunately and affectionately than he was wont to\ndo, to give him as such of my company as possible.  I was a little\naffected; yet was about to leave, when Madame de la Boetie, as if she\nforesaw something about to happen, implored me with tears to stay the\nnight.  When I consented, he seemed to grow more cheerful.  I returned\nhome the next day, and on the Thursday I paid him another visit.  He had\nbecome worse; and his loss of blood from the dysentery, which reduced his\nstrength very much, was largely on the increase.  I quitted his side on\nFriday, but on Saturday I went to him, and found him very weak.  He then\ngave me to understand that his complaint was infectious, and, moreover,\ndisagreeable and depressing; and that he, knowing thoroughly my\nconstitution, desired that I should content myself with coming to see him\nnow and then.  On the contrary, after that I never left his side.\nIt was only on the Sunday that he began to converse with me on any\nsubject beyond the immediate one of his illness, and what the ancient\ndoctors thought of it: we had not touched on public affairs, for I found\nat the very outset that he had a dislike to them.\nBut, on the Sunday, he had a fainting fit; and when he came to himself,\nhe told me that everything seemed to him confused, as if in a mist and in\ndisorder, and that, nevertheless, this visitation was not unpleasing to\nhim.  \"Death,\" I replied, \"has no worse sensation, my brother.\"  \"None so\nbad,\" was his answer.  He had had no regular sleep since the beginning of\nhis illness; and as he became worse and worse, he began to turn his\nattention to questions which men commonly occupy themselves with in the\nlast extremity, despairing now of getting better, and intimating as much\nto me.  On that day, as he appeared in tolerably good spirits, I took\noccasion to say to him that, in consideration of the singular love I bore\nhim, it would become me to take care that his affairs, which he had\nconducted with such rare prudence in his life, should not be neglected at\npresent; and that I should regret it if, from want of proper counsel, he\nshould leave anything unsettled, not only on account of the loss to his\nfamily, but also to his good name.\nHe thanked me for my kindness; and after a little reflection, as if he\nwas resolving certain doubts in his own mind, he desired me to summon his\nuncle and his wife by themselves, in order that he might acquaint them\nwith his testamentary dispositions.  I told him that this would shock\nthem.  \"No, no,\" he answered, \"I will cheer them by making out my case to\nbe better than it is.\"  And then he inquired, whether we were not all\nmuch taken by surprise at his having fainted?  I replied, that it was of\nno importance, being incidental to the complaint from which he suffered.\n\"True, my brother,\" said he; \"it would be unimportant, even though it\nshould lead to what you most dread.\"  \"For you,\" I rejoined, \"it might be\na happy thing; but I should be the loser, who would thereby be deprived\nof so great, so wise, and so steadfast a friend, a friend whose place I\nshould never see supplied.\"  \"It is very likely you may not,\" was his\nanswer; \"and be sure that one thing which makes me somewhat anxious to\nrecover, and to delay my journey to that place, whither I am already\nhalf-way gone, is the thought of the loss both you and that poor man and\nwoman there (referring to his uncle and wife) must sustain; for I love\nthem with my whole heart, and I feel certain that they will find it very\nhard to lose me.  I should also regret it on account of such as have, in\nmy lifetime, valued me, and whose conversation I should like to have\nenjoyed a little longer; and I beseech you, my brother, if I leave the\nworld, to carry to them for me an assurance of the esteem I entertained\nfor them to the last moment of my existence.  My birth was, moreover,\nscarcely to so little purpose but that, had I lived, I might have done\nsome service to the public; but, however this may be, I am prepared to\nsubmit to the will of God, when it shall please Him to call me, being\nconfident of enjoying the tranquillity which you have foretold for me.\nAs for you, my friend, I feel sure that you are so wise, that you will\ncontrol your emotions, and submit to His divine ordinance regarding me;\nand I beg of you to see that that good man and woman do not mourn for my\ndeparture unnecessarily.\"\nHe proceeded to inquire how they behaved at present.  \"Very well,\" said\nI, \"considering the circumstances.\"  \"Ah!\"  he replied, \"that is, so long\nas they do not abandon all hope of me; but when that shall be the case,\nyou will have a hard task to support them.\"  It was owing to his strong\nregard for his wife and uncle that he studiously disguised from them his\nown conviction as to the certainty of his end, and he prayed me to do the\nsame.  When they were near him he assumed an appearance of gaiety, and\nflattered them with hopes.  I then went to call them.  They came, wearing\nas composed an air as possible; and when we four were together, he\naddressed us, with an untroubled countenance, as follows: \"Uncle and\nwife, rest assured that no new attack of my disease, or fresh doubt that\nI have as to my recovery, has led me to take this step of communicating\nto you my intentions, for, thank God, I feel very well and hopeful; but\ntaught by observation and experience the instability of all human things,\nand even of the life to which we are so much attached, and which is,\nnevertheless, a mere bubble; and knowing, moreover, that my state of\nhealth brings me more within the danger of death, I have thought proper\nto settle my worldly affairs, having the benefit of your advice.\"  Then\naddressing himself more particularly to his uncle, \"Good uncle,\" said he,\n\"if I were to rehearse all the obligations under which I lie to you, I am\nsure that I never should make an end.  Let me only say that, wherever I\nhave been, and with whomsoever I have conversed, I have represented you\nas doing for me all that a father could do for a son; both in the care\nwith which you tended my education, and in the zeal with which you pushed\nme forward into public life, so that my whole existence is a testimony of\nyour good offices towards me.  In short, I am indebted for all that I\nhave to you, who have been to me as a parent; and therefore I have no\nright to part with anything, unless it be with your approval.\"\nThere was a general silence hereupon, and his uncle was prevented from\nreplying by tears and sobs.  At last he said that whatever he thought for\nthe best would be agreeable to him; and as he intended to make him his\nheir, he was at liberty to dispose of what would be his.\nThen he turned to his wife.  \"My image,\" said he (for so he often called\nher, there being some sort of relationship between them), \"since I have\nbeen united to you by marriage, which is one of the most weighty and\nsacred ties imposed on us by God, for the purpose of maintaining human\nsociety, I have continued to love, cherish, and value you; and I know\nthat you have returned my affection, for which I have no sufficient\nacknowledgment.  I beg you to accept such portion of my estate as I\nbequeath to you, and be satisfied with it, though it is very inadequate\nto your desert.\"\nAfterwards he turned to me.  \"My brother,\" he began, \"for whom I have so\nentire a love, and whom I selected out of so large a number, thinking to\nrevive with you that virtuous and sincere friendship which, owing to the\ndegeneracy of the age, has grown to be almost unknown to us, and now\nexists only in certain vestiges of antiquity, I beg of you, as a mark of\nmy affection to you, to accept my library: a slender offering, but given\nwith a cordial will, and suitable to you, seeing that you are fond of\nlearning.  It will be a memorial of your old companion.\"\nThen he addressed all three of us.  He blessed God that in his extremity\nhe had the happiness to be surrounded by those whom he held dearest in\nthe world, and he looked upon it as a fine spectacle, where four persons\nwere together, so unanimous in their feelings, and loving each other for\neach other's sake.  He commended us one to the other; and proceeded thus:\n\"My worldly matters being arranged, I must now think of the welfare of my\nsoul.  I am a Christian; I am a Catholic.  I have lived one, and I shall\ndie one.  Send for a priest; for I wish to conform to this last Christian\nobligation.\"  He now concluded his discourse, which he had conducted with\nsuch a firm face and with so distinct an utterance, that whereas, when I\nfirst entered his room, he was feeble, inarticulate in his speech, his\npulse low and feverish, and his features pallid, now, by a sort of\nmiracle, he appeared to have rallied, and his pulse was so strong that\nfor the sake of comparison, I asked him to feel mine.\nI felt my heart so oppressed at this moment, that I had not the power to\nmake him any answer; but in the course of two or three hours, solicitous\nto keep up his courage, and, likewise, out of the tenderness which I had\nhad all my life for his honour and fame, wishing a larger number of\nwitnesses to his admirable fortitude, I said to him, how much I was\nashamed to think that I lacked courage to listen to what he, so great a\nsufferer, had the courage to deliver; that down to the present time I had\nscarcely conceived that God granted us such command over human\ninfirmities, and had found a difficulty in crediting the examples I had\nread in histories; but that with such evidence of the thing before my\neyes, I gave praise to God that it had shown itself in one so excessively\ndear to me, and who loved me so entirely, and that his example would help\nme to act in a similar manner when my turn came.  Interrupting me, he\nbegged that it might happen so, and that the conversation which had\npassed between us might not be mere words, but might be impressed deeply\non our minds, to be put in exercise at the first occasion; and that this\nwas the real object and aim of all philosophy.\nHe then took my hand, and continued: \"Brother, friend, there are many\nacts of my life, I think, which have cost me as much difficulty as this\none is likely to do; and, after all, I have been long prepared for it,\nand have my lesson by heart.  Have I not lived long enough?  I am just\nupon thirty-three.  By the grace of God, my days so far have known\nnothing but health and happiness; but in the ordinary course of our\nunstable human affairs, this could not have lasted much longer; it would\nhave become time for me to enter on graver avocations, and I should thus\nhave involved myself in numberless vexations, and, among them, the\ntroubles of old age, from which I shall now be exempt.  Moreover, it is\nprobable that hitherto my life has been spent more simply, and with less\nof evil, than if God had spared me, and I had survived to feel the\nthirst for riches and worldly prosperity.  I am sure, for my part, that\nI now go to God and the place of the blessed.\"  He seemed to detect in\nmy expression some inquietude at his words; and he exclaimed, \"What, my\nbrother, would you make me entertain apprehensions?  Had I any, whom\nwould it become so much as yourself to remove them?\"\nThe notary, who had been summoned to draw up his will, came in the\nevening, and when he had the documents prepared, I inquired of La Boetie\nif he would sign them.  \"Sign them,\" cried he; \"I will do so with my own\nhand; but I could desire more time, for I feel exceedingly timid and\nweak, and in a manner exhausted.\"  But when I was going to change the\nconversation, he suddenly rallied, said he had but a short time to live,\nand asked if the notary wrote rapidly, for he should dictate without\nmaking any pause.  The notary was called, and he dictated his will there\nand then with such speed that the man could scarcely keep up with him;\nand when he had done, he asked me to read it out, saying to me, \"What a\ngood thing it is to look after what are called our riches.\"  'Sunt haec,\nquoe hominibus vocantur bona'.  As soon as the will was signed, the\nchamber being full, he asked me if it would hurt him to talk.  I\nanswered, that it would not, if he did not speak too loud.  He then\nsummoned Mademoiselle de Saint Quentin, his niece, to him, and addressed\nher thus: \"Dear niece, since my earliest acquaintance with thee, I have\nobserved the marks of, great natural goodness in thee; but the services\nwhich thou rendered to me, with so much affectionate diligence, in my\npresent and last necessity, inspire me with high hopes of thee; and I am\nunder great obligations to thee, and give thee most affectionate thanks.\nLet me relieve my conscience by counselling thee to be, in the first\nplace, devout, to God: for this doubtless is our first duty, failing\nwhich all others can be of little advantage or grace, but which, duly\nobserved, carries with it necessarily all other virtues.  After God, thou\nshouldest love thy father and mother--thy mother, my sister, whom I\nregard as one of the best and most intelligent of women, and by whom I\nbeg of thee to let thy own life be regulated.  Allow not thyself to be\nled away by pleasures; shun, like the plague, the foolish familiarities\nthou seest between some men and women; harmless enough at first, but\nwhich by insidious degrees corrupt the heart, and thence lead it to\nnegligence, and then into the vile slough of vice.  Credit me, the\ngreatest safeguard to female chastity is sobriety of demeanour.  I\nbeseech and direct that thou often call to mind the friendship which was\nbetwixt us; but I do not wish thee to mourn for me too much--an\ninjunction which, so far as it is in my power, I lay on all my friends,\nsince it might seem that by doing so they felt a jealousy of that blessed\ncondition in which I am about to be placed by death.  I assure thee, my\ndear, that if I had the option now of continuing in life or of completing\nthe voyage on which I have set out, I should find it very hard to choose.\nAdieu, dear niece.\"\nMademoiselle d'Arsat, his stepdaughter, was next called.  He said to her:\n\"Daughter, you stand in no great need of advice from me, insomuch as you\nhave a mother, whom I have ever found most sagacious, and entirely in\nconformity with my own opinions and wishes, and whom I have never found\nfaulty; with such a preceptress, you cannot fail to be properly\ninstructed.  Do not account it singular that I, with no tie of blood to\nyou, am interested in you; for, being the child of one who is so closely\nallied to me, I am necessarily concerned in what concerns you; and\nconsequently the affairs of your brother, M. d'Arsat, have ever been\nwatched by me with as much care as my own; nor perhaps will it be to your\ndisadvantage that you were my step-daughter.  You enjoy sufficient store\nof wealth and beauty; you are a lady of good family; it only remains for\nyou to add to these possessions the cultivation of your mind, in which I\nexhort you not to fail.  I do not think necessary to warn you against\nvice, a thing so odious in women, for I would not even suppose that you\ncould harbour any inclination for it--nay, I believe that you hold the\nvery name in abhorrence.  Dear daughter, farewell.\"\nAll in the room were weeping and lamenting; but he held without\ninterruption the thread of his discourse, which was pretty long.  But\nwhen he had done, he directed us all to leave the room, except the women\nattendants, whom he styled his garrison.  But first, calling to him my\nbrother, M. de Beauregard, he said to him: \"M. de Beauregard, you have\nmy best thanks for all the care you have taken of me.  I have now a thing\nwhich I am very anxious indeed to mention to you, and with your\npermission I will do so.\"  As my brother gave him encouragement to\nproceed, he added: \"I assure you that I never knew any man who engaged in\nthe reformation of our Church with greater sincerity, earnestness, and\nsingle-heartedness than yourself.  I consider that you were led to it by\nobserving the vicious character of our prelates, which no doubt much\nrequires setting in order, and by imperfections which time has brought\ninto our Church.  It is not my desire at present  discourage you from\nthis course, for I would have no one act in opposition to his conscience;\nbut I wish, having regard to the good repute acquired by your family from\nits enduring concord--a family than which none can be dearer to me; a\nfamily, thank God!  no member of which has ever been guilty of dishonour\n--in regard, further, to the will of your good father to whom you owe so\nmuch, and of your, uncle, I wish you to avoid extreme means; avoid\nharshness and violence: be reconciled with your relatives; do not act\napart, but unite.  You perceive what disasters our quarrels have brought\nupon this kingdom, and I anticipate still worse mischiefs; and in your\ngoodness and wisdom, beware of involving your family in such broils; let\nit continue to enjoy its former reputation and happiness.  M. de\nBeauregard, take what I say in good part, and as a proof of the\nfriendship I feel for you.  I postponed till now any communication with\nyou on the subject, and perhaps the condition in which you see me address\nyou, may cause my advice and opinion to carry greater authority.\"  My\nbrother expressed his thanks to him cordially.\nOn the Monday morning he had become so ill that he quite despaired of\nhimself; and he said to me very pitifully: \"Brother, do not you feel pain\nfor all the pain I am suffering?  Do you not perceive now that the help\nyou give me has no other effect than that of lengthening my suffering?\"\nShortly afterwards he fainted, and we all thought him gone; but by the\napplication of vinegar and wine he rallied.  But he soon sank, and when\nhe heard us in lamentation, he murmured, \"O God!  who is it that teases\nme so?  Why did you break the agreeable repose I was enjoying?  I beg of\nyou to leave me.\"  And then, when he caught the sound of my voice, he\ncontinued: \"And art thou, my brother, likewise unwilling to see me at\npeace?  O, how thou robbest me of my repose!\"  After a while, he seemed\nto gain more strength, and called for wine, which he relished, and\ndeclared it to be the finest drink possible.  I, in order to change the\ncurrent of his thoughts, put in, \"Surely not; water is the best.\"  \"Ah,\nyes,\" he returned, \"doubtless so;--(Greek phrase)--.\"  He had now become,\nicy-cold at his extremities, even to his face; a deathly perspiration was\nupon him, and his pulse was scarcely perceptible.\nThis morning he confessed, but the priest had omitted to bring with him\nthe necessary apparatus for celebrating Mass.  On the Tuesday, however,\nM. de la Boetie summoned him to aid him, as he said, in discharging the\nlast office of a Christian.   After the conclusion of Mass, he took the\nsacrament; when the priest was about to depart, he said to him:\n\"Spiritual father, I implore you humbly, as well as those over whom you\nare set, to pray to the Almighty on my behalf; that, if it be decreed in\nheaven that I am now to end my life, He will take compassion on my soul,\nand pardon me my sins, which are manifold, it not being possible for so\nweak and poor a creature as I to obey completely the will of such a\nMaster; or, if He think fit to keep me longer here, that it may please\nHim to release my present extreme anguish, and to direct my footsteps in\nthe right path, that I may become a better man than I have been.\"  He\npaused to recover breath a little; priest was about to go away, he called\nhim back and proceeded: \"I desire to say, besides, in your hearing this:\nI declare that I was christened and I have lived, and that so I wish to\ndie, in the faith which Moses preached in Egypt; which afterwards the\nPatriarchs accepted and professed in Judaea; and which, in the course of\ntime, has been transmitted to France and to us.\"  He seemed desirous of\nadding something more, but he ended with a request to his uncle and me to\nsend up prayers for him; \"for those are,\" he said, \"the best duties that\nChristians can fulfil one for another.\"  In the course of talking, his\nshoulder was uncovered, and although a man-servant stood near him, he\nasked his uncle to re-adjust the clothes.  Then, turning his eyes towards\nme, he said, \"Ingenui est, cui multum debeas, ei plurimum velle debere.\"\nM. de Belot called in the afternoon to see him, and M. de la Boetie,\ntaking his hand, said to him: \"I was on the point of discharging my debt,\nbut my kind creditor has given me a little further time.\"  A little while\nafter, appearing to wake out of a sort of reverie, he uttered words which\nhe had employed once or twice before in the course of his sickness:\n\"Ah well, ah well, whenever the hour comes, I await it with pleasure and\nfortitude.\"  And then, as they were holding his mouth open by force to\ngive him a draught, he observed to M. de Belot: \"An vivere tanti est?\"\nAs the evening approached, he began perceptibly to sink; and while I\nsupped, he sent for me to come, being no more than the shadow of a man,\nor, as he put it himself, 'non homo, sed species hominis'; and he said to\nme with the utmost difficulty: \"My brother, my friend, please God I may\nrealise the imaginations I have just enjoyed.\"  Afterwards, having waited\nfor some time while he remained silent, and by painful efforts was\ndrawing long sighs (for his tongue at this point began to refuse its\nfunctions), I said, \"What are they?\"  \"Grand, grand!\"  he replied.  \"I\nhave never yet failed,\" returned I, \"to have the honour of hearing your\nconceptions and imaginations communicated to me; will you not now still\nlet me enjoy them?\"  \"I would indeed,\" he answered; \"but, my brother,\nI am not able to do so; they are admirable, infinite, and unspeakable.\"\nWe stopped short there, for he could not go on.  A little before, indeed,\nhe had shown a desire to speak to his wife, and had told her, with as gay\na countenance as he could contrive to assume, that he had a story to tell\nher.  And it seemed as if he was making an attempt to gain utterance;\nbut, his strength failing him, he begged a little wine to resuscitate it.\nIt was of no avail, for he fainted away suddenly, and was for some time\ninsensible.  Having become so near a neighbour to death, and hearing the\nsobs of Mademoiselle de la Boetie, he called her, and said to her thus:\n\"My own likeness, you grieve yourself beforehand; will you not have pity\non me?  take courage.  Assuredly, it costs me more than half the pain I\nendure, to see you suffer; and reasonably so, because the evils which we\nourselves feel we do not actually ourselves suffer, but it certain\nsentient faculties which God plants in us, that feel them: whereas what\nwe feel on account of others, we feel by consequence of a certain\nreasoning process which goes on within our minds.  But I am going away\"\n--That he said because his strength was failing him; and fearing that he\nhad frightened his wife, he resumed, observing: \"I am going to sleep.\nGood night, my wife; go thy way.\"  This was the last farewell he took of\nher.\nAfter she had left, \"My brother,\" said he to me, \"keep near me, if you\nplease;\" and then feeling the advance of death more pressing and more\nacute, or else the effect of some warm draught which they had made him\nswallow, his voice grew stronger and clearer, and he turned quite with\nviolence in his bed, so that all began again to entertain the hope which\nwe had lost only upon witnessing his extreme prostration.\nAt this stage he proceeded, among other things, to pray me again and\nagain, in a most affectionate manner, to give him a place; so that I was\napprehensive that his reason might be impaired, particularly when, on my\npointing out to him that he was doing himself harm, and that these were\nnot of the words of a rational man, he did not yield at first, but\nredoubled his outcry, saying, \"My brother, my brother!  dost thou then\nrefuse me a place?\"  insomuch that he constrained me to demonstrate to\nhim that, as he breathed and spoke, and had his physical being, therefore\nhe had his place.  \"Yes, yes,\" he responded, \"I have; but it is not that\nwhich I need; and, besides, when all is said, I have no longer any\nexistence.\"  \"God,\" I replied, \"will grant you a better one soon.\"\n\"Would it were now, my brother,\" was his answer.  \"It is now three days\nsince I have been eager to take my departure.\"\nBeing in this extremity, he frequently called me, merely to satisfy him\nthat I was at his side.  At length, he composed himself a little to rest,\nwhich strengthened our hopes; so much so, indeed, that I left the room,\nand went to rejoice thereupon with Mademoiselle de la Boetie.  But, an\nhour or so afterwards, he called me by name once or twice, and then with\na long sigh expired at three o'clock on Wednesday morning, the 18th\nAugust 1563, having lived thirty-two years, nine months, and seventeen\ndays.\nII.\nTo Monseigneur, Monseigneur de MONTAIGNE.\n[This letter is prefixed to Montaigne's translation of the \"Natural\nTheology\" of Raymond de Sebonde, printed at Paris in 1569.]\nIn pursuance of the instructions which you gave me last year in your\nhouse at Montaigne, Monseigneur, I have put into a French dress, with my\nown hand, Raymond de Sebonde, that great Spanish theologian and\nphilosopher; and I have divested him, so far as I could, of that rough\nbearing and barbaric appearance which you saw him wear at first; that, in\nmy opinion, he is now qualified to present himself in the best company.\nIt is perfectly possible that some fastidious persons will detect in the\nbook some trace of Gascon parentage; but it will be so much the more to\ntheir discredit, that they allowed the task to devolve on one who is\nquite a novice in these things.  It is only right, Monseigneur, that the\nwork should come before the world under your auspices, since whatever\nemendations and polish it may have received, are owing to you.  Still I\nsee well that, if you think proper to balance accounts with the author,\nyou will find yourself much his debtor; for against his excellent and\nreligious discourses, his lofty and, so to speak, divine conceptions, you\nwill find that you will have to set nothing but words and phraseology; a\nsort of merchandise so ordinary and commonplace, that whoever has the\nmost of it, peradventure is the worst off.\nMonseigneur, I pray God to grant you a very long and happy life.  From\nParis, this 18th of June 1568.  Your most humble and most obedient son,\nMICHEL DE MONTAIGNE\nIII.\nTo Monsieur, Monsieur de LANSAC,--[This letter appears to belong to\n1570.]--Knight of the King's Order, Privy Councillor, Sub-controller of\nhis Finance, and Captain of the Cent Gardes of his Household.\nMONSIEUR,--I send you the OEconomics of Xenophon, put into French by the\nlate M. de la Boetie,--[Printed at Paris, 8vo, 1571, and reissued, with\nthe addition of some notes, in 1572, with a fresh title-page.]--a present\nwhich appears to me to be appropriate, as well because it is the work of\na gentleman of mark,--[Meaning Xenophon.]--a man illustrious in war and\npeace, as because it has taken its second shape from a personage whom I\nknow to have been held by you in affectionate regard during his life.\nThis will be an inducement to you to continue to cherish towards his\nmemory, your good opinion and goodwill.  And to be bold with you,\nMonsieur, do not fear to increase these sentiments somewhat; for, as you\nhad knowledge of his high qualities only in his public capacity, it rests\nwith me to assure you how many endowments he possessed beyond your\npersonal experience of him.  He did me the honour, while he lived, and I\ncount it amongst the most fortunate circumstances in my own career, to\nhave with me a friendship so close and so intricately knit, that no\nmovement, impulse, thought, of his mind was kept from me, and if I have\nnot formed a right judgment of him, I must suppose it to be from my own\nwant of scope.  Indeed, without exaggeration, he was so nearly a prodigy,\nthat I am afraid of not being credited when I speak of him, even though I\nshould keep much within the mark of my own actual knowledge.  And for\nthis time, Monsieur, I shall content myself with praying you, for the\nhonour and respect we owe to truth, to testify and believe that our\nGuienne never beheld his peer among the men of his vocation.  Under the\nhope, therefore, that you will pay him his just due, and in order to\nrefresh him in your memory, I present you this book, which will answer\nfor me that, were it not for the insufficiency of my power, I would offer\nyou as willingly something of my own, as an acknowledgment of the\nobligations I owe to you, and of the ancient favour and friendship which\nyou have borne towards the members of our house.  But, Monsieur, in\ndefault of better coin, I offer you in payment the assurance of my desire\nto do you humble service.\nMonsieur, I pray God to have you in His keeping.  Your obedient servant,\nMICHEL DE MONTAIGNE.\nIV.\nTo Monsieur, Monsieur de MESMES, Lord of Roissy and Malassize, Privy\nCouncillor to the King.\nMONSIEUR,--It is one of the most conspicuous follies committed by men,\nto employ the strength of their understanding in overturning and\ndestroying those opinions which are commonly received among us, and which\nafford us satisfaction and content; for while everything beneath heaven\nemploys the ways and means placed at its disposal by nature for the\nadvancement and commodity of its being, these, in order to appear of a\nmore sprightly and enlightened wit, not accepting anything which has not\nbeen tried and balanced a thousand times with the most subtle reasoning,\nsacrifice their peace of mind to doubt, uneasiness, and feverish\nexcitement.  It is not without reason that childhood and simplicity have\nbeen recommended by holy writ itself.  For my part, I prefer to be quiet\nrather than clever: give me content, even if I am not to be so wide in my\nrange.  This is the reason, Monsieur, why, although persons of an\ningenious turn laugh at our care as to what will happen after our own\ntime, for instance, to our souls, which, lodged elsewhere, will lose all\nconsciousness of what goes on here below, yet I consider it to be a great\nconsolation for the frailty and brevity of life, to reflect that we have\nthe power of prolonging it by reputation and fame; and I embrace very\nreadily this pleasant and favourable notion original with our being,\nwithout inquiring too critically how or why it is.  Insomuch that having\nloved, beyond everything, the late M. de la Boetie, the greatest man, in\nmy judgment, of our age, I should think myself very negligent of my duty\nif I failed, to the utmost of my power, to prevent such a name as his,\nand a memory so richly meriting remembrance, from falling into oblivion;\nand if I did not use my best endeavour to keep them fresh.  I believe\nthat he feels something of what I do on his behalf, and that my services\ntouch and rejoice him.  In fact, he lives in my heart so vividly and so\nwholly, that I am loath to believe him committed to the dull ground, or\naltogether cast off from communication with us.  Therefore, Monsieur,\nsince every new light I can shed on him and his name, is so much added to\nhis second period of existence, and, moreover, since his name is ennobled\nand honoured by the place which receives it, it falls to me not only to\nextend it as widely as I can, but to confide it to the keeping of persons\nof honour and virtue; among whom you hold such a rank, that, to afford\nyou the opportunity of receiving this new guest, and giving him good\nentertainment, I decided on presenting to you this little work, not for\nany profit you are likely to derive from it, being well aware that you do\nnot need to have Plutarch and his companions interpreted to you--but it\nis possible that Madame de Roissy, reading in it the order of her\nhousehold management and of your happy accord painted to the life, will\nbe pleased to see how her own natural inclination has not only reached\nbut surpassed the theories of the wisest philosophers, regarding the\nduties and laws of the wedded state.  And, at all events, it will be\nalways an honour to me, to be able to do anything which shall be for the\npleasure of you and yours, on account of the obligation under which I lie\nto serve you.\nMonsieur, I pray God to grant you a long and happy life.  From Montaigne,\nthis 30th April 1570.  Your humble servant,\nMICHEL DE MONTAIGNE.\nV.\nTo Monsieur, Monsieur de L'HOSPITAL, Chancellor of France\nMONSEIGNEUR,--I am of the opinion that persons such as you, to whom\nfortune and reason have committed the charge of public affairs, are not\nmore inquisitive in any point than in ascertaining the character of those\nin office under you; for no society is so poorly furnished, but that, if\na proper distribution of authority be used, it has persons sufficient for\nthe discharge of all official duties; and when this is the case, nothing\nis wanting to make a State perfect in its constitution.  Now, in\nproportion as this is so much to be desired, so it is the more difficult\nof accomplishment, since you cannot have eyes to embrace a multitude so\nlarge and so widely extended, nor to see to the bottom of hearts, in\norder that you may discover intentions and consciences, matters\nprincipally to be considered; so that there has never been any\ncommonwealth so well organised, in which we might not detect often enough\ndefect in such a department or such a choice; and in those systems, where\nignorance and malice, favouritism, intrigue, and violence govern, if any\nselection happens to be made on the ground of merit and regularity, we\nmay doubtless thank Fortune, which, in its capricious movements, has for\nonce taken the path of reason.\nThis consideration, Monseigneur, often consoled me, when I beheld M.\nEtienne de la Boetie, one of the fittest men for high office in France,\npass his whole life without employment and notice, by his domestic\nhearth, to the singular detriment of the public; for, so far as he was\nconcerned, I may assure you, Monseigneur, that he was so rich in those\ntreasures which defy fortune, that never was man more satisfied or\ncontent.  I know, indeed, that he was raised to the dignities connected\nwith his neighbourhood--dignities accounted considerable; and I know\nalso, that no one ever acquitted himself better of them; and when he died\nat the age of thirty-two, he enjoyed a reputation in that way beyond all\nwho had preceded him.\nBut for all that, it is no reason that a man should be left a common\nsoldier, who deserves to become a captain; nor to assign mean functions\nto those who are perfectly equal to the highest.  In truth, his powers\nwere badly economised and too sparingly employed; insomuch that, over and\nabove his actual work, there was abundant capacity lying idle which might\nhave been called into service, both to the public advantage and his own\nprivate glory.\nTherefore, Monseigneur, since he was so indifferent to his own fame (for\nvirtue and ambition, unfortunately, seldom lodge together), and since he\nlived in an age when others were too dull or too jealous to witness to\nhis character, I have it marvellously at heart that his memory, at all\nevents, to which I owe the good offices of a friend, should enjoy the\nrecompense of his brave life; and that it should survive in the good\nreport of men of honour and virtue.  On this account, sir, I have been\ndesirous to bring to light, and present to you, such few Latin verses as\nhe left behind.  Different from the builder, who places the most\nattractive, portion of his house towards the street, and to the draper,\nwho displays in his window his best goods, that which was most precious\nin my friend, the juice and marrow of his genius, departed with him, and\nthere have remained to us but the bark and the leaves.\nThe exactly regulated movements of his mind, his piety, his virtue, his\njustice, his vivacity, the solidity and soundness of his judgment, the\nloftiness of his ideas, raised so far above the common level, his\nlearning, the grace which accompanied his most ordinary actions, the\ntender affection he had for his miserable country, and his supreme and\nsworn detestation of all vice, but principally of that villainous traffic\nwhich disguises itself under the honourable name of justice, should\ncertainly impress all well-disposed persons with a singular love towards\nhim, and an extraordinary regret for his loss.  But, sir, I am unable to\ndo justice to all these qualities; and of the fruit of his own studies it\nhad not entered into his mind to leave any proof to posterity; all that\nremains, is the little which, as a pastime, he did at intervals.\nHowever this may be, I beg you, sir, to receive it kindly; and as our\njudgment of great things is many times formed from lesser things, and as\neven the recreations of illustrious men carry with them, to intelligent\nobservers, some honourable traits of their origin, I would have you form\nfrom this, some knowledge of him, and hence lovingly cherish his name and\nhis memory.  In this, sir, you will only reciprocate the high opinion\nwhich he had of your virtue, and realise what he infinitely desired in\nhis lifetime; for there was no one in the world in whose acquaintance and\nfriendship he would have been so happy to see himself established, as in\nyour own.  But if any man is offended by the freedom which I use with the\nbelongings of another, I can tell him that nothing which has been written\nor been laid down, even in the schools of philosophy, respecting the\nsacred duties and rights of friendship, could give an adequate idea of\nthe relations which subsisted between this personage and myself.\nMoreover, sir, this slender gift, to make two throws of one stone at the\nsame time, may likewise serve, if you please, to testify the honour and\nrespect which I entertain for your ability and high qualities; for as to\nthose gifts which are adventitious and accidental, it is not to my taste\nto take them into account.\nSir, I pray God to grant you a very happy and a very long life.  From\nMontaigne, this 30th of April 1570.--Your humble and obedient servant,\nMICHEL DE MONTAIGNE.\nTo Monsieur, Monsieur de Folx, Privy Councillor, and Ambassador of His\nMajesty to the Signory of Venice.--[ Printed before the 'Vers Francois'\nof Etienne de la Boetie, 8vo, Paris, 1572.]\nSIR,--Being on the point of commending to you and to posterity the memory\nof the late Etienne de la Boetie, as well for his extreme virtue as for\nthe singular affection which he bore to me, it struck me as an\nindiscretion very serious in its results, and meriting some coercion from\nour laws, the practice which often prevails of robbing virtue of glory,\nits faithful associate, in order to confer it, in accordance with our\nprivate interests and without discrimination, on the first comer; seeing\nthat our two principal guiding reins are reward and punishment, which\nonly touch us properly, and as men, through the medium of honour and\ndishonour, forasmuch as these penetrate the mind, and come home to our\nmost intimate feelings: just where animals themselves are susceptible,\nmore or less, to all other kinds of recompense and corporal chastisement.\nMoreover, it is well to notice that the custom of praising virtue, even\nin those who are no longer with us, impalpable as it is to them, serves\nas a stimulant to the living to imitate their example; just as capital\nsentences are carried out by the law, more for the sake of warning to\nothers, than in relation to those who suffer.  Now, commendation and its\nopposite being analogous as regards effects, we cannot easily deny\nthe fact, that although the law prohibits one man from slandering the\nreputation of another, it does not prevent us from bestowing reputation\nwithout cause.  This pernicious licence in respect to the distribution of\npraise, has formerly been confined in its area of operations; and it may\nbe the reason why poetry once lost favour with the more judicious.\nHowever this may be, it cannot be concealed that the vice of falsehood is\none very unbecoming in gentleman, let it assume what guise it will.\nAs for that personage of whom I am speaking to you, sir he leads me far\naway indeed from this kind of language; for the danger in his case is\nnot, lest I should lend him anything, but that I might take something\nfrom him; and it is his ill-fortune that, while he has supplied me, so\nfar as ever a man could, with just and obvious opportunities for\ncommendation, I find myself unable and unqualified to render it to him\n--I, who am his debtor for so many vivid communications, and who alone\nhave it in my power to answer for a million of accomplishments,\nperfections, and virtues, latent (thanks to his unkind stars) in so noble\na soul.  For the nature of things having (I know not how) permitted that\ntruth, fair and acceptable--as it may be of itself, is only embraced\nwhere there are arts of persuasion, to insinuate it into our minds, I see\nmyself so wanting, both in authority to support my simple testimony, and\nin the eloquence requisite for lending it value and weight, that I was on\nthe eve of relinquishing the task, having nothing of his which would\nenable me to exhibit to the world a proof of his genius and knowledge.\nIn truth, sir, having been overtaken by his fate in the flower of his\nage, and in the full enjoyment of the most vigorous health, it had been\nhis design to publish some day works which would have demonstrated to\nposterity what sort of a man he was; and, peradventure, he was\nindifferent enough to fame, having formed such a plan in his head, to\nproceed no further in it.  But I have come to the conclusion, that it was\nfar more excusable in him to bury with him all his rare endowments, than\nit would be on my part to bury also with me the knowledge of them which I\nhad acquired from him; and, therefore, having collected with care all the\nremains which I found scattered here and there among his papers, I intend\nto distribute them so as to recommend his memory to as many persons as\npossible, selecting the most suitable and worthy of my acquaintance, and\nthose whose testimony might do him greatest honour: such as you, sir, who\nmay very possibly have had some knowledge of him during his life, but\nassuredly too slight to discover the perfect extent of his worth.\nPosterity may credit me, if it chooses, when I swear upon my conscience,\nthat I knew and saw him to be such as, all things considered, I could\nneither desire nor imagine a genius surpassing his.\nI beg you very humbly, sir, not only to take his name under your general\nprotection, but also these ten or twelve French stanzas, which lay\nthemselves, as of necessity, under shadow of your patronage.  For I will\nnot disguise from you, that their publication was deferred, upon the\nappearance of his other writings, under the pretext (as it was alleged\nyonder at Paris) that they were too crude to come to light.  You will\njudge, sir, how much truth there is in this; and since it is thought that\nhereabout nothing can be produced in our own dialect but what is\nbarbarous and unpolished, it falls to you, who, besides your rank as the\nfirst house in Guienne, indeed down from your ancestors, possess every\nother sort of qualification, to establish, not merely by your example,\nbut by your authoritative testimony, that such is not always the case:\nthe more so that, though 'tis more natural with the Gascons to act than\ntalk, yet sometimes they employ the tongue more than the arm, and wit in\nplace of valour.\nFor my own part; sir, it is not in my way to judge of such matters; but I\nhave heard persons who are supposed to understand them, say that these\nstanzas are not only worthy to be presented in the market-place, but,\nindependently of that, as regards beauty and wealth of invention, they\nare full of marrow and matter as any compositions of the kind, which have\nappeared in our language.  Naturally each workman feels himself more\nstrong in some special part his art, and those are to be regarded as most\nfortunate, who lay hands on the noblest, for all the parts essential to\nthe construction of any whole are not equally precious.  We find\nelsewhere, perhaps, greater delicacy phrase, greater softness and harmony\nof language; but imaginative grace, and in the store of pointed wit, I do\nnot think he has been surpassed; and we should take the account that he\nmade these things neither his occupation nor his study, and that he\nscarcely took a pen in his hand more than once a year, as is shown by the\nvery slender quantity of his remains.  For you see here, sir, green wood\nand dry, without any sort of selection, all that has come into my\npossession; insomuch that there are among the rest efforts even of his\nboyhood.  In point of fact, he seems to have written them merely to show\nthat he was capable of dealing with all subjects: for otherwise,\nthousands of times, in the course of ordinary conversation, I have heard\nthings drop from him infinitely more worthy of being admired, infinitely\nmore worthy of being preserved.\nSuch, sir, is what justice and affection, forming in this instance a rare\nconjunction, oblige me to say of this great and good man; and if I have\nat all offended by the freedom which I have taken in addressing myself to\nyou on such a subject at such a length, be pleased to recollect that the\nprincipal result of greatness and eminence is to lay one open to\nimportunate appeals on behalf of the rest of the world.  Herewith, after\ndesiring you to accept my affectionate devotion to your service,\nI beseech God to vouchsafe you, sir, a fortunate and prolonged life.\nFrom Montaigne, this 1st of September 1570.--Your obedient servant,\nMICHEL DE MONTAIGNE.\nTo Mademoiselle de MONTAIGNE, my Wife.--[Printed as a preface to the\n\"Consolation of Plutarch to his Wife,\" published by Montaigne, with\nseveral other tracts by La Boetie, about 1571.]\nMY WIFE,--You understand well that it is not proper for a man of the\nworld, according to the rules of this our time, to continue to court and\ncaress you; for they say that a sensible person may take a wife indeed,\nbut that to espouse her is to act like a fool.  Let them talk; I adhere\nfor my part the custom of the good old days; I also wear my hair as it\nused to be then; and, in truth, novelty costs this poor country up to the\npresent moment so dear (and I do not know whether we have reached the\nhighest pitch yet), that everywhere and in everything I renounce the\nfashion.  Let us live, my wife, you and I, in the old French method.\nNow, you may recollect that the late M. de la Boetie, my brother and\ninseparable companion, gave me, on his death-bed, all his books and\npapers, which have remained ever since the most precious part of my\neffects.  I do not wish to keep them niggardly to myself alone, nor do I\ndeserve to have the exclusive use of them; so that I have resolved to\ncommunicate them to my friends; and because I have none, I believe, more\nparticularly intimate you, I send you the Consolatory Letter written by\nPlutarch to his Wife, translated by him into French; regretting much that\nfortune has made it so suitable a present you, and that, having had but\none child, and that a daughter, long looked for, after four years of your\nmarried life it was your lot to lose her in the second year of her age.\nBut I leave to Plutarch the duty of comforting you, acquainting you with\nyour duty herein, begging you to put your faith in him for my sake; for\nhe will reveal to you my own ideas, and will express the matter far\nbetter than I should myself.  Hereupon, my wife, I commend myself very\nheartily to your good will, and pray God to have you in His keeping.\nFrom Paris, this 10th September 1570.--Your good husband,\nMICHEL DE MONTAIGNE.\nVIII.\nTo Monsieur DUPUY,--[This is probably the Claude Dupuy, born at Paris in\n1545, and one of the fourteen judges sent into Guienne after the treaty\nof Fleix in 1580.  It was perhaps under these circumstances that\nMontaigne addressed to him the present letter.]--the King's Councillor in\nhis Court and Parliament of Paris.\nMONSIEUR,--The business of the Sieur de Verres, a prisoner, who is\nextremely well known to me, deserves, in the arrival at a decision,\nthe exercise of the clemency natural to you, if, in the public interest,\nyou can fairly call it into play.  He has done a thing not only\nexcusable, according to the military laws of this age, but necessary and\n(as we are of opinion) commendable.  He committed the act, without doubt,\nunwillingly and under pressure; there is no other passage of his life\nwhich is open to reproach.  I beseech you, sir, to lend the matter your\nattentive consideration; you will find the character of it as I represent\nit to you.  He is persecuted on this crime, in a way which is far worse\nthan the offence itself.  If it is likely to be of use to him, I desire\nto inform you that he is a man brought up in my house, related to several\nrespectable families, and a person who, having led an honourable life,\nis my particular friend.  By saving him you lay me under an extreme\nobligation.  I beg you very humbly to regard him as recommended by me,\nand, after kissing your hands, I pray God, sir, to grant you a long and\nhappy life.  From Castera, this 23d of April [1580].  Your affectionate\nservant,\nMONTAIGNE.\nIX.\nTo the Jurats of Bordeaux.--[Published from the original among the\narchives of the town of Bordeaux, M. Gustave Brunet in the Bulletin du\nBibliophile, July 1839.]\nGENTLEMEN,--I trust that the journey of Monsieur de Cursol will be of\nadvantage to the town.  Having in hand a case so just and so favourable,\nyou did all in your power to put the business in good trim; and matters\nbeing so well situated, I beg you to excuse my absence for some little\ntime longer, and I will abridge my stay so far as the pressure of my\naffairs permits.  I hope that the delay will be short; however, you will\nkeep me, if you please, in your good grace, and will command me, if the\noccasion shall arise, in employing me in the public service and in yours.\nMonsieur de Cursol has also written to me and apprised me of his journey.\nI humbly commend myself to you, and pray God, gentlemen, to grant you\nlong and happy life.  From Montaigne, this 21st of May 1582.  Your humble\nbrother and servant,\nMONTAIGNE.\nX.\nTo the same.--[The original is among the archives of Toulouse.]\nGENTLEMEN,--I have taken my fair share of the satisfaction which you\nannounce to me as feeling at the good despatch of your business, as\nreported to you by your deputies, and I regard it as a favourable sign\nthat you have made such an auspicious commencement of the year.  I hope\nto join you at the earliest convenient opportunity.  I recommend myself\nvery humbly to your gracious consideration, and pray God to grant you,\ngentlemen, a happy and long life.  From Montaigne, this 8th February\n1585.  Your humble brother and servant,\nMONTAIGNE.\nXI.\nTo the same.\nGENTLEMEN,--I have here received news of you from M. le Marechal.  I will\nnot spare either my life or anything else for your service, and will\nleave it to your judgment whether the assistance I might be able to\nrender by my presence at the forthcoming election, would be worth the\nrisk I should run by going into the town, seeing the bad state it is in,\n--[This refers to the plague then raging, and which carried off 14,000\npersons at Bordeaux.]--particularly for people coming away from so fine\nan air as this is where I am.  I will draw as near to you on Wednesday as\nI can, that is, to Feuillas, if the malady has not reached that place,\nwhere, as I write to M. de la Molte, I shall be very pleased to have the\nhonour of seeing one of you to take your directions, and relieve myself\nof the credentials which M. le Marechal will give me for you all:\ncommending myself hereupon humbly to your good grace, and praying God to\ngrant you, gentlemen, long and happy life.  At Libourne, this 30th of\nJuly 1585.  Your humble servant and brother,\nMONTAIGNE.\nXII.--[\"According to Dr. Payen, this letter belongs to 1588.  Its\nauthenticity has been called in question; but wrongly, in our opinion.\nSee 'Documents inedits', 1847, p.  12.\"--Note in 'Essais', ed.  Paris,\n1854, iv.  381.  It does not appear to whom the letter was addressed.]\nMONSEIGNEUR,--You have heard of our baggage being taken from us under our\neyes in the forest of Villebois: then, after a good deal of discussion\nand delay, of the capture being pronounced illegal by the Prince.  We\ndared not, however, proceed on our way, from an uncertainty as to the\nsafety of our persons, which should have been clearly expressed on our\npassports.  The League has done this, M. de Barrant and M. de la\nRochefocault; the storm has burst on me, who had my money in my box.  I\nhave recovered none of it, and most of my papers and cash--[The French\nword is hardes, which St. John renders things.  But compare Chambers's\n\"Domestic Annals of Scotland,\" 2d ed.  i.  48.]--remain in their\npossession.  I have not seen the Prince.  Fifty were lost .  .  .  as for\nthe Count of Thorigny, he lost some ver plate and a few articles of\nclothing.  He diverged from his route to pay a visit to the mourning\nladies at Montresor, where are the remains of his two brothers and his\ngrandmother, and came to us again in this town, whence we shall resume\nour journey shortly.  The journey to Normandy is postponed.  The King has\ndespatched MM. De Bellieure and de la Guiche to M. de Guise to summon him\nto court; we shall be there on Thursday.\nFrom Orleans, this 16th of February, in the morning [1588-9?].--Your very\nhumble servant,\nMONTAIGNE.\nXIII.\nTo Mademoiselle PAULMIER.--[This letter, at the time of the publication\nof the variorum edition of 1854, appears to have been in private hands.\nSee vol.  iv.  p.  382.]\nMADEMOISELLE,--My friends know that, from the first moment of our\nacquaintance, I have destined a copy of my book for you; for I feel that\nyou have done it much honour.  The courtesy of M. Paulmier would deprive\nme of the pleasure of giving it to you now, for he has obliged me since a\ngreat deal beyond the worth of my book.  You will accept it then, if you\nplease, as having been yours before I owed it to you, and will confer on\nme the favour of loving it, whether for its own sake or for mine; and I\nwill keep my debt to M. Paulmier undischarged, that I may requite him, if\nI have at some other time the means of serving him.\nXIV.\nTo the KING, HENRY IV.--[The original is in the French national library,\nin the Dupuy collection.  It was first discovered by M. Achille Jubinal,\nwho printed it with a facsimile of the entire autograph, in 1850.  St.\nJohn gives the date wrongly as the 1st January 1590.]\nSIRE, It is to be above the weight and crowd of your great and important\naffairs, to know, as you do, how to lend yourself, and attend to small\nmatters in their turn, according to the duty of your royal dignity, which\nexposes you at all times to every description and degree of person and\nemployment.  Yet, that your Majesty should have deigned to consider my\nletter, and direct a reply to be made to it, I prefer to owe, less to\nyour strong understanding, than to your kindness of heart.  I have always\nlooked forward to your enjoyment of your present fortune, and you may\nrecollect that, even when I had to make confession of itto my cure, I\nviewed your successes with satisfaction: now, with the greater propriety\nand freedom, I embrace them affectionately.  They serve you where you are\nas positive matters of fact; but they serve us here no less by the fame\nwhich they diffuse: the echo carries as much weight as the blow.  We\nshould not be able to derive from the justice of your cause such powerful\narguments for the maintenance and reduction of your subjects, as we do\nfrom the reports of the success of your undertaking; and then I have to\nassure your Majesty, that the recent changes to your advantage, which you\nobserve hereabouts, the prosperous issue of your proceedings at Dieppe,\nhave opportunely seconded the honest zeal and marvellous prudence of M.\nthe Marshal de Matignon, from whom I flatter myself that you do not\nreceive day by day accounts of such good and signal services without\nremembering my assurances and expectations.  I look to the next summer,\nnot only for fruits which we may eat, but for those to grow out of our\ncommon tranquillity, and that it will pass over our heads with the same\neven tenor of happiness, dissipating, like its predecessors, all the fine\npromises with which your adversaries sustain the spirits of their\nfollowers.  The popular inclinations resemble a tidal wave; if the\ncurrent once commences in your favour, it will go on of its own force to\nthe end.  I could have desired much that the private gain of the soldiers\nof your army, and the necessity for satisfying them, had not deprived\nyou, especially in this principal town, of the glorious credit of treating\nyour mutinous subjects, in the midst of victory, with greater clemency\nthan their own protectors, and that, as distinguished from a passing and\nusurped repute, you could have shown them to be really your own, by the\nexercise of a protection truly paternal and royal.  In the conduct of\nsuch affairs as you have in hand, men are obliged to have recourse to\nunusual expedients.  It is always seen that they are surmounted by their\nmagnitude and difficulty; it not being found easy to complete the\nconquest by arms and force, the end has been accomplished by clemency and\ngenerosity, excellent lures to draw men particularly towards the just and\nlegitimate side.  If there is to be severity and punishment, let it be\ndeferred till success has been assured.  A great conqueror of past times\nboasts that he gave his enemies as great an inducement to love him, as\nhis friends.  And here we feel already some effect of the favourable\nimpression produced upon our rebellious towns by the contrast between\ntheir rude treatment, and that of those which are loyal to you.  Desiring\nyour Majesty a happiness more tangible and less hazardous, and that you\nmay be beloved rather than feared by your people, and believing that your\nwelfare and theirs are of necessity knit together, I rejoice to think that\nthe progress which you make is one towards more practicable conditions of\npeace, as well as towards victory!\nSire, your letter of the last of November came to my hand only just now,\nwhen the time which it pleased you to name for meeting you at Tours had\nalready passed.  I take it as a singular favour that you should have\ndeigned to desire a visit from so useless a person, but one who is wholly\nyours, and more so even by affection than from duty.  You have acted very\ncommendably in adapting yourself, in the matter of external forms, to\nyour new fortunes; but the preservation of your old affability and\nfrankness in private intercourse is entitled to an equal share of praise.\nYou have condescended to take thought for my age, no less than for the\ndesire which I have to see you, where you may be at rest from these\nlaborious agitations.  Will not that be soon at Paris, Sire?  and may\nnothing prevent me from presenting myself there!--Your very humble and\nvery obedient servant and subject,\nMONTAIGNE.\nFrom Montaigne, this 18th of January [1590].\nXV.\nTo the same.--[ This letter is also in the national collection, among the\nDupuy papers.  It was first printed in the \"Journal de l'Instruction\nPublique,\" 4th November 1846.]\nSIRE,--The letter which it pleased your majesty to write to me on the\n20th of July, was not delivered to me till this morning, and found me\nlaid up with a very violent tertian ague, a complaint very common in this\npart of the country during the last month.  Sire, I consider myself\ngreatly honoured by the receipt of your commands, and I have not omitted\nto communicate to M. the Marshal de Matignon three times most\nemphatically my intention and obligation to proceed to him, and even so\nfar as to indicate the route by which I proposed to join him secretly, if\nhe thought proper.  Having received no answer, I consider that he has\nweighed the difficulty and risk of the journey to me.  Sire, your Majesty\ndill do me the favour to believe, if you please, that I shall never\ncomplain of the expense on occasions where I should not hesitate to\ndevote my life.  I have never derived any substantial benefit whatever\nfrom the bounty of kings, which I have neither sought nor merited; nor\nhave I had any recompense for the services which I have performed for\nthem: whereof your majesty is in part aware.  What I have done for your\npredecessors I shall do still more readily for you.  I am as rich, Sire,\nas I desire to be.  When I shall have exhausted my purse in attendance on\nyour Majesty at Paris, I will take the liberty to tell you, and then, if\nyou should regard me as worthy of being retained any longer in your\nsuite, you will find me more modest in my claims upon you than the\nhumblest of your officers.\nSire, I pray God for your prosperity and health.  Your very humble and\nvery obedient servant and subject,\nMONTAIGNE.\nFrom Montaigne, this 2d of September [1590].\nXVI.\nTo the Governor of Guienne.\nMONSEIGNEUR,--I have received this morning your letter, which I have\ncommunicated to M. de Gourgues, and we have dined together at the house\nof M.[the mayor] of Bourdeaux.  As to the inconvenience of transporting\nthe money named in your memorandum, you see how difficult a thing it is\nto provide for; but you may be sure that we shall keep as close a watch\nover it as possible.  I used every exertion to discover the man of whom\nyou spoke.  He has not been here; and M. de Bordeaux has shown me a\nletter in which he mentions that he could not come to see the Director of\nBordeaux, as he intended, having been informed that you mistrust him.\nThe letter is of the day before yesterday.  If I could have found him, I\nmight perhaps have pursued the gentler course, being uncertain of your\nviews; but I entreat you nevertheless to feel no manner of doubt that I\nrefuse to carry out any wishes of yours, and that, where your commands\nare concerned, I know no distinction of person or matter.  I hope that\nyou have in Guienne many as well affected to you as I am.  They report\nthat the Nantes galleys are advancing towards Brouage.  M. the Marshal de\nBiron has not yet left.  Those who were charged to convey the message to\nM. d'Usee say that they cannot find him; and I believe that, if he has\nbeen here, he is so no longer.  We keep a vigilant eye on our gates and\nguards, and we look after them a little more attentively in your absence,\nwhich makes me apprehensive, not merely on account of the preservation of\nthe town, but likewise for your oven sake, knowing that the enemies of\nthe king feel how necessary you are to his service, and how ill we should\nprosper without you.  I am afraid that, in the part where you are, you\nwill be overtaken by so many affairs requiring your attention on every\nside, that it will take you a long time and involve great difficulty\nbefore you have disposed of everything.  If there is any important news,\nI will despatch an express at once, and you may conclude that nothing is\nstirring if you do not hear from me: at the same time begging you to bear\nin mind that movements of this kind are wont to be so sudden and\nunexpected that, if they occur, they will grasp me by the throat, before\nthey say a word.  I will do what I can to collect news, and for this\npurpose I will make a point of visiting and seeing men of every shade of\nopinion.  Down to the present time nothing is stirring.  M. de Londel has\nseen me this morning, and we have been arranging for some advances for\nthe place, where I shall go to-morrow morning.  Since I began this\nletter, I have learnt from Chartreux that two gentlemen, describing\nthemselves as in the service of M. de Guise, and coming from Agen, have\npassed near Chartreux; but I was not able to ascertain which road they\nhave taken.  They are expecting you at Agen.  The Sieur de Mauvesin came\nas far as Canteloup, and thence returned, having got some intelligence.\nI am in search of one Captain Rous, to whom .  .  .  wrote, trying to\ndraw him into his cause by all sorts of promises.  The rumour of the two\nNantes galleys ready to descend on Brouage is confirmed as certain; they\ncarry two companies of foot.  M. de Mercure is at Nantes.  The Sieur de\nla Courbe said to M. the President Nesmond that M. d'Elbeuf is on this\nside of Angiers, and lodges with his father.  He is drawing towards Lower\nPoictou with 4000 foot and 400 or 500 horse, having been reinforced by\nthe troops of M. de Brissac and others, and M. de Mercure is to join him.\nThe report goes also that M. du Maine is about to take the command of all\nthe forces they have collected in Auvergne, and that he will cross Le\nForet to advance on Rouergue and us, that is to say, on the King of\nNavarre, against whom all this is being directed.  M. de Lansac is at\nBourg, and has two war vessels, which remain in attendance on him.  His\nfunctions are naval.  I tell you what I learn, and mix up together the\nmore or less probable hearsay of the town with actual matter of fact,\nthat you may be in possession of everything.  I beg you most humbly to\nreturn directly affairs may allow you to do so, and assure you that,\nmeanwhile, we shall not spare our labour, or (if that were necessary) our\nlife, to maintain the king's authority throughout.  Monseigneur, I kiss\nyour hands very respectfully, and pray God to have you in His keeping.\nFrom Bordeaux, Wednesday night, 22d May (1590-91).--Your very humble\nservant,\nMONTAIGNE.\nI have seen no one from the king of Navarre; they say that M. de Biron\nhas seen him.\nTHE AUTHOR TO THE READER.--[Omitted by Cotton.]\nREADER, thou hast here an honest book; it doth at the outset forewarn\nthee that, in contriving the same, I have proposed to myself no other\nthan a domestic and private end: I have had no consideration at all\neither to thy service or to my glory.  My powers are not capable of any\nsuch design.  I have dedicated it to the particular commodity of my\nkinsfolk and friends, so that, having lost me (which they must do\nshortly), they may therein recover some traits of my conditions and\nhumours, and by that means preserve more whole, and more life-like, the\nknowledge they had of me.  Had my intention been to seek the world's\nfavour, I should surely have adorned myself with borrowed beauties: I\ndesire therein to be viewed as I appear in mine own genuine, simple, and\nordinary manner, without study and artifice: for it is myself I paint.\nMy defects are therein to be read to the life, and any imperfections and\nmy natural form, so far as public reverence hath permitted me.  If I had\nlived among those nations, which (they say) yet dwell under the sweet\nliberty of nature's primitive laws, I assure thee I would most willingly\nhave painted myself quite fully and quite naked.  Thus, reader, myself am\nthe matter of my book: there's no reason thou shouldst employ thy leisure\nabout so frivolous and vain a subject.   Therefore farewell.\nFrom Montaigne, the 12th June 1580--[So in the edition of 1595; the\nedition of 1588 has 12th June 1588]\nFrom Montaigne, the 1st March 1580.\n--[See Bonnefon, Montaigne, 1893, p. 254.

Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg\u2122\nProject Gutenberg\u2122 is synonymous with the free distribution of\nelectronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of\ncomputers including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers. It\nexists because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations\nfrom people in all walks of life.\nVolunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the\nassistance they need are critical to reaching Project Gutenberg\u2122\u2019s\ngoals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg\u2122 collection will\nremain freely available for generations to come. In 2001, the Project\nGutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure\nand permanent future for Project Gutenberg\u2122 and future\ngenerations. To learn more about the Project Gutenberg Literary\nArchive Foundation and how your efforts and donations can help, see\nSections 3 and 4 and the Foundation information page at www.gutenberg.org.\nSection 3. Information about the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation\nThe Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation is a non-profit\n501(c)(3) educational corporation organized under the laws of the\nstate of Mississippi and granted tax exempt status by the Internal\nRevenue Service. The Foundation\u2019s EIN or federal tax identification\nnumber is 64-6221541. Contributions to the Project Gutenberg Literary\nArchive Foundation are tax deductible to the full extent permitted by\nU.S. federal laws and your state\u2019s laws.\nThe Foundation\u2019s business office is located at 809 North 1500 West,\nSalt Lake City, UT 84116, (801) 596-1887. Email contact links and up\nto date contact information can be found at the Foundation\u2019s website\nand official page at www.gutenberg.org/contact\nSection 4. Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg\nLiterary Archive Foundation\nProject Gutenberg\u2122 depends upon and cannot survive without widespread\npublic support and donations to carry out its mission of\nincreasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be\nfreely distributed in machine-readable form accessible by the widest\narray of equipment including outdated equipment. Many small donations\n($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt\nstatus with the IRS.\nThe Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating\ncharities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United\nStates. Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a\nconsiderable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up\nwith these requirements. We do not solicit donations in locations\nwhere we have not received written confirmation of compliance. To SEND\nDONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any particular state\nvisit www.gutenberg.org/donate.\nWhile we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we\nhave not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition\nagainst accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who\napproach us with offers to donate.\nInternational donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make\nany statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from\noutside the United States. U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.\nPlease check the Project Gutenberg web pages for current donation\nmethods and addresses. Donations are accepted in a number of other\nways including checks, online payments and credit card donations. To\ndonate, please visit: www.gutenberg.org/donate.\nSection 5. General Information About Project Gutenberg\u2122 electronic works\nProfessor Michael S. Hart was the originator of the Project\nGutenberg\u2122 concept of a library of electronic works that could be\nfreely shared with anyone. For forty years, he produced and\ndistributed Project Gutenberg\u2122 eBooks with only a loose network of\nvolunteer support.\nProject Gutenberg\u2122 eBooks are often created from several printed\neditions, all of which are confirmed as not protected by copyright in\nthe U.S. unless a copyright notice is included. Thus, we do not\nnecessarily keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper\nedition.\nMost people start at our website which has the main PG search\nfacility: www.gutenberg.org.\nThis website includes information about Project Gutenberg\u2122,\nincluding how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary\nArchive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to\nsubscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.", "source": "vol1.txt"}
