{"text": "\"Faith begins precisely where thinking leaves off.\"\n\"If there were no eternal consciousness in a man, if at the foundation of all there lay only a wildly seething power which writhing with obscure passions produced everything that is great and everything that is insignificant, if a bottomless void never satiated lay hidden beneath all\u2014what then would life be but despair?\"\n\"By faith Abraham went out from the land of his fathers and became a sojourner in the land of promise. He left one thing behind, took one thing with him: he left his earthly understanding behind and took faith with him\u2014otherwise he would not have wandered forth but would have thought this unreasonable.\"\n\"The knight of faith is the only happy man, the heir to the finite, while the knight of resignation is a stranger and an alien.\"\n\"Infinite resignation is the last stage prior to faith, so that one who has not made this movement has not faith; for only in infinite resignation do I become clear to myself with respect to my eternal validity, and only then can there be question of grasping existence by virtue of faith.\"", "source": "fear_and_trembling.txt"}

{"text": "\"The specific character of despair is precisely this: it is unaware of being despair.\"\n\"To have a self, to be a self, is the greatest concession made to man, but at the same time it is eternity's demand upon him.\"\n\"Despair is the sickness unto death.\"\n\"The torment of despair is precisely this: not to be able to die. So it has much in common with the situation of the dying man when he lies and struggles with death, and is not able to die.\"\n\"Man is spirit. But what is spirit? Spirit is the self. But what is the self? The self is a relation which relates itself to its own self, or it is that in the relation [which accounts for it] that the relation relates itself to its own self; the self is not the relation but [consists in the fact] that the relation relates itself to its own self.\"", "source": "sickness_unto_death.txt"}
