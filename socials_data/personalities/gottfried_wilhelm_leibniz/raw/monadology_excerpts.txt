THE MONADOLOGY

1. The Monad, of which we shall here speak, is nothing but a simple substance, which enters into composites; simple, that is to say, without parts.

2. And there must be simple substances, since there are composites; for a composite is nothing but a collection or aggregatum of simple things.

3. Now where there are no parts, there can be neither extension nor figure nor divisibility. These Monads are the real atoms of nature and in a word the elements of things.

4. No dissolution of these elements need be feared, and there is no conceivable way in which a simple substance can be destroyed by natural means.

5. For the same reason there is no conceivable way in which a simple substance can come into existence by natural means, since it cannot be formed by the composition of parts.

6. Thus it may be said that a Monad can only come into existence or end its existence all at once; that is to say, it can come into existence only by creation and end only by annihilation, while that which is compound comes into existence or ends by parts.

7. Further, there is no way of explaining how a Monad can be altered in quality or internally changed by any other creature; since it is impossible to change the place of anything in it or to conceive in it any internal motion which could be produced, directed, increased or diminished therein, although all this is possible in the case of composites, in which there are changes among the parts. The Monads have no windows, through which anything could come in or go out. Accidents cannot separate themselves from substances nor go about outside of them, as the 'sensible species' of the Scholastics used to do. Thus neither substance nor accident can enter a Monad from without.

8. Yet the Monads must have some qualities, otherwise they would not even be existing things. And if simple substances did not differ in quality, there would be absolutely no means of perceiving any change in things. For what is in the compound can come only from the simple elements it contains, and the Monads, if they had no qualities, would be indistinguishable from one another, since they do not differ in quantity. Consequently, space being a plenum, each part of space would always receive, in any motion, exactly the equivalent of what it already had, and no one state of things would be indiscernible from another.

9. Indeed, each Monad must be different from every other. For in nature there are never two beings which are perfectly alike and in which it is not possible to find an internal difference, or at least a difference founded upon an internal quality.

10. I assume also as admitted that every created being, and consequently the created Monad, is subject to change, and further that this change is continuous in each.

11. It follows from what has just been said, that the natural changes of the Monads come from an internal principle, since an external cause can have no influence upon their inner being.

12. But, besides the principle of the change, there must be a detail of what changes, which, so to speak, makes up the specific nature and variety of the simple substances.

13. This detail should involve a multitude in the unit or in the simple; for, since every natural change takes place by degrees, something changes and something remains; and consequently in the simple substance there must be a plurality of affections and relations, although there are no parts.

14. The passing condition, which involves and represents a multitude in the unit or in the simple substance, is nothing but what is called Perception, which is to be distinguished from Apperception or Consciousness, as will appear in what follows. In this matter the Cartesian view is extremely defective, for it treats as non-existent those perceptions of which we are not consciously aware. This has also led them to believe that minds alone are Monads, and that there are no souls of animals nor other Entelechies. They have failed to notice the state of stupor, in which we are like the machines, and this has led them to confuse a prolonged stupor with death, and made them regard souls as separate from bodies.

15. The soul follows its own laws, and the body follows its own likewise, and they agree with each other in virtue of the pre-established harmony between all substances, since they are all representations of one and the same universe.
