Diapsalmata

What is a poet? An unhappy man who in his heart harbors a deep anguish, but whose lips are so fashioned that the sighs and cries which pass over them are transformed into ravishing music. His fate is like that of the unfortunate victims whom the tyrant Phalaris imprisoned in a brazen bull, and slowly tortured over a steady fire; their cries could not reach the tyrant’s ears so as to strike terror into his heart; when they reached him they sounded like sweet music. And men crowd about the poet and say to him, "Sing for us soon again"—which is as much as to say, "May new sufferings torment your soul, but may your lips be fashioned as before; for the cries would only distress us, but the music is delicious."

I have the courage, I believe, to doubt everything; I have the courage, I believe, to fight with everything; but I have not the courage to know anything; not the courage to possess, to own anything. Most people complain that the world is so prosaic, that life is not like a romance, where opportunities are always so favorable. I complain that life is not like a romance, where one has hard-hearted parents and nixies and trolls to fight, and enchanted princesses to free. What are all such enemies taken together, compared with the pale, bloodless, tenacious, nocturnal shapes with which I fight, and to whom I give life and being myself?

My life is like an eternal night; when will the day dawn? When will the sun rise?

I don’t feel like doing anything. I don’t feel like riding—the motion is too violent; I don’t feel like walking—it is too strenuous; I don’t feel like lying down, for either I should have to remain lying, and I don’t feel like doing that, or I should have to get up again, and I don’t feel like doing that either. Summa Summarum: I don’t feel like doing anything.

There is nothing I should like better than to be capable of being some one else’s friend, but I cannot be that to any one, because I am my own friend.

Let others complain that the age is wicked; my complaint is that it is paltry; for it lacks passion. Men’s thoughts are thin and flimsy like lace, they are themselves pitiable like the lacemakers. The thoughts of their hearts are too paltry to be sinful. For a worm it might be regarded as a sin to harbor such thoughts, but not for a being made in the image of God. Their lusts are dull and sluggish, their passions sleepy. They do their duty, these shopkeeper-souls, but they clip the coin a little...

What I really need is a clear mind, a voice that speaks to me alone, that understands me. What I really need is faith. But where shall I find it? In the world? No, the world is a market place where everything is for sale. In the church? The church is a theater where the actors are bad and the prompter is asleep.
