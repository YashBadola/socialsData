{"text": "The wish for being is one of the most powerful of human desires. But the desire to be is also a desire for disclosure. This disclosure is the transition from being to existence.\nMan is free; but his freedom is only real in so far as it is engaged in the world. To be free is not to have the power to do anything you like; it is to be able to surpass the given toward an open future. The existence of others is not a limit to my freedom, but the condition of it.\nAs long as there have been men and they have lived, they have all felt this tragic ambiguity of their condition, but as long as there have been philosophers and they have thought, most of them have tried to mask it. They have striven to reduce mind to matter, or to reabsorb matter into mind, or to merge them within a single substance. They have denied death, or made it a passage to another life.\nLife occupies a very small place in the immense universe, and man is a very small place in life. But this living grain of dust is the center of the universe. Man is a being who makes himself a lack of being in order that there might be being.\nFreedom is the source from which all significations and all values spring. It is the original condition of all justification of existence. The man who seeks to justify his life must want freedom itself absolutely and above everything else. At the same time that it requires the realization of concrete ends, of particular projects, it requires itself universally.", "source": "ethics_of_ambiguity.txt"}
{"text": "One is not born, but rather becomes, a woman. No biological, psychological, or economic fate determines the figure that the human female presents in society; it is civilization as a whole that produces this creature, intermediate between male and eunuch, which is described as feminine. Only the intervention of someone else can establish an individual as an Other. The child would feel himself to be sexually undifferentiated for a long time if the adult environment did not take charge of his vocation.\nIt is easy to see that the duality of the sexes, like any duality, gives rise to conflict. And doubtless the winner will assume the status of Absolute. But why should the man have won? It seems that women could have won the victory; or the struggle could have resulted in a draw. Why is it that this world has always belonged to the men and that only today things are beginning to change? What is the explanation of this hierarchy?\nTo explain why woman is the Other, one could imagine a historical process. We have seen that the human species is forever in a state of change, forever becoming. The history of woman must be understood in the context of the history of man.\nMan defines woman not in herself but as relative to him; she is not regarded as an autonomous being. And she is simply what man decrees; thus she is called \"the sex\", by which is meant that she appears essentially to the male as a sexual being. For him she is sex - absolute sex, no less. She is defined and differentiated with reference to man and not he with reference to her; she is the incidental, the inessential as opposed to the essential. He is the Subject, he is the Absolute - she is the Other.", "source": "the_second_sex_intro.txt"}
{"text": "I was born at four o'clock in the morning on the 9th of January 1908, in a room fitted with white-enamelled furniture and overlooking the Boulevard Raspail.\nI had no intuition of any reality other than that which was accessible to my senses. I felt no need to decipher the secrets of the world; I was content to live in it.\nI was a dutiful daughter. I accepted the values of my class and my family. But as I grew older, I began to question them. I felt a growing sense of rebellion against the constraints placed upon me as a girl. I wanted to be free, to think for myself, to create my own life.\nMy father was a man of culture and wit, but he was also a traditionalist. He believed that a woman's place was in the home, that her primary duty was to marry and have children. My mother was a devout Catholic, deeply religious and self-sacrificing. I loved them both, but I could not accept their vision of the world.\nI discovered books, and they opened up new worlds to me. I read voraciously, everything I could get my hands on. Literature became my refuge, my escape, my path to freedom. I realized that I wanted to be a writer, to leave my mark on the world through my words.", "source": "memoirs.txt"}
