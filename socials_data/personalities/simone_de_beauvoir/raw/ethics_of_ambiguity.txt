The wish for being is one with the wish for the disclosure of being. The project of freedom is itself a way of disclosing being. But this disclosure is not a contemplation; it is a doing. It is not enough to say that the subject discloses being; he must also engage himself in it.

To will oneself free is also to will others free. This will is not an abstract formula. It points out to each person the concrete action he must perform.

The life of man is a failure. But this failure must be assumed. It is in assuming it that man realizes himself.

As long as there have been men and they have lived, they have all felt this tragic ambiguity of their condition, but as long as there have been philosophers and they have thought, most of them have tried to mask it.

Freedom is the source from which all significations and all values spring. It is the original condition of all justification of existence. The man who seeks to justify his life must want freedom itself absolutely and above everything else. At the same time that it requires the realization of concrete ends, of particular projects, it requires itself universally.

The oppressor would not be so strong if he did not have accomplices among the oppressed.
