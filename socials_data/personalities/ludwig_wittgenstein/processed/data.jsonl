{"text": "1. \"Now think of the following use of language: I send someone shopping. I give him a slip marked 'five red apples'. He takes the slip to the shopkeeper, who opens the drawer marked 'apples'; then he looks up the word 'red' in a table and finds a colour sample opposite it; then he says the series of cardinal numbers\u2014I assume that he knows them by heart\u2014up to the word 'five' and for each number he takes an apple of the same colour as the sample out of the drawer.\u2014It is in this and similar ways that one operates with words.\" \u2014 \"But how does he know where and how he is to look up the word 'red' and what he is to do with the word 'five'?\" \u2014 Well, I assume that he acts as I have described. Explanations come to an end somewhere.\u2014But what is the meaning of the word \"five\"?\u2014No such thing was in question here, only how the word \"five\" is used.\n23. But how many kinds of sentence are there? Say assertion, question, and command?\u2014There are countless kinds: countless different kinds of use of what we call \"symbols\", \"words\", \"sentences\". And this multiplicity is not something fixed, given once for all; but new types of language, new language-games, as we may say, come into existence, and others become obsolete and get forgotten. (We can get a rough picture of this from the changes in mathematics.) Here the term \"language-game\" is meant to bring into prominence the fact that the speaking of language is part of an activity, or of a form of life.\n43. For a large class of cases\u2014though not for all\u2014in which we employ the word \"meaning\" it can be defined thus: the meaning of a word is its use in the language. And the meaning of a name is sometimes explained by pointing to its bearer.\n309. What is your aim in philosophy?\u2014To shew the fly the way out of the fly-bottle.", "source": "investigations_excerpts.txt"}
