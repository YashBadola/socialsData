{"text": "It is perfectly true, as philosophers say, that life must be understood backwards. But they forget the other proposition, that it must be lived forwards. And if one thinks over that proposition it becomes more and more evident that life can never really be understood in time simply because at no particular moment can I find the necessary resting-place from which to understand it backwards.\nThe most common form of despair is not being who you are. The deepest form of despair is choosing to be another than himself.\nPeople demand freedom of speech as a compensation for the freedom of thought which they seldom use.\nAnxiety is the dizziness of freedom.\nThe crowd is untruth. There is therefore no one who has more contempt for what is known as the press than I; for it is the most powerful instrument of the untruth.\nTo dare is to lose one's footing momentarily. To not dare is to lose oneself.\nWhat I really need is to get clear about what I must do, not what I must know, except insofar as knowledge must precede every act. What matters is to find a purpose, to see what it really is that God wills that I shall do; the crucial thing is to find a truth which is truth for me, to find the idea for which I am willing to live and die.\nIf I were to wish for anything, I should not wish for wealth and power, but for the passionate sense of the potential, for the eye which, ever young and ardent, sees the possible. Pleasure disappoints, possibility never. And what wine is so sparkling, what so fragrant, what so intoxicating, as possibility!\nListen to the cry of a woman in labor at the hour of giving birth\u2014look at the dying man\u2019s struggle at his last extremity, and then tell me whether something that begins and ends thus could be intended for enjoyment.\nI have just now come from a party where I was its life and soul; witticisms streamed from my lips, everyone laughed and admired me, but I went away \u2014 yes, the dash should be as long as the radius of the earth's orbit \u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014 and wanted to shoot myself.\nFaith is precisely this paradox, that the individual as the particular is higher than the universal, is justified over against it, is not subordinate but superior\u2014yet in such a way, be it observed, that it is the particular individual who, after he has been subordinated as the particular to the universal, now through the universal becomes the individual who as the particular is superior to the universal, for the fact that the individual as the particular stands in an absolute relation to the absolute. This position cannot be mediated, for all mediation comes about precisely by virtue of the universal; it is and remains to all eternity a paradox, inaccessible to thought.\nIf anyone on the verge of action should judge himself according to the outcome, he would never begin.\nThe absurd is precisely that the individual is higher than the universal.\nMarry, and you will regret it; don\u2019t marry, you will also regret it; marry or don\u2019t marry, you will regret it either way. Laugh at the world\u2019s foolishness, you will regret it; weep over it, you will regret that too; laugh at the world\u2019s foolishness or weep over it, you will regret both. Believe a woman, you will regret it; believe her not, you will also regret it\u2026 Hang yourself, you will regret it; do not hang yourself, and you will regret that too; hang yourself or don\u2019t hang yourself, you\u2019ll regret it either way; whether you hang yourself or do not hang yourself, you will regret both. This, gentlemen, is the essence of all philosophy.", "source": "excerpts.txt"}
