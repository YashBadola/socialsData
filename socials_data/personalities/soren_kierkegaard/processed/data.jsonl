{"text": "DIAPSAMATA\nWhat is a poet? An unhappy man who in his heart harbors a deep anguish, but whose lips are so fashioned that the moans and cries which pass over them are transformed into ravishing music. His fate is like that of the unfortunate victims whom the tyrant Phalaris imprisoned in a brazen bull, and slowly tortured over a steady fire; their cries could not reach the tyrant\u2019s ears so as to strike terror into his heart; when they reached his ears they sounded like sweet music.\n...\nI feel as if I were a piece in a game of chess, when my opponent says of it: That piece cannot be moved.\n...\nMy sorrow is my castle, which like an eagle\u2019s eyrie is built high up on the mountain peak among the clouds. No one can storm it. From it I fly down into reality to seize my prey; but I do not remain down there, I bring my quarry home; and this prey is a picture I weave into the tapestries of my palace.\n...\nThe Rotation of Crops\nPeople with experience maintain that proceeding from a basic principle is the only reasonable way to behave. I grant them that and am also content to adopt the principle which is generally acknowledged to be the starting point for all human activity\u2014namely, the boredom of it.\nBoredom is the root of all evil. It is very curious that boredom, which itself has such a calm and sedate nature, can have such a capacity to initiate motion. The effect that boredom has is absolutely magical, but this effect is not one of attraction but of repulsion.\n...\nThe Aesthetic Validity of Marriage\n(Letter from Judge Vilhelm)\nMy Dear Friend,\nYou are a young man, in many respects a happily gifted young man. You are free, independent, have no family ties to bind you, no professional cares to weigh you down, you have the means to live for your pleasure, and you have enough mental agility to know how to catch the interesting side of life. You are, in short, what one might call a lucky fellow.\nAnd yet you are unhappy. Your mind is heavy, your heart is empty, your will is paralyzed. You hover above reality, but you have no foothold in it. You seek the interesting, but you find only the momentary. You are trapped in the aesthetic sphere, my friend, and you must make the movement to the ethical. You must choose!\nTo choose is to give your life a solemnity, a dignity, a worth that the aesthetic man knows nothing of. In choosing yourself, you choose your freedom.", "source": "either_or_excerpts.txt"}
{"text": "Preface\nNot only in the world of commerce but also in the world of ideas our age is putting on a real \"clearance sale.\" Everything can be had at such a bargain that it is questionable whether in the end there is anyone who will want to buy. Every speculative price-fixer who conscientiously directs attention to the significant march of modern philosophy, every private docent, tutor, and student, every crofter and cottager in philosophy, is not stopping at doubting everything but is going further.\n...\nThe Story of Abraham\nAnd God tempted Abraham, and said unto him, Abraham: and he said, Behold, here I am.\nAnd he said, Take now thy son, thine only son Isaac, whom thou lovest, and get thee into the land of Moriah; and offer him there for a burnt offering upon one of the mountains which I will tell thee of.\nIt was early in the morning, Abraham rose early, he saddled his ass, and took two of his young men with him, and Isaac his son, and clave the wood for the burnt offering, and rose up, and went unto the place of which God had told him.\n...\nProblem I: Is there a Teleological Suspension of the Ethical?\nThe ethical as such is the universal, it applies to everyone, which may be expressed from another point of view by saying that it applies every instant. It reposes immanently in itself, it has nothing without itself which is its telos, but is itself telos for everything outside it, and when this has been incorporated by it, it can go no further. Conceived immediately as physical and psychical, the particular individual is the individual who has his telos in the universal, and his ethical task is to express himself constantly in it, to abolish his particularity in order to become the universal. As soon as the individual would assert himself as the particular over against the universal, he sins, and only by recognizing this can he again reconcile himself with the universal.\nBut with Abraham the case is different. By his act he overstepped the ethical entirely and possessed a higher telos outside of it, in relation to which he suspended the former. For how could one ever bring Abraham's action under the universal? He disregarded the intermediate ethical determinants. If I were to speak of him as a murderer, I would be wrong; if I were to speak of him as one who wanted to sacrifice the best he had, I would also be wrong, for the ethical expression for what he did is that he would murder Isaac; the religious expression is that he would sacrifice Isaac\u2014but precisely in this contradiction is the dread which can well make a man sleepless, and yet Abraham is not what he is without this dread.\nFaith is precisely this paradox, that the individual as the particular is higher than the universal, is justified by it, is not subordinate but superior\u2014yet in such a way, be it observed, that it is the particular individual who, after he has been subordinated as the particular to the universal, now through the universal becomes the individual who as the particular is superior to the universal, for the fact that the individual as the particular stands in an absolute relation to the absolute. This position cannot be mediated, for all mediation comes about precisely by virtue of the universal; it is and remains to all eternity a paradox, inaccessible to thought.", "source": "fear_and_trembling_excerpts.txt"}
