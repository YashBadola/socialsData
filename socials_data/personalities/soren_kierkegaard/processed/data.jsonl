There is therefore no one who has more contempt for what it is to be a human being than those who make it their profession to lead the crowd.\nAnxiety is the dizziness of freedom.\nLife can only be understood backwards; but it must be lived forwards.\nThe most common form of despair is not being who you are.\nSubjectivity is truth.\nIt is perfectly true, as philosophers say, that life must be understood backwards. But they forget the other proposition, that it must be lived forwards.\nPeople demand freedom of speech as a compensation for the freedom of thought which they seldom use.\nThere are two ways to be fooled. One is to believe what isn't true; the other is to refuse to believe what is true.\nWhat is a poet? An unhappy man who hides deep anguish in his heart, but whose lips are so formed that when the sigh and cry pass through them, it sounds like lovely music.\nFace the facts of being what you are, for that is what changes what you are.\nIt is so hard to believe because it is so hard to obey.\nTo dare is to lose one's footing momentarily. Not to dare is to lose oneself.", "source": "sample.txt"}
