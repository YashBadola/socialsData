{"text": "God is day and night, winter and summer, war and peace, plenty and want. But he is changed, just as when incense is mingled with incense, but named according to the pleasure of each.\nCold becomes warm, and warm, cold; wet becomes dry, and dry, wet.\nWar is the father and king of all, and has produced some as gods and some as men, and has made some slaves and some free.\nThey do not understand: how that which separates unites with itself. It is a harmony of oppositions, as in the case of the bow and of the lyre.\nThe unlike is joined together, and from differences results the most beautiful harmony, and all things take place by strife.\nThe hidden harmony is better than the visible.\nThe straight and crooked way of the woolcarders is one and the same.\nSea water is very pure and very foul, for, while to fishes it is drinkable and healthful, to men it is hurtful and unfit to drink.\nHogs wash themselves in mud and doves in dust.\nThe harmony of the world is a harmony of oppositions, as in the case of the bow and of the lyre.\nGood and evil are the same.\nUnite whole and part, agreement and disagreement, accordant and discordant; from all comes one, and from one all.\nThey would not know the name of justice, were it not for these things.\nTo God all things are beautiful and good and right, though men suppose that some are right and others wrong.\nWe must know that war is universal and strife right, and that by strife all things arise and are used.\nThe way upward and downward are one and the same.\nThe beginning and end are common.\nSickness makes health pleasant and good; hunger, satiety; weariness, rest.", "source": "opposites.txt"}
{"text": "Much learning does not teach one to have understanding, else it would have taught Hesiod and Pythagoras, and again Xenophanes and Hecataeus.\nPythagoras, son of Mnesarchus, practised investigation most of all men, and having chosen out these treatises, he made a wisdom of his own--much learning and bad art.\nHesiod is a teacher of the masses. They suppose him to have possessed the greatest knowledge, who indeed did not know day and night. For they are one.\nThe Ephesians deserve, man for man, to be hung, and the youth to leave the city, inasmuch as they have banished Hermodorus, the worthiest man among them, saying: \"Let no one of us excel, and if there be any such, let him go elsewhere and among other people.\"\nDogs, also, bark at what they do not know.\nA stupid man loves to be puzzled by every discourse.\nHomer deserved to be driven out of the lists and flogged, and Archilochus likewise.\nFor the things which are considered mysteries among men, they celebrate sacrilegiously.\nAnd to these images they pray, as if one should prattle with the houses knowing nothing of gods or heroes, who they are.\nWhen defiled, they purify themselves with blood, just as if any one who had fallen into the mud should wash himself with mud!\nFor what sense or understanding have they? They follow minstrels and take the multitude for a teacher, not knowing that many are bad and few good.\nFor the best men choose one thing above all--immortal glory among mortals; but the masses stuff themselves like cattle.\nAsses would choose stubble rather than gold.", "source": "critique.txt"}
{"text": "Into the same river you could not step twice, for other and still other waters are flowing.\nTo those entering the same river, other and still other waters flow.\nIt disperses and gathers, it comes and goes.\nInto the same river we both step and do not step. We both are and are not.\nIn change is rest.\nA mixture separates when not kept in motion.\nIt is weariness upon the same things to labor and by them to be controlled.", "source": "flux.txt"}
{"text": "This world, the same for all, neither any of the gods nor any man has made, but it always was, and is, and shall be, an ever living fire, kindled in due measure, and in due measure extinguished.\nThe transmutations of fire are, first, the sea; and of the sea, half is earth, and half the lightning flash.\nAll things are exchanged for fire and fire for all things, just as wares for gold and gold for wares.\nThe sea is poured out and measured to the same proportion as existed before it became earth.\nFire lives in the death of earth, air lives in the death of fire, water lives in the death of air, and earth in the death of water.\nFire coming upon all things, will sift and seize them.\nHow can one escape that which never sets?\nLightning rules all.\nThe sun will not overstep his bounds, for if he does, the Erinyes, helpers of justice, will find him out.\nThe limits of the evening and morning are the Bear, and opposite the Bear, the bounds of bright Zeus.\nIf there were no sun, it would be night.\nThe sun is new every day.\nIf all existing things should become smoke, perception would be by the nostrils.\nPresumption must be quenched even more than a fire.", "source": "cosmos.txt"}
{"text": "Death is what we see waking. What we see in sleep is a dream.\nThere is only one supreme Wisdom. It wills and wills not to be called by the name of Zeus.\nThe name of the bow is life, but its work is death.\nImmortals are mortal, mortals immortal, living in their death and dying in their life.\nTo souls it is death to become water, and to water it is death to become earth, but from earth comes water, and from water, soul.\nThe limits of the soul you would not find out, though you should traverse every way.\nTo souls it is joy to become wet.\nA man when he is drunken is led by a beardless youth, stumbling, ignorant where he is going, having a wet soul.\nThe dry soul is the wisest and best.\nMan, as a light at night, is lighted and extinguished.\nLiving and dead, awake and asleap, young and old, are the same. For these several states are transmutations of each other.\nTime is a child playing at draughts, a child's kingdom.\nI have inquired of myself.\nCorpses are more worthless than excrement.\nOne day is like all.\nA man's character is his daemon.\nThere awaits men after death what they neither hope nor think.\nAnd those that are there shall arise and become guardians of the living and the dead.\nWhatever it craves it buys with its life.\nIt pertains to all men to know themselves and to learn self-control.", "source": "life_and_death.txt"}
{"text": "It is wise for those who hear, not me, but the universal Reason, to confess that all things are one.\nTo this universal Reason which I unfold, although it always exists, men make themselves insensible, both before they have heard it and when they have heard it for the first time.\nFor notwithstanding that all things happen according to this Reason, men act as though they had never had any experience in regard to it.\nThose who hear and do not understand are like the deaf. Of them the proverb says: \"Present, they are absent.\"\nEyes and ears are bad witnesses to men having rude souls.\nThe majority of people have no understanding of the things with which they daily meet, nor, when instructed, do they have any right knowledge of them, although to themselves they seem to have.\nWhatever concerns seeing, hearing, and learning, I particularly honor.\nThe eyes are more exact witnesses than the ears.\nOf all whose words I have heard, no one attains to this, to know that wisdom is apart from all.\nThere is one wisdom, to understand the intelligent will by which all things are governed through all.\nThe Law of Understanding is common to all. Those who speak with intelligence must hold fast to that which is common to all, even more strongly than a city holds fast to its law.\nFor all human laws are dependent upon one divine Law, for this rules as far as it wills, and suffices for all, and overabounds.\nAlthough the Law of Reason is common, the majority of people live as though they had an understanding of their own.\nThey are at variance with that with which they are in most continual association.\nWe ought not to act and speak as though we were asleep.\nFor human nature does not possess understanding, but the divine does.\nThe thoughtless man understands the voice of the Deity as little as the child understands the man.", "source": "logos.txt"}
