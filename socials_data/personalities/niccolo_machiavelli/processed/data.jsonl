From 1494 to\n1512 held an official post at Florence which included diplomatic\nmissions to various European courts. Imprisoned in Florence, 1512;\nlater exiled and returned to San Casciano. Died at Florence on 22nd\nJune 1527._\nINTRODUCTION\nNicolo Machiavelli was born at Florence on 3rd May 1469. He was the\nsecond son of Bernardo di Nicolo Machiavelli, a lawyer of some repute,\nand of Bartolommea di Stefano Nelli, his wife. Both parents were\nmembers of the old Florentine nobility.\nHis life falls naturally into three periods, each of which singularly\nenough constitutes a distinct and important era in the history of\nFlorence. His youth was concurrent with the greatness of Florence as an\nItalian power under the guidance of Lorenzo de\u2019 Medici, Il Magnifico.\nThe downfall of the Medici in Florence occurred in 1494, in which year\nMachiavelli entered the public service. During his official career\nFlorence was free under the government of a Republic, which lasted\nuntil 1512, when the Medici returned to power, and Machiavelli lost his\noffice. The Medici again ruled Florence from 1512 until 1527, when they\nwere once more driven out. This was the period of Machiavelli\u2019s\nliterary activity and increasing influence; but he died, within a few\nweeks of the expulsion of the Medici, on 22nd June 1527, in his\nfifty-eighth year, without having regained office.\nYOUTH \u2014 \u00c6t. 1-25\u20141469-94\nAlthough there is little recorded of the youth of Machiavelli, the\nFlorence of those days is so well known that the early environment of\nthis representative citizen may be easily imagined. Florence has been\ndescribed as a city with two opposite currents of life, one directed by\nthe fervent and austere Savonarola, the other by the splendour-loving\nLorenzo. Savonarola\u2019s influence upon the young Machiavelli must have\nbeen slight, for although at one time he wielded immense power over the\nfortunes of Florence, he only furnished Machiavelli with a subject of a\ngibe in _The Prince_, where he is cited as an example of an unarmed\nprophet who came to a bad end. Whereas the magnificence of the Medicean\nrule during the life of Lorenzo appeared to have impressed Machiavelli\nstrongly, for he frequently recurs to it in his writings, and it is to\nLorenzo\u2019s grandson that he dedicates _The Prince_.\nMachiavelli, in his \u201cHistory of Florence,\u201d gives us a picture of the\nyoung men among whom his youth was passed. He writes: \u201cThey were freer\nthan their forefathers in dress and living, and spent more in other\nkinds of excesses, consuming their time and money in idleness, gaming,\nand women; their chief aim was to appear well dressed and to speak with\nwit and acuteness, whilst he who could wound others the most cleverly\nwas thought the wisest.\u201d In a letter to his son Guido, Machiavelli\nshows why youth should avail itself of its opportunities for study, and\nleads us to infer that his own youth had been so occupied. He writes:\n\u201cI have received your letter, which has given me the greatest pleasure,\nespecially because you tell me you are quite restored in health, than\nwhich I could have no better news; for if God grant life to you, and to\nme, I hope to make a good man of you if you are willing to do your\nshare.\u201d Then, writing of a new patron, he continues: \u201cThis will turn\nout well for you, but it is necessary for you to study; since, then,\nyou have no longer the excuse of illness, take pains to study letters\nand music, for you see what honour is done to me for the little skill I\nhave. Therefore, my son, if you wish to please me, and to bring success\nand honour to yourself, do right and study, because others will help\nyou if you help yourself.\u201d\nOFFICE \u2014 \u00c6t. 25-43\u20141494-1512\nThe second period of Machiavelli\u2019s life was spent in the service of the\nfree Republic of Florence, which flourished, as stated above, from the\nexpulsion of the Medici in 1494 until their return in 1512. After\nserving four years in one of the public offices he was appointed\nChancellor and Secretary to the Second Chancery, the Ten of Liberty and\nPeace. Here we are on firm ground when dealing with the events of\nMachiavelli\u2019s life, for during this time he took a leading part in the\naffairs of the Republic, and we have its decrees, records, and\ndispatches to guide us, as well as his own writings. A mere\nrecapitulation of a few of his transactions with the statesmen and\nsoldiers of his time gives a fair indication of his activities, and\nsupplies the sources from which he drew the experiences and characters\nwhich illustrate _The Prince_.\nHis first mission was in 1499 to Catherina Sforza, \u201cmy lady of Forli\u201d\nof _The Prince_, from whose conduct and fate he drew the moral that it\nis far better to earn the confidence of the people than to rely on\nfortresses. This is a very noticeable principle in Machiavelli, and is\nurged by him in many ways as a matter of vital importance to princes.\nIn 1500 he was sent to France to obtain terms from Louis XII for\ncontinuing the war against Pisa: this king it was who, in his conduct\nof affairs in Italy, committed the five capital errors in statecraft\nsummarized in _The Prince_, and was consequently driven out. He, also,\nit was who made the dissolution of his marriage a condition of support\nto Pope Alexander VI; which leads Machiavelli to refer those who urge\nthat such promises should be kept to what he has written concerning the\nfaith of princes.\nMachiavelli\u2019s public life was largely occupied with events arising out\nof the ambitions of Pope Alexander VI and his son, Cesare Borgia, the\nDuke Valentino, and these characters fill a large space of _The\nPrince_. Machiavelli never hesitates to cite the actions of the duke\nfor the benefit of usurpers who wish to keep the states they have\nseized; he can, indeed, find no precepts to offer so good as the\npattern of Cesare Borgia\u2019s conduct, insomuch that Cesare is acclaimed\nby some critics as the \u201chero\u201d of _The Prince_. Yet in _The Prince_ the\nduke is in point of fact cited as a type of the man who rises on the\nfortune of others, and falls with them; who takes every course that\nmight be expected from a prudent man but the course which will save\nhim; who is prepared for all eventualities but the one which happens;\nand who, when all his abilities fail to carry him through, exclaims\nthat it was not his fault, but an extraordinary and unforeseen\nfatality.\nOn the death of Pius III, in 1503, Machiavelli was sent to Rome to\nwatch the election of his successor, and there he saw Cesare Borgia\ncheated into allowing the choice of the College to fall on Giuliano\ndelle Rovere (Julius II), who was one of the cardinals that had most\nreason to fear the duke. Machiavelli, when commenting on this election,\nsays that he who thinks new favours will cause great personages to\nforget old injuries deceives himself. Julius did not rest until he had\nruined Cesare.\nIt was to Julius II that Machiavelli was sent in 1506, when that\npontiff was commencing his enterprise against Bologna; which he brought\nto a successful issue, as he did many of his other adventures, owing\nchiefly to his impetuous character. It is in reference to Pope Julius\nthat Machiavelli moralizes on the resemblance between Fortune and\nwomen, and concludes that it is the bold rather than the cautious man\nthat will win and hold them both.\nIt is impossible to follow here the varying fortunes of the Italian\nstates, which in 1507 were controlled by France, Spain, and Germany,\nwith results that have lasted to our day; we are concerned with those\nevents, and with the three great actors in them, so far only as they\nimpinge on the personality of Machiavelli. He had several meetings with\nLouis XII of France, and his estimate of that monarch\u2019s character has\nalready been alluded to. Machiavelli has painted Ferdinand of Aragon as\nthe man who accomplished great things under the cloak of religion, but\nwho in reality had no mercy, faith, humanity, or integrity; and who,\nhad he allowed himself to be influenced by such motives, would have\nbeen ruined. The Emperor Maximilian was one of the most interesting men\nof the age, and his character has been drawn by many hands; but\nMachiavelli, who was an envoy at his court in 1507-8, reveals the\nsecret of his many failures when he describes him as a secretive man,\nwithout force of character\u2014ignoring the human agencies necessary to\ncarry his schemes into effect, and never insisting on the fulfilment of\nhis wishes.\nThe remaining years of Machiavelli\u2019s official career were filled with\nevents arising out of the League of Cambrai, made in 1508 between the\nthree great European powers already mentioned and the pope, with the\nobject of crushing the Venetian Republic. This result was attained in\nthe battle of Vaila, when Venice lost in one day all that she had won\nin eight hundred years. Florence had a difficult part to play during\nthese events, complicated as they were by the feud which broke out\nbetween the pope and the French, because friendship with France had\ndictated the entire policy of the Republic. When, in 1511, Julius II\nfinally formed the Holy League against France, and with the assistance\nof the Swiss drove the French out of Italy, Florence lay at the mercy\nof the Pope, and had to submit to his terms, one of which was that the\nMedici should be restored. The return of the Medici to Florence on 1st\nSeptember 1512, and the consequent fall of the Republic, was the signal\nfor the dismissal of Machiavelli and his friends, and thus put an end\nto his public career, for, as we have seen, he died without regaining\noffice.\nLITERATURE AND DEATH \u2014 \u00c6t. 43-58\u20141512-27\nOn the return of the Medici, Machiavelli, who for a few weeks had\nvainly hoped to retain his office under the new masters of Florence,\nwas dismissed by decree dated 7th November 1512. Shortly after this he\nwas accused of complicity in an abortive conspiracy against the Medici,\nimprisoned, and put to the question by torture. The new Medicean pope,\nLeo X, procured his release, and he retired to his small property at\nSan Casciano, near Florence, where he devoted himself to literature. In\na letter to Francesco Vettori, dated 13th December 1513, he has left a\nvery interesting description of his life at this period, which\nelucidates his methods and his motives in writing _The Prince_. After\ndescribing his daily occupations with his family and neighbours, he\nwrites: \u201cThe evening being come, I return home and go to my study; at\nthe entrance I pull off my peasant-clothes, covered with dust and dirt,\nand put on my noble court dress, and thus becomingly re-clothed I pass\ninto the ancient courts of the men of old, where, being lovingly\nreceived by them, I am fed with that food which is mine alone; where I\ndo not hesitate to speak with them, and to ask for the reason of their\nactions, and they in their benignity answer me; and for four hours I\nfeel no weariness, I forget every trouble, poverty does not dismay,\ndeath does not terrify me; I am possessed entirely by those great men.\nAnd because Dante says:\nKnowledge doth come of learning well retained,\nUnfruitful else,\nI have noted down what I have gained from their conversation, and have\ncomposed a small work on \u2018Principalities,\u2019 where I pour myself out as\nfully as I can in meditation on the subject, discussing what a\nprincipality is, what kinds there are, how they can be acquired, how\nthey can be kept, why they are lost: and if any of my fancies ever\npleased you, this ought not to displease you: and to a prince,\nespecially to a new one, it should be welcome: therefore I dedicate it\nto his Magnificence Giuliano. Filippo Casavecchio has seen it; he will\nbe able to tell you what is in it, and of the discourses I have had\nwith him; nevertheless, I am still enriching and polishing it.\u201d\nThe \u201clittle book\u201d suffered many vicissitudes before attaining the form\nin which it has reached us. Various mental influences were at work\nduring its composition; its title and patron were changed; and for some\nunknown reason it was finally dedicated to Lorenzo de\u2019 Medici. Although\nMachiavelli discussed with Casavecchio whether it should be sent or\npresented in person to the patron, there is no evidence that Lorenzo\never received or even read it: he certainly never gave Machiavelli any\nemployment. Although it was plagiarized during Machiavelli\u2019s lifetime,\n_The Prince_ was never published by him, and its text is still\ndisputable.\nMachiavelli concludes his letter to Vettori thus: \u201cAnd as to this\nlittle thing [his book], when it has been read it will be seen that\nduring the fifteen years I have given to the study of statecraft I have\nneither slept nor idled; and men ought ever to desire to be served by\none who has reaped experience at the expense of others. And of my\nloyalty none could doubt, because having always kept faith I could not\nnow learn how to break it; for he who has been faithful and honest, as\nI have, cannot change his nature; and my poverty is a witness to my\nhonesty.\u201d\nBefore Machiavelli had got _The Prince_ off his hands he commenced his\n\u201cDiscourse on the First Decade of Titus Livius,\u201d which should be read\nconcurrently with _The Prince_. These and several minor works occupied\nhim until the year 1518, when he accepted a small commission to look\nafter the affairs of some Florentine merchants at Genoa. In 1519 the\nMedicean rulers of Florence granted a few political concessions to her\ncitizens, and Machiavelli with others was consulted upon a new\nconstitution under which the Great Council was to be restored; but on\none pretext or another it was not promulgated.\nIn 1520 the Florentine merchants again had recourse to Machiavelli to\nsettle their difficulties with Lucca, but this year was chiefly\nremarkable for his re-entry into Florentine literary society, where he\nwas much sought after, and also for the production of his \u201cArt of War.\u201d\nIt was in the same year that he received a commission at the instance\nof Cardinal de\u2019 Medici to write the \u201cHistory of Florence,\u201d a task which\noccupied him until 1525. His return to popular favour may have\ndetermined the Medici to give him this employment, for an old writer\nobserves that \u201can able statesman out of work, like a huge whale, will\nendeavour to overturn the ship unless he has an empty cask to play\nwith.\u201d\nWhen the \u201cHistory of Florence\u201d was finished, Machiavelli took it to\nRome for presentation to his patron, Giuliano de\u2019 Medici, who had in\nthe meanwhile become pope under the title of Clement VII. It is\nsomewhat remarkable that, as, in 1513, Machiavelli had written _The\nPrince_ for the instruction of the Medici after they had just regained\npower in Florence, so, in 1525, he dedicated the \u201cHistory of Florence\u201d\nto the head of the family when its ruin was now at hand. In that year\nthe battle of Pavia destroyed the French rule in Italy, and left\nFrancis I a prisoner in the hands of his great rival, Charles V. This\nwas followed by the sack of Rome, upon the news of which the popular\nparty at Florence threw off the yoke of the Medici, who were once more\nbanished.\nMachiavelli was absent from Florence at this time, but hastened his\nreturn, hoping to secure his former office of secretary to the \u201cTen of\nLiberty and Peace.\u201d Unhappily he was taken ill soon after he reached\nFlorence, where he died on 22nd June 1527.\nTHE MAN AND HIS WORKS\nNo one can say where the bones of Machiavelli rest, but modern Florence\nhas decreed him a stately cenotaph in Santa Croce, by the side of her\nmost famous sons; recognizing that, whatever other nations may have\nfound in his works, Italy found in them the idea of her unity and the\ngerms of her renaissance among the nations of Europe. Whilst it is idle\nto protest against the world-wide and evil signification of his name,\nit may be pointed out that the harsh construction of his doctrine which\nthis sinister reputation implies was unknown to his own day, and that\nthe researches of recent times have enabled us to interpret him more\nreasonably. It is due to these inquiries that the shape of an \u201cunholy\nnecromancer,\u201d which so long haunted men\u2019s vision, has begun to fade.\nMachiavelli was undoubtedly a man of great observation, acuteness, and\nindustry; noting with appreciative eye whatever passed before him, and\nwith his supreme literary gift turning it to account in his enforced\nretirement from affairs. He does not present himself, nor is he\ndepicted by his contemporaries, as a type of that rare combination, the\nsuccessful statesman and author, for he appears to have been only\nmoderately prosperous in his several embassies and political\nemployments. He was misled by Catherina Sforza, ignored by Louis XII,\noverawed by Cesare Borgia; several of his embassies were quite barren\nof results; his attempts to fortify Florence failed, and the soldiery\nthat he raised astonished everybody by their cowardice. In the conduct\nof his own affairs he was timid and time-serving; he dared not appear\nby the side of Soderini, to whom he owed so much, for fear of\ncompromising himself; his connection with the Medici was open to\nsuspicion, and Giuliano appears to have recognized his real forte when\nhe set him to write the \u201cHistory of Florence,\u201d rather than employ him\nin the state. And it is on the literary side of his character, and\nthere alone, that we find no weakness and no failure.\nAlthough the light of almost four centuries has been focused on _The\nPrince_, its problems are still debatable and interesting, because they\nare the eternal problems between the ruled and their rulers. Such as\nthey are, its ethics are those of Machiavelli\u2019s contemporaries; yet\nthey cannot be said to be out of date so long as the governments of\nEurope rely on material rather than on moral forces. Its historical\nincidents and personages become interesting by reason of the uses which\nMachiavelli makes of them to illustrate his theories of government and\nconduct.\nLeaving out of consideration those maxims of state which still furnish\nsome European and eastern statesmen with principles of action, _The\nPrince_ is bestrewn with truths that can be proved at every turn. Men\nare still the dupes of their simplicity and greed, as they were in the\ndays of Alexander VI. The cloak of religion still conceals the vices\nwhich Machiavelli laid bare in the character of Ferdinand of Aragon.\nMen will not look at things as they really are, but as they wish them\nto be\u2014and are ruined. In politics there are no perfectly safe courses;\nprudence consists in choosing the least dangerous ones. Then\u2014to pass to\na higher plane\u2014Machiavelli reiterates that, although crimes may win an\nempire, they do not win glory. Necessary wars are just wars, and the\narms of a nation are hallowed when it has no other resource but to\nfight.\nIt is the cry of a far later day than Machiavelli\u2019s that government\nshould be elevated into a living moral force, capable of inspiring the\npeople with a just recognition of the fundamental principles of\nsociety; to this \u201chigh argument\u201d _The Prince_ contributes but little.\nMachiavelli always refused to write either of men or of governments\notherwise than as he found them, and he writes with such skill and\ninsight that his work is of abiding value. But what invests _The\nPrince_ with more than a merely artistic or historical interest is the\nincontrovertible truth that it deals with the great principles which\nstill guide nations and rulers in their relationship with each other\nand their neighbours.\nIn translating _The Prince_ my aim has been to achieve at all costs an\nexact literal rendering of the original, rather than a fluent\nparaphrase adapted to the modern notions of style and expression.\nMachiavelli was no facile phrasemonger; the conditions under which he\nwrote obliged him to weigh every word; his themes were lofty, his\nsubstance grave, his manner nobly plain and serious. _Quis eo fuit\nunquam in partiundis rebus, in definiendis, in explanandis pressior?_\nIn _The Prince_, it may be truly said, there is reason assignable, not\nonly for every word, but for the position of every word. To an\nEnglishman of Shakespeare\u2019s time the translation of such a treatise was\nin some ways a comparatively easy task, for in those times the genius\nof the English more nearly resembled that of the Italian language; to\nthe Englishman of to-day it is not so simple. To take a single example:\nthe word _intrattenere_, employed by Machiavelli to indicate the policy\nadopted by the Roman Senate towards the weaker states of Greece, would\nby an Elizabethan be correctly rendered \u201centertain,\u201d and every\ncontemporary reader would understand what was meant by saying that\n\u201cRome _entertained_ the \u00c6tolians and the Achaeans without augmenting\ntheir power.\u201d But to-day such a phrase would seem obsolete and\nambiguous, if not unmeaning: we are compelled to say that \u201c_Rome\nmaintained friendly relations with the \u00c6tolians_,\u201d etc., using four\nwords to do the work of one. I have tried to preserve the pithy brevity\nof the Italian so far as was consistent with an absolute fidelity to\nthe sense. If the result be an occasional asperity I can only hope that\nthe reader, in his eagerness to reach the author\u2019s meaning, may\noverlook the roughness of the road that leads him to it.\nThe following is a list of the works of Machiavelli:\nPrincipal works.

And if your\nMagnificence from the summit of your greatness will sometimes turn your\neyes to these lower regions, you will see how unmeritedly I suffer a\ngreat and continued malignity of fortune.\nTHE PRINCE\nCHAPTER I.\nHOW MANY KINDS OF PRINCIPALITIES THERE ARE, AND BY WHAT MEANS THEY ARE\nACQUIRED\nAll states, all powers, that have held and hold rule over men have been\nand are either republics or principalities.\nPrincipalities are either hereditary, in which the family has been long\nestablished; or they are new.\nThe new are either entirely new, as was Milan to Francesco Sforza, or\nthey are, as it were, members annexed to the hereditary state of the\nprince who has acquired them, as was the kingdom of Naples to that of\nthe King of Spain.\nSuch dominions thus acquired are either accustomed to live under a\nprince, or to live in freedom; and are acquired either by the arms of\nthe prince himself, or of others, or else by fortune or by ability.\nCHAPTER II.\nCONCERNING HEREDITARY PRINCIPALITIES\nI will leave out all discussion on republics, inasmuch as in another\nplace I have written of them at length, and will address myself only to\nprincipalities. In doing so I will keep to the order indicated above,\nand discuss how such principalities are to be ruled and preserved.\nI say at once there are fewer difficulties in holding hereditary\nstates, and those long accustomed to the family of their prince, than\nnew ones; for it is sufficient only not to transgress the customs of\nhis ancestors, and to deal prudently with circumstances as they arise,\nfor a prince of average powers to maintain himself in his state, unless\nhe be deprived of it by some extraordinary and excessive force; and if\nhe should be so deprived of it, whenever anything sinister happens to\nthe usurper, he will regain it.\nWe have in Italy, for example, the Duke of Ferrara, who could not have\nwithstood the attacks of the Venetians in \u201984, nor those of Pope Julius\nin \u201910, unless he had been long established in his dominions. For the\nhereditary prince has less cause and less necessity to offend; hence it\nhappens that he will be more loved; and unless extraordinary vices\ncause him to be hated, it is reasonable to expect that his subjects\nwill be naturally well disposed towards him; and in the antiquity and\nduration of his rule the memories and motives that make for change are\nlost, for one change always leaves the toothing for another.\nCHAPTER III.\nCONCERNING MIXED PRINCIPALITIES\nBut the difficulties occur in a new principality. And firstly, if it be\nnot entirely new, but is, as it were, a member of a state which, taken\ncollectively, may be called composite, the changes arise chiefly from\nan inherent difficulty which there is in all new principalities; for\nmen change their rulers willingly, hoping to better themselves, and\nthis hope induces them to take up arms against him who rules: wherein\nthey are deceived, because they afterwards find by experience they have\ngone from bad to worse. This follows also on another natural and common\nnecessity, which always causes a new prince to burden those who have\nsubmitted to him with his soldiery and with infinite other hardships\nwhich he must put upon his new acquisition.\nIn this way you have enemies in all those whom you have injured in\nseizing that principality, and you are not able to keep those friends\nwho put you there because of your not being able to satisfy them in the\nway they expected, and you cannot take strong measures against them,\nfeeling bound to them. For, although one may be very strong in armed\nforces, yet in entering a province one has always need of the goodwill\nof the natives.\nFor these reasons Louis the Twelfth, King of France, quickly occupied\nMilan, and as quickly lost it; and to turn him out the first time it\nonly needed Lodovico\u2019s own forces; because those who had opened the\ngates to him, finding themselves deceived in their hopes of future\nbenefit, would not endure the ill-treatment of the new prince. It is\nvery true that, after acquiring rebellious provinces a second time,\nthey are not so lightly lost afterwards, because the prince, with\nlittle reluctance, takes the opportunity of the rebellion to punish the\ndelinquents, to clear out the suspects, and to strengthen himself in\nthe weakest places. Thus to cause France to lose Milan the first time\nit was enough for the Duke Lodovico[1] to raise insurrections on the\nborders; but to cause him to lose it a second time it was necessary to\nbring the whole world against him, and that his armies should be\ndefeated and driven out of Italy; which followed from the causes above\nmentioned.\n[1] Duke Lodovico was Lodovico Moro, a son of Francesco Sforza, who\nmarried Beatrice d\u2019Este. He ruled over Milan from 1494 to 1500, and\ndied in 1510.\nNevertheless Milan was taken from France both the first and the second\ntime. The general reasons for the first have been discussed; it remains\nto name those for the second, and to see what resources he had, and\nwhat any one in his situation would have had for maintaining himself\nmore securely in his acquisition than did the King of France.\nNow I say that those dominions which, when acquired, are added to an\nancient state by him who acquires them, are either of the same country\nand language, or they are not. When they are, it is easier to hold\nthem, especially when they have not been accustomed to self-government;\nand to hold them securely it is enough to have destroyed the family of\nthe prince who was ruling them; because the two peoples, preserving in\nother things the old conditions, and not being unlike in customs, will\nlive quietly together, as one has seen in Brittany, Burgundy, Gascony,\nand Normandy, which have been bound to France for so long a time: and,\nalthough there may be some difference in language, nevertheless the\ncustoms are alike, and the people will easily be able to get on amongst\nthemselves. He who has annexed them, if he wishes to hold them, has\nonly to bear in mind two considerations: the one, that the family of\ntheir former lord is extinguished; the other, that neither their laws\nnor their taxes are altered, so that in a very short time they will\nbecome entirely one body with the old principality.\nBut when states are acquired in a country differing in language,\ncustoms, or laws, there are difficulties, and good fortune and great\nenergy are needed to hold them, and one of the greatest and most real\nhelps would be that he who has acquired them should go and reside\nthere. This would make his position more secure and durable, as it has\nmade that of the Turk in Greece, who, notwithstanding all the other\nmeasures taken by him for holding that state, if he had not settled\nthere, would not have been able to keep it. Because, if one is on the\nspot, disorders are seen as they spring up, and one can quickly remedy\nthem; but if one is not at hand, they are heard of only when they are\ngreat, and then one can no longer remedy them. Besides this, the\ncountry is not pillaged by your officials; the subjects are satisfied\nby prompt recourse to the prince; thus, wishing to be good, they have\nmore cause to love him, and wishing to be otherwise, to fear him. He\nwho would attack that state from the outside must have the utmost\ncaution; as long as the prince resides there it can only be wrested\nfrom him with the greatest difficulty.\nThe other and better course is to send colonies to one or two places,\nwhich may be as keys to that state, for it is necessary either to do\nthis or else to keep there a great number of cavalry and infantry. A\nprince does not spend much on colonies, for with little or no expense\nhe can send them out and keep them there, and he offends a minority\nonly of the citizens from whom he takes lands and houses to give them\nto the new inhabitants; and those whom he offends, remaining poor and\nscattered, are never able to injure him; whilst the rest being\nuninjured are easily kept quiet, and at the same time are anxious not\nto err for fear it should happen to them as it has to those who have\nbeen despoiled. In conclusion, I say that these colonies are not\ncostly, they are more faithful, they injure less, and the injured, as\nhas been said, being poor and scattered, cannot hurt. Upon this, one\nhas to remark that men ought either to be well treated or crushed,\nbecause they can avenge themselves of lighter injuries, of more serious\nones they cannot; therefore the injury that is to be done to a man\nought to be of such a kind that one does not stand in fear of revenge.\nBut in maintaining armed men there in place of colonies one spends much\nmore, having to consume on the garrison all the income from the state,\nso that the acquisition turns into a loss, and many more are\nexasperated, because the whole state is injured; through the shifting\nof the garrison up and down all become acquainted with hardship, and\nall become hostile, and they are enemies who, whilst beaten on their\nown ground, are yet able to do hurt. For every reason, therefore, such\nguards are as useless as a colony is useful.\nAgain, the prince who holds a country differing in the above respects\nought to make himself the head and defender of his less powerful\nneighbours, and to weaken the more powerful amongst them, taking care\nthat no foreigner as powerful as himself shall, by any accident, get a\nfooting there; for it will always happen that such a one will be\nintroduced by those who are discontented, either through excess of\nambition or through fear, as one has seen already. The Romans were\nbrought into Greece by the \u00c6tolians; and in every other country where\nthey obtained a footing they were brought in by the inhabitants. And\nthe usual course of affairs is that, as soon as a powerful foreigner\nenters a country, all the subject states are drawn to him, moved by the\nhatred which they feel against the ruling power. So that in respect to\nthose subject states he has not to take any trouble to gain them over\nto himself, for the whole of them quickly rally to the state which he\nhas acquired there. He has only to take care that they do not get hold\nof too much power and too much authority, and then with his own forces,\nand with their goodwill, he can easily keep down the more powerful of\nthem, so as to remain entirely master in the country. And he who does\nnot properly manage this business will soon lose what he has acquired,\nand whilst he does hold it he will have endless difficulties and\ntroubles.\nThe Romans, in the countries which they annexed, observed closely these\nmeasures; they sent colonies and maintained friendly relations with[2]\nthe minor powers, without increasing their strength; they kept down the\ngreater, and did not allow any strong foreign powers to gain authority.\nGreece appears to me sufficient for an example. The Achaeans and\n\u00c6tolians were kept friendly by them, the kingdom of Macedonia was\nhumbled, Antiochus was driven out; yet the merits of the Achaeans and\n\u00c6tolians never secured for them permission to increase their power, nor\ndid the persuasions of Philip ever induce the Romans to be his friends\nwithout first humbling him, nor did the influence of Antiochus make\nthem agree that he should retain any lordship over the country. Because\nthe Romans did in these instances what all prudent princes ought to do,\nwho have to regard not only present troubles, but also future ones, for\nwhich they must prepare with every energy, because, when foreseen, it\nis easy to remedy them; but if you wait until they approach, the\nmedicine is no longer in time because the malady has become incurable;\nfor it happens in this, as the physicians say it happens in hectic\nfever, that in the beginning of the malady it is easy to cure but\ndifficult to detect, but in the course of time, not having been either\ndetected or treated in the beginning, it becomes easy to detect but\ndifficult to cure. Thus it happens in affairs of state, for when the\nevils that arise have been foreseen (which it is only given to a wise\nman to see), they can be quickly redressed, but when, through not\nhaving been foreseen, they have been permitted to grow in a way that\nevery one can see them, there is no longer a remedy. Therefore, the\nRomans, foreseeing troubles, dealt with them at once, and, even to\navoid a war, would not let them come to a head, for they knew that war\nis not to be avoided, but is only to be put off to the advantage of\nothers; moreover they wished to fight with Philip and Antiochus in\nGreece so as not to have to do it in Italy; they could have avoided\nboth, but this they did not wish; nor did that ever please them which\nis forever in the mouths of the wise ones of our time:\u2014Let us enjoy the\nbenefits of the time\u2014but rather the benefits of their own valour and\nprudence, for time drives everything before it, and is able to bring\nwith it good as well as evil, and evil as well as good.\n[2] See remark in the introduction on the word \u201cintrattenere.\u201d\nBut let us turn to France and inquire whether she has done any of the\nthings mentioned. I will speak of Louis[3] (and not of Charles)[4] as\nthe one whose conduct is the better to be observed, he having held\npossession of Italy for the longest period; and you will see that he\nhas done the opposite to those things which ought to be done to retain\na state composed of divers elements.\n[3] Louis XII, King of France, \u201cThe Father of the People,\u201d born 1462,\ndied 1515.\n[4] Charles VIII, King of France, born 1470, died 1498.\nKing Louis was brought into Italy by the ambition of the Venetians, who\ndesired to obtain half the state of Lombardy by his intervention. I\nwill not blame the course taken by the king, because, wishing to get a\nfoothold in Italy, and having no friends there\u2014seeing rather that every\ndoor was shut to him owing to the conduct of Charles\u2014he was forced to\naccept those friendships which he could get, and he would have\nsucceeded very quickly in his design if in other matters he had not\nmade some mistakes. The king, however, having acquired Lombardy,\nregained at once the authority which Charles had lost: Genoa yielded;\nthe Florentines became his friends; the Marquess of Mantua, the Duke of\nFerrara, the Bentivogli, my lady of Forli, the Lords of Faenza, of\nPesaro, of Rimini, of Camerino, of Piombino, the Lucchese, the Pisans,\nthe Sienese\u2014everybody made advances to him to become his friend. Then\ncould the Venetians realize the rashness of the course taken by them,\nwhich, in order that they might secure two towns in Lombardy, had made\nthe king master of two-thirds of Italy.\nLet any one now consider with what little difficulty the king could\nhave maintained his position in Italy had he observed the rules above\nlaid down, and kept all his friends secure and protected; for although\nthey were numerous they were both weak and timid, some afraid of the\nChurch, some of the Venetians, and thus they would always have been\nforced to stand in with him, and by their means he could easily have\nmade himself secure against those who remained powerful. But he was no\nsooner in Milan than he did the contrary by assisting Pope Alexander to\noccupy the Romagna. It never occurred to him that by this action he was\nweakening himself, depriving himself of friends and of those who had\nthrown themselves into his lap, whilst he aggrandized the Church by\nadding much temporal power to the spiritual, thus giving it greater\nauthority. And having committed this prime error, he was obliged to\nfollow it up, so much so that, to put an end to the ambition of\nAlexander, and to prevent his becoming the master of Tuscany, he was\nhimself forced to come into Italy.\nAnd as if it were not enough to have aggrandized the Church, and\ndeprived himself of friends, he, wishing to have the kingdom of Naples,\ndivided it with the King of Spain, and where he was the prime arbiter\nin Italy he takes an associate, so that the ambitious of that country\nand the malcontents of his own should have somewhere to shelter; and\nwhereas he could have left in the kingdom his own pensioner as king, he\ndrove him out, to put one there who was able to drive him, Louis, out\nin turn.\nThe wish to acquire is in truth very natural and common, and men always\ndo so when they can, and for this they will be praised not blamed; but\nwhen they cannot do so, yet wish to do so by any means, then there is\nfolly and blame. Therefore, if France could have attacked Naples with\nher own forces she ought to have done so; if she could not, then she\nought not to have divided it. And if the partition which she made with\nthe Venetians in Lombardy was justified by the excuse that by it she\ngot a foothold in Italy, this other partition merited blame, for it had\nnot the excuse of that necessity.\nTherefore Louis made these five errors: he destroyed the minor powers,\nhe increased the strength of one of the greater powers in Italy, he\nbrought in a foreign power, he did not settle in the country, he did\nnot send colonies. Which errors, had he lived, were not enough to\ninjure him had he not made a sixth by taking away their dominions from\nthe Venetians; because, had he not aggrandized the Church, nor brought\nSpain into Italy, it would have been very reasonable and necessary to\nhumble them; but having first taken these steps, he ought never to have\nconsented to their ruin, for they, being powerful, would always have\nkept off others from designs on Lombardy, to which the Venetians would\nnever have consented except to become masters themselves there; also\nbecause the others would not wish to take Lombardy from France in order\nto give it to the Venetians, and to run counter to both they would not\nhave had the courage.\nAnd if any one should say: \u201cKing Louis yielded the Romagna to Alexander\nand the kingdom to Spain to avoid war,\u201d I answer for the reasons given\nabove that a blunder ought never to be perpetrated to avoid war,\nbecause it is not to be avoided, but is only deferred to your\ndisadvantage. And if another should allege the pledge which the king\nhad given to the Pope that he would assist him in the enterprise, in\nexchange for the dissolution of his marriage[5] and for the cap to\nRouen,[6] to that I reply what I shall write later on concerning the\nfaith of princes, and how it ought to be kept.\n[5] Louis XII divorced his wife, Jeanne, daughter of Louis XI, and\nmarried in 1499 Anne of Brittany, widow of Charles VIII, in order to\nretain the Duchy of Brittany for the crown.\n[6] The Archbishop of Rouen. He was Georges d\u2019Amboise, created a\ncardinal by Alexander VI. Born 1460, died 1510.\nThus King Louis lost Lombardy by not having followed any of the\nconditions observed by those who have taken possession of countries and\nwished to retain them. Nor is there any miracle in this, but much that\nis reasonable and quite natural. And on these matters I spoke at Nantes\nwith Rouen, when Valentino, as Cesare Borgia, the son of Pope\nAlexander, was usually called, occupied the Romagna, and on Cardinal\nRouen observing to me that the Italians did not understand war, I\nreplied to him that the French did not understand statecraft, meaning\nthat otherwise they would not have allowed the Church to reach such\ngreatness. And in fact it has been seen that the greatness of the\nChurch and of Spain in Italy has been caused by France, and her ruin\nmay be attributed to them. From this a general rule is drawn which\nnever or rarely fails: that he who is the cause of another becoming\npowerful is ruined; because that predominancy has been brought about\neither by astuteness or else by force, and both are distrusted by him\nwho has been raised to power.\nCHAPTER IV.\nWHY THE KINGDOM OF DARIUS, CONQUERED BY ALEXANDER, DID NOT REBEL\nAGAINST THE SUCCESSORS OF ALEXANDER AT HIS DEATH\nConsidering the difficulties which men have had to hold to a newly\nacquired state, some might wonder how, seeing that Alexander the Great\nbecame the master of Asia in a few years, and died whilst it was\nscarcely settled (whence it might appear reasonable that the whole\nempire would have rebelled), nevertheless his successors maintained\nthemselves, and had to meet no other difficulty than that which arose\namong themselves from their own ambitions.\nI answer that the principalities of which one has record are found to\nbe governed in two different ways; either by a prince, with a body of\nservants, who assist him to govern the kingdom as ministers by his\nfavour and permission; or by a prince and barons, who hold that dignity\nby antiquity of blood and not by the grace of the prince. Such barons\nhave states and their own subjects, who recognize them as lords and\nhold them in natural affection. Those states that are governed by a\nprince and his servants hold their prince in more consideration,\nbecause in all the country there is no one who is recognized as\nsuperior to him, and if they yield obedience to another they do it as\nto a minister and official, and they do not bear him any particular\naffection.\nThe examples of these two governments in our time are the Turk and the\nKing of France. The entire monarchy of the Turk is governed by one\nlord, the others are his servants; and, dividing his kingdom into\nsanjaks, he sends there different administrators, and shifts and\nchanges them as he chooses. But the King of France is placed in the\nmidst of an ancient body of lords, acknowledged by their own subjects,\nand beloved by them; they have their own prerogatives, nor can the king\ntake these away except at his peril. Therefore, he who considers both\nof these states will recognize great difficulties in seizing the state\nof the Turk, but, once it is conquered, great ease in holding it. The\ncauses of the difficulties in seizing the kingdom of the Turk are that\nthe usurper cannot be called in by the princes of the kingdom, nor can\nhe hope to be assisted in his designs by the revolt of those whom the\nlord has around him. This arises from the reasons given above; for his\nministers, being all slaves and bondmen, can only be corrupted with\ngreat difficulty, and one can expect little advantage from them when\nthey have been corrupted, as they cannot carry the people with them,\nfor the reasons assigned. Hence, he who attacks the Turk must bear in\nmind that he will find him united, and he will have to rely more on his\nown strength than on the revolt of others; but, if once the Turk has\nbeen conquered, and routed in the field in such a way that he cannot\nreplace his armies, there is nothing to fear but the family of this\nprince, and, this being exterminated, there remains no one to fear, the\nothers having no credit with the people; and as the conqueror did not\nrely on them before his victory, so he ought not to fear them after it.\nThe contrary happens in kingdoms governed like that of France, because\none can easily enter there by gaining over some baron of the kingdom,\nfor one always finds malcontents and such as desire a change. Such men,\nfor the reasons given, can open the way into the state and render the\nvictory easy; but if you wish to hold it afterwards, you meet with\ninfinite difficulties, both from those who have assisted you and from\nthose you have crushed. Nor is it enough for you to have exterminated\nthe family of the prince, because the lords that remain make themselves\nthe heads of fresh movements against you, and as you are unable either\nto satisfy or exterminate them, that state is lost whenever time brings\nthe opportunity.\nNow if you will consider what was the nature of the government of\nDarius, you will find it similar to the kingdom of the Turk, and\ntherefore it was only necessary for Alexander, first to overthrow him\nin the field, and then to take the country from him. After which\nvictory, Darius being killed, the state remained secure to Alexander,\nfor the above reasons. And if his successors had been united they would\nhave enjoyed it securely and at their ease, for there were no tumults\nraised in the kingdom except those they provoked themselves.\nBut it is impossible to hold with such tranquillity states constituted\nlike that of France. Hence arose those frequent rebellions against the\nRomans in Spain, France, and Greece, owing to the many principalities\nthere were in these states, of which, as long as the memory of them\nendured, the Romans always held an insecure possession; but with the\npower and long continuance of the empire the memory of them passed\naway, and the Romans then became secure possessors. And when fighting\nafterwards amongst themselves, each one was able to attach to himself\nhis own parts of the country, according to the authority he had assumed\nthere; and the family of the former lord being exterminated, none other\nthan the Romans were acknowledged.\nWhen these things are remembered no one will marvel at the ease with\nwhich Alexander held the Empire of Asia, or at the difficulties which\nothers have had to keep an acquisition, such as Pyrrhus and many more;\nthis is not occasioned by the little or abundance of ability in the\nconqueror, but by the want of uniformity in the subject state.\nCHAPTER V.\nCONCERNING THE WAY TO GOVERN CITIES OR PRINCIPALITIES WHICH LIVED UNDER\nTHEIR OWN LAWS BEFORE THEY WERE ANNEXED\nWhenever those states which have been acquired as stated have been\naccustomed to live under their own laws and in freedom, there are three\ncourses for those who wish to hold them: the first is to ruin them, the\nnext is to reside there in person, the third is to permit them to live\nunder their own laws, drawing a tribute, and establishing within it an\noligarchy which will keep it friendly to you. Because such a\ngovernment, being created by the prince, knows that it cannot stand\nwithout his friendship and interest, and does its utmost to support\nhim; and therefore he who would keep a city accustomed to freedom will\nhold it more easily by the means of its own citizens than in any other\nway.\nThere are, for example, the Spartans and the Romans. The Spartans held\nAthens and Thebes, establishing there an oligarchy: nevertheless they\nlost them. The Romans, in order to hold Capua, Carthage, and Numantia,\ndismantled them, and did not lose them. They wished to hold Greece as\nthe Spartans held it, making it free and permitting its laws, and did\nnot succeed. So to hold it they were compelled to dismantle many cities\nin the country, for in truth there is no safe way to retain them\notherwise than by ruining them. And he who becomes master of a city\naccustomed to freedom and does not destroy it, may expect to be\ndestroyed by it, for in rebellion it has always the watchword of\nliberty and its ancient privileges as a rallying point, which neither\ntime nor benefits will ever cause it to forget. And whatever you may do\nor provide against, they never forget that name or their privileges\nunless they are disunited or dispersed, but at every chance they\nimmediately rally to them, as Pisa after the hundred years she had been\nheld in bondage by the Florentines.\nBut when cities or countries are accustomed to live under a prince, and\nhis family is exterminated, they, being on the one hand accustomed to\nobey and on the other hand not having the old prince, cannot agree in\nmaking one from amongst themselves, and they do not know how to govern\nthemselves. For this reason they are very slow to take up arms, and a\nprince can gain them to himself and secure them much more easily. But\nin republics there is more vitality, greater hatred, and more desire\nfor vengeance, which will never permit them to allow the memory of\ntheir former liberty to rest; so that the safest way is to destroy them\nor to reside there.\nCHAPTER VI.\nCONCERNING NEW PRINCIPALITIES WHICH ARE ACQUIRED BY ONE\u2019S OWN ARMS AND\nABILITY\nLet no one be surprised if, in speaking of entirely new principalities\nas I shall do, I adduce the highest examples both of prince and of\nstate; because men, walking almost always in paths beaten by others,\nand following by imitation their deeds, are yet unable to keep entirely\nto the ways of others or attain to the power of those they imitate. A\nwise man ought always to follow the paths beaten by great men, and to\nimitate those who have been supreme, so that if his ability does not\nequal theirs, at least it will savour of it. Let him act like the\nclever archers who, designing to hit the mark which yet appears too far\ndistant, and knowing the limits to which the strength of their bow\nattains, take aim much higher than the mark, not to reach by their\nstrength or arrow to so great a height, but to be able with the aid of\nso high an aim to hit the mark they wish to reach.\nI say, therefore, that in entirely new principalities, where there is a\nnew prince, more or less difficulty is found in keeping them,\naccordingly as there is more or less ability in him who has acquired\nthe state. Now, as the fact of becoming a prince from a private station\npresupposes either ability or fortune, it is clear that one or other of\nthese things will mitigate in some degree many difficulties.\nNevertheless, he who has relied least on fortune is established the\nstrongest. Further, it facilitates matters when the prince, having no\nother state, is compelled to reside there in person.\nBut to come to those who, by their own ability and not through fortune,\nhave risen to be princes, I say that Moses, Cyrus, Romulus, Theseus,\nand such like are the most excellent examples. And although one may not\ndiscuss Moses, he having been a mere executor of the will of God, yet\nhe ought to be admired, if only for that favour which made him worthy\nto speak with God. But in considering Cyrus and others who have\nacquired or founded kingdoms, all will be found admirable; and if their\nparticular deeds and conduct shall be considered, they will not be\nfound inferior to those of Moses, although he had so great a preceptor.\nAnd in examining their actions and lives one cannot see that they owed\nanything to fortune beyond opportunity, which brought them the material\nto mould into the form which seemed best to them. Without that\nopportunity their powers of mind would have been extinguished, and\nwithout those powers the opportunity would have come in vain.\nIt was necessary, therefore, to Moses that he should find the people of\nIsrael in Egypt enslaved and oppressed by the Egyptians, in order that\nthey should be disposed to follow him so as to be delivered out of\nbondage. It was necessary that Romulus should not remain in Alba, and\nthat he should be abandoned at his birth, in order that he should\nbecome King of Rome and founder of the fatherland. It was necessary\nthat Cyrus should find the Persians discontented with the government of\nthe Medes, and the Medes soft and effeminate through their long peace.\nTheseus could not have shown his ability had he not found the Athenians\ndispersed. These opportunities, therefore, made those men fortunate,\nand their high ability enabled them to recognize the opportunity\nwhereby their country was ennobled and made famous.\nThose who by valorous ways become princes, like these men, acquire a\nprincipality with difficulty, but they keep it with ease. The\ndifficulties they have in acquiring it rise in part from the new rules\nand methods which they are forced to introduce to establish their\ngovernment and its security. And it ought to be remembered that there\nis nothing more difficult to take in hand, more perilous to conduct, or\nmore uncertain in its success, than to take the lead in the\nintroduction of a new order of things, because the innovator has for\nenemies all those who have done well under the old conditions, and\nlukewarm defenders in those who may do well under the new. This\ncoolness arises partly from fear of the opponents, who have the laws on\ntheir side, and partly from the incredulity of men, who do not readily\nbelieve in new things until they have had a long experience of them.\nThus it happens that whenever those who are hostile have the\nopportunity to attack they do it like partisans, whilst the others\ndefend lukewarmly, in such wise that the prince is endangered along\nwith them.\nIt is necessary, therefore, if we desire to discuss this matter\nthoroughly, to inquire whether these innovators can rely on themselves\nor have to depend on others: that is to say, whether, to consummate\ntheir enterprise, have they to use prayers or can they use force? In\nthe first instance they always succeed badly, and never compass\nanything; but when they can rely on themselves and use force, then they\nare rarely endangered. Hence it is that all armed prophets have\nconquered, and the unarmed ones have been destroyed. Besides the\nreasons mentioned, the nature of the people is variable, and whilst it\nis easy to persuade them, it is difficult to fix them in that\npersuasion. And thus it is necessary to take such measures that, when\nthey believe no longer, it may be possible to make them believe by\nforce.\nIf Moses, Cyrus, Theseus, and Romulus had been unarmed they could not\nhave enforced their constitutions for long\u2014as happened in our time to\nFra Girolamo Savonarola, who was ruined with his new order of things\nimmediately the multitude believed in him no longer, and he had no\nmeans of keeping steadfast those who believed or of making the\nunbelievers to believe. Therefore such as these have great difficulties\nin consummating their enterprise, for all their dangers are in the\nascent, yet with ability they will overcome them; but when these are\novercome, and those who envied them their success are exterminated,\nthey will begin to be respected, and they will continue afterwards\npowerful, secure, honoured, and happy.\nTo these great examples I wish to add a lesser one; still it bears some\nresemblance to them, and I wish it to suffice me for all of a like\nkind: it is Hiero the Syracusan.[1] This man rose from a private\nstation to be Prince of Syracuse, nor did he, either, owe anything to\nfortune but opportunity; for the Syracusans, being oppressed, chose him\nfor their captain, afterwards he was rewarded by being made their\nprince. He was of so great ability, even as a private citizen, that one\nwho writes of him says he wanted nothing but a kingdom to be a king.\nThis man abolished the old soldiery, organized the new, gave up old\nalliances, made new ones; and as he had his own soldiers and allies, on\nsuch foundations he was able to build any edifice: thus, whilst he had\nendured much trouble in acquiring, he had but little in keeping.\n[1] Hiero II, born about 307 B.C., died 216 B.C.\nCHAPTER VII.\nCONCERNING NEW PRINCIPALITIES WHICH ARE ACQUIRED EITHER BY THE ARMS OF\nOTHERS OR BY GOOD FORTUNE\nThose who solely by good fortune become princes from being private\ncitizens have little trouble in rising, but much in keeping atop; they\nhave not any difficulties on the way up, because they fly, but they\nhave many when they reach the summit. Such are those to whom some state\nis given either for money or by the favour of him who bestows it; as\nhappened to many in Greece, in the cities of Ionia and of the\nHellespont, where princes were made by Darius, in order that they might\nhold the cities both for his security and his glory; as also were those\nemperors who, by the corruption of the soldiers, from being citizens\ncame to empire. Such stand simply elevated upon the goodwill and the\nfortune of him who has elevated them\u2014two most inconstant and unstable\nthings. Neither have they the knowledge requisite for the position;\nbecause, unless they are men of great worth and ability, it is not\nreasonable to expect that they should know how to command, having\nalways lived in a private condition; besides, they cannot hold it\nbecause they have not forces which they can keep friendly and faithful.\nStates that rise unexpectedly, then, like all other things in nature\nwhich are born and grow rapidly, cannot leave their foundations and\ncorrespondencies[1] fixed in such a way that the first storm will not\noverthrow them; unless, as is said, those who unexpectedly become\nprinces are men of so much ability that they know they have to be\nprepared at once to hold that which fortune has thrown into their laps,\nand that those foundations, which others have laid _before_ they became\nprinces, they must lay _afterwards_.\n[1] \u201cLe radici e corrispondenze,\u201d their roots (i.e. foundations) and\ncorrespondencies or relations with other states\u2014a common meaning of\n\u201ccorrespondence\u201d and \u201ccorrespondency\u201d in the sixteenth and seventeenth\ncenturies.\nConcerning these two methods of rising to be a prince by ability or\nfortune, I wish to adduce two examples within our own recollection, and\nthese are Francesco Sforza[2] and Cesare Borgia. Francesco, by proper\nmeans and with great ability, from being a private person rose to be\nDuke of Milan, and that which he had acquired with a thousand anxieties\nhe kept with little trouble. On the other hand, Cesare Borgia, called\nby the people Duke Valentino, acquired his state during the ascendancy\nof his father, and on its decline he lost it, notwithstanding that he\nhad taken every measure and done all that ought to be done by a wise\nand able man to fix firmly his roots in the states which the arms and\nfortunes of others had bestowed on him.\n[2] Francesco Sforza, born 1401, died 1466. He married Bianca Maria\nVisconti, a natural daughter of Filippo Visconti, the Duke of Milan,\non whose death he procured his own elevation to the duchy. Machiavelli\nwas the accredited agent of the Florentine Republic to Cesare Borgia\n(1478-1507) during the transactions which led up to the assassinations\nof the Orsini and Vitelli at Sinigalia, and along with his letters to\nhis chiefs in Florence he has left an account, written ten years\nbefore _The Prince_, of the proceedings of the duke in his\n\u201cDescritione del modo tenuto dal duca Valentino nello ammazzare\nVitellozzo Vitelli,\u201d etc., a translation of which is appended to the\npresent work.\nBecause, as is stated above, he who has not first laid his foundations\nmay be able with great ability to lay them afterwards, but they will be\nlaid with trouble to the architect and danger to the building. If,\ntherefore, all the steps taken by the duke be considered, it will be\nseen that he laid solid foundations for his future power, and I do not\nconsider it superfluous to discuss them, because I do not know what\nbetter precepts to give a new prince than the example of his actions;\nand if his dispositions were of no avail, that was not his fault, but\nthe extraordinary and extreme malignity of fortune.\nAlexander the Sixth, in wishing to aggrandize the duke, his son, had\nmany immediate and prospective difficulties. Firstly, he did not see\nhis way to make him master of any state that was not a state of the\nChurch; and if he was willing to rob the Church he knew that the Duke\nof Milan and the Venetians would not consent, because Faenza and Rimini\nwere already under the protection of the Venetians. Besides this, he\nsaw the arms of Italy, especially those by which he might have been\nassisted, in hands that would fear the aggrandizement of the Pope,\nnamely, the Orsini and the Colonnesi and their following. It behoved\nhim, therefore, to upset this state of affairs and embroil the powers,\nso as to make himself securely master of part of their states. This was\neasy for him to do, because he found the Venetians, moved by other\nreasons, inclined to bring back the French into Italy; he would not\nonly not oppose this, but he would render it more easy by dissolving\nthe former marriage of King Louis. Therefore the king came into Italy\nwith the assistance of the Venetians and the consent of Alexander. He\nwas no sooner in Milan than the Pope had soldiers from him for the\nattempt on the Romagna, which yielded to him on the reputation of the\nking. The duke, therefore, having acquired the Romagna and beaten the\nColonnesi, while wishing to hold that and to advance further, was\nhindered by two things: the one, his forces did not appear loyal to\nhim, the other, the goodwill of France: that is to say, he feared that\nthe forces of the Orsini, which he was using, would not stand to him,\nthat not only might they hinder him from winning more, but might\nthemselves seize what he had won, and that the king might also do the\nsame. Of the Orsini he had a warning when, after taking Faenza and\nattacking Bologna, he saw them go very unwillingly to that attack. And\nas to the king, he learned his mind when he himself, after taking the\nDuchy of Urbino, attacked Tuscany, and the king made him desist from\nthat undertaking; hence the duke decided to depend no more upon the\narms and the luck of others.\nFor the first thing he weakened the Orsini and Colonnesi parties in\nRome, by gaining to himself all their adherents who were gentlemen,\nmaking them his gentlemen, giving them good pay, and, according to\ntheir rank, honouring them with office and command in such a way that\nin a few months all attachment to the factions was destroyed and turned\nentirely to the duke. After this he awaited an opportunity to crush the\nOrsini, having scattered the adherents of the Colonna house. This came\nto him soon and he used it well; for the Orsini, perceiving at length\nthat the aggrandizement of the duke and the Church was ruin to them,\ncalled a meeting of the Magione in Perugia. From this sprung the\nrebellion at Urbino and the tumults in the Romagna, with endless\ndangers to the duke, all of which he overcame with the help of the\nFrench. Having restored his authority, not to leave it at risk by\ntrusting either to the French or other outside forces, he had recourse\nto his wiles, and he knew so well how to conceal his mind that, by the\nmediation of Signor Pagolo\u2014whom the duke did not fail to secure with\nall kinds of attention, giving him money, apparel, and horses\u2014the\nOrsini were reconciled, so that their simplicity brought them into his\npower at Sinigalia.[3] Having exterminated the leaders, and turned\ntheir partisans into his friends, the duke laid sufficiently good\nfoundations to his power, having all the Romagna and the Duchy of\nUrbino; and the people now beginning to appreciate their prosperity, he\ngained them all over to himself. And as this point is worthy of notice,\nand to be imitated by others, I am not willing to leave it out.\n[3] Sinigalia, 31st December 1502.\nWhen the duke occupied the Romagna he found it under the rule of weak\nmasters, who rather plundered their subjects than ruled them, and gave\nthem more cause for disunion than for union, so that the country was\nfull of robbery, quarrels, and every kind of violence; and so, wishing\nto bring back peace and obedience to authority, he considered it\nnecessary to give it a good governor. Thereupon he promoted Messer\nRamiro d\u2019Orco,[4] a swift and cruel man, to whom he gave the fullest\npower. This man in a short time restored peace and unity with the\ngreatest success. Afterwards the duke considered that it was not\nadvisable to confer such excessive authority, for he had no doubt but\nthat he would become odious, so he set up a court of judgment in the\ncountry, under a most excellent president, wherein all cities had their\nadvocates. And because he knew that the past severity had caused some\nhatred against himself, so, to clear himself in the minds of the\npeople, and gain them entirely to himself, he desired to show that, if\nany cruelty had been practised, it had not originated with him, but in\nthe natural sternness of the minister. Under this pretence he took\nRamiro, and one morning caused him to be executed and left on the\npiazza at Cesena with the block and a bloody knife at his side. The\nbarbarity of this spectacle caused the people to be at once satisfied\nand dismayed.\n[4] Ramiro d\u2019Orco. Ramiro de Lorqua.\nBut let us return whence we started. I say that the duke, finding\nhimself now sufficiently powerful and partly secured from immediate\ndangers by having armed himself in his own way, and having in a great\nmeasure crushed those forces in his vicinity that could injure him if\nhe wished to proceed with his conquest, had next to consider France,\nfor he knew that the king, who too late was aware of his mistake, would\nnot support him. And from this time he began to seek new alliances and\nto temporize with France in the expedition which she was making towards\nthe kingdom of Naples against the Spaniards who were besieging Gaeta.\nIt was his intention to secure himself against them, and this he would\nhave quickly accomplished had Alexander lived.\nSuch was his line of action as to present affairs. But as to the future\nhe had to fear, in the first place, that a new successor to the Church\nmight not be friendly to him and might seek to take from him that which\nAlexander had given him, so he decided to act in four ways. Firstly, by\nexterminating the families of those lords whom he had despoiled, so as\nto take away that pretext from the Pope. Secondly, by winning to\nhimself all the gentlemen of Rome, so as to be able to curb the Pope\nwith their aid, as has been observed. Thirdly, by converting the\ncollege more to himself. Fourthly, by acquiring so much power before\nthe Pope should die that he could by his own measures resist the first\nshock. Of these four things, at the death of Alexander, he had\naccomplished three. For he had killed as many of the dispossessed lords\nas he could lay hands on, and few had escaped; he had won over the\nRoman gentlemen, and he had the most numerous party in the college. And\nas to any fresh acquisition, he intended to become master of Tuscany,\nfor he already possessed Perugia and Piombino, and Pisa was under his\nprotection. And as he had no longer to study France (for the French\nwere already driven out of the kingdom of Naples by the Spaniards, and\nin this way both were compelled to buy his goodwill), he pounced down\nupon Pisa. After this, Lucca and Siena yielded at once, partly through\nhatred and partly through fear of the Florentines; and the Florentines\nwould have had no remedy had he continued to prosper, as he was\nprospering the year that Alexander died, for he had acquired so much\npower and reputation that he would have stood by himself, and no longer\nhave depended on the luck and the forces of others, but solely on his\nown power and ability.\nBut Alexander died five years after he had first drawn the sword. He\nleft the duke with the state of Romagna alone consolidated, with the\nrest in the air, between two most powerful hostile armies, and sick\nunto death. Yet there were in the duke such boldness and ability, and\nhe knew so well how men are to be won or lost, and so firm were the\nfoundations which in so short a time he had laid, that if he had not\nhad those armies on his back, or if he had been in good health, he\nwould have overcome all difficulties. And it is seen that his\nfoundations were good, for the Romagna awaited him for more than a\nmonth. In Rome, although but half alive, he remained secure; and whilst\nthe Baglioni, the Vitelli, and the Orsini might come to Rome, they\ncould not effect anything against him. If he could not have made Pope\nhim whom he wished, at least the one whom he did not wish would not\nhave been elected. But if he had been in sound health at the death of\nAlexander,[5] everything would have been different to him. On the day\nthat Julius the Second[6] was elected, he told me that he had thought\nof everything that might occur at the death of his father, and had\nprovided a remedy for all, except that he had never anticipated that,\nwhen the death did happen, he himself would be on the point to die.\n[5] Alexander VI died of fever, 18th August 1503.\n[6] Julius II was Giuliano della Rovere, Cardinal of San Pietro ad\nVincula, born 1443, died 1513.\nWhen all the actions of the duke are recalled, I do not know how to\nblame him, but rather it appears to be, as I have said, that I ought to\noffer him for imitation to all those who, by the fortune or the arms of\nothers, are raised to government. Because he, having a lofty spirit and\nfar-reaching aims, could not have regulated his conduct otherwise, and\nonly the shortness of the life of Alexander and his own sickness\nfrustrated his designs. Therefore, he who considers it necessary to\nsecure himself in his new principality, to win friends, to overcome\neither by force or fraud, to make himself beloved and feared by the\npeople, to be followed and revered by the soldiers, to exterminate\nthose who have power or reason to hurt him, to change the old order of\nthings for new, to be severe and gracious, magnanimous and liberal, to\ndestroy a disloyal soldiery and to create new, to maintain friendship\nwith kings and princes in such a way that they must help him with zeal\nand offend with caution, cannot find a more lively example than the\nactions of this man.\nOnly can he be blamed for the election of Julius the Second, in whom he\nmade a bad choice, because, as is said, not being able to elect a Pope\nto his own mind, he could have hindered any other from being elected\nPope; and he ought never to have consented to the election of any\ncardinal whom he had injured or who had cause to fear him if they\nbecame pontiffs. For men injure either from fear or hatred. Those whom\nhe had injured, amongst others, were San Pietro ad Vincula, Colonna,\nSan Giorgio, and Ascanio.[7] The rest, in becoming Pope, had to fear\nhim, Rouen and the Spaniards excepted; the latter from their\nrelationship and obligations, the former from his influence, the\nkingdom of France having relations with him. Therefore, above\neverything, the duke ought to have created a Spaniard Pope, and,\nfailing him, he ought to have consented to Rouen and not San Pietro ad\nVincula. He who believes that new benefits will cause great personages\nto forget old injuries is deceived. Therefore, the duke erred in his\nchoice, and it was the cause of his ultimate ruin.\n[7] San Giorgio is Raffaello Riario. Ascanio is Ascanio Sforza.\nCHAPTER VIII.\nCONCERNING THOSE WHO HAVE OBTAINED A PRINCIPALITY BY WICKEDNESS\nAlthough a prince may rise from a private station in two ways, neither\nof which can be entirely attributed to fortune or genius, yet it is\nmanifest to me that I must not be silent on them, although one could be\nmore copiously treated when I discuss republics. These methods are\nwhen, either by some wicked or nefarious ways, one ascends to the\nprincipality, or when by the favour of his fellow-citizens a private\nperson becomes the prince of his country. And speaking of the first\nmethod, it will be illustrated by two examples\u2014one ancient, the other\nmodern\u2014and without entering further into the subject, I consider these\ntwo examples will suffice those who may be compelled to follow them.\nAgathocles, the Sicilian,[1] became King of Syracuse not only from a\nprivate but from a low and abject position. This man, the son of a\npotter, through all the changes in his fortunes always led an infamous\nlife. Nevertheless, he accompanied his infamies with so much ability of\nmind and body that, having devoted himself to the military profession,\nhe rose through its ranks to be Praetor of Syracuse. Being established\nin that position, and having deliberately resolved to make himself\nprince and to seize by violence, without obligation to others, that\nwhich had been conceded to him by assent, he came to an understanding\nfor this purpose with Amilcar, the Carthaginian, who, with his army,\nwas fighting in Sicily. One morning he assembled the people and the\nsenate of Syracuse, as if he had to discuss with them things relating\nto the Republic, and at a given signal the soldiers killed all the\nsenators and the richest of the people; these dead, he seized and held\nthe princedom of that city without any civil commotion. And although he\nwas twice routed by the Carthaginians, and ultimately besieged, yet not\nonly was he able to defend his city, but leaving part of his men for\nits defence, with the others he attacked Africa, and in a short time\nraised the siege of Syracuse. The Carthaginians, reduced to extreme\nnecessity, were compelled to come to terms with Agathocles, and,\nleaving Sicily to him, had to be content with the possession of Africa.\n[1] Agathocles the Sicilian, born 361 B.C., died 289 B.C.\nTherefore, he who considers the actions and the genius of this man will\nsee nothing, or little, which can be attributed to fortune, inasmuch as\nhe attained pre-eminence, as is shown above, not by the favour of any\none, but step by step in the military profession, which steps were\ngained with a thousand troubles and perils, and were afterwards boldly\nheld by him with many hazardous dangers. Yet it cannot be called talent\nto slay fellow-citizens, to deceive friends, to be without faith,\nwithout mercy, without religion; such methods may gain empire, but not\nglory. Still, if the courage of Agathocles in entering into and\nextricating himself from dangers be considered, together with his\ngreatness of mind in enduring and overcoming hardships, it cannot be\nseen why he should be esteemed less than the most notable captain.\nNevertheless, his barbarous cruelty and inhumanity with infinite\nwickedness do not permit him to be celebrated among the most excellent\nmen. What he achieved cannot be attributed either to fortune or genius.\nIn our times, during the rule of Alexander the Sixth, Oliverotto da\nFermo, having been left an orphan many years before, was brought up by\nhis maternal uncle, Giovanni Fogliani, and in the early days of his\nyouth sent to fight under Pagolo Vitelli, that, being trained under his\ndiscipline, he might attain some high position in the military\nprofession. After Pagolo died, he fought under his brother Vitellozzo,\nand in a very short time, being endowed with wit and a vigorous body\nand mind, he became the first man in his profession. But it appearing a\npaltry thing to serve under others, he resolved, with the aid of some\ncitizens of Fermo, to whom the slavery of their country was dearer than\nits liberty, and with the help of the Vitelleschi, to seize Fermo. So\nhe wrote to Giovanni Fogliani that, having been away from home for many\nyears, he wished to visit him and his city, and in some measure to look\nupon his patrimony; and although he had not laboured to acquire\nanything except honour, yet, in order that the citizens should see he\nhad not spent his time in vain, he desired to come honourably, so would\nbe accompanied by one hundred horsemen, his friends and retainers; and\nhe entreated Giovanni to arrange that he should be received honourably\nby the Fermians, all of which would be not only to his honour, but also\nto that of Giovanni himself, who had brought him up.\nGiovanni, therefore, did not fail in any attentions due to his nephew,\nand he caused him to be honourably received by the Fermians, and he\nlodged him in his own house, where, having passed some days, and having\narranged what was necessary for his wicked designs, Oliverotto gave a\nsolemn banquet to which he invited Giovanni Fogliani and the chiefs of\nFermo. When the viands and all the other entertainments that are usual\nin such banquets were finished, Oliverotto artfully began certain grave\ndiscourses, speaking of the greatness of Pope Alexander and his son\nCesare, and of their enterprises, to which discourse Giovanni and\nothers answered; but he rose at once, saying that such matters ought to\nbe discussed in a more private place, and he betook himself to a\nchamber, whither Giovanni and the rest of the citizens went in after\nhim. No sooner were they seated than soldiers issued from secret places\nand slaughtered Giovanni and the rest. After these murders Oliverotto,\nmounted on horseback, rode up and down the town and besieged the chief\nmagistrate in the palace, so that in fear the people were forced to\nobey him, and to form a government, of which he made himself the\nprince. He killed all the malcontents who were able to injure him, and\nstrengthened himself with new civil and military ordinances, in such a\nway that, in the year during which he held the principality, not only\nwas he secure in the city of Fermo, but he had become formidable to all\nhis neighbours. And his destruction would have been as difficult as\nthat of Agathocles if he had not allowed himself to be overreached by\nCesare Borgia, who took him with the Orsini and Vitelli at Sinigalia,\nas was stated above. Thus one year after he had committed this\nparricide, he was strangled, together with Vitellozzo, whom he had made\nhis leader in valour and wickedness.\nSome may wonder how it can happen that Agathocles, and his like, after\ninfinite treacheries and cruelties, should live for long secure in his\ncountry, and defend himself from external enemies, and never be\nconspired against by his own citizens; seeing that many others, by\nmeans of cruelty, have never been able even in peaceful times to hold\nthe state, still less in the doubtful times of war. I believe that this\nfollows from severities[2] being badly or properly used. Those may be\ncalled properly used, if of evil it is possible to speak well, that are\napplied at one blow and are necessary to one\u2019s security, and that are\nnot persisted in afterwards unless they can be turned to the advantage\nof the subjects. The badly employed are those which, notwithstanding\nthey may be few in the commencement, multiply with time rather than\ndecrease. Those who practise the first system are able, by aid of God\nor man, to mitigate in some degree their rule, as Agathocles did. It is\nimpossible for those who follow the other to maintain themselves.\n[2] Mr Burd suggests that this word probably comes near the modern\nequivalent of Machiavelli\u2019s thought when he speaks of \u201ccrudelta\u201d than\nthe more obvious \u201ccruelties.\u201d\nHence it is to be remarked that, in seizing a state, the usurper ought\nto examine closely into all those injuries which it is necessary for\nhim to inflict, and to do them all at one stroke so as not to have to\nrepeat them daily; and thus by not unsettling men he will be able to\nreassure them, and win them to himself by benefits. He who does\notherwise, either from timidity or evil advice, is always compelled to\nkeep the knife in his hand; neither can he rely on his subjects, nor\ncan they attach themselves to him, owing to their continued and\nrepeated wrongs. For injuries ought to be done all at one time, so\nthat, being tasted less, they offend less; benefits ought to be given\nlittle by little, so that the flavour of them may last longer.\nAnd above all things, a prince ought to live amongst his people in such\na way that no unexpected circumstances, whether of good or evil, shall\nmake him change; because if the necessity for this comes in troubled\ntimes, you are too late for harsh measures; and mild ones will not help\nyou, for they will be considered as forced from you, and no one will be\nunder any obligation to you for them.\nCHAPTER IX.\nCONCERNING A CIVIL PRINCIPALITY\nBut coming to the other point\u2014where a leading citizen becomes the\nprince of his country, not by wickedness or any intolerable violence,\nbut by the favour of his fellow citizens\u2014this may be called a civil\nprincipality: nor is genius or fortune altogether necessary to attain\nto it, but rather a happy shrewdness. I say then that such a\nprincipality is obtained either by the favour of the people or by the\nfavour of the nobles. Because in all cities these two distinct parties\nare found, and from this it arises that the people do not wish to be\nruled nor oppressed by the nobles, and the nobles wish to rule and\noppress the people; and from these two opposite desires there arises in\ncities one of three results, either a principality, self-government, or\nanarchy.\nA principality is created either by the people or by the nobles,\naccordingly as one or other of them has the opportunity; for the\nnobles, seeing they cannot withstand the people, begin to cry up the\nreputation of one of themselves, and they make him a prince, so that\nunder his shadow they can give vent to their ambitions. The people,\nfinding they cannot resist the nobles, also cry up the reputation of\none of themselves, and make him a prince so as to be defended by his\nauthority. He who obtains sovereignty by the assistance of the nobles\nmaintains himself with more difficulty than he who comes to it by the\naid of the people, because the former finds himself with many around\nhim who consider themselves his equals, and because of this he can\nneither rule nor manage them to his liking. But he who reaches\nsovereignty by popular favour finds himself alone, and has none around\nhim, or few, who are not prepared to obey him.\nBesides this, one cannot by fair dealing, and without injury to others,\nsatisfy the nobles, but you can satisfy the people, for their object is\nmore righteous than that of the nobles, the latter wishing to oppress,\nwhile the former only desire not to be oppressed. It is to be added\nalso that a prince can never secure himself against a hostile people,\nbecause of there being too many, whilst from the nobles he can secure\nhimself, as they are few in number. The worst that a prince may expect\nfrom a hostile people is to be abandoned by them; but from hostile\nnobles he has not only to fear abandonment, but also that they will\nrise against him; for they, being in these affairs more far-seeing and\nastute, always come forward in time to save themselves, and to obtain\nfavours from him whom they expect to prevail. Further, the prince is\ncompelled to live always with the same people, but he can do well\nwithout the same nobles, being able to make and unmake them daily, and\nto give or take away authority when it pleases him.\nTherefore, to make this point clearer, I say that the nobles ought to\nbe looked at mainly in two ways: that is to say, they either shape\ntheir course in such a way as binds them entirely to your fortune, or\nthey do not. Those who so bind themselves, and are not rapacious, ought\nto be honoured and loved; those who do not bind themselves may be dealt\nwith in two ways; they may fail to do this through pusillanimity and a\nnatural want of courage, in which case you ought to make use of them,\nespecially of those who are of good counsel; and thus, whilst in\nprosperity you honour them, in adversity you do not have to fear them.\nBut when for their own ambitious ends they shun binding themselves, it\nis a token that they are giving more thought to themselves than to you,\nand a prince ought to guard against such, and to fear them as if they\nwere open enemies, because in adversity they always help to ruin him.\nTherefore, one who becomes a prince through the favour of the people\nought to keep them friendly, and this he can easily do seeing they only\nask not to be oppressed by him. But one who, in opposition to the\npeople, becomes a prince by the favour of the nobles, ought, above\neverything, to seek to win the people over to himself, and this he may\neasily do if he takes them under his protection. Because men, when they\nreceive good from him of whom they were expecting evil, are bound more\nclosely to their benefactor; thus the people quickly become more\ndevoted to him than if he had been raised to the principality by their\nfavours; and the prince can win their affections in many ways, but as\nthese vary according to the circumstances one cannot give fixed rules,\nso I omit them; but, I repeat, it is necessary for a prince to have the\npeople friendly, otherwise he has no security in adversity.\nNabis,[1] Prince of the Spartans, sustained the attack of all Greece,\nand of a victorious Roman army, and against them he defended his\ncountry and his government; and for the overcoming of this peril it was\nonly necessary for him to make himself secure against a few, but this\nwould not have been sufficient had the people been hostile. And do not\nlet any one impugn this statement with the trite proverb that \u201cHe who\nbuilds on the people, builds on the mud,\u201d for this is true when a\nprivate citizen makes a foundation there, and persuades himself that\nthe people will free him when he is oppressed by his enemies or by the\nmagistrates; wherein he would find himself very often deceived, as\nhappened to the Gracchi in Rome and to Messer Giorgio Scali[2] in\nFlorence. But granted a prince who has established himself as above,\nwho can command, and is a man of courage, undismayed in adversity, who\ndoes not fail in other qualifications, and who, by his resolution and\nenergy, keeps the whole people encouraged\u2014such a one will never find\nhimself deceived in them, and it will be shown that he has laid his\nfoundations well.\n[1] Nabis, tyrant of Sparta, conquered by the Romans under Flamininus\nin 195 B.C.; killed 192 B.C.\n[2] Messer Giorgio Scali. This event is to be found in Machiavelli\u2019s\n\u201cFlorentine History,\u201d Book III.\nThese principalities are liable to danger when they are passing from\nthe civil to the absolute order of government, for such princes either\nrule personally or through magistrates. In the latter case their\ngovernment is weaker and more insecure, because it rests entirely on\nthe goodwill of those citizens who are raised to the magistracy, and\nwho, especially in troubled times, can destroy the government with\ngreat ease, either by intrigue or open defiance; and the prince has not\nthe chance amid tumults to exercise absolute authority, because the\ncitizens and subjects, accustomed to receive orders from magistrates,\nare not of a mind to obey him amid these confusions, and there will\nalways be in doubtful times a scarcity of men whom he can trust. For\nsuch a prince cannot rely upon what he observes in quiet times, when\ncitizens have need of the state, because then every one agrees with\nhim; they all promise, and when death is far distant they all wish to\ndie for him; but in troubled times, when the state has need of its\ncitizens, then he finds but few. And so much the more is this\nexperiment dangerous, inasmuch as it can only be tried once. Therefore\na wise prince ought to adopt such a course that his citizens will\nalways in every sort and kind of circumstance have need of the state\nand of him, and then he will always find them faithful.\nCHAPTER X.\nCONCERNING THE WAY IN WHICH THE STRENGTH OF ALL PRINCIPALITIES OUGHT TO\nBE MEASURED\nIt is necessary to consider another point in examining the character of\nthese principalities: that is, whether a prince has such power that, in\ncase of need, he can support himself with his own resources, or whether\nhe has always need of the assistance of others. And to make this quite\nclear I say that I consider those who are able to support themselves by\ntheir own resources who can, either by abundance of men or money, raise\na sufficient army to join battle against any one who comes to attack\nthem; and I consider those always to have need of others who cannot\nshow themselves against the enemy in the field, but are forced to\ndefend themselves by sheltering behind walls. The first case has been\ndiscussed, but we will speak of it again should it recur. In the second\ncase one can say nothing except to encourage such princes to provision\nand fortify their towns, and not on any account to defend the country.\nAnd whoever shall fortify his town well, and shall have managed the\nother concerns of his subjects in the way stated above, and to be often\nrepeated, will never be attacked without great caution, for men are\nalways adverse to enterprises where difficulties can be seen, and it\nwill be seen not to be an easy thing to attack one who has his town\nwell fortified, and is not hated by his people.\nThe cities of Germany are absolutely free, they own but little country\naround them, and they yield obedience to the emperor when it suits\nthem, nor do they fear this or any other power they may have near them,\nbecause they are fortified in such a way that every one thinks the\ntaking of them by assault would be tedious and difficult, seeing they\nhave proper ditches and walls, they have sufficient artillery, and they\nalways keep in public depots enough for one year\u2019s eating, drinking,\nand firing. And beyond this, to keep the people quiet and without loss\nto the state, they always have the means of giving work to the\ncommunity in those labours that are the life and strength of the city,\nand on the pursuit of which the people are supported; they also hold\nmilitary exercises in repute, and moreover have many ordinances to\nuphold them.\nTherefore, a prince who has a strong city, and had not made himself\nodious, will not be attacked, or if any one should attack he will only\nbe driven off with disgrace; again, because that the affairs of this\nworld are so changeable, it is almost impossible to keep an army a\nwhole year in the field without being interfered with. And whoever\nshould reply: If the people have property outside the city, and see it\nburnt, they will not remain patient, and the long siege and\nself-interest will make them forget their prince; to this I answer that\na powerful and courageous prince will overcome all such difficulties by\ngiving at one time hope to his subjects that the evil will not be for\nlong, at another time fear of the cruelty of the enemy, then preserving\nhimself adroitly from those subjects who seem to him to be too bold.\nFurther, the enemy would naturally on his arrival at once burn and ruin\nthe country at the time when the spirits of the people are still hot\nand ready for the defence; and, therefore, so much the less ought the\nprince to hesitate; because after a time, when spirits have cooled, the\ndamage is already done, the ills are incurred, and there is no longer\nany remedy; and therefore they are so much the more ready to unite with\ntheir prince, he appearing to be under obligations to them now that\ntheir houses have been burnt and their possessions ruined in his\ndefence. For it is the nature of men to be bound by the benefits they\nconfer as much as by those they receive. Therefore, if everything is\nwell considered, it will not be difficult for a wise prince to keep the\nminds of his citizens steadfast from first to last, when he does not\nfail to support and defend them.\nCHAPTER XI.\nCONCERNING ECCLESIASTICAL PRINCIPALITIES\nIt only remains now to speak of ecclesiastical principalities, touching\nwhich all difficulties are prior to getting possession, because they\nare acquired either by capacity or good fortune, and they can be held\nwithout either; for they are sustained by the ancient ordinances of\nreligion, which are so all-powerful, and of such a character that the\nprincipalities may be held no matter how their princes behave and live.\nThese princes alone have states and do not defend them; and they have\nsubjects and do not rule them; and the states, although unguarded, are\nnot taken from them, and the subjects, although not ruled, do not care,\nand they have neither the desire nor the ability to alienate\nthemselves. Such principalities only are secure and happy. But being\nupheld by powers, to which the human mind cannot reach, I shall speak\nno more of them, because, being exalted and maintained by God, it would\nbe the act of a presumptuous and rash man to discuss them.\nNevertheless, if any one should ask of me how comes it that the Church\nhas attained such greatness in temporal power, seeing that from\nAlexander backwards the Italian potentates (not only those who have\nbeen called potentates, but every baron and lord, though the smallest)\nhave valued the temporal power very slightly\u2014yet now a king of France\ntrembles before it, and it has been able to drive him from Italy, and\nto ruin the Venetians\u2014although this may be very manifest, it does not\nappear to me superfluous to recall it in some measure to memory.\nBefore Charles, King of France, passed into Italy,[1] this country was\nunder the dominion of the Pope, the Venetians, the King of Naples, the\nDuke of Milan, and the Florentines. These potentates had two principal\nanxieties: the one, that no foreigner should enter Italy under arms;\nthe other, that none of themselves should seize more territory. Those\nabout whom there was the most anxiety were the Pope and the Venetians.\nTo restrain the Venetians the union of all the others was necessary, as\nit was for the defence of Ferrara; and to keep down the Pope they made\nuse of the barons of Rome, who, being divided into two factions, Orsini\nand Colonnesi, had always a pretext for disorder, and, standing with\narms in their hands under the eyes of the Pontiff, kept the pontificate\nweak and powerless. And although there might arise sometimes a\ncourageous pope, such as Sixtus, yet neither fortune nor wisdom could\nrid him of these annoyances. And the short life of a pope is also a\ncause of weakness; for in the ten years, which is the average life of a\npope, he can with difficulty lower one of the factions; and if, so to\nspeak, one people should almost destroy the Colonnesi, another would\narise hostile to the Orsini, who would support their opponents, and yet\nwould not have time to ruin the Orsini. This was the reason why the\ntemporal powers of the pope were little esteemed in Italy.\n[1] Charles VIII invaded Italy in 1494.\nAlexander the Sixth arose afterwards, who of all the pontiffs that have\never been showed how a pope with both money and arms was able to\nprevail; and through the instrumentality of the Duke Valentino, and by\nreason of the entry of the French, he brought about all those things\nwhich I have discussed above in the actions of the duke. And although\nhis intention was not to aggrandize the Church, but the duke,\nnevertheless, what he did contributed to the greatness of the Church,\nwhich, after his death and the ruin of the duke, became the heir to all\nhis labours.\nPope Julius came afterwards and found the Church strong, possessing all\nthe Romagna, the barons of Rome reduced to impotence, and, through the\nchastisements of Alexander, the factions wiped out; he also found the\nway open to accumulate money in a manner such as had never been\npractised before Alexander\u2019s time. Such things Julius not only\nfollowed, but improved upon, and he intended to gain Bologna, to ruin\nthe Venetians, and to drive the French out of Italy. All of these\nenterprises prospered with him, and so much the more to his credit,\ninasmuch as he did everything to strengthen the Church and not any\nprivate person. He kept also the Orsini and Colonnesi factions within\nthe bounds in which he found them; and although there was among them\nsome mind to make disturbance, nevertheless he held two things firm:\nthe one, the greatness of the Church, with which he terrified them; and\nthe other, not allowing them to have their own cardinals, who caused\nthe disorders among them. For whenever these factions have their\ncardinals they do not remain quiet for long, because cardinals foster\nthe factions in Rome and out of it, and the barons are compelled to\nsupport them, and thus from the ambitions of prelates arise disorders\nand tumults among the barons. For these reasons his Holiness Pope\nLeo[2] found the pontificate most powerful, and it is to be hoped that,\nif others made it great in arms, he will make it still greater and more\nvenerated by his goodness and infinite other virtues.\n[2] Pope Leo X was the Cardinal de\u2019 Medici.\nCHAPTER XII.\nHOW MANY KINDS OF SOLDIERY THERE ARE, AND CONCERNING MERCENARIES\nHaving discoursed particularly on the characteristics of such\nprincipalities as in the beginning I proposed to discuss, and having\nconsidered in some degree the causes of there being good or bad, and\nhaving shown the methods by which many have sought to acquire them and\nto hold them, it now remains for me to discuss generally the means of\noffence and defence which belong to each of them.\nWe have seen above how necessary it is for a prince to have his\nfoundations well laid, otherwise it follows of necessity he will go to\nruin. The chief foundations of all states, new as well as old or\ncomposite, are good laws and good arms; and as there cannot be good\nlaws where the state is not well armed, it follows that where they are\nwell armed they have good laws. I shall leave the laws out of the\ndiscussion and shall speak of the arms.\nI say, therefore, that the arms with which a prince defends his state\nare either his own, or they are mercenaries, auxiliaries, or mixed.\nMercenaries and auxiliaries are useless and dangerous; and if one holds\nhis state based on these arms, he will stand neither firm nor safe; for\nthey are disunited, ambitious, and without discipline, unfaithful,\nvaliant before friends, cowardly before enemies; they have neither the\nfear of God nor fidelity to men, and destruction is deferred only so\nlong as the attack is; for in peace one is robbed by them, and in war\nby the enemy. The fact is, they have no other attraction or reason for\nkeeping the field than a trifle of stipend, which is not sufficient to\nmake them willing to die for you. They are ready enough to be your\nsoldiers whilst you do not make war, but if war comes they take\nthemselves off or run from the foe; which I should have little trouble\nto prove, for the ruin of Italy has been caused by nothing else than by\nresting all her hopes for many years on mercenaries, and although they\nformerly made some display and appeared valiant amongst themselves, yet\nwhen the foreigners came they showed what they were. Thus it was that\nCharles, King of France, was allowed to seize Italy with chalk in\nhand;[1] and he who told us that our sins were the cause of it told the\ntruth, but they were not the sins he imagined, but those which I have\nrelated. And as they were the sins of princes, it is the princes who\nhave also suffered the penalty.\n[1] \u201cWith chalk in hand,\u201d \u201ccol gesso.\u201d This is one of the _bons mots_\nof Alexander VI, and refers to the ease with which Charles VIII seized\nItaly, implying that it was only necessary for him to send his\nquartermasters to chalk up the billets for his soldiers to conquer the\ncountry. _Cf_. \u201cThe History of Henry VII,\u201d by Lord Bacon: \u201cKing\nCharles had conquered the realm of Naples, and lost it again, in a\nkind of a felicity of a dream. He passed the whole length of Italy\nwithout resistance: so that it was true what Pope Alexander was wont\nto say: That the Frenchmen came into Italy with chalk in their hands,\nto mark up their lodgings, rather than with swords to fight.\u201d\nI wish to demonstrate further the infelicity of these arms. The\nmercenary captains are either capable men or they are not; if they are,\nyou cannot trust them, because they always aspire to their own\ngreatness, either by oppressing you, who are their master, or others\ncontrary to your intentions; but if the captain is not skilful, you are\nruined in the usual way.\nAnd if it be urged that whoever is armed will act in the same way,\nwhether mercenary or not, I reply that when arms have to be resorted\nto, either by a prince or a republic, then the prince ought to go in\nperson and perform the duty of a captain; the republic has to send its\ncitizens, and when one is sent who does not turn out satisfactorily, it\nought to recall him, and when one is worthy, to hold him by the laws so\nthat he does not leave the command. And experience has shown princes\nand republics, single-handed, making the greatest progress, and\nmercenaries doing nothing except damage; and it is more difficult to\nbring a republic, armed with its own arms, under the sway of one of its\ncitizens than it is to bring one armed with foreign arms. Rome and\nSparta stood for many ages armed and free. The Switzers are completely\narmed and quite free.\nOf ancient mercenaries, for example, there are the Carthaginians, who\nwere oppressed by their mercenary soldiers after the first war with the\nRomans, although the Carthaginians had their own citizens for captains.\nAfter the death of Epaminondas, Philip of Macedon was made captain of\ntheir soldiers by the Thebans, and after victory he took away their\nliberty.\nDuke Filippo being dead, the Milanese enlisted Francesco Sforza against\nthe Venetians, and he, having overcome the enemy at Caravaggio,[2]\nallied himself with them to crush the Milanese, his masters. His\nfather, Sforza, having been engaged by Queen Johanna[3] of Naples, left\nher unprotected, so that she was forced to throw herself into the arms\nof the King of Aragon, in order to save her kingdom. And if the\nVenetians and Florentines formerly extended their dominions by these\narms, and yet their captains did not make themselves princes, but have\ndefended them, I reply that the Florentines in this case have been\nfavoured by chance, for of the able captains, of whom they might have\nstood in fear, some have not conquered, some have been opposed, and\nothers have turned their ambitions elsewhere. One who did not conquer\nwas Giovanni Acuto,[4] and since he did not conquer his fidelity cannot\nbe proved; but every one will acknowledge that, had he conquered, the\nFlorentines would have stood at his discretion. Sforza had the\nBracceschi always against him, so they watched each other. Francesco\nturned his ambition to Lombardy; Braccio against the Church and the\nkingdom of Naples. But let us come to that which happened a short while\nago. The Florentines appointed as their captain Pagolo Vitelli, a most\nprudent man, who from a private position had risen to the greatest\nrenown. If this man had taken Pisa, nobody can deny that it would have\nbeen proper for the Florentines to keep in with him, for if he became\nthe soldier of their enemies they had no means of resisting, and if\nthey held to him they must obey him. The Venetians, if their\nachievements are considered, will be seen to have acted safely and\ngloriously so long as they sent to war their own men, when with armed\ngentlemen and plebians they did valiantly. This was before they turned\nto enterprises on land, but when they began to fight on land they\nforsook this virtue and followed the custom of Italy. And in the\nbeginning of their expansion on land, through not having much\nterritory, and because of their great reputation, they had not much to\nfear from their captains; but when they expanded, as under\nCarmignuola,[5] they had a taste of this mistake; for, having found him\na most valiant man (they beat the Duke of Milan under his leadership),\nand, on the other hand, knowing how lukewarm he was in the war, they\nfeared they would no longer conquer under him, and for this reason they\nwere not willing, nor were they able, to let him go; and so, not to\nlose again that which they had acquired, they were compelled, in order\nto secure themselves, to murder him. They had afterwards for their\ncaptains Bartolomeo da Bergamo, Roberto da San Severino, the count of\nPitigliano,[6] and the like, under whom they had to dread loss and not\ngain, as happened afterwards at Vaila,[7] where in one battle they lost\nthat which in eight hundred years they had acquired with so much\ntrouble. Because from such arms conquests come but slowly, long delayed\nand inconsiderable, but the losses sudden and portentous.\n[2] Battle of Caravaggio, 15th September 1448.\n[3] Johanna II of Naples, the widow of Ladislao, King of Naples.\n[4] Giovanni Acuto. An English knight whose name was Sir John\nHawkwood. He fought in the English wars in France, and was knighted by\nEdward III; afterwards he collected a body of troops and went into\nItaly. These became the famous \u201cWhite Company.\u201d He took part in many\nwars, and died in Florence in 1394. He was born about 1320 at Sible\nHedingham, a village in Essex. He married Domnia, a daughter of\nBernabo Visconti.\n[5] Carmignuola.

Count of Pitigliano;\nNicolo Orsini, born 1442, died 1510.\n[7] Battle of Vaila in 1509.\nAnd as with these examples I have reached Italy, which has been ruled\nfor many years by mercenaries, I wish to discuss them more seriously,\nin order that, having seen their rise and progress, one may be better\nprepared to counteract them. You must understand that the empire has\nrecently come to be repudiated in Italy, that the Pope has acquired\nmore temporal power, and that Italy has been divided up into more\nstates, for the reason that many of the great cities took up arms\nagainst their nobles, who, formerly favoured by the emperor, were\noppressing them, whilst the Church was favouring them so as to gain\nauthority in temporal power: in many others their citizens became\nprinces. From this it came to pass that Italy fell partly into the\nhands of the Church and of republics, and, the Church consisting of\npriests and the republic of citizens unaccustomed to arms, both\ncommenced to enlist foreigners.\nThe first who gave renown to this soldiery was Alberigo da Conio,[8]\nthe Romagnian. From the school of this man sprang, among others,\nBraccio and Sforza, who in their time were the arbiters of Italy. After\nthese came all the other captains who till now have directed the arms\nof Italy; and the end of all their valour has been, that she has been\noverrun by Charles, robbed by Louis, ravaged by Ferdinand, and insulted\nby the Switzers. The principle that has guided them has been, first, to\nlower the credit of infantry so that they might increase their own.\nThey did this because, subsisting on their pay and without territory,\nthey were unable to support many soldiers, and a few infantry did not\ngive them any authority; so they were led to employ cavalry, with a\nmoderate force of which they were maintained and honoured; and affairs\nwere brought to such a pass that, in an army of twenty thousand\nsoldiers, there were not to be found two thousand foot soldiers. They\nhad, besides this, used every art to lessen fatigue and danger to\nthemselves and their soldiers, not killing in the fray, but taking\nprisoners and liberating without ransom. They did not attack towns at\nnight, nor did the garrisons of the towns attack encampments at night;\nthey did not surround the camp either with stockade or ditch, nor did\nthey campaign in the winter. All these things were permitted by their\nmilitary rules, and devised by them to avoid, as I have said, both\nfatigue and dangers; thus they have brought Italy to slavery and\ncontempt.\n[8] Alberigo da Conio. Alberico da Barbiano, Count of Cunio in\nRomagna. He was the leader of the famous \u201cCompany of St George,\u201d\ncomposed entirely of Italian soldiers. He died in 1409.\nCHAPTER XIII.\nCONCERNING AUXILIARIES, MIXED SOLDIERY, AND ONE\u2019S OWN\nAuxiliaries, which are the other useless arm, are employed when a\nprince is called in with his forces to aid and defend, as was done by\nPope Julius in the most recent times; for he, having, in the enterprise\nagainst Ferrara, had poor proof of his mercenaries, turned to\nauxiliaries, and stipulated with Ferdinand, King of Spain,[1] for his\nassistance with men and arms. These arms may be useful and good in\nthemselves, but for him who calls them in they are always\ndisadvantageous; for losing, one is undone, and winning, one is their\ncaptive.\n[1] Ferdinand V (F. II of Aragon and Sicily, F. III of Naples),\nsurnamed \u201cThe Catholic,\u201d born 1452, died 1516.\nAnd although ancient histories may be full of examples, I do not wish\nto leave this recent one of Pope Julius the Second, the peril of which\ncannot fail to be perceived; for he, wishing to get Ferrara, threw\nhimself entirely into the hands of the foreigner. But his good fortune\nbrought about a third event, so that he did not reap the fruit of his\nrash choice; because, having his auxiliaries routed at Ravenna, and the\nSwitzers having risen and driven out the conquerors (against all\nexpectation, both his and others), it so came to pass that he did not\nbecome prisoner to his enemies, they having fled, nor to his\nauxiliaries, he having conquered by other arms than theirs.\nThe Florentines, being entirely without arms, sent ten thousand\nFrenchmen to take Pisa, whereby they ran more danger than at any other\ntime of their troubles.\nThe Emperor of Constantinople,[2] to oppose his neighbours, sent ten\nthousand Turks into Greece, who, on the war being finished, were not\nwilling to quit; this was the beginning of the servitude of Greece to\nthe infidels.\n[2] Joannes Cantacuzenus, born 1300, died 1383.\nTherefore, let him who has no desire to conquer make use of these arms,\nfor they are much more hazardous than mercenaries, because with them\nthe ruin is ready made; they are all united, all yield obedience to\nothers; but with mercenaries, when they have conquered, more time and\nbetter opportunities are needed to injure you; they are not all of one\ncommunity, they are found and paid by you, and a third party, which you\nhave made their head, is not able all at once to assume enough\nauthority to injure you. In conclusion, in mercenaries dastardy is most\ndangerous; in auxiliaries, valour. The wise prince, therefore, has\nalways avoided these arms and turned to his own; and has been willing\nrather to lose with them than to conquer with the others, not deeming\nthat a real victory which is gained with the arms of others.\nI shall never hesitate to cite Cesare Borgia and his actions. This duke\nentered the Romagna with auxiliaries, taking there only French\nsoldiers, and with them he captured Imola and Forli; but afterwards,\nsuch forces not appearing to him reliable, he turned to mercenaries,\ndiscerning less danger in them, and enlisted the Orsini and Vitelli;\nwhom presently, on handling and finding them doubtful, unfaithful, and\ndangerous, he destroyed and turned to his own men. And the difference\nbetween one and the other of these forces can easily be seen when one\nconsiders the difference there was in the reputation of the duke, when\nhe had the French, when he had the Orsini and Vitelli, and when he\nrelied on his own soldiers, on whose fidelity he could always count and\nfound it ever increasing; he was never esteemed more highly than when\nevery one saw that he was complete master of his own forces.\nI was not intending to go beyond Italian and recent examples, but I am\nunwilling to leave out Hiero, the Syracusan, he being one of those I\nhave named above. This man, as I have said, made head of the army by\nthe Syracusans, soon found out that a mercenary soldiery, constituted\nlike our Italian condottieri, was of no use; and it appearing to him\nthat he could neither keep them nor let them go, he had them all cut to\npieces, and afterwards made war with his own forces and not with\naliens.\nI wish also to recall to memory an instance from the Old Testament\napplicable to this subject. David offered himself to Saul to fight with\nGoliath, the Philistine champion, and, to give him courage, Saul armed\nhim with his own weapons; which David rejected as soon as he had them\non his back, saying he could make no use of them, and that he wished to\nmeet the enemy with his sling and his knife. In conclusion, the arms of\nothers either fall from your back, or they weigh you down, or they bind\nyou fast.\nCharles the Seventh,[3] the father of King Louis the Eleventh,[4]\nhaving by good fortune and valour liberated France from the English,\nrecognized the necessity of being armed with forces of his own, and he\nestablished in his kingdom ordinances concerning men-at-arms and\ninfantry. Afterwards his son, King Louis, abolished the infantry and\nbegan to enlist the Switzers, which mistake, followed by others, is, as\nis now seen, a source of peril to that kingdom; because, having raised\nthe reputation of the Switzers, he has entirely diminished the value of\nhis own arms, for he has destroyed the infantry altogether; and his\nmen-at-arms he has subordinated to others, for, being as they are so\naccustomed to fight along with Switzers, it does not appear that they\ncan now conquer without them. Hence it arises that the French cannot\nstand against the Switzers, and without the Switzers they do not come\noff well against others. The armies of the French have thus become\nmixed, partly mercenary and partly national, both of which arms\ntogether are much better than mercenaries alone or auxiliaries alone,\nbut much inferior to one\u2019s own forces. And this example proves it, for\nthe kingdom of France would be unconquerable if the ordinance of\nCharles had been enlarged or maintained.\n[3] Charles VII of France, surnamed \u201cThe Victorious,\u201d born 1403, died\n1461.\n[4] Louis XI, son of the above, born 1423, died 1483.\nBut the scanty wisdom of man, on entering into an affair which looks\nwell at first, cannot discern the poison that is hidden in it, as I\nhave said above of hectic fevers. Therefore, if he who rules a\nprincipality cannot recognize evils until they are upon him, he is not\ntruly wise; and this insight is given to few. And if the first disaster\nto the Roman Empire[5] should be examined, it will be found to have\ncommenced only with the enlisting of the Goths; because from that time\nthe vigour of the Roman Empire began to decline, and all that valour\nwhich had raised it passed away to others.\n[5] \u201cMany speakers to the House the other night in the debate on the\nreduction of armaments seemed to show a most lamentable ignorance of\nthe conditions under which the British Empire maintains its existence.\nWhen Mr Balfour replied to the allegations that the Roman Empire sank\nunder the weight of its military obligations, he said that this was\n\u2018wholly unhistorical.\u2019 He might well have added that the Roman power\nwas at its zenith when every citizen acknowledged his liability to\nfight for the State, but that it began to decline as soon as this\nobligation was no longer recognised.\u201d\u2014_Pall Mall Gazette_, 15th May\n1906.\nI conclude, therefore, that no principality is secure without having\nits own forces; on the contrary, it is entirely dependent on good\nfortune, not having the valour which in adversity would defend it. And\nit has always been the opinion and judgment of wise men that nothing\ncan be so uncertain or unstable as fame or power not founded on its own\nstrength. And one\u2019s own forces are those which are composed either of\nsubjects, citizens, or dependents; all others are mercenaries or\nauxiliaries. And the way to make ready one\u2019s own forces will be easily\nfound if the rules suggested by me shall be reflected upon, and if one\nwill consider how Philip, the father of Alexander the Great, and many\nrepublics and princes have armed and organized themselves, to which\nrules I entirely commit myself.\nCHAPTER XIV.\nTHAT WHICH CONCERNS A PRINCE ON THE SUBJECT OF THE ART OF WAR\nA prince ought to have no other aim or thought, nor select anything\nelse for his study, than war and its rules and discipline; for this is\nthe sole art that belongs to him who rules, and it is of such force\nthat it not only upholds those who are born princes, but it often\nenables men to rise from a private station to that rank. And, on the\ncontrary, it is seen that when princes have thought more of ease than\nof arms they have lost their states. And the first cause of your losing\nit is to neglect this art; and what enables you to acquire a state is\nto be master of the art. Francesco Sforza, through being martial, from\na private person became Duke of Milan; and the sons, through avoiding\nthe hardships and troubles of arms, from dukes became private persons.\nFor among other evils which being unarmed brings you, it causes you to\nbe despised, and this is one of those ignominies against which a prince\nought to guard himself, as is shown later on. Because there is nothing\nproportionate between the armed and the unarmed; and it is not\nreasonable that he who is armed should yield obedience willingly to him\nwho is unarmed, or that the unarmed man should be secure among armed\nservants. Because, there being in the one disdain and in the other\nsuspicion, it is not possible for them to work well together. And\ntherefore a prince who does not understand the art of war, over and\nabove the other misfortunes already mentioned, cannot be respected by\nhis soldiers, nor can he rely on them. He ought never, therefore, to\nhave out of his thoughts this subject of war, and in peace he should\naddict himself more to its exercise than in war; this he can do in two\nways, the one by action, the other by study.\nAs regards action, he ought above all things to keep his men well\norganized and drilled, to follow incessantly the chase, by which he\naccustoms his body to hardships, and learns something of the nature of\nlocalities, and gets to find out how the mountains rise, how the\nvalleys open out, how the plains lie, and to understand the nature of\nrivers and marshes, and in all this to take the greatest care. Which\nknowledge is useful in two ways. Firstly, he learns to know his\ncountry, and is better able to undertake its defence; afterwards, by\nmeans of the knowledge and observation of that locality, he understands\nwith ease any other which it may be necessary for him to study\nhereafter; because the hills, valleys, and plains, and rivers and\nmarshes that are, for instance, in Tuscany, have a certain resemblance\nto those of other countries, so that with a knowledge of the aspect of\none country one can easily arrive at a knowledge of others. And the\nprince that lacks this skill lacks the essential which it is desirable\nthat a captain should possess, for it teaches him to surprise his\nenemy, to select quarters, to lead armies, to array the battle, to\nbesiege towns to advantage.\nPhilopoemen,[1] Prince of the Achaeans, among other praises which\nwriters have bestowed on him, is commended because in time of peace he\nnever had anything in his mind but the rules of war; and when he was in\nthe country with friends, he often stopped and reasoned with them: \u201cIf\nthe enemy should be upon that hill, and we should find ourselves here\nwith our army, with whom would be the advantage? How should one best\nadvance to meet him, keeping the ranks? If we should wish to retreat,\nhow ought we to pursue?\u201d And he would set forth to them, as he went,\nall the chances that could befall an army; he would listen to their\nopinion and state his, confirming it with reasons, so that by these\ncontinual discussions there could never arise, in time of war, any\nunexpected circumstances that he could not deal with.\n[1] Philopoemen, \u201cthe last of the Greeks,\u201d born 252 B.C., died 183\nB.C.\nBut to exercise the intellect the prince should read histories, and\nstudy there the actions of illustrious men, to see how they have borne\nthemselves in war, to examine the causes of their victories and defeat,\nso as to avoid the latter and imitate the former; and above all do as\nan illustrious man did, who took as an exemplar one who had been\npraised and famous before him, and whose achievements and deeds he\nalways kept in his mind, as it is said Alexander the Great imitated\nAchilles, Caesar Alexander, Scipio Cyrus. And whoever reads the life of\nCyrus, written by Xenophon, will recognize afterwards in the life of\nScipio how that imitation was his glory, and how in chastity,\naffability, humanity, and liberality Scipio conformed to those things\nwhich have been written of Cyrus by Xenophon. A wise prince ought to\nobserve some such rules, and never in peaceful times stand idle, but\nincrease his resources with industry in such a way that they may be\navailable to him in adversity, so that if fortune chances it may find\nhim prepared to resist her blows.\nCHAPTER XV.\nCONCERNING THINGS FOR WHICH MEN, AND ESPECIALLY PRINCES, ARE PRAISED OR\nBLAMED\nIt remains now to see what ought to be the rules of conduct for a\nprince towards subject and friends. And as I know that many have\nwritten on this point, I expect I shall be considered presumptuous in\nmentioning it again, especially as in discussing it I shall depart from\nthe methods of other people. But, it being my intention to write a\nthing which shall be useful to him who apprehends it, it appears to me\nmore appropriate to follow up the real truth of the matter than the\nimagination of it; for many have pictured republics and principalities\nwhich in fact have never been known or seen, because how one lives is\nso far distant from how one ought to live, that he who neglects what is\ndone for what ought to be done, sooner effects his ruin than his\npreservation; for a man who wishes to act entirely up to his\nprofessions of virtue soon meets with what destroys him among so much\nthat is evil.\nHence it is necessary for a prince wishing to hold his own to know how\nto do wrong, and to make use of it or not according to necessity.\nTherefore, putting on one side imaginary things concerning a prince,\nand discussing those which are real, I say that all men when they are\nspoken of, and chiefly princes for being more highly placed, are\nremarkable for some of those qualities which bring them either blame or\npraise; and thus it is that one is reputed liberal, another miserly,\nusing a Tuscan term (because an avaricious person in our language is\nstill he who desires to possess by robbery, whilst we call one miserly\nwho deprives himself too much of the use of his own); one is reputed\ngenerous, one rapacious; one cruel, one compassionate; one faithless,\nanother faithful; one effeminate and cowardly, another bold and brave;\none affable, another haughty; one lascivious, another chaste; one\nsincere, another cunning; one hard, another easy; one grave, another\nfrivolous; one religious, another unbelieving, and the like. And I know\nthat every one will confess that it would be most praiseworthy in a\nprince to exhibit all the above qualities that are considered good; but\nbecause they can neither be entirely possessed nor observed, for human\nconditions do not permit it, it is necessary for him to be sufficiently\nprudent that he may know how to avoid the reproach of those vices which\nwould lose him his state; and also to keep himself, if it be possible,\nfrom those which would not lose him it; but this not being possible, he\nmay with less hesitation abandon himself to them. And again, he need\nnot make himself uneasy at incurring a reproach for those vices without\nwhich the state can only be saved with difficulty, for if everything is\nconsidered carefully, it will be found that something which looks like\nvirtue, if followed, would be his ruin; whilst something else, which\nlooks like vice, yet followed brings him security and prosperity.\nCHAPTER XVI.\nCONCERNING LIBERALITY AND MEANNESS\nCommencing then with the first of the above-named characteristics, I\nsay that it would be well to be reputed liberal. Nevertheless,\nliberality exercised in a way that does not bring you the reputation\nfor it, injures you; for if one exercises it honestly and as it should\nbe exercised, it may not become known, and you will not avoid the\nreproach of its opposite. Therefore, any one wishing to maintain among\nmen the name of liberal is obliged to avoid no attribute of\nmagnificence; so that a prince thus inclined will consume in such acts\nall his property, and will be compelled in the end, if he wish to\nmaintain the name of liberal, to unduly weigh down his people, and tax\nthem, and do everything he can to get money. This will soon make him\nodious to his subjects, and becoming poor he will be little valued by\nany one; thus, with his liberality, having offended many and rewarded\nfew, he is affected by the very first trouble and imperilled by\nwhatever may be the first danger; recognizing this himself, and wishing\nto draw back from it, he runs at once into the reproach of being\nmiserly.\nTherefore, a prince, not being able to exercise this virtue of\nliberality in such a way that it is recognized, except to his cost, if\nhe is wise he ought not to fear the reputation of being mean, for in\ntime he will come to be more considered than if liberal, seeing that\nwith his economy his revenues are enough, that he can defend himself\nagainst all attacks, and is able to engage in enterprises without\nburdening his people; thus it comes to pass that he exercises\nliberality towards all from whom he does not take, who are numberless,\nand meanness towards those to whom he does not give, who are few.\nWe have not seen great things done in our time except by those who have\nbeen considered mean; the rest have failed. Pope Julius the Second was\nassisted in reaching the papacy by a reputation for liberality, yet he\ndid not strive afterwards to keep it up, when he made war on the King\nof France; and he made many wars without imposing any extraordinary tax\non his subjects, for he supplied his additional expenses out of his\nlong thriftiness. The present King of Spain would not have undertaken\nor conquered in so many enterprises if he had been reputed liberal. A\nprince, therefore, provided that he has not to rob his subjects, that\nhe can defend himself, that he does not become poor and abject, that he\nis not forced to become rapacious, ought to hold of little account a\nreputation for being mean, for it is one of those vices which will\nenable him to govern.\nAnd if any one should say: Caesar obtained empire by liberality, and\nmany others have reached the highest positions by having been liberal,\nand by being considered so, I answer: Either you are a prince in fact,\nor in a way to become one. In the first case this liberality is\ndangerous, in the second it is very necessary to be considered liberal;\nand Caesar was one of those who wished to become pre-eminent in Rome;\nbut if he had survived after becoming so, and had not moderated his\nexpenses, he would have destroyed his government. And if any one should\nreply: Many have been princes, and have done great things with armies,\nwho have been considered very liberal, I reply: Either a prince spends\nthat which is his own or his subjects\u2019 or else that of others. In the\nfirst case he ought to be sparing, in the second he ought not to\nneglect any opportunity for liberality. And to the prince who goes\nforth with his army, supporting it by pillage, sack, and extortion,\nhandling that which belongs to others, this liberality is necessary,\notherwise he would not be followed by soldiers. And of that which is\nneither yours nor your subjects\u2019 you can be a ready giver, as were\nCyrus, Caesar, and Alexander; because it does not take away your\nreputation if you squander that of others, but adds to it; it is only\nsquandering your own that injures you.\nAnd there is nothing wastes so rapidly as liberality, for even whilst\nyou exercise it you lose the power to do so, and so become either poor\nor despised, or else, in avoiding poverty, rapacious and hated. And a\nprince should guard himself, above all things, against being despised\nand hated; and liberality leads you to both. Therefore it is wiser to\nhave a reputation for meanness which brings reproach without hatred,\nthan to be compelled through seeking a reputation for liberality to\nincur a name for rapacity which begets reproach with hatred.\nCHAPTER XVII.\nCONCERNING CRUELTY AND CLEMENCY, AND WHETHER IT IS BETTER TO BE LOVED\nTHAN FEARED\nComing now to the other qualities mentioned above, I say that every\nprince ought to desire to be considered clement and not cruel.\nNevertheless he ought to take care not to misuse this clemency. Cesare\nBorgia was considered cruel; notwithstanding, his cruelty reconciled\nthe Romagna, unified it, and restored it to peace and loyalty. And if\nthis be rightly considered, he will be seen to have been much more\nmerciful than the Florentine people, who, to avoid a reputation for\ncruelty, permitted Pistoia to be destroyed.[1] Therefore a prince, so\nlong as he keeps his subjects united and loyal, ought not to mind the\nreproach of cruelty; because with a few examples he will be more\nmerciful than those who, through too much mercy, allow disorders to\narise, from which follow murders or robberies; for these are wont to\ninjure the whole people, whilst those executions which originate with a\nprince offend the individual only.\n[1] During the rioting between the Cancellieri and Panciatichi\nfactions in 1502 and 1503.\nAnd of all princes, it is impossible for the new prince to avoid the\nimputation of cruelty, owing to new states being full of dangers. Hence\nVirgil, through the mouth of Dido, excuses the inhumanity of her reign\nowing to its being new, saying:\n\u201cRes dura, et regni novitas me talia cogunt\nMoliri, et late fines custode tueri.\u201d[2]\nNevertheless he ought to be slow to believe and to act, nor should he\nhimself show fear, but proceed in a temperate manner with prudence and\nhumanity, so that too much confidence may not make him incautious and\ntoo much distrust render him intolerable.\n[2] . . . against my will, my fate\nA throne unsettled, and an infant state,\nBid me defend my realms with all my pow\u2019rs,\nAnd guard with these severities my shores.\nChristopher Pitt.\nUpon this a question arises: whether it be better to be loved than\nfeared or feared than loved? It may be answered that one should wish to\nbe both, but, because it is difficult to unite them in one person, it\nis much safer to be feared than loved, when, of the two, either must be\ndispensed with. Because this is to be asserted in general of men, that\nthey are ungrateful, fickle, false, cowardly, covetous, and as long as\nyou succeed they are yours entirely; they will offer you their blood,\nproperty, life, and children, as is said above, when the need is far\ndistant; but when it approaches they turn against you. And that prince\nwho, relying entirely on their promises, has neglected other\nprecautions, is ruined; because friendships that are obtained by\npayments, and not by greatness or nobility of mind, may indeed be\nearned, but they are not secured, and in time of need cannot be relied\nupon; and men have less scruple in offending one who is beloved than\none who is feared, for love is preserved by the link of obligation\nwhich, owing to the baseness of men, is broken at every opportunity for\ntheir advantage; but fear preserves you by a dread of punishment which\nnever fails.\nNevertheless a prince ought to inspire fear in such a way that, if he\ndoes not win love, he avoids hatred; because he can endure very well\nbeing feared whilst he is not hated, which will always be as long as he\nabstains from the property of his citizens and subjects and from their\nwomen. But when it is necessary for him to proceed against the life of\nsomeone, he must do it on proper justification and for manifest cause,\nbut above all things he must keep his hands off the property of others,\nbecause men more quickly forget the death of their father than the loss\nof their patrimony. Besides, pretexts for taking away the property are\nnever wanting; for he who has once begun to live by robbery will always\nfind pretexts for seizing what belongs to others; but reasons for\ntaking life, on the contrary, are more difficult to find and sooner\nlapse. But when a prince is with his army, and has under control a\nmultitude of soldiers, then it is quite necessary for him to disregard\nthe reputation of cruelty, for without it he would never hold his army\nunited or disposed to its duties.\nAmong the wonderful deeds of Hannibal this one is enumerated: that\nhaving led an enormous army, composed of many various races of men, to\nfight in foreign lands, no dissensions arose either among them or\nagainst the prince, whether in his bad or in his good fortune. This\narose from nothing else than his inhuman cruelty, which, with his\nboundless valour, made him revered and terrible in the sight of his\nsoldiers, but without that cruelty, his other virtues were not\nsufficient to produce this effect. And short-sighted writers admire his\ndeeds from one point of view and from another condemn the principal\ncause of them. That it is true his other virtues would not have been\nsufficient for him may be proved by the case of Scipio, that most\nexcellent man, not only of his own times but within the memory of man,\nagainst whom, nevertheless, his army rebelled in Spain; this arose from\nnothing but his too great forbearance, which gave his soldiers more\nlicense than is consistent with military discipline. For this he was\nupbraided in the Senate by Fabius Maximus, and called the corrupter of\nthe Roman soldiery. The Locrians were laid waste by a legate of Scipio,\nyet they were not avenged by him, nor was the insolence of the legate\npunished, owing entirely to his easy nature. Insomuch that someone in\nthe Senate, wishing to excuse him, said there were many men who knew\nmuch better how not to err than to correct the errors of others. This\ndisposition, if he had been continued in the command, would have\ndestroyed in time the fame and glory of Scipio; but, he being under the\ncontrol of the Senate, this injurious characteristic not only concealed\nitself, but contributed to his glory.\nReturning to the question of being feared or loved, I come to the\nconclusion that, men loving according to their own will and fearing\naccording to that of the prince, a wise prince should establish himself\non that which is in his own control and not in that of others; he must\nendeavour only to avoid hatred, as is noted.\nCHAPTER XVIII.[1]\nCONCERNING THE WAY IN WHICH PRINCES SHOULD KEEP FAITH\n[1] \u201cThe present chapter has given greater offence than any other\nportion of Machiavelli\u2019s writings.\u201d Burd, \u201cIl Principe,\u201d p. 297.\nEvery one admits how praiseworthy it is in a prince to keep faith, and\nto live with integrity and not with craft. Nevertheless our experience\nhas been that those princes who have done great things have held good\nfaith of little account, and have known how to circumvent the intellect\nof men by craft, and in the end have overcome those who have relied on\ntheir word. You must know there are two ways of contesting,[2] the one\nby the law, the other by force; the first method is proper to men, the\nsecond to beasts; but because the first is frequently not sufficient,\nit is necessary to have recourse to the second. Therefore it is\nnecessary for a prince to understand how to avail himself of the beast\nand the man. This has been figuratively taught to princes by ancient\nwriters, who describe how Achilles and many other princes of old were\ngiven to the Centaur Chiron to nurse, who brought them up in his\ndiscipline; which means solely that, as they had for a teacher one who\nwas half beast and half man, so it is necessary for a prince to know\nhow to make use of both natures, and that one without the other is not\ndurable. A prince, therefore, being compelled knowingly to adopt the\nbeast, ought to choose the fox and the lion; because the lion cannot\ndefend himself against snares and the fox cannot defend himself against\nwolves. Therefore, it is necessary to be a fox to discover the snares\nand a lion to terrify the wolves. Those who rely simply on the lion do\nnot understand what they are about. Therefore a wise lord cannot, nor\nought he to, keep faith when such observance may be turned against him,\nand when the reasons that caused him to pledge it exist no longer. If\nmen were entirely good this precept would not hold, but because they\nare bad, and will not keep faith with you, you too are not bound to\nobserve it with them. Nor will there ever be wanting to a prince\nlegitimate reasons to excuse this non-observance. Of this endless\nmodern examples could be given, showing how many treaties and\nengagements have been made void and of no effect through the\nfaithlessness of princes; and he who has known best how to employ the\nfox has succeeded best.\n[2] \u201cContesting,\u201d _i.e_. \u201cstriving for mastery.\u201d Mr Burd points out\nthat this passage is imitated directly from Cicero\u2019s \u201cDe Officiis\u201d:\n\u201cNam cum sint duo genera decertandi, unum per disceptationem, alterum\nper vim; cumque illud proprium sit hominis, hoc beluarum; confugiendum\nest ad posterius, si uti non licet superiore.\u201d\nBut it is necessary to know well how to disguise this characteristic,\nand to be a great pretender and dissembler; and men are so simple, and\nso subject to present necessities, that he who seeks to deceive will\nalways find someone who will allow himself to be deceived. One recent\nexample I cannot pass over in silence. Alexander the Sixth did nothing\nelse but deceive men, nor ever thought of doing otherwise, and he\nalways found victims; for there never was a man who had greater power\nin asserting, or who with greater oaths would affirm a thing, yet would\nobserve it less; nevertheless his deceits always succeeded according to\nhis wishes,[3] because he well understood this side of mankind.\n[3] \u201cNondimanco sempre gli succederono gli inganni (ad votum).\u201d The\nwords \u201cad votum\u201d are omitted in the Testina addition, 1550.\nAlexander never did what he said,\nCesare never said what he did.\nItalian Proverb.\nTherefore it is unnecessary for a prince to have all the good qualities\nI have enumerated, but it is very necessary to appear to have them. And\nI shall dare to say this also, that to have them and always to observe\nthem is injurious, and that to appear to have them is useful; to appear\nmerciful, faithful, humane, religious, upright, and to be so, but with\na mind so framed that should you require not to be so, you may be able\nand know how to change to the opposite.\nAnd you have to understand this, that a prince, especially a new one,\ncannot observe all those things for which men are esteemed, being often\nforced, in order to maintain the state, to act contrary to fidelity,[4]\nfriendship, humanity, and religion. Therefore it is necessary for him\nto have a mind ready to turn itself accordingly as the winds and\nvariations of fortune force it, yet, as I have said above, not to\ndiverge from the good if he can avoid doing so, but, if compelled, then\nto know how to set about it.\n[4] \u201cContrary to fidelity\u201d or \u201cfaith,\u201d \u201ccontro alla fede,\u201d and \u201ctutto\nfede,\u201d \u201caltogether faithful,\u201d in the next paragraph. It is noteworthy\nthat these two phrases, \u201ccontro alla fede\u201d and \u201ctutto fede,\u201d were\nomitted in the Testina edition, which was published with the sanction\nof the papal authorities. It may be that the meaning attached to the\nword \u201cfede\u201d was \u201cthe faith,\u201d _i.e_. the Catholic creed, and not as\nrendered here \u201cfidelity\u201d and \u201cfaithful.\u201d Observe that the word\n\u201creligione\u201d was suffered to stand in the text of the Testina, being\nused to signify indifferently every shade of belief, as witness \u201cthe\nreligion,\u201d a phrase inevitably employed to designate the Huguenot\nheresy. South in his Sermon IX, p. 69, ed. 1843, comments on this\npassage as follows: \u201cThat great patron and Coryphaeus of this tribe,\nNicolo Machiavel, laid down this for a master rule in his political\nscheme: \u2018That the show of religion was helpful to the politician, but\nthe reality of it hurtful and pernicious.\u2019\u201d\nFor this reason a prince ought to take care that he never lets anything\nslip from his lips that is not replete with the above-named five\nqualities, that he may appear to him who sees and hears him altogether\nmerciful, faithful, humane, upright, and religious. There is nothing\nmore necessary to appear to have than this last quality, inasmuch as\nmen judge generally more by the eye than by the hand, because it\nbelongs to everybody to see you, to few to come in touch with you.\nEvery one sees what you appear to be, few really know what you are, and\nthose few dare not oppose themselves to the opinion of the many, who\nhave the majesty of the state to defend them; and in the actions of all\nmen, and especially of princes, which it is not prudent to challenge,\none judges by the result.\nFor that reason, let a prince have the credit of conquering and holding\nhis state, the means will always be considered honest, and he will be\npraised by everybody; because the vulgar are always taken by what a\nthing seems to be and by what comes of it; and in the world there are\nonly the vulgar, for the few find a place there only when the many have\nno ground to rest on.\nOne prince[5] of the present time, whom it is not well to name, never\npreaches anything else but peace and good faith, and to both he is most\nhostile, and either, if he had kept it, would have deprived him of\nreputation and kingdom many a time.\n[5] Ferdinand of Aragon. \u201cWhen Machiavelli was writing _The Prince_ it\nwould have been clearly impossible to mention Ferdinand\u2019s name here\nwithout giving offence.\u201d Burd\u2019s \u201cIl Principe,\u201d p. 308.\nCHAPTER XIX.\nTHAT ONE SHOULD AVOID BEING DESPISED AND HATED\nNow, concerning the characteristics of which mention is made above, I\nhave spoken of the more important ones, the others I wish to discuss\nbriefly under this generality, that the prince must consider, as has\nbeen in part said before, how to avoid those things which will make him\nhated or contemptible; and as often as he shall have succeeded he will\nhave fulfilled his part, and he need not fear any danger in other\nreproaches.\nIt makes him hated above all things, as I have said, to be rapacious,\nand to be a violator of the property and women of his subjects, from\nboth of which he must abstain. And when neither their property nor\ntheir honor is touched, the majority of men live content, and he has\nonly to contend with the ambition of a few, whom he can curb with ease\nin many ways.\nIt makes him contemptible to be considered fickle, frivolous,\neffeminate, mean-spirited, irresolute, from all of which a prince\nshould guard himself as from a rock; and he should endeavour to show in\nhis actions greatness, courage, gravity, and fortitude; and in his\nprivate dealings with his subjects let him show that his judgments are\nirrevocable, and maintain himself in such reputation that no one can\nhope either to deceive him or to get round him.\nThat prince is highly esteemed who conveys this impression of himself,\nand he who is highly esteemed is not easily conspired against; for,\nprovided it is well known that he is an excellent man and revered by\nhis people, he can only be attacked with difficulty. For this reason a\nprince ought to have two fears, one from within, on account of his\nsubjects, the other from without, on account of external powers. From\nthe latter he is defended by being well armed and having good allies,\nand if he is well armed he will have good friends, and affairs will\nalways remain quiet within when they are quiet without, unless they\nshould have been already disturbed by conspiracy; and even should\naffairs outside be disturbed, if he has carried out his preparations\nand has lived as I have said, as long as he does not despair, he will\nresist every attack, as I said Nabis the Spartan did.\nBut concerning his subjects, when affairs outside are disturbed he has\nonly to fear that they will conspire secretly, from which a prince can\neasily secure himself by avoiding being hated and despised, and by\nkeeping the people satisfied with him, which it is most necessary for\nhim to accomplish, as I said above at length. And one of the most\nefficacious remedies that a prince can have against conspiracies is not\nto be hated and despised by the people, for he who conspires against a\nprince always expects to please them by his removal; but when the\nconspirator can only look forward to offending them, he will not have\nthe courage to take such a course, for the difficulties that confront a\nconspirator are infinite. And as experience shows, many have been the\nconspiracies, but few have been successful; because he who conspires\ncannot act alone, nor can he take a companion except from those whom he\nbelieves to be malcontents, and as soon as you have opened your mind to\na malcontent you have given him the material with which to content\nhimself, for by denouncing you he can look for every advantage; so\nthat, seeing the gain from this course to be assured, and seeing the\nother to be doubtful and full of dangers, he must be a very rare\nfriend, or a thoroughly obstinate enemy of the prince, to keep faith\nwith you.\nAnd, to reduce the matter into a small compass, I say that, on the side\nof the conspirator, there is nothing but fear, jealousy, prospect of\npunishment to terrify him; but on the side of the prince there is the\nmajesty of the principality, the laws, the protection of friends and\nthe state to defend him; so that, adding to all these things the\npopular goodwill, it is impossible that any one should be so rash as to\nconspire. For whereas in general the conspirator has to fear before the\nexecution of his plot, in this case he has also to fear the sequel to\nthe crime; because on account of it he has the people for an enemy, and\nthus cannot hope for any escape.\nEndless examples could be given on this subject, but I will be content\nwith one, brought to pass within the memory of our fathers. Messer\nAnnibale Bentivogli, who was prince in Bologna (grandfather of the\npresent Annibale), having been murdered by the Canneschi, who had\nconspired against him, not one of his family survived but Messer\nGiovanni,[1] who was in childhood: immediately after his assassination\nthe people rose and murdered all the Canneschi. This sprung from the\npopular goodwill which the house of Bentivogli enjoyed in those days in\nBologna; which was so great that, although none remained there after\nthe death of Annibale who was able to rule the state, the Bolognese,\nhaving information that there was one of the Bentivogli family in\nFlorence, who up to that time had been considered the son of a\nblacksmith, sent to Florence for him and gave him the government of\ntheir city, and it was ruled by him until Messer Giovanni came in due\ncourse to the government.\n[1] Giovanni Bentivogli, born in Bologna 1438, died at Milan 1508. He\nruled Bologna from 1462 to 1506. Machiavelli\u2019s strong condemnation of\nconspiracies may get its edge from his own very recent experience\n(February 1513), when he had been arrested and tortured for his\nalleged complicity in the Boscoli conspiracy.\nFor this reason I consider that a prince ought to reckon conspiracies\nof little account when his people hold him in esteem; but when it is\nhostile to him, and bears hatred towards him, he ought to fear\neverything and everybody. And well-ordered states and wise princes have\ntaken every care not to drive the nobles to desperation, and to keep\nthe people satisfied and contented, for this is one of the most\nimportant objects a prince can have.\nAmong the best ordered and governed kingdoms of our times is France,\nand in it are found many good institutions on which depend the liberty\nand security of the king; of these the first is the parliament and its\nauthority, because he who founded the kingdom, knowing the ambition of\nthe nobility and their boldness, considered that a bit to their mouths\nwould be necessary to hold them in; and, on the other side, knowing the\nhatred of the people, founded in fear, against the nobles, he wished to\nprotect them, yet he was not anxious for this to be the particular care\nof the king; therefore, to take away the reproach which he would be\nliable to from the nobles for favouring the people, and from the people\nfor favouring the nobles, he set up an arbiter, who should be one who\ncould beat down the great and favour the lesser without reproach to the\nking. Neither could you have a better or a more prudent arrangement, or\na greater source of security to the king and kingdom. From this one can\ndraw another important conclusion, that princes ought to leave affairs\nof reproach to the management of others, and keep those of grace in\ntheir own hands. And further, I consider that a prince ought to cherish\nthe nobles, but not so as to make himself hated by the people.\nIt may appear, perhaps, to some who have examined the lives and deaths\nof the Roman emperors that many of them would be an example contrary to\nmy opinion, seeing that some of them lived nobly and showed great\nqualities of soul, nevertheless they have lost their empire or have\nbeen killed by subjects who have conspired against them. Wishing,\ntherefore, to answer these objections, I will recall the characters of\nsome of the emperors, and will show that the causes of their ruin were\nnot different to those alleged by me; at the same time I will only\nsubmit for consideration those things that are noteworthy to him who\nstudies the affairs of those times.\nIt seems to me sufficient to take all those emperors who succeeded to\nthe empire from Marcus the philosopher down to Maximinus; they were\nMarcus and his son Commodus, Pertinax, Julian, Severus and his son\nAntoninus Caracalla, Macrinus, Heliogabalus, Alexander, and Maximinus.\nThere is first to note that, whereas in other principalities the\nambition of the nobles and the insolence of the people only have to be\ncontended with, the Roman emperors had a third difficulty in having to\nput up with the cruelty and avarice of their soldiers, a matter so\nbeset with difficulties that it was the ruin of many; for it was a hard\nthing to give satisfaction both to soldiers and people; because the\npeople loved peace, and for this reason they loved the unaspiring\nprince, whilst the soldiers loved the warlike prince who was bold,\ncruel, and rapacious, which qualities they were quite willing he should\nexercise upon the people, so that they could get double pay and give\nvent to their own greed and cruelty. Hence it arose that those emperors\nwere always overthrown who, either by birth or training, had no great\nauthority, and most of them, especially those who came new to the\nprincipality, recognizing the difficulty of these two opposing humours,\nwere inclined to give satisfaction to the soldiers, caring little about\ninjuring the people. Which course was necessary, because, as princes\ncannot help being hated by someone, they ought, in the first place, to\navoid being hated by every one, and when they cannot compass this, they\nought to endeavour with the utmost diligence to avoid the hatred of the\nmost powerful. Therefore, those emperors who through inexperience had\nneed of special favour adhered more readily to the soldiers than to the\npeople; a course which turned out advantageous to them or not,\naccordingly as the prince knew how to maintain authority over them.\nFrom these causes it arose that Marcus, Pertinax, and Alexander, being\nall men of modest life, lovers of justice, enemies to cruelty, humane,\nand benignant, came to a sad end except Marcus; he alone lived and died\nhonoured, because he had succeeded to the throne by hereditary title,\nand owed nothing either to the soldiers or the people; and afterwards,\nbeing possessed of many virtues which made him respected, he always\nkept both orders in their places whilst he lived, and was neither hated\nnor despised.\nBut Pertinax was created emperor against the wishes of the soldiers,\nwho, being accustomed to live licentiously under Commodus, could not\nendure the honest life to which Pertinax wished to reduce them; thus,\nhaving given cause for hatred, to which hatred there was added contempt\nfor his old age, he was overthrown at the very beginning of his\nadministration. And here it should be noted that hatred is acquired as\nmuch by good works as by bad ones, therefore, as I said before, a\nprince wishing to keep his state is very often forced to do evil; for\nwhen that body is corrupt whom you think you have need of to maintain\nyourself\u2014it may be either the people or the soldiers or the nobles\u2014you\nhave to submit to its humours and to gratify them, and then good works\nwill do you harm.\nBut let us come to Alexander, who was a man of such great goodness,\nthat among the other praises which are accorded him is this, that in\nthe fourteen years he held the empire no one was ever put to death by\nhim unjudged; nevertheless, being considered effeminate and a man who\nallowed himself to be governed by his mother, he became despised, the\narmy conspired against him, and murdered him.\nTurning now to the opposite characters of Commodus, Severus, Antoninus\nCaracalla, and Maximinus, you will find them all cruel and\nrapacious-men who, to satisfy their soldiers, did not hesitate to\ncommit every kind of iniquity against the people; and all, except\nSeverus, came to a bad end; but in Severus there was so much valour\nthat, keeping the soldiers friendly, although the people were oppressed\nby him, he reigned successfully; for his valour made him so much\nadmired in the sight of the soldiers and people that the latter were\nkept in a way astonished and awed and the former respectful and\nsatisfied. And because the actions of this man, as a new prince, were\ngreat, I wish to show briefly that he knew well how to counterfeit the\nfox and the lion, which natures, as I said above, it is necessary for a\nprince to imitate.\nKnowing the sloth of the Emperor Julian, he persuaded the army in\nSclavonia, of which he was captain, that it would be right to go to\nRome and avenge the death of Pertinax, who had been killed by the\npraetorian soldiers; and under this pretext, without appearing to\naspire to the throne, he moved the army on Rome, and reached Italy\nbefore it was known that he had started. On his arrival at Rome, the\nSenate, through fear, elected him emperor and killed Julian. After this\nthere remained for Severus, who wished to make himself master of the\nwhole empire, two difficulties; one in Asia, where Niger, head of the\nAsiatic army, had caused himself to be proclaimed emperor; the other in\nthe west where Albinus was, who also aspired to the throne. And as he\nconsidered it dangerous to declare himself hostile to both, he decided\nto attack Niger and to deceive Albinus. To the latter he wrote that,\nbeing elected emperor by the Senate, he was willing to share that\ndignity with him and sent him the title of Caesar; and, moreover, that\nthe Senate had made Albinus his colleague; which things were accepted\nby Albinus as true. But after Severus had conquered and killed Niger,\nand settled oriental affairs, he returned to Rome and complained to the\nSenate that Albinus, little recognizing the benefits that he had\nreceived from him, had by treachery sought to murder him, and for this\ningratitude he was compelled to punish him. Afterwards he sought him\nout in France, and took from him his government and life. He who will,\ntherefore, carefully examine the actions of this man will find him a\nmost valiant lion and a most cunning fox; he will find him feared and\nrespected by every one, and not hated by the army; and it need not be\nwondered at that he, a new man, was able to hold the empire so well,\nbecause his supreme renown always protected him from that hatred which\nthe people might have conceived against him for his violence.\nBut his son Antoninus was a most eminent man, and had very excellent\nqualities, which made him admirable in the sight of the people and\nacceptable to the soldiers, for he was a warlike man, most enduring of\nfatigue, a despiser of all delicate food and other luxuries, which\ncaused him to be beloved by the armies. Nevertheless, his ferocity and\ncruelties were so great and so unheard of that, after endless single\nmurders, he killed a large number of the people of Rome and all those\nof Alexandria. He became hated by the whole world, and also feared by\nthose he had around him, to such an extent that he was murdered in the\nmidst of his army by a centurion. And here it must be noted that\nsuch-like deaths, which are deliberately inflicted with a resolved and\ndesperate courage, cannot be avoided by princes, because any one who\ndoes not fear to die can inflict them; but a prince may fear them the\nless because they are very rare; he has only to be careful not to do\nany grave injury to those whom he employs or has around him in the\nservice of the state. Antoninus had not taken this care, but had\ncontumeliously killed a brother of that centurion, whom also he daily\nthreatened, yet retained in his bodyguard; which, as it turned out, was\na rash thing to do, and proved the emperor\u2019s ruin.\nBut let us come to Commodus, to whom it should have been very easy to\nhold the empire, for, being the son of Marcus, he had inherited it, and\nhe had only to follow in the footsteps of his father to please his\npeople and soldiers; but, being by nature cruel and brutal, he gave\nhimself up to amusing the soldiers and corrupting them, so that he\nmight indulge his rapacity upon the people; on the other hand, not\nmaintaining his dignity, often descending to the theatre to compete\nwith gladiators, and doing other vile things, little worthy of the\nimperial majesty, he fell into contempt with the soldiers, and being\nhated by one party and despised by the other, he was conspired against\nand was killed.\nIt remains to discuss the character of Maximinus. He was a very warlike\nman, and the armies, being disgusted with the effeminacy of Alexander,\nof whom I have already spoken, killed him and elected Maximinus to the\nthrone. This he did not possess for long, for two things made him hated\nand despised; the one, his having kept sheep in Thrace, which brought\nhim into contempt (it being well known to all, and considered a great\nindignity by every one), and the other, his having at the accession to\nhis dominions deferred going to Rome and taking possession of the\nimperial seat; he had also gained a reputation for the utmost ferocity\nby having, through his prefects in Rome and elsewhere in the empire,\npractised many cruelties, so that the whole world was moved to anger at\nthe meanness of his birth and to fear at his barbarity. First Africa\nrebelled, then the Senate with all the people of Rome, and all Italy\nconspired against him, to which may be added his own army; this latter,\nbesieging Aquileia and meeting with difficulties in taking it, were\ndisgusted with his cruelties, and fearing him less when they found so\nmany against him, murdered him.\nI do not wish to discuss Heliogabalus, Macrinus, or Julian, who, being\nthoroughly contemptible, were quickly wiped out; but I will bring this\ndiscourse to a conclusion by saying that princes in our times have this\ndifficulty of giving inordinate satisfaction to their soldiers in a far\nless degree, because, notwithstanding one has to give them some\nindulgence, that is soon done; none of these princes have armies that\nare veterans in the governance and administration of provinces, as were\nthe armies of the Roman Empire; and whereas it was then more necessary\nto give satisfaction to the soldiers than to the people, it is now more\nnecessary to all princes, except the Turk and the Soldan, to satisfy\nthe people rather the soldiers, because the people are the more\npowerful.\nFrom the above I have excepted the Turk, who always keeps round him\ntwelve thousand infantry and fifteen thousand cavalry on which depend\nthe security and strength of the kingdom, and it is necessary that,\nputting aside every consideration for the people, he should keep them\nhis friends. The kingdom of the Soldan is similar; being entirely in\nthe hands of soldiers, it follows again that, without regard to the\npeople, he must keep them his friends. But you must note that the state\nof the Soldan is unlike all other principalities, for the reason that\nit is like the Christian pontificate, which cannot be called either an\nhereditary or a newly formed principality; because the sons of the old\nprince are not the heirs, but he who is elected to that position by\nthose who have authority, and the sons remain only noblemen. And this\nbeing an ancient custom, it cannot be called a new principality,\nbecause there are none of those difficulties in it that are met with in\nnew ones; for although the prince is new, the constitution of the state\nis old, and it is framed so as to receive him as if he were its\nhereditary lord.\nBut returning to the subject of our discourse, I say that whoever will\nconsider it will acknowledge that either hatred or contempt has been\nfatal to the above-named emperors, and it will be recognized also how\nit happened that, a number of them acting in one way and a number in\nanother, only one in each way came to a happy end and the rest to\nunhappy ones. Because it would have been useless and dangerous for\nPertinax and Alexander, being new princes, to imitate Marcus, who was\nheir to the principality; and likewise it would have been utterly\ndestructive to Caracalla, Commodus, and Maximinus to have imitated\nSeverus, they not having sufficient valour to enable them to tread in\nhis footsteps. Therefore a prince, new to the principality, cannot\nimitate the actions of Marcus, nor, again, is it necessary to follow\nthose of Severus, but he ought to take from Severus those parts which\nare necessary to found his state, and from Marcus those which are\nproper and glorious to keep a state that may already be stable and\nfirm.\nCHAPTER XX.\nARE FORTRESSES, AND MANY OTHER THINGS TO WHICH PRINCES OFTEN RESORT,\nADVANTAGEOUS OR HURTFUL?\n1. Some princes, so as to hold securely the state, have disarmed their\nsubjects; others have kept their subject towns distracted by factions;\nothers have fostered enmities against themselves; others have laid\nthemselves out to gain over those whom they distrusted in the beginning\nof their governments; some have built fortresses; some have overthrown\nand destroyed them. And although one cannot give a final judgment on\nall of these things unless one possesses the particulars of those\nstates in which a decision has to be made, nevertheless I will speak as\ncomprehensively as the matter of itself will admit.\n2. There never was a new prince who has disarmed his subjects; rather\nwhen he has found them disarmed he has always armed them, because, by\narming them, those arms become yours, those men who were distrusted\nbecome faithful, and those who were faithful are kept so, and your\nsubjects become your adherents. And whereas all subjects cannot be\narmed, yet when those whom you do arm are benefited, the others can be\nhandled more freely, and this difference in their treatment, which they\nquite understand, makes the former your dependents, and the latter,\nconsidering it to be necessary that those who have the most danger and\nservice should have the most reward, excuse you. But when you disarm\nthem, you at once offend them by showing that you distrust them, either\nfor cowardice or for want of loyalty, and either of these opinions\nbreeds hatred against you. And because you cannot remain unarmed, it\nfollows that you turn to mercenaries, which are of the character\nalready shown; even if they should be good they would not be sufficient\nto defend you against powerful enemies and distrusted subjects.\nTherefore, as I have said, a new prince in a new principality has\nalways distributed arms. Histories are full of examples. But when a\nprince acquires a new state, which he adds as a province to his old\none, then it is necessary to disarm the men of that state, except those\nwho have been his adherents in acquiring it; and these again, with time\nand opportunity, should be rendered soft and effeminate; and matters\nshould be managed in such a way that all the armed men in the state\nshall be your own soldiers who in your old state were living near you.\n3. Our forefathers, and those who were reckoned wise, were accustomed\nto say that it was necessary to hold Pistoia by factions and Pisa by\nfortresses; and with this idea they fostered quarrels in some of their\ntributary towns so as to keep possession of them the more easily. This\nmay have been well enough in those times when Italy was in a way\nbalanced, but I do not believe that it can be accepted as a precept for\nto-day, because I do not believe that factions can ever be of use;\nrather it is certain that when the enemy comes upon you in divided\ncities you are quickly lost, because the weakest party will always\nassist the outside forces and the other will not be able to resist. The\nVenetians, moved, as I believe, by the above reasons, fostered the\nGuelph and Ghibelline factions in their tributary cities; and although\nthey never allowed them to come to bloodshed, yet they nursed these\ndisputes amongst them, so that the citizens, distracted by their\ndifferences, should not unite against them. Which, as we saw, did not\nafterwards turn out as expected, because, after the rout at Vaila, one\nparty at once took courage and seized the state. Such methods argue,\ntherefore, weakness in the prince, because these factions will never be\npermitted in a vigorous principality; such methods for enabling one the\nmore easily to manage subjects are only useful in times of peace, but\nif war comes this policy proves fallacious.\n4. Without doubt princes become great when they overcome the\ndifficulties and obstacles by which they are confronted, and therefore\nfortune, especially when she desires to make a new prince great, who\nhas a greater necessity to earn renown than an hereditary one, causes\nenemies to arise and form designs against him, in order that he may\nhave the opportunity of overcoming them, and by them to mount higher,\nas by a ladder which his enemies have raised. For this reason many\nconsider that a wise prince, when he has the opportunity, ought with\ncraft to foster some animosity against himself, so that, having crushed\nit, his renown may rise higher.\n5. Princes, especially new ones, have found more fidelity and\nassistance in those men who in the beginning of their rule were\ndistrusted than among those who in the beginning were trusted. Pandolfo\nPetrucci, Prince of Siena, ruled his state more by those who had been\ndistrusted than by others. But on this question one cannot speak\ngenerally, for it varies so much with the individual; I will only say\nthis, that those men who at the commencement of a princedom have been\nhostile, if they are of a description to need assistance to support\nthemselves, can always be gained over with the greatest ease, and they\nwill be tightly held to serve the prince with fidelity, inasmuch as\nthey know it to be very necessary for them to cancel by deeds the bad\nimpression which he had formed of them; and thus the prince always\nextracts more profit from them than from those who, serving him in too\nmuch security, may neglect his affairs. And since the matter demands\nit, I must not fail to warn a prince, who by means of secret favours\nhas acquired a new state, that he must well consider the reasons which\ninduced those to favour him who did so; and if it be not a natural\naffection towards him, but only discontent with their government, then\nhe will only keep them friendly with great trouble and difficulty, for\nit will be impossible to satisfy them. And weighing well the reasons\nfor this in those examples which can be taken from ancient and modern\naffairs, we shall find that it is easier for the prince to make friends\nof those men who were contented under the former government, and are\ntherefore his enemies, than of those who, being discontented with it,\nwere favourable to him and encouraged him to seize it.\n6. It has been a custom with princes, in order to hold their states\nmore securely, to build fortresses that may serve as a bridle and bit\nto those who might design to work against them, and as a place of\nrefuge from a first attack. I praise this system because it has been\nmade use of formerly. Notwithstanding that, Messer Nicolo Vitelli in\nour times has been seen to demolish two fortresses in Citta di Castello\nso that he might keep that state; Guido Ubaldo, Duke of Urbino, on\nreturning to his dominion, whence he had been driven by Cesare Borgia,\nrazed to the foundations all the fortresses in that province, and\nconsidered that without them it would be more difficult to lose it; the\nBentivogli returning to Bologna came to a similar decision. Fortresses,\ntherefore, are useful or not according to circumstances; if they do you\ngood in one way they injure you in another. And this question can be\nreasoned thus: the prince who has more to fear from the people than\nfrom foreigners ought to build fortresses, but he who has more to fear\nfrom foreigners than from the people ought to leave them alone. The\ncastle of Milan, built by Francesco Sforza, has made, and will make,\nmore trouble for the house of Sforza than any other disorder in the\nstate. For this reason the best possible fortress is\u2014not to be hated by\nthe people, because, although you may hold the fortresses, yet they\nwill not save you if the people hate you, for there will never be\nwanting foreigners to assist a people who have taken arms against you.\nIt has not been seen in our times that such fortresses have been of use\nto any prince, unless to the Countess of Forli,[1] when the Count\nGirolamo, her consort, was killed; for by that means she was able to\nwithstand the popular attack and wait for assistance from Milan, and\nthus recover her state; and the posture of affairs was such at that\ntime that the foreigners could not assist the people. But fortresses\nwere of little value to her afterwards when Cesare Borgia attacked her,\nand when the people, her enemy, were allied with foreigners. Therefore,\nit would have been safer for her, both then and before, not to have\nbeen hated by the people than to have had the fortresses. All these\nthings considered then, I shall praise him who builds fortresses as\nwell as him who does not, and I shall blame whoever, trusting in them,\ncares little about being hated by the people.\n[1] Catherine Sforza, a daughter of Galeazzo Sforza and Lucrezia\nLandriani, born 1463, died 1509. It was to the Countess of Forli that\nMachiavelli was sent as envoy on 1499. A letter from Fortunati to the\ncountess announces the appointment: \u201cI have been with the signori,\u201d\nwrote Fortunati, \u201cto learn whom they would send and when. They tell me\nthat Nicolo Machiavelli, a learned young Florentine noble, secretary\nto my Lords of the Ten, is to leave with me at once.\u201d _Cf_. \u201cCatherine\nSforza,\u201d by Count Pasolini, translated by P. Sylvester, 1898.\nCHAPTER XXI.\nHOW A PRINCE SHOULD CONDUCT HIMSELF SO AS TO GAIN RENOWN\nNothing makes a prince so much esteemed as great enterprises and\nsetting a fine example. We have in our time Ferdinand of Aragon, the\npresent King of Spain. He can almost be called a new prince, because he\nhas risen, by fame and glory, from being an insignificant king to be\nthe foremost king in Christendom; and if you will consider his deeds\nyou will find them all great and some of them extraordinary. In the\nbeginning of his reign he attacked Granada, and this enterprise was the\nfoundation of his dominions. He did this quietly at first and without\nany fear of hindrance, for he held the minds of the barons of Castile\noccupied in thinking of the war and not anticipating any innovations;\nthus they did not perceive that by these means he was acquiring power\nand authority over them. He was able with the money of the Church and\nof the people to sustain his armies, and by that long war to lay the\nfoundation for the military skill which has since distinguished him.\nFurther, always using religion as a plea, so as to undertake greater\nschemes, he devoted himself with pious cruelty to driving out and\nclearing his kingdom of the Moors; nor could there be a more admirable\nexample, nor one more rare. Under this same cloak he assailed Africa,\nhe came down on Italy, he has finally attacked France; and thus his\nachievements and designs have always been great, and have kept the\nminds of his people in suspense and admiration and occupied with the\nissue of them. And his actions have arisen in such a way, one out of\nthe other, that men have never been given time to work steadily against\nhim.\nAgain, it much assists a prince to set unusual examples in internal\naffairs, similar to those which are related of Messer Bernabo da\nMilano, who, when he had the opportunity, by any one in civil life\ndoing some extraordinary thing, either good or bad, would take some\nmethod of rewarding or punishing him, which would be much spoken about.\nAnd a prince ought, above all things, always endeavour in every action\nto gain for himself the reputation of being a great and remarkable man.\nA prince is also respected when he is either a true friend or a\ndownright enemy, that is to say, when, without any reservation, he\ndeclares himself in favour of one party against the other; which course\nwill always be more advantageous than standing neutral; because if two\nof your powerful neighbours come to blows, they are of such a character\nthat, if one of them conquers, you have either to fear him or not. In\neither case it will always be more advantageous for you to declare\nyourself and to make war strenuously; because, in the first case, if\nyou do not declare yourself, you will invariably fall a prey to the\nconqueror, to the pleasure and satisfaction of him who has been\nconquered, and you will have no reasons to offer, nor anything to\nprotect or to shelter you. Because he who conquers does not want\ndoubtful friends who will not aid him in the time of trial; and he who\nloses will not harbour you because you did not willingly, sword in\nhand, court his fate.\nAntiochus went into Greece, being sent for by the \u00c6tolians to drive out\nthe Romans. He sent envoys to the Achaeans, who were friends of the\nRomans, exhorting them to remain neutral; and on the other hand the\nRomans urged them to take up arms. This question came to be discussed\nin the council of the Achaeans, where the legate of Antiochus urged\nthem to stand neutral. To this the Roman legate answered: \u201cAs for that\nwhich has been said, that it is better and more advantageous for your\nstate not to interfere in our war, nothing can be more erroneous;\nbecause by not interfering you will be left, without favour or\nconsideration, the guerdon of the conqueror.\u201d Thus it will always\nhappen that he who is not your friend will demand your neutrality,\nwhilst he who is your friend will entreat you to declare yourself with\narms. And irresolute princes, to avoid present dangers, generally\nfollow the neutral path, and are generally ruined. But when a prince\ndeclares himself gallantly in favour of one side, if the party with\nwhom he allies himself conquers, although the victor may be powerful\nand may have him at his mercy, yet he is indebted to him, and there is\nestablished a bond of amity; and men are never so shameless as to\nbecome a monument of ingratitude by oppressing you. Victories after all\nare never so complete that the victor must not show some regard,\nespecially to justice. But if he with whom you ally yourself loses, you\nmay be sheltered by him, and whilst he is able he may aid you, and you\nbecome companions on a fortune that may rise again.\nIn the second case, when those who fight are of such a character that\nyou have no anxiety as to who may conquer, so much the more is it\ngreater prudence to be allied, because you assist at the destruction of\none by the aid of another who, if he had been wise, would have saved\nhim; and conquering, as it is impossible that he should not do with\nyour assistance, he remains at your discretion. And here it is to be\nnoted that a prince ought to take care never to make an alliance with\none more powerful than himself for the purposes of attacking others,\nunless necessity compels him, as is said above; because if he conquers\nyou are at his discretion, and princes ought to avoid as much as\npossible being at the discretion of any one. The Venetians joined with\nFrance against the Duke of Milan, and this alliance, which caused their\nruin, could have been avoided. But when it cannot be avoided, as\nhappened to the Florentines when the Pope and Spain sent armies to\nattack Lombardy, then in such a case, for the above reasons, the prince\nought to favour one of the parties.\nNever let any Government imagine that it can choose perfectly safe\ncourses; rather let it expect to have to take very doubtful ones,\nbecause it is found in ordinary affairs that one never seeks to avoid\none trouble without running into another; but prudence consists in\nknowing how to distinguish the character of troubles, and for choice to\ntake the lesser evil.\nA prince ought also to show himself a patron of ability, and to honour\nthe proficient in every art. At the same time he should encourage his\ncitizens to practise their callings peaceably, both in commerce and\nagriculture, and in every other following, so that the one should not\nbe deterred from improving his possessions for fear lest they be taken\naway from him or another from opening up trade for fear of taxes; but\nthe prince ought to offer rewards to whoever wishes to do these things\nand designs in any way to honour his city or state.\nFurther, he ought to entertain the people with festivals and spectacles\nat convenient seasons of the year; and as every city is divided into\nguilds or into societies,[1] he ought to hold such bodies in esteem,\nand associate with them sometimes, and show himself an example of\ncourtesy and liberality; nevertheless, always maintaining the majesty\nof his rank, for this he must never consent to abate in anything.\n[1] \u201cGuilds or societies,\u201d \u201cin arti o in tribu.\u201d \u201cArti\u201d were craft or\ntrade guilds, _cf_. Florio: \u201cArte . . . a whole company of any trade\nin any city or corporation town.\u201d The guilds of Florence are most\nadmirably described by Mr Edgcumbe Staley in his work on the subject\n(Methuen, 1906). Institutions of a somewhat similar character, called\n\u201cartel,\u201d exist in Russia to-day, _cf_. Sir Mackenzie Wallace\u2019s\n\u201cRussia,\u201d ed. 1905: \u201cThe sons . . . were always during the working\nseason members of an artel. In some of the larger towns there are\nartels of a much more complex kind\u2014 permanent associations, possessing\nlarge capital, and pecuniarily responsible for the acts of the\nindividual members.\u201d The word \u201cartel,\u201d despite its apparent\nsimilarity, has, Mr Aylmer Maude assures me, no connection with \u201cars\u201d\nor \u201carte.\u201d Its root is that of the verb \u201crotisya,\u201d to bind oneself by\nan oath; and it is generally admitted to be only another form of\n\u201crota,\u201d which now signifies a \u201cregimental company.\u201d In both words the\nunderlying idea is that of a body of men united by an oath. \u201cTribu\u201d\nwere possibly gentile groups, united by common descent, and included\nindividuals connected by marriage. Perhaps our words \u201csects\u201d or\n\u201cclans\u201d would be most appropriate.\nCHAPTER XXII.\nCONCERNING THE SECRETARIES OF PRINCES\nThe choice of servants is of no little importance to a prince, and they\nare good or not according to the discrimination of the prince. And the\nfirst opinion which one forms of a prince, and of his understanding, is\nby observing the men he has around him; and when they are capable and\nfaithful he may always be considered wise, because he has known how to\nrecognize the capable and to keep them faithful. But when they are\notherwise one cannot form a good opinion of him, for the prime error\nwhich he made was in choosing them.\nThere were none who knew Messer Antonio da Venafro as the servant of\nPandolfo Petrucci, Prince of Siena, who would not consider Pandolfo to\nbe a very clever man in having Venafro for his servant. Because there\nare three classes of intellects: one which comprehends by itself;\nanother which appreciates what others comprehended; and a third which\nneither comprehends by itself nor by the showing of others; the first\nis the most excellent, the second is good, the third is useless.\nTherefore, it follows necessarily that, if Pandolfo was not in the\nfirst rank, he was in the second, for whenever one has judgment to know\ngood and bad when it is said and done, although he himself may not have\nthe initiative, yet he can recognize the good and the bad in his\nservant, and the one he can praise and the other correct; thus the\nservant cannot hope to deceive him, and is kept honest.\nBut to enable a prince to form an opinion of his servant there is one\ntest which never fails; when you see the servant thinking more of his\nown interests than of yours, and seeking inwardly his own profit in\neverything, such a man will never make a good servant, nor will you\never be able to trust him; because he who has the state of another in\nhis hands ought never to think of himself, but always of his prince,\nand never pay any attention to matters in which the prince is not\nconcerned.\nOn the other hand, to keep his servant honest the prince ought to study\nhim, honouring him, enriching him, doing him kindnesses, sharing with\nhim the honours and cares; and at the same time let him see that he\ncannot stand alone, so that many honours may not make him desire more,\nmany riches make him wish for more, and that many cares may make him\ndread chances. When, therefore, servants, and princes towards servants,\nare thus disposed, they can trust each other, but when it is otherwise,\nthe end will always be disastrous for either one or the other.\nCHAPTER XXIII.\nHOW FLATTERERS SHOULD BE AVOIDED\nI do not wish to leave out an important branch of this subject, for it\nis a danger from which princes are with difficulty preserved, unless\nthey are very careful and discriminating. It is that of flatterers, of\nwhom courts are full, because men are so self-complacent in their own\naffairs, and in a way so deceived in them, that they are preserved with\ndifficulty from this pest, and if they wish to defend themselves they\nrun the danger of falling into contempt. Because there is no other way\nof guarding oneself from flatterers except letting men understand that\nto tell you the truth does not offend you; but when every one may tell\nyou the truth, respect for you abates.\nTherefore a wise prince ought to hold a third course by choosing the\nwise men in his state, and giving to them only the liberty of speaking\nthe truth to him, and then only of those things of which he inquires,\nand of none others; but he ought to question them upon everything, and\nlisten to their opinions, and afterwards form his own conclusions. With\nthese councillors, separately and collectively, he ought to carry\nhimself in such a way that each of them should know that, the more\nfreely he shall speak, the more he shall be preferred; outside of\nthese, he should listen to no one, pursue the thing resolved on, and be\nsteadfast in his resolutions. He who does otherwise is either\noverthrown by flatterers, or is so often changed by varying opinions\nthat he falls into contempt.\nI wish on this subject to adduce a modern example. Fra Luca, the man of\naffairs to Maximilian,[1] the present emperor, speaking of his majesty,\nsaid: He consulted with no one, yet never got his own way in anything.\nThis arose because of his following a practice the opposite to the\nabove; for the emperor is a secretive man\u2014he does not communicate his\ndesigns to any one, nor does he receive opinions on them. But as in\ncarrying them into effect they become revealed and known, they are at\nonce obstructed by those men whom he has around him, and he, being\npliant, is diverted from them. Hence it follows that those things he\ndoes one day he undoes the next, and no one ever understands what he\nwishes or intends to do, and no one can rely on his resolutions.\n[1] Maximilian I, born in 1459, died 1519, Emperor of the Holy Roman\nEmpire. He married, first, Mary, daughter of Charles the Bold; after\nher death, Bianca Sforza; and thus became involved in Italian\npolitics.\nA prince, therefore, ought always to take counsel, but only when he\nwishes and not when others wish; he ought rather to discourage every\none from offering advice unless he asks it; but, however, he ought to\nbe a constant inquirer, and afterwards a patient listener concerning\nthe things of which he inquired; also, on learning that any one, on any\nconsideration, has not told him the truth, he should let his anger be\nfelt.\nAnd if there are some who think that a prince who conveys an impression\nof his wisdom is not so through his own ability, but through the good\nadvisers that he has around him, beyond doubt they are deceived,\nbecause this is an axiom which never fails: that a prince who is not\nwise himself will never take good advice, unless by chance he has\nyielded his affairs entirely to one person who happens to be a very\nprudent man. In this case indeed he may be well governed, but it would\nnot be for long, because such a governor would in a short time take\naway his state from him.\nBut if a prince who is not inexperienced should take counsel from more\nthan one he will never get united counsels, nor will he know how to\nunite them. Each of the counsellors will think of his own interests,\nand the prince will not know how to control them or to see through\nthem. And they are not to be found otherwise, because men will always\nprove untrue to you unless they are kept honest by constraint.\nTherefore it must be inferred that good counsels, whencesoever they\ncome, are born of the wisdom of the prince, and not the wisdom of the\nprince from good counsels.\nCHAPTER XXIV.\nWHY THE PRINCES OF ITALY HAVE LOST THEIR STATES\nThe previous suggestions, carefully observed, will enable a new prince\nto appear well established, and render him at once more secure and\nfixed in the state than if he had been long seated there. For the\nactions of a new prince are more narrowly observed than those of an\nhereditary one, and when they are seen to be able they gain more men\nand bind far tighter than ancient blood; because men are attracted more\nby the present than by the past, and when they find the present good\nthey enjoy it and seek no further; they will also make the utmost\ndefence of a prince if he fails them not in other things. Thus it will\nbe a double glory for him to have established a new principality, and\nadorned and strengthened it with good laws, good arms, good allies, and\nwith a good example; so will it be a double disgrace to him who, born a\nprince, shall lose his state by want of wisdom.\nAnd if those seigniors are considered who have lost their states in\nItaly in our times, such as the King of Naples, the Duke of Milan, and\nothers, there will be found in them, firstly, one common defect in\nregard to arms from the causes which have been discussed at length; in\nthe next place, some one of them will be seen, either to have had the\npeople hostile, or if he has had the people friendly, he has not known\nhow to secure the nobles. In the absence of these defects states that\nhave power enough to keep an army in the field cannot be lost.\nPhilip of Macedon, not the father of Alexander the Great, but he who\nwas conquered by Titus Quintius, had not much territory compared to the\ngreatness of the Romans and of Greece who attacked him, yet being a\nwarlike man who knew how to attract the people and secure the nobles,\nhe sustained the war against his enemies for many years, and if in the\nend he lost the dominion of some cities, nevertheless he retained the\nkingdom.\nTherefore, do not let our princes accuse fortune for the loss of their\nprincipalities after so many years\u2019 possession, but rather their own\nsloth, because in quiet times they never thought there could be a\nchange (it is a common defect in man not to make any provision in the\ncalm against the tempest), and when afterwards the bad times came they\nthought of flight and not of defending themselves, and they hoped that\nthe people, disgusted with the insolence of the conquerors, would\nrecall them. This course, when others fail, may be good, but it is very\nbad to have neglected all other expedients for that, since you would\nnever wish to fall because you trusted to be able to find someone later\non to restore you. This again either does not happen, or, if it does,\nit will not be for your security, because that deliverance is of no\navail which does not depend upon yourself; those only are reliable,\ncertain, and durable that depend on yourself and your valour.\nCHAPTER XXV.\nWHAT FORTUNE CAN EFFECT IN HUMAN AFFAIRS AND HOW TO WITHSTAND HER\nIt is not unknown to me how many men have had, and still have, the\nopinion that the affairs of the world are in such wise governed by\nfortune and by God that men with their wisdom cannot direct them and\nthat no one can even help them; and because of this they would have us\nbelieve that it is not necessary to labour much in affairs, but to let\nchance govern them. This opinion has been more credited in our times\nbecause of the great changes in affairs which have been seen, and may\nstill be seen, every day, beyond all human conjecture. Sometimes\npondering over this, I am in some degree inclined to their opinion.\nNevertheless, not to extinguish our free will, I hold it to be true\nthat Fortune is the arbiter of one-half of our actions,[1] but that she\nstill leaves us to direct the other half, or perhaps a little less.\n[1] Frederick the Great was accustomed to say: \u201cThe older one gets the\nmore convinced one becomes that his Majesty King Chance does\nthree-quarters of the business of this miserable universe.\u201d Sorel\u2019s\n\u201cEastern Question.\u201d\nI compare her to one of those raging rivers, which when in flood\noverflows the plains, sweeping away trees and buildings, bearing away\nthe soil from place to place; everything flies before it, all yield to\nits violence, without being able in any way to withstand it; and yet,\nthough its nature be such, it does not follow therefore that men, when\nthe weather becomes fair, shall not make provision, both with defences\nand barriers, in such a manner that, rising again, the waters may pass\naway by canal, and their force be neither so unrestrained nor so\ndangerous. So it happens with fortune, who shows her power where valour\nhas not prepared to resist her, and thither she turns her forces where\nshe knows that barriers and defences have not been raised to constrain\nher.\nAnd if you will consider Italy, which is the seat of these changes, and\nwhich has given to them their impulse, you will see it to be an open\ncountry without barriers and without any defence. For if it had been\ndefended by proper valour, as are Germany, Spain, and France, either\nthis invasion would not have made the great changes it has made or it\nwould not have come at all. And this I consider enough to say\nconcerning resistance to fortune in general.\nBut confining myself more to the particular, I say that a prince may be\nseen happy to-day and ruined to-morrow without having shown any change\nof disposition or character. This, I believe, arises firstly from\ncauses that have already been discussed at length, namely, that the\nprince who relies entirely on fortune is lost when it changes. I\nbelieve also that he will be successful who directs his actions\naccording to the spirit of the times, and that he whose actions do not\naccord with the times will not be successful. Because men are seen, in\naffairs that lead to the end which every man has before him, namely,\nglory and riches, to get there by various methods; one with caution,\nanother with haste; one by force, another by skill; one by patience,\nanother by its opposite; and each one succeeds in reaching the goal by\na different method. One can also see of two cautious men the one attain\nhis end, the other fail; and similarly, two men by different\nobservances are equally successful, the one being cautious, the other\nimpetuous; all this arises from nothing else than whether or not they\nconform in their methods to the spirit of the times. This follows from\nwhat I have said, that two men working differently bring about the same\neffect, and of two working similarly, one attains his object and the\nother does not.\nChanges in estate also issue from this, for if, to one who governs\nhimself with caution and patience, times and affairs converge in such a\nway that his administration is successful, his fortune is made; but if\ntimes and affairs change, he is ruined if he does not change his course\nof action. But a man is not often found sufficiently circumspect to\nknow how to accommodate himself to the change, both because he cannot\ndeviate from what nature inclines him to do, and also because, having\nalways prospered by acting in one way, he cannot be persuaded that it\nis well to leave it; and, therefore, the cautious man, when it is time\nto turn adventurous, does not know how to do it, hence he is ruined;\nbut had he changed his conduct with the times fortune would not have\nchanged.\nPope Julius the Second went to work impetuously in all his affairs, and\nfound the times and circumstances conform so well to that line of\naction that he always met with success. Consider his first enterprise\nagainst Bologna, Messer Giovanni Bentivogli being still alive. The\nVenetians were not agreeable to it, nor was the King of Spain, and he\nhad the enterprise still under discussion with the King of France;\nnevertheless he personally entered upon the expedition with his\naccustomed boldness and energy, a move which made Spain and the\nVenetians stand irresolute and passive, the latter from fear, the\nformer from desire to recover the kingdom of Naples; on the other hand,\nhe drew after him the King of France, because that king, having\nobserved the movement, and desiring to make the Pope his friend so as\nto humble the Venetians, found it impossible to refuse him. Therefore\nJulius with his impetuous action accomplished what no other pontiff\nwith simple human wisdom could have done; for if he had waited in Rome\nuntil he could get away, with his plans arranged and everything fixed,\nas any other pontiff would have done, he would never have succeeded.\nBecause the King of France would have made a thousand excuses, and the\nothers would have raised a thousand fears.\nI will leave his other actions alone, as they were all alike, and they\nall succeeded, for the shortness of his life did not let him experience\nthe contrary; but if circumstances had arisen which required him to go\ncautiously, his ruin would have followed, because he would never have\ndeviated from those ways to which nature inclined him.\nI conclude, therefore that, fortune being changeful and mankind\nsteadfast in their ways, so long as the two are in agreement men are\nsuccessful, but unsuccessful when they fall out. For my part I consider\nthat it is better to be adventurous than cautious, because fortune is a\nwoman, and if you wish to keep her under it is necessary to beat and\nill-use her; and it is seen that she allows herself to be mastered by\nthe adventurous rather than by those who go to work more coldly. She\nis, therefore, always, woman-like, a lover of young men, because they\nare less cautious, more violent, and with more audacity command her.\nCHAPTER XXVI.\nAN EXHORTATION TO LIBERATE ITALY FROM THE BARBARIANS\nHaving carefully considered the subject of the above discourses, and\nwondering within myself whether the present times were propitious to a\nnew prince, and whether there were elements that would give an\nopportunity to a wise and virtuous one to introduce a new order of\nthings which would do honour to him and good to the people of this\ncountry, it appears to me that so many things concur to favour a new\nprince that I never knew a time more fit than the present.\nAnd if, as I said, it was necessary that the people of Israel should be\ncaptive so as to make manifest the ability of Moses; that the Persians\nshould be oppressed by the Medes so as to discover the greatness of the\nsoul of Cyrus; and that the Athenians should be dispersed to illustrate\nthe capabilities of Theseus: then at the present time, in order to\ndiscover the virtue of an Italian spirit, it was necessary that Italy\nshould be reduced to the extremity that she is now in, that she should\nbe more enslaved than the Hebrews, more oppressed than the Persians,\nmore scattered than the Athenians; without head, without order, beaten,\ndespoiled, torn, overrun; and to have endured every kind of desolation.\nAlthough lately some spark may have been shown by one, which made us\nthink he was ordained by God for our redemption, nevertheless it was\nafterwards seen, in the height of his career, that fortune rejected\nhim; so that Italy, left as without life, waits for him who shall yet\nheal her wounds and put an end to the ravaging and plundering of\nLombardy, to the swindling and taxing of the kingdom and of Tuscany,\nand cleanse those sores that for long have festered. It is seen how she\nentreats God to send someone who shall deliver her from these wrongs\nand barbarous insolencies. It is seen also that she is ready and\nwilling to follow a banner if only someone will raise it.\nNor is there to be seen at present one in whom she can place more hope\nthan in your illustrious house,[1] with its valour and fortune,\nfavoured by God and by the Church of which it is now the chief, and\nwhich could be made the head of this redemption. This will not be\ndifficult if you will recall to yourself the actions and lives of the\nmen I have named. And although they were great and wonderful men, yet\nthey were men, and each one of them had no more opportunity than the\npresent offers, for their enterprises were neither more just nor easier\nthan this, nor was God more their friend than He is yours.\n[1] Giuliano de Medici. He had just been created a cardinal by Leo X.\nIn 1523 Giuliano was elected Pope, and took the title of Clement VII.\nWith us there is great justice, because that war is just which is\nnecessary, and arms are hallowed when there is no other hope but in\nthem. Here there is the greatest willingness, and where the willingness\nis great the difficulties cannot be great if you will only follow those\nmen to whom I have directed your attention. Further than this, how\nextraordinarily the ways of God have been manifested beyond example:\nthe sea is divided, a cloud has led the way, the rock has poured forth\nwater, it has rained manna, everything has contributed to your\ngreatness; you ought to do the rest. God is not willing to do\neverything, and thus take away our free will and that share of glory\nwhich belongs to us.\nAnd it is not to be wondered at if none of the above-named Italians\nhave been able to accomplish all that is expected from your illustrious\nhouse; and if in so many revolutions in Italy, and in so many\ncampaigns, it has always appeared as if military virtue were exhausted,\nthis has happened because the old order of things was not good, and\nnone of us have known how to find a new one. And nothing honours a man\nmore than to establish new laws and new ordinances when he himself was\nnewly risen. Such things when they are well founded and dignified will\nmake him revered and admired, and in Italy there are not wanting\nopportunities to bring such into use in every form.\nHere there is great valour in the limbs whilst it fails in the head.\nLook attentively at the duels and the hand-to-hand combats, how\nsuperior the Italians are in strength, dexterity, and subtlety. But\nwhen it comes to armies they do not bear comparison, and this springs\nentirely from the insufficiency of the leaders, since those who are\ncapable are not obedient, and each one seems to himself to know, there\nhaving never been any one so distinguished above the rest, either by\nvalour or fortune, that others would yield to him. Hence it is that for\nso long a time, and during so much fighting in the past twenty years,\nwhenever there has been an army wholly Italian, it has always given a\npoor account of itself; the first witness to this is Il Taro,\nafterwards Allesandria, Capua, Genoa, Vaila, Bologna, Mestri.[2]\n[2] The battles of Il Taro, 1495; Alessandria, 1499; Capua, 1501;\nGenoa, 1507; Vaila, 1509; Bologna, 1511; Mestri, 1513.\nIf, therefore, your illustrious house wishes to follow these remarkable\nmen who have redeemed their country, it is necessary before all things,\nas a true foundation for every enterprise, to be provided with your own\nforces, because there can be no more faithful, truer, or better\nsoldiers. And although singly they are good, altogether they will be\nmuch better when they find themselves commanded by their prince,\nhonoured by him, and maintained at his expense. Therefore it is\nnecessary to be prepared with such arms, so that you can be defended\nagainst foreigners by Italian valour.\nAnd although Swiss and Spanish infantry may be considered very\nformidable, nevertheless there is a defect in both, by reason of which\na third order would not only be able to oppose them, but might be\nrelied upon to overthrow them. For the Spaniards cannot resist cavalry,\nand the Switzers are afraid of infantry whenever they encounter them in\nclose combat. Owing to this, as has been and may again be seen, the\nSpaniards are unable to resist French cavalry, and the Switzers are\noverthrown by Spanish infantry. And although a complete proof of this\nlatter cannot be shown, nevertheless there was some evidence of it at\nthe battle of Ravenna, when the Spanish infantry were confronted by\nGerman battalions, who follow the same tactics as the Swiss; when the\nSpaniards, by agility of body and with the aid of their shields, got in\nunder the pikes of the Germans and stood out of danger, able to attack,\nwhile the Germans stood helpless, and, if the cavalry had not dashed\nup, all would have been over with them. It is possible, therefore,\nknowing the defects of both these infantries, to invent a new one,\nwhich will resist cavalry and not be afraid of infantry; this need not\ncreate a new order of arms, but a variation upon the old. And these are\nthe kind of improvements which confer reputation and power upon a new\nprince.\nThis opportunity, therefore, ought not to be allowed to pass for\nletting Italy at last see her liberator appear. Nor can one express the\nlove with which he would be received in all those provinces which have\nsuffered so much from these foreign scourings, with what thirst for\nrevenge, with what stubborn faith, with what devotion, with what tears.\nWhat door would be closed to him? Who would refuse obedience to him?\nWhat envy would hinder him? What Italian would refuse him homage? To\nall of us this barbarous dominion stinks. Let, therefore, your\nillustrious house take up this charge with that courage and hope with\nwhich all just enterprises are undertaken, so that under its standard\nour native country may be ennobled, and under its auspices may be\nverified that saying of Petrarch:\nVirtu contro al Furore\nPrendera l\u2019arme, e fia il combatter corto:\nChe l\u2019antico valore\nNegli italici cuor non e ancor morto.\nVirtue against fury shall advance the fight,\nAnd it i\u2019 th\u2019 combat soon shall put to flight:\nFor the old Roman valour is not dead,\nNor in th\u2019 Italians\u2019 brests extinguished.\nEdward Dacre, 1640.\nDESCRIPTION OF THE METHODS ADOPTED BY THE DUKE VALENTINO WHEN MURDERING\nVITELLOZZO VITELLI, OLIVEROTTO DA FERMO, THE SIGNOR PAGOLO, AND THE\nDUKE DI GRAVINA ORSINI\nBY NICOLO MACHIAVELLI\nThe Duke Valentino had returned from Lombardy, where he had been to\nclear himself with the King of France from the calumnies which had been\nraised against him by the Florentines concerning the rebellion of\nArezzo and other towns in the Val di Chiana, and had arrived at Imola,\nwhence he intended with his army to enter upon the campaign against\nGiovanni Bentivogli, the tyrant of Bologna: for he intended to bring\nthat city under his domination, and to make it the head of his\nRomagnian duchy.\nThese matters coming to the knowledge of the Vitelli and Orsini and\ntheir following, it appeared to them that the duke would become too\npowerful, and it was feared that, having seized Bologna, he would seek\nto destroy them in order that he might become supreme in Italy. Upon\nthis a meeting was called at Magione in the district of Perugia, to\nwhich came the cardinal, Pagolo, and the Duke di Gravina Orsini,\nVitellozzo Vitelli, Oliverotto da Fermo, Gianpagolo Baglioni, the\ntyrant of Perugia, and Messer Antonio da Venafro, sent by Pandolfo\nPetrucci, the Prince of Siena. Here were discussed the power and\ncourage of the duke and the necessity of curbing his ambitions, which\nmight otherwise bring danger to the rest of being ruined. And they\ndecided not to abandon the Bentivogli, but to strive to win over the\nFlorentines; and they sent their men to one place and another,\npromising to one party assistance and to another encouragement to unite\nwith them against the common enemy. This meeting was at once reported\nthroughout all Italy, and those who were discontented under the duke,\namong whom were the people of Urbino, took hope of effecting a\nrevolution.\nThus it arose that, men\u2019s minds being thus unsettled, it was decided by\ncertain men of Urbino to seize the fortress of San Leo, which was held\nfor the duke, and which they captured by the following means. The\ncastellan was fortifying the rock and causing timber to be taken there;\nso the conspirators watched, and when certain beams which were being\ncarried to the rock were upon the bridge, so that it was prevented from\nbeing drawn up by those inside, they took the opportunity of leaping\nupon the bridge and thence into the fortress. Upon this capture being\neffected, the whole state rebelled and recalled the old duke, being\nencouraged in this, not so much by the capture of the fort, as by the\nDiet at Magione, from whom they expected to get assistance.\nThose who heard of the rebellion at Urbino thought they would not lose\nthe opportunity, and at once assembled their men so as to take any\ntown, should any remain in the hands of the duke in that state; and\nthey sent again to Florence to beg that republic to join with them in\ndestroying the common firebrand, showing that the risk was lessened and\nthat they ought not to wait for another opportunity.\nBut the Florentines, from hatred, for sundry reasons, of the Vitelli\nand Orsini, not only would not ally themselves, but sent Nicolo\nMachiavelli, their secretary, to offer shelter and assistance to the\nduke against his enemies. The duke was found full of fear at Imola,\nbecause, against everybody\u2019s expectation, his soldiers had at once gone\nover to the enemy and he found himself disarmed and war at his door.\nBut recovering courage from the offers of the Florentines, he decided\nto temporize before fighting with the few soldiers that remained to\nhim, and to negotiate for a reconciliation, and also to get assistance.\nThis latter he obtained in two ways, by sending to the King of France\nfor men and by enlisting men-at-arms and others whom he turned into\ncavalry of a sort: to all he gave money.\nNotwithstanding this, his enemies drew near to him, and approached\nFossombrone, where they encountered some men of the duke and, with the\naid of the Orsini and Vitelli, routed them. When this happened, the\nduke resolved at once to see if he could not close the trouble with\noffers of reconciliation, and being a most perfect dissembler he did\nnot fail in any practices to make the insurgents understand that he\nwished every man who had acquired anything to keep it, as it was enough\nfor him to have the title of prince, whilst others might have the\nprincipality.\nAnd the duke succeeded so well in this that they sent Signor Pagolo to\nhim to negotiate for a reconciliation, and they brought their army to a\nstandstill. But the duke did not stop his preparations, and took every\ncare to provide himself with cavalry and infantry, and that such\npreparations might not be apparent to the others, he sent his troops in\nseparate parties to every part of the Romagna. In the meanwhile there\ncame also to him five hundred French lancers, and although he found\nhimself sufficiently strong to take vengeance on his enemies in open\nwar, he considered that it would be safer and more advantageous to\noutwit them, and for this reason he did not stop the work of\nreconciliation.\nAnd that this might be effected the duke concluded a peace with them in\nwhich he confirmed their former covenants; he gave them four thousand\nducats at once; he promised not to injure the Bentivogli; and he formed\nan alliance with Giovanni; and moreover he would not force them to come\npersonally into his presence unless it pleased them to do so. On the\nother hand, they promised to restore to him the duchy of Urbino and\nother places seized by them, to serve him in all his expeditions, and\nnot to make war against or ally themselves with any one without his\npermission.\nThis reconciliation being completed, Guido Ubaldo, the Duke of Urbino,\nagain fled to Venice, having first destroyed all the fortresses in his\nstate; because, trusting in the people, he did not wish that the\nfortresses, which he did not think he could defend, should be held by\nthe enemy, since by these means a check would be kept upon his friends.\nBut the Duke Valentino, having completed this convention, and dispersed\nhis men throughout the Romagna, set out for Imola at the end of\nNovember together with his French men-at-arms: thence he went to\nCesena, where he stayed some time to negotiate with the envoys of the\nVitelli and Orsini, who had assembled with their men in the duchy of\nUrbino, as to the enterprise in which they should now take part; but\nnothing being concluded, Oliverotto da Fermo was sent to propose that\nif the duke wished to undertake an expedition against Tuscany they were\nready; if he did not wish it, then they would besiege Sinigalia. To\nthis the duke replied that he did not wish to enter into war with\nTuscany, and thus become hostile to the Florentines, but that he was\nvery willing to proceed against Sinigalia.\nIt happened that not long afterwards the town surrendered, but the\nfortress would not yield to them because the castellan would not give\nit up to any one but the duke in person; therefore they exhorted him to\ncome there. This appeared a good opportunity to the duke, as, being\ninvited by them, and not going of his own will, he would awaken no\nsuspicions. And the more to reassure them, he allowed all the French\nmen-at-arms who were with him in Lombardy to depart, except the hundred\nlancers under Mons. di Candales, his brother-in-law. He left Cesena\nabout the middle of December, and went to Fano, and with the utmost\ncunning and cleverness he persuaded the Vitelli and Orsini to wait for\nhim at Sinigalia, pointing out to them that any lack of compliance\nwould cast a doubt upon the sincerity and permanency of the\nreconciliation, and that he was a man who wished to make use of the\narms and councils of his friends. But Vitellozzo remained very\nstubborn, for the death of his brother warned him that he should not\noffend a prince and afterwards trust him; nevertheless, persuaded by\nPagolo Orsini, whom the duke had corrupted with gifts and promises, he\nagreed to wait.\nUpon this the duke, before his departure from Fano, which was to be on\n30th December 1502, communicated his designs to eight of his most\ntrusted followers, among whom were Don Michele and the Monsignor\nd\u2019Euna, who was afterwards cardinal; and he ordered that, as soon as\nVitellozzo, Pagolo Orsini, the Duke di Gravina, and Oliverotto should\narrive, his followers in pairs should take them one by one, entrusting\ncertain men to certain pairs, who should entertain them until they\nreached Sinigalia; nor should they be permitted to leave until they\ncame to the duke\u2019s quarters, where they should be seized.\nThe duke afterwards ordered all his horsemen and infantry, of which\nthere were more than two thousand cavalry and ten thousand footmen, to\nassemble by daybreak at the Metauro, a river five miles distant from\nFano, and await him there. He found himself, therefore, on the last day\nof December at the Metauro with his men, and having sent a cavalcade of\nabout two hundred horsemen before him, he then moved forward the\ninfantry, whom he accompanied with the rest of the men-at-arms.\nFano and Sinigalia are two cities of La Marca situated on the shore of\nthe Adriatic Sea, fifteen miles distant from each other, so that he who\ngoes towards Sinigalia has the mountains on his right hand, the bases\nof which are touched by the sea in some places. The city of Sinigalia\nis distant from the foot of the mountains a little more than a bow-shot\nand from the shore about a mile. On the side opposite to the city runs\na little river which bathes that part of the walls looking towards\nFano, facing the high road. Thus he who draws near to Sinigalia comes\nfor a good space by road along the mountains, and reaches the river\nwhich passes by Sinigalia. If he turns to his left hand along the bank\nof it, and goes for the distance of a bow-shot, he arrives at a bridge\nwhich crosses the river; he is then almost abreast of the gate that\nleads into Sinigalia, not by a straight line, but transversely. Before\nthis gate there stands a collection of houses with a square to which\nthe bank of the river forms one side.\nThe Vitelli and Orsini having received orders to wait for the duke, and\nto honour him in person, sent away their men to several castles distant\nfrom Sinigalia about six miles, so that room could be made for the men\nof the duke; and they left in Sinigalia only Oliverotto and his band,\nwhich consisted of one thousand infantry and one hundred and fifty\nhorsemen, who were quartered in the suburb mentioned above. Matters\nhaving been thus arranged, the Duke Valentino left for Sinigalia, and\nwhen the leaders of the cavalry reached the bridge they did not pass\nover, but having opened it, one portion wheeled towards the river and\nthe other towards the country, and a way was left in the middle through\nwhich the infantry passed, without stopping, into the town.\nVitellozzo, Pagolo, and the Duke di Gravina on mules, accompanied by a\nfew horsemen, went towards the duke; Vitellozo, unarmed and wearing a\ncape lined with green, appeared very dejected, as if conscious of his\napproaching death\u2014a circumstance which, in view of the ability of the\nman and his former fortune, caused some amazement. And it is said that\nwhen he parted from his men before setting out for Sinigalia to meet\nthe duke he acted as if it were his last parting from them. He\nrecommended his house and its fortunes to his captains, and advised his\nnephews that it was not the fortune of their house, but the virtues of\ntheir fathers that should be kept in mind. These three, therefore, came\nbefore the duke and saluted him respectfully, and were received by him\nwith goodwill; they were at once placed between those who were\ncommissioned to look after them.\nBut the duke noticing that Oliverotto, who had remained with his band\nin Sinigalia, was missing\u2014for Oliverotto was waiting in the square\nbefore his quarters near the river, keeping his men in order and\ndrilling them\u2014signalled with his eye to Don Michelle, to whom the care\nof Oliverotto had been committed, that he should take measures that\nOliverotto should not escape. Therefore Don Michele rode off and joined\nOliverotto, telling him that it was not right to keep his men out of\ntheir quarters, because these might be taken up by the men of the duke;\nand he advised him to send them at once to their quarters and to come\nhimself to meet the duke. And Oliverotto, having taken this advice,\ncame before the duke, who, when he saw him, called to him; and\nOliverotto, having made his obeisance, joined the others.\nSo the whole party entered Sinigalia, dismounted at the duke\u2019s\nquarters, and went with him into a secret chamber, where the duke made\nthem prisoners; he then mounted on horseback, and issued orders that\nthe men of Oliverotto and the Orsini should be stripped of their arms.\nThose of Oliverotto, being at hand, were quickly settled, but those of\nthe Orsini and Vitelli, being at a distance, and having a presentiment\nof the destruction of their masters, had time to prepare themselves,\nand bearing in mind the valour and discipline of the Orsinian and\nVitellian houses, they stood together against the hostile forces of the\ncountry and saved themselves.\nBut the duke\u2019s soldiers, not being content with having pillaged the men\nof Oliverotto, began to sack Sinigalia, and if the duke had not\nrepressed this outrage by killing some of them they would have\ncompletely sacked it. Night having come and the tumult being silenced,\nthe duke prepared to kill Vitellozzo and Oliverotto; he led them into a\nroom and caused them to be strangled. Neither of them used words in\nkeeping with their past lives: Vitellozzo prayed that he might ask of\nthe pope full pardon for his sins; Oliverotto cringed and laid the\nblame for all injuries against the duke on Vitellozzo. Pagolo and the\nDuke di Gravina Orsini were kept alive until the duke heard from Rome\nthat the pope had taken the Cardinal Orsino, the Archbishop of\nFlorence, and Messer Jacopo da Santa Croce. After which news, on 18th\nJanuary 1502, in the castle of Pieve, they also were strangled in the\nsame way.\nTHE LIFE OF CASTRUCCIO CASTRACANI OF LUCCA\nWRITTEN BY NICOLO MACHIAVELLI\nAnd sent to his friends ZANOBI BUONDELMONTI And LUIGI ALAMANNI\nCASTRUCCIO CASTRACANI 1284-1328\nIt appears, dearest Zanobi and Luigi, a wonderful thing to those who\nhave considered the matter, that all men, or the larger number of them,\nwho have performed great deeds in the world, and excelled all others in\ntheir day, have had their birth and beginning in baseness and\nobscurity; or have been aggrieved by Fortune in some outrageous way.\nThey have either been exposed to the mercy of wild beasts, or they have\nhad so mean a parentage that in shame they have given themselves out to\nbe sons of Jove or of some other deity. It would be wearisome to relate\nwho these persons may have been because they are well known to\neverybody, and, as such tales would not be particularly edifying to\nthose who read them, they are omitted. I believe that these lowly\nbeginnings of great men occur because Fortune is desirous of showing to\nthe world that such men owe much to her and little to wisdom, because\nshe begins to show her hand when wisdom can really take no part in\ntheir career: thus all success must be attributed to her. Castruccio\nCastracani of Lucca was one of those men who did great deeds, if he is\nmeasured by the times in which he lived and the city in which he was\nborn; but, like many others, he was neither fortunate nor distinguished\nin his birth, as the course of this history will show. It appeared to\nbe desirable to recall his memory, because I have discerned in him such\nindications of valour and fortune as should make him a great exemplar\nto men. I think also that I ought to call your attention to his\nactions, because you of all men I know delight most in noble deeds.\nThe family of Castracani was formerly numbered among the noble families\nof Lucca, but in the days of which I speak it had somewhat fallen in\nestate, as so often happens in this world. To this family was born a\nson Antonio, who became a priest of the order of San Michele of Lucca,\nand for this reason was honoured with the title of Messer Antonio. He\nhad an only sister, who had been married to Buonaccorso Cenami, but\nBuonaccorso dying she became a widow, and not wishing to marry again\nwent to live with her brother. Messer Antonio had a vineyard behind the\nhouse where he resided, and as it was bounded on all sides by gardens,\nany person could have access to it without difficulty. One morning,\nshortly after sunrise, Madonna Dianora, as the sister of Messer Antonio\nwas called, had occasion to go into the vineyard as usual to gather\nherbs for seasoning the dinner, and hearing a slight rustling among the\nleaves of a vine she turned her eyes in that direction, and heard\nsomething resembling the cry of an infant. Whereupon she went towards\nit, and saw the hands and face of a baby who was lying enveloped in the\nleaves and who seemed to be crying for its mother. Partly wondering and\npartly fearing, yet full of compassion, she lifted it up and carried it\nto the house, where she washed it and clothed it with clean linen as is\ncustomary, and showed it to Messer Antonio when he returned home. When\nhe heard what had happened and saw the child he was not less surprised\nor compassionate than his sister. They discussed between themselves\nwhat should be done, and seeing that he was priest and that she had no\nchildren, they finally determined to bring it up. They had a nurse for\nit, and it was reared and loved as if it were their own child. They\nbaptized it, and gave it the name of Castruccio after their father. As\nthe years passed Castruccio grew very handsome, and gave evidence of\nwit and discretion, and learnt with a quickness beyond his years those\nlessons which Messer Antonio imparted to him. Messer Antonio intended\nto make a priest of him, and in time would have inducted him into his\ncanonry and other benefices, and all his instruction was given with\nthis object; but Antonio discovered that the character of Castruccio\nwas quite unfitted for the priesthood. As soon as Castruccio reached\nthe age of fourteen he began to take less notice of the chiding of\nMesser Antonio and Madonna Dianora and no longer to fear them; he left\noff reading ecclesiastical books, and turned to playing with arms,\ndelighting in nothing so much as in learning their uses, and in\nrunning, leaping, and wrestling with other boys. In all exercises he\nfar excelled his companions in courage and bodily strength, and if at\nany time he did turn to books, only those pleased him which told of\nwars and the mighty deeds of men. Messer Antonio beheld all this with\nvexation and sorrow.\nThere lived in the city of Lucca a gentleman of the Guinigi family,\nnamed Messer Francesco, whose profession was arms and who in riches,\nbodily strength, and valour excelled all other men in Lucca. He had\noften fought under the command of the Visconti of Milan, and as a\nGhibelline was the valued leader of that party in Lucca. This gentleman\nresided in Lucca and was accustomed to assemble with others most\nmornings and evenings under the balcony of the Podesta, which is at the\ntop of the square of San Michele, the finest square in Lucca, and he\nhad often seen Castruccio taking part with other children of the street\nin those games of which I have spoken. Noticing that Castruccio far\nexcelled the other boys, and that he appeared to exercise a royal\nauthority over them, and that they loved and obeyed him, Messer\nFrancesco became greatly desirous of learning who he was. Being\ninformed of the circumstances of the bringing up of Castruccio he felt\na greater desire to have him near to him. Therefore he called him one\nday and asked him whether he would more willingly live in the house of\na gentleman, where he would learn to ride horses and use arms, or in\nthe house of a priest, where he would learn nothing but masses and the\nservices of the Church. Messer Francesco could see that it pleased\nCastruccio greatly to hear horses and arms spoken of, even though he\nstood silent, blushing modestly; but being encouraged by Messer\nFrancesco to speak, he answered that, if his master were agreeable,\nnothing would please him more than to give up his priestly studies and\ntake up those of a soldier. This reply delighted Messer Francesco, and\nin a very short time he obtained the consent of Messer Antonio, who was\ndriven to yield by his knowledge of the nature of the lad, and the fear\nthat he would not be able to hold him much longer.\nThus Castruccio passed from the house of Messer Antonio the priest to\nthe house of Messer Francesco Guinigi the soldier, and it was\nastonishing to find that in a very short time he manifested all that\nvirtue and bearing which we are accustomed to associate with a true\ngentleman. In the first place he became an accomplished horseman, and\ncould manage with ease the most fiery charger, and in all jousts and\ntournaments, although still a youth, he was observed beyond all others,\nand he excelled in all exercises of strength and dexterity. But what\nenhanced so much the charm of these accomplishments, was the delightful\nmodesty which enabled him to avoid offence in either act or word to\nothers, for he was deferential to the great men, modest with his\nequals, and courteous to his inferiors. These gifts made him beloved,\nnot only by all the Guinigi family, but by all Lucca. When Castruccio\nhad reached his eighteenth year, the Ghibellines were driven from Pavia\nby the Guelphs, and Messer Francesco was sent by the Visconti to assist\nthe Ghibellines, and with him went Castruccio, in charge of his forces.\nCastruccio gave ample proof of his prudence and courage in this\nexpedition, acquiring greater reputation than any other captain, and\nhis name and fame were known, not only in Pavia, but throughout all\nLombardy.\nCastruccio, having returned to Lucca in far higher estimation than he\nleft it, did not omit to use all the means in his power to gain as many\nfriends as he could, neglecting none of those arts which are necessary\nfor that purpose. About this time Messer Francesco died, leaving a son\nthirteen years of age named Pagolo, and having appointed Castruccio to\nbe his son\u2019s tutor and administrator of his estate. Before he died\nFrancesco called Castruccio to him, and prayed him to show Pagolo that\ngoodwill which he (Francesco) had always shown to HIM, and to render to\nthe son the gratitude which he had not been able to repay to the\nfather. Upon the death of Francesco, Castruccio became the governor and\ntutor of Pagolo, which increased enormously his power and position, and\ncreated a certain amount of envy against him in Lucca in place of the\nformer universal goodwill, for many men suspected him of harbouring\ntyrannical intentions. Among these the leading man was Giorgio degli\nOpizi, the head of the Guelph party. This man hoped after the death of\nMesser Francesco to become the chief man in Lucca, but it seemed to him\nthat Castruccio, with the great abilities which he already showed, and\nholding the position of governor, deprived him of his opportunity;\ntherefore he began to sow those seeds which should rob Castruccio of\nhis eminence. Castruccio at first treated this with scorn, but\nafterwards he grew alarmed, thinking that Messer Giorgio might be able\nto bring him into disgrace with the deputy of King Ruberto of Naples\nand have him driven out of Lucca.\nThe Lord of Pisa at that time was Uguccione of the Faggiuola of Arezzo,\nwho being in the first place elected their captain afterwards became\ntheir lord. There resided in Paris some exiled Ghibellines from Lucca,\nwith whom Castruccio held communications with the object of effecting\ntheir restoration by the help of Uguccione. Castruccio also brought\ninto his plans friends from Lucca who would not endure the authority of\nthe Opizi. Having fixed upon a plan to be followed, Castruccio\ncautiously fortified the tower of the Onesti, filling it with supplies\nand munitions of war, in order that it might stand a siege for a few\ndays in case of need. When the night came which had been agreed upon\nwith Uguccione, who had occupied the plain between the mountains and\nPisa with many men, the signal was given, and without being observed\nUguccione approached the gate of San Piero and set fire to the\nportcullis. Castruccio raised a great uproar within the city, calling\nthe people to arms and forcing open the gate from his side. Uguccione\nentered with his men, poured through the town, and killed Messer\nGiorgio with all his family and many of his friends and supporters. The\ngovernor was driven out, and the government reformed according to the\nwishes of Uguccione, to the detriment of the city, because it was found\nthat more than one hundred families were exiled at that time. Of those\nwho fled, part went to Florence and part to Pistoia, which city was the\nheadquarters of the Guelph party, and for this reason it became most\nhostile to Uguccione and the Lucchese.\nAs it now appeared to the Florentines and others of the Guelph party\nthat the Ghibellines absorbed too much power in Tuscany, they\ndetermined to restore the exiled Guelphs to Lucca. They assembled a\nlarge army in the Val di Nievole, and seized Montecatini; from thence\nthey marched to Montecarlo, in order to secure the free passage into\nLucca. Upon this Uguccione assembled his Pisan and Lucchese forces, and\nwith a number of German cavalry which he drew out of Lombardy, he moved\nagainst the quarters of the Florentines, who upon the appearance of the\nenemy withdrew from Montecarlo, and posted themselves between\nMontecatini and Pescia. Uguccione now took up a position near to\nMontecarlo, and within about two miles of the enemy, and slight\nskirmishes between the horse of both parties were of daily occurrence.\nOwing to the illness of Uguccione, the Pisans and Lucchese delayed\ncoming to battle with the enemy. Uguccione, finding himself growing\nworse, went to Montecarlo to be cured, and left the command of the army\nin the hands of Castruccio. This change brought about the ruin of the\nGuelphs, who, thinking that the hostile army having lost its captain\nhad lost its head, grew over-confident. Castruccio observed this, and\nallowed some days to pass in order to encourage this belief; he also\nshowed signs of fear, and did not allow any of the munitions of the\ncamp to be used. On the other side, the Guelphs grew more insolent the\nmore they saw these evidences of fear, and every day they drew out in\nthe order of battle in front of the army of Castruccio. Presently,\ndeeming that the enemy was sufficiently emboldened, and having mastered\ntheir tactics, he decided to join battle with them. First he spoke a\nfew words of encouragement to his soldiers, and pointed out to them the\ncertainty of victory if they would but obey his commands. Castruccio\nhad noticed how the enemy had placed all his best troops in the centre\nof the line of battle, and his less reliable men on the wings of the\narmy; whereupon he did exactly the opposite, putting his most valiant\nmen on the flanks, while those on whom he could not so strongly rely he\nmoved to the centre. Observing this order of battle, he drew out of his\nlines and quickly came in sight of the hostile army, who, as usual, had\ncome in their insolence to defy him. He then commanded his centre\nsquadrons to march slowly, whilst he moved rapidly forward those on the\nwings. Thus, when they came into contact with the enemy, only the wings\nof the two armies became engaged, whilst the center battalions remained\nout of action, for these two portions of the line of battle were\nseparated from each other by a long interval and thus unable to reach\neach other. By this expedient the more valiant part of Castruccio\u2019s men\nwere opposed to the weaker part of the enemy\u2019s troops, and the most\nefficient men of the enemy were disengaged; and thus the Florentines\nwere unable to fight with those who were arrayed opposite to them, or\nto give any assistance to their own flanks. So, without much\ndifficulty, Castruccio put the enemy to flight on both flanks, and the\ncentre battalions took to flight when they found themselves exposed to\nattack, without having a chance of displaying their valour. The defeat\nwas complete, and the loss in men very heavy, there being more than ten\nthousand men killed with many officers and knights of the Guelph party\nin Tuscany, and also many princes who had come to help them, among whom\nwere Piero, the brother of King Ruberto, and Carlo, his nephew, and\nFilippo, the lord of Taranto. On the part of Castruccio the loss did\nnot amount to more than three hundred men, among whom was Francesco,\nthe son of Uguccione, who, being young and rash, was killed in the\nfirst onset.\nThis victory so greatly increased the reputation of Castruccio that\nUguccione conceived some jealousy and suspicion of him, because it\nappeared to Uguccione that this victory had given him no increase of\npower, but rather than diminished it. Being of this mind, he only\nwaited for an opportunity to give effect to it. This occurred on the\ndeath of Pier Agnolo Micheli, a man of great repute and abilities in\nLucca, the murderer of whom fled to the house of Castruccio for refuge.\nOn the sergeants of the captain going to arrest the murderer, they were\ndriven off by Castruccio, and the murderer escaped. This affair coming\nto the knowledge of Uguccione, who was then at Pisa, it appeared to him\na proper opportunity to punish Castruccio. He therefore sent for his\nson Neri, who was the governor of Lucca, and commissioned him to take\nCastruccio prisoner at a banquet and put him to death. Castruccio,\nfearing no evil, went to the governor in a friendly way, was\nentertained at supper, and then thrown into prison. But Neri, fearing\nto put him to death lest the people should be incensed, kept him alive,\nin order to hear further from his father concerning his intentions.\nUgucionne cursed the hesitation and cowardice of his son, and at once\nset out from Pisa to Lucca with four hundred horsemen to finish the\nbusiness in his own way; but he had not yet reached the baths when the\nPisans rebelled and put his deputy to death and created Count Gaddo\ndella Gherardesca their lord. Before Uguccione reached Lucca he heard\nof the occurrences at Pisa, but it did not appear wise to him to turn\nback, lest the Lucchese with the example of Pisa before them should\nclose their gates against him. But the Lucchese, having heard of what\nhad happened at Pisa, availed themselves of this opportunity to demand\nthe liberation of Castruccio, notwithstanding that Uguccione had\narrived in their city. They first began to speak of it in private\ncircles, afterwards openly in the squares and streets; then they raised\na tumult, and with arms in their hands went to Uguccione and demanded\nthat Castruccio should be set at liberty. Uguccione, fearing that worse\nmight happen, released him from prison. Whereupon Castruccio gathered\nhis friends around him, and with the help of the people attacked\nUguccione; who, finding he had no resource but in flight, rode away\nwith his friends to Lombardy, to the lords of Scale, where he died in\npoverty.\nBut Castruccio from being a prisoner became almost a prince in Lucca,\nand he carried himself so discreetly with his friends and the people\nthat they appointed him captain of their army for one year. Having\nobtained this, and wishing to gain renown in war, he planned the\nrecovery of the many towns which had rebelled after the departure of\nUguccione, and with the help of the Pisans, with whom he had concluded\na treaty, he marched to Serezzana. To capture this place he constructed\na fort against it, which is called to-day Zerezzanello; in the course\nof two months Castruccio captured the town. With the reputation gained\nat that siege, he rapidly seized Massa, Carrara, and Lavenza, and in a\nshort time had overrun the whole of Lunigiana. In order to close the\npass which leads from Lombardy to Lunigiana, he besieged Pontremoli and\nwrested it from the hands of Messer Anastagio Palavicini, who was the\nlord of it. After this victory he returned to Lucca, and was welcomed\nby the whole people. And now Castruccio, deeming it imprudent any\nlonger to defer making himself a prince, got himself created the lord\nof Lucca by the help of Pazzino del Poggio, Puccinello dal Portico,\nFrancesco Boccansacchi, and Cecco Guinigi, all of whom he had\ncorrupted; and he was afterwards solemnly and deliberately elected\nprince by the people. At this time Frederick of Bavaria, the King of\nthe Romans, came into Italy to assume the Imperial crown, and\nCastruccio, in order that he might make friends with him, met him at\nthe head of five hundred horsemen. Castruccio had left as his deputy in\nLucca, Pagolo Guinigi, who was held in high estimation, because of the\npeople\u2019s love for the memory of his father. Castruccio was received in\ngreat honour by Frederick, and many privileges were conferred upon him,\nand he was appointed the emperor\u2019s lieutenant in Tuscany. At this time\nthe Pisans were in great fear of Gaddo della Gherardesca, whom they had\ndriven out of Pisa, and they had recourse for assistance to Frederick.\nFrederick created Castruccio the lord of Pisa, and the Pisans, in dread\nof the Guelph party, and particularly of the Florentines, were\nconstrained to accept him as their lord.\nFrederick, having appointed a governor in Rome to watch his Italian\naffairs, returned to Germany. All the Tuscan and Lombardian\nGhibellines, who followed the imperial lead, had recourse to Castruccio\nfor help and counsel, and all promised him the governorship of his\ncountry, if enabled to recover it with his assistance. Among these\nexiles were Matteo Guidi, Nardo Scolari, Lapo Uberti, Gerozzo Nardi,\nand Piero Buonaccorsi, all exiled Florentines and Ghibellines.\nCastruccio had the secret intention of becoming the master of all\nTuscany by the aid of these men and of his own forces; and in order to\ngain greater weight in affairs, he entered into a league with Messer\nMatteo Visconti, the Prince of Milan, and organized for him the forces\nof his city and the country districts. As Lucca had five gates, he\ndivided his own country districts into five parts, which he supplied\nwith arms, and enrolled the men under captains and ensigns, so that he\ncould quickly bring into the field twenty thousand soldiers, without\nthose whom he could summon to his assistance from Pisa. While he\nsurrounded himself with these forces and allies, it happened at Messer\nMatteo Visconti was attacked by the Guelphs of Piacenza, who had driven\nout the Ghibellines with the assistance of a Florentine army and the\nKing Ruberto. Messer Matteo called upon Castruccio to invade the\nFlorentines in their own territories, so that, being attacked at home,\nthey should be compelled to draw their army out of Lombardy in order to\ndefend themselves. Castruccio invaded the Valdarno, and seized\nFucecchio and San Miniato, inflicting immense damage upon the country.\nWhereupon the Florentines recalled their army, which had scarcely\nreached Tuscany, when Castruccio was forced by other necessities to\nreturn to Lucca.\nThere resided in the city of Lucca the Poggio family, who were so\npowerful that they could not only elevate Castruccio, but even advance\nhim to the dignity of prince; and it appearing to them they had not\nreceived such rewards for their services as they deserved, they incited\nother families to rebel and to drive Castruccio out of Lucca. They\nfound their opportunity one morning, and arming themselves, they set\nupon the lieutenant whom Castruccio had left to maintain order and\nkilled him. They endeavoured to raise the people in revolt, but Stefano\ndi Poggio, a peaceable old man who had taken no hand in the rebellion,\nintervened and compelled them by his authority to lay down their arms;\nand he offered to be their mediator with Castruccio to obtain from him\nwhat they desired. Therefore they laid down their arms with no greater\nintelligence than they had taken them up. Castruccio, having heard the\nnews of what had happened at Lucca, at once put Pagolo Guinigi in\ncommand of the army, and with a troop of cavalry set out for home.\nContrary to his expectations, he found the rebellion at an end, yet he\nposted his men in the most advantageous places throughout the city. As\nit appeared to Stefano that Castruccio ought to be very much obliged to\nhim, he sought him out, and without saying anything on his own behalf,\nfor he did not recognize any need for doing so, he begged Castruccio to\npardon the other members of his family by reason of their youth, their\nformer friendships, and the obligations which Castruccio was under to\ntheir house. To this Castruccio graciously responded, and begged\nStefano to reassure himself, declaring that it gave him more pleasure\nto find the tumult at an end than it had ever caused him anxiety to\nhear of its inception. He encouraged Stefano to bring his family to\nhim, saying that he thanked God for having given him the opportunity of\nshowing his clemency and liberality. Upon the word of Stefano and\nCastruccio they surrendered, and with Stefano were immediately thrown\ninto prison and put to death. Meanwhile the Florentines had recovered\nSan Miniato, whereupon it seemed advisable to Castruccio to make peace,\nas it did not appear to him that he was sufficiently secure at Lucca to\nleave him. He approached the Florentines with the proposal of a truce,\nwhich they readily entertained, for they were weary of the war, and\ndesirous of getting rid of the expenses of it. A treaty was concluded\nwith them for two years, by which both parties agreed to keep the\nconquests they had made. Castruccio thus released from this trouble,\nturned his attention to affairs in Lucca, and in order that he should\nnot again be subject to the perils from which he had just escaped, he,\nunder various pretences and reasons, first wiped out all those who by\ntheir ambition might aspire to the principality; not sparing one of\nthem, but depriving them of country and property, and those whom he had\nin his hands of life also, stating that he had found by experience that\nnone of them were to be trusted. Then for his further security he\nraised a fortress in Lucca with the stones of the towers of those whom\nhe had killed or hunted out of the state.\nWhilst Castruccio made peace with the Florentines, and strengthened his\nposition in Lucca, he neglected no opportunity, short of open war, of\nincreasing his importance elsewhere. It appeared to him that if he\ncould get possession of Pistoia, he would have one foot in Florence,\nwhich was his great desire. He, therefore, in various ways made friends\nwith the mountaineers, and worked matters so in Pistoia that both\nparties confided their secrets to him. Pistoia was divided, as it\nalways had been, into the Bianchi and Neri parties; the head of the\nBianchi was Bastiano di Possente, and of the Neri, Jacopo da Gia. Each\nof these men held secret communications with Castruccio, and each\ndesired to drive the other out of the city; and, after many\nthreatenings, they came to blows. Jacopo fortified himself at the\nFlorentine gate, Bastiano at that of the Lucchese side of the city;\nboth trusted more in Castruccio than in the Florentines, because they\nbelieved that Castruccio was far more ready and willing to fight than\nthe Florentines, and they both sent to him for assistance. He gave\npromises to both, saying to Bastiano that he would come in person, and\nto Jacopo that he would send his pupil, Pagolo Guinigi. At the\nappointed time he sent forward Pagolo by way of Pisa, and went himself\ndirect to Pistoia; at midnight both of them met outside the city, and\nboth were admitted as friends. Thus the two leaders entered, and at a\nsignal given by Castruccio, one killed Jacopo da Gia, and the other\nBastiano di Possente, and both took prisoners or killed the partisans\nof either faction. Without further opposition Pistoia passed into the\nhands of Castruccio, who, having forced the Signoria to leave the\npalace, compelled the people to yield obedience to him, making them\nmany promises and remitting their old debts. The countryside flocked to\nthe city to see the new prince, and all were filled with hope and\nquickly settled down, influenced in a great measure by his great\nvalour.\nAbout this time great disturbances arose in Rome, owing to the dearness\nof living which was caused by the absence of the pontiff at Avignon.\nThe German governor, Enrico, was much blamed for what happened\u2014murders\nand tumults following each other daily, without his being able to put\nan end to them. This caused Enrico much anxiety lest the Romans should\ncall in Ruberto, the King of Naples, who would drive the Germans out of\nthe city, and bring back the Pope. Having no nearer friend to whom he\ncould apply for help than Castruccio, he sent to him, begging him not\nonly to give him assistance, but also to come in person to Rome.\nCastruccio considered that he ought not to hesitate to render the\nemperor this service, because he believed that he himself would not be\nsafe if at any time the emperor ceased to hold Rome. Leaving Pagolo\nGuinigi in command at Lucca, Castruccio set out for Rome with six\nhundred horsemen, where he was received by Enrico with the greatest\ndistinction. In a short time the presence of Castruccio obtained such\nrespect for the emperor that, without bloodshed or violence, good order\nwas restored, chiefly by reason of Castruccio having sent by sea from\nthe country round Pisa large quantities of corn, and thus removed the\nsource of the trouble. When he had chastised some of the Roman leaders,\nand admonished others, voluntary obedience was rendered to Enrico.\nCastruccio received many honours, and was made a Roman senator. This\ndignity was assumed with the greatest pomp, Castruccio being clothed in\na brocaded toga, which had the following words embroidered on its\nfront: \u201cI am what God wills.\u201d Whilst on the back was: \u201cWhat God desires\nshall be.\u201d\nDuring this time the Florentines, who were much enraged that Castruccio\nshould have seized Pistoia during the truce, considered how they could\ntempt the city to rebel, to do which they thought would not be\ndifficult in his absence. Among the exiled Pistoians in Florence were\nBaldo Cecchi and Jacopo Baldini, both men of leading and ready to face\ndanger. These men kept up communications with their friends in Pistoia,\nand with the aid of the Florentines entered the city by night, and\nafter driving out some of Castruccio\u2019s officials and partisans, and\nkilling others, they restored the city to its freedom. The news of this\ngreatly angered Castruccio, and taking leave of Enrico, he pressed on\nin great haste to Pistoia. When the Florentines heard of his return,\nknowing that he would lose no time, they decided to intercept him with\ntheir forces in the Val di Nievole, under the belief that by doing so\nthey would cut off his road to Pistoia. Assembling a great army of the\nsupporters of the Guelph cause, the Florentines entered the Pistoian\nterritories. On the other hand, Castruccio reached Montecarlo with his\narmy; and having heard where the Florentines\u2019 lay, he decided not to\nencounter it in the plains of Pistoia, nor to await it in the plains of\nPescia, but, as far as he possibly could, to attack it boldly in the\nPass of Serravalle. He believed that if he succeeded in this design,\nvictory was assured, although he was informed that the Florentines had\nthirty thousand men, whilst he had only twelve thousand. Although he\nhad every confidence in his own abilities and the valour of his troops,\nyet he hesitated to attack his enemy in the open lest he should be\noverwhelmed by numbers. Serravalle is a castle between Pescia and\nPistoia, situated on a hill which blocks the Val di Nievole, not in the\nexact pass, but about a bowshot beyond; the pass itself is in places\nnarrow and steep, whilst in general it ascends gently, but is still\nnarrow, especially at the summit where the waters divide, so that\ntwenty men side by side could hold it. The lord of Serravalle was\nManfred, a German, who, before Castruccio became lord of Pistoia, had\nbeen allowed to remain in possession of the castle, it being common to\nthe Lucchese and the Pistoians, and unclaimed by either\u2014neither of them\nwishing to displace Manfred as long as he kept his promise of\nneutrality, and came under obligations to no one. For these reasons,\nand also because the castle was well fortified, he had always been able\nto maintain his position. It was here that Castruccio had determined to\nfall upon his enemy, for here his few men would have the advantage, and\nthere was no fear lest, seeing the large masses of the hostile force\nbefore they became engaged, they should not stand. As soon as this\ntrouble with Florence arose, Castruccio saw the immense advantage which\npossession of this castle would give him, and having an intimate\nfriendship with a resident in the castle, he managed matters so with\nhim that four hundred of his men were to be admitted into the castle\nthe night before the attack on the Florentines, and the castellan put\nto death.\nCastruccio, having prepared everything, had now to encourage the\nFlorentines to persist in their desire to carry the seat of war away\nfrom Pistoia into the Val di Nievole, therefore he did not move his\narmy from Montecarlo. Thus the Florentines hurried on until they\nreached their encampment under Serravalle, intending to cross the hill\non the following morning. In the meantime, Castruccio had seized the\ncastle at night, had also moved his army from Montecarlo, and marching\nfrom thence at midnight in dead silence, had reached the foot of\nSerravalle: thus he and the Florentines commenced the ascent of the\nhill at the same time in the morning. Castruccio sent forward his\ninfantry by the main road, and a troop of four hundred horsemen by a\npath on the left towards the castle. The Florentines sent forward four\nhundred cavalry ahead of their army which was following, never\nexpecting to find Castruccio in possession of the hill, nor were they\naware of his having seized the castle. Thus it happened that the\nFlorentine horsemen mounting the hill were completely taken by surprise\nwhen they discovered the infantry of Castruccio, and so close were they\nupon it they had scarcely time to pull down their visors. It was a case\nof unready soldiers being attacked by ready, and they were assailed\nwith such vigour that with difficulty they could hold their own,\nalthough some few of them got through. When the noise of the fighting\nreached the Florentine camp below, it was filled with confusion. The\ncavalry and infantry became inextricably mixed: the captains were\nunable to get their men either backward or forward, owing to the\nnarrowness of the pass, and amid all this tumult no one knew what ought\nto be done or what could be done. In a short time the cavalry who were\nengaged with the enemy\u2019s infantry were scattered or killed without\nhaving made any effective defence because of their unfortunate\nposition, although in sheer desperation they had offered a stout\nresistance. Retreat had been impossible, with the mountains on both\nflanks, whilst in front were their enemies, and in the rear their\nfriends. When Castruccio saw that his men were unable to strike a\ndecisive blow at the enemy and put them to flight, he sent one thousand\ninfantrymen round by the castle, with orders to join the four hundred\nhorsemen he had previously dispatched there, and commanded the whole\nforce to fall upon the flank of the enemy. These orders they carried\nout with such fury that the Florentines could not sustain the attack,\nbut gave way, and were soon in full retreat\u2014conquered more by their\nunfortunate position than by the valour of their enemy. Those in the\nrear turned towards Pistoia, and spread through the plains, each man\nseeking only his own safety. The defeat was complete and very\nsanguinary. Many captains were taken prisoners, among whom were Bandini\ndei Rossi, Francesco Brunelleschi, and Giovanni della Tosa, all\nFlorentine noblemen, with many Tuscans and Neapolitans who fought on\nthe Florentine side, having been sent by King Ruberto to assist the\nGuelphs. Immediately the Pistoians heard of this defeat they drove out\nthe friends of the Guelphs, and surrendered to Castruccio. He was not\ncontent with occupying Prato and all the castles on the plains on both\nsides of the Arno, but marched his army into the plain of Peretola,\nabout two miles from Florence. Here he remained many days, dividing the\nspoils, and celebrating his victory with feasts and games, holding\nhorse races, and foot races for men and women. He also struck medals in\ncommemoration of the defeat of the Florentines. He endeavoured to\ncorrupt some of the citizens of Florence, who were to open the city\ngates at night; but the conspiracy was discovered, and the\nparticipators in it taken and beheaded, among whom were Tommaso Lupacci\nand Lambertuccio Frescobaldi. This defeat caused the Florentines great\nanxiety, and despairing of preserving their liberty, they sent envoys\nto King Ruberto of Naples, offering him the dominion of their city; and\nhe, knowing of what immense importance the maintenance of the Guelph\ncause was to him, accepted it. He agreed with the Florentines to\nreceive from them a yearly tribute of two hundred thousand florins, and\nhe sent his son Carlo to Florence with four thousand horsemen.\nShortly after this the Florentines were relieved in some degree of the\npressure of Castruccio\u2019s army, owing to his being compelled to leave\nhis positions before Florence and march on Pisa, in order to suppress a\nconspiracy that had been raised against him by Benedetto Lanfranchi,\none of the first men in Pisa, who could not endure that his fatherland\nshould be under the dominion of the Lucchese. He had formed this\nconspiracy, intending to seize the citadel, kill the partisans of\nCastruccio, and drive out the garrison. As, however, in a conspiracy\npaucity of numbers is essential to secrecy, so for its execution a few\nare not sufficient, and in seeking more adherents to his conspiracy\nLanfranchi encountered a person who revealed the design to Castruccio.\nThis betrayal cannot be passed by without severe reproach to Bonifacio\nCerchi and Giovanni Guidi, two Florentine exiles who were suffering\ntheir banishment in Pisa. Thereupon Castruccio seized Benedetto and put\nhim to death, and beheaded many other noble citizens, and drove their\nfamilies into exile. It now appeared to Castruccio that both Pisa and\nPistoia were thoroughly disaffected; he employed much thought and\nenergy upon securing his position there, and this gave the Florentines\ntheir opportunity to reorganize their army, and to await the coming of\nCarlo, the son of the King of Naples. When Carlo arrived they decided\nto lose no more time, and assembled a great army of more than thirty\nthousand infantry and ten thousand cavalry\u2014having called to their aid\nevery Guelph there was in Italy. They consulted whether they should\nattack Pistoia or Pisa first, and decided that it would be better to\nmarch on the latter\u2014a course, owing to the recent conspiracy, more\nlikely to succeed, and of more advantage to them, because they believed\nthat the surrender of Pistoia would follow the acquisition of Pisa.\nIn the early part of May 1328, the Florentines put in motion this army\nand quickly occupied Lastra, Signa, Montelupo, and Empoli, passing from\nthence on to San Miniato. When Castruccio heard of the enormous army\nwhich the Florentines were sending against him, he was in no degree\nalarmed, believing that the time had now arrived when Fortune would\ndeliver the empire of Tuscany into his hands, for he had no reason to\nthink that his enemy would make a better fight, or had better prospects\nof success, than at Pisa or Serravalle. He assembled twenty thousand\nfoot soldiers and four thousand horsemen, and with this army went to\nFucecchio, whilst he sent Pagolo Guinigi to Pisa with five thousand\ninfantry. Fucecchio has a stronger position than any other town in the\nPisan district, owing to its situation between the rivers Arno and\nGusciana and its slight elevation above the surrounding plain.\nMoreover, the enemy could not hinder its being victualled unless they\ndivided their forces, nor could they approach it either from the\ndirection of Lucca or Pisa, nor could they get through to Pisa, or\nattack Castruccio\u2019s forces except at a disadvantage. In one case they\nwould find themselves placed between his two armies, the one under his\nown command and the other under Pagolo, and in the other case they\nwould have to cross the Arno to get to close quarters with the enemy,\nan undertaking of great hazard. In order to tempt the Florentines to\ntake this latter course, Castruccio withdrew his men from the banks of\nthe river and placed them under the walls of Fucecchio, leaving a wide\nexpanse of land between them and the river.\nThe Florentines, having occupied San Miniato, held a council of war to\ndecide whether they should attack Pisa or the army of Castruccio, and,\nhaving weighed the difficulties of both courses, they decided upon the\nlatter. The river Arno was at that time low enough to be fordable, yet\nthe water reached to the shoulders of the infantrymen and to the\nsaddles of the horsemen. On the morning of 10 June 1328, the\nFlorentines commenced the battle by ordering forward a number of\ncavalry and ten thousand infantry. Castruccio, whose plan of action was\nfixed, and who well knew what to do, at once attacked the Florentines\nwith five thousand infantry and three thousand horsemen, not allowing\nthem to issue from the river before he charged them; he also sent one\nthousand light infantry up the river bank, and the same number down the\nArno. The infantry of the Florentines were so much impeded by their\narms and the water that they were not able to mount the banks of the\nriver, whilst the cavalry had made the passage of the river more\ndifficult for the others, by reason of the few who had crossed having\nbroken up the bed of the river, and this being deep with mud, many of\nthe horses rolled over with their riders and many of them had stuck so\nfast that they could not move. When the Florentine captains saw the\ndifficulties their men were meeting, they withdrew them and moved\nhigher up the river, hoping to find the river bed less treacherous and\nthe banks more adapted for landing. These men were met at the bank by\nthe forces which Castruccio had already sent forward, who, being light\narmed with bucklers and javelins in their hands, let fly with\ntremendous shouts into the faces and bodies of the cavalry. The horses,\nalarmed by the noise and the wounds, would not move forward, and\ntrampled each other in great confusion. The fight between the men of\nCastruccio and those of the enemy who succeeded in crossing was sharp\nand terrible; both sides fought with the utmost desperation and neither\nwould yield. The soldiers of Castruccio fought to drive the others back\ninto the river, whilst the Florentines strove to get a footing on land\nin order to make room for the others pressing forward, who if they\ncould but get out of the water would be able to fight, and in this\nobstinate conflict they were urged on by their captains. Castruccio\nshouted to his men that these were the same enemies whom they had\nbefore conquered at Serravalle, whilst the Florentines reproached each\nother that the many should be overcome by the few. At length\nCastruccio, seeing how long the battle had lasted, and that both his\nmen and the enemy were utterly exhausted, and that both sides had many\nkilled and wounded, pushed forward another body of infantry to take up\na position at the rear of those who were fighting; he then commanded\nthese latter to open their ranks as if they intended to retreat, and\none part of them to turn to the right and another to the left. This\ncleared a space of which the Florentines at once took advantage, and\nthus gained possession of a portion of the battlefield. But when these\ntired soldiers found themselves at close quarters with Castruccio\u2019s\nreserves they could not stand against them and at once fell back into\nthe river. The cavalry of either side had not as yet gained any\ndecisive advantage over the other, because Castruccio, knowing his\ninferiority in this arm, had commanded his leaders only to stand on the\ndefensive against the attacks of their adversaries, as he hoped that\nwhen he had overcome the infantry he would be able to make short work\nof the cavalry. This fell out as he had hoped, for when he saw the\nFlorentine army driven back across the river he ordered the remainder\nof his infantry to attack the cavalry of the enemy. This they did with\nlance and javelin, and, joined by their own cavalry, fell upon the\nenemy with the greatest fury and soon put him to flight. The Florentine\ncaptains, having seen the difficulty their cavalry had met with in\ncrossing the river, had attempted to make their infantry cross lower\ndown the river, in order to attack the flanks of Castruccio\u2019s army. But\nhere, also, the banks were steep and already lined by the men of\nCastruccio, and this movement was quite useless. Thus the Florentines\nwere so completely defeated at all points that scarcely a third of them\nescaped, and Castruccio was again covered with glory. Many captains\nwere taken prisoners, and Carlo, the son of King Ruberto, with\nMichelagnolo Falconi and Taddeo degli Albizzi, the Florentine\ncommissioners, fled to Empoli. If the spoils were great, the slaughter\nwas infinitely greater, as might be expected in such a battle. Of the\nFlorentines there fell twenty thousand two hundred and thirty-one men,\nwhilst Castruccio lost one thousand five hundred and seventy men.\nBut Fortune growing envious of the glory of Castruccio took away his\nlife just at the time when she should have preserved it, and thus\nruined all those plans which for so long a time he had worked to carry\ninto effect, and in the successful prosecution of which nothing but\ndeath could have stopped him. Castruccio was in the thick of the battle\nthe whole of the day; and when the end of it came, although fatigued\nand overheated, he stood at the gate of Fucecchio to welcome his men on\ntheir return from victory and personally thank them. He was also on the\nwatch for any attempt of the enemy to retrieve the fortunes of the day;\nhe being of the opinion that it was the duty of a good general to be\nthe first man in the saddle and the last out of it. Here Castruccio\nstood exposed to a wind which often rises at midday on the banks of the\nArno, and which is often very unhealthy; from this he took a chill, of\nwhich he thought nothing, as he was accustomed to such troubles; but it\nwas the cause of his death. On the following night he was attacked with\nhigh fever, which increased so rapidly that the doctors saw it must\nprove fatal. Castruccio, therefore, called Pagolo Guinigi to him, and\naddressed him as follows:\n\u201cIf I could have believed that Fortune would have cut me off in the\nmidst of the career which was leading to that glory which all my\nsuccesses promised, I should have laboured less, and I should have left\nthee, if a smaller state, at least with fewer enemies and perils,\nbecause I should have been content with the governorships of Lucca and\nPisa. I should neither have subjugated the Pistoians, nor outraged the\nFlorentines with so many injuries. But I would have made both these\npeoples my friends, and I should have lived, if no longer, at least\nmore peacefully, and have left you a state without a doubt smaller, but\none more secure and established on a surer foundation. But Fortune, who\ninsists upon having the arbitrament of human affairs, did not endow me\nwith sufficient judgment to recognize this from the first, nor the time\nto surmount it. Thou hast heard, for many have told thee, and I have\nnever concealed it, how I entered the house of thy father whilst yet a\nboy\u2014a stranger to all those ambitions which every generous soul should\nfeel\u2014and how I was brought up by him, and loved as though I had been\nborn of his blood; how under his governance I learned to be valiant and\ncapable of availing myself of all that fortune, of which thou hast been\nwitness. When thy good father came to die, he committed thee and all\nhis possessions to my care, and I have brought thee up with that love,\nand increased thy estate with that care, which I was bound to show. And\nin order that thou shouldst not only possess the estate which thy\nfather left, but also that which my fortune and abilities have gained,\nI have never married, so that the love of children should never deflect\nmy mind from that gratitude which I owed to the children of thy father.\nThus I leave thee a vast estate, of which I am well content, but I am\ndeeply concerned, inasmuch as I leave it thee unsettled and insecure.\nThou hast the city of Lucca on thy hands, which will never rest\ncontented under thy government. Thou hast also Pisa, where the men are\nof nature changeable and unreliable, who, although they may be\nsometimes held in subjection, yet they will ever disdain to serve under\na Lucchese. Pistoia is also disloyal to thee, she being eaten up with\nfactions and deeply incensed against thy family by reason of the wrongs\nrecently inflicted upon them. Thou hast for neighbours the offended\nFlorentines, injured by us in a thousand ways, but not utterly\ndestroyed, who will hail the news of my death with more delight than\nthey would the acquisition of all Tuscany. In the Emperor and in the\nprinces of Milan thou canst place no reliance, for they are far\ndistant, slow, and their help is very long in coming. Therefore, thou\nhast no hope in anything but in thine own abilities, and in the memory\nof my valour, and in the prestige which this latest victory has brought\nthee; which, as thou knowest how to use it with prudence, will assist\nthee to come to terms with the Florentines, who, as they are suffering\nunder this great defeat, should be inclined to listen to thee. And\nwhereas I have sought to make them my enemies, because I believed that\nwar with them would conduce to my power and glory, thou hast every\ninducement to make friends of them, because their alliance will bring\nthee advantages and security. It is of the greatest important in this\nworld that a man should know himself, and the measure of his own\nstrength and means; and he who knows that he has not a genius for\nfighting must learn how to govern by the arts of peace. And it will be\nwell for thee to rule thy conduct by my counsel, and to learn in this\nway to enjoy what my life-work and dangers have gained; and in this\nthou wilt easily succeed when thou hast learnt to believe that what I\nhave told thee is true. And thou wilt be doubly indebted to me, in that\nI have left thee this realm and have taught thee how to keep it.\u201d\nAfter this there came to Castruccio those citizens of Pisa, Pistoia,\nand Lucca, who had been fighting at his side, and whilst recommending\nPagolo to them, and making them swear obedience to him as his\nsuccessor, he died. He left a happy memory to those who had known him,\nand no prince of those times was ever loved with such devotion as he\nwas. His obsequies were celebrated with every sign of mourning, and he\nwas buried in San Francesco at Lucca. Fortune was not so friendly to\nPagolo Guinigi as she had been to Castruccio, for he had not the\nabilities. Not long after the death of Castruccio, Pagolo lost Pisa,\nand then Pistoia, and only with difficulty held on to Lucca. This\nlatter city continued in the family of Guinigi until the time of the\ngreat-grandson of Pagolo.\nFrom what has been related here it will be seen that Castruccio was a\nman of exceptional abilities, not only measured by men of his own time,\nbut also by those of an earlier date. In stature he was above the\nordinary height, and perfectly proportioned. He was of a gracious\npresence, and he welcomed men with such urbanity that those who spoke\nwith him rarely left him displeased. His hair was inclined to be red,\nand he wore it cut short above the ears, and, whether it rained or\nsnowed, he always went without a hat. He was delightful among friends,\nbut terrible to his enemies; just to his subjects; ready to play false\nwith the unfaithful, and willing to overcome by fraud those whom he\ndesired to subdue, because he was wont to say that it was the victory\nthat brought the glory, not the methods of achieving it. No one was\nbolder in facing danger, none more prudent in extricating himself. He\nwas accustomed to say that men ought to attempt everything and fear\nnothing; that God is a lover of strong men, because one always sees\nthat the weak are chastised by the strong. He was also wonderfully\nsharp or biting though courteous in his answers; and as he did not look\nfor any indulgence in this way of speaking from others, so he was not\nangered with others did not show it to him. It has often happened that\nhe has listened quietly when others have spoken sharply to him, as on\nthe following occasions. He had caused a ducat to be given for a\npartridge, and was taken to task for doing so by a friend, to whom\nCastruccio had said: \u201cYou would not have given more than a penny.\u201d\n\u201cThat is true,\u201d answered the friend. Then said Castruccio to him: \u201cA\nducat is much less to me.\u201d Having about him a flatterer on whom he had\nspat to show that he scorned him, the flatterer said to him: \u201cFisherman\nare willing to let the waters of the sea saturate them in order that\nthey may take a few little fishes, and I allow myself to be wetted by\nspittle that I may catch a whale\u201d; and this was not only heard by\nCastruccio with patience but rewarded. When told by a priest that it\nwas wicked for him to live so sumptuously, Castruccio said: \u201cIf that be\na vice then you should not fare so splendidly at the feasts of our\nsaints.\u201d Passing through a street he saw a young man as he came out of\na house of ill fame blush at being seen by Castruccio, and said to him:\n\u201cThou shouldst not be ashamed when thou comest out, but when thou goest\ninto such places.\u201d A friend gave him a very curiously tied knot to undo\nand was told: \u201cFool, do you think that I wish to untie a thing which\ngave so much trouble to fasten.\u201d Castruccio said to one who professed\nto be a philosopher: \u201cYou are like the dogs who always run after those\nwho will give them the best to eat,\u201d and was answered: \u201cWe are rather\nlike the doctors who go to the houses of those who have the greatest\nneed of them.\u201d Going by water from Pisa to Leghorn, Castruccio was much\ndisturbed by a dangerous storm that sprang up, and was reproached for\ncowardice by one of those with him, who said that he did not fear\nanything. Castruccio answered that he did not wonder at that, since\nevery man valued his soul for what is was worth. Being asked by one\nwhat he ought to do to gain estimation, he said: \u201cWhen thou goest to a\nbanquet take care that thou dost not seat one piece of wood upon\nanother.\u201d To a person who was boasting that he had read many things,\nCastruccio said: \u201cHe knows better than to boast of remembering many\nthings.\u201d Someone bragged that he could drink much without becoming\nintoxicated. Castruccio replied: \u201cAn ox does the same.\u201d Castruccio was\nacquainted with a girl with whom he had intimate relations, and being\nblamed by a friend who told him that it was undignified for him to be\ntaken in by a woman, he said: \u201cShe has not taken me in, I have taken\nher.\u201d Being also blamed for eating very dainty foods, he answered:\n\u201cThou dost not spend as much as I do?\u201d and being told that it was true,\nhe continued: \u201cThen thou art more avaricious than I am gluttonous.\u201d\nBeing invited by Taddeo Bernardi, a very rich and splendid citizen of\nLuca, to supper, he went to the house and was shown by Taddeo into a\nchamber hung with silk and paved with fine stones representing flowers\nand foliage of the most beautiful colouring. Castruccio gathered some\nsaliva in his mouth and spat it out upon Taddeo, and seeing him much\ndisturbed by this, said to him: \u201cI knew not where to spit in order to\noffend thee less.\u201d Being asked how Caesar died he said: \u201cGod willing I\nwill die as he did.\u201d Being one night in the house of one of his\ngentlemen where many ladies were assembled, he was reproved by one of\nhis friends for dancing and amusing himself with them more than was\nusual in one of his station, so he said: \u201cHe who is considered wise by\nday will not be considered a fool at night.\u201d A person came to demand a\nfavour of Castruccio, and thinking he was not listening to his plea\nthrew himself on his knees to the ground, and being sharply reproved by\nCastruccio, said: \u201cThou art the reason of my acting thus for thou hast\nthy ears in thy feet,\u201d whereupon he obtained double the favour he had\nasked. Castruccio used to say that the way to hell was an easy one,\nseeing that it was in a downward direction and you travelled\nblindfolded. Being asked a favour by one who used many superfluous\nwords, he said to him: \u201cWhen you have another request to make, send\nsomeone else to make it.\u201d Having been wearied by a similar man with a\nlong oration who wound up by saying: \u201cPerhaps I have fatigued you by\nspeaking so long,\u201d Castruccio said: \u201cYou have not, because I have not\nlistened to a word you said.\u201d He used to say of one who had been a\nbeautiful child and who afterwards became a fine man, that he was\ndangerous, because he first took the husbands from the wives and now he\ntook the wives from their husbands. To an envious man who laughed, he\nsaid: \u201cDo you laugh because you are successful or because another is\nunfortunate?\u201d Whilst he was still in the charge of Messer Francesco\nGuinigi, one of his companions said to him: \u201cWhat shall I give you if\nyou will let me give you a blow on the nose?\u201d Castruccio answered: \u201cA\nhelmet.\u201d Having put to death a citizen of Lucca who had been\ninstrumental in raising him to power, and being told that he had done\nwrong to kill one of his old friends, he answered that people deceived\nthemselves; he had only killed a new enemy. Castruccio praised greatly\nthose men who intended to take a wife and then did not do so, saying\nthat they were like men who said they would go to sea, and then refused\nwhen the time came. He said that it always struck him with surprise\nthat whilst men in buying an earthen or glass vase would sound it first\nto learn if it were good, yet in choosing a wife they were content with\nonly looking at her. He was once asked in what manner he would wish to\nbe buried when he died, and answered: \u201cWith the face turned downwards,\nfor I know when I am gone this country will be turned upside down.\u201d On\nbeing asked if it had ever occurred to him to become a friar in order\nto save his soul, he answered that it had not, because it appeared\nstrange to him that Fra Lazerone should go to Paradise and Uguccione\ndella Faggiuola to the Inferno. He was once asked when should a man eat\nto preserve his health, and replied: \u201cIf the man be rich let him eat\nwhen he is hungry; if he be poor, then when he can.\u201d Seeing one of his\ngentlemen make a member of his family lace him up, he said to him: \u201cI\npray God that you will let him feed you also.\u201d Seeing that someone had\nwritten upon his house in Latin the words: \u201cMay God preserve this house\nfrom the wicked,\u201d he said, \u201cThe owner must never go in.\u201d Passing\nthrough one of the streets he saw a small house with a very large door,\nand remarked: \u201cThat house will fly through the door.\u201d He was having a\ndiscussion with the ambassador of the King of Naples concerning the\nproperty of some banished nobles, when a dispute arose between them,\nand the ambassador asked him if he had no fear of the king. \u201cIs this\nking of yours a bad man or a good one?\u201d asked Castruccio, and was told\nthat he was a good one, whereupon he said, \u201cWhy should you suggest that\nI should be afraid of a good man?\u201d\nI could recount many other stories of his sayings both witty and\nweighty, but I think that the above will be sufficient testimony to his\nhigh qualities. He lived forty-four years, and was in every way a\nprince. And as he was surrounded by many evidences of his good fortune,\nso he also desired to have near him some memorials of his bad fortune;\ntherefore the manacles with which he was chained in prison are to be\nseen to this day fixed up in the tower of his residence, where they\nwere placed by him to testify forever to his days of adversity. As in\nhis life he was inferior neither to Philip of Macedon, the father of\nAlexander, nor to Scipio of Rome, so he died in the same year of his\nage as they did, and he would doubtless have excelled both of them had\nFortune decreed that he should be born, not in Lucca, but in Macedonia\nor Rome.", "source": "the_prince.txt"}

The method\nadopted, when one of these provinces had to be relieved of its\nsuperabundant population, was to divide into three parts, each\ncontaining an equal number of nobles and of people, of rich and of poor.\nThe third upon whom the lot fell, then went in search of new abodes,\nleaving the remaining two-thirds in possession of their native country.\nThese migrating masses destroyed the Roman empire by the facilities for\nsettlement which the country offered when the emperors abandoned\nRome, the ancient seat of their dominion, and fixed their residence at\nConstantinople; for by this step they exposed the western empire to\nthe rapine of both their ministers and their enemies, the remoteness of\ntheir position preventing them either from seeing or providing for\nits necessities. To suffer the overthrow of such an extensive empire,\nestablished by the blood of so many brave and virtuous men, showed no\nless folly in the princes themselves than infidelity in their ministers;\nfor not one irruption alone, but many, contributed to its ruin;\nand these barbarians exhibited much ability and perseverance in\naccomplishing their object.\nThe first of these northern nations that invaded the empire after the\nCimbrians, who were conquered by Caius Marius, was the Visigoths--which\nname in our language signifies \"Western Goths.\" These, after some\nbattles fought along its confines, long held their seat of dominion upon\nthe Danube, with consent of the emperors; and although, moved by various\ncauses, they often attacked the Roman provinces, were always kept in\nsubjection by the imperial forces. The emperor Theodosius conquered them\nwith great glory; and, being wholly reduced to his power, they no longer\nselected a sovereign of their own, but, satisfied with the terms which\nhe granted them, lived and fought under his ensigns, and authority. On\nthe death of Theodosius, his sons Arcadius and Honorius, succeeded to\nthe empire, but not to the talents and fortune of their father; and\nthe times became changed with the princes. Theodosius had appointed a\ngovernor to each of the three divisions of the empire, Ruffinus to the\neastern, to the western Stilicho, and Gildo to the African. Each of\nthese, after the death of Theodosius, determined not to be governors\nmerely, but to assume sovereign dominion over their respective\nprovinces. Gildo and Ruffinus were suppressed at their outset; but\nStilicho, concealing his design, ingratiated himself with the new\nemperors, and at the same time so disturbed their government, as to\nfacilitate his occupation of it afterward. To make the Visigoths their\nenemies, he advised that the accustomed stipend allowed to this people\nshould be withheld; and as he thought these enemies would not\nbe sufficient alone to disturb the empire, he contrived that the\nBurgundians, Franks, Vandals, and Alans (a northern people in search of\nnew habitations), should assail the Roman provinces.\nThat they might be better able to avenge themselves for the injury\nthey had sustained, the Visigoths, on being deprived of their subsidy,\ncreated Alaric their king; and having assailed the empire, succeeded,\nafter many reverses, in overrunning Italy, and finally in pillaging\nRome.\nAfter this victory, Alaric died, and his successor, Astolphus, having\nmarried Placidia, sister of the emperors, agreed with them to go to\nthe relief of Gaul and Spain, which provinces had been assailed by\nthe Vandals, Burgundians, Alans, and Franks, from the causes before\nmentioned. Hence it followed, that the Vandals, who had occupied that\npart of Spain called Betica (now Andalusia), being pressed by the\nVisigoths, and unable to resist them, were invited by Boniface, who\ngoverned Africa for the empire, to occupy that province; for, being in\nrebellion, he was afraid his error would become known to the emperor.\nFor these reasons the Vandals gladly undertook the enterprise, and under\nGenseric, their king, became lords of Africa.\nAt this time Theodosius, son of Arcadius, succeeded to the empire; and,\nbestowing little attention on the affairs of the west, caused those who\nhad taken possession to think of securing their acquisitions. Thus the\nVandals ruled Africa; the Alans and Visigoths, Spain; while the Franks\nand Burgundians not only took Gaul, but each gave their name to the part\nthey occupied; hence one is called France, the other Burgundy. The good\nfortune of these brought fresh people to the destruction of the empire,\none of which, the Huns, occupied the province of Pannonia, situated upon\nthe nearer shore of the Danube, and which, from their name, is still\ncalled Hungary. To these disorders it must be added, that the emperor,\nseeing himself attacked on so many sides, to lessen the number of his\nenemies, began to treat first with the Vandals, then with the Franks;\na course which diminished his own power, and increased that of the\nbarbarians. Nor was the island of Britain, which is now called England,\nsecure from them; for the Britons, being apprehensive of those who had\noccupied Gaul, called the Angli, a people of Germany, to their aid; and\nthese under Vortigern their king, first defended, and then drove them\nfrom the island, of which they took possession, and after themselves\nnamed the country England. But the inhabitants, being robbed of their\nhome, became desperate by necessity and resolved to take possession of\nsome other country, although they had been unable to defend their own.\nThey therefore crossed the sea with their families, and settled in the\ncountry nearest to the beach, which from themselves is called Brittany.\nThe Huns, who were said above to have occupied Pannonia, joining with\nother nations, as the Zepidi, Eurili, Turingi, and Ostro, or eastern\nGoths, moved in search of new countries, and not being able to enter\nFrance, which was defended by the forces of the barbarians, came into\nItaly under Attila their king. He, a short time previously, in order to\npossess the entire monarchy, had murdered his brother Bleda; and having\nthus become very powerful, Andaric, king of the Zepidi, and Velamir,\nking of the Ostrogoths, became subject to him. Attila, having entered\nItaly, laid siege to Aquileia, where he remained without any\nobstacle for two years, wasting the country round, and dispersing the\ninhabitants. This, as will be related in its place, caused the origin\nof Venice. After the taking and ruin of Aquileia, he directed his course\ntowards Rome, from the destruction of which he abstained at the entreaty\nof the pontiff, his respect for whom was so great that he left Italy and\nretired into Austria, where he died. After the death of Attila, Velamir,\nking of the Ostrogoths, and the heads of the other nations, took arms\nagainst his sons Henry and Uric, slew the one and compelled the other,\nwith his Huns, to repass the Danube and return to their country; while\nthe Ostrogoths and the Zepidi established themselves in Pannonia, and\nthe Eruli and the Turingi upon the farther bank of the Danube.\nAttila having left Italy, Valentinian, emperor of the west, thought of\nrestoring the country; and, that he might be more ready to defend\nit against the barbarians, abandoned Rome, and removed the seat of\ngovernment to Ravenna. The misfortunes which befell the western empire\ncaused the emperor, who resided at Constantinople, on many occasions to\ngive up the possession of it to others, as a charge full of danger\nand expense; and sometimes, without his permission, the Romans, seeing\nthemselves so abandoned, created an emperor for their defense, or\nsuffered some one to usurp the dominion. This occurred at the period\nof which we now speak, when Maximus, a Roman, after the death of\nValentinian, seized the government, and compelled Eudocia, widow of the\nlate emperor, to take him for her husband; but she, being of imperial\nblood, scorned the connection of a private citizen; and being anxious to\navenge herself for the insult, secretly persuaded Genseric, king of the\nVandals and master of Africa to come to Italy, representing to him the\nadvantage he would derive from the undertaking, and the facility with\nwhich it might be accomplished. Tempted by the hope of booty, he came\nimmediately, and finding Rome abandoned, plundered the city during\nfourteen days. He also ravaged many other places in Italy, and then,\nloaded with wealth, withdrew to Africa. The Romans, having returned\nto their city, and Maximus being dead, elected Avitus, a Roman, as his\nsuccessor. After this, several important events occurred both in Italy\nand in the countries beyond; and after the deaths of many emperors\nthe empire of Constantinople devolved upon Zeno, and that of Rome upon\nOrestes and Augustulus his son, who obtained the sovereignty by fraud.\nWhile they were designing to hold by force what they had obtained by\ntreachery, the Eruli and the Turingi, who, after the death of Attila, as\nbefore remarked, had established themselves upon the farther bank of\nthe Danube, united in a league and invaded Italy under Odoacer their\ngeneral. Into the districts which they left unoccupied, the Longobardi\nor Lombards, also a northern people, entered, led by Godogo their king.\nOdoacer conquered and slew Orestes near Pavia, but Augustulus escaped.\nAfter this victory, that Rome might, with her change of power, also\nchange her title, Odoacer, instead of using the imperial name, caused\nhimself to be declared king of Rome. He was the first of those leaders\nwho at this period overran the world and thought of settling in Italy;\nfor the others, either from fear that they should not be able to hold\nthe country, knowing that it might easily be relieved by the eastern\nemperors, or from some unknown cause, after plundering her, sought other\ncountries wherein to establish themselves.\nCHAPTER II\nState of the Roman empire under Zeno--Theodoric king of the\nOstrogoths--Character of Theodoric--Changes in the Roman empire--New\nlanguages--New names--Theodoric dies--Belisarius in Italy--Totila takes\nRome--Narses destroys the Goths--New form of Government in Italy--Narses\ninvites the Lombards into Italy--The Lombards change the form of\ngovernment.\nAt this time the ancient Roman empire was governed by the following\nprinces: Zeno, reigning in Constantinople, commanded the whole of the\neastern empire; the Ostrogoths ruled Mesia and Pannonia; the Visigoths,\nSuavi, and Alans, held Gascony and Spain; the Vandals, Africa; the\nFranks and Burgundians, France; and the Eruli and Turingi, Italy. The\nkingdom of the Ostrogoths had descended to Theodoric, nephew of Velamir,\nwho, being on terms of friendship with Zeno the eastern emperor, wrote\nto him that his Ostrogoths thought it an injustice that they, being\nsuperior in valor to the people thereabout, should be inferior to them\nin dominion, and that it was impossible for him to restrain them within\nthe limits of Pannonia. So, seeing himself under the necessity of\nallowing them to take arms and go in search of new abodes, he wished\nfirst to acquaint Zeno with it, in order that he might provide for them,\nby granting some country in which they might establish themselves, by\nhis good favor with greater propriety and convenience. Zeno, partly\nfrom fear and partly from a desire to drive Odoacer out of Italy, gave\nTheodoric permission to lead his people against him, and take possession\nof the country. Leaving his friends the Zepidi in Pannonia, Theodoric\nmarched into Italy, slew Odoacer and his son, and, moved by the same\nreasons which had induced Valentinian to do so, established his court at\nRavenna, and like Odoacer took the title of king of Italy.\nTheodoric possessed great talents both for war and peace; in the former\nhe was always conqueror, and in the latter he conferred very great\nbenefits upon the cities and people under him. He distributed the\nOstrogoths over the country, each district under its leader, that he\nmight more conveniently command them in war, and govern them in peace.\nHe enlarged Ravenna, restored Rome, and, with the exception of military\ndiscipline, conferred upon the Romans every honor. He kept within\ntheir proper bounds, wholly by the influence of his character, all the\nbarbarian kings who occupied the empire; he built towns and fortresses\nbetween the point of the Adriatic and the Alps, in order, with the\ngreater facility, to impede the passage of any new hordes of barbarians\nwho might design to assail Italy; and if, toward the latter end of his\nlife, so many virtues had not been sullied by acts of cruelty, caused\nby various jealousies of his people, such as the death of Symmachus and\nBoethius, men of great holiness, every point of his character would have\ndeserved the highest praise. By his virtue and goodness, not only\nRome and Italy, but every part of the western empire, freed from the\ncontinual troubles which they had suffered from the frequent influx\nof barbarians, acquired new vigor, and began to live in an orderly and\ncivilized manner. For surely if any times were truly miserable for\nItaly and the provinces overrun by the barbarians, they were those which\noccurred from Arcadius and Honorius to Theodoric. If we only consider\nthe evils which arise to a republic or a kingdom by a change of prince\nor of government; not by foreign interference, but by civil discord (in\nwhich we may see how even slight variations suffice to ruin the most\npowerful kingdoms or states), we may then easily imagine how much Italy\nand the other Roman provinces suffered, when they not only changed their\nforms of government and their princes, but also their laws, customs,\nmodes of living, religion, language, and name. Any one of such changes,\nby itself, without being united with others, might, with thinking of\nit, to say nothing of the seeing and suffering, infuse terror into the\nstrongest minds.\nFrom these causes proceeded the ruin as well as the origin and extension\nof many cities. Among those which were ruined were Aquileia, Luni,\nChiusi, Popolonia, Fiesole, and many others. The new cities were Venice,\nSienna, Ferrara, Aquila, with many towns and castles which for brevity\nwe omit. Those which became extended were Florence, Genoa, Pisa,\nMilan, Naples, and Bologna; to all of which may be added, the ruin and\nrestoration of Rome, and of many other cities not previously mentioned.\nFrom this devastation and new population arose new languages, as we see\nin the different dialects of France, Spain and Italy; which, partaking\nof the native idiom of the new people and of the old Roman, formed a\nnew manner of discourse. Besides, not only were the names of provinces\nchanged, but also of lakes, rivers, seas, and men; for France, Spain,\nand Italy are full of fresh names, wholly different from the\nancient; as, omitting many others, we see that the Po, the Garda, the\nArchipelago, are names quite different from those which the ancients\nused; while instead of C\u00e6sar and Pompey we have Peter, Matthew, John,\netc.\nAmong so many variations, that of religion was not of little importance;\nfor, while combating the customs of the ancient faith with the miracles\nof the new, very serious troubles and discords were created among men.\nAnd if the Christians had been united in one faith, fewer disorders\nwould have followed; but the contentions among themselves, of the\nchurches of Rome, Greece, and Ravenna, joined to those of the heretic\nsects with the Catholics, served in many ways to render the world\nmiserable. Africa is a proof of this; having suffered more horrors from\nthe Arian sect, whose doctrines were believed by the Vandals, than from\nany avarice or natural cruelty of the people themselves. Living amid so\nmany persecutions, the countenances of men bore witness of the terrible\nimpressions upon their minds; for besides the evils they suffered from\nthe disordered state of the world, they scarcely could have recourse to\nthe help of God, in whom the unhappy hope for relief; for the greater\npart of them, being uncertain what divinity they ought to address, died\nmiserably, without help and without hope.\nHaving been the first who put a stop to so many evils, Theodoric\ndeserves the highest praise: for during the thirty-eight years he\nreigned in Italy, he brought the country to such a state of greatness\nthat her previous sufferings were no longer recognizable. But at his\ndeath, the kingdom descending to Atalaric, son of Amalasontha, his\ndaughter, and the malice of fortune not being yet exhausted, the old\nevils soon returned; for Atalaric died soon after his grandfather, and\nthe kingdom coming into the possession of his mother, she was betrayed\nby Theodatus, whom she had called to assist her in the government. He\nput her to death and made himself king; and having thus become odious\nto the Ostrogoths, the emperor Justinian entertained the hope of driving\nhim out of Italy. Justinian appointed Belisarius to the command of this\nexpedition, as he had already conquered Africa, expelled the Vandals,\nand reduced the country to the imperial rule.\nBelisarius took possession of Sicily, and from thence passing into\nItaly, occupied Naples and Rome. The Goths, seeing this, slew Theodatus\ntheir king, whom they considered the cause of their misfortune, and\nelected Vitiges in his stead, who, after some skirmishes, was besieged\nand taken by Belisarius at Ravenna; but before he had time to secure\nthe advantages of his victory, Belisarius was recalled by Justinian, and\nJoannes and Vitalis were appointed in his place. Their principles and\npractices were so different from those of Belisarius, that the Goths\ntook courage and created Ildovadus, governor of Verona, their king.\nAfter Ildovadus, who was slain, came Totila, who routed the imperial\nforces, took Tuscany and Naples, and recovered nearly the whole of what\nBelisarius had taken from them. On this account Justinian determined to\nsend him into Italy again; but, coming with only a small force, he lost\nthe reputation which his former victories had won for him, in less time\nthan he had taken to acquire it. Totila being at Ostia with his forces,\ntook Rome before his eyes; but being unable to hold or to leave the\ncity, he destroyed the greater part of it, drove out the citizens, and\ntook the senators away from him. Thinking little of Belisarius, he led\nhis people into Calabria, to attack the forces which had been sent from\nGreece.\nBelisarius, seeing the city abandoned, turned his mind to the\nperformance of an honourable work. Viewing the ruins of Rome, he\ndetermined to rebuild her walls and recall her inhabitants with as\nlittle delay as possible. But fortune was opposed to this laudable\nenterprise; for Justinian, being at this time assailed by the Parthians,\nrecalled him; and his duty to his sovereign compelled him to abandon\nItaly to Totila, who again took Rome, but did not treat her with\nsuch severity as upon the former occasion; for at the entreaty of\nSt. Benedict, who in those days had great reputation for sanctity, he\nendeavored to restore her. In the meantime, Justinian having arranged\nmatters with the Parthians, again thought of sending a force to the\nrelief of Italy; but the Sclavi, another northern people, having crossed\nthe Danube and attacked Illyria and Thrace, prevented him, so that\nTotila held almost the whole country. Having conquered the Slavonians,\nJustinian sent Narses, a eunuch, a man of great military talent, who,\nhaving arrived in Italy, routed and slew Totila. The Goths who escaped\nsought refuge in Pavia, where they created Teias their king. On the\nother hand, Narses after the victory took Rome, and coming to an\nengagement with Teias near Nocera, slew him and routed his army. By this\nvictory, the power of the Goths in Italy was quite annihilated, after\nhaving existed for seventy years, from the coming of Theodoric to the\ndeath of Teias.\nNo sooner was Italy delivered from the Goths than Justinian died, and\nwas succeeded by Justin, his son, who, at the instigation of Sophia, his\nwife, recalled Narses, and sent Longinus in his stead. Like those who\npreceded him, he made his abode at Ravenna, and besides this, gave a\nnew form to the government of Italy; for he did not appoint governors\nof provinces, as the Goths had done, but in every city and town of\nimportance placed a ruler whom he called a duke. Neither in this\narrangement did he respect Rome more than the other cities; for having\nset aside the consuls and senate, names which up to this time had been\npreserved, he placed her under a duke, who was sent every year from\nRavenna, and called her the duchy of Rome; while to him who remained in\nRavenna, and governed the whole of Italy for the emperor, was given the\nname of Exarch. This division of the country greatly facilitated the\nruin of Italy, and gave the Lombards an early occasion of occupying it.\nNarses was greatly enraged with the emperor, for having recalled him\nfrom the government of the province, which he had won with his own valor\nand blood; while Sophia, not content with the injury done by withdrawing\nhim, treated him in the most offensive manner, saying she wished him\nto come back that he might spin with the other eunuchs. Full of\nindignation, Narses persuaded Alboin, king of the Lombards, who then\nreigned in Pannonia, to invade and take possession of Italy.\nThe Lombards, as was said before, occupied those places upon the Danube\nwhich had been vacated by the Eruli and Turingi, when Odoacer their king\nled them into Italy; where, having been established for some time, their\ndominions were held by Alboin, a man ferocious and bold, under whom they\ncrossed the Danube, and coming to an engagement with Cunimund, king of\nthe Zepidi, who held Pannonia, conquered and slew him. Alboin finding\nRosamond, daughter of Cunimund, among the captives, took her to wife,\nand made himself sovereign of Pannonia; and, moved by his savage nature,\ncaused the skull of Cunimund to be formed into a cup, from which, in\nmemory of the victory, he drank. Being invited into Italy by Narses,\nwith whom he had been in friendship during the war with the Goths, he\nleft Pannonia to the Huns, who after the death of Attila had returned\nto their country. Finding, on his arrival, the province divided into\nso many parts, he presently occupied Pavia, Milan, Verona, Vicenza, the\nwhole of Tuscany, and the greater part of Flamminia, which is now called\nRomagna. These great and rapid acquisitions made him think the conquest\nof Italy already secured; he therefore gave a great feast at Verona, and\nhaving become elevated with wine, ordered the skull of Cunimund to be\nfilled, and caused it to be presented to the queen Rosamond, who sat\nopposite, saying loud enough for her to hear, that upon occasion of\nsuch great joy she should drink with her father. These words were like\na dagger to the lady's bosom and she resolved to have revenge. Knowing\nthat Helmichis, a noble Lombard, was in love with one of her maids, she\narranged with the young woman, that Helmichis, without being acquainted\nwith the fact, should sleep with her instead of his mistress. Having\neffected her design, Rosamond discovered herself to Helmichis, and gave\nhim the choice either of killing Alboin, and taking herself and the\nkingdom as his reward, or of being put to death as the ravisher of the\nqueen. Helmichis consented to destroy Alboin; but after the murder,\nfinding they could not occupy the kingdom, and fearful that the Lombards\nwould put them to death for the love they bore to Alboin, they seized\nthe royal treasure, and fled with it to Longinus, at Ravenna, who\nreceived them favorably.\nDuring these troubles the emperor Justinus died, and was succeeded by\nTiberius, who, occupied in the wars with the Parthians, could not attend\nto the affairs of Italy; and this seeming to Longinus to present an\nopportunity, by means of Rosamond and her wealth, of becoming king of\nthe Lombards and of the whole of Italy, he communicated his design\nto her, persuaded her to destroy Helmichis, and so take him for her\nhusband. To this end, having prepared poisoned wine, she with her own\nhand presented it to Helmichis, who complained of thirst as he came\nfrom the bath. Having drunk half of it, he suspected the truth, from\nthe unusual sensation it occasioned and compelled her to drink the\nremainder; so that in a few hours both came to their end, and Longinus\nwas deprived of the hope of becoming king.\nIn the meantime the Lombards, having drawn themselves together in Pavia,\nwhich was become the principal seat of their empire, made Clefis their\nking. He rebuilt Imola, destroyed by Narses, and occupied Remini\nand almost every place up to Rome; but he died in the course of his\nvictories. Clefis was cruel to such a degree, not only toward strangers,\nbut to his own Lombards, that these people, sickened of royal power, did\nnot create another king, but appointed among themselves thirty dukes to\ngovern the rest. This prevented the Lombards from occupying the whole\nof Italy, or of extending their dominion further than Benevento; for, of\nthe cities of Rome, Ravenna, Cremona, Mantua, Padua, Monselice, Parma,\nBologna, Faenza, Forli, and Cesena, some defended themselves for a time,\nand others never fell under their dominion; since, not having a king,\nthey became less prompt for war, and when they afterward appointed one,\nthey were, by living in freedom, become less obedient, and more apt to\nquarrel among themselves; which from the first prevented a fortunate\nissue of their military expeditions, and was the ultimate cause of their\nbeing driven out of Italy. The affairs of the Lombards being in the\nstate just described, the Romans and Longinus came to an agreement with\nthem, that each should lay down their arms and enjoy what they already\npossessed.\nCHAPTER III\nBeginning of the greatness of the pontiffs in Italy--Abuse of censures\nand indulgences--The pope applies to Pepin, king of France, for\nassistance--Donation of Pepin to the pontiff--Charlemagne--End of the\nkingdom of the Lombards--The title of cardinal begins to be used--The\nempire passes to the Germans--Berengarius, duke of Fruili, created\nking of Italy--Pisa becomes great--Order and division of the states of\nItaly--Electors of the emperor created.\nIn these times the popes began to acquire greater temporal authority\nthan they had previously possessed; although the immediate successors of\nSt. Peter were more reverenced for the holiness of their lives, and the\nmiracles which they performed; and their example so greatly extended the\nChristian religion, that princes of other states embraced it, in order\nto obviate the confusion which prevailed at that period. The emperor\nhaving become a Christian and returned to Constantinople, it followed,\nas was remarked at the commencement of the book, that the Roman empire\nwas the more easily ruined, and the church more rapidly increased her\nauthority. Nevertheless, the whole of Italy, being subject either to the\nemperors or the kings till the coming of the Lombards, the popes never\nacquired any greater authority than what reverence for their habits and\ndoctrine gave them. In other respects they obeyed the emperors or kings;\nofficiated for them in their affairs, as ministers or agents, and were\neven sometimes put to death by them. He who caused them to become of\nmore importance in the affairs of Italy, was Theodoric, king of the\nGoths, when he established the seat of his empire at Ravenna; for, Rome\nbeing without a prince, the Romans found it necessary, for their safety,\nto yield obedience to the pope; his authority, however, was not greatly\nincreased thereby, the only advantage being, that the church of Rome was\nallowed to take precedence of that of Ravenna. But the Lombards having\ntaken possession, and Italy being divided into many parts, the pope had\nan opportunity of greater exertion. Being as it were the head of Rome,\nboth the emperor of Constantinople and the Lombards respected him; so\nthat the Romans, by his means, entered into league with the Lombards,\nand with Longinus, not as subjects, but as equals. Thus the popes,\nat one time friends of the Greeks, and at another of the Lombards,\nincreased their own power; but upon the ruin of the eastern empire,\nwhich occurred during the time of Heraclius, their influence was\nreduced; for the Sclavi, of whom we spoke before, again assailed\nIllyria, and having occupied the country, named it Sclavonia, after\nthemselves; and the other parts were attacked by the Persians, then by\nthe Saracens under Mohammed, and lastly by the Turks, who took Syria,\nAfrica, and Egypt. These causes induced the reigning pope, in his\ndistress, to seek new friends, and he applied to the king of France.\nNearly all the wars which the northern barbarians carried on in Italy,\nit may be here remarked, were occasioned by the pontiffs; and the\nhordes, with which the country was inundated, were generally called in\nby them. The same mode of proceeding still continued, and kept Italy\nweak and unsettled. And, therefore, in relating the events which have\ntaken place from those times to the present, the ruin of the empire will\nbe no longer illustrated, but only the increase of the pontificate and\nof the other principalities which ruled Italy till the coming of Charles\nVIII. It will be seen how the popes, first with censures, and afterward\nwith these and arms, mingled with indulgences, became both terrible and\nvenerable; and how, from having abused both, they ceased to possess\nany influence, and were wholly dependent on the will of others for\nassistance in their wars.\nBut to return to the order of our narration. Gregory III. occupied the\npapacy, and the kingdom of the Lombards was held by Astolphus, who,\ncontrary to agreement, seized Ravenna, and made war upon the pope.\nOn this account, Gregory no longer relying upon the emperor of\nConstantinople, since he, for the reasons above given, was unable to\nassist him, and unwilling to trust the Lombards, for they had frequently\nbroken their faith, had recourse to Pepin II., who, from being lord of\nAustria and Brabant, had become king of France; not so much by his\nown valor as by that of Charles Martel, his father, and Pepin his\ngrandfather; for Charles Martel, being governor of the kingdom, effected\nthe memorable defeat of the Saracens near Tours, upon the Loire, in\nwhich two hundred thousand of them are said to have been left dead upon\nthe field of battle. Hence, Pepin, by his father's reputation and his\nown abilities, became afterward king of France. To him Pope Gregory, as\nwe have said, applied for assistance against the Lombards, which Pepin\npromised to grant, but desired first to see him and be honored with his\npresence. Gregory accordingly went to France, passing uninjured through\nthe country of his enemies, so great was the respect they had for\nreligion, and was treated honorably by Pepin, who sent an army into\nItaly, and besieged the Lombards in Pavia. King Astolphus, compelled by\nnecessity, made proposals of peace to the French, who agreed to them at\nthe entreaty of the pope--for he did not desire the death of his enemy,\nbut that he should be converted and live. In this treaty, Astolphus\npromised to give to the church all the places he had taken from her;\nbut the king's forces having returned to France, he did not fulfill the\nagreement, and the pope again had recourse to Pepin, who sent another\narmy, conquered the Lombards, took Ravenna, and, contrary to the wishes\nof the Greek emperor, gave it to the pope, with all the places that\nbelonged to the exarchate, and added to them Urbino and the Marca.\nBut Astolphus, while fulfilling the terms of his agreement, died, and\nDesiderius, a Lombard, who was duke of Tuscany, took up arms to occupy\nthe kingdom, and demanded assistance of the pope, promising him\nhis friendship. The pope acceding to his request, the other princes\nassented. Desiderius kept faith at first, and proceeded to resign the\ndistricts to the pope, according to the agreement made with Pepin, so\nthat an exarch was no longer sent from Constantinople to Ravenna, but it\nwas governed according to the will of the pope. Pepin soon after died,\nand was succeeded by his son Charles, the same who, on account of the\nmagnitude and success of his enterprises, was called Charlemagne, or\nCharles the Great. Theodore I. now succeeded to the papacy, and discord\narising between him and Desiderius, the latter besieged him in Rome.\nThe pope requested assistance of Charles, who, having crossed the Alps,\nbesieged Desiderius in Pavai, where he took both him and his children,\nand sent them prisoners to France. He then went to visit the pontiff at\nRome, where he declared, THAT THE POPE, BEING VICAR OF GOD, COULD NOT\nBE JUDGED BY MEN. The pope and the people of Rome made him emperor; and\nthus Rome began to have an emperor of the west. And whereas the popes\nused to be established by the emperors, the latter now began to have\nneed of the popes at their elections; the empire continued to lose\nits powers, while the church acquired them; and, by these means, she\nconstantly extended her authority over temporal princes.\nThe Lombards, having now been two hundred and thirty-two years in the\ncountry, were strangers only in name, and Charles, wishing to reorganize\nthe states of Italy, consented that they should occupy the places in\nwhich they had been brought up, and call the province after their own\nname, Lombardy. That they might be led to respect the Roman name, he\nordered all that part of Italy adjoining to them, which had been under\nthe exarchate of Ravenna, to be called Romagna. Besides this, he created\nhis son Pepin, king of Italy, whose dominion extended to Benevento; all\nthe rest being possessed by the Greek emperor, with whom Charles was\nin league. About this time Pascal I. occupied the pontificate, and\nthe priests of the churches of Rome, from being near to the pope, and\nattending the elections of the pontiff, began to dignify their own power\nwith a title, by calling themselves cardinals, and arrogated so great\nauthority, that having excluded the people of Rome from the election\nof pontiff, the appointment of a new pope was scarcely ever made except\nfrom one of their own number: thus on the death of Pascal, the cardinal\nof St. Sabina was created pope by the title of Eugenius II. Italy having\ncome into the hands of the French, a change of form and order took\nplace, the popes acquiring greater temporal power, and the new\nauthorities adopting the titles of count and marquis, as that of duke\nhad been introduced by Longinus, exarch of Ravenna. After the deaths of\nsome pontiffs, Osporco, a Roman, succeeded to the papacy; but on account\nof his unseemly appellation, he took the name of Sergius, and this was\nthe origin of that change of names which the popes adopt upon their\nelection to the pontificate.\nIn the meantime, the Emperor Charles died and was succeeded by Lewis\n(the Pious), after whose death so many disputes arose among his sons,\nthat at the time of his grandchildren, the house of France lost the\nempire, which then came to the Germans; the first German emperor being\ncalled Arnolfus. Nor did the Carlovingian family lose the empire only;\ntheir discords also occasioned them the loss of Italy; for the Lombards,\ngathering strength, offended the pope and the Romans, and Arnolfo, not\nknowing where to seek relief, was compelled to create Berengarius, duke\nof Fruili, king of Italy. These events induced the Huns, who occupied\nPannonia, to assail Italy; but, in an engagement with Berengarius, they\nwere compelled to return to Pannonia, which had from them been named\nHungary.\nRomano was at this time emperor of Greece, having, while prefect of\nthe army, dethroned Constantine; and as Puglia and Calabria, which, as\nbefore observed, were parts of the Greek empire, had revolted, he\ngave permission to the Saracans to occupy them; and they having taken\npossession of these provinces, besieged Rome. The Romans, Berengarius\nbeing then engaged in defending himself against the Huns, appointed\nAlberic, duke of Tuscany, their leader. By his valor Rome was saved from\nthe Saracens, who, withdrawing from the siege, erected a fortress upon\nMount Gargano, by means of which they governed Puglia and Calabria,\nand harassed the whole country. Thus Italy was in those times very\ngrievously afflicted, being in constant warfare with the Huns in the\ndirection of the Alps, and, on the Neapolitan side, suffering from the\ninroads of the Saracens. This state of things continued many years,\noccupying the reigns of three Berengarii, who succeeded each other; and\nduring this time the pope and the church were greatly disturbed; the\nimpotence of the eastern, and the disunion which prevailed among the\nwestern princes, leaving them without defense. The city of Genoa, with\nall her territory upon the rivers, having been overrun by the Saracens,\nan impulse was thus given to the rising greatness of Pisa, in which city\nmultitudes took refuge who had been driven out of their own country.\nThese events occurred in the year 931, when Otho, duke of Saxony, the\nson of Henry and Matilda, a man of great prudence and reputation, being\nmade emperor, the pope Agapito, begged that he would come into Italy and\nrelieve him from the tyranny of the Berengarii.\nThe States of Italy were governed in this manner: Lombardy was under\nBerengarius III. and Alfred his son; Tuscany and Romagna were governed\nby a deputy of the western emperor; Puglia and Calabria were partly\nunder the Greek emperor, and partly under the Saracens; in Rome two\nconsuls were annually chosen from the nobility, who governed her\naccording to ancient custom; to these was added a prefect, who dispensed\njustice among the people; and there was a council of twelve, who each\nyear appointed rectors for the places subject to them. The popes had\nmore or less authority in Rome and the rest of Italy, in proportion as\nthey were favorites of the emperor or of the most powerful states. The\nEmperor Otho came into Italy, took the kingdom from the Berengarii, in\nwhich they had reigned fifty-five years, and reinstated the pontiff in\nhis dignity. He had a son and a nephew, each named Otho, who, one after\nthe other, succeeded to the empire. In the reign of Otho III., Pope\nGregory V. was expelled by the Romans; whereupon the emperor came into\nItaly and replaced him; and the pope, to revenge himself on the Romans,\ntook from them the right to create an emperor, and gave it to three\nprinces and three bishops of Germany; the princes of Brandenburg,\nPalatine, and Saxony, and the bishops of Magonza, Treveri, and Colonia.\nThis occurred in the year 1002. After the death of Otho III. the\nelectors created Henry, duke of Bavaria, emperor, who at the end of\ntwelve years was crowned by Pope Stephen VIII. Henry and his wife\nSimeonda were persons of very holy life, as is seen by the many temples\nbuilt and endowed by them, of which the church of St. Miniato, near\nFlorence, is one. Henry died in 1024, and was succeeded by Conrad of\nSuabia; and the latter by Henry II., who came to Rome; and as there was\na schism in the church of three popes, he set them all aside, and caused\nthe election of Clement II., by whom he was crowned emperor.\nCHAPTER IV\nNicholas II. commits the election of the pope to the cardinals--First\nexample of a prince deprived of his dominions by the pope--Guelphs and\nGhibellines--Establishment of the kingdom of Naples--Pope Urban II. goes\nto France--The first crusade--New orders of knighthood--Saladin takes\nfrom the Christians their possessions in the east--Death of the Countess\nMatilda--Character of Frederick Barbarossa--Schism--Frederick creates\nan anti-pope--Building of Alexandria in Puglia--Disgraceful conditions\nimposed by the pope upon Henry, king of England--Reconciliation\nof Frederick with the pope--The kingdom of Naples passes to the\nGermans--Orders of St. Dominic and St. Francis.\nItaly was at this time governed partly by the people, some districts\nby their own princes, and others by the deputies of the emperor. The\nhighest in authority, and to whom the others referred, was called the\nchancellor. Of the princes, the most powerful were Godfred and the\nCountess Matilda his wife, who was daughter of Beatrice, the sister of\nHenry II. She and her husband possessed Lucca, Parma, Reggio, Mantua,\nand the whole of what is now called THE PATRIMONY OF THE CHURCH. The\nambition of the Roman people caused many wars between them and the\npontiffs, whose authority had previously been used to free them from\nthe emperors; but when they had taken the government of the city to\nthemselves, and regulated it according to their own pleasure, they at\nonce became at enmity with the popes, who received far more injuries\nfrom them than from any Christian potentate. And while the popes caused\nall the west to tremble with their censures, the people of Rome were\nin open rebellion against them; nor had they or the popes any other\npurpose, but to deprive each other of reputation and authority.\nNicholas II. now attained the papacy; and as Gregory V. had taken\nfrom the Romans the right to create an emperor, he in the same manner\ndetermined to deprive them of their share in the election of the pope;\nand confined the creation to the cardinals alone. Nor did this satisfy\nhim; for, having agreed with the princes who governed Calabria and\nPuglia, with methods which we shall presently relate, he compelled the\nofficers whom the Romans appointed to their different jurisdictions,\nto render obedience to him; and some of them he even deprived of their\noffices. After the death of Nicholas, there was a schism in the church;\nthe clergy of Lombardy refused obedience to Alexander II., created at\nRome, and elected Cadolo of Parma anti-pope; and Henry, who hated\nthe power of the pontiffs, gave Alexander to understand that he must\nrenounce the pontificate, and ordered the cardinals to go into Germany\nto appoint a new pope. He was the first who felt the importance of\nspiritual weapons; for the pope called a council at Rome, and deprived\nHenry of both the empire and the kingdom. Some of the people of Italy\ntook the part of the pope, others of Henry; and hence arose the factions\nof the Guelphs and the Ghibellines; that Italy, relieved from the\ninundations of barbarians, might be distracted with intestine strife.\nHenry, being excommunicated, was compelled by his people to come into\nItaly, and fall barefooted upon his knees before the pope, and ask his\npardon. This occurred in the year 1082. Nevertheless, there shortly\nafterward arose new discords between the pope and Henry; upon which the\npope again excommunicated him, and the emperor sent his son, also named\nHenry, with an army to Rome, and he, with the assistance of the Romans,\nwho hated the pope, besieged him in the fortress. Robert Guiscard them\ncame from Puglia to his relief, but Henry had left before his arrival,\nand returned to Germany. The Romans stood out alone, and the city was\nsacked by Robert, and reduced to ruins. As from this Robert sprung the\nestablishment of the kingdom of Naples, it seems not superfluous to\nrelate particularly his actions and origin.\nDisunion having arisen among the descendants of Charlemagne, occasion\nwas given to another northern people, called Normans, to assail France\nand occupy that portion of the country which is now named Normandy. A\npart of these people came into Italy at the time when the province was\ninfested with the Berengarii, the Saracans, and the Huns, and occupied\nsome places in Romagna, where, during the wars of that period, they\nconducted themselves valiantly. Tancred, one of these Norman princes,\nhad many children; among the rest were William, surnamed Ferabac, and\nRobert, called Guiscard. When the principality was governed by William,\nthe troubles of Italy were in some measure abated; but the Saracens\nstill held Sicily, and plundered the coasts of Italy daily. On this\naccount William arranged with the princes of Capua and Salerno, and\nwith Melorco, a Greek, who governed Puglia and Calabria for the\nGreek emperor, to attack Sicily; and it was agreed that, if they\nwere victorious, each should have a fourth part of the booty and\nthe territory. They were fortunate in their enterprise, expelled the\nSaracens, and took possession of the island; but, after the victory,\nMelorco secretly caused forces to be brought from Greece, seized Sicily\nin the name of the emperor, and appropriated the booty to himself and\nhis followers. William was much dissatisfied with this, but reserved\nthe exhibition of his displeasure for a suitable opportunity, and left\nSicily with the princes of Salerno and Capua. But when they had parted\nfrom him to return to their homes, instead of proceeding to Romagna he\nled his people towards Puglia, and took Melfi; and from thence, in a\nshort time, recovered from the Greek emperor almost the whole of Puglia\nand Calabria, over which provinces, in the time of pope Nicholas II. his\nbrother Robert Guiscard was sovereign. Robert having had many disputes\nwith his nephews for the inheritance of these states, requested the\ninfluence of the pope to settle them; which his holiness was very\nwilling to afford, being anxious to make a friend of Robert, to defend\nhimself against the emperor of Germany and the insolence of the Roman\npeople, which indeed shortly followed, when, at the instance of Gregory,\nhe drove Henry from Rome, and subdued the people. Robert was succeeded\nby his sons Roger and William, to whose dominion not only was Naples\nadded, but all the places interjacent as far as Rome, and afterward\nSicily, of which Roger became sovereign; but, upon William going to\nConstantinople, to marry the daughter of the emperor, his dominions\nwere wrested from him by his brother Roger. Inflated with so great an\nacquisition, Roger first took the title of king of Italy, but afterward\ncontented himself with that of king of Puglia and Sicily. He was the\nfirst who established and gave that name to this kingdom, which still\nretains its ancient boundaries, although its sovereigns have been of\nmany families and countries. Upon the failure of the Normans, it came to\nthe Germans, after these to the French, then to the Aragonese, and it is\nnow held by the Flemish.\nAbout this time Urban II. became pope and excited the hatred of the\nRomans. As he did not think himself safe even in Italy, on account of\nthe disunion which prevailed, he directed his thoughts to a generous\nenterprise. With his whole clergy he went into France, and at Anvers,\nhaving drawn together a vast multitude of people, delivered an oration\nagainst the infidels, which so excited the minds of his audience, that\nthey determined to undertake the conquest of Asia from the Saracens;\nwhich enterprise, with all those of a similar nature, were afterward\ncalled crusades, because the people who joined in them bore upon their\narmor and apparel the figure of a cross. The leaders were Godfrey,\nEustace, and Baldwin of Bouillon, counts of Boulogne, and Peter, a\nhermit celebrated for his prudence and sagacity. Many kings and people\njoined them, and contributed money; and many private persons fought\nunder them at their own expense; so great was the influence of religion\nin those days upon the minds of men, excited by the example of those\nwho were its principal ministers. The proudest successes attended the\nbeginning of this enterprise; for the whole of Asia Minor, Syria, and\npart of Egypt, fell under the power of the Christians. To commemorate\nthese events the order of the Knights of Jerusalem was created, which\nstill continues, and holds the island of Rhodes--the only obstacle to\nthe power of the Mohammedans. The same events gave rise to the order\nof the Knights Templars, which, after a short time, on account of\ntheir shameless practices, was dissolved. Various fortunes attended\nthe crusaders in the course of their enterprises, and many nations\nand individuals became celebrated accordingly. The kings of France\nand England joined them, and, with the Venetians, Pisans, and Genoese,\nacquired great reputation, till the time of Saladin, when, by whose\ntalents, and the disagreement of the Christians among themselves,\nthe crusaders were robbed of all that glory which they had at first\nacquired; and, after ninety years, were driven from those places which\nthey had so honorably and happily recovered.\nAfter the death of Urban, Pascal II. became pope, and the empire was\nunder the dominion of Henry IV. who came to Rome pretending friendship\nfor the pontiff but afterward put his holiness and all his clergy in\nprison; nor did he release them till it was conceded that he should\ndispose of the churches of Germany according to his own pleasure. About\nthis time, the Countess Matilda died, and made the church heir to all\nher territories. After the deaths of Pascal and Henry IV. many popes and\nemperors followed, till the papacy was occupied by Alexander III. and\nthe empire by Frederick, surnamed Barbarossa. The popes during this\nperiod had met with many difficulties from the people of Rome and\nthe emperors; and in the time of Barbarossa they were much increased.\nFrederick possessed military talent, but was so full of pride that he\nwould not submit to the pontiff. However, at his election to the empire\nhe came to Rome to be crowned, and returned peaceably to Germany, where\nhe did not long remain in the same mind, but came again into Italy to\nsubdue certain places in Lombardy, which did not obey him. It happened\nat this time that the cardinal St. Clement, of a Roman family, separated\nfrom Alexander, and was made pope by some of the cardinals. The Emperor\nFrederick, being encamped at Cerma, Alexander complained to him of the\nanti-pope, and received for answer, that they were both to go to him,\nand, having heard each side, he would determine which was the true pope.\nThis reply displeased Alexander; and, as he saw the emperor was inclined\nto favor the anti-pope, he excommunicated him, and then fled to Philip,\nking of France. Frederick, in the meantime, carrying on the war in\nLombardy, destroyed Milan; which caused the union of Verona, Padua, and\nVicenza against him for their common defense. About the same period the\nanti-pope died, and Frederick set up Guido of Cremona, in his stead.\nThe Romans, from the absence of the pope, and from the emperor being\nin Lombardy, had reacquired some authority in Rome, and proceeded to\nrecover the obedience of those places which had been subject to them.\nAnd as the people of Tusculum refused to submit to their authority, they\nproceeded against them with their whole force; but these, being assisted\nby Frederick, routed the Roman army with such dreadful slaughter,\nthat Rome was never after either so populous or so rich. Alexander now\nreturned to the city, thinking he could be safe there on account of\nthe enmity subsisting between the Romans and the emperor, and from the\nenemies which the latter had in Lombardy. But Frederick, setting aside\nevery other consideration, led his forces and encamped before Rome; and\nAlexander fled to William, king of Puglia, who had become hair of that\nkingdom after the death of Roger. Frederick, however, withdrew from Rome\non account of the plague which then prevailed, and returned to Germany.\nThe cities of Lombardy in league against him, in order to command Pavia\nand Tortona, which adhered to the imperial party, built a city, to be\ntheir magazine in time of war, and named in Alexandria, in honor of the\npope and in contempt of Frederick.\nGuido the anti-pope died, and Giovanni of Fermo was appointed in his\nstead, who, being favored by the imperialists, lived at Montefiascone.\nPope Alexander being at Tusculum, whither he had been called by the\ninhabitants, that with his authority he might defend them from the\nRomans, ambassadors came to him from Henry, king of England, to signify\nthat he was not blamable for the death of Thomas \u00e0 Becket, archbishop\nof Canterbury, although public report had slandered him with it. On this\nthe pope sent two cardinals to England, to inquire into the truth of\nthe matter; and although they found no actual charge against the king,\nstill, on account of the infamy of the crime, and for not having honored\nthe archbishop so much as he deserved, the sentence against the king of\nEngland was, that having called together the barons of his empire,\nhe should upon oath before them affirm his innocence; that he should\nimmediately send two hundred soldiers to Jerusalem, paid for one year;\nthat, before the end of three years, he should himself proceed thither\nwith as large an army as he could draw together; that his subjects\nshould have the power of appealing to Rome when they thought proper;\nand that he should annul whatever acts had been passed in his kingdom\nunfavorable to ecclesiastical rule. These terms were all accepted by\nHenry; and thus a great king submitted to a sentence that in our day a\nprivate person would have been ashamed of. But while the pope exercised\nso great authority over distant princes, he could not compel obedience\nfrom the Romans themselves, or obtain their consent that he should\nremain in Rome, even though he promised to intermeddle only with\necclesiastical affairs.\nAbout this time Frederick returned to Italy, and while he was preparing\nto carry on new wars against the pope, his prelates and barons declared\nthat they would abandon him unless he reconciled himself with the\nchurch; so that he was obliged to go and submit to the pope at Venus,\nwhere a pacification was effected, but in which the pope deprived the\nemperor of all authority over Rome, and named William, king of Sicily\nand Puglia, a coadjutor with him. Frederick, unable to exist without\nwar, joined the crusaders in Asia, that he might exercise that ambition\nagainst Mohammed, which he could not gratify against the vicars of\nChrist. And being near the river Cydnus, tempted by the clearness of\nits waters, bathed therein, took cold, and died. Thus the river did a\ngreater favor to the Mohammedans than the pope's excommunications had\ndone to the Christians; for the latter only checked his pride, while the\nformer finished his career. Frederick being dead, the pope had now\nonly to suppress the contumacy of the Romans; and, after many disputes\nconcerning the creation of consuls, it was agreed that they should\nelect them as they had been accustomed to do, but that these should not\nundertake the office, till they had first sworn to be faithful to the\nchurch. This agreement being made, Giovanni the anti-pope took refuge in\nMount Albano, where he shortly afterward died. William, king of Naples,\ndied about the same time, and the pope intended to occupy that kingdom\non the ground that the king had left only a natural son named Tancred.\nBut the barons would not consent, and wished that Tancred should be\nking. Celestine III., the then pope, anxious to snatch the kingdom from\nthe hands of Tancred, contrived that Henry, son of Frederick should be\nelected emperor, and promised him the kingdom on the condition that he\nshould restore to the church all the places that had belonged to her. To\nfacilitate this affair, he caused Gostanza, a daughter of William, who\nhad been placed in a monastery and was now old, to be brought from\nher seclusion and become the wife of Henry. Thus the kingdom of Naples\npassed from the Normans, who had been the founders of it, to the\nGermans. As soon as the affairs of Germany were arranged, the Emperor\nHenry came into Italy with Gostanza his wife, and a son about four years\nof age named Frederick; and, as Tancred was now dead, leaving only\nan infant named Roger, he took possession of the kingdom without much\ndifficulty. After some years, Henry died in Sicily, and was succeeded in\nthe kingdom by Frederick, and in the empire by Otho, duke of Saxony, who\nwas elected through the influence of Innocent III. But as soon as he had\ntaken the crown, contrary to the general expectation, he became an enemy\nof the pope, occupied Romagna, and prepared to attack the kingdom. On\nthis account the pope excommunicated him; he was abandoned by every one,\nand the electors appointed Frederick, king of Naples, emperor in his\nstead. Frederick came to Rome for his coronation; but the pope, being\nafraid of his power, would not crown him, and endeavored to withdraw him\nfrom Italy as he had done Otho. Frederick returned to Germany in anger,\nand, after many battles with Otho, at length conquered him. Meanwhile,\nInnocent died, who, besides other excellent works, built the hospital of\nthe Holy Ghost at Rome. He was succeeded by Honorius III., in whose time\nthe religious orders of St. Dominic and St. Francis were founded, 1218.\nHonorius crowned Frederick, to whom Giovanni, descended from Baldwin,\nking of Jerusalem, who commanded the remainder of the Christian army in\nAsia and still held that title, gave a daughter in marriage; and, with\nher portion, conceded to him the title to that kingdom: hence it is that\nevery king of Naples is called king of Jerusalem.\nCHAPTER V\nThe state of Italy--Beginning of the greatness of the house of\nEste--Guelphs and Ghibellines--Death of the Emperor Frederick\nII.--Manfred takes possession of the kingdom of Naples--Movements of the\nGuelphs and Ghibellines in Lombardy--Charles of Anjou invested by the\npope with the kingdom of Naples and Sicily--Restless policy of\nthe popes--Ambitious views of pope Nicholas III.--Nephews of the\npopes--Sicilian vespers--The Emperor Rodolph allows many cities to\npurchase their independence--Institution of the jubilee--The popes at\nAvignon.\nAt this time the states of Italy were governed in the following manner:\nthe Romans no longer elected consuls, but instead of them, and with the\nsame powers, they appointed one senator, and sometimes more. The league\nwhich the cities of Lombardy had formed against Frederick Barbarossa\nstill continued, and comprehended Milan, Brescia, Mantua, and the\ngreater number of the cities of Romagna, together with Verona, Vicenza,\nPadua, and Trevisa. Those which took part with the emperor, were\nCremona, Bergamo, Parma, Reggio, and Trento. The other cities and\nfortresses of Lombardy, Romagna, and the march of Trevisa, favored,\naccording to their necessities, sometimes one party, sometimes the\nother.\nIn the time of Otho III. there had come into Italy a man called Ezelin,\nwho, remaining in the country, had a son, and he too had a son named\nEzelin. This person, being rich and powerful, took part with Frederick,\nwho, as we have said, was at enmity with the pope; Frederick, at the\ninstigation and with the assistance of Ezelin, took Verona and Mantua,\ndestroyed Vicenza, occupied Padua, routed the army of the united cities,\nand then directed his course towards Tuscany. Ezelin, in the meantime,\nhad subdued the whole of the Trevisian March, but could not prevail\nagainst Ferrara, which was defended by Azone da Este and the forces\nwhich the pope had in Lombardy; and, as the enemy were compelled to\nwithdraw, the pope gave Ferrara in fee to this Azone, from whom are\ndescended those who now govern that city. Frederick halted at Pisa,\ndesirous of making himself lord of Tuscany; but, while endeavoring to\ndiscover what friends and foes he had in that province, he scattered so\nmany seeds of discord as occasioned the ruin of Italy; for the factions\nof the Guelphs and Ghibellines multiplied,--those who supported the\nchurch taking the name of Guelphs, while the followers of the emperor\nwere called Ghibellines, these names being first heard at Pistoia.\nFrederick, marching from Pisa, assailed and wasted the territories\nof the church in a variety of ways; so that the pope, having no other\nremedy, unfurled against him the banner of the cross, as his predecessor\nhad done against the Saracens. Frederick, that he might be suddenly\nabandoned by his people, as Frederick Barbarossa and others had been,\ntook into his pay a number of Saracens; and to bind them to him, and\nestablish in Italy a firm bulwark against the church, without fear of\npapal maledictions, he gave them Nocera in the kingdom of Naples, that,\nhaving a refuge of their own, they might be placed in greater security.\nThe pontificate was now occupied by Innocent IV., who, being in fear\nof Frederick, went to Genoa, and thence to France, where he appointed a\ncouncil to be held at Lyons, where it was the intention of Frederick\nto attend, but he was prevented by the rebellion of Parma: and, being\nrepulsed, he went into Tuscany, and from thence to Sicily, where he\ndied, leaving his son Conrad in Suabia; and in Puglia, Manfred, whom he\nhad created duke of Benevento, born of a concubine. Conrad came to take\npossession of the kingdom, and having arrived at Naples, died, leaving\nan infant son named Corradino, who was then in Germany. On this\naccount Manfred occupied the state, first as guardian of Corradino, but\nafterward, causing a report to be circulated that Corradino had died,\nmade himself king, contrary to the wishes of both the pope and the\nNeapolitans, who, however, were obliged to submit.\nWhile these things were occurring in the kingdom of Naples, many\nmovements took place in Lombardy between the Guelphs and the\nGhibellines. The Guelphs were headed by a legate of the pope; and the\nGhibelline party by Ezelin, who possessed nearly the whole of Lombardy\nbeyond the Po; and, as in the course of the war Padua rebelled, he\nput to death twelve thousand of its citizens. But before its close he\nhimself was slain, in the eightieth year of his age, and all the places\nhe had held became free. Manfred, king of Naples, continued those\nenmities against the church which had been begun by his ancestors,\nand kept the pope, Urban IV., in continual alarm; so that, in order to\nsubdue him, Urban summoned the crusaders, and went to Perugia to await\ntheir arrival. Seeing them few and slow in their approach, he found\nthat more able assistance was necessary to conquer Manfred. He therefore\nsought the favor of France; created Louis of Anjou, the king's brother,\nsovereign of Naples and Sicily, and excited him to come into Italy to\ntake possession of that kingdom. But before Charles came to Rome the\npope died, and was succeeded by Clement IV., in whose time he arrived\nat Ostia, with thirty galleys, and ordered that the rest of his forces\nshould come by land. During his abode at Rome, the citizens, in order\nto attach him to them, made him their senator, and the pope invested him\nwith the kingdom, on condition that he should pay annually to the\nchurch the sum of fifty thousand ducats; and it was decreed that, from\nthenceforth, neither Charles nor any other person, who might be king of\nNaples, should be emperor also. Charles marched against Manfred, routed\nhis army, and slew him near Benevento, and then became sovereign of\nSicily and Naples. Corradino, to whom, by his father's will, the state\nbelonged, having collected a great force in Germany, marched into Italy\nagainst Charles, with whom he came to an engagement at Tagliacozzo, was\ntaken prisoner while endeavoring to escape, and being unknown, put to\ndeath.\nItaly remained in repose until the pontificate of Adrian V. Charles,\nbeing at Rome and governing the city by virtue of his office of senator,\nthe pope, unable to endure his power, withdrew to Viterbo, and solicited\nthe Emperor Rodolph to come into Italy and assist him. Thus the popes,\nsometimes in zeal for religion, at others moved by their own ambition,\nwere continually calling in new parties and exciting new disturbances.\nAs soon as they had made a prince powerful, they viewed him with\njealousy and sought his ruin; and never allowed another to rule the\ncountry, which, from their own imbecility, they were themselves unable\nto govern. Princes were in fear of them; for, fighting or running away,\nthe popes always obtained the advantage, unless it happened they were\nentrapped by deceit, as occurred to Boniface VIII., and some others, who\nunder pretense of friendship, were ensnared by the emperors. Rodolph did\nnot come into Italy, being detained by the war in which he was engaged\nwith the king of Bohemia. At this time Adrian died, and Nicholas III.,\nof the Orsini family, became pontiff. He was a bold, ambitious man; and\nbeing resolved at any event to diminish the power of Charles, induced\nthe Emperor Rodolph to complain that he had a governor in Tuscany\nfavorable to the Guelphic faction, who after the death of Manfred had\nbeen replaced by him. Charles yielded to the emperor and withdrew his\ngovernor, and the pope sent one of his nephews, a cardinal, as governor\nfor the emperor, who, for the honor done him, restored Romagna to the\nchurch, which had been taken from her by his predecessors, and the pope\nmade Bertoldo Orsino duke of Romagna. As Nicholas now thought himself\npowerful enough to oppose Charles, he deprived him of the office of\nsenator, and made a decree that no one of royal race should ever be a\nsenator in Rome. It was his intention to deprive Charles of Sicily, and\nto this end he entered into a secret negotiation with Peter, king of\nAragon, which took effect in the following papacy. He also had the\ndesign of creating two kings out of his family, the one in Lombardy, the\nother in Tuscany, whose power would defend the church from the Germans\nwho might design to come into Italy, and from the French, who were in\nthe kingdom of Naples and Sicily. But with these thoughts he died. He\nwas the first pope who openly exhibited his own ambition; and, under\npretense of making the church great, conferred honors and emolument upon\nhis own family. Previous to his time no mention is made of the nephews\nor families of any pontiff, but future history is full of them; nor is\nthere now anything left for them to attempt, except the effort to make\nthe papacy hereditary. True it is, the princes of their creating have\nnot long sustained their honors; for the pontiffs, being generally of\nvery limited existence, did not get their plants properly established.\nTo Nicholas succeeded Martin IV., of French origin, and consequently\nfavorable to the party of Charles, who sent him assistance against\nthe rebellion of Romagna; and while they were encamped at Furli, Guido\nBonatto, an astrologer, contrived that at an appointed moment the people\nshould assail the forces of the king, and the plan succeeding, all the\nFrench were taken and slain. About this period was also carried into\neffect the plot of Pope Nicholas and Peter, king of Aragon, by which the\nSicilians murdered all the French that were in that island; and Peter\nmade himself sovereign of it, saying, that it belonged to him in the\nright of his wife Gostanza, daughter of Manfred. But Charles, while\nmaking warlike preparations for the recovery of Sicily, died, leaving\na son, Charles II., who was made prisoner in Sicily, and to recover his\nliberty promised to return to his prison, if within three years he\ndid not obtain the pope's consent that the kings of Aragon should be\ninvested with the kingdom of Sicily.\nThe Emperor Rodolph, instead of coming into Italy, gave the empire the\nadvantage of having done so, by sending an ambassador, with authority\nto make all those cities free which would redeem themselves with money.\nMany purchased their freedom, and with liberty changed their mode of\nliving. Adolpho of Saxony succeeded to the empire; and to the papacy,\nPietro del Murrone, who took the name of Celestino; but, being a hermit\nand full of sanctity, after six months renounced the pontificate, and\nBoniface VIII. was elected.\nAfter a time the French and Germans left Italy, and the country remained\nwholly in the hands of the Italians; but Providence ordained that the\npope, when these enemies were withdrawn, should neither establish nor\nenjoy his authority, and raised two very powerful families in Rome,\nthe Colonnesi and the Orsini, who with their arms, and the proximity\nof their abode, kept the pontificate weak. Boniface then determined\nto destroy the Colonnesi, and, besides excommunicating, endeavored to\ndirect the weapons of the church against them. This, although it did\nthem some injury, proved more disastrous to the pope; for those arms\nwhich from attachment to the faith performed valiantly against its\nenemies, as soon as they were directed against Christians for private\nambition, ceased to do the will of those who wished to wield them. And\nthus the too eager desire to gratify themselves, caused the pontiffs by\ndegrees to lose their military power. Besides what is just related, the\npope deprived two cardinals of the Colonnesi family of their office; and\nSciarra, the head of the house, escaping unknown, was taken by corsairs\nof Catalonia and put to the oar; but being afterward recognized\nat Marseilles, he was sent to Philip, king of France, who had been\nexcommunicated and deprived of the kingdom. Philip, considering that\nin a war against the pontiff he would either be a loser or run great\nhazards, had recourse to deception, and simulating a wish to come to\nterms, secretly sent Sciarra into Italy, who, having arrived at Anagnia,\nwhere his holiness then resided, assembled a few friends, and in the\nnight took him prisoner. And although the people of Anagnia set him\nat liberty shortly after, yet from grief at the injury he died mad.\nBoniface was founder of the jubilee in 1300, and fixed that it should\nbe celebrated at each revolution of one hundred years. In those times\nvarious troubles arose between the Guelph and Ghibelline factions; and\nthe emperors having abandoned Italy, many places became free, and many\nwere occupied by tyrants. Pope Benedict restored the scarlet hat to the\ncardinals of the Colonnesi family, and reblessed Philip, king of France.\nHe was succeeded by Clement V., who, being a Frenchman, removed the\npapal court to Avignon in 1305.\nCHAPTER VI\nThe Emperor Henry comes into Italy--The Florentines take the part of\nthe pope--The Visconti originate the duchy of Milan--Artifice of Maffeo\nVisconti against the family of de la Torre--Giovanni Galeazzo Visconti,\nfirst duke of Milan--The Emperor Louis in Italy--John, king of\nBohemia, in Italy--League against the king of Bohemia and the pope's\nlegate--Origin of Venice--Liberty of the Venetians confirmed by Pepin\nand the Greek emperor--Greatness of Venice--Decline of Venice--Discord\nbetween the pope and the emperor--Giovanna, queen of Naples--Rienzi--The\njubilee reduced to fifty years--Succession of the duke of\nMilan--Cardinal Egidio the pope's legate--War between the Genoese and\nthe Venetians.\nAt this time, Charles II. of Naples died, and was succeeded by his son\nRobert. Henry of Luxemburg had been elected to the empire, and came to\nRome for his coronation, although the pope was not there. His coming\noccasioned great excitement in Lombardy; for he sent all the banished\nto their homes, whether they were Guelphs or Ghibellines; and in\nconsequence of this, one faction endeavoring to drive out the other, the\nwhole province was filled with war; nor could the emperor with all his\nendeavors abate its fury. Leaving Lombardy by way of Genoa, he came\nto Pisa, where he endeavored to take Tuscany from King Robert; but not\nbeing successful, he went to Rome, where he remained only a few days,\nbeing driven away by the Orsini with the consent of King Robert, and\nreturned to Pisa; and that he might more securely make war upon Tuscany,\nand wrest the country from the hands of the king, he caused it to be\nassailed by Frederick, monarch of Sicily. But when he was in hope of\noccupying Tuscany and robbing the king of Naples of his dominions, he\ndied, and was succeeded by Louis of Bavaria. About the same period, John\nXXII. attained the papacy, during whose time the emperor still continued\nto persecute the Guelphs and the church, but they were defended by\nRobert and the Florentines. Many wars took place in Lombardy between the\nVisconti and the Guelphs, and in Tuscany between Castruccio of Lucca\nand the Florentines. As the family of Visconti gave rise to the duchy of\nMilan, one of the five principalities which afterward governed Italy, I\nshall speak of them from a rather earlier date.\nMilan, upon recovering from the ruin into which she had been thrown by\nFrederick Barbarossa, in revenge for her injuries, joined the league\nformed by the Lombard cities for their common defense; this restrained\nhim, and for awhile preserved alive the interests of the church in\nLombardy. In the course of the wars which followed, the family of La\nTorre became very potent in that city, and their reputation increased\nso long as the emperor possessed little authority in the province.\nBut Frederick II. coming into Italy, and the Ghibelline party, by the\ninfluence of Ezelin having grown powerful, seeds of the same faction\nsprang up in all the cities. In Milan were the Visconti, who expelled\nthe La Torres; these, however, did not remain out, for by agreement\nbetween the emperor and the pope they were restored to their country.\nFor when the pope and his court removed to France, and the emperor,\nHenry of Luxemburg, came into Italy, with the pretext of going to Rome\nfor his crown, he was received in Milan by Maffeo Visconti and Guido\ndella Torre, who were then the heads of these families. But Maffeo,\ndesigning to make use of the emperor for the purpose of expelling Guido,\nand thinking the enterprise not difficult, on account of the La Torre\nbeing of the contrary faction to the imperial, took occasion, from the\nremarks which the people made of the uncivil behavior of the Germans,\nto go craftily about and excite the populace to arm themselves and throw\noff the yoke of these barbarians. When a suitable moment arrived, he\ncaused a person in whom he confided to create a tumult, upon which the\npeople took arms against the Germans. But no sooner was the mischief\nwell on foot, than Maffeo, with his sons and their partisans, ran to\nHenry, telling him that all the disturbance had been occasioned by the\nLa Torre family, who, not content to remain peaceably in Milan, had\ntaken the opportunity to plunder him, that they might ingratiate\nthemselves with the Guelphs of Italy and become princes in the city;\nthey then bade him be of good cheer, for they, with their party,\nwhenever he wished it, were ready to defend him with their lives. Henry,\nbelieving all that Maffeo told him, joined his forces to those of the\nVisconti, and attacking the La Torre, who were in various parts of the\ncity endeavoring to quell the tumult, slew all upon whom they could lay\nhands, and having plundered the others of their property, sent them into\nexile. By this artifice, Maffeo Visconti became a prince of Milan. Of\nhim remained Galeazzo and Azzo; and, after these, Luchino and Giovanni.\nGiovanni became archbishop of Milan; and of Luchino, who died before\nhim, were left Bernabo and Galeazzo; Galeazzo, dying soon after, left\na son called the Count of Virtu, who after the death of the archbishop,\ncontrived the murder of his uncle, Bernabo, became prince of Milan,\nand was the first who had the title of duke. The duke left Filippo and\nGiovanmaria Angelo, the latter of whom being slain by the people of\nMilan, the state fell to Filippo; but he having no male heir, Milan\npassed from the family of Visconti to that of Sforza, in the manner to\nbe related hereafter.\nBut to return to the point from which we deviated. The Emperor Louis, to\nadd to the importance of his party and to receive the crown, came\ninto Italy; and being at Milan, as an excuse for taking money of the\nMilanese, he pretended to make them free and to put the Visconti in\nprison; but shortly afterwards he released them, and, having gone to\nRome, in order to disturb Italy with less difficulty, he made Piero\ndella Corvara anti-pope, by whose influence, and the power of the\nVisconti, he designed to weaken the opposite faction in Tuscany and\nLombardy. But Castruccio died, and his death caused the failure of the\nemperor's purpose; for Pisa and Lucca rebelled. The Pisans sent Piero\ndella Corvara a prisoner to the pope in France, and the emperor,\ndespairing of the affairs of Italy, returned to Germany. He had scarcely\nleft, before John king of Bohemia came into the country, at the request\nof the Ghibellines of Brescia, and made himself lord of that city and of\nBergamo. And as his entry was with the consent of the pope, although\nhe feigned the contrary, the legate of Bologna favored him, thinking by\nthis means to prevent the return of the emperor. This caused a change in\nthe parties of Italy; for the Florentines and King Robert, finding the\nlegate was favorable to the enterprises of the Ghibellines, became foes\nof all those to whom the legate and the king of Bohemia were friendly.\nWithout having regard for either faction, whether Guelph or Ghibelline,\nmany princes joined them, of whom, among others, were the Visconti, the\nDella Scala, Filippo Gonzao of Mantua, the Carrara, and those of Este.\nUpon this the pope excommunicated them all. The king, in fear of the\nleague, went to collect forces in his own country, and having returned\nwith a large army, still found his undertaking a difficult one; so,\nseeing his error, he withdrew to Bohemia, to the great displeasure of\nthe legate, leaving only Reggio and Modena guarded, and Parma in the\ncare of Marsilio and Piero de' Rossi, who were the most powerful men in\nthe city. The king of Bohemia being gone, Bologna joined the league; and\nthe leaguers divided among themselves the four cities which remained of\nthe church faction. They agreed that Parma should pertain to the Della\nScalla; Reggio to the Gonzaga; Modena to the family of Este, and Lucca\nto the Florentines. But in taking possession of these cities, many\ndisputes arose which were afterward in a great measure settled by the\nVenetians. Some, perhaps, will think it a species of impropriety that\nwe have so long deferred speaking of the Venetians, theirs being a\nrepublic, which, both on account of its power and internal regulations,\ndeserves to be celebrated above any principality of Italy. But that this\nsurprise may cease when the cause is known, I shall speak of their city\nfrom a more remote period; that everyone may understand what were their\nbeginnings, and the causes which so long withheld them from interfering\nin the affairs of Italy.\nWhen Attila, king of the Huns, besieged Aquileia, the inhabitants, after\ndefending themselves a long time, began to despair of effecting their\nsafety, and fled for refuge to several uninhabited rocks, situated at\nthe point of the Adriatic Sea, now called the Gulf of Venice, carrying\nwith them whatever movable property they possessed. The people of Padua,\nfinding themselves in equal danger, and knowing that, having became\nmaster of Aquileia, Attila would next attack themselves, also removed\nwith their most valuable property to a place on the same sea, called\nRivo Alto, to which they brought their women, children, and aged\npersons, leaving the youth in Padua to assist in her defense. Besides\nthese, the people of Monselice, with the inhabitants of the surrounding\nhills, driven by similar fears, fled to the same rocks. But after Attila\nhad taken Aquileia, and destroyed Padua, Monselice, Vicenza, and Verona,\nthe people of Padua and others who were powerful, continued to inhabit\nthe marshes about Rivo Alto; and, in like manner, all the people of the\nprovince anciently called Venetia, driven by the same events, became\ncollected in these marshes. Thus, under the pressure of necessity,\nthey left an agreeable and fertile country to occupy one sterile and\nunwholesome. However, in consequence of a great number of people being\ndrawn together into a comparatively small space, in a short time\nthey made those places not only habitable, but delightful; and having\nestablished among themselves laws and useful regulations, enjoyed\nthemselves in security amid the devastations of Italy, and soon\nincreased both in reputation and strength. For, besides the inhabitants\nalready mentioned, many fled to these places from the cities of\nLombardy, principally to escape from the cruelties of Clefis king of the\nLombards, which greatly tended to increase the numbers of the new city;\nand in the conventions which were made between Pepin, king of France,\nand the emperor of Greece, when the former, at the entreaty of the pope,\ncame to drive the Lombards out of Italy, the duke of Benevento and the\nVenetians did not render obedience to either the one or the other,\nbut alone enjoyed their liberty. As necessity had led them to dwell\non sterile rocks, they were compelled to seek the means of subsistence\nelsewhere; and voyaging with their ships to every port of the ocean,\ntheir city became a depository for the various products of the world,\nand was itself filled with men of every nation.\nFor many years the Venetians sought no other dominion than that which\ntended to facilitate their commercial enterprises, and thus acquired\nmany ports in Greece and Syria; and as the French had made frequent use\nof their ships in voyages to Asia, the island of Candia was assigned to\nthem in recompense for these services. While they lived in this manner,\ntheir name spread terror over the seas, and was held in veneration\nthroughout Italy. This was so completely the case, that they were\ngenerally chosen to arbitrate in controversies between the states, as\noccurred in the difference between the Colleagues, on account of the\ncities they had divided among themselves; which being referred to the\nVenetians, they awarded Brescia and Bergamo to the Visconti. But when,\nin the course of time, urged by their eagerness for dominion, they had\nmade themselves masters of Padua, Vicenza, Trevisa, and afterward\nof Verona, Bergamo, and Brescia, with many cities in Romagna and the\nkingdom of Naples, other nations were impressed with such an opinion of\ntheir power, that they were a terror, not only to the princes of Italy,\nbut to the ultramontane kings. These states entered into an alliance\nagainst them, and in one day wrested from them the provinces they had\nobtained with so much labor and expense; and although they have in\nlatter times reacquired some portions, still possessing neither power\nnor reputation, like all the other Italian powers, they live at the\nmercy of others.\nBenedict XII. having attained the pontificate and finding Italy lost,\nfearing, too, that the emperor would assume the sovereignty of\nthe country, determined to make friends of all who had usurped the\ngovernment of those cities which had been accustomed to obey the\nemperor; that they might have occasion to dread the latter, and unite\nwith himself in the defense of Italy. To this end he issued a decree,\nconfirming to all the tyrants of Lombardy the places they had seized.\nAfter making this concession the pope died, and was succeeded by\nClement VI. The emperor, seeing with what a liberal hand the pontiff had\nbestowed the dominions of the empire, in order to be equally bountiful\nwith the property of others, gave to all who had assumed sovereignty\nover the cities or territories of the church, the imperial authority\nto retain possession of them. By this means Galeotto Malatesti and\nhis brothers became lords of Rimino, Pesaro, and Fano; Antonio da\nMontefeltro, of the Marca and Urbino; Gentile da Varano, of Camerino;\nGuido di Polenta, of Ravenna; Sinibaldo Ordelaffi, of Furli and Cesena;\nGiovanni Manfredi, of Faenza; Lodovico Alidossi, of Imola; and besides\nthese, many others in divers places. Thus, of all the cities, towns, or\nfortresses of the church, few remained without a prince; for she did not\nrecover herself till the time of Alexander VI., who, by the ruin of the\ndescendants of these princes, restored the authority of the church.\nThe emperor, when he made the concession before named, being at Tarento,\nsignified an intention of going into Italy. In consequence of this, many\nbattles were fought in Lombardy, and the Visconti became lords of Parma.\nRobert king of Naples, now died, leaving only two grandchildren, the\nissue of his sons Charles, who had died a considerable time before him.\nHe ordered that the elder of the two, whose name was Giovanna or Joan,\nshould be heiress of the kingdom, and take for her husband Andrea, son\nof the king of Hungary, his grandson. Andrea had not lived with her\nlong, before she caused him to be murdered, and married another cousin,\nLouis, prince of Tarento. But Louis, king of Hungary, and brother of\nAndrea, in order to avenge his death, brought forces into Italy, and\ndrove Queen Joan and her husband out of the kingdom.\nAt this period a memorable circumstance took place at Rome. Niccolo di\nLorenzo, often called Rienzi or Cola di Rienzi, who held the office of\nchancellor at Campidoglio, drove the senators from Rome and, under the\ntitle of tribune, made himself the head of the Roman republic; restoring\nit to its ancient form, and with so great reputation of justice and\nvirtue, that not only the places adjacent, but the whole of Italy sent\nambassadors to him. The ancient provinces, seeing Rome arise to new\nlife, again raised their heads, and some induced by hope, others by\nfear, honored him as their sovereign. But Niccolo, notwithstanding\nhis great reputation, lost all energy in the very beginning of\nhis enterprise; and as if oppressed with the weight of so vast an\nundertaking, without being driven away, secretly fled to Charles, king\nof Bohemia, who, by the influence of the pope, and in contempt of Louis\nof Bavaria, had been elected emperor. Charles, to ingratiate himself\nwith the pontiff, sent Niccolo to him, a prisoner. After some time, in\nimitation of Rienzi, Francesco Baroncegli seized upon the tribunate of\nRome, and expelled the senators; and the pope, as the most effectual\nmeans of repressing him, drew Niccolo from his prison, sent him to Rome,\nand restored to him the office of tribune; so that he reoccupied\nthe state and put Francesco to death; but the Colonnesi becoming his\nenemies, he too, after a short time, shared the same fate, and the\nsenators were again restored to their office. The king of Hungary,\nhaving driven out Queen Joan, returned to his kingdom; but the pope,\nwho chose to have the queen in the neighborhood of Rome rather than the\nking, effected her restoration to the sovereignty, on the condition that\nher husband, contenting himself with the title of prince of Tarento,\nshould not be called king. Being the year 1350, the pope thought that\nthe jubilee, appointed by Boniface VIII. to take place at the conclusion\nof each century, might be renewed at the end of each fifty years; and\nhaving issued a decree for the establishment of it, the Romans, in\nacknowledgment of the benefit, consented that he should send four\ncardinals to reform the government of the city, and appoint senators\naccording to his own pleasure. The pope again declared Louis of Tarento,\nking, and in gratitude for the benefit, Queen Joan gave Avignon, her\ninheritance, to the church. About this time Luchino Visconti died, and\nhis brother the archbishop, remaining lord of Milan, carried on many\nwars against Tuscany and his neighbors, and became very powerful.\nBernabo and Galeazzo, his nephews, succeeded him; but Galeazzo soon\nafter died, leaving Giovan Galeazzo, who shared the state with Bernabo.\nCharles, king of Bohemia, was then emperor, and the pontificate was\noccupied by Innocent VI., who sent Cardinal Egidio, a Spaniard, into\nItaly. He restored the reputation of the church, not only in Rome and\nRomagna, but throughout the whole of Italy; he recovered Bologna from\nthe archbishop of Milan, and compelled the Romans to accept a foreign\nsenator appointed annually by the pope. He made honorable terms with the\nVisconti, and routed and took prisoner, John Agut, an Englishman, who\nwith four thousand English had fought on the side of the Ghibellines in\nTuscany. Urban V., hearing of so many victories, resolved to visit Italy\nand Rome, whither also the emperor came; after remaining a few months,\nhe returned to the kingdom of Bohemia, and the pope to Avignon. On\nthe death of Urban, Gregory XI. was created pope; and, as the Cardinal\nEgidio was dead, Italy again recommenced her ancient discords,\noccasioned by the union of the other powers against the Visconti; and\nthe pope, having first sent a legate with six thousand Bretons, came in\nperson and established the papal court at Rome in 1376, after an absence\nof seventy-one years in France. To Gregory XI., succeeded Urban VI., but\nshortly afterwards Clement VI. was elected at Fondi by ten cardinals,\nwho declared the appointment of Urban irregular. At this time, the\nGenoese threw off the yoke of the Visconti under whom they had lived\nmany years; and between them and the Venetians several important battles\nwere fought for the island of Tenedos. Although the Genoese were for a\ntime successful, and held Venice in a state of siege during many months,\nthe Venetians were at length victorious; and by the intervention of\nthe pope, peace was made in the year 1381. In these wars, artillery was\nfirst used, having been recently invented by the Dutch.\nCHAPTER VII\nSchism in the church--Ambitious views of Giovanni Galeazzo Visconti--The\npope and the Romans come to an agreement--Boniface IX. introduces the\npractice of Annates--Disturbance in Lombardy--The Venetians acquire\ndominion on terra firma--Differences between the pope and the people of\nRome--Council of Pisa--Council of Constance--Filippo Visconti recovers\nhis dominion--Giovanna II. of Naples--Political condition of Italy.\nA schism having thus arisen in the church, Queen Joan favored the\nschismatic pope, upon which Urban caused Charles of Durazzo, descended\nfrom the kings of Naples, to undertake the conquest of her dominions.\nHaving succeeded in his object, she fled to France, and he assumed the\nsovereignty. The king of France, being exasperated, sent Louis of Anjou\ninto Italy to recover the kingdom for the queen, to expel Urban from\nRome, and establish the anti-pope. But in the midst of this enterprise\nLouis died, and his people being routed returned to France. In this\nconjuncture the pope went to Naples, where he put nine cardinals into\nprison for having taken the part of France and the anti-pope. He then\nbecame offended with the king, for having refused to make his nephew\nprince of Capua; and pretending not to care about it, requested he\nwould grant him Nocera for his habitation, but, having fortified it,\nhe prepared to deprive the king of his dominions. Upon this the king\npitched his camp before the place, and the pope fled to Naples, where\nhe put to death the cardinals whom he had imprisoned. From thence\nhe proceeded to Rome, and, to acquire influence, created twenty-nine\ncardinals. At this time Charles, king of Naples, went to Hungary,\nwhere, having been made king, he was shortly afterward killed in battle,\nleaving a wife and two children at Naples. About the same time Giovanni\nGaleazzo Visconti murdered Bernabo his uncle and took the entire\nsovereignty upon himself; and, not content with being duke of Milan and\nsovereign of the whole of Lombardy, designed to make himself master of\nTuscany; but while he was intent upon occupying the province with the\nultimate view of making himself king of Italy, he died. Boniface IX.\nsucceeded Urban VI. The anti-pope, Clement VI., also died, and Benedict\nXIII. was appointed his successor.\nMany English, Germans, and Bretons served at this period in the armies\nof Italy, commanded partly by those leaders who had from time to time\nauthority in the country, and partly by such as the pontiffs sent, when\nthey were at Avignon. With these warriors the princes of Italy long\ncarried on their wars, till the coming of Lodovico da Cento of Romagna,\nwho formed a body of Italian soldiery, called the Company of St. George,\nwhose valor and discipline soon caused the foreign troops to fall into\ndisrepute, and gave reputation to the native forces of the country, of\nwhich the princes afterward availed themselves in their wars with each\nother. The pope, Boniface IX., being at enmity with the Romans, went to\nScesi, where he remained till the jubilee of 1400, when the Romans, to\ninduce him to return to the city, consented to receive another foreign\nsenator of his appointing, and also allowed him to fortify the castle of\nSaint Angelo: having returned upon these conditions, in order to enrich\nthe church, he ordained that everyone, upon vacating a benefice, should\npay a year's value of it to the Apostolic Chamber.\nAfter the death of Giovanni Galeazzo, duke of Milan, although he left\ntwo children, Giovanmaria and Filippo, the state was divided into many\nparts, and in the troubles which ensued Giovanmaria was slain. Filippo\nremained some time in the castle of Pavia, from which, through the\nfidelity and virtue of the castellan, he escaped. Among others who\noccupied cities possessed by his father, was Guglielmo della Scala, who,\nbeing banished, fell into the hands of Francesco de Carrera, lord of\nPadua, by whose means he recovered the state of Verona, in which he only\nremained a short time, for he was poisoned, by order of Francesco, and\nthe city taken from him. These things occasioned the people of Vicenza,\nwho had lived in security under the protection of the Visconti, to dread\nthe greatness of the lord of Padua, and they placed themselves under the\nVenetians, who, engaging in arms with him, first took Verona and then\nPadua.\nAt this time Pope Boniface died, and was succeeded by Innocent VII. The\npeople of Rome supplicated him to restore to them their fortresses\nand their liberty; but as he would not consent to their petition,\nthey called to their assistance Ladislaus, king of Naples. Becoming\nreconciled to the people, the pope returned to Rome, and made his nephew\nLodovico count of La Marca. Innocent soon after died, and Gregory XII.\nwas created, upon the understanding to renounce the papacy whenever the\nanti-pope would also renounce it. By the advice of the cardinals, in\norder to attempt the reunion of the church, Benedict, the anti-pope,\ncame to Porto Venere, and Gregory to Lucca, where they made many\nendeavors, but effected nothing. Upon this, the cardinals of both the\npopes abandoned them, Benedict going to Spain, and Gregory to Rimini.\nOn the other hand, the cardinals, with the favor of Balthazar Cossa,\ncardinal and legate of Bologna, appointed a council at Pisa, where they\ncreated Alexander V., who immediately excommunicated King Ladislaus,\nand invested Louis of Anjou with the kingdom; this prince, with the\nFlorentines, Genoese, and Venetians, attacked Ladislaus and drove him\nfrom Rome. In the head of the war Alexander died, and Balthazar Cossa\nsucceeded him, with the title of John XXIII. Leaving Bologna, where he\nwas elected, he went to Rome, and found there Louis of Anjou, who\nhad brought the army from Provence, and coming to an engagement with\nLadislaus, routed him. But by the mismanagement of the leaders, they\nwere unable to prosecute the victory, so that the king in a short time\ngathered strength and retook Rome. Louis fled to Provence, the pope\nto Bologna; where, considering how he might diminish the power of\nLadislaus, he caused Sigismund, king of Hungary, to be elected emperor,\nand advised him to come to Italy. Having a personal interview at Mantua,\nthey agreed to call a general council, in which the church should be\nunited; and having effected this, the pope thought he should be fully\nenabled to oppose the forces of his enemies.\nAt this time there were three popes, Gregory, Benedict, and Giovanni,\nwhich kept the church weak and in disrepute. The city of Constance, in\nGermany, was appointed for the holding of the council, contrary to\nthe expectation of Pope John. And although the death of Ladislaus had\nremoved the cause which induced the pope to call the council, still,\nhaving promised to attend, he could not refuse to go there. In a few\nmonths after his arrival at Constance he discovered his error, but it\nwas too late; endeavoring to escape, he was taken, put into prison, and\ncompelled to renounce the papacy. Gregory, one of the anti-popes, sent\nhis renunciation; Benedict, the other, refusing to do the same, was\ncondemned as a heretic; but, being abandoned by his cardinals, he\ncomplied, and the council elected Oddo, of the Colonnesi family, pope,\nby the title of Martin V. Thus the church was united under one head,\nafter having been divided by many pontiffs.\nFilippo Visconti was, as we have said, in the fortress of Pavia. But\nFazino Cane, who in the affairs of Lombardy had become lord of Vercelli,\nAlessandria, Novara, and Tortona, and had amassed great riches, finding\nhis end approach, and having no children, left his wife Beatrice heiress\nof his estates, and arranged with his friends that a marriage should be\neffected between her and Filippo. By this union Filippo became powerful,\nand reacquired Milan and the whole of Lombardy. By way of being grateful\nfor these numerous favors, as princes commonly are, he accused Beatrice\nof adultery and caused her to be put to death. Finding himself now\npossessed of greater power, he began to think of warring with Tuscany\nand of prosecuting the designs of Giovanni Galeazzo, his father.\nLadislaus, king of Naples, at his death, left to his sister Giovanna the\nkingdom and a large army, under the command of the principal leaders of\nItaly, among the first of whom was Sforza of Cotignuola, reputed by the\nsoldiery of that period to be a very valiant man. The queen, to shun the\ndisgrace of having kept about her person a certain Pandolfello, whom she\nhad brought up, took for her husband Giacopo della Marca, a Frenchman of\nthe royal line, on the condition that he should be content to be called\nPrince of Tarento, and leave to her the title and government of the\nkingdom. But the soldiery, upon his arrival in Naples, proclaimed him\nking; so that between the husband and the wife wars ensued; and although\nthey contended with varying success, the queen at length obtained the\nsuperiority, and became an enemy of the pope. Upon this, in order\nto reduce her to necessity, and that she might be compelled to throw\nherself into his lap, Sforza suddenly withdrew from her service without\ngiving her any pervious notice of his intention to do so. She thus found\nherself at once unarmed, and not having any other source, sought the\nassistance of Alfonzo, king of Aragon and Sicily, adopted him as her\nson, and engaged Braccio of Montone as her captain, who was of equal\nreputation in arms with Sforza, and inimical to the pope, on account of\nhis having taken possession of Perugia and some other places belonging\nto the church. After this, peace was made between the queen and the\npontiff; but King Alfonzo, expecting she would treat him as she had her\nhusband, endeavored secretly to make himself master of the strongholds;\nbut, possessing acute observation, she was beforehand with him, and\nfortified herself in the castle of Naples. Suspicions increasing between\nthem, they had recourse to arms, and the queen, with the assistance\nof Sforza, who again resumed her service, drove Alfonzo out of Naples,\ndeprived him of his succession, and adopted Louis of Anjou in his stead.\nHence arose new contests between Braccio, who took the part of Alfonzo,\nand Sforza, who defended the cause of the queen. In the course of the\nwar, Sforza was drowned in endeavoring to pass the river Pescara; the\nqueen was thus again unarmed, and would have been driven out of the\nkingdom, but for the assistance of Filippo Visconti, the duke of Milan,\nwho compelled Alfonzo to return to Aragon. Braccio, undaunted at the\ndeparture of Alfonzo, continued the enterprise against the queen, and\nbesieged L'Aquilla; but the pope, thinking the greatness of Braccio\ninjurious to the church, received into his pay Francesco, the son of\nSforza, who went in pursuit of Braccio to L'Aquilla, where he routed\nand slew him. Of Braccio remained Oddo, his son, from whom the pope took\nPerugia, and left him the state of Montone alone; but he was shortly\nafterward slain in Romagna, in the service of the Florentines; so that\nof those who had fought under Braccio, Niccolo Piccinino remained of\ngreatest reputation.\nHaving continued our general narration nearly to the period which we at\nfirst proposed to reach, what remains is of little importance, except\nthe war which the Florentines and Venetians carried on against\nFilippo duke of Milan, of which an account will be given when we speak\nparticularly of Florence. I shall, therefore, continue it no further,\nbriefly explaining the condition of Italy in respect of her princes and\nher arms, at the period to which we have now come. Joan II. held Naples,\nLa Marca, the Patrimony and Romagna; some of these places obeyed the\nchurch, while others were held by vicars or tyrants, as Ferrara, Modena,\nand Reggio, by those of the House of Este; Faenza by the Manfredi;\nImola by the Alidossi; Furli by the Ordelaffi; Rimini and Psaro by the\nMalatesti; and Camerino by those of Varano. Part of Lombardy was subject\nto the Duke Filippo, part to the Venetians; for all those who had held\nsingle states were set aside, except the House of Gonzaga, which ruled\nin Mantua. The greater part of Tuscany was subject to the Florentines.\nLucca and Sienna alone were governed by their own laws; Lucca was under\nthe Guinigi; Sienna was free. The Genoese, being sometimes free,\nat others, subject to the kings of France or the Visconti, lived\nunrespected, and may be enumerated among the minor powers.\nNone of the principal states were armed with their own proper forces.\nDuke Filippo kept himself shut up in his apartments, and would not\nallow himself to be seen; his wars were managed by commissaries. The\nVenetians, when they directed their attention to terra firma, threw off\nthose arms which had made them terrible upon the seas, and falling into\nthe customs of Italy, submitted their forces to the direction of others.\nThe practice of arms being unsuitable to priests or women, the pope and\nQueen Joan of Naples were compelled by necessity to submit to the same\nsystem which others practiced from defect of judgment. The Florentines\nalso adopted the same custom, for having, by their frequent divisions,\ndestroyed the nobility, and their republic being wholly in the hands of\nmen brought up to trade, they followed the usages and example of others.\nThus the arms of Italy were either in the hands of the lesser princes,\nor of men who possessed no state; for the minor princes did not adopt\nthe practice of arms from any desire of glory, but for the acquisition\nof either property or safety. The others (those who possessed no state)\nbeing bred to arms from their infancy, were acquainted with no other\nart, and pursued war for emolument, or to confer honor upon themselves.\nThe most noticed among the latter were Carmignola, Francesco Sforza,\nNiccolo Piccinino the pupil of Braccio, Agnolo della Pergola, Lorenzo\ndi Micheletto Attenduli, il Tartaglia, Giacopaccio, Cecolini da Perugia,\nNiccolo da Tolentino, Guido Torello, Antonia dal Ponte ad Era, and many\nothers. With these, were those lords of whom I have before spoken, to\nwhich may be added the barons of Rome, the Colonnesi and the Orsini,\nwith other lords and gentlemen of the kingdoms of Naples and Lombardy,\nwho, being constantly in arms, had such an understanding among\nthemselves, and so contrived to accommodate things to their own\nconvenience, that of those who were at war, most commonly both\nsides were losers; and they had made the practice of arms so totally\nridiculous, that the most ordinary leader, possessed of true valor,\nwould have covered these men with disgrace, whom, with so little\nprudence, Italy honored.\nWith these idle princes and such contemptible arms, my history must,\ntherefore, be filled; to which, before I descend, it will be necessary,\nas was at first proposed, to speak of the origin of Florence, that it\nmay be clearly understood what was the state of the city in those times,\nand by what means, through the labours of a thousand years, she became\nso imbecile.\nBOOK II\nCHAPTER I\nThe custom of ancient republics to plant colonies, and the advantage of\nit--Increased population tends to make countries more healthy--Origin\nof Florence--Aggrandizement of Florence--Origin of the name of\nFlorence--Destruction of Florence by Totila--The Florentines\ntake Fiesole--The first division in Florence, and the cause of\nit--Buondelmonti--Buondelmonti slain--Guelphs and Ghibellines in\nFlorence--Guelphic families--Ghibelline families--The two factions come\nto terms.\nAmong the great and wonderful institutions of the republics and\nprincipalities of antiquity that have now gone into disuse, was that by\nmeans of which towns and cities were from time to time established; and\nthere is nothing more worthy the attention of a great prince, or of\na well-regulated republic, or that confers so many advantages upon a\nprovince, as the settlement of new places, where men are drawn together\nfor mutual accommodation and defense. This may easily be done, by\nsending people to reside in recently acquired or uninhabited countries.\nBesides causing the establishment of new cities, these removals render\na conquered country more secure, and keep the inhabitants of a province\nproperly distributed. Thus, deriving the greatest attainable comfort,\nthe inhabitants increase rapidly, are more prompt to attack others, and\ndefend themselves with greater assurance. This custom, by the unwise\npractice of princes and republics, having gone into desuetude, the ruin\nand weakness of territories has followed; for this ordination is that\nby which alone empires are made secure, and countries become populated.\nSafety is the result of it; because the colony which a prince\nestablishes in a newly acquired country, is like a fortress and a\nguard, to keep the inhabitants in fidelity and obedience. Neither can\na province be wholly occupied and preserve a proper distribution of its\ninhabitants without this regulation; for all districts are not equally\nhealthy, and hence some will abound to overflowing, while others are\nvoid; and if there be no method of withdrawing them from places in which\nthey increase too rapidly, and planting them where they are too few the\ncountry would soon be wasted; for one part would become a desert, and\nthe other a dense and wretched population. And, as nature cannot repair\nthis disorder, it is necessary that industry should effect it, for\nunhealthy localities become wholesome when a numerous population is\nbrought into them. With cultivation the earth becomes fruitful, and the\nair is purified with fires--remedies which nature cannot provide. The\ncity of Venice proves the correctness of these remarks. Being placed in\na marshy and unwholesome situation, it became healthy only by the\nnumber of industrious individuals who were drawn together. Pisa, too, on\naccount of its unwholesome air, was never filled with inhabitants,\ntill the Saracens, having destroyed Genoa and rendered her rivers\nunnavigable, caused the Genoese to migrate thither in vast numbers, and\nthus render her populous and powerful. Where the use of colonies is not\nadopted, conquered countries are held with great difficulty; districts\nonce uninhabited still remain so, and those which populate quickly\nare not relieved. Hence it is that many places of the world, and\nparticularly in Italy, in comparison of ancient times, have become\ndeserts. This has wholly arisen and proceeded from the negligence of\nprinces, who have lost all appetite for true glory, and of republics\nwhich no longer possess institutions that deserve praise. In ancient\ntimes, by means of colonies, new cities frequently arose, and those\nalready begun were enlarged, as was the case with Florence, which had\nits beginning from Fiesole, and its increase from colonies.\nIt is exceedingly probable, as Dante and Giovanni Villani show, that the\ncity of Fiesole, being situate upon the summit of the mountain, in\norder that her markets might be more frequented, and afford greater\naccommodation for those who brought merchandise, would appoint the place\nin which to told them, not upon the hill, but in the plain, between the\nfoot of the mountain and the river Arno. I imagine these markets to have\noccasioned the first erections that were made in those places, and\nto have induced merchants to wish for commodious warehouses for the\nreception of their goods, and which, in time, became substantial\nbuildings. And afterward, when the Romans, having conquered the\nCarthaginians, rendered Italy secure from foreign invasion, these\nbuildings would greatly increase; for men never endure inconveniences\nunless some powerful necessity compels them. Thus, although the fear\nof war induces a willingness to occupy places strong and difficult of\naccess, as soon as the cause of alarm is removed, men gladly resort to\nmore convenient and easily attainable localities. Hence, the security\nto which the reputation of the Roman republic gave birth, caused the\ninhabitants, having begun in the manner described, to increase so much\nas to form a town, this was at first called the Villa Arnina. After this\noccurred the civil wars between Marius and Sylla; then those of C\u00e6sar,\nand Pompey; and next those of the murderers of C\u00e6sar, and the parties\nwho undertook to avenge his death. Therefore, first by Sylla, and\nafterward by the three Roman citizens, who, having avenged the death\nof C\u00e6sar, divided the empire among themselves, colonies were sent to\nFiesole, which, either in part or in whole, fixed their habitations in\nthe plain, near to the then rising town. By this increase, the place\nbecame so filled with dwellings, that it might with propriety be\nenumerated among the cities of Italy.\nThere are various opinions concerning the derivation of the word\nFlorentia. Some suppose it to come from Florinus, one of the principal\npersons of the colony; others think it was originally not Florentia, but\nFluentia, and suppose the word derived from _fluente_, or flowing of the\nArno; and in support of their opinion, adduce a passage from Pliny, who\nsays, \"the Fluentini are near the flowing of the Arno.\" This, however,\nmay be incorrect, for Pliny speaks of the locality of the Florentini,\nnot of the name by which they were known. And it seems as if the word\nFluentini were a corruption, because Frontinus and Cornelius Tacitus,\nwho wrote at nearly the same period as Pliny, call them Florentia and\nFlorentini; for, in the time of Tiberius, they were governed like\nthe other cities of Italy. Besides, Cornelius refers to the coming of\nambassadors from the Florentines, to beg of the emperor that the waters\nof the Chiane might not be allowed to overflow their country; and it is\nnot at all reasonable that the city should have two names at the same\ntime. Therefore I think that, however derived, the name was always\nFlorentia, and that whatever the origin might be, it occurred under the\nRoman empire, and began to be noticed by writers in the times of the\nfirst emperors.\nWhen the Roman empire was afflicted by the barbarians, Florence was\ndestroyed by Totila, king of the Ostrogoths; and after a period of two\nhundred and fifty years, rebuilt by Charlemagne; from whose time, till\nthe year 1215, she participated in the fortune of the rest of Italy;\nand, during this period, first the descendants of Charles, then the\nBerengarii, and lastly the German emperors, governed her, as in our\ngeneral treatise we have shown. Nor could the Florentines, during those\nages, increase in numbers, or effect anything worthy of memory,\non account of the influence of those to whom they were subject.\nNevertheless, in the year 1010, upon the feast of St. Romolo, a solemn\nday with the Fiesolani, they took and destroyed Fiesole, which must have\nbeen performed either with the consent of the emperors, or during the\ninterim from the death of one to the creation of his successor, when\nall assumed a larger share of liberty. But then the pontiffs acquired\ngreater influence, and the authority of the German emperors was in its\nwane, all the places of Italy governed themselves with less respect for\nthe prince; so that, in the time of Henry III. the mind of the country\nwas divided between the emperor and the church. However, the Florentines\nkept themselves united until the year 1215, rendering obedience to the\nruling power, and anxious only to preserve their own safety. But, as\nthe diseases which attack our bodies are more dangerous and mortal in\nproportion as they are delayed, so Florence, though late to take part in\nthe sects of Italy, was afterward the more afflicted by them. The cause\nof her first division is well known, having been recorded by Dante and\nmany other writers; I shall, however, briefly notice it.\nAmong the most powerful families of Florence were the Buondelmonti and\nthe Uberti; next to these were the Amidei and the Donati. Of the Donati\nfamily there was a rich widow who had a daughter of exquisite beauty,\nfor whom, in her own mind, she had fixed upon Buondelmonti, a young\ngentleman, the head of the Buondelmonti family, as her husband; but\neither from negligence, or, because she thought it might be accomplished\nat any time, she had not made known her intention, when it happened that\nthe cavalier betrothed himself to a maiden of the Amidei family. This\ngrieved the Donati widow exceedingly; but she hoped, with her daughter's\nbeauty, to disturb the arrangement before the celebration of the\nmarriage; and from an upper apartment, seeing Buondelmonti approach her\nhouse alone, she descended, and as he was passing she said to him, \"I\nam glad to learn you have chosen a wife, although I had reserved my\ndaughter for you;\" and, pushing the door open, presented her to his\nview. The cavalier, seeing the beauty of the girl, which was very\nuncommon, and considering the nobility of her blood, and her portion not\nbeing inferior to that of the lady whom he had chosen, became inflamed\nwith such an ardent desire to possess her, that, not thinking of the\npromise given, or the injury he committed in breaking it, or of the\nevils which his breach of faith might bring upon himself, said, \"Since\nyou have reserved her for me, I should be very ungrateful indeed to\nrefuse her, being yet at liberty to choose;\" and without any delay\nmarried her. As soon as the fact became known, the Amidei and the\nUberti, whose families were allied, were filled with rage, and having\nassembled with many others, connections of the parties, they concluded\nthat the injury could not be tolerated without disgrace, and that the\nonly vengeance proportionate to the enormity of the offence would be to\nput Buondelmonti to death. And although some took into consideration the\nevils that might ensue upon it, Mosca Lamberti said, that those who talk\nof many things effect nothing, using that trite and common adage, _Cosa\nfatta capo ha_. Thereupon, they appointed to the execution of the murder\nMosca himself, Stiatti Uberti, Lambertuccio Amidei, and Oderigo Fifanti,\nwho, on the morning of Easter day, concealed themselves in a house of\nthe Amidei, situate between the old bridge and St. Stephen's, and as\nBuondelmonti was passing upon a white horse, thinking it as easy a\nmatter to forget an injury as reject an alliance, he was attacked by\nthem at the foot of the bridge, and slain close by a statue of Mars.\nThis murder divided the whole city; one party espousing the cause of\nthe Buondelmonti, the other that of the Uberti; and as these families\npossessed men and means of defense, they contended with each other for\nmany years, without one being able to destroy the other.\nFlorence continued in these troubles till the time of Frederick II.,\nwho, being king of Naples, endeavored to strengthen himself against the\nchurch; and, to give greater stability to his power in Tuscany, favored\nthe Uberti and their followers, who, with his assistance, expelled the\nBuondelmonti; thus our city, as all the rest of Italy had long time\nbeen, became divided into Guelphs and Ghibellines; and as it will not\nbe superfluous, I shall record the names of the families which took part\nwith each faction. Those who adopted the cause of the Guelphs were\nthe Buondelmonti, Nerli, Rossi, Frescobaldi, Mozzi, Bardi, Pulci,\nGherardini, Foraboschi, Bagnesi, Guidalotti, Sacchetti, Manieri,\nLucardesi, Chiaramontesi, Compiobbesi, Cavalcanti, Giandonati,\nGianfigliazzi, Scali, Gualterotti, Importuni, Bostichi, Tornaquinci,\nVecchietti, Tosinghi, Arrigucci, Agli, Sizi, Adimari, Visdomini, Donati,\nPassi, della Bella, Ardinghi, Tedaldi, Cerchi. Of the Ghibelline\nfaction were the Uberti, Manelli, Ubriachi, Fifanti, Amidei, Infangati,\nMalespini, Scolari, Guidi, Galli, Cappiardi, Lamberti, Soldanieri,\nCipriani, Toschi, Amieri, Palermini, Migliorelli, Pigli, Barucci,\nCattani, Agolanti, Brunelleschi, Caponsacchi, Elisei, Abati, Tidaldini,\nGiuochi, and Galigai. Besides the noble families on each side above\nenumerated, each party was joined by many of the higher ranks of the\npeople, so that the whole city was corrupted with this division. The\nGuelphs being expelled, took refuge in the Upper Val d'Arno, where\npart of their castles and strongholds were situated, and where they\nstrengthened and fortified themselves against the attacks of their\nenemies. But, upon the death of Frederick, the most unbiased men, and\nthose who had the greatest authority with the people, considered that it\nwould be better to effect the reunion of the city, than, by keeping her\ndivided, cause her ruin. They therefore induced the Guelphs to forget\ntheir injuries and return, and the Ghibellines to lay aside their\njealousies and receive them with cordiality.\nCHAPTER II\nNew form of government in Florence--Military establishments--The\ngreatness of Florence--Movements of the Ghibellines--Ghibellines\ndriven out of the city--Guelphs routed by the forces of the king of\nNaples--Florence in the power of the king of Naples--Project of\nthe Ghibellines to destroy Florence opposed by Farinata degli\nUberti--Adventures of the Guelphs of Florence--The pope gives his\nstandard to the Guelphs--Fears of the Ghibellines and their preparations\nfor the defense of their power--Establishment of trades' companies, and\ntheir authority--Count Guido Novello expelled--He goes to Prato--The\nGuelphs restored to the city--The Ghibellines quit Florence--The\nFlorentines reform the government in favor of the Guelphs--The pope\nendeavors to restore the Ghibellines and excommunicates Florence--Pope\nNicholas III. endeavors to abate the power of Charles king of Naples.\nBeing united, the Florentines thought the time favorable for the\nordination of a free government, and that it would be desirable to\nprovide their means of defense before the new emperor should acquire\nstrength. They therefore divided the city into six parts, and elected\ntwelve citizens, two for each sixth, to govern the whole. These were\ncalled Anziani, and were elected annually. To remove the cause of those\nenmities which had been observed to arise from judicial decisions, they\nprovided two judges from some other state,--one called captain of the\npeople, the other podesta, or provost,--whose duty it was to decide in\ncases, whether civil or criminal, which occurred among the people. And\nas order cannot be preserved without a sufficient force for the defense\nof it, they appointed twenty banners in the city, and seventy-six in the\ncountry, upon the rolls of which the names of all the youth were armed;\nand it was ordered that everyone should appear armed, under his banner,\nwhenever summoned, whether by the captain of the people or the Anziani.\nThey had ensigns according to the kind of arms they used, the bowmen\nbeing under one ensign, and the swordsmen, or those who carried a\ntarget, under another; and every year, upon the day of Pentecost,\nensigns were given with great pomp to the new men, and new leaders\nwere appointed for the whole establishment. To give importance to their\narmies, and to serve as a point of refuge for those who were exhausted\nin the fight, and from which, having become refreshed, they might again\nmake head against the enemy, they provided a large car, drawn by two\noxen, covered with red cloth, upon which was an ensign of white and red.\nWhen they intended to assemble the army, this car was brought into the\nNew Market, and delivered with pomp to the heads of the people. To give\nsolemnity to their enterprises, they had a bell called Martinella, which\nwas rung during a whole month before the forces left the city, in order\nthat the enemy might have time to provide for his defense; so great was\nthe virtue then existing among men, and with so much generosity of mind\nwere they governed, that as it is now considered a brave and prudent act\nto assail an unprovided enemy, in those days it would have been thought\ndisgraceful, and productive only of a fallacious advantage. This bell\nwas also taken with the army, and served to regulate the keeping and\nrelief of guard, and other matters necessary in the practice of war.\nWith these ordinations, civil and military, the Florentines established\ntheir liberty. Nor is it possible to imagine the power and authority\nFlorence in a short time acquired. She became not only the head of\nTuscany, but was enumerated among the first cities of Italy, and would\nhave attained greatness of the most exalted kind, had she not been\nafflicted with the continual divisions of her citizens. They remained\nunder the this government ten years, during which time they compelled\nthe people of Pistoria, Arezzo, and Sienna, to enter into league with\nthem; and returning with the army from Sienna, they took Volterra,\ndestroyed some castles, and led the inhabitants to Florence. All these\nenterprises were effected by the advice of the Guelphs, who were much\nmore powerful than the Ghibellines, for the latter were hated by the\npeople as well on account of their haughty bearing while in power,\nduring the time of Frederick, as because the church party was in more\nfavor than that of the emperor; for with the aid of the church they\nhoped to preserve their liberty, but, with the emperor, they were\napprehensive of losing it.\nThe Ghibellines, in the meantime, finding themselves divested of\nauthority, could not rest, but watched for an occasion of repossessing\nthe government; and they thought the favorable moment come, when they\nfound that Manfred, son of Frederick, had made himself sovereign of\nNaples, and reduced the power of the church. They, therefore, secretly\ncommunicated with him, to resume the management of the state, but\ncould not prevent their proceedings from coming to the knowledge of the\nAnziani, who immediately summoned the Uberti to appear before them; but\ninstead of obeying, they took arms and fortified themselves in their\nhouses. The people, enraged at this, armed themselves, and with the\nassistance of the Guelphs, compelled them to quit the city, and,\nwith the whole Ghibelline party, withdraw to Sienna. They then asked\nassistance of Manfred king of Naples, and by the able conduct of\nFarinata degli Uberti, the Guelphs were routed by the king's forces\nupon the river Arbia, with so great slaughter, that those who escaped,\nthinking Florence lost, did not return thither, but sought refuge at\nLucca.\nManfred sent the Count Giordano, a man of considerable reputation\nin arms, to command his forces. He after the victory, went with the\nGhibellines to Florence, and reduced the city entirely to the king's\nauthority, annulling the magistracies and every other institution that\nretained any appearance of freedom. This injury, committed with little\nprudence, excited the ardent animosity of the people, and their enmity\nagainst the Ghibellines, whose ruin it eventually caused, was increased\nto the highest pitch. The necessities of the kingdom compelling the\nCount Giordano to return to Naples, he left at Florence as regal vicar\nthe Count Guido Novallo, lord of Casentino, who called a council of\nGhibellines at Empoli. There it was concluded, with only one dissenting\nvoice, that in order to preserve their power in Tuscany, it would be\nnecessary to destroy Florence, as the only means of compelling the\nGuelphs to withdraw their support from the party of the church. To this\nso cruel a sentence, given against such a noble city, there was not a\ncitizen who offered any opposition, except Farinata degli Uberti, who\nopenly defended her, saying he had not encountered so many dangers and\ndifficulties, but in the hope of returning to his country; that he still\nwished for what he had so earnestly sought, nor would he refuse the\nblessing which fortune now presented, even though by using it, he were\nto become as much an enemy of those who thought otherwise, as he had\nbeen of the Guelphs; and that no one need be afraid the city would\noccasion the ruin of their country, for he hoped that the valor which\nhad expelled the Guelphs, would be sufficient to defend her. Farinata\nwas a man of undaunted resolution, and excelled greatly in military\naffairs: being the head of the Ghibelline party, and in high estimation\nwith Manfred, his authority put a stop to the discussion, and induced\nthe rest to think of some other means of preserving their power.\nThe Lucchese being threatened with the anger of the count, for affording\nrefuge to the Guelphs after the battle of the Arbia, could allow them\nto remain no longer; so leaving Lucca, they went to Bologna, from whence\nthey were called by the Guelphs of Parma against the Ghibellines of that\ncity, where, having overcome the enemy, the possessions of the latter\nwere assigned to them; so that having increased in honors and riches,\nand learning that Pope Clement had invited Charles of Anjou to take the\nkingdom from Manfred, they sent ambassadors to the pope to offer him\ntheir services. His holiness not only received them as friends, but gave\nthem a standard upon which his insignia were wrought. It was ever after\nborne by the Guelphs in battle, and is still used at Florence. Charles\nhaving taken the kingdom from Manfred, and slain him, to which success\nthe Guelphs of Florence had contributed, their party became more\npowerful, and that of the Ghibellines proportionately weaker. In\nconsequence of this, those who with Count Novello governed the city,\nthought it would be advisable to attach to themselves, with some\nconcession, the people whom they had previously aggravated with every\nspecies of injury; but these remedies which, if applied before the\nnecessity came would have been beneficial, being offered when they were\nno longer considered favors, not only failed of producing any beneficial\nresults to the donors, but hastened their ruin. Thinking, however, to\nwin them to their interests, they restored some of the honors of which\nthey had deprived them. They elected thirty-six citizens from the higher\nrank of the people, to whom, with two cavaliers, knights or gentlemen,\nbrought from Bologna, the reformation of the government of the city\nwas confided. As soon as they met, they classed the whole of the\npeople according to their arts or trades, and over each art appointed a\nmagistrate, whose duty was to distribute justice to those placed under\nhim. They gave to each company or trade a banner, under which every man\nwas expected to appear armed, whenever the city required it. These arts\nwere at first twelve, seven major and five minor. The minor arts were\nafterward increased to fourteen, so that the whole made, as at present,\ntwenty-one. The thirty-six reformers also effected other changes for the\ncommon good.\nCount Guido proposed to lay a tax upon the citizens for the support of\nthe soldiery; but during the discussion found so much difficulty, that\nhe did not dare to use force to obtain it; and thinking he had now lost\nthe government, called together the leaders of the Ghibellines, and they\ndetermined to wrest from the people those powers which they had with so\nlittle prudence conceded. When they thought they had sufficient force,\nthe thirty-six being assembled, they caused a tumult to be raised, which\nso alarmed them that they retired to their houses, when suddenly the\nbanners of the Arts were unfurled, and many armed men drawn to them.\nThese, learning that Count Guido and his followers were at St. John's,\nmoved toward the Holy Trinity, and chose Giovanni Soldanieri for their\nleader. The count, on the other hand, being informed where the people\nwere assembled, proceeded in that direction; nor did the people shun the\nfight, for, meeting their enemies where now stands the residence of the\nTornaquinci, they put the count to flight, with the loss of many of his\nfollowers. Terrified with this result, he was afraid his enemies would\nattack him in the night, and that his own party, finding themselves\nbeaten, would murder him. This impression took such hold of his mind\nthat, without attempting any other remedy, he sought his safety rather\nin flight than in combat, and, contrary to the advice of the rectors,\nwent with all his people to Prato. But, on finding himself in a place\nof safety, his fears fled; perceiving his error he wished to correct it,\nand on the following day, as soon as light appeared, he returned\nwith his people to Florence, to enter the city by force which he had\nabandoned in cowardice. But his design did not succeed; for the people,\nwho had had difficulty in expelling him, kept him out with facility; so\nthat with grief and shame he went to the Casentino, and the Ghibellines\nwithdrew to their villas.\nThe people being victorious, by the advice of those who loved the good\nof the republic, determined to reunite the city, and recall all the\ncitizens as well Guelph as Ghibelline, who yet remained without. The\nGuelphs returned, after having been expelled six years; the recent\noffences of the Ghibellines were forgiven, and themselves restored to\ntheir country. They were, however, most cordially hated, both by the\npeople and the Guelphs, for the latter could not forget their exile,\nand the former but too well remembered their tyranny when they were in\npower; the result was, that the minds of neither party became settled.\nWhile affairs were in this state at Florence, a report prevailed that\nCorradino, nephew of Manfred, was coming with a force from Germany, for\nthe conquest of Naples; this gave the Ghibellines hope of recovering\npower, and the Guelphs, considering how they should provide for their\nsecurity, requested assistance from Charles for their defense, in\ncase of the passage of Corradino. The coming of the forces of Charles\nrendered the Guelphs insolent, and so alarmed the Ghibellines that they\nfled the city, without being driven out, two days before the arrival of\nthe troops.\nThe Ghibellines having departed, the Florentines reorganized the\ngovernment of the city, and elected twelve men who, as the supreme\npower, were to hold their magistracy two months, and were not called\nAnziani or \"ancients,\" but Buono Uomini or \"good men.\" They also formed\na council of eighty citizens, which they called the Credenza. Besides\nthese, from each sixth, thirty citizens were chosen, who, with the\nCredenza and the twelve Buono Uomini, were called the General Council.\nThey also appointed another council of one hundred and twenty citizens,\nelected from the people and the nobility, to which all those things\nwere finally referred that had undergone the consideration of the other\ncouncils, and which distributed the offices of the republic. Having\nformed this government, they strengthened the Guelphic party by\nappointing its friends to the principal offices of state, and a variety\nof other measures, that they might be enabled to defend themselves\nagainst the Ghibellines, whose property they divided into three parts,\none of which was applied to the public use, another to the Capitani, and\nthe third was assigned to the Guelphs, in satisfaction of the injuries\nthey had received. The pope, too, in order to keep Tuscany in the\nGuelphic interest, made Charles imperial vicar over the province.\nWhile the Florentines, by virtue of the new government, preserved their\ninfluence at home by laws, and abroad with arms, the pope died, and\nafter a dispute, which continued two years, Gregory X. was elected,\nbeing then in Syria, where he had long lived; but not having witnessed\nthe working of parties, he did not estimate them in the manner his\npredecessors had done, and passing through Florence on his way to\nFrance, he thought it would be the office of a good pastor to unite the\ncity, and so far succeeded that the Florentines consented to receive the\nSyndics of the Ghibellines in Florence to consider the terms of their\nrecall. They effected an agreement, but the Ghibellines without were so\nterrified that they did not venture to return. The pope laid the whole\nblame upon the city, and being enraged excommunicated her, in which\nstate of contumacy she remained as long as the pontiff lived; but was\nreblessed by his successor Innocent V.\nThe pontificate was afterward occupied by Nicholas III. of the Orsini\nfamily. It has to be remarked that it was invariably the custom of the\npopes to be jealous of those whose power in Italy had become great, even\nwhen its growth had been occasioned by the favors of the church; and as\nthey always endeavored to destroy it, frequent troubles and changes were\nthe result. Their fear of a powerful person caused them to increase the\ninfluence of one previously weak; his becoming great caused him also to\nbe feared, and his being feared made them seek the means of destroying\nhim. This mode of thinking and operation occasioned the kingdom of\nNaples to be taken from Manfred and given to Charles, but as soon as\nthe latter became powerful his ruin was resolved upon. Actuated by\nthese motives, Nicholas III. contrived that, with the influence of the\nemperor, the government of Tuscany should be taken from Charles, and\nLatino his legate was therefore sent into the province in the name of\nthe empire.\nCHAPTER III\nChanges in Florence--The Ghibellines recalled--New form of government in\nFlorence--The Signory created--Victory over the Aretins--The Gonfalonier\nof Justice created--Ubaldo Ruffoli the first Gonfalonier--Giano della\nBella--New reform by his advice--Giano della Bella becomes a voluntary\nexile--Dissensions between the people and the nobility--The tumults\ncomposed--Reform of Government--Public buildings--The prosperous state\nof the city.\nFlorence was at this time in a very unhappy condition; for the great\nGuelphic families had become insolent, and set aside the authority\nof the magistrates; so that murders and other atrocities were daily\ncommitted, and the perpetrators escaped unpunished, under the protection\nof one or other of the nobility. The leaders of the people, in order\nto restrain this insolence, determined to recall those who had been\nexpelled, and thus gave the legate an opportunity of uniting the city.\nThe Ghibellines returned, and, instead of twelve governors, fourteen\nwere appointed, seven for each party, who held their office one year,\nand were to be chosen by the pope. The Florentines lived under this\ngovernment two years, till the pontificate of Martin, who restored to\nCharles all the authority which had been taken from him by Nicholas, so\nthat parties were again active in Tuscany; for the Florentines took arms\nagainst the emperor's governor, and to deprive the Ghibellines of power,\nand restrain the nobility, established a new form of government. This\nwas in the year 1282, and the companies of the Arts, since magistrates\nhad been appointed and colors given to them, had acquired so great\ninfluence, that of their own authority they ordered that, instead of\nfourteen citizens, three should be appointed and called Priors, to hold\nthe government of the republic two months, and chosen from either the\npeople or the nobility. After the expiration of the first magistracy\nthey were augmented to six, that one might be chosen from each sixth\nof the city, and this number was preserved till the year 1342, when the\ncity was divided into quarters, and the Priors became eight, although\nupon some occasions during the interim they were twelve.\nThis government, as will be seen hereafter, occasioned the ruin of\nthe nobility; for the people by various causes excluded them from all\nparticipation in it, and then trampled upon them without respect. The\nnobles at first, owing to their divisions among themselves, made no\nopposition; and each being anxious to rob the other of influence in the\nstate, they lost it altogether. To this government a palace was given,\nin which they were to reside constantly, and all requisite officers\nwere appointed; it having been previously the custom of councils and\nmagistrates to assemble in churches. At first they were only called\nPriors, but to increase their distinction the word signori, or lords,\nwas soon afterward adopted. The Florentines remained for some time in\ndomestic quiet, during which they made war with the Aretins for having\nexpelled the Guelphs, and obtained a complete victory over them at\nCampaldino. The city being increased in riches and population, it was\nfound expedient to extend the walls, the circle of which was enlarged to\nthe extent it at present remains, although its diameter was previously\nonly the space between the old bridge and the church of St. Lorenzo.\nWars abroad and peace within the city had caused the Guelph and\nGhibelline factions to become almost extinct; and the only party feeling\nwhich seemed occasionally to glow, was that which naturally exists in\nall cities between the higher classes and the people; for the latter,\nwishing to live in conformity with the laws, and the former to be\nthemselves the rulers of the people, it was not possible for them to\nabide in perfect amity together. This ungenial disposition, while their\nfear of the Ghibellines kept them in order, did not discover itself, but\nno sooner were they subdued than it broke forth, and not a day passed\nwithout some of the populace being injured, while the laws were\ninsufficient to procure redress, for every noble with his relations\nand friends defended himself against the forces of the Priors and\nthe Capitano. To remedy this evil, the leaders of the Arts' companies\nordered that every Signory at the time of entering upon the duties of\noffice should appoint a Gonfalonier of Justice, chosen from the people,\nand place a thousand armed men at his disposal divided into twenty\ncompanies of fifty men each, and that he, with his gonfalon or banner\nand his forces, should be ready to enforce the execution of the laws\nwhenever called upon, either by the Signors themselves or the Capitano.\nThe first elected to this high office was Ubaldo Ruffoli. This man\nunfurled his gonfalon, and destroyed the houses of the Galletti, on\naccount of a member of that family having slain one of the Florentine\npeople in France. The violent animosities among the nobility enabled\nthe companies of the Arts to establish this law with facility; and the\nformer no sooner saw the provision which had been made against them than\nthey felt the acrimonious spirit with which it was enforced. At first\nit impressed them with greater terror, but they soon after returned to\ntheir accustomed insolence, for one or more of their body always\nmaking part of the Signory, gave them opportunities of impeding the\nGonfalonier, so that he could not perform the duties of his office.\nBesides this, the accuser always required a witness of the injury he had\nreceived, and no one dared to give evidence against the nobility. Thus\nin a short time Florence again fell into the same disorders as before,\nand the tyranny exercised against the people was as great as ever; for\nthe decisions of justice were either prevented or delayed, and sentences\nwere not carried into execution.\nIn this unhappy state, the people not knowing what to do, Giano della\nBella, of a very noble family, and a lover of liberty, encouraged the\nheads of the Arts to reform the constitution of the city; and by his\nadvice it was ordered that the Gonfalonier should reside with the\nPriors, and have four thousand men at his command. They deprived\nthe nobility of the right to sit in the Signory. They condemned the\nassociates of a criminal to the same penalty as himself, and ordered\nthat public report should be taken as evidence. By these laws, which\nwere called the ordinations of justice, the people acquired great\ninfluence, and Giano della Bella not a small share of trouble; for he\nwas thoroughly hated by the great, as the destroyer of their power,\nwhile the opulent among the people envied him, for they thought he\npossessed too great authority. This became very evident upon the first\noccasion that presented itself.\nIt happened that a man from the class of the people was killed in a\nriot, in which several of the nobility had taken a part, and among the\nrest Corso Donati, to whom, as the most forward of the party, the death\nwas attributed. He was, therefore, taken by the captain of the people,\nand whether he was really innocent of the crime or the Capitano was\nafraid of condemning him, he was acquitted. This acquittal displeased\nthe people so much, that, seizing their arms, they ran to the house of\nGiano della Bella, to beg that he would compel the execution of those\nlaws which he had himself made. Giano, who wished Corso to be punished,\ndid not insist upon their laying down their arms, as many were of\nopinion he ought to have done, but advised them to go to the\nSignory, complain of the fact, and beg that they would take it into\nconsideration. The people, full of wrath, thinking themselves insulted\nby the Capitano and abandoned by Giano della Bella, instead of going\nto the Signory went to the palace of the Capitano, of which they made\nthemselves masters, and plundered it.\nThis outrage displeased the whole city, and those who wished the ruin of\nGiano laid the entire blame upon him; and as in the succeeding Signory\nthere was an enemy of his, he was accused to the Capitano as the\noriginator of the riot. While the case was being tried, the people took\narms, and, proceeding to his house, offered to defend him against the\nSignory and his enemies. Giano, however, did not wish to put this burst\nof popular favor to the proof, or trust his life to the magistrates, for\nhe feared the malignity of the latter and the instability of the former;\nso, in order to remove an occasion for his enemies to injure him, or\nhis friends to offend the laws, he determined to withdraw, deliver his\ncountrymen from the fear they had of him, and, leaving the city which\nat his own charge and peril he had delivered from the servitude of the\ngreat, become a voluntary exile.\nAfter the departure of Giano della Bella the nobility began to entertain\nhopes of recovering their authority; and judging their misfortune to\nhave arisen from their divisions, they sent two of their body to the\nSignory, which they thought was favorable to them, to beg they would be\npleased to moderate the severity of the laws made against them. As soon\nas their demand became known, the minds of the people were much excited;\nfor they were afraid the Signors would submit to them; and so, between\nthe desire of the nobility and the jealousy of the people, arms were\nresorted to. The nobility were drawn together in three places: near the\nchurch of St. John, in the New Market, and in the Piazza of the Mozzi,\nunder three leaders, Forese Adimari, Vanni de Mozzi, and Geri Spini.\nThe people assembled in immense numbers, under their ensigns, before the\npalace of the Signory, which at that time was situated near St. Procolo;\nand, as they suspected the integrity of the Signory, they added six\ncitizens to their number to take part in the management of affairs.\nWhile both parties were preparing for the fight, some individuals, as\nwell of the people as of the nobility, accompanied by a few priests of\nrespectable character, mingled among them for the purpose of effecting\na pacification, reminding the nobility that their loss of power, and the\nlaws which were made against them, had been occasioned by their haughty\nconduct, and the mischievous tendency of their proceedings; that\nresorting to arms to recover by force what they had lost by illiberal\nmeasures and disunion, would tend to the destruction of their country\nand increase the difficulties of their own position; that they should\nbear in mind that the people, both in riches, numbers, and hatred, were\nfar stronger than they; and that their nobility, on account of which\nthey assumed to be above others, did not contribute to win battles, and\nwould be found, when they came to arms, to be but an empty name, and\ninsufficient to defend them against so many. On the other hand, they\nreminded the people that it is not prudent to wish always to have the\nlast blow; that it is an injudicious step to drive men to desperation,\nfor he who is without hope is also without fear; that they ought not\nto forget that in the wars the nobility had always done honor to the\ncountry, and therefore it was neither wise nor just to pursue them\nwith so much bitterness; and that although the nobility could bear with\npatience the loss of the supreme magistracy, they could not endure that,\nby the existing laws, it should be in the power of everyone to drive\nthem from their country; and, therefore, it would be well to qualify\nthese laws, and, in furtherance of so good a result, be better to lay\ndown their arms than, trusting to numbers, try the fortune of a battle;\nfor it is often seen that the many are overcome by the few. Variety of\nopinion was found among the people; many wished to decide the question\nby arms at once, for they were assured it would have to be done some\ntime, and that it would be better to do so then than delay till\nthe enemy had acquired greater strength; and that if they thought a\nmitigation of the laws would satisfy them, that then they would be glad\nto comply, but that the pride of the nobility was so great they would\nnot submit unless they were compelled. To many others, who were more\npeaceable and better disposed, it appeared a less evil to qualify the\nlaws a little than to come to battle; and their opinion prevailing, it\nwas provided that no accusation against the nobility could be received\nunless supported with sufficient testimony.\nAlthough arms were laid aside, both parties remained full of suspicion,\nand each fortified itself with men and places of strength. The people\nreorganized the government, and lessened the number of its officers, to\nwhich measure they were induced by finding that the Signors appointed\nfrom the families, of which the following were the heads, had been\nfavorable to the nobility, viz.: the Mancini, Magalotti, Altoviti,\nPeruzzi, and Cerretani. Having settled the government, for the greater\nmagnificence and security of the Signory, they laid the foundation of\ntheir palace; and to make space for the piazza, removed the houses that\nhad belonged to the Uberti; they also at the same period commenced the\npublic prisons. These buildings were completed in a few years; nor did\nour city ever enjoy a greater state of prosperity than in those times:\nfilled with men of great wealth and reputation; possessing within her\nwalls 30,000 men capable of bearing arms, and in the country 70,000,\nwhile the whole of Tuscany, either as subjects or friends, owed\nobedience to Florence. And although there might be some indignation and\njealousy between the nobility and the people, they did not produce any\nevil effect, but all lived together in unity and peace. And if this\npeace had not been disturbed by internal enmities there would have been\nno cause of apprehension whatever, for the city had nothing to fear\neither from the empire or from those citizens whom political reasons\nkept from their homes, and was in condition to meet all the states of\nItaly with her own forces. The evil, however, which external powers\ncould not effect, was brought about by those within.\nCHAPTER IV\nThe Cerchi and the Donati--Origin of the Bianca and Nera factions\nin Pistoia--They come to Florence--Open enmity of the Donati and the\nCerchi--Their first conflict--The Cerchi head the Bianca faction--The\nDonati take part with the Nera--The pope's legate at Florence increases\nthe confusion with an interdict--New affray between the Cerchi and the\nDonati--The Donati and others of the Nera faction banished by the advice\nof Dante Alighieri--Charles of Valois sent by the pope to Florence--The\nFlorentines suspect him--Corso Donati and the rest of the Nera party\nreturn to Florence--Veri Cerchi flies--The pope's legate again in\nFlorence--The city again interdicted--New disturbances--The Bianchi\nbanished--Dante banished--Corso Donati excites fresh troubles--The\npope's legate endeavors to restore the emigrants but does not\nsucceed--Great fire in Florence.\nThe Cerchi and the Donati were, for riches, nobility, and the number\nand influence of their followers, perhaps the two most distinguished\nfamilies in Florence. Being neighbors, both in the city and the country,\nthere had arisen between them some slight displeasure, which, however,\nhad not occasioned an open quarrel, and perhaps never would have\nproduced any serious effect if the malignant humors had not been\nincreased by new causes. Among the first families of Pistoia was the\nCancellieri. It happened that Lore, son of Gulielmo, and Geri, son of\nBertacca, both of this family, playing together, and coming to words,\nGeri was slightly wounded by Lore. This displeased Gulielmo; and,\ndesigning by a suitable apology to remove all cause of further\nanimosity, he ordered his son to go to the house of the father of the\nyouth whom he had wounded and ask pardon. Lore obeyed his father; but\nthis act of virtue failed to soften the cruel mind of Bertacca, and\nhaving caused Lore to be seized, in order to add the greatest indignity\nto his brutal act, he ordered his servants to chop off the youth's hand\nupon a block used for cutting meat upon, and then said to him, \"Go to\nthy father, and tell him that sword wounds are cured with iron and not\nwith words.\"\nThe unfeeling barbarity of this act so greatly exasperated Gulielmo that\nhe ordered his people to take arms for his revenge. Bertacca prepared\nfor his defense, and not only that family, but the whole city of\nPistoia, became divided. And as the Cancellieri were descended from\na Cancelliere who had had two wives, of whom one was called Bianca\n(white), one party was named by those who were descended from her\nBIANCA; and the other, by way of greater distinction, was called NERA\n(black). Much and long-continued strife took place between the two,\nattended with the death of many men and the destruction of much\nproperty; and not being able to effect a union among themselves, but\nweary of the evil, and anxious either to bring it to an end, or, by\nengaging others in their quarrel, increase it, they came to Florence,\nwhere the Neri, on account of their familiarity with the Donati, were\nfavored by Corso, the head of that family; and on this account the\nBianchi, that they might have a powerful head to defend them against the\nDonati, had recourse to Veri de Cerchi, a man in no respect inferior to\nCorso.\nThis quarrel, and the parties in it, brought from Pistoia, increased the\nold animosity between the Cerchi and the Donati, and it was already\nso manifest, that the Priors and all well-disposed men were in hourly\napprehension of its breaking out, and causing a division of the whole\ncity. They therefore applied to the pontiff, praying that he would\ninterpose his authority between these turbulent parties, and provide the\nremedy which they found themselves unable to furnish. The pope sent\nfor Veri, and charged him to make peace with the Donati, at which Veri\nexhibited great astonishment, saying that he had no enmity against them,\nand that as pacification presupposes war, he did not know, there being\nno war between them, how peacemaking could be necessary. Veri having\nreturned from Rome without anything being effected, the rage of the\nparties increased to such a degree, that any trivial accident seemed\nsufficient to make it burst forth, as indeed presently happened.\nIt was in the month of May, during which, and upon holidays, it is the\ncustom of Florence to hold festivals and public rejoicings throughout\nthe city. Some youths of the Donati family, with their friends, upon\nhorseback, were standing near the church of the Holy Trinity to look\nat a party of ladies who were dancing; thither also came some of the\nCerchi, like the Donati, accompanied with many of the nobility, and,\nnot knowing that the Donati were before them, pushed their horses and\njostled them; thereupon the Donati, thinking themselves insulted, drew\ntheir swords, nor were the Cerchi at all backward to do the same, and\nnot till after the interchange of many wounds, they separated. This\ndisturbance was the beginning of great evils; for the whole city became\ndivided, the people as well as the nobility, and the parties took the\nnames of the Bianchi and the Neri. The Cerchi were at the head of the\nBianchi faction, to which adhered the Adimari, the Abati, a part of the\nTosinghi, of the Bardi, of the Rossi, of the Frescobaldi, of the Nerli,\nand of the Manelli; all the Mozzi, the Scali, Gherardini, Cavalcanti,\nMalespini, Bostichi, Giandonati, Vecchietti, and Arrigucci. To these\nwere joined many families of the people, and all the Ghibellines then\nin Florence, so that their great numbers gave them almost the entire\ngovernment of the city.\nThe Donati, at the head of whom was Corso, joined the Nera party, to\nwhich also adhered those members of the above-named families who did not\ntake part with the Bianchi; and besides these, the whole of the Pazzi,\nthe Bisdomini, Manieri, Bagnesi, Tornaquinci, Spini, Buondelmonti,\nGianfigliazzi, and the Brunelleschi. Nor did the evil confine itself to\nthe city alone, for the whole country was divided upon it, so that the\nCaptains of the Six Parts, and whoever were attached to the Guelphic\nparty or the well-being of the republic, were very much afraid that this\nnew division would occasion the destruction of the city, and give new\nlife to the Ghibelline faction. They, therefore, sent again to Pope\nBoniface, desiring that, unless he wished that city which had always\nbeen the shield of the church should either be ruined or become\nGhibelline, he would consider some means for her relief. The\npontiff thereupon sent to Florence, as his legate, Cardinal Matteo\nd'Acquasparta, a Portuguese, who, finding the Bianchi, as the most\npowerful, the least in fear, not quite submissive to him, he interdicted\nthe city, and left it in anger, so that greater confusion now prevailed\nthan had done previously to his coming.\nThe minds of men being in great excitement, it happened that at a\nfuneral which many of the Donati and the Cerchi attended, they first\ncame to words and then to arms, from which, however, nothing but merely\ntumult resulted at the moment. However, having each retired to their\nhouses, the Cerchi determined to attack the Donati, but, by the valor\nof Corso, they were repulsed and great numbers of them wounded. The city\nwas in arms. The laws and the Signory were set at nought by the rage\nof the nobility, and the best and wisest citizens were full of\napprehension. The Donati and their followers, being the least powerful,\nwere in the greatest fear, and to provide for their safety they called\ntogether Corso, the Captains of the Parts, and the other leaders of the\nNeri, and resolved to apply to the pope to appoint some personage of\nroyal blood, that he might reform Florence; thinking by this means to\novercome the Bianchi. Their meeting and determination became known to\nthe Priors, and the adverse party represented it as a conspiracy against\nthe liberties of the republic. Both parties being in arms, the Signory,\none of whom at that time was the poet Dante, took courage, and from his\nadvice and prudence, caused the people to rise for the preservation of\norder, and being joined by many from the country, they compelled the\nleaders of both parties to lay aside their arms, and banished Corso,\nwith many of the Neri. And as an evidence of the impartiality of their\nmotives, they also banished many of the Bianchi, who, however, soon\nafterward, under pretense of some justifiable cause, returned.\nCorso and his friends, thinking the pope favorable to their party,\nwent to Rome and laid their grievances before him, having previously\nforwarded a statement of them in writing. Charles of Valois, brother of\nthe king of France, was then at the papal court, having been called\ninto Italy by the king of Naples, to go over into Sicily. The pope,\ntherefore, at the earnest prayers of the banished Florentines, consented\nto send Charles to Florence, till the season suitable for his going to\nSicily should arrive. He therefore came, and although the Bianchi,\nwho then governed, were very apprehensive, still, as the head of the\nGuelphs, and appointed by the pope, they did not dare to oppose him, and\nin order to secure his friendship, they gave him authority to dispose of\nthe city as he thought proper.\nThus authorized, Charles armed all his friends and followers, which step\ngave the people so strong a suspicion that he designed to rob them of\ntheir liberty, that each took arms, and kept at his own house, in order\nto be ready, if Charles should make any such attempt. The Cerchi and the\nleaders of the Bianchi faction had acquired universal hatred by having,\nwhile at the head of the republic, conducted themselves with unbecoming\npride; and this induced Corso and the banished of the Neri party to\nreturn to Florence, knowing well that Charles and the Captains of\nthe Parts were favorable to them. And while the citizens, for fear of\nCharles, kept themselves in arms, Corso, with all the banished, and\nfollowed by many others, entered Florence without the least impediment.\nAnd although Veri de Cerchi was advised to oppose him, he refused to do\nso, saying that he wished the people of Florence, against whom he came,\nshould punish him. However, the contrary happened, for he was welcomed,\nnot punished by them; and it behooved Veri to save himself by flight.\nCorso, having forced the Pinti Gate, assembled his party at San Pietro\nMaggiore, near his own house, where, having drawn together a great\nnumber of friends and people desirous of change, he set at liberty\nall who had been imprisoned for offenses, whether against the state\nor against individuals. He compelled the existing Signory to withdraw\nprivately to their own houses, elected a new one from the people of the\nNeri party, and for five days plundered the leaders of the Bianchi. The\nCerchi, and the other heads of their faction, finding Charles opposed\nto them, withdrew from the city, and retired to their strongholds. And\nalthough at first they would not listen to the advice of the pope, they\nwere now compelled to turn to him for assistance, declaring that instead\nof uniting the city, Charles had caused greater disunion than before.\nThe pope again sent Matteo d'Acquasparta, his legate, who made peace\nbetween the Cerchi and the Donati, and strengthened it with marriages\nand new betrothals. But wishing that the Bianchi should participate in\nthe employments of the government, to which the Neri who were then at\nthe head of it would not consent, he withdrew, with no more satisfaction\nnor less enraged than on the former occasion, and left the city\ninterdicted for disobedience.\nBoth parties remained in Florence, and equally discontented; the Neri\nfrom seeing their enemies at hand, and apprehending the loss of their\npower, and the Bianchi from finding themselves without either honor or\nauthority; and to these natural causes of animosity new injuries\nwere added. Niccolo de' Cerchi, with many of his friends, went to his\nestates, and being arrived at the bridge of Affrico, was attacked by\nSimone, son of Corso Donati. The contest was obstinate, and one each\nside had a sorrowful conclusion; for Niccolo was slain, and Simone was\nso severely wounded that he died on the following night.\nThis event again disturbed the entire city; and although the Neri were\nmost to blame, they were defended by those who were at the head of\naffairs; and before sentence was delivered, a conspiracy of the Bianchi\nwith Piero Ferrante, one of the barons who had accompanied Charles,\nwas discovered, by whose assistance they sought to be replaced in the\ngovernment. The matter became known from letters addressed to him by the\nCerchi, although some were of opinion that they were not genuine, but\nwritten and pretended to be found, by the Donati, to abate the infamy\nwhich their party had acquired by the death of Niccolo. The whole of\nthe Cerchi were, however, banished,--with their followers of the Bianchi\nparty, of whom was Dante the poet,--their property confiscated, and\ntheir houses pulled down. They sought refuge, with a great number of\nGhibellines who had joined them, in many places, seeking fresh fortunes\nin new undertakings. Charles, having effected the purpose of his coming,\nleft the city, and returned to the pope to pursue his enterprise against\nSicily, in which he was neither wiser nor more fortunate than he had\nbeen at Florence; so that with disgrace and the loss of many of his\nfollowers, he withdrew to France.\nAfter the departure of Charles, Florence remained quiet. Corso alone was\nrestless, thinking he did not possess that sort of authority in the city\nwhich was due to his rank; for the government being in the hands of the\npeople, he saw the offices of the republic administered by many inferior\nto himself. Moved by passions of this kind, he endeavored, under\nthe pretense of an honorable design, to justify his own dishonorable\npurposes, and accused many citizens who had the management of the public\nmoney, of applying it to their private uses, and recommended that they\nshould be brought to justice and punished. This opinion was adopted by\nmany who had the same views as himself; and many in ignorance joined\nthem, thinking Corso actuated only by pure patriotism. On the other\nhand, the accused citizens, enjoying the popular favor, defended\nthemselves, and this difference arose to such a height, that, after\ncivil means, they had recourse to arms. Of the one party were Corso and\nLottieri, bishop of Florence, with many of the nobility and some of the\npeople; on the other side were the Signory, with the greater part of\nthe people; so that skirmishes took place in many parts of the city. The\nSignory, seeing their danger great, sent for aid to the Lucchese,\nand presently all the people of Lucca were in Florence. With their\nassistance the disturbances were settled for the moment, and the people\nretained the government and their liberty, without attempting by any\nother means to punish the movers of the disorder.\nThe pope had heard of the tumults at Florence, and sent his legate,\nNiccolo da Prato, to settle them, who, being in high reputation both for\nhis quality, learning, and mode of life, presently acquired so much of\nthe people's confidence, that authority was given him to establish such\na government as he should think proper. As he was of Ghibelline origin,\nhe determined to recall the banished; but designing first to gain the\naffections of the lower orders, he renewed the ancient companies of\nthe people, which increased the popular power and reduced that of the\nnobility. The legate, thinking the multitude on his side, now endeavored\nto recall the banished, and, after attempting in many ways, none of\nwhich succeeded, he fell so completely under the suspicion of the\ngovernment, that he was compelled to quit the city, and returned to the\npope in great wrath, leaving Florence full of confusion and suffering\nunder an interdict. Neither was the city disturbed with one division\nalone, but by many; first the enmity between the people and the\nnobility, then that of the Ghibellines and the Guelphs, and lastly, of\nthe Bianchi and the Neri. All the citizens were, therefore, in arms, for\nmany were dissatisfied with the departure of the legate, and wished for\nthe return of the banished. The first who set this disturbance on foot\nwere the Medici and the Guinigi, who, with the legate, had discovered\nthemselves in favor of the rebels; and thus skirmishes took place in\nmany parts of the city.\nIn addition to these evils a fire occurred, which first broke out at the\ngarden of St. Michael, in the houses of the Abati; it thence extended to\nthose of the Capoinsacchi, and consumed them, with those of the Macci,\nAmieri, Toschi, Cipriani, Lamberti, Cavalcanti, and the whole of the New\nMarket; from thence it spread to the gate of St. Maria, and burned it to\nthe ground; turning from the old bridge, it destroyed the houses of the\nGherardini, Pulci, Amidei, and Lucardesi, and with these so many others\nthat the number amounted to seventeen hundred. It was the opinion\nof many that this fire occurred by accident during the heat of the\ndisturbances. Others affirm that it was begun willfully by Neri Abati,\nprior of St. Pietro Scarragio, a dissolute character, fond of mischief,\nwho, seeing the people occupied with the combat, took the opportunity\nof committing a wicked act, for which the citizens, being thus employed,\ncould offer no remedy. And to insure his success, he set fire to the\nhouse of his own brotherhood, where he had the best opportunity of doing\nit. This was in the year 1304, Florence being afflicted both with fire\nand the sword. Corso Donati alone remained unarmed in so many tumults;\nfor he thought he would more easily become the arbitrator between the\ncontending parties when, weary of strife, they should be inclined to\naccommodation. They laid down their arms, however, rather from satiety\nof evil than from any desire of union; and the only consequence was,\nthat the banished were not recalled, and the party which favored them\nremained inferior.\nCHAPTER V\nThe emigrants attempt to re-enter Florence, but are not allowed to do\nso--The companies of the people restored--Restless conduct of\nCorso Donati--The ruin of Corso Donati--Corso Donati accused\nand condemned--Riot at the house of Corso--Death of Corso--His\ncharacter--Fruitless attempt of the Emperor Henry against the\nFlorentines--The emigrants are restored to the city--The citizens place\nthemselves under the king of Naples for five years--War with Uguccione\ndella Faggiuola--The Florentines routed--Florence withdraws herself\nfrom subjection to King Robert, and expels the Count Novello--Lando\nd'Agobbio--His tyranny--His departure.\nThe legate being returned to Rome, and hearing of the new disturbance\nwhich had occurred, persuaded the pope that if he wished to unite the\nFlorentines, it would be necessary to have twelve of the first citizens\nappear before him, and having thus removed the principal causes of\ndisunion, he might easily put a stop to it. The pontiff took this\nadvice, and the citizens, among whom was Corso Donati, obeyed the\nsummons. These having left the city, the legate told the exiles that\nnow, when the city was deprived of her leaders, was the time for them\nto return. They, therefore, having assembled, came to Florence, and\nentering by a part of the wall not yet completed, proceeded to the\npiazza of St. Giovanni. It is worthy of remark, that those who, a short\ntime previously, when they came unarmed and begged to be restored to\ntheir country, had fought for their return, now, when they saw them in\narms and resolved to enter by force, took arms to oppose them (so much\nmore was the common good esteemed than private friendship), and being\njoined by the rest of the citizens, compelled them to return to the\nplaces whence they had come. They failed in their undertaking by having\nleft part of their force at Lastra, and by not having waited the arrival\nof Tolosetto Uberti, who had to come from Pistoia with three hundred\nhorse; for they thought celerity rather than numbers would give them the\nvictory; and it often happens, in similar enterprises, that delay robs\nus of the occasion, and too great anxiety to be forward prevents us of\nthe power, or makes us act before we are properly prepared.\nThe banished having retired, Florence again returned to her old\ndivisions; and in order to deprive the Cavalcanti of their authority,\nthe people took from them the Stinche, a castle situated in the Val\ndi Greve, and anciently belonging to the family. And as those who were\ntaken in it were the first who were put into the new prisons, the latter\nwere, and still continue, named after it,--the Stinche. The leaders of\nthe republic also re-established the companies of the people, and gave\nthem the ensigns that were first used by the companies of the Arts; the\nheads of which were called Gonfaloniers of the companies and colleagues\nof the Signory; and ordered, that when any disturbance arose they should\nassist the Signory with arms, and in peace with counsel. To the two\nancient rectors they added an executor, or sheriff, who, with the\nGonfaloniers, was to aid in repressing the insolence of the nobility.\nIn the meantime the pope died. Corso, with the other citizens, returned\nfrom Rome; and all would have been well if his restless mind had not\noccasioned new troubles. It was his common practice to be of a contrary\nopinion to the most powerful men in the city; and whatever he saw the\npeople inclined to do, he exercised his utmost influence to effect,\nin order to attach them to himself; so that he was a leader in all\ndifferences, at the head of every new scheme, and whoever wished to\nobtain anything extraordinary had recourse to him. This conduct caused\nhim to be hated by many of the highest distinction; and their hatred\nincreased to such a degree that the Neri faction to which he belonged,\nbecame completely divided; for Corso, to attain his ends, had availed\nhimself of private force and authority, and of the enemies of the state.\nBut so great was the influence attached to his person, that everyone\nfeared him. Nevertheless, in order to strip him of the popular favor\n(which by this means may easily be done), a report was set on foot that\nhe intended to make himself prince of the city; and to the design his\nconduct gave great appearance of probability, for his way of living\nquite exceeded all civil bounds; and the opinion gained further\nstrength, upon his taking to wife a daughter of Uguccione della\nFaggiuola, head of the Ghibelline and Bianchi faction, and one of the\nmost powerful men in Tuscany.\nWhen this marriage became known it gave courage to his adversaries, and\nthey took arms against him; for the same reason the people ceased\nto defend him, and the greater part of them joined the ranks of his\nenemies, the leaders of whom were Rosso della Tosa, Pazino dei Pazzi,\nGeri Spini, and Berto Brunelleschi. These, with their followers, and the\ngreater part of the people, assembled before the palace of the Signory,\nby whose command a charge was made before Piero Branca, captain of the\npeople, against Corso, of intending, with the aid of Uguccione, to usurp\nthe government. He was then summoned, and for disobedience, declared\na rebel; nor did two hours pass over between the accusation and the\nsentence. The judgment being given, the Signory, with the companies of\nthe people under their ensigns, went in search of him, who, although\nseeing himself abandoned by many of his followers, aware of the sentence\nagainst him, the power of the Signory, and the multitude of his enemies,\nremained undaunted, and fortified his houses, in the hope of defending\nthem till Uguccione, for whom he had sent, should come to his Relief.\nHis residences, and the streets approaching them, were barricaded and\ntaken possession of by his partisans, who defended them so bravely that\nthe enemy, although in great numbers, could not force them, and the\nbattle became one of the hottest, with wounds and death on all sides.\nBut the people, finding they could not drive them from their ground,\ntook possession of the adjoining houses, and by unobserved passages\nobtained entry. Corso, thus finding himself surrounded by his foes, no\nlonger retaining any hope of assistance from Uguccione, and without a\nchance of victory, thought only of effecting his personal safety, and\nwith Gherardo Bordoni, and some of his bravest and most trusted friends,\nfought a passage through the thickest of their enemies, and effected\ntheir escape from the city by the Gate of the Cross. They were, however,\npursued by vast numbers, and Gherardo was slain upon the bridge of\nAffrico by Boccaccio Cavicciulli. Corso was overtaken and made\nprisoner by a party of Catalan horse, in the service of the Signory, at\nRovezzano. But when approaching Florence, that he might avoid being seen\nand torn to pieces by his victorious enemies, he allowed himself to fall\nfrom horseback, and being down, one of those who conducted him cut his\nthroat. The body was found by the monks of San Salvi, and buried without\nany ceremony due to his rank. Such was the end of Corso, to whom his\ncountry and the Neri faction were indebted for much both of good and\nevil; and if he had possessed a cooler spirit he would have left behind\nhim a more happy memory. Nevertheless, he deserves to be enumerated\namong the most distinguished men our city has produced. True it is, that\nhis restless conduct made both his country and his party forgetful of\ntheir obligation to him. The same cause also produced his miserable\nend, and brought many troubles upon both his friends and his country.\nUguccione, coming to the assistance of his relative, learned at Remoli\nthat Corso had been overcome by the people, and finding that he could\nnot render him any assistance, in order to avoid bringing evil upon\nhimself without occasion, he returned home.\nAfter the death of Corso, which occurred in the year 1308, the\ndisturbances were appeased, and the people lived quietly till it was\nreported that the Emperor Henry was coming into Italy, and with him all\nthe Florentine emigrants, to whom he had promised restoration to their\ncountry. The leaders of the government thought, that in order to lessen\nthe number of their enemies, it would be well to recall, of their own\nwill, all who had been expelled, excepting such as the law had expressly\nforbidden to return. Of the number not admitted, were the greater part\nof the Ghibellines, and some of those of the Bianchi faction, among whom\nwere Dante Alighieri, the sons of Veri de' Cerchi and of Giano della\nBella. Besides this they sent for aid to Robert, king of Naples, and not\nbeing able to obtain it of him as friends, they gave their city to him\nfor five years, that he might defend them as his own people. The emperor\nentered Italy by the way of Pisa, and proceeded by the marshes to Rome,\nwhere he was crowned in the year 1312. Then, having determined to subdue\nthe Florentines, he approached their city by the way of Perugia and\nArezzo, and halted with his army at the monastery of San Salvi, about\na mile from Florence, where he remained fifty days without effecting\nanything. Despairing of success against Florence, he returned to Pisa,\nwhere he entered into an agreement with Frederick, king of Sicily,\nto undertake the conquest of Naples, and proceeded with his people\naccordingly; but while filled with the hope of victory, and carrying\ndismay into the heart of King Robert, having reached Buonconvento, he\ndied.\nShortly after this, Uguccione della Faggiuola, having by means of the\nGhibelline party become lord of Pisa and of Lucca, caused, with the\nassistance of these cities, very serious annoyance to the neighbouring\nplaces. In order to effect their relief the Florentines requested\nKing Robert would allow his brother Piero to take the command of their\narmies. On the other hand, Uguccione continued to increase his power;\nand either by force or fraud obtained possession of many castles in the\nVal d'Arno and the Val di Nievole; and having besieged Monte Cataini,\nthe Florentines found it would be necessary to send to its relief, that\nthey might not see him burn and destroy their whole territory. Having\ndrawn together a large army, they entered the Val di Nievole where they\ncame up with Uguccione, and were routed after a severe battle in which\nPiero the king's brother and 2,000 men were slain; but the body of\nthe Prince was never found. Neither was the victory a joyful one to\nUguccione; for one of his sons, and many of the leaders of his army,\nfell in the strife.\nThe Florentines after this defeat fortified their territory, and King\nRobert sent them, for commander of their forces, the Count d'Andria,\nusually called Count Novello, by whose deportment, or because it is\nnatural to the Florentines to find every state tedious, the city,\nnotwithstanding the war with Uguccione, became divided into friends and\nenemies of the king. Simon della Tosa, the Magalotti, and certain others\nof the people who had attained greater influence in the government than\nthe rest, were leaders of the party against the king. By these means\nmessengers were sent to France, and afterward into Germany, to solicit\nleaders and forces that they might drive out the count, whom the king\nhad appointed governor; but they failed of obtaining any. Nevertheless\nthey did not abandon their undertaking, but still desirous of one whom\nthey might worship, after an unavailing search in France and Germany,\nthey discovered him at Agobbio, and having expelled the Count Novello,\ncaused Lando d'Agobbio to be brought into the city as Bargello (sheriff),\nand gave him the most unlimited power of the citizens. This man was\ncruel and rapacious; and going through the country accompanied with an\narmed force, he put many to death at the mere instigation of those who\nhad endowed him with authority. His insolence rose to such a height,\nthat he stamped base metal with the impression used upon the money of\nthe state, and no one had sufficient courage to oppose him, so powerful\nhad he become by the discords of Florence. Great, certainly, but unhappy\ncity! which neither the memory of past divisions, the fear of her\nenemies, nor a king's authority, could unite for her own advantage; so\nthat she found herself in a state of the utmost wretchedness, harassed\nwithout by Uguccione, and plundered within by Lando d'Agobbio.\nThe friends of the king and those who opposed Lando and his followers,\nwere either of noble families or the highest of the people, and all\nGuelphs; but their adversaries being in power they could not discover\ntheir minds without incurring the greatest danger. Being, however,\ndetermined to deliver themselves from such disgraceful tyranny, they\nsecretly wrote to King Robert, requesting him to appoint for his vicar\nin Florence Count Guido da Battifolle. The king complied; and the\nopposite party, although the Signory were opposed to the king, on\naccount of the good quality of the count, did not dare to resist him.\nStill his authority was not great, because the Signory and Gonfaloniers\nof the companies were in favor of Lando and his party.\nDuring these troubles, the daughter of King Albert of Bohemia passed\nthrough Florence, in search of her husband, Charles, the son of King\nRobert, and was received with the greatest respect by the friends of the\nking, who complained to her of the unhappy state of the city, and of the\ntyranny of Lando and his partisans; so that through her influence and\nthe exertions of the king's friends, the citizens were again united, and\nbefore her departure, Lando was stripped of all authority and send back\nto Agobbio, laden with blood and plunder. In reforming the government,\nthe sovereignty of the city was continued to the king for another three\nyears, and as there were then in office seven Signors of the party\nof Lando, six more were appointed of the king's friends, and some\nmagistracies were composed of thirteen Signors; but not long afterward\nthe number was reduced to seven according to ancient custom.\nCHAPTER VI\nWar with Castruccio--Castruccio marches against Prato and retires\nwithout making any attempt--The emigrants not being allowed to return,\nendeavor to enter the city by force, and are repulsed--Change in\nthe mode of electing the great officers of state--The Squittini\nestablished--The Florentines under Raymond of Cardona are routed\nby Castruccio at Altopascio--Treacherous designs of Raymond--The\nFlorentines give the sovereignty of the city to Charles duke of Cambria,\nwho appoints the duke of Athens for his vicar--The duke of Calabria\ncomes to Florence--The Emperor Louis of Bavaria visits Italy--The\nexcitement he produces--Death of Castruccio and of Charles duke of\nCalabria--Reform of government.\nAbout the same time, Uguccione lost the sovereignty of Lucca and of\nPisa, and Castruccio Castracani, a citizen of Lucca, became lord of\nthem, who, being a young man, bold and fierce, and fortunate in his\nenterprises, in a short time became the head of the Ghibellines in\nTuscany. On this account the discords among the Florentines were\nlaid aside for some years, at first to abate the increasing power\nof Castruccio, and afterward to unite their means for mutual defense\nagainst him. And in order to give increased strength and efficacy to\ntheir counsels, the Signory appointed twelve citizens whom they called\nBuonomini, or good men, without whose advice and consent nothing of\nany importance could be carried into effect. The conclusion of the\nsovereignty of King Robert being come, the citizens took the government\ninto their own hands, reappointed the usual rectors and magistracies,\nand were kept united by the dread of Castruccio, who, after many efforts\nagainst the lords of Lunigiano, attacked Prato, to the relief of which\nthe Florentines having resolved to go, shut up their shops and houses,\nand proceeded thither in a body, amounting to twenty thousand foot and\none thousand five hundred horse. And in order to reduce the number of\nCastruccio's friends and augment their own, the Signory declared that\nevery rebel of the Guelphic party who should come to the relief of Prato\nwould be restored to his country; they thus increased their army with an\naddition of four thousand men. This great force being quickly brought\nto Prato, alarmed Castruccio so much, that without trying the fortune\nof battle, he retired toward Lucca. Upon this, disturbances arose in the\nFlorentine camp between the nobility and the people, the latter of whom\nwished to pursue the foe and destroy him; the former were for returning\nhome, saying they had done enough for Prato in hazarding the safety\nof Florence on its account, which they did not regret under the\ncircumstances, but now, that necessity no longer existing, the propriety\nof further risk ceased also, as there was little to be gained and much\nto lose. Not being able to agree, the question was referred to the\nSignory, among whom the difference of opinion was equally great; and\nas the matter spread throughout the city, the people drew together, and\nused such threatening language against the nobility that they, being\napprehensive for their safety, yielded; but the resolution being adopted\ntoo late, and by many unwillingly, gave the enemy time to withdraw in\nsafety to Lucca.\nThis unfortunate circumstance made the people so indignant against\nthe great that the Signory refused to perform the promise made to\nthe exiles, and the latter, anticipating the fact, determined to be\nbeforehand, and were at the gates of Florence to gain admittance into\nthe city before the rest of the forces; but their design did not take\neffect, for their purpose being foreseen, they were repulsed by those\nwho had remained at home. They then endeavored to acquire by entreaty\nwhat they had failed to obtain by force; and sent eight men as\nambassadors to the Signory, to remind them of the promise given, and\nof the dangers they had undergone, in hope of the reward which had been\nheld out to them. And although the nobility, who felt the obligation on\naccount of their having particularly undertaken to fulfill the promise\nfor which the Signory had bound themselves, used their utmost exertion\nin favor of the exiles, so great was the anger of the multitude on\naccount of their only partial success against Castruccio, that they\ncould not obtain their admission. This occasioned cost and dishonor to\nthe city; for many of the nobility, taking offense at this proceeding,\nendeavored to obtain by arms that which had been refused to their\nprayers, and agreed with the exiles that they should come armed to the\ncity, and that those within would arm themselves in their defense. But\nthe affair was discovered before the appointed day arrived, so that\nthose without found the city in arms, and prepared to resist them. So\ncompletely subdued were those within, that none dared to take arms; and\nthus the undertaking was abandoned, without any advantage having\nbeen obtained by the party. After the departure of the exiles it was\ndetermined to punish those who had been instrumental in bringing them\nto the city; but, although everyone knew who were the delinquents,\nnone ventured to name and still less to accuse them. It was, therefore,\nresolved that in order to come at the truth, everyone should write\nthe names of those he believed to be guilty, and present the writing\nsecretly to the Capitano. By this means, Amerigo Donati, Teghiajo,\nFrescobaldi, and Lotteringo Gherardini were accused; but, the judges\nbeing more favorably disposed to them than, perhaps, their misdeeds\ndeserved, each escaped by paying a fine.\nThe tumults which arose in Florence from the coming of the rebels to the\ngates, showed that one leader was insufficient for the companies of\nthe people; they, therefore, determined that in future each should have\nthree or four; and to every Gonfalonier two or three Pennonieri (pennon\nbearers) were added, so that if the whole body were not drawn out, a\npart might operate under one of them. And as happens in republics, after\nany disturbance, some old laws are annulled and others renewed, so\non this occasion, as it had been previously customary to appoint the\nSignory for a time only, the then existing Signors and the Colleagues,\nfeeling themselves possessed of sufficient power, assumed the authority\nto fix upon the Signors that would have to sit during the next forty\nmonths, by putting their names into a bag or purse, and drawing them\nevery two months. But, before the expiration of the forty months, many\ncitizens were jealous that their names had not been deposited among\nthe rest, and a new emborsation was made. From this beginning arose the\ncustom of emborsing or enclosing the names of all who should take office\nin any of the magistracies for a long time to come, as well those whose\noffices employed them within the city as those abroad, though previously\nthe councils of the retiring magistrates had elected those who were to\nsucceed them. These emborsations were afterward called Squittini, or\npollings,--and it was thought they would prevent much trouble to the\ncity, and remove the cause of those tumults which every three, or at\nmost five, years, took place upon the creation of magistrates, from the\nnumber of candidates for office. And not being able to adopt a better\nexpedient, they made use of this, but did not observe the defects which\nlay concealed under such a trivial accommodation.\nIn 1325, Castruccio, having taken possession of Pistoia, became so\npowerful that the Florentines, fearing his greatness, resolved, before\nhe should get himself firmly seated in his new conquest, to attack him\nand withdraw it from his authority. Of their citizens and friends they\nmustered an army amounting to 20,000 foot and 3,000 horse, and with this\nbody encamped before Altopascio, with the intention of taking the place\nand thus preventing it from relieving Pistoia. Being successful in the\nfirst part of their design, they marched toward Lucca, and laid the\ncountry waste in their progress; but from the little prudence and less\nintegrity of their leader, Ramondo di Cardona, they made but small\nprogress; for he, having observed them upon former occasions very\nprodigal of their liberty, placing it sometimes in the hands of a king,\nat others in those of a legate, or persons of even inferior quality,\nthought, if he could bring them into some difficulty, it might easily\nhappen that they would make him their prince. Nor did he fail frequently\nto mention these matters, and required to have that authority in the\ncity which had been given him over the army, endeavoring to show that\notherwise he could not enforce the obedience requisite to a leader. As\nthe Florentines did not consent to this, he wasted time, and allowed\nCastruccio to obtain the assistance which the Visconti and other tyrants\nof Lombardy had promised him, and thus become very strong. Ramondo,\nhaving willfully let the opportunity of victory pass away, now\nfound himself unable to escape; for Castruccio coming up with him at\nAltopascio, a great battle ensued in which many citizens were slain and\ntaken prisoners, and among the former fell Ramondo, who received from\nfortune that reward of bad faith and mischievous counsels which he had\nrichly deserved from the Florentines. The injury they suffered from\nCastruccio, after the battle, in plunder, prisoners, destruction,\nand burning of property, is quite indescribable; for, without any\nopposition, during many months, he led his predatory forces wherever he\nthought proper, and it seemed sufficient to the Florentines if, after\nsuch a terrible event, they could save their city.\nStill they were not so absolutely cast down as to prevent them from\nraising great sums of money, hiring troops, and sending to their friends\nfor assistance; but all they could do was insufficient to restrain such\na powerful enemy; so that they were obliged to offer the sovereignty to\nCharles duke of Calabria, son of King Robert, if they could induce him\nto come to their defense; for these princes, being accustomed to rule\nFlorence, preferred her obedience to her friendship. But Charles, being\nengaged in the wars of Sicily, and therefore unable to undertake the\nsovereignty of the city, sent in his stead Walter, by birth a Frenchman,\nand duke of Athens. He, as viceroy, took possession of the city, and\nappointed the magistracies according to his own pleasure; but his mode\nof proceeding was quite correct, and so completely contrary to his real\nnature, that everyone respected him.\nThe affairs of Sicily being composed, Charles came to Florence with a\nthousand horse. He made his entry into the city in July, 1326, and\nhis coming prevented further pillage of the Florentine territory by\nCastruccio. However, the influence which they acquired without the city\nwas lost within her walls, and the evils which they did not suffer from\ntheir enemies were brought upon them by their friends; for the Signory\ncould not do anything without the consent of the duke of Calabria,\nwho, in the course of one year, drew from the people 400,000 florins,\nalthough by the agreement entered into with him, the sum was not to\nexceed 200,000; so great were the burdens with which either himself or\nhis father constantly oppressed them.\nTo these troubles were added new jealousies and new enemies; for the\nGhibellines of Lombardy became so alarmed upon the arrival of Charles in\nTuscany, that Galeazzo Visconti and the other Lombard tyrants, by money\nand promises, induced Louis of Bavaria, who had lately been elected\nemperor contrary to the wish of the pope, to come into Italy. After\npassing through Lombardy he entered Tuscany, and with the assistance\nof Castruccio, made himself master of Pisa, from whence, having been\npacified with sums of money, he directed his course towards Rome. This\ncaused the duke of Calabria to be apprehensive for the safety of Naples;\nhe therefore left Florence, and appointed as his viceroy Filippo da\nSaggineto.\nAfter the departure of the emperor, Castruccio made himself master of\nPisa, but the Florentines, by a treaty with Pistoia, withdrew her from\nobedience to him. Castruccio then besieged Pistoia, and persevered\nwith so much vigor and resolution, that although the Florentines often\nattempted to relieve her, by attacking first his army and then his\ncountry, they were unable either by force or policy to remove him; so\nanxious was he to punish the Pistolesi and subdue the Florentines. At\nlength the people of Pistoia were compelled to receive him for their\nsovereign; but this event, although greatly to his glory, proved but\nlittle to his advantage, for upon his return to Lucca he died. And as\none event either of good or evil seldom comes alone, at Naples also died\nCharles duke of Calabria and lord of Florence, so that in a short time,\nbeyond the expectation of their most sanguine hopes, the Florentines\nfound themselves delivered from the domination of the one and the fear\nof the other. Being again free, they set about the reformation of the\ncity, annulled all the old councils, and created two new ones, the one\ncomposed of 300 citizens from the class of the people, the other of 250\nfrom the nobility and the people.\nThe first was called the Council of the People, the other the Council of\nthe Commune.\nCHAPTER VII\nThe Emperor at Rome--The Florentines refuse to purchase Lucca, and\nrepent of it--Enterprises of the Florentines--Conspiracy of the Bardi\nand the Frescobaldi--The conspiracy discovered and checked--Maffeo da\nMarradi appeases the tumult--Lucca is purchased by the Florentines\nand taken by the Pisans--The duke of Athens at Florence--The nobility\ndetermine to make him prince of the city.\nThe emperor, being arrived at Rome, created an anti-pope, did many\nthings in opposition to the church, and attempted many others, but\nwithout effect, so that at last he retired with disgrace, and went to\nPisa, where, either because they were not paid, or from disaffection,\nabout 800 German horse mutinied, and fortified themselves at Montechiaro\nupon the Ceruglio; and when the emperor had left Pisa to go into\nLombardy, they took possession of Lucca and drove out Francesco\nCastracani, whom he had left there. Designing to turn their conquest to\naccount, they offered it to the Florentines for 80,000 florins, which,\nby the advice of Simone della Tosa, was refused. This resolution, if\nthey had remained in it, would have been of the greatest utility to\nthe Florentines; but as they shortly afterward changed their minds,\nit became most pernicious; for although at the time they might have\nobtained peaceful possession of her for a small sum and would not,\nthey afterward wished to have her and could not, even for a much larger\namount; which caused many and most hurtful changes to take place in\nFlorence. Lucca, being refused by the Florentines, was purchased by\nGherardino Spinoli, a Genoese, for 30,000 florins. And as men are often\nless anxious to take what is in their power than desirous of that which\nthey cannot attain, as soon as the purchase of Gherardino became known,\nand for how small a sum it had been bought, the people of Florence were\nseized with an extreme desire to have it, blaming themselves and those\nby whose advice they had been induced to reject the offer made to them.\nAnd in order to obtain by force what they had refused to purchase, they\nsent troops to plunder and overrun the country of the Lucchese.\nAbout this time the emperor left Italy. The anti-pope, by means of the\nPisans, became a prisoner in France; and the Florentines from the death\nof Castruccio, which occurred in 1328, remained in domestic peace till\n1340, and gave their undivided attention to external affairs, while many\nwars were carried on in Lombardy, occasioned by the coming of John king\nof Bohemia, and in Tuscany, on account of Lucca. During this period\nFlorence was ornamented with many new buildings, and by the advice of\nGiotto, the most distinguished painter of his time, they built the tower\nof Santa Reparata. Besides this, the waters of the Arno having, in 1333,\nrisen twelve feet above their ordinary level, destroyed some of the\nbridges and many buildings, all which were restored with great care and\nexpense.\nIn the year 1340, new sources of disagreement arose. The great had two\nways of increasing or preserving their power; the one, so to restrain\nthe emborsation of magistrates, that the lot always fell upon themselves\nor their friends; the other, that having the election of the rectors,\nthey were always favorable to their party. This second mode they\nconsidered of so great importance, that the ordinary rectors not being\nsufficient for them, they on some occasions elected a third, and at\nthis time they had made an extraordinary appointment, under the title\nof captain of the guard, of Jacopo Gabrielli of Agobbio, and endowed him\nwith unlimited authority over the citizens. This man, under the sanction\nof those who governed, committed constant outrages; and among those whom\nhe injured were Piero de' Bardi and Bardo Frescobaldi. These being of\nthe nobility, and naturally proud, could not endure that a stranger,\nsupported by a few powerful men, should without cause injure them with\nimpunity, and consequently entered into a conspiracy against him and\nthose by whom he was supported. They were joined by many noble families,\nand some of the people, who were offended with the tyranny of those in\npower. Their plan was, that each should bring into his house a number of\narmed men, and on the morning after the day of All Saints, when almost\nall would be in the temples praying for their dead, they should take\narms, kill the Capitano and those who were at the head of affairs, and\nthen, with a new Signory and new ordinances, reform the government.\nBut, as the more a dangerous business is considered, the less willingly\nit is undertaken, it commonly happens, when there is any time allowed\nbetween the determining upon a perilous enterprise and its execution,\nthat the conspiracy by one means or another becomes known. Andrea de'\nBardi was one of the conspirators, and upon reconsideration of the\nmatter, the fear of the punishment operated more powerfully upon him\nthan the desire of revenge, and he disclosed the affair to Jacopo\nAlberti, his brother-in-law. Jacopo acquainted the Priors, and they\ninformed the government. And as the danger was near, All Saints' day\nbeing just at hand, many citizens met together in the palace; and\nthinking their peril increased by delay, they insisted that the Signory\nshould order the alarm to be rung, and called the people together in\narms. Taldo Valori was at this time Gonfalonier, and Francesco Salviati\none of the Signory, who, being relatives of the Bardi, were unwilling to\nsummon the people with the bell, alleging as a reason that it is by\nno means well to assemble them in arms upon every slight occasion,\nfor power put into the hands of an unrestrained multitude was never\nbeneficial; that it is an easy matter to excite them to violence, but\na difficult thing to restrain them; and that, therefore, it would be\ntaking a more prudent course if they were to inquire into the truth of\nthe affair, and punish the delinquents by the civil authority, than to\nattempt, upon a simple information, to correct it by such a tumultuous\nmeans, and thus hazard the safety of the city. None would listen to\nthese remarks; the Signory were assailed with insolent behavior and\nindecent expressions, and compelled to sound the alarm, upon which the\npeople presently assembled in arms. On the other hand, the Bardi and the\nFrescobaldi, finding themselves discovered, that they might conquer\nwith glory or die without shame, armed themselves, in the hope that they\nwould be able to defend that part of the city beyond the river, where\ntheir houses were situated; and they fortified the bridge in expectation\nof assistance, which they expected from the nobles and their friends in\nthe country. Their design was frustrated by the people who, in common\nwith themselves, occupied this part of the city; for these took arms\nin favor of the Signory, so that, seeing themselves thus circumstanced,\nthey abandoned the bridges, and betook themselves to the street in which\nthe Bardi resided, as being a stronger situation than any other; and\nthis they defended with great bravery.\nJacopo d'Agobbio, knowing the whole conspiracy was directed against\nhimself, in fear of death, terrified and vanquished, kept himself\nsurrounded with forces near the palace of the Signory; but the other\nrectors, who were much less blamable, discovered greater courage, and\nespecially the podesta or provost, whose name was Maffeo da Marradi. He\npresented himself among the combatants without any fear, and passing the\nbridge of the Rubaconte amid the swords of the Bardi, made a sign that\nhe wished to speak to them. Upon this, their reverence for the man, his\nnoble demeanor, and the excellent qualities he was known to possess,\ncaused an immediate cessation of the combat, and induced them to listen\nto him patiently. He very gravely, but without the use of any bitter or\naggravating expressions, blamed their conspiracy, showed the danger they\nwould incur if they still contended against the popular feeling, gave\nthem reason to hope their complaints would be heard and mercifully\nconsidered, and promised that he himself would use his endeavors in\ntheir behalf. He then returned to the Signory, and implored them to\nspare the blood of the citizens, showing the impropriety of judging them\nunheard, and at length induced them to consent that the Bardi and the\nFrescobaldi, with their friends, should leave the city, and without\nimpediment be allowed to retire to their castles. Upon their departure\nthe people being again disarmed, the Signory proceeded against those\nonly of the Bardi and Frescobaldi families who had taken arms. To lessen\ntheir power, they bought of the Bardi the castle of Mangona and that\nof Vernia; and enacted a law which provided that no citizen should be\nallowed to possess a castle or fortified place within twenty miles of\nFlorence.\nAfter a few months, Stiatta Frescobaldi was beheaded, and many of his\nfamily banished. Those who governed, not satisfied with having subdued\nthe Bardi and the Frescobaldi, as is most commonly the case, the more\nauthority they possessed the worse use they made of it and the more\ninsolent they became. As they had hitherto had one captain of the guard\nwho afflicted the city, they now appointed another for the country, with\nunlimited authority, to the end that those whom they suspected might\nabide neither within nor without. And they excited them to such\nexcesses against the whole of the nobility, that these were driven to\ndesperation, and ready to sell both themselves and the city to obtain\nrevenge. The occasion at length came, and they did not fail to use it.\nThe troubles of Tuscany and Lombardy had brought the city of Lucca under\nthe rule of Mastino della Scala, lord of Verona, who, though bound by\ncontract to assign her to the Florentines, had refused to do so; for,\nbeing lord of Parma, he thought he should be able to retain her, and did\nnot trouble himself about his breach of faith. Upon this the Florentines\njoined the Venetians, and with their assistance brought Mastino to\nthe brink of ruin. They did not, however, derive any benefit from\nthis beyond the slight satisfaction of having conquered him; for the\nVenetians, like all who enter into league with less powerful states than\nthemselves, having acquired Trevigi and Vicenza, made peace with Mastino\nwithout the least regard for the Florentines. Shortly after this, the\nVisconti, lords of Milan, having taken Parma from Mastino, he found\nhimself unable to retain Lucca, and therefore determined to sell it. The\ncompetitors for the purchase were the Florentines and the Pisans; and in\nthe course of the treaty the Pisans, finding that the Florentines, being\nthe richer people, were about to obtain it, had recourse to arms,\nand, with the assistance of the Visconti, marched against Lucca. The\nFlorentines did not, on that account, withdraw from the purchase, but\nhaving agreed upon the terms with Mastino, paid part of the money,\ngave security for the remainder, and sent Naddo Rucellai, Giovanni\ndi Bernadino de' Medici, and Rosso di Ricciardo de' Ricci, to take\npossession, who entered Lucca by force, and Mastino's people delivered\nthe city to them. Nevertheless, the Pisans continued the siege, and the\nFlorentines used their utmost endeavors to relieve her; but after a long\nwar, loss of money, and accumulation of disgrace, they were compelled to\nretire, and the Pisans became lords of Lucca.\nThe loss of this city, as in like cases commonly happens, exasperated\nthe people of Florence against the members of the government; at every\nstreet corner and public place they were openly censured, and the entire\nmisfortune was laid to the charge of their greediness and mismanagement.\nAt the beginning of the war, twenty citizens had been appointed to\nundertake the direction of it, who appointed Malatesta da Rimini to\nthe command of the forces. He having exhibited little zeal and less\nprudence, they requested assistance from Robert king of Naples, and he\nsent them Walter duke of Athens, who, as Providence would have it,\nto bring about the approaching evils, arrived at Florence just at the\nmoment when the undertaking against Lucca had entirely failed. Upon this\nthe Twenty, seeing the anger of the people, thought to inspire them with\nfresh hopes by the appointment of a new leader, and thus remove, or at\nleast abate, the causes of calumny against themselves. As there was much\nto be feared, and that the duke of Athens might have greater authority\nto defend them, they first chose him for their coadjutor, and then\nappointed him to the command of the army. The nobility, who were\ndiscontented from the causes above mentioned, having many of them been\nacquainted with Walter, when upon a former occasion he had governed\nFlorence for the duke of Calabria, thought they had now an opportunity,\nthough with the ruin of the city, of subduing their enemies; for there\nwas no means of prevailing against those who had oppressed them but of\nsubmitting to the authority of a prince who, being acquainted with the\nworth of one party and the insolence of the other, would restrain the\nlatter and reward the former. To this they added a hope of the benefits\nthey might derive from him when he had acquired the principality by\ntheir means. They, therefore, took several occasions of being with him\nsecretly, and entreated he would take the command wholly upon himself,\noffering him the utmost assistance in their power. To their influence\nand entreaty were also added those of some families of the people; these\nwere the Peruzzi, Acciajuoli, Antellesi, and Buonaccorsi, who, being\noverwhelmed with debts, and without means of their own, wished for those\nof others to liquidate them, and, by the slavery of their country,\nto deliver themselves from their servitude to their creditors. These\ndemonstrations excited the ambitious mind of the duke to greater desire\nof dominion, and in order to gain himself the reputation of strict\nequity and justice, and thus increase his favor with the plebeians, he\nprosecuted those who had conducted the war against Lucca, condemned many\nto pay fines, others to exile, and put to death Giovanni de' Medici,\nNaddo Rucellai, and Guglielmo Altoviti.\nCHAPTER VIII\nThe Duke of Athens requires to be made prince of Florence--The Signory\naddress the duke upon the subject--The plebeians proclaim him prince\nof Florence for life--Tyrannical proceedings of the duke--The city\ndisgusted with him--Conspiracies against the duke--The duke discovers\nthe conspiracies, and becomes terrified--The city rises against him--He\nis besieged in the palace--Measures adopted by the citizens for\nreform of the government--The duke is compelled to withdraw from the\ncity--Miserable deaths of Guglielmo da Scesi and his son--Departure of\nthe duke of Athens--His character.\nThese executions greatly terrified the middle class of citizens, but\ngave satisfaction to the great and to the plebeians;--to the latter,\nbecause it is their nature to delight in evil; and to the former, by\nthus seeing themselves avenged of the many wrongs they had suffered from\nthe people. When the duke passed along the streets he was hailed with\nloud cheers, the boldness of his proceedings was praised, and both\nparties joined in open entreaties that he would search out the faults of\nthe citizens, and punish them.\nThe office of the Twenty began to fall into disuse, while the power\nof the duke became great, and the influence of fear excessive; so that\neveryone, in order to appear friendly to him, caused his arms to be\npainted over their houses, and the name alone was all he needed to be\nabsolutely prince. Thinking himself upon such a footing that he might\nsafely attempt anything, he gave the Signory to understand that he\njudged it necessary for the good of the city, that the sovereignty\nshould be freely given to him, and that as the rest of the citizens were\nwilling that it should be so, he desired they would also consent. The\nSignory, notwithstanding many had foreseen the ruin of their country,\nwere much disturbed at this demand; and although they were aware of the\ndangerous position in which they stood, that they might not be wanting\nin their duty, resolutely refused to comply. The duke had, in order to\nassume a greater appearance of religion and humanity, chosen for his\nresidence the convent of the Minor Canons of St. Croce, and in order\nto carry his evil designs into effect, proclaimed that all the people\nshould, on the following morning, present themselves before him in the\npiazza of the convent. This command alarmed the Signory much more than\nhis discourse to them had done, and they consulted with those citizens\nwhom they thought most attached to their country and to liberty; but\nthey could not devise any better plan, knowing the power of which the\nduke was possessed, than to endeavor by entreaty to induce him either to\nforego his design or to make his government less intolerable. A party of\nthem was, therefore, appointed to wait upon him, one of whom addressed\nhim in the following manner:--\n\"We appear before you, my lord, induced first by the demand which you\nhave made, and then by the orders you have given for a meeting of the\npeople; for it appears to us very clearly, that it is your intention\nto effect by extraordinary means the design from which we have hitherto\nwithheld our consent. It is not, however, our intention to oppose you\nwith force, but only to show what a heavy charge you take upon yourself,\nand the dangerous course you adopt; to the end that you may remember our\nadvice and that of those who, not by consideration of what is beneficial\nfor you, but for the gratification of their own unreasonable wishes,\nhave advised you differently. You are endeavoring to reduce to slavery a\ncity that has always existed in freedom; for the authority which we\nhave at times conceded to the kings of Naples was companionship and\nnot servitude. Have you considered the mighty things which the name\nof liberty implies to such a city as this, and how delightful it is to\nthose who hear it? It has a power which nothing can subdue, time cannot\nwear away, nor can any degree of merit in a prince countervail the loss\nof it. Consider, my lord, how great the force must be that can keep a\ncity like this in subjection, no foreign aid would enable you to do it;\nneither can you confide in those at home; for they who are at present\nyour friends, and advise you to adopt the course you now pursue, as soon\nas with your assistance they have overcome their enemies, will at once\nturn their thoughts toward effecting your destruction, and then take\nthe government upon themselves. The plebeians, in whom you confide, will\nchange upon any accident, however trivial; so that in a very short time\nyou may expect to see the whole city opposed to you, which will produce\nboth their ruin and your own. Nor will you be able to find any remedy\nfor this; for princes who have but few enemies may make their government\nvery secure by the death or banishment of those who are opposed to them;\nbut when the hatred is universal, no security whatever can be found, for\nyou cannot tell from what direction the evil may commence; and he who\nhas to apprehend every man his enemy cannot make himself assured of\nanyone. And if you should attempt to secure a friend or two, you would\nonly increase the dangers of your situation; for the hatred of the\nrest would be increased by your success, and they would become more\nresolutely disposed to vengeance.\n\"That time can neither destroy nor abate the desire for freedom is most\ncertain; for it has been often observed, that those have reassumed their\nliberty who in their own persons had never tasted of its charms, and\nlove it only from remembrance of what they have heard their fathers\nrelate; and, therefore, when recovered, have preserved it with\nindomitable resolution and at every hazard. And even when their\nfathers could not remember it, the public buildings, the halls of the\nmagistracy, and the insignia of free institutions, remind them of it;\nand these things cannot fail to be known and greatly desired by every\nclass of citizens.\n\"What is it you imagine you can do, that would be an equivalent for\nthe sweets of liberty, or make men lose the desire of their present\nconditions? No; if you were to join the whole of Tuscany to the\nFlorentine rule, if you were to return to the city daily in triumph\nover her enemies, what could it avail? The glory would not be ours,\nbut yours. We should not acquire fellow-citizens, but partakers of our\nbondage, who would serve to sink us still deeper in ignominy. And if\nyour conduct were in every respect upright, your demeanor amiable, and\nyour judgments equitable, all these would be insufficient to make you\nbeloved. If you imagine otherwise, you deceive yourself; for, to one\naccustomed to the enjoyment of liberty, the slightest chains feel\nheavy, and every tie upon his free soul oppresses him. Besides, it is\nimpossible to find a violent people associated with a good prince, for\nof necessity they must soon become alike, or their difference produce\nthe ruin of one of them. You may, therefore, be assured, that you\nwill either have to hold this city by force, to effect which, guards,\ncastles, and external aid have oft been found insufficient, or be\ncontent with the authority we have conferred; and this we would advise,\nreminding you that no dominion can be durable to which the governed do\nnot consent; and we have no wish to lead you, blinded by ambition, to\nsuch a point that, unable either to stand or advance, you must, to the\ngreat injury of both, of necessity fall.\"\nThis discourse did not in the slightest degree soften the obdurate mind\nof the duke, who replied that it was not his intention to rob the city\nof her liberty, but to restore it to her; for those cities alone are in\nslavery that are disunited, while the united are free. As Florence, by\nher factions and ambition, had deprived herself of liberty, he should\nrestore, not take it from her; and as he had been induced to take this\ncharge upon himself, not from his own ambition, but at the entreaty of\na great number of citizens, they would do well to be satisfied with that\nwhich produced contentment among the rest. With regard to the danger he\nmight incur, he thought nothing of it; for it was not the part of a good\nman to avoid doing good from his apprehension of evil, and it was the\npart of a coward to shun a glorious undertaking because some uncertainty\nattended the success of the attempt; and he knew he should so\nconduct himself, that they would soon see they had entertained great\napprehensions and been in little danger.\nThe Signory then agreed, finding they could not do better, that on the\nfollowing morning the people should be assembled in their accustomed\nplace of meeting, and with their consent the Signory should confer\nupon the duke the sovereignty of the city for one year, on the same\nconditions as it had been intrusted to the duke of Calabria. It was upon\nthe 8th of November, 1342, when the duke, accompanied by Giovanni della\nTosa and all his confederates, with many other citizens, came to the\npiazza or court of the palace, and having, with the Signory mounted upon\nthe ringhiera, or rostrum (as the Florentines call those steps which\nlead to the palace), the agreement which had been entered into between\nthe Signory and himself was read. When they had come to the passage\nwhich gave the government to him for one year, the people shouted, \"FOR\nLIFE.\" Upon this, Francesco Rustichelli, one of the Signory, arose to\nspeak, and endeavored to abate the tumult and procure a hearing; but the\nmob, with their hootings, prevented him from being heard by anyone; so\nthat with the consent of the people the duke was elected, not for one\nyear merely, but for life. He was then borne through the piazza by the\ncrowd, shouting his name as they proceeded.\nIt is the custom that he who is appointed to the guard of the palace\nshall, in the absence of the Signory, remain locked within. This office\nwas at that time held by Rinieri di Giotto, who, bribed by the friends\nof the duke, without waiting for any force, admitted him immediately.\nThe Signory, terrified and dishonored, retired to their own houses; the\npalace was plundered by the followers of the duke, the Gonfalon of the\npeople torn to pieces, and the arms of the duke placed over the palace.\nAll this happened to the indescribable sorrow of good men, though to\nthe satisfaction of those who, either from ignorance or malignity, were\nconsenting parties.\nThe duke, having acquired the sovereignty of the city, in order to strip\nthose of all authority who had been defenders of her liberty, forbade\nthe Signory to assemble in the palace, and appointed a private dwelling\nfor their use. He took their colors from the Gonfaloniers of the\ncompanies of the people; abolished the ordinances made for the restraint\nof the great; set at liberty those who were imprisoned; recalled the\nBardi and the Frescobaldi from exile, and forbade everyone from carrying\narms about his person. In order the better to defend himself against\nthose within the city, he made friends of all he could around it, and\ntherefore conferred great benefits upon the Aretini and other subjects\nof the Florentines. He made peace with the Pisans, although raised to\npower in order that he might carry on war against them; ceased paying\ninterest to those merchants who, during the war against Lucca, had lent\nmoney to the republic; increased the old taxes, levied new ones, and\ntook from the Signory all authority. His rectors were Baglione da\nPerugia and Guglielmo da Scesi, who, with Cerrettieri Bisdomini,\nwere the persons with whom he consulted on public affairs. He imposed\nburdensome taxes upon the citizens; his decisions between contending\nparties were unjust; and that precision and humanity which he had at\nfirst assumed, became cruelty and pride; so that many of the greatest\ncitizens and noblest people were, either by fines, death, or some new\ninvention, grievously oppressed. And in completing the same bad system,\nboth without the city and within, he appointed six rectors for the\ncountry, who beat and plundered the inhabitants. He suspected the great,\nalthough he had been benefited by them, and had restored many to their\ncountry; for he felt assured that the generous minds of the nobility\nwould not allow them, from any motives, to submit contentedly to his\nauthority. He also began to confer benefits and advantages upon the\nlowest orders, thinking that with their assistance, and the arms of\nforeigners, he would be able to preserve the tyranny. The month of May,\nduring which feasts are held, being come, he caused many companies to\nbe formed of the plebeians and very lowest of the people, and to these,\ndignified with splendid titles, he gave colors and money; and while\none party went in bacchanalian procession through the city, others were\nstationed in different parts of it, to receive them as guests. As the\nreport of the duke's authority spread abroad, many of French origin came\nto him, for all of whom he found offices and emoluments, as if they\nhad been the most trustworthy of men; so that in a short time Florence\nbecame not only subject to French dominion, but adopted their dress\nand manners; for men and women, without regard to propriety or sense\nof shame, imitated them. But that which disgusted the people most\ncompletely was the violence which, without any distinction of quality or\nrank, he and his followers committed upon the women.\nThe people were filled with indignation, seeing the majesty of the state\noverturned, its ordinances annihilated, its laws annulled, and every\ndecent regulation set at naught; for men unaccustomed to royal pomp\ncould not endure to see this man surrounded with his armed satellites on\nfoot and on horseback; and having now a closer view of their disgrace,\nthey were compelled to honor him whom they in the highest degree\nhated. To this hatred, was added the terror occasioned by the continual\nimposition of new taxes and frequent shedding of blood, with which he\nimpoverished and consumed the city.\nThe duke was not unaware of these impressions existing strongly in the\npeople's minds, nor was he without fear of the consequences; but still\npretended to think himself beloved; and when Matteo di Morozzo, either\nto acquire his favor or to free himself from danger, gave information\nthat the family of the Medici and some others had entered into a\nconspiracy against him he not only did not inquire into the matter, but\ncaused the informer to be put to a cruel death. This mode of proceeding\nrestrained those who were disposed to acquaint him of his danger and\ngave additional courage to such as sought his ruin. Bertone Cini, having\nventured to speak against the taxes with which the people were loaded,\nhad his tongue cut out with such barbarous cruelty as to cause his\ndeath. This shocking act increased the people's rage, and their hatred\nof the duke; for those who were accustomed to discourse and to act upon\nevery occasion with the greatest boldness, could not endure to live with\ntheir hands tied and forbidden to speak.\nThis oppression increased to such a degree, that not merely the\nFlorentines, who though unable to preserve their liberty cannot endure\nslavery, but the most servile people on earth would have been roused to\nattempt the recovery of freedom; and consequently many citizens of all\nranks resolved either to deliver themselves from this odious tyranny or\ndie in the attempt. Three distinct conspiracies were formed; one of the\ngreat; another of the people, and the third of the working classes; each\nof which, besides the general causes which operated upon the whole, were\nexcited by some other particular grievance. The great found themselves\ndeprived of all participation in the government; the people had lost the\npower they possessed, and the artificers saw themselves deficient in the\nusual remuneration of their labor.\nAgnolo Acciajuoli was at this time archbishop of Florence, and by his\ndiscourses had formerly greatly favored the duke, and procured him many\nfollowers among the higher class of the people. But when he found him\nlord of the city, and became acquainted with his tyrannical mode of\nproceeding, it appeared to him that he had misled his countrymen; and to\ncorrect the evil he had done, he saw no other course, but to attempt the\ncure by the means which had caused it. He therefore became the leader\nof the first and most powerful conspiracy, and was joined by the Bardi,\nRossi, Frescobaldi, Scali Altoviti, Magalotti, Strozzi, and Mancini. Of\nthe second, the principals were Manno and Corso Donati, and with them\nthe Pazzi, Cavicciulli, Cerchi, and Albizzi. Of the third the first\nwas Antonio Adimari, and with him the Medici, Bordini, Rucellai, and\nAldobrandini. It was the intention of these last, to slay him in the\nhouse of the Albizzi, whither he was expected to go on St. John's day,\nto see the horses run, but he not having gone, their design did not\nsucceed. They then resolved to attack him as he rode through the\ncity; but they found this would be very difficult; for he was always\naccompanied with a considerable armed force, and never took the same\nroad twice together, so that they had no certainty of where to find him.\nThey had a design of slaying him in the council, although they knew that\nif he were dead, they would be at the mercy of his followers.\nWhile these matters were being considered by the conspirators, Antonio\nAdimari, in expectation of getting assistance from them, disclosed\nthe affair to some Siennese, his friends, naming certain of the\nconspirators, and assuring them that the whole city was ready to rise at\nonce. One of them communicated the matter to Francesco Brunelleschi,\nnot with a design to injure the plot, but in the hope that he would join\nthem. Francesco, either from personal fear, or private hatred of some\none, revealed the whole to the duke; whereupon, Pagolo del Mazecha and\nSimon da Monterappoli were taken, who acquainted him with the number and\nquality of the conspirators. This terrified him, and he was advised to\nrequest their presence rather than to take them prisoners, for if they\nfled, he might without disgrace, secure himself by banishment of the\nrest. He therefore sent for Antonio Adimari, who, confiding in\nhis companions, appeared immediately, and was detained. Francesco\nBrunelleschi and Uguccione Buondelmonti advised the duke to take as many\nof the conspirators prisoners as he could, and put them to death;\nbut he, thinking his strength unequal to his foes, did not adopt this\ncourse, but took another, which, had it succeeded, would have freed him\nfrom his enemies and increased his power. It was the custom of the duke\nto call the citizens together upon some occasions and advise with them.\nHe therefore having first sent to collect forces from without, made\na list of three hundred citizens, and gave it to his messengers, with\norders to assemble them under the pretense of public business; and\nhaving drawn them together, it was his intention either to put them to\ndeath or imprison them.\nThe capture of Antonio Adimari and the sending for forces, which could\nnot be kept secret, alarmed the citizens, and more particularly those\nwho were in the plot, so that the boldest of them refused to attend, and\nas each had read the list, they sought each other, and resolved to rise\nat once and die like men, with arms in their hands, rather than be\nled like calves to the slaughter. In a very short time the chief\nconspirators became known to each other, and resolved that the next day,\nwhich was the 26th July, 1343, they would raise a disturbance in the Old\nMarket place, then arm themselves and call the people to freedom.\nThe next morning being come, at nine o'clock, according to agreement,\nthey took arms, and at the call of liberty assembled, each party in its\nown district, under the ensigns and with the arms of the people,\nwhich had been secretly provided by the conspirators. All the heads of\nfamilies, as well of the nobility as of the people, met together, and\nswore to stand in each other's defense, and effect the death of the\nduke; except some of the Buondelmonti and of the Cavalcanti, with those\nfour families of the people which had taken so conspicuous a part in\nmaking him sovereign, and the butchers, with others, the lowest of the\nplebeians, who met armed in the piazza in his favor.\nThe duke immediately fortified the place, and ordered those of his\npeople who were lodged in different parts of the city to mount upon\nhorseback and join those in the court; but, on their way thither, many\nwere attacked and slain. However, about three hundred horse assembled,\nand the duke was in doubt whether he should come forth and meet\nthe enemy, or defend himself within. On the other hand, the Medici,\nCavicciulli, Rucellai, and other families who had been most injured by\nhim, fearful that if he came forth, many of those who had taken arms\nagainst him would discover themselves his partisans, in order to deprive\nhim of the occasion of attacking them and increasing the number of\nhis friends, took the lead and assailed the palace. Upon this, those\nfamilies of the people who had declared for the duke, seeing themselves\nboldly attacked, changed their minds, and all took part with the\ncitizens, except Uguccione Buondelmonti, who retired into the palace,\nand Giannozzo Cavalcanti, who having withdrawn with some of his\nfollowers to the new market, mounted upon a bench, and begged that those\nwho were going in arms to the piazza, would take the part of the duke.\nIn order to terrify them, he exaggerated the number of his people and\nthreatened all with death who should obstinately persevere in their\nundertaking against their sovereign. But not finding any one either\nto follow him, or to chastise his insolence, and seeing his labor\nfruitless, he withdrew to his own house.\nIn the meantime, the contest in the piazza between the people and the\nforces of the duke was very great; but although the place served them\nfor defense, they were overcome, some yielding to the enemy, and others,\nquitting their horses, fled within the walls. While this was going on,\nCorso and Amerigo Donati, with a part of the people, broke open the\nstinche, or prisons; burnt the papers of the provost and of the public\nchamber; pillaged the houses of the rectors, and slew all who had held\noffices under the duke whom they could find. The duke, finding the\npiazza in possession of his enemies, the city opposed to him, and\nwithout any hope of assistance, endeavored by an act of clemency to\nrecover the favor of the people. Having caused those whom he had made\nprisoners to be brought before him, with amiable and kindly expressions\nhe set them at liberty, and made Antonio Adimari a knight, although\nquite against his will. He caused his own arms to be taken down, and\nthose of the people to be replaced over the palace; but these things\ncoming out of season, and forced by his necessities, did him little\ngood. He remained, notwithstanding all he did, besieged in the palace,\nand saw that having aimed at too much he had lost all, and would most\nlikely, after a few days, die either of hunger, or by the weapons of his\nenemies. The citizens assembled in the church of Santa Reparata, to\nform the new government, and appointed fourteen citizens, half from\nthe nobility and half from the people, who, with the archbishop, were\ninvested with full authority to remodel the state of Florence. They also\nelected six others to take upon them the duties of provost, till he who\nshould be finally chosen took office, the duties of which were usually\nperformed by a subject of some neighboring state.\nMany had come to Florence in defense of the people; among whom were a\nparty from Sienna, with six ambassadors, men of high consideration in\ntheir own country. These endeavored to bring the people and the duke\nto terms; but the former refused to listen to any whatever, unless\nGuglielmo da Scesi and his son, with Cerrettieri Bisdomini, were\nfirst given up to them. The duke would not consent to this; but being\nthreatened by those who were shut up with him, he was forced to comply.\nThe rage of men is certainly always found greater, and their revenge\nmore furious upon the recovery of liberty, than when it has only been\ndefended. Guglielmo and his son were placed among the thousands of their\nenemies, and the latter was not yet eighteen years old; neither his\nbeauty, his innocence, nor his youth, could save him from the fury of\nthe multitude; but both were instantly slain. Those who could not wound\nthem while alive, wounded them after they were dead; and not satisfied\nwith tearing them to pieces, they hewed their bodies with swords, tore\nthem with their hands, and even with their teeth. And that every sense\nmight be satiated with vengeance, having first heard their moans, seen\ntheir wounds, and touched their lacerated bodies, they wished even the\nstomach to be satisfied, that having glutted the external senses, the\none within might also have its share. This rabid fury, however hurtful\nto the father and son, was favorable to Cerrettieri; for the multitude,\nwearied with their cruelty toward the former, quite forgot him, so that\nhe, not being asked for, remained in the palace, and during night was\nconveyed safely away by his friends.\nThe rage of the multitude being appeased by their blood, an agreement\nwas made that the duke and his people, with whatever belonged to him,\nshould quit the city in safety; that he should renounce all claim, of\nwhatever kind, upon Florence, and that upon his arrival in the Casentino\nhe should ratify his renunciation. On the sixth of August he set out,\naccompanied by many citizens, and having arrived at the Casentino he\nratified the agreement, although unwillingly, and would not have kept\nhis word if Count Simon had not threatened to take him back to Florence.\nThis duke, as his proceedings testified, was cruel and avaricious,\ndifficult to speak with, and haughty in reply. He desired the service of\nmen, not the cultivation of their better feelings, and strove rather\nto inspire them with fear than love. Nor was his person less despicable\nthan his manners; he was short, his complexion was black, and he had a\nlong, thin beard. He was thus in every respect contemptible; and at the\nend of ten months, his misconduct deprived him of the sovereignty which\nthe evil counsel of others had given him.\nCHAPTER IX\nMany cities and territories, subject to the Florentines, rebel--Prudent\nconduct adopted upon this occasion--The city is divided into\nquarters--Disputes between the nobility and the people--The bishop\nendeavors to reconcile them, but does not succeed--The government\nreformed by the people--Riot of Andrea Strozzi--Serious disagreements\nbetween the nobility and the people--They come to arms, and the nobility\nare subdued--The plague in Florence of which Boccaccio speaks.\nThese events taking place in the city, induced all the dependencies\nof the Florentine state to throw off their yoke; so that Arezzo,\nCastiglione, Pistoia, Volterra, Colle, and San Gemigniano rebelled. Thus\nFlorence found herself deprived of both her tyrant and her dominions at\nthe same moment, and in recovering her liberty, taught her subjects\nhow they might become free. The duke being expelled and the territories\nlost, the fourteen citizens and the bishop thought it would be better to\nact kindly toward their subjects in peace, than to make them enemies by\nwar, and to show a desire that their subjects should be free as well as\nthemselves. They therefore sent ambassadors to the people of Arezzo, to\nrenounce all dominion over that city, and to enter into a treaty with\nthem; to the end that as they could not retain them as subjects, they\nmight make use of them as friends. They also, in the best manner they\nwere able, agreed with the other places that they should retain their\nfreedom, and that, being free, they might mutually assist each other in\nthe preservation of their liberties. This prudent course was attended\nwith a most favorable result; for Arezzo, not many years afterward,\nreturned to the Florentine rule, and the other places, in the course\nof a few months, returned to their former obedience. Thus it frequently\noccurs that we sooner attain our ends by a seeming indifferent to them,\nthan by more obstinate pursuit.\nHaving settled external affairs, they now turned to the consideration of\nthose within the city; and after some altercation between the nobility\nand the people, it was arranged that the nobility should form one-third\nof the Signory and fill one-half of the other offices. The city was, as\nwe have before shown, divided into sixths; and hence there would be six\nsignors, one for each sixth, except when, from some more than ordinary\ncause, there had been twelve or thirteen created; but when this had\noccurred they were again soon reduced to six. It now seemed desirable to\nmake an alteration in this respect, as well because the sixths were\nnot properly divided, as that, wishing to give their proportion to\nthe great, it became desirable to increase the number. They therefore\ndivided the city into quarters, and for each created three signors.\nThey abolished the office of Gonfalonier of Justice, and also the\nGonfaloniers of the companies of the people; and instead of the twelve\nBuonuomini, or good men, created eight counsellors, four from each\nparty. The government having been established in this manner, the city\nmight have been in repose if the great had been content to live in that\nmoderation which civil society requires. But they produced a contrary\nresult, for those out of office would not conduct themselves as\ncitizens, and those who were in government wished to be lords, so that\nevery day furnished some new instance of their insolence and pride.\nThese things were very grievous to the people, and they began to regret\nthat for one tyrant put down, there had sprung up a thousand. The\narrogance of one party and the anger of the other rose to such a degree,\nthat the heads of the people complained to the bishop of the improper\nconduct of the nobility, and what unfit associates they had become for\nthe people; and begged he would endeavor to induce them to be content\nwith their share of administration in the other offices, and leave the\nmagistracy of the Signory wholly to themselves.\nThe bishop was naturally a well-meaning man, but his want of firmness\nrendered him easily influenced. Hence, at the instance of his\nassociates, he at first favored the duke of Athens, and afterward, by\nthe advice of other citizens, conspired against him. At the reformation\nof the government, he had favored the nobility, and now he appeared to\nincline toward the people, moved by the reasons which they had\nadvanced. Thinking to find in others the same instability of purpose, he\nendeavored to effect an amicable arrangement. With this design he called\ntogether the fourteen who were yet in office, and in the best terms\nhe could imagine advised them to give up the Signory to the people, in\norder to secure the peace of the city; and assured them that if they\nrefused, ruin would most probably be the result.\nThis discourse excited the anger of the nobility to the highest pitch,\nand Ridolfo de' Bardi reproved him in unmeasured terms as a man of\nlittle faith; reminding him of his friendship for the duke, to prove the\nduplicity of his present conduct, and saying, that in driving him away\nhe had acted the part of a traitor. He concluded by telling him, that\nthe honors they had acquired at their own peril, they would at their own\nperil defend. They then left the bishop, and in great wrath, informed\ntheir associates in the government, and all the families of the\nnobility, of what had been done. The people also expressed their\nthoughts to each other, and as the nobility made preparations for the\ndefense of their signors, they determined not to wait till they had\nperfected their arrangements; and therefore, being armed, hastened to\nthe palace, shouting, as they went along, that the nobility must give up\ntheir share in the government.\nThe uproar and excitement were astonishing. The Signors of the nobility\nfound themselves abandoned; for their friends, seeing all the people in\narms, did not dare to rise in their defense, but each kept within his\nown house. The Signors of the people endeavored to abate the excitement\nof the multitude, by affirming their associates to be good and moderate\nmen; but, not succeeding in their attempt, to avoid a greater evil, sent\nthem home to their houses, whither they were with difficulty conducted.\nThe nobility having left the palace, the office of the four councillors\nwas taken from their party, and conferred upon twelve of the people. To\nthe eight signors who remained, a Gonfalonier of Justice was added, and\nsixteen Gonfaloniers of the companies of the people; and the council\nwas so reformed, that the government remained wholly in the hands of the\npopular party.\nAt the time these events took place there was a great scarcity in the\ncity, and discontent prevailed both among the highest and the lowest\nclasses; in the latter for want of food, and in the former from having\nlost their power in the state. This circumstance induced Andrea Strozzi\nto think of making himself sovereign of the city. Selling his corn at a\nlower price than others did, a great many people flocked to his house;\nemboldened by the sight of these, he one morning mounted his horse, and,\nfollowed by a considerable number, called the people to arms, and in a\nshort time drew together about 4,000 men, with whom he proceeded to the\nSignory, and demanded that the gates of the palace should be opened. But\nthe signors, by threats and the force which they retained in the palace,\ndrove them from the court; and then by proclamation so terrified them,\nthat they gradually dropped off and returned to their homes, and Andrea,\nfinding himself alone, with some difficulty escaped falling into the\nhands of the magistrates.\nThis event, although an act of great temerity, and attended with the\nresult that usually follows such attempts, raised a hope in the minds\nof the nobility of overcoming the people, seeing that the lowest of the\nplebeians were at enmity with them. And to profit by this circumstance,\nthey resolved to arm themselves, and with justifiable force recover\nthose rights of which they had been unjustly deprived. Their minds\nacquired such an assurance of success, that they openly provided\nthemselves with arms, fortified their houses, and even sent to their\nfriends in Lombardy for assistance. The people and the Signory made\npreparation for their defense, and requested aid from Perugia and\nSienna, so that the city was filled with the armed followers of either\nparty. The nobility on this side of the Arno divided themselves into\nthree parts; the one occupied the houses of the Cavicciulli, near the\nchurch of St. John; another, the houses of the Pazzi and the Donati,\nnear the great church of St. Peter; and the third those of the\nCavalcanti in the New Market. Those beyond the river fortified the\nbridges and the streets in which their houses stood; the Nerli defended\nthe bridge of the Carraja; the Frescobaldi and the Manelli, the church\nof the Holy Trinity; and the Rossi and the Bardi, the bridge of the\nRubaconte and the Old Bridge. The people were drawn together under the\nGonfalon of justice and the ensigns of the companies of the artisans.\nBoth sides being thus arranged in order of battle, the people thought\nit imprudent to defer the contest, and the attack was commenced by\nthe Medici and the Rondinelli, who assailed the Cavicciulli, where the\nhouses of the latter open upon the piazza of St. John. Here both parties\ncontended with great obstinacy, and were mutually wounded, from the\ntowers by stones and other missiles, and from below by arrows. They\nfought for three hours; but the forces of the people continuing to\nincrease, and the Cavicciulli finding themselves overcome by numbers,\nand hopeless of other assistance, submitted themselves to the people,\nwho saved their houses and property; and having disarmed them, ordered\nthem to disperse among their relatives and friends, and remain unarmed.\nBeing victorious in the first attack, they easily overpowered the Pazzi\nand the Donati, whose numbers were less than those they had subdued; so\nthat there only remained on this side of the Arno, the Cavalcanti, who\nwere strong both in respect of the post they had chosen and in their\nfollowers. Nevertheless, seeing all the Gonfalons against them, and\nthat the others had been overcome by three Gonfalons alone, they yielded\nwithout offering much resistance. Three parts of the city were now in\nthe hands of the people, and only one in possession of the nobility; but\nthis was the strongest, as well on account of those who held it, as from\nits situation, being defended by the Arno; hence it was first necessary\nto force the bridges. The Old Bridge was first assailed and offered a\nbrave resistance; for the towers were armed, the streets barricaded,\nand the barricades defended by the most resolute men; so that the\npeople were repulsed with great loss. Finding their labor at this point\nfruitless, they endeavored to force the Rubaconte Bridge, but no\nbetter success resulting, they left four Gonfalons in charge of the two\nbridges, and with the others attacked the bridge of the Carraja. Here,\nalthough the Nerli defended themselves like brave men, they could not\nresist the fury of the people; for this bridge, having no towers,\nwas weaker than the others, and was attacked by the Capponi, and many\nfamilies of the people who lived in that vicinity. Being thus assailed\non all sides, they abandoned the barricades and gave way to the people,\nwho then overcame the Rossi and the Frescobaldi; for all those beyond\nthe Arno took part with the conquerors.\nThere was now no resistance made except by the Bardi, who remained\nundaunted, notwithstanding the failure of their friends, the union of\nthe people against them, and the little chance of success which they\nseemed to have. They resolved to die fighting, and rather see their\nhouses burned and plundered, than submit to the power of their enemies.\nThey defended themselves with such obstinacy, that many fruitless\nattempts were made to overcome them, both at the Old Bridge and the\nRubaconte; but their foes were always repulsed with loss. There had in\nformer times been a street which led between the houses of the Pitti,\nfrom the Roman road to the walls upon Mount St. George. By this way\nthe people sent six Gonfalons, with orders to assail their houses from\nbehind. This attack overcame the resolution of the Bardi, and decided\nthe day in favor of the people; for when those who defended the\nbarricades in the street learned that their houses were being plundered,\nthey left the principal fight and hastened to their defense. This caused\nthe Old Bridge to be lost; the Bardi fled in all directions and were\nreceived into the houses of the Quaratesi, Panzanesi, and Mozzi. The\npeople, especially the lower classes, greedy for spoil, sacked and\ndestroyed their houses, and pulled down and burned their towers and\npalaces with such outrageous fury, that the most cruel enemy of the\nFlorentine name would have been ashamed of taking part in such wanton\ndestruction.\nThe nobility being thus overcome, the people reformed the government;\nand as they were of three kinds, the higher, the middle, and the lower\nclass, it was ordered that the first should appoint two signors; the two\nlatter three each, and that the Gonfalonier should be chosen alternately\nfrom either party. Besides this, all the regulations for the restraint\nof the nobility were renewed; and in order to weaken them still more,\nmany were reduced to the grade of the people. The ruin of the nobility\nwas so complete, and depressed them so much, that they never afterward\nventured to take arms for the recovery of their power, but soon became\nhumbled and abject in the extreme. And thus Florence lost the generosity\nof her character and her distinction in arms.\nAfter these events the city remained in peace till the year 1353. In the\ncourse of this period occurred the memorable plague, described with so\nmuch eloquence by Giovanni Boccaccio, and by which Florence lost 96,000\nsouls. In 1348, began the first war with the Visconti, occasioned by\nthe archbishop, then prince of Milan; and when this was concluded,\ndissensions again arose in the city; for although the nobility were\ndestroyed, fortune did not fail to cause new divisions and new troubles.\nBOOK III\nCHAPTER I\nReflections upon the domestic discords of republics--A parallel between\nthe discords of Rome and those of Florence--Enmities between the\nfamilies of the Ricci and the Albizzi--Uguccione de' Ricci causes\nthe laws against the Ghibellines to be renewed in order to injure\nthe Albizzi--Piero degli Albizzi derives advantage from it--Origin of\nadmonitions and the troubles which result from them--Uguccione de'\nRicci moderates their injustice--Difficulties increase--A meeting of the\ncitizens--They address the Signory--The Signory attempt to remedy the\nevils.\nThose serious, though natural enmities, which occur between the popular\nclasses and the nobility, arising from the desire of the latter to\ncommand, and the disinclination of the former to obey, are the causes of\nmost of the troubles which take place in cities; and from this diversity\nof purpose, all the other evils which disturb republics derive their\norigin. This kept Rome disunited; and this, if it be allowable to\ncompare small things with great, held Florence in disunion; although\nin each city it produced a different result; for animosities were only\nbeginning with the people and nobility of Rome contended, while ours\nwere brought to a conclusion by the contentions of our citizens. A new\nlaw settled the disputes of Rome; those of Florence were only terminated\nby the death and banishment of many of her best people. Those of\nRome increased her military virtue, while that of Florence was quite\nextinguished by her divisions. The quarrels of Rome established\ndifferent ranks of society, those of Florence abolished the distinctions\nwhich had previously existed. This diversity of effects must have been\noccasioned by the different purposes which the two people had in view.\nWhile the people of Rome endeavored to associate with the nobility in\nthe supreme honors, those of Florence strove to exclude the nobility\nfrom all participation in them: as the desire of the Roman people was\nmore reasonable, no particular offense was given to the nobility; they\ntherefore consented to it without having recourse to arms; so that,\nafter some disputes concerning particular points, both parties agreed to\nthe enactment of a law which, while it satisfied the people, preserved\nthe nobility in the enjoyment of their dignity.\nOn the other hand, the demands of the people of Florence being insolent\nand unjust, the nobility, became desperate, prepared for their defense\nwith their utmost energy, and thus bloodshed and the exile of citizens\nfollowed. The laws which were afterward made, did not provide for the\ncommon good, but were framed wholly in favor of the conquerors. This\ntoo, must be observed, that from the acquisition of power, made by the\npeople of Rome, their minds were very much improved; for all the offices\nof state being attainable as well by the people as the nobility,\nthe peculiar excellencies of the latter exercised a most beneficial\ninfluence upon the former; and as the city increased in virtue she\nattained a more exalted greatness.\nBut in Florence, the people being conquerors, the nobility were deprived\nof all participation in the government; and in order to regain a portion\nof it, it became necessary for them not only to seem like the people,\nbut to be like them in behavior, mind, and mode of living. Hence arose\nthose changes in armorial bearings, and in the titles of families, which\nthe nobility adopted, in order that they might seem to be of the people;\nmilitary virtue and generosity of feeling became extinguished in them;\nthe people not possessing these qualities, they could not appreciate\nthem, and Florence became by degrees more and more depressed and\nhumiliated. The virtue of the Roman nobility degenerating into pride,\nthe citizens soon found that the business of the state could not be\ncarried on without a prince. Florence had now come to such a point, that\nwith a comprehensive mind at the head of affairs she would easily have\nbeen made to take any form that he might have been disposed to give her;\nas may be partly observed by a perusal of the preceding book.\nHaving given an account of the origin of Florence, the commencement\nof her liberty, with the causes of her divisions, and shown how the\nfactions of the nobility and the people ceased with the tyranny of the\nduke of Athens, and the ruin of the former, we have now to speak of\nthe animosities between the citizens and the plebeians and the various\ncircumstances which they produced.\nThe nobility being overcome, and the war with the archbishop of Milan\nconcluded, there did not appear any cause of dissension in Florence. But\nthe evil fortune of the city, and the defective nature of her laws,\ngave rise to enmities between the family of the Albizzi and that of\nthe Ricci, which divided her citizens as completely as those of the\nBuondelmonti and the Uberti, or the Donati and the Cerchi had formerly\ndone. The pontiffs, who at this time resided in France, and the\nemperors, who abode in Germany, in order to maintain their influence\nin Italy, sent among us multitudes of soldiers of many countries, as\nEnglish, Dutch, and Bretons. As these, upon the conclusion of a war,\nwere thrown out of pay, though still in the country, they, under the\nstandard of some soldier of fortune, plundered such people as were least\nprepared to defend themselves. In the year 1353 one of these companies\ncame into Tuscany under the command of Monsignor Reale, of Provence, and\nhis approach terrified all the cities of Italy. The Florentines not\nonly provided themselves forces, but many citizens, among whom were\nthe Albizzi and the Ricci, armed themselves in their own defense. These\nfamilies were at the time full of hatred against each other, and each\nthought to obtain the sovereignty of the republic by overcoming his\nenemy. They had not yet proceeded to open violence, but only contended\nin the magistracies and councils. The city being all in arms, a quarrel\narose in the Old Market place, and, as it frequently happens in similar\ncases, a great number of people were drawn together. The disturbance\nspreading, it was told the Ricci that the Albizzi had assailed their\npartisans, and to the Albizzi that the Ricci were in quest of them. Upon\nthis the whole city arose, and it was all the magistrates could do to\nrestrain these families, and prevent the actual occurrence of a disaster\nwhich, without being the fault of either of them, had been willfully\nthough falsely reported as having already taken place. This apparently\ntrifling circumstance served to inflame the minds of the parties, and\nmake each the more resolved to increase the number of their followers.\nAnd as the citizens, since the ruin of the nobility, were on such an\nequality that the magistrates were more respected now than they had\npreviously been, they designed to proceed toward the suppression of this\ndisorder with civil authority alone.\nWe have before related, that after the victory of Charles I. the\ngovernment was formed of the Guelphic party, and that it thus\nacquired great authority over the Ghibellines. But time, a variety of\ncircumstances, and new divisions had so contributed to sink this party\nfeeling into oblivion, that many of Ghibelline descent now filled the\nhighest offices. Observing this, Uguccione, the head of the family of\nthe Ricci, contrived that the law against the Ghibellines should be\nagain brought into operation; many imagining the Albizzi to be of that\nfaction, they having arisen in Arezzo, and come long ago to Florence.\nUguccione by this means hoped to deprive the Albizzi of participation\nin the government, for all of Ghibelline blood who were found to hold\noffices, would be condemned in the penalties which this law provided.\nThe design of Uguccione was discovered to Piero son of Filippo degli\nAlbizzi, and he resolved to favor it: for he saw that to oppose it would\nat once declare him a Ghibelline; and thus the law which was renewed by\nthe ambition of the Ricci for his destruction, instead of robbing Piero\ndegli Albizzi of reputation, contributed to increase his influence,\nalthough it laid the foundation of many evils. Nor is it possible for\na republic to enact a law more pernicious than one relating to matters\nwhich have long transpired. Piero having favored this law, which had\nbeen contrived by his enemies for his stumbling-block, it became the\nstepping-stone to his greatness; for, making himself the leader of this\nnew order of things, his authority went on increasing, and he was in\ngreater favor with the Guelphs than any other man.\nAs there could not be found a magistrate willing to search out who were\nGhibellines, and as this renewed enactment against them was therefore\nof small value, it was provided that authority should be given to the\nCapitani to find out who were of this faction; and, having discovered,\nto signify and ADMONISH them that they were not to take upon\nthemselves any office of government; to which ADMONITIONS, if they were\ndisobedient, they became condemned in the penalties. Hence, all those\nwho in Florence are deprived of the power to hold offices are called\n_ammoniti_, or ADMONISHED.\nThe Capitani in time acquiring greater audacity, admonished not only\nthose to whom the admonition was applicable, but any others at the\nsuggestion of their own avarice or ambition; and from 1356, when this\nlaw was made, to 1366, there had been admonished above 200 citizens.\nThe Captains of the Parts and the sect of the Guelphs were thus become\npowerful; for every one honored them for fear of being admonished; and\nmost particularly the leaders, who were Piero degli Albizzi, Lapo da\nCastiglionchio, and Carlo Strozzi. This insolent mode of proceeding was\noffensive to many; but none felt so particularly injured with it as\nthe Ricci; for they knew themselves to have occasioned it, they saw\nit involved the ruin of the republic, and their enemies, the Albizzi,\ncontrary to their intention, became great in consequence.\nOn this account Uguccione de' Ricci, being one of the Signory, resolved\nto put an end to the evil which he and his friends had originated, and\nwith a new law provided that to the six Captains of Parts an additional\nthree should be appointed, of whom two should be chosen from the\ncompanies of minor artificers, and that before any party could be\ndeclared Ghibelline, the declaration of the Capitani must be confirmed\nby twenty-four Guelphic citizens, appointed for the purpose. This\nprovision tempered for a time the power of the Capitani, so that the\nadmonitions were greatly diminished, if not wholly laid aside. Still the\nparties of the Albizzi and the Ricci were continually on the alert to\noppose each other's laws, deliberations, and enterprises, not from a\nconviction of their inexpediency, but from a hatred of their promoters.\nIn such distractions the time passed from 1366 to 1371, when the\nGuelphs again regained the ascendant. There was in the family of the\nBuondelmonti a gentleman named Benchi, who, as an acknowledgment of his\nmerit in a war against the Pisans, though one of the nobility, had been\nadmitted among the people, and thus became eligible to office among the\nSignory; but when about to take his seat with them, a law was made that\nno nobleman who had become of the popular class should be allowed to\nassume that office. This gave great offense to Benchi, who, in union\nwith Piero degli Albizzi, determined to depress the less powerful of\nthe popular party with ADMONITIONS, and obtain the government for\nthemselves. By the interest which Benchi possessed with the ancient\nnobility, and that of Piero with most of the influential citizens, the\nGuelphic party resumed their ascendancy, and by new reforms among the\nPARTS, so remodeled the administration as to be able to dispose of the\noffices of the captains and the twenty-four citizens at pleasure. They\nthen returned to the ADMONITIONS with greater audacity than ever, and\nthe house of the Albizzi became powerful as the head of this faction.\nOn the other hand, the Ricci made the most strenuous exertions against\ntheir designs; so that anxiety universally prevailed, and ruin was\napprehended alike from both parties. In consequence of this a great\nnumber of citizens, out of love to their country, assembled in the\nchurch of St. Piero Scarraggio, and after a long consideration of the\nexisting disorders, presented themselves before the Signors, whom one of\nthe principal among them addressed in the following terms:--\n\"Many of us, magnificent Signors! were afraid of meeting even for\nconsideration of public business, without being publicly called\ntogether, lest we should be noted as presumptuous or condemned as\nambitious. But seeing that so many citizens daily assemble in the lodges\nand halls of the palace, not for any public utility, but only for the\ngratification of their own ambition, we have thought that as those who\nassemble for the ruin of the republic are fearless, so still less ought\nthey to be apprehensive who meet together only for its advantage; nor\nought we to be anxious respecting the opinion they may form of our\nassembling, since they are so utterly indifferent to the opinion of\nothers. Our affection for our country, magnificent Signors! caused us\nto assemble first, and now brings us before you, to speak of grievances\nalready great and daily increasing in our republic, and to offer our\nassistance for their removal: and we doubt not that, though a difficult\nundertaking, it will still be attended with success, if you will lay\naside all private regards, and authoritatively use the public force.\n\"The common corruption of all the cities of Italy, magnificent Signors!\nhas infested and still vitiates your own; for when this province had\nshaken off the imperial yoke, her cities not being subject to any\npowerful influence that might restrain them, administered affairs, not\nas free men do, but as a factious populace; and hence have arisen all\nthe other evils and disorders that have appeared. In the first place,\nthere cannot be found among the citizens either unity or friendship,\nexcept with those whose common guilt, either against their country or\nagainst private individuals, is a bond of union. And as the knowledge\nof religion and the fear of God seem to be alike extinct, oaths and\npromises have lost their validity, and are kept as long as it is found\nexpedient; they are adopted only as a means of deception, and he is most\napplauded and respected whose cunning is most efficient and secure. On\nthis account bad men are received with the approbation due to virtue,\nand good ones are regarded only in the light of fools.\n\"And certainly in the cities of Italy all that is corruptible and\ncorrupting is assembled. The young are idle, the old lascivious, and\neach sex and every age abounds with debasing habits, which the good\nlaws, by misapplication, have lost the power to correct. Hence arises\nthe avarice so observable among the citizens, and that greediness,\nnot for true glory, but for unworthy honors; from which follow hatred,\nanimosities, quarrels, and factions; resulting in deaths, banishments,\naffliction to all good men, and the advancement of the most\nunprincipled; for the good, confiding in their innocence, seek neither\nsafety nor advancement by illegal methods as the wicked do, and thus\nunhonored and undefended they sink into oblivion.\n\"From proceedings such as these, arise at once the attachment for and\ninfluence of parties; bad men follow them through ambition and avarice,\nand necessity compels the good to pursue the same course. And most\nlamentable is it to observe how the leaders and movers of parties\nsanctify their base designs with words that are all piety and virtue;\nthey have the name of liberty constantly in their mouths, though their\nactions prove them her greatest enemies. The reward which they desire\nfrom victory is not the glory of having given liberty to the city, but\nthe satisfaction of having vanquished others, and of making themselves\nrulers; and to attain their end, there is nothing too unjust, too cruel,\ntoo avaricious for them to attempt. Thus laws and ordinances, peace,\nwars, and treaties are adopted and pursued, not for the public good, not\nfor the common glory of the state, but for the convenience or advantage\nof a few individuals.\n\"And if other cities abound in these disorders, ours is more than any\ninfected with them; for her laws, statutes, and civil ordinances are\nnot, nor have they ever been, established for the benefit of men in a\nstate of freedom, but according to the wish of the faction that has\nbeen uppermost at the time. Hence it follows that, when one party is\nexpelled, or faction extinguished, another immediately arises; for, in\na city that is governed by parties rather than by laws, as soon as one\nbecomes dominant and unopposed, it must of necessity soon divide against\nitself; for the private methods at first adapted for its defense will\nnow no longer keep it united. The truth of this, both the ancient and\nmodern dissensions of our city prove. Everyone thought that when the\nGhibellines were destroyed, the Guelphs would long continue happy and\nhonored; yet after a short time they divided into the Bianchi and Neri,\nthe black faction and the white. When the Bianchi were overcome, the\ncity was not long free from factions; for either, in favor of the\nemigrants, or on account of the animosity between the nobility and the\npeople, we were still constantly at war. And as if resolved to give up\nto others, what in mutual harmony we either would not or were unable\nto retain, we confided the care of our precious liberty first to King\nRobert, then to his brother, next to his son, and at last to the duke of\nAthens. Still we have never in any condition found repose, but seem\nlike men who can neither agree to live in freedom nor be content\nwith slavery. Nor did we hesitate (so greatly does the nature of our\nordinances dispose us to division), while yet under allegiance to the\nking, to substitute for his majesty, one of the vilest of men born at\nAgobbio.\n\"For the credit of the city, the name of the duke of Athens ought to be\nconsigned to oblivion. His cruel and tyrannical disposition, however,\nmight have taught us wisdom and instructed us how to live; but no sooner\nwas he expelled than we handled our arms, and fought with more hatred,\nand greater fury than we had ever done on any former occasion; so that\nthe ancient nobility were vanquished the city was left at the disposal\nof the people. It was generally supposed that no further occasion of\nquarrel or of party animosity could arise, since those whose pride and\ninsupportable ambition had been regarded as the causes of them were\ndepressed; however, experience proves how liable human judgment is to\nerror, and what false impressions men imbibe, even in regard to the\nthings that most intimately concern them; for we find the pride and\nambition of the nobility are not extinct, but only transferred from them\nto the people who at this moment, according to the usual practice of\nambitious men, are endeavoring to render themselves masters of the\nrepublic; and knowing they have no chance of success but what is offered\nby discord, they have again divided the city, and the names of Guelph\nand Ghibelline, which were beginning to be forgotten (and it would have\nbeen well if they had never been heard among us), are repeated anew in\nour ears.\n\"It seems almost necessarily ordained, in order that in human affairs\nthere may be nothing either settled or permanent, that in all republics\nthere are what may be called fatal families, born for the ruin of their\ncountry. Of this kind of pest our city has produced a more copious brood\nthan any other; for not one but many have disturbed and harassed her:\nfirst the Buondelmonti and the Uberti; then the Donati and the Cerchi;\nand now, oh ridiculous! oh disgraceful thought! the Ricci and the\nAlbizzi have caused a division of her citizens.\n\"We have not dwelt upon our corrupt habits or our old and continual\ndissensions to occasion you alarm, but to remind you of their causes; to\nshow that as you doubtless are aware of them, we also keep them in view,\nand to remind you that their results ought not to make you diffident\nof your power to repress the disorders of the present time. The ancient\nfamilies possessed so much influence, and were held in such high esteem,\nthat civil force was insufficient to restrain them; but now, when the\nempire has lost its ascendancy, the pope is no longer formidable, and\nthe whole of Italy is reduced to a state of the most complete equality,\nthere can be no difficulty. Our republic might more especially than any\nother (although at first our former practices seem to present a reason\nto the contrary), not only keep itself united but be improved by good\nlaws and civil regulations, if you, the Signory, would once resolve to\nundertake the matter; and to this we, induced by no other motive than\nthe love of our country, would most strongly urge you. It is true\nthe corruption of the country is great, and much discretion will be\nrequisite to correct it; but do not impute the past disorders to\nthe nature of the men, but to the times, which, being changed, give\nreasonable ground to hope that, with better government, our city will\nbe attended with better fortune; for the malignity of the people will\nbe overcome by restraining the ambition and annulling the ordinances of\nthose who have encouraged faction, and adopting in their stead only such\nprinciples as are conformable to true civil liberty. And be assured,\nthat these desirable ends will be more certainly attained by the benign\ninfluence of the laws, than by a delay which will compel the people to\neffect them by force and arms.\"\nThe Signory, induced by the necessity of the case, of which they were\npreviously aware, and further encouraged by the advice of those who now\naddressed them, gave authority to fifty-six citizens to provide for the\nsafety of the republic. It is usually found that most men are better\nadapted to pursue a good course already begun, than to discover one\napplicable to immediate circumstances. These citizens thought rather of\nextinguishing existing factions than of preventing the formation of\nnew ones, and effected neither of these objects. The facilities for the\nestablishment of new parties were not removed; and out of those which\nthey guarded against, another more powerful arose, which brought the\nrepublic into still greater danger. They, however, deprived three of\nthe family of the Albizzi, and three of that of the Ricci, of all the\noffices of government, except those of the Guelphic party, for three\nyears; and among the deprived were Piero degli Albizzi and Uguccione\nde' Ricci. They forbade the citizens to assemble in the palace, except\nduring the sittings of the Signory. They provided that if any one were\nbeaten, or possession of his property detained from him, he might bring\nhis case before the council and denounce the offender, even if he were\none of the nobility; and that if it were proved, the accused should be\nsubject to the usual penalties. This provision abated the boldness of\nthe Ricci, and increased that of the Albizzi; since, although it applied\nequally to both, the Ricci suffered from it by far the most; for if\nPiero was excluded from the palace of the Signory, the chamber of the\nGuelphs, in which he possessed the greatest authority, remained open to\nhim; and if he and his followers had previously been ready to ADMONISH,\nthey became after this injury, doubly so. To this pre-disposition for\nevil, new excitements were added.\nCHAPTER II\nThe war of the Florentines against the pope's legate, and the causes\nof it--League against the pope--The censures of the pope disregarded in\nFlorence--The city is divided into two factions, the one the Capitani di\nParte, the other of the eight commissioners of the war--Measures adopted\nby the Guelphic party against their adversaries--The Guelphs endeavor to\nprevent Salvestro de Medici from being chosen Gonfalonier--Salvestro de\nMedici Gonfalonier--His law against the nobility, and in favor of the\nAmmoniti--The _Collegi_ disapprove of the law--Salvestro addresses the\ncouncil in its favor--The law is passed--Disturbances in Florence.\nThe papal chair was occupied by Gregory XI. He, like his predecessors,\nresiding at Avignon, governed Italy by legates, who, proud and\navaricious, oppressed many of the cities. One of these legates, then\nat Bologna, taking advantage of a great scarcity of food at Florence,\nendeavored to render himself master of Tuscany, and not only withheld\nprovisions from the Florentines, but in order to frustrate their hopes\nof the future harvest, upon the approach of spring, attacked them with\na large army, trusting that being famished and unarmed, he should find\nthem an easy conquest. He might perhaps have been successful, had not\nhis forces been mercenary and faithless, and, therefore, induced\nto abandon the enterprise for the sum of 130,000 florins, which the\nFlorentines paid them. People may go to war when they will, but cannot\nalways withdraw when they like. This contest, commenced by the ambition\nof the legate, was sustained by the resentment of the Florentines,\nwho, entering into a league with Bernabo of Milan, and with the cities\nhostile to the church, appointed eight citizens for the administration\nof it, giving them authority to act without appeal, and to expend\nwhatever sums they might judge expedient, without rendering an account\nof the outlay.\nThis war against the pontiff, although Uguccione was now dead,\nreanimated those who had followed the party of the Ricci, who, in\nopposition to the Albizzi, had always favored Bernabo and opposed the\nchurch, and this, the rather, because the eight commissioners of war\nwere all enemies of the Guelphs. This occasioned Piero degli Albizzi,\nLapo da Castiglionchio, Carlo Strozzi, and others, to unite themselves\nmore closely in opposition to their adversaries. The eight carried on\nthe war, and the others admonished during three years, when the death\nof the pontiff put an end to the hostilities, which had been carried on\nwhich so much ability, and with such entire satisfaction to the people,\nthat at the end of each year the eight were continued in office, and\nwere called _Santi_, or holy, although they had set ecclesiastical\ncensures at defiance, plundered the churches of their property, and\ncompelled the priests to perform divine service. So much did citizens\nat that time prefer the good of their country to their ghostly\nconsolations, and thus showed the church, that if as her friends they\nhad defended, they could as enemies depress her; for the whole of\nRomagna, the Marches, and Perugia were excited to rebellion.\nYet while this war was carried on against the pope, they were unable to\ndefend themselves against the captains of the parts and their faction;\nfor the insolence of the Guelphs against the eight attained such a\npitch, that they could not restrain themselves from abusive behavior,\nnot merely against some of the most distinguished citizens, but even\nagainst the eight themselves; and the captains of the parts conducted\nthemselves with such arrogance, that they were feared more than the\nSignory. Those who had business with them treated them with greater\nreverence, and their court was held in higher estimation: so that no\nambassador came to Florence, without commission to the captains.\nPope Gregory being dead, and the city freed from external war; there\nstill prevailed great confusion within; for the audacity of the Guelphs\nwas insupportable, and as no available mode of subduing them presented\nitself, it was thought that recourse must be had to arms, to determine\nwhich party was the strongest. With the Guelphs were all the ancient\nnobility, and the greater part of the most popular leaders, of which\nnumber, as already remarked, were Lapo, Piero, and Carlo. On the other\nside, were all the lower orders, the leaders of whom were the eight\ncommissioners of war, Giorgio Scali and Tommaso Strozzi, and with them\nthe Ricci, Alberti, and Medici. The rest of the multitude, as most\ncommonly happens, joined the discontented party.\nIt appeared to the heads of the Guelphic faction that their enemies\nwould be greatly strengthened, and themselves in considerable danger in\ncase a hostile Signory should resolve on their subjugation. Desirous,\ntherefore, of being prepared against this calamity, the leaders of the\nparty assembled to take into consideration the state of the city and\nthat of their own friends in particular, and found the _ammoniti_ so\nnumerous and so great a difficulty, that the whole city was excited\nagainst them on this account. They could not devise any other remedy\nthan, that as their enemies had deprived them of all the offices of\nhonor, they should banish their opponents from the city, take possession\nof the palace of the Signory, and bring over the whole state to their\nown party; in imitation of the Guelphs of former times, who found no\nsafety in the city, till they had driven all their adversaries out of\nit. They were unanimous upon the main point, but did not agree upon the\ntime of carrying it into execution. It was in the month of April, in the\nyear 1378, when Lapo, thinking delay inadvisable, expressed his opinion,\nthat procrastination was in the highest degree perilous to themselves;\nas in the next Signory, Salvestro de' Medici would very probably be\nelected Gonfalonier, and they all knew he was opposed to their party.\nPiero degli Albizzi, on the other hand, thought it better to defer,\nsince they would require forces, which could not be assembled without\nexciting observation, and if they were discovered, they would incur\ngreat risk. He thereupon judged it preferable to wait till the\napproaching feast of St. John on which, being the most solemn festival\nof the city, vast multitudes would be assembled, among whom they\nmight conceal whatever numbers they pleased. To obviate their fears of\nSalvestro, he was to be ADMONISHED, and if this did not appear likely to\nbe effectual, they would \"ADMONISH\" one of the Colleague of his quarter,\nand upon redrawing, as the ballot-boxes would be nearly empty, chance\nwould very likely occasion that either he or some associate of his\nwould be drawn, and he would thus be rendered incapable of sitting as\nGonfalonier. They therefore came to the conclusion proposed by Piero,\nthough Lapo consented reluctantly, considering the delay dangerous, and\nthat, as no opportunity can be in all respects suitable, he who waits\nfor the concurrence of every advantage, either never makes an attempt,\nor, if induced to do so, is most frequently foiled. They \"admonished\"\nthe Colleague, but did not prevent the appointment of Salvestro, for the\ndesign was discovered by the Eight, who took care to render all attempts\nupon the drawing futile.\nSalvestro Alammano de' Medici was therefore drawn Gonfalonier, and,\nbeing one of the noblest popular families, he could not endure that the\npeople should be oppressed by a few powerful persons. Having resolved\nto put an end to their insolence, and perceiving the middle classes\nfavorably disposed, and many of the highest of the people on his side,\nhe communicated his design to Benedetto Alberti, Tommaso Strozzi, and\nGeorgio Scali, who all promised their assistance. They, therefore,\nsecretly draw up a law which had for its object to revive the\nrestrictions upon the nobility, to retrench the authority of the\nCapitani di Parte, and recall the _ammoniti_ to their dignity. In order\nto attempt and obtain their ends, at one and the same time, having to\nconsult, first the Colleagues and then the Councils, Salvestro being\nProvost (which office for the time makes its possessor almost prince of\nthe city), he called together the Colleagues and the Council on the same\nmorning, and the Colleagues being apart, he proposed the law prepared\nby himself and his friends, which, being a novelty, encountered in their\nsmall number so much opposition, that he was unable to have it passed.\nSalvestro, seeing his first attempt likely to fail, pretended to leave\nthe room for a private reason, and, without being perceived, went\nimmediately to the Council, and taking a lofty position from which he\ncould be both seen and heard, said:--\"That considering himself invested\nwith the office of Gonfalonier, not so much to preside in private\ncases (for which proper judges were appointed, who have their regular\nsittings), as to guard the state, correct the insolence of the powerful,\nand ameliorate those laws by the influence of which the republic was\nbeing ruined, he had carefully attended to both these duties, and to his\nutmost ability provided for them, but found the perversity of some so\nmuch opposed to his just designs as to deprive him of all opportunity of\ndoing good, and them not only of the means of assisting him with\ntheir counsel, but even hearing him. Therefore finding he no longer\ncontributed either to the benefit of the republic or of the people\ngenerally, he could not perceive any reason for his longer holding the\nmagistracy, of which he was either undeserving, or others thought him\nso, and would therefore retire to his house, that the people might\nappoint another in his stead, who would either have greater virtue or\nbetter fortune than himself.\" And having said this, he left the room as\nif to return home.\nThose of the council who were in the secret, and others desirous of\nnovelty, raised a tumult, at which the Signory and the Colleagues came\ntogether, and finding the Gonfalonier leaving them, entreatingly and\nauthoritatively detained him, and obliged him to return to the council\nroom, which was now full of confusion. Many of the noble citizens\nwere threatened in opprobrious language; and an artificer seized Carlo\nStrozzi by the throat, and would undoubtedly have murdered him, but\nwas with difficulty prevented by those around. He who made the greatest\ndisturbance, and incited the city to violence, was Benedetto degli\nAlberti, who, from a window of the palace, loudly called the people to\narms; and presently the courtyards were filled with armed men, and the\nColleagues granted to threats, what they had refused to entreaty. The\nCapitani di Parte had at the same time drawn together a great number of\ncitizens to their hall to consult upon the means of defending themselves\nagainst the orders of the Signors, but when they heard the tumult that\nwas raised, and were informed of the course the Councils had adopted,\neach took refuge in his own house.\nLet no one, when raising popular commotions, imagine he can afterward\ncontrol them at his pleasure, or restrain them from proceeding to the\ncommission of violence. Salvestro intended to enact his law, and compose\nthe city; but it happened otherwise; for the feelings of all had\nbecome so excited, that they shut up the shops; the citizens fortified\nthemselves in their houses; many conveyed their valuable property into\nthe churches and monasteries, and everyone seemed to apprehend something\nterrible at hand. The companies of the Arts met, and each appointed\nan additional officer or Syndic; upon which the Priors summoned their\nColleagues and these Syndics, and consulted a whole day how the city\nmight be appeased with satisfaction to the different parties; but much\ndifference of opinion prevailed, and no conclusion was come to. On the\nfollowing day the Arts brought forth their banners, which the Signory\nunderstanding, and being apprehensive of evil, called the Council\ntogether to consider what course to adopt. But scarcely were they\nmet, when the uproar recommenced, and soon the ensigns of the Arts,\nsurrounded by vast numbers of armed men, occupied the courts. Upon this\nthe Council, to give the Arts and the people hope of redress, and free\nthemselves as much as possible from the charge of causing the mischief,\ngave a general power, which in Florence is called _Balia_, to the\nSignors, the Colleagues, the Eight, the Capitani di Parte, and to the\nSyndics of the Arts, to reform the government of the city, for the\ncommon benefit of all. While this was being arranged, a few of the\nensigns of the Arts and some of the mob, desirous of avenging themselves\nfor the recent injuries they had received from the Guelphs, separated\nthemselves from the rest, and sacked and burnt the house of Lapo da\nCastiglionchio, who, when he learned the proceedings of the Signory\nagainst the Guelphs, and saw the people in arms, having no other\nresource but concealment or flight, first took refuge in Santa Croce,\nand afterward, being disguised as a monk, fled into the Casentino, where\nhe was often heard to blame himself for having consented to wait till\nSt. John's day, before they had made themselves sure of the government.\nPiero degli Albizzi and Carlo Strozzi hid themselves upon the first\noutbreak of the tumult, trusting that when it was over, by the interest\nof their numerous friends and relations, they might remain safely in\nFlorence.\nThe house of Lapo being burnt, as mischief begins with difficulty but\neasily increases, many other houses, either through public hatred, or\nprivate malice, shared the same fate; and the rioters, that they might\nhave companions more eager than themselves to assist them in their work\nof plunder, broke open the public prisons, and then sacked the monastery\nof the Agnoli and the convent of S. Spirito, whither many citizens\nhad taken their most valuable goods for safety. Nor would the public\nchambers have escaped these destroyers' hands, except out of reverence\nfor one of the Signors, who on horseback, and followed by many citizens\nin arms, opposed the rage of the mob.\nCHAPTER III\nContrary measures adopted by the magistrates to effect a\npacification--Luigi Guicciardini the Gonfalonier entreats the\nmagistrates of the Arts to endeavor to pacify the people--Serious riot\ncaused by the plebeians--The woolen Art--The plebeians assemble--The\nspeech of a seditious plebeian--Their resolution thereupon--The Signory\ndiscover the designs of the plebeians--Measures adopted to counteract\nthem.\nThis popular fury being abated by the authority of the Signors and\nthe approach of night, on the following day, the Balia relieved the\nadmonished, on condition that they should not for three years be capable\nof holding any magistracy. They annulled the laws made by the Guelphs to\nthe prejudice of the citizens; declared Lapo da Castiglionchio and his\ncompanions, rebels, and with them many others, who were the objects of\nuniversal detestation. After these resolutions, the new Signory were\ndrawn for, and Luigi Guicciardini appointed Gonfalonier, which gave hope\nthat the tumults would soon be appeased; for everyone thought them to be\npeaceable men and lovers of order. Still the shops were not opened, nor\ndid the citizens lay down their arms, but continued to patrol the city\nin great numbers; so that the Signory did not assume the magistracy with\nthe usual pomp, but merely assembled within the palace, omitting all\nceremony.\nThis Signory, considering nothing more advisable in the beginning of\ntheir magistracy than to restore peace, caused a relinquishment of arms;\nordered the shops to be opened, and the strangers who had been called to\ntheir aid, to return to their homes. They appointed guards in many parts\nof the city, so that if the admonished would only have remained quiet,\norder would soon have been re-established. But they were not satisfied\nto wait three years for the recovery of their honours; so that to\ngratify them the Arts again met, and demanded of the Signory, that for\nthe benefit and quiet of the city, they would ordain that no citizens\nshould at any time, whether Signor, Colleague, Capitano di Parte, or\nConsul of any art whatever, be admonished as a Ghibelline; and further,\nthat new ballots of the Guelphic party should be made, and the old ones\nburned. These demands were at once acceded to, not only by the Signors,\nbut by all the Councils; and thus it was hoped the tumults newly excited\nwould be settled.\nBut since men are not satisfied with recovering what is their own, but\nwish to possess the property of others and to revenge themselves,\nthose who were in hopes of benefiting by these disorders persuaded the\nartificers that they would never be safe, if several of their enemies\nwere not expelled from the city or destroyed. This terrible doctrine\ncoming to the knowledge of the Signory, they caused the magistrates\nof the Arts and their Syndics to be brought before them, and Luigi\nGuicciardini, the Gonfalonier, addressed them in the following words:\n\"If these Signors, and I with them, had not long been acquainted with\nthe fate of this city, that as soon as external wars have ceased\nthe internal commence, we should have been more surprised, and our\ndispleasure would have been greater. But as evils to which we are\naccustomed are less annoying, we have endured past disturbances\npatiently, they having arisen for the most part without our fault; and\nwe hoped that, like former troubles, they would soon have an end, after\nthe many and great concessions we had made at your suggestion. But\nfinding that you are yet unsettled, that you contemplate the commission\nof new crimes against your fellow-citizens, and are desirous of making\nnew exiles, our displeasure increases in proportion to your misconduct.\nAnd certainly, could we have believed that during our magistracy the\ncity was to be ruined, whether with or without your concurrence, we\nshould certainly, either by flight or exile, have avoided these horrors.\nBut trusting that we had to do with those who possessed some feelings\nof humanity and some love of their country, we willingly accepted the\nmagistracy, thinking that by our gentleness we should overcome your\nambition. But we perceive from experience that the more humble our\nbehavior, the more concessions we make, the prouder you become, and the\nmore exorbitant are your demands. And though we speak thus, it is not in\norder to offend, but to amend you. Let others tell you pleasing tales,\nour design is to communicate only what is for your good. Now we would\nask you, and have you answer on your honor, What is there yet ungranted,\nthat you can, with any appearance of propriety, require? You wished to\nhave authority taken from the Capitani di Parte; and it is done. You\nwished that the ballotings should be burned, and a reformation of them\ntake place; and we consent. You desired that the admonished should be\nrestored to their honours; and it is permitted. At your entreaty we have\npardoned those who have burned down houses and plundered churches;\nmany honorable citizens have been exiled to please you; and at your\nsuggestion new restraints have been laid upon the Great. When will there\nbe an end of your demands? and how long will you continue to abuse our\nliberality? Do you not observe with how much more moderation we bear\ndefeat than you your victory? To what end will your divisions bring our\ncity? Have you forgotten that when disunited Castruccio, a low citizen\nof Lucca, subdued her? or that a duke of Athens, your hired captain did\nso too? But when the citizens were united in her defense, an archbishop\nof Milan and a pope were unable to subdue it, and, after many years of\nwar, were compelled to retire with disgrace.\n\"Then why would you, by your discords, reduce to slavery in a time of\npeace, that city, which so many powerful enemies have left free, even in\nwar? What can you expect from your disunion but subjugation? or from the\nproperty of which you already have plundered, or may yet plunder us, but\npoverty? for this property is the means by which we furnish occupation\nfor the whole city, and if you take it from us, our means of finding\nthat occupation is withdrawn. Besides, those who take it will have\ndifficulty in preserving what is dishonestly acquired, and thus poverty\nand destitution are brought upon the city. Now, I, and these Signors\ncommand, and if it were consistent with propriety, we would entreat that\nyou allow your minds to be calmed; be content, rest satisfied with the\nprovisions that have been made for you; and if you should be found to\nneed anything further, make your request with decency and order, and not\nwith tumult; for when your demands are reasonable they will always be\ncomplied with, and you will not give occasion to evil designing men\nto ruin your country and cast the blame upon yourselves.\" These words\nconveying nothing but the truth, produced a suitable effect upon the\nminds of the citizens, who thanking the Gonfalonier for having acted\ntoward them the part of a king Signor, and toward the city that of a\ngood citizen, offered their obedience in whatever might be committed\nto them. And the Signors, to prove the sincerity of their intentions,\nappointed two citizens for each of the superior magistracies, who, with\nSyndics of the arts, were to consider what could be done to restore\nquite, and report their resolutions to the Signors.\nWhile these things were in progress, a disturbance arose, much more\ninjurious to the republic than anything that had hitherto occurred.\nThe greatest part of the fires and robberies which took place on the\nprevious days were perpetrated by the very lowest of the people; and\nthose who had been the most audacious, were afraid that when the greater\ndifferences were composed, they would be punished for the crimes they\nhad committed; and that as usual, they would be abandoned by those who\nhad instigated them to the commission of crime. To this may be added,\nthe hatred of the lower orders toward the rich citizens and the\nprincipals of the arts, because they did not think themselves\nremunerated for their labor in a manner equal to their merits. For in\nthe time of Charles I., when the city was divided into arts, a head or\ngovernor was appointed to each, and it was provided that the individuals\nof each art, should be judged in civil matters by their own superiors.\nThese arts, as we have before observed, were at first twelve; in the\ncourse of time they were increased to twenty-one, and attained so much\npower, that in a few years they grasped the entire government of the\ncity; and as some were in greater esteem than others, they were divided\ninto MAJOR and MINOR; seven were called \"major,\" and fourteen, the\n\"minor arts.\" From this division, and from other causes which we have\nnarrated above, arose the arrogance of the Capitani di Parte; for those\ncitizens who had formerly been Guelphs, and had the constant disposal of\nthat magistracy, favored the followers of the major and persecuted\nthe minor arts and their patrons; and hence arose the many commotions\nalready mentioned. When the companies of the arts were first organized,\nmany of those trades, followed by the lowest of the people and the\nplebeians, were not incorporated, but were ranged under those arts\nmost nearly allied to them; and, hence, when they were not properly\nremunerated for their labor, or their masters oppressed them, they had\nno one of whom to seek redress, except the magistrate of the art to\nwhich theirs was subject; and of him they did not think justice always\nattainable. Of the arts, that which had always had, and now has, the\ngreatest number of these subordinates, is the woolen; which being\nboth then, and still, the most powerful body, and first in authority,\nsupports the greater part of the plebeians and lowest of the people.\nThe lower classes, then, the subordinates not only of the woolen,\nbut also of the other arts, were discontented, from the causes just\nmentioned; and their apprehension of punishment for the burnings and\nrobberies they had committed, did not tend to compose them. Meetings\ntook place in different parts during the night, to talk over the past,\nand to communicate the danger in which they were, when one of the most\ndaring and experienced, in order to animate the rest, spoke thus:\n\"If the question now were, whether we should take up arms, rob and burn\nthe houses of the citizens, and plunder churches, I am one of those who\nwould think it worthy of further consideration, and should, perhaps,\nprefer poverty and safety to the dangerous pursuit of an uncertain good.\nBut as we have already armed, and many offenses have been committed, it\nappears to me that we have to consider how to lay them aside, and secure\nourselves from the consequences of what is already done. I certainly\nthink, that if nothing else could teach us, necessity might. You see the\nwhole city full of complaint and indignation against us; the citizens\nare closely united, and the signors are constantly with the magistrates.\nYou may be sure they are contriving something against us; they are\narranging some new plan to subdue us. We ought therefore to keep two\nthings in view, and have two points to consider; the one is, to escape\nwith impunity for what has been done during the last few days, and the\nother, to live in greater comfort and security for the time to come. We\nmust, therefore, I think, in order to be pardoned for our faults, commit\nnew ones; redoubling the mischief, and multiplying fires and robberies;\nand in doing this, endeavor to have as many companions as we can; for\nwhen many are in fault, few are punished; small crimes are chastised,\nbut great and serious ones rewarded. When many suffer, few seek\nvengeance; for general evils are endured more patiently than private\nones. To increase the number of misdeeds will, therefore, make\nforgiveness more easily attainable, and will open the way to secure what\nwe require for our own liberty. And it appears evident that the gain is\ncertain; for our opponents are disunited and rich; their disunion will\ngive us the victory, and their riches, when they have become ours, will\nsupport us. Be not deceived about that antiquity of blood by which they\nexalt themselves above us; for all men having had one common origin, are\nall equally ancient, and nature has made us all after one fashion. Strip\nus naked, and we shall all be found alike. Dress us in their clothing,\nand they in ours, we shall appear noble, they ignoble--for poverty and\nriches make all the difference. It grieves me much to think that some\nof you are sorry inwardly for what is done, and resolve to abstain from\nanything more of the kind. Certainly, if it be so, you are not the men\nI took you for; because neither shame nor conscience ought to have\nany influence with you. Conquerors, by what means soever, are never\nconsidered aught but glorious. We have no business to think\nabout conscience; for when, like us, men have to fear hunger, and\nimprisonment, or death, the fear of hell neither can nor ought to have\nany influence upon them. If you only notice human proceedings, you may\nobserve that all who attain great power and riches, make use of\neither force or fraud; and what they have acquired either by deceit or\nviolence, in order to conceal the disgraceful methods of attainment,\nthey endeavor to sanctify with the false title of honest gains. Those\nwho either from imprudence or want of sagacity avoid doing so, are\nalways overwhelmed with servitude and poverty; for faithful servants are\nalways servants, and honest men are always poor; nor do any ever escape\nfrom servitude but the bold and faithless, or from poverty, but the\nrapacious and fraudulent. God and nature have thrown all human fortunes\ninto the midst of mankind; and they are thus attainable rather by rapine\nthan by industry, by wicked actions rather than by good. Hence it is\nthat men feed upon each other, and those who cannot defend themselves\nmust be worried. Therefore we must use force when the opportunity\noffers; and fortune cannot present us one more favorable than the\npresent, when the citizens are still disunited, the Signory doubtful,\nand the magistrates terrified; for we may easily conquer them before\nthey can come to any settled arrangement. By this means we shall either\nobtain the entire government of the city, or so large a share of it, as\nto be forgiven past errors, and have sufficient authority to threaten\nthe city with a renewal of them at some future time. I confess this\ncourse is bold and dangerous, but when necessity presses, audacity\nbecomes prudence, and in great affairs the brave never think of dangers.\nThe enterprises that are begun with hazard always have a reward at last;\nand no one ever escaped from embarrassment without some peril. Besides,\nit is easy to see from all their preparations of prisons, racks, and\ninstruments of death, that there is more danger in inaction than in\nendeavoring to secure ourselves; for in the first case the evils are\ncertain, in the latter doubtful. How often have I heard you complain of\nthe avarice of your superiors and the injustice of your magistrates. Now\nthen is the time, not only to liberate yourself from them, but to become\nso much superior, that they will have more causes of grief and fear\nfrom you, than you from them. The opportunity presented by circumstances\npasses away, and when gone, it will be vain to think it can be recalled.\nYou see the preparations of our enemies; let us anticipate them; and\nthose who are first in arms will certainly be victors, to the ruin of\ntheir enemies and their own exaltation; and thus honors will accrue to\nmany of us and security to all.\" These arguments greatly inflamed minds\nalready disposed to mischief, so that they determined to take up arms as\nsoon as they had acquired a sufficient number of associates, and bound\nthemselves by oath to mutual defense, in case any of them were subdued\nby the civil power.\nWhile they were arranging to take possession of the republic, their\ndesign became known to the Signory, who, having taken a man named\nSimone, learned from him the particulars of the conspiracy, and that the\noutbreak was to take place on the following day. Finding the danger so\npressing, they called together the colleagues and those citizens who\nwith the syndics of the arts were endeavoring to effect the union of the\ncity. It was then evening, and they advised the signors to assemble the\nconsuls of the trades, who proposed that whatever armed force was in\nFlorence should be collected, and with the Gonfaloniers of the people\nand their companies, meet under arms in the piazza next morning. It\nhappened that while Simone was being tortured, a man named Niccolo da\nSan Friano was regulating the palace clock, and becoming acquainted\nwith what was going on, returned home and spread the report of it in his\nneighborhood, so that presently the piazza of St. Spirito was\noccupied by above a thousand men. This soon became known to the other\nconspirators, and San Pietro Maggiore and St. Lorenzo, their places of\nassembly, were presently full of them, all under arms.\nCHAPTER IV\nProceedings of the plebeians--The demand they make of the Signory--They\ninsist that the Signory leave the palace--The Signory leave the\npalace--Michael di Lando Gonfalonier--Complaints and movements of the\nplebeians against Michael di Lando--Michael di Lando proceeds against\nthe plebeians and reduces them to order--Character of Michael di Lando.\nAt daybreak on the 21st of July, there did not appear in the piazza\nabove eighty men in arms friendly to the Signory, and not one of\nthe Gonfaloniers; for knowing the whole city to be in a state of\ninsurrection they were afraid to leave their homes. The first body of\nplebeians that made its appearance was that which had assembled at San\nPietro Maggiore; but the armed force did not venture to attack them.\nThen came the other multitudes, and finding no opposition, they loudly\ndemanded their prisoners from the Signory; and being resolved to have\nthem by force if they were not yielded to their threats, they burned\nthe house of Luigi Guicciardini; and the Signory, for fear of greater\nmischief, set them at liberty. With this addition to their strength they\ntook the Gonfalon of Justice from the bearer, and under the shadow\nof authority which it gave them, burned the houses of many citizens,\nselecting those whose owners had publicly or privately excited their\nhatred. Many citizens, to avenge themselves for private injuries,\nconducted them to the houses of their enemies; for it was quite\nsufficient to insure its destruction, if a single voice from the mob\ncalled out, \"To the house of such a one,\" or if he who bore the Gonfalon\ntook the road toward it. All the documents belonging to the woolen\ntrade were burned, and after the commission of much violence, by way\nof associating it with something laudable, Salvestro de Medici and\nsixty-three other citizens were made knights, among whom were Benedetto\nand Antonio degli Alberti, Tommaso Strozzi and others similarly their\nfriends; though many received the honor against their wills. It was\na remarkable peculiarity of the riots, that many who had their houses\nburned, were on the same day, and by the same party made knights; so\nclose were the kindness and the injury together. This circumstance\noccurred to Luigi Guicciardini, Gonfalonier of Justice.\nIn this tremendous uproar, the Signory, finding themselves abandoned by\ntheir armed force, by the leaders of the arts, and by the Gonfaloniers,\nbecame dismayed; for none had come to their assistance in obedience to\norders; and of the sixteen Gonfalons, the ensign of the Golden Lion\nand of the Vaio, under Giovenco della Stufa and Giovanni Cambi alone\nappeared; and these, not being joined by any other, soon withdrew.\nOf the citizens, on the other hand, some, seeing the fury of this\nunreasonable multitude and the palace abandoned, remained within doors;\nothers followed the armed mob, in the hope that by being among them,\nthey might more easily protect their own houses or those of their\nfriends. The power of the plebeians was thus increased and that of the\nSignory weakened. The tumult continued all day, and at night the rioters\nhalted near the palace of Stefano, behind the church of St. Barnabas.\nTheir number exceeded six thousand, and before daybreak they obtained\nby threats the ensigns of the trades, with which and the Gonfalon of\nJustice, when morning came, they proceeded to the palace of the provost,\nwho refusing to surrender it to them, they took possession of it by\nforce.\nThe Signory, desirous of a compromise, since they could not restrain\nthem by force, appointed four of the Colleagues to proceed to the palace\nof the provost, and endeavor to learn what was their intention. They\nfound that the leaders of the plebeians, with the Syndics of the trades\nand some citizens, had resolved to signify their wishes to the Signory.\nThey therefore returned with four deputies of the plebeians, who\ndemanded that the woolen trade should not be allowed to have a foreign\njudge; that there should be formed three new companies of the arts;\nnamely, one for the wool combers and dyers, one for the barbers,\ndoublet-makers, tailors, and such like, and the third for the lowest\nclass of people. They required that the three new arts should furnish\ntwo Signors; the fourteen minor arts, three; and that the Signory should\nprovide a suitable place of assembly for them. They also made it a\ncondition that no member of these companies should be expected during\ntwo years to pay any debt that amounted to less than fifty ducats; that\nthe bank should take no interest on loans already contracted, and that\nonly the principal sum should be demanded; that the condemned and the\nbanished should be forgiven, and the admonished should be restored to\nparticipation in the honors of government. Besides these, many other\narticles were stipulated in favor of their friends, and a requisition\nmade that many of their enemies should be exiled and admonished. These\ndemands, though grievous and dishonorable to the republic, were for fear\nof further violence granted, by the joint deliberation of the Signors,\nColleagues, and Council of the people. But in order to give it full\neffect, it was requisite that the Council of the Commune should also\ngive its consent; and, as they could not assemble two councils during\nthe same day it was necessary to defer it till the morrow. However the\ntrades appeared content, the plebeians satisfied; and both promised,\nthat these laws being confirmed, every disturbance should cease.\nOn the following morning, while the Council of the Commune were in\nconsultation, the impatient and volatile multitude entered the piazza,\nunder their respective ensigns, with loud and fearful shouts,\nwhich struck terror into all the Council and Signory; and Guerrente\nMarignolli, one of the latter, influenced more by fear than anything\nelse, under pretense of guarding the lower doors, left the chamber and\nfled to his house. He was unable to conceal himself from the multitude,\nwho, however, took no notice, except that, upon seeing him, they\ninsisted that all the Signors should quit the palace, and declared\nthat if they refused to comply, their houses should be burned and their\nfamilies put to death.\nThe law had now been passed; the Signors were in their own apartments;\nthe Council had descended from the chamber, and without leaving the\npalace, hopeless of saving the city, they remained in the lodges and\ncourts below, overwhelmed with grief at seeing such depravity in the\nmultitude, and such perversity or fear in those who might either have\nrestrained or suppressed them. The Signory, too, were dismayed and\nfearful for the safety of their country, finding themselves abandoned\nby one of their associates, and without any aid or even advice; when, at\nthis moment of uncertainty as to what was about to happen, or what would\nbe best to be done, Tommaso Strozzi and Benedetto Alberti, either from\nmotives of ambition (being desirous of remaining masters of the palace),\nor because they thought it the most advisable step, persuaded them to\ngive way to the popular impulse, and withdraw privately to their homes.\nThis advice, given by those who had been the leaders of the tumult,\nalthough the others yielded, filled Alamanno Acciajuoli and Niccolo del\nBene, two of the Signors, with anger; and, reassuming a little vigor,\nthey said, that if the others would withdraw they could not help it, but\nthey would remain as long as they continued in office, if they did not\nin the meantime lose their lives. These dissensions redoubled the fears\nof the Signory and the rage of the people, so that the Gonfalonier,\ndisposed rather to conclude his magistracy in dishonor than in danger,\nrecommended himself to the care of Tommaso Strozzi, who withdrew him\nfrom the palace and conducted him to his house. The other Signors were,\none after another, conveyed in the same manner, so that Alamanno and\nNiccolo, not to appear more valiant than wise, seeing themselves left\nalone, also retired, and the palace fell into the hands of the plebeians\nand the Eight Commissioners of War, who had not yet laid down their\nauthority.\nWhen the plebeians entered the palace, the standard of the Gonfalonier\nof Justice was in the hands of Michael di Lando, a wool comber. This\nman, barefoot, with scarcely anything upon him, and the rabble at his\nheels, ascended the staircase, and, having entered the audience chamber\nof the Signory, he stopped, and turning to the multitude said, \"You see\nthis palace is now yours, and the city is in your power; what do you\nthink ought to be done?\" To which they replied, they would have him for\ntheir Gonfalonier and lord; and that he should govern them and the city\nas he thought best. Michael accepted the command; and, as he was a cool\nand sagacious man, more favored by nature than by fortune, he resolved\nto compose the tumult, and restore peace to the city. To occupy the\nminds of the people, and give himself time to make some arrangement, he\nordered that one Nuto, who had been appointed bargello, or sheriff,\nby Lapo da Castiglionchio, should be sought. The greater part of his\nfollowers went to execute this commission; and, to commence with justice\nthe government he had acquired by favor, he commanded that no one should\neither burn or steal anything; while, to strike terror into all, he\ncaused a gallows to be erected in the court of the palace. He began\nthe reform of government by deposing the Syndics of the trades, and\nappointing new ones; he deprived the Signory and the Colleagues of their\nmagistracy, and burned the balloting purses containing the names of\nthose eligible to office under the former government.\nIn the meantime, Ser Nuto, being brought by the mob into the court, was\nsuspended from the gallows by one foot; and those around having torn him\nto pieces, in little more than a moment nothing remained of him but the\nfoot by which he had been tied.\nThe Eight Commissioners of War, on the other hand, thinking themselves,\nafter the departure of the Signors, left sole masters of the city, had\nalready formed a new Signory; but Michael, on hearing this, sent them\nan order to quit the palace immediately; for he wished to show that he\ncould govern Florence without their assistance. He then assembled the\nSyndics of the trades, and created as a Signory, four from the lowest\nplebeians; two from the major, and two from the minor trades. Besides\nthis, he made a new selection of names for the balloting purses, and\ndivided the state into three parts; one composed of the new trades,\nanother of the minor, and the third of the major trades. He gave to\nSalvestro de' Medici the revenue of the shops upon the Old Bridge; for\nhimself he took the provostry of Empoli, and conferred benefits upon\nmany other citizens, friends of the plebeians; not so much for the\npurpose of rewarding their labors, as that they might serve to screen\nhim from envy.\nIt seemed to the plebeians that Michael, in his reformation of the\nstate, had too much favored the higher ranks of the people, and that\nthemselves had not a sufficient share in the government to enable them\nto preserve it; and hence, prompted by their usual audacity, they again\ntook arms, and coming tumultuously into the court of the palace, each\nbody under their particular ensigns, insisted that the Signory\nshould immediately descend and consider new means for advancing their\nwell-being and security. Michael, observing their arrogance, was\nunwilling to provoke them, but without further yielding to their\nrequest, blamed the manner in which it was made, advised them to lay\ndown their arms, and promised that then would be conceded to them, what\notherwise, for the dignity of the state, must of necessity be withheld.\nThe multitude, enraged at this reply, withdrew to Santa Maria Novella,\nwhere they appointed eight leaders for their party, with officers, and\nother regulations to ensure influence and respect; so that the city\npossessed two governments, and was under the direction of two distinct\npowers. These new leaders determined that Eight, elected from their\ntrades, should constantly reside in the palace with the Signory, and\nthat whatever the Signory should determine must be confirmed by them\nbefore it became law. They took from Salvestro de' Medici and Michael\ndi Lando the whole of what their former decrees had granted them, and\ndistributed to many of their party offices and emoluments to enable them\nto support their dignity. These resolutions being passed, to render them\nvalid they sent two of their body to the Signory, to insist on their\nbeing confirmed by the Council, with an intimation, that if not granted\nthey would be vindicated by force. This deputation, with amazing\naudacity and surpassing presumption, explained their commission to the\nSignory, upbraided the Gonfalonier with the dignity they had conferred\nupon him, the honor they had done him, and with the ingratitude and want\nof respect he had shown toward them. Coming to threats toward the end of\ntheir discourse, Michael could not endure their arrogance, and sensible\nrather of the dignity of the office he held than of the meanness of his\norigin, determined by extraordinary means to punish such extraordinary\ninsolence, and drawing the sword with which he was girt, seriously\nwounded, and cause them to be seized and imprisoned.\nWhen the fact became known, the multitude were filled with rage, and\nthinking that by their arms they might ensure what without them they\nhad failed to effect, they seized their weapons and with the utmost\nfury resolved to force the Signory to consent to their wishes. Michael,\nsuspecting what would happen, determined to be prepared, for he knew his\ncredit rather required him to be first to the attack than to wait the\napproach of the enemy, or, like his predecessors, dishonor both the\npalace and himself by flight. He therefore drew together a good number\nof citizens (for many began to see their error), mounted on horseback,\nand followed by crowds of armed men, proceeded to Santa Maria Novella,\nto encounter his adversaries. The plebeians, who as before observed\nwere influenced by a similar desire, had set out about the same time as\nMichael, and it happened that as each took a different route, they did\nnot meet in their way, and Michael, upon his return, found the piazza in\ntheir possession. The contest was now for the palace, and joining in the\nfight, he soon vanquished them, drove part of them out of the city,\nand compelled the rest to throw down their arms and escape or conceal\nthemselves, as well as they could. Having thus gained the victory, the\ntumults were composed, solely by the talents of the Gonfalonier, who in\ncourage, prudence, and generosity surpassed every other citizen of his\ntime, and deserves to be enumerated among the glorious few who have\ngreatly benefited their country; for had he possessed either malice or\nambition, the republic would have been completely ruined, and the city\nmust have fallen under greater tyranny than that of the duke of Athens.\nBut his goodness never allowed a thought to enter his mind opposed to\nthe universal welfare: his prudence enabled him to conduct affairs in\nsuch a manner, that a great majority of his own faction reposed the most\nentire confidence in him; and he kept the rest in awe by the influence\nof his authority. These qualities subdued the plebeians, and opened the\neyes of the superior artificers, who considered how great must be the\nfolly of those, who having overcome the pride of the nobility, could\nendure to submit to the nauseous rule of the rabble.\nCHAPTER V\nNew regulations for the elections of the Signory--Confusion in the\nCity--Piero degli Albizzi and other citizens condemned to death--The\nFlorentines alarmed by the approach of Charles of Durazzo--The\nmeasures adopted in consequence thereof--Insolent Conduct of Giorgio\nScali--Benedetto Alberti--Giorgio Scali beheaded.\nBy the time Michael di Lando had subdued the plebeians, the new Signory\nwas drawn, and among those who composed it, were two persons of such\nbase and mean condition, that the desire increased in the minds of the\npeople to be freed from the ignominy into which they had fallen; and\nwhen, upon the first of September, the new Signory entered office and\nthe retiring members were still in the palace, the piazza being full of\narmed men, a tumultuous cry arose from the midst of them, that none\nof the lowest of the people should hold office among the Signory. The\nobnoxious two were withdrawn accordingly. The name of one was Il Tira,\nof the other Baroccio, and in their stead were elected Giorgio Scali\nand Francesco di Michele. The company of the lowest trade was also\ndissolved, and its members deprived of office, except Michael di Lando,\nLorenzo di Puccio and a few others of better quality. The honors of\ngovernment were divided into two parts, one of which was assigned to the\nsuperior trades, the other to the inferior; except that the latter were\nto furnish five Signors, and the former only four. The Gonfalonier was\nto be chosen alternately from each.\nThe government thus composed, restored peace to the city for the\ntime; but though the republic was rescued from the power of the lowest\nplebeians, the inferior trades were still more influential than the\nnobles of the people, who, however, were obliged to submit for the\ngratification of the trades, of whose favor they wished to deprive the\nplebeians. The new establishment was supported by all who wished the\ncontinued subjugation of those who, under the name of the Guelphic\nparty, had practiced such excessive violence against the citizens. And\nas among others, thus disposed, were Giorgio Scali, Benedetto Alberti,\nSalvestro di Medici, and Tommaso Strozzi, these four almost became\nprinces of the city. This state of the public mind strengthened the\ndivisions already commenced between the nobles of the people, and the\nminor artificers, by the ambition of the Ricci and the Albizzi; from\nwhich, as at different times very serious effects arose, and as they\nwill hereafter be frequently mentioned, we shall call the former\nthe popular party, the latter the plebeian. This condition of things\ncontinued three years, during which many were exiled and put to death;\nfor the government lived in constant apprehension, knowing that both\nwithin and without the city many were dissatisfied with them. Those\nwithin, either attempted or were suspected of attempting every day some\nnew project against them; and those without, being under no restraint,\nwere continually, by means of some prince or republic, spreading reports\ntending to increase the disaffection.\nGianozzo da Salerno was at this time in Bologna. He held a command under\nCharles of Durazzo, a descendant of the kings of Naples, who, designing\nto undertake the conquest of the dominions of Queen Giovanna, retained\nhis captain in that city, with the concurrence of Pope Urban, who was at\nenmity with the queen. Many Florentine emigrants were also at Bologna,\nin close correspondence with him and Charles. This caused the rulers in\nFlorence to live in continual alarm, and induced them to lend a willing\near to any calumnies against the suspected. While in this disturbed\nstate of feeling, it was disclosed to the government that Gianozzo da\nSalerno was about to march to Florence with the emigrants, and that\ngreat numbers of those within were to rise in arms, and deliver the city\nto him. Upon this information many were accused, the principal of whom\nwere Piero degli Albizzi and Carlo Strozzi: and after these Cipriano\nMangione, Jacopo Sacchetti, Donato Barbadori, Filippo Strozzi, and\nGiovanni Anselmi, the whole of whom, except Carlo Strozzi who fled, were\nmade prisoners; and the Signory, to prevent any one from taking arms\nin their favor, appointed Tommaso Strozzi and Benedetto Alberti with\na strong armed force, to guard the city. The arrested citizens were\nexamined, and although nothing was elicited against them sufficient to\ninduce the Capitano to find them guilty, their enemies excited the minds\nof the populace to such a degree of outrageous and overwhelming fury\nagainst them, that they were condemned to death, as it were, by force.\nNor was the greatness of his family, or his former reputation of any\nservice to Piero degli Albizzi, who had once been, of all the citizens,\nthe man most feared and honored. Some one, either as a friend to\nrender him wise in his prosperity, or an enemy to threaten him with the\nfickleness of fortune, had upon the occasion of his making a feast for\nmany citizens, sent him a silver bowl full of sweetmeats, among which\na large nail was found, and being seen by many present, was taken for a\nhint to him to fix the wheel of fortune, which, having conveyed him to\nthe top, must if the rotation continued, also bring him to the bottom.\nThis interpretation was verified, first by his ruin, and afterward by\nhis death.\nAfter this execution the city was full of consternation, for both\nvictors and vanquished were alike in fear; but the worst effects arose\nfrom the apprehensions of those possessing the management of affairs;\nfor every accident, however trivial, caused them to commit fresh\noutrages, either by condemnations, admonitions, or banishment of\ncitizens; to which must be added, as scarcely less pernicious, the\nfrequent new laws and regulations which were made for defense of the\ngovernment, all of which were put in execution to the injury of those\nopposed to their faction. They appointed forty-six persons, who,\nwith the Signory, were to purge the republic of all suspected by the\ngovernment. They admonished thirty-nine citizens, ennobled many of the\npeople, and degraded many nobles to the popular rank. To strengthen\nthemselves against external foes, they took into their pay John\nHawkwood, an Englishman of great military reputation, who had long\nserved the pope and others in Italy. Their fears from without were\nincreased by a report that several bodies of men were being assembled\nby Charles of Durazzo for the conquest of Naples, and many Florentine\nemigrants were said to have joined him. Against these dangers, in\naddition to the forces which had been raised, large sums of money were\nprovided; and Charles, having arrived at Arezzo, obtained from the\nFlorentines 40,000 ducats, and promised he would not molest them. His\nenterprise was immediately prosecuted, and having occupied the kingdom\nof Naples, he sent Queen Giovanna a prisoner into Hungary. This victory\nrenewed the fears of those who managed the affairs of Florence, for\nthey could not persuade themselves that their money would have a greater\ninfluence on the king's mind than the friendship which his house had\nlong retained for the Guelphs, whom they so grievously oppressed.\nThis suspicion increasing, multiplied oppressions; which again, instead\nof diminishing the suspicion, augmented it; so that most men lived\nin the utmost discontent. To this the insolence of Giorgio Scali\nand Tommaso Strozzi (who by their popular influence overawed the\nmagistrates) also contributed, for the rulers were apprehensive that by\nthe power these men possessed with the plebeians they could set them at\ndefiance; and hence it is evident that not only to good men, but even to\nthe seditious, this government appeared tyrannical and violent. To put a\nperiod to the outrageous conduct of Giorgio, it happened that a servant\nof his accused Giovanni di Cambio of practices against the state, but\nthe Capitano declared him innocent. Upon this, the judge determined to\npunish the accuser with the same penalties that the accused would have\nincurred had he been guilty, but Giorgio Scali, unable to save him\neither by his authority or entreaties, obtained the assistance of\nTommaso Strozzi, and with a multitude of armed men, set the informer\nat liberty and plundered the palace of the Capitano, who was obliged\nto save himself by flight. This act excited such great and universal\nanimosity against him, that his enemies began to hope they would be able\nto effect his ruin, and also to rescue the city from the power of\nthe plebeians, who for three years had held her under their arrogant\ncontrol.\nTo the realization of this design the Capitano greatly contributed, for\nthe tumult having subsided, he presented himself before the signors,\nand said \"He had cheerfully undertaken the office to which they had\nappointed him, for he thought he should serve upright men who would take\narms for the defense of justice, and not impede its progress. But now\nthat he had seen and had experience of the proceedings of the city, and\nthe manner in which affairs were conducted, that dignity which he had\nvoluntarily assumed with the hope of acquiring honor and emolument, he\nnow more willingly resigned, to escape from the losses and danger to\nwhich he found himself exposed.\" The complaint of the Capitano was heard\nwith the utmost attention by the Signory, who promising to remunerate\nhim for the injury he had suffered and provide for his future security,\nhe was satisfied. Some of them then obtained an interview with certain\ncitizens who were thought to be lovers of the common good, and least\nsuspected by the state; and in conjunction with these, it was concluded\nthat the present was a favorable opportunity for rescuing the city from\nGiorgio and the plebeians, the last outrage he had committed having\ncompletely alienated the great body of the people from him. They judged\nit best to profit by the occasion before the excitement had abated, for\nthey knew that the favor of the mob is often gained or lost by the\nmost trifling circumstance; and more certainly to insure success, they\ndetermined, if possible, to obtain the concurrence of Benedetto Alberti,\nfor without it they considered their enterprise to be dangerous.\nBenedetto was one of the richest citizens, a man of unassuming manners,\nan ardent lover of the liberties of his country, and one to whom\ntyrannical measures were in the highest degree offensive; so that he was\neasily induced to concur in their views and consent to Giorgio's ruin.\nHis enmity against the nobles of the people and the Guelphs, and\nhis friendship for the plebeians, were caused by the insolence and\ntyrannical proceedings of the former; but finding that the plebeians had\nsoon become quite as insolent, he quickly separated himself from them;\nand the injuries committed by them against the citizens were done wholly\nwithout his consent. So that the same motives which made him join the\nplebeians induced him to leave them.\nHaving gained Benedetto and the leaders of the trades to their side,\nthey provided themselves with arms and made Giorgio prisoner. Tommaso\nfled. The next day Giorgio was beheaded; which struck so great a\nterror into his party, that none ventured to express the slightest\ndisapprobation, but each seemed anxious to be foremost in defense of the\nmeasure. On being led to execution, in the presence of that people who\nonly a short time before had idolized him, Giorgio complained of his\nhard fortune, and the malignity of those citizens who, having done him\nan undeserved injury, had compelled him to honor and support a mob,\npossessing neither faith nor gratitude. Observing Benedetto Alberti\namong those who had armed themselves for the preservation of order, he\nsaid, \"Do you, too, consent, Benedetto, that this injury shall be done\nto me? Were I in your place and you in mine, I would take care that no\none should injure you. I tell you, however, this day is the end of my\ntroubles and the beginning of yours.\" He then blamed himself for having\nconfided too much in a people who may be excited and inflamed by every\nword, motion, and breath of suspicion. With these complaints he died in\nthe midst of his armed enemies, delighted at his fall. Some of his most\nintimate associates were also put to death, and their bodies dragged\nabout by the mob.\nCHAPTER VI\nConfusion and riots in the city--Reform of government in opposition to\nthe plebeians--Injuries done to those who favored the plebeians--Michael\ndi Lando banished--Benedetto Alberti hated by the Signory--Fears\nexcited by the coming of Louis of Anjou--The Florentines purchase\nArezzo--Benedetto Alberti becomes suspected and is banished--His\ndiscourse upon leaving the city--Other citizens banished and\nadmonished--War with Giovanni Galeazzo, duke of Milan.\nThe death of Giorgio caused very great excitement; many took arms at\nthe execution in favor of the Signory and the Capitano; and many others,\neither for ambition or as a means for their own safety, did the same.\nThe city was full of conflicting parties, who each had a particular end\nin view, and wished to carry it into effect before they disarmed. The\nancient nobility, called the GREAT, could not bear to be deprived\nof public honors; for the recovery of which they used their utmost\nexertions, and earnestly desired that authority might be restored to the\nCapitani di Parte. The nobles of the people and the major trades were\ndiscontented at the share the minor trades and lowest of the people\npossessed in the government; while the minor trades were desirous of\nincreasing their influence, and the lowest people were apprehensive\nof losing the companies of their trades and the authority which these\nconferred.\nSuch opposing views occasioned Florence, during a year, to be disturbed\nby many riots. Sometimes the nobles of the people took arms; sometimes\nthe major and sometimes the minor trades and the lowest of the people;\nand it often happened that, though in different parts, all were at once\nin insurrection. Hence many conflicts took place between the different\nparties or with the forces of the palace; for the Signory sometimes\nyielding, and at other times resisting, adopted such remedies as they\ncould for these numerous evils. At length, after two assemblies of the\npeople, and many Balias appointed for the reformation of the city; after\nmuch toil, labor, and imminent danger, a government was appointed,\nby which all who had been banished since Salvestro de' Medici was\nGonfalonier were restored. They who had acquired distinctions or\nemoluments by the Balia of 1378 were deprived of them. The honors of\ngovernment were restored to the Guelphic party; the two new Companies of\nthe Trades were dissolved, and all who had been subject to them assigned\nto their former companies. The minor trades were not allowed to elect\nthe Gonfalonier of Justice, their share of honors was reduced from a\nhalf to a third; and those of the highest rank were withdrawn from them\naltogether. Thus the nobles of the people and the Guelphs repossessed\nthemselves of the government, which was lost by the plebeians after it\nhad been in their possession from 1378 to 1381, when these changes took\nplace.\nThe new establishment was not less injurious to the citizens, or less\ntroublesome at its commencement than that of the plebeians had been; for\nmany of the nobles of the people, who had distinguished themselves as\ndefenders of the plebeians, were banished, with a great number of the\nleaders of the latter, among whom was Michael di Lando; nor could all\nthe benefits conferred upon the city by his authority, when in danger\nfrom the lawless mob, save him from the rabid fury of the party that was\nnow in power. His good offices evidently excited little gratitude in\nhis countrymen. The neglect of their benefactors is an error into which\nprinces and republics frequently fall; and hence mankind, alarmed by\nsuch examples, as soon as they begin to perceive the ingratitude of\ntheir rulers, set themselves against them.\nAs these banishments and executions had always been offensive to\nBenedetto Alberti, they continued to disgust him, and he censured them\nboth publicly and privately. The leaders of the government began to\nfear him, for they considered him one of the most earnest friends of\nthe plebeians, and thought he had not consented to the death of Giorgio\nScali from disapprobation of his proceeding, but that he might be left\nhimself without a rival in the government. His discourse and his conduct\nalike served to increase their suspicions, so that all the ruling party\nhad their eyes upon him, and eagerly sought an opportunity of crushing\nhim.\nDuring this state of things, external affairs were not of serious\nimportance, for some which ensued were productive of apprehension rather\nthan of injury. At this time Louis of Anjou came into Italy, to recover\nthe kingdom of Naples for Queen Giovanna, and drive out Charles of\nDurazzo. His coming terrified the Florentines; for Charles, according\nto the custom of old friends, demanded their assistance, and Louis,\nlike those who seek new alliances, required their neutrality. The\nFlorentines, that they might seem to comply with the request of Louis,\nand at the same time assist Charles, discharged from their service\nSir John Hawkwood, and transferred him to that of Pope Urban, who was\nfriendly to Charles; but this deceit was at once detected, and Louis\nconsidered himself greatly injured by the Florentines. While the war\nwas carried on between Louis and Charles in Puglia, new forces were sent\nfrom France in aid of Louis, and on arriving in Tuscany, were by the\nemigrants of Arezzo conducted to that city, and took it from those who\nheld possession for Charles. And when they were about to change the\ngovernment of Florence, as they had already done that of Arezzo, Louis\ndied, and the order of things in Puglia and in Tuscany was changed\naccordingly; for Charles secured the kingdom, which had been all but\nlost, and the Florentines, who were apprehensive for their own city,\npurchased Arezzo from those who held it for Louis. Charles, having\nsecured Puglia, went to take possession of Hungary, to which he was\nheir, leaving, with his wife, his children Ladislaus and Giovanna, who\nwere yet infants. He took possession of Hungary, but was soon after\nslain there.\nAs great rejoicings were made in Florence on account of this acquisition\nas ever took place in any city for a real victory, which served to\nexhibit the public and private wealth of the people, many families\nendeavoring to vie with the state itself in displays of magnificence.\nThe Alberti surpassed all others; the tournaments and exhibitions made\nby them were rather suitable for a sovereign prince than for any private\nindividuals. These things increased the envy with which the family was\nregarded, and being joined with suspicions which the state entertained\nof Benedetto, were the causes of his ruin. The rulers could not endure\nhim, for it appeared as if, at any moment, something might occur,\nwhich, with the favor of his friends, would enable him to recover\nhis authority, and drive them out of the city. While in this state of\nsuspicion and jealousy, it happened that while he was Gonfalonier of the\nCompanies, his son-in-law, Filippo Magalotti, was drawn Gonfalonier of\nJustice; and this circumstance increased the fears of the government,\nfor they thought it would strengthen Benedetto's influence, and place\nthe state in the greater peril. Anxious to provide a remedy, without\ncreating much disturbance, they induced Bese Magalotti, his relative and\nenemy, to signify to the Signory that Filippo, not having attained the\nage required for the exercise of that office, neither could nor ought to\nhold it.\nThe question was examined by the signors, and part of them out of\nhatred, others in order to avoid disunion among themselves, declared\nFilippo ineligible to the dignity, and in his stead was drawn Bardo\nMancini, who was quite opposed to the plebeian interests, and an\ninveterate foe of Benedetto. This man, having entered upon the duties\nof his office, created a _Balia_ for the reformation of the state, which\nbanished Benedetto Alberti and admonished all the rest of his family\nexcept Antonio. Before his departure, Benedetto called them together,\nand observing their melancholy demeanor, said, \"You see, my fathers, and\nyou the elders of our house, how fortune has ruined me and threatened\nyou. I am not surprised at this, neither ought you to be so, for it\nalways happens thus to those who among a multitude of the wicked, wish\nto act rightly, and endeavor to sustain, what the many seek to destroy.\nThe love of my country made me take part with Salvestro de Medici and\nafterward separated me from Giorgio Scali. The same cause compelled me\nto detest those who now govern, who having none to punish them, will\nallow no one to reprove their misdeeds. I am content that my banishment\nshould deliver them from the fears they entertain, not of me only, but\nof all who they think perceives or is acquainted wit their tyrannical\nand wicked proceedings; and they have aimed their first blow at me, in\norder the more easily to oppress you. I do not grieve on my own account;\nfor those honors which my country bestowed upon me while free, she\ncannot in her slavery take from me; and the recollection of my past\nlife will always give me greater pleasure than the pain imparted by the\nsorrows of exile. I deeply regret that my country is left a prey to the\ngreediness and pride of the few who keep her in subjection. I grieve for\nyou; for I fear that the evils which this day cease to affect me, and\ncommence with you, will pursue you with even greater malevolence than\nthey have me. Comfort, then, each other; resolve to bear up against\nevery misfortune, and conduct yourselves in such a manner, that when\ndisasters befall you (and there will be many), every one may know they\nhave come upon you undeservedly.\" Not to give a worse impression of\nhis virtue abroad than he had done at home, he made a journey to the\nsepulcher of Christ, and while upon his return, died at Rhodes. His\nremains were brought to Florence, and interred with all possible honors,\nby those who had persecuted him, when alive, with every species of\ncalumny and injustice.\nThe family of the Alberti was not the only injured party during these\ntroubles of the city; for many others were banished and admonished. Of\nthe former were Piero Benini, Matteo Alderotti, Giovanni and Francesco\ndel Bene, Giovanni Benci, Andrea Adimari, and with them many members of\nthe minor trades. Of the admonished were the Covini, Benini, Rinucci,\nFormiconi, Corbizzi, Manelli, and Alderotti. It was customary to create\nthe Balia for a limited time; and when the citizens elected had effected\nthe purpose of their appointment, they resigned the office from motives\nof good feeling and decency, although the time allowed might not have\nexpired. In conformity with this laudable practice, the Balia of that\nperiod, supposing they had accomplished all that was expected of them,\nwished to retire; but when the multitude were acquainted with their\nintention, they ran armed to the palace, and insisted, that before\nresigning their power, many other persons should be banished and\nadmonished. This greatly displeased the signors; but without disclosing\nthe extent of their displeasure, they contrived to amuse the multitude\nwith promises, till they had assembled a sufficient body of armed men,\nand then took such measures, that fear induced the people to lay aside\nthe weapons which madness had led them to take up. Nevertheless, in some\ndegree to gratify the fury of the mob, and to reduce the authority of\nthe plebeian trades, it was provided, that as the latter had previously\npossessed a third of the honors, they should in future have only a\nfourth. That there might always be two of the signors particularly\ndevoted to the government, they gave authority to the Gonfalonier of\nJustice, and four others, to form a ballot-purse of select citizens,\nfrom which, in every Signory, two should be drawn.\nThis government from its establishment in 1381, till the alterations\nnow made, had continued six years; and the internal peace of the city\nremained undisturbed until 1393. During this time, Giovanni Galeazzo\nVisconti, usually called the Count of Virt\u00fa, imprisoned his uncle\nBernabo, and thus became sovereign of the whole of Lombardy. As he had\nbecome duke of Milan by fraud, he designed to make himself king of Italy\nby force. In 1391 he commenced a spirited attack upon the Florentines;\nbut such various changes occurred in the course of the war, that he\nwas frequently in greater danger than the Florentines themselves, who,\nthough they made a brave and admirable defense, for a republic, must\nhave been ruined, if he had survived. As it was, the result was attended\nwith infinitely less evil than their fears of so powerful an enemy had\nled them to apprehend; for the duke having taken Bologna, Pisa, Perugia,\nand Sienna, and prepared a diadem with which to be crowned king of Italy\nat Florence, died before he had tasted the fruit of his victories, or\nthe Florentines began to feel the effect of their disasters.\nCHAPTER VII\nMaso degli Albizzi--His violence excites the anger of the people--They\nhave recourse to Veri de' Medici--The modesty of Veri--He refuses to\nassume the dignity of prince, and appeases the people--Discourse of\nVeri to the Signory--The banished Florentines endeavor to return--They\nsecretly enter the city and raise a tumult--Some of them slain, others\ntaken to the church of St. Reparata--A conspiracy of exiles supported\nby the duke of Milan--The conspiracy discovered and the parties\npunished--Various enterprises of the Florentines--Taking of Pisa--War\nwith the king of Naples--Acquisition of Cortona.\nDuring the war with the duke of Milan the office of Gonfalonier of\nJustice fell to Maso degli Albizzi, who by the death of Piero in 1379,\nhad become the inveterate enemy of the Alberti: and as party feeling is\nincapable either of repose or abatement, he determined, notwithstanding\nBenedetto had died in exile, that before the expiration of his\nmagistracy, he would revenge himself on the remainder of that family.\nHe seized the opportunity afforded by a person, who on being examined\nrespecting correspondence maintained with the rebels, accused Andrea and\nAlberto degli Alberti of such practices. They were immediately arrested,\nwhich so greatly excited the people, that the Signory, having provided\nthemselves with an armed force, called the citizens to a general\nassembly or parliament, and appointed a Balia, by whose authority many\nwere banished, and a new ballot for the offices of government was made.\nAmong the banished were nearly all the Alberti; many members of the\ntrades were admonished, and some put to death. Stung by these numerous\ninjuries, the trades and the lowest of the people rose in arms,\nconsidering themselves despoiled both of honor and life. One body of\nthem assembled in the piazza; another ran to the house of Veri de'\nMedici, who, after the death of Salvestro, was head of the family. The\nSignory, in order to appease those who came to the piazza or court of\nthe palace, gave them for leaders, with the ensigns of the Guelphs\nand of the people in their hands, Rinaldo Gianfigliazzi, and Donato\nAcciajuoli, both men of the popular class, and more attached to the\ninterests of the plebeians than any other. Those who went to the house\nof Veri de' Medici, begged that he would be pleased to undertake the\ngovernment, and free them from the tyranny of those citizens who were\ndestroying the peace and safety of the commonwealth.\nIt is agreed by all who have written concerning the events of this\nperiod, that if Veri had had more ambition than integrity he might\nwithout any impediment have become prince of the city; for the unfeeling\ntreatment which, whether right or wrong, had been inflicted upon the\ntrades and their friends, had so excited the minds of men to vengeance,\nthat all they required was some one to be their leader. Nor were there\nwanting those who could inform him of the state of public feeling; for\nAntonio de' Medici with whom he had for some time been upon terms of\nmost intimate friendship, endeavored to persuade him to undertake the\ngovernment of the republic. To this Veri replied: \"Thy menaces when thou\nwert my enemy, never alarmed me; nor shall thy counsel, now when thou\nart my friend, do me any harm.\" Then, turning toward the multitude,\nhe bade them be of good cheer; for he would be their defender, if they\nwould allow themselves to be advised by him. He then went, accompanied\nby a great number of citizens, to the piazza, and proceeded directly to\nthe audience chamber of the Signory, whom he addressed to this effect:\nThat he could not regret having lived so as to gain the love of the\nFlorentines; but he was sorry they had formed an opinion of him which\nhis past life had not warranted; for never having done anything that\ncould be construed as either factious or ambitious, he could not imagine\nhow it had happened, that they should think him willing to stir up\nstrife as a discontented person, or usurp the government of his country\nlike an ambitious one. He therefore begged that the infatuation of the\nmultitude might not injure him in their estimation; for, to the utmost\nof his power, their authority should be restored. He then recommended\nthem to use good fortune with moderation; for it would be much better to\nenjoy an imperfect victory with safety to the city, than a complete\none at her ruin. The Signory applauded Veri's conduct; begged he would\nendeavor to prevent recourse to arms, and promised that what he and\nthe other citizens might deem most advisable should be done. Veri then\nreturned to the piazza, where the people who had followed him were\njoined by those led by Donato and Rinaldo, and informed the united\ncompanies that he had found the Signory most kindly disposed toward\nthem; that many things had been taken into consideration, which\nthe shortness of time, and the absence of the magistrates, rendered\nincapable of being finished. He therefore begged they would lay down\ntheir arms and obey the Signory; assuring them that humility would\nprevail rather than pride, entreaties rather than threats; and if\nthey would take his advice, their privileges and security would remain\nunimpaired. He thus induced them to return peaceably to their homes.\nThe disturbance having subsided, the Signory armed the piazza,\nenrolled 2,000 of the most trusty citizens, who were divided equally\nby Gonfalons, and ordered to be in readiness to give their assistance\nwhenever required; and they forbade the use of arms to all who were\nnot thus enrolled. Having adopted these precautionary measures, they\nbanished and put to death many of those members of the trades who had\nshown the greatest audacity in the late riots; and to invest the office\nof Gonfalonier of Justice with more authoritative majesty, they ordered\nthat no one should be eligible to it, under forty-five years of age.\nMany other provisions for the defense of the state were made, which\nappeared intolerable to those against whom they were directed, and were\nodious even to the friends of the Signory themselves, for they could not\nbelieve a government to be either good or secure, which needed so much\nviolence for its defense, a violence excessively offensive, not only to\nthose of the Alberti who remained in the city, and to the Medici, who\nfelt themselves injured by these proceedings, but also to many others.\nThe first who attempted resistance was Donato, the son of Jacopo\nAcciajuoli, who thought of great authority, and the superior rather than\nthe equal of Maso degli Albizzi (who on account of the events which took\nplace while he was Gonfalonier of Justice, was almost at the head of the\nrepublic), could not enjoy repose amid such general discontent, or,\nlike many others, convert social evils to his own private advantage,\nand therefore resolved to attempt the restoration of the exiles to their\ncountry, or at least their offices to the admonished. He went from one\nto another, disseminating his views, showing that the people would not\nbe satisfied, or the ferment of parties subside, without the changes\nhe proposed; and declared that if he were in the Signory, he would soon\ncarry them into effect. In human affairs, delay causes tedium, and haste\ndanger. To avoid what was tedious, Donato Acciajuoli resolved to attempt\nwhat involved danger. Michele Acciajuoli his relative, and Niccolo\nRicoveri his friend, were of the Signory. This seemed to Donato a\nconjuncture of circumstances too favorable to be lost, and he requested\nthey would propose a law to the councils, which would include the\nrestoration of the citizens. They, at his entreaty, spoke about the\nmatter to their associates, who replied, that it was improper to attempt\nany innovation in which the advantage was doubtful and the danger\ncertain. Upon this, Donato, having in vain tried all other means he\ncould think of, excited with anger, gave them to understand that since\nthey would not allow the city to be governed with peaceful measures,\nhe would try what could be done with arms. These words gave so great\noffense, that being communicated to the heads of the government, Donato\nwas summoned, and having appeared, the truth was proven by those to whom\nhe had intrusted the message, and he was banished to Barletta. Alamanno\nand Antonio de' Medici were also banished, and all those of that\nfamily, who were descended from Alamanno, with many who, although of\nthe inferior artificers, possessed influence with the plebeians. These\nevents took place two years after the reform of government effected by\nMaso degli Albizzi.\nAt this time many discontented citizens were at home, and others\nbanished in the adjoining states. Of the latter there lived at Bologna\nPicchio Cavicciulli, Tommaso de' Ricci, Antonio de' Medici, Benedetto\ndegli Spini, Antonio Girolami, Cristofano di Carlone, and two others\nof the lowest order, all bold young men, and resolved upon returning to\ntheir country at any hazard. These were secretly told by Piggiello and\nBaroccio Cavicciulli, who, being admonished, lived in Florence, that\nif they came to the city they should be concealed in their house; from\nwhich they might afterward issue, slay Maso degli Albizzi, and call\nthe people to arms, who, full of discontent, would willingly arise,\nparticularly as they would be supported by the Ricci, Adimari, Medici,\nManelli, and many other families. Excited with these hopes, on the\nfourth of August, 1397, they came to Florence, and having entered\nunobserved according to their arrangement, they sent one of their party\nto watch Maso, designing with his death to raise the people. Maso was\nobserved to leave his house and proceed to that of an apothecary, near\nthe church of San Pietro Maggiore, which he entered. The man who went\nto watch him ran to give information to the other conspirators, who took\ntheir arms and hastened to the house of the apothecary, but found\nthat Maso had gone. However, undaunted with the failure of their first\nattempt, they proceeded to the Old Market, where they slew one of the\nadverse party, and with loud cries of \"people, arms, liberty, and death\nto the tyrants,\" directed their course toward the New Market, and at the\nend of the Calimala slew another. Pursuing their course with the same\ncries, and finding no one join them in arms, they stopped at the Loggia\nNighittosa, where, from an elevated situation, being surrounded with\na great multitude, assembled to look on rather than assist them, they\nexhorted the men to take arms and deliver themselves from the slavery\nwhich weighed so heavily upon them; declaring that the complaints of the\ndiscontented in the city, rather than their own grievances, had induced\nthem to attempt their deliverance. They had heard that many prayed to\nGod for an opportunity of avenging themselves, and vowed they would\nuse it whenever they found anyone to conduct them; but now, when the\nfavorable circumstances occurred, and they found those who were ready to\nlead them, they stared at each other like men stupefied, and would wait\ntill those who were endeavoring to recover for them their liberty\nwere slain, and their own chains more strongly riveted upon them; they\nwondered that those who were wont to take arms upon slight occasions,\nremained unmoved under the pressure of so many and so great evils; and\nthat they could willingly suffer such numbers of their fellow-citizens\nto be banished, so many admonished, when it was in their power to\nrestore the banished to their country, and the admonished to the honors\nof the state. These words, although full of truth, produced no effect\nupon those to whom they were addressed; for they were either restrained\nby their fears, or, on account of the two murders which had been\ncommitted, disgusted with the parties. Thus the movers of the tumult,\nfinding that neither words or deeds had force sufficient to stir anyone,\nsaw, when too late, how dangerous a thing it is to attempt to set a\npeople free who are resolved to be slaves; and, despairing of success,\nthey withdrew to the temple of Santa Reparata, where, not to save their\nlives, but to defer the moment of their deaths, they shut themselves up.\nUpon the first rumor of the affair, the Signory being in fear, armed and\nsecured the palace; but when the facts of the case were understood,\nthe parties known, and whither they had betaken themselves, their fears\nsubsided, and they sent the Capitano with a sufficient body of armed\nmen to secure them. The gates of the temple were forced without much\ntrouble; part of the conspirators were slain defending themselves;\nthe remainder were made prisoners and examined, but none were found\nimplicated in the affair except Baroccio and Piggiello Cavicciulli, who\nwere put to death with them.\nShortly after this event, another occurred of greater importance. The\nFlorentines were, as we have before remarked, at war with the duke of\nMilan, who, finding that with merely open force he could not overcome\nthem, had recourse to secret practices, and with the assistance of the\nexiles of whom Lombardy was full, he formed a plot to which many in the\ncity were accessory. It was resolved by the conspirators that most of\nthe emigrants, capable of bearing arms, should set out from the places\nnearest Florence, enter the city by the river Arno, and with their\nfriends hasten to the residences of the chiefs of the government; and\nhaving slain them, reform the republic according to their own will. Of\nthe conspirators within the city, was one of the Ricci named Samminiato;\nand as it often happens in treacherous practices, few are insufficient\nto effect the purpose of the plot, and among many secrecy cannot be\npreserved, so while Samminiato was in quest of associates, he found an\naccuser. He confided the affair to Salvestro Cavicciulli, whose wrongs\nand those of his friends were thought sufficient to make him faithful;\nbut he, more influenced by immediate fear than the hope of future\nvengeance, discovered the whole affair to the Signory, who, having\ncaused Samminiato to be taken, compelled him to tell all the particulars\nof the matter. However, none of the conspirators were taken, except\nTommaso Davizi, who, coming from Bologna, and unaware of what had\noccurred at Florence, was seized immediately upon his arrival. All the\nothers had fled immediately upon the apprehension of Samminiato.\nSamminiato and Tommaso having been punished according to their deserts,\na Balia was formed of many citizens, which sought the delinquents, and\ntook measures for the security of the state. They declared six of the\nfamily of the Ricci rebels; also, six of the Alberti; two of the Medici;\nthree of the Scali; two of the Strozzi; Bindo Altoviti, Bernado Adimari,\nand many others of inferior quality. They admonished all the family\nof the Alberti, the Ricci, and the Medici for ten years, except a few\nindividuals. Among the Alberti, not admonished, was Antonio, who was\nthought to be quiet and peaceable. It happened, however, before all\nsuspicion of the conspiracy had ceased, a monk was taken who had been\nobserved during its progress to pass frequently between Bologna and\nFlorence. He confessed that he had often carried letters to Antonio,\nwho was immediately seized, and, though he denied all knowledge of the\nmatter from the first, the monk's accusation prevailed, and he was fined\nin a considerable sum of money, and banished a distance of three hundred\nmiles from Florence. That the Alberti might not constantly place the\ncity in jeopardy, every member of the family was banished whose age\nexceeded fifteen years.\nThese events took place in the year 1400, and two years afterward, died\nGiovanni Galeazzo, duke of Milan, whose death as we have said above, put\nan end to the war, which had then continued twelve years. At this time,\nthe government having gained greater strength, and being without\nenemies external or internal, undertook the conquest of Pisa, and having\ngloriously completed it, the peace of the city remained undisturbed\nfrom 1400 to 1433, except that in 1412, the Alberti, having crossed the\nboundary they were forbidden to pass, a Balia was formed which with new\nprovisions fortified the state and punished the offenders with heavy\nfines. During this period also, the Florentines made war with Ladislaus,\nking of Naples, who finding himself in great danger ceded to them the\ncity of Cortona of which he was master; but soon afterward, recovering\nhis power, he renewed the war, which became far more disastrous to the\nFlorentines than before; and had it not, in 1414, been terminated by his\ndeath, as that of Lombardy had been by the death of the duke of Milan,\nhe, like the duke, would have brought Florence into great danger of\nlosing her liberty. Nor was the war with the king concluded with less\ngood fortune than the former; for when he had taken Rome, Sienna, the\nwhole of La Marca and Romagna, and had only Florence itself to vanquish,\nhe died. Thus death has always been more favorable to the Florentines\nthan any other friend, and more potent to save them than their own\nvalor. From the time of the king's decease, peace was preserved both at\nhome and abroad for eight years, at the end of which, with the wars of\nFilippo, duke of Milan, the spirit of faction again broke out, and was\nonly appeased by the ruin of that government which continued from 1381\nto 1434, had conducted with great glory so many enterprises; acquired\nArezzo, Pisa, Cortona, Leghorn, and Monte Pulciano; and would have\naccomplished more if the citizens had lived in unity, and had not\nrevived former factions; as in the following book will be particularly\nshown.\nBOOK IV\nCHAPTER I\nLicense and Slavery peculiar defects in republican\ngovernments--Application of this reflection to the state of\nFlorence--Giovanni di Bicci di' Medici re-establishes the authority of\nhis family--Filippo Visconti, duke of Milan, endeavors to make amicable\narrangements with the Florentines--Their jealousy of him--Precautionary\nmeasures against him--War declared--The Florentines are routed by the\nducal forces.\nRepublican governments, more especially those imperfectly organized,\nfrequently change their rulers and the form of their institutions; not\nby the influence of liberty or subjection, as many suppose, but by\nthat of slavery and license; for with the nobility or the people, the\nministers respectively of slavery or licentiousness, only the name of\nliberty is in any estimation, neither of them choosing to be subject\neither to magistrates or laws. When, however, a good, wise, and powerful\ncitizen appears (which is but seldom), who establishes ordinances\ncapable of appeasing or restraining these contending dispositions, so as\nto prevent them from doing mischief, then the government may be called\nfree, and its institutions firm and secure; for having good laws for its\nbasis, and good regulations for carrying them into effect, it needs\nnot, like others, the virtue of one man for its maintenance. With such\nexcellent laws and institutions, many of those ancient republics, which\nwere of long duration, were endowed. But these advantages are, and\nalways have been, denied to those which frequently change from tyranny\nto license, or the reverse; because, from the powerful enemies which\neach condition creates itself, they neither have, nor can possess any\nstability; for tyranny cannot please the good, and license is offensive\nto the wise: the former may easily be productive of mischief, while the\nlatter can scarcely be beneficial; in the former, the insolent have too\nmuch authority, and in the latter, the foolish; so that each requires\nfor their welfare the virtue and the good fortune of some individual who\nmay be removed by death, or become unserviceable by misfortune.\nHence, it appears, that the government which commenced in Florence at\nthe death of Giorgio Scali, in 1381, was first sustained by the talents\nof Maso degli Albizzi, and then by those of Niccolo da Uzzano. The city\nremained tranquil from 1414 to 1422; for King Ladislaus was dead, and\nLombardy divided into several parts; so that there was nothing either\ninternal or external to occasion uneasiness. Next to Niccolo da Uzzano\nin authority, were Bartolomeo Valori, Neroni di Nigi, Rinaldo degli\nAlbizzi, Neri di Gino, and Lapo Niccolini. The factions that arose from\nthe quarrels of the Albizzi and the Ricci, and which were afterward so\nunhappily revived by Salvestro de' Medici, were never extinguished; for\nthough the party most favored by the rabble only continued three\nyears, and in 1381 was put down, still, as it comprehended the greatest\nnumerical proportion, it was never entirely extinct, though the frequent\nBalias and persecutions of its leaders from 1381 to 1400, reduced it\nalmost to nothing. The first families that suffered in this way were the\nAlberti, the Ricci, and the Medici, which were frequently deprived both\nof men and money; and if any of them remained in the city, they were\ndeprived of the honors of government. These oft-repeated acts of\noppression humiliated the faction, and almost annihilated it. Still,\nmany retained the remembrance of the injuries they had received, and\na desire of vengeance remained pent in their bosoms, ungratified and\nunquenched. Those nobles of the people, or new nobility, who peaceably\ngoverned the city, committed two errors, which eventually caused the\nruin of their party; the first was, that by long continuance in power\nthey became insolent; the second, that the envy they entertained toward\neach other, and their uninterrupted possession of power, destroyed that\nvigilance over those who might injure them, which they ought to have\nexercised. Thus daily renewing the hatred of a mass of the people by\ntheir sinister proceedings, and either negligent of the threatened\ndangers, because rendered fearless by prosperity, or encouraging them\nthrough mutual envy, they gave an opportunity to the family of the\nMedici to recover their influence. The first to do so was Giovanni di\nBicci de' Medici, who having become one of the richest men, and being of\na humane and benevolent disposition, obtained the supreme magistracy\nby the consent of those in power. This circumstance gave so much\ngratification to the mass of the people (the multitude thinking they had\nnow found a defender), that not without occasion the judicious of the\nparty observed it with jealousy, for they perceived all the former\nfeelings of the city revived. Niccolo da Uzzano did not fail to acquaint\nthe other citizens with the matter, explaining to them how dangerous it\nwas to aggrandize one who possessed so much influence; that it was easy\nto remedy an evil at its commencement, but exceedingly difficult after\nhaving allowed it to gather strength; and that Giovanni possessed\nseveral qualities far surpassing those of Salvestro. The associates of\nNiccolo were uninfluenced by his remarks; for they were jealous of his\nreputation, and desired to exalt some person, by means of whom he might\nbe humbled.\nThis was the state of Florence, in which opposing feelings began to\nbe observable, when Filippo Visconti, second son of Giovanni Galeazzo,\nhaving, by the death of his brother, become master of all Lombardy, and\nthinking he might undertake almost anything, greatly desired to recover\nGenoa, which enjoyed freedom under the Dogiate of Tommaso da Campo\nFregoso. He did not think it advisable to attempt this, or any other\nenterprise, till he had renewed amicable relations with the Florentines,\nand made his good understanding with them known; but with the aid of\ntheir reputation he trusted he should attain his wishes. He therefore\nsent ambassadors to Florence to signify his desires. Many citizens were\nopposed to his design, but did not wish to interrupt the peace with\nMilan, which had now continued for many years. They were fully aware of\nthe advantages he would derive from a war with Genoa, and the little use\nit would be to Florence. Many others were inclined to accede to it, but\nwould set a limit to his proceedings, which, if he were to exceed, all\nwould perceive his base design, and thus they might, when the treaty was\nbroken, more justifiably make war against him. The question having been\nstrongly debated, an amicable arrangement was at length effected, by\nwhich Filippo engaged not to interfere with anything on the Florentine\nside of the rivers Magra and Panaro.\nSoon after the treaty was concluded, the duke took possession of\nBrescia, and shortly afterward of Genoa, contrary to the expectation\nof those who had advocated peace; for they thought Brescia would be\ndefended by the Venetians, and Genoa would be able to defend herself.\nAnd as in the treaty which Filippo made with the Doge of Genoa, he had\nacquired Serezana and other places situated on this side the Magra, upon\ncondition that, if he wished to alienate them, they should be given to\nthe Genoese, it was quite palpable that he had broken the treaty; and he\nhad, besides, entered into another treaty with the legate of Bologna,\nin opposition to his engagement respecting the Panaro. These things\ndisturbed the minds of the citizens, and made them, apprehensive of new\ntroubles, consider the means to be adopted for their defense.\nThe dissatisfaction of the Florentines coming to the knowledge of\nFilippo, he, either to justify himself, or to become acquainted with\ntheir prevailing feelings, or to lull them to repose, sent ambassadors\nto the city, to intimate that he was greatly surprised at the suspicions\nthey entertained, and offered to revoke whatever he had done that could\nbe thought a ground of jealousy. This embassy produced no other\neffect than that of dividing the citizens; one party, that in greatest\nreputation, judged it best to arm, and prepare to frustrate the enemy's\ndesigns; and if he were to remain quiet, it would not be necessary to go\nto war with him, but an endeavor might be made to preserve peace. Many\nothers, whether envious of those in power, or fearing a rupture with the\nduke, considered it unadvisable so lightly to entertain suspicions of\nan ally, and thought his proceedings need not have excited so much\ndistrust; that appointing the ten and hiring forces was in itself a\nmanifest declaration of war, which, if undertaken against so great a\nprince, would bring certain ruin upon the city without the hope of any\nadvantage; for possession could never be retained of the conquests that\nmight be made, because Romagna lay between, and the vicinity of the\nchurch ought to prevent any attempt against Romagna itself. However the\nviews of those who were in favor of war prevailed, the Council of Ten\nwere appointed, forces were hired, and new taxes levied, which, as they\nwere more burdensome upon the lower than the upper ranks, filled the\ncity with complaints, and all condemned the ambition and avarice of the\ngreat, declaring that, to gratify themselves and oppress the people,\nthey would go to war without any justifiable motive.\nThey had not yet come to an open rupture with the duke, but everything\ntended to excite suspicion; for Filippo had, at the request of the\nlegate of Bologna (who was in fear of Antonio Bentivogli, an emigrant\nof Bologna at Castel Bolognese), sent forces to that city, which,\nbeing close upon the Florentine territory, filled the citizens with\napprehension; but what gave every one greater alarm, and offered\nsufficient occasion for the declaration of war, was the expedition made\nby the duke against Furli. Giorgio Ordelaffi was lord of Furli, who\ndying, left Tibaldo, his son, under the guardianship of Filippo. The\nboy's mother, suspicious of his guardian, sent him to Lodovico Alidossi,\nher father, who was lord of Imola, but she was compelled by the people\nof Furli to obey the will of her deceased husband, to withdraw him from\nthe natural guardian, and place him in the hands of the duke. Upon\nthis Filippo, the better to conceal his purpose, caused the Marquis of\nFerrara to send Guido Torello as his agent, with forces, to seize the\ngovernment of Furli, and thus the territory fell into the duke's hands.\nWhen this was known at Florence, together with the arrival of forces at\nBologna, the arguments in favor of war were greatly strengthened, but\nthere were still many opposed to it, and among the rest Giovanni de'\nMedici, who publicly endeavored to show, that even if the ill designs of\nthe duke were perfectly manifest, it would still be better to wait and\nlet him commence the attack, than to assail him; for in the former case\nthey would be justified in the view of the princes of Italy as well as\nin their own; but if they were to strike the first blow at the duke,\npublic opinion would be as favorable to him as to themselves; and\nbesides, they could not so confidently demand assistance as assailants,\nas they might do if assailed; and that men always defend themselves more\nvigorously when they attack others. The advocates of war considered it\nimproper to await the enemy in their houses, and better to go and seek\nhim; that fortune is always more favorable to assailants than to such\nas merely act on the defensive, and that it is less injurious, even when\nattended with greater immediate expense, to make war at another's door\nthan at our own. These views prevailed, and it was resolved that the ten\nshould provide all the means in their power for rescuing Furli from the\nhands of the duke.\nFilippo, finding the Florentines resolved to occupy the places he had\nundertaken to defend, postponed all personal considerations, and sent\nAgnolo della Pergola with a strong force against Imola, that Ludovico,\nhaving to provide for the defense of his own possessions, might be\nunable to protect the interests of his grandson. Agnolo approached Imola\nwhile the forces of the Florentines were at Modigliana, and an intense\nfrost having rendered the ditches of the city passable, he crossed them\nduring the night, captured the place, and sent Lodovico a prisoner to\nMilan. The Florentines finding Imola in the hands of the enemy, and the\nwar publicly known, sent their forces to Furli and besieged it on all\nsides. That the duke's people might not relieve it, they hired Count\nAlberigo, who from Zagonara, his own domain, overran the country daily,\nup to the gates of Imola. Agnolo della Pergola, finding the strong\nposition which the Florentines had taken prevented him from relieving\nFurli, determined to attempt the capture of Zagonara, thinking they\nwould not allow that place to be lost, and that in the endeavor to\nrelieve it they would be compelled to give up their design against\nFurli, and come to an engagement under great disadvantage. Thus the\nduke's people compelled Alberigo to sue for terms, which he obtained on\ncondition of giving up Zagonara, if the Florentines did not relieve him\nwithin fifteen days. This misfortune being known in the Florentine camp\nand in the city, and all being anxious that the enemy should not obtain\nthe expected advantage, they enabled him to secure a greater; for\nhaving abandoned the siege of Furli to go to the relief of Zagonara, on\nencountering the enemy they were soon routed, not so much by the bravery\nof their adversaries as by the severity of the season; for, having\nmarched many hours through deep mud and heavy rain, they found the enemy\nquite fresh, and were therefore easily vanquished. Nevertheless, in\nthis great defeat, famous throughout all Italy, no death occurred except\nthose of Lodovico degli Obizi and two of his people, who having fallen\nfrom their horses were drowned in the morass.\nCHAPTER II\nThe Florentines murmur against those who had been advocates of the\nwar--Rinaldo degli Albizzi encourages the citizens--Measures for the\nprosecution of the war--Attempt of the higher classes to deprive the\nplebeians of their share in the government--Rinaldo degli Albizzi\naddresses an assembly of citizens and advises the restoration of the\n_Grandi_--Niccolo da Uzzano wishes to have Giovanni de' Medici on their\nside--Giovanni disapproves of the advice of Rinaldo degli Albizzi.\nThe defeat at Zagonara spread consternation throughout Florence; but\nnone felt it so severely as the nobility, who had been in favor of the\nwar; for they perceived their enemies to be inspirited and themselves\ndisarmed, without friends, and opposed by the people, who at the corners\nof streets insulted them with sarcastic expressions, complaining of the\nheavy taxes, and the unnecessary war, and saying, \"Oh! they appointed\nthe ten to frighten the enemy. Have they relieved Furli, and rescued her\nfrom the hands of the duke? No! but their designs have been discovered;\nand what had they in view? not the defense of liberty; for they do not\nlove her; but to aggrandize their own power, which God has very justly\nabated. This is not the only enterprise by many a one with which they\nhave oppressed the city; for the war against King Ladislaus was of a\nsimilar kind. To whom will they flee for assistance now? to Pope Martin,\nwhom they ridiculed before the face of Braccio; or to Queen Giovanna,\nwhom they abandoned, and compelled to throw herself under the protection\nof the king of Aragon?\" To these reproaches was added all that might be\nexpected from an enraged multitude.\nSeeing the discontent so prevalent, the Signory resolved to assemble\na few citizens, and with soft words endeavor to soothe the popular\nirritation. On this occasion, Rinaldo degli Albizzi, the eldest son of\nMaso, who, by his own talents and the respect he derived from the memory\nof his father, aspired to the first offices in the government, spoke at\ngreat length; showing that it is not right to judge of actions merely\nby their effects; for it often happens that what has been very maturely\nconsidered is attended with unfavorable results: that if we are to\napplaud evil counsels because they are sometimes followed by fortunate\nevents, we should only encourage men in error which would bring great\nmischief upon the republic; because evil counsel is not always attended\nwith happy consequences. In the same way, it would be wrong to blame\na wise resolution, because if its being attended with an unfavorable\nissue; for by so doing, we should destroy the inclination of citizens\nto offer advice and speak the truth. He then showed the propriety\nof undertaking the war; and that if it had not been commenced by the\nFlorentines in Romagna the duke would have assailed them in Tuscany. But\nsince it had pleased God, that the Florentine people should be overcome,\ntheir loss would be still greater if they allowed themselves to be\ndejected; but if they set a bold front against adversity, and made good\nuse of the means within their power, they would not be sensible of their\nloss or the duke of his victory. He assured them they ought not to\nbe alarmed by impending expenses and consequent taxation; because the\nlatter might be reduced, and the future expense would not be so great as\nthe former had been; for less preparation is necessary for those engaged\nin self-defense than for those who design to attack others. He advised\nthem to imitate the conduct of their forefathers, who, by courageous\nconduct in adverse circumstances, had defended themselves against all\ntheir enemies.\nThus encouraged, the citizens engaged Count Oddo the son of Braccio,\nand united with him, for directing the operations of the war, Niccolo\nPiccinino, a pupil of his father's, and one of the most celebrated of\nall who had served under him. To these they added other leaders, and\nremounted some of those who had lost their horses in the late defeat.\nThey also appointed twenty citizens to levy new taxes, who finding the\ngreat quite subdued by the recent loss, took courage and drained them\nwithout mercy.\nThese burdens were very grievous to the nobility, who at first, in order\nto conciliate, did not complain of their own particular hardships, but\ncensured the tax generally as unjust, and advised that something should\nbe done in the way of relief; but their advice was rejected in the\nCouncils. Therefore, to render the law as offensive as possible, and to\nmake all sensible of its injustice, they contrived that the taxes should\nbe levied with the utmost rigor, and made it lawful to kill any that\nmight resist the officers employed to collect them. Hence followed many\nlamentable collisions, attended with the blood and death of citizens. It\nbegan to be the impression of all, that arms would be resorted to, and\nall prudent persons apprehended some approaching evil; for the higher\nranks, accustomed to be treated with respect, could not endure to be\nused like dogs; and the rest were desirous that the taxation should be\nequalized. In consequence of this state of things, many of the first\ncitizens met together, and it was resolved that it had become necessary\nfor their safety, that some attempt should be made to recover the\ngovernment; since their want of vigilance had encouraged men to censure\npublic actions, and allowed those to interfere in affairs who had\nhitherto been merely the leaders of the rabble. Having repeatedly\ndiscussed the subject, they resolved to meet again at an appointed hour,\nwhen upwards of seventy citizens assembled in the church of St. Stephen,\nwith the permission of Lorenzo Ridolfi and Francesco Gianfigliazzi, both\nmembers of the Signory. Giovanni de' Medici was not among them either\nbecause being under suspicion he was not invited or that entertaining\ndifferent views he was unwilling to interfere.\nRinaldo degli Albizzi addressed the assembly, describing the condition\nof the city, and showing how by their own negligence it had again fallen\nunder the power of the plebeians, from whom it had been wrested by their\nfathers in 1381. He reminded them of the iniquity of the government\nwhich was in power from 1378 to 1381, and that all who were then present\nhad to lament, some a father, others a grandfather, put to death by its\ntyranny. He assured them they were now in the same danger, and that the\ncity was sinking under the same disorders. The multitude had already\nimposed a tax of its own authority; and would soon, if not restrained\nby greater force or better regulations, appoint the magistrates, who, in\nthis case, would occupy their places, and overturn the government which\nfor forty-two years had ruled the city with so much glory; the citizens\nwould then be subject to the will of the multitude, and live disorderly\nand dangerous, or be under the command of some individual who might make\nhimself prince. For these reasons he was of opinion, that whoever loved\nhis country and his honor must arouse himself, and call to mind the\nvirtue of Bardo Mancini, who, by the ruin of the Alberti, rescued the\ncity from the dangers then impending; and that the cause of the audacity\nnow assumed by the multitude was the extensive Squittini or Pollings,\nwhich, by their negligence, were allowed to be made; for thus the palace\nhad become filled with low men. He therefore concluded, that the\nonly means of remedying the evil was to restore the government to the\nnobility, and diminish the authority of the minor trades by reducing the\ncompanies from fourteen to seven, which would give the plebeians less\nauthority in the Councils, both by the reduction in their number and\nby increasing the authority of the great; who, on account of former\nenmities, would be disinclined to favor them. He added, that it is\na good thing to know how to avail themselves of men according to the\ntimes; and that as their fathers had used the plebeians to reduce the\ninfluence of the great, that now, the great having been humbled, and the\nplebeians become insolent, it was well to restrain the insolence of\nthe latter by the assistance of the former. To effect this they might\nproceed either openly or otherwise, for some of them belonging to the\nCouncil of Ten, forces might be led into the city without exciting\nobservation.\nRinaldo was much applauded, and his advice was approved of by the whole\nassembly. Niccolo da Uzzano who, among others, replied to it, said, \"All\nthat Rinaldo had advanced was correct, and the remedies he proposed good\nand certain, if they could be adopted without an absolute division\nof the city; and this he had no doubt would be effected if they could\ninduce Giovanni de' Medici to join them; for with him on their side,\nthe multitude being deprived of their chief and stay, would be unable\nto oppose them; but that if he did not concur with them they could do\nnothing without arms, and that with them they would incur the risk of\nbeing vanquished, or of not being able to reap the fruit of victory.\" He\nthen modestly reminded them of what he had said upon a former occasion,\nand of their reluctance to remedy the evil when it might easily have\nbeen done; that now the same remedy could not be attempted without\nincurring the danger of greater evils, and therefore there was nothing\nleft for them to do but to gain him over to their side, if practicable.\nRinaldo was then commissioned to wait upon Giovanni and try if he could\ninduce him to join them.\nHe undertook this commission, and in the most prevailing words he could\nmake use of endeavored to induce him to coincide with their views; and\nbegged that he would not by favoring an audacious mob, enable them to\ncomplete the ruin both of the government and the city. To this Giovanni\nreplied, that he considered it the duty of a good and wise citizen to\navoid altering the institutions to which a city is accustomed; there\nbeing nothing so injurious to the people as such a change; for many are\nnecessarily offended, and where there are several discontented, some\nunpropitious event may be constantly apprehended. He said it appeared to\nhim that their resolution would have two exceedingly pernicious effects;\nthe one conferring honors on those who, having never possessed them,\nesteemed them the less, and therefore had the less occasion to grieve\nfor their absence; the other taking them from those who being accustomed\nto their possession would never be at rest till they were restored to\nthem. It would thus be evident that the injury done to one party, was\ngreater than the benefit they had conferred upon the other; so that\nwhoever was the author of the proposition, he would gain few friends and\nmake many enemies, and that the latter would be more resolutely bent\non injuring him than the former would be zealous for his defense, for\nmankind are naturally more disposed to revenge than to gratitude, as\nif the latter could only be exercised with some inconvenience to\nthemselves, while the former brings alike gratification and profit.\nThen, directing his discourse more particularly to Rinaldo, he said,\n\"And you, if you could call to mind past events, and knew how craftily\naffairs are conducted in this city, would not be so eager in this\npursuit; for he who advises it, when by your aid he has wrested the\npower from the people, will, with the people's assistance, who will have\nbecome your enemies, deprive you of it. And it will happen to you as\nto Benedetto Alberti, who, at the persuasion of those who were not his\nfriends, consented to the ruin of Giorgio Scali and Tommaso Strozzi, and\nshortly afterward was himself sent into exile by the very same men.\" He\ntherefore advised Rinaldo to think more maturely of these things, and\nendeavor to imitate his father, who, to obtain the benevolence of all,\nreduced the price of salt, provided that whoever owed taxes under half\na florin should be at liberty to pay them or not, as he thought proper,\nand that at the meeting of the Councils every one should be free from\nthe importunities of his creditors. He concluded by saying, that as\nregarded himself, he was disposed to let the government of the city\nremain as it was.\nCHAPTER III\nGiovanni de' Medici acquires the favor of the people--Bravery of Biaggio\ndel Melano--Baseness of Zanobi del Pino--The Florentines obtain the\nfriendship of the lord of Faenza--League of the Florentines with the\nVenetians--Origin of the Catasto--The rich citizens discontented with\nit--Peace with the duke of Milan--New disturbances on account of the\nCatasto.\nThese events, and the circumstances attending them, becoming known to\nthe people, contributed greatly to increase the reputation of Giovanni,\nand brought odium on those who had made the proposals; but he assumed an\nappearance of indifference, in order to give less encouragement to\nthose who by his influence were desirous of change. In his discourse he\nintimated to every one that it is not desirable to promote factions, but\nrather to extinguish them; and that whatever might be expected of him,\nhe only sought the union of the city. This, however, gave offense to\nmany of his party; for they would have rather seen him exhibit greater\nactivity. Among others so disposed, was Alamanno de' Medici, who being\nof a restless disposition, never ceased exciting him to persecute\nenemies and favor friends; condemning his coldness and slow method\nof proceeding, which he said was the cause of his enemies' practicing\nagainst him, and that these practices would one day effect the ruin of\nhimself and his friends. He endeavored to excite Cosmo, his son, with\nsimilar discourses; but Giovanni, for all that was either disclosed or\nforetold him, remained unmoved, although parties were now declared, and\nthe city in manifest disunion.\nThere were at the palace, in the service of the Signory, two\nchancellors, Ser Martino and Ser Pagolo. The latter favored the party\nof Niccolo da Uzzano, the former that of Giovanni; and Rinaldo, seeing\nGiovanni unwilling to join them, thought it would be advisable to\ndeprive Ser Martino of his office, that he might have the palace\nmore completely under his control. The design becoming known to his\nadversaries, Ser Martino was retained and Ser Pagolo discharged, to the\ngreat injury and displeasure of Rinaldo and his party. This circumstance\nwould soon have produced most mischievous effects, but for the war\nwith which the city was threatened, and the recent defeat suffered at\nZagonara, which served to check the audacity of the people; for while\nthese events were in progress at Florence, Agnolo della Pergola, with\nthe forces of the duke, had taken all the towns and cities possessed\nby the Florentines in Romagna, except Castracaro and Modigliano; partly\nfrom the weakness of the places themselves, and partly by the misconduct\nof those who had the command of them. In the course of the campaign, two\ninstances occurred which served to show how greatly courage is admired\neven in enemies, and how much cowardice and pusillanimity are despised.\nBiaggio del Melano was castellan in the fortress of Monte Petroso. Being\nsurrounded by enemies, and seeing no chance of saving the place, which\nwas already in flames, he cast clothes and straw from a part which was\nnot yet on fire, and upon these he threw his two little children, saying\nto the enemy, \"Take to yourselves those goods which fortune has bestowed\nupon me, and of which you may deprive me; but those of the mind, in\nwhich my honor and glory consist, I will not give up, neither can you\nwrest them from me.\" The besiegers ran to save the children, and placed\nfor their father ropes and ladders, by which to save himself, but he\nwould not use them, and rather chose to die in the flames than owe his\nsafety to the enemies of his country: an example worthy of that much\nlauded antiquity, which offers nothing to surpass it, and which we\nadmire the more from the rarity of any similar occurrence. Whatever\ncould be recovered from the ruins, was restored for the use of the\nchildren, and carefully conveyed to their friends; nor was the republic\nless grateful; for as long as they lived, they were supported at her\ncharge.\nAn example of an opposite character occurred at Galeata, where Zanobi\ndel Pino was governor; he, without offering the least resistance, gave\nup the fortress to the enemy; and besides this, advised Agnolo della\nPergola to leave the Alps of Romagna, and come among the smaller hills\nof Tuscany, where he might carry on the war with less danger and greater\nadvantage. Agnolo could not endure the mean and base spirit of this man,\nand delivered him to his own attendants, who, after many reproaches,\ngave him nothing to eat but paper painted with snakes, saying, that of a\nGuelph they would make him a Ghibelline; and thus fasting, he died in a\nfew days.\nAt this time Count Oddo and Niccolo Piccinino entered the Val di Lamona,\nwith the design of bringing the lord of Faenza over to the Florentines,\nor at least inducing him to restrain the incursions of Agnolo della\nPergola into Romagna; but as this valley is naturally strong, and its\ninhabitants warlike, Count Oddo was slain there, and Niccolo Piccinino\nsent a prisoner to Faenza. Fortune, however, caused the Florentines to\nobtain by their loss, what, perhaps, they would have failed to acquire\nby victory; for Niccolo so prevailed with the lord of Faenza and his\nmother, that they became friends of the Florentines. By this treaty,\nNiccolo Piccinino was set at liberty, but did not take the advice he had\ngiven others; for while in treaty with the city, concerning the terms of\nhis engagement, either the conditions proposed were insufficient, or he\nfound better elsewhere; for quite suddenly he left Arezzo, where he had\nbeen staying, passed into Lombardy, and entered the service of the duke.\nThe Florentines, alarmed by this circumstance, and reduced to\ndespondency by their frequent losses, thought themselves unable to\nsustain the war alone, and sent ambassadors to the Venetians, to beg\nthey would lend their aid to oppose the greatness of one who, if allowed\nto aggrandize himself, would soon become as dangerous to them as to the\nFlorentines themselves. The Venetians were advised to adopt the same\ncourse by Francesco Carmignuola, one of the most distinguished warriors\nof those times, who had been in the service of the duke, and had\nafterward quitted it; but they hesitated, not knowing how far to trust\nhim; for they thought his enmity with the duke was only feigned. While\nin this suspense, it was found that the duke, by means of a servant\nof Carmignuola, had caused poison to be given him in his food, which,\nalthough it was not fatal, reduced him to extremity. The truth being\ndiscovered, the Venetians laid aside their suspicion; and as the\nFlorentines still solicited their assistance, a treaty was formed\nbetween the two powers, by which they agreed to carry on the war at the\ncommon expense of both: the conquests in Lombardy to be assigned to\nthe Venetians; those in Romagna and Tuscany to the Florentines; and\nCarmignuola was appointed Captain General of the League. By this treaty\nthe war was commenced in Lombardy, where it was admirably conducted; for\nin a few months many places were taken from the duke, together with the\ncity of Brescia, the capture of which was in those days considered a\nmost brilliant exploit.\nThe war had continued from 1422 to 1427, and the citizens of Florence\nwere so wearied of the taxes that had been imposed during that time,\nthat it was resolved to revise them, preparatory to their amelioration.\nThat they might be equalized according to the means of each citizen, it\nwas proposed that whoever possessed property of the value of one hundred\nflorins should pay half a florin of taxes. Individual contribution would\nthus be determined by an invariable rule, and not left to the discretion\nof parties; and as it was found that the new method would press heavily\nupon the powerful classes, they used their utmost endeavors to prevent\nit from becoming law. Giovanni de' Medici alone declared himself in\nfavor of it, and by his means it was passed. In order to determine the\namount each had to pay, it was necessary to consider his property in the\naggregate, which the Florentines call _accatastare_, in which in this\napplication of it would signify TO RATE or VALUE, and hence this tax\nreceived the name of _catasto_. The new method of rating formed a\npowerful check to the tyranny of the great, who could no longer oppress\nthe lower classes, or silence them with threats in the council as they\nhad formerly done, and it therefore gave general satisfaction, though to\nthe wealthy classes it was in the highest degree offensive. But as it is\nfound men are never satisfied, but that the possession of one advantage\nonly makes them desire more, the people, not content with the equality\nof taxation which the new law produced, demanded that the same rule\nshould be applied to past years; that in investigation should be made\nto determine how much, according to the Catasto, the rich had paid less\nthan their share, and that they should now pay up to an equality with\nthose who, in order to meet the demand unjustly made, had been compelled\nto sell their possessions. This proposal alarmed the great more than\nthe Catasto had done; and in self-defense they unceasingly decried it,\ndeclaring it in the highest degree unjust in being laid not only on\nimmovable but movable property, which people possess to-day and lose\nto-morrow; that many persons have hidden wealth which the Catasto cannot\nreach; that those who leave their own affairs to manage those of the\nrepublic should be less burdened by her, it being enough for them to\ngive their labour, and that it was unjust of the city to take both\ntheir property and their time, while of others she only took money. The\nadvocates of the Catasto replied, that if movable property varies, the\ntaxes would also vary, and frequently rating it would remedy the evil\nto which it was subject; that it was unnecessary to mention those who\npossessed hidden property; for it would be unreasonable to take taxes\nfor that which produced no interest, and that if it paid anything, it\ncould not fail to be discovered: that those who did not like to labor\nfor the republic might cease to do so; for no doubt she would find\nplenty of loving citizens who would take pleasure in assisting her\nwith both money and counsel: that the advantages and honors of a\nparticipation in the government are so great, that of themselves they\nare a sufficient remuneration to those who thus employ themselves,\nwithout wishing to be excused from paying their share of taxes. But,\nthey added, the real grievance had not been mentioned: for those who\nwere offended with the Catasto, regretted they could no longer involve\nthe city in all the difficulties of war without injury to themselves,\nnow that they had to contribute like the rest; and that if this law had\nthen been in force they would not have gone to war with King Ladislaus,\nor the Duke Filippo, both which enterprises had been not through\nnecessity, but to impoverish the citizens. The excitement was appeased\nby Giovanni de' Medici, who said, \"It is not well to go into things so\nlong past, unless to learn something for our present guidance; and if in\nformer times the taxation has been unjust, we ought to be thankful, that\nwe have now discovered a method of making it equitable, and hope that\nthis will be the means of uniting the citizens, not of dividing them;\nwhich would certainly be the case were they to attempt the recovery of\ntaxes for the past, and make them equal to the present; and that he who\nis content with a moderate victory is always most successful; for those\nwho would more than conquer, commonly lose.\" With such words as these\nhe calmed the disturbance, and this retrospective equalization was no\nlonger contemplated.\nThe war with the duke still continued; but peace was at length restored\nby means of a legate of the pope. The duke, however, from the first\ndisregarded the conditions, so that the league again took arms, and\nmeeting the enemy's forces at Maclovio routed them. After this defeat\nthe duke again made proposals for peace, to which the Florentines\nand Venetians both agreed; the former from jealousy of the Venetians,\nthinking they had spent quite enough money in the aggrandizement of\nothers; the latter, because they found Carmignuola, after the defeat of\nthe duke, proceed but coldly in their cause; so that they thought it no\nlonger safe to trust him. A treaty was therefore concluded in 1428, by\nwhich the Florentines recovered the places they had lost in Romagna;\nand the Venetians kept Brescia, to which the duke added Bergamo and the\ncountry around it. In this war the Florentines expended three millions\nand a half of ducats, extended the territory and power of the Venetians,\nand brought poverty and disunion upon themselves.\nBeing at peace with their neighbors, domestic troubles recommenced. The\ngreat citizens could not endure the Catasto, and not knowing how to\nset it aside, they endeavored to raise up more numerous enemies to\nthe measure, and thus provide themselves with allies to assist them in\nannulling it. They therefore instructed the officers appointed to levy\nthe tax, that the law required them to extend the Catasto over the\nproperty of their nearest neighbors, to see if Florentine wealth was\nconcealed among it. The dependent states were therefore ordered to\npresent a schedule of their property against a certain time. This was\nextremely offensive to the people of Volterra, who sent to the Signory\nto complain of it; but the officers, in great wrath, committed eighteen\nof the complainants to prison. The Volterrani, however, out of regard\nfor their fellow-countrymen who were arrested, did not proceed to any\nviolence.\nCHAPTER IV\nDeath of Giovanni de' Medici--His character--Insurrection of\nVolterra--Volterra returns to her allegiance--Niccolo Fortebraccio\nattacks the Lucchese--Diversity of opinion about the Lucchese\nwar--War with Lucca--Astore Gianni and Rinaldo degli Albizzi appointed\ncommissaries--Violence of Astorre Gianni.\nAbout this time Giovanni de' Medici was taken ill, and finding his end\napproach, called his sons Cosmo and Lorenzo to him, to give them his\nlast advice, and said, \"I find I have nearly reached the term which\nGod and nature appointed at my birth, and I die content, knowing that\nI leave you rich, healthy, and of such standing in society, that if you\npursue the same course that I have, you will live respected in Florence,\nand in favor with everyone. Nothing cheers me so much at this moment, as\nthe recollection that I have never willfully offended anyone; but have\nalways used my utmost endeavors to confer benefits upon all. I would\nhave you do so too. With regard to state affairs, if you would live in\nsecurity, take just such a share as the laws and your countrymen think\nproper to bestow, thus you will escape both danger and envy; for it\nis not what is given to any individual, but what he has determined to\npossess, that occasions odium. You will thus have a larger share than\nthose who endeavor to engross more than belongs to them; for they\nthus usually lose their own, and before they lose it, live in constant\ndisquiet. By adopting this method, although among so many enemies, and\nsurrounded by so many conflicting interests, I have not only maintained\nmy reputation but increased my influence. If you pursue the same course,\nyou will be attended by the same good fortune; if otherwise, you may be\nassured, your end will resemble that of those who in our own times have\nbrought ruin both upon themselves and their families.\" Soon after this\ninterview with his sons, Giovanni died, regretted by everyone, as his\nmany excellencies deserved. He was compassionate; not only bestowing\nalms on those who asked them, but very frequently relieving the\nnecessities of the poor, without having been solicited so to do. He\nloved all; praised the good, and pitied the infirmities of the wicked.\nHe never sought the honors of government; yet enjoyed them all; and\nnever went to the palace unless by request. He loved peace and shunned\nwar; relieved mankind in adversity, and assisted them in prosperity;\nnever applied the public money to his own uses, but contributed to the\npublic wealth. He was courteous in office; not a man of great eloquence,\nbut possessed of extraordinary prudence. His demeanor expressed\nmelancholy; but after a short time his conversation became pleasant and\nfacetious. He died exceedingly rich in money, but still more in good\nfame and the best wishes of mankind; and the wealth and respect he left\nbehind him were not only preserved but increased by his son Cosmo.\nThe Volterran ambassadors grew weary of lying in prison, and to obtain\ntheir liberty promised to comply with the commands of the Florentines.\nBeing set free and returned to their city, the time arrived for the new\nPriors to enter upon office, and among those who were drawn, was one\nnamed Giusto, a plebeian, but possessing great influence with his class,\nand one of those who had been imprisoned at Florence. He, being inflamed\nwith hatred against the Florentines on account of his public as well as\npersonal injuries, was further stimulated by Giovanni di Contugi, a man\nof noble family, and his colleague in office, to induce the people, by\nthe authority of the Priors and his own influence, to withdraw their\ncountry from the power of the Florentines, and make himself prince.\nPrompted by these motives, Giusto took arms, rode through the city,\nseized the Capitano, who resided in it, on behalf of the Florentines,\nand with the consent of the people, became lord of Volterra. This\ncircumstance greatly displeased the Florentines; but having just made\npeace with the duke, and the treaty being yet uninfringed on either\nside, they bethought themselves in a condition to recover the place;\nand that the opportunity might not be lost, they immediately appointed\nRinaldo degli Albizzi and Palla Strozzi commissaries, and sent them upon\nthe expedition. In the meantime, Giusto, who expected the Florentines\nwould attack him, requested assistance of Lucca and Sienna. The latter\nrefused, alleging her alliance with Florence; and Pagolo Guinigi, to\nregain the favor of the Florentines, which he imagined he had lost\nin the war with the duke and by his friendship for Filippo, not only\nrefused assistance to Giusto, but sent his messenger prisoner to\nFlorence.\nThe commissaries, to come upon the Volterrani unawares, assembled their\ncavalry, and having raised a good body of infantry in the Val d'Arno\nInferiore, and the country about Pisa, proceeded to Volterra. Although\nattacked by the Florentines and abandoned by his neighbors, Giusto did\nnot yield to fear; but, trusting to the strength of the city and the\nruggedness of the country around it, prepared for his defense.\nThere lived at Volterra one Arcolano, brother of that Giovanni Contugi\nwho had persuaded Giusto to assume the command. He possessed influence\namong the nobility, and having assembled a few of his most confidential\nfriends, he assured them that by this event, God had come to the relief\nof their necessities; for if they would only take arms, deprive Giusto\nof the Signory, and give up the city to the Florentines, they might be\nsure of obtaining the principal offices, and the place would retain all\nits ancient privileges. Having gained them over, they went to the\npalace in which Giusto resided; and while part of them remained below,\nArcolano, with three others, proceeded to the chamber above, where\nfinding him with some citizens, they drew him aside, as if desirous\nto communicate something of importance, and conversing on different\nsubjects, let him to the lower apartment, and fell upon him with their\nswords. They, however, were not so quick as to prevent Giusto from\nmaking use of his own weapon; for with it he seriously wounded two of\nthem; but being unable to resist so many, he was at last slain, and his\nbody thrown into the street. Arcolano and his party gave up the city\nto the Florentine commissaries, who, being at hand with their forces,\nimmediately took possession; but the condition of Volterra was worse\nthan before; for among other things which operated to her disadvantage,\nmost of the adjoining countryside was separated from her, and she was\nreduced to the rank of a vicariate.\nVolterra having been lost and recovered almost at the same time, present\ncircumstances afforded nothing of sufficient importance to occasion a\nnew war, if ambition had not again provoked one. Niccolo Fortebraccio,\nthe son of a sister of Braccio da Perugia, had been in the service\nof the Florentines during most of their wars with the duke. Upon the\nrestoration of peace he was discharged; but when the affair of\nVolterra took place, being encamped with his people at Fucecchio, the\ncommissaries availed themselves both of himself and his forces. Some\nthought that while Rinaldo conducted the expedition along with him, he\npersuaded him, under one pretext or another, to attack the Lucchese,\nassuring him, that if he did so, the Florentines would consent to\nundertake an expedition against them, and would appoint him to the\ncommand. When Volterra was recovered, and Niccolo returned to his\nquarters at Fucecchio, he, either at the persuasion of Rinaldo, or of\nhis own accord, in November, 1429, took possession of Ruoti and Compito,\ncastles belonging to the Lucchese, with three hundred cavalry and\nas many infantry, and then descending into the plain, plundered the\ninhabitants to a vast amount. The news of this incursion having\nreached Florence, persons of all classes were seen gathered in parties\nthroughout the city discussing the matter, and nearly all were in favor\nof an expedition against Lucca. Of the Grandees thus disposed, were the\nMedici and their party, and with them also Rinaldo, either because he\nthought the enterprise beneficial to the republic, or induced by his own\nambition and the expectation of being appointed to the command. Niccolo\nda Uzzano and his party were opposed to the war. It seems hardly\ncredible that such contrary opinions should prevail, though at different\ntimes, in the same men and the same city, upon the subject of war; for\nthe same citizens and people that, during the ten years of peace had\nincessantly blamed the war undertaken against Duke Filippo, in defense\nof liberty, now, after so much expense and trouble, with their utmost\nenergy, insisted on hostilities against Lucca, which, if successful,\nwould deprive that city of her liberty; while those who had been in\nfavor of a war with the duke, were opposed to the present; so much\nmore ready are the multitude to covet the possessions of others than to\npreserve their own, and so much more easily are they led by the hope\nof acquisition than by the fear of loss. The suggestions of the latter\nappear incredible till they are verified; and the pleasing anticipations\nof the former are cherished as facts, even while the advantages are very\nproblematical, or at best, remote. The people of Florence were inspired\nwith hope, by the acquisitions which Niccolo Fortebraccio had made, and\nby letters received from their rectors in the vicinity of Lucca; for\ntheir deputies at Vico and Pescia had written, that if permission were\ngiven to them to receive the castles that offered to surrender, the\nwhole country of Lucca would very soon be obtained. It must, however, be\nadded, that an ambassador was sent by the governor of Lucca to Florence,\nto complain of the attack made by Niccolo, and to entreat that the\nSignory would not make war against a neighbor, and a city that had\nalways been friendly to them. The ambassador was Jacopo Viviani, who, a\nshort time previously, had been imprisoned by Pagolo Guinigi, governor\nof Lucca, for having conspired against him. Although he had been found\nguilty, his life was spared, and as Pagolo thought the forgiveness\nmutual, he reposed confidence in him. Jacopo, more mindful of the danger\nhe had incurred than of the lenity exercised toward him, on his arrival\nin Florence secretly instigated the citizens to hostilities; and these\ninstigations, added to other hopes, induced the Signory to call the\nCouncil together, at which 498 citizens assembled, before whom the\nprincipal men of the city discussed the question.\nAmong the first who addressed the assembly in favor of the expedition,\nwas Rinaldo. He pointed out the advantage that would accrue from the\nacquisition, and justified the enterprise from its being left open to\nthem by the Venetians and the duke, and that as the pope was engaged in\nthe affairs of Naples, he could not interfere. He then remarked upon the\nfacility of the expedition, showing that Lucca, being now in bondage to\none of her own citizens, had lost her natural vigor and former anxiety\nfor the preservation of her liberty, and would either be surrendered to\nthem by the people in order to expel the tyrant, or by the tyrant for\nfear of the people. He recalled the remembrance of the injuries done to\nthe republic by the governor of Lucca; his malevolent disposition toward\nthem; and their embarrassing situation with regard to him, if the pope\nor the duke were to make war upon them; and concluded that no enterprise\nwas ever undertaken by the people of Florence with such perfect\nfacility, more positive advantage, or greater justice in its favor.\nIn a reply to this, Niccolo da Uzzano stated that the city of Florence\nnever entered on a more unjust or more dangerous project, or one more\npregnant with evil, than this. In the first place they were going to\nattack a Guelphic city, that had always been friendly to the Florentine\npeople, and had frequently, at great hazard, received the Guelphs into\nher bosom when they were expelled from their own country. That in the\nhistory of the past there was not an instance, while Lucca was free, of\nher having done an injury to the Florentines; and that if they had been\ninjured by her enslavers, as formerly by Castruccio, and now by the\npresent governor, the fault was not in the city, but in her tyrant.\nThat if they could assail the latter without detriment to the people,\nhe should have less scruple, but as this was impossible, he could\nnot consent that a city which had been friendly to Florence should be\nplundered of her wealth. However, as it was usual at present to pay\nlittle or no regard either to equity or injustice, he would consider the\nmatter solely with reference to the advantage of Florence. He thought\nthat what could not easily be attended by pernicious consequences might\nbe esteemed useful, but he could not imagine how an enterprise should\nbe called advantageous in which the evils were certain and the utility\ndoubtful. The certain evils were the expenses with which it would be\nattended; and these, he foresaw, would be sufficiently great to alarm\neven a people that had long been in repose, much more one wearied, as\nthey were, by a tedious and expensive war. The advantage that might be\ngained was the acquisition of Lucca, which he acknowledged to be great;\nbut the hazards were so enormous and immeasurable, as in his opinion\nto render the conquest quite impossible. He could not induce himself to\nbelieve that the Venetians, or Filippo, would willingly allow them to\nmake the acquisition; for the former only consented in appearance, in\norder to avoid the semblance of ingratitude, having so lately, with\nFlorentine money, acquired such an extent of dominion. That as regarded\nthe duke, it would greatly gratify him to see them involved in new wars\nand expenses; for, being exhausted and defeated on all sides, he might\nagain assail them; and that if, after having undertaken it, their\nenterprise against Lucca were to prove successful, and offer them the\nfullest hope of victory, the duke would not want an opportunity of\nfrustrating their labors, either by assisting the Lucchese secretly\nwith money, or by apparently disbanding his own troops, and then sending\nthem, as if they were soldiers of fortune, to their relief. He therefore\nadvised that they should give up the idea, and behave toward the tyrant\nin such a way as to create him as many enemies as possible; for there\nwas no better method of reducing Lucca than to let them live under the\ntyrant, oppressed and exhausted by him; for, if prudently managed, that\ncity would soon get into such a condition that he could not retain it,\nand being ignorant or unable to govern itself, it must of necessity fall\ninto their power. But he saw that his discourse did not please them, and\nthat his words were unheeded; he would, however, predict this to them,\nthat they were about to commence a war in which they would expend vast\nsums, incur great domestic dangers, and instead of becoming masters of\nLucca, they would deliver her from her tyrant, and of a friendly city,\nfeeble and oppressed, they would make one free and hostile, and that\nin time she would become an obstacle to the greatness of their own\nrepublic.\nThe question having been debated on both sides, they proceeded to vote,\nas usual, and of the citizens present only ninety-eight were against the\nenterprise. Thus determined in favor of war, they appointed a Council of\nTen for its management, and hired forces, both horse and foot. Astorre\nGianni and Rinaldo degli Albizzi were appointed commissaries, and\nNiccolo Fortebraccio, on agreeing to give up to the Florentines the\nplaces he had taken, was engaged to conduct the enterprise as their\ncaptain. The commissaries having arrived with the army in the country\nof the Lucchese, divided their forces; one part of which, under Astorre,\nextended itself along the plain, toward Camaiore and Pietrasanta, while\nRinaldo, with the other division, took the direction of the hills,\npresuming that when the citizens found themselves deprived of the\nsurrounding country, they would easily submit. The proceedings of the\ncommissaries were unfortunate, not that they failed to occupy many\nplaces, but from the complaints made against them of mismanaging the\noperations of the war; and Astorre Gianni had certainly given very\nsufficient cause for the charges against him.\nThere is a fertile and populous valley near Pietrasanta, called\nSeravezza, whose inhabitants, on learning the arrival of the commissary,\npresented themselves before him and begged he would receive them as\nfaithful subjects of the Florentine republic. Astorre pretended to\naccept their proposal, but immediately ordered his forces to take\npossession of all the passes and strong positions of the valley,\nassembled the men in the principal church, took them all prisoners, and\nthen caused his people to plunder and destroy the whole country, with\nthe greatest avarice and cruelty, making no distinction in favor of\nconsecrated places, and violating the women, both married and\nsingle. These things being known in Florence, displeased not only the\nmagistracy, but the whole city.\nCHAPTER V\nThe inhabitants of Seravezza appeal to the Signory--Complaints against\nRinaldo degli Albizzi--The commissaries changed--Filippo Brunelleschi\nproposes to submerge the country about Lucca--Pagolo Guinigi asks\nassistance of the duke of Milan--The duke sends Francesco Sforza--Pagolo\nGuinigi expelled--The Florentines routed by the forces of the duke--The\nacquisitions of the Lucchese after the victory--Conclusion of the war.\nA few of the inhabitants of the valley of Seravezza, having escaped the\nhands of the commissary, came to Florence and acquainted every one in\nthe streets with their miserable situation; and by the advice of those\nwho, either through indignation at his wickedness or from being of\nthe opposite party, wished to punish the commissary, they went to the\nCouncil of Ten, and requested an audience. This being granted, one of\nthem spoke to the following effect: \"We feel assured, magnificent lords,\nthat we shall find credit and compassion from the Signory, when you\nlearn how your commissary has taken possession of our country, and in\nwhat manner he has treated us. Our valley, as the memorials of your\nancient houses abundantly testify, was always Guelphic, and has\noften proved a secure retreat to your citizens when persecuted by the\nGhibellines. Our forefathers, and ourselves too, have always revered the\nname of this noble republic as the leader and head of their party. While\nthe Lucchese were Guelphs we willingly submitted to their government;\nbut when enslaved by the tyrant, who forsook his old friends to join\nthe Ghibelline faction, we have obeyed him more through force than good\nwill. And God knows how often we have prayed, that we might have an\nopportunity of showing our attachment to our ancient party. But how\nblind are mankind in their wishes! That which we desired for our safety\nhas proved our destruction. As soon as we learned that your ensigns were\napproaching, we hastened to meet your commissary, not as an enemy,\nbut as the representative of our ancient lords; placed our valley, our\npersons, and our fortunes in his hands, and commended them to his good\nfaith, believing him to possess the soul, if not of a Florentine, at\nleast of a man. Your lordships will forgive us; for, unable to support\nhis cruelties, we are compelled to speak. Your commissary has nothing of\nthe man but the shape, nor of a Florentine but the name; a more deadly\npest, a more savage beast, a more horrid monster never was imagined in\nthe human mind; for, having assembled us in our church under pretense\nof wishing to speak with us, he made us prisoners. He then burned and\ndestroyed the whole valley, carried off our property, ravaged every\nplace, destroyed everything, violated the women, dishonored the virgins,\nand dragging them from the arms of their mothers, gave them up to the\nbrutality of his soldiery. If by any injury to the Florentine people we\nmerited such treatment, or if he had vanquished us armed in our defense,\nwe should have less reason for complaint; we should have accused\nourselves, and thought that either our mismanagement or our arrogance\nhad deservedly brought the calamity upon us; but after having freely\npresented ourselves to him unarmed, to be robbed and plundered with such\nunfeeling barbarity, is more than we can bear. And though we might\nhave filled Lombardy with complaints and charges against this city, and\nspread the story of our misfortunes over the whole of Italy, we did\nnot wish to slander so just and pious a republic, with the baseness and\nperfidy of one wicked citizen, whose cruelty and avarice, had we known\nthem before our ruin was complete, we should have endeavored to satiate\n(though indeed they are insatiable), and with one-half of our property\nhave saved the rest. But the opportunity is past; we are compelled to\nhave recourse to you, and beg that you will succor the distresses of\nyour subjects, that others may not be deterred by our example from\nsubmitting themselves to your authority. And if our extreme distress\ncannot prevail with you to assist us, be induced, by your fear of the\nwrath of God, who has seen his temple plundered and burned, and his\npeople betrayed in his bosom.\" Having said this they threw themselves\non the ground, crying aloud, and praying that their property and their\ncountry might be restored to them; and that if the Signory could not\ngive them back their honor, they would, at least, restore husbands to\ntheir wives, and children to their fathers. The atrocity of the affair\nhaving already been made known, and now by the living words of\nthe sufferers presented before them, excited the compassion of the\nmagistracy. They ordered the immediate return of Astorre, who being\ntried, was found guilty, and admonished. They sought the goods of the\ninhabitants of Seravezza; all that could be recovered was restored\nto them, and as time and circumstance gave opportunity, they were\ncompensated for the rest.\nComplaints were made against Rinaldo degli Albizzi, that he carried on\nthe war, not for the advantage of the Florentine people, but his own\nprivate emolument; that as soon as he was appointed commissary, he lost\nall desire to take Lucca, for it was sufficient for him to plunder the\ncountry, fill his estates with cattle, and his house with booty; and,\nnot content with what his own satellites took, he purchased that of the\nsoldiery, so that instead of a commissary he became a merchant. These\ncalumnies coming to his ears, disturbed the temper of this proud but\nupright man, more than quite became his dignity. He was so exasperated\nagainst the citizens and magistracy, that without waiting for or asking\npermission, he returned to Florence, and, presenting himself before the\nCouncil of Ten, he said that he well knew how difficult and dangerous a\nthing it was to serve an unruly people and a divided city, for the\none listens to every report, the other pursues improper measures; they\nneglect to reward good conduct, and heap censure upon whatever appears\ndoubtful; so that victory wins no applause, error is accused by all, and\nif vanquished, universal condemnation is incurred; from one's own party\nthrough envy, and from enemies through hatred, persecution results. He\nconfessed that the baseness of the present calumnies had conquered his\npatience and changed the temper of his mind; but he would say, he had\nnever, for fear of a false accusation, avoided doing what appeared to\nhim beneficial to the city. However, he trusted the magistrates would in\nfuture be more ready to defend their fellow-citizens, so that the latter\nmight continue anxious to effect the prosperity of their country; that\nas it was not customary at Florence to award triumphs for success, they\nought at least to be protected from calumny; and that being citizens\nthemselves, and at any moment liable to false accusations, they might\neasily conceive how painful it is to an upright mind to be oppressed\nwith slander. The Ten endeavored, as well as circumstances would admit,\nto soothe the acerbity of his feelings, and confided the care of the\nexpedition to Neri di Gino and Alamanno Salviati, who, instead of\noverrunning the country, advanced near to Lucca. As the weather had\nbecome extremely cold, the forces established themselves at Campannole,\nwhich seemed to the commissaries waste of time; and wishing to draw\nnearer the place, the soldiery refused to comply, although the Ten had\ninsisted they should pitch their camp before the city, and would not\nhear of any excuse.\nAt that time there lived at Florence, a very distinguished architect,\nnamed Filippo di Ser Brunelleschi, of whose works our city is full, and\nwhose merit was so extraordinary, that after his death his statue\nin marble was erected in the principal church, with an inscription\nunderneath, which still bears testimony to those who read it, of his\ngreat talents. This man pointed out, that in consequence of the relative\npositions of the river Serchio and the city of Lucca, the wastes of the\nriver might be made to inundate the surrounding country, and place the\ncity in a kind of lake. His reasoning on this point appeared so clear,\nand the advantage to the besiegers so obvious and inevitable, that the\nTen were induced to make the experiment. The result, however, was quite\ncontrary to their expectation, and produced the utmost disorder in\nthe Florentine camp; for the Lucchese raised high embankments in the\ndirection of the ditch made by our people to conduct the waters of the\nSerchio, and one night cut through the embankment of the ditch itself,\nso that having first prevented the water from taking the course\ndesigned by the architect, they now caused it to overflow the plain,\nand compelled the Florentines, instead of approaching the city as they\nwished, to take a more remote position.\nThe design having failed, the Council of Ten, who had been re-elected,\nsent as commissary, Giovanni Guicciardini, who encamped before Lucca,\nwith all possible expedition. Pagolo Guinigi finding himself thus\nclosely pressed, by the advice of Antonio del Rosso, then representative\nof the Siennese at Lucca, sent Salvestro Trento and Leonardo Bonvisi to\nMilan, to request assistance from the duke; but finding him indisposed\nto comply, they secretly engaged, on the part of the people, to deliver\ntheir governor up to him and give him possession of the place; at the\nsame time intimating, that if he did not immediately follow this advice,\nhe would not long have the opportunity, since it was the intention of\nPagolo to surrender the city to the Florentines, who were very anxious\nto obtain it. The duke was so much alarmed with this idea, that, setting\naside all other considerations, he caused Count Francesco Sforza, who\nwas engaged in his service, to make a public request for permission\nto go to Naples; and having obtained it, he proceeded with his forces\ndirectly to Lucca, though the Florentines, aware of the deception,\nand apprehensive of the consequences, had sent to the count, Boccacino\nAlamanni, his friend, to frustrate this arrangement. Upon the arrival\nof the count at Lucca, the Florentines removed their camp to Librafatta,\nand the count proceeded immediately to Pescia, where Pagolo Diacceto\nwas lieutenant governor, who, promoted by fear rather than any better\nmotive, fled to Pistoia, and if the place had not been defended by\nGiovanni Malavolti, to whom the command was intrusted, it would have\nbeen lost. The count failing in his attempt went to Borgo a Buggiano\nwhich he took, and burned the castle of Stigliano, in the same\nneighborhood.\nThe Florentines being informed of these disasters, found they must have\nrecourse to those remedies which upon former occasions had often\nproved useful. Knowing that with mercenary soldiers, when force is\ninsufficient, corruption commonly prevails, they offered the count a\nlarge sum of money on condition that he should quit the city, and give\nit up to them. The count finding that no more money was to be had from\nLucca, resolved to take it of those who had it to dispense, and agreed\nwith the Florentines, not to give them Lucca, which for decency he could\nnot consent to, but to withdraw his troops, and abandon it, on condition\nof receiving fifty thousand ducats; and having made this agreement, to\ninduce the Lucchese to excuse him to the duke, he consented that they\nshould expel their tyrant.\nAntonio del Rosso, as we remarked above, was Siennese ambassador at\nLucca, and with the authority of the count he contrived the ruin of\nPagolo Guinigi. The heads of the conspiracy were Pierro Cennami and\nGiovanni da Chivizzano. The count resided upon the Serchio, at a short\ndistance from the city, and with him was Lanzilao, the son of Pagolo.\nThe conspirators, about forty in number, went armed at night in search\nof Pagolo, who, on hearing the noise they made, came toward them quite\nastonished, and demanded the cause of their visit; to which Piero\nCennami replied, that they had long been governed by him, and led\nabout against the enemy, to die either by hunger or the sword, but were\nresolved to govern themselves for the future, and demanded the keys of\nthe city and the treasure. Pagolo said the treasure was consumed, but\nthe keys and himself were in their power; he only begged that as his\ncommand had begun and continued without bloodshed, it might conclude\nin the same manner. Count Francesco conducted Pagolo and his son to the\nduke, and they afterward died in prison.\nThe departure of the count having delivered Lucca from her tyrant, and\nthe Florentines from their fear of his soldiery, the former prepared for\nher defense, and the latter resumed the siege. They appointed the\ncount of Urbino to conduct their forces, and he pressed the Lucchese\nso closely, that they were again compelled to ask the assistance of the\nduke, who dispatched Niccolo Piccinino, under the same pretense as he\npreviously sent Count Francesco. The Florentine forces met him on his\napproach to Lucca, and at the passage of the Serchio a battle ensued, in\nwhich they were routed, the commissary with a few of his men escaping\nto Pisa. This defeat filled the Florentines with dismay, and as the\nenterprise had been undertaken with the entire approbation of the great\nbody of the people, they did not know whom to find fault with, and\ntherefore railed against those who had been appointed to the management\nof the war, reviving the charges made against Rinaldo. They were,\nhowever, more severe against Giovanni Guicciardini than any other,\ndeclaring that if he had wished, he might have put a period to the war\nat the departure of Count Francesco, but that he had been bribed with\nmoney, for he had sent home a large sum, naming the party who had been\nintrusted to bring it, and the persons to whom it had been delivered.\nThese complaints and accusations were carried to so great a length that\nthe captain of the people, induced by the public voice, and pressed by\nthe party opposed to the war, summoned him to trial. Giovanni appeared,\nthough full of indignation. However his friends, from regard to their\nown character, adopted such a course with the Capitano as induced him to\nabandon the inquiry.\nAfter this victory, the Lucchese not only recovered the places that had\nbelonged to them, but occupied all the country of Pisa except Beintina,\nCalcinaja, Livorno, and Librafatta; and, had not a conspiracy been\ndiscovered that was formed in Pisa, they would have secured that\ncity also. The Florentines again prepared for battle, and appointed\nMicheletto, a pupil of Sforza, to be their leader. The duke, on the\nother hand, followed up this victory, and that he might bring a greater\npower against the Florentines, induced the Genoese, the Siennese, and\nthe governor of Piombino, to enter into a league for the defense of\nLucca, and to engage Niccolo Piccinino to conduct their forces. Having\nby this step declared his design, the Venetians and the Florentines\nrenewed their league, and the war was carried on openly in Tuscany and\nLombardy, in each of which several battles were fought with variety of\nfortune. At length, both sides being wearied out, they came to terms\nfor the cessation of hostilities, in May, 1433. By this arrangement\nthe Florentines, Lucchese, and Siennese, who had each occupied many\nfortresses belonging to the others, gave them all up, and each party\nresumed its original possessions.\nCHAPTER VI\nCosmo de' Medici, his character and mode of proceedings--The greatness\nof Cosmo excites the jealousy of the citizens--The opinion of Niccolo\nda Uzzano--Scandalous divisions of the Florentines--Death of Niccolo\nda Uzzano--Bernardo Guadagni, Gonfalonier, adopts measures against\nCosmo--Cosmo arrested in the palace--He is apprehensive of attempts\nagainst his life.\nDuring the war the malignant humors of the city were in constant\nactivity. Cosmo de' Medici, after the death of Giovanni, engaged more\nearnestly in public affairs, and conducted himself with more zeal and\nboldness in regard to his friends than his father had done, so that\nthose who rejoiced at Giovanni's death, finding what the son was likely\nto become, perceived they had no cause for exultation. Cosmo was one\nof the most prudent of men; of grave and courteous demeanor, extremely\nliberal and humane. He never attempted anything against parties,\nor against rulers, but was bountiful to all; and by the unwearied\ngenerosity of his disposition, made himself partisans of all ranks of\nthe citizens. This mode of proceeding increased the difficulties of\nthose who were in the government, and Cosmo himself hoped that by its\npursuit he might be able to live in Florence as much respected and\nas secure as any other citizen; or if the ambition of his adversaries\ncompelled him to adopt a different course, arms and the favor of his\nfriends would enable him to become more so. Averardo de' Medici and\nPuccio Pucci were greatly instrumental in the establishment of his\npower; the former by his boldness, the latter by unusual prudence and\nsagacity, contributed to his aggrandizement. Indeed the advice of\nwisdom of Puccio were so highly esteemed, that Cosmo's party was rather\ndistinguished by the name of Puccio than by his own.\nBy this divided city the enterprise against Lucca was undertaken; and\nthe bitterness of party spirit, instead of being abated, increased.\nAlthough the friends of Cosmo had been in favor of it, many of the\nadverse faction were sent to assist in the management, as being men of\ngreater influence in the state. Averardo de' Medici and the rest being\nunable to prevent this, endeavored with all their might to calumniate\nthem; and when any unfavorable circumstance occurred (and there were\nmany), fortune and the exertions of the enemy were never supposed to\nbe the causes, but solely the want of capacity in the commissary. This\ndisposition aggravated the offenses of Astorre Gianni; this excited the\nindignation of Rinaldo degli Albizzi, and made him resign his commission\nwithout leave; this, too, compelled the captain of the people to require\nthe appearance of Giovanni Guicciardini, and from this arose all\nthe other charges which were made against the magistrates and the\ncommissaries. Real evils were magnified, unreal ones feigned, and the\ntrue and the false were equally believed by the people, who were almost\nuniversally their foes.\nAll these events and extraordinary modes of proceeding were perfectly\nknown to Niccolo da Uzzano and the other leaders of the party; and they\nhad often consulted together for the purpose of finding a remedy, but\nwithout effect; though they were aware of the danger of allowing them\nto increase, and the great difficulty that would attend any attempt\nto remove or abate them. Niccolo da Uzzano was the earliest to take\noffense; and while the war was proceeding without, and these troubles\nwithin, Niccolo Barbadoro desirous of inducing him to consent to the\nruin of Cosmo, waited upon him at his house; and finding him alone in\nhis study, and very pensive, endeavored, with the best reasons he could\nadvance, to persuade him to agree with Rinaldo on Cosmo's expulsion.\nNiccolo da Uzzano replied as follows: \"It would be better for thee and\nthy house, as well as for our republic, if thou and those who follow\nthee in this opinion had beards of silver instead of gold, as is said of\nthee; for advice proceeding from the hoary head of long experience would\nbe wiser and of greater service to all. It appears to me, that those who\ntalk of driving Cosmo out of Florence would do well to consider what is\ntheir strength, and what that of Cosmo. You have named one party,\nthat of the nobility, the other that of the plebeians. If the fact\ncorresponded with the name, the victory would still be most uncertain,\nand the example of the ancient nobility of this city, who were destroyed\nby the plebeians, ought rather to impress us with fear than with hope.\nWe have, however, still further cause for apprehension from the division\nof our party, and the union of our adversaries. In the first place, Neri\ndi Gino and Nerone di Nigi, two of our principal citizens, have never\nso fully declared their sentiments as to enable us to determine whether\nthey are most our friends our those of our opponents. There are many\nfamilies, even many houses, divided; many are opposed to us through\nenvy of brothers or relatives. I will recall to your recollection two\nor three of the most important; you may think of the others at your\nleisure. Of the sons of Maso degli Albizzi, Luca, from envy of Rinaldo,\nhas thrown himself into their hands. In the house of Guicciardini, of\nthe sons of Luigi, Piero is the enemy of Giovanni and in favor of our\nadversaries. Tommaso and Niccolo Soderini openly oppose us on account of\ntheir hatred of their uncle Francesco. So that if we consider well what\nwe are, and what our enemies, I cannot see why we should be called NOBLE\nany more than they. If it is because they are followed by the plebeians,\nwe are in a worse condition on that account, and they in a better; for\nwere it to come either to arms or to votes, we should not be able to\nresist them. True it is, we still preserve our dignity, our precedence,\nthe priority of our position, but this arises from the former reputation\nof the government, which has now continued fifty years; and whenever we\ncome to the proof, or they discover our weakness we shall lose it. If\nyou were to say, the justice of our cause ought to augment our influence\nand diminish theirs I answer, that this justice requires to be perceived\nand believed by others as well as by ourselves, but this is not the\ncase; for the justice of our cause is wholly founded upon our suspicion\nthat Cosmo designs to make himself prince of the city. And although we\nentertain this suspicion and suppose it to be correct, others have it\nnot; but what is worse, they charge us with the very design of which\nwe accuse him. Those actions of Cosmo which lead us to suspect him are,\nthat he lends money indiscriminately, and not to private persons\nonly, but to the public; and not to Florentines only, but to the\n_condottieri_, the soldiers of fortune. Besides, he assists any\ncitizen who requires magisterial aid; and, by the universal interest\nhe possesses in the city, raises first one friend and then another to\nhigher grades of honor. Therefore, to adduce our reasons for expelling\nhim, would be to say that he is kind, generous, liberal, and beloved\nby all. Now tell me, what law is there which forbids, disapproves, or\ncondemns men for being pious, liberal, and benevolent? And though they\nare all modes adopted by those who aim at sovereignty, they are not\nbelieved to be such, nor have we sufficient power to make them to be\nso esteemed; for our conduct has robbed us of confidence, and the city,\nnaturally partial and (having always lived in faction) corrupt, cannot\nlend its attention to such charges. But even if we were successful in\nan attempt to expel him (which might easily happen under a favorable\nSignory), how could we (being surrounded by his innumerable friends, who\nwould constantly reproach us, and ardently desire to see him again in\nthe city) prevent his return? It would be impossible for they being so\nnumerous, and having the good will of all upon their side, we should\nnever be secure from them. And as many of his first discovered friends\nas you might expel, so many enemies would you make, so that in a short\ntime he would return, and the result would be simply this, that we had\ndriven him out a good man and he had returned to us a bad one; for his\nnature would be corrupted by those who recalled him, and he, being under\nobligation, could not oppose them. Or should you design to put him to\ndeath, you could not attain your purpose with the magistrates, for his\nwealth, and the corruption of your minds, will always save him. But let\nus suppose him put to death, or that being banished, he did not return,\nI cannot see how the condition of our republic would be ameliorated; for\nif we relieve her from Cosmo, we at once make her subject to Rinaldo,\nand it is my most earnest desire that no citizen may ever, in power and\nauthority, surpass the rest. But if one of these must prevail, I know of\nno reason that should make me prefer Rinaldo to Cosmo. I shall only\nsay, may God preserve the city from any of her citizens usurping the\nsovereignty, but if our sins have deserved this, in mercy save us from\nRinaldo. I pray thee, therefore, do not advise the adoption of a course\non every account pernicious, nor imagine that, in union with a few, you\nwould be able to oppose the will of the many; for the citizens, some\nfrom ignorance and others from malice, are ready to sell the republic at\nany time, and fortune has so much favored them, that they have found a\npurchaser. Take my advice then; endeavor to live moderately; and with\nregard to liberty, you will find as much cause for suspicion in our\nparty as in that of our adversaries. And when troubles arise, being of\nneither side, you will be agreeable to both, and you will thus provide\nfor your own comfort and do no injury to any.\"\nThese words somewhat abated the eagerness of Barbadoro, so that\ntranquillity prevailed during the war with Lucca. But this being\nended, and Niccolo da Uzzano dead, the city being at peace and under no\nrestraint, unhealthy humors increased with fearful rapidity. Rinaldo,\nconsidering himself now the leader of the party, constantly entreated\nand urged every citizen whom he thought likely to be Gonfalonier, to\ntake up arms and deliver the country from him who, from the malevolence\nof a few and the ignorance of the multitude, was inevitably reducing it\nto slavery. These practices of Rinaldo, and those of the contrary side,\nkept the city full of apprehension, so that whenever a magistracy was\ncreated, the numbers of each party composing it were made publicly\nknown, and upon drawing for the Signory the whole city was aroused.\nEvery case brought before the magistrates, however trivial, was made a\nsubject of contention among them. Secrets were divulged, good and evil\nalike became objects of favor and opposition, the benevolent and the\nwicked were alike assailed, and no magistrate fulfilled the duties of\nhis office with integrity.\nIn this state of confusion, Rinaldo, anxious to abate the power\nof Cosmo, and knowing that Bernardo Guadagni was likely to become\nGonfalonier, paid his arrears of taxes, that he might not, by being\nindebted to the public, be incapacitated for holding the office. The\ndrawing soon after took place, and fortune, opposed to our welfare,\ncaused Bernardo to be appointed for the months of September and October.\nRinaldo immediately waited upon him, and intimated how much the party\nof the nobility, and all who wished for repose, rejoiced to find he\nhad attained that dignity; that it now rested with him to act in such a\nmanner as to realize their pleasing expectations. He then enlarged upon\nthe danger of disunion, and endeavored to show that there was no means\nof attaining the blessing of unity but by the destruction of Cosmo, for\nhe alone, by the popularity acquired with his enormous wealth, kept them\ndepressed; that he was already so powerful, that if not hindered, he\nwould soon become prince, and that it was the part of a good citizen, in\norder to prevent such a calamity, to assemble the people in the piazza,\nand restore liberty to his country. Rinaldo then reminded the new\nGonfalonier how Salvestro de' Medici was able, though unjustly, to\nrestrain the power of the Guelphs, to whom, by the blood of their\nancestors, shed in its cause, the government rightly belonged; and\nargued that what he was able unjustly to accomplish against so many,\nmight surely be easily performed with justice in its favor against one!\nHe encouraged him with the assurance that their friends would be ready\nin arms to support him; that he need not regard the plebeians, who\nadored Cosmo, since their assistance would be of no greater avail than\nGiorgio Scali had found it on a similar occasion; and that with regard\nto his wealth, no apprehension was necessary, for when he was under\nthe power of the Signory, his riches would be so too. In conclusion, he\naverred that this course would unite and secure the republic, and crown\nthe Gonfalonier with glory. Bernardo briefly replied, that he thought\nit necessary to act exactly as Rinaldo had advised, and that as the time\nwas suitable for action, he should provide himself with forces, being\nassured from what Rinaldo had said, he would be supported by his\ncolleagues.\nBernardo entered upon the duties of his office, prepared his followers,\nand having concerted with Rinaldo, summoned Cosmo, who, though many\nfriends dissuaded him from it, obeyed the call, trusting more to his own\ninnocence than to the mercy of the Signory. As soon as he had entered\nthe palace he was arrested. Rinaldo, with a great number of armed men,\nand accompanied by nearly the whole of his party, proceeded to the\npiazza, when the Signory assembled the people, and created a Balia of\ntwo hundred persons for the reformation of the city. With the least\npossible delay they entered upon the consideration of reform, and of the\nlife or death of Cosmo. Many wished him to be banished, others to be put\nto death, and several were silent, either from compassion toward him\nor for fear of the rest, so that these differences prevented them from\ncoming to any conclusion.\nThere is an apartment in the tower of the palace which occupies the\nwhole of one floor, and is called the Alberghettino, in which Cosmo was\nconfined, under the charge of Federigo Malavolti. In this place, hearing\nthe assembly of the Councils, the noise of arms which proceeded from the\npiazza, and the frequent ringing of the bell to assemble the Balia, he\nwas greatly apprehensive for his safety, but still more less his private\nenemies should cause him to be put to death in some unusual manner.\nHe scarcely took any food, so that in four days he ate only a small\nquantity of bread, Federigo, observing his anxiety, said to him, \"Cosmo,\nyou are afraid of being poisoned, and are evidently hastening your end\nwith hunger. You wrong me if you think I would be a party to such an\natrocious act. I do not imagine your life to be in much danger, since\nyou have so many friends both within the palace and without; but if you\nshould eventually lose it, be assured they will use some other medium\nthan myself for that purpose, for I will never imbue my hands in the\nblood of any, still less in yours, who never injured me; therefore cheer\nup, take some food, and preserve your life for your friends and your\ncountry. And that you may do so with greater assurance, I will partake\nof your meals with you.\" These words were of great relief to Cosmo, who,\nwith tears in his eyes, embraced and kissed Federigo, earnestly thanking\nhim for so kind and affectionate conduct, and promising, if ever the\nopportunity were given him, he would not be ungrateful.\nCHAPTER VII\nCosmo is banished to Padua--Rinaldo degli Albizzi attempts to\nrestore the nobility--New disturbances occasioned by Rinaldo degli\nAlbizzi--Rinaldo takes arms against the Signory--His designs are\ndisconcerted--Pope Eugenius in Florence--He endeavors to reconcile the\nparties--Cosmo is recalled--Rinaldo and his party banished--Glorious\nreturn of Cosmo.\nCosmo in some degree recovered his spirits, and while the citizens\nwere disputing about him, Federigo, by way of recreation, brought an\nacquaintance of the Gonfalonier to take supper with him, an amusing and\nfacetious person, whose name was Il Farnagaccio. The repast being nearly\nover, Cosmo, who thought he might turn this visit to advantage, for\nhe knew the man very intimately, gave a sign to Federigo to leave the\napartment, and he, guessing the cause, under pretense of going for\nsomething that was wanted on the table, left them together. Cosmo, after\na few friendly expressions addressed to Il Farnagaccio, gave him a small\nslip of paper, and desired him to go to the director of the hospital of\nSanta Maria Nuova, for one thousand one hundred ducats; he was to take\nthe hundred for himself, and carry the thousand to the Gonfalonier,\nand beg that he would take some suitable occasion of coming to see\nhim. Farnagaccio undertook the commission, the money was paid, Bernardo\nbecame more humane, and Cosmo was banished to Padua, contrary to the\nwish of Rinaldo, who earnestly desired his death. Averardo and many\nothers of the house of Medici were also banished, and with them Puccio\nand Giovanni Pucci. To silence those who were dissatisfied with the\nbanishment of Cosmo, they endowed with the power of a Balia, the Eight\nof War and the Capitano of the People. After his sentence, Cosmo on the\nthird of October, 1433, came before the Signory, by whom the boundary\nto which he was restricted was specified; and they advised him to avoid\npassing it, unless he wished them to proceed with greater severity both\nagainst himself and his property. Cosmo received his sentence with a\ncheerful look, assuring the Signory that wherever they determined to\nsend him, he would willingly remain. He earnestly begged, that as they\nhad preserved his life they would protect it, for he knew there were\nmany in the piazza who were desirous to take it; and assured them, that\nwherever he might be, himself and his means were entirely at the service\nof the city, the people, and the Signory. He was respectfully attended\nby the Gonfalonier, who retained him in the palace till night, then\nconducted him to his own house to supper, and caused him to be escorted\nby a strong armed force to his place of banishment. Wherever the\ncavalcade passed, Cosmo was honorably received, and was publicly visited\nby the Venetians, not as an exile, but with all the respect due to one\nin the highest station.\nFlorence, widowed of so great a citizen, one so generally beloved,\nseemed to be universally sunk in despondency; victors and the vanquished\nwere alike in fear. Rinaldo, as if inspired with a presage of his future\ncalamities, in order not to appear deficient to himself or his party,\nassembled many citizens, his friends, and informed them that he foresaw\ntheir approaching ruin for having allowed themselves to be overcome by\nthe prayers, the tears, and the money of their enemies; and that they\ndid not seem aware they would soon themselves have to entreat and weep,\nwhen their prayers would not be listened to, or their tears excite\ncompassion; and that of the money received, they would have to restore\nthe principal, and pay the interest in tortures, exile, and death; that\nit would have been much better for them to have done nothing than to\nhave left Cosmo alive, and his friends in Florence; for great offenders\nought either to remain untouched, or be destroyed; that there was now\nno remedy but to strengthen themselves in the city, so that upon the\nrenewed attempts of their enemies, which would soon take place, they\nmight drive them out with arms, since they had not sufficient civil\nauthority to expel them. The remedy to be adopted, he said, was one that\nhe had long before advocated, which was to regain the friendship of the\ngrandees, restoring and conceding to them all the honors of the city,\nand thus make themselves strong with that party, since their adversaries\nhad joined the plebeians. That by this means they would become the more\npowerful side, for they would possess greater energy, more comprehensive\ntalent and an augmented share of influence; and that if this last and\nonly remedy were not adopted, he knew not what other means could be\nmade use of to preserve the government among so many enemies, or prevent\ntheir own ruin and that of the city.\nMariotto Baldovinetti, one of the assembly, was opposed to this plan, on\naccount of the pride and insupportable nature of the nobility; and said,\nthat it would be folly to place themselves again under such inevitable\ntyranny for the sake of avoiding imaginary dangers from the plebeians.\nRinaldo, finding his advice unfavorably received, vexed at his own\nmisfortune and that of his party, imputed the whole to heaven itself,\nwhich had resolved upon it, rather than to human ignorance and blunders.\nIn this juncture of affairs, no remedial measure being attempted, a\nletter was found written by Agnolo Acciajuoli to Cosmo, acquainting\nhim with the disposition of the city in his favor, and advising him, if\npossible, to excite a war, and gain the friendship of Neri di Gino; for\nhe imagined the city to be in want of money, and as she would not find\nanyone to serve her, the remembrance of him would be revived in the\nminds of the citizens, and they would desire his return; and that if\nNeri were detached from Rinaldo, the party of the latter would be so\nweakened, as to be unable to defend themselves. This letter coming to\nthe hands of the magistrates, Agnolo was taken, put to the torture, and\nsent into exile. This example, however, did not at all deter Cosmo's\nparty.\nIt was now almost a year since Cosmo had been banished, and the end of\nAugust, 1434, being come, Niccolo di Cocco was drawn Gonfalonier for\nthe two succeeding months, and with him eight signors, all partisans of\nCosmo. This struck terror into Rinaldo and his party; and as it is usual\nfor three days to elapse before the new Signory assume the magistracy\nand the old resign their authority, Rinaldo again called together\nthe heads of his party. He endeavored to show them their certain and\nimmediate danger, and that their only remedy was to take arms, and cause\nDonato Velluti, who was yet Gonfalonier, to assemble the people in the\npiazza and create a Balia. He would then deprive the new Signory of the\nmagistracy, appoint another, burn the present balloting purses, and by\nmeans of a new Squittini, provide themselves with friends. Many thought\nthis course safe and requisite; others, that it was too violent, and\nlikely to be attended with great evil. Among those who disliked it was\nPalla Strozzi, a peaceable, gentle, and humane person, better adapted\nfor literary pursuits than for restraining a party, or opposing civil\nstrife. He said that bold and crafty resolutions seem promising at\ntheir commencement, but are afterward found difficult to execute, and\ngenerally pernicious at their conclusion; that he thought the fear of\nexternal wars (the duke's forces being upon the confines of Romagna),\nwould occupy the minds of the Signory more than internal dissensions;\nbut, still, if any attempt should be made, and it could not take place\nunnoticed, they would have sufficient time to take arms, and adopt\nwhatever measures might be found necessary for the common good, which\nbeing done upon necessity, would occasion less excitement among the\npeople and less danger to themselves. It was therefore concluded,\nthat the new Signory should come in; that their proceedings should be\nwatched, and if they were found attempting anything against the party,\neach should take arms, and meet in the piazza of San Pulinari, situated\nnear the palace, and whence they might proceed wherever it was found\nnecessary. Having come to this conclusion, Rinaldo's friends separated.\nThe new Signory entered upon their office, and the Gonfalonier, in order\nto acquire reputation, and deter those who might intend to oppose him,\nsent Donato Velluti, his predecessor, to prison, upon the charge of\nhaving applied the public money to his own use. He then endeavored to\nsound his colleagues with respect to Cosmo: seeing them desirous of his\nreturn, he communicated with the leaders of the Medici party, and,\nby their advice, summoned the hostile chiefs, Rinaldo degli Albizzi,\nRidolfo Peruzzi, and Niccolo Barbadoro. After this citation, Rinaldo\nthought further delay would be dangerous: he therefore left his house\nwith a great number of armed men, and was soon joined by Ridolfo Peruzzi\nand Niccolo Barbadoro. The force accompanying them was composed of\nseveral citizens and a great number of disbanded soldiers then in\nFlorence: and all assembled according to appointment in the piazza of\nSan Pulinari. Palla Strozzi and Giovanni Guicciardini, though each had\nassembled a large number of men, kept in their houses; and therefore\nRinaldo sent a messenger to request their attendance and to reprove\ntheir delay. Giovanni replied, that he should lend sufficient aid\nagainst their enemies, if by remaining at home he could prevent his\nbrother Piero from going to the defense of the palace. After many\nmessages Palla came to San Pulinari on horseback, accompanied by two\nof his people on foot, and unarmed. Rinaldo, on meeting him, sharply\nreproved him for his negligence, declaring that his refusal to come with\nthe others arose either from defect of principle or want of courage;\nboth of which charges should be avoided by all who wished to preserve\nsuch a character as he had hitherto possessed; and that if he thought\nthis abominable conduct to his party would induce their enemies when\nvictorious to spare him from death or exile, he deceived himself; but\nfor himself (Rinaldo) whatever might happen, he had the consolation of\nknowing, that previously to the crisis he had never neglected his\nduty in council, and that when it occurred he had used every possible\nexertion to repel it with arms; but that Palla and the others would\nexperience aggravated remorse when they considered they had upon three\noccasions betrayed their country; first when they saved Cosmo; next when\nthey disregarded his advice; and now the third time by not coming armed\nin her defense according to their engagement. To these reproaches Palla\nmade no reply audible to those around, but, muttering something as he\nleft them, returned to his house.\nThe Signory, knowing Rinaldo and his party had taken arms, finding\nthemselves abandoned, caused the palace to be shut up, and having no\none to consult they knew not what course to adopt. However, Rinaldo,\nby delaying his coming to the piazza, having waited in expectation of\nforces which did not join him, lost the opportunity of victory, gave\nthem courage to provide for their defense, and allowed many others\nto join them, who advised that means should be used to induce their\nadversaries to lay down their arms. Thereupon, some of the least\nsuspected, went on the part of the Signory to Rinaldo, and said,\nthey did not know what occasion they had given his friends for thus\nassembling in arms; that they never had any intention of offending him,\nand if they had spoken of Cosmo, they had no design of recalling him; so\nif their fears were thus occasioned they might at once be dispelled, for\nthat if they came to the palace they would be graciously received, and\nall their complaints attended to. These words produced no change in\nRinaldo's purpose; he bade them provide for their safety by resigning\ntheir offices, and said that then the government of the city would be\nreorganized, for the mutual benefit of all.\nIt rarely happens, where authorities are equal and opinions contrary,\nthat any good resolution is adopted. Ridolfo Peruzzi, moved by the\ndiscourse of the citizens, said, that all he desired was to prevent\nthe return of Cosmo, and this being granted to them seemed a sufficient\nvictory; nor would he, to obtain a greater, fill the city with blood; he\nwould therefore obey the Signory; and accordingly went with his people\nto the palace, where he was received with a hearty welcome. Thus\nRinaldo's delay at San Pulinari, Palla's want of courage, and Ridolfo's\ndesertion, deprived their party of all chance of success; while\nthe ardor of the citizens abated, and the pope's authority did not\ncontribute to its revival.\nPope Eugenius was at this time at Florence, having been driven from Rome\nby the people. These disturbances coming to his knowledge, he thought\nit a duty suitable to his pastoral office to appease them, and sent\nthe patriarch Giovanni Vitelleschi, Rinaldo's most intimate friend, to\nentreat the latter to come to an interview with him, as he trusted\nhe had sufficient influence with the Signory to insure his safety\nand satisfaction, without injury or bloodshed to the citizens. By his\nfriend's persuasion, Rinaldo proceeded with all his followers to Santa\nMaria Nuova, where the pope resided. Eugenius gave him to understand,\nthat the Signory had empowered him to settle the differences between\nthem, and that all would be arranged to his satisfaction, if he laid\ndown his arms. Rinaldo, having witnessed Palla's want of zeal, and the\nfickleness of Ridolfo Peruzzi, and no better course being open to him,\nplaced himself in the pope's hands, thinking that at all events the\nauthority of his holiness would insure his safety. Eugenius then sent\nword to Niccolo Barbadoro, and the rest who remained without, that they\nwere to lay down their arms, for Rinaldo was remaining with the\npontiff, to arrange terms of agreement with the signors; upon which they\nimmediately dispersed, and laid aside their weapons.\nThe Signory, seeing their adversaries disarmed, continued to negotiate\nan arrangement by means of the pope; but at the same time sent secretly\nto the mountains of Pistoia for infantry, which, with what other forces\nthey could collect, were brought into Florence by night. Having taken\npossession of all the strong positions in the city, they assembled the\npeople in the piazza and created a new balia, which, without delay,\nrestored Cosmo and those who had been exiled with him to their country;\nand banished, of the opposite party, Rinaldo degli Albizzi, Ridolfo\nPeruzzi, Niccolo Barbadoro, and Palla Strozzi, with so many other\ncitizens, that there were few places in Italy which did not contain\nsome, and many others beyond her limits were full of them. By this and\nsimilar occurrences, Florence was deprived of men of worth, and of much\nwealth and industry.\nThe pope, seeing such misfortunes befall those who by his entreaties\nwere induced to lay down their arms, was greatly dissatisfied, and\ncondoled with Rinaldo on the injuries he had received through his\nconfidence in him, but advised him to be patient, and hope for some\nfavorable turn of fortune. Rinaldo replied, \"The want of confidence in\nthose who ought to have trusted me, and the great trust I have reposed\nin you, have ruined both me and my party. But I blame myself principally\nfor having thought that you, who were expelled from your own country,\ncould preserve me in mine. I have had sufficient experience of the\nfreaks of fortune; and as I have never trusted greatly to prosperity, I\nshall suffer less inconvenience from adversity; and I know that when she\npleases she can become more favorable. But if she should never change, I\nshall not be very desirous of living in a city in which individuals\nare more powerful than the laws; for that country alone is desirable in\nwhich property and friends may be safely enjoyed, not one where they may\neasily be taken from us, and where friends, from fear of losing their\nproperty, are compelled to abandon each other in their greatest need.\nBesides, it has always been less painful to good men to hear of the\nmisfortunes of their country than to witness them; and an honorable\nexile is always held in greater esteem than slavery at home.\" He then\nleft the pope, and, full of indignation, blaming himself, his own\nmeasures, and the coldness of his friends, went into exile.\nCosmo, on the other hand, being informed of his recall, returned to\nFlorence; and it has seldom occurred that any citizen, coming home\ntriumphant from victory, was received by so vast a concourse of people,\nor such unqualified demonstrations of regard as he was upon his\nreturn from banishment; for by universal consent he was hailed as the\nbenefactor of the people, and the FATHER OF HIS COUNTRY.\nBOOK V\nCHAPTER I\nThe vicissitudes of empires--The state of Italy--The military factions\nof Sforza and Braccio--The Bracceschi and the Sforzeschi attack the\npope, who is expelled by the Romans--War between the pope and the duke\nof Milan--The Florentines and the Venetians assist the pope--Peace\nbetween the pope and the duke of Milan--Tyranny practiced by the party\nfavorable to the Medici.\nIt may be observed, that provinces amid the vicissitudes to which they\nare subject, pass from order into confusion, and afterward recur to a\nstate of order again; for the nature of mundane affairs not allowing\nthem to continue in an even course, when they have arrived at their\ngreatest perfection, they soon begin to decline. In the same manner,\nhaving been reduced by disorder, and sunk to their utmost state of\ndepression, unable to descend lower, they, of necessity, reascend;\nand thus from good they gradually decline to evil, and from evil again\nreturn to good. The reason is, that valor produces peace; peace, repose;\nrepose, disorder; disorder, ruin; so from disorder order springs; from\norder virtue, and from this, glory and good fortune. Hence, wise men\nhave observed, that the age of literary excellence is subsequent to that\nof distinction in arms; and that in cities and provinces, great warriors\nare produced before philosophers. Arms having secured victory, and\nvictory peace, the buoyant vigor of the martial mind cannot be enfeebled\nby a more excusable indulgence than that of letters; nor can indolence,\nwith any greater or more dangerous deceit, enter a well regulated\ncommunity. Cato was aware of this when the philosophers, Diogenes and\nCarneades, were sent ambassadors to the senate by the Athenians; for\nperceiving with what earnest admiration the Roman youth began to follow\nthem, and knowing the evils that might result to his country from this\nspecious idleness, he enacted that no philosopher should be allowed\nto enter Rome. Provinces by this means sink to ruin, from which, men's\nsufferings having made them wiser, they again recur to order, if they\nbe not overwhelmed by some extraordinary force. These causes made Italy,\nfirst under the ancient Tuscans, and afterward under the Romans, by\nturns happy and unhappy; and although nothing has subsequently arisen\nfrom the ruins of Rome at all corresponding to her ancient greatness\n(which under a well-organized monarchy might have been gloriously\neffected), still there was so much bravery and intelligence in some of\nthe new cities and governments that afterward sprang up, that although\nnone ever acquired dominion over the rest, they were, nevertheless, so\nbalanced and regulated among themselves, as to enable them to live in\nfreedom, and defend their country from the barbarians.\nAmong these governments, the Florentines, although they possessed a\nsmaller extent of territory, were not inferior to any in power and\nauthority; for being situated in the middle of Italy, wealthy, and\nprepared for action, they either defended themselves against such as\nthought proper to assail them, or decided victory in favor of those\nto whom they became allies. From the valor, therefore, of these new\ngovernments, if no seasons occurred of long-continued peace, neither\nwere any exposed to the calamities of war; for that cannot be called\npeace in which states frequently assail each other with arms, nor can\nthose be considered wars in which no men are slain, cities plundered,\nor sovereignties overthrown; for the practice of arms fell into such a\nstate of decay, that wars were commenced without fear, continued without\ndanger, and concluded without loss. Thus the military energy which is\nin other countries exhausted by a long peace, was wasted in Italy by\nthe contemptible manner in which hostilities were carried on, as will be\nclearly seen in the events to be described from 1434 to 1494, from which\nit will appear how the barbarians were again admitted into Italy, and\nshe again sunk under subjection to them. Although the transactions of\nour princes at home and abroad will not be viewed with admiration of\ntheir virtue and greatness like those of the ancients, perhaps they may\non other accounts be regarded with no less interest, seeing what\nmasses of high spirited people were kept in restraint by such weak and\ndisorderly forces. And if, in detailing the events which took place\nin this wasted world, we shall not have to record the bravery of the\nsoldier, the prudence of the general, or the patriotism of the citizen,\nit will be seen with what artifice, deceit, and cunning, princes,\nwarriors, and leaders of republics conducted themselves, to support a\nreputation they never deserved. This, perhaps, will not be less useful\nthan a knowledge of ancient history; for, if the latter excites the\nliberal mind to imitation, the former will show what ought to be avoided\nand decried.\nItaly was reduced to such a condition by her rulers, that when, by\nconsent of her princes, peace was restored, it was soon disturbed by\nthose who retained their armies, so that glory was not gained by war nor\nrepose by peace. Thus when the league and the duke of Milan agreed to\nlay aside their arms in 1433, the soldiers, resolved upon war, directed\ntheir efforts against the church. There were at this time two factions\nor armed parties in Italy, the Sforzesca and the Braccesca. The leader\nof the former was the Count Francesco, the son of Sforza, and of the\nlatter, Niccolo Piccinino and Niccolo Fortebraccio. Under the banner\nof one or other of these parties almost all the forces of Italy were\nassembled. Of the two, the Sforzesca was in greatest repute, as well\nfrom the bravery of the count himself, as from the promise which the\nduke of Milan had made him of his natural daughter, Madonna Bianca, the\nprospect of which alliance greatly strengthened his influence. After\nthe peace of Lombardy, these forces, from various causes attacked Pope\nEugenius. Niccolo Fortebraccio was instigated by the ancient enmity\nwhich Braccio had always entertained against the church; the count was\ninduced by ambition: so that Niccolo assailed Rome, and the count took\npossession of La Marca.\nThe Romans, in order to avoid the war, drove Pope Eugenius from their\ncity: and he, having with difficulty escaped, came to Florence, where\nseeing the imminent danger of his situation, being abandoned by the\nprinces (for they were unwilling again to take up arms in his cause,\nafter having been so anxious to lay them aside), he came to terms with\nthe count, and ceded to him the sovereignty of La Marca, although, to\nthe injury of having occupied it, he had added insult; for in signing\nthe place, from which he addressed letters to his agents, he said in\nLatin, according to the Latin custom, _Ex Girfalco nostro Firmiano,\ninvito Petro et Paulo_. Neither was he satisfied with this concession,\nbut insisted upon being appointed Gonfalonier of the church, which was\nalso granted; so much more was Eugenius alarmed at the prospect of a\ndangerous war than of an ignominious peace. The count, having been\nthus been reconciled to the pontiff, attacked Niccolo Fortebraccio, and\nduring many months various encounters took place between them, from\nall which greater injury resulted to the pope and his subjects, than to\neither of the belligerents. At length, by the intervention of the duke\nof Milan, an arrangement, by way of a truce, was made, by which both\nbecame princes in the territories of the church.\nThe war thus extinguished at Rome was rekindled in Romagna by Batista\nda Canneto, who at Bologna slew some of the family of the Grifoni, and\nexpelled from the city the governor who resided there for the pope,\nalong with others who were opposed to him. To enable himself to retain\nthe government, he applied for assistance to Filippo; and the pope,\nto avenge himself for the injury, sought the aid of the Venetians and\nFlorentines. Both parties obtained assistance, so that very soon two\nlarge armies were on foot in Romagna. Niccolo Piccinino commanded for\nthe duke, Gattamelata and Niccolo da Tolentino for the Venetians and\nFlorentines. They met near Imola, where a battle ensued, in which the\nFlorentines and Venetians were routed, and Niccolo da Tolentino was sent\nprisoner to Milan where, either through grief for his loss or by some\nunfair means, he died in a few days.\nThe duke, on this victory, either being exhausted by the late wars, or\nthinking the League after their defeat would not be in haste to resume\nhostilities, did not pursue his good fortune, and thus gave the pope and\nhis colleagues time to recover themselves. They therefore appointed\nthe Count Francesco for their leader, and undertook to drive Niccolo\nFortebraccio from the territories of the church, and thus terminate\nthe war which had been commenced in favor of the pontiff. The Romans,\nfinding the pope supported by so large an army, sought a reconciliation\nwith him, and being successful, admitted his commissary into the\ncity. Among the places possessed by Niccolo Fortebraccio, were Tivoli,\nMontefiascone, Citta di Castello, and Ascesi, to the last of which, not\nbeing able to keep the field, he fled, and the count besieged him there.\nNiccolo's brave defense making it probable that the war would be of\nconsiderable duration, the duke deemed to necessary to prevent the\nLeague from obtaining the victory, and said that if this were not\neffected he would very soon have to look at the defense of his own\nterritories. Resolving to divert the count from the siege, he commanded\nNiccolo Piccinino to pass into Tuscany by way of Romagna; and the\nLeague, thinking it more important to defend Tuscany than to occupy\nAscesi, ordered the count to prevent the passage of Niccolo, who was\nalready, with his army, at Furli. The count accordingly moved with his\nforces, and came to Cesena, having left the war of La Marca and the care\nof his own territories to his brother Lione; and while Niccolo Piccinino\nwas endeavoring to pass by, and the count to prevent him, Fortebraccio\nattacked Lione with great bravery, made him prisoner, routed his forces,\nand pursuing the advantage of his victory, at once possessed himself of\nmany places in La Marca. This circumstance greatly perplexed the count,\nwho thought he had lost all his territories; so, leaving part of his\nforce to check Piccinino, with the remainder he pursued Fortebraccio,\nwhom he attacked and conquered. Fortebraccio was taken prisoner in the\nbattle, and soon after died of his wounds. This victory restored to the\npontiff all the places that had been taken from him by Fortebraccio, and\ncompelled the duke of Milan to sue for peace, which was concluded by the\nintercession of Niccolo da Esta, marquis of Ferrara; the duke restoring\nto the church the places he had taken from her, and his forces retiring\ninto Lombardy. Batista da Canneto, as in the case with all who retain\nauthority only by the consent and forces of another, when the duke's\npeople had quitted Romagna, unable with his own power to keep possession\nof Bologna, fled, and Antonio Bentivogli, the head of the opposite\nparty, returned to his country.\nAll this took place during the exile of Cosmo, after whose return,\nthose who had restored him, and a great number of persons injured by the\nopposite party, resolved at all events to make themselves sure of the\ngovernment; and the Signory for the months of November and December, not\ncontent with what their predecessors had done in favor of their party\nextended the term and changed the residences of several who were\nbanished, and increased the number of exiles. In addition to these\nevils, it was observed that citizens were more annoyed on account of\ntheir wealth, their family connections or private animosities, than\nfor the sake of the party to which they adhered, so that if these\nprescriptions had been accompanied with bloodshed, they would have\nresembled those of Octavius and Sylla, though in reality they were not\nwithout some stains; for Antonio di Bernardo Guadagni was beheaded, and\nfour other citizens, among whom were Zanobi dei Belfratelli and Cosmo\nBarbadori, passing the confines to which they were limited, proceeded to\nVenice, where the Venetians, valuing the friendship of Cosmo de' Medici\nmore than their own honor, sent them prisoners to him, and they were\nbasely put to death. This circumstance greatly increased the influence\nof that party, and struck their enemies with terror, finding that such\na powerful republic would so humble itself to the Florentines. This,\nhowever, was supposed to have been done, not so much out of kindness to\nCosmo, as to excite dissensions in Florence, and by means of bloodshed\nmake greater certainty of division among the citizens, for the Venetians\nknew there was no other obstacle to their ambition so great as the union\nof her people.\nThe city being cleared of the enemies, or suspected enemies of the\nstate, those in possession of the government now began to strengthen\ntheir party by conferring benefits upon such as were in a condition\nto serve them, and the family of the Alberti, with all who had been\nbanished by the former government, were recalled. All the nobility,\nwith few exceptions, were reduced to the ranks of the people, and the\npossessions of the exiles were divided among themselves, upon each\npaying a small acknowledgment. They then fortified themselves with new\nlaws and provisos, made new Squittini, withdrawing the names of their\nadversaries from the purses, and filling them with those of their\nfriends. Taking advice from the ruin of their enemies, they considered\nthat to allow the great offices to be filled by mere chance of drawing,\ndid not afford the government sufficient security, they therefore\nresolved that the magistrates possessing the power of life and death\nshould always be chosen from among the leaders of their own party,\nand therefore that the _Accoppiatori_, or persons selected for the\nimborsation of the new Squittini, with the Signory who had to retire\nfrom office, should make the new appointments. They gave to eight of the\nguard authority to proceed capitally, and provided that the exiles, when\ntheir term of banishment was complete, should not be allowed to return,\nunless from the Signory and Colleagues, which were thirty-seven in\nnumber, the consent of thirty-four was obtained. It was made unlawful\nto write to or to receive letters from them; every word, sign, or action\nthat gave offense to the ruling party was punished with the utmost\nrigor; and if there was still in Florence any suspected person whom\nthese regulations did not reach, he was oppressed with taxes imposed for\nthe occasion. Thus in a short time, having expelled or impoverished the\nwhole of the adverse party, they established themselves firmly in the\ngovernment. Not to be destitute of external assistance, and to deprive\nothers of it, who might use it against themselves, they entered into a\nleague, offensive and defensive, with the pope, the Venetians, and the\nduke of Milan.\nCHAPTER II\nDeath of Giovanni II.--Ren\u00e9 of Anjou and Alfonso of Aragon aspire to\nthe kingdom--Alfonso is routed and taken by the Genoese--Alfonso being\na prisoner of the duke of Milan, obtains his friendship--The Genoese\ndisgusted with the duke of Milan--Divisions among the Genoese--The\nGenoese, by means of Francesco Spinola, expel the duke's\ngovernor--League against the duke of Milan--Rinaldo degli Albizzi\nadvises the duke to make war against the Florentines--His discourse to\nthe duke--The duke adopts measures injurious to the Florentines--Niccolo\nPiccinino appointed to command the duke's forces--Preparations of the\nFlorentines--Piccinino routed before Barga.\nThe affairs of Florence being in this condition, Giovanna, queen\nof Naples, died, and by her will appointed Ren\u00e9 of Anjou to be her\nsuccessor. Alfonso, king of Aragon, was at this time in Sicily, and\nhaving obtained the concurrence of many barons, prepared to take\npossession of the kingdom. The Neapolitans, with whom a greater number\nof barons were also associated, favored Ren\u00e9. The pope was unwilling\nthat either of them should obtain it; but desired the affairs of Naples\nto be administered by a governor of his own appointing.\nIn the meantime Alfonso entered the kingdom, and was received by the\nduke of Sessa; he brought with him some princes, whom he had engaged in\nhis service, with the design (already possessing Capua, which the prince\nof Taranto held in his name) of subduing the Neapolitans, and sent his\nfleet to attack Gaeta, which had declared itself in their favor. They\ntherefore demanded assistance of the duke of Milan, who persuaded the\nGenoese to undertake their defense; and they, to satisfy the duke their\nsovereign, and protect the merchandise they possessed, both at Naples\nand Gaeta, armed a powerful fleet. Alfonso hearing of this, augmented\nhis own naval force, went in person to meet the Genoese, and coming up\nwith them near the island of Ponzio, an engagement ensued, in which the\nAragonese were defeated, and Alfonso, with many of the princes of his\nsuite, made prisoners, and sent by the Genoese to the Filippo.\nThis victory terrified the princes of Italy, who, being jealous of the\nduke's power, thought it would give him a great opportunity of being\nsovereign of the whole country. But so contrary are the views of men,\nthat he took a directly opposite course. Alfonso was a man of\ngreat sagacity, and as soon as an opportunity presented itself\nof communicating with Filippo, he proved to him how completely he\ncontravened his own interests, by favoring Ren\u00e9 and opposing himself;\nfor it would be the business of the former, on becoming king of Naples,\nto introduce the French into Milan; that in an emergency he might have\nassistance at hand, without the necessity of having to solicit a passage\nfor his friends. But he could not possibly secure this advantage without\neffecting the ruin of the duke, and making his dominions a French\nprovince; and that the contrary of all this would result from himself\nbecoming lord of Naples; for having only the French to fear, he would be\ncompelled to love and caress, nay even to obey those who had it in their\npower to open a passage for his enemies. That thus the title of king\nof king of Naples would be with himself (Alfonso), but the power and\nauthority with Filippo; so that it was much more the duke's business\nthan his own to consider the danger of one course and the advantage of\nthe other; unless he rather wished to gratify his private prejudices\nthan to give security to his dominions. In the one case he would be a\nfree prince, in the other, placed between two powerful sovereigns, he\nwould either be robbed of his territories or live in constant fear, and\nhave to obey them like a slave. These arguments so greatly influenced\nthe duke, that, changing his design, he set Alfonso at liberty, sent\nhim honorably to Genoa and then to Naples. From thence the king went\nto Gaeta, which as soon as his liberation had become known, was taken\npossession of by some nobles of his party.\nThe Genoese, seeing that the duke, without the least regard for them,\nhad liberated the king, and gained credit to himself through the dangers\nand expense which they had incurred; that he enjoyed all the honor of\nthe liberation, and they were themselves exposed to the odium of the\ncapture, and the injuries consequent upon the king's defeat, were\ngreatly exasperated. In the city of Genoa, while in the enjoyment of her\nliberty, a magistrate is created with the consent of the people, whom\nthey call the Doge; not that he is absolutely a prince, or that he alone\nhas the power of determining matters of government; but that, as the\nhead of the state, he proposes those questions or subjects which have\nto be considered and determined by the magistrates and the councils. In\nthat city are many noble families so powerful, that they are with great\ndifficulty induced to submit to the authority of the law. Of these,\nthe most powerful are the Fregosa and the Adorna, from whom arise the\ndissensions of the city, and the impotence of her civil regulations; for\nthe possession of this high office being contested by means inadmissible\nin well-regulated communities, and most commonly with arms in their\nhands, it always occurs that one party is oppressed and the other\ntriumphant; and sometimes those who fail in the pursuit have recourse to\nthe arms of strangers, and the country they are not allowed to rule they\nsubject to foreign authority. Hence it happens, that those who govern in\nLombardy most commonly command in Genoa, as occurred at the time Alfonso\nof Aragon was made prisoner. Among the leading Genoese who had been\ninstrumental in subjecting the republic to Filippo, was Francesco\nSpinola, who, soon after he had reduced his country to bondage, as\nalways happens in such cases, became suspected by the duke. Indignant at\nthis, he withdrew to a sort of voluntary exile at Gaeta, and being\nthere when the naval expedition was in preparation, and having conducted\nhimself with great bravery in the action, he thought he had again\nmerited so much of the duke's confidence as would obtain for him\npermission to remain undisturbed at Genoa. But the duke still retained\nhis suspicions; for he could not believe that a vacillating defender of\nhis own country's liberty would be faithful to himself; and Francesco\nSpinola resolved again to try his fortune, and if possible restore\nfreedom to his country, and honorable safety for himself; for he was\nthere was no probability of regaining the forfeited affection of\nhis fellow-citizens, but by resolving at his own peril to remedy the\nmisfortunes which he had been so instrumental in producing. Finding the\nindignation against the duke universal, on account of the liberation\nof the king, he thought the moment propitious for the execution of his\ndesign. He communicated his ideas to some whom he knew to be similarly\ninclined, and his arguments ensured their co-operation.\nThe great festival of St. John the Baptist being come, when Arismeno,\nthe new governor sent by the duke, was to enter Genoa, and he being\nalready arrived, accompanied by Opicino, the former governor, and many\nGenoese citizens, Francesco Spinola thought further delay improper; and,\nissuing from his house with those acquainted with his design, all armed,\nthey raised the cry of liberty. It was wonderful to see how eagerly the\ncitizens and people assembled at the word; so that those who for any\nreason might be favorable to Filippo, not only had no time to arm, but\nscarcely to consider the means of escape. Arismeno, with some Genoese,\nfled to the fortress which was held for the duke, Opicino, thinking that\nif he could reach the palace, where two thousand men were in arms, and\nat his command, he might be able either to effect his own safety, or\ninduce his friends to defend themselves, took that direction; but before\nhe arrived at the piazza he was slain, his body divided into many pieces\nand scattered about the city. The Genoese having placed the government\nin the hands of free magistrates, in a few days recovered the castle,\nand the other strongholds possessed by the duke, and delivered\nthemselves entirely from his yoke.\nThese transactions, though at first they had alarmed the princes of\nItaly with the apprehension that the duke would become too powerful,\nnow gave them hope, seeing the turn they had taken, of being able to\nrestrain him; and, notwithstanding the recent league, the Florentines\nand Venetians entered into alliance with the Genoese. Rinaldo degli\nAlbizzi and the other leading Florentine exiles, observing the altered\naspect of affairs, conceived hopes of being able to induce the duke\nto make war against Florence, and having arrived at Milan, Rinaldo\naddressed him in the following manner: \"If we, who were once your\nenemies, come now confidently to supplicate your assistance to enable\nus to return to our country, neither you, nor anyone, who considers the\ncourse and vicissitudes of human affairs, can be at all surprised; for\nof our past conduct toward yourself and our present intentions toward\nour country, we can adduce palpable and abundant reasons. No good man\nwill ever reproach another who endeavors to defend his country, whatever\nbe his mode of doing so; neither have we had any design of injuring\nyou, but only to preserve our country from detriment; and we appeal to\nyourself, whether, during the greatest victories of our league, when you\nwere really desirous of peace, we were not even more anxious for it than\nyourself; so that we do not think we have done aught to make us despair\naltogether of favor from you. Nor can our country itself complain that\nwe now exhort you to use those arms against her, from which we have so\npertinaciously defended her; for that state alone merits the love of\nall her citizens, which cares with equal affection for all; not one that\nfavors a few, and casts from her the great mass of her children. Nor are\nthe arms that men use against their country to be universally condemned;\nfor communities, although composed of many, resemble individual bodies;\nand as in these, many infirmities arise which cannot be cured without\nthe application of fire or of steel, so in the former, there often occur\nsuch numerous and great evils, that a good and merciful citizen, when\nthere is a necessity for the sword, would be much more to blame in\nleaving her uncured, than by using this remedy for her preservation.\nWhat greater disease can afflict a republic than slavery? and what\nremedy is more desirable for adoption than the one by which alone it can\nbe effectually removed? No wars are just but those that are necessary;\nand force is merciful when it presents the only hope of relief. I know\nnot what necessity can be greater than ours, or what compassion can\nexceed that which rescues our country from slavery. Our cause is\ntherefore just, and our purpose merciful, as both yourself and we may\nbe easily convinced. The amplest justice is on your side; for the\nFlorentines have not hesitated, after a peace concluded with so much\nsolemnity, to enter into league with those who have rebelled against\nyou; so that if our cause is insufficient to excite you against them,\nlet your own just indignation do so; and the more so, seeing the\nfacility of the undertaking. You need be under no apprehension from the\nmemory of the past, in which you may have observed the power of\nthat people and their pertinency in self-defense; though these might\nreasonably excite fear, if they were still animated by the valor of\nformer times. But now, all is entirely the reverse; for what power can\nbe expected in a city that has recently expelled the greatest part of\nher wealth and industry? What indomitable resolution need be apprehended\nfrom the people whom so many and such recent enmities have disunited?\nThe disunion which still prevails will prevent wealthy citizens\nadvancing money as they used to do on former occasions; for though men\nwillingly contribute according to their means, when they see their own\ncredit, glory, and private advantage dependent upon it, or when there\nis a hope of regaining in peace what has been spent in war, but not when\nequally oppressed under all circumstances, when in war they suffer the\ninjuries of the enemy, and in peace, the insolence of those who govern\nthem. Besides this, the people feel more deeply the avarice of their\nrulers, than the rapacity of the enemy; for there is hope of being\nultimately relieved from the latter evil, but none from the former.\nThus, in the last war, you had to contend with the whole city; but now\nwith only a small portion. You attempted to take the government from\nmany good citizens; but now you oppose only a few bad ones. You then\nendeavored to deprive a city of her liberty, now you come to restore\nit. As it is unreasonable to suppose that under such disparity of\ncircumstances, the result should be the same, you have now every reason\nto anticipate an easy victory; and how much it will strengthen your own\ngovernment, you may easily judge; having Tuscany friendly, and bound by\nso powerful an obligation, in your enterprises, she will be even of more\nservice to you than Milan. And, although, on former occasions, such an\nacquisition might be looked upon as ambitious and unwarrantable, it will\nnow be considered merciful and just. Then do not let this opportunity\nescape, and be assured, that although your attempts against the city\nhave been attended with difficulty, expense, and disgrace, this will\nwith facility procure you incalculable advantage and an honorable\nrenown.\"\nMany words were not requisite to induce the duke to hostilities against\nthe Florentines, for he was incited to it by hereditary hatred and blind\nambition, and still more, by the fresh injuries which the league with\nthe Genoese involved; yet his past expenses, the dangerous measures\nnecessary, the remembrance of his recent losses, and the vain hopes of\nthe exiles, alarmed him. As soon as he had learned the revolt of Genoa,\nhe ordered Niccolo Piccinino to proceed thither with all his cavalry\nand whatever infantry he could raise, for the purpose of recovering\nher, before the citizens had time to become settled and establish a\ngovernment; for he trusted greatly in the fortress within the city,\nwhich was held for him. And although Niccolo drove the Genoese from\nthe mountains, took from them the valley of Pozeveri, where they had\nentrenched themselves, and obliged them to seek refuge within the walls\nof the city, he still found such an insurmountable obstacle in the\nresolute defense of the citizens, that he was compelled to withdraw. On\nthis, at the suggestion of the Florentine exiles, he commanded Niccolo\nto attack them on the eastern side, upon the confines of Pisa in the\nGenoese territory, and to push the war with his utmost vigor, thinking\nthis plan would manifest and develop the course best to be adopted.\nNiccolo therefore besieged and took Serezana, and having committed great\nravages, by way of further alarming the Florentines he proceeded to\nLucca, spreading a report that it was his intention to go to Naples\nto render assistance to the king of Aragon. Upon these new events Pope\nEugenius left Florence and proceeded to Bologna, where he endeavored\nto effect an amicable arrangement between the league and the duke,\nintimating to the latter, that if he would not consent to some treaty,\nthe pontiff must send Francesco Sforza to assist the league, for the\nlatter was now his confederate, and served in his pay. Although the pope\ngreatly exerted himself in this affair, his endeavors were unavailing;\nfor the duke would not listen to any proposal that did not leave him the\npossession of Genoa, and the league had resolved that she should remain\nfree; and, therefore, each party, having no other resource, prepared to\ncontinue the war.\nIn the meantime Niccolo Piccinino arrived at Lucca, and the Florentines,\nbeing doubtful what course to adopt, ordered Neri di Gino to lead their\nforces into the Pisan territory, induced the pontiff to allow Count\nFrancesco to join him, and with their forces they halted at San Gonda.\nPiccinino then demanded admission into the kingdom of Naples, and this\nbeing refused, he threatened to force a passage. The armies were\nequal, both in regard of numbers and the capacity of their leaders, and\nunwilling to tempt fortune during the bad weather, it being the month of\nDecember, they remained several days without attacking each other. The\nfirst movement was made by Niccolo Piccinino, who being informed that if\nhe attacked Vico Pisano by night, he could easily take possession of\nthe place, made the attempt, and having failed, ravaged the surrounding\ncountry, and then burned and plundered the town of San Giovanni alla\nVena. This enterprise, though of little consequence, excited him to make\nfurther attempts, the more so from being assured that the count and Neri\nwere yet in their quarters, and he attacked Santa Maria in Castello and\nFiletto, both which places he took. Still the Florentine forces would\nnot stir; not that the count entertained any fear, but because, out of\nregard to the pope, who still labored to effect an accommodation, the\ngovernment of Florence had deferred giving their final consent to the\nwar. This course, which the Florentines adopted from prudence, was\nconsidered by the enemy to be only the result of timidity, and with\nincreased boldness they led their forces up to Barga, which they\nresolved to besiege. This new attack made the Florentines set aside\nall other considerations, and resolve not only to relieve Barga, but\nto invade the Lucchese territory. Accordingly the count proceeded in\npursuit of Niccolo, and coming up with him before Barga, an engagement\ntook place, in which Piccinino was overcome, and compelled to raise the\nsiege.\nThe Venetians considering the duke to have broken the peace, send Giovan\nFrancesco da Gonzaga, their captain, to Ghiaradadda, who, by severely\nwasting the duke's territories, induced him to recall Niccolo Piccinino\nfrom Tuscany. This circumstance, together with the victory obtained over\nNiccolo, emboldened the Florentines to attempt the recovery of Lucca,\nsince the duke, whom alone they feared, was engaged with the Venetians,\nand the Lucchese having received the enemy into their city, and allowed\nhim to attack them, would have no ground of complaint.\nCHAPTER III\nThe Florentines go to war with Lucca--Discourse of a citizen of Lucca to\nanimate the plebeians against the Florentines--The Lucchese resolve\nto defend themselves--They are assisted by the duke of Milan--Treaty\nbetween the Florentines and the Venetians--Francesco Sforza, captain of\nthe league, refuses to cross the Po in the service of the Venetians\nand returns to Tuscany--The bad faith of the Venetians toward the\nFlorentines--Cosmo de' Medici at Venice--Peace between the Florentines\nand the Lucchese--The Florentines effect a reconciliation between the\npope and the Count di Poppi--The pope consecrates the church of Santa\nReparata--Council of Florence.\nThe count commenced operations against Lucca in April, 1437, and the\nFlorentines, desirous of recovering what they had themselves lost before\nthey attacked others, retook Santa Maria in Castello, and all the places\nwhich Piccinino had occupied. Then, entering the Lucchese territory,\nthey besieged Camaiore, the inhabitants of which, although faithful\nto their rulers, being influenced more by immediate danger than by\nattachment to their distant friends, surrendered. In the same manner,\nthey obtained Massa and Serezana. Toward the end of May they proceeded\nin the direction of Lucca, burning the towns, destroying the growing\ncrops, grain, trees, and vines, driving away the cattle, and leaving\nnothing undone to injure the enemy. The Lucchese, finding themselves\nabandoned by the duke, and hopeless of defending the open country,\nforsook it; entrenched and fortified the city, which they doubted not,\nbeing well garrisoned, they would be able to defend for a time, and\nthat, in the interim, some event would occur for their relief, as had\nbeen the case during the former wars which the Florentines had carried\non against them. Their only apprehension arose from the fickle minds\nof the plebeians, who, becoming weary of the siege, would have more\nconsideration of their own danger than of other's liberty, and would\nthus compel them to submit to some disgraceful and ruinous capitulation.\nIn order to animate them to defense, they were assembled in the public\npiazza, and some of the eldest and most esteemed of the citizens\naddressed them in the following terms: \"You are doubtless aware that\nwhat is done from necessity involves neither censure nor applause;\ntherefore, if you should accuse us of having caused the present war, by\nreceiving the ducal forces into the city, and allowing them to commit\nhostilities against the Florentines, you are greatly mistaken. You are\nwell acquainted with the ancient enmity of the Florentines against you,\nwhich is not occasioned by any injuries you have done them, or by fear\non their part, but by our weakness and their own ambition; for the one\ngives them hope of being able to oppress us, and the other incites them\nto attempt it. It is then vain to imagine that any merit of yours can\nextinguish that desire in them, or that any offense you can commit, can\nprovoke them to greater animosity. They endeavor to deprive you of your\nliberty; you must resolve to defend it; and whatever they may undertake\nagainst us for that purpose, although we may lament, we need not wonder.\nWe may well grieve, therefore, that they attack us, take possession of\nour towns, burn our houses, and waste our country. But who is so simple\nas to be surprised at it? for were it in our power, we should do just\nthe same to them, or even worse. They declare war against us now, they\nsay, for having received Niccolo; but if we had not received him, they\nwould have done the same and assigned some other ground for it; and if\nthe evil had been delayed, it would most probably have been greater.\nTherefore, you must not imagine it to be occasioned by his arrival, but\nrather by your own ill fortune and their ambition; for we could not have\nrefused admission to the duke's forces, and, being come, we could\nnot prevent their aggressions. You know, that without the aid of some\npowerful ally we are incapable of self-defense, and that none can render\nus this service more powerfully or faithfully than the duke. He restored\nour liberty; it is reasonable to expect he will defend it. He has always\nbeen the greatest foe of our inveterate enemies; if, therefore, to avoid\nincensing the Florentines we had excited his anger, we should have lost\nour best friend, and rendered our enemy more powerful and more disposed\nto oppress us; so that it is far preferable to have this war upon our\nhands, and enjoy the favor of the duke, than to be in peace without it.\nBesides, we are justified in expecting that he will rescue us from the\ndangers into which we are brought on his account, if we only do not\nabandon our own cause. You all know how fiercely the Florentines have\nfrequently assailed us, and with what glory we have maintained our\ndefense. We have often been deprived of every hope, except in God\nand the casualties which time might produce, and both have proved our\nfriends. And as they have delivered us formerly, why should they not\ncontinue to do so. Then we were forsaken by the whole of Italy; now we\nhave the duke in our favor; besides we have a right to suppose that the\nVenetians will not hastily attack us; for they will not willingly see\nthe power of Florence increased. On a former occasion the Florentines\nwere more at liberty; they had greater hope of assistance, and were more\npowerful in themselves, while we were in every respect weaker; for then\na tyrant governed us, now we defend ourselves; then the glory of our\ndefense was another's, now it is our own; then they were in harmony, now\nthey are disunited, all Italy being filled with their banished citizens.\nBut were we without the hope which these favorable circumstances\npresent, our extreme necessity should make us firmly resolved on our\ndefense. It is reasonable to fear every enemy, for all seek their\nown glory and your ruin; above all others, you have to dread the\nFlorentines, for they would not be satisfied by submission and tribute,\nor the dominion of our city, but they would possess our entire substance\nand persons, that they might satiate their cruelty with our blood, and\ntheir avarice with our property, so that all ranks ought to dread them.\nTherefore do not be troubled at seeing our crops destroyed, our towns\nburned, our fortresses occupied; for if we preserve the city, the rest\nwill be saved as a matter of course; if we lose her, all else would be\nof no advantage to us; for while retaining our liberty, the enemy can\nhold them only with the greatest difficulty, while losing it they would\nbe preserved in vain. Arm, therefore; and when in the fight, remember\nthat the reward of victory will be safety, not only to your country, but\nto your homes, your wives, and your children.\" The speaker's last words\nwere received with the utmost enthusiasm by the people, who promised one\nand all to die rather than abandon their cause, or submit to any terms\nthat could violate their liberty. They then made arrangements for the\ndefense of the city.\nIn the meantime, the Florentine forces were not idle; and after\ninnumerable mischiefs done to the country took Monte Carlo by\ncapitulation. They then besieged Uzzano, in order that the Lucchese,\nbeing pressed on all sides, might despair of assistance, and be\ncompelled to submission by famine. The fortress was very strong, and\ndefended by a numerous garrison, so that its capture would be by no\nmeans an easy undertaking. The Lucchese, as might be expected, seeing\nthe imminent peril of their situation, had recourse to the duke, and\nemployed prayers and remonstrances to induce him to render them aid.\nThey enlarged upon their own merits and the offenses of the Florentines;\nand showed how greatly it would attach the duke's friends to him to\nfind they were defended, and how much disaffection it would spread among\nthem, if they were left to be overwhelmed by the enemy; that if they\nlost their liberties and their lives, he would lose his honor and his\nfriends, and forfeit the confidence of all who from affection might be\ninduced to incur dangers in his behalf; and added tears to entreaties,\nso that if he were unmoved by gratitude to them, he might be induced\nto their defense by motives of compassion. The duke, influenced by his\ninveterate hostility against the Florentines, his new obligation to\nthe Lucchese, and, above all, by his desire to prevent so great\nan acquisition from falling into the hands of his ancient enemies,\ndetermined either to send a strong force into Tuscany, or vigorously to\nassail the Venetians, so as to compel the Florentines to give up their\nenterprise and go to their relief.\nIt was soon known in Florence that the duke was preparing to send forces\ninto Tuscany. This made the Florentines apprehensive for the success\nof their enterprise; and in order to retain the duke in Lombardy, they\nrequested the Venetians to press him with their utmost strength. But\nthey also were alarmed, the marquis of Mantua having abandoned them and\ngone over to the duke; and thus, finding themselves almost defenseless,\nthey replied, \"that instead of increasing their responsibilities, they\nshould be unable to perform their part in the war, unless the Count\nFrancesco were sent to them to take the command of the army, and with\nthe special understanding that he should engage to cross the Po in\nperson. They declined to fulfil their former engagements unless he were\nbound to do so; for they could not carry on the war without a leader,\nor repose confidence in any except the count; and he himself would be\nuseless to them, unless he came under an obligation to carry on the\nwar whenever they might think needful.\" The Florentines thought the war\nought to be pushed vigorously in Lombardy; but they saw that if they\nlost the count their enterprise against Lucca was ruined; and they knew\nwell that the demand of the Venetians arose less from any need they had\nof the count, than from their desire to frustrate this expedition. The\ncount, on the other hand, was ready to pass into Lombardy whenever\nthe league might require him, but would not alter the tenor of his\nengagement; for he was unwilling to sacrifice the hope of the alliance\npromised to him by the duke.\nThe Florentines were thus embarrassed by two contrary impulses, the\nwish to possess Lucca, and the dread of a war with Milan. As commonly\nhappens, fear was the most powerful, and they consented, after the\ncapture of Uzzano, that the count should go into Lombardy. There still\nremained another difficulty, which, depending on circumstances beyond\nthe reach of their influence, created more doubts and uneasiness\nthan the former; the count would not consent to pass the Po, and the\nVenetians refused to accept him on any other condition. Seeing no other\nmethod of arrangement, than that each should make liberal concessions,\nthe Florentines induced the count to cross the river by a letter\naddressed to the Signory of Florence, intimating that this private\npromise did not invalidate any public engagement, and that he might\nstill refrain from crossing; hence it resulted that the Venetians,\nhaving commenced the war, would be compelled to proceed, and that the\nevil apprehended by the Florentines would be averted. To the\nVenetians, on the other hand, they averred that this private letter was\nsufficiently binding, and therefore they ought to be content; for if\nthey could save the count from breaking with his father-in-law, it was\nwell to do so, and that it could be of no advantage either to themselves\nor the Venetians to publish it without some manifest necessity. It was\nthus determined that the count should pass into Lombardy; and having\ntaken Uzzano, and raised bastions about Lucca to restrain in her\ninhabitants, placed the management of the siege in the hands of the\ncommissaries, crossed the Apennines, and proceeded to Reggio, when\nthe Venetians, alarmed at his progress, and in order to discover his\nintentions, insisted upon his immediately crossing the Po, and joining\nthe other forces. The count refused compliance, and many mutual\nrecriminations took place between him and Andrea Mauroceno, their\nmessenger on this occasion, each charging the other with arrogance\nand treachery: after many protestations, the one of being under no\nobligation to perform that service, and the other of not being bound to\nany payment, they parted, the count to return to Tuscany, the other to\nVenice.\nThe Florentines had sent the count to encamp in the Pisan territory, and\nwere in hopes of inducing him to renew the war against the Lucchese, but\nfound him indisposed to do so, for the duke, having been informed that\nout of regard to him he had refused to cross the Po, thought that by\nthis means he might also save the Lucchese, and begged the count to\nendeavor to effect an accommodation between the Florentines and the\nLucchese, including himself in it, if he were able, declaring, at\nthe same time, the promised marriage should be solemnized whenever he\nthought proper. The prospect of this connection had great influence with\nthe count, for, as the duke had no sons, it gave him hope of becoming\nsovereign of Milan. For this reason he gradually abated his exertions\nin the war, declared he would not proceed unless the Venetians fulfilled\ntheir engagement as to the payment, and also retained him in the\ncommand; that the discharge of the debt would not alone be sufficient,\nfor desiring to live peaceably in his own dominions, he needed some\nalliance other than that of the Florentines, and that he must regard his\nown interests, shrewdly hinting that if abandoned by the Venetians, he\nwould come to terms with the duke.\nThese indirect and crafty methods of procedure were highly offensive\nto the Florentines, for they found their expedition against Lucca\nfrustrated, and trembled for the safety of their own territories if ever\nthe count and the duke should enter into a mutual alliance. To induce\nthe Venetians to retain the count in the command, Cosmo de' Medici went\nto Venice, hoping his influence would prevail with them, and discussed\nthe subject at great length before the senate, pointing out the\ncondition of the Italian states, the disposition of their armies, and\nthe great preponderance possessed by the duke. He concluded by saying,\nthat if the count and the duke were to unite their forces, they (the\nVenetians) might return to the sea, and the Florentines would have to\nfight for their liberty. To this the Venetians replied, that they were\nacquainted with their own strength and that of the Italians, and thought\nthemselves able at all events to provide for their own defense; that\nit was not their custom to pay soldiers for serving others; that as the\nFlorentines had used the count's services, they must pay him themselves;\nwith respect to the security of their own states, it was rather\ndesirable to check the count's pride than to pay him, for the ambition\nof men is boundless, and if he were now paid without serving, he would\nsoon make some other demand, still more unreasonable and dangerous. It\ntherefore seemed necessary to curb his insolence, and not allow it to\nincrease till it became incorrigible; and that if the Florentines, from\nfear or any other motive, wished to preserve his friendship, they must\npay him themselves. Cosmo returned without having effected any part of\nhis object.\nThe Florentines used the weightiest arguments they could adopt to\nprevent the count from quitting the service of the League, a course he\nwas himself reluctant to follow, but his desire to conclude the marriage\nso embarrassed him, that any trivial accident would have been sufficient\nto determine his course, as indeed shortly happened. The count had\nleft his territories in La Marca to the care of Il Furlano, one of his\nprincipal condottieri, who was so far influenced by the duke as to\ntake command under him, and quit the count's service. This circumstance\ncaused the latter to lay aside every idea but that of his own safety,\nand to come to agreement with the duke; among the terms of which compact\nwas one that he should not be expected to interfere in the affairs of\nRomagna and Tuscany. The count then urged the Florentines to come to\nterms with the Lucchese, and so convinced them of the necessity of this,\nthat seeing no better course to adopt, they complied in April, 1438, by\nwhich treaty the Lucchese retained their liberty, and the Florentines\nMonte Carlo and a few other fortresses. After this, being full\nof exasperation, they despatched letters to every part of Italy,\novercharged with complaints, affecting to show that since God and men\nwere averse to the Lucchese coming under their dominion, they had made\npeace with them. And it seldom happens that any suffer so much for the\nloss of their own lawful property as they did because they could not\nobtain the possessions of others.\nThough the Florentines had now so many affairs in hand, they did not\nallow the proceedings of their neighbors to pass unnoticed, or neglect\nthe decoration of their city. As before observed, Niccolo Fortebraccio\nwas dead. He had married a daughter of the Count di Poppi, who, at\nthe decease of his son-in-law, held the Borgo San Sepolcro, and other\nfortresses of that district, and while Niccolo lived, governed them in\nhis name. Claiming them as his daughter's portion, he refused to give\nthem up to the pope, who demanded them as property held of the church,\nand who, upon his refusal, sent the patriarch with forces to take\npossession of them. The count, finding himself unable to sustain the\nattack, offered them to the Florentines, who declined them; but the pope\nhaving returned to Florence, they interceded with him in the count's\nbehalf. Difficulties arising, the patriarch attacked the Casentino, took\nPrato Vecchio, and Romena, and offered them also to the Florentines, who\nrefused them likewise, unless the pope would consent they should restore\nthem to the count, to which, after much hesitation, he acceded, on\ncondition that the Florentines should prevail with the Count di Poppi\nto restore the Borgo to him. The pope was thus satisfied, and the\nFlorentines having so far completed the building of their cathedral\nchurch of Santa Reparata, which had been commenced long ago, as to\nenable them to perform divine service in it, requested his holiness\nto consecrate it. To this the pontiff willingly agreed, and the\nFlorentines, to exhibit the wealth of the city and the splendor of the\nedifice, and do greater honor to the pope, erected a platform from\nSanta Maria Novella, where he resided, to the cathedral he was about to\nconsecrate, six feet in height and twelve feet wide, covered with rich\ndrapery, for the accommodation of the pontiff and his court, upon which\nthey proceeded to the building, accompanied by those civic magistrates,\nand other officers who were appointed to take part in the procession.\nThe usual ceremonies of consecration having been completed, the pope, to\nshow his affection for the city, conferred the honor of knighthood upon\nGiuliano Davanzati, their Gonfalonier of Justice, and a citizen of the\nhighest reputation; and the Signory, not to appear less gracious than\nthe pope, granted to the new created knight the government of Pisa for\none year.\nThere were at that time certain differences between the Roman and the\nGreek churches, which prevented perfect conformity in divine service;\nand at the last council of B\u00e2le, the prelates of the Western church\nhaving spoken at great length upon the subject, it was resolved that\nefforts should be made to bring the emperor and the Greek prelates to\nthe council at B\u00e2le, to endeavor to reconcile the Greek church with the\nRoman. Though this resolution was derogatory to the majesty of the Greek\nempire, and offensive to its clergy, yet being then oppressed by the\nTurks, and fearing their inability for defense, in order to have a\nbetter ground for requesting assistance, they submitted; and therefore,\nthe emperor, the patriarch, with other prelates and barons of Greece,\nto comply with the resolution of the council, assembled at B\u00e2le, came\nto Venice; but being terrified by the plague then prevailing, it was\nresolved to terminate their differences at Florence. The Roman and Greek\nprelates having held a conference during several days, in which many\nlong discussions took place, the Greeks yielded, and agreed to adopt the\nritual of the church of Rome.\nCHAPTER IV\nNew wars in Italy--Niccolo Piccinino, in concert with the duke of\nMilan, deceives the pope, and takes many places from the church--Niccolo\nattacks the Venetians--Fears and precautions of the Florentines--The\nVenetians request assistance of the Florentines and of Sforza--League\nagainst the duke of Milan--The Florentines resolve to send the count to\nassist the Venetians--Neri di Gino Capponi at Venice--His discourse to\nthe senate--Extreme joy of the Venetians.\nPeace being restored between the Lucchese and Florentines, and the duke\nand the count having become friends, hopes were entertained that the\narms of Italy would be laid aside, although those in the kingdom of\nNaples, between Ren\u00e9 of Anjou and Alfonso of Aragon, could find repose\nonly by the ruin of one party or the other. And though the pope was\ndissatisfied with the loss of so large a portion of his territories,\nand the ambition of the duke and the Venetians was obvious, still it was\nthought that the pontiff, from necessity, and the others from weariness,\nwould be advocates of peace. However, a different state of feeling\nprevailed, for neither the duke nor the Venetians were satisfied with\ntheir condition; so that hostilities were resumed, and Lombardy and\nTuscany were again harassed by the horrors of war. The proud mind of\nthe duke could not endure that the Venetians should possess Bergamo and\nBrescia, and he was still further annoyed, by hearing, that they were\nconstantly in arms, and in the daily practice of annoying some portion\nof his territories. He thought, however, that he should not only be able\nto restrain them, but to recover the places he had lost, if the pope,\nthe Florentines, and the count could be induced to forego the Venetian\nalliance. He therefore resolved to take Romagna from the pontiff,\nimagining that his holiness could not injure him, and that the\nFlorentines, finding the conflagration so near, either for their own\nsake would refrain from interference, or if they did not, could not\nconveniently attack him. The duke was also aware of the resentment\nof the Florentines against the Venetians, on account of the affair of\nLucca, and he therefore judged they would be the less eager to take\narms against him on their behalf. With regard to the Count Francesco,\nhe trusted that their new friendship, and the hope of his alliance would\nkeep him quiet. To give as little color as possible for complaint, and\nto lull suspicion, particularly, because in consequence of his treaty\nwith the count, the latter could not attack Romagna, he ordered Niccolo\nPiccinino, as if instigated by his own ambition to do so.\nWhen the agreement between the duke and the count was concluded, Niccolo\nwas in Romagna, and in pursuance of his instructions from the duke,\naffected to be highly incensed, that a connection had been established\nbetween him and the count, his inveterate enemy. He therefore withdrew\nhimself and his forces to Camurata, a place between Furli and Ravenna,\nwhich he fortified, as if designing to remain there some time, or till a\nnew enterprise should present itself. The report of his resentment being\ndiffused, Niccolo gave the pope to understand how much the duke was\nunder obligation to him, and how ungrateful he proved; and he was\npersuaded that, possessing nearly all the arms of Italy, under the\ntwo principal generals, he could render himself sole ruler: but if\nhis holiness pleased, of the two principal generals whom he fancied\nhe possessed, one would become his enemy, and the other be rendered\nuseless; for, if money were provided him, and he were kept in pay, he\nwould attack the territories held of the church by the count, who being\ncompelled to look to his own interests, could not subserve the ambition\nof Filippo. The pope giving entire credence to this representation,\non account of its apparent reasonableness, sent Niccolo five thousand\nducats and loaded him with promises of states for himself and his\nchildren. And though many informed him of the deception, he could not\ngive credit to them, nor would he endure the conversation of any who\nseemed to doubt the integrity of Niccolo's professions. The city of\nRavenna was held for the church by Ostasio da Polenta. Niccolo finding\nfurther delay would be detrimental, since his son Francesco had, to the\npope's great dishonor, pillaged Spoleto, determined to attack Ravenna,\neither because he judged the enterprise easy, or because he had a secret\nunderstanding with Ostasio, for in a few days after the attack, the\nplace capitulated. He then took Bologna, Imola, and Furli; and (what\nis worthy of remark) of twenty fortresses held in that country for the\npope, not one escaped falling into his hands. Not satisfied with these\ninjuries inflicted on the pontiff, he resolved to banter him by his\nwords as well as ridicule him by his deeds, and wrote, that he had only\ndone as his holiness deserved, for having unblushingly attempted to\ndivide two such attached friends as the duke and himself, and for having\ndispersed over Italy letters intimating that he had quitted the duke\nto take part with the Venetians. Having taken possession of Romagna,\nNiccolo left it under the charge of his son, Francesco, and with the\ngreater part of his troops, went into Lombardy, where joining the\nremainder of the duke's forces, he attacked the country about Brescia,\nand having soon completely conquered it, besieged the city itself.\nThe duke, who desired the Venetians to be left defenseless, excused\nhimself to the pope, the Florentines, and the count, saying, that if the\ndoings of Niccolo were contrary to the terms of the treaty, they were\nequally contrary to his wishes, and by secret messengers, assured them\nthat when an occasion presented itself, he would give them a convincing\nproof that they had been performed in disobedience to his instructions.\nNeither the count nor the Florentines believed him, but thought, with\nreason, that these enterprises had been carried on to keep them at\nbay, till he had subdued the Venetians, who, being full of pride, and\nthinking themselves able alone to resist the duke, had not deigned to\nask for any assistance, but carried on the war under their captain,\nGattamelata.\nCount Francesco would have wished, with the consent of the Florentines,\nto go to the assistance of king Ren\u00e9, if the events of Romagna and\nLombardy had not hindered him; and the Florentines would willingly have\nconsented, from their ancient friendship to the French dynasty, but the\nduke was entirely in favor of Alfonso. Each being engaged in wars near\nhome, refrained from distant undertakings. The Florentines, finding\nRomagna occupied with the duke's forces, and the Venetians defeated, as\nif foreseeing their own ruin in that of others, entreated the count to\ncome to Tuscany, where they might consider what should be done to resist\nFilippo's power, which was now greater than it had ever before been;\nassuring him that if his insolence were not in some way curbed, all the\npowers of Italy would soon have to submit to him. The count felt the\nforce of the fears entertained by the Florentines, but his desire to\nsecure the duke's alliance kept him in suspense; and the duke, aware\nof this desire, gave him the greatest assurance that his hopes would\nbe realized as shortly as possible, if he abstained from hostilities\nagainst him. As the lady was now of marriageable age, the duke had\nfrequently made all suitable preparations for the celebration of the\nceremony, but on one pretext or another they had always been wholly set\naside. He now, to give the count greater confidence, added deeds to his\nwords, and sent him thirty thousand florins, which, by the terms of the\nmarriage contract, he had engaged to pay.\nStill the war in Lombardy proceeded with greater vehemence than ever;\nthe Venetians constantly suffered fresh losses of territory, and the\nfleets they equipped upon the rivers were taken by the duke's forces;\nthe country around Verona and Brescia was entirely occupied, and the\ntwo cities themselves so pressed, that their speedy fall was generally\nanticipated. The marquis of Mantua, who for many years had led the\nforces of their republic, quite unexpectedly resigned his command, and\nwent over to the duke's service. Thus the course which pride prevented\nthem from adopting at the commencement of the war, fear compelled them\nto take during its progress; for knowing there was no help for them but\nin the friendship of the Florentines and the count, they began to make\novertures to obtain it, though with shame and apprehension; for they\nwere afraid of receiving a reply similar to that which they had\ngiven the Florentines, when the latter applied for assistance in the\nenterprise against Lucca and the count's affairs. However, they found\nthe Florentines more easily induced to render aid than they expected, or\ntheir conduct deserved; so much more were the former swayed by hatred of\ntheir ancient enemy, than by resentment of the ingratitude of their\nold and habitual friends. Having foreseen the necessity into which the\nVenetians must come, they had informed the count that their ruin must\ninvolve his own; that he was deceived if he thought the duke, while\nfortune, would esteem him more than if he were in adversity; that the\nduke was induced to promise him his daughter by the fear he entertained\nof him; that what necessity occasions to be promised, it also causes to\nbe performed; and it was therefore desirable to keep the duke in that\nnecessity, which could be done without supporting the power of the\nVenetians. Therefore he might perceive, that if the Venetians were\ncompelled to abandon their inland territories, he would not only lose\nthe advantages derivable from them, but also those to be obtained from\nsuch as feared them; and that if he considered well the powers of\nItaly, he would see that some were poor, and others hostile; that the\nFlorentines alone were not, as he had often said, sufficient for his\nsupport; so that on every account it was best to keep the Venetians\npowerful by land. These arguments, conjoined with the hatred which the\ncount had conceived against Filippo, by supposing himself duped with\nregard to the promised alliance, induced him to consent to a new treaty;\nbut still he would not consent to cross the Po. The agreement was\nconcluded in February, 1438; the Venetians agreeing to pay two-thirds of\nthe expense of the war, the Florentines one-third, and each engaging to\ndefend the states which the count possessed in La Marca. Nor were these\nthe only forces of the league, for the lord of Faenza, the sons of\nPandolfo Malatesti da Rimino and Pietro Giampagolo Orsini also joined\nthem. They endeavored, by very liberal offers, to gain over the marquis\nof Mantua, but could not prevail against the friendship and stipend of\nthe duke; and the lord of Faenza, after having entered into compact with\nthe league, being tempted by more advantageous terms, went over to him.\nThis made them despair of being able to effect an early settlement of\nthe troubles of Romagna.\nThe affairs of Lombardy were in this condition: Brescia was so closely\nbesieged by the duke's forces, that constant apprehensions were\nentertained of her being compelled by famine to a surrender; while\nVerona was so pressed, that a similar fate was expected to await her,\nand if one of these cities were lost, all the other preparations for the\nwar might be considered useless, and the expenses already incurred as\ncompletely wasted. For this there was no remedy, but to send the count\ninto Lombardy; and to this measure three obstacles presented themselves.\nThe first was, to induce him to cross the Po, and prosecute the war in\nwhatever locality might be found most advisable; the second, that the\ncount being at a distance, the Florentines would be left almost at the\nmercy of the duke, who, issuing from any of his fortresses, might with\npart of his troops keep the count at bay, and with the rest introduce\ninto Tuscany the Florentine exiles, whom the existing government already\ndreaded; the third was, to determine what route the count should take to\narrive safely in the Paduan territory, and join the Venetian forces. Of\nthese three difficulties, the second, which particularly regarded the\nFlorentines, was the most serious; but, knowing the necessity of the\ncase, and wearied out by the Venetians, who with unceasing importunity\ndemanded the count, intimating that without him they should abandon all\nhope, they resolved to relieve their allies rather than listen to the\nsuggestions of their own fears. There still remained the question about\nthe route to be taken, for the safety of which they determined the\nVenetians should provide; and as they had sent Neri Capponi to treat\nwith the count and induce him to cross the Po, they determined that the\nsame person should also proceed to Venice, in order to make the benefit\nthe more acceptable to the Signory, and see that all possible security\nwere given to the passage of the forces.\nNeri embarked at Cesena and went to Venice; nor was any prince ever\nreceived with so much honor as he was; for upon his arrival, and the\nmatters which his intervention was to decide and determine, the safety\nof the republic seemed to depend. Being introduced to the senate, and\nin presence of the Doge, he said, \"The Signory of Florence, most serene\nprince, has always perceived in the duke's greatness the source of ruin\nboth to this republic and our own, and that the safety of both states\ndepends upon their separate strength and mutual confidence. If such had\nbeen the opinion of this illustrious Signory, we should ourselves have\nbeen in better condition, and your republic would have been free from\nthe dangers that now threaten it. But as at the proper crisis you\nwithheld from us confidence and aid, we could not come to the relief of\nyour distress, nor could you, being conscious of this, freely ask us;\nfor neither in your prosperity nor adversity have you clearly perceived\nour motives. You have not observed, that those whose deeds have once\nincurred our hatred, can never become entitled to our regard; nor can\nthose who have once merited our affection ever after absolutely cancel\ntheir claim. Our attachment to your most serene Signory is well known to\nyou all, for you have often seen Lombardy filled with our forces and\nour money for your assistance. Our hereditary enmity to Filippo and his\nhouse is universally known, and it is impossible that love or hatred,\nstrengthened by the growth of years, can be eradicated from our minds\nby any recent act either of kindness or neglect. We have always thought,\nand are still of the same opinion, that we might now remain neutral,\ngreatly to the duke's satisfaction, and with little hazard to ourselves;\nfor if by your ruin he were to become lord of Lombardy, we should still\nhave sufficient influence in Italy in free us from any apprehension on\nour own account; for every increase of power and territory augments\nthat animosity and envy, from which arise wars and the dismemberment\nof states. We are also aware what heavy expenses and imminent perils we\nshould avoid, by declining to involve ourselves in these disputes;\nand how easily the field of battle may be transferred from Lombardy to\nTuscany, by our interference in your behalf. Yet all these apprehensions\nare at once overborne by our ancient affection for the senate and people\nof Venice, and we have resolved to come to your relief with the same\nzeal with which we should have armed in our own defense, had we been\nattacked. Therefore, the senate of Florence, judging it primarily\nnecessary to relieve Verona and Brescia, and thinking this impossible\nwithout the count, have sent me, in the first instance, to persuade\nhim to pass into Lombardy, and carry on the war wherever it may be most\nneedful; for you are aware he is under no obligation to cross the Po. To\ninduce him to do so, I have advanced such arguments as are suggested by\nthe circumstances themselves, and which would prevail with us. He, being\ninvincible in arms, cannot be surpassed in courtesy, and the liberality\nhe sees the Florentines exercise toward you, he has resolved to outdo;\nfor he is well aware to what dangers Tuscany will be exposed after\nhis departure, and since we have made your affairs our primary\nconsideration, he has also resolved to make his own subservient to\nyours. I come, therefore, to tender his services, with seven thousand\ncavalry and two thousand infantry, ready at once to march against the\nenemy, wherever he may be. And I beg of you, so do my lords at Florence\nand the count, that as his forces exceed the number he has engaged to\nfurnish you, out of your liberality, would remunerate him, that he may\nnot repent of having come to your assistance, nor we, who have prevailed\nwith him to do so.\" This discourse of Neri to the senate was listened\nto with that profound attention which an oracle might be imagined to\ncommand; and his audience were so moved by it, that they could not\nrestrain themselves, till the prince had replied, as strict decorum\non such occasions required, but rising from their seats, with uplifted\nhands, and most of them with tears in their eyes, they thanked the\nFlorentines for their generous conduct, and the ambassador for his\nunusual dispatch; and promised that time should never cancel the\nremembrance of such goodness, either in their own hearts, or their\nchildren's; and that their country, thenceforth, should be common to the\nFlorentines with themselves.\nCHAPTER V\nFrancesco Sforza marches to assist the Venetians, and relieves\nVerona--He attempts to relieve Brescia but fails--The Venetians routed\nby Piccinino upon the Lake of Garda--Piccinino routed by Sforza;\nthe method of his escape--Piccinino surprises Verona--Description of\nVerona--Recovered by Sforza--The duke of Milan makes war against the\nFlorentines--Apprehensions of the Florentines--Cardinal Vitelleschi\ntheir enemy.\nWhen their demonstrations of gratitude had subsided, the Venetian\nsenate, by the aid of Neri di Gino, began to consider the route the\ncount ought to take, and how to provide him with necessaries. There were\nfour several roads; one by Ravenna, along the beach, which on account of\nits being in many places interrupted by the sea and by marshes, was not\napproved. The next was the most direct, but rendered inconvenient by a\ntower called the Uccellino, which being held for the duke, it would be\nnecessary to capture; and to do this, would occupy more time than could\nbe spared with safety to Verona and Brescia. The third was by the brink\nof the lake; but as the Po had overflowed its banks, to pass in this\ndirection was impossible. The fourth was by the way of Bologna to Ponte\nPuledrano, Cento, and Pieve; then between the Bondeno and the Finale\nto Ferrara, and thence they might by land or water enter the Paduan\nterritory, and join the Venetian forces. This route, though attended\nwith many difficulties, and in some parts liable to be disputed by the\nenemy, was chosen as the least objectionable. The count having received\nhis instructions, commenced his march, and by exerting the utmost\ncelerity, reached the Paduan territory on the twentieth of June. The\narrival of this distinguished commander in Lombardy filled Venice and\nall her dependencies with hope; for the Venetians, who only an instant\nbefore had been in fear for their very existence, began to contemplate\nnew conquests.\nThe count, before he made any other attempt, hastened to the relief of\nVerona; and to counteract his design, Niccolo led his forces to Soave, a\ncastle situated between the Vincentino and the Veronese, and entrenched\nhimself by a ditch that extended from Soave to the marshes of the Adige.\nThe count, finding his passage by the plain cut off, resolved to proceed\nby the mountains, and thus reach Verona, thinking Niccolo would imagine\nthis way to be so rugged and elevated as to be impracticable, or if\nhe thought otherwise, he would not be in time to prevent him; so, with\nprovisions for eight days, he took the mountain path, and with his\nforces, arrived in the plain, below Soave. Niccolo had, even upon this\nroute, erected some bastions for the purpose of preventing him, but they\nwere insufficient for the purpose; and finding the enemy had, contrary\nto his expectations, effected a passage, to avoid a disadvantageous\nengagement he crossed to the opposite side of the Adige, and the count\nentered Verona without opposition.\nHaving happily succeeded in his first project, that of relieving Verona,\nthe count now endeavored to render a similar service to Brescia. This\ncity is situated so close to the Lake of Garda, that although besieged\nby land, provisions may always be sent into it by water. On this account\nthe duke had assembled a large force in the immediate vicinity of the\nlake, and at the commencement of his victories occupied all the places\nwhich by its means might relieve Brescia. The Venetians also had galleys\nupon the lake, but they were unequal to a contest with those of the\nduke. The count therefore deemed it advisable to aid the Venetian fleet\nwith his land forces, by which means he hoped to obtain without much\ndifficulty those places which kept Brescia in blockade. He therefore\nencamped before Bardolino, a fortress situated upon the lake, trusting\nthat after it was taken the others would surrender. But fortune opposed\nthis design, for a great part of his troops fell sick; so, giving up\nthe enterprise, he went to Zevio, a Veronese castle, in a healthy and\nplentiful situation. Niccolo, upon the count's retreat, not to let slip\nan opportunity of making himself master of the lake, left his camp at\nVegasio, and with a body of picked men took the way thither, attacked\nthe Venetian fleet with the utmost impetuosity, and took nearly the\nwhole of it. By this victory almost all the fortresses upon the lake\nfell into his hands.\nThe Venetians, alarmed at this loss, and fearing that in consequence\nof it Brescia would surrender, solicited the count, by letters and\nmessengers, to go to its relief; and he, perceiving that all hope of\nrendering assistance from the lake was cut off, and that to attempt\nan approach by land, on account of the ditches, bastions, and other\ndefenses erected by Niccolo, was marching to certain destruction,\ndetermined that as the passage by the mountains had enabled him to\nrelieve Verona, it should also contribute to the preservation of\nBrescia. Having taken this resolution, the count left Zevio, and by way\nof the Val d'Acri went to the Lake of St. Andrea, and thence to Torboli\nand Peneda, upon the Lake of Garda. He then proceeded to Tenna, and\nbesieged the fortress, which it was necessary to occupy before he could\nreach Brescia.\nNiccolo, on being acquainted with the count's design, led his army to\nPeschiera. He then, with the marquis of Mantua and a chosen body of men,\nwent to meet him, and coming to an engagement, was routed, his people\ndispersed, and many of them taken, while others fled to the fleet, and\nsome to the main body of his army. It was now nightfall, and Niccolo\nhad escaped to Tenna, but he knew that if he were to remain there till\nmorning, he must inevitably fall into the enemy's hands; therefore, to\navoid a catastrophe which might be regarded as almost fatal, he resolved\nto make a dangerous experiment. Of all his attendants he had only with\nhim a single servant, a Dutchman, of great personal strength, and who\nhad always been devotedly attached to him. Niccolo induced this man\nto take him upon his shoulders in a sack, as if he had been carrying\nproperty of his master's, and to bear him to a place of security. The\nenemy's lines surrounded Tenna, but on account of the previous day's\nvictory, all was in disorder, and no guard was kept, so that the\nDutchman, disguised as a trooper, passed through them without any\nopposition, and brought his master in safety to his own troops.\nHad this victory been as carefully improved as it was fortunately\nobtained, Brescia would have derived from it greater relief and the\nVenetians more permanent advantage; but they, having thoughtlessly let\nit slip, the rejoicings were soon over, and Brescia remained in her\nformer difficulties. Niccolo, having returned to his forces, resolved by\nsome extraordinary exertion to cancel the impression of his death,\nand deprive the Venetians of the change of relieving Brescia. He was\nacquainted with the topography of the citadel of Verona, and had learned\nfrom prisoners whom he had taken, that it was badly guarded, and might\nbe very easily recovered. He perceived at once that fortune presented\nhim with an opportunity of regaining the laurels he had lately lost, and\nof changing the joy of the enemy for their recent victory into sorrow\nfor a succeeding disaster. The city of Verona is situated in Lombardy,\nat the foot of the mountains which divide Italy from Germany, so that\nit occupies part both of hill and plain. The river Adige rises in the\nvalley of Trento, and entering Italy, does not immediately traverse the\ncountry, but winding to the left, along the base of the hills, enters\nVerona, and crosses the city, which it divides unequally, giving much\nthe larger portion to the plain. On the mountain side of the river are\ntwo fortresses, formidable rather from their situation than from their\nactual strength, for being very elevated they command the whole place.\nOne is called San Piero, the other San Felice. On the opposite side of\nthe Adige, upon the plain, with their backs against the city walls, are\ntwo other fortresses, about a mile distant from each other, one called\nthe Old the other the New Citadel, and a wall extends between them that\nmay be compared to a bowstring, of which the city wall is the arc. The\nspace comprehended within this segment is very populous, and is called\nthe Borgo of St. Zeno. Niccolo Piccinino designed to capture these\nfortresses and the Borgo, and he hoped to succeed without much\ndifficulty, as well on account of the ordinary negligence of the guard,\nwhich their recent successes would probably increase, as because in\nwar no enterprise is more likely to be successful than one which by the\nenemy is deemed impossible. With a body of picked men, and accompanied\nby the marquis of Mantua, he proceeded by night to Verona, silently\nscaled the walls, and took the New Citadel: then entering the place with\nhis troops, he forced the gate of S. Antonio, and introduced the whole\nof his cavalry. The Venetian garrison of the Old Citadel hearing an\nuproar, when the guards of the New were slaughtered, and again when the\ngate was forced, being now aware of the presence of enemies, raised an\nalarm, and called the people to arms. The citizens awaking in the\nutmost confusion, some of the boldest armed and hastened to the rector's\npiazza. In the meantime, Niccolo's forces had pillaged the Borgo of San\nZeno; and proceeding onward were ascertained by the people to be the\nduke's forces, but being defenseless they advised the Venetian rectors\nto take refuge in the fortresses, and thus save themselves and the\nplace; as it was more advisable to preserve their lives and so rich a\ncity for better fortune, than by endeavoring to repel the present evil,\nencounter certain death, and incur universal pillage. Upon this the\nrectors and all the Venetian party, fled to the fortress of San Felice.\nSome of the first citizens, anxious to avoid being plundered by the\ntroops, presented themselves before Niccolo and the marquis of Mantua,\nand begged they would rather take possession of a rich city, with honor\nto themselves, than of a poor one to their own disgrace; particularly as\nthey had not induced either the favor of its former possessors, or\nthe animosity of its present masters, by self-defense. The marquis and\nNiccolo encouraged them, and protected their property to the utmost of\ntheir power during such a state of military license. As they felt sure\nthe count would endeavor to recover the city, they made every possible\nexertion to gain possession of the fortresses, and those they could not\nseize they cut off from the rest of the place by ditches and barricades,\nso that the enemy might be shut out.\nThe Count Francesco was with his army at Tenna; and when the report was\nfirst brought to him he refused to credit it; but being assured of\nthe fact by parties whom it would have been ridiculous to doubt, he\nresolved, by the exertion of uncommon celerity, to repair the evil\nnegligence had occasioned; and though all his officers advised the\nabandonment of Verona and Brescia, and a march to Vicenza, lest he\nmight be besieged by the enemy in his present situation, he refused, but\nresolved to attempt the recovery of Verona. During the consultation, he\nturned to the Venetian commissaries and to Bernardo de' Medici, who was\nthere as commissary for the Florentines, and promised them the recovery\nof the place if one of the fortresses should hold out. Having collected\nhis forces, he proceeded with the utmost speed to Verona. Observing his\napproach, Niccolo thought he designed, according to the advice he had\nreceived, to go to Vicenza, but finding him continue to draw near, and\ntaking the direction of San Felice, he prepared for its defense--though\ntoo late; for the barricades were not completed; his men were dispersed\nin quest of plunder, or extorting money from the inhabitants by way of\nransom; and he could not collect them in time to prevent the count's\ntroops from entering the fortress. They then descended into the city,\nwhich they happily recovered, to Niccolo's disgrace, and with the loss\nof great numbers of his men. He himself, with the marquis of Mantua,\nfirst took refuge in the citadel, and thence escaping into the country,\nfled to Mantua, where, having assembled the relics of their army, they\nhastened to join those who were at the siege of Brescia. Thus in four\ndays Verona was lost and again recovered from the duke. The count, after\nthis victory, it being now winter and the weather very severe, having\nfirst with considerable difficulty thrown provisions into Brescia,\nwent into quarters at Verona, and ordered, that during the cold season,\ngalleys should be provided at Torboli, that upon the return of spring,\nthey might be in a condition to proceed vigorously to effect the\npermanent relief of Brescia.\nThe duke, finding the war suspended for a time, the hope he had\nentertained of occupying Brescia and Verona annihilated, and the money\nand counsels of the Florentines the cause of this, and seeing that\nneither the injuries they had received from the Venetians could alienate\nthem, nor all the promises he had made attach them to himself, he\ndetermined, in order to make them feel more closely the effects of the\ncourse they had adopted, to attack Tuscany; to which he was strenuously\nadvised by the Florentine exiles and Niccolo. The latter advocated this\nfrom his desire to recover the states of Braccio, and expel the count\nfrom La Marca; the former, from their wish to return home, and each\nby suitable arguments endeavored to induce the duke to follow the plan\ncongenial to their own views. Niccolo argued that he might be sent into\nTuscany, and continue the siege of Brescia; for he was master of\nthe lake, the fortresses were well provided, and their officers were\nqualified to oppose the count should he undertake any fresh enterprise;\nwhich it was not likely he would do without first relieving Brescia, a\nthing impossible; and thus the duke might carry on the war in Tuscany,\nwithout giving up his attempts in Lombardy; intimating that the\nFlorentines would be compelled, as soon as he entered Tuscany, to recall\nthe count to avoid complete ruin; and whatever course they took, victory\nto the duke must be the result. The exiles affirmed, that if Niccolo\nwith his army were to approach Florence, the people oppressed with\ntaxes, and wearied out by the insolence of the great, would most\nassuredly not oppose him, and pointed out the facility of reaching\nFlorence; for the way by the Casentino would be open to them, through\nthe friendship of Rinaldo and the Count di Poppi; and thus the duke,\nwho was previously inclined to the attempt, was induced by their joint\npersuasions to make it. The Venetians, on the other hand, though the\nwinter was severe, incessantly urged the count to relieve Brescia with\nall his forces. The count questioned the possibility of so doing, and\nadvised them to wait the return of spring, in the meantime strengthening\ntheir fleet as much as possible, and then assist it both by land and\nwater. This rendered the Venetians dissatisfied; they were dilatory in\nfurnishing provisions, and consequently many deserted from their army.\nThe Florentines, being informed of these transactions, became alarmed,\nperceiving the war threatening themselves, and the little progress made\nin Lombardy. Nor did the suspicion entertained by them of the troops of\nthe church give them less uneasiness; not that the pope was their enemy,\nbut because they saw those forces more under the sway of the patriarch,\nwho was their greatest foe. Giovanni Vitelleschi of Corneto was at first\napostolic notary, then bishop of Recanati, and afterward patriarch of\nAlexandria; but at last, becoming a cardinal, he was called Cardinal of\nFlorence. He was bold and cunning; and, having obtained great influence,\nwas appointed to command all the forces of the church, and conduct all\nthe enterprises of the pontiff, whether in Tuscany, Romagna, the kingdom\nof Naples, or in Rome. Hence he acquired so much power over the pontiff,\nand the papal troops, that the former was afraid of commanding him, and\nthe latter obeyed no one else. The cardinal's presence at Rome, when\nthe report came of Niccolo's design to march into Tuscany, redoubled the\nfear of the Florentines; for, since Rinaldo was expelled, he had become\nan enemy of the republic, from finding that the arrangements made by his\nmeans were not only disregarded, but converted to Rinaldo's prejudice,\nand caused the laying down of arms, which had given his enemies an\nopportunity of banishing him. In consequence of this, the government\nthought it would be advisable to restore and indemnify Rinaldo, in case\nNiccolo came into Tuscany and were joined by him. Their apprehensions\nwere increased by their being unable to account for Niccolo's departure\nfrom Lombardy, and his leaving one enterprise almost completed, to\nundertake another so entirely doubtful; which they could not reconcile\nwith their ideas of consistency, except by supposing some new design had\nbeen adopted, or some hidden treachery intended. They communicated their\nfears to the pope, who was now sensible of his error in having endowed\nthe cardinal with too much authority.\nCHAPTER VI\nThe pope imprisons the cardinal and assists the Florentines--Difference\nof opinion between the count and the Venetians respecting the management\nof the war. The Florentines reconcile them--The count wishes to go into\nTuscany to oppose Piccinino, but is prevented by the Venetians--Niccolo\nPiccinino in Tuscany--He takes Marradi, and plunders the neighborhood\nof Florence--Description of Marradi--Cowardice of Bartolomeo\nOrlandini--Brave resistance of Castel San Niccolo--San Niccolo\nsurrenders--Piccinino attempts to take Cortona, but fails.\nWhile the Florentines were thus anxious, fortune disclosed the means of\nsecuring themselves against the patriarch's malevolence. The republic\neverywhere exercised the very closest espionage over epistolary\ncommunication, in order to discover if any persons were plotting against\nthe state. It happened that letters were intercepted at Monte Pulciano,\nwhich had been written by the patriarch to Niccolo without the pope's\nknowledge; and although they were written in an unusual character, and\nthe sense so involved that no distinct idea could be extracted, the\nobscurity itself, and the whole aspect of the matter so alarmed the\npontiff, that he resolved to seize the person of the cardinal, a duty he\ncommitted to Antonio Rido, of Padua, who had the command of the castle\nof St. Angelo, and who, after receiving his instructions, soon found\nan opportunity of carrying them into effect. The patriarch, having\ndetermined to go into Tuscany, prepared to leave Rome on the following\nday, and ordered the castellan to be upon the drawbridge of the fortress\nin the morning, for he wished to speak with him as he passed. Antonio\nperceived this to be the favorable moment, informed his people what they\nwere to do, and awaited the arrival of the patriarch upon the bridge,\nwhich adjoined the building, and might for the purpose of security be\nraised or lowered as occasion required. The appointed time found him\npunctual; and Antonio, having drawn him, as if for the convenience\nof conversation, on to the bridge, gave a signal to his men, who\nimmediately raised it, and in a moment the cardinal, from being a\ncommander of armies, found himself a prisoner of the castellan. The\npatriarch's followers at first began to use threats, but being informed\nof the pope's directions they were appeased. The castellan comforting\nhim with kind words, he replied, that \"the great do not make each other\nprisoners to let them go again; and that those whom it is proper to\ntake, it is not well to set free.\" He shortly afterward died in prison.\nThe pope appointed Lodovico, patriarch of Aquileia, to command his\ntroops; and, though previously unwilling to interfere in the wars of\nthe league and the duke, he was now content to take part in them, and\nengaged to furnish four thousand horse and two thousand foot for the\ndefense of Tuscany.\nThe Florentines, freed from this cause for anxiety, were still\napprehensive of Niccolo, and feared confusion in the affairs of\nLombardy, from the differences of opinion that existed between the count\nand the Venetians. In order the better to become acquainted with the\nintentions of the parties, they sent Neri di Gini Capponi and Giuliano\nDavanzati to Venice, with instructions to assist in the arrangement of\nthe approaching campaign; and ordered that Neri, having discovered how\nthe Venetians were disposed, should proceed to the count, learn\nhis designs, and induce him to adopt the course that would be most\nadvantageous to the League. The ambassadors had only reached Ferrara,\nwhen they were told that Niccolo Piccinino had crossed the Po with six\nthousand horse. This made them travel with increased speed; and, having\narrived at Venice, they found the Signory fully resolved that Brescia\nshould be relieved without waiting for the return of spring; for they\nsaid that \"the city would be unable to hold out so long, the fleet could\nnot be in readiness, and that seeing no more immediate relief, she would\nsubmit to the enemy; which would render the duke universally victorious,\nand cause them to lose the whole of their inland possessions.\" Neri then\nproceeded to Verona to ascertain the count's opinion, who argued, for\nmany reasons, that to march to Brescia before the return of spring would\nbe quite useless, or even worse; for the situation of Brescia, being\nconsidered in conjunction with the season, nothing could be expected to\nresult but disorder and fruitless toil to the troops; so that, when the\nsuitable period should arrive, he would be compelled to return to Verona\nwith his army, to recover from the injuries sustained in the winter, and\nprovide necessaries for the summer; and thus the time available for the\nwar would be wasted in marching and countermarching. Orsatto Justiniani\nand Giovanni Pisani were deputed on the part of Venice to the count at\nVerona, having been sent to consider these affairs, and with them it was\nagreed that the Venetians should pay the count ninety thousand ducats\nfor the coming year, and to each of the soldiers forty ducats; that he\nshould set out immediately with the whole army and attack the duke, in\norder to compel him, for his own preservation, to recall Niccolo into\nLombardy. After this agreement the ambassadors returned to Venice; and\nthe Venetians, having so large an amount of money to raise, were very\nremiss with their commissariat.\nIn the meantime, Niccolo Piccinino pursued his route, and arrived in\nRomagna, where he prevailed upon the sons of Pandolfo Malatesti to\ndesert the Venetians and enter the duke's service. This circumstance\noccasioned much uneasiness in Venice, and still more at Florence;\nfor they thought that with the aid of the Malatesti they might resist\nNiccolo; but finding them gone over to the enemy, they were in fear lest\ntheir captain, Piero Giampagolo Orsini, who was in the territories of\nthe Malatesti, should be disarmed and rendered powerless. The count also\nfelt alarmed, for, through Niccolo's presence in Tuscany, he was\nafraid of losing La Marca; and, urged by a desire to look after his\nown affairs, he hastened to Venice, and being introduced to the Doge,\ninformed him that the interests of the League required his presence in\nTuscany; for the war ought to be carried on where the leader and forces\nof the enemy were, and not where his garrisons and towns were situated;\nfor when the army is vanquished the war is finished; but to take towns\nand leave the armament entire, usually allowed the war to break out\nagain with greater virulence; that Tuscany and La Marca would be lost if\nNiccolo were not vigorously resisted, and that, if lost, there would be\nno possibility of the preservation of Lombardy. But supposing the\ndanger to Lombardy not so imminent, he did not intend to abandon his own\nsubjects and friends, and that having come into Lombardy as a prince, he\ndid not intend to return a mere condottiere. To this the Doge replied,\nit was quite manifest that, if he left Lombardy, or even recrossed the\nPo, all their inland territories would be lost; in that case they were\nunwilling to spend any more money in their defense. For it would be\nfolly to attempt defending a place which must, after all, inevitably\nbe lost; and that it is less disgraceful and less injurious to lose\ndominions only, then to lose both territory and money. That if the loss\nof their inland possessions should actually result, it would then be\nseen how highly important to the preservation of Romagna and Tuscany\nthe reputation of the Venetians had been. On these accounts they were of\nquite a different opinion from the count; for they saw that whoever was\nvictor in Lombardy would be so everywhere else, that conquest would be\neasily attainable now, when the territories of the duke were left almost\ndefenseless by the departure of Niccolo, and that he would be ruined\nbefore he could order Niccolo's recall, or provide himself with any\nother remedy; that whoever attentively considered these things would\nsee, that the duke had sent Niccolo into Tuscany for no other reason\nthan to withdraw the count from his enterprise, and cause the war, which\nwas now at his own door, to be removed to a greater distance. That if\nthe count were to follow Niccolo, unless at the instigation of some very\npressing necessity, he would find his plan successful, and rejoice in\nthe adoption of it; but if he were to remain in Lombardy, and allow\nTuscany to shift for herself, the duke would, when too late, see the\nimprudence of his conduct, and find that he had lost his territories in\nLombardy and gained nothing in Tuscany. Each party having spoken, it\nwas determined to wait a few days to see what would result from the\nagreement of the Malatesti with Niccolo; whether the Florentines could\navail themselves of Piero Giampagolo, and whether the pope intended to\njoin the League with all the earnestness he had promised. Not many\ndays after these resolutions were adopted, it was ascertained that the\nMalatesti had made the agreement more from fear than any ill-will toward\nthe League; that Piero Giampagolo had proceeded with his force toward\nTuscany, and that the pope was more disposed than ever to assist\nthem. This favorable intelligence dissipated the count's fears, and he\nconsented to remain in Lombardy, and that Neri Capponi should return\nto Florence with a thousand of his own horse, and five hundred from the\nother parties. It was further agreed, that if the affairs of Tuscany\nshould require the count's presence, Neri should write to him, and he\nwould proceed thither to the exclusion of every other consideration.\nNeri arrived at Florence with his forces in April, and Giampagolo joined\nthem the same day.\nIn the meantime, Niccolo Piccinino, the affairs of Romagna being\nsettled, purposed making a descent into Tuscany, and designing to go by\nthe mountain passes of San Benedetto and the valley of Montone, found\nthem so well guarded by the contrivance of Niccolo da Pisa, that his\nutmost exertions would be useless in that direction. As the Florentines,\nupon this sudden attack, were unprovided with troops and officers, they\nhad sent into the defiles of these hills many of their citizens,\nwith infantry raised upon the emergency to guard them, among whom was\nBartolomeo Orlandini, a cavaliere, to whom was intrusted the defense\nof the castle of Marradi and the adjacent passes. Niccolo Piccinino,\nfinding the route by San Benedetto impracticable, on account of the\nbravery of its commander, thought the cowardice of the officer who\ndefended that of Marradi would render the passage easy. Marradi is a\ncastle situated at the foot of the mountains which separate Tuscany from\nRomagna; and, though destitute of walls, the river, the mountains, and\nthe inhabitants, make it a place of great strength; for the peasantry\nare warlike and faithful, and the rapid current undermining the banks\nhas left them of such tremendous height that it is impossible to\napproach it from the valley if a small bridge over the stream be\ndefended; while on the mountain side the precipices are so steep and\nperpendicular as to render it almost impregnable. In spite of these\nadvantages, the pusillanimity of Bartolomeo Orlandini rendered the men\ncowardly and the fortress untenable; for as soon as he heard of the\nenemy's approach he abandoned the place, fled with all his forces, and\ndid not stop till he reached the town of San Lorenzo. Niccolo, entering\nthe deserted fortress, wondered it had not been defended, and, rejoicing\nover his acquisition, descended into the valley of the Mugello, where\nhe took some castles, and halted with his army at Pulicciano. Thence he\noverran the country as far as the mountains of Fiesole; and his audacity\nso increased that he crossed the Arno, plundering and destroying\neverything to within three miles of Florence.\nThe Florentines, however, were not dismayed. Their first concern was\nto give security to the government, for which they had no cause for\napprehension, so universal was the good will of the people toward Cosmo;\nand besides this, they had restricted the principal offices to a few\ncitizens of the highest class, who with their vigilance would have kept\nthe populace in order, even if they had been discontented or desirous of\nchange. They also knew by the compact made in Lombardy what forces\nNeri would bring with him, and expected the troops of the pope. These\nprospects sustained their courage till the arrival of Neri di Gino, who,\non account of the disorders and fears of the city, determined to set out\nimmediately and check Niccolo. With the cavalry he possessed, and a body\nof infantry raised entirely from the people, he recovered Remole from\nthe hands of the enemy, where having encamped, he put a stop to all\nfurther depredations, and gave the inhabitants hopes of repelling\nthe enemy from the neighborhood. Niccolo finding that, although the\nFlorentines were without troops, no disturbance had arisen, and learning\nwhat entire composure prevailed in the city, thought he was wasting\ntime, and resolved to undertake some other enterprise to induce them to\nsend forces after him, and give him a chance of coming to an engagement,\nby means of which, if victorious, he trusted everything would succeed to\nhis wishes.\nFrancesco, Count di Poppi, was in the army of Niccolo, having deserted\nthe Florentines, with whom he was in league, when the enemy entered the\nMugello; and though with the intention of securing him as soon as they\nhad an idea of his design, they increased his appointments, and made him\ncommissary over all the places in his vicinity; still, so powerful is\nthe attachment to party, that no benefit or fear could eradicate the\naffection he bore toward Rinaldo and the late government; so that as\nsoon as he knew Niccolo was at hand he joined him, and with the utmost\nsolicitude entreated him to leave the city and pass into the Casentino,\npointing out to him the strength of the country, and how easily he might\nthence harass his enemies. Niccolo followed his advice, and arriving\nin the Casentino, took Romena and Bibbiena, and then pitched his camp\nbefore Castel San Niccolo. This fortress is situated at the foot of the\nmountains which divide the Casentino from the Val d'Arno; and being in\nan elevated situation, and well garrisoned, it was difficult to take,\nthough Niccolo, with catapults and other engines, assailed it without\nintermission. The siege had continued more than twenty days, during\nwhich the Florentines had collected all their forces, having assembled\nunder several leaders, three thousand horse, at Fegghine, commanded by\nPiero Giampagolo Orsini, their captain, and Neri Capponi and Bernardo\nde' Medici, commissaries. Four messengers, from Castel San Niccolo, were\nsent to them to entreat succor. The commissaries having examined the\nsite, found it could not be relieved, except from the Alpine regions,\nin the direction of the Val d'Arno, the summit of which was more easily\nattainable by the enemy than by themselves, on account of their greater\nproximity, and because the Florentines could not approach without\nobservation; so that it would be making a desperate attempt, and might\noccasion the destruction of the forces. The commissaries, therefore,\ncommended their fidelity, and ordered that when they could hold out no\nlonger, they should surrender. Niccolo took the fortress after a siege\nof thirty-two days; and the loss of so much time, for the attainment\nof so small an advantage, was the principle cause of the failure of his\nexpedition; for had he remained with his forces near Florence, he would\nhave almost deprived the government of all power to compel the citizens\nto furnish money: nor would they so easily have assembled forces and\ntaken other precautions, if the enemy had been close upon them, as\nthey did while he was at a distance. Besides this, many would have been\ndisposed to quiet their apprehensions of Niccolo, by concluding a peace;\nparticularly, as the contest was likely to be of some duration. The\ndesire of the Count di Poppi to avenge himself on the inhabitants of\nSan Niccolo, long his enemies, occasioned his advice to Piccinino, who\nadopted it for the purpose of pleasing him; and this caused the ruin\nof both. It seldom happens, that the gratification of private feelings,\nfails to be injurious to the general convenience.\nNiccolo, pursuing his good fortune, took Rassina and Chiusi. The Count\ndi Poppi advised him to halt in these parts, arguing that he might\ndivide his people between Chiusi, Caprese, and the Pieve, render himself\nmaster of this branch of the Apennines, and descend at pleasure into the\nCasentino, the Val d'Arno, the Val di Chiane, or the Val di Tavere,\nas well as be prepared for every movement of the enemy. But Niccolo,\nconsidering the sterility of these places, told him, \"his horses could\nnot eat stones,\" and went to the Borgo San Sepolcro, where he was\namicably received, but found that the people of Citta di Castello, who\nwere friendly to the Florentines, could not be induced to yield to his\novertures. Wishing to have Perugia at his disposal, he proceeded\nthither with forty horse, and being one of her citizens, met with a kind\nreception. But in a few days he became suspected, and having attempted\nunsuccessfully to tamper with the legate and people of Perugia, he took\neight thousand ducats from them, and returned to his army. He then set\non foot secret measures, to seduce Cortona from the Florentines, but\nthe affair being discovered, his attempts were fruitless. Among the\nprincipal citizens was Bartolomeo di Senso, who being appointed to the\nevening watch of one of the gates, a countryman, his friend, told him,\nthat if he went he would be slain. Bartolomeo, requesting to know what\nwas meant, he became acquainted with the whole affair, and revealed it\nto the governor of the place, who, having secured the leaders of the\nconspiracy, and doubled the guards at the gates, waited till the time\nappointed for the coming of Niccolo, who finding his purpose discovered,\nreturned to his encampment.\nCHAPTER VII\nBrescia relieved by Sforza--His other victories--Piccinino is\nrecalled into Lombardy--He endeavors to bring the Florentines to an\nengagement--He is routed before Anghiari--Serious disorders in the\ncamp of the Florentines after the victory--Death of Rinaldo degli\nAlbizzi--His character--Neri Capponi goes to recover the Casentino--The\nCount di Poppi surrenders--His discourse upon quitting his possessions.\nWhile these events were taking place in Tuscany, so little to the\nadvantage of the duke, his affairs in Lombardy were in a still worse\ncondition. The Count Francesco, as soon as the season would permit, took\nthe field with his army, and the Venetians having again covered the lake\nwith their galleys, he determined first of all to drive the duke from\nthe water; judging, that this once effected, his remaining task would be\neasy. He therefore, with the Venetian fleet, attacked that of the duke,\nand destroyed it. His land forces took the castles held for Filippo,\nand the ducal troops who were besieging Brescia, being informed of\nthese transactions, withdrew; and thus, the city, after standing a three\nyears' siege, was at length relieved. The count then went in quest\nof the enemy, whose forces were encamped before Soncino, a fortress\nsituated upon the River Oglio; these he dislodged and compelled to\nretreat to Cremona, where the duke again collected his forces, and\nprepared for his defense. But the count constantly pressing him more\nclosely, he became apprehensive of losing either the whole, or the\ngreater part, of his territories; and perceiving the unfortunate step\nhe had taken, in sending Niccolo into Tuscany, in order to correct his\nerror, he wrote to acquaint him with what had transpired, desiring him,\nwith all possible dispatch, to leave Tuscany and return to Lombardy.\nIn the meantime, the Florentines, under their commissaries, had drawn\ntogether their forces, and being joined by those of the pope, halted at\nAnghiari, a castle placed at the foot of the mountains that divide the\nVal di Tavere from the Val di Chiane, distant four miles from the\nBorgo San Sepolcro, on a level road, and in a country suitable for the\nevolutions of cavalry or a battlefield. As the Signory had heard of the\ncount's victory and the recall of Niccolo, they imagined that without\nagain drawing a sword or disturbing the dust under their horses' feet,\nthe victory was their own, and the war at an end, they wrote to the\ncommissaries, desiring them to avoid an engagement, as Niccolo could\nnot remain much longer in Tuscany. These instructions coming to the\nknowledge of Piccinino, and perceiving the necessity of his speedy\nreturn, to leave nothing unattempted, he determined to engage the enemy,\nexpecting to find them unprepared, and not disposed for battle. In this\ndetermination he was confirmed by Rinaldo, the Count di Poppi, and other\nFlorentine exiles, who saw their inevitable ruin in the departure of\nNiccolo, and hoped, that if he engaged the enemy, they would either\nbe victorious, or vanquished without dishonor. This resolution being\nadopted, Niccolo led his army, unperceived by the enemy, from Citta di\nCastello to the Borgo, where he enlisted two thousand men, who, trusting\nthe general's talents and promises, followed him in hope of plunder.\nNiccolo then led his forces in battle array toward Anghiari, and\nhad arrived within two miles of the place, when Micheletto Attendulo\nobserved great clouds of dust, and conjecturing at once, that it must\nbe occasioned by the enemy's approach, immediately called the troops to\narms. Great confusion prevailed in the Florentine camp, for the ordinary\nnegligence and want of discipline were now increased by their presuming\nthe enemy to be at a distance, and they were more disposed to fight than\nto battle; so that everyone was unarmed, and some wandering from the\ncamp, either led by their desire to avoid the excessive heat, or in\npursuit of amusement. So great was the diligence of the commissaries and\nof the captain, that before the enemy's arrival, the men were mounted\nand prepared to resist their attack; and as Micheletto was the first to\nobserve their approach, he was also first armed and ready to meet them,\nand with his troops hastened to the bridge which crosses the river at a\nshort distance from Anghiari. Pietro Giampagolo having previous to the\nsurprise, filled up the ditches on either side of the road, and leveled\nthe ground between the bridge and Anghiari, and Micheletto having taken\nhis position in front of the former, the legate and Simoncino, who led\nthe troops of the church, took post on the right, and the commissaries\nof the Florentines, with Pietro Giampagolo, their captain, on the left;\nthe infantry being drawn up along the banks of the river. Thus, the only\ncourse the enemy could take, was the direct one over the bridge; nor\nhad the Florentines any other field for their exertions, excepting that\ntheir infantry were ordered, in case their cavalry were attacked in\nflank by the hostile infantry, to assail them with their cross bows, and\nprevent them from wounding the flanks of the horses crossing the bridge.\nMicheletto bravely withstood the enemy's charge upon the bridge; but\nAstorre and Francesco Piccinino coming up, with a picked body of men,\nattacked him so vigorously, that he was compelled to give way, and\nwas pushed as far as the foot of the hill which rises toward the Borgo\nd'Anghiari; but they were in turn repulsed and driven over the bridge,\nby the troops that took them in flank. The battle continued two hours,\nduring which each side had frequent possession of the bridge, and their\nattempts upon it were attended with equal success; but on both sides of\nthe river, the disadvantage of Niccolo was manifest; for when his people\ncrossed the bridge, they found the enemy unbroken, and the ground\nbeing leveled, they could manoeuvre without difficulty, and the weary\nbe relieved by such as were fresh. But when the Florentines crossed,\nNiccolo could not relieve those that were harassed, on account of the\nhindrance interposed by the ditches and embankments on each side of the\nroad; thus whenever his troops got possession of the bridge, they were\nsoon repulsed by the fresh forces of the Florentines; but when the\nbridge was taken by the Florentines, and they passed over and proceeded\nupon the road, Niccolo having no opportunity to reinforce his troops,\nbeing prevented by the impetuosity of the enemy and the inconvenience of\nthe ground, the rear guard became mingled with the van, and occasioned\nthe utmost confusion and disorder; they were forced to flee, and\nhastened at full speed toward the Borgo. The Florentine troops fell upon\nthe plunder, which was very valuable in horses, prisoners, and military\nstores, for not more than a thousand of the enemy's cavalry reached the\ntown. The people of the Borgo, who had followed Niccolo in the hope of\nplunder, became booty themselves, all of them being taken, and obliged\nto pay a ransom. The colors and carriages were also captured. This\nvictory was much more advantageous to the Florentines than injurious to\nthe duke; for, had they been conquered, Tuscany would have been his own;\nbut he, by his defeat, only lost the horses and accoutrements of his\narmy, which could be replaced without any very serious expense. Nor was\nthere ever an instance of wars being carried on in an enemy's country\nwith less injury to the assailants than at this; for in so great a\ndefeat, and in a battle which continued four hours, only one man died,\nand he, not from wounds inflicted by hostile weapons, or any honorable\nmeans, but, having fallen from his horse, was trampled to death.\nCombatants then engaged with little danger; being nearly all mounted,\ncovered with armor, and preserved from death whenever they chose\nto surrender, there was no necessity for risking their lives; while\nfighting, their armor defended them, and when they could resist no\nlonger, they yielded and were safe.\nThis battle, from the circumstances which attended and followed it,\npresents a striking example of the wretched state of military discipline\nin those times. The enemy's forces being defeated and driven into the\nBorgo, the commissaries desired to pursue them, in order to make the\nvictory complete, but not a single condottiere or soldier would obey,\nalleging, as a sufficient reason for their refusal, that they must take\ncare of the booty and attend to their wounded; and, what is still more\nsurprising, the next day, without permission from the commissaries, or\nthe least regard for their commanders, they went to Arezzo, and, having\nsecured their plunder, returned to Anghiari; a thing so contrary to\nmilitary order and all subordination, that the merest shadow of a\nregular army would easily and most justly have wrested from them\nthe victory they had so undeservedly obtained. Added to this, the\nmen-at-arms, or heavy-armed horse, who had been taken prisoners, whom\nthe commissaries wished to be detained that they might not rejoin the\nenemy, were set at liberty, contrary to their orders. It is astonishing,\nthat an army so constructed should have sufficient energy to obtain\nthe victory, or that any should be found so imbecile as to allow such a\ndisorderly rabble to vanquish them. The time occupied by the Florentine\nforces in going and returning from Arezzo, gave Niccolo opportunity of\nescaping from the Borgo, and proceeding toward Romagna. Along with him\nalso fled the Florentine exiles, who, finding no hope of their return\nhome, took up their abodes in various parts of Italy, each according\nto his own convenience. Rinaldo made choice of Ancona; and, to gain\nadmission to the celestial country, having lost the terrestrial, he\nperformed a pilgrimage to the holy sepulcher; whence having returned, he\ndied suddenly while at table at the celebration of the marriage of one\nof his daughters; an instance of fortune's favor, in removing him from\nthe troubles of this world upon the least sorrowful day of his exile.\nRinaldo d'Albizzi appeared respectable under every change of condition;\nand would have been more so had he lived in a united city, for many\nqualities were injurious to him in a factious community, which in an\nharmonious one would have done him honor.\nWhen the forces returned from Arezzo, Niccolo being then gone, the\ncommissaries presented themselves at the Borgo, the people of which were\nwilling to submit to the Florentines; but their offer was declined,\nand while negotiations were pending, the pope's legate imagined the\ncommissaries designed to take it from the church. Hard words were\nexchanged and hostilities might have ensued between the Florentine\nand ecclesiastical forces, if the misunderstanding had continued much\nlonger; but as it was brought to the conclusion desired by the legate,\npeace was restored.\nWhile the affair of the Borgo San Sepolcro was in progress, Niccolo\nPiccinino was supposed to have marched toward Rome; other accounts\nsaid La Marca, and hence the legate and the count's forces moved toward\nPerugia to relieve La Marca or Rome, as the case might be, and Bernardo\nde Medici accompanied them. Neri led the Florentine forces to recover\nthe Casentino, and pitched his camp before Rassina, which he took,\ntogether with Bibbiena, Prato Vecchio, and Romena. From thence he\nproceeded to Poppi and invested it on two sides with his forces, in one\ndirection toward the plain of Certomondo, in the other upon the hill\nextending to Fronzole. The count finding himself abandoned to his fate,\nhad shut himself up in Poppi, not with any hope of assistance, but with\na view to make the best terms he could. Neri pressing him, he offered\nto capitulate, and obtained reasonable conditions, namely, security for\nhimself and family, with leave to take whatever he could carry away, on\ncondition of ceding his territories and government to the Florentines.\nWhen he perceived the full extent of his misfortune, standing upon the\nbridge which crosses the Arno, close to Poppi, he turned to Neri in\ngreat distress, and said, \"Had I well considered my own position and\nthe power of the Florentines, I should now have been a friend of the\nrepublic and congratulating you on your victory, not an enemy compelled\nto supplicate some alleviation of my woe. The recent events which to you\nbring glory and joy, to me are full of wretchedness and sorrow. Once\nI possessed horses, arms, subjects, grandeur and wealth: can it be\nsurprising that I part with them reluctantly? But as you possess both\nthe power and the inclination to command the whole of Tuscany, we must\nof necessity obey you; and had I not committed this error, my misfortune\nwould not have occurred, and your liberality could not have been\nexercised; so, that if you were to rescue me from entire ruin, you would\ngive the world a lasting proof of your clemency. Therefore, let your\npity pass by my fault, and allow me to retain this single house to\nleave to the descendants of those from whom your fathers have received\ninnumerable benefits.\" To this Neri replied: \"That his having expected\ngreat results from men who were capable of doing only very little, had\nled him to commit so great a fault against the republic of Florence;\nthat, every circumstance considered, he must surrender all those places\nto the Florentines, as an enemy, which he was unwilling to hold as a\nfriend: that he had set such an example, as it would be most highly\nimpolitic to encourage; for, upon a change of fortune, it might injure\nthe republic, and it was not himself they feared, but his power while\nlord of the Casentino. If, however, he could live as a prince in\nGermany, the citizens would be very much gratified; and out of love\nto those ancestors of whom he had spoken, they would be glad to assist\nhim.\" To this, the count, in great anger, replied: \"He wished the\nFlorentines at a much greater distance.\" Attempting no longer to\npreserve the least urbanity of demeanor, he ceded the place and all\nits dependencies to the Florentines, and with his treasure, wife, and\nchildren, took his departure, mourning the loss of a territory which his\nforefathers had held during four hundred years. When all these victories\nwere known at Florence, the government and people were transported\nwith joy. Benedetto de' Medici, finding the report of Niccolo having\nproceeded either to Rome or to La Marca, incorrect, returned with his\nforces to Neri, and they proceeded together to Florence, where the\nhighest honors were decreed to them which it was customary with the city\nto bestow upon her victorious citizens, and they were received by the\nSignory, the Capitani di Parte, and the whole city, in triumphal pomp.\nBOOK VI\nCHAPTER I\nReflections on the object of war and the use of victory--Niccolo\nreinforces his army--The duke of Milan endeavors to recover the services\nof Count Francesco Sforza--Suspicions of the Venetians--They acquire\nRavenna--The Florentines purchase the Borgo San Sepolcro of the\npope--Piccinino makes an excursion during the winter--The count besieged\nin his camp before Martinengo--The insolence of Niccolo Piccinino--The\nduke in revenge makes peace with the league--Sforza assisted by the\nFlorentines.\nThose who make war have always and very naturally designed to enrich\nthemselves and impoverish the enemy; neither is victory sought or\nconquest desirable, except to strengthen themselves and weaken the\nenemy. Hence it follows, that those who are impoverished by victory or\ndebilitated by conquest, must either have gone beyond, or fallen short\nof, the end for which wars are made. A republic or a prince is enriched\nby the victories he obtains, when the enemy is crushed and possession\nis retained of the plunder and ransom. Victory is injurious when the foe\nescapes, or when the soldiers appropriate the booty and ransom. In such\na case, losses are unfortunate, and conquests still more so; for the\nvanquished suffers the injuries inflicted by the enemy, and the victor\nthose occasioned by his friends, which being less justifiable, must\ncause the greater pain, particularly from a consideration of his being\nthus compelled to oppress his people by an increased burden of taxation.\nA ruler possessing any degree of humanity, cannot rejoice in a victory\nthat afflicts his subjects. The victories of the ancient and well\norganized republics, enabled them to fill their treasuries with gold and\nsilver won from their enemies, to distribute gratuities to the people,\nreduce taxation, and by games and solemn festivals, disseminate\nuniversal joy. But the victories obtained in the times of which we\nspeak, first emptied the treasury, and then impoverished the people,\nwithout giving the victorious party security from the enemy. This arose\nentirely from the disorders inherent in their mode of warfare; for the\nvanquished soldiery, divesting themselves of their accoutrements, and\nbeing neither slain nor detained prisoners, only deferred a renewed\nattack on the conqueror, till their leader had furnished them with arms\nand horses. Besides this, both ransom and booty being appropriated\nby the troops, the victorious princes could not make use of them for\nraising fresh forces, but were compelled to draw the necessary means\nfrom their subjects' purses, and this was the only result of victory\nexperienced by the people, except that it diminished the ruler's\nreluctance to such a course, and made him less particular about his mode\nof oppressing them. To such a state had the practice of war been\nbrought by the sort of soldiery then on foot, that the victor and the\nvanquished, when desirous of their services, alike needed fresh supplies\nof money; for the one had to re-equip them, and the other to bribe\nthem; the vanquished could not fight without being remounted, and the\nconquerors would not take the field without a new gratuity. Hence it\nfollowed, that the one derived little advantage from the victory, and\nthe other was the less injured by defeat; for the routed party had to be\nre-equipped, and the victorious could not pursue his advantage.\nFrom this disorderly and perverse method of procedure, it arose, that\nbefore Niccolo's defeat became known throughout Italy, he had again\nreorganized his forces, and harassed the enemy with greater vigor than\nbefore. Hence, also, it happened, that after his disaster at Tenna, he\nso soon occupied Verona: that being deprived of his army at Verona, he\nwas shortly able to appear with a large force in Tuscany; that being\ncompletely defeated at Anghiari, before he reached Tuscany, he was more\npowerful in the field than ever. He was thus enabled to give the duke of\nMilan hopes of defending Lombardy, which by his absence appeared to\nbe lost; for while Niccolo spread consternation throughout Tuscany,\ndisasters in the former province so alarmed the duke, that he was afraid\nhis utter ruin would ensue before Niccolo, whom he had recalled, could\ncome to his relief, and check the impetuous progress of the count. Under\nthese impressions, the duke, to insure by policy that success which he\ncould not command by arms, had recourse to remedies, which on similar\noccasions had frequently served his turn. He sent Niccolo da Esti,\nprince of Ferrara, to the count who was then at Peschiera, to persuade\nhim, \"That this war was not to his advantage; for if the duke became\nso ruined as to be unable to maintain his position among the states of\nItaly, the count would be the first to suffer; for he would cease to be\nof importance either with the Venetians or the Florentines; and to\nprove the sincerity of his wish for peace, he offered to fulfill the\nengagement he had entered into with regard to his daughter, and send her\nto Ferrara; so that as soon as peace was established, the union might\ntake place.\" The count replied, \"That if the duke really wished\nfor peace, he might easily be gratified, as the Florentines and the\nVenetians were equally anxious for it. True, it was, he could with\ndifficulty credit him, knowing that he had never made peace but from\nnecessity, and when this no longer pressed him, again desired war.\nNeither could he give credence to what he had said concerning the\nmarriage, having been so repeatedly deceived; yet when peace was\nconcluded, he would take the advice of his friends upon that subject.\"\nThe Venetians, who were sometimes needlessly jealous of their soldiery,\nbecame greatly alarmed at these proceedings; and not without reason.\nThe count was aware of this, and wishing to remove their apprehensions,\npursued the war with unusual vigor; but his mind had become so unsettled\nby ambition, and the Venetians' by jealousy, that little further\nprogress was made during the remainder of the summer, and upon the\nreturn of Niccolo into Lombardy, winter having already commenced, the\narmies withdrew into quarters, the count to Verona, the Florentine\nforces to Tuscany, the duke's to Cremona, and those of the pope to\nRomagna. The latter, after having been victorious at Anghiari, made an\nunsuccessful attack upon Furli and Bologna, with a view to wrest them\nfrom Niccolo Piccinino; but they were gallantly defended by his son\nFrancesco. However, the arrival of the papal forces so alarmed the\npeople of Ravenna with the fear of becoming subject to the church, that,\nby consent of Ostasio di Polenta their lord, they placed themselves\nunder the power of the Venetians; who, in return for the territory, and\nthat Ostasio might never retake by force what he had imprudently given\nthem, sent him and his son to Candia, where they died. In the course of\nthese affairs, the pope, notwithstanding the victory at Anghiari, became\nso in want of money, that he sold the fortress of Borgo San Sepolcro to\nthe Florentines for 25,000 ducats.\nAffairs being thus situated, each party supposed winter would protect\nthem from the evils of war, and thought no more of peace. This was\nparticularly the case with the duke, who, being rendered doubly secure\nby the season and by the presence of Niccolo, broke off all attempts to\neffect a reconciliation with the count, reorganized Niccolo's forces,\nand made every requisite preparation for the future struggle. The count\nbeing informed of this, went to Venice to consult with the senate on the\ncourse to be pursued during the next year. Niccolo, on the other hand,\nbeing quite prepared, and seeing the enemy unprovided, did not await the\nreturn of spring, but crossed the Adda during severe weather, occupied\nthe whole Brescian territory, except Oddula and Acri, and made\nprisoners two thousand horse belonging to Francesco's forces, who had\nno apprehension of an attack. But the greatest source of anxiety to the\ncount, and alarm to the Venetians, was the desertion of his service by\nCiarpellone, one of his principal officers. Francesco, on learning these\nmatters, immediately left Venice, and, arriving at Brescia, found that\nNiccolo, after doing all the mischief he could, had retired to his\nquarters; and therefore, finding the war concluded for the present was\nnot disposed to rekindle it, but rather to use the opportunity afforded\nby the season and his enemies, of reorganizing his forces, so as to be\nable, when spring arrived, to avenge himself for his former injuries.\nTo this end he induced the Venetians to recall the forces they had\nin Tuscany, in the Florentine service, and to order that to succeed\nGattamelata, who was dead, Micheletto Attendulo should take the command.\nOn the approach of spring, Niccolo Piccinino was the first to take\nthe field, and encamped before Cignano, a fortress twelve miles from\nBrescia; the count marched to its relief, and the war between them was\nconducted in the usual manner. The count, apprehensive for the city of\nBergamo, besieged Martinengo, a castle so situated that the possession\nof it would enable him to relieve the former, which was closely pressed\nby Niccolo, who, having foreseen that the enemy could impede him only\nfrom the direction of Martinengo, had put the castle into a complete\nstate of defense, so that the count was obliged to lend his whole\nforce to the siege. Upon this, Niccolo placed his troops in a situation\ncalculated to intercept the count's provisions, and fortified himself\nwith trenches and bastions in such a manner that he could not be\nattacked without the most manifest hazard to his assailant. Hence the\nbesiegers were more distressed than the people of Martinengo whom they\nbesieged. The count could not hold his position for want of food, nor\nquit it without imminent danger; so that the duke's victory appeared\ncertain, and defeat equally inevitable to the count and the Venetians.\nBut fortune, never destitute of means to assist her favorites, or to\ninjure others, caused the hope of victory to operate so powerfully\nupon Niccolo Piccinino, and made him assume such a tone of unbounded\ninsolence, that, losing all respect for himself and the duke, he sent\nhim word that, having served under his ensign for so long, without\nobtaining sufficient land to serve him for a grave, he wished to know\nfrom himself what was to be the reward of his labors; for it was in his\npower to make him master of Lombardy, and place all his enemies in\nhis power; and, as a certain victory ought to be attended by a sure\nremuneration, he desired the duke to concede to him the city of\nPiacenza, that when weary with his lengthened services he might at\nlast betake himself to repose. Nor did he hesitate, in conclusion, to\nthreaten, if his request were not granted, to abandon the enterprise.\nThis injurious and most insolent mode of proceeding highly offended the\nduke, and, on further consideration, he determined rather to let the\nexpedition altogether fail, than consent to his general's demand. Thus,\nwhat all the dangers he had incurred, and the threats of his enemies,\ncould not draw from him, the insolent behavior of his friends made him\nwilling to propose. He resolved to come to terms with the count,\nand sent Antonio Guido Buono, of Tortona, to offer his daughter and\nconditions of peace, which were accepted with great pleasure by the\ncount, and also by the colleagues as far as themselves were concerned.\nThe terms being secretly arranged, the duke sent to command Niccolo\nto make a truce with the count for one year; intimating, that being\nexhausted with the expense, he could not forego a certain peace for a\ndoubtful victory. Niccolo was utterly astonished at this resolution,\nand could not imagine what had induced the duke to lose such a glorious\nopportunity; nor could he surmise that, to avoid rewarding his friends,\nhe would save his enemies, and therefore to the utmost of his power he\nopposed this resolution; and the duke was obliged, in order to induce\nhis compliance, to threaten that if he did not obey he would give him up\nto his soldiers and his enemies. Niccolo submitted, with the feelings\nof one compelled to leave country and friends, complaining of his hard\nfate, that fortune and the duke were robbing him of the victory over his\nenemies. The truce being arranged, the marriage of the duke's daughter,\nBianca, to the count was solemnized, the duke giving Cremona for her\nportion. This being over, peace was concluded in November, 1441,\nat which Francesco Barbadico and Pagolo Trono were present for the\nVenetians, and for the Florentines Agnolo Acciajuoli. Peschiera, Asola,\nand Lonato, castles in the Mantuan territory, were assigned to the\nVenetians.\nThe war in Lombardy was concluded; but the dissensions in the kingdom\nof Naples continued, and the inability to compose them occasioned the\nresumption of those arms which had been so recently laid aside. Alfonso,\nof Aragon, had, during these wars, taken from Ren\u00e9 the whole kingdom\nexcept Naples; so that, thinking he had the victory in his power, he\nresolved during the siege of Naples to take Benevento, and his other\npossessions in that neighborhood, from the count; and thought he might\neasily accomplish this while the latter was engaged in the wars of\nLombardy. Having heard of the conclusion of peace, Alfonso feared the\ncount would not only come for the purpose of recovering his territories,\nbut also to favor Ren\u00e9; and Ren\u00e9 himself had hope of his assistance for\nthe same reason. The latter, therefore, sent to the count, begging he\nwould come to the relief of a friend, and avenge himself of an enemy.\nOn the other hand, Alfonso entreated Filippo, for the sake of the\nfriendship which subsisted between them, to find the count some other\noccupation, that, being engaged in greater affairs, he might not have\nan opportunity of interfering between them. Filippo complied with this\nrequest, without seeming to be aware that he violated the peace recently\nmade, so greatly to his disadvantage. He therefore signified to pope\nEugenius, that the present was a favorable opportunity for recovering\nthe territories which the count had taken from the church; and, that he\nmight be in a condition to use it, offered him the services of Niccolo\nPiccinino, and engaged to pay him during the war; who, since the peace\nof Lombardy, had remained with his forces in Romagna. Eugenius eagerly\ntook the advice, induced by his hatred of the count, and his desire to\nrecover his lost possessions; feeling assured that, although on a former\noccasion he had been duped by Niccolo, it would be improper, now that\nthe duke interfered, to suspect any deceit; and, joining his forces to\nthose of Niccolo, he assailed La Marca. The count, astonished at such an\nunexpected attack, assembled his troops, and went to meet the enemy. In\nthe meantime, King Alfonso took possession of Naples, so that the whole\nkingdom, except Castelnuova, was in his power. Leaving a strong guard\nat Castelnuova Ren\u00e9 set out and came to Florence, where he was most\nhonorably received; and having remained a few days, finding he could not\ncontinue the war, he withdrew to Marseilles.\nIn the meantime, Alfonso took Castelnuova, and the count found himself\nassailed in the Marca Inferiore, both by the pope and Niccolo. He\napplied to the Venetians and the Florentines for assistance, in men and\nmoney, assuring them that if they did not determine to restrain the pope\nand king, during his life, they would soon afterward find their very\nexistence endangered, for both would join Filippo and divide Italy\namong them. The Florentines and Venetians hesitated for a time, both to\nconsider the propriety of drawing upon themselves the enmity of the pope\nand the king, and because they were then engaged in the affairs of the\nBolognese. Annibale Bentivoglio had driven Francesco Piccinino from\nBologna, and for defense against the duke, who favored Francesco, he\ndemanded and received assistance of the Venetians and Florentines; so\nthat, being occupied with these matters they could not resolve to assist\nthe count, but Annibale, having routed Francesco Piccinino, and those\naffairs seeming to be settled, they resolved to support him. Designing\nhowever to make sure of the duke, they offered to renew the league with\nhim, to which he was not averse; for, although he consented that war\nshould be made against the count, while King Ren\u00e9 was in arms, yet\nfinding him now conquered, and deprived of the whole kingdom, he was\nnot willing that the count should be despoiled of his territories; and\ntherefore, not only consented that assistance should be given him,\nbut wrote to Alfonso to be good enough to retire to his kingdom, and\ndiscontinue hostilities against the count; and although reluctantly, yet\nin acknowledgment of his obligations to the duke, Alfonso determined to\nsatisfy him, and withdrew with his forces beyond the Tronto.\nCHAPTER II\nDiscords of Florence--Jealousy excited against Neri di Gino\nCapponi--Baldaccio d'Anghiari murdered--Reform of government in favor\nof the Medici--Enterprises of Sforza and Piccinino--Death of Niccolo\nPiccinino--End of the war--Disturbances in Bologna--Annibale Bentivoglio\nslain by Battista Canneschi, and the latter by the people--Santi,\nsupposed to be the son of Ercole Bentivoglio, is called to govern\nthe city of Bologna--Discourse of Cosmo de' Medici to him--Perfidious\ndesigns of the duke of Milan against Sforza--General war in\nItaly--Losses of the duke of Milan--The duke has recourse to the count,\nwho makes peace with him--Offers of the duke and the Venetians to the\ncount--The Venetians furtively deprive the count of Cremona.\nWhile the affairs of Romagna proceeded thus, the city of Florence\nwas not tranquil. Among the citizens of highest reputation in the\ngovernment, was Neri di Gino Capponi, of whose influence Cosmo de'\nMedici had more apprehension than any other; for to the great authority\nwhich he possessed in the city was added his influence with the\nsoldiery. Having been often leader of the Florentine forces he had won\ntheir affection by his courage and talents; and the remembrance of his\nown and his father's victories (the latter having taken Pisa, and he\nhimself having overcome Niccolo Piccinino at Anghiari) caused him to\nbe beloved by many, and feared by those who were averse to having\nassociates in the government. Among the leaders of the Florentine army\nwas Baldaccio d'Anghiari, an excellent soldier, for in those times there\nwas not one in Italy who surpassed him in vigor either of body or mind;\nand possessing so much influence with the infantry, whose leader he had\nalways been, many thought they would follow him wherever he chose to\nlead them. Baldaccio was the intimate friend of Neri, who loved him for\nhis talents, of which he had been a constant witness. This excited great\nsuspicion in the other citizens, who, thinking it alike dangerous either\nto discharge or retain him in their service, determined to destroy him,\nand fortune seemed to favor their design. Bartolommeo Orlandini was\nGonfalonier of Justice; the same person who was sent to the defense of\nMarradi, when Niccolo Piccinino came into Tuscany, as we have related\nabove, and so basely abandoned the pass, which by its nature was almost\nimpregnable. So flagrant an instance of cowardice was very offensive\nto Baldaccio, who, on many occasions, both by words and letters, had\ncontributed to make the disgraceful fact known to all. The shame and\nvexation of Bartolommeo were extreme, so that of all things he wished to\navenge himself, thinking, with the death of his accuser, to efface the\nstain upon his character.\nThis feeling of Bartolommeo Orlandini was known to other citizens, so\nthat they easily persuaded him to put Baldaccio to death, and at one\navenge himself, and deliver his country from a man whom they must\neither retain at great peril, or discharge to their greater confusion.\nBartolommeo having therefore resolved to murder him, concealed in his\nown apartment at the palace several young men, all armed; and Baldaccio,\nentering the piazza, whither it was his daily custom to come, to confer\nwith the magistrates concerning his command, the Gonfalonier sent for\nhim, and he, without any suspicion, obeyed. Meeting him in the corridor,\nwhich leads to the chambers of the Signory, they took a few turns\ntogether discoursing of his office, when being close to the door of the\napartments in which the assassins were concealed, Bartolommeo gave them\nthe signal, upon which they rushed out, and finding Baldaccio alone and\nunarmed, they slew him, and threw the body out of the window which looks\nfrom the palace toward the dogano, or customhouse. It was thence carried\ninto the piazza, where the head being severed, it remained the whole day\nexposed to the gaze of the people. Baldaccio was married, and had only\none child, a boy, who survived him but a short time; and his wife,\nAnnalena, thus deprived of both husband and offspring, rejected every\nproposal for a second union. She converted her house into a monastery,\nto which she withdrew, and, being joined by many noble ladies, lived\nin holy seclusion to the end of her days. The convent she founded, and\nwhich is named from her, preserves her story in perpetual remembrance.\nThis circumstance served to weaken Neri's power, and made him lose both\ninfluence and friends. Nor did this satisfy the citizens who held the\nreins of government; for it being ten years since their acquisition of\npower, and the authority of the Balia expired, many began to exhibit\nmore boldness, both in words and deeds, than seemed consistent with\ntheir safety; and the leaders of the party judged, that if they wished\nto preserve their influence, some means must be adopted to increase it.\nTo this end, in 1444 the councils created a new Balia, which reformed\nthe government, gave authority to a limited number to create the\nSignory, re-established the Chancery of Reformations, depriving Filippo\nPeruzzi of his office of president in it, and appointing another wholly\nunder their influence. They prolonged the term of exile to those who\nwere banished; put Giovanni di Simone Vespucci in prison; deprived the\nAccoppiatori of their enemies of the honors of government, and with\nthem the sons of Piero Baroncelli, the whole of the Seragli, Bartolommeo\nFortini, Francesco Castellani, and many others. By these means they\nstrengthened their authority and influence, and humbled their enemies,\nor those whom they suspected of being so.\nHaving thus recovered and confirmed their government, they then\nturned their attention to external affairs. As observed above, Niccolo\nPiccinino was abandoned by King Alfonso, and the count having been\naggrandized by the assistance of the Florentines, attacked and routed\nhim near Fermo, where, after losing nearly the whole of his troops,\nNiccolo fled to Montecchio, which he fortified in such a manner that in\na short time he had again assembled so large an army as enabled him to\nmake head against the count; particularly as the season was now come for\nthem to withdraw into quarters. His principal endeavor during the winter\nwas to collect troops, and in this he was assisted both by the pope and\nAlfonso; so that, upon the approach of spring, both leaders took the\nfield, and Niccolo, being the strongest, reduced the count to extreme\nnecessity, and would have conquered him if the duke had not contrived to\nfrustrate his designs. Filippo sent to beg he would come to him with\nall speed, for he wished to have a personal interview, that he might\ncommunicate matters of the highest importance. Niccolo, anxious to hear\nthem, abandoned a certain victory for a very doubtful advantage; and\nleaving his son Francesco to command the army, hastened to Milan.\nThe count being informed of the circumstance, would not let slip the\nopportunity of fighting in the absence of Niccolo; and, coming to an\nengagement near the castle of Monte Loro, routed the father's forces and\ntook the son prisoner. Niccolo having arrived at Milan saw that the duke\nhad duped him, and learning the defeat of his army and the capture of\nhis son, he died of grief in 1445, at the age of sixty-four, having been\na brave rather than a fortunate leader. He left two sons, Francesco and\nJacopo, who, possessing less talent than their father, were still more\nunfortunate; so that the arms of the family became almost annihilated,\nwhile those of Sforza, being favored by fortune, attained augmented\nglory. The pope, seeing Niccolo's army defeated and himself dead, having\nlittle hope of assistance from Aragon, sought peace with the count, and,\nby the intervention of the Florentines, succeeded. Of La Marca, the pope\nonly retained Osimo, Fabriano, and Recanati; all the rest remained in\nthe count's possession.\nPeace being restored to La Marca, the whole of Italy would have obtained\nrepose had it not been disturbed by the Bolognese. There were in Bologna\ntwo very powerful families, the Canneschi and the Bentivogli. Of the\nlatter, Annibale was the head; of the former, Battista, who, as a means\nof confirming their mutual confidence, had contracted family alliances;\nbut among men who have the same objects of ambition in view, it is\neasy to form connections, but difficult to establish friendship. The\nBolognese were in a league with the Venetians and Florentines, which had\nbeen effected by the influence of Annibale, after they had driven\nout Francesco Piccinino; and Battista, knowing how earnestly the duke\ndesired to have the city favorable to him, proposed to assassinate\nAnnibale, and put Bologna into his power. This being agreed upon, on the\ntwenty-fifth of June, 1445, he attacked Annibale with his men, and slew\nhim: and then, with shouts of \"the duke, the duke,\" rode through the\ncity. The Venetian and Florentine commissaries were in Bologna at the\ntime, and at first kept themselves within doors; but finding that the\npeople, instead of favoring the murderers, assembled in the piazza,\narmed in great numbers, mourning the death of Annibale, they joined\nthem; and, assembling what forces they could, attacked the Canneschi,\nsoon overpowered them, slew part, and drove the remainder out of the\ncity. Battista, unable to effect his escape, or his enemies his capture,\ntook refuge in a vault of his house, used for storing grain. The friends\nof the Bentivogli, having sought him all day, and knowing he had not\nleft the city, so terrified his servants, that one of them, a groom,\ndisclosed the place of his concealment, and being drawn forth in\ncomplete armor he was slain, his body dragged about the streets, and\nafterward burned. Thus the duke's authority was sufficient to prompt the\nenterprise, but his force was not at hand to support it.\nThe tumults being settled by the death of Battista, and the flight of\nthe Canneschi, Bologna still remained in the greatest confusion. There\nnot being one of the house of Bentivogli of age to govern, Annibale\nhaving left but one son whose name was Giovanni, only six years old,\nit was apprehended that disunion would ensue among the Bentivogli,\nand cause the return of the Cannecshi, and the ruin both of their own\ncountry and party. While in this state of apprehension, Francesco,\nsometime Count di Poppi, being at Bologna, informed the rulers of\nthe city, that if they wished to be governed by one of the blood of\nAnnibale, he could tell them of one; and related that about twenty years\nago, Ercole, cousin of Annibale, being at Poppi, became acquainted with\na girl of the castle, of whom was born a son named Santi, whom Ercole,\non many occasions acknowledged to be his own, nor could he deny it,\nfor whoever knew him and saw the boy, could not fail to observe the\nstrongest resemblance. The citizens gave credit to the tale, and\nimmediately sent to Florence to see the young man, and procure of Cosmo\nand Neri permission to return with him to Bologna. The reputed father\nof Santi was dead, and he lived under the protection of his uncle, whose\nname was Antonio da Cascese. Antonio was rich, childless, and a friend\nof Neri, to whom the matter becoming known, he thought it ought neither\nto be despised nor too hastily accepted; and that it would be best\nfor Santi and those who had been sent from Bologna, to confer in the\npresence of Cosmo. They were accordingly introduced, and Santi was not\nmerely honored but adored by them, so greatly were they influenced by\nthe spirit of party. However, nothing was done at the time, except that\nCosmo, taking Santi apart, spoke to him thus: \"No one can better advise\nyou in this matter than yourself; for you have to take that course\nto which your own mind prompts you. If you be the son of Ercole\nBentivoglio, you will naturally aspire to those pursuits which are\nproper to your family and worthy of your father; but if you be the son\nof Agnolo da Cascese, you will remain in Florence, and basely spend the\nremainder of your days in some branch of the woolen trade.\" These words\ngreatly influenced the youth, who, though he had at first almost refused\nto adopt such a course, said, he would submit himself wholly to what\nCosmo and Neri should determine. They, assenting to the request of the\nBolognese, provided suitable apparel, horses, and servants; and in a\nfew days he was escorted by a numerous cavalcade to Bologna, where the\nguardianship of Annibale's son and of the city were placed in his hands.\nHe conducted himself so prudently, that although all his ancestors had\nbeen slain by their enemies, he lived in peace and died respected by\neveryone.\nAfter the death of Niccolo Piccinino and the peace of La Marca, Filippo\nwishing to procure a leader of his forces, secretly negotiated with\nCiarpellone, one of the principal captains of Count Francesco, and\narrangements having been made, Ciarpellone asked permission to go to\nMilan to take possession of certain castles which had been given him by\nFilippo during the late wars. The count suspecting what was in progress,\nin order to prevent the duke from accommodating himself at his expense,\ncaused Ciarpellone to be arrested, and soon afterward put to death;\nalleging that he had been detected plotting against him. Filippo was\nhighly annoyed and indignant, which the Venetians and the Florentines\nwere glad to observe, for their greatest fear was, that the duke and the\ncount should become friends.\nThe duke's anger caused the renewal of war in La Marca. Gismondo\nMalatesti, lord of Rimino, being son-in-law of the count, expected to\nobtain Pesaro; but the count, having obtained possession, gave it to\nhis brother, Alessandro. Gismondo, offended at this, was still further\nexasperated at finding that Federigo di Montefeltro, his enemy, by the\ncount's assistance, gained possession of Urbino. He therefore joined the\nduke, and solicited the pope and the king to make war against the count,\nwho, to give Gismondo a taste of the war he so much desired, resolved to\ntake the initiative, and attacked him immediately. Thus Romagna and La\nMarca were again in complete confusion, for Filippo, the king, and the\npope, sent powerful assistance to Gismondo, while the Florentines and\nVenetians supplied the count with money, though not with men. Nor was\nFilippo satisfied with the war in Romagna, but also desired to take\nCremona and Pontremoli from the count; but Pontremoli was defended by\nthe Florentines, and Cremona by the Venetians. Thus the war was renewed\nin Lombardy, and after several engagements in the Cremonese, Francesco\nPiccinino, the leader of the duke's forces, was routed at Casale, by\nMicheletto and the Venetian troops. This victory gave the Venetians hope\nof obtaining the duke's dominions. They sent a commissary to Cremona,\nattacked the Ghiaradadda, and took the whole of it, except Crema. Then\ncrossing the Adda, they overran the country as far as Milan. Upon this\nthe duke had recourse to Alfonso, and entreated his assistance, pointing\nout the danger his kingdom would incur if Lombardy were to fall into\nthe hands of the Venetians. Alfonso promised to send him troops, but\napprised him of the difficulties which would attend their passage,\nwithout the permission of the count.\nFilippo, driven to extremity, then had recourse to Francesco, and begged\nhe would not abandon his father-in-law, now that he had become old and\nblind. The count was offended with the duke for making war against him;\nbut he was jealous of the increasing greatness of the Venetians, and\nhe himself began to be in want of money, for the League supplied him\nsparingly. The Florentines, being no longer in fear of the duke, ceased\nto stand in need of the count, and the Venetians desired his ruin; for\nthey thought Lombardy could not be taken from him except by this means;\nyet while Filippo sought to gain him over, and offered him the entire\ncommand of his forces, on condition that he should restore La Marca to\nthe pope and quit the Venetian alliance, ambassadors were sent to him by\nthat republic, promising him Milan, if they took it, and the perpetual\ncommand of their forces, if he would push the war in La Marca, and\nprevent Alfonso from sending troops into Lombardy. The offers of the\nVenetians were great, as also were their claims upon him, having begun\nthe war in order to save him from losing Cremona; while the injuries\nreceived from the duke were fresh in his memory, and his promises had\nlost all influence, still the count hesitated; for on the one hand, were\nto be considered his obligations to the League, his pledged faith,\ntheir recent services, and his hopes of the future, all which had\ntheir influence on him; on the other, were the entreaties of his\nfather-in-law, and above all, the bane which he feared would be\nconcealed under the specious offers of the Venetians, for he doubted\nnot, that both with regard to Milan and their other promises, if they\nwere victorious, he would be at their mercy, to which no prudent men\nwould ever submit if he could avoid it. These difficulties in the way\nof his forming a determination, were obviated by the ambition of the\nVenetians, who, seeing a chance of occupying Cremona, from secret\nintelligence with that city, under a different pretext, sent troops into\nits neighborhood; but the affair was discovered by those who commanded\nCremona for the count, and measures were adopted which prevented\nits success. Thus without obtaining Cremona, they lost the count's\nfriendship, who, now being free from all other considerations, joined\nthe duke.\nCHAPTER III\nDeath of Filippo Visconti, duke of Milan--The Milanese appoint Sforza\ntheir captain--Milan becomes a republic--The pope endeavors to restore\npeace to Italy--The Venetians oppose this design--Alfonso attacks the\nFlorentines--The neighborhood of Piombino becomes the principal\ntheater of war--Scarcity in the Florentine camp--Disorders occur in\nthe Neapolitan and Florentine armies--Alfonso sues for peace and is\ncompelled to retreat--Pavia surrenders to the count--Displeasure of\nthe Milanese--The count besieges Caravaggio--The Venetians endeavor to\nrelieve the place--They are routed by the count before Caravaggio.\nPope Eugenius being dead, was succeeded by Nicholas V. The count had his\nwhole army at Cotignola, ready to pass into Lombardy, when intelligence\nwas brought him of the death of Filippo, which happened on the last\nday of August, 1447. This event greatly afflicted him, for he doubted\nwhether his troops were in readiness, on account of their arrears of\npay; he feared the Venetians, who were his armed enemies, he having\nrecently forsaken them and taken part with the duke; he was in\napprehension from Alfonso, his inveterate foe; he had no hope from the\npontiff or the Florentines; for the latter were allies of the Venetians,\nand he had seized the territories of the former. However, he resolved to\nface his fortune and be guided by circumstances; for it often happens,\nthat when engaged in business valuable ideas are suggested, which in a\nstate of inaction would never have occurred. He had great hopes, that if\nthe Milanese were disposed to defend themselves against the ambition of\nthe Venetians, they could make use of no other power but his. Therefore,\nhe proceeded confidently into the Bolognese territory, thence to Modena\nand Reggio, halted with his forces upon the Lenza, and sent to offer his\nservices at Milan. On the death of the duke, part of the Milanese were\ninclined to establish a republic; others wished to choose a prince, and\nof these, one part favored the count, and another Alfonso. However, the\nmajority being in favor of freedom, they prevailed over the rest,\nand organized a republic, to which many cities of the Duchy refused\nobedience; for they, too, desired to live in the enjoyment of their\nliberty, and even those who did not embrace such views, refused to\nsubmit to the sovereignty of the Milanese. Lodi and Piacenza surrendered\nthemselves to the Venetians; Pavia and Parma became free. This confused\nstate of things being known to the count, he proceeded to Cremona, where\nhis ambassadors and those of the Milanese arranged for him to command\nthe forces of the new republic, with the same remuneration he had\nreceived from the duke at the time of his decease. To this they added\nthe possession of Brescia, until Verona was recovered, when he should\nhave that city and restore Brescia to the Milanese.\nBefore the duke's death, Pope Nicholas, after his assumption of the\npontificate, sought to restore peace among the princes of Italy, and\nwith this object endeavored, in conjunction with the ambassadors sent by\nthe Florentines to congratulate him on his accession, to appoint a diet\nat Ferrara to attempt either the arrangement of a long truce, or the\nestablishment of peace. A congress was accordingly held in that city,\nof the pope's legate and the Venetian, ducal, and Florentine\nrepresentatives. King Alfonso had no envoy there. He was at Tivoli with\na great body of horse and foot, and favorable to the duke; both having\nresolved, that having gained the count over to their side, they would\nopenly attack the Florentines and Venetians, and till the arrival of\nthe count in Lombardy, take part in the treaty for peace at Ferrara, at\nwhich, though the king did not appear, he engaged to concur in whatever\ncourse the duke should adopt. The conference lasted several days, and\nafter many debates, resolved on either a truce for five years, or a\npermanent peace, whichsoever the duke should approve; and the ducal\nambassadors, having returned to Milan to learn his decision, found him\ndead. Notwithstanding this, the Milanese were disposed to adopt the\nresolutions of the assembly, but the Venetians refused, indulging\ngreat hopes of becoming masters of Lombardy, particularly as Lodi and\nPiacenza, immediately after the duke's death, had submitted to them.\nThey trusted that either by force or by treaty they could strip Milan\nof her power; and then so press her, as to compel her also to surrender\nbefore any assistance could arrive; and they were the more confident of\nthis from seeing the Florentines involved in war with King Alfonso.\nThe king being at Tivoli, and designing to pursue his enterprise against\nTuscany, as had been arranged between himself and Filippo, judging\nthat the war now commenced in Lombardy would give him both time and\nopportunity, and wishing to have a footing in the Florentine state\nbefore he openly commenced hostilities, opened a secret understanding\nwith the fortress of Cennina, in the Val d'Arno Superiore, and took\npossession of it. The Florentines, surprised with this unexpected event,\nperceiving the king already in action, and resolved to do them all\nthe injury in his power, hired forces, created a council of ten for\nmanagement of the war, and prepared for the conflict in their usual\nmanner. The king was already in the Siennese, and used his utmost\nendeavors to reduce the city, but the inhabitants of Sienna were firm in\ntheir attachment to the Florentines, and refused to receive him within\ntheir walls or into any of their territories. They furnished him with\nprovisions, alleging in excuse, the enemy's power and their inability\nto resist. The king, finding he could not enter by the Val d'Arno, as he\nhad first intended, both because Cennina had been already retaken, and\nbecause the Florentines were now in some measure prepared for their\ndefense, turned toward Volterra, and occupied many fortresses in that\nterritory. Thence he proceeded toward Pisa, and with the assistance of\nFazio and Arrigo de' Conti, of the Gherardesca, took some castles, and\nissuing from them, assailed Campiglia, but could not take it, the place\nbeing defended by the Florentines, and it being now in the depth of\nwinter. Upon this the king, leaving garrisons in the places he had taken\nto harass the surrounding country, withdrew with the remainder of his\narmy to quarters in the Siennese. The Florentines, aided by the season,\nused the most active exertions to provide themselves troops, whose\ncaptains were Federigo, lord of Urbino, and Gismondo Malatesti da\nRimino, who, though mutual foes, were kept so united by the prudence\nof the commissaries, Neri di Gino and Bernardetto de' Medici, that they\nbroke up their quarters while the weather was still very severe and\nrecovered not only the places that had been taken in the territory of\nPisa, but also the Pomerancie in the neighborhood of Volterra, and so\nchecked the king's troops, which at first had overrun the Maremma, that\nthey could scarcely retain the places they had been left to garrison.\nUpon the return of the spring the commissaries halted with their whole\nforce, consisting of five thousand horse and two thousand foot, at the\nSpedaletto. The king approached with his army, amounting to fifteen\nthousand men, within three miles of Campiglia, but when it was expected\nhe would attack the place he fell upon Piombino, hoping, as it was\ninsufficiently provided, to take it with very little trouble, and thus\nacquire a very important position, the loss of which would be severely\nfelt by the Florentines; for from it he would be able to exhaust them\nwith a long war, obtain his own provision by sea, and harass the whole\nterritory of Pisa. They were greatly alarmed at this attack, and,\nconsidering that if they could remain with their army among the woods\nof Campiglia, the king would be compelled to retire either in defeat\nor disgrace. With this view they equipped four galleys at Livorno, and\nhaving succeeded in throwing three hundred infantry into Piombino,\ntook up their own position at the Caldane, a place where it would be\ndifficult to attack them; and they thought it would be dangerous to\nencamp among the thickets of the plain.\nThe Florentine army depended for provisions on the surrounding places,\nwhich, being poor and thinly inhabited, had difficulty in supplying\nthem. Consequently the troops suffered, particularly from want of wine,\nfor none being produced in that vicinity, and unable to procure it from\nmore distant places, it was impossible to obtain a sufficient quantity.\nBut the king, though closely pressed by the Florentines, was well\nprovided except in forage, for he obtained everything else by sea. The\nFlorentines, desirous to supply themselves in the same manner, loaded\nfour vessels with provisions, but, upon their approach, they were\nattacked by seven of the king's galleys, which took two of them and\nput the rest to flight. This disaster made them despair of procuring\nprovisions, so that two hundred men of a foraging party, principally for\nwant of wine, deserted to the king, and the rest complained that\nthey could not live without it, in a situation where the heat was so\nexcessive and the water bad. The commissaries therefore determined\nto quit the place, and endeavor to recover those castles which still\nremained in the enemy's power; who, on his part, though not suffering\nfrom want of provisions, and greatly superior in numbers, found his\nenterprise a failure, from the ravages made in his army by those\ndiseases which the hot season produces in marshy localities; and which\nprevailed to such an extent that many died daily, and nearly all were\naffected. These circumstances occasioned overtures of peace. The king\ndemanded fifty thousand florins, and the possession of Piombino. When\nthe terms were under consideration, many citizens, desirous of peace,\nwould have accepted them, declaring there was no hope of bringing to a\nfavorable conclusion a war which required so much money to carry it on.\nBut Neri Capponi going to Florence, placed the matter in a more correct\nlight, and it was then unanimously determined to reject the proposal,\nand take the lord of Piombino under their protection, with an alliance\noffensive and defensive, provided he did not abandon them, but assist in\ntheir defense as hitherto. The king being informed of this resolution,\nsaw that, with his reduced army, he could not gain the place, and\nwithdrew in the same condition as if completely routed, leaving behind\nhim two thousand dead. With the remainder of his sick troops he retired\nto the Siennese territory, and thence to his kingdom, incensed against\nthe Florentines, and threatening them with new wars upon the return of\nspring.\nWhile these events were proceeding in Tuscany the Count Sforza, having\nbecome leader of the Milanese forces, strenuously endeavored to secure\nthe friendship of Francesco Piccinino, who was also in their service,\nthat he might support him in his enterprises, or be less disposed to do\nhim injury. He then took the field with his army, upon which the people\nof Pavia, conscious of their inability to resist him, and unwilling to\nobey the Milanese, offered to submit themselves to his authority, on\ncondition that he should not subject them to the power of Milan. The\ncount desired the possession of Pavia, and considered the circumstance\na happy omen, as it would enable him to give a color to his designs. He\nwas not restrained from treachery either by fear or shame; for great men\nconsider failure disgraceful,--a fraudulent success the contrary. But\nhe was apprehensive that his possession of the city would excite the\nanimosity of the Milanese, and perhaps induce them to throw themselves\nunder the power of the Venetians. If he refused to accept the offer,\nhe would have occasion to fear the duke of Savoy, to whom many citizens\nwere inclined to submit themselves; and either alternative would deprive\nhim of the sovereignty of Lombardy. Concluding there was less danger in\ntaking possession of the city than in allowing another to have it, he\ndetermined to accept the proposal of the people of Pavia, trusting he\nwould be able to satisfy the Milanese, to whom he pointed out the danger\nthey must have incurred had he not complied with it; for her citizens\nwould have surrendered themselves to the Venetians or to the duke of\nSavoy; so that in either case they would have been deprived of the\ngovernment, and therefore they ought to be more willing to have himself\nas their neighbor and friend, than a hostile power such as either of the\nothers, and their enemy. The Milanese were upon this occasion greatly\nperplexed, imagining they had discovered the count's ambition, and\nthe end he had in view; but they thought it desirable to conceal their\nfears, for they did not know, if the count were to desert them, to whom\nthey could have recourse except the Venetians, whose pride and tyranny\nthey naturally dreaded. They therefore resolved not to break with the\ncount, but by his assistance remedy the evils with which they were\nthreatened, hoping that when freed from them they might rescue\nthemselves from him also; for at that time they were assailed not only\nby the Venetians but by the Genoese and the duke of Savoy, in the name\nof Charles of Orleans, the son of a sister of Filippo, but whom the\ncount easily vanquished. Thus their only remaining enemies were the\nVenetians, who, with a powerful army, determined to occupy their\nterritories, and had already taken possession of Lodi and Piacenza,\nbefore which latter place the count encamped; and, after a long siege,\ntook and pillaged the city. Winter being set in, he led his forces into\nquarters, and then withdrew to Cremona, where, during the cold season,\nhe remained in repose with his wife.\nIn the spring, the Venetian and Milanese armies again took the field. It\nwas the design of the Milanese, first to recover Lodi and then to come\nto terms with the Venetians; for the expenses of the war had become very\ngreat, and they were doubtful of their general's sincerity, so that they\nwere anxious alike for the repose of peace, and for security against the\ncount. They therefore resolved that the army should march to the siege\nof Carravaggio, hoping that Lodi would surrender, on that fortress being\nwrested from the enemy's hands. The count obeyed, though he would have\npreferred crossing the Adda and attacking the Brescian territory. Having\nencamped before Caravaggio, he so strongly entrenched himself, that if\nthe enemy attempted to relieve the place, they would have to attack\nhim at a great disadvantage. The Venetian army, led by Micheletto,\napproached within two bowshots of the enemy's camp, and many skirmishes\nensued. The count continued to press the fortress, and reduced it to the\nvery last extremity, which greatly distressed the Venetians, since they\nknew the loss of it would involve the total failure of their expedition.\nVery different views were entertained by their military officers\nrespecting the best mode of relieving the place, but they saw no\ncourse open except to attack the enemy in his trenches, in spite of\nall obstacles. The castle was, however, considered of such paramount\nimportance, that the Venetian senate, though naturally timid, and averse\nto all hazardous undertakings, chose rather to risk everything than\nallow it to fall into the hands of the enemy.\nThey therefore resolved to attack the count at all events, and early\nthe next morning commenced their assault upon a point which was least\ndefended. At the first charge, as commonly happens in a surprise,\nFrancesco's whole army was thrown into dismay. Order, however, was\nsoon so completely restored by the count, that the enemy, after various\nefforts to gain the outworks, were repulsed and put to flight; and so\nentirely routed, that of twelve thousand horse only one thousand escaped\nthe hands of the Milanese, who took possession of all the carriages\nand military stores; nor had the Venetians ever before suffered such a\nthorough rout and overthrow. Among the plunder and prisoners, crouching\ndown, as if to escape observation, was found a Venetian commissary, who,\nin the course of the war and before the fight, had spoken contemptuously\nof the count, calling him \"bastard,\" and \"base-born.\" Being made\nprisoner, he remembered his faults, and fearing punishment, being taken\nbefore the count, was agonized with terror; and, as is usual with\nmean minds (in prosperity insolent, in adversity abject and cringing),\nprostrated himself, weeping and begging pardon for the offenses he\nhad committed. The count, taking him by the arm, raised him up, and\nencouraged him to hope for the best. He then said he wondered how a\nman so prudent and respectable as himself, could so far err as to\nspeak disparagingly of those who did not merit it; and as regarded the\ninsinuations which he had made against him, he really did not know how\nSforza his father, and Madonna Lucia his mother, had proceeded together,\nnot having been there, and having no opportunity of interfering in the\nmatter, so that he was not liable either to blame or praise. However,\nhe knew very well, that in regard to his own actions he had conducted\nhimself so that no one could blame him; and in proof of this he would\nrefer both the Venetian senate and himself to what had happened that\nday. He then advised him in future to be more respectful in speaking of\nothers, and more cautious in regard to his own proceedings.\nCHAPTER IV\nThe count's successes--The Venetians come to terms with him--Views of\nthe Venetians--Indignation of the Milanese against the count--Their\nambassador's address to him--The count's moderation and reply--The count\nand the Milanese prepare for war--Milanese ambassadors at Venice--League\nof the Venetians and Milanese--The count dupes the Venetians and\nMilanese--He applies for assistance to the Florentines--Diversity of\nopinions in Florence on the subject--Neri di Gino Capponi averse to\nassisting the count--Cosmo de' Medici disposed to do so--The Florentines\nsent ambassadors to the count.\nAfter this victory, the count marched into the Brescian territory,\noccupied the whole country, and then pitched his camp within two miles\nof the city. The Venetians, having well-grounded fears that Brescia\nwould be next attacked, provided the best defense in their power. They\nthen collected the relics of their army, and, by virtue of the treaty,\ndemanded assistance of the Florentines; who, being relieved from the\nwar with Alfonso, sent them one thousand foot and two thousand horse, by\nwhose aid the Venetians were in a condition to treat for peace. At one\ntime it seemed the fate of their republic to lose by war and win by\nnegotiation; for what was taken from them in battle was frequently\nrestored twofold on the restoration of peace. They knew the Milanese\nwere jealous of the count, and that he wished to be not their captain\nmerely, but their sovereign; and as it was in their power to make peace\nwith either of the two (the one desiring it from ambition, the other\nfrom fear), they determined to make choice of the count, and offer him\nassistance to effect his design; persuading themselves, that as the\nMilanese would perceive they had been duped by him, they would in\nrevenge place themselves in the power of any one rather than in his; and\nthat, becoming unable either to defend themselves or trust the count,\nthey would be compelled, having no other resource, to fall into their\nhands. Having taken this resolution, they sounded the count, and found\nhim quite disposed for peace, evidently desirous that the honor and\nadvantage of the victory at Caravaggio should be his own, and not accrue\nto the Milanese. The parties therefore entered into an agreement, in\nwhich the Venetians undertook to pay the count thirteen thousand florins\nper month, till he should obtain Milan, and to furnish him, during the\ncontinuance of the war, four thousand horse and two thousand foot. The\ncount engaged to restore to the Venetians the towns, prisoners, and\nwhatever else had been taken by him during the late campaigns, and\ncontent himself with those territories which the duke possessed at the\ntime of his death.\nWhen this treaty became known at Milan, it grieved the citizens more\nthan the victory at Caravaggio had exhilarated them. The rulers of the\ncity mourned, the people complained, women and children wept, and all\nexclaimed against the count as false and perfidious. Although they\ncould not hope that either prayers or promises would divert him from his\nungrateful design, they sent ambassadors to see with what kind of color\nhe would invest his unprincipled proceedings, and being admitted to his\npresence, one of them spoke to the following effect;--\"It is customary\nwith those who wish to obtain a favor, to make use either of prayers,\npresents, or threats, that pity, convenience, or fear, may induce a\ncompliance with their requests. But as with cruel, avaricious, or, in\ntheir own conceit, powerful men, these arguments have no weight, it is\nvain to hope, either to soften them by prayers, win them by presents, or\nalarm them by menaces. We, therefore, being now, though late, aware of\nthy pride, cruelty, and ambition, come hither, not to ask aught, nor\nwith the hope, even if we were so disposed, of obtaining it, but to\nremind thee of the benefits thou hast received from the people of Milan,\nand to prove with what heartless ingratitude thou hast repaid them,\nthat at least, under the many evils oppressing us, we may derive some\ngratification from telling thee how and by whom they have been produced.\nThou canst not have forgotten thy wretched condition at the death of the\nduke Filippo; the king and the pope were both thine enemies; thou hadst\nabandoned the Florentines and the Venetians, who, on account of their\njust indignation, and because they stood in no further need of thee,\nwere almost become thy declared enemies. Thou wert exhausted by thy\nwars against the church; with few followers, no friends, or any money;\nhopeless of being able to preserve either thy territories or thy\nreputation. From these circumstances thy ruin must have ensued, but for\nour simplicity; we received thee to our home, actuated by reverence for\nthe happy memory of our duke, with whom, being connected by marriage and\nrenewed alliance, we believed thy affection would descend to those\nwho had inherited his authority, and that, if to the benefits he had\nconferred on thee, our own were added, the friendship we sought to\nestablish would not only be firm, but inseparable; with this impression,\nwe added Verona or Brescia to thy previous appointments. What more could\nwe either give or promise thee? What else couldst thou, not from\nus merely, but from any others, have either had or expected? Thou\nreceivedst from us an unhoped-for benefit, and we, in return, an\nunmerited wrong. Neither hast thou deferred until now the manifestation\nof thy base designs; for no sooner wert thou appointed to command our\narmies, than, contrary to every dictate of propriety, thou didst accept\nPavia, which plainly showed what was to be the result of thy friendship;\nbut we bore with the injury, in hope that the greatness of the advantage\nwould satisfy thy ambition. Alas! those who grasp at all cannot be\nsatisfied with a part. Thou didst promise that we should possess the\nconquests which thou might afterward make; for thou wert well aware that\nwhat was given at many times might be withdrawn at once, as was the case\nafter the victory at Caravaggio, purchased by our money and blood, and\nfollowed by our ruin. Oh! unhappy states, which have to guard against\ntheir oppressor; but much more wretched those who have to trust to\nmercenary and faithless arms like thine! May our example instruct\nposterity, since that of Thebes and Philip of Macedon, who, after\nvictory over her enemies, from being her captain became her foe and her\nprince, could not avail us.\n\"The only fault of which we are conscious is our over-weening confidence\nin one whom we ought not to have trusted; for thy past life, thy\nrestless mind, incapable of repose, ought to have put us on our guard;\nneither ought we to have confided in one who betrayed the lord of Lucca,\nset a fine upon the Florentines and the Venetians, defied the duke,\ndespised the king, and besides all this, persecuted the church of God,\nand the Divinity himself with innumerable atrocities. We ought not to\nhave fancied that so many potentates possessed less influence over the\nmind of Francesco Sforza, than the Milanese; or that he would preserve\nunblemished that faith towards us which he had on so many occasions\nbroken with them. Still this want of caution in us does not excuse the\nperfidy in thee; nor can it obliterate the infamy with which our just\ncomplaints will blacken thy character throughout the world, or prevent\nthe remorse of thy conscience, when our arms are used for our own\ndestruction; for thou wilt see that the sufferings due to parricides are\nfully deserved by thee. And though ambition should blind thine eyes, the\nwhole world, witness to thine iniquity, will compel thee to open them;\nGod himself will unclose them, if perjuries, if violated faith, if\ntreacheries displease him, and if, as ever, he is still the enemy of the\nwicked. Do not, therefore, promise thyself any certainty of victory; for\nthe just wrath of the Almighty will weigh heavily upon thee; and we are\nresolved to lose our liberty only with our lives; but if we found we\ncould not ultimately defend it, we would submit ourselves to anyone\nrather than to thee. And if our sins be so great that in spite of\nour utmost resolution, we should still fall into thy hands, be quite\nassured, that the sovereignty which is commenced in deceit and villainy,\nwill terminate either in thyself or thy children with ignominy and\nblood.\"\nThe count, though not insensible to the just reproaches of the Milanese,\ndid not exhibit either by words or gestures any unusual excitement, and\nreplied, that \"He willingly attributed to their angry feelings all the\nserious charges of their indiscreet harangue; and he would reply to\nthem in detail, were he in the presence of anyone who could decide\ntheir differences; for it would be evident that he had not injured the\nMilanese, but only taken care that they should not injure him. They\nwell knew how they had proceeded after the victory of Caravaggio; for,\ninstead of rewarding him with either Verona or Brescia, they sought\npeace with the Venetians, that all the blame of the quarrel might rest\non him, themselves obtaining the fruit of victory, the credit of peace,\nand all the advantages that could be derived from the war. It would\nthus be manifest they had no right to complain, when he had effected\nthe arrangements which they first attempted to make; and that if he had\ndeferred to do so a little longer, he would have had reason to accuse\nthem of the ingratitude with which they were now charging him. Whether\nthe charge were true or false, that God, whom they had invoked to avenge\ntheir injuries, would show at the conclusion of the war, and would\ndemonstrate which was most his friend, and who had most justice on their\nside.\"\nUpon the departure of the ambassadors, the count determined to attack\nthe Milanese, who prepared for their defense, and appointed Francesco\nand Jacopo Piccinino (attached to their cause, on account of the ancient\nfeud of the families of Braccio and Sforza) to conduct their forces in\nsupport of liberty; at least till they could deprive the count of\nthe aid of the Venetians, who they did not think would long be either\nfriendly or faithful to him. On the other hand, the count, perfectly\naware of this, thought it not imprudent, supposing the obligation of\nthe treaty insufficient, to bind them by the ties of interest; and,\ntherefore, in assigning to each their portion of the enterprise, he\nconsented that the Venetians should attack Crema, and himself, with the\nother forces, assail the remainder of the territory. The advantage of\nthis arrangement kept the Venetians so long in alliance with the count,\nthat he was enabled to conquer the whole of the Milanese territory, and\nto press the city so closely, that the inhabitants could not provide\nthemselves with necessaries; despairing of success, they sent envoys to\nthe Venetians to beg they would compassionate their distress, and, as\nought to be the case between republics, assist them in defense of their\nliberty against a tyrant, whom, if once master of their city, they would\nbe unable to restrain; neither did they think he would be content with\nthe boundaries assigned him by the treaty, but would expect all the\ndependencies of Milan.\nThe Venetians had not yet taken Crema, and wishing before they changed\nsides, to effect this point, they PUBLICLY answered the envoys, that\ntheir engagements with the count prevented them from defending the\nMilanese; but SECRETLY, gave them every assurance of their wish to do\nso.\nThe count had approached so near Milan with his forces, that he was\ndisputing the suburbs with the inhabitants, when the Venetians having\ntaken Crema, thought they need no longer hesitate to declare in favor of\nthe Milanese, with whom they made peace and entered into alliance; among\nthe terms of which was the defense of their liberty unimpaired. Having\ncome to this agreement, they ordered their forces to withdraw from the\ncount's camp and to return to the Venetian territory. They informed\nhim of the peace made with the Milanese, and gave him twenty days to\nconsider what course he would adopt. He was not surprised at the step\ntaken by the Venetians, for he had long foreseen it, and expected its\noccurrence daily; but when it actually took place, he could not\navoid feeling regret and displeasure similar to what the Milanese had\nexperienced when he abandoned them. He took two days to consider the\nreply he would make to the ambassadors whom the Venetians had sent to\ninform him of the treaty, and during this time he determined to dupe the\nVenetians, and not abandon his enterprise; therefore, appearing openly\nto accept the proposal for peace, he sent his ambassadors to Venice with\nfull credentials to effect the ratification, but gave them secret orders\nnot to do so, and with pretexts or caviling to put it off. To give the\nVenetians greater assurance of his sincerity, he made a truce with the\nMilanese for a month, withdrew from Milan and divided his forces among\nthe places he had taken. This course was the occasion of his victory and\nthe ruin of the Milanese; for the Venetians, confident of peace, were\nslow in preparing for war, and the Milanese finding the truce concluded,\nthe enemy withdrawn, and the Venetians their friends, felt assured that\nthe count had determined to abandon his design. This idea injured them\nin two ways: one, by neglecting to provide for their defense; the next,\nthat, being seed-time, they sowed a large quantity of grain in the\ncountry which the enemy had evacuated, and thus brought famine upon\nthemselves. On the other hand, all that was injurious to his enemies\nfavored the count, and the time gave him opportunity to take breath and\nprovide himself with assistance.\nThe Florentines during the war of Lombardy had not declared in favor of\neither party, or assisted the count either in defense of the Milanese or\nsince; for he never having been in need had not pressingly requested\nit; and they only sent assistance to the Venetians after the rout at\nCaravaggio, in pursuance of the treaty. Count Francesco, standing now\nalone, and not knowing to whom else he could apply, was compelled to\nrequest immediate aid of the Florentines, publicly from the state, and\nprivately from friends, particularly from Cosmo de' Medici, with whom he\nhad always maintained a steady friendship, and by whom he had constantly\nbeen faithfully advised and liberally supported. Nor did Cosmo abandon\nhim in his extreme necessity, but supplied him generously from his own\nresources, and encouraged him to prosecute his design. He also wished\nthe city publicly to assist him, but there were difficulties in the way.\nNeri di Gino Capponi, one of the most powerful citizens of Florence,\nthought it not to the advantage of the city, that the count should\nobtain Milan; and was of opinion that it would be more to the safety\nof Italy for him to ratify the peace than pursue the war. In the first\nplace, he apprehended that the Milanese, through their anger against the\ncount, would surrender themselves entirely to the Venetians, which would\noccasion the ruin of all. Supposing he should occupy Milan, it appeared\nto him that so great military superiority, combined with such an extent\nof territory, would be dangerous to themselves, and that if as count\nhe was intolerable, he would become doubly so as duke. He therefore\nconsidered it better for the republic of Florence and for Italy, that\nthe count should be content with his military reputation, and that\nLombardy should be divided into two republics, which could never be\nunited to injure others, and separately are unable to do so. To attain\nthis he saw no better means than to refrain from aiding the count, and\ncontinuing in the former league with the Venetians. These reasonings\nwere not satisfactory to Cosmo's friends, for they imagined that Neri\nhad argued thus, not from a conviction of its advantage to the republic,\nbut to prevent the count, as a friend of Cosmo, from becoming duke,\napprehending that Cosmo would, in consequence of this, become too\npowerful.\nCosmo, in reply, pointed out, that to lend assistance to the count would\nbe highly beneficial both to Italy and the republic; for it was unwise\nto imagine the Milanese could preserve their own liberty; for the nature\nof their community, their mode of life, and their hereditary feuds were\nopposed to every kind of civil government, so that it was necessary,\neither that the count should become duke of Milan, or the Venetians her\nlords. And surely under such circumstances, no one could doubt which\nwould be most to their advantage, to have for their neighbor a powerful\nfriend or a far more powerful foe. Neither need it be apprehended\nthat the Milanese, while at war with the count, would submit to the\nVenetians; for the count had a stronger party in the city, and\nthe Venetians had not, so that whenever they were unable to defend\nthemselves as freemen, they would be more inclined to obey the count\nthan the Venetians.\nThese diverse views kept the city long in suspense; but at length it\nwas resolved to send ambassadors to the count to settle the terms of\nagreement, with instructions, that if they found him in such a condition\nas to give hopes of his ultimate success, they were to close with him,\nbut, if otherwise, they were to draw out the time in diplomacy.\nCHAPTER V\nProsecution of the war between the count and the Milanese--The Milanese\nreduced to extremity--The people rise against the magistrates--Milan\nsurrenders to the count--League between the new duke of Milan and the\nFlorentines, and between the king of Naples and the Venetians--Venetian\nand Neapolitan ambassadors at Florence--Answer of Cosmo de' Medici to\nthe Venetian ambassador--Preparations of the Venetians and the king\nof Naples for the war--The Venetians excite disturbances in\nBologna--Florence prepares for war--The emperor, Frederick III.\nat Florence--War in Lombardy between the duke of Milan and the\nVenetians--Ferrando, son of the king of Naples, marches into Tuscany\nagainst the Florentines.\nThe ambassadors were at Reggio when they heard that the count had become\nlord of Milan; for as soon as the truce had expired, he approached the\ncity with his forces, hoping quickly to get possession of it in spite\nof the Venetians, who could bring no relief except from the side of\nthe Adda, which route he could easily obstruct, and therefore had no\napprehension (being then winter) of their arrival, and he trusted that,\nbefore the return of spring, he would be victorious, particularly, as\nby the death of Francesco Piccinino, there remained only Jacopo his\nbrother, to command the Milanese. The Venetians had sent an ambassador\nto Milan to confirm the citizens in their resolution of defense,\npromising them powerful and immediate aid. During the winter a few\nslight skirmishes had taken place between the count and the Venetians;\nbut on the approach of milder weather, the latter, under Pandolfo\nMalatesti, halted with their army upon the Adda, and considering\nwhether, in order to succor the Milanese, they ought to risk a battle,\nPardolfo, their general, aware of the count's abilities, and the courage\nof his army, said it would be unadvisable to do so, and that, under the\ncircumstances, it was needless, for the count, being in great want of\nforage, could not keep the field, and must soon retire. He therefore\nadvised them to remain encamped, to keep the Milanese in hope, and\nprevent them from surrendering. This advice was approved by the\nVenetians, both as being safe, and because, by keeping the Milanese in\nthis necessity, they might be the sooner compelled to submit to their\ndominion; for they felt quite sure that the injuries they had received\nwould always prevent their submission to the count.\nIn the meantime, the Milanese were reduced to the utmost misery; and as\nthe city usually abounded with poor, many died of hunger in the streets;\nhence arose complaints and disturbances in several parts, which alarmed\nthe magistrates, and compelled them to use their utmost exertions to\nprevent popular meetings. The multitude are always slow to resolve on\ncommotion; but the resolution once formed, any trivial circumstance\nexcites it to action. Two men in humble life, talking together near the\nPorta Nuova of the calamities of the city, their own misery, and the\nmeans that might be adopted for their relief, others beginning to\ncongregate, there was soon collected a large crowd; in consequence of\nit a report was spread that the neighborhood of Porta Nuova had risen\nagainst the government. Upon this, all the lower orders, who only waited\nfor an example, assembled in arms, and chose Gasparre da Vicomercato to\nbe their leader. They then proceeded to the place where the magistrates\nwere assembled, and attacked them so impetuously that all who did not\nescape by flight were slain: among the number, as being considered a\nprincipal cause of the famine, and gratified at their distress, fell\nLionardo Veniero, the Venetian ambassador. Having thus almost become\nmasters of the city, they considered what course was next to be adopted\nto escape from the horrors surrounding them, and to procure peace. A\nfeeling universally prevailed, that as they could not preserve their own\nliberty, they ought to submit to a prince who could defend them. Some\nproposed King Alfonso, some the duke of Savoy, and others the king\nof France, but none mentioned the count, so great was the general\nindignation against him. However, disagreeing with the rest, Gasparre da\nVicomercato proposed him, and explained in detail that if they desired\nrelief from war, no other plan was open, since the people of Milan\nrequired a certain and immediate peace, and not a distant hope\nof succor. He apologized for the count's proceedings, accused the\nVenetians, and all the powers of Italy, of which some from ambition and\nothers from avarice were averse to their possessing freedom. Having to\ndispose of their liberty, it would be preferable, he said, to obey one\nwho knew and could defend them; so that, by their servitude they might\nobtain peace, and not bring upon themselves greater evils and more\ndangerous wars. He was listened to with the most profound attention;\nand, having concluded his harangue, it was unanimously resolved by the\nassembly, that the count should be called in, and Gasparre was appointed\nto wait upon him and signify their desire. By the people's command he\nconveyed the pleasing and happy intelligence to the count, who heard\nit with the utmost satisfaction, and entered Milan as prince on the\ntwenty-sixth of February, 1450, where he was received with the greatest\npossible joy by those who, only a short time previously had heaped on\nhim all the slanders that hatred could inspire.\nThe news of this event reaching Florence, orders were immediately sent\nto the envoys who were upon the way to Milan, that instead of treating\nfor his alliance with the count, they should congratulate the duke\nupon his victory; they, arranging accordingly, had a most honorable\nreception, and were treated with all possible respect; for the duke\nwell knew that in all Italy he could not find braver or more faithful\nfriends, to defend him against the power of the Venetians, than the\nFlorentines, who, being no longer in fear of the house of Visconti,\nfound themselves opposed by the Aragonese and Venetians; for the\nAragonese princes of Naples were jealous of the friendship which\nthe Florentines had always evinced for the family of France; and the\nVenetians seeing the ancient enmity of the Florentines against the\nVisconti transferred to themselves, resolved to injure them as much\nas possible; for they knew how pertinaciously and invariably they had\npersecuted the Lombard princes. These considerations caused the new duke\nwillingly to join the Florentines, and united the Venetians and King\nAlfonso against their common enemies; impelling them at the same time to\nhostilities, the king against the Florentines, and the Venetians against\nthe duke, who, being fresh in the government, would, they imagined, be\nunable to resist them, even with all the aid he could obtain.\nBut as the league between the Florentines and the Venetians still\ncontinued, and as the king, after the war of Piombino, had made peace\nwith the former, it seemed indecent to commence an open rupture until\nsome plausible reason could be assigned in justification of offensive\nmeasures. On this account each sent ambassadors to Florence, who, on the\npart of their sovereigns, signified that the league formed between them\nwas made not for injury to any, but solely for the mutual defense\nof their states. The Venetian ambassador then complained that the\nFlorentines had allowed Alessandro, the duke's brother, to pass into\nLombardy with his forces; and besides this, had assisted and advised\nin the treaty made between the duke and the marquis of Mantua, matters\nwhich he declared to be injurious to the Venetians, and inconsistent\nwith the friendship hitherto subsisting between the two governments;\namicably reminding them, that one who inflicts unmerited injury, gives\nothers just ground of hostility, and that those who break a peace may\nexpect war. The Signory appointed Cosmo de' Medici to reply to what had\nbeen said by the Venetian ambassador, and in a long and excellent\nspeech he recounted the numerous advantages conferred by the city on the\nVenetian republic; showed what an extent of dominion they had acquired\nby the money, forces, and counsel of the Florentines, and reminded him\nthat, although the friendship had originated with the Florentines, they\nhad never given occasion of enmity; and as they desired peace, they\ngreatly rejoiced when the treaty was made, if it had been entered into\nfor the sake of peace, and not of war. True it was, he wondered much\nat the remarks which had been made, seeing that such light and trivial\nmatters should give offense to so great a republic; but if they were\nworthy of notice he must have it universally understood, that the\nFlorentines wished their country to be free and open to all; and that\nthe duke's character was such, that if he desired the friendship of\nthe marquis of Mantua, he had no need of anyone's favor or advice. He\ntherefore feared that these cavils were produced by some latent motive,\nwhich it was not thought proper to disclose. Be this as it might,\nthey would freely declare to all, that in the same proportion as the\nfriendship of the Florentines was beneficial their enmity could be\ndestructive.\nThe matter was hushed up; and the ambassadors, on their departure,\nappeared perfectly satisfied. But the league between the king and the\nVenetians made the Florentines and the duke rather apprehend war than\nhope for a long continuance of peace. They therefore entered into an\nalliance, and at the same time the enmity of the Venetians transpired by\na treaty with the Siennese, and the expulsion of all Florentine subjects\nfrom their cities and territories. Shortly after this, Alfonso did the\nsame, without any consideration of the peace made the year previous, and\nnot having even the shadow of an excuse. The Venetians attempted to\ntake Bologna, and having armed the emigrants, and united to them a\nconsiderable force, introduced them into the city by night through one\nof the common sewers. No sooner had they entered, than they raised a\ncry, by which Santi Bentivogli, being awakened, was told that the whole\ncity was in possession of the rebels. But though many advised him\nto escape, saying that he could not save the city by his stay, he\ndetermined to confront the danger, and taking arms encouraged his\nfollowers, assembled a few friends, attacked and routed part of the\nrebels, slew many more, and drove the remainder out of the city. By this\nact of bravery all agreed he had fully proved himself a genuine scion of\nthe house of the Bentivogli.\nThese events and demonstrations gave the Florentines an earnest of\napproaching war; they consequently followed their usual practice on\nsimilar occasions, and created the Council of Ten. They engaged new\ncondottieri, sent ambassadors to Rome, Naples, Venice, Milan, and\nSienna, to demand assistance from their friends, gain information about\nthose they suspected, decide such as were wavering, and discover the\ndesigns of the foe. From the pope they obtained only general expressions\nof an amicable disposition and admonitions to peace; from the king,\nempty excuses for having expelled the Florentines, and offers of safe\nconduct for whoever should demand it; and although he endeavored, as\nmuch as possible, to conceal every indication of his hostile designs,\nthe ambassadors felt convinced of his unfriendly disposition, and\nobserved many preparations tending to the injury of the republic. The\nLeague with the duke was strengthened by mutual obligations, and through\nhis means they became friends with the Genoese, the old differences with\nthem respecting reprisals, and other small matters of dispute, being\ncomposed, although the Venetians used every possible means to prevent\nit, and entreated the emperor of Constantinople to expel all Florentines\nfrom his dominions; so fierce was the animosity with which they entered\non this war, and so powerful their lust of dominion, that without the\nleast hesitation they sought the destruction of those who had been the\noccasion of their own power. The emperor, however, refused to listen to\nthem. The Venetian senate forbade the Florentine ambassadors to enter\ntheir territories, alleging, that being in league with the king, they\ncould not entertain them without his concurrence. The Siennese received\nthe ambassadors with fair words, fearing their own ruin before the\nLeague could assist them, and therefore endeavored to appease the powers\nwhose attack they were unable to resist. The Venetians and the king (as\nwas then conjectured) were disposed to send ambassadors to Florence to\njustify the war. But the Venetian envoy was not allowed to enter the\nFlorentine dominions, and the king's ambassador, being unwilling to\nperform his office alone, the embassy was not completed; and thus\nthe Venetians learned, that however little they might esteem the\nFlorentines, the latter had still less respect for them.\nIn the midst of these fears, the emperor, Frederick III., came into\nItaly to be crowned. On the thirtieth of January, 1451, he entered\nFlorence with fifteen hundred horse, and was most honorably received\nby the Signory. He remained in the city till the sixth of February, and\nthen proceeded to Rome for his coronation, where, having been solemnly\nconsecrated, and his marriage celebrated with the empress, who had\ncome to Rome by sea, he returned to Germany, and again passed through\nFlorence in May, with the same honors as upon his arrival. On his\nreturn, having derived some benefits from the marquis of Mantua, he\nconceded to him Modena and Reggio. In the meantime, the Florentines did\nnot fail to prepare themselves for immediate war; and to augment their\ninfluence, and strike the enemy with terror, they, in conjunction with\nthe duke, entered into alliance with the king of France for the mutual\ndefense of their states. This treaty was published with great pomp\nthroughout all Italy.\nThe month of May, 1452, having arrived, the Venetians thought it not\ndesirable to defer any longer their attack upon the duke, and with\nsixteen thousand horse and six thousand foot assailed his territories\nin the direction of Lodi, while the marquis of Montferrat, instigated\neither by his own ambition or the entreaties of the Venetians, did the\nsame on the side of Alexandria. The duke assembled a force of eighteen\nthousand cavalry and three thousand infantry, garrisoned Alexandria and\nLodi, and all the other places where the enemy might annoy them. He then\nattacked the Brescian territory, and greatly harassed the Venetians;\nwhile both parties alike plundered the country and ravaged the smaller\ntowns. Having defeated the marquis of Montferrat at Alexandria, the duke\nwas able to unite his whole force against the Venetians and invade their\nterritory.\nWhile the war in Lombardy proceeded thus, giving rise to various\ntrifling incidents unworthy of recital, King Alfonso and the Florentines\ncarried on hostilities in Tuscany, but in a similarly inefficient\nmanner, evincing no greater talent, and incurring no greater danger.\nFerrando, the illegitimate son of Alfonso, entered the country with\ntwelve thousand troops, under the command of Federigo, lord of Urbino.\nTheir first attempt was to attack Fojano, in the Val di Chiane;\nfor, having the Siennese in their favor, they entered the Florentine\nterritory in that direction. The walls of the castle were weak, and it\nwas small, and consequently poorly manned, but the garrison were, among\nthe soldiers of that period, considered brave and faithful. Two hundred\ninfantry were also sent by the Signory for its defense. Before this\ncastle, thus provided, Ferrando sat down, and either from the valor of\nits defenders or his own deficiencies, thirty-six days elapsed before\nhe took it. This interval enabled the city to make better provision\nfor places of greater importance, to collect forces and conclude more\neffective arrangements than had hitherto been made. The enemy next\nproceeded into the district of Chiane, where they attacked two small\ntowns, the property of private citizens, but could not capture them.\nThey then encamped before the Castellina, a fortress upon the borders\nof the Chianti, within ten miles of Sienna, weak from its defective\nconstruction, and still more so by its situation; but, notwithstanding\nthese defects, the assailants were compelled to retire in disgrace,\nafter having lain before it forty-four days. So formidable were those\narmies, and so perilous those wars, that places now abandoned as\nuntenable were then defended as impregnable.\nWhile Ferrando was encamped in the Chianti he made many incursions, and\ntook considerable booty from the Florentine territories, extending his\ndepredations within six miles of the city, to the great alarm and injury\nof the people, who at this time, having sent their forces to the\nnumber of eight thousand soldiers under Astorre da Faenza and Gismondo\nMalatesti toward Castel di Colle, kept them at a distance from the\nenemy, lest they should be compelled to an engagement; for they\nconsidered that so long as they were not beaten in a pitched battle,\nthey could not be vanquished in the war generally; for small castles,\nwhen lost, were recovered at the peace, and larger places were in no\ndanger, because the enemy would not venture to attack them. The king\nhad also a fleet of about twenty vessels, comprising galleys and smaller\ncraft, which lay off Pisa, and during the siege of Castellina were\nmoored near the Rocca di Vada, which, from the negligence of the\ngovernor, he took, and then harassed the surrounding country. However,\nthis annoyance was easily removed by a few soldiers sent by the\nFlorentines to Campiglia, and who confined the enemy to the coast.\nCHAPTER VI\nConspiracy of Stefano Porcari against the papal government--The\nconspirators discovered and punished--The Florentines recover the places\nthey had lost--Gherardo Gambacorti, lord of Val di Bagno, endeavors\nto transfer his territories to the king of Naples--Gallant conduct of\nAntonio Gualandi, who counteracts the design of Gambacorti--Ren\u00e9\nof Anjou is called into Italy by the Florentines--Ren\u00e9 returns to\nFrance--The pope endeavors to restore peace--Peace proclaimed--Jacopo\nPiccinino attacks the Siennese.\nThe pontiff did not interfere in these affairs further than to endeavor\nto bring the parties to a mutual accommodation; but while he refrained\nfrom external wars he incurred the danger of more serious troubles at\nhome. Stefano Porcari was a Roman citizen, equally distinguished\nfor nobility of birth and extent of learning, but still more by the\nexcellence of his character. Like all who are in pursuit of glory, he\nresolved either to perform or to attempt something worthy of memory, and\nthought he could not do better than deliver his country from the hands\nof the prelates, and restore the ancient form of government; hoping, in\nthe event of success, to be considered a new founder or second father of\nthe city. The dissolute manners of the priesthood, and the discontent\nof the Roman barons and people, encouraged him to look for a happy\ntermination of his enterprise; but he derived his greatest confidence\nfrom those verses of Petrarch in the canzone which begins, \"Spirto\ngentil che quelle membra reggi,\" where he says,--\n\"Sopra il Monte Tarpejo canzon vedra, Un cavalier, ch' Italia tutta\nonora, Pensoso piu d'altrui, che di se stesso.\"\nStefano, believing poets are sometimes endowed with a divine and\nprophetic spirit, thought the event must take place which Petrarch in\nthis canzone seemed to foretell, and that he was destined to effect the\nglorious task; considering himself in learning, eloquence, friends, and\ninfluence, superior to any other citizen of Rome. Having taken these\nimpressions, he had not sufficient prudence to avoid discovering his\ndesign by his discourse, demeanor, and mode of living; so that the pope\nbecoming acquainted with it, in order to prevent the commission of some\nrash act, banished him to Bologna and charged the governor of the city\nto compel his appearance before him once every day. Stefano was\nnot daunted by this first check, but with even greater earnestness\nprosecuted his undertaking, and, by such means as were available, more\ncautiously corresponded with his friends, and often went and returned\nfrom Rome with such celerity as to be in time to present himself\nbefore the governor within the limit allowed for his appearance. Having\nacquired a sufficient number of partisans, he determined to make the\nattempt without further delay, and arranged with his friends at Rome to\nprovide an evening banquet, to which all the conspirators were invited,\nwith orders that each should bring with him his most trust-worthy\nfriends, and himself promised to be with him before the entertainment\nwas served. Everything was done according to this orders, and Stefano\nPorcari arrived at the place appointed. Supper being brought in, he\nentered the apartment dressed in cloth of gold, with rich ornaments\nabout his neck, to give him a dignified appearance and commanding\naspect. Having embraced the company, he delivered a long oration to\ndispose their minds to the glorious undertaking. He then arranged the\nmeasures to be adopted, ordering that one part of them should, on the\nfollowing morning, take possession of the pontiff's palace, and that\nthe other should call the people of Rome to arms. The affair came to the\nknowledge of the pope the same night, some say by treachery among the\nconspirators, and others that he knew of Porcari's presence at Rome. Be\nthis as it may, on the night of the supper Stefano, and the greater part\nof his associates, were arrested, and afterward expiated their crime\nby death. Thus ended his enterprise; and though some may applaud his\nintentions, he must stand charged with deficiency of understanding; for\nsuch undertakings, though possessing some slight appearance of glory,\nare almost always attended with ruin.\nGherardo Gambacorti was lord of Val di Bagno, and his ancestors as well\nas himself had always been in the pay or under the protection of the\nFlorentines. Alfonso endeavored to induce him to exchange his territory\nfor another in the kingdom of Naples. This became known to the\nSignory, who, in order to ascertain his designs, sent an ambassador\nto Gambacorti, to remind him of the obligations of his ancestors and\nhimself to their republic, and induce him to continue faithful to them.\nGherardo affected the greatest astonishment, assured the ambassador with\nsolemn oaths that no such treacherous thought had ever entered his mind,\nand that he would gladly go to Florence and pledge himself for the truth\nof his assertions; but being unable, from indisposition, he would send\nhis son as an hostage. These assurances, and the proposal with which\nthey were accompanied, induced the Florentines to think Gherardo had\nbeen slandered, and that his accuser must be alike weak and treacherous.\nGherardo, however, hastened his negotiation with redoubled zeal, and\nhaving arranged the terms, Alfonso sent Frate Puccio, a knight of\nJerusalem, with a strong body of men to the Val di Bagno, to take\npossession of the fortresses and towns, the people of which, being\nattached to the Florentine republic, submitted unwillingly.\nFrate Puccio had already taken possession of nearly the whole territory,\nexcept the fortress of Corzano. Gambacorti was accompanied, while\ntransferring his dominions, by a young Pisan of great courage and\naddress, named Antonio Gualandi, who, considering the whole affair, the\nstrength of the place, the well known bravery of the garrison, their\nevident reluctance to give it up, and the baseness of Gambacorti,\nat once resolved to make an effort to prevent the fulfillment of\nhis design; and Gherardo being at the entrance, for the purpose of\nintroducing the Aragonese, he pushed him out with both his hands, and\ncommanded the guards to shut the gate upon such a scoundrel, and hold\nthe fortress for the Florentine republic. When this circumstance became\nknown in Bagno and the neighboring places, the inhabitants took up arms\nagainst the king's forces, and, raising the Florentine standard, drove\nthem out. The Florentines learning these events, imprisoned Gherardo's\nson, and sent troops to Bagno for the defense of the territory, which\nhaving hitherto been governed by its own prince, now became a vicariate.\nThe traitor Gherardo escaped with difficulty, leaving his wife, family,\nand all his property, in the hands of those whom he had endeavored\nto betray. This affair was considered by the Florentines of great\nimportance; for had the king succeeded in securing the territory, he\nmight have overrun the Val di Tavere and the Casentino at his pleasure,\nand would have caused so much annoyance, that they could no longer have\nallowed their whole force to act against the army of the Aragonese at\nSienna.\nIn addition to the preparations made by the Florentines in Italy to\nresist the hostile League, they sent as ambassador, Agnolo Acciajuoli,\nto request that the king of France would allow Ren\u00e9 of Anjou to enter\nItaly in favor of the duke and themselves, and also, that by his\npresence in the country, he might defend his friends and attempt the\nrecovery of the kingdom of Naples; for which purpose they offered him\nassistance in men and money. While the war was proceeding in Lombardy\nand Tuscany, the ambassador effected an arrangement with King Ren\u00e9,\nwho promised to come into Italy during the month of June, the League\nengaging to pay him thirty thousand florins upon his arrival at\nAlexandria, and ten thousand per month during the continuance of the\nwar. In pursuance of this treaty, King Ren\u00e9 commenced his march\ninto Italy, but was stopped by the duke of Savoy and the marquis of\nMontferrat, who, being in alliance with the Venetians, would not allow\nhim to pass. The Florentine ambassador advised, that in order to uphold\nthe influence of his friends, he should return to Provence, and conduct\npart of his forces into Italy by sea, and, in the meantime, endeavor,\nby the authority of the king of France, to obtain a passage for the\nremainder through the territories of the duke. This plan was completely\nsuccessful; for Ren\u00e9 came into Italy by sea, and his forces, by the\nmediation of the king of France, were allowed a passage through Savoy.\nKing Ren\u00e9 was most honorably received by Duke Francesco, and joining his\nFrench with the Italian forces, they attacked the Venetians with so much\nimpetuosity, that they shortly recovered all the places which had been\ntaken in the Cremonese. Not content with this, they occupied nearly\nthe whole Brescian territory; so that the Venetians, unable to keep the\nfield, withdrew close to the walls of Brescia.\nWinter coming on, the duke deemed it advisable to retire into quarters,\nand appointed Piacenza for the forces of Ren\u00e9, where, having passed the\nwhole of the cold season of 1453, without attempting anything, the duke\nthought of taking the field, on the approach of spring, and stripping\nthe Venetians of the remainder of their possessions by land, but was\ninformed by the king that he was obliged of necessity to return to\nFrance. This determination was quite new and unexpected to the duke,\nand caused him the utmost concern; but though he immediately went to\ndissuade Ren\u00e9 from carrying it into effect, he was unable either by\npromises or entreaties to divert him from his purpose. He engaged,\nhowever, to leave part of his forces, and send his son for the service\nof the League. The Florentines were not displeased at this; for having\nrecovered their territories and castles, they were no longer in fear of\nAlfonso, and on the other hand, they did not wish the duke to obtain any\npart of Lombardy but what belonged to him. Ren\u00e9 took his departure,\nand send his son John into Italy, according to his promise, who did not\nremain in Lombardy, but came direct to Florence, where he was received\nwith the highest respect.\nThe king's departure made the duke desirous of peace. The Venetians,\nAlfonso, and the Florentines, being all weary of the war, were similarly\ndisposed; and the pope continued to wish it as much as ever; for during\nthis year the Turkish emperor, Mohammed, had taken Constantinople and\nsubdued the whole of Greece. This conquest alarmed the Christians, more\nespecially the Venetians and the pope, who already began to fancy\nthe Mohammedans at their doors. The pope therefore begged the Italian\npotentates to send ambassadors to himself, with authority to negotiate\na general peace, with which all complied; but when the particular\ncircumstances of each case came to be considered, many difficulties were\nfound in the war of effecting it. King Alfonso required the Florentines\nto reimburse the expenses he had incurred in the war, and the\nFlorentines demanded some compensation from him. The Venetians thought\nthemselves entitled to Cremona from the duke; while he insisted upon the\nrestoration of Bergamo, Brescia, and Crema; so that it seemed impossible\nto reconcile such conflicting claims. But what could not be effected\nby a number at Rome was easily managed at Milan and Venice by two;\nfor while the matter was under discussion at Rome, the duke and the\nVenetians came to an arrangement on the ninth of April, 1454, by virtue\nof which, each party resumed what they possessed before the war, the\nduke being allowed to recover from the princes of Montferrat and Savoy\nthe places they had taken. To the other Italian powers a month was\nallowed to ratify the treaty. The pope and the Florentines, and with\nthem the Siennese and other minor powers, acceded to it within the time.\nBesides this, the Florentines, the Venetians, and the duke concluded\na treaty of peace for twenty-five years. King Alfonso alone exhibited\ndissatisfaction at what had taken place, thinking he had not been\nsufficiently considered, that he stood, not on the footing of a\nprincipal, but only ranked as an auxiliary, and therefore kept aloof,\nand would not disclose his intentions. However, after receiving a legate\nfrom the pope, and many solemn embassies from other powers, he allowed\nhimself to be persuaded, principally by means of the pontiff, and with\nhis son joined the League for thirty years. The duke and the king also\ncontracted a twofold relationship and double marriage, each giving a\ndaughter to a son of the other. Notwithstanding this, that Italy might\nstill retain the seeds of war, Alfonso would not consent to the peace,\nunless the League would allow him, without injury to themselves, to make\nwar upon the Genoese, Gismondo Malatesti, and Astorre, prince of Faenza.\nThis being conceded, his son Ferrando, who was at Sienna, returned to\nthe kingdom, having by his coming into Tuscany acquired no dominion and\nlost a great number of his men.\nUpon the establishment of a general peace, the only apprehension\nentertained was, that it would be disturbed by the animosity of Alfonso\nagainst the Genoese; yet it happened otherwise. The king, indeed, did\nnot openly infringe the peace, but it was frequently broken by the\nambition of the mercenary troops. The Venetians, as usual on the\nconclusion of a war, had discharged Jacopo Piccinino, who with some\nother unemployed condottieri, marched into Romagna, thence into the\nSiennese, and halting in the country, took possession of many places.\nAt the commencement of these disturbances, and the beginning of the year\n1455, Pope Nicholas died, and was succeeded by Calixtus III., who, to\nput a stop to the war newly broken out so near home, immediately sent\nGiovanni Ventimiglia, his general, with what forces he could furnish.\nThese being joined by the troops of the Florentines and the duke of\nMilan, both of whom furnished assistance, attacked Jacopo, near Bolsena,\nand though Ventimiglia was taken prisoner, yet Jacopo was worsted, and\nretreated in disorder to Castiglione della Pescaia, where, had he\nnot been assisted by Alfonso, his force would have been completely\nannihilated. This made it evident that Jacopo's movement had been\nmade by order of Alfonso, and the latter, as if palpably detected, to\nconciliate his allies, after having almost alienated them with this\nunimportant war, ordered Jacopo to restore to the Siennese the places he\nhad taken, and they gave him twenty thousand florins by way of ransom,\nafter which he and his forces were received into the kingdom of Naples.\nCHAPTER VII\nChristendom alarmed by the progress of the Turks--The Turks routed\nbefore Belgrade--Description of a remarkable hurricane--War against\nthe Genoese and Gismondo Malatesti--Genoa submits to the king\nof France--Death of Alfonso king of Naples--Succeeded by his son\nFerrando--The pope designs to give the kingdom of Naples to his nephew\nPiero Lodovico Borgia--Eulogy of Pius II.--Disturbances in Genoa between\nJohn of Anjou and the Fregosi--The Fregosi subdued--John attacks\nthe kingdom of Naples--Ferrando king of Naples routed--Ferrando\nreinstated--The Genoese cast off the French yoke--John of Anjou routed\nin the kingdom of Naples.\nThe pope, though anxious to restrain Jacopo Piccinino, did not neglect\nto make provision for the defense of Christendom, which seemed in danger\nfrom the Turks. He sent ambassadors and preachers into every Christian\ncountry, to exhort princes and people to arm in defense of their\nreligion, and with their persons and property to contribute to the\nenterprise against the common enemy. In Florence, large sums were\nraised, and many citizens bore the mark of a red cross upon their dress\nto intimate their readiness to become soldiers of the faith. Solemn\nprocessions were made, and nothing was neglected either in public or\nprivate, to show their willingness to be among the most forward to\nassist the enterprise with money, counsel, or men. But the eagerness\nfor this crusade was somewhat abated, by learning that the Turkish army,\nbeing at the siege of Belgrade, a strong city and fortress in Hungary,\nupon the banks of the Danube, had been routed and the emperor wounded;\nso that the alarm felt by the pope and all Christendom, on the loss\nof Constantinople, having ceased to operate, they proceeded with\ndeliberately with their preparations for war; and in Hungary their\nzeal was cooled through the death of Giovanni Corvini the Waiwode, who\ncommanded the Hungarian forces on that memorable occasion, and fell in\nthe battle.\nTo return to the affairs of Italy. In the year 1456, the disturbances\noccasioned by Jacopo Piccinino having subsided, and human weapons\nlaid aside, the heavens seemed to make war against the earth; dreadful\ntempestuous winds then occurring, which produced effects unprecedented\nin Tuscany, and which to posterity will appear marvelous and\nunaccountable. On the twenty-fourth of August, about an hour before\ndaybreak, there arose from the Adriatic near Ancona, a whirlwind, which\ncrossing from east to west, again reached the sea near Pisa, accompanied\nby thick clouds, and the most intense and impenetrable darkness,\ncovering a breadth of about two miles in the direction of its course.\nUnder some natural or supernatural influence, this vast and overcharged\nvolume of condensed vapor burst; its fragments contended with\nindescribable fury, and huge bodies sometimes ascending toward heaven,\nand sometimes precipitated upon the earth, struggled, as it were,\nin mutual conflict, whirling in circles with intense velocity, and\naccompanied by winds, impetuous beyond all conception; while flashes of\nawful brilliancy, and murky, lurid flames incessantly broke forth.\nFrom these confused clouds, furious winds, and momentary fires, sounds\nissued, of which no earthquake or thunder ever heard could afford the\nleast idea; striking such awe into all, that it was thought the end\nof the world had arrived, that the earth, waters, heavens, and entire\nuniverse, mingling together, were being resolved into their ancient\nchaos. Wherever this awful tempest passed, it produced unprecedented and\nmarvelous effects; but these were more especially experienced near the\ncastle of St. Casciano, about eight miles from Florence, upon the hill\nwhich separates the valleys of Pisa and Grieve. Between this castle and\nthe Borgo St. Andrea, upon the same hill, the tempest passed without\ntouching the latter, and in the former, only threw down some of the\nbattlements and the chimneys of a few houses; but in the space between\nthem, it leveled many buildings quite to the ground. The roofs of the\nchurches of St. Martin, at Bagnolo, and Santa Maria della Pace, were\ncarried more than a mile, unbroken as when upon their respective\nedifices. A muleteer and his beasts were driven from the road into the\nadjoining valley, and found dead. All the large oaks and lofty trees\nwhich could not bend beneath its influence, were not only stripped of\ntheir branches but borne to a great distance from the places where\nthey grew, and when the tempest had passed over and daylight made the\ndesolation visible, the inhabitants were transfixed with dismay. The\ncountry had lost all its habitable character; churches and dwellings\nwere laid in heaps; nothing was heard but the lamentations of those\nwhose possessions had perished, or whose cattle or friends were buried\nbeneath the ruins; and all who witnessed the scene were filled with\nanguish or compassion. It was doubtless the design of the Omnipotent,\nrather to threaten Tuscany than to chastise her; for had the hurricane\nbeen directed over the city, filled with houses and inhabitants,\ninstead of proceeding among oaks and elms, or small and thinly scattered\ndwellings, it would have been such a scourge as the mind, with all its\nideas of horror, could not have conceived. But the Almighty desired\nthat this slight example should suffice to recall the minds of men to a\nknowledge of himself and of his power.\nTo return to our history. King Alfonso was dissatisfied with the peace,\nand as the war which he had unnecessarily caused Jacopo Piccinino to\nmake against the Siennese, had produced no important result, he resolved\nto try what could be done against those whom the conditions of the\nLeague permitted him to attack. He therefore, in the year 1456, assailed\nthe Genoese, both by sea and by land, designing to deprive the Fregosi\nof the government and restore the Adorni. At the same time, he ordered\nJacopo Piccinino to cross the Tronto, and attack Gismondo Malatesti,\nwho, having fortified his territories, did not concern himself, and this\npart of the king's enterprise produced no effect; but his proceedings\nagainst Genoa occasioned more wars against himself and his kingdom than\nhe could have wished. Piero Fregoso was then doge of Genoa, and doubting\nhis ability to sustain the attack of the king, he determined to give\nwhat he could not hold, to some one who might defend it against his\nenemies, in hope, that at a future period, he should obtain a return for\nthe benefit conferred. He therefore sent ambassadors to Charles VII. of\nFrance, and offered him the government of Genoa. Charles accepted the\noffer, and sent John of Anjou, the son of King Ren\u00e9, who had a short\ntime previously left Florence and returned to France, to take possession\nwith the idea, that he, having learned the manners and customs of Italy,\nwould be able to govern the city; and also that this might give him an\nopportunity of undertaking the conquest of Naples, of which Ren\u00e9, John's\nfather, had been deprived by Alfonso. John, therefore, proceeded to\nGenoa, where he was received as prince, and the fortresses, both of the\ncity and the government, given up to him. This annoyed Alfonso, with the\nfear that he had brought upon himself too powerful an enemy. He was not,\nhowever, dismayed; but pursued his enterprise vigorously, and had led\nhis fleet to Porto, below Villamarina, when he died after a sudden\nillness, and thus John and the Genoese were relieved from the war.\nFerrando, who succeeded to the kingdom of his father Alfonso, became\nalarmed at having so powerful an enemy in Italy, and was doubtful of\nthe disposition of many of his barons, who being desirous of change, he\nfeared would take part with the French. He was also apprehensive of\nthe pope, whose ambition he well knew, and who seeing him new in the\ngovernment, might design to take it from him. He had no hope except\nfrom the duke of Milan, who entertained no less anxiety concerning the\naffairs of the kingdom than Ferrando; for he feared that if the French\nwere to obtain it, they would endeavor to annex his own dominions; which\nhe knew they considered to be rightfully their own. He, therefore, soon\nafter the death of Alfonso, sent letters and forces to Ferrando; the\nlatter to give him aid and influence, the former to encourage him with\nan intimation that he would not, under any circumstances, forsake him.\nThe pontiff intended, after the death of Alfonso, to give the kingdom\nof Naples to his nephew Piero Lodovico Borgia, and, to furnish a decent\npretext for his design and obtain the concurrence of the powers of Italy\nin its favor he signified a wish to restore that realm to the dominion\nof the church of Rome; and therefore persuaded the duke not to assist\nFerrando. But in the midst of these views and opening enterprises,\nCalixtus died, and Pius II. of Siennese origin, of the family of the\nPiccolomini, and by name \u00c6neas, succeeded to the pontificate. This\npontiff, free from the ties of private interest, having no object but to\nbenefit Christendom and honor the church, at the duke's entreaty crowned\nFerrando king of Naples; judging it easier to establish peace if the\nkingdom remained in the hands which at present held it, than if he were\nto favor the views of the French, or, as Calixtus purposed, take it for\nhimself. Ferrando, in acknowledgment of the benefit, created Antonio,\none of the pope's nephews, prince of Malfi, gave him an illegitimate\ndaughter of his own in marriage, and restored Benevento and Terracina to\nthe church.\nIt thus appeared that the internal dissensions of Italy might be\nquelled, and the pontiff prepared to induce the powers of Christendom\nto unite in an enterprise against the Turks (as Calixtus had previously\ndesigned) when differences arose between the Fregosi and John of Anjou,\nthe lord of Genoa, which occasioned greater and more important wars than\nthose recently concluded. Pietrino Fregoso was at his castle of Riviera,\nand thought he had not been rewarded by John in proportion to his\nfamily's merits; for it was by their means the latter had become prince\nof the city. This impression drove the parties into open enmity; a\ncircumstance gratifying to Ferrando, who saw in it relief from his\ntroubles, and the sole means of procuring his safety: he therefore\nassisted Pietrino with money and men, trusting to drive John out of the\nGenoese territory. The latter being aware of his design, sent for aid\nto France; and, on obtaining it, attacked Pietrino, who, through his\nnumerous friends, entertained the strongest assurance of success; so\nthat John was compelled to keep within the city, into which Pietrino\nhaving entered by night, took possession of some parts of it; but upon\nthe return of day, his people were all either slain or made prisoners by\nJohn's troops, and he himself was found among the dead.\nThis victory gave John hopes of recovering the kingdom; and in October,\n1459, he sailed thither from Genoa, with a powerful fleet, and landed\nat Baia; whence he proceeded to Sessa, by the duke of which place he was\nfavorably received. The prince of Taranto, the Aquilani, with several\ncities and other princes, also joined him; so that a great part of the\nkingdom fell into his hands. On this Ferrando applied for assistance\nto the pope and the duke of Milan; and, to diminish the number of his\nenemies, made peace with Gismondo Malatesti, which gave so much offense\nto Jacopo Piccinino, the hereditary enemy of Gismondo, that he resigned\nhis command under Ferrando, and joined his rival. Ferrando also sent\nmoney to Federigo, lord of Urbino, and collected with all possible speed\nwhat was in those times considered a tolerable army; which, meeting the\nenemy upon the river Sarni, an engagement ensued in which Ferrando was\nrouted, and many of his principal officers taken. After this defeat, the\ncity of Naples alone, with a few smaller places and princes of inferior\nnote, adhered to Ferrando, the greater part having submitted to John.\nJacopo Piccinino, after the victory, advised an immediate march upon\nNaples; but John declined this, saying, he would first reduce the\nremainder of the kingdom, and then attack the seat of government. This\nresolution occasioned the failure of his enterprise; for he did not\nconsider how much more easily the members follow the head than the head\nthe members.\nAfter his defeat, Ferrando took refuge in Naples, whither the scattered\nremnants of his people followed him; and by soliciting his friends, he\nobtained money and a small force. He sent again for assistance to the\npope and the duke, by both of whom he was supplied more liberally\nand speedily than before; for they began to entertain most serious\napprehensions of his losing the kingdom. His hopes were thus revived;\nand, marching from Naples, he regained his reputation in his dominions,\nand soon obtained the places of which he had been deprived. While the\nwar was proceeding in the kingdom, a circumstance occurred by which\nJohn of Anjou lost his influence, and all chance of success in\nthe enterprise. The Genoese had become so weary of the haughty and\navaricious dominion of the French, that they took arms against the\nviceroy, and compelled him to seek refuge in the castelletto; the\nFregosi and the Adorni united in the enterprise against him, and were\nassisted with money and troops by the duke of Milan, both for the\nrecovery and preservation of the government. At the same time, King Ren\u00e9\ncoming with a fleet to the assistance of his son, and hoping to recover\nGenoa by means of the castelletto, upon landing his forces was so\ncompletely routed, that he was compelled to return in disgrace to\nProvence. When the news of his father's defeat reached Naples, John was\ngreatly alarmed, but continued the war for a time by the assistance of\nthose barons who, being rebels, knew they would obtain no terms from\nFerrando. At length, after various trifling occurrences, the two royal\narmies came to an engagement, in which John was routed near Troia, in\nthe year 1463. He was, however, less injured by his defeat than by the\ndesertion of Jacopo Piccinino, who joined Ferrando; and, being abandoned\nby his troops, he was compelled to take refuge in Istria, and thence\nwithdrew to France. This war continued four years. John's failure was\nattributable to negligence; for victory was often within his grasp,\nbut he did not take proper means to secure it. The Florentines took no\ndecisive part in this war. John, king of Aragon, who succeeded upon the\ndeath of Alfonso, sent ambassadors to request their assistance for his\nnephew Ferrando, in compliance with the terms of the treaty recently\nmade with his father Alfonso. The Florentines replied, that they were\nunder no obligation; that they did not think proper to assist the son\nin a war commenced by the father with his own forces; and that as it was\nbegun without either their counsel or knowledge, it must be continued\nand concluded without their help. The ambassadors affirmed the\nengagement to be binding on the Florentines, and themselves to be\nanswerable for the event of the war; and then in great anger left the\ncity.\nThus with regard to external affairs, the Florentines continued\ntranquil during this war; but the case was otherwise with their domestic\nconcerns, as will be particularly shown in the following book.\nBOOK VII\nCHAPTER I\nConnection of the other Italian governments with the history of\nFlorence--Republics always disunited--Some differences are injurious;\nothers not so--The kind of dissensions prevailing at Florence--Cosmo de'\nMedici and Neri Capponi become powerful by dissimilar means--Reform\nin the election of magistrates favorable to Cosmo--Complaints of\nthe principal citizens against the reform in elections--Luca Pitti,\nGonfalonier of Justice, restrains the imborsations by force--Tyranny and\npride of Luca Pitti and his party--Palace of the Pitti--Death of\nCosmo de' Medici--His liberality and magnificence--His modesty--His\nprudence--Sayings of Cosmo.\nIt will perhaps appear to the readers of the preceding book that,\nprofessing only to write of the affairs of Florence, I have dilated too\nmuch in speaking of those which occurred in Lombardy and Naples. But\nas I have not already avoided, so it is not my intention in future to\nforbear, similar digressions. For although we have not engaged to\ngive an account of the affairs of Italy, still it would be improper\nto neglect noticing the most remarkable of them. If they were wholly\nomitted, our history would not be so well understood, neither would it\nbe so instructive or agreeable; since from the proceedings of the other\nprinces and states of Italy, have most commonly arisen those wars in\nwhich the Florentines were compelled to take part. Thus, from the\nwar between John of Anjou and King Ferrando, originated those serious\nenmities and hatreds which ensued between Ferrando and the Florentines,\nparticularly the house of Medici. The king complained of a want of\nassistance during the war, and of the aid afforded to his enemy; and\nfrom his anger originated the greatest evils, as will be hereafter seen.\nHaving, in speaking of external affairs, come down to the year 1463, it\nwill be necessary in order to make our narrative of the contemporaneous\ndomestic transactions clearly understood, to revert to a period several\nyears back. But first, according to custom, I would offer a few remarks\nreferring to the events about to be narrated, and observe, that those\nwho think a republic may be kept in perfect unity of purpose are greatly\ndeceived. True it is, that some divisions injure republics, while others\nare beneficial to them. When accompanied by factions and parties they\nare injurious; but when maintained without them they contribute to their\nprosperity. The legislator of a republic, since it is impossible to\nprevent the existence of dissensions, must at least take care to prevent\nthe growth of faction. It may therefore be observed, that citizens\nacquire reputation and power in two ways; the one public, the other\nprivate. Influence is acquired publicly by winning a battle, taking\npossession of a territory, fulfilling the duties of an embassy with\ncare and prudence, or by giving wise counsel attended by a happy result.\nPrivate methods are conferring benefits upon individuals, defending them\nagainst the magistrates, supporting them with money, and raising them to\nundeserved honors; or with public games and entertainments gaining the\naffection of the populace. This mode of procedure produces parties and\ncliques; and in proportion as influence thus acquired is injurious, so\nis the former beneficial, if quite free from party spirit; because it is\nfounded upon the public good, and not upon private advantage. And though\nit is impossible to prevent the existence of inveterate feuds, still\nif they be without partisans to support them for their own individual\nbenefit, they do not injure a republic, but contribute to its welfare;\nsince none can attain distinction, but as he contributes to her good,\nand each party prevents the other from infringing her liberties. The\ndissensions of Florence were always accompanied by factions, and were\ntherefore always pernicious; and the dominant party only remained united\nso long as its enemies held it in check. As soon as the strength of the\nopposition was annihilated, the government, deprived of the restraining\ninfluence of its adversaries, and being subject to no law, fell to\npieces. The party of Cosmo de' Medici gained the ascendant in 1434; but\nthe depressed party being very numerous, and composed of several very\ninfluential persons, fear kept the former united, and restrained their\nproceedings within the bounds of moderation, so that no violence was\ncommitted by them, nor anything done calculated to excite popular\ndislike. Consequently, whenever this government required the citizens'\naid to recover or strengthen its influence, the latter were always\nwilling to gratify its wishes; so that from 1434 to 1455, during a\nperiod of twenty-one years, the authority of a balia was granted to it\nsix times.\nThere were in Florence, as we have frequently observed, two principally\npowerful citizens, Cosmo de' Medici and Neri Capponi. Neri acquired\nhis influence by public services; so that he had many friends but few\npartisans. Cosmo, being able to avail himself both of public and private\nmeans, had many partisans as well as friends. While both lived,\nhaving always been united, they obtained from the people whatever they\nrequired; for in them popularity and power were united. But in the year\n1455, Neri being dead, and the opposition party extinct, the government\nfound a difficulty in resuming its authority; and this was occasioned,\nremarkably enough, by Cosmo's private friends, and the most influential\nmen in the state; for, not fearing the opposite party, they became\nanxious to abate his power. This inconsistency was the beginning of\nthe evils which took place in 1456; so that those in power were openly\nadvised in the deliberative councils not to renew the power of the\nbalia, but to close the balloting purses, and appoint the magistrates by\ndrawing from the pollings or squittini previously made. To restrain this\ndisposition, Cosmo had the choice of two alternatives, either forcibly\nto assume the government, with the partisans he possessed, and drive\nout the others, or to allow the matter to take its course, and let his\nfriends see they were not depriving him of power, but rather themselves.\nHe chose the latter; for he well knew that at all events the purses\nbeing filled with the names of his own friends, he incurred no risk, and\ncould take the government into his own hands whenever he found occasion.\nThe chief offices of state being again filled by lot, the mass of the\npeople began to think they had recovered their liberty, and that the\ndecisions of the magistrates were according to their own judgments,\nunbiased by the influence of the Great. At the same time, the friends\nof different grandees were humbled; and many who had commonly seen their\nhouses filled with suitors and presents, found themselves destitute of\nboth. Those who had previously been very powerful were reduced to an\nequality with men whom they had been accustomed to consider inferior;\nand those formerly far beneath them were now become their equals. No\nrespect or deference was paid to them; they were often ridiculed and\nderided, and frequently heard themselves and the republic mentioned in\nthe open streets without the least deference; thus they found it was not\nCosmo but themselves that had lost the government. Cosmo appeared not to\nnotice these matters; and whenever any subject was proposed in favor\nof the people he was the first to support it. But the greatest cause\nof alarm to the higher classes, and his most favorable opportunity of\nretaliation, was the revival of the catasto, or property-tax of 1427, so\nthat individual contributions were determined by statute, and not by a\nset of persons appointed for its regulation.\nThis law being re-established, and a magistracy created to carry it into\neffect, the nobility assembled, and went to Cosmo to beg he would rescue\nthem and himself from the power of the plebeians, and restore to the\ngovernment the reputation which had made himself powerful and them\nrespected. He replied, he was willing to comply with their request, but\nwished the law to be obtained in the regular manner, by consent of the\npeople, and not by force, of which he would not hear on any account.\nThey then endeavored in the councils to establish a new balia, but did\nnot succeed. On this the grandees again came to Cosmo, and most humbly\nbegged he would assemble the people in a general council or parliament,\nbut this he refused, for he wished to make them sensible of their great\nmistake; and when Donato Cocchi, being Gonfalonier of Justice, proposed\nto assemble them without his consent, the Signors who were of Cosmo's\nparty ridiculed the idea so unmercifully, that the man's mind actually\nbecame deranged, and he had to retire from office in consequence.\nHowever, since it is undesirable to allow matters to proceed beyond\nrecovery, the Gonfalon of Justice being in the hands of Luca Pitti,\na bold-spirited man, Cosmo determined to let him adopt what course he\nthought proper, that if any trouble should arise it might be imputed\nto Luca and not to himself. Luca, therefore, in the beginning of his\nmagistracy, several times proposed to the people the appointment of\na new balia; and, not succeeding, he threatened the members of the\ncouncils with injurious and arrogant expressions, which were shortly\nfollowed by corresponding conduct; for in the month of August, 1458, on\nthe eve of Saint Lorenzo, having filled the piazza, and compelled\nthem to assent to a measure to which he knew them to be averse. Having\nrecovered power, created a new balia, and filled the principal offices\naccording to the pleasure of a few individuals, in order to commence\nthat government with terror which they had obtained by force, they\nbanished Girolamo Machiavelli, with some others, and deprived many of\nthe honors of government. Girolamo, having transgressed the confines to\nwhich he was limited, was declared a rebel. Traveling about Italy, with\nthe design of exciting the princes against his country, he was betrayed\nwhile at Lunigiana, and, being brought to Florence, was put to death in\nprison.\nThis government, during the eight years it continued, was violent and\ninsupportable; for Cosmo, being now old, and through ill health unable\nto attend to public affairs as formerly, Florence became a prey to a\nsmall number of her own citizens. Luca Pitti, in return for the services\nhe had performed for the republic, as made a knight, and to be no less\ngrateful than those who had conferred the dignity upon him, he ordered\nthat the priors, who had hitherto been called priors of the trades,\nshould also have a name to which they had no kind of claim, and\ntherefore called them priors of liberty. He also ordered, that as it\nhad been customary for the gonfalonier to sit upon the right hand of\nthe rectors, he should in future take his seat in the midst of them. And\nthat the Deity might appear to participate in what had been done, public\nprocessions were made and solemn services performed, to thank him for\nthe recovery of the government. The Signory and Cosmo made Luca Pitti\nrich presents, and all the citizens were emulous in imitation of them;\nso that the money given amounted to no less a sum than twenty thousand\nducats. He thus attained such influence, that not Cosmo but himself now\ngoverned the city; and his pride so increased, that he commenced two\nsuperb buildings, one in Florence, the other at Ruciano, about a mile\ndistant, both in a style of royal magnificence; that in the city, being\nlarger than any hitherto built by a private person. To complete them, he\nhad recourse to the most extraordinary means; for not only citizens and\nprivate individuals made him presents and supplied materials, but the\nmass of people, of every grade, also contributed. Besides this, any\nexiles who had committed murders, thefts, or other crimes which made\nthem amenable to the laws, found a safe refuge within their walls, if\nthey were able to contribute toward their decoration or completion. The\nother citizens, though they did not build like him, were no less violent\nor rapacious, so that if Florence were not harassed by external wars,\nshe was ruined by the wickedness of her own children. During this period\nthe wars of Naples took place. The pope also commenced hostilities in\nRomagna against the Malatesti, from whom he wished to take Rimino and\nCesena, held by them. In these designs, and his intentions of a crusade\nagainst the Turks, was passed the pontificate of Pius II.\nFlorence continued in disunion and disturbance. The dissensions\ncontinued among the party of Cosmo, in 1455, from the causes already\nrelated, which by his prudence, as we have also before remarked, he was\nenabled to tranquilize; but in the year 1464, his illness increased,\nand he died. Friends and enemies alike grieved for his loss; for his\npolitical opponents, perceiving the rapacity of the citizens, even\nduring the life of him who alone restrained them and made their tyranny\nsupportable, were afraid, lest after his decease, nothing but ruin would\nensue. Nor had they much hope of his son Piero, who though a very good\nman, was of infirm health, and new in the government, and they thought\nhe would be compelled to give way; so that, being unrestrained, their\nrapacity would pass all bounds. On these accounts, the regret was\nuniversal. Of all who have left memorials behind them, and who were not\nof the military profession, Cosmo was the most illustrious and the most\nrenowned. He not only surpassed all his contemporaries in wealth and\nauthority, but also in generosity and prudence; and among the qualities\nwhich contributed to make him prince in his own country, was his\nsurpassing all others in magnificence and generosity. His liberality\nbecame more obvious after his death, when Piero, his son, wishing\nto know what he possessed, it appeared there was no citizen of any\nconsequence to whom Cosmo had not lent a large sum of money; and often,\nwhen informed of some nobleman being in distress, he relieved him\nunasked. His magnificence is evident from the number of public edifices\nhe erected; for in Florence are the convents and churches of St. Marco\nand St. Lorenzo, and the monastery of Santa Verdiana; in the mountains\nof Fiesole, the church and abbey of St. Girolamo; and in the Mugello, he\nnot only restored, but rebuilt from its foundation, a monastery of the\nFrati Minori, or Minims. Besides these, in the church of Santa Croce,\nthe Servi, the Agnoli, and in San Miniato, he erected splendid chapels\nand altars; and besides building the churches and chapels we have\nmentioned, he provided them with all the ornaments, furniture, and\nutensils suitable for the performance of divine service. To these sacred\nedifices are to be added his private dwellings, one in Florence, of\nextent and elegance adapted to so great a citizen, and four others,\nsituated at Careggi, Fiesole, Craggiulo, and Trebbio, each, for size and\ngrandeur, equal to royal palaces. And, as if it were not sufficient\nto be distinguished for magnificence of buildings in Italy alone, he\nerected an hospital at Jerusalem, for the reception of poor and infirm\npilgrims. Although his habitations, like all his other works and\nactions, were quite of a regal character, and he alone was prince in\nFlorence, still everything was so tempered with his prudence, that\nhe never transgressed the decent moderation of civil life; in his\nconversation, his servants, his traveling, his mode of living, and the\nrelationships he formed, the modest demeanor of the citizen was always\nevident; for he was aware that a constant exhibition of pomp brings\nmore envy upon its possessor than greater realities borne without\nostentation. Thus in selecting consorts for his sons, he did not\nseek the alliance of princes, but for Giovanni chose Corneglia degli\nAllesandri, and for Piero, Lucrezia de' Tornabuoni. He gave his\ngranddaughters, the children of Piero, Bianca to Guglielmo de' Pazzi,\nand Nannina to Bernardo Ruccellai. No one of his time possessed such an\nintimate knowledge of government and state affairs as himself; and hence\namid such a variety of fortune, in a city so given to change, and among\na people of such extreme inconstancy, he retained possession of the\ngovernment thirty-one years; for being endowed with the utmost prudence,\nhe foresaw evils at a distance, and therefore had an opportunity either\nof averting them, or preventing their injurious results. He thus not\nonly vanquished domestic and civil ambition, but humbled the pride of\nmany princes with so much fidelity and address, that whatever powers\nwere in league with himself and his country, either overcame their\nadversaries, or remained uninjured by his alliance; and whoever were\nopposed to him, lost either their time, money, or territory. Of this\nthe Venetians afford a sufficient proof, who, while in league with him\nagainst Duke Filippo were always victorious, but apart from him were\nalways conquered; first by Filippo and then by Francesco. When they\njoined Alfonso against the Florentine republic, Cosmo, by his commercial\ncredit, so drained Naples and Venice of money, that they were glad to\nobtain peace upon any terms it was thought proper to grant. Whatever\ndifficulties he had to contend with, whether within the city or without,\nhe brought to a happy issue, at once glorious to himself and destructive\nto his enemies; so that civil discord strengthened his government in\nFlorence, and war increased his power and reputation abroad. He added\nto the Florentine dominions, the Borgo of St. Sepolcro, Montedoglio, the\nCasentino and Val di Bagno. His virtue and good fortune overcame all his\nenemies and exalted his friends. He was born in the year 1389, on the\nday of the saints Cosmo and Damiano. His earlier years were full of\ntrouble, as his exile, captivity, and personal danger fully testify;\nand having gone to the council of Constance, with Pope John, in order to\nsave his life, after the ruin of the latter, he was obliged to escape in\ndisguise. But after the age of forty, he enjoyed the greatest felicity;\nand not only those who assisted him in public business, but his\nagents who conducted his commercial speculations throughout Europe,\nparticipated in his prosperity. Hence many enormous fortunes took their\norigin in different families of Florence, as in that of the Tornabuoni,\nthe Benci, the Portinari, and the Sassetti. Besides these, all who\ndepended upon his advice and patronage became rich; and, though he\nwas constantly expending money in building churches, and in charitable\npurposes, he sometimes complained to his friends that he had never been\nable to lay out so much in the service of God as to find the balance in\nhis own favor, intimating that all he had done or could do, was still\nunequal to what the Almighty had done for him. He was of middle stature,\nolive complexion, and venerable aspect; not learned but exceedingly\neloquent, endowed with great natural capacity, generous to his friends,\nkind to the poor, comprehensive in discourse, cautious in advising,\nand in his speeches and replies, grave and witty. When Rinaldo degli\nAlbizzi, at the beginning of his exile, sent to him to say, \"the hen had\nlaid,\" he replied, \"she did ill to lay so far from the nest.\" Some other\nof the rebels gave him to understand they were \"not dreaming.\" He said,\n\"he believed it, for he had robbed them of their sleep.\" When Pope\nPius was endeavoring to induce the different governments to join in\nan expedition against the Turks, he said, \"he was an old man, and had\nundertaken the enterprise of a young one.\" To the Venetians ambassadors,\nwho came to Florence with those of King Alfonso to complain of the\nrepublic, he uncovered his head, and asked them what color it was; they\nsaid, \"white;\" he replied, \"it is so; and it will not be long before\nyour senators have heads as white as mine.\" A few hours before his\ndeath, his wife asked him why he kept his eyes shut, and he said, \"to\nget them in the way of it.\" Some citizens saying to him, after his\nreturn from exile, that he injured the city, and that it was offensive\nto God to drive so many religious persons out of it; he replied that,\n\"it was better to injure the city, than to ruin it; that two yards\nof rose-colored cloth would make a gentleman, and that it required\nsomething more to direct a government than to play with a string of\nbeads.\" These words gave occasion to his enemies to slander him, as a\nman who loved himself more than his country, and was more attached\nto this world than to the next. Many others of his sayings might be\nadduced, but we shall omit them as unnecessary. Cosmo was a friend and\npatron of learned men. He brought Argiripolo, a Greek by birth, and one\nof the most erudite of his time, to Florence, to instruct the youth in\nHellenic literature. He entertained Marsilio Ficino, the reviver of the\nPlatonic philosophy, in his own house; and being much attached to him,\nhave him a residence near his palace at Careggi, that he might pursue\nthe study of letters with greater convenience, and himself have an\nopportunity of enjoying his company. His prudence, his great wealth, the\nuses to which he applied it, and his splendid style of living, caused\nhim to be beloved and respected in Florence, and obtained for him the\nhighest consideration, not only among the princes and governments of\nItaly, but throughout all Europe. He thus laid a foundation for his\ndescendants, which enabled them to equal him in virtue, and greatly\nsurpass him in fortune; while the authority they possessed in Florence\nand throughout Christendom was not obtained without being merited.\nToward the close of his life he suffered great affliction; for, of his\ntwo sons, Piero and Giovanni, the latter, of whom he entertained the\ngreatest hopes, died; and the former was so sickly as to be unable to\nattend either to public or private business. On being carried from\none apartment to another, after Giovanni's death, he remarked to his\nattendants, with a sigh, \"This is too large a house for so small a\nfamily.\" His great mind also felt distressed at the idea that he had not\nextended the Florentine dominions by any valuable acquisition; and he\nregretted it the more, from imagining he had been deceived by Francesco\nSforza, who, while count, had promised, that if he became lord of Milan,\nhe would undertake the conquest of Lucca for the Florentines, a design,\nhowever, that was never realized; for the count's ideas changed upon his\nbecoming duke; he resolved to enjoy in peace, the power he had acquired\nby war, and would not again encounter its fatigues and dangers, unless\nthe welfare of his own dominions required it. This was a source of much\nannoyance to Cosmo, who felt he had incurred great expense and trouble\nfor an ungrateful and perfidious friend. His bodily infirmities\nprevented him from attending either to public or private affairs, as he\nhad been accustomed, and he consequently witnessed both going to decay;\nfor Florence was ruined by her own citizens, and his fortune by his\nagents and children. He died, however, at the zenith of his glory and\nin the enjoyment of the highest renown. The city, and all the Christian\nprinces, condoled with his son Piero for his loss. His funeral was\nconducted with the utmost pomp and solemnity, the whole city following\nhis corpse to the tomb in the church of St. Lorenzo, on which, by public\ndecree, he was inscribed, \"FATHER OF HIS COUNTRY.\" If, in speaking of\nCosmo's actions, I have rather imitated the biographies of princes than\ngeneral history, it need not occasion wonder; for of so extraordinary an\nindividual I was compelled to speak with unusual praise.\nCHAPTER II\nThe duke of Milan becomes lord of Genoa--The king of Naples and the\nduke of Milan endeavor to secure their dominions to their heirs--Jacopo\nPiccinino honorably received at Milan, and shortly afterward murdered\nat Naples--Fruitless endeavors of Pius II. to excite Christendom against\nthe Turks--Death of Francesco Sforza, duke of Milan--Perfidious counsel\ngiven to Piero de' Medici by Diotisalvi Neroni--Conspiracy of\nDiotisalvi and others against Piero--Futile attempts to appease the\ndisorders--Public spectacles--Projects of the conspirators against Piero\nde' Medici--Niccolo Fedini discloses to Piero the plots of his enemies.\nWhile Florence and Italy were in this condition, Louis XI. of France\nwas involved in very serious troubles with his barons, who, with the\nassistance of Francis, duke of Brittany, and Charles, duke of Burgundy,\nwere in arms against him. This attack was so serious, that he was unable\nto render further assistance to John of Anjou in his enterprise against\nGenoa and Naples; and, standing in need of all the forces he could\nraise, he gave over Savona (which still remained in the power of the\nFrench) to the duke of Milan, and also intimated, that if he wished,\nhe had his permission to undertake the conquest of Genoa. Francesco\naccepted the proposal, and with the influence afforded by the king's\nfriendship, and the assistance of the Adorni, he became lord of Genoa.\nIn acknowledgment of this benefit, he sent fifteen hundred horse into\nFrance for the king's service, under the command of Galeazzo, his eldest\nson. Thus Ferrando of Aragon and Francesco Sforza became, the latter,\nduke of Lombardy and prince of Genoa, and the former, sovereign of the\nwhole kingdom of Naples. Their families being allied by marriage, they\nthought they might so confirm their power as to secure to themselves its\nenjoyment during life, and at their deaths, its unencumbered reversion\nto their heirs. To attain this end, they considered it necessary that\nthe king should remove all ground of apprehension from those barons who\nhad offended him in the war of John of Anjou, and that the duke should\nextirpate the adherents of the Bracceschi, the natural enemies of\nhis family, who, under Jacopo Piccinino, had attained the highest\nreputation. The latter was now the first general in Italy, and\npossessing no territory, he naturally excited the apprehension of all\nwho had dominions, and especially of the duke, who, conscious of what\nhe had himself done, thought he could neither enjoy his own estate in\nsafety, nor leave them with any degree of security to his son during\nJacopo's lifetime. The king, therefore, strenuously endeavored to come\nto terms with his barons, and using his utmost ingenuity to secure them,\nsucceeded in his object; for they perceived their ruin to be inevitable\nif they continued in war with their sovereign, though from submission\nand confidence in him, they would still have reason for apprehension.\nMankind are always most eager to avoid a certain evil; and hence\ninferior powers are easily deceived by princes. The barons, conscious\nof the danger of continuing the war, trusted the king's promises, and\nhaving placed themselves in his hands, they were soon after destroyed\nin various ways, and under a variety of pretexts. This alarmed Jacopo\nPiccinino, who was with his forces at Sulmona; and to deprive the king\nof the opportunity of treating him similarly, he endeavored, by the\nmediation of his friends, to be reconciled with the duke, who, by the\nmost liberal offers, induced Jacopo to visit him at Milan, accompanied\nby only a hundred horse.\nJacopo had served many years with his father and brother, first under\nDuke Filippo, and afterward under the Milanese republic, so that by\nfrequent intercourse with the citizens he had acquired many friends and\nuniversal popularity, which present circumstances tended to increase;\nfor the prosperity and newly acquired power of the Sforzeschi had\noccasioned envy, while Jacopo's misfortunes and long absence had given\nrise to compassion and a great desire to see him. These various feelings\nwere displayed upon his arrival; for nearly all the nobility went to\nmeet him; the streets through which he passed were filled with citizens,\nanxious to catch a glimpse of him, while shouts of \"The Bracceschi! the\nBracceschi!\" resounded on all sides. These honors accelerated his ruin;\nfor the duke's apprehensions increased his desire of destroying him; and\nto effect this with the least possible suspicion, Jacopo's marriage with\nDrusiana, the duke's natural daughter, was now celebrated. The duke then\narranged with Ferrando to take him into pay, with the title of captain\nof his forces, and give him 100,000 florins for his maintenance. After\nthis agreement, Jacopo, accompanied by a ducal ambassador and his wife\nDrusiana, proceeded to Naples, where he was honorably and joyfully\nreceived, and for many days entertained with every kind of festivity;\nbut having asked permission to go to Sulmona, where his forces were, the\nking invited him to a banquet in the castle, at the conclusion of which\nhe and his son Francesco were imprisoned, and shortly afterward put to\ndeath. It was thus our Italian princes, fearing those virtues in others\nwhich they themselves did not possess, extirpated them; and hence the\ncountry became a prey to the efforts of those by whom it was not long\nafterward oppressed and ruined.\nAt this time, Pope Pius II. having settled the affairs of Romagna, and\nwitnessing a universal peace, thought it a suitable opportunity to lead\nthe Christians against the Turks, and adopted measures similar to those\nwhich his predecessors had used. All the princes promised assistance\neither in men or money; while Matthias, king of Hungary, and Charles,\nduke of Burgundy, intimated their intention of joining the enterprise\nin person, and were by the pope appointed leaders of the expedition. The\npontiff was so full of expectation, that he left Rome and proceeded\nto Ancona, where it had been arranged that the whole army should be\nassembled, and the Venetians engaged to send ships thither to convey the\nforces to Sclavonia. Upon the arrival of the pope in that city,\nthere was soon such a concourse of people, that in a few days all\nthe provisions it contained, or that could be procured from the\nneighborhood, were consumed, and famine began to impend. Besides this,\nthere was no money to provide those who were in want of it, nor arms\nto furnish such as were without them. Neither Matthias nor Charles made\ntheir appearance. The Venetians sent a captain with some galleys, but\nrather for ostentation and the sake of keeping their word, than for the\npurpose of conveying troops. During this position of affairs, the pope,\nbeing old and infirm, died, and the assembled troops returned to their\nhomes. The death of the pontiff occurred in 1465, and Paul II. of\nVenetian origin, was chosen to succeed him; and that nearly all the\nprincipalities of Italy might change their rulers about the same period,\nin the following year Francesco Sforza, duke of Milan, also died, having\noccupied the dukedom sixteen years, and Galleazzo, his son, succeeded\nhim.\nThe death of this prince infused redoubled energy into the Florentine\ndissensions, and caused them to produce more prompt effects than they\nwould otherwise have done. Upon the demise of Cosmo, his son Piero,\nbeing heir to the wealth and government of his father, called to his\nassistance Diotisalvi Neroni, a man of great influence and the highest\nreputation, in whom Cosmo reposed so much confidence that just before\nhis death he recommended Piero to be wholly guided by him, both with\nregard to the government of the city and the management of his fortune.\nPiero acquired Diotisalvi with the opinion Cosmo entertained of him,\nand said that as he wished to obey his father, though now no more, as\nhe always had while alive, he should consult him concerning both his\npatrimony and the city. Beginning with his private affairs, he caused\nan account of all his property, liabilities, and assets, to be placed in\nDiotisalvi's hands, that, with an entire acquaintance with the state of\nhis affairs, he might be able to afford suitable advice, and the latter\npromised to use the utmost care. Upon examination of these accounts the\naffairs were found to be in great disorder, and Diotisalvi, instigated\nrather by his own ambition than by attachment to Piero or gratitude\nto Cosmo, thought he might without difficulty deprive him of both\nthe reputation and the splendor which his father had left him as his\ninheritance. In order to realize his views, he waited upon Piero, and\nadvised him to adopt a measure which, while it appeared quite correct in\nitself, and suitable to existing circumstances, involved a consequence\ndestructive to his authority. He explained the disorder of his affairs,\nand the large amount of money it would be necessary to provide, if he\nwished to preserve his influence in the state and his reputation of\nwealth; and said there was no other means of remedying these disorders\nso just and available as to call in the sums which his father had lent\nto an infinite number of persons, both foreigners and citizens;\nfor Cosmo, to acquire partisans in Florence and friends abroad, was\nextremely liberal of his money, and the amount of loans due to him was\nenormous. Piero thought the advice good, because he was only desirous to\nrepossess his own property to meet the demands to which he was liable;\nbut as soon as he had ordered those amounts to be recalled, the\ncitizens, as if he had asked for something to which he had no kind of\nclaim, took great offense, loaded him with opprobrious expressions, and\naccused him of being avaricious and ungrateful.\nDiotisalvi, noticing the popular excitement against Piero, occasioned\nby his own advice, obtained an interview with Luca Pitti, Agnolo\nAcciajuoli, and Niccolo Soderini, and they resolved to unite their\nefforts to deprive him both of the government and his influence. Each\nwas actuated by a different motive; Luca Pitti wished to take the\nposition Cosmo had occupied, for he was now become so great, that he\ndisdained to submit to Piero; Diotisalvi Neroni, who knew Luca unfit\nto be at the head of a government, thought that of necessity on Piero's\nremoval, the whole authority of the state would devolve upon himself;\nNiccolo Soderini desired the city to enjoy greater liberty, and for\nthe laws to be equally binding upon all. Agnolo Acciajuoli was greatly\nincensed against the Medici, for the following reasons: his son,\nRaffaello, had some time before married Alessandra de' Bardi, and\nreceived with her a large dowry. She, either by her own fault or\nthe misconduct of others, suffered much ill-treatment both from her\nfather-in-law and her husband, and in consequence Lorenzo d' Ilarione,\nher kinsman, out of pity for the girl, being accompanied by several\narmed men, took her away from Agnolo's house. The Acciajuoli complained\nof the injury done them by the Bardi, and the matter was referred to\nCosmo, who decided that the Acciajuoli should restore to Alessandra her\nfortune, and then leave it to her choice either to return to her husband\nor not. Agnolo thought Cosmo had not, in this instance, treated him as\na friend; and having been unable to avenge himself on the father, he now\nresolved to do his utmost to ruin the son. These conspirators, though\neach was influenced by a different motive from the rest, affected to\nhave only one object in view, which was that the city should be governed\nby the magistrates, and not be subjected to the counsels of a few\nindividuals. The odium against Piero, and opportunities of injuring him,\nwere increased by the number of merchants who failed about this time;\nfor it was reported that he, in having, quite unexpectedly to all,\nresolved to call in his debts, had, to the disgrace and ruin of the\ncity, caused them to become insolvent. To this was added his endeavor\nto obtain Clarice degli Orsini as wife of Lorenzo, his eldest son; and\nhence his enemies took occasion to say, it was quite clear, that as he\ndespised a Florentine alliance, he no longer considered himself one of\nthe people, and was preparing to make himself prince; for he who refuses\nhis fellow-citizens as relatives, desires to make them slaves, and\ntherefore cannot expect to have them as friends. The leaders of the\nsedition thought they had the victory in their power; for the greater\npart of the citizens followed them, deceived by the name of liberty\nwhich they, to give their purpose a graceful covering, adopted upon\ntheir ensigns.\nIn this agitated state of the city, some, to whom civil discord was\nextremely offensive, thought it would be well to endeavor to engage\nmen's minds with some new occupation, because when unemployed they\nare commonly led by whoever chooses to excite them. To divert their\nattention from matters of government, it being now a year since the\ndeath of Cosmo, it was resolved to celebrate two festivals, similar to\nthe most solemn observed in the city. At one of them was represented\nthe arrival of the three kings from the east, led by the star which\nannounced the nativity of Christ; which was conducted with such pomp and\nmagnificence, that the preparations for it kept the whole city occupied\nmany months. The other was a tournament (for so they call the exhibition\nof equestrian combats), in which the sons of the first families in the\ncity took part with the most celebrated cavaliers of Italy. Among the\nmost distinguished of the Florentine youth was Lorenzo, eldest son of\nPiero, who, not by favor, but by his own personal valor, obtained the\nprincipal prize. When these festivals were over, the citizens reverted\nto the same thoughts which had previously occupied them, and each\npursued his ideas with more earnestness than ever. Serious differences\nand troubles were the result; and these were greatly increased by two\ncircumstances: one of which was, that the authority of the balia had\nexpired; the other, that upon the death of Duke Francesco, Galeazzo the\nnew duke sent ambassadors to Florence, to renew the engagements of his\nfather with the city, which, among other things, provided that every\nyear a certain sum of money should be paid to the duke. The principal\nopponents of the Medici took occasion, from this demand, to make public\nresistance in the councils, on pretense that the alliance was made with\nFrancesco and not Galeazzo; so that Francesco being dead, the obligation\nhad ceased; nor was there any necessity to revive it, because Galeazzo\ndid not possess his father's talents, and consequently they neither\ncould nor ought to expect the same benefits from him; that if they had\nderived little advantage from Francesco, they would obtain still less\nfrom Galeazzo; and that if any citizen wished to hire him for his own\npurposes, it was contrary to civil rule, and inconsistent with the\npublic liberty. Piero, on the contrary, argued that it would be very\nimpolitic to lose such an alliance from mere avarice, and that there\nwas nothing so important to the republic, and to the whole of Italy,\nas their alliance with the duke; that the Venetians, while they were\nunited, could not hope either by feigned friendship or open war\nto injure the duchy; but as soon as they perceived the Florentines\nalienated from him they would prepare for hostilities, and, finding him\nyoung, new in the government, and without friends, they would, either\nby force or fraud, compel him to join them; in which case ruin of the\nrepublic would be inevitable.\nThe arguments of Piero were without effect, and the animosity of the\nparties began to be openly manifested in their nocturnal assemblies; the\nfriends of the Medici meeting in the Crocetta, and their adversaries in\nthe Pieta. The latter being anxious for Piero's ruin, had induced many\ncitizens to subscribe their names as favorable to the undertaking. Upon\none occasion, particularly when considering the course to be adopted,\nalthough all agreed that the power of the Medici ought to be reduced,\ndifferent opinions were given concerning the means by which it should be\neffected; one party, the most temperate and reasonable, held that as the\nauthority of the balia had ceased, they must take care to prevent\nits renewal; it would then be found to be the universal wish that the\nmagistrates and councils should govern the city, and in a short time\nPiero's power would be visibly diminished, and, as a consequence of his\nloss of influence in the government, his commercial credit would also\nfail; for his affairs were in such a state, that if they could prevent\nhim from using the public money his ruin must ensue. They would thus\nbe in no further danger from him, and would succeed in the recovery of\ntheir liberty, without the death or exile of any individual; but if\nthey attempted violence they would incur great dangers; for mankind\nare willing to allow one who falls of himself to meet his fate, but if\npushed down they would hasten to his relief; so that if they adopted no\nextraordinary measures against him, he will have no reason for defense\nor aid; and if he were to seek them it would be greatly to his own\ninjury, by creating such a general suspicion as would accelerate his\nruin, and justify whatever course they might think proper to adopt. Many\nof the assembly were dissatisfied with this tardy method of proceeding;\nthey thought delay would be favorable to him and injurious to\nthemselves; for if they allowed matters to take their ordinary course,\nPiero would be in no danger whatever, while they themselves would incur\nmany; for the magistrates who were opposed to him would allow him to\nrule the city, and his friends would make him a prince, and their own\nruin would be inevitable, as happened in 1458; and though the advice\nthey had just heard might be most consistent with good feeling, the\npresent would be found to be the safest. That it would therefore be\nbest, while the minds of men were yet excited against him, to effect\nhis destruction. It must be their plan to arm themselves, and engage the\nassistance of the marquis of Ferrara, that they might not be destitute\nof troops; and if a favorable Signory were drawn, they would be in\ncondition to make use of them. They therefore determined to wait the\nformation of the new Signory, and be governed by circumstances.\nAmong the conspirators was Niccolo Fedini, who had acted as president of\ntheir assemblies. He, being induced by most certain hopes, disclosed the\nwhole affair to Piero, and gave him a list of those who had subscribed\ntheir names, and also of the conspirators. Piero was alarmed on\ndiscovering the number and quality of those who were opposed to him; and\nby the advice of his friends he resolved to take the signatures of those\nwho were inclined to favor him. Having employed one of his most\ntrusty confidants to carry his design into effect, he found so great a\ndisposition to change and instability, that many who had previously set\ndown their names among the number of his enemies, now subscribed them in\nhis favor.\nCHAPTER III\nNiccolo Soderini drawn Gonfalonier of Justice--Great hopes excited in\nconsequence--The two parties take arms--The fears of the Signory--Their\nconduct with regard to Piero--Piero's reply to the Signory--Reform of\ngovernment in favor of Piero de' Medici--Dispersion of his enemies--Fall\nof Lucca Pitti--Letter of Agnolo Acciajuoli to Piero de' Medici--Piero's\nanswer--Designs of the Florentine exiles--They induce the Venetians to\nmake war on Florence.\nIn the midst of these events, the time arrived for the renewal of\nthe supreme magistracy; and Niccolo Soderini was drawn Gonfalonier\nof Justice. It was surprising to see by what a concourse, not only of\ndistinguished citizens, but also of the populace, he was accompanied to\nthe palace; and while on the way thither an olive wreath was placed upon\nhis head, to signify that upon him depended the safety and liberty\nof the city. This, among many similar instances, serves to prove how\nundesirable it is to enter upon office or power exciting inordinate\nexpectations; for, being unable to fulfil them (many looking for more\nthan it is possible to perform), shame and disappointment are the\nordinary results. Tommaso and Niccolo Soderini were brothers. Niccolo\nwas the more ardent and spirited, Tommaso the wiser man; who, being very\nmuch the friend of Piero, and knowing that his brother desired nothing\nbut the liberty of the city, and the stability of the republic, without\ninjury to any, advised him to make new Squittini, by which means the\nelection purses might be filled with the names of those favorable to his\ndesign. Niccolo took his brother's advice, and thus wasted the period\nof his magistracy in vain hopes, which his friends, the leading\nconspirators, allowed him to do from motives of envy; for they were\nunwilling that the government should be reformed by the authority\nof Niccolo, and thought they would be in time enough to effect their\npurpose under another gonfalonier. Thus the magistracy of Niccolo\nexpired; and having commenced many things without completing aught, he\nretired from office with much less credit than when he had entered upon\nit.\nThis circumstance caused the aggrandizement of Piero's party, whose\nfriends entertained stronger hopes, while those who had been neutral or\nwavering became his adherents; so that both sides being balanced,\nmany months elapsed without any open demonstration of their particular\ndesigns. Piero's party continuing to gather strength, his enemies'\nindignation increased in proportion; and they now determined to effect\nby force what they either could not accomplish, or were unwilling to\nattempt by the medium of the magistrates, which was assassination of\nPiero, who lay sick at Careggi, and to this end order the marquis of\nFerrara nearer to the city with his forces, that after Piero's death he\nmight lead them into the piazza, and thus compel the Signory to form a\ngovernment according to their own wishes; for though all might not be\nfriendly, they trusted they would be able to induce those to submit by\nfear who might be opposed to them from principle.\nDiotisalvi, the better to conceal his design, frequently visited Piero,\nconversed with him respecting the union of the city, and advised him to\neffect it. The conspirators' designs had already been fully disclosed to\nPiero; besides this, Domenico Martelli had informed him, that Francesco\nNeroni, the brother of Diotisalvi, had endeavored to induce him to join\nthem, assuring him the victory was certain, and their object all but\nattained. Upon this, Piero resolved to take advantage of his enemies'\ntampering with the marquis of Ferrara, and be first in arms. He\ntherefore intimated that he had received a letter from Giovanni\nBentivogli, prince of Bologna, which informed him that the marquis of\nFerrara was upon the river Albo, at the head of a considerable force,\nwith the avowed intention of leading it to Florence; that upon this\nadvice he had taken up arms; after which, in the midst of a strong\nforce, he came to the city, when all who were disposed to support him,\narmed themselves also. The adverse party did the same, but not in such\ngood order, being unprepared. The residence of Diotisalvi being near\nthat of Piero, he did not think himself safe in it, but first went to\nthe palace and begged the Signory would endeavor to induce Piero to lay\ndown his arms, and thence to Luca Pitti, to keep him faithful in their\ncause. Niccolo Soderini displayed the most activity; for taking arms,\nand being followed by nearly all the plebeians in his vicinity, he\nproceeded to the house of Luca, and begged that he would mount his\nhorse, and come to the piazza in support of the Signory, who were, he\nsaid, favorable, and that the victory would, undoubtedly, be on their\nside; that he should not stay in the house to be basely slain by their\narmed enemies, or ignominiously deceived by those who were unarmed; for,\nin that case, he would soon repent of having neglected an opportunity\nirrecoverably lost; that if he desired the forcible ruin of Piero, he\nmight easily effect it; and that if he were anxious for peace, it would\nbe far better to be in a condition to propose terms than to be compelled\nto accept any that might be offered. These words produced no effect upon\nLuca, whose mind was now quite made up; he had been induced to desert\nhis party by new conditions and promises of alliance from Piero; for one\nof his nieces had been married to Giovanni Tornabuoni. He, therefore,\nadvised Niccolo to dismiss his followers and return home, telling him\nhe ought to be satisfied, if the city were governed by the magistrates,\nwhich would certainly be the case, and that all ought to lay aside their\nweapons; for the Signory, most of whom were friendly, would decide their\ndifferences. Niccolo, finding him impracticable, returned home; but\nbefore he left, he said, \"I can do the city no good alone, but I can\neasily foresee the evils that will befall her. This resolution of yours\nwill rob our country of her liberty; you will lose the government, I\nshall lose my property, and the rest will be exiled.\"\nDuring this disturbance the Signory closed the palace and kept their\nmagistrates about them, without showing favor to either party. The\ncitizens, especially those who had followed Luca Pitti, finding Piero\nfully prepared and his adversaries unarmed, began to consider, not how\nthey might injure him, but how, with least observation, glide into\nthe ranks of his friends. The principal citizens, the leaders of both\nfactions, assembled in the palace in the presence of the Signory,\nand spoke respecting the state of the city and the reconciliation\nof parties; and as the infirmities of Piero prevented him from being\npresent, they, with one exception, unanimously determined to wait upon\nhim at his house. Niccolo Soderini having first placed his children\nand his effects under the care of his brother Tommaso, withdrew to his\nvilla, there to await the event, but apprehended misfortune to himself\nand ruin to his country. The other citizens coming into Piero's\npresence, one of them who had been appointed spokesman, complained of\nthe disturbances that had arisen in the city, and endeavored to show,\nthat those must be most to blame who had been first to take up arms; and\nnot knowing what Piero (who was evidently the first to do so) intended,\nthey had come in order to be informed of his design, and if it had in\nview the welfare of the city, they were desirous of supporting it. Piero\nreplied, that not those who first take arms are the most to blame, but\nthose who give the first occasion for it, and if they would reflect a\nlittle on their mode of proceeding toward himself, they would cease to\nwonder at what he had done; for they could not fail to perceive, that\nnocturnal assemblies, the enrollment of partisans, and attempts to\ndeprive him both of his authority and his life, had caused him to take\narms; and they might further observe, that as his forces had not quitted\nhis own house, his design was evidently only to defend himself and not\nto injure others. He neither sought nor desired anything but safety and\nrepose; neither had his conduct ever manifested a desire for ought else;\nfor when the authority of the Balia expired, he never made any attempt\nto renew it, and was very glad the magistrates had governed the city and\nhad been content. They might also remember that Cosmo and his sons could\nlive respected in Florence, either with the Balia or without it, and\nthat in 1458, it was not his family, but themselves, who had renewed it.\nThat if they did not wish for it at present, neither did he; but this\ndid not satisfy them; for he perceived that they thought it impossible\nto remain in Florence while he was there. It was entirely beyond all\nhis anticipations that his own or his father's friends should think\nthemselves unsafe with him in Florence, having always shown himself\nquiet and peaceable. He then addressed himself to Diotisalvi and his\nbrothers, who were present, reminding them with grave indignation, of\nthe benefits they had received from Cosmo, the confidence he had reposed\nin them and their subsequent ingratitude; and his words so strongly\nexcited some present, that had he not interfered, they would certainly\nhave torn the Neroni to pieces on the spot. He concluded by saying, that\nhe should approve of any determination of themselves and the Signory;\nand that for his own part, he only desired peace and safety. After this,\nmany things were discussed, but nothing determined, excepting generally,\nthat it was necessary to reform the administration of the city and\ngovernment.\nThe Gonfalon of Justice was then in the hands of Bernardo Lotti, a man\nnot in the confidence of Piero, who was therefore disinclined to attempt\naught while he was in office; but no inconvenience would result from the\ndelay, as his magistracy was on the point of expiring. Upon the election\nof Signors for the months of September and October, 1466, Roberto Lioni\nwas appointed to the supreme magistracy, and as soon as he assumed its\nduties, every requisite arrangement having been previously made, the\npeople were called to the piazza, and a new Balia created, wholly in\nfavor of Piero, who soon afterward filled all the offices of government\naccording to his own pleasure. These transactions alarmed the leaders of\nthe opposite faction, and Agnolo Acciajuoli fled to Naples, Diotisalvi\nNeroni and Niccolo Soderini to Venice. Luca Pitti remained in Florence,\ntrusting to his new relationship and the promises of Piero. The refugees\nwere declared rebels, and all the family of the Neroni were dispersed.\nGiovanni di Neroni, then archbishop of Florence, to avoid a greater\nevil, became a voluntary exile at Rome, and to many other citizens\nwho fled, various places of banishment were appointed. Nor was this\nconsidered sufficient; for it was ordered that the citizens should go\nin solemn procession to thank God for the preservation of the government\nand the reunion of the city, during the performance of which, some were\ntaken and tortured, and part of them afterward put to death and exiled.\nIn this great vicissitude of affairs, there was not a more remarkable\ninstance of the uncertainty of fortune than Luca Pitti, who soon found\nthe difference between victory and defeat, honor and disgrace. His house\nnow presented only a vast solitude, where previously crowds of citizens\nhad assembled. In the streets, his friends and relatives, instead of\naccompanying, were afraid even to salute him. Some of them were deprived\nof the honors of government, others of their property, and all alike\nthreatened. The superb edifices he had commenced were abandoned by\nthe builders; the benefits that had been conferred upon him, where now\nexchanged for injuries, the honors for disgrace. Hence many of those who\nhad presented him with articles of value now demanded them back again,\nas being only lent; and those who had been in the habit of extolling\nhim as a man of surpassing excellence, now termed him violent and\nungrateful. So that, when too late, he regretted not having taken the\nadvice of Niccolo Soderini, and preferred an honorable death in battle,\nthan to a life of ignominy among his victorious enemies.\nThe exiles now began to consider various means of recovering that\ncitizenship which they had not been able to preserve. However, Agnolo\nAcciajuoli being at Naples, before he attempted anything else, resolved\nto sound Piero, and try if he could effect a reconciliation. For this\npurpose, he wrote to him in the following terms: \"I cannot help laughing\nat the freaks of fortune, perceiving how, at her pleasure, she converts\nfriends into enemies, and enemies into friends. You may remember that\nduring your father's exile, regarding more the injury done to him than\nmy own misfortunes, I was banished, and in danger of death, and never\nduring Cosmo's life failed to honor and support your family; neither\nhave I since his death ever entertained a wish to injure you. True,\nit is, that your own sickness, and the tender years of your sons,\nso alarmed me, that I judged it desirable to give such a form to the\ngovernment, that after your death our country might not be ruined; and\nhence, the proceedings, which not against you, but for the safety of\nthe state, have been adopted, which, if mistaken, will surely obtain\nforgiveness, both for the good design in view, and on account of my\nformer services. Neither can I apprehend, that your house, having found\nme so long faithful, should now prove unmerciful, or that you could\ncancel the impression of so much merit for so small a fault.\" Piero\nreplied: \"Your laughing in your present abode is the cause why I do\nnot weep, for were you to laugh in Florence, I should have to weep at\nNaples. I confess you were well disposed toward my father, and you ought\nto confess you were well paid for it; and the obligation is so much the\ngreater on your part than on ours, as deeds are of greater value than\nwords. Having been recompensed for your good wishes, it ought not to\nsurprise you that you now receive the due reward of your bad ones.\nNeither will a pretense of your patriotism excuse you, for none will\nthink the city less beloved or benefited by the Medici, than by the\nAcciajuoli. It, therefore, seems but just, that you should remain in\ndishonor at Naples, since you knew not how to live with honor at home.\"\nAgnolo, hopeless of obtaining pardon, went to Rome, where, joining the\narchbishop and other refugees, they used every available means to injure\nthe commercial credit of the Medici in that city. Their attempts greatly\nannoyed Piero; but by his friends' assistance, he was enabled to render\nthem abortive. Diotisalvi Neroni and Niccolo Soderini strenuously urged\nthe Venetian senate to make war upon their country, calculating, that\nin case of an attack, the government being new and unpopular, would\nbe unable to resist. At this time there resided at Ferrara, Giovanni\nFrancesco, son of Palla Strozzi, who, with his father, was banished from\nFlorence in the changes of 1434. He possessed great influence, and was\nconsidered one of the richest merchants. The newly banished pointed out\nto Giovanni Francesco how easily they might return to their country,\nif the Venetians were to undertake the enterprise, and that it was most\nprobable they would do so, if they had pecuniary assistance, but that\notherwise it would be doubtful. Giovanni Francesco, wishing to avenge\nhis own injuries, at once fell in with their ideas, and promised to\ncontribute to the success of the attempt all the means in his power.\nOn this they went to the Doge, and complained of the exile they were\ncompelled to endure, for no other reason, they said, than for having\nwished their country should be subject to equal laws, and that the\nmagistrates should govern, not a few private individuals; that Piero de'\nMedici, with his adherents, who were accustomed to act tyrannically, had\nsecretly taken up arms, deceitfully induced them to lay their own aside,\nand thus, by fraud, expelled them from their country; that, not content\nwith this, they made the Almighty himself a means of oppression to\nseveral, who, trusting to their promises, had remained in the city\nand were there betrayed; for, during public worship and solemn\nsupplications, that the Deity might seem to participate in their\ntreachery, many citizens had been seized, imprisoned, tortured, and put\nto death; thus affording to the world a horrible and impious precedent.\nTo avenge themselves for these injuries, they knew not where to turn\nwith so much hope of success as to the senate, which, having always\nenjoyed their liberty, ought to compassionate those who had lost it.\nThey therefore called upon them as free men to assist them against\ntyrants; as pious, against the wicked; and would remind the Venetians,\nthat it was the family of the Medici who had robbed them of their\ndominions in Lombardy, contrary to the wish of the other citizens,\nand who, in opposition to the interests of the senate, had favored and\nsupported Francesco, so, that if the exiles' distresses could not induce\nthem to undertake the war, the just indignation of the people of Venice,\nand their desire of vengeance ought to prevail.\nCHAPTER IV\nWar between the Venetians and the Florentines--Peace\nre-established--Death of Niccolo Soderini--His character--Excesses in\nFlorence--Various external events from 1468 to 1471--Accession of Sixtus\nIV.--His character--Grief of Piero de' Medici for the violence committed\nin Florence--His speech to the principal citizens--Plans of Piero de'\nMedici for the restoration of order--His death and character--Tommaso\nSoderini, a citizen of great reputation, declares himself in favor of\nthe Medici--Disturbances at Prato occasioned by Bernardo Nardi.\nThe concluding words of the Florentine exiles produced the utmost\nexcitement among the Venetian senators, and they resolved to send\nBernardo Coglione, their general, to attack the Florentine territory.\nThe troops were assembled, and joined by Ercole da Esti, who had been\nsent by Borgo, marquis of Ferrara. At the commencement of hostilities,\nthe Florentines not being prepared, their enemies burned the Borgo of\nDovadola, and plundered the surrounding country. But having expelled the\nenemies of Piero, renewed their league with Galeazzo, duke of Milan, and\nFerrando, king of Naples, they appointed to the command of their forces\nFederigo, count of Urbino; and being thus on good terms with their\nfriends, their enemies occasioned them less anxiety. Ferrando sent\nAlfonso, his eldest son, to their aid, and Galeazzo came in person,\neach at the head of a suitable force, and all assembled at Castrocaro,\na fortress belonging to the Florentines, and situated among the roots of\nthe Appennines which descend from Tuscany to Romagna. In the meantime,\nthe enemy withdrew toward Imola. A few slight skirmishes took place\nbetween the armies; yet, in accordance with the custom of the times,\nneither of them acted on the offensive, besieged any town, or gave the\nother an opportunity of coming to a general engagement; but each kept\nwithin their tents, and conducted themselves with most remarkable\ncowardice. This occasioned general dissatisfaction among the\nFlorentines; for they found themselves involved in an expensive war,\nfrom which no advantage could be derived. The magistrates complained\nof these spiritless proceedings to those who had been appointed\ncommissaries to the expedition; but they replied, that the entire evil\nwas chargeable upon the Duke Galeazzo, who possessing great authority\nand little experience, was unable to suggest useful measures, and\nunwilling to take the advice of those who were more capable; and\ntherefore any demonstration of courage or energy would be impracticable\nso long as he remained with the army. Hereupon the Florentines\nintimated to the duke, that his presence with the force was in many\nways advantageous and beneficial, and of itself sufficient to alarm the\nenemy; but they considered his own safety and that of his dominions,\nmuch more important than their own immediate convenience; because so\nlong as the former were safe, the Florentines had nothing to fear, and\nall would go well; but if his dominions were to suffer, they might then\napprehend all kinds of misfortune. They assured him they did not think\nit prudent for him to be absent so long from Milan, having recently\nsucceeded to the government, and being surrounded by many powerful\nenemies and suspected neighbors; while any who were desirous of plotting\nagainst him, had an opportunity of doing so with impunity. They would,\ntherefore, advise him to return to his territories, leaving part of\nhis troops with them for the use of the expedition. This advice pleased\nGaleazzo, who, in consequence, immediately withdrew to Milan. The\nFlorentine generals being now left without any hindrance, to show that\nthe cause assigned for their inaction was the true one, pressed the\nenemy more closely, so that they came to a regular engagement, which\ncontinued half a day, without either party yielding. Some horses were\nwounded and prisoners taken, but no death occurred. Winter having\narrived, and with it the usual time for armies to retire into quarters,\nBartolommeo Coglione withdrew to Ravenna, the Florentine forces into\nTuscany, and those of the king and duke, each to the territories of\ntheir sovereign. As this attempt had not occasioned any tumult in\nFlorence, contrary to the rebels' expectation, and the troops they had\nhired were in want of pay, terms of peace were proposed, and easily\narranged. The revolted Florentines, thus deprived of hope, dispersed\nthemselves in various places. Diotisalvi Neroni withdrew to Ferrara,\nwhere he was received and entertained by the Marquis Borso. Niccolo\nSoderini went to Ravenna, where, upon a small pension allowed by the\nVenetians, he grew old and died. He was considered a just and brave man,\nbut over-cautious and slow to determine, a circumstance which occasioned\nhim, when Gonfalonier of Justice, to lose the opportunity of victory\nwhich he would have gladly recovered when too late.\nUpon the restoration of peace, those who remained victorious in\nFlorence, as if unable to convince themselves they had conquered, unless\nthey oppressed not merely their enemies, but all whom they suspected,\nprevailed upon Bardo Altoviti, then Gonfalonier of Justice, to deprive\nmany of the honors of government, and to banish several more. They\nexercised their power so inconsiderately, and conducted themselves in\nsuch an arbitrary manner, that it seemed as if fortune and the Almighty\nhad given the city up to them for a prey. Piero knew little of these\nthings, and was unable to remedy even the little he knew, on account\nof his infirmities; his body being so contracted that he could use no\nfaculty but that of speech. All he could do was to admonish the leading\nmen, and beg they would conduct themselves with greater moderation, and\nnot by their violence effect their country's ruin. In order to divert\nthe city, he resolved to celebrate the marriage of his son Lorenzo\nwith Clarice degli Orsini with great splendor; and it was accordingly\nsolemnized with all the display suitable to the exalted rank of the\nparties. Feasts, dancing, and antique representations occupied many\ndays; at the conclusion of which, to exhibit the grandeur of the house\nof Medici and of the government, two military spectacles were presented,\none performed by men on horseback, who went through the evolutions of\na field engagement, and the other representing the storming of a\ntown; everything being conducted with admirable order and the greatest\nimaginable brilliancy.\nDuring these transactions in Florence, the rest of Italy, though at\npeace, was filled with apprehension of the power of the Turks, who\ncontinued to attack the Christians, and had taken Negropont, to the\ngreat disgrace and injury of the Christian name. About this time died\nBorso, marquis of Ferrara, who was succeeded by his brother Ercole.\nGismondo da Rimini, the inveterate enemy of the church also expired, and\nhis natural brother Roberto, who was afterward one of the best generals\nof Italy, succeeded him. Pope Paul died, and was succeeded by Sixtus IV.\npreviously called Francesco da Savona, a man of the very lowest origin,\nwho by his talents had become general of the order of St. Francis, and\nafterward cardinal. He was the first who began to show how far a pope\nmight go, and how much that which was previously regarded as sinful lost\nits iniquity when committed by a pontiff. Among others of his family\nwere Piero and Girolamo, who, according to universal belief, were his\nsons, though he designated them by terms reflecting less scandal on\nhis character. Piero being a priest, was advanced to the dignity of a\ncardinal, with the title of St. Sixtus. To Girolamo he gave the city\nof Furli, taken from Antonio Ordelaffi, whose ancestors had held that\nterritory for many generations. This ambitious method of procedure made\nhim more regarded by the princes of Italy, and all sought to obtain\nhis friendship. The duke of Milan gave his natural daughter Caterina to\nGirolamo, with the city of Imola, which he had taken from Taddeo degli\nAlidossi, as her portion. New matrimonial alliances were formed between\nthe duke and king Ferrando; Elisabetta, daughter of Alfonso, the king's\neldest son, being united to Giovan Galeazzo, the eldest son of the duke.\nItaly being at peace, the principal employment of her princes was to\nwatch each other, and strengthen their own influence by new alliances,\nleagues, or friendships. But in the midst of this repose, Florence\nendured great oppression from her principal citizens, and the\ninfirmities of Piero incapacitated him from restraining their ambition.\nHowever, to relieve his conscience, and, if possible, to make them\nashamed of their conduct, he sent for them to his house, and addressed\nthem in the following words: \"I never thought a time would come when the\nbehavior of my friends would compel me to esteem and desire the society\nof my enemies, and wish that I had been defeated rather than victorious;\nfor I believed myself to be associated with those who would set some\nbounds to their avarice, and who, after having avenged themselves on\ntheir enemies, and lived in their country with security and honor, would\nbe satisfied. But now I find myself greatly deceived, unacquainted with\nthe ambition of mankind, and least of all with yours; for, not satisfied\nwith being masters of so great a city, and possessing among yourselves\nthose honors, dignities, and emoluments which used to be divided among\nmany citizens; not contented with having shared among a few the property\nof your enemies, or with being able to oppress all others with public\nburdens, while you yourselves are exempt from them, and enjoy all the\npublic offices of profit you must still further load everyone with ill\nusage. You plunder your neighbors of their wealth; you sell justice;\nyou evade the law; you oppress the timid and exalt the insolent. Nor\nis there, throughout all Italy, so many and such shocking examples of\nviolence and avarice as in this city. Has our country fostered us only\nto be her destroyer? Have we been victorious only to effect her ruin?\nHas she honored us that we may overwhelm her with disgrace? Now, by that\nfaith which is binding upon all good men, I promise you, that if you\nstill conduct yourselves so as to make me regret my victory, I will\nadopt such measures as shall cause you bitterly to repent of having\nmisused it.\" The reply of the citizens accorded with the time and\ncircumstances, but they did not forego their evil practices; so that,\nin consequence, Piero sent for Agnolo Acciajuoli to come secretly to\nCafaggiolo, and discussed with him at great length the condition of the\ncity; and doubtless, had he not been prevented by death, he would have\ncalled home the exiles as a check upon the rapine of the opposite party.\nBut these honorable designs were frustrated; for, sinking under bodily\ninfirmities and mental anguish, he expired in the fifty-third year\nof his age. His goodness and virtue were not duly appreciated by his\ncountry, principally from his having, until almost the close of his\nlife, been associated with Cosmo, and the few years he survived being\nspent in civil discord and constant debility. Piero was buried in the\nchurch of St. Lorenzo, near his father, and his obsequies were performed\nwith all the pomp and solemnity due to his exalted station. He left two\nsons, Lorenzo and Guiliano, whose extreme youth excited alarm in the\nminds of thinking men, though each gave hopes of future usefulness to\nthe republic.\nAmong the principal citizens in the government of Florence, and very\nsuperior to the rest, was Tommaso Soderini, whose prudence and authority\nwere well known not only at home, but throughout Italy. After Piero's\ndeath, the whole city looked up to him; many citizens waited upon him\nat his own house, as the head of the government, and several princes\naddressed him by letter; but he, impartially estimating his own\nfortune and that of the house of Medici, made no reply to the princes'\ncommunications, and told the citizens, it was not his house, but that\nof the Medici they ought to visit. To demonstrate by his actions the\nsincerity and integrity of his advice he assembled all the heads of\nnoble families in the convent of St. Antonio, whither he also brought\nLorenzo and Guiliano de' Medici, and in a long and serious speech upon\nthe state of the city, the condition of Italy, and the views of her\nprinces, he assured them, that if they wished to live in peace and unity\nin Florence, free both from internal dissensions and foreign wars,\nit would be necessary to respect the sons of Piero and support the\nreputation of their house; for men never regret their continuance in a\ncourse sanctioned by custom while new methods are soon adopted and as\nspeedily set aside; and it has always been found easier to maintain a\npower which by its continuance has outlived envy, than to raise a new\none, which innumerable unforeseen causes may overthrow. When Tommaso\nhad concluded, Lorenzo spoke, and, though young, with such modesty and\ndiscretion that all present felt a presentiment of his becoming what he\nafterward proved to be; and before the citizens departed they swore to\nregard the youths as their sons, and the brothers promised to look upon\nthem as their parents. After this, Lorenzo and Guiliano were honored as\nprinces, and resolved to be guided by the advice of Tommaso Soderini.\nWhile profound tranquillity prevailed both at home and abroad, no wars\ndisturbing the general repose, there arose an unexpected disturbance,\nwhich came like a presage of future evils. Among the ruined families of\nthe party of Luca Pitti, was that of the Nardi; for Salvestro and his\nbrothers, the heads of the house, were banished and afterward declared\nrebels for having taken part in the war under Bartolommeo Coglione.\nBernardo, the brother of Salvestro, was young, prompt, and bold, and on\naccount of his poverty being unable to alleviate the sorrows of exile,\nwhile the peace extinguished all hopes of his return to the city, he\ndetermined to attempt some means of rekindling the war; for a trifling\ncommencement often produces great results, and men more readily\nprosecute what is already begun than originate new enterprises. Bernardo\nhad many acquaintances at Prato, and still more in the district of\nPistoia, particularly among the Palandra, a family which, though rustic,\nwas very numerous, and, like the rest of the Pistolesi, brought up to\nslaughter and war. These he knew to be discontented, on account of the\nFlorentine magistrates having endeavored, perhaps too severely, to check\ntheir partiality for inveterate feuds and consequence bloodshed. He was\nalso aware that the people of Prato considered themselves injured by the\npride and avarice of their governors, and that some were ill disposed\ntoward Florence; therefore all things considered, he hoped to be able to\nkindle a fire in Tuscany (should Prato rebel) which would be fostered\nby so many, that those who might wish to extinguish it would fail in the\nattempt. He communicated his ideas to Diotisalvi Neroni, and asked\nhim, in case they should succeed in taking possession of Prato, what\nassistance might be expected from the princes of Italy, by his means?\nDiotisalvi considered the enterprise as imminently dangerous, and almost\nimpracticable; but since it presented a fresh chance of attaining his\nobject, at the risk of others, he advised him to proceed, and promised\ncertain assistance from Bologna and Ferrara, if he could retain Prato\nnot less than fifteen days. Bernardo, whom this promise inspired with\na lively hope of success, proceeded secretly to Prato, and communicated\nwith those most disposed to favor him, among whom were the Palandra; and\nhaving arranged the time and plan, informed Diotisalvi of what had been\ndone.\nCHAPTER V\nBernardo takes possession of Prato, but is not assisted by the\ninhabitants--He is taken, and the tumult appeased--Corruption of\nFlorence--The duke of Milan in Florence--The church of Santo Spirito\ndestroyed by fire--The rebellion of Volterra, and the cause of\nit--Volterra reduced to obedience by force, in accordance with the\nadvice of Lorenzo de' Medici--Volterra pillaged.\nCesare Petrucci held the office of Provost of Prato for the Florentine\npeople, at this period. It is customary with governors of towns,\nsimilarly situated, to keep the keys of the gates near their persons;\nand whenever, in peaceful times, they are required by any of the\ninhabitants, for entrance or exit, they are usually allowed to be taken.\nBernardo was aware of this custom, and about daybreak, presented himself\nat the gate which looks toward Pistoia, accompanied by the Palandra and\nabout one hundred persons, all armed. Their confederates within the town\nalso armed themselves, and one of them asked the governor for the keys,\nalleging, as a pretext, that some one from the country wished to enter.\nThe governor not entertaining the slightest suspicion, sent a servant\nwith them. When at a convenient distance, they were taken by the\nconspirators, who, opening the gates, introduced Bernardo and his\nfollowers. They divided themselves into two parties, one of which, led\nby Salvestro, an inhabitant of Prato, took possession of the citadel;\nthe other following Bernardo, seized the palace, and placed Cesare with\nall his family in the custody of some of their number. They then raised\nthe cry of liberty, and proceeded through the town. It was now day,\nand many of the inhabitants hearing the disturbance, ran to the piazza\nwhere, learning that the fortress and the palace were taken and\nthe governor with all his people made prisoners, they were utterly\nastonished, and could not imagine how it had occurred. The eight\ncitizens, possessing the supreme authority, assembled in their palace\nto consider what was best to be done. In the meantime, Bernardo and his\nfollowers, on going round the town, found no encouragement, and being\ntold that the Eight had assembled, went and declared the nature of\ntheir enterprise, which he said was to deliver the country from slavery,\nreminding them how glorious it would be for those who took arms to\neffect such an honorable object, for they would thus obtain permanent\nrepose and everlasting fame. He called to recollection their ancient\nliberty and present condition, and assured them of certain assistance,\nif they would only, for a few days, aid in resisting the forces the\nFlorentines might send against them. He said he had friends in Florence\nwho would join them as soon as they found the inhabitants resolved to\nsupport him. His speech did not produce the desired effect upon the\nEight, who replied that they knew not whether Florence was free or\nenslaved, for that was a matter which they were not called upon to\ndecide; but this they knew very well, that for their own part, they\ndesired no other liberty than to obey the magistrates who governed\nFlorence, from whom they had never received any injury sufficient\nto make them desire a change. They therefore advised him to set the\ngovernor at liberty, clear the place of his people, and, as quickly as\npossible, withdraw from the danger he had so rashly incurred. Bernardo\nwas not daunted by these words, but determined to try whether fear\ncould influence the people of Prato, since entreaties produced so little\neffect. In order to terrify them, he determined to put Cesare to death,\nand having brought him out of prison, ordered him to be hanged at the\nwindows of the palace. He was already led to the spot with a halter\naround his neck, when seeing Bernardo giving directions to hasten\nhis end, he turned to him, and said: \"Bernardo, you put me to death,\nthinking that the people of Prato will follow you; but the direct\ncontrary will result; for the respect they have for the rectors which\nthe Florentine people send here is so great, that as soon as they\nwitness the injury inflicted upon me, they will conceive such a disgust\nagainst you as will inevitably effect your ruin. Therefore, it is not\nby my death, but by the preservation of my life, that you can attain the\nobject you have in view; for if I deliver your commands, they will be\nmuch more readily obeyed, and following your directions, we shall soon\nattain the completion of your design.\" Bernardo, whose mind was not\nfertile in expedients, thought the advice good, and commanded Cesare, on\nbeing conducted to a veranda which looked upon the piazza, to order the\npeople of Prato to obey him, and having done which, Cesare was led back\nto prison.\nThe weakness of the conspirators was obvious; and many Florentines\nresiding in the town, assembled together, among whom, Giorgio Ginori, a\nknight of Rhodes, took arms first against them, and attacked Bernardo,\nwho traversed the piazza, alternately entreating and threatening those\nwho refused to obey him, and being surrounded by Giorgio's followers, he\nwas wounded and made prisoner. This being done, it was easy to set the\ngovernor at liberty and subdue the rest, who being few, and divided into\nseveral parties, were nearly all either secured or slain. An exaggerated\nreport of these transactions reached Florence, it being told there that\nPrato was taken, the governor and his friends put to death, and the\nplace filled with the enemy; and that Pistoia was also in arms, and\nmost of the citizens in the conspiracy. In consequence of this alarming\naccount, the palace as quickly filled with citizens, who consulted with\nthe Signory what course ought to be adopted. At this time, Roberto da\nSan Severino, one of the most distinguished generals of this period,\nwas at Florence, and it was therefore determined to send him, with what\nforces could be collected, to Prato, with orders that he should approach\nthe place, particularly observe what was going on, and provide such\nremedies as the necessity of the case and his own prudence should\nsuggest. Roberto had scarcely passed the fortress of Campi, when he was\nmet by a messenger from the governor, who informed him that Bernardo was\ntaken, his followers either dispersed or slain, and everything restored\nto order. He consequently returned to Florence, whither Bernardo was\nshortly after conveyed, and when questioned by the magistracy concerning\nthe real motives of such a weak conspiracy, he said, he had undertaken\nit, because, having resolved to die in Florence rather than live in\nexile, he wished his death to be accompanied by some memorable action.\nThis disturbance having been raised and quelled almost at the same time,\nthe citizens returned to their accustomed mode of life, hoping to enjoy,\nwithout anxiety, the state they had now established and confirmed. Hence\narose many of those evils which usually result from peace; for the youth\nhaving become more dissolute than before, more extravagant in dress,\nfeasting, and other licentiousness, and being without employment, wasted\ntheir time and means on gaming and women; their principal study being\nhow to appear splendid in apparel, and attain a crafty shrewdness in\ndiscourse; he who could make the most poignant remark being considered\nthe wisest, and being most respected. These manners derived additional\nencouragement from the followers of the duke of Milan, who, with his\nduchess and the whole ducal court, as it was said, to fulfill a vow,\ncame to Florence, where he was received with all the pomp and respect\ndue to so great a prince, and one so intimately connected with\nthe Florentine people. Upon this occasion the city witnessed an\nunprecedented exhibition; for, during Lent, when the church commands us\nto abstain from animal food, the Milanese, without respect for either\nGod or his church, ate of it daily. Many spectacles were exhibited in\nhonor of the duke, and among others, in the temple of Santo Spirito,\nwas represented the descent of the Holy Ghost among the apostles; and\nin consequence of the numerous fires used upon the occasion, some of the\nwoodwork became ignited, and the church was completely destroyed by the\nflames. Many thought that the Almighty being offended at our misconduct,\ntook this method of signifying his displeasure. If, therefore, the duke\nfound the city full of courtly delicacies, and customs unsuitable to\nwell-regulated conduct, he left it in a much worse state. Hence the good\ncitizens thought it necessary to restrain these improprieties, and made\na law to put a stop to extravagance in dress, feasts, and funerals.\nIn the midst of this universal peace, a new and unexpected disturbance\narose in Tuscany. Certain citizens of Volterra had discovered an\nalum-mine in their district, and being aware of the profit derivable\nfrom it, in order to obtain the means of working and securing it, they\napplied to some Florentines, and allowed them to share in the profits.\nThis, as is frequently the case with new undertakings, at first excited\nlittle attention from the people of Volterra; but in time, finding\nthe profits derived from it had become considerable, they fruitlessly\nendeavored to effect what at first might have been easily accomplished.\nThey began by agitating the question in their councils, declaring it\ngrossly improper that a source of wealth discovered in the public lands\nshould be converted to the emolument of private individuals. They\nnext sent advocates to Florence, and the question was referred to the\nconsideration of certain citizens, who, either through being bribed by\nthe party in possession, or from a sincere conviction, declared the\naim of the people of Volterra to be unjust in desiring to deprive their\ncitizens of the fruit of their labor; and decided that the alum-pit was\nthe rightful property of those who had hitherto wrought it; but, at\nthe same time, recommended them to pay an annual sum by way of\nacknowledgment to the city. This answer instead of abating, served only\nto increase the animosities and tumult in Volterra, and absorbed entire\nattention both in the councils and throughout the city; the people\ndemanding the restitution of what they considered their due, and\nthe proprietors insisting upon their right to retain what they had\noriginally acquired, and what had been subsequently been confirmed\nto them by the decision of the Florentines. In the midst of these\ndisturbances, a respectable citizen, named Il Pecorino, was killed,\ntogether with several others, who had embraced the same side, whose\nhouses were also plundered and burned; and the fury of the mob rose to\nsuch a height, that they were with difficulty restrained from putting\nthe Florentine rectors to death.\nAfter the first outrage, the Volterrani immediately determined to send\nambassadors to Florence, who intimated, that if the Signory would allow\nthem their ancient privileges, the city would remain subject to them as\nformerly. Many and various were the opinions concerning the reply to be\nmade. Tommaso Soderini advised that they should accept the submission\nof the people of Volterra, upon any conditions with which they were\ndisposed to make it; for he considered it unreasonable and unwise to\nkindle a flame so near home that it might burn their own dwelling; he\nsuspected the pope's ambition, and was apprehensive of the power of the\nking; nor could he confide in the friendship either of the duke or the\nVenetians, having no assurance of the sincerity of the latter, or the\nvalor of the former. He concluded by quoting that trite proverb, \"Meglio\nun magro accordo che una grassa vittoria.\"[*] On the other hand, Lorenzo\nde' Medici, thinking this an opportunity for exhibiting his prudence\nand wisdom, and being strenuously supported by those who envied the\ninfluence of Tommaso Soderini, resolved to march against them, and\npunish the arrogance of the people of Volterra with arms; declaring\nthat if they were not made a striking example, others would, without\nthe least fear or respect, upon every slight occasion, adopt a similar\ncourse. The enterprise being resolved on, the Volterrani were told that\nthey could not demand the observance of conditions which they themselves\nhad broken, and therefore must either submit to the direction of the\nSignory or expect war. With this answer they returned to their city, and\nprepared for its defense; fortifying the place, and sending to all the\nprinces of Italy to request assistance, none of whom listened to them,\nexcept the Siennese and the lord of Piombino, who gave them some hope\nof aid. The Florentines on the other hand, thinking success dependent\nprincipally upon celerity, assembled ten thousand foot and two thousand\nhorse, who, under the command of Federigo, lord of Urbino, marched into\nthe country of Volterra and quickly took entire possession of it. They\nthen encamped before the city, which, being in a lofty situation, and\nprecipitous on all sides, could only be approached by a narrow pass\nnear the church of St. Alessandro. The Volterrani had engaged for\ntheir defense about one thousand mercenaries, who, perceiving the great\nsuperiority of the Florentines, found the place untenable, and were\ntardy in their defensive operations, but indefatigable in the constant\ninjuries they committed upon the people of the place. Thus these poor\ncitizens were harassed by the enemy without, and by their own soldiery\nwithin; so, despairing of their safety, they began to think of a\ncapitulation; and, being unable to obtain better terms, submitted to the\ndiscretion of the Florentine commissaries, who ordered the gates to\nbe opened, and introduced the greater part of their forces. They then\nproceeded to the palace, and commanded the priors to retire to their\nhomes; and, on the way thither, one of them was in derision stripped\nby the soldiers. From this beginning (so much more easily are men\npredisposed to evil than to good) originated the pillage and destruction\nof the city; which for a whole day suffered the greatest horrors,\nneither women nor sacred places being spared; and the soldiery, those\nengaged for its defense as well as its assailants, plundered all that\ncame within their reach. The news of this victory was received with\ngreat joy at Florence, and as the expedition had been undertaken wholly\nby the advice of Lorenzo, he acquired great reputation. Upon which one\nof the intimate friends of Tommaso Soderini, reminding him of the advice\nhe had given, asked him what he thought of the taking of Volterra; to\nwhich he replied, \"To me the place seems rather lost than won; for had\nit been received on equitable terms, advantage and security would have\nbeen the result; but having to retain it by force it will in critical\njunctures, occasion weakness and anxiety, and in times of peace, injury\nand expense.\"\n[*] A lean peace is better than a fat victory.\nCHAPTER VI\nOrigin of the animosity between Sixtus IV. and Lorenzo de' Medici--Carlo\ndi Braccio da Perugia attacks the Siennese--Carlo retires by desire\nof the Florentines--Conspiracy against Galeazzo, duke of Milan--His\nvices--He is slain by the conspirators--Their deaths.\nThe pope, anxious to retain the territories of the church in obedience,\nhad caused Spoleto to be sacked for having, through internal factions,\nfallen into rebellion. Citta di Castello being in the same state of\ncontumacy, he besieged that place; and Niccolo Vitelli its prince, being\non intimate terms with Lorenzo de' Medici, obtained assistance from\nhim, which, though inadequate, was quite enough to originate that enmity\nbetween Sixtus IV. and the Medici afterward productive of such unhappy\nresults. Nor would this have been so long in development had not the\ndeath of Frate Piero, cardinal of St. Sixtus, taken place; who, after\nhaving traveled over Italy and visited Venice and Milan (under the\npretense of doing honor to the marriage of Ercole, marquis of Ferrara),\nwent about sounding the minds of the princes, to learn how they were\ndisposed toward the Florentines. But upon his return he died, not\nwithout suspicion of having been poisoned by the Venetians, who found\nthey would have reason to fear Sixtus if he were allowed to avail\nhimself of the talents and exertions of Frate Piero. Although of very\nlow extraction, and meanly brought up within the walls of a convent,\nhe had no sooner attained the distinction of the scarlet hat, than\nhe exhibited such inordinate pride and ambition, that the pontificate\nseemed too little for him, and he gave a feast in Rome which would\nhave seemed extraordinary even for a king, the expense exceeding twenty\nthousand florins. Deprived of this minister, the designs of Sixtus\nproceeded with less promptitude. The Florentines, the duke, and the\nVenetians having renewed their league, and allowed the pope and the king\nto join them if they thought proper, the two latter also entered into\na league, reserving an opening for the others if they were desirous\nto become parties to it. Italy was thus divided in two factions; for\ncircumstances daily arose which occasioned ill feeling between the two\nleagues; as occurred with respect to the island of Cyprus, to which\nFerrando laid claim, and the Venetians occupied. Thus the pope and the\nking became more closely united. Federigo, prince of Urbino, was at\nthis time one of the first generals of Italy; and had long served the\nFlorentines. In order, if possible, to deprive the hostile league of\ntheir captain, the pope advised, and the king requested him to pay\na visit to them. To the surprise and displeasure of the Florentines,\nFederigo complied; for they thought the same fate awaited him as had\nbefallen Niccolo Piccinino. However, the result was quite different;\nfor he returned from Naples and Rome greatly honored, and with the\nappointment of general to their forces. They also endeavored to gain\nover to their interest the lords of Romagna and the Siennese, that they\nmight more easily injure the Florentines, who, becoming aware of these\nthings, used their utmost endeavors to defend themselves against the\nambition of their enemies; and having lost Federigo d'Urbino, they\nengaged Roberto da Rimino in his place, renewed the league with the\nPerugini and formed one with the prince of Faenza. The pope and the king\nassigned, as the reasons of their animosity against the Florentines,\nthat they wished to withdraw them from the Venetian alliance, and\nassociate them with their own league; for the pope did not think the\nchurch could maintain her reputation, nor the Count Girolamo retain\nthe states of Romagna, while the Florentines and the Venetians remained\nunited. The Florentines conjectured their design was to set them at\nenmity with the Venetians, not so much for the sake of gaining their\nfriendship as to be able the more easily to injure them. Two years\npassed away in these jealousies and discontents before any disturbance\nbroke out; but the first which occurred, and that but trivial, took\nplace in Tuscany.\nBraccio of Perugia, whom we have frequently mentioned as one of the\nmost distinguished warriors of Italy, left two sons, Oddo and Carlo; the\nlatter was of tender years; the former, as above related, was slain by\nthe people of Val di Lamona; but Carlo, when he came to mature age, was\nby the Venetians, out of respect for the memory of his father, and the\nhopes they entertained from himself, received among the condottieri of\ntheir republic. The term of his engagement having expired, he did not\ndesign to renew it immediately, but resolved to try if, by his own\ninfluence and his father's reputation, he could recover possession of\nPerugia. To this the Venetians willingly consented, for they usually\nextended their dominion by any changes that occurred in the neighboring\nstates. Carlo consequently came into Tuscany, but found more\ndifficulties in his attempt upon Perugia than he had anticipated, on\naccount of its being allied with the Florentines; and desirous of doing\nsomething worthy of memory, he made war upon the Siennese, alleging\nthem to be indebted to him for services performed by his father in the\naffairs of that republic, and attacked them with such impetuosity as to\nthreaten the total overthrow of their dominion. The Siennese, ever ready\nto suspect the Florentines, persuaded themselves that this outrage had\nbeen committed with their cognizance, and made heavy complaints to the\npope and the king against them. They also sent ambassadors to Florence\nto complain of the injuries they had suffered, and adroitly intimated,\nthat if Carlo had not been secretly supported he could not have made\nwar upon them with such perfect security. The Florentines denied all\nparticipation in the proceedings of Carlo, expressed their most earnest\nwish to do everything in their power to put a stop to them, and allowed\nthe ambassadors to use whatever terms they pleased in the name of\nthe Signory, to command him to desist. Carlo complained that the\nFlorentines, by their unwillingness to support him, had deprived\nthemselves of a most valuable acquisition and him of great glory; for he\ncould have insured them the possession of the whole territory in a\nshort time, from the want of courage in the people and the ineffectual\nprovision they had made for their defense. He then withdrew to his\nengagement under the Venetians; but the Siennese, although delivered\nfrom such imminent peril by the Florentines, were still very indignant\nagainst them; considering themselves under no obligation to those who\nhad delivered them from an evil to which they had first exposed them.\nWhile the transactions between the king and the pope were in progress,\nand those in Tuscany in the manner we have related, an event of greater\nimportance occurred in Lombardy. Cola Montano, a learned and ambitious\nman, taught the Latin language to the youth of the principal families in\nMilan. Either out of hatred to the character and manners of the duke, or\nfrom some other cause, he constantly deprecated the condition of those\nwho live under a bad prince; calling those glorious and happy who had\nthe good fortune to be born and live in a republic. He endeavored to\nshow that the most celebrated men had been produced in republics, and\nnot reared under princes; that the former cherish virtue, while the\nlatter destroy it; the one deriving advantage from virtuous men,\nwhile the latter naturally fear them. The youths with whom he was most\nintimate were Giovanni Andrea Lampognano, Carlo Visconti, and Girolamo\nOgliato. He frequently discussed with them the faults of their prince,\nand the wretched condition of those who were subject to him; and by\nconstantly inculcating his principles, acquired such an ascendancy over\ntheir minds as to induce them to bind themselves by oath to effect the\nduke's destruction, as soon as they became old enough to attempt it.\nTheir minds being fully occupied with this design, which grew with\ntheir years, the duke's conduct and their own private injuries served to\nhasten its execution. Galeazzo was licentious and cruel, of both which\nvices he had given such repeated proofs, that he became odious to all.\nNot content with corrupting the wives of the nobility, he also took\npleasure in making it notorious; nor was he satisfied with murdering\nindividuals unless he effected their deaths by some unusual cruelty. He\nwas suspected of having destroyed his own mother; for, not considering\nhimself prince while she was present, he conducted himself in such a\nmanner as induced her to withdraw from his court, and, travelling toward\nCremona, which she obtained as part of her marriage portion, she was\nseized with a sudden illness, and died upon the road; which made many\nthink her son had caused her death. The duke had dishonored both Carlo\nand Girolamo in respect to their wives or other female relatives, and\nhad refused to concede to Giovanandrea possession of the monastery of\nMiramondo, of which he had obtained a grant from the pope for a near\nrelative. These private injuries increased the young men's desire for\nvengeance, and the deliverance of their country from so many evils;\ntrusting that whenever they should succeed in destroying the duke, many\nof the nobility and all the people would rise in their defense. Being\nresolved upon their undertaking, they were often together, which, on\naccount of their long intimacy, did not excite any suspicion. They\nfrequently discussed the subject; and in order to familiarize their\nminds with the deed itself, they practiced striking each other in the\nbreast and in the side with the sheathed daggers intended to be used for\nthe purpose. On considering the most suitable time and place, the castle\nseemed insecure; during the chase, uncertain and dangerous; while going\nabout the city for his own amusement, difficult if not impracticable;\nand, at a banquet, of doubtful result. They, therefore, determined to\nkill him upon the occasion of some procession or public festivity when\nthere would be no doubt of his presence, and where they might, under\nvarious pretexts, assemble their friends. It was also resolved that\nif one of their number were prevented from attending, on any account\nwhatever, the rest should put him to death in the midst of their armed\nenemies.\nIt was now the close of the year 1476, near Christmas, and as it was\ncustomary for the duke to go upon St. Stephen's day, in great solemnity,\nto the church of that martyr, they considered this the most suitable\nopportunity for the execution of their design. Upon the morning of that\nday they ordered some of their most trusty friends and servants to arm,\ntelling them they wished to go to the assistance of Giovanandrea,\nwho, contrary to the wish of some of his neighbors, intended to turn a\nwatercourse into his estate; but that before they went they wished to\ntake leave of the prince. They also assembled, under various\npretenses, other friends and relatives, trusting that when the deed\nwas accomplished, everyone would join them in the completion of their\nenterprise. It was their intention, after the duke's death, to collect\ntheir followers together and proceed to those parts of the city where\nthey imagined the plebeians would be most disposed to take arms against\nthe duchess and the principal ministers of state, and they thought the\npeople, on account of the famine which then prevailed, would easily be\ninduced to follow them; for it was their design to give up the houses of\nCecco Simonetta, Giovanni Botti, and Francesco Lucani, all leading men\nin the government, to be plundered, and by this means gain over the\npopulace and restore liberty to the community. With these ideas, and\nwith minds resolved upon their execution, Giovanandrea, together with\nthe rest, were early at the church, and heard mass together; after\nwhich, Giovanandrea, turning to a statue of St. Ambrose, said, \"O patron\nof our city! thou knowest our intention, and the end we would attain,\nby so many dangers; favor our enterprise, and prove, by protecting the\noppressed, that tyranny is offensive to thee.\" To the duke, on the other\nhand, when intending to go to the church, many omens occurred of his\napproaching death; for in the morning, having put on a cuirass, as was\nhis frequent custom, he immediately took it off again, either because\nit inconvenienced him, or that he did not like its appearance. He\nthen wished to hear mass in the castle, and found that the priest who\nofficiated in the chapel had gone to St. Stephen's, and had taken with\nhim the sacred utensils. On this he desired the service to be performed\nby the bishop of Como, who acquainted him with preventing circumstances.\nThus, almost compelled, he determined to go to the church; but before\nhis departure, caused his sons, Giovan Galeazzo and Ermes, to be brought\nto him, whom he embraced and kissed several times, seeming reluctant to\npart with them. He then left the castle, and, with the ambassadors\nof Ferrara and Mantua on either hand, proceeded to St. Stephen's. The\nconspirators, to avoid exciting suspicion, and to escape the cold, which\nwas very severe, had withdrawn to an apartment of the archpriest, who\nwas a friend of theirs, but hearing the duke's approach, they came into\nthe church, Giovanandrea and Girolamo placing themselves upon the\nright hand of the entrance, and Carlo on the left. Those who led\nthe procession had already entered, and were followed by the duke,\nsurrounded by such a multitude as is usual on similar occasions. The\nfirst attack was made by Lampognano and Girolamo, who, pretending to\nclear the way for the prince, came close to him, and grasping their\ndaggers, which, being short and sharp, were concealed in the sleeves of\ntheir vests, struck at him. Lampognano gave him two wounds, one in the\nbelly, the other in the throat. Girolamo struck him in the throat and\nbreast. Carlo Visconti, being nearer the door, and the duke having\npassed, could not wound him in front: but with two strokes,\ntranspierced his shoulder and spine. These six wounds were inflicted\nso instantaneously, that the duke had fallen before anyone was aware of\nwhat had happened, and he expired, having only once ejaculated the\nname of the Virgin, as if imploring her assistance. A great tumult\nimmediately ensued, several swords were drawn, and as often happens in\nsudden emergencies, some fled from the church, and others ran toward the\nscene of tumult, both without any definite motive or knowledge of what\nhad occurred. Those, however, who were nearest the duke and had seen\nhim slain, recognizing the murderers, pursued them. Giovanandrea,\nendeavoring to make his way out of the church, proceeded among the\nwomen, who being numerous, and according to their custom, seated upon\nthe ground, was prevented in his progress by their apparel, and being\novertaken, he was killed by a Moor, one of the duke's footmen. Carlo was\nslain by those immediately around him. Girolamo Olgiato passed through\nthe crowd, and got out of the church; but seeing his companions dead,\nand not knowing where else to go, he proceeded home, where his father\nand brothers refused to receive him; his mother only, having compassion\non her son recommended him to a priest, an old friend of the family,\nwho, disguising him in his own apparel, led him to his house. Here he\nremained two days, not without hope that some disturbance might arise\nin Milan which would contribute to his safety. This not occurring, and\napprehensive that his hiding place would be discovered, he endeavored\nto escape in disguise, but being observed, he was given over to justice,\nand disclosed all the particulars of the conspiracy. Girolamo was\ntwenty-three years of age, and exhibited no less composure at his death\nthan resolution in his previous conduct, for being stripped of his\napparel, and in the hands of the executioner, who stood by with\nthe sword unsheathed, ready to deprive him of life, he repeated the\nfollowing words, in the Latin tongue, in which he was well versed: \"Mors\nacerba, fama perpetua, stabit vetus memoria facti.\"\nThe enterprise of these unfortunate young men was conducted with secrecy\nand executed with resolution; and they failed for want of the support\nof those whom they expected would rise in their defense. Let princes\ntherefore learn to live, so as to render themselves beloved and\nrespected by their subjects, that none may have hope of safety after\nhaving destroyed them; and let others see how vain is the expectation\nwhich induces them to trust so much to the multitude, as to believe,\nthat even when discontented, they will either embrace or ward off their\ndangers. This event spread consternation all over Italy; but those\nwhich shortly afterward occurred in Florence caused much more alarm, and\nterminated a peace of twelve years' continuance, as will be shown in the\nfollowing book; which, having commenced with blood and horror, will have\na melancholy and tearful conclusion.\nBOOK VIII\nCHAPTER I\nState of the family of the Medici at Florence--Enmity of Sixtus IV.\ntoward Florence--Differences between the family of the Pazzi and that\nof the Medici--Beginning of the conspiracy of the Pazzi--Arrangements to\neffect the design of the conspiracy--Giovanni Batista da Montesecco\nis sent to Florence--The pope joins the conspiracy--The king of Naples\nbecomes a party to it--Names of the conspirators--The conspirators make\nmany ineffectual attempts to kill Lorenzo and Giuliano de' Medici--The\nfinal arrangement--Order of the conspiracy.\nThis book, commencing between two conspiracies, the one at Milan already\nnarrated, the other yet to be recorded, it would seem appropriate, and\nin accordance with our usual custom, were we to treat of the nature and\nimportance of these terrible demonstrations. This we should willingly do\nhad we not discussed the matter elsewhere, or could it be comprised in\nfew words. But requiring much consideration, and being already noticed\nin another place, it will be omitted, and we shall proceed with our\nnarrative. The government of the Medici having subdued all its avowed\nenemies in order to obtain for that family undivided authority, and\ndistinguish them from other citizens in their relation to the rest,\nfound it necessary to subdue those who secretly plotted against them.\nWhile Medici contended with other families, their equals in authority\nand reputation, those who envied their power were able to oppose them\nopenly without danger of being suppressed at the first demonstration of\nhostility; for the magistrates being free, neither party had occasion to\nfear, till one or other of them was overcome. But after the victory of\n1466, the government became so entirely centred in the Medici, and\nthey acquired so much authority, that discontented spirits were obliged\neither to suffer in silence, or, if desirous to destroy them, to attempt\nit in secrecy, and by clandestine means; which plots rarely succeed and\nmost commonly involve the ruin of those concerned in them, while they\nfrequently contribute to the aggrandizement of those against whom they\nare directed. Thus the prince of a city attacked by a conspiracy, if\nnot slain like the duke of Milan (which seldom happens), almost always\nattains to a greater degree of power, and very often has his good\ndisposition perverted to evil. The proceedings of his enemies give him\ncause for fear; fear suggests the necessity of providing for his\nown safety, which involves the injury of others; and hence arise\nanimosities, and not unfrequently his ruin. Thus these conspiracies\nquickly occasion the destruction of their contrivers, and, in time,\ninevitably injure their primary object.\nItaly, as we have seen above, was divided into two factions; the pope\nand the king on one side; on the other, the Venetians, the duke, and the\nFlorentines. Although the flames of war had not yet broken out, every\nday gave rise to some new occasion for rekindling them; and the pope,\nin particular, in all his plans endeavored to annoy the Florentine\ngovernment. Thus Filippo de' Medici, archbishop of Pisa, being dead,\nFrancesco Salviati, a declared enemy of the Medici, was appointed his\nsuccessor, contrary to the wish of the Signory of Florence, who being\nunwilling to give him possession, there arose between them and the pope\nmany fresh grounds of offense, before the matter was settled. Besides\nthis, he conferred, at Rome, many favors upon the family of the Pazzi,\nand opposed that of the Medici, whenever an opportunity offered. The\nPazzi were at this time, both on account of nobility of birth and their\ngreat wealth, the most brilliant in France. The head of this family was\nJacopo, whom the people, on account of his distinguished pre-eminence,\nhad made a knight. He had no children, except one natural daughter, but\nmany nephews, sons of his brothers Piero and Antonio, the first of whom\nwere Guglielmo, Francesco, Rinato, Giovanni, and then, Andrea, Niccolo,\nand Galeotto. Cosmo de' Medici, noticing the riches and rank of this\nfamily, had given his granddaughter, Bianca, to Guglielmo, hoping\nby this marriage to unite the houses, and obviate those enmities and\ndissensions so frequently occasioned by jealousy. However (so uncertain\nand fallacious are our expectations), very different feelings were thus\noriginated; for Lorenzo's advisers pointed out to him how dangerous\nit was, and how injurious to his authority, to unite in the same\nindividuals so much wealth and power. In consequence, neither Jacopo\nnor his nephews obtained those degrees of honor, which in the opinion of\nother citizens were their due. This gave rise to anger in the Pazzi, and\nfear on the part of the Medici; as the former of these increased, so did\nthe latter; and upon all occasions, when the Pazzi came in competition\nwith other citizens, their claims to distinction, however strong, were\nset aside by the magistracy. Francesco de' Pazzi, being at Rome, the\nCouncil of Eight, upon some trivial occasion, compelled him to return,\nwithout treating him with the respect usually observed toward great\ncitizens, so that the Pazzi everywhere bitterly complained of the\nill usage they experienced, and thus excited suspicion in others, and\nbrought down greater evils upon themselves. Giovanni de' Pazzi had\nmarried the daughter of Giovanni Buonromei, a very wealthy man, whose\nriches on his decease, without other children, came to his daughter. His\nnephew, Carlo, however, took possession of part, and the question being\nlitigated, a law was passed, by virtue of which the wife of Giovanni de'\nPazzi was robbed of her inheritance, and it was given to Carlo. In this\npiece of injustice the Pazzi at once recognized the influence of the\nMedici. Giuliano de' Medici often complained to his brother Lorenzo of\nthe affair, saying he was afraid that by grasping at too much they would\nlose all.\nLorenzo, flushed with youth and power, would assume the direction of\neverything, and resolved that all transactions should bear an impress\nof his influence. The Pazzi, with their nobility and wealth unable to\nendure so many affronts, began to devise some means of vengeance. The\nfirst who spoke of any attempt against the Medici, was Francesco, who,\nbeing more sensitive and resolute than the others, determined either to\nobtain what was withheld from him, or lose what he still possessed. As\nthe government of Florence gave him great offense, he resided almost\nconstantly at Rome, where, like other Florentine merchants, he conducted\nextensive commercial operations; and being a most intimate friend of\nCount Girolamo, they frequently complained to each other of the conduct\nof the Medici. After a while they began to think that for the count to\nretain his estates, or the Pazzi their rights in the city, it would be\nnecessary to change the government of Florence; and this they considered\ncould not be done without the death of Giuliano and Lorenzo. They\nimagined the pope and the king would be easily induced to consent,\nbecause each could be convinced of the facility of the enterprise.\nHaving acquired these ideas, they communicated them to Francesco\nSalviati, archbishop of Pisa, who, being ambitious and recently offended\nby the Medici, willingly adopted their views. Considering their next\nstep, they resolved, in order to facilitate the design, to obtain the\nconsent of Jacopo de' Pazzi, without whose concurrence they feared it\nwould be impracticable. With this view, it was resolved that Francesco\nde' Pazzi should go to Florence, while the archbishop and the count\nwere to remain at Rome, to be ready to communicate with the pope when\na suitable opportunity occurred. Francesco found Jacopo de' Pazzi more\ncautious and difficult to persuade than he could have wished, and on\nimparting this to his friends at Rome, it was thought he desired the\nsanction of some greater authority to induce him to adopt their views.\nUpon this, the archbishop and the count communicated the whole affair to\nGiovanni Batista da Montesecco, a leader of the papal forces, possessing\nmilitary reputation, and under obligations to the pope and the count.\nTo him the affair seemed difficult and dangerous, while the archbishop\nendeavored to obviate his objections by showing how much assistance\nthe pope and the king would lend to the enterprise; the hatred of the\nFlorentines toward the Medici, the numerous friends the Salviati and\nthe Pazzi would bring with them, the readiness with which the young men\nmight be slain, on account of their going about the city unaccompanied\nand without suspicion, and the facility with which the government\nmight then be changed. These things Giovanni Batista did not in\nreality believe, for he had heard from many Florentines quite contrary\nstatements.\nWhile occupied with these deliberations, Carlo, lord of Faenza, was\ntaken ill, and tears were entertained for his life. This circumstance\nseemed to the archbishop and the count to offer an opportunity for\nsending Giovanni Batista to Florence, and thence to Romagna, under\npretence of recovering certain territories belonging to the latter,\nof which the lord of Faenza had taken possession. The count therefore\ncommissioned Giovanni Batista to have an interview with Lorenzo de'\nMedici, and on his part request his advice how to proceed with respect\nto the affair of Romagna; that he should then see Francesco de' Pazzi,\nand in conjunction with him endeavor to induce his uncle Jacopo to adopt\ntheir ideas. To render the pope's authority available in their behalf,\nGiovanni Batista was ordered, before his departure, to communicate with\nthe pontiff, who offered every means at his disposal in favor of their\nenterprise. Giovanni Batista, having arrived at Florence, obtained an\ninterview with Lorenzo, by whom he was most graciously received; and\nwith regard to the advice he was commissioned to ask, obtained a wise\nand friendly answer; so that he was astonished at finding him quite a\ndifferent character from what he had been represented, and considered\nhim to possess great sagacity, an affectionate heart, and most amicably\ndisposed toward the count. He found Francesco de' Pazzi had gone to\nLucca, and spoke to Jacopo, who was at first quite opposed to their\ndesign, but before they parted the pope's authority seemed to have\ninfluenced him; for he told Giovanni Batista, that he might go to\nRomagna, and that before his return Francesco would be with him, and\nthey would then consult more particularly upon the subject. Giovanni\nBatista proceeded to Romagna, and soon returned to Florence. After\na pretended consultation with Lorenzo, upon the count's affairs, he\nobtained an interview with Francesco and Jacopo de' Pazzi, when the\nlatter gave his consent to their enterprise. They then discussed the\nmeans of carrying it into effect. Jacopo de' Pazzi was of opinion that\nit could not be effected while both the brothers remained at Florence;\nand therefore it would be better to wait till Lorenzo went to Rome,\nwhither it was reported he had an intention of going; for then their\nobject would be more easily attained. Francesco de' Pazzi had no\nobjection to Lorenzo being at Rome, but if he were to forego the\njourney, he thought that both the brothers might be slain, either at\na marriage, or at a play, or in a church. With regard to foreign\nassistance, he supposed the pope might assemble forces for the conquest\nof the fortress of Montone, being justified in taking it from Count\nCarlo, who had caused the tumults already spoken of in Sienna and\nPerugia.\nStill no definite arrangement was made; but it was resolved that\nGiovanni Batista and Francesco de' Pazzi should go to Rome and settle\neverything with the pontiff. The matter was again debated at Rome; and\nat length it was concluded that besides an expedition against Montone,\nGiovan Francesco da Tolentino, a leader of the papal troops, should go\ninto Romagna, and Lorenzo da Castello to the Val di Tavere; that each,\nwith the forces of the country, should hold himself in readiness to\nperform the commands of the archbishop de' Salviati and Francesco\nde Pazzi, both of whom were to come to Florence, and provide for the\nexecution of their design, with the assistance of Giovanni Batista da\nMontesecco. King Ferrando promised, by his ambassador, to contribute all\nin his power to the success of their undertaking. Francesco de' Pazzi\nand the archbishop having arrived at Florence, prevailed upon Jacopo\ndi Poggio, a well educated youth, but ambitious and very desirous\nof change, to join them, and two others, each of the name of Jacopo\nSalviati, one a brother, the other a kinsman, of the archbishop. They\nalso gained over Bernardo Bandini and Napoleone Franzeni, two bold young\nmen, under great obligations to the family of the Pazzi. Besides those\nalready mentioned, they were joined by Antonio da Volterra and a priest\nnamed Stefano, who taught Latin to the daughter of Jacopo de' Pazzi.\nRinato de' Pazzi, a grave and prudent man, being quite aware of the\nevils resulting from such undertakings, refused all participation in the\nconspiracy; he held it in abhorrence, and as much as possible, without\nbetraying his kinsmen, endeavored to counteract it.\nThe pope had sent Raffaello di Riario, a nephew of Count Girolamo, to\nthe college of Pisa, to study canon law, and while there, had advanced\nhim to the dignity of a cardinal. The conspirators determined to bring\nthis cardinal to Florence, as they would thus be better able to conceal\ntheir design, since any persons requisite to be introduced into the city\nmight easily be made to appear as a part of his retinue, and his arrival\nmight facilitate the completion of their enterprise. The cardinal came,\nand was received by Jacopo de' Pazzi at his villa of Montughi, near\nFlorence. By his means it was also intended to bring together Giuliano\nand Lorenzo, and whenever this happened, to put them both to death. They\ntherefore invited them to meet the cardinal at their villa of Fiesole;\nbut Giuliano, either intentionally or through some preventing cause, did\nnot attend; and this design having failed, they thought that if asked to\nan entertainment at Florence, both brothers would certainly be present.\nWith this intention they appointed Sunday, the twenty-sixth of April,\n1478, to give a great feast; and, resolving to assassinate them at\ntable, the conspirators met on the Saturday evening to arrange all\nproceedings for the following day. In the morning it was intimated to\nFrancesco that Giuliano would be absent; on which the conspirators again\nassembled and finding they could no longer defer the execution of their\ndesign, since it would be impossible among so many to preserve secrecy,\nthey determined to complete it in the cathedral church of Santa\nReparata, where the cardinal attending, the two brothers would be\npresent as usual. They wished Giovanni Batista da Montesecco to\nundertake the murder of Lorenzo, while that of Giuliano was assigned\nto Francesco de' Pazzi and Bernardo Bandini. Giovanni Batista refused,\neither because his familiarity with Lorenzo had created feelings in his\nfavor, or from some other reason, saying he should not have resolution\nsufficient to commit such a deed in a church, and thus add sacrilege\nto treachery. This caused the failure of their undertaking; for time\npressing, they were compelled to substitute Antonio da Volterra and\nStefano, the priest, two men, who, from nature and habit, were the most\nunsuitable of any; for if firmness and resolution joined with experience\nin bloodshed be necessary upon any occasion, it is on such as these; and\nit often happens that those who are expert in arms, and have faced death\nin all forms on the field of battle, still fail in an affair like this.\nHaving now decided upon the time, they resolved that the signal for the\nattack should be the moment when the priest who celebrated high\nmass should partake of the sacrament, and that, in the meantime, the\nArchbishop de' Salviati, with his followers, and Jacopo di Poggio,\nshould take possession of the palace, in order that the Signory, after\nthe young men's death, should voluntarily, or by force, contribute to\ntheir assistance.\nCHAPTER II\nGiuliano de' Medici slain--Lorenzo escapes--The archbishop Salviati\nendeavors to seize the palace of the Signory--He is taken\nand hanged--The enterprise of the conspirators entirely\nfails--Manifestations of the Florentines in favor of Lorenzo de'\nMedici--The conspirators punished--The funeral of Giuliano--The pope\nand the king of Naples make war upon the Florentines--Florence\nexcommunicated--Speech of Lorenzo de' Medici to the citizens of\nFlorence.\nThe conspirators proceeded to Santa Reparata, where the cardinal and\nLorenzo had already arrived. The church was crowded, and divine service\ncommenced before Giuliano's arrival. Francesco de' Pazzi and Bernardo\nBandini, who were appointed to be his murderers, went to his house,\nand finding him, they, by earnest entreaties, prevailed upon him to\naccompany them. It is surprising that such intense hatred, and designs\nso full of horror as those of Francesco and Bernardo, could be so\nperfectly concealed; for while conducting him to the church, and after\nthey had reached it, they amused him with jests and playful discourse.\nNor did Francesco forget, under pretense of endearment, to press him in\nhis arms, so as to ascertain whether under his apparel he wore a cuirass\nor other means of defense. Giuliano and Lorenzo were both aware of\nthe animosity of the Pazzi, and their desire to deprive them of the\ngovernment; but they felt assured that any design would be attempted\nopenly, and in conjunction with the civil authority. Thus being free\nfrom apprehension for their personal safety both affected to be on\nfriendly terms with them. The murderers being ready, each in his\nappointed station, which they could retain without suspicion, on account\nof the vast numbers assembled in the church, the preconcerted moment\narrived, and Bernardo Bandini, with a short dagger provided for the\npurpose, struck Giuliano in the breast, who, after a few steps, fell to\nthe earth. Francesco de' Pazzi threw himself upon the body and covered\nhim with wounds; while, as if blinded by rage, he inflicted a deep\nincision upon his own leg. Antonio and Stefano, the priest, attacked\nLorenzo, and after dealing many blows, effected only a slight incision\nin the throat; for either their want of resolution, the activity\nof Lorenzo, who, finding himself attacked, used his arms in his own\ndefense, or the assistance of those by whom he was surrounded, rendered\nall attempts futile. They fled and concealed themselves, but being\nsubsequently discovered, were put to death in the most ignominious\nmanner, and their bodies dragged about the city. Lorenzo, with the\nfriends he had about him, took refuge in the sacristy of the church.\nBernardo Bandini, after Giuliano's death, also slew Francesco Nori, a\nmost intimate friend of the Medici, either from some previous hatred or\nfor having endeavored to render assistance to Giuliano; and not content\nwith these murders, he ran in pursuit of Lorenzo, intending, by his own\npromptitude, to make up for the weakness and inefficiency of the others;\nbut finding he had taken refuge in the vestry, he was prevented.\nIn the midst of these violent and fearful deeds, during which the uproar\nwas so terrible, that it seemed almost sufficient to bring the church\ndown upon its inmates, the cardinal Riario remained close to the altar,\nwhere he was with difficulty kept in safety by the priests, until the\nSignory, upon the abatement of the disturbance, could conduct him to\ntheir palace, where he remained in the utmost terror till he was set at\nliberty.\nThere were at this time in Florence some people of Perugia, whom party\nfeuds had compelled to leave their homes; and the Pazzi, by promising to\nrestore them to their country, obtained their assistance. The Archbishop\nde' Salviati, going to seize the palace, together with Jacopo di Poggio,\nand the Salviati, his friends, took these Perugini with him. Having\narrived, he left part of his people below, with orders that when they\nheard a noise they should make themselves masters of the entrance, while\nhimself, with the greater part of the Perugini, proceeded above, and\nfinding the Signory at dinner (for it was now late), was admitted\nafter a short delay, by Cesare Petrucci, the Gonfalonier of Justice. He\nentered with only a few of his followers, the greater part of them being\nshut up in the cancelleria into which they had gone, whose doors were so\ncontrived, that upon closing they could not be opened from either\nside, without the key. The archbishop being with the gonfalonier, under\npretense of having something to communicate on the part of the pope,\naddressed him in such an incoherent and hesitating manner, that the\ngonfalonier at once suspected him, and rushing out of the chamber to\ncall assistance, found Jacopo di Poggio, whom he seized by the hair\nof the head, and gave into the custody of his attendants. The Signory\nhearing the tumult, snatched such arms as they could at the moment\nobtain, and all who had gone up with the archbishop, part of them being\nshut up, and part overcome with terror, were immediately slain or thrown\nalive out of the windows of the palace, at which the archbishop, the\ntwo Jacopi Salviati, and Jacopodi Poggio were hanged. Those whom the\narchbishop left below, having mastered the guard and taken possession of\nthe entrance occupied all the lower floors, so that the citizens, who in\nthe uproar, hastened to the palace, were unable to give either advice or\nassistance to the Signory.\nFrancesco de' Pazzi and Bernardo Bandini, perceiving Lorenzo's escape,\nand the principal agent in the enterprise seriously wounded, became\nimmediately conscious of the imminent peril of their position. Bernardo,\nusing the same energy in his own behalf that had served him against the\nMedici, finding all lost, saved himself by flight. Francesco, wounded as\nhe was, got to his house, and endeavored to get on horseback, for it had\nbeen arranged they should ride through the city and call the people to\narms and liberty; but he found himself unable, from the nature of his\nwound, and, throwing himself naked upon his bed, begged Jacopo de' Pazzi\nto perform the part for which he was himself incapacitated. Jacopo,\nthough old and unaccustomed to such business, by way of making a last\neffort, mounted his horse, and, with about a hundred armed followers,\ncollected without previous preparation, hastened to the piazza of the\npalace, and endeavored to assemble adherents by cries of \"people,\" and\n\"liberty;\" but the former, having been rendered deaf by the fortune and\nliberty of the Medici, the latter was unknown in Florence, and he\nfound no followers. The signors, who held the upper part of the palace,\nsaluted him with stones and threats. Jacopo, while hesitating, was met\nby Giovanni Seristori, his brother-in-law, who upbraided him with the\ntroubles he had occasioned, and then advised him to go home, for the\npeople and liberty were as dear to other citizens as to himself.\nThus deprived of every hope, Lorenzo being alive, Francesco seriously\nwounded, and none disposed to follow him, not knowing what to do, he\nresolved, if possible, to escape by flight; and, accompanied by those\nwhom he had led into the piazza, left Florence with the intention of\ngoing into Romagna.\nIn the meantime the whole city was roused to arms, and Lorenzo de'\nMedici, accompanied by a numerous escort, returned to his house. The\npalace was recovered from its assailants, all of whom were either\nslain or made prisoners. The name of the Medici echoed everywhere, and\nportions of dead bodies were seen borne on spears and scattered through\nthe streets; while everyone was transported with rage against the Pazzi,\nand pursued them with relentless cruelty. The people took possession\nof their houses, and Francesco, naked as they found him, was led to the\npalace, and hanged beside the archbishop and the rest. He could not\nbe induced, by any injurious words or deeds, to utter a syllable, but\nregarding those around with a steady look, he silently sighed. Guglielmo\nde' Pazzi, brother-in-law to Lorenzo, fled to the latter's house, and\nby his innocence and the intercession of his wife, Bianca, he escaped\ndeath. There was not a citizen of any rank whatever who did not, upon\nthis occasion, wait upon Lorenzo with an offer of his services; so great\nwere the popularity and good fortune which this family had acquired by\ntheir liberality and prudence. Rinato de' Pazzi was at his villa when\nthe event took place, and on being informed of it, he endeavored to\nescape in disguise, but was arrested upon the road and brought to\nFlorence. Jacopo de' Pazzi was taken while crossing the mountains\nof Romagna, for the inhabitants of these parts having heard what had\noccurred, and seeing him in flight, attacked and brought him back to the\ncity; nor could he, though he frequently endeavored, prevail with them\nto put him to death upon the road. Jacopo and Rinato were condemned\nwithin four days after the murder of Giuliano. And though so many deaths\nhad been inflicted that the roads were covered with fragments of human\nbodies, not one excited a feeling of regret, except that of Rinato; for\nhe was considered a wise and good man, and possessed none of the pride\nfor which the rest of his family were notorious. As if to mark the event\nby some extraordinary circumstance, Jacopo de' Pazzi, after having\nbeen buried in the tomb of his ancestors, was disinterred like an\nexcommunicated person, and thrown into a hole at the outside of the city\nwalls; from this grave he was taken, and with the halter in which he\nhad been hanged, his body was dragged naked through the city, and, as\nif unfit for sepulture on earth, thrown by the populace into the Arno,\nwhose waters were then very high. It was an awful instance of the\ninstability of fortune, to see so wealthy a man, possessing the utmost\nearthly felicity, brought down to such a depth of misery, such utter\nruin and extreme degradation. It is said he had vices, among which were\ngaming and profane swearing, to which he was very much addicted; but\nthese seem more than balanced by his numerous charities, for he relieved\nmany in distress, and bestowed much money for pious uses. It may also\nbe recorded in his favor, that upon the Saturday preceding the death\nof Giuliano, in order that none might suffer from his misfortunes, he\ndischarged all his debts; and whatever property he possessed belonging\nto others, either in his own house or his place of business, he was\nparticularly careful to return to its owners. Giovanni Batista da\nMontesecco, after a long examination, was beheaded; Napoleone Franzesi\nescaped punishment by flight; Giulielmo de' Pazzi was banished, and\nsuch of his cousins as remained alive were imprisoned in the fortress\nof Volterra. The disturbances being over, and the conspirators punished,\nthe funeral obsequies of Giuliano were performed amid universal\nlamentation; for he possessed all the liberality and humanity that could\nbe wished for in one of his high station. He left a natural son, born\nsome months after his death, named Giulio, who was endowed with that\nvirtue and felicity with which the whole world is now acquainted; and\nof which we shall speak at length when we come to our own times, if\nGod spare us. The people who had assembled in favor of the Pazzi under\nLorenzo da Castello in the Val di Tavere, and under Giovan Francesco\nda Tolentino in Romagna, approached Florence, but having heard of the\nfailure of the conspiracy, they returned home.\nThe changes desired by the pope and the king in the government of\nFlorence, not having taken place, they determined to effect by war what\nthey had failed to accomplish by treachery; and both assembled forces\nwith all speed to attack the Florentine states; publicly declaring that\nthey only wished the citizens to remove Lorenzo de' Medici, who alone\nof all the Florentines was their enemy. The king's forces had already\npassed the Tronto, and the pope's were in Perugia; and that the citizens\nmight feel the effect of spiritual as well as temporal weapons, the\npontiff excommunicated and anathematized them. Finding themselves\nattacked by so many armies, the Florentines prepared for their defense\nwith the utmost care. Lorenzo de' Medici, as the enemy's operations\nwere said to be directed against himself alone, resolved first of all to\nassemble the Signory, and the most influential citizens, in the\npalace, to whom, being above three hundred in number, he spoke as\nfollows:--\"Most excellent signors, and you, magnificent citizens, I know\nnot whether I have more occasion to weep with you for the events which\nhave recently occurred, or to rejoice in the circumstances with which\nthey have been attended. Certainly, when I think with what virulence of\nunited deceit and hatred I have been attacked, and my brother murdered,\nI cannot but mourn and grieve from my heart, from my very soul. Yet when\nI consider with what promptitude, anxiety, love, and unanimity of the\nwhole city my brother has been avenged and myself defended, I am not\nonly compelled to rejoice, but feel myself honored and exalted; for if\nexperience has shown me that I had more enemies than I apprehended, it\nhas also proved that I possess more warm and resolute friends than I\ncould ever have hoped for. I must therefore grieve with you for the\ninjuries others have suffered, and rejoice in the attachment you have\nexhibited toward myself; but I feel more aggrieved by the injuries\ncommitted, since they are so unusual, so unexampled, and (as I trust you\nbelieve) so undeserved on our part. Think, magnificent citizens, to what\na dreadful point ill fortune has reduced our family, when among friends,\namidst our own relatives, nay, in God's holy temple, we have found\nour greatest foes. Those who are in danger turn to their friends for\nassistance; they call upon their relatives for aid; but we found ours\narmed, and resolved on our destruction. Those who are persecuted, either\nfrom public or private motives, flee for refuge to the altars; but where\nothers are safe, we are assassinated; where parricides and assassins are\nsecure, the Medici find their murderers. But God, who has not hitherto\nabandoned our house, again saved us, and has undertaken the defense of\nour just cause. What injury have we done to justify so intense desire of\nour destruction? Certainly those who have shown themselves so much our\nenemies, never received any private wrong from us; for, had we wished to\ninjure them, they would not have had an opportunity of injuring us. If\nthey attribute public grievances to ourselves (supposing any had been\ndone to them), they do the greater injustices to you, to this palace,\nto the majesty of this government, by assuming that on our account you\nwould act unfairly to any of your citizens; and such a supposition, as\nwe all know, is contradicted by every view of the circumstances; for\nwe, had we been able, and you, had we wished it, would never have\ncontributed to so abominable a design. Whoever inquires into the truth\nof these matters, will find that our family has always been exalted\nby you, and from this sole cause, that we have endeavored by kindness,\nliberality, and beneficence, to do good to all; and if we have honored\nstrangers, when did we ever injure our relatives? If our enemies'\nconduct has been adopted, to gratify their desire for power (as would\nseem to be the case from their having taken possession of the palace and\nbrought an armed force into the piazza), the infamous, ambitious, and\ndetestable motive is at once disclosed. If they were actuated by envy\nand hatred of our authority, they offend you rather than us; for from\nyou we have derived all the influence we possess. Certainly usurped\npower deserves to be detested; but not distinctions conceded for acts of\nkindness, generosity, and magnificence. And you all know that our family\nnever attained any rank to which this palace and your united consent did\nnot raise it. Cosmo, my grandfather, did not return from exile with arms\nand violence, but by your unanimous desire and approbation. It was not\nmy father, old and inform, who defended the government against so many\nenemies, but yourselves by your authority and benevolence defended him;\nneither could I, after his death, being then a boy, have maintained the\nposition of my house except by your favor and advice. Nor should we\never be able to conduct the affairs of this republic, if you did not\ncontribute to our support. Therefore, I know not the reason of their\nhatred toward us, or what just cause they have of envy. Let them direct\ntheir enmity against their own ancestors, who, by their pride and\navarice, lost the reputation which ours, by very opposite conduct, were\nenabled to acquire. But let it be granted we have greatly injured them,\nand that they are justified in seeking our ruin; why do they come and\ntake possession of the palace? Why enter into league with the pope\nand the king, against the liberties of this republic? Why break the\nlong-continued peace of Italy? They have no excuse for this; they ought\nto confine their vengeance to those who do them wrong, and not confound\nprivate animosities with public grievances. Hence it is that since their\ndefeat our misfortune is the greater; for on their account the pope and\nthe king make war upon us, and this war, they say, is directed against\nmy family and myself. And would to God that this were true; then the\nremedy would be sure and unfailing, for I would not be so base a citizen\nas to prefer my own safety to yours; I would at once resolve to ensure\nyour security, even though my own destruction were the immediate and\ninevitable consequence. But as the wrongs committed by princes are\nusually concealed under some less offensive covering, they have adopted\nthis plea to hide their more abominable purpose. If, however, you think\notherwise, I am in your hands; it is with you to do with me what you\nplease. You are my fathers, my protectors, and whatever you command me\nto do I will perform most willingly; nor will I ever refuse, when you\nfind occasion to require it, to close the war with my own blood which\nwas commenced with that of my brother.\" While Lorenzo spoke, the\ncitizens were unable to refrain from tears, and the sympathy with which\nhe had been heard was extended to their reply, delivered by one of\nthem in the name of the rest, who said that the city acknowledged many\nadvantages derived from the good qualities of himself and his family;\nand encouraged them to hope that with as much promptitude as they had\nused in his defense, and in avenging his brother's death, they would\nsecure to him his influence in the government, which he should never\nlose while they retained possession of the country. And that their deeds\nmight correspond with their words, they immediately appointed a number\nof armed men, as a guard for the security of his person against domestic\nenemies.\nCHAPTER III\nThe Florentines prepare for war against the pope--They appeal to\na future council--Papal and Neapolitan movements against\nthe Florentines--The Venetians refuse to assist the\nFlorentines--Disturbances in Milan--Genoa revolts from the duke--Futile\nendeavors to effect peace with the pope--The Florentines repulse their\nenemies from the territory of Pisa--They attack the papal states--The\npapal forces routed upon the borders of the Lake of Perugia.\nThe Florentines now prepared for war, by raising money and collecting\nas large a force as possible. Being in league with the duke of Milan\nand the Venetians, they applied to both for assistance. As the pope had\nproved himself a wolf rather than a shepherd, to avoid being devoured\nunder false accusations, they justified their cause with all available\narguments, and filled Italy with accounts of the treachery practiced\nagainst their government, exposing the impiety and injustice of the\npontiff, and assured the world that the pontificate which he had\nwickedly attained, he would as impiously fill; for he had sent those\nwhom he had advanced to the highest order of prelacy, in the company\nof traitors and parricides, to commit the most horrid treachery in the\nchurch in the midst of divine service and during the celebration of the\nholy sacrament, and that then, having failed to murder the citizens,\nchange the government, and plunder the city, according to his intention,\nhe had suspended the performance of all religious offices, and\ninjuriously menaced and injured the republic with pontifical\nmaledictions. But if God was just, and violence was offensive to him, he\nwould be displeased with that of his viceregent, and allow his injured\npeople who were not admitted to communion with the latter, to offer\nup their prayers to himself. The Florentines, therefore, instead of\nreceiving or obeying the interdict, compelled the priests to perform\ndivine service, assembled a council in Florence of all the Tuscan\nprelates under their jurisdiction, and appealed against the injuries\nsuffered from the pontiff to a future general council.\nThe pope did not neglect to assign reasons in his own justification, and\nmaintained it was the duty of a pontiff to suppress tyranny, depress\nthe wicked, and exalt the good; and that this ought to be done by\nevery available means; but that secular princes had no right to detain\ncardinals, hang bishops, murder, mangle, and drag about the bodies of\npriests, destroying without distinction the innocent with the guilty.\nNotwithstanding these complaints and accusations, the Florentines\nrestored to the pope the cardinal whom they had detained, in return for\nwhich he immediately assailed them with his own forces and those of\nthe king. The two armies, under the command of Alfonso, eldest son of\nFerrando, and duke of Calabria, who had as his general, Federigo, count\nof Urbino, entered the Chianti, by permission of the Siennese, who sided\nwith the enemy, occupied Radda with many other fortresses, and having\nplundered the country, besieged the Castellina. The Florentines were\ngreatly alarmed at these attacks, being almost destitute of forces, and\nfinding their friends slow to assist; for though the duke sent them aid,\nthe Venetians denied all obligation to support the Florentines in their\nprivate quarrels, since the animosities of individuals were not to be\ndefended at the public expense. The Florentines, in order to induce the\nVenetians to take a more correct view of the case, sent Tommaso Soderini\nas their ambassador to the senate, and, in the meantime, engaged forces,\nand appointed Ercole, marquis of Ferrara, to the command of their army.\nWhile these preparations were being made, the Castellina was so hard\npressed by the enemy, that the inhabitants, despairing of relief,\nsurrendered, after having sustained a siege of forty-two days. The\nenemy then directed their course toward Arezzo, and encamped before San\nSavino. The Florentine army being now in order, went to meet them,\nand having approached within three miles, caused such annoyance, that\nFederigo d'Urbino demanded a truce for a few days, which was granted,\nbut proved so disadvantageous to the Florentines, that those who had\nmade the request were astonished at having obtained it; for, had it been\nrefused, they would have been compelled to retire in disgrace. Having\ngained these few days to recruit themselves, as soon as they were\nexpired, they took the castle in the presence of their enemies. Winter\nbeing now come, the forces of the pope and king retired for convenient\nquarters to the Siennese territory. The Florentines also withdrew to\na more commodious situation, and the marquis of Ferrara, having done\nlittle for himself and less for others, returned to his own territories.\nAt this time, Genoa withdrew from the dominion of Milan, under the\nfollowing circumstances. Galeazzo, at his death, left a son, Giovan\nGaleazzo, who being too young to undertake the government, dissensions\narose between Sforza, Lodovico, Ottaviano, and Ascanio, his uncles, and\nthe lady Bona, his mother, each of whom desired the guardianship of the\nyoung duke. By the advice and mediation of Tommaso Soderini, who\nwas then Florentine ambassador at the court of Milan, and of Cecco\nSimonetta, who had been secretary to Galeazzo, the lady Bona prevailed.\nThe uncles fled, Ottaviano was drowned in crossing the Adda; the rest\nwere banished to various places, together with Roberto da San Severino,\nwho in these disputes had deserted the duchess and joined the uncles\nof the duke. The troubles in Tuscany, which immediately followed,\ngave these princes hope that the new state of things would present\nopportunities for their advantage; they therefore quitted the places to\nwhich their exile limited them, and each endeavored to return home. King\nFerrando, finding the Florentines had obtained assistance from none but\nthe Milanese, took occasion to give the duchess so much occupation\nin her own government, as to render her unable to contribute to their\nassistance. By means of Prospero Adorno, the Signor Roberto, and the\nrebellious uncles of the duke, he caused Genoa to throw off the Milanese\nyoke. The Castelletto was the only place left; confiding in which, the\nduchess sent a strong force to recover the city, but it was routed by\nthe enemy; and perceiving the danger which might arise to her son and\nherself if the war were continued, Tuscany being in confusion, and the\nFlorentines, in whom alone she had hope, themselves in trouble, she\ndetermined, as she could not retain Genoa in subjection, to secure it\nas an ally; and agreed with Battistino Fregoso, the enemy of Prospero\nAdorno, to give him the Castelletto, and make him prince of Genoa, on\ncondition that he should expel Prospero, and do nothing in favor of her\nson's uncles. Upon this agreement, Battistino, by the assistance of the\nCastelletto and of his friends, became lord of Genoa; and according to\nthe custom of the city, took the title of Doge. The Sforzeschi and the\nSignor Roberto, being thus expelled by the Genoese, came with their\nforces into Lunigiana, and the pope and the king, perceiving the\ntroubles of Lombardy to be composed, took occasion with them to annoy\nTuscany in the Pisan territory, that the Florentines might be weakened\nby dividing their forces. At the close of winter they ordered Roberto\nda San Severino to leave Lunigiana and march thither, which he did, and\nwith great tumult plundered many fortresses, and overran the country\naround Pisa.\nAt this time, ambassadors came to Florence from the emperor, the king of\nFrance, and the king of Hungary, who were sent by their princes to the\npontiff. They solicited the Florentines also to send ambassadors to the\npope, and promised to use their utmost exertion to obtain for them an\nadvantageous peace. The Florentines did not refuse to make trial, both\nfor the sake of publicly justifying their proceedings, and because they\nwere really desirous of peace. Accordingly, the ambassadors were sent,\nbut returned without coming to any conclusion of their differences. The\nFlorentines, to avail themselves of the influence of the king of France,\nsince they were attacked by one part of the Italians and abandoned\nby the other, sent to him as their ambassador, Donato Acciajuoli, a\ndistinguished Latin and Greek scholar, whose ancestors had always ranked\nhigh in the city, but while on his journey he died at Milan. To relieve\nhis surviving family and pay a deserved tribute to his memory, he was\nhonorably buried at the public expense, provision was made for his sons,\nand suitable marriage portions given to his daughters, and Guid' Antonio\nVespucci, a man well acquainted with pontifical and imperial affairs,\nwas sent as ambassador to the king in his stead.\nThe attack of Signor Roberto upon the Pisan territory, being unexpected,\ngreatly perplexed the Florentines; for having to resist the foe in the\ndirection of Sienna, they knew not how to provide for the places about\nPisa. To keep the Lucchese faithful, and prevent them from furnishing\nthe enemy either with money or provisions, they sent as ambassador Piero\ndi Gino Capponi, who was received with so much jealousy, on account of\nthe hatred which that city always cherishes against the Florentines\nfrom former injuries and constant fear, that he was on many occasions in\ndanger of being put to death by the mob; and thus his mission gave fresh\ncause of animosity rather than of union. The Florentines recalled the\nmarquis of Ferrara, and engaged the marquis of Mantua; they also as\nearnestly requested the Venetians to send them Count Carlo, son of\nBraccio, and Deifobo, son of Count Jacopo, and after many delays, they\ncomplied; for having made a truce with the Turks, they had no excuse\nto justify a refusal, and could not break through the obligation of the\nLeague without the utmost disgrace. The counts, Carlo and Deifobo, came\nwith a good force, and being joined by all that could be spared from\nthe army, which, under the marquis of Ferrara, held in check the duke\nof Calabria, proceeded toward Pisa, to meet Signor Roberto, who was with\nhis troops near the river Serchio, and who, though he had expressed his\nintention of awaiting their arrival, withdrew to the camp at Lunigiana,\nwhich he had quitted upon coming into the Pisan territory, while Count\nCarlo recovered all the places that had been taken by the enemy in that\ndistrict.\nThe Florentines, being thus relieved from the attack in the direction of\nPisa, assembled the whole force between Colle and Santo Geminiano. But\nthe army, on the arrival of Count Carlo, being composed of Sforzeschi\nand Bracceschi, their hereditary feuds soon broke forth, and it was\nthought that if they remained long in company, they would turn their\narms against each other. It was therefore determined, as the smaller\nevil, to divide them; to send one party, under Count Carlo, into the\ndistrict of Perugia, and establish the other at Poggibonzi, where\nthey formed a strong encampment in order to prevent the enemy from\npenetrating the Florentine territory. By this they also hoped to compel\nthe enemy to divide their forces; for Count Carlo was understood to have\nmany partisans in Perugia, and it was therefore expected, either that\nhe would occupy the place, or that the pope would be compelled to send\na large body of men for its defense. To reduce the pontiff to greater\nnecessity, they ordered Niccolo Vitelli, who had been expelled from\nCitta di Castello, where his enemy Lorenzo Vitelli commanded, to lead a\nforce against that place, with the view of driving out his adversary\nand withdrawing it from obedience to the pope. At the beginning of the\ncampaign, fortune seemed to favor the Florentines; for Count Carlo made\nrapid advances in the Perugino, and Niccolo Vitelli, though unable to\nenter Castello, was superior in the field, and plundered the surrounding\ncountry without opposition. The forces also, at Poggibonzi, constantly\noverran the country up to the walls of Sienna. These hopes, however,\nwere not realized; for in the first place, Count Carlo died, while in\nthe fullest tide of success; though the consequences of this would have\nbeen less detrimental to the Florentines, had not the victory to which\nit gave occasion, been nullified by the misconduct of others. The death\nof the count being known, the forces of the church, which had already\nassembled in Perugia, conceived hopes of overcoming the Florentines, and\nencamped upon the lake, within three miles of the enemy. On the other\nside, Jacopo Guicciardini, commissary to the army, by the advice\nof Roberto da Rimino, who, after the death of Count Carlo, was the\nprincipal commander, knowing the ground of their sanguine expectations,\ndetermined to meet them, and coming to an engagement near the lake,\nupon the site of the memorable rout of the Romans, by Hannibal, the\nCarthaginian general, the papal forces were vanquished. The news of the\nvictory, which did great honor to the commanders, diffused universal\njoy at Florence, and would have ensured a favorable termination of the\ncampaign, had not the disorders which arose in the army at Poggibonzi\nthrown all into confusion; for the advantage obtained by the valor of\nthe one, was more than counterbalanced by the disgraceful proceedings\nof the other. Having made considerable booty in the Siennese territory,\nquarrels arose about the division of it between the marquis of Mantua\nand the marquis of Ferrara, who, coming to arms, assailed each other\nwith the utmost fury; and the Florentines seeing they could no longer\navail themselves of the services of both, allowed the marquis of Ferrara\nand his men to return home.\nCHAPTER IV\nThe duke of Calabria routs the Florentine army at Poggibonzi--Dismay in\nFlorence on account of the defeat--Progress of the duke of Calabria--The\nFlorentines wish for peace--Lorenzo de' Medici determines to go to\nNaples to treat with the king--Lodovico Sforza, surnamed the Moor, and\nhis brothers, recalled to Milan--Changes in the government of that city\nin consequence--The Genoese take Serezana--Lorenzo de' Medici arrives\nat Naples--Peace concluded with the king--The pope and the Venetians\nconsent to the peace--The Florentines in fear of the duke of\nCalabria--Enterprises of the Turks--They take Otranto--The Florentines\nreconciled with the pope--Their ambassadors at the papal court--The\npope's reply to the ambassadors--The king of Naples restores to the\nFlorentines all the fortresses he had taken.\nThe army being thus reduced, without a leader, and disorder prevailing\nin every department, the duke of Calabria, who was with his forces near\nSienna, resolved to attack them immediately. The Florentines, finding\nthe enemy at hand, were seized with a sudden panic; neither their arms,\nnor their numbers, in which they were superior to their adversaries,\nnor their position, which was one of great strength, could give them\nconfidence; but observing the dust occasioned by the enemy's approach,\nwithout waiting for a sight of them, they fled in all directions,\nleaving their ammunition, carriages, and artillery to be taken by the\nfoe. Such cowardice and disorder prevailed in the armies of those times,\nthat the turning of a horse's head or tail was sufficient to decide the\nfate of an expedition. This defeat loaded the king's troops with booty,\nand filled the Florentines with dismay; for the city, besides the war,\nwas afflicted with pestilence, which prevailed so extensively, that all\nwho possessed villas fled to them to escape death. This occasioned the\ndefeat to be attended with greater horror; for those citizens whose\npossessions lay in the Val di Pesa and the Val d'Elsa, having retired to\nthem, hastened to Florence with all speed as soon as they heard of the\ndisaster, taking with them not only their children and their property,\nbut even their laborers; so that it seemed as if the enemy were expected\nevery moment in the city. Those who were appointed to the management\nof the war, perceiving the universal consternation, commanded the\nvictorious forces in the Perugino to give up their enterprise in that\ndirection, and march to oppose the enemy in the Val d'Elsa, who, after\ntheir victory, plundered the country without opposition; and although\nthe Florentine army had so closely pressed the city of Perugia that\nit was expected to fall into their hands every instant, the people\npreferred defending their own possessions to endeavoring to seize those\nof others. The troops, thus withdrawn from the pursuit of their good\nfortune, were marched to San Casciano, a castle within eight miles of\nFlorence; the leaders thinking they could take up no other position till\nthe relics of the routed army were assembled. On the other hand, the\nenemy being under no further restraint at Perugia, and emboldened by\nthe departure of the Florentines, plundered to a large amount in the\ndistricts of Arezzo and Cortona; while those who under Alfonso, duke\nof Calabria, had been victorious near Poggibonzi, took the town itself;\nsacked Vico and Certaldo, and after these conquests and pillagings\nencamped before the fortress of Colle, which was considered very strong;\nand as the garrison was brave and faithful to the Florentines, it was\nhoped they would hold the enemy at bay till the republic was able to\ncollect its forces. The Florentines being at Santo Casciano, and the\nenemy continuing to use their utmost exertions against Colle, they\ndetermined to draw nearer, that the inhabitants might be more resolute\nin their defense, and the enemy assail them less boldly. With this\ndesign they removed their camp from Santo Casciano to Santo Geminiano,\nabout five miles from Colle, and with light cavalry and other suitable\nforces were able every day to annoy the duke's camp. All this, however,\nwas insufficient to relieve the people of Colle; for, having consumed\ntheir provisions, they were compelled to surrender on the thirteenth of\nNovember, to the great grief of the Florentines, and joy of the enemy,\nmore especially of the Siennese, who, besides their habitual hatred of\nthe Florentines, had a particular animosity against the people of Colle.\nIt was now the depth of winter, and the weather so unsuitable for war,\nthat the pope and the king, either designing to hold out a hope of\npeace, or more quietly to enjoy the fruit of their victories, proposed a\ntruce for three months to the Florentines, and allowed them ten days to\nconsider the reply. The offer was eagerly accepted; but as wounds are\nwell known to be more painful after the blood cools than when they\nwere first received, this brief repose awakened the Florentines to a\nconsciousness of the miseries they had endured; and the citizens openly\nlaid the blame upon each other, pointing out the errors committed in the\nmanagement of the war, the expenses uselessly incurred, and the taxes\nunjustly imposed. These matters were boldly discussed, not only in\nprivate circles, but in the public councils; and one individual even\nventured to turn to Lorenzo de' Medici, and say, \"The city is exhausted,\nand can endure no more war; it is therefore necessary to think of\npeace.\" Lorenzo was himself aware of the necessity, and assembled the\nfriends in whose wisdom and fidelity he had the greatest confidence,\nwhen it was at once concluded, that as the Venetians were lukewarm and\nunfaithful, and the duke in the power of his guardians, and involved\nin domestic difficulties, it would be desirable by some new alliance to\ngive a better turn to their affairs. They were in doubt whether to apply\nto the king or to the pope; but having examined the question in all\nsides, they preferred the friendship of the king as more suitable and\nsecure; for the short reigns of the pontiffs, the changes ensuing upon\neach succession, the disregard shown by their church toward temporal\nprinces, and the still greater want of respect for them exhibited in\nher determinations, render it impossible for a secular prince to trust\na pontiff, or safely to share his fortune; for an adherent of the pope\nwill have a companion in victory, but in defeat must stand alone, while\nthe pontiff is sustained by his spiritual power and influence. Having\ntherefore decided that the king's friendship would be of the greatest\nutility to them, they thought it would be most easily and certainly\nobtained by Lorenzo's presence; for in proportion to the confidence they\nevinced toward him, the greater they imagined would be the probability\nof removing his impressions of past enmities. Lorenzo having resolved to\ngo to Naples, recommended the city and government to the care of Tommaso\nSoderini, who was at that time Gonfalonier of Justice. He left Florence\nat the beginning of December, and having arrived at Pisa, wrote to\nthe government to acquaint them with the cause of his departure. The\nSignory, to do him honor, and enable him the more effectually to treat\nwith the king, appointed him ambassador from the Florentine people, and\nendowed him with full authority to make such arrangements as he thought\nmost useful for the republic.\nAt this time Roberto da San Severino, with Lodovico and Ascanio (Sforza\ntheir elder brother being dead) again attacked Milan, in order to\nrecover the government. Having taken Tortona, and the city and the\nwhole state being in arms, the duchess Bona was advised to restore the\nSforzeschi, and to put a stop to civil contentions by admitting them to\nthe government. The person who gave this advice was Antonio Tassino, of\nFerrara, a man of low origin, who, coming to Milan, fell into the hands\nof the duke Galeazzo, and was given by him to his duchess for her valet.\nHe, either from his personal attractions, or some secret influence,\nafter the duke's death attained such influence over the duchess, that\nhe governed the state almost at his will. This greatly displeased\nthe minister Cecco, whom prudence and long experience had rendered\ninvaluable; and who, to the utmost of his power, endeavored to diminish\nthe authority of Tassino with the duchess and other members of the\ngovernment. The latter, aware of this, to avenge himself for the injury,\nand secure defenders against Cecco, advised the duchess to recall the\nSforzeschi, which she did, without communicating her design to the\nminister, who, when it was done, said to her, \"You have taken a step\nwhich will deprive me of my life, and you of the government.\" This\nshortly afterward took place; for Cecco was put to death by Lodovico,\nand Tassino, being expelled from the dukedom, the duchess was so enraged\nthat she left Milan, and gave up the care of her son to Lodovico, who,\nbecoming sole governor of the dukedom, caused, as will be hereafter\nseen, the ruin of Italy.\nLorenzo de' Medici had set out for Naples, and the truce between the\nparties was in force, when, quite unexpectedly, Lodovico Fregoso, being\nin correspondence with some persons of Serezana, entered the place by\nstealth, took possession of it with an armed force, and imprisoned the\nFlorentine governor. This greatly offended the Signory, for they thought\nthe whole had been concerted with the connivance of King Ferrando. They\ncomplained to the duke of Calabria, who was with the army at Sienna,\nof a breach of the truce; and he endeavored to prove, by letters and\nembassies, that it had occurred without either his own or his father's\nknowledge. The Florentines, however, found themselves in a very awkward\npredicament, being destitute of money, the head of the republic in the\npower of the king, themselves engaged in a long-standing war with the\nlatter and the pope, in a new one with the Genoese, and entirely without\nfriends; for they had no confidence in the Venetians, and on account\nof its changeable and unsettled state they were rather apprehensive of\nMilan. They had thus only one hope, and that depended upon Lorenzo's\nsuccess with the king.\nLorenzo arrived at Naples by sea, and was most honorably received, not\nonly by Ferrando, but by the whole city, his coming having excited the\ngreatest expectation; for it being generally understood that the war was\nundertaken for the sole purpose of effecting his destruction, the power\nof his enemies invested his name with additional lustre. Being admitted\nto the king's presence, he spoke with so much propriety upon the affairs\nof Italy, the disposition of her princes and people, his hopes\nfrom peace, his fears of the results of war, that Ferrando was more\nastonished at the greatness of his mind, the promptitude of his genius,\nhis gravity and wisdom, than he had previously been at his power.\nHe consequently treated him with redoubled honor, and began to feel\ncompelled rather to part with him as a friend, than detain him as an\nenemy. However, under various pretexts he kept Lorenzo from December\ntill March, not only to gain the most perfect knowledge of his own\nviews, but of those of his city; for he was not without enemies, who\nwould have wished the king to detain and treat him in the same manner as\nJacopo Piccinino; and, with the ostensible view of sympathizing for him,\npointed out all that would, or rather that they wished should, result\nfrom such a course; at the same time opposing in the council every\nproposition at all likely to favor him. By such means as these the\nopinion gained ground, that if he were detained at Naples much longer,\nthe government of Florence would be changed. This caused the king to\npostpone their separation more than he would have otherwise done, to\nsee if any disturbance were likely to arise. But finding everything go\nquietly on, Ferrando allowed him to depart on the sixth of March, 1479,\nhaving, with every kind of attention and token of regard, endeavored to\ngain his affection, and formed with him a perpetual alliance for their\nmutual defense. Lorenzo returned to Florence, and upon presenting\nhimself before the citizens, the impressions he had created in the\npopular mind surrounded him with a halo of majesty brighter than before.\nHe was received with all the joy merited by his extraordinary qualities\nand recent services, in having exposed his own life to the most imminent\nperil, in order to restore peace to his country. Two days after his\nreturn, the treaty between the republic of Florence and the king, by\nwhich each party bound itself to defend the other's territories, was\npublished. The places taken from the Florentines during the war were\nto be taken up at the discretion of the king; the Pazzi confined in the\ntower of Volterra were to be set at liberty, and a certain sum of money,\nfor a limited period, was to be paid to the duke of Calabria.\nAs soon as this peace was publicly known, the pope and the Venetians\nwere transported with rage; the pope thought himself neglected by\nthe king; the Venetians entertained similar ideas with regard to the\nFlorentines, and complained that, having been companions in the war,\nthey were not allowed to participate in the peace. Reports of this\ndescription being spread abroad, and received with entire credence at\nFlorence, caused a general fear that the peace thus made would give rise\nto greater wars; and therefore the leading members of the government\ndetermined to confine the consideration of the most important affairs to\na smaller number, and formed a council of seventy citizens, in whom the\nprincipal authority was invested. This new regulation calmed the minds\nof those desirous of change, by convincing them of the futility of their\nefforts. To establish their authority, they in the first place ratified\nthe treaty of peace with the king, and sent as ambassadors to the pope\nAntonio Ridolfi and Piero Nasi. But, notwithstanding the peace, Alfonso,\nduke of Calabria, still remained at Sienna with his forces, pretending\nto be detained by discords among the citizens, which, he said, had risen\nso high, that while he resided outside the city they had compelled\nhim to enter and assume the office of arbitrator between them. He took\noccasion to draw large sums of money from the wealthiest citizens by way\nof fines, imprisoned many, banished others, and put some to death; he\nthus became suspected, not only by the Siennese but by the Florentines,\nof a design to usurp the sovereignty of Sienna; nor was any remedy then\navailable, for the republic had formed a new alliance with the king,\nand were at enmity with the pope and the Venetians. This suspicion was\nentertained not only by the great body of the Florentine people, who\nwere subtle interpreters of appearances, but by the principal members of\nthe government; and it was agreed, on all hands, that the city never\nwas in so much danger of losing her liberty. But God, who in similar\nextremities has always been her preserver, caused an unhoped-for event\nto take place, which gave the pope, the king, and the Venetians other\nmatters to think of than those in Tuscany.\nThe Turkish emperor, Mahomet II. had gone with a large army to the siege\nof Rhodes, and continued it for several months; but though his forces\nwere numerous, and his courage indomitable, he found them more than\nequalled by those of the besieged, who resisted his attack with such\nobstinate valor, that he was at last compelled to retire in disgrace.\nHaving left Rhodes, part of his army, under the Pasha Achmet, approached\nVelona, and, either from observing the facility of the enterprise, or\nin obedience to his sovereign's commands, coasting along the Italian\nshores, he suddenly landed four thousand soldiers, and attacked the city\nof Otranto, which he easily took, plundered, and put all the inhabitants\nto the sword. He then fortified the city and port, and having assembled\na large body of cavalry, pillaged the surrounding country. The king,\nlearning this, and aware of the redoubtable character of his assailant,\nimmediately sent messengers to all the surrounding powers, to request\nassistance against the common enemy, and ordered the immediate return of\nthe duke of Calabria with the forces at Sienna.\nThis attack, however it might annoy the duke and the rest of Italy,\noccasioned the utmost joy at Florence and Sienna; the latter thinking it\nhad recovered its liberty, and the former that she had escaped a storm\nwhich threatened her with destruction. These impressions, which were not\nunknown to the duke, increased the regret he felt at his departure\nfrom Sienna; and he accused fortune of having, by an unexpected and\nunaccountable accident, deprived him of the sovereignty of Tuscany. The\nsame circumstance changed the disposition of the pope; for although he\nhad previously refused to receive any ambassador from Florence, he was\nnow so mollified as to be anxious to listen to any overtures of peace;\nand it was intimated to the Florentines, that if they would condescend\nto ask the pope's pardon, they would be sure of obtaining it. Thinking\nit advisable to seize the opportunity, they sent twelve ambassadors\nto the pontiff, who, on their arrival, detained them under different\npretexts before he would admit them to an audience. However, terms were\nat length settled, and what should be contributed by each in peace or\nwar. The messengers were then admitted to the feet of the pontiff, who,\nwith the utmost pomp, received them in the midst of his cardinals. They\napologized for past occurrences; first showing they had been compelled\nby necessity, then blaming the malignity of others, or the rage of the\npopulace, and their just indignation, and enlarging on the unfortunate\ncondition of those who are compelled either to fight or die; saying,\nthat since every extremity is endured in order to avoid death, they had\nsuffered war, interdicts, and other inconveniences, brought upon them\nby recent events, that their republic might escape slavery, which is\nthe death of free cities. However, if in their necessities they had\ncommitted any offense, they were desirous to make atonement, and trusted\nin his clemency, who, after the example of the blessed Redeemer, would\nreceive them into his compassionate arms.\nThe pope's reply was indignant and haughty. After reiterating all the\noffenses against the church during the late transactions, he said that,\nto comply with the precepts of God, he would grant the pardon they\nasked, but would have them understand, that it was their duty to obey;\nand that upon the next instance of their disobedience, they would\ninevitably forfeit, and that most deservedly, the liberty which they had\njust been upon the point of losing; for those merit freedom who exercise\nthemselves in good works and avoid evil; that liberty, improperly used,\ninjures itself and others; that to think little of God, and less of his\nchurch, is not the part of a free man, but a fool, and one disposed to\nevil rather than good, and to effect whose correction is the duty not\nonly of princes but of every Christian; so that in respect of the recent\nevents, they had only themselves to blame, who, by their evil deeds, had\ngiven rise to the war, and inflamed it by still worse actions, it having\nbeen terminated by the kindness of others rather than by any merit of\ntheir own. The formula of agreement and benediction was then read; and,\nin addition to what had already been considered and agreed upon between\nthe parties, the pope said, that if the Florentines wished to enjoy the\nfruit of his forgiveness, they must maintain fifteen galleys, armed,\nand equipped, at their own expense, as long as the Turks should make\nwar upon the kingdom of Naples. The ambassadors complained much of this\nburden in addition to the arrangement already made, but were unable to\nobtain any alleviation. However, after their return to Florence, the\nSignory sent, as ambassador to the pope, Guidantonio Vespucci, who\nhad recently returned from France, and who by his prudence brought\neverything to an amicable conclusion, obtained many favors from the\npontiff, which were considered as presages of a closer reconciliation.\nHaving settled their affairs with the pope, Sienna being free,\nthemselves released from the fear of the king, by the departure of\nthe duke of Calabria from Tuscany, and the war with the Turks\nstill continuing, the Florentines pressed the king to restore their\nfortresses, which the duke of Calabria, upon quitting the country, had\nleft in the hands of the Siennese. Ferrando, apprehensive that if he\nrefused, they would withdraw from the alliance with him, and by new wars\nwith the Siennese deprive him of the assistance he hoped to obtain from\nthe pope and other Italian powers, consented that they should be given\nup, and by new favors endeavored to attach the Florentines to his\ninterests. It is thus evident, that force and necessity, not deeds and\nobligations, induce princes to keep faith.\nThe castles being restored, and this new alliance established, Lorenzo\nde' Medici recovered the reputation which first the war and then the\npeace, when the king's designs were doubtful, had deprived him of; for\nat this period there was no lack of those who openly slandered him with\nhaving sold his country to save himself, and said, that in war they had\nlost their territories, and in peace their liberty. But the fortresses\nbeing recovered, an honorable treaty ratified with the king, and the\ncity restored to her former influence, the spirit of public discourse\nentirely changed in Florence, a place greatly addicted to gossip, and in\nwhich actions are judged by the success attending them, rather than by\nthe intelligence employed in their direction; therefore, the citizens\npraised Lorenzo extravagantly, declaring that by his prudence he had\nrecovered in peace, what unfavorable circumstances had taken from them\nin war, and that by his discretion and judgment he had done more than\nthe enemy with all the force of their arms.\nCHAPTER V\nNew occasions of war in Italy--Differences between the marquis of\nFerrara, and the Venetians--The king of Naples and the Florentines\nattack the papal states--The pope's defensive arrangements--The\nNeapolitan army routed by the papal forces--Progress of the Venetians\nagainst the marquis of Ferrara--The pope makes peace, and enters into\na league against the Venetians--Operations of the League against the\nVenetians--The Venetians routed at Bondeno--Their losses--Disunion among\nthe League--Lodovico Sforza makes peace with the Venetians--Ratified by\nthe other parties.\nThe invasion of the Turks had deferred the war which was about to break\nforth from the anger of the pope and the Venetians at the peace between\nthe Florentines and the king. But as the beginning of that invasion was\nunexpected and beneficial, its conclusion was equally unlooked for and\ninjurious; for Mahomet dying suddenly, dissensions arose among his sons,\nand the forces which were in Puglia being abandoned by their commander,\nsurrendered Otranto to the king. The fears which restrained the pope and\nthe Venetians being thus removed, everyone became apprehensive of new\ntroubles. On the one hand, was the league of the pope and the Venetians,\nand with them the Genoese, Siennese, and other minor powers; on the\nother, the Florentines, the king, and the duke, with whom were the\nBolognese and many princes. The Venetians wished to become lords of\nFerrara, and thought they were justified by circumstances in making\nthe attempt, and hoping for a favorable result. Their differences arose\nthus: the marquis of Ferrara affirmed he was under no obligation to\ntake salt from the Venetians, or to admit their governor; the terms of\nconvention between them declaring, that after seventy years, the city\nwas to be free from both impositions. The Venetians replied, that so\nlong as he held the Polesine, he was bound to receive their salt\nand their governor. The marquis refusing his consent, the Venetians\nconsidered themselves justified in taking arms, and that the present\nmoment offered a suitable opportunity; for the pope was indignant\nagainst the Florentines and the king; and to attach the pope still\nfurther, the Count Girolamo, who was then at Venice, was received with\nall possible respect; first admitted to the privileges of a citizen,\nand then raised to the rank of a senator, the highest distinctions the\nVenetian senate can confer. To prepare for the war, they levied new\ntaxes, and appointed to the command of the forces, Roberto da San\nSeverino, who being offended with Lodovico, governor of Milan, fled to\nTortona, whence, after occasioning some disturbances, he went to Genoa,\nand while there, was sent for by the Venetians, and placed at the head\nof their troops.\nThese circumstances becoming known to the opposite league, induced it\nalso to provide for war. The duke of Milan appointed as his general,\nFederigo d'Urbino; the Florentines engaged Costanzo, lord of Pesaro;\nand to sound the disposition of the pope, and know whether the Venetians\nmade war against Ferrara with his consent or not, King Ferrando sent\nAlfonso, duke of Calabria, with his army across the Tronto, and asked\nthe pontiff's permission to pass into Lombardy to assist the marquis,\nwhich was refused in the most peremptory manner. The Florentines and\nthe king, no longer doubtful about the pope's intentions, determined to\nharass him, and thus either compel him to take part with them, or\nthrow such obstacles in his way, as would prevent him from helping\nthe Venetians, who had already taken the field, attacked the marquis,\noverran his territory, and encamped before Figaruolo, a fortress of the\ngreatest importance. In pursuance of the design of the Florentines and\nthe king, the duke of Calabria, by the assistance of the Colonna family\n(the Orsini had joined the pope), plundered the country about Rome\nand committed great devastation; while the Florentines, with Niccolo\nVitelli, besieged and took Citta di Castello, expelling Lorenzo Vitelli,\nwho held it for the pope, and placing Niccolo in it as prince.\nThe pope now found himself in very great straits; for the city of Rome\nwas disturbed by factions and the country covered with enemies. But\nacting with courage and resolution, he appointed Roberto da Rimino to\ntake the command of his forces; and having sent for him to Rome, where\nhis troops were assembled, told him how great would be the honor, if\nhe could deliver the church from the king's forces, and the troubles in\nwhich it was involved; how greatly indebted, not only himself, but all\nhis successors would be, and, that not mankind merely, but God himself\nwould be under obligations to him. The magnificent Roberto, having\nconsidered the forces and preparations already made, advised the pope to\nraise as numerous a body of infantry as possible, which was done without\ndelay. The duke of Calabria was at hand, and constantly harassed the\ncountry up to the very gates of Rome, which so roused the indignation\nof the citizens, that many offered their assistance to Roberto, and\nall were thankfully received. The duke, hearing of these preparations,\nwithdrew a short distance from the city, that in the belief of finding\nhim gone, the magnificent Roberto would not pursue him, and also in\nexpectation of his brother Federigo, whom their father had sent to him\nwith additional forces. But Roberto, finding himself nearly equal to the\nduke in cavalry, and superior in infantry, marched boldly out of Rome\nand took a position within two miles of the enemy. The duke, seeing his\nadversaries close upon him, found he must either fight or disgracefully\nretire. To avoid a retreat unbecoming a king's son, he resolved to face\nthe enemy; and a battle ensued which continued from morning till midday.\nIn this engagement, greater valor was exhibited on both sides than\nhad been shown in any other during the last fifty years, upward of a\nthousand dead being left upon the field. The troops of the church were\nat length victorious, for her numerous infantry so annoyed the ducal\ncavalry, that they were compelled to retreat, and Alfonso himself would\nhave fallen into the hands of the enemy, had he not been rescued by a\nbody of Turks, who remained at Otranto, and were at that time in his\nservice. The lord of Rimino, after this victory, returned triumphantly\nto Rome, but did not long enjoy the fruit of his valor; for having,\nduring the heat of the engagement, taken a copious draught of water,\nhe was seized with a flux, of which he very shortly afterward died. The\npope caused his funeral to be conducted with great pomp, and in a few\ndays, sent the Count Girolamo toward Citta di Castello to restore it\nto Lorenzo, and also endeavor to gain Rimino, which being by Roberto's\ndeath left to the care of his widow and a son who was quite a boy, his\nholiness thought might be easily won; and this certainly would have\nbeen the case, if the lady had not been defended by the Florentines,\nwho opposed him so effectually, as to prevent his success against both\nCastello and Rimino.\nWhile these things were in progress at Rome and in Romagna, the\nVenetians took possession of Figaruolo and crossed the Po with their\nforces. The camp of the duke of Milan and the marquis was in disorder;\nfor the count of Urbino having fallen ill, was carried to Bologna for\nhis recovery, but died. Thus the marquis's affairs were unfortunately\nsituated, while those of the Venetians gave them increasing hopes of\noccupying Ferrara. The Florentines and the king of Naples used their\nutmost endeavors to gain the pope to their views; and not having\nsucceeded by force, they threatened him with the council, which had\nalready been summoned by the emperor to assemble at Basle; and by\nmeans of the imperial ambassadors, and the co-operation of the leading\ncardinals, who were desirous of peace, the pope was compelled to turn\nhis attention toward effecting the pacification of Italy. With this\nview, at the instigation of his fears, and with the conviction that the\naggrandizement of the Venetians would be the ruin of the church and of\nItaly, he endeavored to make peace with the League, and sent his nuncios\nto Naples, where a treaty was concluded for five years, between the\npope, the king, the duke of Milan, and the Florentines, with an opening\nfor the Venetians to join them if they thought proper. When this was\naccomplished, the pope intimated to the Venetians, that they must desist\nfrom war against Ferrara. They refused to comply, and made preparations\nto prosecute their design with greater vigor than they had hitherto\ndone; and having routed the forces of the duke and the marquis at\nArgenta, they approached Ferrara so closely as to pitch their tents in\nthe marquis's park.\nThe League found they must no longer delay rendering him efficient\nassistance, and ordered the duke of Calabria to march to Ferrara with\nhis forces and those of the pope, the Florentine troops also moving in\nthe same direction. In order to direct the operations of the war with\ngreater efficiency, the League assembled a diet at Cremona, which was\nattended by the pope's legate, the Count Girolamo, the duke of Calabria,\nthe Signor Lodovico Sforza, and Lorenzo de' Medici, with many other\nItalian princes; and when the measures to be adopted were fully\ndiscussed, having decided that the best way of relieving Ferrara would\nbe to effect a division of the enemy's forces, the League desired\nLodovico to attack the Venetians on the side of Milan, but this he\ndeclined, for fear of bringing a war upon the duke's territories, which\nit would be difficult to quell. It was therefore resolved to proceed\nwith the united forces of the League to Ferrara, and having assembled\nfour thousand cavalry and eight thousand infantry, they went in pursuit\nof the Venetians, whose force amounted to two thousand two hundred\nmen at arms, and six thousand foot. They first attacked the Venetian\nflotilla, then lying upon the river Po, which they routed with the loss\nof above two hundred vessels, and took prisoner Antonio Justiniano, the\npurveyor of the fleet. The Venetians, finding all Italy united against\nthem, endeavored to support their reputation by engaging in their\nservice the duke of Lorraine, who joined them with two hundred men at\narms: and having suffered so great a destruction of their fleet, they\nsent him, with part of their army, to keep their enemies at bay, and\nRoberto da San Severino to cross the Adda with the remainder, and\nproceed to Milan, where they were to raise the cry of \"The duke and the\nLady Bona,\" his mother; hoping by this means to give a new aspect to\naffairs there, believing that Lodovico and his government were generally\nunpopular. This attack at first created great consternation, and roused\nthe citizens in arms; but eventually produced consequences unfavorable\nto the designs of the Venetians; for Lodovico was now desirous to\nundertake what he had refused to do at the entreaty of his allies.\nLeaving the marquis of Ferrara to the defense of his own territories,\nhe, with four thousand horse and two thousand foot, and joined by the\nduke of Calabria with twelve thousand horse and five thousand foot,\nentered the territory of Bergamo, then Brescia, next that of Verona,\nand, in defiance of the Venetians, plundered the whole country; for it\nwas with the greatest difficulty that Roberto and his forces could\nsave the cities themselves. In the meantime, the marquis of Ferrara had\nrecovered a great part of his territories; for the duke of Lorraine, by\nwhom he was attacked, having only at his command two thousand horse and\none thousand foot, could not withstand him. Hence, during the whole of\n1483, the affairs of the League were prosperous.\nThe winter having passed quietly over, the armies again took the field.\nTo produce the greater impression upon the enemy, the League united\ntheir whole force, and would easily have deprived the Venetians of all\nthey possessed in Lombardy, if the war had been conducted in the same\nmanner as during the preceding year; for by the departure of the duke\nof Lorraine, whose term of service had expired, they were reduced to\nsix thousand horse and five thousand foot, while the allies had thirteen\nthousand horse and five thousand foot at their disposal. But, as is\noften the case where several of equal authority are joined in command,\ntheir want of unity decided the victory to their enemies. Federigo,\nmarquis of Mantua, whose influence kept the duke of Calabria and\nLodovico Sforza within bounds, being dead, differences arose between\nthem which soon became jealousies. Giovan Galeazzo, duke of Milan, was\nnow of an age to take the government on himself, and had married the\ndaughter of the duke of Calabria, who wished his son-in-law to exercise\nthe government and not Lodovico; the latter, being aware of the duke's\ndesign, studied to prevent him from effecting it. The position of\nLodovico being known to the Venetians, they thought they could make it\navailable for their own interests; and hoped, as they had often before\ndone, to recover in peace all they had lost by war; and having secretly\nentered into treaty with Lodovico, the terms were concluded in August,\n1484. When this became known to the rest of the allies, they were\ngreatly dissatisfied, principally because they found that the places won\nfrom the Venetians were to be restored; that they were allowed to\nkeep Rovigo and the Polesine, which they had taken from the marquis of\nFerrara, and besides this retain all the pre-eminence and authority over\nFerrara itself which they had formerly possessed. Thus it was evident\nto everyone, they had been engaged in a war which had cost vast sums of\nmoney, during the progress of which they had acquired honor, and which\nwas concluded with disgrace; for the places wrested from the enemy were\nrestored without themselves recovering those they had lost. They\nwere, however, compelled to ratify the treaty, on account of the\nunsatisfactory state of their finances, and because the faults and\nambition of others had rendered them unwilling to put their fortunes to\nfurther proof.\nCHAPTER VI\nAffairs of the pope--He is reconciled to Niccolo Vitelli--Discords\nbetween the Colonnesi and the Orsini--Various events--The war\nof Serezana--Genoa occupied by her archbishop--Death of Sixtus\nIV.--Innocent VIII. elected--Agostino Fregoso gives Serezana to the bank\nof St. Giorgio--Account of the bank of St. Giorgio--War with the\nGenoese for Serezana--Stratagem of the Florentines to attack Pietra\nSanta--Difficulties and final surrender of Pietra Santa--The Lucchese\nlay claim to Pietra Santa--The city of L'Aquila revolts against the king\nof Naples--War between him and the pope--The Florentines take the king's\nparty--Peace between the pope and the king.\nDuring these events in Lombardy, the pope sent Lorenzo to invest Citta\ndi Castello, for the purpose of expelling Niccolo Vitelli, the place\nhaving been abandoned to him by the League, for the purpose of inducing\nthe pontiff to join them. During the siege, Niccolo's troops were\nled out against the papal forces and routed them. Upon this the pope\nrecalled the Count Girolamo from Lombardy with orders first to recruit\nhis army at Rome, and then proceed against Citta di Castello. But\nthinking afterward, that it would be better to obtain Niccolo Vitello\nas his friend than to renew hostilities with him, an arrangement was\nentered into by which the latter retained Citta di Castello, and the\npope pacified Lorenzo as well as he could. He was induced to both these\nmeasures rather by his apprehension of fresh troubles than by his love\nof peace, for he perceived dissensions arising between the Colonessi and\nthe Orsini.\nIn the war between the king of Naples and the pope, the former had\ntaken the district of Tagliacozzo from the Orsini, and given it to the\nColonnesi, who had espoused his cause. Upon the establishment of peace,\nthe Orsini demanded its restoration by virtue of the treaty. The pope\nhad frequently intimated to the Colonnesi that it ought to be restored;\nbut they, instead of complying with the entreaties of the Orsini, or\nbeing influenced by the pope's threats, renewed hostilities against the\nformer. Upon this the pontiff, unable to endure their insolence, united\nhis own forces with those of the Orsini, plundered the houses they\npossessed in Rome, slew or made prisoners all who defended them, and\nseized most of their fortresses. So that when these troubles were\ncomposed, it was rather by the complete subjugation of one party than\nfrom any desire for peace in the other.\nNor were the affairs of Genoa or of Tuscany in repose, for the\nFlorentines kept the Count Antonio da Marciano on the borders of\nSerezana; and while the war continued in Lombardy, annoyed the people\nof Serezana by inroads and light skirmishes. Battistino Fregoso, doge of\nGenoa, trusting to Pagolo Fregoso, the archbishop, was taken prisoner,\nwith his wife and children, by the latter, who assumed the sovereignty\nof the city. The Venetian fleet had attacked the kingdom of Naples,\ntaken Gallipoli, and harassed the neighboring places. But upon the peace\nof Lombardy, all tumults were hushed except those of Tuscany and Rome;\nfor the pope died in five days after its declaration, either in the\nnatural course of things, or because his grief for peace, to which he\nwas always opposed, occasioned his end.\nUpon the decease of the pontiff, Rome was immediately in arms. The Count\nGirolamo withdrew his forces into the castle; and the Orsini feared the\nColonnesi would avenge the injuries they had recently sustained. The\nColonnesi demanded the restitution of their houses and castles, so that\nin a few days robberies, fires, and murders prevailed in several parts\nof the city. The cardinals entreated the count to give the castle into\nthe hands of the college, withdraw his troops, and deliver Rome from\nthe fear of his forces, and he, by way of ingratiating himself with the\nfuture pontiff obeyed, and retired to Imola. The cardinals, being thus\ndivested of their fears, and the barons hopeless of assistance in their\nquarrels, proceeded to create a new pontiff, and after some discussion,\nGiovanni Batista Cibo, a Genoese, cardinal of Malfetta, was elected, and\ntook the name of Innocent VIII. By the mildness of his disposition (for\nhe was peaceable and humane) he caused a cessation of hostilities, and\nfor the present restored peace to Rome.\nThe Florentines, after the pacification of Lombardy, could not remain\nquiet; for it appeared disgraceful that a private gentleman should\ndeprive them of the fortress of Serezana; and as it was allowed by the\nconditions of peace, not only to demand lost places, but to make war\nupon any who should impede their restoration, they immediately provided\nmen and money to undertake its recovery. Upon this, Agostino Fregoso,\nwho had seized Serezana, being unable to defend it, gave the fortress to\nthe Bank of St. Giorgio. As we shall have frequent occasion to speak of\nSt. Giorgio and the Genoese, it will not be improper, since Genoa is\none of the principal cities of Italy, to give some account of the\nregulations and usages prevailing there. When the Genoese had made peace\nwith the Venetians, after the great war, many years ago, the republic,\nbeing unable to satisfy the claims of those who had advanced large sums\nof money for its use, conceded to them the revenue of the Dogano or\ncustomhouse, so that each creditor should participate in the receipts\nin proportion to his claim, until the whole amount should be liquidated,\nand as a suitable place for their assembling, the palace over the\nDogano was assigned for their use. These creditors established a form of\ngovernment among themselves, appointing a council of one hundred persons\nfor the direction of their affairs, and a committee of eight, who, as\nthe executive body, should carry into effect the determinations of the\ncouncil. Their credits were divided into shares, called _Luoghi_, and\nthey took the title of the Bank, or Company of St. Giorgio. Having thus\narranged their government, the city fell into fresh difficulties, and\napplied to San Giorgio for assistance, which, being wealthy and well\nmanaged, was able to afford the required aid. On the other hand, as the\ncity had at first conceded the customs, she next began to assign towns,\ncastles, or territories, as security for moneys received; and this\npractice has proceeded to such a length, from the necessities of the\nstate, and the accommodation by the San Giorgio, that the latter now\nhas under its administration most of the towns and cities in the Genoese\ndominion. These the Bank governs and protects, and every year sends its\ndeputies, appointed by vote, without any interference on the part of the\nrepublic. Hence the affections of the citizens are transferred from the\ngovernment to the San Giorgio, on account of the tyranny of the\nformer, and the excellent regulations adopted by the latter. Hence also\noriginate the frequent changes of the republic, which is sometimes\nunder a citizen, and at other times governed by a stranger; for the\nmagistracy, and not the San Giorgio, changes the government. So when\nthe Fregosi and the Adorni were in opposition, as the government of the\nrepublic was the prize for which they strove, the greater part of the\ncitizens withdrew and left it to the victor. The only interference of\nthe Bank of St. Giorgio is when one party has obtained a superiority\nover the other, to bind the victor to the observance of its laws, which\nup to this time have not been changed; for as it possesses arms, money,\nand influence, they could not be altered without incurring the imminent\nrisk of a dangerous rebellion. This establishment presents an\ninstance of what in all the republics, either described or imagined\nby philosophers, has never been thought of; exhibiting within the same\ncommunity, and among the same citizens, liberty and tyranny, integrity\nand corruption, justice and injustice; for this establishment preserves\nin the city many ancient and venerable customs; and should it happen (as\nin time it easily may) that the San Giorgio should have possession of\nthe whole city, the republic will become more distinguished than that of\nVenice.\nAgostino Fregoso conceded Serezana to the San Giorgio, which readily\naccepted it, undertook its defense, put a fleet to sea, and sent forces\nto Pietra Santa to prevent all attempts of the Florentines, whose\ncamp was in the immediate vicinity. The Florentines found it would be\nessentially necessary to gain possession of Pietra Santa, for without\nit the acquisition of Serezana lost much of its value, being situated\nbetween the latter place and Pisa; but they could not, consistently\nwith the treaty, besiege it, unless the people of Pietra Santa, or its\ngarrison, were to impede their acquisition of Serezana. To induce the\nenemy to do this, the Florentines sent from Pisa to the camp a quantity\nof provisions and military stores, accompanied by a very weak escort;\nthat the people of Pietra Santa might have little cause for fear, and by\nthe richness of the booty be tempted to the attack. The plan succeeded\naccording to their expectation; for the inhabitants of Pietra Santa,\nattracted by the rich prize took possession of it.\nThis gave legitimate occasion to the Florentines to undertake operations\nagainst them; so leaving Serezana they encamped before Pietra Santa,\nwhich was very populous, and made a gallant defense. The Florentines\nplanted their artillery in the plain, and formed a rampart upon the\nhill, that they might also attack the place on that side. Jacopo\nGuicciardini was commissary of the army; and while the siege of Pietra\nSanta was going on, the Genoese took and burned the fortress of Vada,\nand, landing their forces, plundered the surrounding country. Biongianni\nGianfigliazzi was sent against them, with a body of horse and foot, and\nchecked their audacity, so that they pursued their depredations less\nboldly. The fleet continuing its efforts went to Livorno, and by\npontoons and other means approached the new tower, playing their\nartillery upon it for several days, but being unable to make any\nimpression they withdrew.\nIn the meantime the Florentines proceeded slowly against Pietra Santa,\nand the enemy taking courage attacked and took their works upon the\nhill. This was effected with so much glory, and struck such a panic into\nthe Florentines, that they were almost ready to raise the siege, and\nactually retreated a distance of four miles; for their generals thought\nthat they would retire to winter quarters, it being now October, and\nmake no further attempt till the return of spring.\nWhen the discomfiture was known at Florence, the government was filled\nwith indignation; and, to impart fresh vigor to the enterprise, and\nrestore the reputation of their forces, they immediately appointed\nAntonio Pucci and Bernardo del Neri commissaries, who, with vast sums of\nmoney, proceeded to the army, and intimated the heavy displeasure of the\nSignory, and of the whole city, if they did not return to the walls; and\nwhat a disgrace, if so large an army and so many generals, having only\na small garrison to contend with, could not conquer so poor and weak\na place. They explained the immediate and future advantages that would\nresult from the acquisition, and spoke so forcibly upon the subject,\nthat all became anxious to renew the attack. They resolved, in the first\nplace, to recover the rampart upon the hill; and here it was evident how\ngreatly humanity, affability, and condescension influence the minds of\nsoldiers; for Antonio Pucci, by encouraging one and promising another,\nshaking hands with this man and embracing that, induced them to proceed\nto the charge with such impetuosity, that they gained possession of\nthe rampart in an instant. However, the victory was not unattended by\nmisfortune, for Count Antonio da Marciano was killed by a cannon shot.\nThis success filled the townspeople with so much terror, that they began\nto make proposals for capitulation; and to invest the surrender with\nimposing solemnity, Lorenzo de' Medici came to the camp, when, after a\nfew days, the fortress was given up. It being now winter, the leaders of\nthe expedition thought it unadvisable to make any further effort until\nthe return of spring, more particularly because the autumnal air had\nbeen so unhealthy that numbers were affected by it. Antonio Pucci and\nBiongianni Gianfigliazzi were taken ill and died, to the great regret\nof all, so greatly had Antonio's conduct at Pietra Santa endeared him to\nthe army.\nUpon the taking of Pietra Santa, the Lucchese sent ambassadors to\nFlorence, to demand its surrender to their republic, on account of its\nhaving previously belonged to them, and because, as they alleged, it was\nin the conditions that places taken by either party were to be restored\nto their original possessors. The Florentines did not deny the articles,\nbut replied that they did not know whether, by the treaty between\nthemselves and the Genoese, which was then under discussion, it would\nhave to be given up or not, and therefore could not reply to that point\nat present; but in case of its restitution, it would first be necessary\nfor the Lucchese to reimburse them for the expenses they had incurred\nand the injury they had suffered, in the death of so many citizens; and\nthat when this was satisfactorily arranged, they might entertain hopes\nof obtaining the place.\nThe whole winter was consumed in negotiations between the Florentines\nand Genoese, which, by the pope's intervention, were carried on at Rome;\nbut not being concluded upon the return of spring, the Florentines would\nhave attacked Serezana had they not been prevented by the illness of\nLorenzo de' Medici, and the war between the pope and King Ferrando; for\nLorenzo was afflicted not only by the gout, which seemed hereditary in\nhis family, but also by violent pains in the stomach, and was compelled\nto go the baths for relief.\nThe more important reason was furnished by the war, of which this was\nthe origin. The city of L'Aquila, though subject to the kingdom of\nNaples, was in a manner free; and the Count di Montorio possessed great\ninfluence over it. The duke of Calabria was upon the banks of the Tronto\nwith his men-at-arms, under pretense of appeasing some disturbances\namong the peasantry; but really with a design of reducing L'Aquila\nentirely under the king's authority, and sent for the Count di Montorio,\nas if to consult him upon the business he pretended then to have in\nhand. The count obeyed without the least suspicion, and on his arrival\nwas made prisoner by the duke and sent to Naples. When this circumstance\nbecame known at L'Aquila, the anger of the inhabitants arose to the\nhighest pitch; taking arms they killed Antonio Cencinello, commissary\nfor the king, and with him some inhabitants known partisans of his\nmajesty. The L'Aquilani, in order to have a defender in their rebellion,\nraised the banner of the church, and sent envoys to the pope, to submit\ntheir city and themselves to him, beseeching that he would defend them\nas his own subjects against the tyranny of the king. The pontiff gladly\nundertook their defense, for he had both public and private reasons for\nhating that monarch; and Signor Roberto of San Severino, an enemy of the\nduke of Milan, being disengaged, was appointed to take the command\nof his forces, and sent for with all speed to Rome. He entreated\nthe friends and relatives of the Count di Montorio to withdraw their\nallegiance from the king, and induced the princes of Altimura, Salerno,\nand Bisignano to take arms against him. The king, finding himself so\nsuddenly involved in war, had recourse to the Florentines and the duke\nof Milan for assistance. The Florentines hesitated with regard to their\nown conduct, for they felt all the inconvenience of neglecting their own\naffairs to attend to those of others, and hostilities against the church\nseemed likely to involve much risk. However, being under the obligation\nof a League, they preferred their honor to convenience or security,\nengaged the Orsini, and sent all their own forces under the Count\ndi Pitigliano toward Rome, to the assistance of the king. The latter\ndivided his forces into two parts; one, under the duke of Calabria, he\nsent toward Rome, which, being joined by the Florentines, opposed the\narmy of the church; with the other, under his own command, he attacked\nthe barons, and the war was prosecuted with various success on both\nsides. At length, the king, being universally victorious, peace was\nconcluded by the intervention of the ambassadors of the king of Spain,\nin August, 1486, to which the pope consented; for having found fortune\nopposed to him he was not disposed to tempt it further. In this treaty\nall the powers of Italy were united, except the Genoese, who were\nomitted as rebels against the republic of Milan, and unjust occupiers of\nterritories belonging to the Florentines. Upon the peace being ratified,\nRoberto da San Severino, having been during the war a treacherous ally\nof the church, and by no means formidable to her enemies, left Rome;\nbeing followed by the forces of the duke and the Florentines, after\npassing Cesena, found them near him, and urging his flight reached\nRavenna with less than a hundred horse. Of his forces, part were\nreceived into the duke's service, and part were plundered by the\npeasantry. The king, being reconciled with his barons, put to death\nJacopo Coppola and Antonello d'Aversa and their sons, for having, during\nthe war, betrayed his secrets to the pope.\nCHAPTER VII\nThe pope becomes attached to the Florentines--The Genoese\nseize Serezanello--They are routed by the Florentines--Serezana\nsurrenders--Genoa submits to the duke of Milan--War between the\nVenetians and the Dutch--Osimo revolts from the church--Count Girolamo\nRiario, lord of Furli, slain by a conspiracy--Galeotto, lord of Faenza,\nis murdered by the treachery of his wife--The government of the city\noffered to the Florentines--Disturbances in Sienna--Death of Lorenzo\nde' Medici--His eulogy--Establishment of his family--Estates bought by\nLorenzo--His anxiety for the defense of Florence--His taste for arts and\nliterature--The university of Pisa--The estimation of Lorenzo by other\nprinces.\nThe pope having observed in the course of the war, how promptly and\nearnestly the Florentines adhered to their alliances, although he had\npreviously been opposed to them from his attachment to the Genoese,\nand the assistance they had rendered to the king, now evinced a more\namicable disposition, and received their ambassadors with greater favor\nthan previously. Lorenzo de' Medici, being made acquainted with this\nchange of feeling, encouraged it with the utmost solicitude; for he\nthought it would be of great advantage, if to the friendship of the king\nhe could add that of the pontiff. The pope had a son named Francesco,\nupon whom designing to bestow states and attach friends who might be\nuseful to him after his own death, saw no safer connection in Italy\nthan Lorenzo's, and therefore induced the latter to give him one of his\ndaughters in marriage. Having formed this alliance, the pope desired the\nGenoese to concede Serezana to the Florentines, insisting that they had\nno right to detain what Agostino had sold, nor was Agostino justified\nin making over to the Bank of San Giorgio what was not his own. However,\nhis holiness did not succeed with them; for the Genoese, during these\ntransactions at Rome, armed several vessels, and, unknown to the\nFlorentines, landed three thousand foot, attacked Serezanello, situated\nabove Serezana, plundered and burnt the town near it, and then,\ndirecting their artillery against the fortress, fired upon it with their\nutmost energy. This assault was new and unexpected by the Florentines,\nwho immediately assembled their forces under Virginio Orsino, at Pisa,\nand complained to the pope, that while he was endeavoring to establish\npeace, the Genoese had renewed their attack upon them. They then sent\nPiero Corsini to Lucca, that by his presence he might keep the city\nfaithful; and Pagolantonio Soderini to Venice, to learn how that\nrepublic was disposed. They demanded assistance of the king and of\nSignor Lodovico, but obtained it from neither; for the king expressed\napprehensions of the Turkish fleet, and Lodovico made excuses, but sent\nno aid. Thus the Florentines in their own wars are almost always\nobliged to stand alone, and find no friends to assist them with the same\nreadiness they practice toward others. Nor did they, on this desertion\nof their allies (it being nothing new to them) give way to despondency;\nfor having assembled a large army under Jacopo Guicciardini and Pietro\nVettori, they sent it against the enemy, who had encamped upon the\nriver Magra, at the same time pressing Serezanello with mines and every\nspecies of attack. The commissaries being resolved to relieve the place,\nan engagement ensued, when the Genoese were routed, and Lodovico dal\nFiesco, with several other principal men, made prisoners. The Serezanesi\nwere not so depressed at their defeat as to be willing to surrender,\nbut obstinately prepared for their defense, while the Florentine\ncommissaries proceeded with their operations, and instances of valor\noccurred on both sides. The siege being protracted by a variety of\nfortune, Lorenzo de' Medici resolved to go to the camp, and on his\narrival the troops acquired fresh courage, while that of the enemy\nseemed to fail; for perceiving the obstinacy of the Florentines' attack,\nand the delay of the Genoese in coming to their relief, they surrendered\nto Lorenzo, without asking conditions, and none were treated with\nseverity except two or three who were leaders of the rebellion. During\nthe siege, Lodovico had sent troops to Pontremoli, as if with an\nintention of assisting the Florentines; but having secret correspondence\nin Genoa, a party was raised there, who, by the aid of these forces,\ngave the city to the duke of Milan.\nAt this time the Dutch made war upon the Venetians, and Boccolino of\nOsimo, in the Marca, caused that place to revolt from the pope, and\nassumed the sovereignty. After a variety of fortune, he was induced to\nrestore the city to the pontiff and come to Florence, where, under the\nprotection of Lorenzo de' Medici, by whose advice he had been prevailed\nupon to submit, he lived long and respected. He afterward went to Milan,\nbut did not experience such generous treatment; for Lodovico caused him\nto be put to death. The Venetians were routed by the Dutch, near the\ncity of Trento, and Roberto da S. Severino, their captain, was slain.\nAfter this defeat, the Venetians, with their usual good fortune, made\npeace with the Dutch, not as vanquished, but as conquerors, so honorable\nwere the terms they obtained.\nAbout this time, there arose serious troubles in Romagna. Francesco\nd'Orso, of Furli, was a man of great authority in that city, and\nbecame suspected by the count Girolamo, who often threatened him. He\nconsequently, living under great apprehensions, was advised by his\nfriends to provide for his own safety, by the immediate adoption of such\na course as would relieve him from all further fear of the count. Having\nconsidered the matter and resolved to attempt it, they fixed upon the\nmarket day, at Furli, as most suitable for their purpose; for many of\ntheir friends being sure to come from the country, they might make\nuse of their services without having to bring them expressly for the\noccasion. It was the month of May, when most Italians take supper by\ndaylight. The conspirators thought the most convenient hour would be\nafter the count had finished his repast; for his household being then\nat their meal, he would remain in the chamber almost alone. Having\nfixed upon the hour, Francesco went to the count's residence, left\nhis companions in the hall, proceeded to his apartment, and desired an\nattendant to say he wished for an interview. He was admitted, and after\na few words of pretended communication, slew him, and calling to his\nassociates, killed the attendant. The governor of the place coming by\naccident to speak with the count, and entering the apartment with a few\nof his people, was also slain. After this slaughter, and in the midst\nof a great tumult, the count's body was thrown from the window, and with\nthe cry of \"church and liberty,\" they roused the people (who hated the\navarice and cruelty of the count) to arms, and having plundered his\nhouse, made the Countess Caterina and her children prisoners. The\nfortress alone had to be taken to bring the enterprise to a successful\nissue; but the Castellan would not consent to its surrender. They begged\nthe countess would desire him to comply with their wish, which she\npromised to do, if they would allow her to go into the fortress,\nleaving her children as security for the performance of her promise. The\nconspirators trusted her, and permitted her to enter; but as soon as she\nwas within, she threatened them with death and every kind of torture in\nrevenge for the murder of her husband; and upon their menacing her with\nthe death of her children, she said she had the means of getting more.\nFinding they were not supported by the pope, and that Lodovico\nSforza, uncle to the countess, had sent forces to her assistance, the\nconspirators became terrified, and taking with them whatever property\nthey could carry off, they fled to Citta di Castello. The countess\nrecovered the state, and avenged the death of her husband with the\nutmost cruelty. The Florentines hearing of the count's death, took\noccasion to recover the fortress of Piancaldoli, of which he had\nformerly deprived them, and, on sending some forces, captured it; but\nCecco, the famous engineer, lost his life during the siege.\nTo this disturbance in Romagna, another in that province, no less\nimportant, has to be added. Galeotto, lord of Faenza, had married the\ndaughter of Giovanni Bentivogli, prince of Bologna. She, either through\njealousy or ill treatment by her husband, or from the depravity of her\nown nature, hated him to such a degree, that she determined to deprive\nhim of his possessions and his life; and pretending sickness, she took\nto her bed, where, having induced Galeotto to visit her, he was slain by\nassassins, whom she had concealed for that purpose in the apartment.\nShe had acquainted her father with her design, and he hoped, on his\nson-in-law's death, to become lord of Faenza. A great tumult arose as\nsoon as the murder was known, the widow, with an infant son, fled into\nthe fortress, the people took up arms, Giovanni Bentivogli, with a\ncondottiere of the duke of Milan, named Bergamino, engaged for the\noccasion, entered Faenza with a considerable force, and Antonio Boscoli,\nthe Florentine commissary, was also there. These leaders being together,\nand discoursing of the government of the place, the men of Val di\nLamona, who had risen unanimously upon learning what had occurred,\nattacked Giovanni and Bergamino, the latter of whom they slew, made the\nformer prisoner, and raising the cry of \"Astorre and the Florentines,\"\noffered the city to the commissary. These events being known at\nFlorence, gave general offense; however, they set Giovanni and his\ndaughter at liberty, and by the universal desire of the people, took\nthe city and Astorre under their protection. Besides these, after\nthe principal differences of the greater powers were composed, during\nseveral years tumults prevailed in Romagna, the Marca, and Sienna,\nwhich, as they are unimportant, it will be needless to recount. When\nthe duke of Calabria, after the war of 1478, had left the country, the\ndistractions of Sienna became more frequent, and after many changes, in\nwhich, first the plebeians, and then the nobility, were victorious, the\nlatter and length maintained the superiority, and among them Pandolfo\nand Jacopo Petrucci obtained the greatest influence, so that the former\nbeing distinguished for prudence and the latter for resolution, they\nbecame almost princes in the city.\nThe Florentines after the war of Serezana, lived in great prosperity\nuntil 1492, when Lorenzo de' Medici died; for he having put a stop to\nthe internal wars of Italy, and by his wisdom and authority established\npeace, turned his thoughts to the advancement of his own and the city's\ninterests, and married Piero, his eldest son, to Alfonsina, daughter of\nthe Cavaliere Orsino. He caused Giovanni, his second son, to be raised\nto the dignity of cardinal. This was the more remarkable from its being\nunprecedented; for he was only fourteen years of age when admitted to\nthe college; and became the medium by which his family attained to the\nhighest earthly glory. He was unable to make any particular provision\nfor Guiliano, his third son, on account of his tender years, and\nthe shortness of his own life. Of his daughters, one married Jacopo\nSalviati; another, Francesco Cibo; the third, Piero Ridolfi; and the\nfourth, whom, in order to keep his house united, he had married to\nGiovanni de' Medici, died. In his commercial affairs he was very\nunfortunate, from the improper conduct of his agents, who in all their\nproceedings assumed the deportment of princes rather than of private\npersons; so that in many places, much of his property was wasted, and\nhe had to be relieved by his country with large sums of money. To\navoid similar inconvenience, he withdrew from mercantile pursuits,\nand invested his property in land and houses, as being less liable to\nvicissitude. In the districts of Prato, Pisa, and the Val di Pesa, he\npurchased extensively, and erected buildings, which for magnificence\nand utility, were quite of regal character. He next undertook the\nimprovement of the city, and as many parts were unoccupied by buildings,\nhe caused new streets to be erected in them, of great beauty, and thus\nenlarged the accommodation of the inhabitants. To enjoy his power in\nsecurity and repose, and conquer or resist his enemies at a distance, in\nthe direction of Bologna he fortified the castle of Firenzuola,\nsituated in the midst of the Appennines; toward Sienna he commenced the\nrestoration and fortification of the Poggio Imperiale; and he shut out\nthe enemy in the direction of Genoa, by the acquisition of Pietra Santa\nand Serezana. For the greater safety of the city, he kept in pay the\nBaglioni, at Perugia, and the Vitelli, at Citta di Castello, and held\nthe government of Faenza wholly in his own power; all which greatly\ncontributed to the repose and prosperity of Florence. In peaceful times,\nhe frequently entertained the people with feasts, and exhibitions of\nvarious events and triumphs of antiquity; his object being to keep the\ncity abundantly supplied, the people united, and the nobility honored.\nHe was a great admirer of excellence in the arts, and a patron of\nliterary men, of which Agnolo da Montepulciano, Cristofero Landini, and\nDemetrius Chalcondylas, a Greek, may afford sufficient proofs. On this\naccount, Count Giovanni della Mirandola, a man of almost supernatural\ngenius, after visiting every court of Europe, induced by the munificence\nof Lorenzo, established his abode at Florence. He took great delight\nin architecture, music, and poetry, many of his comments and poetical\ncompositions still remaining. To facilitate the study of literature\nto the youth of Florence, he opened a university at Pisa, which was\nconducted by the most distinguished men in Italy. For Mariano da\nChinazano, a friar of the order of St. Augustine, and an excellent\npreacher, he built a monastery in the neighborhood of Florence. He\nenjoyed much favor both from fortune and from the Almighty; all his\nenterprises were brought to a prosperous termination, while his enemies\nwere unfortunate; for, besides the conspiracy of the Pazzi, an attempt\nwas made to murder him in the Carmine, by Batista Frescobaldi, and a\nsimilar one by Baldinetto da Pistoja, at his villa; but these persons,\nwith their confederates, came to the end their crimes deserved. His\nskill, prudence, and fortune, were acknowledged with admiration, not\nonly by the princes of Italy, but by those of distant countries; for\nMatthias, king of Hungary, gave him many proofs of his regard; the\nsultan sent ambassadors to him with valuable presents, and the Turkish\nemperor placed in his hands Bernardo Bandini, the murderer of his\nbrother. These circumstances raised his fame throughout Italy, and his\nreputation for prudence constantly increased; for in council he was\neloquent and acute, wise in determination, and prompt and resolute\nin execution. Nor can vices be alleged against him to sully so many\nvirtues; though he was fond of women, pleased with the company of\nfacetious and satirical men, and amused with the games of the nursery,\nmore than seemed consistent with so great a character; for he was\nfrequently seen playing with his children, and partaking of their\ninfantine sports; so that whoever considers this gravity and\ncheerfulness, will find united in him dispositions which seem almost\nincompatible with each other. In his later years, he was greatly\nafflicted; besides the gout, he was troubled with excruciating pains in\nthe stomach, of which he died in April, 1492, in the forty-fourth year\nof his age; nor was there ever in Florence, or even in Italy, one so\ncelebrated for wisdom, or for whose loss such universal regret was felt.\nAs from his death the greatest devastation would shortly ensue, the\nheavens gave many evident tokens of its approach; among other signs,\nthe highest pinnacle of the church of Santa Reparata was struck with\nlightning, and great part of it thrown down, to the terror and amazement\nof everyone. The citizens and all the princes of Italy mourned for him,\nand sent their ambassadors to Florence, to condole with the city on the\noccasion; and the justness of their grief was shortly after apparent;\nfor being deprived of his counsel, his survivors were unable either to\nsatisfy or restrain the ambition of Lodovico Sforza, tutor to the duke\nof Milan; and hence, soon after the death of Lorenzo, those evil plants\nbegan to germinate, which in a little time ruined Italy, and continue to\nkeep her in desolation.", "source": "history_of_florence.txt"}

That to preserve liberty in a State, there must exist the right to\naccuse\nVIII. That calumny is as hurtful in a Commonwealth as the power to\naccuse is useful\nIX. That to give new institutions to a Commonwealth, or to reconstruct\nold institutions on an entirely new basis, must be the work of one Man\nX. That in proportion as the founder of a Kingdom or Commonwealth\nmerits praise, he who founds a Tyranny deserves blame\nXI. Of the Religion of the Romans\nXII. That it is of much moment to make account of Religion; and that\nItaly, through the Roman Church, being wanting therein, has been ruined\nXIII. Of the use the Romans made of Religion in giving institutions to\ntheir City; in carrying out their enterprises; and in quelling tumults\nXIV. That the Romans interpreted the auspices to meet the occasion; and\nmade a prudent show of observing the rites of Religion even when forced\nto disregard them; and any who rashly slighted Religion they punished\nXV. How the Samnites, as a last resource in their broken fortunes, had\nrecourse to Religion\nXVI. That a People accustomed to live under a Prince, if by any\naccident it become free, can hardly preserve that freedom\nXVII. That a corrupt People obtaining freedom can hardly preserve it\nXVIII. How a free Government existing in a corrupt City may be\npreserved, or not existing may be created\nXIX. After a strong Prince a weak Prince may maintain himself: but\nafter one weak Prince no Kingdom can stand a second\nXX. That the consecutive reigns of two valiant Princes produce great\nresults: and that well-ordered Commonwealths are assured of a\nsuccession of valiant Rulers by whom their power and growth are rapidly\nextended\nXXI. That it is a great reproach to a Prince or to a Commonwealth to be\nwithout a National Army\nXXII. What is to be noted in the combat of the three Roman Horatii and\nthe three Alban Curiatii\nXXIII. That we should never hazard our whole fortunes, where we put not\nforth our entire strength; for which reason to guard a defile is often\nhurtful\nXXIV. That well-ordered States always provide rewards and punishments\nfor their Citizens; and never set off deserts against misdeeds\nXXV. That he who would reform the institutions of a free State, must\nretain at least the semblance of old ways\nXXVI. That a new Prince in a city or province of which he has taken\npossession, ought to make everything new\nXXVII. That Men seldom know how to be wholly good or wholly bad\nXXVIII. Whence it came that the Romans were less ungrateful to their\ncitizens than were the Athenians\nXXIX. Whether a People or a Prince is the more ungrateful\nXXX. How Princes and Commonwealths may avoid the vice of ingratitude;\nand how a Captain or Citizen may escape being undone by it\nXXXI. That the Roman Captains were never punished with extreme severity\nfor misconduct; and where loss resulted to the Republic merely through\ntheir ignorance or want of judgment, were not punished at all\nXXXII. That a Prince or Commonwealth should not defer benefits until\nthey are forced to yield them\nXXXIII. When a mischief has grown up in, or against a State, it is\nsafer to temporize with it than to meet it with violence\nXXXIV. That the authority of the Dictator did good and not harm to the\nRoman Republic; and that it is, not those powers which are given by the\nfree suffrages of the People, but those which ambitious Citizens usurp\nfor themselves that are pernicious to a State\nXXXV. Why the creation of the Decemvirate in Rome, although brought\nabout by the free and open suffrage of the Citizens, was hurtful to the\nliberties of that Republic\nXXXVI. That Citizens who have held the higher offices of a Commonwealth\nshould not disdain the lower\nXXXVII. Of the mischief bred in Rome by the Agrarian Law: and how it is\na great source of disorder in a Commonwealth to pass a law opposed to\nancient usage with stringent retrospective effect\nXXXVIII. That weak Republics are irresolute and undecided; and that the\ncourse they may take depends more on Necessity than Choice\nXXXIX. That often the same accidents are seen to befall different\nNations\nXL. Of the creation of the Decemvirate in Rome, and what therein is to\nbe noted. Wherein among other matters it is shown how the same causes\nmay lead to the safety or to the ruin of a Commonwealth\nXLI. That it is unwise to pass at a bound from leniency to severity, or\nto a haughty bearing from a humble\nXLII. How easily men become corrupted\nXLIII. That men fighting in their own cause make good and resolute\nSoldiers\nXLIV. That the Multitude is helpless without a head: and that we should\nnot with the same breath threaten and ask leave\nXLV. That it is of evil example, especially in the maker of a law, not\nto observe the law when made: and that daily to renew acts of severity\nin a City is most hurtful to the Governor\nXLVI. That men climb from one step of ambition to another, seeking at\nfirst to escape injury, and then to injure others\nXLVII. That though men deceive themselves in generalities, in\nparticulars they judge truly\nXLVIII. He who would not have an office bestowed on some worthless or\nwicked person, should contrive that it be solicited by one who is\nutterly worthless and wicked, or else by one who is in the highest\ndegree noble and good\nXLIX. That if Cities which, like Rome, had their beginning in freedom,\nhave had difficulty in framing such laws as would preserve their\nfreedom, Cities which at the first have been in subjection will find\nthis almost impossible\nL. That neither any Council nor any Magistrate should have power to\nbring the Government of a City to a stay\nLI. What a Prince or Republic does of necessity, should seem to be done\nby choice\nLII. That to check the arrogance of a Citizen who is growing too\npowerful in a State, there is no safer method, nor less open to\nobjection, than to forestall him in those ways whereby he seeks to\nadvance himself\nLIII. That the People, deceived by a false show of advantage, often\ndesire what would be their ruin; and that large hopes and brave\npromises easily move them\nLIV. Of the boundless authority which a great man may use to restrain\nan excited Multitude\nLV. That the Government is easily carried on in a City wherein the body\nof the People is not corrupted: and that a Princedom is impossible\nwhere equality prevails, and a Republic where it does not\nLVI. That when great calamities are about to befall a City or Country,\nsigns are seen to presage, and seers arise who foretell them\nLVII. That the People are strong collectively, but individually weak\nLVIII. That a People is wiser and more constant than a Prince\nLIX.

That a Commonwealth to preserve its Freedom has constant need of\nnew Ordinances. Of the services in respect of which Quintius Fabius\nreceived the surname of Maximus\nNICCOL\u00d2 MACHIAVELLI\nTO\nZANOBI BUONDELMONTI AND COSIMO RUCELLAI\nHEALTH.\nI send you a gift, which if it answers ill the obligations I owe you,\nis at any rate the greatest which Niccol\u00f2 Machiavelli has it in his\npower to offer. For in it I have expressed whatever I have learned, or\nhave observed for myself during a long experience and constant study of\nhuman affairs. And since neither you nor any other can expect more at\nmy hands, you cannot complain if I have not given you more.\nYou may indeed lament the poverty of my wit, since what I have to say\nis but poorly said; and tax the weakness of my judgment, which on many\npoints may have erred in its conclusions. But granting all this, I know\nnot which of us is less beholden to the other: I to you, who have\nforced me to write what of myself I never should have written; or you\nto me, who have written what can give you no content.\nTake this, however, in the spirit in which all that comes from a friend\nshould be taken, in respect whereof we always look more to the\nintention of the giver than to the quality of the gift. And, believe\nme, that in one thing only I find satisfaction, namely, in knowing that\nwhile in many matters I may have made mistakes, at least I have not\nbeen mistaken in choosing you before all others as the persons to whom\nI dedicate these Discourses; both because I seem to myself, in doing\nso, to have shown a little gratitude for kindness received, and at the\nsame time to have departed from the hackneyed custom which leads many\nauthors to inscribe their works to some Prince, and blinded by hopes of\nfavour or reward, to praise him as possessed of every virtue; whereas\nwith more reason they might reproach him as contaminated with every\nshameful vice.\nTo avoid which error I have chosen, not those who are but those who\nfrom their infinite merits deserve to be Princes; not such persons as\nhave it in their power to load me with honours, wealth, and preferment,\nbut such as though they lack the power, have all the will to do so. For\nmen, if they would judge justly, should esteem those who are, and not\nthose whose means enable them to be generous; and in like manner those\nwho know how to govern kingdoms, rather than those who possess the\ngovernment without such knowledge. For Historians award higher praise\nto Hiero of Syracuse when in a private station than to Perseus the\nMacedonian when a King affirming that while the former lacked nothing\nthat a Prince should have save the name, the latter had nothing of the\nKing but the kingdom.\nMake the most, therefore, of this good or this evil, as you may esteem\nit, which you have brought upon yourselves; and should you persist in\nthe mistake of thinking my opinions worthy your attention, I shall not\nfail to proceed with the rest of the History in the manner promised in\nmy Preface. _Farewell_.\nDISCOURSES\nON THE FIRST DECADE OF\nTITUS LIVIUS.\nBOOK I.\nPREFACE.\nAlbeit the jealous temper of mankind, ever more disposed to censure\nthan to praise the work of others, has constantly made the pursuit of\nnew methods and systems no less perilous than the search after unknown\nlands and seas; nevertheless, prompted by that desire which nature has\nimplanted in me, fearlessly to undertake whatsoever I think offers a\ncommon benefit to all, I enter on a path which, being hitherto\nuntrodden by any, though it involve me in trouble and fatigue, may yet\nwin me thanks from those who judge my efforts in a friendly spirit. And\nalthough my feeble discernment, my slender experience of current\naffairs, and imperfect knowledge of ancient events, render these\nefforts of mine defective and of no great utility, they may at least\nopen the way to some other, who, with better parts and sounder\nreasoning and judgment, shall carry out my design; whereby, if I gain\nno credit, at all events I ought to incur no blame.\nWhen I see antiquity held in such reverence, that to omit other\ninstances, the mere fragment of some ancient statue is often bought at\na great price, in order that the purchaser may keep it by him to adorn\nhis house, or to have it copied by those who take delight in this art;\nand how these, again, strive with all their skill to imitate it in\ntheir various works; and when, on the other hand, I find those noble\nlabours which history shows to have been wrought on behalf of the\nmonarchies and republics of old times, by kings, captains, citizens,\nlawgivers, and others who have toiled for the good of their country,\nrather admired than followed, nay, so absolutely renounced by every one\nthat not a trace of that antique worth is now left among us, I cannot\nbut at once marvel and grieve; at this inconsistency; and all the more\nbecause I perceive that, in civil disputes between citizens, and in the\nbodily disorders into which men fall, recourse is always had to the\ndecisions and remedies, pronounced or prescribed by the ancients.\nFor the civil law is no more than the opinions delivered by the ancient\njurisconsults, which, being reduced to a system, teach the\njurisconsults of our own times how to determine; while the healing art\nis simply the recorded experience of the old physicians, on which our\nmodern physicians found their practice. And yet, in giving laws to a\ncommonwealth, in maintaining States and governing kingdoms, in\norganizing armies and conducting wars, in dealing with subject nations,\nand in extending a State\u2019s dominions, we find no prince, no republic,\nno captain, and no citizen who resorts to the example of the ancients.\nThis I persuade myself is due, not so much to the feebleness to which\nthe present methods of education have brought the world, or to the\ninjury which a pervading apathy has wrought in many provinces and\ncities of Christendom, as to the want of a right intelligence of\nHistory, which renders men incapable in reading it to extract its true\nmeaning or to relish its flavour. Whence it happens that by far the\ngreater number of those who read History, take pleasure in following\nthe variety of incidents which it presents, without a thought to\nimitate them; judging such imitation to be not only difficult but\nimpossible; as though the heavens, the sun, the elements, and man\nhimself were no longer the same as they formerly were as regards\nmotion, order, and power.\nDesiring to rescue men from this error, I have thought fit to note down\nwith respect to all those books of Titus Livius which have escaped the\nmalignity of Time, whatever seems to me essential to a right\nunderstanding of ancient and modern affairs; so that any who shall read\nthese remarks of mine, may reap from them that profit for the sake of\nwhich a knowledge of History is to be sought. And although the task be\narduous, still, with the help of those at whose instance I assumed the\nburthen, I hope to carry it forward so far, that another shall have no\nlong way to go to bring it to its destination.\nCHAPTER I.\u2014_Of the Beginnings of Cities in general, and in particular\nof that of Rome._\nNo one who reads how the city of Rome had its beginning, who were its\nfounders, and what its ordinances and laws, will marvel that so much\nexcellence was maintained in it through many ages, or that it grew\nafterwards to be so great an Empire.\nAnd, first, as touching its origin, I say, that all cities have been\nfounded either by the people of the country in which they stand, or by\nstrangers. Cities have their origins in the former of these two ways\nwhen the inhabitants of a country find that they cannot live securely\nif they live dispersed in many and small societies, each of them\nunable, whether from its situation or its slender numbers, to stand\nalone against the attacks of its enemies; on whose approach there is no\ntime left to unite for defence without abandoning many strongholds, and\nthus becoming an easy prey to the invader. To escape which dangers,\nwhether of their own motion or at the instance of some of greater\nauthority among them, they restrict themselves to dwell together in\ncertain places, which they think will be more convenient to live in and\neasier to defend.\nAmong many cities taking their origin in this way were Athens and\nVenice; the former of which, for reasons like those just now mentioned,\nwas built by a scattered population under the direction of Theseus. To\nescape the wars which, on the decay of the Roman Empire daily renewed\nin Italy by the arrival of fresh hordes of Barbarians, numerous\nrefugees, sheltering in certain little islands in a corner of the\nAdriatic Sea, gave beginning to Venice; where, without any recognized\nleader to direct them, they agreed to live together under such laws as\nthey thought best suited to maintain them. And by reason of the\nprolonged tranquility which their position secured, they being\nprotected by the narrow sea and by the circumstance that the tribes who\nthen harassed Italy had no ships wherewith to molest them, they were\nable from very small beginnings to attain to that greatness they now\nenjoy.\nIn the second case, namely of a city being founded by strangers, the\nsettlers are either wholly independent, or they are controlled by\nothers, as where colonies are sent forth either by a prince or by a\nrepublic, to relieve their countries of an excessive population, or to\ndefend newly acquired territories which it is sought to secure at small\ncost. Of this sort many cities were settled by the Romans, and in all\nparts of their dominions. It may also happen that such cities are\nfounded by a prince merely to add to his renown, without any intention\non his part to dwell there, as Alexandria was built by Alexander the\nGreat. Cities like these, not having had their beginning in freedom,\nseldom make such progress as to rank among the chief towns of kingdoms.\nThe city of Florence belongs to that class of towns which has not been\nindependent from the first; for whether we ascribe its origin to the\nsoldiers of Sylla, or, as some have conjectured, to the mountaineers of\nFiesole (who, emboldened by the long peace which prevailed throughout\nthe world during the reign of Octavianus, came down to occupy the plain\non the banks of the Arno), in either case, it was founded under the\nauspices of Rome nor could, at first, make other progress than was\npermitted by the grace of the sovereign State.\nThe origin of cities may be said to be independent when a people,\neither by themselves or under some prince, are constrained by famine,\npestilence, or war to leave their native land and seek a new\nhabitation. Settlers of this sort either establish themselves in cities\nwhich they find ready to their hand in the countries of which they take\npossession, as did Moses; or they build new ones, as did \u00c6neas. It is\nin this last case that the merits of a founder and the good fortune of\nthe city founded are best seen; and this good fortune will be more or\nless remarkable according to the greater or less capacity of him who\ngives the city its beginning.\nThe capacity of a founder is known in two ways: by his choice of a\nsite, or by the laws which he frames. And since men act either of\nnecessity or from choice, and merit may seem greater where choice is\nmore restricted, we have to consider whether it may not be well to\nchoose a sterile district as the site of a new city, in order that the\ninhabitants, being constrained to industry, and less corrupted by ease,\nmay live in closer union, finding less cause for division in the\npoverty of their land; as was the case in Ragusa, and in many other\ncities built in similar situations. Such a choice were certainly the\nwisest and the most advantageous, could men be content to enjoy what is\ntheir own without seeking to lord it over others. But since to be safe\nthey must be strong, they are compelled avoid these barren districts,\nand to plant themselves in more fertile regions; where, the\nfruitfulness of the soil enabling them to increase and multiply, they\nmay defend themselves against any who attack them, and overthrow any\nwho would withstand their power.\nAnd as for that languor which the situation might breed, care must be\nhad that hardships which the site does not enforce, shall be enforced\nby the laws; and that the example of those wise nations be imitated,\nwho, inhabiting most fruitful and delightful countries, and such as\nwere likely to rear a listless and effeminate race, unfit for all manly\nexercises, in order to obviate the mischief wrought by the amenity and\nrelaxing influence of the soil and climate, subjected all who were to\nserve as soldiers to the severest training; whence it came that better\nsoldiers were raised in these countries than in others by nature rugged\nand barren. Such, of old, was the kingdom of the Egyptians, which,\nthough of all lands the most bountiful, yet, by the severe training\nwhich its laws enforced, produced most valiant soldiers, who, had their\nnames not been lost in antiquity, might be thought to deserve more\npraise than Alexander the Great and many besides, whose memory is still\nfresh in men\u2019s minds. And even in recent times, any one contemplating\nthe kingdom of the Soldan, and the military order of the Mamelukes\nbefore they were destroyed by Selim the Grand Turk, must have seen how\ncarefully they trained their soldiers in every kind of warlike\nexercise; showing thereby how much they dreaded that indolence to which\ntheir genial soil and climate might have disposed them, unless\nneutralized by strenuous laws. I say, then, that it is a prudent choice\nto found your city in a fertile region when the effects of that\nfertility are duly balanced by the restraint of the laws.\nWhen Alexander the Great thought to add to his renown by founding a\ncity, Dinocrates the architect came and showed him how he might build\nit on Mount Athos, which not only offered a strong position, but could\nbe handled that the city built there might present a semblance of the\nhuman form, which would be a thing strange and striking, and worthy of\nso great a monarch. But on Alexander asking how the inhabitants were to\nlive, Dinocrates answered that he had not thought of that. Whereupon,\nAlexander laughed, and leaving Mount Athos as it stood, built\nAlexandria; where, the fruitfulness of the soil, and the vicinity of\nthe Nile and the sea, might attract many to take up their abode.\nTo him, therefore, who inquires into the origin of Rome, if he assign\nits beginning to \u00c6neas, it will seem to be of those cities which were\nfounded by strangers if to Romulus, then of those founded by the\nnatives of the country. But in whichever class we place it, it will be\nseen to have had its beginning in freedom, and not in subjection to\nanother State. It will be seen, too, as hereafter shall be noted, how\nstrict was the discipline which the laws instituted by Romulus, Numa,\nand its other founders made compulsory upon it; so that neither its\nfertility, the proximity of the sea, the number of its victories, nor\nthe extent of its dominion, could for many centuries corrupt it, but,\non the contrary, maintained it replete with such virtues as were never\nmatched in any other commonwealth.\nAnd because the things done by Rome, and which Titus Livius has\ncelebrated, were effected at home or abroad by public or by private\nwisdom, I shall begin by treating, and noting the consequences of those\nthings done at home in accordance with the public voice, which seem\nmost to merit attention; and to this object the whole of this first\nBook or first Part of my Discourses, shall be directed.\nCHAPTER II.\u2014Of the various kinds of Government; and to which of them\nthe Roman Commonwealth belonged.\nI forego all discussion concerning those cities which at the outset\nhave been dependent upon others, and shall speak only of those which\nfrom their earliest beginnings have stood entirely clear of all foreign\ncontrol, being governed from the first as pleased themselves, whether\nas republics or as princedoms.\nThese as they have had different origins, so likewise have had\ndifferent laws and institutions. For to some at their very first\ncommencement, or not long after, laws have been given by a single\nlegislator, and all at one time; like those given by Lycurgus to the\nSpartans; while to others they have been given at different times, as\nneed rose or accident determined; as in the case of Rome. That\nrepublic, indeed, may be called happy, whose lot has been to have a\nfounder so prudent as to provide for it laws under which it can\ncontinue to live securely, without need to amend them; as we find\nSparta preserving hers for eight hundred years, without deterioration\nand without any dangerous disturbance. On the other hand, some measure\nof unhappiness attaches to the State which, not having yielded itself\nonce for all into the hands of a single wise legislator, is obliged to\nrecast its institutions for itself; and of such States, by far the most\nunhappy is that which is furthest removed from a sound system of\ngovernment, by which I mean that its institutions lie wholly outside\nthe path which might lead it to a true and perfect end. For it is\nscarcely possible that a State in this position can ever, by any\nchance, set itself to rights, whereas another whose institutions are\nimperfect, if it have made a good beginning and such as admits of its\namendment, may in the course of events arrive at perfection. It is\ncertain, however, that such States can never be reformed without great\nrisk; for, as a rule, men will accept no new law altering the\ninstitutions of their State, unless the necessity for such a change be\ndemonstrated; and since this necessity cannot arise without danger, the\nState may easily be overthrown before the new order of things is\nestablished. In proof whereof we may instance the republic of Florence,\nwhich was reformed in the year 1502, in consequence of the affair of\nArezzo, but was ruined in 1512, in consequence of the affair of Prato.\nDesiring, therefore, to discuss the nature of the government of Rome,\nand to ascertain the accidental circumstances which brought it to its\nperfection, I say, as has been said before by many who have written of\nGovernments, that of these there are three forms, known by the names\nMonarchy, Aristocracy, and Democracy, and that those who give its\ninstitutions to a State have recourse to one or other of these three,\naccording as it suits their purpose. Other, and, as many have thought,\nwiser teachers, will have it, that there are altogether six forms of\ngovernment, three of them utterly bad, the other three good in\nthemselves, but so readily corrupted that they too are apt to become\nhurtful. The good are the three above named; the bad, three others\ndependent upon these, and each so like that to which it is related,\nthat it is easy to pass imperceptibly from the one to the other. For a\nMonarchy readily becomes a Tyranny, an Aristocracy an Oligarchy, while\na Democracy tends to degenerate into Anarchy. So that if the founder of\na State should establish any one of these three forms of Government, he\nestablishes it for a short time only, since no precaution he may take\ncan prevent it from sliding into its contrary, by reason of the close\nresemblance which, in this case, the virtue bears to the vice.\nThese diversities in the form of Government spring up among men by\nchance. For in the beginning of the world, its inhabitants, being few\nin number, for a time lived scattered after the fashion of beasts; but\nafterwards, as they increased and multiplied, gathered themselves into\nsocieties, and, the better to protect themselves, began to seek who\namong them was the strongest and of the highest courage, to whom,\nmaking him their head, they tendered obedience. Next arose the\nknowledge of such things as are honourable and good, as opposed to\nthose which are bad and shameful. For observing that when a man wronged\nhis benefactor, hatred was universally felt for the one and sympathy\nfor the other, and that the ungrateful were blamed, while those who\nshowed gratitude were honoured, and reflecting that the wrongs they saw\ndone to others might be done to themselves, to escape these they\nresorted to making laws and fixing punishments against any who should\ntransgress them; and in this way grew the recognition of Justice.\nWhence it came that afterwards, in choosing their rulers, men no longer\nlooked about for the strongest, but for him who was the most prudent\nand the most just.\nBut, presently, when sovereignty grew to be hereditary and no longer\nelective, hereditary sovereigns began to degenerate from their\nancestors, and, quitting worthy courses, took up the notion that\nprinces had nothing to do but to surpass the rest of the world in\nsumptuous display and wantonness, and whatever else ministers to\npleasure so that the prince coming to be hated, and therefore to feel\nfear, and passing from fear to infliction of injuries, a tyranny soon\nsprang up. Forthwith there began movements to overthrow the prince, and\nplots and conspiracies against him undertaken not by those who were\nweak, or afraid for themselves, but by such as being conspicuous for\ntheir birth, courage, wealth, and station, could not tolerate the\nshameful life of the tyrant. The multitude, following the lead of these\npowerful men, took up arms against the prince and, he being got rid of,\nobeyed these others as their liberators; who, on their part, holding in\nhatred the name of sole ruler, formed themselves into a government and\nat first, while the recollection of past tyranny was still fresh,\nobserved the laws they themselves made, and postponing personal\nadvantage to the common welfare, administered affairs both publicly and\nprivately with the utmost diligence and zeal. But this government\npassing, afterwards, to their descendants who, never having been taught\nin the school of Adversity, knew nothing of the vicissitudes of\nFortune, these not choosing to rest content with mere civil equality,\nbut abandoning themselves to avarice, ambition, and lust, converted,\nwithout respect to civil rights what had been a government of the best\ninto a government of the few; and so very soon met with the same fate\nas the tyrant.\nFor the multitude loathing its rulers, lent itself to any who ventured,\nin whatever way, to attack them; when some one man speedily arose who\nwith the aid of the people overthrew them. But the recollection of the\ntyrant and of the wrongs suffered at his hands being still fresh in the\nminds of the people, who therefore felt no desire to restore the\nmonarchy, they had recourse to a popular government, which they\nestablished on such a footing that neither king nor nobles had any\nplace in it. And because all governments inspire respect at the first,\nthis government also lasted for a while, but not for long, and seldom\nafter the generation which brought it into existence had died out. For,\nsuddenly, liberty passed into license, wherein neither private worth\nnor public authority was respected, but, every one living as he liked,\na thousand wrongs were done daily. Whereupon, whether driven by\nnecessity, or on the suggestion of some wiser man among them and to\nescape anarchy, the people reverted to a monarchy, from which, step by\nstep, in the manner and for the causes already assigned, they came\nround once more to license. For this is the circle revolving within\nwhich all States are and have been governed; although in the same State\nthe same forms of Government rarely repeat themselves, because hardly\nany State can have such vitality as to pass through such a cycle more\nthan once, and still together. For it may be expected that in some sea\nof disaster, when a State must always be wanting prudent counsels and\nin strength, it will become subject to some neighbouring and\nbetter-governed State; though assuming this not to happen, it might\nwell pass for an indefinite period from one of these forms of\ngovernment to another.\nI say, then, that all these six forms of government are pernicious\u2014the\nthree good kinds, from their brief duration the three bad, from their\ninherent badness. Wise legislators therefore, knowing these defects,\nand avoiding each of these forms in its simplicity, have made choice of\na form which shares in the qualities of all the first three, and which\nthey judge to be more stable and lasting than any of these separately.\nFor where we have a monarchy, an aristocracy, and a democracy existing\ntogether in the same city, each of the three serves as a check upon the\nother.\nAmong those who have earned special praise by devising a constitution\nof this nature, was Lycurgus, who so framed the laws of Sparta as to\nassign their proper functions to kings, nobles, and commons; and in\nthis way established a government, which, to his great glory and to the\npeace and tranquility of his country, lasted for more than eight\nhundred years. The contrary, however, happened in the case of Solon;\nwho by the turn he gave to the institutions of Athens, created there a\npurely democratic government, of such brief duration, that he himself\nlived to witness the beginning of the despotism of Pisistratus. And\nalthough, forty years later, the heirs of Pisistratus were driven out,\nand Athens recovered her freedom, nevertheless because she reverted to\nthe same form government as had been established by Solon, she could\nmaintain it for only a hundred years more; for though to preserve it,\nmany ordinances were passed for repressing the ambition of the great\nand the turbulence of the people, against which Solon had not provided,\nstill, since neither the monarchic nor the aristocratic element was\ngiven a place in her constitution, Athens, as compared with Sparta, had\nbut a short life.\nBut let us now turn to Rome, which city, although she had no Lycurgus\nto give her from the first such a constitution as would preserve her\nlong in freedom, through a series of accidents, caused by the contests\nbetween the commons and the senate, obtained by chance what the\nforesight of her founders failed to provide. So that Fortune, if she\nbestowed not her first favours on Rome, bestowed her second; because,\nalthough the original institutions of this city were defective, still\nthey lay not outside the true path which could bring them to\nperfection. For Romulus and the other kings made many and good laws,\nand such as were not incompatible with freedom; but because they sought\nto found a kingdom and not a commonwealth, when the city became free\nmany things were found wanting which in the interest of liberty it was\nnecessary to supply, since these kings had not supplied them. And\nalthough the kings of Rome lost their sovereignty, in the manner and\nfor the causes mentioned above, nevertheless those who drove them out,\nby at once creating two consuls to take their place, preserved in Rome\nthe regal authority while banishing from it the regal throne, so that\nas both senate and consuls were included in that republic, it in fact\npossessed two of the elements above enumerated, to wit, the monarchic\nand the aristocratic.\nIt then only remained to assign its place to the popular element, and\nthe Roman nobles growing insolent from causes which shall be noticed\nhereafter, the commons against them, when, not to lose the whole of\ntheir power, they were forced to concede a share to the people; while\nwith the share which remained, the senate and consuls retained so much\nauthority that they still held their own place in the republic. In this\nway the tribunes of the people came to be created, after whose creation\nthe stability of the State was much augmented, since each the three\nforms of government had now its due influence allowed it. And such was\nthe good fortune of Rome that although her government passed from the\nkings to the nobles, and from these to the people, by the steps and for\nthe reasons noticed above, still the entire authority of the kingly\nelement was not sacrificed to strengthen the authority of the nobles,\nnor were the nobles divested of their authority to bestow it on the\ncommons; but three, blending together, made up a perfect State; which\nperfection, as shall be fully shown in the next two Chapters, was\nreached through the dissensions of the commons and the senate.\nCHAPTER III.\u2014Of the Accidents which led in Rome to the creation of\nTribunes of the People; whereby the Republic was made more perfect.\nThey who lay the foundations of a State and furnish it with laws must,\nas is shown by all who have treated of civil government, and by\nexamples of which history is full, assume that \u2018all men are bad, and\nwill always, when they have free field, give loose to their evil\ninclinations; and that if these for a while remain hidden, it is owing\nto some secret cause, which, from our having no contrary experience, we\ndo not recognize at once, but which is afterwards revealed by Time, of\nwhom we speak as the father of all truth.\nIn Rome, after the expulsion of the Tarquins, it seemed as though the\nclosest union prevailed between the senate and the commons, and that\nthe nobles, laying aside their natural arrogance, had learned so to\nsympathize with the people as to have become supportable by all, even\nof the humblest rank. This dissimulation remained undetected, and its\ncauses concealed, while the Tarquins lived; for the nobles dreading the\nTarquins, and fearing that the people, if they used them ill, might\ntake part against them, treated them with kindness. But no sooner were\nthe Tarquins got rid of, and the nobles thus relieved of their fears,\nwhen they began to spit forth against the commons all the venom which\nbefore they had kept in their breasts, offending and insulting them in\nevery way they could; confirming what I have observed already, that men\nnever behave well unless compelled, and that whenever they are free to\nact as they please, and are under no restraint everything falls at once\ninto confusion and disorder. Wherefore it has been said that as poverty\nand hunger are needed to make men industrious, so laws are needed to\nmake them good. When we do well without laws, laws are not needed; but\nwhen good customs are absent, laws are at once required.\nOn the extinction of the Tarquins, therefore, the dread of whom had\nkept the nobles in check, some new safeguard had to be contrived, which\nshould effect the same result as had been effected by the Tarquins\nwhile they lived. Accordingly, after much uproar and confusion, and\nmuch danger of violence ensuing between the commons and the nobles, to\ninsure the safety of the former, tribunes were created, and were\ninvested with such station and authority as always afterwards enabled\nthem to stand between the people and the senate, and to resist the\ninsolence of the nobles.\nCHAPTER IV.\u2014That the Dissensions between the Senate and Commons of\nRome, made Rome free and powerful.\nTouching those tumults which prevailed in Rome from the extinction of\nthe Tarquins to the creation of the tribunes the discussion of which I\nhave no wish to avoid, and as to certain other matters of a like\nnature, I desire to say something in opposition to the opinion of many\nwho assert that Rome was a turbulent city, and had fallen into utter\ndisorder, that had not her good fortune and military prowess made\namends for other defects, she would have been inferior to every other\nrepublic.\nI cannot indeed deny that the good fortune and the armies of Rome were\nthe causes of her empire; yet it certainly seems to me that those\nholding this opinion fail to perceive, that in a State where there are\ngood soldiers there must be good order, and, generally speaking, good\nfortune. And looking to the other circumstances of this city, I affirm\nthat those who condemn these dissensions between the nobles and the\ncommons, condemn what was the prime cause of Rome becoming free; and\ngive more heed to the tumult and uproar wherewith these dissensions\nwere attended, than to the good results which followed from them; not\nreflecting that while in every republic there are two conflicting\nfactions, that of the people and that of the nobles, it is in this\nconflict that all laws favourable to freedom have their origin, as may\nreadily be seen to have been the case in Rome. For from the time of the\nTarquins to that of the Gracchi, a period of over three hundred years,\nthe tumults in Rome seldom gave occasion to punishment by exile, and\nvery seldom to bloodshed. So that we cannot truly declare those tumults\nto have been disastrous, or that republic to have been disorderly,\nwhich during all that time, on account of her internal broils, banished\nno more than eight or ten of her citizens, put very few to death, and\nrarely inflicted money penalties. Nor can we reasonably pronounce that\ncity ill-governed wherein we find so many instances of virtue; for\nvirtuous actions have their origin in right training, right training in\nwise laws, and wise laws in these very tumults which many would\nthoughtlessly condemn. For he who looks well to the results of these\ntumults will find that they did not lead to banishments, nor to\nviolence hurtful to the common good, but to laws and ordinances\nbeneficial to the public liberty. And should any object that the\nbehaviour of the Romans was extravagant and outrageous; that for the\nassembled people to be heard shouting against the senate, the senate\nagainst the people; for the whole commons to be seen rushing wildly\nthrough the streets, closing their shops, and quitting the town, were\nthings which might well affright him even who only reads of them; it\nmay be answered, that the inhabitants of all cities, more especially of\ncities which seek to make use of the people in matters of importance,\nhave their own ways of giving expression to their wishes; among which\nthe city of Rome had the custom, that when its people sought to have a\nlaw passed they followed one or another of those courses mentioned\nabove, or else refused to be enrolled as soldiers when, to pacify them,\nsomething of their demands had to be conceded. But the demands of a\nfree people are hurtful to freedom, since they originate either in\nbeing oppressed, or in the fear that they are about to be so. When this\nfear is groundless, it finds its remedy in public meetings, wherein\nsome worthy person may come forward and show the people by argument\nthat they are deceiving themselves. For though they be ignorant, the\npeople are not therefore, as Cicero says, incapable of being taught the\ntruth, but are readily convinced when it is told them by one in whose\nhonesty they can trust.\nWe should, therefore, be careful how we censure the government of Rome,\nand should reflect that all the great results effected by that\nrepublic, could not have come about without good cause. And if the\npopular tumults led the creation of the tribunes, they merit all\npraise; since these magistrates not only gave its due influence to the\npopular voice in the government, but also acted as the guardians of\nRoman freedom, as shall be clearly shown in the following Chapter.\nCHAPTER V.\u2014_Whether the Guardianship of public Freedom is safer in the\nhands of the Commons or of the Nobles; and whether those who seek to\nacquire Power or they who seek to maintain it are the greater cause of\nCommotions._\nOf the provisions made by wise founders of republics, one of the most\nnecessary is for the creation of a guardianship of liberty; for\naccording as this is placed in good or bad hands, the freedom of the\nState will be more or less lasting. And because in every republic we\nfind the two parties of nobles and commons, the question arises, to\nwhich of these two this guardianship can most safely be entrusted.\nAmong the Laced\u00e6monians of old, as now with the Venetians, it was\nplaced in the hands of the nobles, but with the Romans it was vested in\nthe commons. We have, therefore, to determine which of these States\nmade the wiser choice. If we look to reasons, something is to be said\non both sides of the question; though were we to look to results, we\nshould have to pronounce in favour of the nobles, inasmuch as the\nliberty of Sparta and Venice has had a longer life than that of Rome.\nAs touching reasons, it may be pleaded for the Roman method, that they\nare most fit to have charge of a thing, who least desire to pervert it\nto their own ends. And, doubtless, if we examine the aims which the\nnobles and the commons respectively set before them, we shall find in\nthe former a great desire to dominate, in the latter merely a desire\nnot to be dominated over, and hence a greater attachment to freedom,\nsince they have less to gain than the others by destroying it.\nWherefore, when the commons are put forward as the defenders of\nliberty, they may be expected to take better care of it, and, as they\nhave no desire to tamper with it themselves, to be less apt to suffer\nothers to do so.\nOn the other hand, he who defends the method followed by the Spartans\nand Venetians, may urge, that by confiding this guardianship to the\nnobles, two desirable ends are served: first, that from being allowed\nto retain in their own hands a weapon which makes them the stronger\nparty in the State, the ambition of this class is more fully satisfied;\nand, second, that an authority is withdrawn from the unstable multitude\nwhich as used by them is likely to lead to endless disputes and\ntumults, and to drive the nobles into dangerous and desperate courses.\nIn instance whereof might be cited the case of Rome itself, wherein the\ntribunes of the people being vested with this authority, not content to\nhave one consul a plebeian, insisted on having both; and afterwards\nlaid claim to the censorship, the pr\u00e6torship and all the other\nmagistracies in the city. Nor was this enough for them, but, carried\naway by the same factious spirit, they began after a time to pay court\nto such men as they thought able to attack the nobility, and so gave\noccasion to the rise of Marius and the overthrow of Rome.\nWherefore one who weighs both sides of the question well, might\nhesitate which party he should choose as the guardian of public\nliberty, being uncertain which class is more mischievous in a\ncommonwealth, that which would acquire what it has not, or that which\nwould keep the authority which it has already. But, on the whole, on a\ncareful balance of arguments we may sum up thus:\u2014Either we have to deal\nwith a republic eager like Rome to extend its power, or with one\ncontent merely to maintain itself; in the former case it is necessary\nto do in all things as Rome did; in the latter, for the reasons and in\nthe manner to be shown in the following Chapter, we may imitate Venice\nand Sparta.\nBut reverting to the question which class of citizens is more\nmischievous in a republic, those who seek to acquire or those who fear\nto lose what they have acquired already, I note that when Marcus\nMenenius and Marcus Fulvius, both of them men of plebeian birth, were\nmade the one dictator, the other master of the knights, that they might\ninquire into certain plots against Rome contrived in Capua, they had at\nthe same time authority given them by the people to investigate\nwhether, in Rome itself, irregular and corrupt practices had been used\nto obtain the consulship and other honours of the city. The nobles\nsuspecting that the powers thus conferred were to be turned against\nthem, everywhere gave out that if honours had been sought by any by\nirregular and unworthy means, it was not by them, but by the plebeians,\nwho, with neither birth nor merit to recommend them, had need to resort\nto corruption. And more particularly they accused the dictator himself.\nAnd so telling was the effect of these charges, that Menenius, after\nharanguing the people and complaining to them of the calumnies\ncirculated against him, laid down his dictatorship, and submitted\nhimself to whatever judgment might be passed upon him. When his cause\ncame to be tried he was acquitted; but at the hearing it was much\ndebated, whether he who would retain power or he who would acquire it,\nis the more dangerous citizen; the desires of both being likely to lead\nto the greatest disorders.\nNevertheless, I believe that, as a rule, disorders are more commonly\noccasioned by those seeking to preserve power, because in them the fear\nof loss breeds the same passions as are felt by those seeking to\nacquire; since men never think they hold what they have securely,\nunless when they are gaining something new from others. It is also to\nbe said that their position enables them to operate changes with less\neffort and greater efficacy. Further, it may be added, that their\ncorrupt and insolent behaviour inflames the minds of those who have\nnothing, with the desire to have; either for the sake of punishing\ntheir adversaries by despoiling them, or to obtain for themselves a\nshare of those riches and honours which they see the others abuse.\nCHAPTER VI.\u2014_Whether it was possible in Rome to contrive such a\nGovernment as would have composed the Differences between the Commons\nand the Senate._\nI have spoken above of the effects produced in Rome by the\ncontroversies between the commons and the senate. Now, as these lasted\ndown to the time of the Gracchi, when they brought about the overthrow\nof freedom, some may think it matter for regret that Rome should not\nhave achieved the great things she did, without being torn by such\ndisputes. Wherefore, it seems to me worth while to consider whether the\ngovernment of Rome could ever have been constituted in such a way as to\nprevent like controversies.\nIn making this inquiry we must first look to those republics which have\nenjoyed freedom for a great while, undisturbed by any violent\ncontentions or tumults, and see what their government was, and whether\nit would have been possible to introduce it into Rome. Of such\nrepublics we have an example in ancient times in Sparta, in modern\ntimes in Venice, of both which States I have already made mention.\nSparta created for herself a government consisting of a king and a\nlimited senate. Venice has made no distinction in the titles of her\nrulers, all qualified to take part in her government being classed\nunder the one designation of \u201cGentlemen,\u201d an arrangement due rather to\nchance than to the foresight of those who gave this State its\nconstitution. For many persons, from causes already noticed, seeking\nshelter on these rocks on which Venice now stands, after they had so\nmultiplied that if they were to continue to live together it became\nnecessary for them to frame laws, established a form of government; and\nassembling often in their councils to consult for the interests of\ntheir city, when it seemed to them that their numbers were sufficient\nfor political existence, they closed the entrance to civil rights\nagainst all who came afterwards to live there, not allowing them to\ntake any part in the management of affairs. And when in course of time\nthere came to be many citizens excluded from the government, to add to\nthe importance of the governing body, they named these \u201cGentlemen\u201d\n(_gentiluomini_), the others \u201cPlebeians\u201d (_popolani_). And this\ndistinction could grow up and maintain itself without causing\ndisturbance; for as at the time of its origin, whosoever then lived in\nVenice was made one of the governing body, none had reason to complain;\nwhile those who came to live there afterwards, finding the government\nin a completed form, had neither ground nor opportunity to object. No\nground, because nothing was taken from them; and no opportunity,\nbecause those in authority kept them under control, and never employed\nthem in affairs in which they could acquire importance. Besides which,\nthey who came later to dwell in Venice were not so numerous as to\ndestroy all proportion between the governors and the governed; the\nnumber of the \u201cGentlemen\u201d being as great as, or greater than that of\nthe \u201cPlebeians.\u201d For these reasons, therefore, it was possible for\nVenice to make her constitution what it is, and to maintain it without\ndivisions.\nSparta, again, being governed, as I have said, by a king and a limited\nsenate, was able to maintain herself for the long period she did,\nbecause, from the country being thinly inhabited and further influx of\npopulation forbidden, and from the laws of Lycurgus (the observance\nwhereof removed all ground of disturbance) being held in high esteem,\nthe citizens were able to continue long in unity. For Lycurgus having\nby his laws established in Sparta great equality as to property, but\nless equality as to rank, there prevailed there an equal poverty; and\nthe commons were less ambitious, because the offices of the State,\nwhich were held to their exclusion, were confined to a few; and because\nthe nobles never by harsh treatment aroused in them any desire to usurp\nthese offices. And this was due to the Spartan kings, who, being\nappointed to that dignity for life, and placed in the midst of this\nnobility, had no stronger support to their authority than in defending\nthe people against injustice. Whence it resulted that as the people\nneither feared nor coveted the power which they did not possess, the\nconflicts which might have arisen between them and the nobles were\nescaped, together with the causes which would have led to them; and in\nthis way they were able to live long united. But of this unity in\nSparta there were two chief causes: one, the fewness of its\ninhabitants, which allowed of their being governed by a few; the other,\nthat by denying foreigners admission into their country, the people had\nless occasion to become corrupted, and never so increased in numbers as\nto prove troublesome to their few rulers.\nWeighing all which circumstances, we see that to have kept Rome in the\nsame tranquility wherein these republics were kept, one of two courses\nmust have been followed by her legislators; for either, like the\nVenetians, they must have refrained from employing the commons in war,\nor else, like the Spartans, they must have closed their country to\nforeigners. Whereas, in both particulars, they did the opposite, arming\nthe commons and increasing their number, and thus affording endless\noccasions for disorder. And had the Roman commonwealth grown to be more\ntranquil, this inconvenience would have resulted, that it must at the\nsame time have grown weaker, since the road would have been closed to\nthat greatness to which it came, for in removing the causes of her\ntumults, Rome must have interfered with the causes of her growth.\nAnd he who looks carefully into the matter will find, that in all human\naffairs, we cannot rid ourselves of one inconvenience without running\ninto another. So that if you would have your people numerous and\nwarlike, to the end that with their aid you may establish a great\nempire, you will have them of such a sort as you cannot afterwards\ncontrol at your pleasure; while should you keep them few and unwarlike,\nto the end that you may govern them easily, you will be unable, should\nyou extend your dominions, to preserve them, and will become so\ncontemptible as to be the prey of any who attack you. For which reason\nin all our deliberations we ought to consider where we are likely to\nencounter least inconvenience, and accept that as the course to be\npreferred, since we shall never find any line of action entirely free\nfrom disadvantage.\nRome might, therefore, following the example of Sparta, have created a\nking for life and a senate of limited numbers, but desiring to become a\ngreat empire, she could not, like Sparta, have restricted the number of\nher citizens. So that to have created a king for life and a limited\nsenate had been of little service to her.\nWere any one, therefore, about to found a wholly new republic, he would\nhave to consider whether he desired it to increase as Rome did in\nterritory and dominion, or to continue within narrow limits. In the\nformer case he would have to shape its constitution as nearly as\npossible on the pattern of the Roman, leaving room for dissensions and\npopular tumults, for without a great and warlike population no republic\ncan ever increase, or increasing maintain itself. In the second case he\nmight give his republic a constitution like that of Venice or Sparta;\nbut since extension is the ruin of such republics, the legislator would\nhave to provide in every possible way against the State which he had\nfounded making any additions to its territories. For these, when\nsuperimposed upon a feeble republic, are sure to be fatal to it: as we\nsee to have been the case with Sparta and Venice, the former of which,\nafter subjugating nearly all Greece, on sustaining a trifling reverse,\nbetrayed the insufficiency of her foundations, for when, after the\nrevolt of Thebes under Pelopidas, other cities also rebelled, the\nSpartan kingdom was utterly overthrown. Venice in like manner, after\ngaining possession of a great portion of Italy (most of it not by her\narms but by her wealth and subtlety), when her strength was put to the\nproof, lost all in one pitched battle.\nI can well believe, then, that to found a republic which shall long\nendure, the best plan may be to give it internal institutions like\nthose of Sparta or Venice; placing it in a naturally strong situation,\nand so fortifying it that none can expect to get the better of it\neasily, yet, at the same time, not making it so great as to be\nformidable to its neighbours; since by taking these precautions, it\nmight long enjoy its independence. For there are two causes which lead\nto wars being made against a republic; one, your desire to be its\nmaster, the other the fear lest it should master you; both of which\ndangers the precaution indicated will go far to remove. For if, as we\nare to assume, this republic be well prepared for defence, and\nconsequently difficult of attack, it will seldom or never happen that\nany one will form the design to attack it, and while it keeps within\nits own boundaries, and is seen from experience not to be influenced by\nambition, no one will be led, out of fear for himself, to make war upon\nit, more particularly when its laws and constitution forbid its\nextension. And were it possible to maintain things in this equilibrium,\nI veritably believe that herein would be found the true form of\npolitical life, and the true tranquility of a republic. But all human\naffairs being in movement, and incapable of remaining as they are, they\nmust either rise or fall; and to many conclusions to which we are not\nled by reason, we are brought by necessity. So that when we have given\ninstitutions to a State on the footing that it is to maintain itself\nwithout enlargement, should necessity require its enlargement, its\nfoundations will be cut from below it, and its downfall quickly ensue.\nOn the other hand, were a republic so favoured by Heaven as to lie\nunder no necessity of making war, the result of this ease would be to\nmake it effeminate and divided which two evils together, and each by\nitself, would insure its ruin. And since it is impossible, as I\nbelieve, to bring about an equilibrium, or to adhere strictly to the\nmean path, we must, in arranging our republic, consider what is the\nmore honourable course for it to take, and so contrive that even if\nnecessity compel its enlargement, it may be able to keep what it gains.\nBut returning to the point first raised, I believe it necessary for us\nto follow the method of the Romans and not that of the other republics,\nfor I know of no middle way. We must, consequently, put up with those\ndissensions which arise between commons and senate, looking on them as\nevils which cannot be escaped if we would arrive at the greatness of\nRome.\nIn connection with the arguments here used to prove that the authority\nof the tribunes was essential in Rome to the guardianship of freedom,\nwe may naturally go on to show what advantages result to a republic\nfrom the power of impeachment; which, together with others, was\nconferred upon the tribunes; a subject to be noticed in the following\nChapter.\nCHAPTER VII.\u2014_That to preserve Liberty in a State there must exist the\nRight to accuse._\nTo those set forward in a commonwealth as guardians of public freedom,\nno more useful or necessary authority can be given than the power to\naccuse, either before the people, or before some council or tribunal,\nthose citizens who in any way have offended against the liberty of\ntheir country.\nA law of this kind has two effects most beneficial to a State: _first,_\nthat the citizens from fear of being accused, do not engage in attempts\nhurtful to the State, or doing so, are put down at once and without\nrespect of persons: and _next,_ that a vent is given for the escape of\nall those evil humours which, from whatever cause, gather in cities\nagainst particular citizens; for unless an outlet be duly provided for\nthese by the laws, they flow into irregular channels and overwhelm the\nState. There is nothing, therefore, which contributes so much to the\nstability and permanence of a State, as to take care that the\nfermentation of these disturbing humours be supplied by operation of\nlaw with a recognized outlet. This might be shown by many examples, but\nby none so clearly as by that of Coriolanus related by Livius, where he\ntells us, that at a time when the Roman nobles were angry with the\nplebeians (thinking that the appointment of tribunes for their\nprotection had made them too powerful), it happened that Rome was\nvisited by a grievous famine, to meet which the senate sent to Sicily\nfor corn. But Coriolanus, hating the commons, sought to persuade the\nsenate that now was the time to punish them, and to deprive them of the\nauthority which they had usurped to the prejudice of the nobles, by\nwithholding the distribution of corn, and so suffering them to perish\nof hunger. Which advice of his coming to the ears of the people,\nkindled them to such fury against him, that they would have slain him\nas he left the Senate House, had not the tribunes cited him to appear\nand answer before them to a formal charge.\nIn respect of this incident I repeat what I have just now said, how\nuseful and necessary it is for republics to provide by their laws a\nchannel by which the displeasure of the multitude against a single\ncitizen may find a vent. For when none such is regularly provided,\nrecourse will be had to irregular channels, and these will assuredly\nlead to much worse results. For when a citizen is borne down by the\noperation of the ordinary laws, even though he be wronged, little or no\ndisturbance is occasioned to the state: the injury he suffers not being\nwrought by private violence, nor by foreign force, which are the causes\nof the overthrow of free institutions, but by public authority and in\naccordance with public ordinances, which, having definite limits set\nthem, are not likely to pass beyond these so as to endanger the\ncommonwealth. For proof of which I am content to rest on this old\nexample of Coriolanus, since all may see what a disaster it would have\nbeen for Rome had he been violently put to death by the people. For, as\nbetween citizen and citizen, a wrong would have been done affording\nground for fear, fear would have sought defence, defence have led to\nfaction, faction to divisions in the State, and these to its ruin. But\nthe matter being taken up by those whose office it was to deal with it,\nall the evils which must have followed had it been left in private\nhands were escaped.\nIn Florence, on the other hand, and in our own days, we have seen what\nviolent commotions follow when the people cannot show their displeasure\nagainst particular citizens in a form recognized by the laws, in the\ninstance of Francesco Valori, at one time looked upon as the foremost\ncitizen of our republic. But many thinking him ambitious, and likely\nfrom his high spirit and daring to overstep the limits of civil\nfreedom, and there being no way to oppose him save by setting up an\nadverse faction, the result was, that, apprehending irregular attacks,\nhe sought to gain partisans for his support; while his opponents, on\ntheir side, having no course open to them of which the laws approved,\nresorted to courses of which the laws did not approve, and, at last, to\nopen violence. And as his influence had to be attacked by unlawful\nmethods, these were attended by injury not to him only, but to many\nother noble citizens; whereas, could he have been met by constitutional\nrestraints, his power might have been broken without injury to any save\nhimself. I might also cite from our Florentine history the fall of\nPiero Soderini, which had no other cause than there not being in our\nrepublic any law under which powerful and ambitious citizens can be\nimpeached. For to form a tribunal by which a powerful citizen is to be\ntried, eight judges only are not enough; the judges must be numerous,\nbecause a few will always do the will of a few. But had there been\nproper methods for obtaining redress, either the people would have\nimpeached Piero if he was guilty, and thus have given vent to their\ndispleasure without calling in the Spanish army; or if he was innocent,\nwould not have ventured, through fear of being accused themselves, to\nhave taken proceedings against him. So that in either case the bitter\nspirit which was the cause of all the disorder would have had an end.\nWherefore, when we find one of the parties in a State calling in a\nforeign power, we may safely conclude that it is because the defective\nlaws of that State provide no escape for those malignant humours which\nare natural to men; which can best be done by arranging for an\nimpeachment before a sufficient number of judges, and by giving\ncountenance to this procedure. This was so well contrived in Rome that\nin spite of the perpetual struggle maintained between the commons and\nthe senate, neither the senate nor the commons, nor any single citizen,\never sought redress at the hands of a foreign power; for having a\nremedy at home, there was no need to seek one abroad.\nAlthough the examples above cited be proof sufficient of what I affirm,\nI desire to adduce one other, recorded by Titus Livius in his history,\nwhere he relates that a sister of Aruns having been violated by a\nLucumo of Clusium, the chief of the Etruscan towns, Aruns being unable,\nfrom the interest of her ravisher, to avenge her, betook himself to the\nGauls who ruled in the province we now name Lombardy, and besought them\nto come with an armed force to Clusium; showing them how with advantage\nto themselves they might avenge his wrongs. Now, had Aruns seen that he\ncould have had redress through the laws of his country, he never would\nhave resorted to these Barbarians for help.\nBut as the right to accuse is beneficial in a republic, so calumny, on\nthe other hand, is useless and hurtful, as in the following Chapter I\nshall proceed to show.\nCHAPTER VIII.\u2014_That Calumny is as hurtful in a Commonwealth as the\npower to accuse is useful._\nSuch were the services rendered to Rome by Furius Camillus in rescuing\nher from the oppression of the Gauls, that no Roman, however high his\ndegree or station, held it derogatory to yield place to him, save only\nManlius Capitolinus, who could not brook such glory and distinction\nbeing given to another. For he thought that in saving the Capitol, he\nhad himself done as much as Camillus to preserve Rome, and that in\nrespect of his other warlike achievements he was no whit behind him. So\nthat, bursting with jealousy, and unable to remain at rest by reason of\nthe other\u2019s renown, and seeing no way to sow discord among the Fathers,\nhe set himself to spread abroad sinister reports among the commons;\nthrowing out, among other charges, that the treasure collected to be\ngiven to the Gauls, but which, afterwards, was withheld, had been\nembezzled by certain citizens, and if recovered might be turned to\npublic uses in relieving the people from taxes or from private debts.\nThese assertions so prevailed with the commons that they began to hold\nmeetings and to raise what tumults they liked throughout the city. But\nthis displeasing the senate, and the matter appearing to them grave and\ndangerous, they appointed a dictator to inquire into it, and to\nrestrain the attacks of Manlius. The dictator, forthwith, caused\nManlius to be cited before him; and these two were thus brought face to\nface in the presence of the whole city, the dictator surrounded by the\nnobles, and Manlius by the commons. The latter, being desired to say\nwith whom the treasure of which he had spoken was to be found, since\nthe senate were as anxious to know this as the commons, made no direct\nreply, but answered evasively that it was needless to tell them what\nthey already knew. Whereupon the dictator ordered him to prison.\nIn this passage we are taught how hateful a thing is calumny in all\nfree States, as, indeed, in every society, and how we must neglect no\nmeans which may serve to check it. And there can be no more effectual\nmeans for checking calumny than by affording ample facilities for\nimpeachment, which is as useful in a commonwealth as the other is\npernicious. And between them there is this difference, that calumny\nneeds neither witness, nor circumstantial proof to establish it, so\nthat any man may be calumniated by any other; but not impeached; since\nimpeachment demands that there be substantive charges made, and\ntrustworthy evidence to support them. Again, it is before the\nmagistrates, the people, or the courts of justice that men are\nimpeached; but in the streets and market places that they are\ncalumniated. Calumny, therefore, is most rife in that State wherein\nimpeachment is least practised, and the laws least favour it. For which\nreasons the legislator should so shape the laws of his State that it\nshall be possible therein to impeach any of its citizens without fear\nor favour; and, after duly providing for this, should visit\ncalumniators with the sharpest punishments. Those punished will have no\ncause to complain, since it was in their power to have impeached openly\nwhere they have secretly calumniated. Where this is not seen to, grave\ndisorders will always ensue. For calumnies sting without disabling; and\nthose who are stung being more moved by hatred of their detractors than\nby fear of the things they say against them, seek revenge.\nThis matter, as we have said, was well arranged for in Rome, but has\nalways been badly regulated in our city of Florence. And as the Roman\nordinances with regard to it were productive of much good, so the want\nof them in Florence has bred much mischief. For any one reading the\nhistory of our city may perceive, how many calumnies have at all times\nbeen aimed against those of its citizens who have taken a leading part\nin its affairs. Thus, of one it would be said that he had plundered the\npublic treasury, of another, that he had failed in some enterprise\nbecause he had been bribed; of a third, that this or the other disaster\nhad originated in his ambition. Hence hatred sprung up on every side,\nand hatred growing to division, these led to factions, and these again\nto ruin. But had there existed in Florence some procedure whereby\ncitizens might have been impeached, and calumniators punished,\nnumberless disorders which have taken there would have been prevented.\nFor citizens who were impeached, whether condemned or acquitted, would\nhave had no power to injure the State; and they would have been\nimpeached far seldomer than they have been calumniated; for calumny, as\nI have said already, is an easier matter than impeachment.\nSome, indeed, have made use of calumny as a means for raising\nthemselves to power, and have found their advantage in traducing\neminent citizens who withstood their designs; for by taking the part of\nthe people, and confirming them in their ill-opinion of these great\nmen, they made them their friends. Of this, though I could give many\ninstances, I shall content myself with one. At the siege of Lucca the\nFlorentine army was commanded by Messer Giovanni Guicciardini, as its\ncommissary, through whose bad generalship or ill-fortune the town was\nnot taken. But whatever the cause of this failure, Messer Giovanni had\nthe blame; and the rumour ran that he had been bribed by the people of\nLucca. Which calumny being fostered by his enemies, brought Messer\nGiovanni to very verge of despair; and though to clear himself he would\nwillingly have given himself up to the Captain of Justice he found he\ncould not, there being no provision in the laws of the republic which\nallowed of his doing so. Hence arose the bitterest hostility between\nthe friends of Messer Giovanni, who were mostly of the old nobility\n(_grandi_), and those who sought to reform the government of Florence;\nand from this and the like causes, the affair grew to such dimensions\nas to bring about the downfall of our republic.\nManlius Capitolinus, then, was a calumniator, not an accuser; and in\ntheir treatment of him the Romans showed how calumniators should be\ndealt with; by which I mean, that they should be forced to become\naccusers; and if their accusation be proved true, should be rewarded,\nor at least not punished, but if proved false should be punished as\nManlius was.\nCHAPTER IX.\u2014_That to give new Institutions to a Commonwealth, or to\nreconstruct old Institutions on an entirely new basis, must be the work\nof one Man_.\nIt may perhaps be thought that I should not have got so far into the\nhistory of Rome, without some mention of those who gave that city its\ninstitutions, and saying something of these institutions themselves, so\nfar as they relate to religion and war. As I have no wish to keep those\nwho would know my views on these matters in suspense, I say at once,\nthat to many it might seem of evil omen that the founder of a civil\ngovernment like Romulus, should first have slain his brother, and\nafterwards have consented to the death of Titus Tatius the Sabine, whom\nhe had chosen to be his colleague in the kingship; since his\ncountrymen, if moved by ambition and lust of power to inflict like\ninjuries on any who opposed their designs, might plead the example of\ntheir prince. This view would be a reasonable one were we to disregard\nthe object which led Romulus to put those men to death. But we must\ntake it as a rule to which there are very few if any exceptions, that\nno commonwealth or kingdom ever has salutary institutions given it from\nthe first or has its institutions recast in an entirely new mould,\nunless by a single person. On the contrary, it must be from one man\nthat it receives its institutions at first, and upon one man that all\nsimilar reconstruction must depend. For this reason the wise founder of\na commonwealth who seeks to benefit not himself only, or the line of\nhis descendants, but his State and country, must endeavour to acquire\nan absolute and undivided authority. And none who is wise will ever\nblame any action, however extraordinary and irregular, which serves to\nlay the foundation of a kingdom or to establish a republic. For\nalthough the act condemn the doer, the end may justify him; and when,\nas in the case of Romulus, the end is good, it will always excuse the\nmeans; since it is he who does violence with intent to injure, not he\nwho does it with the design to secure tranquility, who merits blame.\nSuch a person ought however to be so prudent and moderate as to avoid\ntransmitting the absolute authority he acquires, as an inheritance to\nanother; for as men are, by nature, more prone to evil than to good, a\nsuccessor may turn to ambitious ends the power which his predecessor\nhas used to promote worthy ends. Moreover, though it be one man that\nmust give a State its institutions, once given they are not so likely\nto last long resting for support on the shoulders of one man only, as\nwhen entrusted to the care of many, and when it is the business of many\nto maintain them. For though the multitude be unfit to set a State in\norder, since they cannot, by reason of the divisions which prevail\namong them, agree wherein the true well-being of the State lies, yet\nwhen they have once been taught the truth, they never will consent to\nabandon it. And that Romulus, though he put his brother to death, is\nyet of those who are to be pardoned, since what he did was done for the\ncommon good and not from personal ambition, is shown by his at once\ncreating a senate, with whom he took counsel, and in accordance with\nwhose voice he determined. And whosoever shall well examine the\nauthority which Romulus reserved to himself, will find that he reserved\nnothing beyond the command of the army when war was resolved on, and\nthe right to assemble the senate. This is seen later, on Rome becoming\nfree by the expulsion of the Tarquins, when the Romans altered none of\ntheir ancient institutions save in appointing two consuls for a year\ninstead of a king for life; for this proves that all the original\ninstitutions of that city were more in conformity with a free and\nconstitutional government, than with an absolute and despotic one.\nIn support of what has been said above, I might cite innumerable\ninstances, as of Moses, Lycurgus, Solon, and other founders of kingdoms\nand commonwealths, who, from the full powers given them, were enabled\nto shape their laws to the public advantage; but passing over these\nexamples, as of common notoriety, I take one, not indeed so famous, but\nwhich merits the attention of all who desire to frame wise laws. Agis,\nKing of Sparta, desiring to bring back his countrymen to those limits\nwithin which the laws of Lycurgus had held them, because he thought\nthat, from having somewhat deviated from them, his city had lost much\nof its ancient virtue and, consequently much of its strength and power,\nwas, at the very outset of his attempts, slain by the Spartan Ephori,\nas one who sought to make himself a tyrant. But Cleomenes coming after\nhim in the kingdom, and, on reading the notes and writings which he\nfound of Agis wherein his designs and intentions were explained, being\nstirred by the same desire, perceived that he could not confer this\nbenefit on his country unless he obtained sole power. For he saw that\nthe ambition of others made it impossible for him to do what was useful\nfor many against the will of a few. Wherefore, finding fit occasion, he\ncaused the Ephori and all others likely to throw obstacles in his way,\nto be put to death; after which, he completely renewed the laws of\nLycurgus. And the result of his measures would have been to give fresh\nlife to Sparta, and to gain for himself a renown not inferior to that\nof Lycurgus, had it not been for the power of the Macedonians and the\nweakness of the other Greek States. For while engaged with these\nreforms, he was attacked by the Macedonians, and being by himself no\nmatch for them, and having none to whom he could turn for help, he was\noverpowered; and his plans, though wise and praiseworthy, were never\nbrought to perfection.\nAll which circumstances considered, I conclude that he who gives new\ninstitutions to a State must stand alone; and that for the deaths of\nRemus and Tatius, Romulus is to be excused rather than blamed.\nCHAPTER X.\u2014_That in proportion as the Founder of a Kingdom or\nCommonwealth merits Praise, he who founds a Tyranny deserves Blame._\nOf all who are praised they are praised the most, who are the authors\nand founders of religions. After whom come the founders of kingdoms and\ncommonwealths. Next to these, they have the greatest name who as\ncommanders of armies have added to their own dominions or those of\ntheir country. After these, again, are ranked men of letters, who being\nof various shades of merit are celebrated each in his degree. To all\nothers, whose number is infinite, is ascribed that measure of praise to\nwhich his profession or occupation entitles him. And, conversely, all\nwho contribute to the overthrow of religion, or to the ruin of kingdoms\nand commonwealths, all who are foes to letters and to the arts which\nconfer honour and benefit on the human race (among whom I reckon the\nimpious, the cruel, the ignorant, the indolent, the base and the\nworthless), are held in infamy and detestation.\nNo one, whether he be wise or foolish, bad or good, if asked to choose\nbetween these two kinds of men, will ever be found to withhold praise\nfrom what deserves praise, or blame from what is to be blamed. And yet\nalmost all, deceived by a false good and a false glory, allow\nthemselves either ignorantly or wilfully to follow in the footsteps\nsuch as deserve blame rather than praise; and, have it in their power\nto establish, to their lasting renown, a commonwealth or kingdom, turn\naside to create a tyranny without a thought how much they thereby lose\nin name, fame, security, tranquility, and peace of mind; and into how\nmuch infamy, scorn, danger, and disquiet they run. But were they to\nread history, and turn to profit the lessons of the past, it seems\nimpossible that those living in a republic as private citizens, should\nnot prefer, in their native city, to play the part of Scipio rather of\nC\u00e6sar; or that those who by good fortune or merit have risen to be\nrulers, should not seek rather to resemble Agesilaus, Timoleon, and\nDion, than to Nabis, Phalaris and Dionysius; since they would see how\nthe latter are loaded with infamy, while the former have been extolled\nbeyond bounds. They would see, too, how Timoleon and others like him,\nhad as great authority in their country as Dionysius or Phalaris in\ntheirs, while enjoying far greater security. Nor let any one finding\nC\u00e6sar celebrated by a crowd of writers, be misled by his glory; for\nthose who praise him have been corrupted by his good fortune, and\noverawed by the greatness of that empire which, being governed in his\nname, would not suffer any to speak their minds openly concerning him.\nBut let him who desires to know how historians would have written of\nC\u00e6sar had they been free to declare their thoughts mark what they say\nof Catiline, than whom C\u00e6sar is more hateful, in proportion as he who\ndoes is more to be condemned than he who only desires to do evil. Let\nhim see also what praises they lavish upon Brutus, because being\nunable, out of respect for his power, to reproach C\u00e6sar, they magnify\nhis enemy. And if he who has become prince in any State will but\nreflect, how, after Rome was made an empire, far greater praise was\nearned those emperors who lived within the laws, and worthily, than by\nthose who lived in the contrary way, he will see that Titus, Nerva,\nTrajan, Hadrian, Antoninus and Marcus had no need of pr\u00e6torian cohorts,\nor of countless legions to guard them, but were defended by their own\ngood lives, the good-will of their subjects, and the attachment of the\nsenate. In like manner he will perceive in the case of Caligula, Nero,\nVitellius, and ever so many more of those evil emperors, that all the\narmies of the east and of the west were of no avail to protect them\nfrom the enemies whom their bad and depraved lives raised up against\nthem. And were the history of these emperors rightly studied, it would\nbe a sufficient lesson to any prince how to distinguish the paths which\nlead to honour and safety from those which end in shame and insecurity.\nFor of the twenty-six emperors from C\u00e6sar to Maximinus, sixteen came to\na violent, ten only to a natural death; and though one or two of those\nwho died by violence may have been good princes, as Galba or Pertinax,\nthey met their fate in consequence of that corruption which their\npredecessors had left behind in the army. And if among those who died a\nnatural death, there be found some bad emperors, like Severus, it is to\nbe ascribed to their signal good fortune and to their great abilities,\nadvantages seldom found united in the same man. From the study of this\nhistory we may also learn how a good government is to be established;\nfor while all the emperors who succeeded to the throne by birth, except\nTitus, were bad, all were good who succeeded by adoption; as in the\ncase of the five from Nerva to Marcus. But so soon as the empire fell\nonce more to the heirs by birth, its ruin recommenced.\nLet a prince therefore look to that period which extends from Nerva to\nMarcus, and contrast it with that which went before and that which came\nafter, and then let him say in which of them he would wish to have been\nborn or to have reigned. For during these times in which good men\ngoverned, he will see the prince secure in the midst of happy subjects,\nand the whole world filled with peace and justice. He will find the\nsenate maintaining its authority, the magistrates enjoying their\nhonours, rich citizens their wealth, rank and merit held in respect,\nease and content everywhere prevailing, rancour, licence, corruption\nand ambition everywhere quenched, and that golden age restored in which\nevery one might hold and support what opinions he pleased. He will see,\nin short, the world triumphing, the sovereign honoured and revered, the\npeople animated with love, and rejoicing in their security. But should\nhe turn to examine the times of the other emperors, he will find them\nwasted by battles, torn by seditions, cruel alike in war and peace;\nmany princes perishing by the sword; many wars foreign and domestic;\nItaly overwhelmed with unheard-of disasters; her towns destroyed and\nplundered; Rome burned; the Capitol razed to the ground by Roman\ncitizens; the ancient temples desolated; the ceremonies of religion\ncorrupted; the cities rank with adultery; the seas covered with exiles\nand the islands polluted with blood. He will see outrage follow\noutrage; rank, riches, honours, and, above all, virtue imputed as\nmortal crimes; informers rewarded; slaves bribed to betray their\nmasters, freedmen their patrons, and those who were without enemies\nbrought to destruction by their friends; and then he will know the true\nnature of the debt which Rome, Italy, and the world owe to C\u00e6sar; and\nif he possess a spark of human feeling, will turn from the example of\nthose evil times, and kindle with a consuming passion to imitate those\nwhich were good.\nAnd in truth the prince who seeks for worldly glory should desire to be\nthe ruler of a corrupt city; not that, like C\u00e6sar, he may destroy it,\nbut that, like Romulus, he may restore it; since man cannot hope for,\nnor Heaven offer any better opportunity of fame. Were it indeed\nnecessary in giving a constitution to a State to forfeit its\nsovereignty, the prince who, to retain his station, should withhold a\nconstitution, might plead excuse; but for him who in giving a\nconstitution can still retain his sovereignty, no excuse is to be made.\nLet those therefore to whom Heaven has afforded this opportunity,\nremember that two courses lie open to them; one which will render them\nsecure while they live and glorious when they die; another which\nexposes them to continual difficulties in life, and condemns them to\neternal infamy after death.\nCHAPTER XI.\u2014_Of the Religion of the Romans._\nThough Rome had Romulus for her first founder, and as a daughter owed\nhim her being and nurture, nevertheless, when the institutions of\nRomulus were seen by Heaven to be insufficient for so great a State,\nthe Roman senate were moved to choose Numa Pompilius as his successor,\nthat he might look to all matters which Romulus had neglected. He\nfinding the people fierce and turbulent, and desiring with the help of\nthe peaceful arts to bring them to order and obedience, called in the\naid of religion as essential to the maintenance of civil society, and\ngave it such a form, that for many ages God was nowhere so much feared\nas in that republic. The effect of this was to render easy any\nenterprise in which the senate or great men of Rome thought fit to\nengage. And whosoever pays heed to an infinity of actions performed,\nsometimes by the Roman people collectively, often by single citizens,\nwill see, that esteeming the power of God beyond that of man, they\ndreaded far more to violate their oath than to transgress the laws; as\nis clearly shown by the examples of Scipio and of Manlius Torquatus.\nFor after the defeat of the Romans by Hannibal at Cann\u00e6, many citizens\nmeeting together, resolved, in their terror and dismay, to abandon\nItaly and seek refuge in Sicily. But Scipio, getting word of this, went\namong them, and menacing them with his naked sword, made them swear\nnever to abandon their country. Again, when Lucius Manlius was accused\nby the tribune Marcus Pomponius, before the day fixed for trial, Titus\nManlius, afterwards named Torquatus, son to Lucius, went to seek this\nMarcus, and threatening him with death if he did not withdraw the\ncharge against his father, compelled him to swear compliance; and he,\nthrough fear, having sworn, kept his oath. In the first of these two\ninstances, therefore, citizens whom love of their country and its laws\ncould not have retained in Italy, were kept there by the oath forced\nupon them; and in the second, the tribune Marcus, to keep his oath,\nlaid aside the hatred he bore the father, and overlooked the injury\ndone him by the son, and his own dishonour. And this from no other\ncause than the religion which Numa had impressed upon this city.\nAnd it will be plain to any one who carefully studies Roman History,\nhow much religion helped in disciplining the army, in uniting the\npeople, in keeping good men good, and putting bad men to shame; so that\nhad it to be decided to which prince, Romulus or Numa, Rome owed the\ngreater debt, I think the balance must turn in favour of Numa; for when\nreligion is once established you may readily bring in arms; but where\nyou have arms without religion it is not easy afterwards to bring in\nreligion. We see, too, that while Romulus in order to create a senate,\nand to establish his other ordinances civil and military, needed no\nsupport from Divine authority, this was very necessary to Numa, who\nfeigned to have intercourse with a Nymph by whose advice he was guided\nin counselling the people. And this, because desiring to introduce in\nRome new and untried institutions, he feared that his own authority\nmight not effect his end. Nor, indeed, has any attempt ever been made\nto introduce unusual laws among a people, without resorting to Divine\nauthority, since without such sanction they never would have been\naccepted. For the wise recognize many things to be good which do not\nbear such reasons on the face of them as command their acceptance by\nothers; wherefore, wise men who would obviate these difficulties, have\nrecourse to Divine aid. Thus did Lycurgus, thus Solon, and thus have\ndone many besides who have had the same end in view.\nThe Romans, accordingly, admiring the prudence and virtues of Numa,\nassented to all the measures which he recommended. This, however, is to\nbe said, that the circumstance of these times being deeply tinctured\nwith religious feeling, and of the men with whom he had to deal being\nrude and ignorant, gave Numa better facility to carry out his plans, as\nenabling him to mould his subjects readily to any new impression. And,\ndoubtless, he who should seek at the present day to form a new\ncommonwealth, would find the task easier among a race of simple\nmountaineers, than among the dwellers in cities where society is\ncorrupt; as the sculptor can more easily carve a fair statue from a\nrough block, than from the block which has been badly shaped out by\nanother. But taking all this into account, I maintain that the religion\nintroduced by Numa was one of the chief causes of the prosperity of\nRome, since it gave rise to good ordinances, which in turn brought with\nthem good fortune, and with good fortune, happy issues to whatsoever\nwas undertaken.\nAnd as the observance of the ordinances of religion is the cause of the\ngreatness of a State, so their neglect is the occasion of its decline;\nsince a kingdom without the fear of God must either fall to pieces, or\nmust be maintained by the fear of some prince who supplies that\ninfluence not supplied by religion. But since the lives of princes are\nshort, the life of this prince, also, and with it his influence, must\nsoon come to an end; whence it happens that a kingdom which rests\nwholly on the qualities of its prince, lasts for a brief time only;\nbecause these qualities, terminating with his life, are rarely renewed\nin his successor. For as Dante wisely says:\u2014\n\u201cSeldom through the boughs\nDoth human worth renew itself; for such\nThe will of Him who gives it, that to Him\nWe may ascribe it.\u201d[1]\n[1] Rade volta risurge per li rami\nL\u2019umana probitate: e questo vuole\nQuei che la d\u00e0, perch\u00e8 da lui si chiami.\n_Purg_. vii. 121-123.]\nIt follows, therefore, that the safety of a commonwealth or kingdom\nlies, not in its having a ruler who governs it prudently while he\nlives, but in having one who so orders things, that when he dies, the\nState may still maintain itself. And though it be easier to impose new\ninstitutions or a new faith on rude and simple men, it is not therefore\nimpossible to persuade their adoption by men who are civilized, and who\ndo not think themselves rude. The people of Florence do not esteem\nthemselves rude or ignorant, and yet were persuaded by the Friar\nGirolamo Savonarola that he spoke with God. Whether in this he said\ntruth or no, I take not on me to pronounce, since of so great a man we\nmust speak with reverence; but this I do say, that very many believed\nhim without having witnessed anything extraordinary to warrant their\nbelief; his life, his doctrines, the matter whereof he treated, being\nsufficient to enlist their faith.\nLet no man, therefore, lose heart from thinking that he cannot do what\nothers have done before him; for, as I said in my Preface, men are\nborn, and live, and die, always in accordance with the same rules.\nCHAPTER XII.\u2014That it is of much moment to make account of Religion; and\nthat Italy, through the Roman Church, being wanting therein, has been\nruined.\nPrinces and commonwealths that would save themselves from growing\ncorrupted, should before all things keep uncorrupted the rites and\nceremonies of religion, and always hold them in reverence; since we can\nhave no surer sign of the decay of a province than to see Divine\nworship held therein in contempt. This is easily understood when it is\nseen on what foundation that religion rests in which a man is born. For\nevery religion has its root in certain fundamental ordinances peculiar\nto itself.\nThe religion of the Gentiles had its beginning in the responses of the\noracles and in the prognostics of the augurs and soothsayers. All their\nother ceremonies and observances depended upon these; because men\nnaturally believed that the God who could forecast their future weal or\nwoe, could also bring them to pass. Wherefore the temples, the prayers,\nthe sacrifices, and all the other rites of their worship, had their\norigin in this, that the oracles of Delos, of Dodona, and others\ncelebrated in antiquity, held the world admiring and devout. But,\nafterwards, when these oracles began to shape their answers to suit the\ninterests of powerful men, and their impostures to be seen through by\nthe multitude, men grew incredulous and ready to overturn every sacred\ninstitution. For which reason, the rulers of kingdoms and commonwealths\nshould maintain the foundations of the faith which they hold; since\nthus it will be easy for them to keep their country religious, and,\nconsequently, virtuous and united. To which end they should countenance\nand further whatsoever tells in favour of religion, even should they\nthink it untrue; and the wiser they are, and the better they are\nacquainted with natural causes, the more ought they to do so. It is\nfrom this course having been followed by the wise, that the miracles\ncelebrated even in false religions, have come to be held in repute; for\nfrom whatever source they spring, discreet men will extol them, whose\nauthority afterwards gives them currency everywhere.\nThese miracles were common enough in Rome, and among others this was\nbelieved, that when the Roman soldiers were sacking the city of Veii,\ncertain of them entered the temple of Juno and spoke to the statue of\nthe goddess, saying, \u201c_Wilt thou come with us to Rome?_\u201d when to some\nit seemed that she inclined her head in assent, and to others that they\nheard her answer, \u201c_Yea_.\u201d For these men being filled with religious\nawe (which Titus Livius shows us by the circumstance that, in entering\nthe temple, they entered devoutly, reverently, and without tumult),\npersuaded themselves they heard that answer to their question, which,\nperhaps, they had formed beforehand in their minds. But their faith and\nbelief were wholly approved of and confirmed by Camillus and by the\nother chief men of the city.\nHad religion been maintained among the princes of Christendom on the\nfooting on which it was established by its Founder, the Christian\nStates and republics had been far more united and far more prosperous\nthan they now are; nor can we have surer proof of its decay than in\nwitnessing how those countries which are the nearest neighbours of the\nRoman Church, the head of our faith, have less devoutness than any\nothers; so that any one who considers its earliest beginnings and\nobserves how widely different is its present practice, might well\nbelieve its ruin or its chastisement to be close at hand.\nBut since some are of opinion that the welfare of Italy depends upon\nthe Church of Rome, I desire to put forward certain arguments which\noccur to me against that view, and shall adduce two very strong ones,\nwhich, to my mind, admit of no answer. The first is, that, through the\nill example of the Roman Court, the country has lost all religious\nfeeling and devoutness, a loss which draws after it infinite mischiefs\nand disorders; for as the presence of religion implies every\nexcellence, so the contrary is involved in its absence. To the Church,\ntherefore, and to the priests, we Italians owe this first debt, that\nthrough them we have become wicked and irreligious. And a still greater\ndebt we owe them for what is the immediate cause of our ruin, namely,\nthat by the Church our country is kept divided. For no country was ever\nunited or prosperous which did not yield obedience to some one prince\nor commonwealth, as has been the case with France and Spain. And the\nChurch is the sole cause why Italy stands on a different footing, and\nis subject to no one king or commonwealth. For though she holds here\nher seat, and exerts her temporal authority, she has never yet gained\nstrength and courage to seize upon the entire country, or make herself\nsupreme; yet never has been so weak that when in fear of losing her\ntemporal dominion, she could not call in some foreign potentate to aid\nher against any Italian State by which she was overmatched. Of which we\nfind many instances, both in early times, as when by the intervention\nof Charles the Great she drove the Lombards, who had made themselves\nmasters of nearly the whole country, out of Italy; and also in recent\ntimes, as when, with the help of France, she first stripped the\nVenetians of their territories, and then, with the help of the Swiss,\nexpelled the French.\nThe Church, therefore, never being powerful enough herself to take\npossession of the entire country, while, at the same time, preventing\nany one else from doing so, has made it impossible to bring Italy under\none head; and has been the cause of her always living subject to many\nprinces or rulers, by whom she has been brought to such division and\nweakness as to have become a prey, not to Barbarian kings only, but to\nany who have thought fit to attack her. For this, I say, we Italians\nhave none to thank but the Church. And were any man powerful enough to\ntransplant the Court of Rome, with all the authority it now wields over\nthe rest of Italy, into the territories of the Swiss (the only people\nwho at this day, both as regards religion and military discipline, live\nlike the ancients,) he would have clear proof of the truth of what I\naffirm, and would find that the corrupt manners of that Court had, in a\nlittle while, wrought greater mischief in these territories than any\nother disaster which could ever befall them.\nCHAPTER XIII.\u2014_Of the use the Romans made of Religion in giving\nInstitutions to their City, in carrying out their Enterprises, and in\nquelling Tumults._\nHere it seems to me not out of place to cite instances of the Romans\nseeking assistance from religion in reforming their institutions and in\ncarrying out their warlike designs. And although many such are related\nby Titus Livius, I content myself with mentioning the following only:\nThe Romans having appointed tribunes with consular powers, all of them,\nsave one, plebeians, it so chanced that in that very year they were\nvisited by plague and famine, accompanied by many strange portents.\nTaking occasion from this, the nobles, at the next creation of\ntribunes, gave out that the gods were angry with Rome for lowering the\nmajesty of her government, nor could be appeased but by the choice of\ntribunes being restored to a fair footing. Whereupon the people,\nsmitten with religious awe, chose all the tribunes from the nobles.\nAgain, at the siege of Veii, we find the Roman commanders making use of\nreligion to keep the minds of their men well disposed towards that\nenterprise. For when, in the last year of the siege, the soldiers,\ndisgusted with their protracted service, began to clamour to be led\nback to Rome, on the Alban lake suddenly rising to an uncommon height,\nit was found that the oracles at Delphi and elsewhere had foretold that\nVeii should fall that year in which the Alban lake overflowed. The hope\nof near victory thus excited in the minds of the soldiers, led them to\nput up with the weariness of the war, and to continue in arms; until,\non Camillus being named dictator, Veii was taken after a ten years\u2019\nsiege. In these cases, therefore, we see religion, wisely used, assist\nin the reduction of this city, and in restoring the tribuneship to the\nnobles; neither of which ends could well have been effected without it.\nOne other example bearing on the same subject I must not omit. Constant\ndisturbances were occasioned in Rome by the tribune Terentillus, who,\nfor reasons to be noticed in their place, sought to pass a certain law.\nThe nobles, in their efforts to baffle him, had recourse to religion,\nwhich they sought to turn to account in two ways. For first they caused\nthe Sibylline books to be searched, and a feigned answer returned, that\nin that year the city ran great risk of losing its freedom through\ncivil discord; which fraud, although exposed by the tribunes,\nnevertheless aroused such alarm in the minds of the commons that they\nslackened in their support of their leaders. Their other contrivance\nwas as follows: A certain Appius Herdonius, at the head of a band of\nslaves and outlaws, to the number of four thousand, having seized the\nCapitol by night, an alarm was spread that were the Equians and\nVolscians, those perpetual enemies of the Roman name, then to attack\nthe city, they might succeed in taking it. And when, in spite of this,\nthe tribunes stubbornly persisted in their efforts to pass the law,\ndeclaring the act of Herdonius to be a device of the nobles and no real\ndanger. Publius Rubetius, a citizen of weight and authority, came forth\nfrom the Senate House, and in words partly friendly and partly\nmenacing, showed them the peril in which the city stood, and that their\ndemands were unseasonable; and spoke to such effect that the commons\nbound themselves by oath to stand by the consul; in fulfilment of which\nengagement they aided the consul, Publius Valerius, to carry the\nCapitol by assault. But Valerius being slain in the attack, Titus\nQuintius was at once appointed in his place, who, to leave the people\nno breathing time, nor suffer their thoughts to revert to the\nTerentillian law, ordered them to quit Rome and march against the\nVolscians; declaring them bound to follow him by virtue of the oath\nthey had sworn not to desert the consul. And though the tribunes\nwithstood him, contending that the oath had been sworn to the dead\nconsul and not to Quintius, yet the people under the influence of\nreligious awe, chose rather to obey the consul than believe the\ntribunes. And Titus Livius commends their behaviour when he says:\n\u201c_That neglect of the gods which now prevails, had not then made its\nway nor was it then the practice for every man to interpret his oath,\nor the laws, to suit his private ends_.\u201d The tribunes accordingly,\nfearing to lose their entire ascendency, consented to obey the consul,\nand to refrain for a year from moving in the matter of the Terentillian\nlaw; while the consuls, on their part, undertook that for a year the\ncommons should not be called forth to war. And thus, with the help of\nreligion, the senate were able to overcome a difficulty which they\nnever could have overcome without it.\nCHAPTER XIV.\u2014_That the Romans interpreted the Auspices to meet the\noccasion; and made a prudent show of observing the Rites of Religion\neven when forced to disregard them; and any who rashly slighted\nReligion they punished._\nAuguries were not only, as we have shown above, a main foundation of\nthe old religion of the Gentiles, but were also the cause of the\nprosperity of the Roman commonwealth. Accordingly, the Romans gave more\nheed to these than to any other of their observances; resorting to them\nin their consular comitia; in undertaking new enterprises; in calling\nout their armies; in going into battle; and, in short, in every\nbusiness of importance, whether civil or military. Nor would they ever\nset forth on any warlike expedition, until they had satisfied their\nsoldiers that the gods had promised them victory.\nAmong other means of declaring the auguries, they had in their armies a\nclass of soothsayers, named by them _pullarii_, whom, when they desired\nto give battle, they would ask to take the auspices, which they did by\nobserving the behaviour of fowls. If the fowls pecked, the engagement\nwas begun with a favourable omen. If they refused, battle was declined.\nNevertheless, when it was plain on the face of it that a certain course\nhad to be taken, they would take it at all hazards, even though the\nauspices were adverse; contriving, however, to manage matters so\nadroitly as not to appear to throw any slight on religion; as was done\nby the consul Papirius in the great battle he fought with the Samnites\nwherein that nation was finally broken and overthrown. For Papirius\nbeing encamped over against the Samnites, and perceiving that if he\nfought, victory was certain, and consequently being eager to engage,\ndesired the omens to be taken. The fowls refused to peck; but the chief\nsoothsayer observing the eagerness of the soldiers to fight and the\nconfidence felt both by them and by their captain, not to deprive the\narmy of such an opportunity of glory, reported to the consul that the\nauspices were favourable. Whereupon Papirius began to array his army\nfor battle. But some among the soothsayers having divulged to certain\nof the soldiers that the fowls had not pecked, this was told to Spurius\nPapirius, the nephew of the consul, who reporting it to his uncle, the\nlatter straightway bade him mind his own business, for that so far as\nhe himself and the army were concerned, the auspices were fair; and if\nthe soothsayer had lied, the consequences were on his head. And that\nthe event might accord with the prognostics, he commanded his officers\nto place the soothsayers in front of the battle. It so chanced that as\nthey advanced against the enemy, the chief soothsayer was killed by a\nspear thrown by a Roman soldier; which, the consul hearing of, said,\n\u201c_All goes well, and as the Gods would have it, for by the death of\nthis liar the army is purged of blame and absolved from whatever\ndispleasure these may have conceived against it_.\u201d And contriving, in\nthis way to make his designs tally with the auspices, he joined battle,\nwithout the army knowing that the ordinances of religion had in any\ndegree been disregarded.\nBut an opposite course was taken by Appius Pulcher, in Sicily, in the\nfirst Carthaginian war. For desiring to join battle, he bade the\nsoothsayers take the auspices, and on their announcing that the fowls\nrefused to feed, he answered, \u201c_Let us see, then, whether they will\ndrink,_\u201d and, so saying, caused them to be thrown into the sea. After\nwhich he fought and was defeated. For this he was condemned at Rome,\nwhile Papirius was honoured; not so much because the one had gained\nwhile the other had lost a battle, as because in their treatment of the\nauspices the one had behaved discreetly, the other with rashness. And,\nin truth, the sole object of this system of taking the auspices was to\ninsure the army joining battle with that confidence of success which\nconstantly leads to victory; a device followed not by the Romans only,\nbut by foreign nations as well; of which I shall give an example in the\nfollowing Chapter.\nCHAPTER XV.\u2014_How the Samnites, as a last resource in their broken\nFortunes, had recourse to Religion._\nThe Samnites, who before had met with many defeats at the hands of the\nRomans, were at last decisively routed by them in Etruria, where their\narmies were cut to pieces and their commanders slain. And because their\nallies also, such as the Etruscans, the Umbrians, and the Gauls, were\nlikewise vanquished, they \u201c_could now no longer_\u201d as Livius tells us,\n\u201c_either trust to their own strength or to foreign aid; yet, for all\nthat, would not cease from hostilities, nor resign themselves to\nforfeit the liberty which they had unsuccessfully defended, preferring\nnew defeats to an inglorious submission._\u201d They resolved, therefore, to\nmake a final effort; and as they knew that victory was only to be\nsecured by inspiring their soldiers with a stubborn courage, to which\nend nothing could help so much as religion, at the instance of their\nhigh priest, Ovius Paccius, they revived an ancient sacrificial rite\nperformed by them in the manner following. After offering solemn\nsacrifice they caused all the captains of their armies, standing\nbetween the slain victims and the smoking altars, to swear never to\nabandon the war. They then summoned the common soldiers, one by one,\nand before the same altars, and surrounded by a ring of many centurions\nwith drawn swords, first bound them by oath never to reveal what they\nmight see or hear; and then, after imprecating the Divine wrath, and\nreciting the most terrible incantations, made them vow and swear to the\ngods, as they would not have a curse light on their race and offspring,\nto follow wherever their captains led, never to turn back from battle,\nand to put any they saw turn back to death. Some who in their terror\ndeclined to swear, were forthwith slain by the centurions. The rest,\nwarned by their cruel fate, complied. Assembling thereafter to the\nnumber of forty thousand, one-half of whom, to render their appearance\nof unusual splendour were clad in white, with plumes and crests over\ntheir helmets, they took up their ground in the neighbourhood of\nAquilonia. But Papirius, being sent against them, bade his soldiers be\nof good cheer, telling them \u201c_that feathers made no wounds, and that a\nRoman spear would pierce a painted shield;_\u201d and to lessen the effect\nwhich the oath taken by the Samnites had upon the minds of the Romans,\nhe said that such an oath must rather distract than strengthen those\nbound by it, since they had to fear, at once, their enemies, their\ncomrades, and their Gods. In the battle which ensued, the Samnites were\nrouted, any firmness lent them by religion or by the oath they had\nsworn, being balanced by the Roman valour, and the terror inspired by\npast defeats. Still we see that, in their own judgment, they had no\nother refuge to which to turn, nor other remedy for restoring their\nbroken hopes; and this is strong testimony to the spirit which religion\nrightly used can arouse.\nSome of the incidents which I have now been considering may be thought\nto relate rather to the foreign than to the domestic affairs of Rome,\nwhich last alone form the proper subject of this Book; nevertheless\nsince the matter connects itself with one of the most important\ninstitutions of the Roman republic, I have thought it convenient to\nnotice it here, so as not to divide the subject and be obliged to\nreturn to it hereafter.\nCHAPTER XVI.\u2014_That a People accustomed to live under a Prince, if by\nany accident it become free, can hardly preserve that Freedom._\nShould a people accustomed to live under a prince by any accident\nbecome free, as did the Romans on the expulsion of the Tarquins, we\nknow from numberless instances recorded in ancient history, how hard it\nwill be for it to maintain that freedom. And this is no more than we\nmight expect. For a people in such circumstances may be likened to the\nwild animal which, though destined by nature to roam at large in the\nwoods, has been reared in the cage and in constant confinement and\nwhich, should it chance to be set free in the open country, being\nunused to find its own food, and unfamiliar with the coverts where it\nmight lie concealed, falls a prey to the first who seeks to recapture\nit. Even thus it fares with the people which has been accustomed to be\ngoverned by others; since ignorant how to act by itself either for\nattack or defence, and neither knowing foreign princes nor being known\nof them, it is speedily brought back under the yoke, and often under a\nheavier yoke than that from which it has just freed its neck. These\ndifficulties will be met with, even where the great body of the\ncitizens has not become wholly corrupted; but where the corruption is\ncomplete, freedom, as shall presently be shown, is not merely fleeting\nbut impossible. Wherefore my remarks are to be taken as applying to\nthose States only wherein corruption has as yet made no great progress,\nand in which there is more that is sound than unsound.\nTo the difficulties above noticed, another has to be added, which is,\nthat a State in becoming free makes for itself bitter enemies but not\nwarm friends. All become its bitter enemies who, drawing their support\nfrom the wealth of the tyrant, flourished under his government. For\nthese men, when the causes which made them powerful are withdrawn, can\nno longer live contented, but are one and all impelled to attempt the\nrestoration of the tyranny in hopes of regaining their former\nimportance. On the other hand, as I have said, the State which becomes\nfree does not gain for itself warm friends. For a free government\nbestows its honours and rewards in accordance with certain fixed rules,\nand on considerations of merit, without which none is honoured or\nrewarded. But when a man obtains only those honours or rewards which he\nseems to himself to deserve, he will never admit that he is under any\nobligation to those who bestow them. Moreover the common benefits that\nall derive from a free government, which consist in the power to enjoy\nwhat is our own, openly and undisturbed, in having to feel no anxiety\nfor the honour of wife or child, nor any fear for personal safety, are\nhardly recognized by men while they still possess them, since none will\never confess obligation to him who merely refrains from injury. For\nthese reasons, I repeat, a State which has recently become free, is\nlikely to have bitter enemies and no warm friends.\nNow, to meet these difficulties and their attendant disorders, there is\nno more potent, effectual, wholesome, and necessary remedy than _to\nslay the sons of Brutus_. They, as the historian tells us, were along\nwith other young Romans led to conspire against their country, simply\nbecause the unusual privileges which they had enjoyed under the kings,\nwere withheld under the consuls; so that to them it seemed as though\nthe freedom of the people implied their servitude. Any one, therefore,\nwho undertakes to control a people, either as their prince or as the\nhead of a commonwealth, and does not make sure work with all who are\nhostile to his new institutions, founds a government which cannot last\nlong. Undoubtedly those princes are to be reckoned unhappy, who, to\nsecure their position, are forced to advance by unusual and irregular\npaths, and with the people for their enemies. For while he who has to\ndeal with a few adversaries only, can easily and without much or\nserious difficulty secure himself, he who has an entire people against\nhim can never feel safe and the greater the severity he uses the weaker\nhis authority becomes; so that his best course is to strive to make the\npeople his friends.\nBut since these views may seem to conflict with what I have said above,\ntreating there of a republic and here of a prince, that I may not have\nto return to the subject again, I will in this place discuss it\nbriefly. Speaking, then of those princes who have become the tyrants of\ntheir country, I say that the prince who seeks to gain over an\nunfriendly people should first of all examine what it is the people\nreally desire, and he will always find that they desire two things:\nfirst, to be revenged upon those who are the cause of their servitude;\nand second, to regain their freedom. The first of these desires the\nprince can gratify wholly, the second in part. As regards the former,\nwe have an instance exactly in point. Clearchus, tyrant of Heraclea,\nbeing in exile, it so happened that on a feud arising between the\ncommons and the nobles of that city, the latter, perceiving they were\nweaker than their adversaries, began to look with favour on Clearchus,\nand conspiring with him, in opposition to the popular voice recalled\nhim to Heraclea and deprived the people of their freedom. Clearchus\nfinding himself thus placed between the arrogance of the nobles, whom\nhe could in no way either satisfy or correct, and the fury of the\npeople, who could not put up with the loss of their freedom, resolved\nto rid himself at a stroke from the harassment of the nobles and\nrecommend himself to the people. Wherefore, watching his opportunity,\nhe caused all the nobles to be put to death, and thus, to the extreme\ndelight of the people, satisfied one of those desires by which they are\npossessed, namely, the desire for vengeance.\nAs for the other desire of the people, namely, to recover their\nfreedom, the prince, since he never can content them in this, should\nexamine what the causes are which make them long to be free; and he\nwill find a very few of them desiring freedom that they may obtain\npower, but all the rest, whose number is countless, only desiring it\nthat they may live securely. For in all republics, whatever the form of\ntheir government, barely forty or fifty citizens have any place in the\ndirection of affairs; who, from their number being so small, can easily\nbe reckoned with, either by making away with them, or by allowing them\nsuch a share of honours as, looking to their position, may reasonably\ncontent them. All those others whose sole aim it is to live safely, are\nwell contented where the prince enacts such laws and ordinances as\nprovide for the general security, while they establish his own\nauthority; and when he does this, and the people see that nothing\ninduces him to violate these laws, they soon begin to live happily and\nwithout anxiety. Of this we have an example in the kingdom of France,\nwhich enjoys perfect security from this cause alone, that its kings are\nbound to compliance with an infinity of laws upon which the well-being\nof the whole people depends. And he who gave this State its\nconstitution allowed its kings to do as they pleased as regards arms\nand money; but provided that as regards everything else they should not\ninterfere save as the laws might direct. Those rulers, therefore, who\nomit to provide sufficiently for the safety of their government at the\noutset, must, like the Romans, do so on the first occasion which\noffers; and whoever lets the occasion slip, will repent too late of not\nhaving acted as he should. The Romans, however, being still uncorrupted\nat the time when they recovered their freedom, were able, after slaying\nthe sons of Brutus and getting rid of the Tarquins, to maintain it with\nall those safeguards and remedies which we have elsewhere considered.\nBut had they already become corrupted, no remedy could have been found,\neither in Rome or out of it, by which their freedom could have been\nsecured; as I shall show in the following Chapter.\nCHAPTER XVII.\u2014_That a corrupt People obtaining Freedom can hardly\npreserve it._\nI believe that if her kings had not been expelled, Rome must very soon\nhave become a weak and inconsiderable State. For seeing to what a pitch\nof corruption these kings had come, we may conjecture that if two or\nthree more like reigns had followed, and the taint spread from the head\nto the members, so soon as the latter became infected, cure would have\nbeen hopeless. But from the head being removed while the trunk was\nstill sound, it was not difficult for the Romans to return to a free\nand constitutional government.\nIt may be assumed, however, as most certain, that a corrupted city\nliving under a prince can never recover its freedom, even were the\nprince and all his line to be exterminated. For in such a city it must\nnecessarily happen that one prince will be replaced by another, and\nthat things will never settle down until a new lord be established;\nunless, indeed, the combined goodness and valour of some one citizen\nshould maintain freedom, which, even then, will endure only for his\nlifetime; as happened twice in Syracuse, first under the rule of Dion,\nand again under that of Timoleon, whose virtues while they lived kept\ntheir city free, but on whose death it fell once more under a tyranny.\nBut the strongest example that can be given is that of Rome, which on\nthe expulsion of the Tarquins was able at once to seize on liberty and\nto maintain it; yet, on the deaths of C\u00e6sar, Caligula, and Nero, and on\nthe extinction of the Julian line, was not only unable to establish her\nfreedom, but did not even venture a step in that direction. Results so\nopposite arising in one and the same city can only be accounted for by\nthis, that in the time of the Tarquins the Roman people were not yet\ncorrupted, but in these later times had become utterly corrupt. For on\nthe first occasion, nothing more was needed to prepare and determine\nthem to shake off their kings, than that they should be bound by oath\nto suffer no king ever again to reign in Rome; whereas, afterwards, the\nauthority and austere virtue of Brutus, backed by all the legions of\nthe East, could not rouse them to maintain their hold of that freedom,\nwhich he, following in the footsteps of the first Brutus, had won for\nthem; and this because of the corruption wherewith the people had been\ninfected by the Marian faction, whereof C\u00e6sar becoming head, was able\nso to blind the multitude that it saw not the yoke under which it was\nabout to lay its neck.\nThough this example of Rome be more complete than any other, I desire\nto instance likewise, to the same effect, certain peoples well known in\nour own days; and I maintain that no change, however grave or violent,\ncould ever restore freedom to Naples or Milan, because in these States\nthe entire body of the people has grown corrupted. And so we find that\nMilan, although desirous to return to a free form of government, on the\ndeath of Filippo Visconti, had neither the force nor the skill needed\nto preserve it.\nMost fortunate, therefore, was it for Rome that her kings grew corrupt\nsoon, so as to be driven out before the taint of their corruption had\nreached the vitals of the city. For it was because these were sound\nthat the endless commotions which took place in Rome, so far from being\nhurtful, were, from their object being good, beneficial to the\ncommonwealth. From which we may draw this inference, that where the\nbody of the people is still sound, tumults and other like disorders do\nlittle hurt, but that where it has become corrupted, laws, however well\ndevised, are of no advantage, unless imposed by some one whose\nparamount authority causes them to be observed until the community be\nonce more restored to a sound and healthy condition.\nWhether this has ever happened I know not, nor whether it ever can\nhappen. For we see, as I have said a little way back, that a city which\nowing to its pervading corruption has once begun to decline, if it is\nto recover at all, must be saved not by the excellence of the people\ncollectively, but of some one man then living among them, on whose\ndeath it at once relapses into its former plight; as happened with\nThebes, in which the virtue of Epaminondas made it possible while he\nlived to preserve the form of a free Government, but which fell again\non his death into its old disorders; the reason being that hardly any\nruler lives so long as to have time to accustom to right methods a city\nwhich has long been accustomed to wrong. Wherefore, unless things be\nput on a sound footing by some one ruler who lives to a very advanced\nage, or by two virtuous rulers succeeding one another, the city upon\ntheir death at once falls back into ruin; or, if it be preserved, must\nbe so by incurring great risks, and at the cost of much blood. For the\ncorruption I speak of, is wholly incompatible with a free government,\nbecause it results from an inequality which pervades the State and can\nonly be removed by employing unusual and very violent remedies, such as\nfew are willing or know how to employ, as in another place I shall more\nfully explain.\nCHAPTER XVIII.\u2014_How a Free Government existing in a corrupt City may be\npreserved, or not existing may be created._\nI think it neither out of place, nor inconsistent with what has been\nsaid above, to consider whether a free government existing in a corrupt\ncity can be maintained, or, not existing, can be introduced. And on\nthis head I say that it is very difficult to bring about either of\nthese results, and next to impossible to lay down rules as to how it\nmay be done; because the measures to be taken must vary with the degree\nof corruption which prevails.\nNevertheless, since it is well to reason things out, I will not pass\nthis matter by, but will assume, in the first place, the case of a very\ncorrupt city, and then take the case of one in which corruption has\nreached a still greater height; but where corruption is universal, no\nlaws or institutions will ever have force to restrain it. Because as\ngood customs stand in need of good laws for their support, so laws,\nthat they may be respected, stand in need of good customs. Moreover,\nthe laws and institutions established in a republic at its beginning,\nwhen men were good, are no longer suitable when they have become bad;\nbut while the laws of a city are altered to suit its circumstances, its\ninstitutions rarely or never change; whence it results that the\nintroduction of new laws is of no avail, because the institutions,\nremaining unchanged, corrupt them.\nAnd to make this plainer, I say that in Rome it was first of all the\ninstitutions of the State, and next the laws as enforced by the\nmagistrates, which kept the citizens under control. The institutions of\nthe State consisted in the authority of the people, the senate, the\ntribunes, and the consuls; in the methods of choosing and appointing\nmagistrates; and in the arrangements for passing laws. These\ninstitutions changed little, if at all, with circumstances. But the\nlaws by which the people were controlled, as for instance the law\nrelating to adultery, the sumptuary laws, the law as to canvassing at\nelections, and many others, were altered as the citizens grew more and\nmore corrupted. Hence, the institutions of the State remaining the same\nalthough from the corruption of the people no longer suitable,\namendments in the laws could not keep men good, though they might have\nproved very useful if at the time when they were made the institutions\nhad likewise been reformed.\nThat its original institutions are no longer adapted to a city that has\nbecome corrupted, is plainly seen in two matters of great moment, I\nmean in the appointment of magistrates and in the passing of laws. For\nthe Roman people conferred the consulship and other great offices of\ntheir State on none save those who sought them; which was a good\ninstitution at first, because then none sought these offices save those\nwho thought themselves worthy of them, and to be rejected was held\ndisgraceful; so that, to be deemed worthy, all were on their best\nbehaviour. But in a corrupted city this institution grew to be most\nmischievous. For it was no longer those of greatest worth, but those\nwho had most influence, who sought the magistracies; while all who were\nwithout influence, however deserving, refrained through fear. This\nuntoward result was not reached all at once, but like other similar\nresults, by gradual steps. For after subduing Africa and Asia, and\nreducing nearly the whole of Greece to submission, the Romans became\nperfectly assured of their freedom, and seemed to themselves no longer\nto have any enemy whom they had cause to fear. But this security and\nthe weakness of their adversaries led them in conferring the\nconsulship, no longer to look to merit, but only to favour, selecting\nfor the office those who knew best how to pay court to them, not those\nwho knew best how to vanquish their enemies. And afterwards, instead of\nselecting those who were best liked, they came to select those who had\nmost influence; and in this way, from the imperfection of their\ninstitutions, good men came to be wholly excluded.\nAgain, as to making laws, any of the tribunes and certain others of the\nmagistrates were entitled to submit laws to the people; but before\nthese were passed it was open to every citizen to speak either for or\nagainst them. This was a good system so long as the citizens were good,\nsince it is always well that every man should be able to propose what\nhe thinks may be of use to his country, and that all should be allowed\nto express their views with regard to his proposal; so that the people,\nhaving heard all, may resolve on what is best. But when the people grew\ndepraved, this became a very mischievous institution; for then it was\nonly the powerful who proposed laws, and these not in the interest of\npublic freedom but of their own authority; and because, through fear,\nnone durst speak against the laws they proposed, the people were either\ndeceived or forced into voting their own destruction.\nIn order, therefore, that Rome after she had become corrupted might\nstill preserve her freedom, it was necessary that, as in the course of\nevents she had made new laws, so likewise she should frame new\ninstitutions, since different institutions and ordinances are needed in\na corrupt State from those which suit a State which is not corrupted;\nfor where the matter is wholly dissimilar, the form cannot be similar.\nBut since old institutions must either be reformed all at once, as soon\nas they are seen to be no longer expedient, or else gradually, as the\nimperfection of each is recognized, I say that each of these two\ncourses is all but impossible. For to effect a gradual reform requires\na sagacious man who can discern mischief while it is still remote and\nin the germ. But it may well happen that no such person is found in a\ncity; or that, if found, he is unable to persuade others of what he is\nhimself persuaded. For men used to live in one way are loath to leave\nit for another, especially when they are not brought face to face with\nthe evil against which they should guard, and only have it indicated to\nthem by conjecture. And as for a sudden reform of institutions which\nare seen by all to be no longer good, I say that defects which are\neasily discerned are not easily corrected, because for their correction\nit is not enough to use ordinary means, these being in themselves\ninsufficient; but recourse must be had to extraordinary means, such as\nviolence and arms; and, as a preliminary, you must become prince of the\ncity, and be able to deal with it at your pleasure. But since the\nrestoration of a State to new political life presupposes a good man,\nand to become prince of a city by violence presupposes a bad man, it\ncan, consequently, very seldom happen that, although the end be good, a\ngood man will be found ready to become a prince by evil ways, or that a\nbad man having become a prince will be disposed to act virtuously, or\nthink of turning to good account his ill-acquired authority.\nFrom all these causes comes the difficulty, or rather the\nimpossibility, which a corrupted city finds in maintaining an existing\nfree government, or in establishing a new one. So that had we to\nestablish or maintain a government in that city, it would be necessary\nto give it a monarchical, rather than a popular form, in order that men\ntoo arrogant to be restrained by the laws, might in some measure be\nkept in check by a power almost absolute; since to attempt to make them\ngood otherwise would be a very cruel or a wholly futile endeavour.\nThis, as I have said, was the method followed by Cleomenes; and if he,\nthat he might stand alone, put to death the Ephori; and if Romulus,\nwith a like object, put to death his brother and Titus Tatius the\nSabine, and if both afterwards made good use of the authority they thus\nacquired, it is nevertheless to be remembered that it was because\nneither Cleomenes nor Romulus had to deal with so corrupt a people as\nthat of which I am now speaking, that they were able to effect their\nends and to give a fair colour to their acts.\nCHAPTER XIX.\u2014_After a strong Prince a weak Prince may maintain himself:\nbut after one weak Prince no Kingdom can stand a second._\nWhen we contemplate the excellent qualities of Romulus, Numa, and\nTullus, the first three kings of Rome, and note the methods which they\nfollowed, we recognize the extreme good fortune of that city in having\nher first king fierce and warlike, her second peaceful and religious,\nand her third, like the first, of a high spirit and more disposed to\nwar than to peace. For it was essential for Rome that almost at the\noutset of her career, a ruler should be found to lay the foundations of\nher civil life; but, after that had been done, it was necessary that\nher rulers should return to the virtues of Romulus, since otherwise the\ncity must have grown feeble, and become a prey to her neighbours.\nAnd here we may note that a prince who succeeds to another of superior\nvalour, may reign on by virtue of his predecessor\u2019s merits, and reap\nthe fruits of his labours; but if he live to a great age, or if he be\nfollowed by another who is wanting in the qualities of the first, that\nthen the kingdom must necessarily dwindle. Conversely, when two\nconsecutive princes are of rare excellence, we commonly find them\nachieving results which win for them enduring renown. David, for\nexample, not only surpassed in learning and judgment, but was so\nvaliant in arms that, after conquering and subduing all his neighbours,\nhe left to his young son Solomon a tranquil State, which the latter,\nthough unskilled in the arts of war, could maintain by the arts of\npeace, and thus happily enjoy the inheritance of his father\u2019s valour.\nBut Solomon could not transmit this inheritance to his son Rehoboam,\nwho neither resembling his grandfather in valour, nor his father in\ngood fortune, with difficulty made good his right to a sixth part of\nthe kingdom. In like manner Bajazet, sultan of the Turks, though a man\nof peace rather than of war, was able to enjoy the labours of Mahomet\nhis father, who, like David, having subdued his neighbours, left his\nson a kingdom so safely established that it could easily be retained by\nhim by peaceful arts. But had Selim, son to Bajazet, been like his\nfather, and not like his grandfather, the Turkish monarchy must have\nbeen overthrown; as it is, he seems likely to outdo the fame of his\ngrandsire.\nI affirm it to be proved by these examples, that after a valiant prince\na feeble prince may maintain himself; but that no kingdom can stand\nwhen two feeble princes follow in succession, unless, as in the case of\nFrance, it be supported by its ancient ordinances. By feeble princes, I\nmean such as are not valiant in war. And, to put the matter shortly, it\nmay be said, that the great valour of Romulus left Numa a period of\nmany years within which to govern Rome by peaceful arts; that after\nNuma came Tullus, who renewed by his courage the fame of Romulus; and\nthat he in turn was succeeded by Ancus, a prince so gifted by nature\nthat he could equally avail himself of the methods of peace or war; who\nsetting himself at first to pursue the former, when he found that his\nneighbours judged him to be effeminate, and therefore held him in\nslight esteem, understood that to preserve Rome he must resort to arms\nand resemble Romulus rather than Numa. From whose example every ruler\nof a State may learn that a prince like Numa will hold or lose his\npower according as fortune and circumstances befriend him; but that the\nprince who resembles Romulus, and like him is fortified with foresight\nand arms, will hold his State whatever befall, unless deprived of it by\nsome stubborn and irresistible force. For we may reckon with certainty\nthat if Rome had not had for her third king one who knew how to restore\nher credit by deeds of valour, she could not, or at any rate not\nwithout great difficulty, have afterwards held her ground, nor could\never have achieved the great exploits she did.\nAnd for these reasons Rome, while she lived under her kings, was in\nconstant danger of destruction through a king who might be weak or bad.\nCHAPTER XX.\u2014_That the consecutive Reigns of two valiant Princes produce\ngreat results: and that well-ordered Commonwealths are assured of a\nSuccession of valiant Rulers by whom their Power and Growth are rapidly\nextended_.\nWhen Rome had driven out her kings, she was freed from those dangers to\nwhich, as I have said, she was exposed by the possible succession of a\nweak or wicked prince. For the chief share in the government then\ndevolved upon the consuls, who took their authority not by inheritance,\nnor yet by craft or by ambitious violence, but by the free suffrages of\ntheir fellow-citizens, and were always men of signal worth; by whose\nvalour and good fortune Rome being constantly aided, was able to reach\nthe height of her greatness in the same number of years as she had\nlived under her kings. And since we find that two successive reigns of\nvaliant princes, as of Philip of Macedon and his son Alexander, suffice\nto conquer the world, this ought to be still easier for a commonwealth,\nwhich has it in its power to choose, not two excellent rulers only, but\nan endless number in succession. And in every well ordered commonwealth\nprovision will be made for a succession of this sort.\nCHAPTER XXI.\u2014_That it is a great reproach to a Prince or to a\nCommonwealth to be without a national Army_.\nThose princes and republics of the present day who lack forces of their\nown, whether for attack or defence, should take shame to themselves,\nand should be convinced by the example of Tullus, that their deficiency\ndoes not arise from want of men fit for warlike enterprises, but from\ntheir own fault in not knowing how to make their subjects good\nsoldiers. For after Rome had been at peace for forty years, Tullus,\nsucceeding to the kingdom, found not a single Roman who had ever been\nin battle. Nevertheless when he made up his mind to enter on a war, it\nnever occurred to him to have recourse to the Samnites, or the\nEtruscans, or to any other of the neighbouring nations accustomed to\narms, but he resolved, like the prudent prince he was, to rely on his\nown countrymen. And such was his ability that, under his rule, the\npeople very soon became admirable soldiers. For nothing is more true\nthan that where a country, having men, lacks soldiers, it results from\nsome fault in its ruler, and not from any defect in the situation or\nclimate. Of this we have a very recent instance. Every one knows, how,\nonly the other day, the King of England invaded the realm of France\nwith an army raised wholly from among his own people, although from his\ncountry having been at peace for thirty years, he had neither men nor\nofficers who had ever looked an enemy in the face. Nevertheless, he did\nnot hesitate with such troops as he had, to attack a kingdom well\nprovided with officers and excellent soldiers who had been constantly\nunder arms in the Italian wars. And this was possible through the\nprudence of the English king and the wise ordinances of his kingdom,\nwhich never in time of peace relaxes its warlike discipline. So too, in\nold times, Pelopidas and Epaminondas the Thebans, after they had freed\nThebes from her tyrants, and rescued her from thraldom to Sparta,\nfinding themselves in a city used to servitude and surrounded by an\neffeminate people, scrupled not, so great was their courage, to furnish\nthese with arms, and go forth with them to meet and to conquer the\nSpartan forces on the field. And he who relates this, observes, that\nthese two captains very soon showed that warriors are not bred in\nLaced\u00e6mon alone, but in every country where men are found, if only some\none arise among them who knows how to direct them to arms; as we see\nTullus knew how to direct the Romans. Nor could Virgil better express\nthis opinion, or show by fitter words that he was convinced of its\ntruth than, when he says:\u2014\n\u201cTo arms shall Tullus rouse\nHis sluggish warriors.\u201d[2]\n[2] Residesque movebit\nTullus in arma viros. _Virg. Aen_. vi. 814.\nCHAPTER XXII.\u2014_What is to be noted in the combat of the three Roman\nHoratii and the three Alban Curiatii_.\nIt was agreed between Tullus king of Rome, and Metius king of Alba,\nthat the nation whose champions were victorious in combat should rule\nover the other. The three Alban Curiatii were slain; one of the Roman\nHoratii survived. Whereupon the Alban king with all his people became\nsubject to the Romans. The surviving Horatius returning victorious to\nRome, and meeting his sister, wife to one of the dead Curiatii,\nbewailing the death of her husband, slew her; and being tried for this\ncrime, was, after much contention, liberated, rather on the entreaties\nof his father than for his own deserts.\nHerein three points are to be noted. _First_, that we should never\nperil our whole fortunes on the success of only a part of our forces.\n_Second_, that in a well-governed State, merit should never be allowed\nto balance crime. And _third_, that those are never wise covenants\nwhich we cannot or should not expect to be observed. Now, for a State\nto be enslaved is so terrible a calamity that it ought never to have\nbeen supposed possible that either of these kings or nations would rest\ncontent under a slavery resulting from the defeat of three only of\ntheir number. And so it appeared to Metius; for although on the victory\nof the Roman champions, he at once confessed himself vanquished, and\npromised obedience; nevertheless, in the very first expedition which he\nand Tullus undertook jointly against the people of Veii, we find him\nseeking to circumvent the Roman, as though perceiving too late the rash\npart he had played.\nThis is enough to say of the third point which I noted as deserving\nattention. Of the other two I shall speak in the next two Chapters.\nCHAPTER XXIII.\u2014_That we should never hazard our whole Fortunes where we\nput not forth our entire Strength; for which reason to guard a Defile\nis often hurtful_.\nIt was never judged a prudent course to peril your whole fortunes where\nyou put not forth your whole strength; as may happen in more ways than\none. One of these ways was that taken by Tullus and Metius, when each\nstaked the existence of his country and the credit of his army on the\nvalour and good fortune of three only of his soldiers, that being an\nutterly insignificant fraction of the force at his disposal. For\nneither of these kings reflected that all the labours of their\npredecessors in framing such institutions for their States, as might,\nwith the aid of the citizens themselves, maintain them long in freedom,\nwere rendered futile, when the power to ruin all was left in the hands\nof so small a number. No rasher step, therefore, could have been taken,\nthan was taken by these kings.\nA like risk is almost always incurred by those who, on the approach of\nan enemy, resolve to defend some place of strength, or to guard the\ndefiles by which their country is entered. For unless room be found in\nthis place of strength for almost all your army, the attempt to hold it\nwill almost always prove hurtful. If you can find room, it will be\nright to defend your strong places; but if these be difficult of\naccess, and you cannot there keep your entire force together, the\neffort to defend is mischievous. I come to this conclusion from\nobserving the example of those who, although their territories be\nenclosed by mountains and precipices, have not, on being attacked by\npowerful enemies, attempted to fight on the mountains or in the\ndefiles, but have advanced beyond them to meet their foes; or, if\nunwilling to advance, have awaited attack behind their mountains, on\nlevel and not on broken ground. The reason of which is, as I have above\nexplained, that many men cannot be assembled in these strong places for\ntheir defence; partly because a large number of men cannot long subsist\nthere, and partly because such places being narrow and confined, afford\nroom for a few only; so that no enemy can there be withstood, who comes\nin force to the attack; which he can easily do, his design being to\npass on and not to make a stay; whereas he who stands on the defensive\ncannot do so in force, because, from not knowing when the enemy may\nenter the confined and sterile tracts of which I speak, he may have to\nlodge himself there for a long time. But should you lose some pass\nwhich you had reckoned on holding, and on the defence of which your\ncountry and army have relied, there commonly follows such panic among\nyour people and among the troops which remain to you, that you are\nvanquished without opportunity given for any display of valour, and\nlose everything without bringing all your resources into play.\nEvery one has heard with what difficulty Hannibal crossed the Alps\nwhich divide France from Lombardy, and afterwards those which separate\nLombardy from Tuscany. Nevertheless the Romans awaited him, in the\nfirst instance on the banks of the Ticino, in the second on the plain\nof Arezzo, preferring to be defeated on ground which at least gave them\na chance of victory, to leading their army into mountain fastnesses\nwhere it was likely to be destroyed by the mere difficulties of the\nground. And any who read history with attention will find, that very\nfew capable commanders have attempted to hold passes of this nature, as\nwell for the reasons already given, as because to close them all were\nimpossible. For mountains, like plains, are traversed not only by\nwell-known and frequented roads, but also by many by-ways, which,\nthough unknown to strangers, are familiar to the people of the country,\nunder whose guidance you may always, and in spite of any opposition, be\neasily conducted to whatever point you please. Of this we have a recent\ninstance in the events of the year 1515. For when Francis I. of France\nresolved on invading Italy in order to recover the province of\nLombardy, those hostile to his attempt looked mainly to the Swiss, who\nit was hoped would stop him in passing through their mountains. But\nthis hope was disappointed by the event. For leaving on one side two or\nthree defiles which were guarded by the Swiss, the king advanced by\nanother unknown pass, and was in Italy and upon his enemies before they\nknew. Whereupon they fled terror-stricken into Milan; while the whole\npopulation of Lombardy, finding themselves deceived in their\nexpectation that the French would be detained in the mountains, went\nover to their side.\nCHAPTER XXIV.\u2014_That well-ordered States always provide Rewards and\nPunishments for their Citizens; and never set off Deserts against\nMisdeeds_.\nThe valour of Horatius in vanquishing the Curiatii deserved the highest\nreward. But in slaying his sister he had been guilty of a heinous\ncrime. And so displeasing to the Romans was an outrage of this nature,\nthat although his services were so great and so recent, they brought\nhim to trial for his life. To one looking at it carelessly, this might\nseem an instance of popular ingratitude, but he who considers the\nmatter more closely, and examines with sounder judgment what the\nordinances of a State should be, will rather blame the Roman people for\nacquitting Horatius than for putting him on his trial. And this because\nno well-ordered State ever strikes a balance between the services of\nits citizens and their misdeeds; but appointing rewards for good\nactions and punishment for bad, when it has rewarded a man for acting\nwell, will afterwards, should he act ill, chastise him, without regard\nto his former deserts. When these ordinances are duly observed, a city\nwill live long in freedom, but when they are neglected, it must soon\ncome to ruin. For when a citizen has rendered some splendid service to\nhis country, if to the distinction which his action in itself confers,\nwere added an over-weening confidence that any crime he might\nthenceforth commit would pass unpunished, he would soon become so\narrogant that no civil bonds could restrain him.\nStill, while we would have punishment terrible to wrongdoers, it is\nessential that good actions should be rewarded, as we see to have been\nthe case in Rome. For even where a republic is poor, and has but little\nto give, it ought not to withhold that little; since a gift, however\nsmall, bestowed as a reward for services however great, will always be\nesteemed most honourable and precious by him who receives it. The story\nof Horatius Cocles and that of Mutius Sc\u00e6vola are well known: how the\none withstood the enemy on the bridge while it was being cut down, and\nthe other thrust his hand into the fire in punishment of the mistake\nmade when he sought the life of Porsenna the Etruscan king. To each of\nthese two, in requital of their splendid deeds, two ploughgates only of\nthe public land were given. Another famous story is that of Manlius\nCapitolinus, to whom, for having saved the Capitol from the besieging\nGauls, a small measure of meal was given by each of those who were shut\nup with him during the siege. Which recompense, in proportion to the\nwealth of the citizens of Rome at that time, was thought ample; so that\nafterwards, when Manlius, moved by jealousy and malice, sought to\narouse sedition in Rome, and to gain over the people to his cause, they\nwithout regard to his past services threw him headlong from that\nCapitol in saving which he had formerly gained so great a renown.\nCHAPTER XXV.\u2014_That he who would reform the Institutions of a free\nState, must retain at least the semblance of old Ways._\nWhoever takes upon him to reform the government of a city, must, if his\nmeasures are to be well received and carried out with general approval,\npreserve at least the semblance of existing methods, so as not to\nappear to the people to have made any change in the old order of\nthings; although, in truth, the new ordinances differ altogether from\nthose which they replace. For when this is attended to, the mass of\nmankind accept what seems as what is; nay, are often touched more\nnearly by appearances than by realities.\nThis tendency being recognized by the Romans at the very outset of\ntheir civil freedom, when they appointed two consuls in place of a\nsingle king, they would not permit the consuls to have more than twelve\nlictors, in order that the old number of the king\u2019s attendants might\nnot be exceeded. Again, there being solemnized every year in Rome a\nsacrificial rite which could only be performed by the king in person,\nthat the people might not be led by the absence of the king to remark\nthe want of any ancient observance, a priest was appointed for the due\ncelebration of this rite, to whom was given the name of _Rex\nsacrificulus_, and who was placed under the orders of the chief priest.\nIn this way the people were contented, and had no occasion from any\ndefect in the solemnities to desire the return of their kings. Like\nprecautions should be used by all who would put an end to the old\ngovernment of a city and substitute new and free institutions. For\nsince novelty disturbs men\u2019s minds, we should seek in the changes we\nmake to preserve as far as possible what is ancient, so that if the new\nmagistrates differ from the old in number, in authority, or in the\nduration of their office, they shall at least retain the old names.\nThis, I say, should be seen to by him who would establish a\nconstitutional government, whether in the form of a commonwealth or of\na kingdom. But he who would create an absolute government of the kind\nwhich political writers term a tyranny, must renew everything, as shall\nbe explained in the following Chapter.\nCHAPTER XXVI.\u2014_A new Prince in a City or Province of which he has taken\nPossession, ought to make Everything new._\nWhosoever becomes prince of a city or State, more especially if his\nposition be so insecure that he cannot resort to constitutional\ngovernment either in the form of a republic or a monarchy, will find\nthat the best way to preserve his princedom is to renew the whole\ninstitutions of that State; that is to say, to create new magistracies\nwith new names, confer new powers, and employ new men, and like David\nwhen he became king, exalt the humble and depress the great, \u201c_filling\nthe hungry with good things, and sending the rich empty away_.\u201d\nMoreover, he must pull down existing towns and rebuild them, removing\ntheir inhabitants from one place to another; and, in short, leave\nnothing in the country as he found it; so that there shall be neither\nrank, nor condition, nor honour, nor wealth which its possessor can\nrefer to any but to him. And he must take example from Philip of\nMacedon, the father of Alexander, who by means such as these, from\nbeing a petty prince became monarch of all Greece; and of whom it was\nwritten that he shifted men from province to province as a shepherd\nmoves his flocks from one pasture to another.\nThese indeed are most cruel expedients, contrary not merely to every\nChristian, but to every civilized rule of conduct, and such as every\nman should shun, choosing rather to lead a private life than to be a\nking on terms so hurtful to mankind. But he who will not keep to the\nfair path of virtue, must to maintain himself enter this path of evil.\nMen, however, not knowing how to be wholly good or wholly bad, choose\nfor themselves certain middle ways, which of all others are the most\npernicious, as shall be shown by an instance in the following Chapter.\nCHAPTER XXVII.\u2014_That Men seldom know how to be wholly good or wholly\nbad_.\nWhen in the year 1505, Pope Julius II. went to Bologna to expel from\nthat city the family of the Bentivogli, who had been princes there for\nover a hundred years, it was also in his mind, as a part of the general\ndesign he had planned against all those lords who had usurped Church\nlands, to remove Giovanpagolo Baglioni, tyrant of Perugia. And coming\nto Perugia with this intention and resolve, of which all men knew, he\nwould not wait to enter the town with a force sufficient for his\nprotection, but entered it unattended by troops, although Giovanpagolo\nwas there with a great company of soldiers whom he had assembled for\nhis defence. And thus, urged on by that impetuosity which stamped all\nhis actions, accompanied only by his body-guard, he committed himself\ninto the hands of his enemy, whom he forthwith carried away with him,\nleaving a governor behind to hold the town for the Church. All prudent\nmen who were with the Pope remarked on his temerity, and on the\npusillanimity of Giovanpagolo; nor could they conjecture why the latter\nhad not, to his eternal glory, availed himself of this opportunity for\ncrushing his enemy, and at the same time enriching himself with\nplunder, the Pope being attended by the whole College of Cardinals with\nall their luxurious equipage. For it could not be supposed that he was\nwithheld by any promptings of goodness or scruples of conscience;\nbecause in the breast of a profligate living in incest with his sister,\nand who to obtain the princedom had put his nephews and kinsmen to\ndeath, no virtuous impulse could prevail. So that the only inference to\nbe drawn was, that men know not how to be splendidly wicked or wholly\ngood, and shrink in consequence from such crimes as are stamped with an\ninherent greatness or disclose a nobility of nature. For which reason\nGiovanpagolo, who thought nothing of incurring the guilt of incest, or\nof murdering his kinsmen, could not, or more truly durst not, avail\nhimself of a fair occasion to do a deed which all would have admired;\nwhich would have won for him a deathless fame as the first to teach the\nprelates how little those who live and reign as they do are to be\nesteemed; and which would have displayed a greatness far transcending\nany infamy or danger that could attach to it.\nCHAPTER XXVIII.\u2014_Whence it came that the Romans were less ungrateful to\ntheir Citizens than were the Athenians_.\nIn the histories of all republics we meet with instances of some sort\nof ingratitude to their great citizens, but fewer in the history of\nRome than of Athens, or indeed of any other republic. Searching for the\ncause of this, I am persuaded that, so far as regards Rome and Athens,\nit was due to the Romans having had less occasion than the Athenians to\nlook upon their fellow-citizens with suspicion. For, from the expulsion\nof her kings down to the times of Sylla and Marius, the liberty of Rome\nwas never subverted by any one of her citizens; so that there never was\nin that city grave cause for distrusting any man, and in consequence\nmaking him the victim of inconsiderate injustice. The reverse was\nnotoriously the case with Athens; for that city, having, at a time when\nshe was most flourishing, been deprived of her freedom by Pisistratus\nunder a false show of good-will, remembering, after she regained her\nliberty, her former bondage and all the wrongs she had endured, became\nthe relentless chastiser, not of offences only on the part of her\ncitizens, but even of the shadow of an offence. Hence the banishment\nand death of so many excellent men, and hence the law of ostracism, and\nall those other violent measures which from time to time during the\nhistory of that city were directed against her foremost citizens. For\nthis is most true which is asserted by the writers on civil government,\nthat a people which has recovered its freedom, bites more fiercely than\none which has always preserved it.\nAnd any who shall weigh well what has been said, will not condemn\nAthens in this matter, nor commend Rome, but refer all to the necessity\narising out of the different conditions prevailing in the two States.\nFor careful reflection will show that had Rome been deprived of her\nfreedom as Athens was, she would not have been a whit more tender to\nher citizens. This we may reasonably infer from remarking what, after\nthe expulsion of the kings, befell Collatinus and Publius Valerius; the\nformer of whom, though he had taken part in the liberation of Rome, was\nsent into exile for no other reason than that he bore the name of\nTarquin; while the sole ground of suspicion against the latter, and\nwhat almost led to his banishment, was his having built a house upon\nthe C\u00e6lian hill. Seeing how harsh and suspicious Rome was in these two\ninstances, we may surmise that she would have shown the same\ningratitude as Athens, had she, like Athens, been wronged by her\ncitizens at an early stage of her growth, and before she had attained\nto the fulness of her strength.\nThat I may not have to return to this question of ingratitude, I shall\nsay all that remains to be said about it in my next Chapter.\nCHAPTER XXIX.\u2014_Whether a People or a Prince is the more ungrateful._\nIn connection with what has been said above, it seems proper to\nconsider whether more notable instances of ingratitude are supplied by\nprinces or peoples. And, to go to the root of the matter, I affirm that\nthis vice of ingratitude has its source either in avarice or in\nsuspicion. For a prince or people when they have sent forth a captain\non some important enterprise, by succeeding in which he earns a great\nname, are bound in return to reward him; and if moved by avarice and\ncovetousness they fail to do so, or if, instead of rewarding, they\nwrong and disgrace him, they commit an error which is not only without\nexcuse, but brings with it undying infamy. And, in fact, we find many\nprinces who have sinned in this way, for the cause given by Cornelius\nTacitus when he says, that \u201c_men are readier to pay back injuries than\nbenefits, since to requite a benefit is felt to be a burthen, to return\nan injury a gain_.\u201d[3]\n[3] Proclivius est injuri\u00e6 quam beneficio vicem exsolvere, quia gratia\noneri, ultio in quastu habetur. _Tacit. Hist._ iv. 2.\nWhen, however, reward is withheld, or, to speak more correctly, where\noffence is given, not from avarice but from suspicion, the prince or\npeople may deserve some excuse; and we read of many instances of\ningratitude proceeding from this cause. For the captain who by his\nvalour has won new dominions for his prince, since while overcoming his\nenemies, he at the same time covers himself with glory and enriches his\nsoldiers, must needs acquire such credit with his own followers, and\nwith the enemy, and also with the subjects of his prince, as cannot be\nwholly agreeable to the master who sent him forth. And since men are by\nnature ambitious as well as jealous, and none loves to set a limit to\nhis fortunes, the suspicion which at once lays hold of the prince when\nhe sees his captain victorious, is sure to be inflamed by some arrogant\nact or word of the captain himself. So that the prince will be unable\nto think of anything but how to secure himself; and to this end will\ncontrive how he may put his captain to death, or at any rate deprive\nhim of the credit he has gained with the army and among the people;\ndoing all he can to show that the victory was not won by his valour,\nbut by good fortune, or by the cowardice of the enemy, or by the skill\nand prudence of those commanders who were with him at this or the other\nbattle.\nAfter Vespasian, who was then in Jud\u00e6a, had been proclaimed emperor by\nhis army, Antonius Primus, who commanded another army in Illyria,\nadopted his cause, and marching into Italy against Vitellius who had\nbeen proclaimed emperor in Rome, courageously defeated two armies under\nthat prince, and occupied Rome; so that Mutianus, who was sent thither\nby Vespasian, found everything done to his hand, and all difficulties\nsurmounted by the valour of Antonius. But all the reward which Antonius\nhad for his pains, was, that Mutianus forthwith deprived him of his\ncommand of the army, and by degrees diminished his authority in Rome\ntill none was left him. Thereupon Antonius went to join Vespasian, who\nwas still in Asia; by whom he was so coldly received and so little\nconsidered, that in despair he put himself to death. And of cases like\nthis, history is full. Every man living at the present hour knows with\nwhat zeal and courage Gonsalvo of Cordova, while conducting the war in\nNaples against the French, conquered and subdued that kingdom for his\nmaster Ferdinand of Aragon; and how his services were requited by\nFerdinand coming from Aragon to Naples, and first of all depriving him\nof the command of the army, afterwards of the fortresses, and finally\ncarrying him back with him to Spain, where soon after he died in\ndisgrace.\nThis jealousy, then, is so natural to princes, that they cannot guard\nthemselves against it, nor show gratitude to those who serving under\ntheir standard have gained great victories and made great conquests on\ntheir behalf. And if it be impossible for princes to free their minds\nfrom such suspicions, there is nothing strange or surprising that a\npeople should be unable to do so. For as a city living under free\ninstitutions has two ends always before it, namely to acquire liberty\nand to preserve it, it must of necessity be led by its excessive\npassion for liberty to make mistakes in the pursuit of both these\nobjects. Of the mistakes it commits in the effort to acquire liberty, I\nshall speak, hereafter, in the proper place. Of mistakes committed in\nthe endeavour to preserve liberty are to be noted, the injuring those\ncitizens who ought to be rewarded, and the suspecting those who should\nbe trusted. Now, although in a State which has grown corrupt these\nerrors occasion great evils, and commonly lead to a tyranny, as\nhappened in Rome when C\u00e6sar took by force what ingratitude had denied\nhim, they are nevertheless the cause of much good in the republic which\nhas not been corrupted, since they prolong the duration of its free\ninstitutions, and make men, through fear of punishment, better and less\nambitious. Of all peoples possessed of great power, the Romans, for the\nreasons I have given, have undoubtedly been the least ungrateful, since\nwe have no other instance of their ingratitude to cite, save that of\nScipio. For both Coriolanus and Camillus were banished on account of\nthe wrongs which they inflicted on the commons; and though the former\nwas not forgiven because he constantly retained ill will against the\npeople, the latter was not only recalled, but for the rest of his life\nhonoured as a prince. But the ingratitude shown towards Scipio arose\nfrom the suspicion wherewith the citizens came to regard him, which\nthey had not felt in the case of the others, and which was occasioned\nby the greatness of the enemy whom he had overthrown, the fame he had\nwon by prevailing in so dangerous and protracted a war, the suddenness\nof his victories, and, finally, the favour which his youth, together\nwith his prudence and his other memorable qualities had gained for him.\nThese qualities were, in truth, so remarkable that the very\nmagistrates, not to speak of others, stood in awe of his authority, a\ncircumstance displeasing to prudent citizens, as before unheard of in\nRome. In short, his whole bearing and character were so much out of the\ncommon, that even the elder Cato, so celebrated for his austere virtue,\nwas the first to declare against him, saying that no city could be\ndeemed free which contained a citizen who was feared by the\nmagistrates. And since, in this instance, the Romans followed the\nopinion of Cato, they merit that excuse which, as I have said already,\nshould be extended to the prince or people who are ungrateful through\nsuspicion.\nIn conclusion it is to be said that while this vice of ingratitude has\nits origin either in avarice or in suspicion, commonwealths are rarely\nled into it by avarice, and far seldomer than princes by suspicion,\nhaving, as shall presently be shown, far less reason than princes for\nsuspecting.\nCHAPTER XXX.\u2014_How Princes and Commonwealths may avoid the vice of\nIngratitude; and how a Captain or Citizen may escape being undone by\nit._\nThat he may not be tormented by suspicion, nor show ungrateful, a\nprince should go himself on his wars as the Roman emperors did at\nfirst, as the Turk does now, and, in short, as all valiant princes have\ndone and do. For when it is the prince himself who conquers, the glory\nand the gain are all his own; but when he is absent, since the glory is\nanother\u2019s, it will seem to the prince that he profits nothing by the\ngain, unless that glory be quenched which he knew not how to win for\nhimself; and when he thus becomes ungrateful and unjust, doubtless his\nloss is greater than his gain. To the prince, therefore, who, either\nthrough indolence or from want of foresight, sends forth a captain to\nconduct his wars while he himself remains inactive at home, I have no\nadvice to offer which he does not already know. But I would counsel the\ncaptain whom he sends, since I am sure that he can never escape the\nattacks of ingratitude, to follow one or other of two courses, and\neither quit his command at once after a victory, and place himself in\nthe hands of his prince, while carefully abstaining from every\nvainglorious or ambitious act, so that the prince, being relieved from\nall suspicion, may be disposed to reward, or at any rate not to injure\nhim; or else, should he think it inexpedient for him to act in this\nway, to take boldly the contrary course, and fearlessly to follow out\nall such measures as he thinks will secure for himself, and not for his\nprince, whatever he has gained; conciliating the good-will of his\nsoldiers and fellow-citizens, forming new friendships with neighbouring\npotentates, placing his own adherents in fortified towns, corrupting\nthe chief officers of his army and getting rid of those whom he fails\nto corrupt, and by all similar means endeavouring to punish his master\nfor the ingratitude which he looks for at his hands. These are the only\ntwo courses open; but since, as I said before, men know not how to be\nwholly good or wholly bad, it will never happen that after a victory a\ncaptain will quit his army and conduct himself modestly, nor yet that\nhe will venture to use those hardy methods which have in them some\nstrain of greatness; and so, remaining undecided, he will be crushed\nwhile he still wavers and doubts.\nA commonwealth desiring to avoid the vice of ingratitude is, as\ncompared with a prince, at this disadvantage, that while a prince can\ngo himself on his expeditions, the commonwealth must send some one of\nits citizens. As a remedy, I would recommend that course being adopted\nwhich was followed by the Roman republic in order to be less ungrateful\nthan others, having its origin in the nature of the Roman government.\nFor the whole city, nobles and commons alike, taking part in her wars,\nthere were always found in Rome at every stage of her history, so many\nvaliant and successful soldiers, that by reason of their number, and\nfrom one acting as a check upon another, the nation had never ground to\nbe jealous of any one man among them; while they, on their part, lived\nuprightly, and were careful to betray no sign of ambition, nor give the\npeople the least cause to distrust them as ambitious; so that he\nobtained most glory from his dictatorship who was first to lay it down.\nWhich conduct, as it excited no suspicion, could occasion no\ningratitude.\nWe see, then, that the commonwealth which would have no cause to be\nungrateful, must act as Rome did; and that the citizen who would escape\ningratitude, must observe those precautions which were observed by\nRoman citizens.\nCHAPTER XXXI.\u2014_That the Roman Captains were never punished with extreme\nseverity for Misconduct; and where loss resulted to the Republic merely\nthrough their Ignorance or Want of Judgment, were not punished at all_.\nThe Romans were not only, as has been said above, less ungrateful than\nother republics, but were also more lenient and more considerate than\nothers in punishing the captains of their armies. For if these erred of\nset purpose, they chastised them with gentleness; while if they erred\nthrough ignorance, so far from punishing, they even honoured and\nrewarded them. And this conduct was well considered. For as they judged\nit of the utmost moment, that those in command of their armies should,\nin all they had to do, have their minds undisturbed and free from\nexternal anxieties, they would not add further difficulty and danger to\na task in itself both dangerous and difficult, lest none should ever be\nfound to act with valour. For supposing them to be sending forth an\narmy against Philip of Macedon in Greece or against Hannibal in Italy,\nor against any other enemy at whose hands they had already sustained\nreverses, the captain in command of that expedition would be weighted\nwith all the grave and important cares which attend such enterprises.\nBut if to all these cares, had been added the example of Roman generals\ncrucified or otherwise put to death for having lost battles, it would\nhave been impossible for a commander surrounded by so many causes for\nanxiety to have acted with vigour and decision. For which reason, and\nbecause they thought that to such persons the mere ignominy of defeat\nwas in itself punishment enough, they would not dishearten their\ngenerals by inflicting on them any heavier penalty.\nOf errors committed not through ignorance, the following is an\ninstance. Sergius and Virginius were engaged in the siege of Veii, each\nbeing in command of a division of the army, and while Sergius was set\nto guard against the approach of the Etruscans, it fell to Virginius to\nwatch the town. But Sergius being attacked by the Faliscans and other\ntribes, chose rather to be defeated and routed than ask aid from\nVirginius, who, on his part, awaiting the humiliation of his rival, was\nwilling to see his country dishonoured and an army destroyed, sooner\nthan go unasked to his relief. This was notable misconduct, and likely,\nunless both offenders were punished, to bring discredit on the Roman\nname. But whereas another republic would have punished these men with\ndeath, the Romans were content to inflict only a money fine: not\nbecause the offence did not in itself deserve severe handling, but\nbecause they were unwilling, for the reasons already given, to depart\nin this instance from their ancient practice.\nOf errors committed through ignorance we have no better example than in\nthe case of Varro, through whose rashness the Romans were defeated by\nHannibal at Cann\u00e6, where the republic well-nigh lost its liberty. But\nbecause he had acted through ignorance and with no evil design, they\nnot only refrained from punishing him, but even treated him with\ndistinction; the whole senate going forth to meet him on his return to\nRome, and as they could not thank him for having fought, thanking him\nfor having come back, and for not having despaired of the fortunes his\ncountry.\nAgain, when Papirius Cursor would have had Fabius put to death,\nbecause, contrary to his orders, he had fought with the Samnites, among\nthe reasons pleaded by the father of Fabius against the persistency of\nthe dictator, he urged that never on the occasion of the defeat of any\nof their captains had the Romans done what Papirius desired them to do\non the occasion of a victory.\nCHAPTER XXXII.\u2014_That a Prince or Commonwealth should not delay\nconferring Benefits until they are themselves in difficulties._\nThe Romans found it for their advantage to be generous to the commons\nat a season of danger, when Porsenna came to attack Rome and restore\nthe Tarquins. For the senate, apprehending that the people might choose\nrather to take back their kings than to support a war, secured their\nadherence by relieving them of the duty on salt and of all their other\nburthens; saying that \u201c_the poor did enough for the common welfare in\nrearing their offspring._\u201d In return for which indulgence the commons\nwere content to undergo war, siege, and famine. Let no one however,\nrelying on this example, delay conciliating the people till danger has\nactually come; or, if he do, let him not hope to have the same good\nfortune as the Romans. For the mass of the people will consider that\nthey have to thank not him, but his enemies, and that there is ground\nto fear that when the danger has passed away, he will take back what he\ngave under compulsion, and, therefore, that to him they lie under no\nobligation. And the reason why the course followed by the Romans\nsucceeded, was that the State was still new and unsettled. Besides\nwhich, the people knew that laws had already been passed in their\nfavour, as, for instance, the law allowing an appeal to the tribunes,\nand could therefore persuade themselves that the benefits granted them\nproceeded from the good-will entertained towards them by the senate,\nand were not due merely to the approach of an enemy. Moreover, the\nmemory of their kings, by whom they had in many ways been wronged and\nill-treated, was still fresh in their minds. But since like conditions\nseldom recur, it can only rarely happen that like remedies are useful.\nWherefore, all, whether princes or republics, who hold the reins of\ngovernment, ought to think beforehand of the adverse times which may\nawait them, and of what help they may then stand in need; and ought so\nto live with their people as they would think right were they suffering\nunder any calamity. And, whosoever, whether prince or republic, but\nprince more especially, behaves otherwise, and believes that after the\nevent and when danger is upon him he will be able to win men over by\nbenefits, deceives himself, and will not merely fail to maintain his\nplace, but will even precipitate his downfall.\nCHAPTER XXXIII.\u2014_When a Mischief has grown up in, or against a State,\nit is safer to temporize with than to meet it with Violence_.\nAs Rome grew in fame, power, and dominion, her neighbours, who at first\nhad taken no heed to the injury which this new republic might do them,\nbegan too late to see their mistake, and desiring to remedy what should\nhave been remedied before, combined against her to the number of forty\nnations. Whereupon the Romans, resorting to a method usual with them in\nseasons of peril, appointed a dictator; that is, gave power to one man\nto decide without advice, and carry out his resolves without appeal.\nWhich expedient, as it then enabled them to overcome the dangers by\nwhich they were threatened, so always afterwards proved most\nserviceable, when, at any time during the growth of their power,\ndifficulties arose to embarrass their republic.\nIn connection with this league against Rome we have first to note, that\nwhen a mischief which springs up either in or against a republic, and\nwhether occasioned by internal or external causes, has grown to such\nproportions that it begins to fill the whole community with alarm, it\nis a far safer course to temporize with it than to attempt to quell it\nby violence. For commonly those who make this attempt only add fuel to\nthe flame, and hasten the impending ruin. Such disorders arise in a\nrepublic more often from internal causes than external, either through\nsome citizen being suffered to acquire undue influence, or from the\ncorruption of some institution of that republic, which had once been\nthe life and sinew of its freedom; and from this corruption being\nallowed to gain such head that the attempt to check it is more\ndangerous than to let it be. And it is all the harder to recognize\nthese disorders in their beginning, because it seems natural to men to\nlook with favour on the beginnings of things. Favour of this sort, more\nthan by anything else, is attracted by those actions which seem to have\nin them a quality of greatness, or which are performed by the young.\nFor when in a republic some young man is seen to come forward endowed\nwith rare excellence, the eyes of all the citizens are at once turned\nupon him, and all, without distinction, concur to do him honour; so\nthat if he have one spark of ambition, the advantages which he has from\nnature, together with those he takes from this favourable disposition\nof men\u2019s minds, raise him to such a pitch of power, that when the\ncitizens at last see their mistake it is almost impossible for them to\ncorrect it; and when they do what they can to oppose his influence the\nonly result is to extend it. Of this I might cite numerous examples,\nbut shall content myself with one relating to our own city.\nCosimo de\u2019 Medici, to whom the house of the Medici in Florence owes the\norigin of its fortunes, acquired so great a name from the favour\nwherewith his own prudence and the blindness of others invested him,\nthat coming to be held in awe by the government, his fellow-citizens\ndeemed it dangerous to offend him, but still more dangerous to let him\nalone. Nicol\u00f2 da Uzzano, his cotemporary, who was accounted well versed\nin all civil affairs, but who had made a first mistake in not\ndiscerning the dangers which might grow from the rising influence of\nCosimo, would never while he lived, permit a second mistake to be made\nin attempting to crush him; judging that such an attempt would be the\nruin of the State, as in truth it proved after his death. For some who\nsurvived him, disregarding his counsels, combined against Cosimo and\nbanished him from Florence. And so it came about that the partisans of\nCosimo, angry at the wrong done him, soon afterwards recalled him and\nmade him prince of the republic, a dignity he never would have reached\nbut for this open opposition. The very same thing happened in Rome in\nthe case of C\u00e6sar. For his services having gained him the good-will of\nPompey and other citizens, their favour was presently turned to fear,\nas Cicero testifies where he says that \u201cit was late that Pompey began\nto fear C\u00e6sar.\u201d This fear led men to think of remedies, and the\nremedies to which they resorted accelerated the destruction of the\nrepublic.\nI say, then, that since it is difficult to recognize these disorders in\ntheir beginning, because of the false impressions which things produce\nat the first, it is a wiser course when they become known, to temporize\nwith them than to oppose them; for when you temporize, either they die\nout of themselves, or at any rate the injury they do is deferred. And\nthe prince who would suppress such disorders or oppose himself to their\nforce and onset, must always be on his guard, lest he help where he\nwould hinder, retard when he would advance, and drown the plant he\nthinks to water. He must therefore study well the symptoms of the\ndisease; and, if he believe himself equal to the cure, grapple with it\nfearlessly; if not, he must let it be, and not attempt to treat it in\nany way. For, otherwise, it will fare with him as it fared with those\nneighbours of Rome, for whom it would have been safer, after that city\nhad grown to be so great, to have sought to soothe and restrain her by\npeaceful arts, than to provoke her by open war to contrive new means of\nattack and new methods of defence. For this league had no other effect\nthan to make the Romans more united and resolute than before, and to\nbethink themselves of new expedients whereby their power was still more\nrapidly advanced; among which was the creation of a dictator; for this\ninnovation not only enabled them to surmount the dangers which then\nthreatened them, but was afterwards the means of escaping infinite\ncalamities into which, without it, the republic must have fallen.\nCHAPTER XXXIV.\u2014_That the authority of the Dictator did good and not\nharm to the Roman Republic: and that it is not those Powers which are\ngiven by the free suffrages of the People, but those which ambitious\nCitizens usurp for themselves, that are pernicious to a State._\nThose citizens who first devised a dictatorship for Rome have been\nblamed by certain writers, as though this had been the cause of the\ntyranny afterwards established there. For these authors allege that the\nfirst tyrant of Rome governed it with the title of Dictator, and that,\nbut for the existence of the office, C\u00e6sar could never have cloaked his\nusurpation under a constitutional name. He who first took up this\nopinion had not well considered the matter, and his conclusion has been\naccepted without good ground. For it was not the name nor office of\nDictator which brought Rome to servitude, but the influence which\ncertain of her citizens were able to assume from the prolongation of\ntheir term of power; so that even had the name of Dictator been wanting\nin Rome, some other had been found to serve their ends, since power may\nreadily give titles, but not titles power. We find, accordingly, that\nwhile the dictatorship was conferred in conformity with public\nordinances, and not through personal influence, it was constantly\nbeneficial to the city. For it is the magistracies created and the\npowers usurped in unconstitutional ways that hurt a republic, not those\nwhich conform to ordinary rule; so that in Rome, through the whole\nperiod of her history, we never find a dictator who acted otherwise\nthan well for the republic. For which there were the plainest reasons.\nIn the first place, to enable a citizen to work harm and to acquire\nundue authority, many circumstances must be present which never can be\npresent in a State which is not corrupted. For such a citizen must be\nexceedingly rich, and must have many retainers and partisans, whom he\ncannot have where the laws are strictly observed, and who, if he had\nthem, would occasion so much alarm, that the free suffrage of the\npeople would seldom be in his favour. In the second place, the dictator\nwas not created for life, but for a fixed term, and only to meet the\nemergency for which he was appointed. Power was indeed given him to\ndetermine by himself what measures the exigency demanded; to do what he\nhad to do without consultation; and to punish without appeal. But he\nhad no authority to do anything to the prejudice of the State, as it\nwould have been to deprive the senate or the people of their\nprivileges, to subvert the ancient institutions of the city, or\nintroduce new. So that taking into account the brief time for which his\noffice lasted, its limited authority, and the circumstance that the\nRoman people were still uncorrupted, it was impossible for him to\noverstep the just limits of his power so as to injure the city; and in\nfact we find that he was always useful to it.\nAnd, in truth, among the institutions of Rome, this of the dictatorship\ndeserves our special admiration, and to be linked with the chief causes\nof her greatness; for without some such safeguard a city can hardly\npass unharmed through extraordinary dangers. Because as the ordinary\ninstitutions of a commonwealth work but slowly, no council and no\nmagistrate having authority to act in everything alone, but in most\nmatters one standing in need of the other, and time being required to\nreconcile their differences, the remedies which they provide are most\ndangerous when they have to be applied in cases which do not brook\ndelay. For which reason, every republic ought to have some resource of\nthis nature provided by its constitution; as we find that the Republic\nof Venice, one of the best of those now existing, has in cases of\nurgent danger reserved authority to a few of her citizens, if agreed\namong themselves, to determine without further consultation what course\nis to be followed. When a republic is not provided with some safeguard\nsuch as this, either it must be ruined by observing constitutional\nforms, or else, to save it, these must be broken through. But in a\nrepublic nothing should be left to be effected by irregular methods,\nbecause, although for the time the irregularity may be useful, the\nexample will nevertheless be pernicious, as giving rise to a practice\nof violating the laws for good ends, under colour of which they may\nafterwards be violated for ends which are not good. For which reason,\nthat can never become a perfect republic wherein every contingency has\nnot been foreseen and provided for by the laws, and the method of\ndealing with it defined. To sum up, therefore, I say that those\nrepublics which cannot in sudden emergencies resort either to a\ndictator or to some similar authority, will, when the danger is\nserious, always be undone.\nWe may note, moreover, how prudently the Romans, in introducing this\nnew office, contrived the conditions under which it was to be\nexercised. For perceiving that the appointment of a dictator involved\nsomething of humiliation for the consuls, who, from being the heads of\nthe State, were reduced to render obedience like every one else, and\nanticipating that this might give offence, they determined that the\npower to appoint should rest with the consuls, thinking that when the\noccasion came when Rome should have need of this regal authority, they\nwould have the consuls acting willingly and feeling the less aggrieved\nfrom the appointment being in their own hands. For those wounds or\nother injuries which a man inflicts upon himself by choice, and of his\nown free will, pain him far less than those inflicted by another.\nNevertheless, in the later days of the republic the Romans were wont to\nentrust this power to a consul instead of to a dictator, using the\nformula, _Videat_ CONSUL _ne quid respublica detrimenti capiat_.\nBut to return to the matter in hand, I say briefly, that when the\nneighbours of Rome sought to crush her, they led her to take measures\nnot merely for her readier defence, but such as enabled her to attack\nthem with a stronger force, with better skill, and with an undivided\ncommand.\nCHAPTER XXXV\u2014_Why the Creation of the Decemvirate in Rome, although\nbrought about by the free and open Suffrage of the Citizens, was\nhurtful to the Liberties of that Republic_\nThe fact of those ten citizens who were chosen by the Roman people to\nmake laws for Rome, in time becoming her tyrants and depriving her of\nher freedom, may seem contrary to what I have said above, namely that\nit is the authority which is violently usurped, and not that conferred\nby the free suffrages of the people which is injurious to a republic.\nHere, however, we have to take into account both the mode in which, and\nthe term for which authority is given. Where authority is unrestricted\nand is conferred for a long term, meaning by that for a year or more,\nit is always attended with danger, and its results will be good or bad\naccording as the men are good or bad to whom it is committed. Now when\nwe compare the authority of the Ten with that possessed by the\ndictator, we see that the power placed in the hands of the former was\nout of all proportion greater than that entrusted to the latter. For\nwhen a dictator was appointed there still remained the tribunes, the\nconsuls, and the senate, all of them invested with authority of which\nthe dictator could not deprive them. For even if he could have taken\nhis consulship from one man, or his status as a senator from another,\nhe could not abolish the senatorial rank nor pass new laws. So that the\nsenate, the consuls, and the tribunes continuing to exist with\nundiminished authority were a check upon him and kept him in the right\nroad. But on the creation of the Ten, the opposite of all this took\nplace. For on their appointment, consuls and tribunes were swept away,\nand express powers were given to the new magistrates to make laws and\ndo whatever else they thought fit, with the entire authority of the\nwhole Roman people. So that finding themselves alone without consuls or\ntribunes to control them, and with no appeal against them to the\npeople, and thus there being none to keep a watch upon them, and\nfurther being stimulated by the ambition of Appius, in the second year\nof their office they began to wax insolent.\nLet it be noted, therefore, that when it is said that authority given\nby the public vote is never hurtful to any commonwealth, it is assumed\nthat the people will never be led to confer that authority without due\nlimitations, or for other than a reasonable term. Should they, however\neither from being deceived or otherwise blinded, be induced to bestow\nauthority imprudently, as the Romans bestowed it on the Ten, it will\nalways fare with them as with the Romans. And this may readily be\nunderstood on reflecting what causes operated to keep the dictator\ngood, what to make the Ten bad, and by observing how those republics\nwhich have been accounted well governed, have acted when conferring\nauthority for an extended period, as the Spartans on their kings and\nthe Venetians on their doges; for it will be seen that in both these\ninstances the authority was controlled by checks which made it\nimpossible for it to be abused. But where an uncontrolled authority is\ngiven, no security is afforded by the circumstance that the body of the\npeople is not corrupted; for in the briefest possible time absolute\nauthority will make a people corrupt, and obtain for itself friends and\npartisans. Nor will it be any hindrance to him in whom such authority\nis vested, that he is poor and without connections, for wealth and\nevery other advantage will quickly follow, as shall be shown more fully\nwhen we discuss the appointment of the Ten.\nCHAPTER XXXVI.\u2014_That Citizens who have held the higher Offices of a\nCommonwealth should not disdain the lower_.\nUnder the consuls M. Fabius and Cn. Manlius, the Romans had a memorable\nvictory in a battle fought with the Veientines and the Etruscans, in\nwhich Q. Fabius, brother of the consul, who had himself been consul the\nyear before, was slain. This event may lead us to remark how well the\nmethods followed by the city of Rome were suited to increase her power,\nand how great a mistake is made by other republics in departing from\nthem. For, eager as the Romans were in the pursuit of glory, they never\nesteemed it a dishonour to obey one whom before they had commanded, or\nto find themselves serving in the ranks of an army which once they had\nled. This usage, however, is opposed to the ideas, the rules, and the\npractice which prevail at the present day, as, for instance, in Venice,\nwhere the notion still obtains that a citizen who has filled a great\noffice should be ashamed to accept a less; and where the State itself\npermits him to decline it. This course, assuming it to lend lustre to\nindividual citizens, is plainly to the disadvantage of the community,\nwhich has reason to hope more from, and to trust more to, the citizen\nwho descends from a high office to fill a lower, than him who rises\nfrom a low office to fill a high one; for in the latter no confidence\ncan reasonably be placed, unless he be seen to have others about him of\nsuch credit and worth that it may be hoped their wise counsels and\ninfluence will correct his inexperience. But had the usage which\nprevails in Venice and in other modern commonwealths and kingdoms,\nprevailed in Rome whereby he who had once been consul was never\nafterwards to go with the army except as consul, numberless results\nmust have followed detrimental to the free institutions of that city;\nas well from the mistakes which the inexperience of new men would have\noccasioned, as because from their ambition having a freer course, and\nfrom their having none near them in whose presence they might fear to\ndo amiss, they would have grown less scrupulous; and in this way the\npublic service must have suffered grave harm.\nCHAPTER XXXVII.\u2014_Of the Mischief bred in Rome by the Agrarian Law: and\nhow it is a great source of disorder in a Commonwealth to pass a Law\nopposed to ancient Usage and with stringent retrospective Effect._\nIt has been said by ancient writers that to be pinched by adversity or\npampered by prosperity is the common lot of men, and that in whichever\nway they are acted upon the result is the same. For when no longer\nurged to war on one another by necessity, they are urged by ambition,\nwhich has such dominion in their hearts that it never leaves them to\nwhatsoever heights they climb. For nature has so ordered it that while\nthey desire everything, it is impossible for them to have everything,\nand thus their desires being always in excess of their capacity to\ngratify them, they remain constantly dissatisfied and discontented. And\nhence the vicissitudes in human affairs. For some seeking to enlarge\ntheir possessions, and some to keep what they have got, wars and\nenmities ensue, from which result the ruin of one country and the\ngrowth of another.\nI am led to these reflections from observing that the commons of Rome\nwere not content to secure themselves against the nobles by the\ncreation of tribunes, a measure to which they were driven by necessity,\nbut after effecting this, forthwith entered upon an ambitious contest\nwith the nobles, seeking to share with them what all men most esteem,\nnamely, their honours and their wealth. Hence was bred that disorder\nfrom which sprang the feuds relating to the Agrarian Laws, and which\nled in the end to the downfall of the Roman republic. And although it\nshould be the object of every well-governed commonwealth to make the\nState rich and keep individual citizens poor it must be allowed that in\nthe matter of this law the city of Rome was to blame; whether for\nhaving passed it at first in such a shape as to require it to be\ncontinually recast; or for having postponed it so long that its\nretrospective effect was the occasion of tumult; or else, because,\nalthough rightly framed at first, it had come in its operation to be\nperverted. But in whatever way it happened, so it was, that this law\nwas never spoken of in Rome without the whole city being convulsed.\nThe law itself embraced two principal provisions. By one it was enacted\nthat no citizen should possess more than a fixed number of acres of\nland; by the other that all lands taken from the enemy should be\ndistributed among the whole people. A twofold blow was thus aimed at\nthe nobles; since all who possessed more land than the law allowed, as\nmost of the nobles did, fell to be deprived of it; while by dividing\nthe lands of the enemy among the whole people, the road to wealth was\nclosed. These two grounds of offence being given to a powerful class,\nto whom it appeared that by resisting the law they did a service to the\nState, the whole city, as I have said, was thrown into an uproar on the\nmere mention of its name. The nobles indeed sought to temporize, and to\nprevail by patience and address; sometimes calling out the army,\nsometimes opposing another tribune to the one who was promoting the\nlaw, and sometimes coming to a compromise by sending a colony into the\nlands which were to be divided; as was done in the case of the\nterritory of Antium, whither, on a dispute concerning the law having\narisen, settlers were sent from Rome, and the land made over to them.\nIn speaking of which colony Titus Livius makes the notable remark, that\nhardly any one in Rome could be got to take part in it, so much readier\nwere the commons to indulge in covetous schemes at home, than to\nrealize them by leaving it.\nThe ill humour engendered by this contest continued to prevail until\nthe Romans began to carry their arms into the remoter parts of Italy\nand to countries beyond its shores; after which it seemed for a time to\nslumber\u2014and this, because the lands held by the enemies of Rome, out of\nsight of her citizens and too remote to be conveniently cultivated,\ncame to be less desired. Whereupon the Romans grew less eager to punish\ntheir enemies by dividing their lands, and were content, when they\ndeprived any city of its territory, to send colonists to occupy it. For\ncauses such as these, the measure remained in abeyance down to the time\nof the Gracchi; but being by them revived, finally overthrew the\nliberty of Rome. For as it found the power of its adversaries doubled,\nsuch a flame of hatred was kindled between commons and senate, that,\nregardless of all civil restraints, they resorted to arms and\nbloodshed. And as the public magistrates were powerless to provide a\nremedy, each of the two factions having no longer any hopes from them,\nresolved to do what it could for itself, and to set up a chief for its\nown protection. On reaching this stage of tumult and disorder, the\ncommons lent their influence to Marius, making him four times consul;\nwhose authority, lasting thus long, and with very brief intervals,\nbecame so firmly rooted that he was able to make himself consul other\nthree times. Against this scourge, the nobles, lacking other defence,\nset themselves to favour Sylla, and placing him at the head of their\nfaction, entered on the civil wars; wherein, after much blood had been\nspilt, and after many changes of fortune, they got the better of their\nadversaries. But afterwards, in the time of C\u00e6sar and Pompey, the\ndistemper broke out afresh; for C\u00e6sar heading the Marian party, and\nPompey, that of Sylla, and war ensuing, the victory remained with\nC\u00e6sar, who was the first tyrant in Rome; after whose time that city was\nnever again free. Such, therefore, was the beginning and such the end\nof the Agrarian Law.\nBut since it has elsewhere been said that the struggle between the\ncommons and senate of Rome preserved her liberties, as giving rise to\nlaws favourable to freedom, it might seem that the consequences of the\nAgrarian Law are opposed to that view. I am not, however, led to alter\nmy opinion on this account; for I maintain that the ambition of the\ngreat is so pernicious that unless controlled and counteracted in a\nvariety of ways, it will always reduce a city to speedy ruin. So that\nif the controversy over the Agrarian Laws took three hundred years to\nbring Rome to slavery, she would in all likelihood have been brought to\nslavery in a far shorter time, had not the commons, by means of this\nlaw, and by other demands, constantly restrained the ambition of the\nnobles.\nWe may also learn from this contest how much more men value wealth than\nhonours; for in the matter of honours, the Roman nobles always gave way\nto the commons without any extraordinary resistance; but when it came\nto be a question of property, so stubborn were they in its defence,\nthat the commons to effect their ends had to resort to those irregular\nmethods which have been described above. Of which irregularities the\nprime movers were the Gracchi, whose motives are more to be commended\nthan their measures; since to pass a law with stringent retrospective\neffect, in order to remove an abuse of long standing in a republic, is\nan unwise step, and one which, as I have already shown at length, can\nhave no other result than to accelerate the mischief to which the abuse\nleads; whereas, if you temporize, either the abuse develops more\nslowly, or else, in course of time, and before it comes to a head, dies\nout of itself.\nCHAPTER XXXVIII.\u2014_That weak Republics are irresolute and undecided; and\nthat the course they may take depends more on Necessity than Choice._\nA terrible pestilence breaking out in Rome seemed to the Equians and\nVolscians to offer a fit opportunity for crushing her. The two nations,\ntherefore, assembling a great army, attacked the Latins and Hernicians\nand laid waste their country. Whereupon the Latins and Hernicians were\nforced to make their case known to the Romans, and to ask to be\ndefended by them. The Romans, who were sorely afflicted by the\npestilence, answered that they must look to their own defence, and with\ntheir own forces, since Rome was in no position to succour them.\nHere we recognize the prudence and magnanimity of the Roman senate, and\nhow at all times, and in all changes of fortune, they assumed the\nresponsibility of determining the course their country should take; and\nwere not ashamed, when necessary, to decide on a course contrary to\nthat which was usual with them, or which they had decided to follow on\nsome other occasion. I say this because on other occasions this same\nsenate had forbidden these nations to defend themselves; and a less\nprudent assembly might have thought it lowered their credit to withdraw\nthat prohibition. But the Roman senate always took a sound view of\nthings, and always accepted the least hurtful course as the best. So\nthat, although it was distasteful to them not to be able to defend\ntheir subjects, and equally distasteful\u2014both for the reasons given, and\nfor others which may be understood\u2014that their subjects should take up\narms in their absence, nevertheless knowing that these must have\nrecourse to arms in any case, since the enemy was upon them, they took\nan honourable course in deciding that what had to be done should be\ndone with their leave, lest men driven to disobey by necessity should\ncome afterwards to disobey from choice. And although this may seem the\ncourse which every republic ought reasonably to follow, nevertheless\nweak and badly-advised republics cannot make up their minds to follow\nit, not knowing how to do themselves honour in like extremities.\nAfter Duke Valentino had taken Faenza and forced Bologna to yield to\nhis terms, desiring to return to Rome through Tuscany, he sent one of\nhis people to Florence to ask leave for himself and his army to pass. A\ncouncil was held in Florence to consider how this request should be\ndealt with, but no one was favourable to the leave asked for being\ngranted. Wherein the Roman method was not followed. For as the Duke had\na very strong force with him, while the Florentines were so bare of\ntroops that they could not have prevented his passage, it would have\nbeen far more for their credit that he should seem to pass with their\nconsent, than that he should pass in spite of them; because, while\ndiscredit had to be incurred either way, they would have incurred less\nby acceding to his demand.\nBut of all courses the worst for a weak State is to be irresolute; for\nthen whatever it does will seem to be done under compulsion, so that if\nby chance it should do anything well, this will be set down to\nnecessity and not to prudence. Of this I shall cite two other instances\nhappening in our own times, and in our own country. In the year 1500,\nKing Louis of France, after recovering Milan, being desirous to restore\nPisa to the Florentines, so as to obtain payment from them of the fifty\nthousand ducats which they had promised him on the restitution being\ncompleted, sent troops to Pisa under M. Beaumont, in whom, though a\nFrenchman, the Florentines put much trust. Beaumont accordingly took up\nhis position with his forces between Cascina and Pisa, to be in\nreadiness to attack the town. After he had been there for some days\nmaking arrangements for the assault, envoys came to him from Pisa\noffering to surrender their city to the French if a promise were given\nin the king\u2019s name, not to hand it over to the Florentines until four\nmonths had run. This condition was absolutely rejected by the\nFlorentines, and the siege being proceeded with, they were forced to\nretire with disgrace. Now the proposal of the Pisans was rejected by\nthe Florentines for no other reason than that they distrusted the good\nfaith of the King, into whose hands their weakness obliged them to\ncommit themselves, and did not reflect how much more it was for their\ninterest that, by obtaining entrance into Pisa, he should have it in\nhis power to restore the town to them, or, failing to restore it,\nshould at once disclose his designs, than that remaining outside he\nshould put them off with promises for which they had to pay. It would\ntherefore have been a far better course for the Florentines to have\nagreed to Beaumont taking possession on whatever terms.\nThis was seen afterwards by experience in the year 1502, when, on the\nrevolt of Arezzo, M. Imbalt was sent by the King of France with French\ntroops to assist the Florentines. For when he got near Arezzo, and\nbegan to negotiate with the Aretines, who, like the Pisans, were\nwilling to surrender their town on terms, the acceptance of these terms\nwas strongly disapproved in Florence; which Imbalt learning, and\nthinking that the Florentines were acting with little sense, he took\nthe entire settlement of conditions into his own hands, and, without\nconsulting the Florentine commissioners, concluded an arrangement to\nhis own satisfaction, in execution of which he entered Arezzo with his\narmy. And he let the Florentines know that he thought them fools and\nignorant of the ways of the world; since if they desired to have\nArezzo, they could signify their wishes to the King, who would be much\nbetter able to give it them when he had his soldiers inside, than when\nhe had them outside the town. Nevertheless, in Florence they never\nceased to blame and abuse M. Imbalt, until at last they came to see\nthat if Beaumont had acted in the same way, they would have got\npossession Of Pisa as well as of Arezzo.\nApplying what has been said to the matter in hand, we find that\nirresolute republics, unless upon compulsion, never follow wise\ncourses; for wherever there is room for doubt, their weakness will not\nsuffer them to come to any resolve; so that unless their doubts be\novercome by some superior force which impels them forward, they remain\nalways in suspense.\nCHAPTER XXXIX.\u2014_That often the same Accidents are seen to befall\ndifferent Nations._\nAny one comparing the present with the past will soon perceive that in\nall cities and in all nations there prevail the same desires and\npassions as always have prevailed; for which reason it should be an\neasy matter for him who carefully examines past events, to foresee\nthose which are about to happen in any republic, and to apply such\nremedies as the ancients have used in like cases; or finding none which\nhave been used by them, to strike out new ones, such as they might have\nused in similar circumstances. But these lessons being neglected or not\nunderstood by readers, or, if understood by them, being unknown to\nrulers, it follows that the same disorders are common to all times.\nIn the year 1494 the Republic of Florence, having lost a portion of its\nterritories, including Pisa and other towns, was forced to make war\nagainst those who had taken possession of them, who being powerful, it\nfollowed that great sums were spent on these wars to little purpose.\nThis large expenditure had to be met by heavy taxes which gave occasion\nto numberless complaints on the part of the people; and inasmuch as the\nwar was conducted by a council of ten citizens, who were styled \u201cthe\nTen of the War,\u201d the multitude began to regard these with displeasure,\nas though they were the cause of the war and of the consequent\nexpenditure; and at last persuaded themselves that if they got rid of\nthis magistracy there would be an end to the war. Wherefore when the\nmagistracy of \u201cthe Ten\u201d should have been renewed, the people did not\nrenew it, but, suffering it to lapse, entrusted their affairs to the\n\u201cSignory.\u201d This course was most pernicious, since not only did it fail\nto put an end to the war, as the people expected it would, but by\nsetting aside men who had conducted it with prudence, led to such\nmishaps that not Pisa only, but Arezzo also, and many other towns\nbesides were lost to Florence. Whereupon, the people recognizing their\nmistake, and that the evil was in the disease and not in the physician,\nreinstated the magistracy of the Ten.\nSimilar dissatisfaction grew up in Rome against the consular authority.\nFor the people seeing one war follow another, and that they were never\nallowed to rest, when they should have ascribed this to the ambition of\nneighbouring nations who desired their overthrow, ascribed it to the\nambition of the nobles, who, as they believed, being unable to wreak\ntheir hatred against them within the city, where they were protected by\nthe power of the tribunes, sought to lead them outside the city, where\nthey were under the authority of the consuls, that they might crush\nthem where they were without help. In which belief they thought it\nnecessary either to get rid of the consuls altogether, or so to\nrestrict their powers as to leave them no authority over the people,\neither in the city or out of it.\nThe first who attempted to pass a law to this effect was the tribune\nTerentillus, who proposed that a committee of five should be named to\nconsider and regulate the power of the consuls. This roused the anger\nof the nobles, to whom it seemed that the greatness of their authority\nwas about to set for ever, and that no part would be left them in the\nadministration of the republic. Such, however, was the obstinacy of the\ntribunes, that they succeeded in abolishing the consular title, nor\nwere satisfied until, after other changes, it was resolved that, in\nroom of consuls, tribunes should be appointed with consular powers; so\nmuch greater was their hatred of the name than of the thing. For a long\ntime matters remained on this footing; till eventually, the commons,\ndiscovering their mistake, resumed the appointment of consuls in the\nsame way as the Florentines reverted to \u201cthe Ten of the War.\u201d\nCHAPTER XL.\u2014_Of the creation of the Decemvirate in Rome, and what\ntherein is to be noted. Wherein among other Matters is shown how the\nsame Causes may lead to the Safety or to the Ruin of a Commonwealth._\nIt being my desire to treat fully of those disorders which arose in\nRome on the creation of the decemvirate, I think it not amiss first of\nall to relate what took place at the time of that creation, and then to\ndiscuss those circumstances attending it which seem most to deserve\nnotice. These are numerous, and should be well considered, both by\nthose who would maintain the liberties of a commonwealth and by those\nwho would subvert them. For in the course of our inquiry it will be\nseen that many mistakes prejudicial to freedom were made by the senate\nand people, and that many were likewise made by Appius, the chief\ndecemvir, prejudicial to that tyranny which it was his aim to establish\nin Rome.\nAfter much controversy and wrangling between the commons and the nobles\nas to the framing of new laws by which the freedom of Rome might be\nbetter secured, Spurius Posthumius and two other citizens were, by\ngeneral consent, despatched to Athens to procure copies of the laws\nwhich Solon had drawn up for the Athenians, to the end that these might\nserve as a groundwork for the laws of Rome. On their return, the next\nstep was to depute certain persons to examine these laws and to draft\nthe new code. For which purpose a commission consisting of ten members,\namong whom was Appius Claudius, a crafty and ambitious citizen, was\nappointed for a year; and that the commissioners in framing their laws\nmight act without fear or favour, all the other magistracies, and in\nparticular the consulate and tribuneship, were suspended, and the\nappeal to the people discontinued; so that the decemvirs came to be\nabsolute in Rome. Very soon the whole authority of the commissioners\ncame to be centred in Appius, owing to the favour in which he was held\nby the commons. For although before he had been regarded as the cruel\npersecutor of the people, he now showed himself so conciliatory in his\nbearing that men wondered at the sudden change in his character and\ndisposition.\nThis set of commissioners, then, behaved discreetly, being attended by\nno more than twelve lictors, walking in front of that decemvir whom the\nrest put forward as their chief; and though vested with absolute\nauthority, yet when a Roman citizen had to be tried for murder, they\ncited him before the people and caused him to be judged by them. Their\nlaws they wrote upon ten tables, but before signing them they exposed\nthem publicly, that every one might read and consider them, and if any\ndefect were discovered in them, it might be corrected before they were\nfinally passed. At this juncture Appius caused it to be notified\nthroughout the city that were two other tables added to these ten, the\nlaws would be complete; hoping that under this belief the people would\nconsent to continue the decemvirate for another year. This consent the\npeople willingly gave, partly to prevent the consuls being reinstated,\nand partly because they thought they could hold their ground without\nthe aid of the tribunes, who, as has already been said, were the judges\nin criminal cases.\nOn it being resolved to reappoint the decemvirate, all the nobles set\nto canvass for the office, Appius among the foremost; and such\ncordiality did he display towards the commons while seeking their\nvotes, that the other candidates, \u201c_unable to persuade themselves that\nso much affability on the part of so proud a man was wholly\ndisinterested,_\u201d began to suspect him; but fearing to oppose him\nopenly, sought to circumvent him, by putting him forward, though the\nyoungest of them all, to declare to the people the names of the\nproposed decemvirs; thinking that he would not venture to name himself,\nthat being an unusual course in Rome, and held discreditable. \u201c_But\nwhat they meant as a hindrance, he turned to account,_\u201d by proposing,\nto the surprise and displeasure of the whole nobility, his own name\nfirst, and then nominating nine others on whose support he thought he\ncould depend.\nThe new appointments, which were to last for a year, having been made,\nAppius soon let both commons and nobles know the mistake they had\ncommitted, for throwing off the mask, he allowed his innate arrogance\nto appear, and speedily infected his colleagues with the same spirit;\nwho, to overawe the people and the senate, instead of twelve lictors,\nappointed one hundred and twenty. For a time their measures were\ndirected against high and low alike; but presently they began to\nintrigue with the senate, and to attack the commons; and if any of the\nlatter, on being harshly used by one decemvir, ventured to appeal to\nanother, he was worse handled on the appeal than in the first instance.\nThe commons, on discovering their error, began in their despair to turn\ntheir eyes towards the nobles, \u201c_and to look for a breeze of freedom\nfrom that very quarter whence fearing slavery they had brought the\nrepublic to its present straits._\u201d To the nobles the sufferings of the\ncommons were not displeasing, from the hope \u201c_that disgusted with the\nexisting state of affairs, they too might come to desire the\nrestoration of the consuls._\u201d\nWhen the year for which the decemvirs were appointed at last came to an\nend, the two additional tables of the law were ready, but had not yet\nbeen published. This was made a pretext by them for prolonging their\nmagistracy, which they took measures to retain by force, gathering\nround them for this purpose a retinue of young noblemen, whom they\nenriched with the goods of those citizens whom they had condemned.\n\u201c_Corrupted by which gifts, these youths came to prefer selfish licence\nto public freedom._\u201d\nIt happened that at this time the Sabines and Volscians began to stir\nup a war against Rome, and it was during the alarm thereby occasioned\nthat the decemvirs were first made aware how weak was their position.\nFor without the senate they could take no warlike measures, while by\nassembling the senate they seemed to put an end to their own authority.\nNevertheless, being driven to it by necessity, they took this latter\ncourse. When the senate met, many of the senators, but particularly\nValerius and Horatius, inveighed against the insolence of the\ndecemvirs, whose power would forthwith have been cut short, had not the\nsenate through jealousy of the commons declined to exercise their\nauthority. For they thought that were the decemvirs to lay down office\nof their own free will, tribunes might not be reappointed. Wherefore\nthey decided for war, and sent forth the armies under command of\ncertain of the decemvirs. But Appius remaining behind to govern the\ncity, it so fell out that he became enamoured of Virginia, and that\nwhen he sought to lay violent hands upon her, Virginius, her father, to\nsave her from dishonour, slew her. Thereupon followed tumults in Rome,\nand mutiny among the soldiers, who, making common cause with the rest\nof the plebeians, betook themselves to the Sacred Hill, and there\nremained until the decemvirs laid down their office; when tribunes and\nconsuls being once more appointed, Rome was restored to her ancient\nfreedom.\nIn these events we note, first of all, that the pernicious step of\ncreating this tyranny in Rome was due to the same causes which commonly\ngive rise to tyrannies in cities; namely, the excessive love of the\npeople for liberty, and the passionate eagerness of the nobles to\ngovern. For when they cannot agree to pass some measure favourable to\nfreedom, one faction or the other sets itself to support some one man,\nand a tyranny at once springs up. Both parties in Rome consented to the\ncreation of the decemvirs, and to their exercising unrestricted powers,\nfrom the desire which the one had to put an end to the consular name,\nand the other to abolish the authority of the tribunes. When, on the\nappointment of the decemvirate, it seemed to the commons that Appius\nhad become favourable to their cause, and was ready to attack the\nnobles, they inclined to support him. But when a people is led to\ncommit this error of lending its support to some one man, in order that\nhe may attack those whom it holds in hatred, if he only be prudent he\nwill inevitably become the tyrant of that city. For he will wait until,\nwith the support of the people, he can deal a fatal blow to the nobles,\nand will never set himself to oppress the people until the nobles have\nbeen rooted out. But when that time comes, the people, although they\nrecognize their servitude, will have none to whom they can turn for\nhelp.\nHad this method, which has been followed by all who have successfully\nestablished tyrannies in republics, been followed by Appius, his power\nwould have been more stable and lasting; whereas, taking the directly\nopposite course, he could not have acted more unwisely than he did. For\nin his eagerness to grasp the tyranny, he made himself obnoxious to\nthose who were in fact conferring it, and who could have maintained him\nin it; and he destroyed those who were his friends, while he sought\nfriendship from those from whom he could not have it. For although it\nbe the desire of the nobles to tyrannize, that section of them which\nfinds itself outside the tyranny is always hostile to the tyrant, who\ncan never succeed in gaining over the entire body of the nobles by\nreason of their greed and ambition; for no tyrant can ever have honours\nor wealth enough to satisfy them all.\nIn abandoning the people, therefore, and siding with the nobles, Appius\ncommitted a manifest mistake, as well for the reasons above given, as\nbecause to hold a thing by force, he who uses force must needs be\nstronger than he against whom it is used. Whence it happens that those\ntyrants who have the mass of the people for their friends and the\nnobles for their enemies, are more secure than those who have the\npeople for their enemies and the nobles for their friends; because in\nthe former case their authority has the stronger support. For with such\nsupport a ruler can maintain himself by the internal strength of his\nState, as did Nabis, tyrant of Sparta, when attacked by the Romans and\nby the whole of Greece; for making sure work with the nobles, who were\nfew in number, and having the people on his side, he was able with\ntheir assistance to defend himself; which he could not have done had\nthey been against him. But in the case of a city, wherein the tyrant\nhas few friends, its internal strength will not avail him for its\ndefence, and he will have to seek aid from without in one of three\nshapes. For either he must hire foreign guards to defend his person; or\nhe must arm the peasantry, so that they may play the part which ought\nto be played by the citizens; or he must league with powerful\nneighbours for his defence. He who follows these methods and observes\nthem well, may contrive to save himself, though he has the people for\nhis enemy. But Appius could not follow the plan of gaining over the\npeasantry, since in Rome they and the people were one. And what he\nmight have done he knew not how to do, and so was ruined at the very\noutset.\nIn creating the decemvirate, therefore, both the senate and the people\nmade grave mistakes. For although, as already explained, when speaking\nof the dictatorship, it is those magistrates who make themselves, and\nnot those made by the votes of the people, that are hurtful to freedom;\nnevertheless the people, in creating magistrates ought to take such\nprecautions as will make it difficult for these to become bad. But the\nRomans when they ought to have set a check on the decemvirs in order to\nkeep them good, dispensed with it, making them the sole magistrates of\nRome, and setting aside all others; and this from the excessive desire\nof the senate to get rid of the tribunes, and of the commons to get rid\nof the consuls; by which objects both were so blinded as to fall into\nall the disorders which ensued. For, as King Ferrando was wont to say,\nmen often behave like certain of the smaller birds, which are so intent\non the prey to which nature incites them, that they discern not the\neagle hovering overhead for their destruction.\nIn this Discourse then the mistakes made by the Roman people in their\nefforts to preserve their freedom and the mistakes made by Appius in\nhis endeavour to obtain the tyranny, have, as I proposed at the outset,\nbeen plainly shown.\nCHAPTER XLI.\u2014_That it is unwise to pass at a bound from leniency to\nseverity, or to a haughty bearing from a humble._\nAmong the crafty devices used by Appius to aid him in maintaining his\nauthority, this, of suddenly passing from one character to the other\nextreme, was of no small prejudice to him. For his fraud in pretending\nto the commons to be well disposed towards them, was happily contrived;\nas were also the means he took to bring about the reappointment of the\ndecemvirate. Most skilful, too, was his audacity in nominating himself\ncontrary to the expectation of the nobles, and in proposing colleagues\non whom he could depend to carry out his ends. But, as I have said\nalready, it was not happily contrived that, after doing all this, he\nshould suddenly turn round, and from being the friend, reveal himself\nthe enemy of the people; haughty instead of humane; cruel instead of\nkindly; and make this change so rapidly as to leave himself no shadow\nof excuse, but compel all to recognize the doubleness of his nature.\nFor he who has once seemed good, should he afterwards choose, for his\nown ends, to become bad, ought to change by slow degrees, and as\nopportunity serves; so that before his altered nature strip him of old\nfavour, he may have gained for himself an equal share of new, and thus\nhis influence suffer no diminution. For otherwise, being at once\nunmasked and friendless, he is undone:\nCHAPTER XLII.\u2014_How easily Men become corrupted._\nIn this matter of the decemvirate we may likewise note the ease\nwherewith men become corrupted, and how completely, although born good\nand well brought up, they change their nature. For we see how\nfavourably disposed the youths whom Appius gathered round him became\ntowards his tyranny, in return for the trifling benefits which they\ndrew from it; and how Quintus Fabius, one of the second decemvirate and\na most worthy man, blinded by a little ambition, and misled by the evil\ncounsels of Appius, abandoning his fair fame, betook himself to most\nunworthy courses, and grew like his master.\nCareful consideration of this should make those who frame laws for\ncommonwealths and kingdoms more alive to the necessity of placing\nrestraints on men\u2019s evil appetites, and depriving them of all hope of\ndoing wrong with impunity.\nCHAPTER XLIII.\u2014_That Men fighting in their own Cause make good and\nresolute Soldiers._\nFrom what has been touched upon above, we are also led to remark how\nwide is the difference between an army which, having no ground for\ndiscontent, fights in its own cause, and one which, being discontented,\nfights to satisfy the ambition of others. For whereas the Romans were\nalways victorious under the consuls, under the decemvirs they were\nalways defeated. This helps us to understand why it is that mercenary\ntroops are worthless; namely, that they have no incitement to keep them\ntrue to you beyond the pittance which you pay them, which neither is\nnor can be a sufficient motive for such fidelity and devotion as would\nmake them willing to die in your behalf. But in those armies in which\nthere exists not such an attachment towards him for whom they fight as\nmakes them devoted to his cause, there never will be valour enough to\nwithstand an enemy if only he be a little brave. And since such\nattachment and devotion cannot be looked for from any save your own\nsubjects, you must, if you would preserve your dominions, or maintain\nyour commonwealth or kingdom, arm the natives of your country; as we\nsee to have been done by all those who have achieved great things in\nwar.\nUnder the decemvirs the ancient valour of the Roman soldiers had in no\ndegree abated; yet, because they were no longer animated by the same\ngood will, they did not exert themselves as they were wont. But so soon\nas the decemvirate came to an end, and the soldiers began once more to\nfight as free men, the old spirit was reawakened, and, as a\nconsequence, their enterprises, according to former usage, were brought\nto a successful close.\nCHAPTER XLIV.\u2014_That the Multitude is helpless without a Head: and that\nwe should not with the same breath threaten and ask leave._\nWhen Virginia died by her father\u2019s hand, the commons of Rome withdrew\nunder arms to the Sacred Hill. Whereupon the senate sent messengers to\ndemand by what sanction they had deserted their commanders and\nassembled there in arms. And in such reverence was the authority of the\nsenate held, that the commons, lacking leaders, durst make no reply.\n\u201cNot,\u201d says Titus Livius, \u201cthat they were at a loss what to answer, but\nbecause they had none to answer for them;\u201d words which clearly show how\nhelpless a thing is the multitude when without a head.\nThis defect was perceived by Virginius, at whose instance twenty\nmilitary tribunes were appointed by the commons to be their spokesmen\nwith the senate, and to negotiate terms; who, having asked that\nValerius and Horatius might be sent to them, to whom their wishes would\nbe made known, these declined to go until the decemvirs had laid down\ntheir office. When this was done, and Valerius and Horatius came to the\nhill where the commons were assembled, the latter demanded that\ntribunes of the people should be appointed; that in future there should\nbe an appeal to the people from the magistrates of whatever degree; and\nthat all the decemvirs should be given up to them to be burned alive.\nValerius and Horatius approved the first two demands, but rejected the\nlast as inhuman; telling the commons that \u201cthey were rushing into that\nvery cruelty which they themselves had condemned in others;\u201d and\ncounselling them to say nothing about the decemvirs, but to be\nsatisfied to regain their own power and authority; since thus the way\nwould be open to them for obtaining every redress.\nHere we see plainly how foolish and unwise it is to ask a thing and\nwith the same breath to say, \u201cI desire this that I may inflict an\ninjury.\u201d For we should never declare our intention beforehand, but\nwatch for every opportunity to carry it out. So that it is enough to\nask another for his weapons, without adding, \u201cWith these I purpose to\ndestroy you;\u201d for when once you have secured his weapons, you can use\nthem afterwards as you please.\nCHAPTER XLV.\u2014_That it is of evil example, especially in the Maker of a\nLaw, not to observe the Law when made: and that daily to renew acts of\ninjustice in a City is most hurtful to the Governor._\nTerms having been adjusted, and the old order of things restored in\nRome, Virginius cited Appius to defend himself before the people; and\non his appearing attended by many of the nobles, ordered him to be led\nto prison. Whereupon Appius began to cry out and appeal to the people.\nBut Virginius told him that he was unworthy to be allowed that appeal\nwhich he had himself done away with, or to have that people whom he had\nwronged for his protectors. Appius rejoined, that the people should not\nset at nought that right of appeal which they themselves had insisted\non with so much zeal. Nevertheless, he was dragged to prison, and\nbefore the day of trial slew himself. Now, though the wicked life of\nAppius merited every punishment, still it was impolitic to violate the\nlaws, more particularly a law which had only just been passed; for\nnothing, I think, is of worse example in a republic, than to make a law\nand not to keep it; and most of all, when he who breaks is he that made\nit.\nAfter the year 1494, the city of Florence reformed its government with\nthe help of the Friar Girolamo Savonarola, whose writings declare his\nlearning, his wisdom, and the excellence of his heart. Among other\nordinances for the safety of the citizens, he caused a law to be\npassed, allowing an appeal to the people from the sentences pronounced\nby \u201cthe Eight\u201d and by the \u201cSignory\u201d in trials for State offences; a law\nhe had long contended for, and carried at last with great difficulty.\nIt so happened that a very short time after it was passed, five\ncitizens were condemned to death by the \u201cSignory\u201d for State offences,\nand that when they sought to appeal to the people they were not\npermitted to do so, and the law was violated. This, more than any other\nmischance, helped to lessen the credit of the Friar; since if his law\nof appeal was salutary, he should have caused it to be observed; if\nuseless, he ought not to have promoted it. And his inconsistency was\nthe more remarked, because in all the sermons which he preached after\nthe law was broken, he never either blamed or excused the person who\nhad broken it, as though unwilling to condemn, while unable to justify\nwhat suited his purposes. This, as betraying the ambitious and partial\nturn of his mind, took from his reputation and exposed him to much\nobloquy.\nAnother thing which greatly hurts a government is to keep alive bitter\nfeelings in men\u2019s minds by often renewed attacks on individuals, as was\ndone in Rome after the decemvirate was put an end to. For each of the\ndecemvirs, and other citizens besides, were at different times accused\nand condemned, so that the greatest alarm was spread through the whole\nbody of the nobles, who came to believe that these prosecutions would\nnever cease until their entire order was exterminated. And this must\nhave led to grave mischief had not Marcus Duilius the tribune provided\nagainst it, by an edict which forbade every one, for the period of a\nyear, citing or accusing any Roman citizen, an ordinance which had the\neffect of reassuring the whole nobility. Here we see how hurtful it is\nfor a prince or commonwealth to keep the minds of their subjects in\nconstant alarm and suspense by continually renewed punishments and\nviolence. And, in truth, no course can be more pernicious. For men who\nare in fear for their safety will seize on every opportunity for\nsecuring themselves against the dangers which surround them, and will\ngrow at once more daring, and less scrupulous in resorting to new\ncourses. For these reasons we should either altogether avoid inflicting\ninjury, or should inflict every injury at a stroke, and then seek to\nreassure men\u2019s minds and suffer them to settle down and rest.\nCHAPTER XLVI.\u2014_That Men climb from one step of Ambition to another,\nseeking at first to escape Injury and then to injure others._\nAs the commons of Rome on recovering their freedom were restored to\ntheir former position\u2014nay, to one still stronger since many new laws\nhad been passed which confirmed and extended their authority,\u2014it might\nreasonably have been hoped that Rome would for a time remain at rest.\nThe event, however, showed the contrary, for from day to day there\narose in that city new tumults and fresh dissensions. And since the\ncauses which brought this about have been most judiciously set forth by\nTitus Livius, it seems to me much to the purpose to cite his own words\nwhen he says, that \u201cwhenever either the commons or the nobles were\nhumble, the others grew haughty; so that if the commons kept within due\nbounds, the young nobles began to inflict injuries upon them, against\nwhich the tribunes, who were themselves made the objects of outrage,\nwere little able to give redress; while the nobles on their part,\nalthough they could not close their eyes to the ill behaviour of their\nyoung men, were yet well pleased that if excesses were to be committed,\nthey should be committed by their own faction, and not by the commons.\nThus the desire to secure its own liberty prompted each faction to make\nitself strong enough to oppress the other. For this is the common\ncourse of things, that in seeking to escape cause for fear, men come to\ngive others cause to be afraid by inflicting on them those wrongs from\nwhich they strive to relieve themselves; as though the choice lay\nbetween injuring and being injured.\u201d\nHerein, among other things, we perceive in what ways commonwealths are\noverthrown, and how men climb from one ambition to another; and\nrecognize the truth of those words which Sallust puts in the mouth of\nC\u00e6sar, that \u201c_all ill actions have their origin in fair\nbeginnings._\u201d[4] For, as I have said already, the ambitious citizen in\na commonwealth seeks at the outset to secure himself against injury,\nnot only at the hands of private persons, but also of the magistrates;\nto effect which he endeavours to gain himself friends. These he obtains\nby means honourable in appearance, either by supplying them with money\nor protecting them against the powerful. And because such conduct seems\npraiseworthy, every one is readily deceived by it, and consequently no\nremedy is applied. Pursuing these methods without hindrance, this man\npresently comes to be so powerful that private citizens begin to fear\nhim, and the magistrates to treat him with respect. But when he has\nadvanced thus far on the road to power without encountering opposition,\nhe has reached a point at which it is most dangerous to cope with him;\nit being dangerous, as I have before explained, to contend with a\ndisorder which has already made progress in a city. Nevertheless, when\nhe has brought things to this pass, you must either endeavour to crush\nhim, at the risk of immediate ruin, or else, unless death or some like\naccident interpose, you incur inevitable slavery by letting him alone.\nFor when, as I have said, it has come to this that the citizens and\neven the magistrates fear to offend him and his friends, little further\neffort will afterwards be needed to enable him to proscribe and ruin\nwhom he pleases.\n[4] Quod omnia mala exempla ex bonis initiis orta sunt. (Sall. Cat.\n51.)\nA republic ought, therefore, to provide by its ordinances that none of\nits citizens shall, under colour of doing good, have it in their power\nto do evil, but shall be suffered to acquire such influence only as may\naid and not injure freedom. How this may be done, shall presently be\nexplained.\nCHAPTER XLVII.\u2014_That though Men deceive themselves in Generalities, in\nParticulars they judge truly._\nThe commons of Rome having, as I have said, grown disgusted with the\nconsular name, and desiring either that men of plebeian birth should be\nadmitted to the office or its authority be restricted, the nobles, to\nprevent its degradation in either of these two ways, proposed a middle\ncourse, whereby four tribunes, who might either be plebeians or nobles,\nwere to be created with consular authority. This compromise satisfied\nthe commons, who thought they would thus get rid of the consulship, and\nsecure the highest offices of the State for their own order. But here a\ncircumstance happened worth noting. When the four tribunes came to be\nchosen, the people, who had it in their power to choose all from the\ncommons, chose all from the nobles. With respect to which election\nTitus Livius observes, that \u201c_the result showed that the people when\ndeclaring their honest judgment after controversy was over, were\ngoverned by a different spirit from that which had inspired them while\ncontending for their liberties and for a share in public honours_.\u201d The\nreason for this I believe to be, that men deceive themselves more\nreadily in generals than in particulars. To the commons of Rome it\nseemed, in the abstract, that they had every right to be admitted to\nthe consulship, since their party in the city was the more numerous,\nsince they bore the greater share of danger in their wars, and since it\nwas they who by their valour kept Rome free and made her powerful. And\nbecause it appeared to them, as I have said, that their desire was a\nreasonable one, they were resolved to satisfy it at all hazards. But\nwhen they had to form a particular judgment on the men of their own\nparty, they recognized their defects, and decided that individually no\none of them was deserving of what, collectively, they seemed entitled\nto; and being ashamed of them, turned to bestow their honours on those\nwho deserved them. Of which decision Titus Livius, speaking with due\nadmiration, says, \u201c_Where shall we now find in any one man, that\nmodesty, moderation, and magnanimity which were then common to the\nentire people?_\u201d\nAs confirming what I have said, I shall cite another noteworthy\nincident, which occurred in Capua after the rout of the Romans by\nHannibal at Cann\u00e6. For all Italy being convulsed by that defeat, Capua\ntoo was threatened with civil tumult, through the hatred which\nprevailed between her people and senate. But Pacuvius Calavius, who at\nthis time filled the office of chief magistrate, perceiving the danger,\ntook upon himself to reconcile the contending factions. With this\nobject he assembled the Senate and pointed out to them the hatred in\nwhich they were held by the people, and the risk they ran of being put\nto death by them, and of the city, now that the Romans were in\ndistress, being given up to Hannibal. But he added that, were they to\nconsent to leave the matter with him, he thought he could contrive to\nreconcile them; in the meanwhile, however, he must shut them up in the\npalace, that, by putting it in the power of the people to punish them,\nhe might secure their safety.\nThe senate consenting to this proposal, he shut them up in the palace,\nand summoning the people to a public meeting, told them the time had at\nlast come for them to trample on the insolence of the nobles, and\nrequite the wrongs suffered at their hands; for he had them all safe\nunder bolt and bar; but, as he supposed they did not wish the city to\nremain without rulers, it was fit, before putting the old senators to\ndeath, they should appoint others in their room. Wherefore he had\nthrown the names of all the old senators into a bag, and would now\nproceed to draw them out one by one, and as they were drawn would cause\nthem to be put to death, so soon as a successor was found for each.\nWhen the first name he drew was declared, there arose a great uproar\namong the people, all crying out against the cruelty, pride, and\narrogance of that senator whose name it was. But on Pacuvius desiring\nthem to propose a substitute, the meeting was quieted, and after a\nbrief pause one of the commons was nominated. No sooner, however, was\nhis name mentioned than one began to whistle, another to laugh, some\njeering at him in one way and some in another. And the same thing\nhappening in every case, each and all of those nominated were judged\nunworthy of senatorial rank. Whereupon Pacuvius, profiting by the\nopportunity, said, \u201cSince you are agreed that the city would be badly\noff without a senate, but are not agreed whom to appoint in the room of\nthe old senators, it will, perhaps, be well for you to be reconciled to\nthem; for the fear into which they have been thrown must have so\nsubdued them, that you are sure to find in them that affability which\nhitherto you have looked for in vain.\u201d This proposal being agreed to, a\nreconciliation followed between the two orders; the commons having seen\ntheir error so soon as they were obliged to come to particulars.\nA people therefore is apt to err in judging of things and their\naccidents in the abstract, but on becoming acquainted with particulars,\nspeedily discovers its mistakes. In the year 1494, when her greatest\ncitizens were banished from Florence, and no regular government any\nlonger existed there, but a spirit of licence prevailed, and matters\nwent continually from bad to worse, many Florentines perceiving the\ndecay of their city, and discerning no other cause for it, blamed the\nambition of this or the other powerful citizen, who, they thought, was\nfomenting these disorders with a view to establish a government to his\nown liking, and to rob them of their liberties. Those who thought thus,\nwould hang about the arcades and public squares, maligning many\ncitizens, and giving it to be understood that if ever they found\nthemselves in the Signory, they would expose the designs of these\ncitizens and have them punished. From time to time it happened that one\nor another of those who used this language rose to be of the chief\nmagistracy, and so soon as he obtained this advancement, and saw things\nnearer, became aware whence the disorders I have spoken of really came,\nthe dangers attending them, and the difficulty in dealing with them;\nand recognizing that they were the growth of the times, and not\noccasioned by particular men, suddenly altered his views and conduct; a\nnearer knowledge of facts freeing him from the false impressions he had\nbeen led into on a general view of affairs. But those who had heard him\nspeak as a private citizen, when they saw him remain inactive after he\nwas made a magistrate, believed that this arose not from his having\nobtained any better knowledge of things, but from his having been\ncajoled or corrupted by the great. And this happening with many men and\noften, it came to be a proverb among the people, that \u201c_men had one\nmind in the market-place, another in the palace._\u201d\nReflecting on what has been said, we see how quickly men\u2019s eyes may be\nopened, if knowing that they deceive themselves in generalities, we can\nfind a way to make them pass to particulars; as Pacuvius did in the\ncase of the Capuans, and the senate in the case of Rome. Nor do I\nbelieve that any prudent man need shrink from the judgment of the\npeople in questions relating to particulars, as, for instance, in the\ndistribution of honours and dignities. For in such matters only, the\npeople are either never mistaken, or at any rate far seldomer than a\nsmall number of persons would be, were the distribution entrusted to\nthem.\nIt seems to me, however, not out of place to notice in the following\nChapter, a method employed by the Roman senate to enlighten the people\nin making this distribution.\nCHAPTER XLVIII.\u2014_He who would not have an Office bestowed on some\nworthless or wicked Person, should contrive that it be solicited by one\nwho is utterly worthless and wicked, or else by one who is in the\nhighest degree noble and good._\nWhenever the senate saw a likelihood of the tribunes with consular\npowers being chosen exclusively from the commons, it took one or other\nof two ways,\u2014either by causing the office to be solicited by the most\ndistinguished among the citizens; or else, to confess the truth, by\nbribing some base and ignoble fellow to fasten himself on to those\nother plebeians of better quality who were seeking the office, and\nbecome a candidate conjointly with them. The latter device made the\npeople ashamed to give, the former ashamed to refuse.\nThis confirms what I said in my last Chapter, as to the people\ndeceiving themselves in generalities but not in particulars.\nCHAPTER XLIX.\u2014_That if Cities which, like Rome, had their beginning in\nFreedom, have had difficulty in framing such Laws as would preserve\ntheir Freedom, Cities which at the first have been in Subjection will\nfind this almost impossible._\nHow hard it is in founding a commonwealth to provide it with all the\nlaws needed to maintain its freedom, is well seen from the history of\nthe Roman Republic. For although ordinances were given it first by\nRomulus, then by Numa, afterwards by Tullus Hostilius and Servius, and\nlastly by the Ten created for the express purpose, nevertheless, in the\nactual government of Rome new needs were continually developed, to meet\nwhich, new ordinances had constantly to be devised; as in the creation\nof the censors, who were one of the chief means by which Rome was kept\nfree during the whole period of her constitutional government. For as\nthe censors became the arbiters of morals in Rome, it was very much\nowing to them that the progress of the Romans towards corruption was\nretarded. And though, at the first creation of the office, a mistake\nwas doubtless made in fixing its term at five years, this was corrected\nnot long after by the wisdom of the dictator Mamercus, who passed a law\nreducing it to eighteen months; a change which the censors then in\noffice took in such ill part, that they deprived Mamercus of his rank\nas a senator. This step was much blamed both by the commons and the\nFathers; still, as our History does not record that Mamercus obtained\nany redress, we must infer either that the Historian has omitted\nsomething, or that on this head the laws of Rome were defective; since\nit is never well that the laws of a commonwealth should suffer a\ncitizen to incur irremediable wrong because he promotes a measure\nfavourable to freedom.\nBut returning to the matter under consideration, we have, in connection\nwith the creation of this new office, to note, that if those cities\nwhich, as was the case with Rome, have had their beginning in freedom,\nand have by themselves maintained that freedom, have experienced great\ndifficulty in framing good laws for the preservation of their\nliberties, it is little to be wondered at that cities which at the\nfirst were dependent, should find it not difficult merely but\nimpossible so to shape their ordinances as to enable them to live free\nand undisturbed. This difficulty we see to have arisen in the case of\nFlorence, which, being subject at first to the power of Rome and\nsubsequently to that of other rulers, remained long in servitude,\ntaking no thought for herself; and even afterwards, when she could\nbreathe more freely and began to frame her own laws, these, since they\nwere blended with ancient ordinances which were bad, could not\nthemselves be good; and thus for the two hundred years of which we have\ntrustworthy record, our city has gone on patching her institutions,\nwithout ever possessing a government in respect of which she could\ntruly be termed a commonwealth.\nThe difficulties which have been felt in Florence are the same as have\nbeen felt in all cities which have had a like origin; and although,\nrepeatedly, by the free and public votes of her citizens, ample\nauthority has been given to a few of their number to reform her\nconstitution, no alteration of general utility has ever been\nintroduced, but only such as forwarded the interests of the party to\nwhich those commissioned to make changes belonged. This, instead of\norder, has occasioned the greatest disorder in our city.\nBut to come to particulars, I say, that among other matters which have\nto be considered by the founder of a commonwealth, is the question into\nwhose hands should be committed the power of life and death over its\ncitizens\u2019 This was well seen to in Rome, where, as a rule, there was a\nright of appeal to the people, but where, on any urgent case arising in\nwhich it might have been dangerous to delay the execution of a judicial\nsentence, recourse could be had to a dictator with powers to execute\njustice at once; a remedy, however, never resorted to save in cases of\nextremity. But Florence, and other cities having a like origin,\ncommitted this power into the hands of a foreigner, whom they styled\nCaptain, and as he was open to be corrupted by powerful citizens this\nwas a pernicious course. Altering this arrangement afterwards in\nconsequence of changes in their government, they appointed eight\ncitizens to discharge the office of Captain. But this, for a reason\nalready mentioned, namely that a few will always be governed by the\nwill of a few and these the most powerful, was a change from bad to\nworse.\nThe city of Venice has guarded herself against a like danger. For in\nVenice ten citizens are appointed with power to punish any man without\nappeal; and because, although possessing the requisite authority, this\nnumber might not be sufficient to insure the punishment of the\npowerful, in addition to their council of Ten, they have also\nconstituted a council of Forty, and have further provided that the\ncouncil of the \u201c_Pregai_,\u201d which is their supreme council, shall have\nauthority to chastise powerful offenders. So that, unless an accuser be\nwanting, a tribunal is never wanting in Venice to keep powerful\ncitizens in check.\nBut when we see how in Rome, with ordinances of her own imposing, and\nwith so many and so wise legislators, fresh occasion arose from day to\nday for framing new laws favourable to freedom, it is not to be\nwondered at that, in other cities less happy in their beginnings,\ndifficulties should have sprung up which no ordinances could remedy.\nCHAPTER L.\u2014_That neither any Council nor any Magistrate should have\npower to bring the Government of a City to a stay._\nT.Q. CINCINNATUS and Cn. Julius Mento being consuls of Rome, and being\nat variance with one another, brought the whole business of the city to\na stay; which the senate perceiving, were moved to create a dictator to\ndo what, by reason of their differences, the consuls would not. But\nthough opposed to one another in everything else, the consuls were of\none mind in resisting the appointment of a dictator; so that the senate\nhad no remedy left them but to seek the help of the tribunes, who,\nsupported by their authority, forced the consuls to yield.\nHere we have to note, first, the usefulness of the tribunes\u2019 authority\nin checking the ambitious designs, not only of the nobles against the\ncommons, but also of one section of the nobles against another; and\nnext, that in no city ought things ever to be so ordered that it rests\nwith a few to decide on matters, which, if the ordinary business of the\nState is to proceed at all, must be carried out. Wherefore, if you\ngrant authority to a council to distribute honours and offices, or to a\nmagistrate to administer any branch of public business, you must either\nimpose an obligation that the duty confided shall be performed, or\nordain that, on failure to perform, another may and shall do what has\nto be done. Otherwise such an arrangement will be found defective and\ndangerous; as would have been the case in Rome, had it not been\npossible to oppose the authority of the tribunes to the obstinacy of\nthe consuls.\nIn the Venetian Republic, the great council distributes honours and\noffices. But more than once it has happened that the council, whether\nfrom ill-humour or from being badly advised, has declined to appoint\nsuccessors either to the magistrates of the city or to those\nadministering the government abroad. This gave rise to the greatest\nconfusion and disorder; for, on a sudden, both the city itself and the\nsubject provinces found themselves deprived of their lawful governors;\nnor could any redress be had until the majority of the council were\npacified or undeceived. And this disorder must have brought the city to\na bad end, had not provision been made against its recurrence by\ncertain of the wiser citizens, who, finding a fit opportunity, passed a\nlaw that no magistracy, whether within or without the city, should ever\nbe deemed to have been vacated until it was filled up by the\nappointment of a successor. In this way the council was deprived of its\nfacilities for stopping public business to the danger of the State.\nCHAPTER LI.\u2014_What a Prince or Republic does of Necessity, should seem\nto be done by Choice_.\nIn all their actions, even in those which are matters of necessity\nrather than choice, prudent men will endeavour so to conduct themselves\nas to conciliate good-will. This species of prudence was well exercised\nby the Roman senate when they resolved to grant pay from the public\npurse to soldiers on active service, who, before, had served at their\nown charges. For perceiving that under the old system they could\nmaintain no war of any duration, and, consequently, could not undertake\na siege or lead an army to any distance from home, and finding it\nnecessary to be able to do both, they decided on granting the pay I\nhave spoken of. But this, which they could not help doing, they did in\nsuch a way as to earn the thanks of the people, by whom the concession\nwas so well received that all Rome was intoxicated with delight. For it\nseemed to them a boon beyond any they could have ventured to hope for,\nor have dreamed of demanding. And although the tribunes sought to make\nlight of the benefit, by showing the people that their burthens would\nbe increased rather than diminished by it, since taxes would have to be\nimposed out of which the soldier\u2019s stipend might be paid, they could\nnot persuade them to regard the measure otherwise than with gratitude;\nwhich was further increased by the manner in which the senate\ndistributed the taxes, imposing on the nobles all the heavier and\ngreater, and those which had to be paid first.\nCHAPTER LII.\u2014_That to check the arrogance of a Citizen who is growing\ntoo powerful in a State, there is no safer Method, or less open to\nobjection, than to forestall him in those Ways whereby he seeks to\nadvance himself_.\nIt has been seen in the preceding chapter how much credit the nobles\ngained with the commons by a show of good-will towards them, not only\nin providing for their military pay, but also in adjusting taxation.\nHad the senate constantly adhered to methods like these, they would\nhave put an end to all disturbances in Rome, and have deprived the\ntribunes of the credit they had with the people, and of the influence\nthence arising. For in truth, in a commonwealth, and especially in one\nwhich has become corrupted, there is no better, or easier, or less\nobjectionable way of opposing the ambition of any citizen, than to\nanticipate him in those paths by which he is seen to be advancing to\nthe ends he has in view. This plan, had it been followed by the enemies\nof Cosimo de\u2019 Medici, would have proved a far more useful course for\nthem than to banish him from Florence; since if those citizens who\nopposed him had adopted his methods for gaining over the people, they\nwould have succeeded, without violence or tumult, in taking his most\neffective weapon from his hands.\nThe influence acquired in Florence by Piero Soderini was entirely due\nto his skill in securing the affections of the people, since in this\nway he obtained among them a name for loving the liberties of the\ncommonwealth. And truly, for those citizens who envied his greatness it\nwould have been both easier and more honourable, and at the same time\nfar less dangerous and hurtful to the State, to forestall him in those\nmeasures by which he was growing powerful, than to oppose him in such a\nmanner that his overthrow must bring with it the ruin of the entire\nrepublic. For had they, as they might easily have done, deprived him of\nthe weapons which made him formidable, they could then have withstood\nhim in all the councils, and in all public deliberations, without\neither being suspected or feared. And should any rejoin that, if the\ncitizens who hated Piero Soderini committed an error in not being\nbeforehand with him in those ways whereby he came to have influence\nwith the people, Piero himself erred in like manner, in not\nanticipating his enemies in those methods whereby they grew formidable\nto him; I answer that Piero is to be excused, both because it would\nhave been difficult for him to have so acted, and because for him such\na course would not have been honourable. For the paths wherein his\ndanger lay were those which favoured the Medici, and it was by these\nthat his enemies attacked him, and in the end overthrew him. But these\npaths Piero could not pursue without dishonour, since he could not, if\nhe was to preserve his fair fame, have joined in destroying that\nliberty which he had been put forward to defend. Moreover, since\nfavours to the Medicean party could not have been rendered secretly and\nonce for all, they would have been most dangerous for Piero, who, had\nhe shown himself friendly to the Medici, must have become suspected and\nhated by the people; in which case his enemies would have had still\nbetter opportunities than before for his destruction.\nMen ought therefore to look to the risks and dangers of any course\nwhich lies before them, nor engage in it when it is plain that the\ndangers outweigh the advantages, even though they be advised by others\nthat it is the most expedient way to take. Should they act otherwise,\nit will fare with them as with Tullius, who, in seeking to diminish the\npower of Marcus Antonius, added to it. For Antonius, who had been\ndeclared an enemy by the senate, having got together a strong force,\nmostly made up of veterans who had shared the fortunes of C\u00e6sar,\nTullius counselled the senate to invest Octavianus with full authority,\nand to send him against Antonius with the consuls and the army;\naffirming, that so soon as those veterans who had served with C\u00e6sar saw\nthe face of him who was C\u00e6sar\u2019s nephew and had assumed his name, they\nwould rally to his side and desert Antonius, who might easily be\ncrushed when thus left bare of support.\nBut the reverse of all this happened. For Antonius persuaded Octavianus\nto take part with him, and to throw over Tullius and the senate. And\nthis brought about the ruin of the senate, a result which might easily\nhave been foreseen. For remembering the influence of that great\ncaptain, who, after overthrowing all opponents, had seized on sovereign\npower in Rome, the senate should have turned a deaf ear to the\npersuasions of Tullius, nor ever have believed it possible that from\nC\u00e6sar\u2019s heir, or from soldiers who had followed C\u00e6sar, they could look\nfor anything that consisted with the name of Freedom.\nCHAPTER LIII.\u2014_That the People, deceived by a false show of Advantage,\noften desire what would be their Ruin; and that large Hopes and brave\nPromises easily move them_.\nWhen Veii fell, the commons of Rome took up the notion that it would be\nto the advantage of their city were half their number to go and dwell\nthere. For they argued that as Veii lay in a fertile country and was a\nwell-built city, a moiety of the Roman people might in this way be\nenriched; while, by reason of its vicinity to Rome, the management of\ncivil affairs would in no degree be affected. To the senate, however,\nand the wiser among the citizens, the scheme appeared so rash and\nmischievous that they publicly declared they would die sooner than\nconsent to it. The controversy continuing, the commons grew so inflamed\nagainst the senate that violence and bloodshed must have ensued; had\nnot the senate for their protection put forward certain old and\nesteemed citizens, respect for whom restrained the populace and put a\nstop to their violence.\nTwo points are here to be noted. First, that a people deceived by a\nfalse show of advantage will often labour for its own destruction; and,\nunless convinced by some one whom it trusts, that the course on which\nit is bent is pernicious, and that some other is to be preferred, will\nbring infinite danger and injury upon the State. And should it so\nhappen, as sometimes is the case, that from having been deceived\nbefore, either by men or by events, there is none in whom the people\ntrust, their ruin is inevitable. As to which Dante, in his treatise \u201cDe\nMonarchia,\u201d observes that the people will often raise the cry,\n\u201c_Flourish our death and perish our life_.\u201d[5] From which distrust it\narises that often in republics the right course is not followed; as\nwhen Venice, as has been related, on being attacked by many enemies,\ncould not, until her ruin was complete, resolve to make friends with\nany one of them by restoring those territories she had taken from them,\non account of which war had been declared and a league of princes\nformed against her.\n[5] \u201cViva la sua morte e muoia la sua vita.\u201d The quotation does _not_\nseem to be from the \u201cDe Monarchia.\u201d\nIn considering what courses it is easy, and what it is difficult to\npersuade a people to follow, this distinction may be drawn: Either what\nyou would persuade them to, presents on the face of it a semblance of\ngain or loss, or it seems a spirited course or a base one. When any\nproposal submitted to the people holds out promise of advantage, or\nseems to them a spirited course to take, though loss lie hid behind,\nnay, though the ruin of their country be involved in it, they will\nalways be easily led to adopt it; whereas it will always be difficult\nto persuade the adoption of such courses as wear the appearance of\ndisgrace or loss, even though safety and advantage be bound up with\nthem. The truth of what I say is confirmed by numberless examples both\nRoman and foreign, modern and ancient. Hence grew the ill opinion\nentertained in Rome of Fabius Maximus, who could never persuade the\npeople that it behoved them to proceed warily in their conflict with\nHannibal, and withstand his onset without fighting. For this the people\nthought a base course, not discerning the advantage resulting from it,\nwhich Fabius could by no argument make plain to them. And so blinded\nare men in favour of what seems a spirited course, that although the\nRomans had already committed the blunder of permitting Varro, master of\nthe knights to Fabius, to join battle contrary to the latter\u2019s desire,\nwhereby the army must have been destroyed had not Fabius by his\nprudence saved it, this lesson was not enough; for afterwards they\nappointed this Varro to be consul, for no other reason than that he\ngave out, in the streets and market-places, that he would make an end\nof Hannibal as soon as leave was given him to do so. Whence came the\nbattle and defeat of Cann\u00e6, and well-nigh the destruction of Rome.\nAnother example taken from Roman history may be cited to the same\neffect. After Hannibal had maintained himself for eight or ten years in\nItaly, during which time the whole country had been deluged with Roman\nblood, a certain Marcus Centenius Penula, a man of mean origin, but who\nhad held some post in the army, came forward and proposed to the senate\nthat were leave given him to raise a force of volunteers in any part of\nItaly he pleased, he would speedily deliver Hannibal into their hands,\nalive or dead. To the senate this man\u2019s offer seemed a rash one; but\nreflecting that were they to refuse it, and were the people afterwards\nto hear that it had been made, tumults, ill will, and resentment\nagainst them would result, they granted the permission asked; choosing\nrather to risk the lives of all who might follow Penula, than to excite\nfresh discontent on the part of the people, to whom they knew that such\na proposal would be welcome, and that it would be very hard to dissuade\nthem from it. And so this adventurer, marching forth with an\nundisciplined and disorderly rabble to meet Hannibal, was, with all his\nfollowers, defeated and slain in the very first encounter.\nIn Greece, likewise, and in the city of Athens, that most grave and\nprudent statesman, Nicias, could not convince the people that the\nproposal to go and attack Sicily was disadvantageous; and the\nexpedition being resolved on, contrary to his advice and to the wishes\nof the wiser among the citizens, resulted in the overthrow of the\nAthenian power. Scipio, on being appointed consul, asked that the\nprovince of Africa might be awarded to him, promising that he would\nutterly efface Carthage; and when the senate, on the advice of Fabius,\nrefused his request, he threatened to submit the matter to the people\nas very well knowing that to the people such proposals are always\nacceptable.\nI might cite other instances to the same effect from the history of our\nown city, as when Messer Ercole Bentivoglio and Antonio Giacomini,\nbeing in joint command of the Florentine armies, after defeating\nBartolommeo d\u2019Alviano at San Vincenzo, proceeded to invest Pisa. For\nthis enterprise was resolved on by the people in consequence of the\nbrave promises of Messer Ercole; and though many wise citizens\ndisapproved of it, they could do nothing to prevent it, being carried\naway by the popular will, which took its rise in the assurances of\ntheir captain.\nI say, then, that there is no readier way to bring about the ruin of a\nrepublic, when the power is in the hands of the people, than to suggest\ndaring courses for their adoption. For wherever the people have a\nvoice, such proposals will always be well received, nor will those\npersons who are opposed to them be able to apply any remedy. And as\nthis occasions the ruin of States, it likewise, and even more\nfrequently, occasions the private ruin of those to whom the execution\nof these proposals is committed; because the people anticipating\nvictory, do not when there comes defeat ascribe it to the short means\nor ill fortune of the commander, but to his cowardice and incapacity;\nand commonly either put him to death, or imprison or banish him; as was\ndone in the case of numberless Carthaginian generals and of many\nAthenian, no successes they might previously have obtained availing\nthem anything; for all past services are cancelled by a present loss.\nAnd so it happened with our Antonio Giacomini, who not succeeding as\nthe people had expected, and as he had promised, in taking Pisa, fell\ninto such discredit with the people, that notwithstanding his countless\npast services, his life was spared rather by the compassion of those in\nauthority than through any movement of the citizens in his behalf.\nCHAPTER LIV.\u2014_Of the boundless Authority which a great Man may use to\nrestrain an excited Multitude_.\nThe next noteworthy point in the passage referred to in the foregoing\nChapter is, that nothing tends so much to restrain an excited multitude\nas the reverence felt for some grave person, clothed with authority,\nwho stands forward to oppose them. For not without reason has Virgil\nsaid\u2014\n\u201cIf then, by chance, some reverend chief appear,\nKnown for his deeds and for his virtues dear,\nSilent they wait his words and bend a listening ear.\u201d[6]\n[6] Tum pietate gravem ac meritis si forte virum quem\nConspexere, silent, arrectisque auribus adstant.\n_Virg. Aen._, I. 154.\nHe therefore who commands an army or governs a city wherein tumult\nshall have broken out, ought to assume the noblest and bravest bearing\nhe can, and clothe himself with all the ensigns of his station, that he\nmay make himself more revered. It is not many years since Florence was\ndivided into two factions, the _Frateschi_ and _Arrabbiati_, as they\nwere named, and these coming to open violence, the _Frateschi_, among\nwhom was Pagolo Antonio Soderini, a citizen of great reputation in\nthese days, were worsted. In the course of these disturbances the\npeople coming with arms in their hands to plunder the house of\nSoderini, his brother Messer Francesco, then bishop of Volterra and now\ncardinal, who happened to be dwelling there, so soon as he heard the\nuproar and saw the crowd, putting on his best apparel and over it his\nepiscopal robes, went forth to meet the armed multitude, and by his\nwords and mien brought them to a stay; and for many days his behaviour\nwas commended by the whole city. The inference from all which is, that\nthere is no surer or more necessary restraint on the violence of an\nunruly multitude, than the presence of some one whose character and\nbearing command respect.\nBut to return once more to the passage we are considering, we see how\nstubbornly the people clung to this scheme of transplanting themselves\nto Veii, thinking it for their advantage, and not discerning the\nmischief really involved in it; so that in addition to the many\ndissensions which it occasioned, actual violence must have followed,\nhad not the senate with the aid of certain grave and reverend citizens\nrepressed the popular fury.\nCHAPTER LV.\u2014_That Government is easily carried on in a City wherein the\nbody of the People is not corrupted: and that a Princedom is impossible\nwhere Equality prevails, and a Republic where it does not_.\nThough what we have to fear or hope from cities that have grown\ncorrupted has already been discussed, still I think it not out of place\nto notice a resolution passed by the senate touching the vow which\nCamillus made to Apollo of a tenth of the spoil taken from the\nVeientines. For this spoil having fallen into the hands of the people,\nthe senate, being unable by other means to get any account of it,\npassed an edict that every man should publicly offer one tenth part of\nwhat he had taken. And although this edict was not carried out, from\nthe senate having afterwards followed a different course, whereby, to\nthe content of the people, the claim of Apollo was otherwise satisfied,\nwe nevertheless see from their having entertained such a proposal, how\ncompletely the senate trusted to the honesty of the people, when they\nassumed that no one would withhold any part of what the edict commanded\nhim to give; on the other hand, we see that it never occurred to the\npeople that they might evade the law by giving less than was due, their\nonly thought being to free themselves from the law by openly\nmanifesting their displeasure. This example, together with many others\nalready noticed, shows how much virtue and how profound a feeling of\nreligion prevailed among the Roman people, and how much good was to be\nexpected from them. And, in truth, in the country where virtue like\nthis does not exist, no good can be looked for, as we should look for\nit in vain in provinces which at the present day are seen to be\ncorrupted; as Italy is beyond all others, though, in some degree,\nFrance and Spain are similarly tainted. In which last two countries, if\nwe see not so many disorders spring up as we see daily springing up in\nItaly, this is not so much due to the superior virtue of their\ninhabitants (who, to say truth, fall far short of our countrymen), as\nto their being governed by a king who keeps them united, not merely by\nhis personal qualities, but also by the laws and ordinances of the\nrealm which are still maintained with vigour. In Germany, however, we\ndo see signal excellence and a devout religious spirit prevail among\nthe people, giving rise to the many free States which there maintain\nthemselves, with such strict observance of their laws that none, either\nwithin or without their walls, dare encroach on them.\nThat among this last-named people a great share of the ancient\nexcellence does in truth still flourish, I shall show by an example\nsimilar to that which I have above related of the senate and people of\nRome. It is customary with the German Free States when they have to\nexpend any large sum of money on the public account, for their\nmagistrates or councils having authority given them in that behalf, to\nimpose a rate of one or two in the hundred on every man\u2019s estate; which\nrate being fixed, every man, in conformity with the laws of the city,\npresents himself before the collectors of the impost, and having first\nmade oath to pay the amount justly due, throws into a chest provided\nfor the purpose what he conscientiously believes it fair for him to\npay, of which payment none is witness save himself. From this fact it\nmay be gathered what honesty and religion still prevail among this\npeople. For we must assume that each pays his just share, since\notherwise the impost would not yield the sum which, with reference to\nformer imposts, it was estimated to yield; whereby the fraud would be\ndetected, and thereupon some other method for raising money have to be\nresorted to.\nAt the present time this virtue is the more to be admired, because it\nseems to have survived in this province only. That it has survived\nthere may be ascribed to two circumstances: _first_, that the natives\nhave little communication with their neighbours, neither visiting them\nin their countries nor being visited by them; being content to use such\ncommodities, and subsist on such food, and to wear garments of such\nmaterials as their own land supplies; so that all occasion for\nintercourse, and every cause of corruption is removed. For living after\nthis fashion, they have not learned the manners of the French, the\nItalians, or the Spaniards, which three nations together are the\ncorruption of the world. The _second_ cause is, that these republics in\nwhich a free and pure government is maintained will not suffer any of\ntheir citizens either to be, or to live as gentlemen; but on the\ncontrary, while preserving a strict equality among themselves, are\nbitterly hostile to all those gentlemen and lords who dwell in their\nneighbourhood; so that if by chance any of these fall into their hands,\nthey put them to death, as the chief promoters of corruption and the\norigin of all disorders.\nBut to make plain what I mean when I speak of _gentlemen_, I say that\nthose are so to be styled who live in opulence and idleness on the\nrevenues of their estates, without concerning themselves with the\ncultivation of these estates, or incurring any other fatigue for their\nsupport. Such persons are very mischievous in every republic or\ncountry. But even more mischievous are they who, besides the estates I\nhave spoken of, are lords of strongholds and castles, and have vassals\nand retainers who render them obedience. Of these two classes of men\nthe kingdom of Naples, the country round Rome, Romagna, and Lombardy\nare full; and hence it happens that in these provinces no commonwealth\nor free form of government has ever existed; because men of this sort\nare the sworn foes to all free institutions.\nAnd since to plant a commonwealth in provinces which are in this\ncondition were impossible, if these are to be reformed at all, it can\nonly be by some one man who is able there to establish a kingdom; the\nreason being that when the body of the people is grown so corrupted\nthat the laws are powerless to control it, there must in addition to\nthe laws be introduced a stronger force, to wit, the regal, which by\nits absolute and unrestricted authority may curb the excessive ambition\nand corruption of the great. This opinion may be supported by the\nexample of Tuscany, in which within a narrow compass of territory there\nhave long existed the three republics of Florence, Lucca, and Siena,\nwhile the other cities of that province, although to a certain extent\ndependent, still show by their spirit and by their institutions that\nthey preserve, or at any rate desire to preserve, their freedom: and\nthis because there are in Tuscany no lords possessed of strongholds,\nand few or no gentlemen, but so complete an equality prevails, that a\nprudent statesman, well acquainted with the history of the free States\nof antiquity, might easily introduce free institutions. Such, however,\nhas been the unhappiness of this our country, that, up to the present\nhour, it has never produced any man with the power and knowledge which\nwould have enabled him to act in this way.\nFrom what has been said, it follows, that he who would found a\ncommonwealth in a country wherein there are many gentlemen, cannot do\nso unless he first gets rid of them; and that he who would found a\nmonarchy or princedom in a country wherein great equality prevails,\nwill never succeed, unless he raise above the level of that equality\nmany persons of a restless and ambitious temperament, whom he must make\ngentlemen not in name merely but in reality, by conferring on them\ncastles and lands, supplying them with riches, and providing them with\nretainers; that with these gentlemen around him, and with their help,\nhe may maintain his power, while they through him may gratify their\nambition; all others being constrained to endure a yoke, which force\nand force alone imposes on them. For when in this way there comes to be\na proportion between him who uses force and him against whom it is\nused, each stands fixed in his own station.\nBut to found a commonwealth in a country suited for a kingdom, or a\nkingdom in a country suited to be a commonwealth, requires so rare a\ncombination of intelligence and power, that though many engage in the\nattempt, few are found to succeed. For the greatness of the undertaking\nquickly daunts them, and so obstructs their advance they break down at\nthe very outset. The case of the Venetian Republic, wherein none save\ngentlemen are permitted to hold any public office, does, doubtless,\nseem opposed to this opinion of mine that where there are gentlemen it\nis impossible to found a commonwealth. But it may be answered that the\ncase of Venice is not in truth an instance to the contrary; since the\ngentlemen of Venice are gentlemen rather in name than in reality,\ninasmuch as they draw no great revenues from lands, their wealth\nconsisting chiefly in merchandise and chattels, and not one of them\npossessing a castle or enjoying any feudal authority. For in Venice\nthis name of gentleman is a title of honour and dignity, and does not\ndepend on any of those circumstances in respect of which the name is\ngiven in other States. But as in other States the different ranks and\nclasses are divided under different names, so in Venice we have the\ndivision into gentlemen (_gentiluomini_) and plebeians (_popolani_), it\nbeing understood that the former hold, or have the right to hold all\nsituations of honour, from which the latter are entirely excluded. And\nin Venice this occasions no disturbance, for reasons which I have\nalready explained.\nLet a commonwealth, then, be constituted in the country where a great\nequality is found or has been made; and, conversely, let a princedom be\nconstituted where great inequality prevails. Otherwise what is\nconstituted will be discordant in itself, and without stability.\nCHAPTER LVI.\u2014_That when great Calamities are about to befall a City or\nCountry, Signs are seen to presage, and Seers arise who foretell them_.\nWhence it happens I know not, but it is seen from examples both ancient\nand recent, that no grave calamity has ever befallen any city or\ncountry which has not been foretold by vision, by augury, by portent,\nor by some other Heaven-sent sign. And not to travel too far afield for\nevidence of this, every one knows that long before the invasion of\nItaly by Charles VIII. of France, his coming was foretold by the friar\nGirolamo Savonarola; and how, throughout the whole of Tuscany, the\nrumour ran that over Arezzo horsemen had been seen fighting in the air.\nAnd who is there who has not heard that before the death of the elder\nLorenzo de\u2019 Medici, the highest pinnacle of the cathedral was rent by a\nthunderbolt, to the great injury of the building? Or who, again, but\nknows that shortly before Piero Soderini, whom the people of Florence\nhad made gonfalonier for life, was deprived of his office and banished,\nthe palace itself was struck by lightning?\nOther instances might be cited, which, not to be tedious, I shall omit,\nand mention only a circumstance which Titus Livius tells us preceded\nthe invasion of the Gauls. For he relates how a certain plebeian named\nMarcus Ceditius reported to the senate that as he passed by night along\nthe Via Nova, he heard a voice louder than mortal, bidding him warn the\nmagistrates that the Gauls were on their way to Rome.\nThe causes of such manifestations ought, I think, to be inquired into\nand explained by some one who has a knowledge, which I have not, of\ncauses natural and supernatural. It may, however, be, as certain wise\nmen say, that the air is filled with intelligent beings, to whom it is\ngiven to forecast future events; who, taking pity upon men, warn them\nbeforehand by these signs to prepare for what awaits them. Be this as\nit may, certain it is that such warnings are given, and that always\nafter them new and strange disasters befall nations.\nCHAPTER LVII.\u2014_That the People are strong collectively, but\nindividually weak_.\nAfter the ruin brought on their country by the invasion of the Gauls,\nmany of the Romans went to dwell in Veii, in opposition to the edicts\nand commands of the senate, who, to correct this mischief, publicly\nordained that within a time fixed, and under penalties stated, all\nshould return to live in Rome. The persons against whom these\nproclamations were directed at first derided them; but, when the time\ncame for them to be obeyed, all obeyed them. And Titus Livius observes\nthat, \u201c_although bold enough collectively, each separately, fearing to\nbe punished, made his submission_.\u201d And indeed the temper of the\nmultitude in such cases, cannot be better described than in this\npassage. For often a people will be open-mouthed in condemning the\ndecrees of their prince, but afterwards, when they have to look\npunishment in the face, putting no trust in one another, they hasten to\ncomply. Wherefore, if you be in a position to keep the people\nwell-disposed towards you when they already are so, or to prevent them\ninjuring you in case they be ill-disposed, it is clearly of little\nmoment whether the feelings with which they profess to regard you, be\nfavourable or no. This applies to all unfriendliness on the part of a\npeople, whencesoever it proceed, excepting only the resentment felt by\nthem on being deprived either of liberty, or of a prince whom they love\nand who still survives. For the hostile temper produced by these two\ncauses is more to be feared than any beside, and demands measures of\nextreme severity to correct it. The other untoward humours of the\nmultitude, should there be no powerful chief to foster them, are easily\ndealt with; because, while on the one hand there is nothing more\nterrible than an uncontrolled and headless mob, on the other, there is\nnothing feebler. For though it be furnished with arms it is easily\nsubdued, if you have some place of strength wherein to shelter from its\nfirst onset. For when its first fury has somewhat abated, and each man\nsees that he has to return to his own house, all begin to lose heart\nand to take thought how to insure their personal safety, whether by\nflight or by submission. For which reason a multitude stirred in this\nway, if it would avoid dangers such as I speak of, must at once appoint\na head from among its own numbers, who may control it, keep it united,\nand provide for its defence; as did the commons of Rome when, after the\ndeath of Virginia, they quitted the city, and for their protection\ncreated twenty tribunes from among themselves. Unless this be done,\nwhat Titus Livius has observed in the passage cited, will always prove\ntrue, namely, that a multitude is strong while it holds together, but\nso soon as each of those who compose it begins to think of his own\nprivate danger, it becomes weak and contemptible.\nCHAPTER LVIII.\u2014_That a People is wiser and more constant than a Prince_\nThat \u201c_nothing is more fickle and inconstant than the multitude_\u201d is\naffirmed not by Titus Livius only, but by all other historians, in\nwhose chronicles of human actions we often find the multitude\ncondemning some citizen to death, and afterwards lamenting him and\ngrieving greatly for his loss, as the Romans grieved and lamented for\nManlius Capitolinus, whom they had themselves condemned to die. In\nrelating which circumstance our author observes \u201c_In a short time the\npeople, having no longer cause to fear him, began to deplore his\ndeath_\u201d And elsewhere, when speaking of what took place in Syracuse\nafter the murder of Hieronymus, grandson of Hiero, he says, \u201c_It is the\nnature of the multitude to be an abject slave, or a domineering\nmaster_\u201d\nIt may be that in attempting to defend a cause, which, as I have said,\nall writers are agreed to condemn, I take upon me a task so hard and\ndifficult that I shall either have to relinquish it with shame or\npursue it with opprobrium. Be that as it may, I neither do, nor ever\nshall judge it a fault, to support opinion by arguments, where it is\nnot sought to impose them by violence or authority I maintain, then,\nthat this infirmity with which historians tax the multitude, may with\nequal reason be charged against every individual man, but most of all\nagainst princes, since all who are not controlled by the laws, will\ncommit the very same faults as are committed by an uncontrolled\nmultitude. Proof whereof were easy, since of all the many princes\nexisting, or who have existed, few indeed are or have been either wise\nor good.\nI speak of such princes as have had it in their power to break the\nreins by which they are controlled, among whom I do not reckon those\nkings who reigned in Egypt in the most remote antiquity when that\ncountry was governed in conformity with its laws; nor do I include\nthose kings who reigned in Sparta, nor those who in our own times reign\nin France, which kingdom, more than any other whereof we have knowledge\nat the present day, is under the government of its laws. For kings who\nlive, as these do, subject to constitutional restraint, are not to be\ncounted when we have to consider each man\u2019s proper nature, and to see\nwhether he resembles the multitude. For to draw a comparison with such\nprinces as these, we must take the case of a multitude controlled as\nthey are, and regulated by the laws, when we shall find it to possess\nthe same virtues which we see in them, and neither conducting itself as\nan abject slave nor as a domineering master.\nSuch was the people of Rome, who, while the commonwealth continued\nuncorrupted, never either served abjectly nor domineered haughtily;\nbut, on the contrary, by means of their magistrates and their\nordinances, maintained their place, and when forced to put forth their\nstrength against some powerful citizen, as in the case of Manlius, the\ndecemvirs, and others who sought to oppress them, did so; but when it\nwas necessary for the public welfare to yield obedience to the dictator\nor consuls, obeyed. And if the Roman people mourned the loss of the\ndead Manlius, it is no wonder; for they mourned his virtues, which had\nbeen of such a sort that their memory stirred the regret of all, and\nwould have had power to produce the same feelings even in a prince; all\nwriters being agreed that excellence is praised and admired even by its\nenemies. But if Manlius when he was so greatly mourned, could have\nrisen once more from the dead, the Roman people would have pronounced\nthe same sentence against him which they pronounced when they led him\nforth from the prison-house, and straightway condemned him to die. And\nin like manner we see that princes, accounted wise, have put men to\ndeath, and afterwards greatly lamented them, as Alexander mourned for\nClitus and others of his friends, and Herod for Mariamne.\nBut what our historian says of the multitude, he says not of a\nmultitude which like the people of Rome is controlled by the laws, but\nof an uncontrolled multitude like the Syracusans, who were guilty of\nall these crimes which infuriated and ungoverned men commit, and which\nwere equally committed by Alexander and Herod in the cases mentioned.\nWherefore the nature of a multitude is no more to be blamed than the\nnature of princes, since both equally err when they can do so without\nregard to consequences. Of which many instances, besides those already\ngiven, might be cited from the history of the Roman emperors, and of\nother princes and tyrants, in whose lives we find such inconstancy and\nfickleness, as we might look in vain for in a people.\nI maintain, therefore, contrary to the common opinion which avers that\na people when they have the management of affairs are changeable,\nfickle, and ungrateful, that these faults exist not in them otherwise\nthan as they exist in individual princes; so that were any to accuse\nboth princes and peoples, the charge might be true, but that to make\nexception in favour of princes is a mistake; for a people in command,\nif it be duly restrained, will have the same prudence and the same\ngratitude as a prince has, or even more, however wise he may be\nreckoned; and a prince on the other hand, if freed from the control of\nthe laws, will be more ungrateful, fickle, and short-sighted than a\npeople. And further, I say that any difference in their methods of\nacting results not from any difference in their nature, that being the\nsame in both, or, if there be advantage on either side, the advantage\nresting with the people, but from their having more or less respect for\nthe laws under which each lives. And whosoever attentively considers\nthe history of the Roman people, may see that for four hundred years\nthey never relaxed in their hatred of the regal name, and were\nconstantly devoted to the glory and welfare of their country, and will\nfind numberless proofs given by them of their consistency in both\nparticulars. And should any allege against me the ingratitude they\nshowed to Scipio, I reply by what has already been said at length on\nthat head, where I proved that peoples are less ungrateful than\nprinces. But as for prudence and stability of purpose, I affirm that a\npeople is more prudent, more stable, and of better judgment than a\nprince. Nor is it without reason that the voice of the people has been\nlikened to the voice of God; for we see that wide-spread beliefs fulfil\nthemselves, and bring about marvellous results, so as to have the\nappearance of presaging by some occult quality either weal or woe.\nAgain, as to the justice of their opinions on public affairs, seldom\nfind that after hearing two speakers of equal ability urging them in\nopposite directions, they do not adopt the sounder view, or are unable\nto decide on the truth of what they hear. And if, as I have said, a\npeople errs in adopting courses which appear to it bold and\nadvantageous, princes will likewise err when their passions are\ntouched, as is far oftener the case with them than with a people.\nWe see, too, that in the choice of magistrates a people will choose far\nmore honestly than a prince; so that while you shall never persuade a\npeople that it is advantageous to confer dignities on the infamous and\nprofligate, a prince may readily, and in a thousand ways, be drawn to\ndo so. Again, it may be seen that a people, when once they have come to\nhold a thing in abhorrence, remain for many ages of the same mind;\nwhich we do not find happen with princes. For the truth of both of\nwhich assertions the Roman people are my sufficient witness, who, in\nthe course of so many hundred years, and in so many elections of\nconsuls and tribunes, never made four appointments of which they had\nreason to repent; and, as I have said, so detested the name of king,\nthat no obligation they might be under to any citizen who affected that\nname, could shield him from the appointed penalty.\nFurther, we find that those cities wherein the government is in the\nhands of the people, in a very short space of time, make marvellous\nprogress, far exceeding that made by cities which have been always\nruled by princes; as Rome grew after the expulsion of her kings, and\nAthens after she freed herself from Pisistratus; and this we can\nascribe to no other cause than that the rule of a people is better than\nthe rule of a prince.\nNor would I have it thought that anything our historian may have\naffirmed in the passage cited, or elsewhere, controverts these my\nopinions. For if all the glories and all the defects both of peoples\nand of princes be carefully weighed, it will appear that both for\ngoodness and for glory a people is to be preferred. And if princes\nsurpass peoples in the work of legislation, in shaping civil\ninstitutions, in moulding statutes, and framing new ordinances, so far\ndo the latter surpass the former in maintaining what has once been\nestablished, as to merit no less praise than they.\nAnd to state the sum of the whole matter shortly, I say that popular\ngovernments have endured for long periods in the same way as the\ngovernments of princes, and that both have need to be regulated by the\nlaws; because the prince who can do what he pleases is a madman, and\nthe people which can do as it pleases is never wise. If, then, we\nassume the case of a prince bound, and of a people chained down by the\nlaws, greater virtue will appear in the people than in the prince;\nwhile if we assume the case of each of them freed from all control, it\nwill be seen that the people commits fewer errors than the prince, and\nless serious errors, and such as admit of readier cure. For a turbulent\nand unruly people may be spoken to by a good man, and readily brought\nback to good ways; but none can speak to a wicked prince, nor any\nremedy be found against him but by the sword. And from this we may\ninfer which of the two suffers from the worse disease; for if the\ndisease of the people may be healed by words, while that of the prince\nmust be dealt with by the sword, there is none but will judge that evil\nto be the greater which demands the more violent remedy.\nWhen a people is absolutely uncontrolled, it is not so much the follies\nwhich it commits or the evil which it actually does that excites alarm,\nas the mischief which may thence result, since in such disorders it\nbecomes possible for a tyrant to spring up. But with a wicked prince\nthe contrary is the case; for we dread present ill, and place our hopes\nin the future, persuading ourselves that the evil life of the prince\nmay bring about our freedom. So that there is this distinction between\nthe two, that with the one we fear what is, with the other what is\nlikely to be. Again, the cruelties of a people are turned against him\nwho it fears will encroach upon the common rights, but the cruelties of\nthe prince against those who he fears may assert those rights.\nThe prejudice which is entertained against the people arises from this,\nthat any man may speak ill of them openly and fearlessly, even when the\ngovernment is in their hands; whereas princes are always spoken of with\na thousand reserves and a constant eye to consequences.\nBut since the subject suggests it, it seems to me not out of place to\nconsider what alliances we can most trust, whether those made with\ncommonwealths or those made with princes.\nCHAPTER LIX.\u2014_To what Leagues or Alliances we may most trust; whether\nthose we make with Commonwealths or those we make with Princes_.\nSince leagues and alliances are every day entered into by one prince\nwith another, or by one commonwealth with another, and as conventions\nand treaties are concluded in like manner between princes and\ncommonwealths, it seems to me proper to inquire whether the faith of a\ncommonwealth or that of a prince is the more stable and the safer to\ncount on. All things considered, I am disposed to believe that in most\ncases they are alike, though in some they differ. Of one thing,\nhowever, I am convinced, namely, that engagements made under duress\nwill never be observed either by prince or by commonwealth; and that if\nmenaced with the loss of their territories, both the one and the other\nwill break faith with you and treat you with ingratitude. Demetrius,\nwho was named the \u201cCity-taker,\u201d had conferred numberless benefits upon\nthe Athenians; but when, afterwards, on being defeated by his enemies,\nhe sought shelter in Athens, as being a friendly city and under\nobligations to him, it was refused him; a circumstance which grieved\nhim far more than the loss of his soldiers and army had done. Pompey,\nin like manner, when routed by C\u00e6sar in Thessaly, fled for refuge to\nPtolemy in Egypt, who formerly had been restored by him to his kingdom;\nby whom he was put to death. In both these instances the same causes\nwere at work, although the inhumanity and the wrong inflicted were less\nin the case of the commonwealth than of the prince. Still, wherever\nthere is fear, the want of faith will be the same.\nAnd even if there be found a commonwealth or prince who, in order to\nkeep faith, will submit to be ruined, this is seen to result from a\nlike cause. For, as to the prince, it may easily happen that he is\nfriend to a powerful sovereign, whom, though he be at the time without\nmeans to defend him, he may presently hope to see restored to his\ndominions; or it may be that having linked his fortunes with another\u2019s,\nhe despairs of finding either faith or friendship from the enemies of\nhis ally, as was the case with those Neapolitan princes who espoused\nthe interests of France. As to commonwealths, an instance similar to\nthat of the princes last named, is that of Saguntum in Spain, which\nawaited ruin in adhering to the fortunes of Rome. A like course was\nalso followed by Florence when, in the year 1512, she stood steadfastly\nby the cause of the French. And taking everything into account, I\nbelieve that in cases of urgency, we shall find a certain degree of\nstability sooner in commonwealths than in princes. For though\ncommonwealths be like-minded with princes, and influenced by the same\npassions, the circumstance that their movements must be slower, makes\nit harder for them to resolve than it is for a prince, for which reason\nthey will be less ready to break faith.\nAnd since leagues and alliances are broken for the sake of certain\nadvantages, in this respect also, commonwealths observe their\nengagements far more faithfully than princes; for abundant examples\nmight be cited of a very slight advantage having caused a prince to\nbreak faith, and of a very great advantage having failed to induce a\ncommonwealth to do so. Of this we have an instance in the proposal made\nto the Athenians by Themistocles, when he told them at a public meeting\nthat he had certain advice to offer which would prove of great\nadvantage to their city, but the nature of which he could not disclose\nto them, lest it should become generally known, when the opportunity\nfor acting upon it would be lost. Whereupon the Athenians named\nAristides to receive his communication, and to act upon it as he\nthought fit. To him, accordingly, Themistocles showed how the navy of\nunited Greece, for the safety of which the Athenians stood pledged, was\nso situated that they might either gain it over or destroy it, and thus\nmake themselves absolute masters of the whole country. Aristides\nreporting to the Athenians that the course proposed by Themistocles was\nextremely advantageous but extremely dishonourable, the people utterly\nrefused to entertain it. But Philip of Macedon would not have so acted,\nnor any of those other princes who have sought and found more profit in\nbreaking faith than in any other way.\nAs to engagements broken off on the pretext that they have not been\nobserved by the other side, I say nothing, since that is a matter of\neveryday occurrence, and I am speaking here only of those engagements\nwhich are broken off on extraordinary grounds; but in this respect,\nlikewise, I believe that commonwealths offend less than princes, and\nare therefore more to be trusted.\nCHAPTER LX.\u2014_That the Consulship and all the other Magistracies in Rome\nwere given without respect to Age_.\nIt is seen in the course of the Roman history that, after the\nconsulship was thrown open to the commons, the republic conceded this\ndignity to all its citizens, without distinction either of age or\nblood; nay, that in this matter respect for age was never made a ground\nfor preference among the Romans, whose constant aim it was to discover\nexcellence whether existing in old or young. To this we have the\ntestimony of Valerius Corvinus, himself made consul in his\ntwenty-fourth year, who, in addressing his soldiers, said of the\nconsulship that it was \u201c_the reward not of birth but of desert_.\u201d\nWhether the course thus followed by the Romans was well judged or not,\nis a question on which much might be said. The concession as to blood,\nhowever, was made under necessity, and as I have observed on another\noccasion, the same necessity which obtained in Rome, will be found to\nobtain in every other city which desires to achieve the results which\nRome achieved. For you cannot subject men to hardships unless you hold\nout rewards, nor can you without danger deprive them of those rewards\nwhereof you have held out hopes. It was consequently necessary to\nextend, betimes, to the commons the hope of obtaining the consulship,\non which hope they fed themselves for a while, without actually\nrealizing it. But afterwards the hope alone was not enough, and it had\nto be satisfied. For while cities which do not employ men of plebeian\nbirth in any of those undertakings wherein glory is to be gained, as we\nhave seen was the case with Venice, may treat these men as they please,\nthose other cities which desire to do as Rome did, cannot make this\ndistinction. And if there is to be no distinction in respect of blood,\nnothing can be pleaded for a distinction in respect of age. On the\ncontrary, that distinction must of necessity cease to be observed. For\nwhere a young man is appointed to a post which requires the prudence\nwhich are is supposed to bring, it must be, since the choice rests with\nthe people, that he is thus advanced in consideration of some noble\naction which he has performed; but when a young man is of such\nexcellence as to have made a name for himself by some signal\nachievement, it were much to the detriment of his city were it unable\nat once to make use of him, but had to wait until he had grown old, and\nhad lost, with youth, that alacrity and vigour by which his country\nmight have profited; as Rome profited by the services of Valerius\nCorvinus, of Scipio, of Pompey, and of many others who triumphed while\nyet very young.\nBOOK II.\nPREFACE.\nMen do always, but not always with reason, commend the past and condemn\nthe present, and are so much the partisans of what has been, as not\nmerely to cry up those times which are known to them only from the\nrecords left by historians, but also, when they grow old, to extol the\ndays in which they remember their youth to have been spent. And\nalthough this preference of theirs be in most instances a mistaken one,\nI can see that there are many causes to account for it; chief of which\nI take to be that in respect of things long gone by we perceive not the\nwhole truth, those circumstances that would detract from the credit of\nthe past being for the most part hidden from us, while all that gives\nit lustre is magnified and embellished. For the generality of writers\nrender this tribute to the good fortune of conquerors, that to make\ntheir achievements seem more splendid, they not merely exaggerate the\ngreat things they have done, but also lend such a colour to the actions\nof their enemies, that any one born afterwards, whether in the\nconquering or in the conquered country, has cause to marvel at these\nmen and these times, and is constrained to praise and love them beyond\nall others.\nAgain, men being moved to hatred either by fear or envy, these two most\npowerful causes of dislike are cancelled in respect of things which are\npast, because what is past can neither do us hurt, nor afford occasion\nfor envy. The contrary, however, is the case with the things we see,\nand in which we take part; for in these, from our complete acquaintance\nwith them, no part of them being hidden from us, we recognize, along\nwith much that is good, much that displeases us, and so are forced to\npronounce them far inferior to the old, although in truth they deserve\nfar greater praise and admiration. I speak not, here, of what relates\nto the arts, which have such distinction inherent in them, that time\ncan give or take from them but little of the glory which they merit of\nthemselves. I speak of the lives and manners of men, touching which the\ngrounds for judging are not so clear.\nI repeat, then, that it is true that this habit of blaming and praising\nobtains, but not always true that it is wrong applied. For sometimes it\nwill happen that this judgment is just; because, as human affairs are\nin constant movement, it must be that they either rise or fall.\nWherefore, we may see a city or province furnished with free\ninstitutions by some great and wise founder, flourish for a while\nthrough his merits, and advance steadily on the path of improvement.\nAny one born therein at that time would be in the wrong to praise the\npast more than the present, and his error would be occasioned by the\ncauses already noticed. But any one born afterwards in that city or\nprovince when the time has come for it to fall away from its former\nfelicity, would not be mistaken in praising the past.\nWhen I consider how this happens, I am persuaded that the world,\nremaining continually the same, has in it a constant quantity of good\nand evil; but that this good and this evil shift about from one country\nto another, as we know that in ancient times empire shifted from one\nnation to another, according as the manners of these nations changed,\nthe world, as a whole, continuing as before, and the only difference\nbeing that, whereas at first Assyria was made the seat of its\nexcellence, this was afterwards placed in Media, then in Persia, until\nat last it was transferred to Italy and Rome. And although after the\nRoman Empire, none has followed which has endured, or in which the\nworld has centred its whole excellence, we nevertheless find that\nexcellence diffused among many valiant nations, the kingdom of the\nFranks, for example, that of the Turks, that of the Soldan, and the\nStates of Germany at the present day; and shared at an earlier time by\nthat sect of the Saracens who performed so many great achievements and\ngained so wide a dominion, after destroying the Roman Empire in the\nEast.\nIn all these countries, therefore, after the decline of the Roman\npower, and among all these races, there existed, and in some part of\nthem there yet exists, that excellence which alone is to be desired and\njustly to be praised. Wherefore, if any man being born in one of these\ncountries should exalt past times over present, he might be mistaken;\nbut any who, living at the present day in Italy or Greece, has not in\nItaly become an ultramontane or in Greece a Turk, has reason to\ncomplain of his own times, and to commend those others, in which there\nwere many things which made them admirable; whereas, now, no regard\nbeing had to religion, to laws, or to arms, but all being tarnished\nwith every sort of shame, there is nothing to redeem the age from the\nlast extremity of wretchedness, ignominy, and disgrace. And the vices\nof our age are the more odious in that they are practised by those who\nsit on the judgment seat, govern the State, and demand public\nreverence.\nBut, returning to the matter in hand, it may be said, that if the\njudgment of men be at fault in pronouncing whether the present age or\nthe past is the better in respect of things whereof, by reason of their\nantiquity, they cannot have the same perfect knowledge which they have\nof their own times, it ought not to be at fault in old men when they\ncompare the days of their youth with those of their maturity, both of\nwhich have been alike seen and known by them. This were indeed true, if\nmen at all periods of their lives judged of things in the same way, and\nwere constantly influenced by the same desires; but since they alter,\nthe times, although they alter not, cannot but seem different to those\nwho have other desires, other pleasures, and other ways of viewing\nthings in their old age from those they had in their youth. For since,\nwhen they grow old, men lose in bodily strength but gain in wisdom and\ndiscernment, it must needs be that those things which in their youth\nseemed to them tolerable and good, should in their old age appear\nintolerable and evil. And whereas they should ascribe this to their\njudgment, they lay the blame upon the times.\nBut, further, since the desires of men are insatiable, Nature prompting\nthem to desire all things and Fortune permitting them to enjoy but few,\nthere results a constant discontent in their minds, and a loathing of\nwhat they possess, prompting them to find fault with the present,\npraise the past, and long for the future, even though they be not moved\nthereto by any reasonable cause.\nI know not, therefore, whether I may not deserve to be reckoned in the\nnumber of those who thus deceive themselves, if, in these Discourses of\nmine, I render excessive praise to the ancient times of the Romans\nwhile I censure our own. And, indeed, were not the excellence which\nthen prevailed and the corruption which prevails now clearer than the\nsun, I should proceed more guardedly in what I have to say, from fear\nlest in accusing others I should myself fall into this self-deception.\nBut since the thing is so plain that every one sees it, I shall be bold\nto speak freely all I think, both of old times and of new, in order\nthat the minds of the young who happen to read these my writings, may\nbe led to shun modern examples, and be prepared to follow those set by\nantiquity whenever chance affords the opportunity. For it is the duty\nof every good man to teach others those wholesome lessons which the\nmalice of Time or of Fortune has not permitted him to put in practice;\nto the end, that out of many who have the knowledge, some one better\nloved by Heaven may be found able to carry them out.\nHaving spoken, then, in the foregoing Book of the various methods\nfollowed by the Romans in regulating the domestic affairs of their\ncity, in this I shall speak of what was done by them to spread their\nEmpire.\nCHAPTER I.\u2014_Whether the Empire acquired by the Romans was more due to\nValour or to Fortune_.\nMany authors, and among others that most grave historian Plutarch, have\nthought that in acquiring their empire the Romans were more beholden to\ntheir good fortune than to their valour; and besides other reasons\nwhich they give for this opinion, they affirm it to be proved by the\nadmission of the Romans themselves, since their having erected more\ntemples to Fortune than to any other deity, shows that it was to her\nthat they ascribed their success. It would seem, too, that Titus Livius\nwas of the same mind, since he very seldom puts a speech into the mouth\nof any Roman in which he discourses of valour, wherein he does not also\nmake mention of Fortune. This, however, is an opinion with which I can\nin no way concur, and which, I take it, cannot be made good. For if no\ncommonwealth has ever been found to grow like the Roman, it is because\nnone was ever found so well fitted by its institutions to make that\ngrowth. For by the valour of her armies she spread her empire, while by\nher conduct of affairs, and by other methods peculiar to herself and\ndevised by her first founder, she was able to keep what she acquired,\nas shall be fully shown in many of the following Discourses.\nThe writers to whom I have referred assert that it was owing to their\ngood fortune and not to their prudence that the Romans never had two\ngreat wars on their hands at once; as, for instance, that they waged no\nwars with the Latins until they had not merely overcome the Samnites,\nbut undertook in their defence the war on which they then entered; nor\never fought with the Etruscans until they had subjugated the Latins,\nand had almost worn out the Samnites by frequent defeats; whereas, had\nany two of these powers, while yet fresh and unexhausted, united\ntogether, it may easily be believed that the ruin of the Roman Republic\nmust have followed. But to whatsoever cause we ascribe it, it never so\nchanced that the Romans engaged in two great wars at the same time. On\nthe contrary, it always seemed as though on the breaking out of one\nwar, another was extinguished; or that on the termination of one,\nanother broke out. And this we may plainly see from the order in which\ntheir wars succeeded one another.\nFor, omitting those waged by them before their city was taken by the\nGauls, we find that during their struggle with the Equians and the\nVolscians, and while these two nations continued strong, no others rose\nagainst them. On these being subdued, there broke out the war with the\nSamnites; and although before the close of that contest the Latin\nnations had begun to rebel against Rome, nevertheless, when their\nrebellion came to a head, the Samnites were in league with Rome, and\nhelped her with their army to quell the presumption of the rebels; on\nwhose defeat the war with Samnium was renewed.\nWhen the strength of Samnium had been drained by repeated reverses,\nthere followed the war with the Etruscans; which ended, the Samnites\nwere once more stirred to activity by the coming of Pyrrhus into Italy.\nWhen he, too, had been defeated, and sent back to Greece, Rome entered\non her first war with the Carthaginians; which was no sooner over than\nall the Gallic nations on both sides of the Alps combined against the\nRomans, by whom, in the battle fought between Populonia and Pisa, where\nnow stands the fortress of San Vincenzo, they were at last routed with\ntremendous slaughter.\nThis war ended, for twenty years together the Romans were engaged in no\ncontest of importance, their only adversaries being the Ligurians, and\nthe remnant of the Gallic tribes who occupied Lombardy; and on this\nfooting things continued down to the second Carthaginian war, which for\nsixteen years kept the whole of Italy in a blaze. This too being\nbrought to a most glorious termination, there followed the Macedonian\nwar, at the close of which succeeded the war with Antiochus and Asia.\nThese subdued, there remained not in the whole world, king or people\nwho either singly or together could withstand the power of Rome.\nBut even before this last victory, any one observing the order of these\nwars, and the method in which they were conducted, must have recognized\nnot only the good fortune of the Romans, but also their extraordinary\nvalour and prudence. And were any one to search for the causes of this\ngood fortune, he would have little difficulty in finding them, since\nnothing is more certain than that when a potentate has attained so\ngreat a reputation that every neighbouring prince or people is afraid\nto engage him single-handed, and stands in awe of him, none will ever\nventure to attack him, unless driven to do so by necessity; so that it\nwill almost rest on his will to make war as he likes on any of his\nneighbours, while he studiously maintains peace with the rest; who, on\ntheir part, whether through fear of his power, or deceived by the\nmethods he takes to dull their vigilance, are easily kept quiet.\nDistant powers, in the mean time, who have no intercourse with either,\ntreat the matter as too remote to concern them in any way; and abiding\nin this error until the conflagration approaches their own doors, on\nits arrival have no resource for its extinction, save in their own\nstrength, which, as their enemy has by that time become exceedingly\npowerful, no longer suffices.\nI forbear to relate how the Samnites stood looking on while the Romans\nwere subjugating the Equians and the Volscians; and, to avoid being\nprolix, shall content myself with the single instance of the\nCarthaginians, who, at the time when the Romans were contending with\nthe Samnites and Etruscans, were possessed of great power and held in\nhigh repute, being already masters of the whole of Africa together with\nSicily and Sardinia, besides occupying territory in various parts of\nSpain. And because their empire was so great, and at such a distance\nfrom the Roman frontier, they were never led to think of attacking the\nRomans or of lending assistance to the Etruscans or Samnites. On the\ncontrary, they behaved towards the Romans as men behave towards those\nwhom they see prosper, rather taking their part and courting their\nfriendship. Nor did they discover their mistake until the Romans, after\nsubduing all the intervening nations, began to assail their power both\nin Spain and Sicily. What happened in the case of the Carthaginians,\nhappened also in the case of the Gauls, of Philip of Macedon, and of\nAntiochus, each of whom, while Rome was engaged with another of them,\nbelieved that other would have the advantage, and that there would be\ntime enough to provide for their own safety, whether by making peace or\nwar. It seems to me, therefore, that the same good fortune which, in\nthis respect, attended the Romans, might be shared by all princes\nacting as they did, and of a valour equal to theirs.\nAs bearing on this point, it might have been proper for me to show what\nmethods were followed by the Romans in entering the territories of\nother nations, had I not already spoken of this at length in my\n_Treatise on Princedoms_, wherein the whole subject is discussed. Here\nit is enough to say briefly, that in a new province they always sought\nfor some friend who should be to them as a ladder whereby to climb, a\ndoor through which to pass, or an instrument wherewith to keep their\nhold. Thus we see them effect their entrance into Samnium through the\nCapuans, into Etruria through the Camertines, into Sicily through the\nMamertines, into Spain through the Saguntans, into Africa through\nMassinissa, into Greece through the Etolians, into Asia through Eumenes\nand other princes, into Gaul through the Massilians and Eduans; and, in\nlike manner, never without similar assistance in their efforts whether\nto acquire provinces or to keep them.\nThe nations who carefully attend to this precaution will be seen to\nstand in less need of Fortune\u2019s help than others who neglect it. But\nthat all may clearly understand how much more the Romans were aided by\nvalour than by Fortune in acquiring their empire, I shall in the\nfollowing Chapter consider the character of those nations with whom\nthey had to contend, and show how stubborn these were in defending\ntheir freedom.\nCHAPTER II.\u2014_With what Nations the Romans had to contend, and how\nstubborn these were in defending their Freedom._\nIn subduing the countries round about them, and certain of the more\ndistant provinces, nothing gave the Romans so much trouble, as the love\nwhich in those days many nations bore to freedom, defending it with\nsuch obstinacy as could not have been overcome save by a surpassing\nvalour. For we know by numberless instances, what perils these nations\nwere ready to face in their efforts to maintain or recover their\nfreedom, and what vengeance they took against those who deprived them\nof it. We know, too, from history, what hurt a people or city suffers\nfrom servitude. And though, at the present day, there is but one\nprovince which can be said to contain within it free cities, we find\nthat formerly these abounded everywhere. For we learn that in the\nancient times of which I speak, from the mountains which divide Tuscany\nfrom Lombardy down to the extreme point of Italy, there dwelt numerous\nfree nations, such as the Etruscans, the Romans, and the Samnites,\nbesides many others in other parts of the Peninsula. Nor do we ever\nread of there being any kings over them, except those who reigned in\nRome, and Porsenna, king of Etruria. How the line of this last-named\nprince came to be extinguished, history does not inform us; but it is\nclear that at the time when the Romans went to besiege Veii, Etruria\nwas free, and so greatly rejoiced in her freedom, and so detested the\nregal name, that when the Veientines, who for their defence had created\na king in Veii, sought aid from the Etruscans against Rome, these,\nafter much deliberation resolved to lend them no help while they\ncontinued to live under a king; judging it useless to defend a country\ngiven over to servitude by its inhabitants.\nIt is easy to understand whence this love of liberty arises among\nnations, for we know by experience that States have never signally\nincreased, either as to dominion or wealth, except where they have\nlived under a free government. And truly it is strange to think to what\na pitch of greatness Athens came during the hundred years after she had\nfreed herself from the despotism of Pisistratus; and far stranger to\ncontemplate the marvellous growth which Rome made after freeing herself\nfrom her kings. The cause, however, is not far to seek, since it is the\nwell-being, not of individuals, but of the community which makes a\nState great; and, without question, this universal well-being is\nnowhere secured save in a republic. For a republic will do whatsoever\nmakes for its interest; and though its measures prove hurtful to this\nman or to that, there are so many whom they benefit, that these are\nable to carry them out, in spite of the resistance of the few whom they\ninjure.\nBut the contrary happens in the case of a prince; for, as a rule, what\nhelps him hurts the State, and what helps the State hurts him; so that\nwhenever a tyranny springs up in a city which has lived free, the least\nevil which can befall that city is to make no further progress, nor\never increase in power or wealth; but in most cases, if not in all, it\nwill be its fate to go back. Or should there chance to arise in it some\nable tyrant who extends his dominions by his valour and skill in arms,\nthe advantage which results is to himself only, and not to the State;\nsince he can bestow no honours on those of the citizens over whom he\ntyrannizes who have shown themselves good and valiant, lest afterwards\nhe should have cause to fear them. Nor can he make those cities which\nhe acquires, subject or tributary to the city over which he rules;\nbecause to make this city powerful is not for his interest, which lies\nin keeping it so divided that each town and province may separately\nrecognize him alone as its master. In this way he only, and not his\ncountry, is the gainer by his conquests. And if any one desire to have\nthis view confirmed by numberless other proofs, let him look into\nXenophon\u2019s treatise _De Tirannide_.\nNo wonder, then, that the nations of antiquity pursued tyrants with\nsuch relentless hatred, and so passionately loved freedom that its very\nname was dear to them, as was seen when Hieronymus, grandson of Hiero\nthe Syracusan, was put to death in Syracuse. For when word of his death\nreached the army, which lay encamped not far off, at first it was\ngreatly moved, and eager to take up arms against the murderers. But on\nhearing the cry of liberty shouted in the streets of Syracuse, quieted\nat once by the name, it laid aside its resentment against those who had\nslain the tyrant, and fell to consider how a free government might be\nprovided for the city.\nNor is it to be wondered at that the ancient nations took terrible\nvengeance on those who deprived them of their freedom; of which, though\nthere be many instances, I mean only to cite one which happened in the\ncity of Corcyra at the time of the Peloponnesian war. For Greece being\ndivided into two factions, one of which sided with the Athenians, the\nother with the Spartans, it resulted that many of its cities were\ndivided against themselves, some of the citizens seeking the friendship\nof Sparta and some of Athens. In the aforesaid city of Corcyra, the\nnobles getting the upper hand, deprived the commons of their freedom;\nthese, however, recovering themselves with the help of the Athenians,\nlaid hold of the entire body of the nobles, and cast them into a prison\nlarge enough to contain them all, whence they brought them forth by\neight or ten at a time, pretending that they were to be sent to\ndifferent places into banishment, whereas, in fact, they put them to\ndeath with many circumstances of cruelty. Those who were left, learning\nwhat was going on, resolved to do their utmost to escape this\nignominious death, and arming themselves with what weapons they could\nfind, defended the door of their prison against all who sought to\nenter; till the people, hearing the tumult and rushing in haste to the\nprison, dragged down the roof, and smothered the prisoners in the\nruins. Many other horrible and atrocious cruelties likewise perpetrated\nin Greece, show it to be true that a lost freedom is avenged with more\nferocity than a threatened freedom is defended.\nWhen I consider whence it happened that the nations of antiquity were\nso much more zealous in their love of liberty than those of the present\nday, I am led to believe that it arose from the same cause which makes\nthe present generation of men less vigorous and daring than those of\nancient times, namely the difference of the training of the present day\nfrom that of earlier ages; and this, again, arises from the different\ncharacter of the religions then and now prevailing. For our religion,\nhaving revealed to us the truth and the true path, teaches us to make\nlittle account of worldly glory; whereas, the Gentiles, greatly\nesteeming it, and placing therein their highest good, displayed a\ngreater fierceness in their actions.\nThis we may gather from many of their customs, beginning with their\nsacrificial rites, which were of much magnificence as compared with the\nsimplicity of our worship, though that be not without a certain dignity\nof its own, refined rather than splendid, and far removed from any\ntincture of ferocity or violence. In the religious ceremonies of the\nancients neither pomp nor splendour were wanting; but to these was\njoined the ordinance of sacrifice, giving occasion to much bloodshed\nand cruelty. For in its celebration many beasts were slaughtered, and\nthis being a cruel spectacle imparted a cruel temper to the\nworshippers. Moreover, under the old religions none obtained divine\nhonours save those who were loaded with worldly glory, such as captains\nof armies and rulers of cities; whereas our religion glorifies men of a\nhumble and contemplative, rather than of an active life. Accordingly,\nwhile the highest good of the old religions consisted in magnanimity,\nbodily strength, and all those other qualities which make men brave,\nour religion places it in humility, lowliness, and contempt for the\nthings of this world; or if it ever calls upon us to be brave, it is\nthat we should be brave to suffer rather than to do.\nThis manner of life, therefore, seems to have made the world feebler,\nand to have given it over as a prey to wicked men to deal with as they\nplease; since the mass of mankind, in the hope of being received into\nParadise, think more how to bear injuries than how to avenge them. But\nshould it seem that the world has grown effeminate and Heaven laid\naside her arms, this assuredly results from the baseness of those who\nhave interpreted our religion to accord with indolence and ease rather\nthan with valour. For were we to remember that religion permits the\nexaltation and defence of our country, we would see it to be our duty\nto love and honour it, and would strive to be able and ready to defend\nit.\nThis training, therefore, and these most false interpretations are the\ncauses why, in the world of the present day, we find no longer the\nnumerous commonwealths which were found of old; and in consequence,\nthat we see not now among the nations that love of freedom which\nprevailed then; though, at the same time, I am persuaded that one cause\nof this change has been, that the Roman Empire by its arms and power\nput an end to all the free States and free institutions of antiquity.\nFor although the power of Rome fell afterwards into decay, these States\ncould never recover their strength or resume their former mode of\ngovernment, save in a very few districts of the Empire.\nBut, be this as it may, certain it is that in every country of the\nworld, even the least considerable, the Romans found a league of\nwell-armed republics, most resolute in the defence of their freedom,\nwhom it is clear they never could have subdued had they not been\nendowed with the rarest and most astonishing valour. To cite a single\ninstance, I shall take the case of the Samnites who, strange as it may\nnow seem, were on the admission of Titus Livius himself, so powerful\nand so steadfast in arms, as to be able to withstand the Romans down to\nthe consulship of Papirius Cursor, son to the first Papirius, a period\nof six and forty years, in spite of numerous defeats, the loss of many\nof their towns, and the great slaughter which overtook them everywhere\nthroughout their country. And this is the more remarkable when we see\nthat country, which once contained so many noble cities, and supported\nso great a population, now almost uninhabited; and reflect that it\nformerly enjoyed a government and possessed resources making its\nconquest impossible to less than Roman valour.\nThere is no difficulty, therefore, in determining whence that ancient\ngreatness and this modern decay have arisen, since they can be traced\nto the free life formerly prevailing and to the servitude which\nprevails now. For all countries and provinces which enjoy complete\nfreedom, make, as I have said, most rapid progress. Because, from\nmarriage being less restricted in these countries, and more sought\nafter, we find there a greater population; every man being disposed to\nbeget as many children as he thinks he can rear, when he has no anxiety\nlest they should be deprived of their patrimony, and knows not only\nthat they are born to freedom and not to slavery, but that they may\nrise by their merit to be the first men of their country. In such\nStates, accordingly, we see wealth multiply, both that which comes from\nagriculture and that which comes from manufactures. For all love to\ngather riches and to add to their possessions when their enjoyment of\nthem is not likely to be disturbed. And hence it happens that the\ncitizens of such States vie with one another in whatever tends to\npromote public or private well-being; in both of which, consequently,\nthere is a wonderful growth.\nBut the contrary of all this takes place in those countries which live\nin servitude, and the more oppressive their servitude, the more they\nfall short of the good which all desire. And the hardest of all hard\nservitudes is that wherein one commonwealth is subjected to another.\nFirst, because it is more lasting, and there is less hope to escape\nfrom it; and, second, because every commonwealth seeks to add to its\nown strength by weakening and enfeebling all beside. A prince who gets\nthe better of you will not treat you after this fashion, unless he be a\nbarbarian like those eastern despots who lay countries waste and\ndestroy the labours of civilization; but if influenced by the ordinary\npromptings of humanity, will, as a rule, regard all his subject States\nwith equal favour, and suffer them to pursue their usual employments,\nand retain almost all their ancient institutions, so that if they\nflourish not as free States might, they do not dwindle as States that\nare enslaved; by which I mean enslaved by a stranger, for of that other\nslavery to which they may be reduced by one of their own citizens, I\nhave already spoken.\nWhoever, therefore, shall well consider what has been said above, will\nnot be astonished at the power possessed by the Samnites while they\nwere still free, nor at the weakness into which they fell when they\nwere subjugated. Of which change in their fortunes Livius often reminds\nus, and particularly in connection with the war with Hannibal, where he\nrelates that the Samnites, being ill-treated by a Roman legion\nquartered at Nola, sent legates to Hannibal to ask his aid; who in\nlaying their case before him told him, that with their own soldiers and\ncaptains they had fought single handed against the Romans for a hundred\nyears, and had more than once withstood two consuls and two consular\narmies; but had now fallen so low, that they were scarce able to defend\nthemselves against one poor legion.\nCHAPTER III.\u2014_That Rome became great by destroying the Cities which lay\nround about her, and by readily admitting strangers to the rights of\nCitizenship._\n\u201cCrescit interea Roma Alb\u00e6 ruinis\u201d\u2014_Meanwhile Rome grows on the ruins\nof Alba_. They who would have their city become a great empire, must\nendeavour by every means to fill it with inhabitants; for without a\nnumerous population no city can ever succeed in growing powerful. This\nmay be effected in two ways, by gentleness or by force. By gentleness,\nwhen you offer a safe and open path to all strangers who may wish to\ncome and dwell in your city, so as to encourage them to come there of\ntheir own accord; by force, when after destroying neighbouring towns,\nyou transplant their inhabitants to live in yours. Both of these\nmethods were practised by Rome, and with such success, that in the time\nof her sixth king there dwelt within her walls eighty thousand citizens\nfit to bear arms. For the Romans loved to follow the methods of the\nskilful husbandman, who, to insure a plant growing big and yielding and\nmaturing its fruit, cuts off the first shoots it sends out, that the\nstrength remaining in the stem, it may in due season put forth new and\nmore vigorous and more fruitful branches. And that this was a right and\na necessary course for Rome to take for establishing and extending her\nempire, is proved by the example of Sparta and Athens, which, although\nexceedingly well-armed States, and regulated by excellent laws, never\nreached the same greatness as the Roman Republic; though the latter, to\nall appearance, was more turbulent and disorderly than they, and, so\nfar as laws went, not so perfectly governed. For this we can offer no\nother explanation than that already given. For by augmenting the\nnumbers of her citizens in both the ways named, Rome was soon able to\nplace two hundred and eighty thousand men under arms; while neither\nSparta nor Athens could ever muster more than twenty thousand; and\nthis, not because the situation of these countries was less\nadvantageous than that of Rome, but simply from the difference in the\nmethods they followed.\nFor Lycurgus, the founder of the Spartan Republic, thinking nothing so\nlikely to relax his laws as an admixture of new citizens, did all he\ncould to prevent intercourse with strangers; with which object, besides\nrefusing these the right to marry, the right of citizenship, and all\nsuch other social rights as induce men to become members of a\ncommunity, he ordained that in this republic of his the only money\ncurrent should be of leather, so that none might be tempted to repair\nthither to trade or to carry on any art.\nUnder such circumstances the number of the inhabitants of that State\ncould never much increase. For as all our actions imitate nature, and\nit is neither natural nor possible that a puny stem should carry a\ngreat branch, so a small republic cannot assume control over cities or\ncountries stronger than herself; or, doing so, will resemble the tree\nwhose boughs being greater than its trunk, are supported with\ndifficulty, and snapped by every gust of wind. As it proved with\nSparta. For after she had spread her dominion over all the cities of\nGreece, no sooner did Thebes rebel than all the others rebelled\nlikewise, and the trunk was left stripped of its boughs. But this could\nnot have happened with Rome, whose stem was mighty enough to bear any\nbranch with ease.\nIt was, therefore, by adding to her population, and by, adopting\ncertain other methods presently to be noticed, that Rome became so\ngreat and powerful. And this is well expressed by Titus Livius, in the\nwords, \u201c_Crescit interea Roma Albae ruinis_.\u201d\nCHAPTER IV.\u2014_That Commonwealths have followed three Methods for\nextending their Power_.\nAny one who has read ancient history with attention, must have observed\nthat three methods have been used by republics for extending their\npower. One of these, followed by the old Etruscans, is to form a\nconfederation of many States, wherein none has precedence over the rest\nin authority or rank, and each allows the others to share its\nacquisitions; as do the States of the Swiss League in our days, and as\nthe Achaians and Etolians did in Greece in earlier times. And because\nthe Etruscans were opposed to the Romans in many wars, that I may give\na clearer notion of this method of theirs, I shall enlarge a little in\nmy account of the Etruscan people.\nIn Italy, before the Romans became supreme, the Etruscans were very\npowerful, both by sea and land; and although we have no separate\nhistory of their affairs, we have some slight records left us of them,\nand some indications of their greatness. We know, for instance, that\nthey planted a colony, to which they gave the name of Hadria, on the\ncoast of the upper sea; which colony became so renowned that it lent\nits name to the sea itself, which to this day by the Latins is called\nthe Hadriatic. We know, too, that their arms were obeyed from the Tiber\nto the foot of the mountains which enclose the greater part of the\nItalian peninsula; although, two hundred years before Rome grew to any\ngreat strength, they had lost their supremacy in the province now known\nas Lombardy, of which the French had possessed themselves. For that\npeople, whether driven by necessity, or attracted by the excellence of\nthe fruits, and still more of the wine of Italy, came there under their\nchief, Bellovesus; and after defeating and expelling the inhabitants of\nthe country, settled themselves therein, and there built many cities;\ncalling the district Gallia, after the name they then bore: and this\nterritory they retained until they were subdued by the Romans.\nThese Etruscans, therefore, living with one another on a footing of\ncomplete equality, when they sought to extend their power, followed\nthat first method of which I have just now spoken. Their State was made\nup of twelve cities, among which were Chiusi, Veii, Friuli, Arezzo,\nVolterra, and the like, and their government was conducted in the form\nof a league. They could not, however, extend their conquests beyond\nItaly; while even within the limits of Italy, much territory remained\nunoccupied by them for reasons presently to be noticed.\nThe second method is to provide yourself with allies or companions,\ntaking heed, however, to retain in your own hands the chief command,\nthe seat of government, and the titular supremacy. This was the method\nfollowed by the Romans.\nThe third method is to hold other States in direct subjection to you,\nand not merely associated with you as companions; and this was the plan\npursued by the Spartans and Athenians.\nOf these three methods, the last is wholly useless, as was seen in the\ncase of the two States named, which came to ruin from no other cause\nthan that they had acquired a dominion greater than they could\nmaintain. For to undertake to govern cities by force, especially such\ncities as have been used to live in freedom, is a difficult and arduous\ntask, in which you never can succeed without an army and that a great\none. But to have such an army you must needs have associates who will\nhelp to swell the numbers of your own citizens. And because Athens and\nSparta neglected this precaution, whatever they did was done in vain;\nwhereas Rome, which offers an instance of the second of the methods we\nare considering, by attending to this precaution reached a power that\nhad no limit. And as she alone has lived in this way, so she alone has\nattained to this pitch of power. For joining with herself many States\nthroughout Italy as her companions, who in most respects lived with her\non a footing of equality, while, as has been noted, always reserving to\nherself the seat of empire and the titular command, it came about that\nthese States, without being aware of it, by their own efforts, and with\ntheir own blood, wrought out their own enslavement.\nFor when Rome began to send armies out of Italy, for the purpose of\nreducing foreign kingdoms to provinces, and of subjugating nations who,\nbeing used to live under kings, were not impatient of her yoke, and\nwho, receiving Roman governors, and having been conquered by armies\nbearing the Roman name, recognized no masters save the Romans, those\ncompanions of Rome who dwelt in Italy suddenly found themselves\nsurrounded by Roman subjects, and weighed down by the greatness of the\nRoman power; and when at last they came to perceive the mistake in\nwhich they had been living, it was too late to remedy it, so vast was\nthe authority which Rome had then obtained over foreign countries, and\nso great the resources which she possessed within herself; having by\nthis time grown to be the mightiest and best-armed of States. So that\nalthough these her companions sought to avenge their wrongs by\nconspiring against her, they were soon defeated in the attempt, and\nremained in a worse plight than before, since they too became subjects\nand no longer associates. This method, then, as I have said, was\nfollowed by the Romans alone; but no other plan can be pursued by a\nrepublic which desires to extend its power; experience having shown\nnone other so safe and certain.\nThe method which consists in forming leagues, of which I have spoken\nabove as having been adopted by the Etruscans, the Achaians, and the\nEtolians of old, and in our own days by the Swiss, is the next best\nafter that followed by the Romans, for as in this way there can be no\ngreat extension of power, two advantages result: first, that you do not\nreadily involve yourself in war; and, second, that you can easily\npreserve any little acquisition which you may make. The reason why you\ncannot greatly extend your power is, that as your league is made up of\nseparate States with distinct seats of government, it is difficult for\nthese to consult and resolve in concert. The same causes make these\nStates careless to enlarge their territories; because acquisitions\nwhich have to be shared among many communities are less thought of than\nthose made by a single republic which looks to enjoy them all to\nitself. Again, since leagues govern through general councils, they must\nneeds be slower in resolving than a nation dwelling within one\nfrontier.\nMoreover, we find from experience that this method has certain fixed\nlimits beyond which there is no instance of its ever having passed; by\nwhich I mean that some twelve or fourteen communities may league\nthemselves together, but will never seek to pass beyond that limit: for\nafter associating themselves in such numbers as seem to them to secure\ntheir safety against all besides, they desire no further extension of\ntheir power, partly because no necessity compels them to extend, and\npartly because, for the reasons already given, they would find no\nprofit in extending. For were they to seek extension they would have to\nfollow one of two courses: either continuing to admit new members to\ntheir league, whose number must lead to confusion; or else making\nsubjects, a course which they will avoid since they will see difficulty\nin making them, and no great good in having them. Wherefore, when their\nnumber has so increased that their safety seems secured, they have\nrecourse to two expedients: either receiving other States under their\nprotection and engaging for their defence (in which way they obtain\nmoney from various quarters which they can easily distribute among\nthemselves); or else hiring themselves out as soldiers to foreign\nStates, and drawing pay from this or the other prince who employs them\nto carry out his enterprises; as we see done by the Swiss at the\npresent day, and as we read was done in ancient times by certain of\nthose nations whom we have named above. To which we have a witness in\nTitus Livius, who relates that when Philip of Macedon came to treat\nwith Titus Quintius Flamininus, and while terms were being discussed in\nthe presence of a certain Etolian captain, this man coming to words\nwith Philip, the latter taunted him with greed and bad faith; telling\nhim that the Etolians were not ashamed to draw pay from one side, and\nthen send their men to serve on the other; so that often the banner of\nEtolia might be seen displayed in two hostile camps.\nWe see, therefore, that the method of proceeding by leagues has always\nbeen of the same character, and has led always to the same results. We\nsee, likewise, that the method which proceeds by reducing States to\ndirect subjection has constantly proved a weak one, and produced\ninsignificant gains; and that whenever these gains have passed a\ncertain limit, ruin has ensued. And if the latter of these two methods\nbe of little utility among armed States, among those that are unarmed,\nas is now the case with the republics of Italy, it is worse than\nuseless. We may conclude, therefore, that the true method was that\nfollowed by the Romans; which is the more remarkable as we find none\nwho adopted it before they did, and none who have followed it since. As\nfor leagues, I know of no nations who have had recourse to them in\nrecent times except the Swiss and the Suevians.\nBut to bring my remarks on this head to an end, I affirm that all the\nvarious methods followed by the Romans in conducting their affairs,\nwhether foreign or domestic, so far from being imitated in our day,\nhave been held of no account, some pronouncing them to be mere fables,\nsome thinking them impracticable, others out of place and unprofitable;\nand so, abiding in this ignorance, we rest a prey to all who have\nchosen to invade our country. But should it seem difficult to tread in\nthe footsteps of the Romans, it ought not to appear so hard, especially\nfor us Tuscans, to imitate the Tuscans of antiquity, who if, from the\ncauses already assigned, they failed to establish an empire like that\nof Rome, succeeded in acquiring in Italy that degree of power which\ntheir method of acting allowed, and which they long preserved in\nsecurity, with the greatest renown in arms and government, and the\nhighest reputation for manners and religion. This power and this glory\nof theirs were first impaired by the Gauls, and afterwards extinguished\nby the Romans, and so utterly extinguished, that of the Etruscan\nEmpire, so splendid two thousand years ago, we have at the present day\nbarely a record. This it is which has led me to inquire whence this\noblivion of things arises, a question of which I shall treat in the\nfollowing Chapter.\nCHAPTER V.\u2014_That changes in Sects and Tongues, and the happening of\nFloods and Pestilences, obliterate the Memory of the Past_.\nTo those philosophers who will have it that the world has existed from\nall eternity, it were, I think, a good answer, that if what they say be\ntrue we ought to have record of a longer period than five thousand\nyears; did it not appear that the memory of past times is blotted out\nby a variety of causes, some referable to men, and some to Heaven.\nAmong the causes which have a human origin are the changes in sects and\ntongues; because when a new sect, that is to say a new religion, comes\nup, its first endeavour, in order to give itself reputation, is to\nefface the old; and should it so happen that the founders of the new\nreligion speak another tongue, this may readily be effected. This we\nknow from observing the methods which Christianity has followed in\ndealing with the religion of the Gentiles, for we find that it has\nabolished all the rites and ordinances of that worship, and obliterated\nevery trace of the ancient belief. True, it has not succeeded in\nutterly blotting out our knowledge of things done by the famous men who\nheld that belief; and this because the propagators of the new faith,\nretaining the Latin tongue, were constrained to use it in writing the\nnew law; for could they have written this in a new tongue, we may\ninfer, having regard to their other persecutions, that no record\nwhatever would have survived to us of past events. For any one who\nreads of the methods followed by Saint Gregory and the other heads of\nthe Christian religion, will perceive with what animosity they pursued\nall ancient memorials; burning the works of poets and historians;\nbreaking images; and destroying whatsoever else afforded any trace of\nantiquity. So that if to this persecution a new language had been\njoined, it must soon have been found that everything was forgotten.\nWe may believe, therefore, that what Christianity has sought to effect\nagainst the sect of the Gentiles, was actually effected by that sect\nagainst the religion which preceded theirs; and that, from the repeated\nchanges of belief which have taken place in the course of five or six\nthousand years, the memory of what happened at a remote date has\nperished, or, if any trace of it remain, has come to be regarded as a\nfable to which no credit is due; like the Chronicle of Diodorus\nSiculus, which, professing to give an account of the events of forty or\nfifty thousand years, is held, and I believe justly, a lying tale.\nAs for the causes of oblivion which we may refer to Heaven, they are\nthose which make havoc of the human race, and reduce the population of\ncertain parts of the world to a very small number. This happens by\nplague, famine, or flood, of which three the last is the most hurtful,\nas well because it is the most universal, as because those saved are\ngenerally rude and ignorant mountaineers, who possessing no knowledge\nof antiquity themselves, can impart none to those who come after them.\nOr if among the survivors there chance to be one possessed of such\nknowledge, to give himself consequence and credit, he will conceal and\npervert it to suit his private ends, so that to his posterity there\nwill remain only so much as he may have been pleased to communicate,\nand no more.\nThat these floods, plagues, and famines do in fact happen, I see no\nreason to doubt, both because we find all histories full of them, and\nrecognize their effect in this oblivion of the past, and also because\nit is reasonable that such things should happen. For as when much\nsuperfluous matter has gathered in simple bodies, nature makes repeated\nefforts to remove and purge it away, thereby promoting the health of\nthese bodies, so likewise as regards that composite body the human\nrace, when every province of the world so teems with inhabitants that\nthey can neither subsist where they are nor remove elsewhere, every\nregion being equally crowded and over-peopled, and when human craft and\nwickedness have reached their highest pitch, it must needs come about\nthat the world will purge herself in one or another of these three\nways, to the end that men, becoming few and contrite, may amend their\nlives and live with more convenience.\nEtruria, then, as has been said above, was at one time powerful,\nabounding in piety and valour, practising her own customs, and speaking\nher own tongue; but all this was effaced by the power of Rome, so that,\nas I have observed already, nothing is left of her but the memory of a\nname.\nCHAPTER VI.\u2014_Of the Methods followed by the Romans in making War_.\nHaving treated of the methods followed by the Romans for increasing\ntheir power, we shall now go on to consider those which they used in\nmaking war; and in all they did we shall find how wisely they turned\naside from the common path in order to render their progress to supreme\ngreatness easy.\nWhosoever makes war, whether from policy or ambition, means to acquire\nand to hold what he acquires, and to carry on the war he has undertaken\nin such a manner that it shall enrich and not impoverish his native\ncountry and State. It is necessary, therefore, whether for acquiring or\nholding, to consider how cost may be avoided, and everything done most\nadvantageously for the public welfare. But whoever would effect all\nthis, must take the course and follow the methods of the Romans; which\nconsisted, first of all, in making their wars, as the French say,\n_great and short_. For entering the field with strong armies, they\nbrought to a speedy conclusion whatever wars they had with the Latins,\nthe Samnites, or the Etruscans.\nAnd if we take note of all the wars in which they were engaged, from\nthe foundation of their city down to the siege of Veii, all will be\nseen to have been quickly ended some in twenty, some in ten, and some\nin no more than six days. And this was their wont: So soon as war was\ndeclared they would go forth with their armies to meet the enemy and at\nonce deliver battle. The enemy, on being routed, to save their country\nfrom pillage, very soon came to terms, when the Romans would take from\nthem certain portions of their territory. These they either assigned to\nparticular persons, or made the seat of a colony, which being settled\non the confines of the conquered country served as a defence to the\nRoman frontier, to the advantage both of the colonists who had these\nlands given them, and of the Roman people whose borders were thus\nguarded at no expense to themselves. And no other system of defence\ncould have been at once so safe, so strong, and so effectual. For while\nthe enemy were not actually in the field, this guard was sufficient;\nand when they came out in force to overwhelm the colony, the Romans\nalso went forth in strength and gave them battle; and getting the\nbetter of them, imposed harder terms than before, and so returned home.\nAnd in this way they came gradually to establish their name abroad, and\nto add to their power.\nThese methods they continued to employ until they changed their system\nof warfare, which they did during the siege of Veii; when to enable\nthem to carry on a prolonged war, they passed a law for the payment of\ntheir soldiers, whom, up to that time they had not paid, nor needed to\npay, because till then their wars had been of brief duration.\nNevertheless, while allowing pay to their soldiers that they might thus\nwage longer wars, and keep their armies longer in the field when\nemployed on distant enterprises, they never departed from their old\nplan of bringing their campaigns to as speedy an end as place and\ncircumstances allowed, nor ever ceased to plant colonies.\nTheir custom of terminating their wars with despatch, besides being\nnatural to the Romans, was strengthened by the ambition of their\nconsuls, who, being appointed for twelve months only, six of which they\nhad to spend in the city, were eager to bring their wars to an end as\nrapidly as they could, that they might enjoy the honours of a triumph.\nThe usage of planting colonies was recommended by the great advantage\nand convenience which resulted from it. In dealing with the spoils of\nwarfare their practice, no doubt, in a measure changed, so that in this\nrespect they were not afterwards so liberal as they were at first;\npartly, because liberality did not seem so necessary when their\nsoldiers were in receipt of pay; and, partly, because the spoils\nthemselves being greater than before, they thought by their help so to\nenrich the public treasury as to be able to carry on their wars without\ntaxing the city; and, in fact, by pursuing this course the public\nrevenues were soon greatly augmented. The methods thus followed by the\nRomans in dividing plunder and in planting colonies had, accordingly,\nthis result, that whereas other less prudent princes and republics are\nimpoverished by war, Rome was enriched by it; nay, so far was the\nsystem carried, that no consul could hope for a triumph unless he\nbrought back with him for the public treasury much gold and silver and\nspoils of every kind.\nBy methods such as these, at one time bringing their wars to a rapid\nconclusion by invasion and actual defeat, at another wearing out an\nenemy by protracted hostilities, and again by concluding peace on\nadvantageous terms, the Romans continually grew richer and more\npowerful.\nCHAPTER VII.\u2014_Of the Quantity of Land assigned by the Romans to each\nColonist_.\nIt would, I think, be difficult to fix with certainty how much land the\nRomans allotted to each colonist, for my belief is that they gave more\nor less according to the character of the country to which they sent\nthem. We may, however, be sure that in every instance, and to whatever\ncountry they were sent, the quantity of land assigned was not very\nlarge: first, because, these colonists being sent to guard the newly\nacquired country, by giving little land it became possible to send more\nmen; and second because, as the Romans lived frugally at home, it is\nunreasonable to suppose that they should wish their countrymen to be\ntoo well off abroad. And Titus Livius tells us that on the capture of\nVeii, the Romans sent thither a colony, allotting to each colonist\nthree jugera and seven unciae of land, which, according to our\nmeasurement would be something under two acres.\nBesides the above reasons, the Romans may likely enough have thought\nthat it was not so much the quantity of the land allotted as its\ncareful cultivation that would make it suffice. It is very necessary,\nhowever, that every colony should have common pasturage where all may\nsend their cattle to graze, as well as woods where they may cut fuel;\nfor without such conveniences no colony can maintain itself.\nCHAPTER VIII.\u2014_Why certain Nations leave their ancestral Seats and\noverflow the Countries of others_.\nHaving spoken above of the methods followed by the Romans in making\nwar, and related how the Etruscans were attacked by the Gauls, it seems\nto me not foreign to these topics to explain that of wars there are two\nkinds. One kind of war has its origin in the ambition of princes or\nrepublics who seek to extend their dominions. Such were the wars waged\nby Alexander the Great, and by the Romans, and such are those which we\nsee every day carried on by one potentate against another. Wars of this\nsort have their dangers, but do not utterly extirpate the inhabitants\nof a country; what the conqueror seeks being merely the submission of\nthe conquered people, whom, generally speaking, he suffers to retain\ntheir laws, and always their houses and goods.\nThe other species of war is when an entire people, with all the\nfamilies of which it is made up, being driven out by famine or defeat,\nremoves from its former seat, and goes in search of a new abode and a\nnew country, not simply with the view to establish dominion over it,\nbut to possess it as its own, and to expel or exterminate the former\ninhabitants. Of this most terrible and cruel species of warfare Sallust\nspeaks at the end of his history of the war with Jugurtha, where in\nmentioning that after the defeat of Jugurtha the movement of the Gauls\ninto Italy began to be noticed, he observes that \u201c_in the wars of the\nRomans with other nations the struggle was for mastery; but that always\nin their wars with the Gauls the struggle on both sides was for life_.\u201d\nFor a prince or commonwealth, when attacking another State, will be\ncontent to rid themselves of those only who are at the head of affairs;\nbut an entire people, set in motion in the manner described, must\ndestroy all who oppose them, since their object is to subsist on that\nwhereon those whom they invade have hitherto subsisted.\nThe Romans had to pass through three of these desperate wars; the first\nbeing that in which their city was actually captured by those Gauls\nwho, as already mentioned, had previously taken Lombardy from the\nEtruscans and made it their seat, and for whose invasion Titus Livius\nhas assigned two causes. First, that they were attracted, as I have\nsaid before, by the fruitful soil and by the wine of Italy which they\nhad not in Gaul; second, that their population having multiplied so\ngreatly that they could no longer find wherewithal to live on at home,\nthe princes of their land decided that certain of their number should\ngo forth to seek a new abode; and so deciding, chose as leaders of\nthose who were to go, two Gaulish chiefs, Bellovesus and Siccovesus;\nthe former of whom came into Italy while the latter passed into Spain.\nFrom the immigration under Bellovesus resulted the occupation of\nLombardy, and, subsequently, the first war of the Gauls with Rome. At a\nlater date, and after the close of the first war with Carthage, came\nthe second Gallic invasion, when more than two hundred thousand Gauls\nperished in battle between Piombino and Pisa. The third of these wars\nbroke out on the descent into Italy of the Todi and Cimbri, who, after\ndefeating several Roman armies, were themselves defeated by Marius.\nIn these three most dangerous contests the arms of Rome prevailed; but\nno ordinary valour was needed for their success. For we see afterwards,\nwhen the spirit of the Romans had declined, and their armies had lost\ntheir former excellence, their supremacy was overthrown by men of the\nsame race, that is to say by the Goths, the Vandals, and others like\nthem, who spread themselves over the whole of the Western Empire.\nNations such as these, quit, as I have said, their native land, when\nforced by famine, or by defeat in domestic wars, to seek a new\nhabitation elsewhere. When those thus driven forth are in large\nnumbers, they violently invade the territories of other nations,\nslaughtering the inhabitants, seizing on their possessions, founding\nnew kingdoms, and giving new names to provinces; as was done by Moses,\nand by those tribes who overran the Roman Empire. For the new names\nwhich we find in Italy and elsewhere, have no other origin than in\ntheir having been given by these new occupants; as when the countries\nformerly known as Gallia Cisalpina and Gallia Transalpina took the\nnames of Lombardy and France, from the Lombards and the Franks who\nsettled themselves there. In the same way Sclavonia was formerly known\nas Illyria, Hungary as Pannonia, and England as Britain; while many\nother provinces which it would be tedious to enumerate, have similarly\nchanged their designations; as when the name Jud\u00e6a was given by Moses\nto that part of Syria of which he took possession.\nAnd since I have said above that nations such as those I have been\ndescribing, are often driven by wars from their ancestral homes, and\nforced to seek a new country elsewhere, I shall cite the instance of\nthe Maurusians, a people who anciently dwelt in Syria, but hearing of\nthe inroad of the Hebrews, and thinking themselves unable to resist\nthem, chose rather to seek safety in flight than to perish with their\ncountry in a vain effort to defend it. For which reason, removing with\ntheir families, they went to Africa, where, after driving out the\nnative inhabitants, they took up their abode; and although they could\nnot defend their own country, were able to possess themselves of a\ncountry belonging to others. And Procopius, who writes the history of\nthe war which Belisarius conducted against those Vandals who seized on\nAfrica, relates, that on certain pillars standing in places where the\nMaurusians once dwelt, he had read inscriptions in these words: \u201c_We\nMaurusians who fled before Joshua, the robber, the son of Nun_;\u201d[7]\ngiving us to know the cause of their quitting Syria. Be this as it may,\nnations thus driven forth by a supreme necessity, are, if they be in\ngreat number, in the highest degree dangerous, and cannot be\nsuccessfully withstood except by a people who excel in arms.\n[7] Nos Maurusii qui fugimus a facie Jesu latronis filii Nav\u00e6.\n_Procop. Hist. Bell. Vand. II._\nWhen those constrained to abandon their homes are not in large numbers,\nthey are not so dangerous as the nations of whom I have been speaking,\nsince they cannot use the same violence, but must trust to their\naddress to procure them a habitation; and, after procuring it, must\nlive with their neighbours as friends and companions, as we find \u00c6neas,\nDido, the Massilians, and others like them to have lived; all of whom\ncontrived to maintain themselves in the districts in which they\nsettled, by securing the good will of the neighbouring nations.\nAlmost all the great emigrations of nations have been and continue to\nbe from the cold and barren region of Scythia, because from the\npopulation there being excessive, and the soil ill able to support\nthem, they are forced to quit their home, many causes operating to\ndrive them forth and none to keep them back. And if, for the last five\nhundred years, it has not happened that any of these nations has\nactually overrun another country, there are various reasons to account\nfor it. First, the great clearance which that region made of its\ninhabitants during the decline of the Roman Empire, when more than\nthirty nations issued from it in succession; and next, the circumstance\nthat the countries of Germany and Hungary, whence also these nations\ncame, are now so much improved that men can live there in comfort, and\nconsequently are not constrained to shift their habitations. Besides\nwhich, since these countries are occupied by a very warlike race, they\nserve as a sort of bulwark to keep back the neighbouring Scythians, who\nfor this reason do not venture to attack them, nor attempt to force a\npassage. Nevertheless, movements on a great scale have oftentimes been\nbegun by the Tartars, and been at once withstood by the Hungarians and\nPoles, whose frequent boast it is, that but for them, Italy and the\nChurch would more than once have felt the weight of the Tartar arms.\nOf the nations of whom I have been speaking, I shall now say no more.\nCHAPTER IX.\u2014_Of the Causes which commonly give rise to Wars between\nStates_.\nThe occasion which led to war between the Romans and Samnites, who for\nlong had been in league with one another, is of common occurrence in\nall powerful States, being either brought about by accident, or else\npurposely contrived by some one who would set war a-foot. As between\nthe Romans and the Samnites, the occasion of war was accidental. For in\nmaking war upon the Sidicinians and afterwards on the Campanians, the\nSamnites had no thought of involving themselves with the Romans. But\nthe Campanians being overpowered, and, contrary to the expectation of\nRomans and Samnites alike, resorting to Rome for aid, the Romans, on\nwhose protection they threw themselves, were forced to succour them as\ndependants, and to accept a war which, it seemed to them, they could\nnot with honour decline. For though they might have thought it\nunreasonable to be called on to defend the Campanians as friends\nagainst their own friends the Samnites, it seemed to them shameful not\nto defend them as subjects, or as a people who had placed themselves\nunder their protection. For they reasoned that to decline their defence\nwould close the gate against all others who at any future time might\ndesire to submit themselves to their power. And, accordingly, since\nglory and empire, and not peace, were the ends which they always had in\nview, it became impossible for them to refuse this protectorship.\nA similar circumstance gave rise to the first war with the\nCarthaginians, namely the protectorate assumed by the Romans of the\ncitizens of Messina in Sicily, and this likewise came about by chance.\nBut the second war with Carthage was not the result of chance. For\nHannibal the Carthaginian general attacked the Saguntans, who were the\nfriends of Rome in Spain, not from any desire to injure them, but in\norder to set the arms of Rome in motion, and so gain an opportunity of\nengaging the Romans in a war, and passing on into Italy. This method of\npicking a quarrel is constantly resorted to by powerful States when\nthey are bound by scruples of honour or like considerations. For if I\ndesire to make war on a prince with whom I am under an ancient and\nbinding treaty, I shall find some colour or pretext for attacking the\nfriend of that prince, very well knowing that when I attack his friend,\neither the prince will resent it, when my scheme for engaging him in\nwar will be realized; or that, should he not resent it, his weakness or\nbaseness in not defending one who is under his protection will be made\napparent; either of which alternatives will discredit him, and further\nmy designs.\nWe are to note, therefore, in connection with this submission of the\nCampanians, what has just now been said as to provoking another power\nto war; and also the remedy open to a State which, being unequal to its\nown defence, is prepared to go all lengths to ruin its assailant,\u2014that\nremedy being to give itself up unreservedly to some one whom it selects\nfor its defender; as the Campanians gave themselves up to the Romans,\nand as the Florentines gave themselves up to King Robert of Naples,\nwho, after refusing to defend them as his friends against Castruccio of\nLucca by whom they were hard pressed, defended them as his subjects.\nCHAPTER X.\u2014_That contrary to the vulgar opinion, Money is not the\nSinews of War_.\nSince any man may begin a war at his pleasure, but cannot at his\npleasure bring it to a close, a prince before he engages in any warlike\nenterprise ought to measure his strength and govern himself\naccordingly. But he must be prudent enough not to deceive himself as to\nhis strength, which he will always do, if he measure it by money, by\nadvantage of position, or by the good-will of his subjects, while he is\nunprovided with an army of his own. These are things which may swell\nyour strength but do not constitute it, being in themselves null and of\nno avail without an army on which you can depend.\nWithout such an army no amount of money will meet your wants, the\nnatural strength of your country will not protect you, and the fidelity\nand attachment of your subjects will not endure, since it is impossible\nthat they should continue true to you when you cannot defend them.\nLakes, and mountains, and the most inaccessible strongholds, where\nvaliant defenders are wanting, become no better than the level plain;\nand money, so far from being a safeguard, is more likely to leave you a\nprey to your enemy; since nothing can be falser than the vulgar opinion\nwhich affirms it to be the sinews of war.\nThis opinion is put forward by Quintus Curtius, where, in speaking of\nthe war between Antipater the Macedonian and the King of Sparta, he\nrelates that the latter, from want of money, was constrained to give\nbattle and was defeated; whereas, could he have put off fighting for a\nfew days the news of Alexander\u2019s death would have reached Greece, and\nhe might have had a victory without a battle. But lacking money, and\nfearing that on that account his soldiers might desert him, he was\nforced to hazard an engagement. It was for this reason that Quintus\nCurtius declared money to be the sinews of war, a maxim every day cited\nand acted upon by princes less wise than they should be. For building\nupon this, they think it enough for their defence to have laid up great\ntreasures; not reflecting that were great treasures all that is needed\nfor victory, Darius of old had conquered Alexander, the Greeks the\nRomans, and in our own times Charles of Burgundy the Swiss; while the\npope and the Florentines together would have had little difficulty in\ndefeating Francesco Maria, nephew of Pope Julius II., in the recent war\nof Urbino; and yet, in every one of these instances, the victory\nremained with him who held the sinews of war to consist, not in money,\nbut in good soldiers.\nCroesus, king of Lydia, after showing Solon the Athenian much besides,\nat last displayed to him the boundless riches of his treasure-house,\nand asked him what he thought of his power. Whereupon Solon answered\nthat he thought him no whit more powerful in respect of these\ntreasures, for as war is made with iron and not with gold, another\ncoming with more iron might carry off his gold. After the death of\nAlexander the Great a tribe of Gauls, passing through Greece on their\nway into Asia, sent envoys to the King of Macedonia to treat for terms\nof accord; when the king, to dismay them by a display of his resources,\nshowed them great store of gold and silver. But these barbarians, when\nthey saw all this wealth, in their greed to possess it, though before\nthey had looked on peace as settled, broke off negotiations; and thus\nthe king was ruined by those very treasures he had amassed for his\ndefence. In like manner, not many years ago, the Venetians, with a full\ntreasury, lost their whole dominions without deriving the least\nadvantage from their wealth.\nI maintain, therefore, that it is not gold, as is vulgarly supposed,\nthat is the sinews of war, but good soldiers; or while gold by itself\nwill not gain you good soldiers, good soldiers may readily get you\ngold. Had the Romans chosen to make war with gold rather than with iron\nall the treasures of the earth would not have sufficed them having\nregard to the greatness of their enterprises and the difficulties they\nhad to overcome in carrying them out. But making their wars with iron\nthey never felt any want of gold; for those who stood in fear of them\nbrought gold into their camp.\nAnd supposing it true that the Spartan king was forced by lack of money\nto risk the chances of a battle, it only fared with him in respect of\nmoney as it has often fared with others from other causes; since we see\nthat where an army is in such straits for want of victual that it must\neither fight or perish by famine, it will always fight, as being the\nmore honourable course and that on which fortune may in some way smile.\nSo, too, it has often happened that a captain, seeing his enemy about\nto be reinforced, has been obliged either to trust to fortune and at\nonce deliver battle, or else, waiting till the reinforcement is\ncomplete, to fight then, whether he will or no, and at whatever\ndisadvantage. We find also, as in the case of Hasdrubal when beset, in\nthe March of Ancona, at once by Claudius Nero and by the other Roman\nconsul, that a captain, when he must either fight or fly, will always\nfight, since it will seem to him that by this course, however\nhazardous, he has at least a chance of victory, while by the other his\nruin is certain.\nThere are many circumstances, therefore, which may force a captain to\ngive battle contrary to his intention, among which the want of money\nmay sometimes be one. But this is no ground for pronouncing money to be\nthe sinews of war, any more than those other things from the want of\nwhich men are reduced to the same necessity. Once more, therefore, I\nrepeat that not gold but good soldiers constitute the sinews of war.\nMoney, indeed, is most necessary in a secondary place; but this\nnecessity good soldiers will always be able to supply, since it is as\nimpossible that good soldiers should lack money, as that money by\nitself should secure good soldiers. And that what I say is true is\nshown by countless passages in history. When Pericles persuaded the\nAthenians to declare war against the whole Peloponnesus, assuring them\nthat their dexterity, aided by their wealth, was sure to bring them off\nvictorious, the Athenians, though for a while they prospered in this\nwar, in the end were overpowered, the prudent counsels and good\nsoldiers of Sparta proving more than a match for the dexterity and\nwealth of Athens. But, indeed, there can be no better witness to the\ntruth of my contention than Titus Livius himself. For in that passage\nof his history wherein he discusses whether if Alexander the Great had\ninvaded Italy, he would have succeeded in vanquishing the Romans, three\nthings are noted by him as essential to success in war; to wit, many\nand good soldiers, prudent captains, and favourable fortune; and after\nexamining whether the Romans or Alexander would have had the advantage\nin each of these three particulars, he arrives at his conclusion\nwithout any mention of money.\nThe Campanians, therefore, when asked by the Sidicinians to arm in\ntheir behalf, must have measured their strength by wealth and not by\nsoldiers; for after declaring in their favour and suffering two\ndefeats, to save themselves they were obliged to become tributary to\nRome.\nCHAPTER XI.\u2014_That it were unwise to ally yourself a Prince who has\nReputation rather than Strength._\nTo mark the mistake made by the Sidicinians in trusting to the\nprotection of the Campanians, and by the Campanians in supposing\nthemselves able to protect the Sidicinians, Titus Livius could not have\nexpressed himself in apter words than by saying, that \u201c_the Campanians\nrather lent their name to the Sidicinians than furnished any\nsubstantial aid towards their defence._\u201d\nHere we have to note that alliances with princes who from dwelling at a\ndistance have no facility, or who from their own embarrassments, or\nfrom other causes, have no ability to render aid, afford rather\nreputation than protection to those who put their trust in them. As was\nthe case in our own times with the Florentines, when, in the year 1479,\nthey were attacked by the Pope and the King of Naples. For being\nfriends of the French king they drew from that friendship more\nreputation than help. The same would be the case with that prince who\nshould engage in any enterprise in reliance on the Emperor Maximilian,\nhis being one of those friendships which, in the words of our\nhistorian, _nomen magis quam praesidium adferunt_.\nOn this occasion, therefore, the Campanians were misled by imagining\nthemselves stronger than they really were. For often, from defect of\njudgment, men take upon them to defend others, when they have neither\nskill nor ability to defend themselves. Of which we have a further\ninstance in the Tarentines, who, when the Roman and Samnite armies were\nalready drawn up against one another for battle, sent messengers to the\nRoman consul to acquaint him that they desired peace between the two\nnations, and would themselves declare war against whichsoever of the\ntwo first began hostilities. The consul, laughing at their threats, in\nthe presence of the messengers, ordered the signal for battle to sound,\nand bade his army advance to meet the enemy; showing the Tarentines by\nacts rather than words what answer he thought their message deserved.\nHaving spoken in the present Chapter of unwise courses followed by\nprinces for defending others, I shall speak in the next, of the methods\nthey follow in defending themselves.\nCHAPTER XII.\u2014_Whether when Invasion is imminent it is better to\nanticipate or to await it._\nI have often heard it disputed by men well versed in military affairs,\nwhether, when there are two princes of nearly equal strength, and the\nbolder of the two proclaims war upon the other, it is better for that\nother to await attack within his own frontier, or to march into the\nenemy\u2019s country and fight him there; and I have heard reasons given in\nfavour of each of these courses.\nThey who maintain that an enemy should be attacked in his own country,\ncite the advice given by Croesus to Cyrus, when the latter had come to\nthe frontiers of the Massaget\u00e6 to make war on that people. For word\nbeing sent by Tomyris their queen that Cyrus might, at his pleasure,\neither enter her dominions, where she would await him, or else allow\nher to come and meet him; and the matter being debated, Croesus,\ncontrary to the opinion of other advisers, counselled Cyrus to go\nforward and meet the queen, urging that were he to defeat her at a\ndistance from her kingdom, he might not be able to take it from her,\nsince she would have time to repair her strength; whereas, were he to\ndefeat her within her own dominions, he could follow her up on her\nflight, and, without giving her time to recover herself, deprive her of\nher State. They cite also the advice given by Hannibal to Antiochus,\nwhen the latter was meditating a war on the Romans. For Hannibal told\nhim that the Romans could not be vanquished except in Italy, where an\ninvader might turn to account the arms and resources of their friends,\nwhereas any one making war upon them out of Italy, and leaving that\ncountry in their hands, would leave them an unfailing source whence to\ndraw whatever reinforcement they might need; and finally, he told him,\nthat the Romans might more easily be deprived of Rome than of their\nempire, and of Italy more easily than of any of their other provinces.\nThey likewise instance Agathocles, who, being unequal to support a war\nat home, invaded the Carthaginians, by whom he was being attacked, and\nreduced them to sue for peace. They also cite Scipio, who to shift the\nwar from Italy, carried it into Africa.\nThose who hold a contrary opinion contend that to have your enemy at a\ndisadvantage you must get him away from his home, alleging the case of\nthe Athenians, who while they carried on the war at their convenience\nin their own territory, retained their superiority; but when they\nquitted that territory, and went with their armies to Sicily, lost\ntheir freedom. They cite also the fable of the poets wherein it is\nfigured that Ant\u00e6us, king of Libya, being assailed by the Egyptian\nHercules, could not be overcome while he awaited his adversary within\nthe bounds of his own kingdom; but so soon as he was withdrawn from\nthese by the craft of Hercules, lost his kingdom and his life. Whence\nthe fable runs that Ant\u00e6us, being son to the goddess Earth, when thrown\nto the ground drew fresh strength from the Earth, his mother; and that\nHercules, perceiving this, held him up away from the Earth.\nRecent opinions are likewise cited as favouring this view. Every one\nknows how Ferrando, king of Naples, was in his day accounted a most\nwise prince; and how two years before his death there came a rumour\nthat Charles VIII of France was meditating an attack upon him; and how,\nafter making great preparations for his defence, he sickened; and being\non the point of death, among other counsels left his son Alfonso this\nadvice, that nothing in the world should tempt him to pass out of his\nown territory, but to await the enemy within his frontier, and with his\nforces unimpaired; a warning disregarded by Alfonso, who sent into\nRomagna an army, which he lost, and with it his whole dominions,\nwithout a battle.\nOther arguments on both sides of the question in addition to those\nalready noticed, are as follows: He who attacks shows higher courage\nthan he who stands on his defence, and this gives his army greater\nconfidence. Moreover, by attacking your enemy you deprive him of many\nopportunities for using his resources, since he can receive no aid from\nsubjects who have been stripped of their possessions; and when an enemy\nis at his gates, a prince must be careful how he levies money and\nimposes taxes; so that, as Hannibal said, the springs which enable a\ncountry to support a war come to be dried up. Again, the soldiers of an\ninvader, finding themselves in a foreign land, are under a stronger\nnecessity to fight, and necessity, as has often been said, is the\nparent of valour.\nOn the other hand, it may be argued that there are many advantages to\nbe gained by awaiting the attack of your enemy. For without putting\nyourself much about, you may harass him by intercepting his supplies,\nwhether of victual or of whatsoever else an army stands in need: from\nyour better knowledge of the country you can impede his movements; and\nbecause men muster more willingly to defend their homes than to go on\ndistant expeditions, you can meet him with more numerous forces, if\ndefeated you can more easily repair your strength, because the bulk of\nyour army, finding shelter at hand, will be able to save itself, and\nyour reserves will have no distance to come. In this way you can use\nyour whole strength without risking your entire fortunes; whereas, in\nleaving your country, you risk your entire fortunes, without putting\nforth your whole strength. Nay, we find that to weaken an adversary\nstill further, some have suffered him to make a march of several days\ninto their country, and then to capture certain of their towns, that by\nleaving garrisons in these, he might reduce the numbers of his army,\nand so be attacked at greater disadvantage.\nBut now to speak my own mind on the matter, I think we should make this\ndistinction. Either you have your country strongly defended, as the\nRomans had and the Swiss have theirs, or, like the Carthaginians of old\nand the King of France and the Italians at the present day, you have it\nundefended. In the latter case you must keep the enemy at a distance\nfrom your country, for as your strength lies not in men but in money,\nwhenever the supply of money is cut off you are undone, and nothing so\nsoon cuts off this supply as a war of invasion. Of which we have\nexample in the Carthaginians, who, while their country was free from\ninvasion, were able by means of their great revenues to carry on war in\nItaly against the Romans, but when they were invaded could not defend\nthemselves even against Agathocles. The Florentines, in like manner,\ncould make no head against Castruccio, lord of Lucca, when he attacked\nthem in their own country; and to obtain protection, were compelled to\nyield themselves up to King Robert of Naples. And yet, after\nCastruccio\u2019s death, these same Florentines were bold enough to attack\nthe Duke of Milan in his own country, and strong enough to strip him of\nhis dominions. Such valour did they display in distant wars, such\nweakness in those that were near.\nBut when a country is armed as Rome was and Switzerland now is, the\ncloser you press it, the harder it is to subdue; because such States\ncan assemble a stronger force to resist attack than for attacking\nothers. Nor does the great authority of Hannibal move me in this\ninstance, since resentment and his own advantage might lead him to\nspeak as he spoke to Antiochus. For had the Romans suffered in Gaul,\nand within the same space of time, those three defeats at the hands of\nHannibal which they suffered in Italy, it must have made an end of\nthem; since they could not have turned the remnants of their armies to\naccount as they did in Italy, not having the same opportunity for\nrepairing their strength; nor could they have met their enemy with such\nnumerous armies. For we never find them sending forth a force of more\nthan fifty thousand men for the invasion of any province; whereas, in\ndefending their own country against the inroad of the Gauls at the end\nof the first Carthaginian war, we hear of them bringing some eighteen\nhundred thousand men into the field; and their failure to vanquish the\nGauls in Lombardy as they had vanquished those in Tuscany arose from\ntheir inability to lead a great force so far against a numerous enemy,\nor to encounter him with the same advantages. In Germany the Cimbrians\nrouted a Roman army who had there no means to repair their disaster;\nbut when they came into Italy, the Romans could collect their whole\nstrength, and destroy them. Out of their native country, whence they\ncan bring no more than thirty or forty thousand men, the Swiss may\nreadily be defeated; but in their own country, where they can assemble\na hundred thousand, they are well-nigh invincible.\nIn conclusion, therefore, I repeat that the prince who has his people\narmed and trained for war, should always await a great and dangerous\nwar at home, and never go forth to meet it. But that he whose subjects\nare unarmed, and whose country is not habituated to war, should always\ncarry the war to as great a distance as he can from home. For in this\nway each will defend himself in the best manner his means admit.\nCHAPTER XIII.\u2014_That Men rise from humble to high Fortunes rather by\nFraud than by Force._\nI hold it as most certain that men seldom if ever rise to great place\nfrom small beginnings without using fraud or force, unless, indeed,\nthey be given, or take by inheritance the place to which some other has\nalready come. Force, however, will never suffice by itself to effect\nthis end, while fraud often will, as any one may plainly see who reads\nthe lives of Philip of Macedon, Agathocles of Sicily, and many others\nlike them, who from the lowest or, at any rate, from very low\nbeginnings, rose either to sovereignty or to the highest command.\nThis necessity for using deceit is taught by Xenophon in his life of\nCyrus; for the very first expedition on which Cyrus is sent, against\nthe King of Armenia, is seen to teem with fraud; and it is by fraud,\nand not by force, that he is represented as having acquired his\nkingdom; so that the only inference to be drawn from his conduct, as\nXenophon describes it, is, that the prince who would accomplish great\nthings must have learned how to deceive. Xenophon, moreover, represents\nhis hero as deceiving his maternal grandsire Cyaxares, king of the\nMedians, in a variety of ways; giving it to be understood that without\nsuch deceit he could not have reached the greatness to which he came.\nNor do I believe that any man born to humble fortunes can be shown to\nhave attained great station, by sheer and open force, whereas this has\noften been effected by mere fraud, such as that used by Giovanni\nGaleazzo to deprive his uncle Bernabo of the State and government of\nLombardy.\nThe same arts which princes are constrained to use at the outset of\ntheir career, must also be used by commonwealths, until they have grown\npowerful enough to dispense with them and trust to strength alone. And\nbecause Rome at all times, whether from chance or choice, followed all\nsuch methods as are necessary to attain greatness, in this also she was\nnot behindhand. And, to begin with, she could have used no greater\nfraud than was involved in her method above noticed, of making for\nherself companions; since under this name she made for herself\nsubjects, for such the Latins and the other surrounding nations, in\nfact, became. For availing herself at first of their arms to subdue\nneighbouring countries and gain herself reputation as a State, her\npower was so much increased by these conquests that there was none whom\nshe could not overcome. But the Latins never knew that they were\nenslaved until they saw the Samnites twice routed and forced to make\nterms. This success, while it added greatly to the fame of the Romans\namong princes at a distance, who were thereby made familiar with the\nRoman name though not with the Roman arms, bred at the same time\njealousy and distrust among those who, like the Latins, both saw and\nfelt these arms; and such were the effects of this jealousy and\ndistrust, that not the Latins only but all the Roman colonies in\nLatium, along with the Campanians whom a little while before the Romans\nhad defended leagued themselves together against the authority of Rome.\nThis war was set on foot by the Latins in the manner in which, as I\nhave already explained, most wars are begun, not by directly attacking\nthe Romans, but by defending the Sidicinians against the Samnites who\nwere making war upon them with the permission of the Romans. And that\nit was from their having found out the crafty policy of the Romans that\nthe Latins were led to take this step, is plain from the words which\nTitus Livius puts in the mouth of Annius Setinus the Latin pr\u00e6tor, who,\nin addressing the Latin council, is made to say, \u201c_For if even now we\ncan put up with slavery under the disguise of an equal alliance, etc_\u201d\nWe see, therefore, that the Romans, from the time they first began to\nextend their power, were not unfamiliar with the art of deceiving, an\nart always necessary for those who would mount to great heights from\nlow beginnings; and which is the less to be condemned when, as in the\ncase of the Romans, it is skilfully concealed.\nCHAPTER XIV.\u2014_That Men often err in thinking they can subdue Pride by\nHumility._\nYou shall often find that humility is not merely of no service to you,\nbut is even hurtful, especially when used in dealing with insolent men,\nwho, through envy or other like cause, have conceived hatred against\nyou. Proof whereof is supplied by our historian where he explains the\ncauses of this war between the Romans and the Latins. For on the\nSamnites complaining to the Romans that the Latins had attacked them,\nthe Romans, desiring not to give the Latins ground of offence, would\nnot forbid them proceeding with the war. But the endeavour to avoid\ngiving offence to the Latins only served to increase their confidence,\nand led them the sooner to declare their hostility. Of which we have\nevidence in the language used by the same Latin Pr\u00e6tor, Annius Setinus,\nat the aforesaid council, when he said:\u2014\u201c_You have tried their patience\nby refusing them, soldiers. Who doubts but that they are offended?\nStill they have put up with the affront. They have heard that we are\nassembling an army against their allies the Samnites; and yet they have\nnot stirred from their city. Whence this astonishing forbearance, but\nfrom their knowing our strength and their own weakness_?\u201d Which words\ngive us clearly to understand how much the patience of the Romans\nincreased the arrogance of the Latins.\nA prince, therefore, should never stoop from his dignity, nor should he\nif he would have credit for any concession make it voluntarily, unless\nhe be able or believe himself able to withhold it. For almost always\nwhen matters have come to such a pass that you cannot give way with\ncredit it is better that a thing be taken from you by force than\nyielded through fear of force. For if you yield through fear and to\nescape war, the chances are that you do not escape it; since he to\nwhom, out of manifest cowardice you make this concession, will not rest\ncontent, but will endeavour to wring further concessions from you, and\nmaking less account of you, will only be the more kindled against you.\nAt the same time you will find your friends less zealous on your\nbehalf, since to them you will appear either weak or cowardly. But if,\nso soon as the designs of your enemy are disclosed, you at once prepare\nto resist though your strength be inferior to his, he will begin to\nthink more of you, other neighbouring princes will think more; and many\nwill be willing to assist you, on seeing you take up arms, who, had you\nrelinquished hope and abandoned yourself to despair, would never have\nstirred a finger to save you.\nThe above is to be understood as applying where you have a single\nadversary only; but should you have several, it will always be a\nprudent course, even after war has been declared, to restore to some\none of their number something you have of his, so as to regain his\nfriendship and detach him from the others who have leagued themselves\nagainst you.\nCHAPTER XV.\u2014That weak States are always dubious in their Resolves; and\nthat tardy Resolves are always hurtful.\nTouching this very matter, and with regard to these earliest beginnings\nof war between the Latins and the Romans, it may be noted, that in all\nour deliberations it behoves us to come quickly to a definite resolve,\nand not to remain always in dubiety and suspense. This is plainly seen\nin connection with the council convened by the Latins when they thought\nto separate themselves from the Romans. For the Romans suspecting the\nhostile humour wherewith the Latins were infected, in order to learn\nhow things really stood, and see whether they could not win back the\nmalcontents without recourse to arms, gave them to know that they must\nsend eight of their citizens to Rome, as they had occasion to consult\nwith them. On receiving which message the Latins, knowing that they had\ndone many things contrary to the wishes of the Romans, called a council\nto determine who of their number should be sent, and to instruct them\nwhat they were to say. But Annius, their pr\u00e6tor, being present in the\ncouncil when these matters were being discussed, told them \u201c_that he\nthought it of far greater moment for them to consider what they were to\ndo than what they were to say; for when their resolves were formed, it\nwould be easy to clothe them in fit words_.\u201d This, in truth, was sound\nadvice and such as every prince and republic should lay to heart.\nBecause, where there is doubt and uncertainty as to what we may decide\non doing, we know not how to suit our words to our conduct; whereas,\nwith our minds made up, and the course we are to follow fixed, it is an\neasy matter to find words to declare our resolves. I have noticed this\npoint the more readily, because I have often found such uncertainty\nhinder the public business of our own republic, to its detriment and\ndiscredit. And in all matters of difficulty, wherein courage is needed\nfor resolving, this uncertainty will always be met with, whenever those\nwho have to deliberate and decide are weak.\nNot less mischievous than doubtful resolves are those which are late\nand tardy, especially when they have to be made in behalf of a friend.\nFor from their lateness they help none, and hurt ourselves. Tardy\nresolves are due to want of spirit or want of strength, or to the\nperversity of those who have to determine, who being moved by a secret\ndesire to overthrow the government, or to carry out some selfish\npurpose of their own, suffer no decision to be come to, but only thwart\nand hinder. Whereas, good citizens, even when they see the popular mind\nto be bent on dangerous courses, will never oppose the adoption of a\nfixed plan, more particularly in matters which do not brook delay.\nAfter Hieronymus, the Syracusan tyrant, was put to death, there being\nat that time a great war between the Romans and the Carthaginians, the\ncitizens of Syracuse fell to disputing among themselves with which\nnation they should take part; and so fierce grew the controversy\nbetween the partisans of the two alliances, that no course could be\nagreed on, and they took part with neither; until Apollonides, one of\nthe foremost of the Syracusan citizens, told them in a speech replete\nwith wisdom, that neither those who inclined to hold by the Romans, nor\nthose who chose rather to side with the Carthaginians, were deserving\nof blame; but that what was utterly to be condemned was doubt and delay\nin taking one side or other; for from such uncertainty he clearly\nforesaw the ruin of their republic; whereas, by taking a decided\ncourse, whatever it might be, some good might come. Now Titus Livius\ncould not show more clearly than he does in this passage, the mischief\nwhich results from resting in suspense. He shows it, likewise, in the\ncase of the Lavinians, of whom he relates, that being urged by the\nLatins to aid them against Rome, they were so long in making up their\nminds, that when the army which they at last sent to succour the Latins\nwas issuing from their gates, word came that the Latins were defeated.\nWhereupon Millionius, their pr\u00e6tor, said, \u201c_With the Romans this short\nmarch will cost us dear_.\u201d But had the Lavinians resolved at once\neither to grant aid or to refuse it, taking a latter course they would\nnot have given offence to the Romans, taking the former, and rendering\ntimely help, they and the Latins together might have had a victory. But\nby delay they stood to lose in every way, as the event showed.\nThis example, had it been remembered by the Florentines, might have\nsaved them from all that loss and vexation which they underwent at the\nhands of the French, at the time King Louis XII. of France came into\nItaly against Lodovico, duke of Milan. For when Louis first proposed to\npass through Tuscany he met with no objection from the Florentines,\nwhose envoys at his court arranged with him that they should stand\nneutral, while the king, on his arrival in Italy, was to maintain their\ngovernment and take them under his protection; a month\u2019s time being\nallowed the republic to ratify these terms. But certain persons, who,\nin their folly, favoured the cause of Lodovico, delayed this\nratification until the king was already on the eve of victory; when the\nFlorentines suddenly becoming eager to ratify, the king would not\naccept their ratification, perceiving their consent to be given under\nconstraint and not of their own good-will. This cost the city of\nFlorence dear, and went near to lose her freedom, whereof she was\nafterwards deprived on another like occasion. And the course taken by\nthe Florentines was the more to be blamed in that it was of no sort of\nservice to Duke Lodovico, who, had he been victorious, would have shown\nthe Florentines many more signs of his displeasure than did the king.\nAlthough the hurt which results to republics from weakness of this sort\nhas already been discussed in another Chapter, nevertheless, since an\nopportunity offered for touching upon it again, I have willingly\navailed myself of it, because to me it seems a matter of which\nrepublics like ours should take special heed.\nCHAPTER XVI.\u2014_That the Soldiers of our days depart widely from the\nmethods of ancient Warfare._\nIn all their wars with other nations, the most momentous battle ever\nfought by the Romans, was that which they fought with the Latins when\nTorquatus and Decius were consuls. For it may well be believed that as\nby the loss of that battle the Latins became subject to the Romans, so\nthe Romans had they not prevailed must have become subject to the\nLatins. And Titus Livius is of this opinion, since he represents the\narmies as exactly equal in every respect, in discipline and in valour,\nin numbers and in obstinacy, the only difference he draws being, that\nof the two armies the Romans had the more capable commanders. We find,\nhowever, two circumstances occurring in the conduct of this battle, the\nlike of which never happened before, and seldom since, namely, that to\ngive steadiness to the minds of their soldiers, and render them\nobedient to the word of command and resolute to fight, one of the\nconsuls put himself, and the other his son, to death.\nThe equality which Titus Livius declares to have prevailed in these two\narmies, arose from this, that having long served together they used the\nsame language, discipline, and arms; that in disposing their men for\nbattle they followed the same system; and that the divisions and\nofficers of their armies bore the same names. It was necessary,\ntherefore, that as they were of equal strength and valour, something\nextraordinary should take place to render the courage of the one army\nmore stubborn and unflinching than that of the other, it being on this\nstubbornness, as I have already said, that victory depends. For while\nthis temper is maintained in the minds of the combatants they will\nnever turn their backs on their foe. And that it might endure longer in\nthe minds of the Romans than of the Latins, partly chance, and partly\nthe valour of the consuls caused it to fall out that Torquatus slew his\nson, and Decius died by his own hand.\nIn pointing out this equality of strength, Titus Livius takes occasion\nto explain the whole system followed by the Romans in the ordering of\ntheir armies and in disposing them for battle; and as he has treated\nthe subject at length, I need not go over the same ground, and shall\ntouch only on what I judge in it most to deserve attention, but, being\noverlooked by all the captains of our times, has led to disorder in\nmany armies and in many battles.\nFrom this passage of Titus Livius, then, we learn that the Roman army\nhad three principal divisions, or battalions as we might now call them,\nof which they named the first _hastati_, the second _principes_, and\nthe third _triarii_, to each of which cavalry were attached. In\narraying an army for battle they set the _hastati_ in front. Directly\nbehind them, in the second rank, they placed the _principes_; and in\nthe third rank of the same column, the _triarii_. The cavalry of each\nof these three divisions they disposed to the right and left of the\ndivision to which it belonged; and to these companies of horse, from\ntheir form and position, they gave the name wings (_al\u00e6_), from their\nappearing like the two wings of the main body of the army. The first\ndivision, the _hastati_, which was in front, they drew up in close\norder to enable it to withstand and repulse the enemy. The second\ndivision, the _principes_, since it was not to be engaged from the\nbeginning, but was meant to succour the first in case that were driven\nin, was not formed in close order but kept in open file, so that it\nmight receive the other into its ranks whenever it was broken and\nforced to retire. The third division, that, namely, of the _triarii_,\nhad its ranks still more open than those of the second, so that, if\noccasion required, it might receive the first two divisions of the\n_hastati_ and _principes_. These divisions, therefore, being drawn up\nin this order, the engagement began, and if the _hastati_ were\noverpowered and driven back, they retired within the loose ranks of the\n_principes_, when both these divisions, being thus united into one,\nrenewed the conflict. If these, again, were routed and forced back,\nthey retreated within the open ranks of the _triarii_, and all three\ndivisions, forming into one, once more renewed the fight, in which, if\nthey were overpowered, since they had no further means of recruiting\ntheir strength, they lost the battle. And because whenever this last\ndivision, of the _triarii_, had to be employed, the army was in\njeopardy, there arose the proverb, \u201c_Res redacta est ad triarios_,\u201d\nequivalent to our expression of _playing a last stake_.\nThe captains of our day, as they have abandoned all the other customs\nof antiquity, and pay no heed to any part of the ancient discipline, so\nalso have discarded this method of disposing their men, though it was\none of no small utility. For to insure the defeat of a commander who so\narranges his forces as to be able thrice during an engagement to renew\nhis strength, Fortune must thrice declare against him, and he must be\nmatched with an adversary able three times over to defeat him; whereas\nhe whose sole chance of success lies in his surviving the first onset,\nas is the case with all the armies of Christendom at the present day,\nmay easily be vanquished, since any slight mishap, and the least\nfailure in the steadiness of his men, may deprive him of victory.\nAnd what takes from our armies the capacity to renew their strength is,\nthat provision is now no longer made for one division being received\ninto the ranks of another, which happens because at present an army is\narranged for battle in one or other of two imperfect methods. For\neither its divisions are placed side by side, so as to form a line of\ngreat width but of no depth or solidity; or if, to strengthen it, it be\ndrawn up in columns after the fashion of the Roman armies, should the\nfront line be broken, no provision having been made for its being\nreceived by the second, it is thrown into complete disorder, and both\ndivisions fall to pieces. For if the front line be driven back, it\njostles the second, if the second line endeavour to advance, the first\nstands in its way: and thus, the first driving against the second, and\nthe second against the third, such confusion follows that often the\nmost trifling accident will cause the ruin of an entire army.\nAt the battle of Ravenna, where M. de Foix, the French commander, was\nslain, although according to modern notions this was a well-fought\nfield, both the French and the Spanish armies were drawn up in the\nfirst of the faulty methods above described; that is to say, each army\nadvanced with the whole of its battalions side by side, so that each\npresented a single front much wider than deep; this being always the\nplan followed by modern armies when, as at Ravenna, the ground is open.\nFor knowing the disorder they fall into on retreat, forming themselves\nin a single line, they endeavour, as I have said, as much as possible\nto escape confusion by extending their front. But where the ground\nconfines them they fall at once into the disorder spoken of, without an\neffort to prevent it.\nTroops traversing an enemy\u2019s country, whether to pillage or carry out\nany other operation of war, are liable to fall into the same disorder;\nand at S. Regolo in the Pisan territory, and at other places where the\nFlorentines were beaten by the Pisans during the war which followed on\nthe revolt of Pisa after the coming of Charles of France into Italy,\nour defeat was due to no other cause than the behaviour of our own\ncavalry, who being posted in front, and being repulsed by the enemy,\nfell back on the infantry and threw them into confusion, whereupon the\nwhole army took to flight; and Messer Ciriaco del Borgo, the veteran\nleader of the Florentine foot, has often declared in my presence that\nhe had never been routed by any cavalry save those who were fighting on\nhis side. For which reason the Swiss, who are the greatest proficients\nin modern warfare, when serving with the French, make it their first\ncare to place themselves on their flank, so that the cavalry of their\nfriends, if repulsed, may not throw them into disorder.\nBut although these matters seem easy to understand and not difficult to\nput in practice, none has yet been found among the commanders of our\ntimes, who attempted to imitate the ancients or to correct the moderns.\nFor although these also have a tripartite division of their armies into\nvan-guard, main-body, and rear-guard, the only use they make of it is\nin giving orders when their men are in quarters; whereas on active\nservice it rarely happens that all divisions are not equally exposed to\nthe same onset.\nAnd because many, to excuse their ignorance, will have it that the\ndestructive fire of artillery forbids our employing at the present day\nmany of the tactics used by the ancients, I will discuss this question\nin the following Chapter, and examine whether artillery does in fact\nprevent us from using the valiant methods of antiquity.\nCHAPTER XVII.\u2014_What importance the Armies of the present day should\nallow to Artillery; and whether the commonly received opinion\nconcerning it be just._\nLooking to the number of pitched battles, or what are termed by the\nFrench _journ\u00e9es_, and by the Italians _fatti d\u2019arme_, fought by the\nRomans at divers times, I am led further to examine the generally\nreceived opinion, that had artillery been in use in their day, the\nRomans would not have been allowed, or at least not with the same ease,\nto subjugate provinces and make other nations their tributaries, and\ncould never have spread their power in the astonishing way they did.\nFor it is said that by reason of these fire-arms men can no longer use\nor display their personal valour as they could of old; that there is\ngreater difficulty now than there was in former times in joining\nbattle; that the tactics followed then cannot be followed now; and that\nin time all warfare must resolve itself into a question of artillery.\nJudging it not out of place to inquire whether these opinions are\nsound, and how far artillery has added to or taken from the strength of\narmies, and whether its use lessens or increases the opportunities for\na good captain to behave valiantly, I shall at once address myself to\nthe first of the averments noticed above, namely, that the armies of\nthe ancient Romans could not have made the conquests they did, had\nartillery then been in use.\nTo this I answer by saying that, since war is made for purposes either\nof offence or defence, we have first to see in which of these two kinds\nof warfare artillery gives the greater advantage or inflicts the\ngreater hurt. Now, though something might be said both ways, I\nnevertheless believe that artillery is beyond comparison more hurtful\nto him who stands on the defensive than to him who attacks. For he who\ndefends himself must either do so in a town or in a fortified camp. If\nwithin a town, either the town will be a small one, as fortified towns\ncommonly are, or it will be a great one. In the former case, he who is\non the defensive is at once undone. For such is the shock of artillery\nthat there is no wall so strong that in a few days it will not batter\ndown, when, unless those within have ample room to withdraw behind\ncovering works and trenches, they must be beaten; it being impossible\nfor them to resist the assault of an enemy who forces an entrance\nthrough the breaches in their walls. Nor will any artillery a defender\nmay have be of any service to him; since it is an established axiom\nthat where men are able to advance in numbers and rapidly, artillery is\npowerless to check them.\nFor this reason, in storming towns the furious assaults of the northern\nnations prove irresistible, whereas the attacks of our Italian troops,\nwho do not rush on in force, but advance to the assault in small knots\nof skirmishers (_scaramouches_, as they are fitly named), may easily be\nwithstood. Those who advance in such loose order, and with so little\nspirit, against a breach covered by artillery, advance to certain\ndestruction, and as against them artillery is useful. But when the\nassailants swarm to the breach so massed together that one pushes on\nanother, unless they be brought to a stand by ditches and earthworks,\nthey penetrate everywhere, and no artillery has any effect to keep them\nback; and though some must fall, yet not so many as to prevent a\nvictory.\nThe frequent success of the northern nations in storming towns, and\nmore particularly the recovery of Brescia by the French, is proof\nsufficient of the truth of what I say. For the town of Brescia rising\nagainst the French while the citadel still held out, the Venetians, to\nmeet any attack which might be made from the citadel upon the town,\nranged guns along the whole line of road which led from the one to the\nother, planting them in front, and in flank, and wherever else they\ncould be brought to bear. Of all which M. de Foix making no account,\ndismounted with his men-at-arms from horseback, and, advancing with\nthem on foot through the midst of the batteries, took the town; nor do\nwe learn that he sustained any considerable loss from the enemy\u2019s fire.\nSo that, as I have said, he who has to defend himself in a small town,\nwhen his walls are battered down and he has no room to retire behind\nother works, and has only his artillery to trust to, is at once undone.\nBut even where the town you defend is a great one, so that you have\nroom to fall back behind new works, artillery is still, by a long way,\nmore useful for the assailant than for the defender. For to enable your\nartillery to do any hurt to those without, you must raise yourself with\nit above the level of the ground, since, if you remain on the level,\nthe enemy, by erecting any low mound or earth-work, can so secure\nhimself that it will be impossible for you to touch him. But in raising\nyourself above the level of the ground, whether by extending yourself\nalong the gallery of the walls, or otherwise, you are exposed to two\ndisadvantages; for, first, you cannot there bring into position guns of\nthe same size or range as he who is without can bring to bear against\nyou, since it is impossible to work large guns in a confined space;\nand, secondly, although you should succeed in getting your guns into\nposition, you cannot construct such strong and solid works for their\nprotection as those can who are outside, and on level ground, and who\nhave all the room and every other advantage which they could desire. It\nis consequently impossible for him who defends a town to maintain his\nguns in position at any considerable height, when those who are outside\nhave much and powerful artillery; while, if he place it lower, it\nbecomes, as has been explained, to a great extent useless. So that in\nthe end the defence of the city has to be effected, as in ancient\ntimes, by hand to hand fighting, or else by means of the smaller kinds\nof fire-arms, from which if the defender derive some slight advantage,\nit is balanced by the injury he sustains from the great artillery of\nhis enemy, whereby the walls of the city are battered down and almost\nburied in their ditches; so that when it comes once more to an\nencounter at close quarters, by reason of his walls being demolished\nand his ditches filled up, the defender is now at a far greater\ndisadvantage than he was formerly. Wherefore I repeat that these arms\nare infinitely more useful for him who attacks a town than for him who\ndefends it.\nAs to the remaining method, which consists in your taking up your\nposition in an entrenched camp, where you need not fight unless you\nplease, and unless you have the advantage, I say that this method\ncommonly affords you no greater facility for avoiding an engagement\nthan the ancients had; nay, that sometimes, owing to the use of\nartillery, you are worse off than they were. For if the enemy fall\nsuddenly upon you, and have some slight advantage (as may readily be\nthe case from his being on higher ground, or from your works on his\narrival being still incomplete so that you are not wholly sheltered by\nthem), forthwith, and without your being able to prevent him, he\ndislodges you, and you are forced to quit your defences and deliver\nbattle: as happened to the Spaniards at the battle of Ravenna. For\nhaving posted themselves between the river Ronco and an earthwork, from\ntheir not having carried this work high enough, and from the French\nhaving a slight advantage of ground, they were forced by the fire of\nthe latter to quit their entrenchments come to an engagement.\nBut assuming the ground you have chosen for your camp to be, as it\nalways should, higher than that occupied by the enemy, and your works\nto be complete and sufficient, so that from your position and\npreparations the enemy dare not attack you, recourse will then be had\nto the very same methods as were resorted to in ancient times when an\narmy was so posted that it could not be assailed; that is to say, your\ncountry will be wasted, cities friendly to you besieged or stormed, and\nyour supplies intercepted; until you are forced, at last, of necessity\nto quit your camp and to fight a pitched battle, in which, as will\npresently appear, artillery will be of little service to you.\nIf we consider, therefore, for what ends the Romans made wars, and that\nattack and not defence was the object of almost all their campaigns, it\nwill be clear, if what I have said be true, that they would have had\nstill greater advantage, and might have achieved their conquests with\neven greater ease, had artillery been in use in their times.\nAnd as to the second complaint, that by reason of artillery men can no\nlonger display their valour as they could in ancient days, I admit it\nto be true that when they have to expose themselves a few at a time,\nmen run more risks now than formerly; as when they have to scale a town\nor perform some similar exploit, in which they are not massed together\nbut must advance singly and one behind another. It is true, also, that\nCaptains and commanders of armies are subjected to a greater risk of\nbeing killed now than of old, since they an be reached everywhere by\nthe enemy\u2019s fire; and it is no protection to them to be with those of\ntheir men who are furthest from the enemy, or to be surrounded by the\nbravest of their guards. Still, we do not often find either of these\ntwo dangers occasioning extraordinary loss. For towns strongly\nfortified are not attacked by escalade, nor will the assailing army\nadvance against them in weak numbers; but will endeavour, as in ancient\ntimes, to reduce them by regular siege. And even in the case of towns\nattacked by storm, the dangers are not so very much greater now than\nthey were formerly; for in those old days also, the defenders of towns\nwere not without warlike engines, which if less terrible in their\noperation, had, so far as killing goes, much the same effect. And as\nfor the deaths of captains and leaders of companies, it may be said\nthat during the last twenty-four years of war in Italy, we have had\nfewer instances of such deaths than might be found in a period of ten\nyears of ancient warfare. For excepting the Count Lodovico della\nMirandola, who fell at Ferrara, when the Venetians a few years ago\nattacked that city, and the Duke de Nemours, slain at Cirignuola, we\nhave no instance of any commander being killed by artillery. For, at\nRavenna, M. de Foix died by steel and not by shot. Wherefore I say that\nif men no longer perform deeds of individual prowess, it results not so\nmuch from the use of artillery, as from the faulty discipline and\nweakness of our armies, which being collectively without valour cannot\ndisplay it in particular instances.\nAs to the third assertion, that armies can no longer be brought to\nengage one another, and that war will soon come to be carried on wholly\nwith artillery, I maintain that this allegation is utterly untrue, and\nwill always be so held by those who are willing in handling their\ntroops to follow the usages of ancient valour. For whosoever would have\na good army must train it, either by real or by mimic warfare, to\napproach the enemy, to come within sword-thrust, and to grapple with\nhim; and must rely more on foot soldiers than on horse, for reasons\npresently to be explained. But when you trust to your foot-soldiers,\nand to the methods already indicated, artillery becomes powerless to\nharm you. For foot-soldiers, in approaching an enemy, can with more\nease escape the fire of his artillery than in ancient times they could\nhave avoided a charge of elephants or of scythed chariots, or any other\nof those strange contrivances which had to be encountered by the\nRomans, and against which they always devised some remedy. And,\ncertainly, as against artillery, their remedy would have been easier,\nby as much as the time during which artillery can do hurt is shorter\nthan the time during which elephants and chariots could. For by these\nyou were thrown into disorder after battle joined, whereas artillery\nharasses you only before you engage; a danger which infantry can easily\nescape, either by advancing so as to be covered by the inequalities of\nthe ground, or by lying down while the firing continues; nay, we find\nfrom experience that even these precautions may be dispensed with,\nespecially as against great artillery, which can hardly be levelled\nwith such precision that its fire shall not either pass over your head\nfrom the range being too high, or fall short from its being too low.\nSo soon, however, as the engagement is begun, it is perfectly clear\nthat neither small nor great artillery can harm you any longer; since,\nif the enemy have his artillerymen in front, you take them; if in rear,\nthey will injure him before they injure you; and if in flank, they can\nnever fire so effectively as to prevent your closing, with the result\nalready explained. Nor does this admit of much dispute, since we have\nproof of it in the case of the Swiss at Novara, in the year 1513, when,\nwith neither guns nor cavalry, they advanced against the French army,\nwho had fortified themselves with artillery behind entrenchments, and\nrouted them without suffering the slightest check from their fire. In\nfurther explanation whereof it is to be noted, that to work artillery\neffectively it should be protected by walls, by ditches, or by\nearth-works; and that whenever, from being left without such protection\nit has to be defended by men, as happens in pitched battles and\nengagements in the open field, it is either taken or otherwise becomes\nuseless. Nor can it be employed on the flank of an army, save in the\nmanner in which the ancients made use of their warlike engines, which\nthey moved out from their columns that they might be worked without\ninconvenience, but withdrew within them when driven back by cavalry or\nother troops. He who looks for any further advantage from artillery\ndoes not rightly understand its nature, and trusts to what is most\nlikely to deceive him. For although the Turk, using artillery, has\ngained victories over the Soldan and the Sofi, the only advantage he\nhas had from it has been the terror into which the horses of the enemy,\nunused to such sounds, are thrown by the roar of the guns.\nAnd now, to bring these remarks to a conclusion, I say briefly that,\nemployed by an army wherein there is some strain of the ancient valour,\nartillery is useful; but employed otherwise, against a brave adversary,\nis utterly useless.\nCHAPTER XVIII.\u2014_That the authority of the Romans and the example of\nancient Warfare should make us hold Foot Soldiers of more account than\nHorse._\nBy many arguments and instances it can be clearly established that in\ntheir military enterprises the Romans set far more store on their\ninfantry than on their cavalry, and trusted to the former to carry out\nall the chief objects which their armies were meant to effect. Among\nmany other examples of this, we may notice the great battle which they\nfought with the Latins near the lake Regillus, where to steady their\nwavering ranks they made their horsemen dismount, and renewing the\ncombat on foot obtained a victory. Here we see plainly that the Romans\nhad more confidence in themselves when they fought on foot than when\nthey fought on horseback. The same expedient was resorted to by them in\nmany of their other battles, and always in their sorest need they found\nit their surest stay.\nNor are we to condemn the practice in deference to the opinion of\nHannibal, who, at the battle of Cann\u00e6, on seeing the consuls make the\nhorsemen dismount, said scoffingly, \u201c_Better still had they delivered\ntheir knights to me in chains._\u201d For though this saying came from the\nmouth of a most excellent soldier, still, if we are to regard\nauthority, we ought rather to follow the authority of a commonwealth\nlike Rome, and of the many great captains who served her, than that of\nHannibal alone. But, apart from authority, there are manifest reasons\nto bear out what I say. For a man may go on foot into many places where\na horse cannot go; men can be taught to keep rank, and if thrown into\ndisorder to recover form; whereas, it is difficult to keep horses in\nline, and impossible if once they be thrown into disorder to reform\nthem. Moreover we find that with horses as with men, some have little\ncourage and some much; and that often a spirited horse is ridden by a\nfaint-hearted rider, or a dull horse by a courageous rider, and that in\nwhatever way such disparity is caused, confusion and disorder result.\nAgain, infantry, when drawn up in column, can easily break and is not\neasily broken by cavalry. This is vouched, not only by many ancient and\nmany modern instances, but also by the authority of those who lay down\nrules for the government of States, who show that at first wars were\ncarried on by mounted soldiers, because the methods for arraying\ninfantry were not yet understood, but that so soon as these were\ndiscovered, the superiority of foot over horse was at once recognized.\nIn saying this, I would not have it supposed that horsemen are not of\nthe greatest use in armies, whether for purposes of observation, for\nharrying and laying waste the enemy\u2019s country, for pursuing a\nretreating foe or helping to repulse his cavalry. But the substance and\nsinew of an army, and that part of it which ought constantly to be most\nconsidered, should always be the infantry. And among sins of the\nItalian princes who have made their country the slave of foreigners,\nthere is none worse than that they have held these arms in contempt,\nand turned their whole attention to mounted troops.\nThis error is due to the craft of our captains and to the ignorance of\nour rulers. For the control of the armies of Italy for the last five\nand twenty years resting in the hands of men, who, as having no lands\nof their own, may be looked on as mere soldiers of fortune, these fell\nforthwith on contriving how they might maintain their credit by being\nsupplied with the arms which the princes of the country were without.\nAnd as they had no subjects of their own of whom they could make use,\nand could not obtain constant employment and pay for a large number of\nfoot-soldiers, and as a small number would have given them no\nimportance, they had recourse to horsemen. For a _condottiere_ drawing\npay for two or three hundred horsemen was maintained by them in the\nhighest credit, and yet the cost was not too great to be met by the\nprinces who employed him. And to effect their object with more ease,\nand increase their credit still further, these adventurers would allow\nno merit or favour to be due to foot-soldiers, but claimed all for\ntheir horsemen. And to such a length was this bad system carried, that\nin the very greatest army only the smallest sprinkling of infantry was\nto be found. This, together with many other ill practices which\naccompanied it, has so weakened the militia of Italy, that the country\nhas easily been trampled upon by all the nations of the North.\nThat it is a mistake to make more account of cavalry than of infantry,\nmay be still more clearly seen from another example taken from Roman\nhistory. The Romans being engaged on the siege of Sora, a troop of\nhorse a sally from the town to attack their camp; when the Roman master\nof the knights advancing with his own horsemen to give them battle, it\nso chanced that, at the very first onset, the leaders on both sides\nwere slain. Both parties being thus left without commanders, and the\ncombat, nevertheless, continuing, the Romans thinking thereby to have\nthe advantage of their adversaries, alighted from horseback, obliging\nthe enemy\u2019s cavalry, in order to defend themselves, to do the like. The\nresult was that the Romans had the victory. Now there could be no\nstronger instance than this to show the superiority of foot over horse.\nFor while in other battles the Roman cavalry were made by their consuls\nto dismount in order to succour their infantry who were in distress and\nin need of such aid, on this occasion they dismounted, not to succour\ntheir infantry, nor to encounter an enemy contending on foot, but\nbecause they saw that though they could not prevail against the enemy\nfighting as horsemen against horsemen, on foot they readily might. And\nfrom this I conclude that foot-soldiers, if rightly handled, can hardly\nbe beaten except by other soldiers fighting on foot.\nWith very few cavalry, but with a considerable force of infantry, the\nRoman commanders, Crassus and Marcus Antonius, each for many days\ntogether overran the territories of the Parthians, although opposed by\nthe countless horsemen of that nation. Crassus, indeed, with the\ngreater part of his army, was left there dead, and Antonius only saved\nhimself by his valour; but even in the extremities to which the Romans\nwere then brought, see how greatly superior foot-soldiers are to horse.\nFor though fighting in an open country, far from the sea-coast, and cut\noff from his supplies, Antonius proved himself a valiant soldier in the\njudgment even of the Parthians themselves, the whole strength of whose\ncavalry never ventured to attack the columns of his army. And though\nCrassus perished there, any one who reads attentively the account of\nhis expedition must see that he was rather outwitted than defeated, and\nthat even when his condition was desperate, the Parthians durst not\nclose with him, but effected his destruction by hanging continually on\nthe flanks of his army, and intercepting his supplies, while cajoling\nhim with promises which they never kept.\nIt might, I grant, be harder to demonstrate this great superiority of\nfoot over horse, had we not very many modern examples affording the\nclearest proof of it. For instance, at the battle of Novara, of which\nwe have already spoken, nine thousand Swiss foot were seen to attack\nten thousand cavalry together with an equal number of infantry, and to\ndefeat them; the cavalry being powerless to injure them, while of the\ninfantry, who were mostly Gascons, and badly disciplined, they made no\naccount. On another occasion we have seen twenty-six thousand Swiss\nmarch on Milan to attack Francis I. of France, who had with him twenty\nthousand men-at-arms, forty thousand foot, and a hundred pieces of\nartillery; and although they were not victorious as at Novara, they\nnevertheless fought valiantly for two days together, and, in the end,\nthough beaten, were able to bring off half their number. With\nfoot-soldiers only Marcus Attilius Regulus ventured to oppose himself,\nnot to cavalry merely, but to elephants; and if the attempt failed it\ndoes not follow that he was not justified by the valour of his men in\nbelieving them equal to surmount this danger.\nI repeat, therefore, that to prevail against well-disciplined infantry,\nyou must meet them with infantry disciplined still better, and that\notherwise you advance to certain destruction. In the time of Filippo\nVisconti, Duke of Milan, some sixteen thousand Swiss made a descent on\nLombardy, whereupon the Duke, who at that time had Il Carmagnola as his\ncaptain, sent him with six thousand men-at-arms and a slender following\nof foot-soldiers to meet them. Not knowing their manner of fighting,\nCarmagnola fell upon them with his horsemen, expecting to put them at\nonce to rout; but finding them immovable, after losing many of his men\nhe withdrew. But, being a most wise captain, and skilful in devising\nnew remedies to meet unwonted dangers, after reinforcing his company he\nagain advanced to the attack; and when about to engage made all his\nmen-at-arms dismount, and placing them in front of his foot-soldiers,\nfell once more upon the Swiss, who could then no longer withstand him.\nFor his men, being on foot and well armed, easily penetrated the Swiss\nranks without hurt to themselves; and getting among them, had no\ndifficulty in cutting them down, so that of the entire army of the\nSwiss those only escaped who were spared by his humanity.\nOf this difference in the efficiency of these two kinds of troops, many\nI believe are aware; but such is the unhappiness and perversity of the\ntimes in which we live, that neither ancient nor modern examples, nor\neven the consciousness of error, can move our present princes to amend\ntheir ways, or convince them that to restore credit to the arms of a\nState or province, it is necessary to revive this branch of their\nmilitia also, to keep it near them, to make much of it, and to give it\nlife, that in return, it may give back life and reputation to them. But\nas they have departed from all those other methods already spoken of,\nso have they departed from this, and with this result, that to them the\nacquisition of territory is rather a loss than a gain, as presently\nshall be shown.\nCHAPTER XIX.\u2014_That Acquisitions made by ill-governed States and such as\nfollow not the valiant methods of the Romans, tend rather to their Ruin\nthan to their Aggrandizement_.\nTo these false opinions, founded on the pernicious example first set by\nthe present corrupt age, we owe it, that no man thinks of departing\nfrom the methods which are in use. It had been impossible, for\ninstance, some thirty years ago, to persuade an Italian that ten\nthousand foot-soldiers could, on plain ground, attack ten thousand\ncavalry together with an equal number of infantry; and not merely\nattack, but defeat them; as we saw done by the Swiss at that battle of\nNovara, to which I have already referred so often. For although history\nabounds in similar examples, none would have believed them, or,\nbelieving them, would have said that nowadays men are so much better\narmed, that a squadron of cavalry could shatter a rock, to say nothing\nof a column of infantry. With such false pleas would they have belied\ntheir judgment, taking no account that with a very scanty force of\nfoot-soldiers, Lucullus routed a hundred and fifty thousand of the\ncavalry of Tigranes, among whom were a body of horsemen very nearly\nresembling our own men-at-arms. Now, however, this error is\ndemonstrated by the example of the northern nations.\nAnd since what history teaches as to the superiority of foot-soldiers\nis thus proved to be true, men ought likewise to believe that the other\nmethods practised by the ancients are in like manner salutary and\nuseful. And were this once accepted, both princes and commonwealths\nwould make fewer blunders than they do, would be stronger to resist\nsudden attack, and would no longer place their sole hope of safety in\nflight; while those who take in hand to provide a State with new\ninstitutions would know better what direction to give them, whether in\nthe way of extending or merely of preserving; and would see that to\naugment the numbers of their citizens, to assume other States as\ncompanions rather than reduce them to subjection, to send out colonies\nfor the defence of acquired territories, to hold their spoils at the\ncredit of the common stock, to overcome enemies by inroads and pitched\nbattles rather than by sieges, to enrich the public purse, keep down\nprivate wealth, and zealously, to maintain all military exercises, are\nthe true ways to aggrandize a State and to extend its empire. Or if\nthese methods for adding to their power are not to their mind, let them\nremember that acquisitions made in any other way are the ruin of\nrepublics, and so set bounds to their ambition, wisely regulating the\ninternal government of their country by suitable laws and ordinances,\nforbidding extension, and looking only to defence, and taking heed that\ntheir defences are in good order, as do those republics of Germany\nwhich live and for long have lived, in freedom.\nAnd yet, as I have said on another occasion, when speaking of the\ndifference between the methods suitable for acquiring and those\nsuitable for maintaining, it is impossible for a republic to remain\nlong in the peaceful enjoyment of freedom within a restricted frontier.\nFor should it forbear from molesting others, others are not likely to\nrefrain from molesting it; whence must grow at once the desire and the\nnecessity to make acquisitions; or should no enemies be found abroad,\nthey will be found at home, for this seems to be incidental to all\ngreat States. And if the free States of Germany are, and have long been\nable to maintain themselves on their present footing, this arises from\ncertain conditions peculiar to that country, and to be found nowhere\nelse, without which these communities could not go on living as they\ndo.\nThe district of Germany of which I speak was formerly subject to the\nRoman Empire, in the same way as France and Spain; but on the decline\nof the Empire, and when its very name came to be limited to this one\nprovince, its more powerful cities taking advantage of the weakness and\nnecessities of the Emperors, began to free themselves by buying from\nthem their liberty, subject to the payment of a trifling yearly\ntribute; until, gradually, all the cities which held directly from the\nEmperor, and were not subject to any intermediate lord, had, in like\nmanner, purchased their freedom. While this went on, it so happened\nthat certain communities subject to the Duke of Austria, among which\nwere Friburg, the people of Schweitz, and the like, rose in rebellion\nagainst him, and meeting at the outset with good success, by degrees\nacquired such accession of strength that so far from returning under\nthe Austrian yoke, they are become formidable to all their neighbours\nThese are the States which we now name Swiss.\nGermany is, consequently, divided between the Swiss, the communities\nwhich take the name of Free Towns, the Princes, and the Emperor; and\nthe reason why, amid so many conflicting interests, wars do not break\nout, or breaking out are of short continuance, is the reverence in\nwhich all hold this symbol of the Imperial authority. For although the\nEmperor be without strength of his own, he has nevertheless such credit\nwith all these others that he alone can keep them united, and,\ninterposing as mediator, can speedily repress by his influence any\ndissensions among them.\nThe greatest and most protracted wars which have taken place in this\ncountry have been those between the Swiss and the Duke of Austria; and\nalthough for many years past the Empire and the dukedom of Austria have\nbeen united in the same man, he has always failed to subdue the\nstubbornness of the Swiss, who are never to be brought to terms save by\nforce. Nor has the rest of Germany lent the Emperor much assistance in\nhis wars with the Swiss, the Free Towns being little disposed to attack\nothers whose desire is to live as they themselves do, in freedom; while\nthe Princes of the Empire either are so poor that they cannot, or from\njealousy of the power of the Emperor will not, take part with him\nagainst them.\nThese communities, therefore, abide contented within their narrow\nconfines, because, having regard to the Imperial authority, they have\nno occasion to desire greater; and are at the same time obliged to live\nin unity within their walls, because an enemy is always at hand, and\nready to take advantage of their divisions to effect an entrance. But\nwere the circumstances of the country other than they are these\ncommunities would be forced to make attempts to extend their dominions,\nand be constrained to relinquish their present peaceful mode of life.\nAnd since the same conditions are not found elsewhere, other nations\ncannot adopt this way of living, but are compelled to extend their\npower either by means of leagues, or else by the methods used by the\nRomans; and any one who should act otherwise would find not safety but\nrather death and destruction. For since in a thousand ways, and from\ncauses innumerable, conquests are surrounded with dangers, it may well\nhappen that in adding to our dominions, we add nothing to our strength;\nbut whosoever increases not his strength while he adds to his\ndominions, must needs be ruined. He who is impoverished by his wars,\neven should he come off victorious, can add nothing to his strength,\nsince he spends more than he gains, as the Venetians and Florentines\nhave done. For Venice has been far feebler since she acquired Lombardy,\nand Florence since she acquired Tuscany, than when the one was content\nto be mistress of the seas, and the other of the lands lying within six\nmiles from her walls. And this from their eagerness to acquire without\nknowing what way to take. For which ignorance these States are the more\nto be blamed in proportion as there is less to excuse them; since they\nhad seen what methods were used by the Romans, and could have followed\nin their footsteps; whereas the Romans, without any example set them,\nwere able by their own prudence to shape a course for themselves.\nBut even to well-governed States, their conquests may chance to\noccasion much harm; as when some city or province is acquired abounding\nin luxury and delights, by whose manners the conqueror becomes\ninfected; as happened first to the Romans, and afterwards to Hannibal\non taking possession of Capua. And had Capua been at such a distance\nfrom Rome that a ready remedy could not have been applied to the\ndisorders of the soldiery, or had Rome herself been in any degree\ntainted with corruption, this acquisition had certainly proved her\nruin. To which Titus Livius bears witness when he says, \u201c_Most\nmischievous at this time to our military discipline was Capua; for\nministering to all delights, she turned away the corrupted minds of our\nsoldiers from the remembrance of their country_.\u201d And, truly, cities\nand provinces like this, avenge themselves on their conquerors without\nblood or blow; since by infecting them with their own evil customs they\nprepare them for defeat at the hands of any assailant. Nor could the\nsubject have been better handled than by Juvenal, where he says in his\nSatires, that into the hearts of the Romans, through their conquests in\nforeign lands, foreign manners found their way; and in place of\nfrugality and other admirable virtues\u2014\n\u201cCame luxury more mortal than the sword,\nAnd settling down, avenged a vanquished world.\u201d[8]\n[8] S\u00e6vior armis\nLuxuria occubuit victumque ulciscitur orbem.\n_Juv. Sat_. vi. 292.\nAnd if their conquests were like to be fatal to the Romans at a time\nwhen they were still animated by great virtue and prudence, how must it\nfare with those who follow methods altogether different from theirs,\nand who, to crown their other errors of which we have already said\nenough, resort to auxiliary and mercenary arms, bringing upon\nthemselves those dangers whereof mention shall be made in the Chapter\nfollowing.\nCHAPTER XX.\u2014_Of the Dangers incurred by Princes or Republics who resort\nto Auxiliary or Mercenary Arms_.\nHad I not already, in another treatise, enlarged on the inutility of\nmercenary and auxiliary, and on the usefulness of national arms, I\nshould dwell on these matters in the present Discourse more at length\nthan it is my design to do. For having given the subject very full\nconsideration elsewhere, here I would be brief. Still when I find Titus\nLivius supplying a complete example of what we have to look for from\nauxiliaries, by whom I mean troops sent to our assistance by some other\nprince or ruler, paid by him and under officers by him appointed, it is\nnot fit that I should pass it by in silence.\nIt is related, then, by our historian, that the Romans, after defeating\non two different occasions armies of the Samnites with forces sent by\nthem to succour the Capuans, whom they thus relieved from the war which\nthe Samnites Were waging against them, being desirious to return to\nRome, left behind two legions to defend the Capuans, that the latter\nmight not, from being altogether deprived of their protection, once\nmore become a prey to the Samnites. But these two legions, rotting in\nidleness began to take such delight therein, that forgetful of their\ncountry and the reverence due to the senate, they resolved to seize by\nviolence the city they had been left to guard by their valour. For to\nthem it seemed that the citizens of Capua were unworthy to enjoy\nadvantages which they knew not how to defend. The Romans, however,\ngetting timely notice of this design, at once met and defeated it, in\nthe manner to be more fully noticed when I come to treat of\nconspiracies.\nOnce more then, I repeat, that of all the various kinds of troops,\nauxiliaries are the most pernicious, because the prince or republic\nresorting to them for aid has no authority over them, the only person\nwho possesses such authority being he who sends them. For, as I have\nsaid, auxiliary troops are those sent to your assistance by some other\npotentate, under his own flag, under his own officers, and in his own\npay, as were the legions sent by the Romans to Capua. Such troops, if\nvictorious, will for the most part plunder him by whom, as well as him\nagainst whom, they are hired to fight; and this they do, sometimes at\nthe instigation of the potentate who sends them, sometimes for\nambitious ends of their own. It was not the purpose of the Romans to\nviolate the league and treaty which they had made with Capua; but to\ntheir soldiers it seemed so easy a matter to master the Capuans, that\nthey were readily led into this plot for depriving them of their town\nand territories. Many other examples might be given to the same effect,\nbut it is enough to mention besides this instance, that of the people\nof Regium, who were deprived of their city and of their lives by\nanother Roman legion sent for their protection.\nPrinces and republics, therefore, should resort to any other expedient\nfor the defence of their States sooner than call in hired auxiliaries,\nwhen they have to rest their entire hopes of safety on them; since any\naccord or terms, however hard, which you may make with your enemy, will\nbe carefully studied and current events well considered, it will be\nseen that for one who has succeeded with such assistance, hundreds have\nbeen betrayed. Nor, in truth, can any better opportunity for usurping a\ncity or province present itself to an ambitious prince or commonwealth,\nthan to be asked to send an army for its defence. On the other hand, he\nwho is so greedy of conquest as to summon such help, not for purposes\nof defence but in order to attack others, seeks to have what he can\nnever hold and is most likely to be taken from him by the very person\nwho helps him to gain it. Yet such is the perversity of men that, to\ngratify the desire of the moment, they shut their eyes to those ills\nwhich must speedily ensue and are no more moved by example in this\nmatter than in all those others of which I have spoken; for were they\nmoved by these examples they would see that the more disposed they are\nto deal generously with their neighbours, and the more averse they are\nto usurp authority over them, the readier will these be to throw\nthemselves into their arms; as will at once appear from the case of the\nCapuans.\nCHAPTER XXI.\u2014_That Capua was the first City to which the Romans sent a\nPr\u00e6tor; nor there, until four hundred years after they began to make\nWar._\nThe great difference between the methods followed by the ancient Romans\nin adding to their dominions, and those used for that purpose by the\nStates of the present time, has now been sufficiently discussed. It has\nbeen seen, too how in dealing with the cities which they did not think\nfit to destroy, and even with those which had made their submission not\nas companions but as subjects, it was customary with the Romans to\npermit them to live on under their own laws, without imposing any\noutward sign of dependence, merely binding them to certain conditions,\nor complying with which they were maintained in their former dignity\nand importance. We know, further, that the same methods continued to be\nfollowed by the Romans until they passed beyond the confines of Italy,\nand began to reduce foreign kingdoms and States to provinces: as\nplainly appears in the fact that Capua was the first city to which they\nsent a pr\u00e6tor, and him from no motive of ambition, but at the request\nof the Capuans themselves who, living at variance with one another,\nthought it necessary to have a Roman citizen in their town who might\nrestore unity and good order among them. Influenced by this example,\nand urged by the same need, the people of Antium were the next to ask\nthat they too might have a pr\u00e6tor given them; touching which request\nand in connection with which new method of governing, Titus Livius\nobserves, \u201c_that not the arms only but also the laws of Rome now began\nto exert an influence;_\u201d showing how much the course thus followed by\nthe Romans promoted the growth of their authority.\nFor those cities, more especially, which have been used to freedom or\nto be governed by their own citizens, rest far better satisfied with a\ngovernment which they do not see, even though it involve something of\noppression, than with one which standing constantly before their eyes,\nseems every day to reproach them with the disgrace of servitude. And to\nthe prince there is another advantage in this method of government,\nnamely, that as the judges and magistrates who administer the laws\ncivil and criminal within these cities, are not under his control, no\ndecision of theirs can throw responsibility or discredit upon him; so\nthat he thus escapes many occasions of calumny and hatred. Of the truth\nwhereof, besides the ancient instances which might be noted, we have a\nrecent example here in Italy. For Genoa, as every one knows, has many\ntimes been occupied by the French king, who always, until lately, sent\nthither a French governor to rule in his name. Recently, however, not\nfrom choice but of necessity, he has permitted the town to be\nself-governed under a Genoese ruler; and any one who had to decide\nwhich of these two methods of governing gives the greater security to\nthe king\u2019s authority and the greater content to the people themselves,\nwould assuredly have to pronounce in favour of the latter.\nMen, moreover, in proportion as they see you averse to usurp authority\nover them, grow the readier to surrender themselves into your hands;\nand fear you less on the score of their freedom, when they find you\nacting towards them with consideration and kindness. It was the display\nof these qualities that moved the Capuans to ask the Romans for a\npr\u00e6tor; for had the Romans betrayed the least eagerness to send them\none, they would at once have conceived jealousy and grown estranged.\nBut why turn for examples to Capua and Rome, when we have them close at\nhand in Tuscany and Florence? Who is there but knows what a time it is\nsince the city of Pistoja submitted of her own accord to the Florentine\nsupremacy? Who, again, but knows the animosity which down to the\npresent day exists between Florence and the cities of Pisa, Lucca, and\nSiena? This difference of feeling does not arise from the citizens of\nPistoja valuing their freedom less than the citizens of these other\ntowns or thinking themselves inferior to them, but from the Florentines\nhaving always acted towards the former as brothers, towards the latter\nas foes. This it was that led the Pistojans to come voluntarily under\nour authority while the others have done and do all in their power to\nescape it. For there seems no reason to doubt, that if Florence,\ninstead of exasperating these neighbours of hers, had sought to win\nthem over, either by entering into league with them or by lending them\nassistance, she would at this hour have been mistress of Tuscany. Not\nthat I would be understood to maintain that recourse is never to be had\nto force and to arms, but that these are only to be used in the last\nresort, and when all other remedies are unavailing.\nCHAPTER XXII.\u2014_That in matters of moment Men often judge amiss._\nHow falsely men often judge of things, they who are present at their\ndeliberations have constant occasion to know. For in many matters,\nunless these deliberations be guided by men of great parts, the\nconclusions come to are certain to be wrong. And because in corrupt\nrepublics, and especially in quiet times, either through jealousy or\nfrom other like causes, men of great ability are often obliged to stand\naloof, it follows that measures not good in themselves are by a common\nerror judged to be good, or are promoted by those who seek public\nfavour rather than the public advantage. Mistakes of this sort are\nfound out afterwards in seasons of adversity, when recourse must be had\nto those persons who in peaceful times had been, as it were, forgotten,\nas shall hereafter in its proper place be more fully explained. Cases,\nmoreover, arise in which those who have little experience of affairs\nare sure to be misled, from the matters with which they have to deal\nbeing attended by many deceptive appearances such as lead men to\nbelieve whatsoever they are minded to believe.\nThese remarks I make with reference to the false hopes which the\nLatins, after being defeated by the Romans, were led to form on the\npersuasion of their pr\u00e6tor Numitius, and also with reference to what\nwas believed by many a few years ago, when Francis, king of France,\ncame to recover Milan from the Swiss. For Francis of Angoul\u00eame,\nsucceeding on the death of Louis XII. to the throne of France, and\ndesiring to recover for that realm the Duchy of Milan, on which, some\nyears before, the Swiss had seized at the instance of Pope Julius,\nsought for allies in Italy to second him in his attempt; and besides\nthe Venetians, who had already been gained over by King Louis,\nendeavoured to secure the aid of the Florentines and Pope Leo X.;\nthinking that were he to succeed in getting these others to take part\nwith him, his enterprise would be easier. For the forces of the Spanish\nking were then in Lombardy, and the army of the Emperor at Verona.\nPope Leo, however, did not fall in with the wishes of Francis, being,\nit is said, persuaded by his advisers that his best course was to stand\nneutral. For they urged that it was not for the advantage of the Church\nto have powerful strangers, whether French or Swiss, in Italy; but that\nto restore the country to its ancient freedom, it must be delivered\nfrom the yoke of both. And since to conquer both, whether singly or\ntogether, was impossible, it was to be desired that the one should\noverthrow the other, after which the Church with her friends might fall\nupon the victor. And it was averred that no better opportunity for\ncarrying out this design could ever be found than then presented\nitself; for both the French and the Swiss were in the field; while the\nPope had his troops in readiness to appear on the Lombard frontier and\nin the vicinity of the two armies, where, under colour of watching his\nown interests, he could easily keep them until the opposed hosts came\nto an engagement; when, as both armies were full of courage, their\nencounter might be expected to be a bloody one, and likely to leave the\nvictor so weakened that it would be easy for the Pope to attack and\ndefeat him; and so, to his own great glory, remain master of Lombardy\nand supreme throughout Italy.\nHow baseless this expectation was, was seen from the event. For the\nSwiss being routed after a protracted combat, the troops of the Pope\nand Spain, so far from venturing to attack the conqueror, prepared for\nflight; nor would flight have saved them, had not the humanity or\nindifference of the king withheld him from pursuing his victory, and\ndisposed him to make terms with the Church.\nThe arguments put forward by the Pope\u2019s advisers had a certain show of\nreason in their favour, which looked at from a distance seemed\nplausible enough; but were in reality wholly contrary to truth; since\nit rarely happens that the captain who wins a victory loses any great\nnumber of his men, his loss being in battle only, and not in flight.\nFor in the heat of battle, while men stand face to face, but few fall,\nchiefly because such combats do not last long; and even when they do\nlast, and many of the victorious army are slain, so splendid is the\nreputation which attends a victory, and so great the terror it\ninspires, as far to outweigh any loss the victor suffers by the\nslaughter of his soldiers; so that an enemy who, trusting to find him\nweakened, should then venture to attack him, would soon be taught his\nmistake, unless strong enough to give him battle at any time, before\nhis victory as well as after. For in that case he might, as fortune and\nvalour should determine, either win or lose; though, even then, the\narmy which had first fought and won would have an advantage. And this\nwe know for a truth from what befell the Latins in consequence of the\nmistake made by Numitius their pr\u00e6tor, and their blindness in believing\nhim. For when they had already suffered defeat at the hands of the\nRomans, Numitius caused it to be proclaimed throughout the whole\ncountry of Latium, that now was the time to fall upon the enemy,\nexhausted by a struggle in which they were victorious only in name,\nwhile in reality suffering all those ills which attend defeat, and who\nmight easily be crushed by any fresh force brought against them.\nWhereupon the Latins believed him, and getting together a new army,\nwere forthwith routed with such loss as always awaits those who listen\nto like counsels.\nCHAPTER XXIII.\u2014_That in chastising their Subjects when circumstances\nrequired it the Romans always avoided half-measures._\n\u201cSuch _was now the state of affairs in Latium, that peace and war\nseemed alike intolerable_.\u201d No worse calamity can befall a prince or\ncommonwealth than to be reduced to such straits that they can neither\naccept peace nor support war; as is the case with those whom it would\nruin to conclude peace on the terms offered, while war obliges them\neither to yield themselves a spoil to their allies, or remain a prey to\ntheir foes. To this grievous alternative are men led by evil counsels\nand unwise courses, and, as already said, from not rightly measuring\ntheir strength. For the commonwealth or prince who has rightly measured\nhis strength, can hardly be brought so low as were the Latins, who made\nwar with the Romans when they should have made terms, and made terms\nwhen they should have made war, and so mismanaged everything that the\nfriendship and the enmity of Rome were alike fatal. Whence it came\nthat, in the first place, they were defeated and broken by Manlius\nTorquatus, and afterwards utterly subdued by Camillus; who, when he had\nforced them to surrender at discretion to the Roman arms, and had\nplaced garrisons in all their towns, and taken hostages from all,\nreturned to Rome and reported to the senate that the whole of Latium\nnow lay at their mercy.\nAnd because the sentence then passed by the senate is memorable, and\nworthy to be studied by princes that it may be imitated by them on like\noccasion, I shall cite the exact words which Livius puts into the mouth\nof Camillus, as confirming what I have already said touching the\nmethods used by the Romans to extend their power, and as showing how in\nchastising their subjects they always avoided half-measures and took a\ndecided course. For government consists in nothing else than in so\ncontrolling your subjects that it shall neither be in their power nor\nfor their interest to harm you. And this is effected either by making\nsuch sure work with them as puts it out of their power to do you\ninjury, or else by so loading them with benefits that it would be folly\nin them to seek to alter their condition. All which is implied first in\nthe measures proposed by Camillus, and next in the resolutions passed\non these proposals by the senate. The words of Camillus were as\nfollows: \u201c_The immortal gods have made you so entirely masters in the\nmatter you are now considering, that_ _it lies with you to pronounce\nwhether Latium shall or shall not longer exist. So far as the Latins\nare concerned, you can secure a lasting peace either by clemency or by\nseverity. Would you deal harshly with those whom you have conquered and\nwho have given themselves into your hands, you can blot out the whole\nLatin nation. Would you, after the fashion of our ancestors, increase\nthe strength of Rome by admitting the vanquished to the rights of\ncitizenship, here you have opportunity to do so, and with the greatest\nglory to yourselves. That, assuredly, is the strongest government which\nthey rejoice in who obey it. Now, then, is your time, while the minds\nof all are bent on what is about to happen, to obtain an ascendency\nover them, either by punishment or by benefits._\u201d\nUpon this motion the senate resolved, in accordance with the advice\ngiven by the consul, to take the case of each city separately, and\neither destroy utterly or else treat with tenderness all the more\nimportant of the Latin towns. To those cities they dealt with\nleniently, they granted exemptions and privileges, conferring upon them\nthe rights of citizenship, and securing their welfare in every\nparticular. The others they razed to the ground, and planting colonies\nin their room, either removed the inhabitants to Rome, or so scattered\nand dispersed them that neither by arms nor by counsels was it ever\nagain in their power to inflict hurt. For, as I have said already, the\nRomans never, in matters of moment, resorted to half-measures. And the\nsentence which they then pronounced should be a pattern for all rulers,\nand ought to have been followed by the Florentines when, in the year\n1502, Arezzo and all the Val di Chiana rose in revolt. For had they\nfollowed it, they would have established their authority on a surer\nfooting, and added much to the greatness of their city by securing for\nit those lands which are needed to supply it with the necessaries of\nlife. But pursuing that half-hearted policy which is most mischievous\nin executing justice, some of the Aretines they outlawed, some they\ncondemned to death, and all they deprived of their dignities and\nancient importance in their town, while leaving the town itself\nuntouched. And if in the councils then held any Florentine recommended\nthat Arezzo should be dismantled, they who thought themselves wiser\nthan their fellows objected, that to do so would be little to the\nhonour of our republic, since it would look as though she lacked\nstrength to hold it. Reasons like this are of a sort which seem sound,\nbut are not really so; for, by the same rule, no parricide should be\nput to death, nor any other malefactor, however atrocious his crimes;\nbecause, forsooth, it would be discreditable to the ruler to appear\nunequal to the control of a single criminal. They who hold such\nopinions fail to see that when men individually, or entire cities\ncollectively, offend against the State, the prince for his own safety,\nand as a warning to others, has no alternative but to make an end of\nthem; and that true honour lies in being able and in knowing how to\nchastise such offenders, and not in incurring endless dangers in the\neffort to retain them. For the prince who does not chastise offenders\nin a way that puts it out of their power to offend again, is accounted\nunwise or worthless.\nHow necessary it was for the Romans to execute Justice against the\nLatins, is further seen from the course took with the men of Privernum.\nAnd here the text of Livius suggests two points for our attention:\nfirst, as already noted, that a subjugated people is either to be\ncaressed or crushed; and second, how much it is for our advantage to\nmaintain a manly bearing, and to speak the truth fearlessly in the\npresence of the wise. For the senate being met to determine the fate of\nthe citizens of Privernum, who after rebelling had been reduced to\nsubmission by the Roman arms, certain of these citizens were sent by\ntheir countrymen to plead for pardon. When these had come into the\npresence of the senate, one of them was asked by a senator, \u201c_What\npunishment he thought his fellow citizens deserved?_\u201d To which he of\nPrivernum answered, \u201c_Such punishment as they deserve who deem\nthemselves worthy of freedom._\u201d \u201c_But,_\u201d said the consul, \u201c_should we\nremit your punishment, what sort of peace can we hope to have with\nyou?_\u201d To which the other replied, \u201c_If granted on fair terms, a firm\nand lasting peace; if on unfair, a peace of brief duration._\u201d Upon\nthis, though many of the senators were displeased, the wiser among them\ndeclared \u201c_that they had heard the voice of freedom and manhood, and\nwould never believe that the man or people who so spoke ought to remain\nlonger than was needful in a position which gave them cause for shame;\nsince that was a safe peace which was accepted willingly; whereas good\nfaith could not be looked for where it was sought to impose\nservitude._\u201d So saying, they decided that the people of Privernum\nshould be admitted to Roman citizenship, with all the rights and\nprivileges thereto appertaining; declaring that \u201c_men whose only\nthought was for freedom, were indeed worthy to be Romans._\u201d So pleasing\nwas this true and high answer to generous minds, while any other must\nhave seemed at once false and shameful. And they who judge otherwise of\nmen, and of those men, especially, who have been used to be free, or so\nto think themselves, are mistaken; and are led through their mistake to\nadopt courses unprofitable for themselves and affording no content to\nothers. Whence, the frequent rebellions and the downfall of States.\nBut, returning to our subject, I conclude, as well from this instance\nof Privernum, as from the measures followed with the Latins, that when\nwe have to pass sentence upon powerful States accustomed to live in\nfreedom, we must either destroy them utterly, or else treat them with\nmuch indulgence; and that any other course we may take with them will\nbe unprofitable. But most carefully should we avoid, as of all courses\nthe most pernicious, such half-measures as were followed by the\nSamnites when they had the Romans shut up in the Caudine Forks, and\nwould not listen to the counsels of the old man who urged them either\nto send their captives away with every honourable attention, or else\nput them all to death; but adopted a middle course, and after disarming\nthem and making them pass under the yoke, suffered them to depart at\nonce disgraced and angered. And no long time after, they found to their\nsorrow that the old man\u2019s warning was true, and that the course they\nhad themselves chosen was calamitous; as shall, hereafter, in its place\nbe shown.\nCHAPTER XXIV.\u2014_That, commonly, Fortresses do much more Harm than Good_\nTo the wise men of our day it may seem an oversight on the part of the\nRomans, that, when they sought to protect themselves against the men of\nLatium and Privernum, it never occurred to them to build strongholds in\ntheir cities to be a curb upon them, and insure their fidelity,\nespecially when we remember the Florentine saying which these same wise\nmen often quote, to the effect that Pisa and other like cities must be\nheld by fortresses Doubtless, had those old Romans been like-minded\nwith our modern sages, they would not have neglected to build\nthemselves fortresses, but because they far surpassed them in courage,\nsense, and vigour, they refrained. And while Rome retained her freedom,\nand adhered to her own wise ordinances and wholesome usages, she never\nbuilt a single fortress with the view to hold any city or province,\nthough, sometimes, she may have suffered those to stand which she found\nalready built.\nLooking, therefore, to the course followed by the Romans in this\nparticular, and to that adopted by our modern rulers, it seems proper\nto consider whether or not it is advisable to build fortresses, and\nwhether they are more likely to help or to hurt him who builds them In\nthe first place, then, we are to remember that fortresses are built\neither as a defence against foreign foes or against subjects In the\nformer case, I pronounce them unnecessary, in the latter mischievous.\nAnd to state the reasons why in the latter case they are mischievous, I\nsay that when princes or republics are afraid of their subjects and in\nfear lest they rebel, this must proceed from knowing that their\nsubjects hate them, which hatred in its turn results from their own ill\nconduct, and that again from their thinking themselves able to rule\ntheir subjects by mere force, or from their governing with little\nprudence. Now one of the causes which lead them to suppose that they\ncan rule by mere force, is this very circumstance of their people\nhaving these fortresses on their backs So that the conduct which breeds\nhatred is itself mainly occasioned by these princes or republics being\npossessed of fortresses, which, if this be true, are really far more\nhurtful than useful First, because, as has been said already, they\nrender a ruler bolder and more violent in his bearing towards his\nsubjects, and, next, because they do not in reality afford him that\nsecurity which he believes them to give For all those methods of\nviolence and coercion which may be used to keep a people under, resolve\nthemselves into two; since either like the Romans you must always have\nit in your power to bring a strong army into the field, or else you\nmust dissipate, destroy, and disunite the subject people, and so divide\nand scatter them that they can never again combine to injure you For\nshould you merely strip them of their wealth, _spoliatis arma\nsupersunt_, arms still remain to them, or if you deprive them of their\nweapons, _furor arma ministrat_, rage will supply them, if you put\ntheir chiefs to death and continue to maltreat the rest, heads will\nrenew themselves like those Hydra; while, if you build fortresses,\nthese may serve in time of peace to make you bolder in outraging your\nsubjects, but in time of war they will prove wholly useless, since they\nwill be attacked at once by foes both foreign and domestic, whom\ntogether it will be impossible for you to resist. And if ever\nfortresses were useless they are so at the present day, by reason of\nthe invention of artillery, against the fury of which, as I have shown\nalready, a petty fortress which affords no room for retreat behind\nfresh works, cannot be defended.\nBut to go deeper into the matter, I say, either you are a prince\nseeking by means of these fortresses to hold the people of your city in\ncheck; or you are a prince, or it may be a republic, desirous to\ncontrol some city which you have gained in war. To the prince I would\nsay, that, for the reasons already given, nothing can be more\nunserviceable than a fortress as a restraint upon your subjects, since\nit only makes you the readier to oppress them, and less scrupulous how\nyou do so; while it is this very oppression which moves them to destroy\nyou, and so kindles their hatred, that the fortress, which is the cause\nof all the mischief, is powerless to protect you. A wise and good\nprince, therefore, that he may continue good, and give no occasion or\nencouragement to his descendants to become evil, will never build a\nfortress, to the end that neither he nor they may ever be led to trust\nto it rather than to the good-will of their subjects. And if Francesco\nSforza, who was accounted a wise ruler, on becoming Duke of Milan\nerected a fortress in that city, I say that herein he was unwise, and\nthat the event has shown the building of this fortress to have been\nhurtful and not helpful to his heirs. For thinking that by its aid they\ncould behave as badly as they liked to their citizens and subjects, and\nyet be secure, they refrained from no sort of violence or oppression,\nuntil, becoming beyond measure odious, they lost their State as soon as\nan enemy attacked it. Nor was this fortress, which in peace had\noccasioned them much hurt, any defence or of any service them in war.\nFor had they being without it, through thoughtlessness, treated their\nsubjects inhumanely, they must soon have discovered and withdrawn from\ntheir danger; and might, thereafter, with no other help than that of\nattached subjects, have withstood the attacks of the French far more\nsuccessfully than they could with their fortress, but with subjects\nwhom they had estranged.\nAnd, in truth, fortresses are unserviceable in every way, since they\nmay be lost either by the treachery of those to whom you commit their\ndefence, or by the overwhelming strength of an assailant, or else by\nfamine. And where you seek to recover a State which you have lost, and\nin which only the fortress remains to you, if that fortress is to be of\nany service or assistance to you, you must have an army wherewith to\nattack the enemy who has driven you out. But with such an army you\nmight succeed in recovering your State as readily without a fortress as\nwith one; nay, perhaps, even more readily, since your subjects, had you\nnot used them ill, from the overweening confidence your fortress gave\nyou, might then have felt better disposed towards you. And the event\nshows that in times of adversity this very fortress of Milan has been\nof no advantage whatever, either to the Sforzas or to the French; but,\non the contrary, has brought ruin on both, because, trusting to it,\nthey did not turn their thoughts to nobler methods for preserving that\nState. Guido Ubaldo, duke of Urbino and son to Duke Federigo, who in\nhis day was a warrior of much renown, but who was driven from his\ndominions by Cesare Borgia, son to Pope Alexander VI., when afterwards,\nby a sudden stroke of good fortune, he was restored to the dukedom\ncaused all the fortresses of the country to be dismantled, judging them\nto be hurtful. For as he was beloved by his subjects, so far as they\nwere concerned he had no need for fortresses; while, as against foreign\nenemies, he saw he could not defend them, since this would have\nrequired an army kept constantly in the field. For which reasons he\nmade them be razed to the ground.\nWhen Pope Julius II. had driven the Bentivogli from Bologna, after\nerecting a citadel in that town, he caused the people to be cruelly\noppressed by his governor; whereupon, the people rebelled, and he\nforthwith lost the citadel; so that his citadel, and the oppressions to\nwhich it led, were of less service to him than different behaviour on\nhis part had been. When Niccolo da Castello, the ancestor of the\nVitelli, returned to his country out of exile, he straightway pulled\ndown the two fortresses built there by Pope Sixtus IV., perceiving that\nit was not by fortresses, but by the good-will of the people, that he\ncould be maintained in his government.\nBut the most recent, and in all respects most noteworthy instance, and\nthat which best demonstrates the futility of building, and the\nadvantage of destroying fortresses, is what happened only the other day\nin Genoa. Every one knows how, in 1507, Genoa rose in rebellion against\nLouis XII. of France, who came in person and with all his forces to\nrecover it; and after recovering it built there a citadel stronger than\nany before known, being, both from its position and from every other\ncircumstance, most inaccessible to attack. For standing on the\nextremity of a hill, named by the Genoese Codefa, which juts out into\nthe sea, it commanded the whole harbour and the greater part of the\ntown. But, afterwards, in the year 1512, when the French were driven\nout of Italy, the Genoese, in spite of this citadel, again rebelled,\nand Ottaviano Fregoso assuming the government, after the greatest\nefforts, continued over a period of sixteen months, at last succeeded\nin reducing the citadel by famine. By all it was believed that he would\nretain it as a rock of refuge in case of any reverse of fortune, and by\nsome he was advised to do so; but he, being a truly wise ruler, and\nknowing well that it is by the attachment of their subjects and not by\nthe strength of their fortifications that princes are maintained in\ntheir governments, dismantled this citadel; and founding his authority,\nnot upon material defences, but on his own valour and prudence, kept\nand still keeps it. And whereas, formerly, a force of a thousand\nfoot-soldiers could effect a change in the government of Genoa, the\nenemies of Ottaviano have assailed him with ten thousand, without being\nable to harm him.\nHere, then, we see that, while to dismantle this fortress occasioned\nOttaviano no loss, its construction gave the French king no sort of\nadvantage. For when he could come into Italy with an army, he could\nrecover Genoa, though he had no citadel there; but when he could not\ncome with an army, it was not in his power to hold the city by means of\nthe citadel. Moreover it was costly for the king to build, and shameful\nfor him to lose this fortress; while for Ottaviano it was glorious to\ntake, and advantageous to destroy it.\nLet us turn now to those republics which build fortresses not within\ntheir own territories, but in towns whereof they have taken possession.\nAnd if the above example of France and Genoa suffice not to show the\nfutility of this course, that of Florence and Pisa ought, I think, to\nbe conclusive. For in erecting fortresses to hold Pisa, the Florentines\nfailed to perceive that a city which had always been openly hostile to\nthem, which had lived in freedom, and which could cloak rebellion under\nthe name of liberty, must, if it were to be retained at all, be\nretained by those methods which were used by the Romans, and either be\nmade a companion or be destroyed. Of how little service these Pisan\nfortresses were, was seen on the coming of Charles VIII. of France into\nItaly, to whom, whether through the treachery of their defenders or\nfrom fear of worse evils, they were at once delivered up; whereas, had\nthere been no fortresses in Pisa, the Florentines would not have looked\nto them as the means whereby the town was to be held; the king could\nnot by their assistance have taken the town from the Florentines; and\nthe methods whereby it had previously been preserved might, in all\nlikelihood, have continued sufficient to preserve it; and, at any rate,\nhad served that end no worse than the fortresses.\nThese, then, are the conclusions to which I come, namely, that\nfortresses built to hold your own country under are hurtful, and that\nthose built to retain acquired territories are useless; and I am\ncontent to rely on the example of the Romans, who in the towns they\nsought to hold by the strong hand, rather pulled down fortresses than\nbuilt them. And if any, to controvert these views of mine, were to cite\nthe case of Tarentum in ancient times, or of Brescia in recent, as\ntowns which when they rebelled were recovered by means of their\ncitadels; I answer, that for the recovery of Tarentum, Fabius Maximus\nwas sent at the end of a year with an army strong enough to retake it\neven had there been no fortress there; and that although he availed\nhimself of the fortress for the recovery of the town, he might, without\nit, have resorted to other means which would have brought about the\nsame result. Nor do I see of what service a citadel can be said to be,\nwhen to recover the city you must employ a consular army under a Fabius\nMaximus. But that the Romans would, in any case, have recovered\nTarentum, is plain from what happened at Capua, where there was no\ncitadel, and which they retook, simply by the valour of their soldiers.\nAgain, as regards Brescia, I say that the circumstances attending the\nrevolt of that town were such as occur but seldom, namely, that the\ncitadel remaining in your hands after the defection of the city, you\nshould happen to have a great army nigh at hand, as the French had\ntheirs on this occasion. For M. de Foix being in command of the king\u2019s\nforces at Bologna, on hearing of the loss of Brescia, marched thither\nwithout an hour\u2019s delay, and reaching Brescia in three days, retook the\ntown with the help of the citadel. But here, again, we see that, to be\nof any service, the citadel of Brescia had to be succoured by a de\nFoix, and by that French army which in three days\u2019 time marched to its\nrelief. So that this instance cannot be considered conclusive as\nagainst others of a contrary tendency. For, in the course of recent\nwars, many fortresses have been taken and retaken, with the same\nvariety of fortune with which open country has been acquired or lost;\nand this not only in Lombardy, but also in Romagna, in the kingdom of\nNaples, and in all parts of Italy.\nAnd, further, touching the erection of fortresses as a defence against\nforeign enemies, I say that such defences are not needed by the prince\nor people who possess a good army; while for those who do not possess a\ngood army, they are useless. For good armies without fortresses are in\nthemselves a sufficient defence: whereas, fortresses without good\narmies avail nothing. And this we see in the case of those nations\nwhich have been thought to excel both in their government and\notherwise, as, for instance, the Romans and the Spartans. For while the\nRomans would build no fortresses, the Spartans not merely abstained\nfrom building them, but would not even suffer their cities to be\nenclosed with walls; desiring to be protected by their own valour only,\nand by no other defence. So that when a Spartan was asked by an\nAthenian what he thought of the walls of Athens, he answered \u201cthat they\nwere fine walls if meant to hold women only.\u201d\nIf a prince who has a good army has likewise, on the sea-front of his\ndominions, some fortress strong enough to keep an enemy in check for a\nfew days, until he gets his forces together, this, though not\nnecessary, may sometimes be for his advantage. But for a prince who is\nwithout a strong army to have fortresses erected throughout his\nterritories, or upon his frontier, is either useless or hurtful, since\nthey may readily be lost and then turned against him; or, supposing\nthem so strong that the enemy is unable to take them by assault, he may\nleave them behind, and so render them wholly unprofitable. For a brave\narmy, unless stoutly met, enters an enemy\u2019s country without regard to\nthe towns or fortified places it leaves in its rear, as we read of\nhappening in ancient times, and have seen done by Francesco Maria della\nRovere, who no long while ago, when he marched against Urbino, made\nlittle of leaving ten hostile cities behind him.\nThe prince, therefore, who can bring together a strong army can do\nwithout building fortresses, while he who has not a strong army ought\nnot to build them, but should carefully strengthen the city wherein he\ndwells, and keep it well stored with supplies, and its inhabitants well\naffected, so that he may resist attack till an accord be agreed on, or\nhe be relieved by foreign aid. All other expedients are costly in time\nof peace, and in war useless.\nWhoever carefully weighs all that has now been said will perceive, that\nthe Romans, as they were most prudent in all their other methods, so\nalso showed their wisdom in the measures they took with the men of\nLatium and Privernum, when, without ever thinking of fortresses, they\nsought security in bolder and more sagacious courses.\nCHAPTER XXV.\u2014_That he who attacks a City divided against itself, must\nnot think to get possession of it through its Divisions._\nViolent dissensions breaking out in Rome between the commons and the\nnobles, it appeared to the Veientines and Etruscans that now was their\ntime to deal a fatal blow to the Roman supremacy. Accordingly, they\nassembled an army and invaded the territories of Rome. The senate sent\nCaius Manlius and Marcus Fabius to meet them, whose forces encamping\nclose by the Veientines, the latter ceased not to reproach and vilify\nthe Roman name with every sort of taunt and abuse, and so incensed the\nRomans by their unmeasured insolence that, from being divided they\nbecame reconciled, and giving the enemy battle, broke and defeated\nthem. Here, again, we see, what has already been noted, how prone men\nare to adopt wrong courses, and how often they miss their object when\nthey think to secure it. The Veientines imagined that they could\nconquer the Romans by attacking them while they were at feud among\nthemselves; but this very attack reunited the Romans and brought ruin\non their assailants. For the causes of division in a commonwealth are,\nfor the most part, ease and tranquillity, while the causes of union are\nfear and war. Wherefore, had the Veientines been wise, the more divided\nthey saw Rome to be, the more should they have sought to avoid war with\nher, and endeavoured to gain an advantage over her by peaceful arts.\nAnd the best way to effect this in a divided city lies in gaining the\nconfidence of both factions, and in mediating between them as arbiter\nso long as they do not come to blows; but when they resort to open\nviolence, then to render some tardy aid to the weaker side, so as to\nplunge them deeper in hostilities, wherein both may exhaust their\nforces without being led by your putting forth an excess of strength to\nsuspect you of a desire to ruin them and remain their master. Where\nthis is well managed, it will almost always happen that you succeed in\neffecting the object you propose to yourself.\nThe city of Pistoja, as I have said already in connection with another\nmatter, was won over to the Florentine republic by no other artifice\nthan this. For the town being split by factions, the Florentines, by\nnow favouring one side and now the other, without incurring the\nsuspicions of either, brought both to such extremities that, wearied\nout with their harassed life, they threw themselves at last of their\nown accord into the arms of Florence. The city of Siena, again, has\nnever made any change in her government which has had the support of\nthe Florentines, save when that support has been slight and\ninsignificant; for whenever the interference of Florence has been\nmarked and decided, it has had the effect of uniting all parties in\nsupport of things as they stood.\nOne other instance I shall add to those already given. Oftener than\nonce Filippo Visconti, duke of Milan, relying on their divisions, set\nwars on foot against the Florentines, and always without success; so\nthat, in lamenting over these failures, he was wont to complain that\nthe mad humours of the Florentines had cost him two millions of gold,\nwithout his having anything to show for it. The Veientines and\nEtruscans, therefore, as I have said already, were misled by false\nhopes, and in the end were routed by the Romans in a single pitched\nbattle; and any who should look hereafter to prevail on like grounds\nand by similar means against a divided people, will always find\nthemselves deceived.\nCHAPTER XXVI.\u2014_That Taunts and Abuse breed Hatred against him who uses\nthem, without yielding him any Advantage._\nTo abstain from threats and injurious language, is, methinks, one of\nthe wisest precautions a man can use. For abuse and menace take nothing\nfrom the strength of an adversary; the latter only making him more\ncautious, while the former inflames his hatred against you, and leads\nhim to consider more diligently how he may cause you hurt.\nThis is seen from the example of the Veientines, of whom I spoke in the\nlast Chapter, who, to the injury of war against the Romans, added those\nverbal injuries from which all prudent commanders should compel their\nsoldiers to refrain. For these are injuries which stir and kindle your\nenemy to vengeance, and yet, as has been said, in no way disable him\nfrom doing you hurt; so that, in truth, they are weapons which wound\nthose who use them. Of this we find a notable instance in Asia, in\nconnection with the siege of Amida. For Gabade, the Persian general,\nafter besieging this town for a great while, wearied out at last by its\nprotracted defence, determined on withdrawing his army; and had\nactually begun to strike his camp, when the whole inhabitants of the\nplace, elated by their success, came out upon the walls to taunt and\nupbraid their enemies with their cowardice and meanness of spirit, and\nto load them with every kind of abuse. Stung by these insults, Gabade,\nchanging his resolution, renewed the siege with such fury that in a few\ndays he stormed and sacked the town. And the very same thing befell the\nVeientines, who, not content, as we have seen, to make war on the\nRomans with arms, must needs assail them with foul reproaches,\nadvancing to the palisade of their camp to revile them, and molesting\nthem more with their tongues than with their swords, until the Roman\nsoldiers, who at first were most unwilling to fight, forced the consuls\nto lead them to the attack. Whereupon, the Veientines, like those\nothers of whom mention has just now been made, had to pay the penalty\nof their insolence.\nWise captains of armies, therefore, and prudent governors of cities,\nshould take all fit precautions to prevent such insults and reproaches\nfrom being used by their soldiers and subjects, either amongst\nthemselves or against an enemy. For when directed against an enemy they\nlead to the mischiefs above noticed, while still worse consequences may\nfollow from our not preventing them among ourselves by such measures as\nsensible rulers have always taken for that purpose.\nThe legions who were left behind for the protection of Capua having, as\nshall in its place be told, conspired against the Capuans, their\nconspiracy led to a mutiny, which was presently suppressed by Valerius\nCorvinus; when, as one of the conditions on which the mutineers made\ntheir submission, it was declared that whosoever should thereafter\nupbraid any soldier of these legions with having taken part in this\nmutiny, should be visited with the severest punishment. So likewise,\nwhen Tiberius Gracchus was appointed, during the war with Hannibal, to\ncommand a body of slaves, whom the Romans in their straits for soldiers\nhad furnished with arms, one of his first acts was to pass an order\nmaking it death for any to reproach his men with their servile origin.\nSo mischievous a thing did the Romans esteem it to use insulting words\nto others, or to taunt them with their shame. Whether this be done in\nsport or earnest, nothing vexes men more, or rouses them to fiercer\nindignation; \u201c_for the biting jest which flavours too much of truth,\nleaves always behind it a rankling memory._\u201d[9]\n[9] Nam faceti\u00e6 asper\u00e6, quando nimium ex vero traxere, acrem sui\nmemoriam relinquunt. _Tacit. An._ xv. 68.\nCHAPTER XXVII.\u2014_That prudent Princes and Republics should be content to\nhave obtained a Victory; for, commonly, when they are not,\ntheft-Victory turns to Defeat._\nThe use of dishonouring language towards an enemy is mostly caused by\nan insolent humour, bred by victory or the false hope of it, whereby\nmen are oftentimes led not only to speak, but also to act amiss. For\nsuch false hopes, when they gain an entry into men\u2019s minds, cause them\nto overrun their goal, and to miss opportunities for securing a certain\ngood, on the chance of obtaining some thing better, but uncertain. And\nthis, being a matter that deserves attention, because in deceiving\nthemselves men often injure their country, I desire to illustrate it by\nparticular instances, ancient and recent, since mere argument might not\nplace it in so clear a light.\nAfter routing the Romans at Cann\u00e6, Hannibal sent messengers to Carthage\nto announce his victory, and to ask support. A debate arising in the\nCarthaginian senate as to what was to be done, Hanno, an aged and wise\ncitizen, advised that they should prudently take advantage of their\nvictory to make peace with the Romans, while as conquerors they might\nhave it on favourable terms, and not wait to make it after a defeat;\nsince it should be their object to show the Romans that they were\nstrong enough to fight them, but not to peril the victory they had won\nin the hope of winning a greater. This advice was not followed by the\nCarthaginian senate, but its wisdom was well seen later, when the\nopportunity to act upon it was gone.\nWhen the whole East had been overrun by Alexander of Macedon, the\ncitizens of Tyre (then at the height of its renown, and very strong\nfrom being built, like Venice, in the sea), recognizing his greatness,\nsent ambassadors to him to say that they desired to be his good\nservants, and to yield him all obedience, yet could not consent to\nreceive either him or his soldiers within their walls. Whereupon,\nAlexander, displeased that a single city should venture to close its\ngates against him to whom all the rest of the world had thrown theirs\nopen, repulsed the Tyrians, and rejecting their overtures set to work\nto besiege their town. But as it stood on the water, and was well\nstored with victual and all other munitions needed for its defence,\nafter four months had gone, Alexander, perceiving that he was wasting\nmore time in an inglorious attempt to reduce this one city than had\nsufficed for most of his other conquests, resolved to offer terms to\nthe Tyrians, and to make them those concessions which they themselves\nhad asked. But they, puffed up by their success, not merely refused the\nterms offered, but put to death the envoy sent to propose them. Enraged\nby this, Alexander renewed the siege, and with such vigour, that he\ntook and destroyed the city, and either slew or made slaves of its\ninhabitants.\nIn the year 1512, a Spanish army entered the Florentine territory, with\nthe object of restoring the Medici to Florence, and of levying a\nsubsidy from the town; having been summoned thither by certain of the\ncitizens, who had promised them that so soon as they appeared within\nthe Florentine confines they would arm in their behalf. But when the\nSpaniards had come into the plain of the Arno, and none declared in\ntheir favour, being in sore need of supplies, they offered to make\nterms. This offer the people of Florence in their pride rejected, and\nso gave occasion for the sack of Prato and the overthrow of the\nFlorentine Republic.\nA prince, therefore, who is attacked by an enemy much more powerful\nthan himself, can make no greater mistake than to refuse to treat,\nespecially when overtures are made to him; for however poor the terms\noffered may be, they are sure to contain some conditions advantageous\nfor him who accepts them, and which he may construe as a partial\nsuccess. For which reason it ought to have been enough for the citizens\nof Tyre that Alexander was brought to accept terms which he had at\nfirst rejected; and they should have esteemed it a sufficient triumph\nthat, by their resistance in arms, they had forced so great a warrior\nto bow to their will. And, in like manner, it should have been a\nsufficient victory for the Florentines that the Spaniards had in part\nyielded to their wishes, and abated something of their own demands, the\npurport of which was to change the government of Florence, to sever her\nfrom her allegiance to France, and, further, to obtain money from her.\nFor if of these three objects the Spaniards had succeeded in securing\nthe last two, while the Florentines maintained the integrity of their\ngovernment, a fair share of honour and contentment would have fallen to\neach. And while preserving their political existence, the Florentines\nshould have made small account of the other two conditions; nor ought\nthey, even with the possibility and almost certainty of greater\nadvantages before them, to have left matters in any degree to the\narbitration of Fortune, by pushing things to extremes, and incurring\nrisks which no prudent man should incur, unless compelled by necessity.\nHannibal, when recalled by the Carthaginians from Italy, where for\nsixteen years he had covered himself with glory, to the defence of his\nnative country, found on his arrival that Hasdrubal and Syphax had been\ndefeated, the kingdom of Numidia lost, and Carthage confined within the\nlimits of her walls, and left without other resource save in him and\nhis army. Perceiving, therefore, that this was the last stake his\ncountry had to play, and not choosing to hazard it until he had tried\nevery other expedient, he felt no shame to sue for peace, judging that\nin peace rather than in war lay the best hope of safety for his\ncountry. But, when peace was refused him, no fear of defeat deterred\nhim from battle, being resolved either to conquer, if conquer he might,\nor if he must fall, to fall gloriously. Now, if a commander so valiant\nas Hannibal, at the head of an unconquered army, was willing to sue for\npeace rather than appeal to battle when he saw that by defeat his\ncountry must be enslaved, what course ought to be followed by another\ncommander, less valiant and with less experience than he? But men\nlabour under this infirmity, that they know not where to set bounds to\ntheir hopes, and building on these without otherwise measuring their\nstrength, rush headlong on destruction.\nCHAPTER XXVIII.\u2014_That to neglect the redress of Grievances, whether\npublic or private, is dangerous for a Prince or Commonwealth_.\nCertain Gauls coming to attack Etruria, and more particularly Clusium\nits chief city, the citizens of Clusium sought aid from Rome; whereupon\nthe Romans sent the three Fabii, as envoys to these Gauls, to notify to\nthem, in the name of the Roman people, that they must refrain from\nmaking war on the Etruscans. From what befell the Romans in connection\nwith this embassy, we see clearly how far men may be carried in\nresenting an affront. For these envoys arriving at the very moment when\nthe Gauls and Etruscans were about to join battle, being readier at\ndeeds than words, took part with the Etruscans and fought in their\nforemost ranks. Whence it came that the Gauls recognizing the Roman\nenvoys, turned against the Romans all the hatred which before they had\nfelt for the Etruscans; and grew still more incensed when on making\ncomplaint to the Roman senate, through their ambassador, of the wrong\ndone them, and demanding that the Fabii should be given up to them in\natonement for their offence, not merely were the offenders not given up\nor punished in any way, but, on the contrary, when the comitia met were\ncreated tribunes with consular powers. But when the Gauls found these\nmen honoured who deserved to be chastised, they concluded that what had\nhappened had been done by way of slight and insult to them, and,\nburning with fury and resentment, hastened forward to attack Rome,\nwhich they took with the exception of the Capitol.\nNow this disaster overtook the Romans entirely from their disregard of\njustice. For their envoys, who had violated the law of nations, and had\ntherefore deserved punishment, they had on the contrary treated with\nhonour. And this should make us reflect, how carefully all princes and\ncommonwealths ought to refrain from committing like wrongs, not only\nagainst communities, but also against particular men. For if a man be\ndeeply wronged, either by a private hand or by a public officer, and be\nnot avenged to his satisfaction, if he live in a republic, he will seek\nto avenge himself, though in doing so he bring ruin on his country; or\nif he live under a prince, and be of a resolute and haughty spirit, he\nwill never rest until he has wreaked his resentment against the prince,\nthough he knows it may cost him dear. Whereof we have no finer or truer\nexample than in the death of Philip of Macedon, the father of\nAlexander. For Pausanias, a handsome and high-born youth belonging to\nPhilip\u2019s court, having been most foully and cruelly dishonoured by\nAttalus, one of the foremost men of the royal household, repeatedly\ncomplained to Philip of the outrage; who for a while put him off with\npromises of vengeance, but in the end, so far from avenging him,\npromoted Attalus to be governor of the province of Greece. Whereupon,\nPausanias, seeing his enemy honoured and not punished, turned all his\nresentment from him who had outraged, against him who had not avenged\nhim, and on the morning of the day fixed for the marriage of Philip\u2019s\ndaughter to Alexander of Epirus, while Philip walked between the two\nAlexanders, his son and his son-in-law, towards the temple to celebrate\nthe nuptials, he slew him.\nThis instance nearly resembles that of the Roman envoys; and offers a\nwarning to all rulers never to think so lightly of any man as to\nsuppose, that when wrong upon wrong has been done him, he will not\nbethink himself of revenge, however great the danger he runs, or the\npunishment he thereby brings upon himself.\nCHAPTER XXIX.\u2014_That Fortune obscures the minds of Men when she would\nnot have them hinder her Designs._\nIf we note well the course of human affairs, we shall often find things\ncome about and accidents befall, against which it seems to be the will\nof Heaven that men should not provide. And if this were the case even\nin Rome, so renowned for her valour, religion, and wise ordinances, we\nneed not wonder if it be far more common in other cities and provinces\nwherein these safeguards are wanting.\nHaving here a notable opportunity to show how Heaven influences men\u2019s\nactions, Titus Livius turns it to account, and treats the subject at\nlarge and in pregnant words, where he says, that since it was Heaven\u2019s\nwill, for ends of its own, that the Romans should feel its power, it\nfirst of all caused these Fabii, who were sent as envoys to the Gauls,\nto act amiss, and then by their misconduct stirred up the Gauls to make\nwar on Rome; and, lastly, so ordered matters that nothing worthy of\ntheir name was done by the Romans to withstand their attack. For it was\nfore-ordained by Heaven that Camillus, who alone could supply the\nremedy to so mighty an evil, should be banished to Ardea; and again,\nthat the citizens, who had often created a dictator to meet attacks of\nthe Volscians and other neighbouring hostile nations, should fail to do\nso when the Gauls were marching upon Rome. Moreover, the army which the\nRomans got together was but a weak one, since they used no signal\neffort to make it strong; nay, were so dilatory in arming that they\nwere barely in time to meet the enemy at the river Allia, though no\nmore than ten miles distant from Rome. Here, again, the Roman tribunes\npitched their camp without observing any of the usual precautions,\nattending neither to the choice of ground, nor to surround themselves\nwith trench or Palisade, nor to avail themselves of any other aid,\nhuman or Divine. In ordering their army for battle, moreover, disposed\nit in weak columns, and these far apart: so that neither men nor\nofficers accomplished anything worthy of the Roman discipline. The\nbattle was bloodless for the Romans fled before they were attacked;\nmost of them retreating to Veii, the rest to Rome, where, without\nturning aside to visit their homes, they made straight for the Capitol.\nMeanwhile, the senate, so far from bethinking themselves how they might\ndefend the city, did not even attend to closing the gates; and while\nsome of them made their escape from Rome, others entered the Capitol\nalong with those who sought shelter there. It was only in the defence\nof the Capitol that any method was observed, measures being taken to\nprevent it being crowded with useless numbers, and all the victual\nwhich could be got, being brought into it to enable it to stand a\nsiege. Of the women, the children, and the men whose years unfitted\nthem for service, the most part fled for refuge to the neighbouring\ntowns, the rest remained in Rome a prey to the invaders; so that no one\nwho had heard of the achievements of the Romans in past years, on being\ntold of what took place on this occasion, could have believed that it\nwas of the same people that things so contrary were related.\nWherefore, Titus Livius, after setting forth all these disorders,\nconcludes with the words, \u201c_So far does Fortune darken men\u2019s minds when\nshe would not have her ascendency gainsaid._\u201d Nor could any juster\nobservation be made. And hence it is that those who experience the\nextremes whether of good or of evil fortune, are, commonly, little\ndeserving either of praise or blame; since it is apparent that it is\nfrom Heaven having afforded them, or denied them opportunities for\nacting worthily, that they have been brought to their greatness or to\ntheir undoing. Fortune, doubtless, when she seeks to effect great ends,\nwill often choose as her instrument a man of such sense and worth that\nhe can recognize the opportunities which she holds out to him; and, in\nlike manner, when she desires to bring about great calamities, will put\nforward such men as will of themselves contribute to that result. And\nall who stand in her way, she either removes by death, or deprives of\nthe means of effecting good. And it is well seen in the passage we are\nconsidering, how Fortune, to aggrandize Rome, and raise her to the\nheight she reached, judged it necessary, as shall be more fully shown\nin the following Book, to humble her; yet would not have her utterly\nundone. For which reason we find her causing Camillus to be banished,\nbut not put to death; suffering Rome to be taken, but not the Capitol;\nand bringing it to pass that, while the Romans took no wise precaution\nfor the defence of their city, they neglected none in defending their\ncitadel. That Rome might be taken, Fortune caused the mass of the army,\nafter the rout at the Allia, to direct its flight to Veii, thus\nwithdrawing the means wherewith the city might have been defended; but\nwhile thus disposing matters, she at the same time prepared all the\nneedful steps for its recovery, in bringing an almost entire Roman\narray to Veii, and Camillus to Ardea, so that a great force might be\nassembled for the rescue of their country, under a captain in no way\ncompromised by previous reverses, but, on the contrary, in the\nenjoyment of an untarnished renown. I might cite many modern instances\nto confirm these opinions, but since enough has been said to convince\nany fair mind, I pass them over. But once more I repeat what, from all\nhistory, may be seen to be most true, that men may aid Fortune, but not\nwithstand her; may interweave their threads with her web, but cannot\nbreak it But, for all that, they must never lose heart, since not\nknowing what their end is to be, and moving towards it by cross-roads\nand untravelled paths, they have always room for hope, and ought never\nto abandon it, whatsoever befalls, and into whatsoever straits they\ncome.\nCHAPTER XXX.\u2014_That really powerful Princes and, Commonwealths do not\nbuy Friendships with Money, but with their Valour and the Fame of their\nProwess_.\nWhen besieged in the Capitol, the Romans although expecting succour\nfrom Veii and from Camillus, nevertheless, being straitened by famine,\nentered into an agreement to buy off the Gauls with gold But at the\nvery moment when, in pursuance of this agreement, the gold was being\nweighed out, Camillus came up with his army. This, says our historian,\nwas contrived by Fortune, \u201c_that the Romans might not live thereafter\nas men ransomed for a price,_\u201d and the matter is noteworthy, not only\nwith reference to this particular occasion, but also as it bears on the\nmethods generally followed by this republic. For we never find Rome\nseeking to acquire towns, or to purchase peace with money, but always\nconfiding in her own warlike valour, which could not, I believe, be\nsaid of any other republic.\nNow, one of the tests whereby to gauge the strength of any State, is to\nobserve on what terms it lives with its neighbours: for when it so\ncarries itself that, to secure its friendship, its neighbours pay it\ntribute, this is a sure sign of its strength, but when its neighbours,\nthough of less reputation, receive payments from it, this is a clear\nproof of its weakness In the course of the Roman history we read how\nthe Massilians, the Eduans, the Rhodians, Hiero of Syracuse, the Kings\nEumenes and Massinissa, all of them neighbours to the Roman frontiers,\nin order to secure the friendship of Rome, submitted to imposts and\ntribute whenever Rome had need of them, asking no return save her\nprotection. But with a weak State we find the reverse of all this\nhappening And, to begin with our own republic of Florence, we know that\nin times past, when she was at the height of her renown, there was\nnever a lordling of Romagna who had not a subsidy from her, to say\nnothing of what she paid to the Perugians, to the Castellans, and to\nall her other neighbours But had our city been armed and strong, the\ndirect contrary would have been the case, for, to obtain her\nprotection, all would have poured money into her lap, not seeking to\nsell their friendship but to purchase hers.\nNor are the Florentines the only people who have lived on this\ndishonourable footing The Venetians have done the same, nay, the King\nof France himself, for all his great dominions, lives tributary to the\nSwiss and to the King of England; and this because the French king and\nthe others named, with a view to escape dangers rather imaginary than\nreal, have disarmed their subjects; seeking to reap a present gain by\nwringing money from them, rather than follow a course which would\nsecure their own safety and the lasting welfare of their country. Which\nill-practices of theirs, though they quiet things for a time, must in\nthe end exhaust their resources, and give rise in seasons of danger to\nincurable mischief and disorder. It would be tedious to count up how\noften in the course of their wars, the Florentines, the Venetians, and\nthe kingdom of France have had to ransom themselves from their enemies,\nand to submit to an ignominy to which, once only, the Romans were very\nnear being subjected. It would be tedious, too, to recite how many\ntowns have been bought by the Florentines and by the Venetians, which,\nafterwards, have only been a trouble to them, from their not knowing\nhow to defend with iron what they had won with gold. While the Romans\ncontinued free they adhered to this more generous and noble method, but\nwhen they came under the emperors, and these, again, began to\ndeteriorate, and to love the shade rather than the sunshine, they also\ntook to purchasing peace, now from the Parthians, now from the Germans,\nand at other times from other neighbouring nations. And this was the\nbeginning of the decline of their great empire.\nSuch are the evils that befall when you withhold arms from your\nsubjects; and this course is attended by the still greater\ndisadvantage, that the closer an enemy presses you the weaker he finds\nyou. For any one who follows the evil methods of which I speak, must,\nin order to support troops whom he thinks can be trusted to keep off\nhis enemies, be very exacting in his dealings with those of his\nsubjects who dwell in the heart of his dominions; since, to widen the\ninterval between himself and his enemies, he must subsidize those\nprinces and peoples who adjoin his frontiers. States maintained on this\nfooting may make a little resistance on their confines; but when these\nare passed by the enemy no further defence remains. Those who pursue\nsuch methods as these seem not to perceive that they are opposed to\nreason and common sense. For the heart and vital parts of the body, not\nthe extremities, are those which we should keep guarded, since we may\nlive on without the latter, but must die if the former be hurt. But the\nStates of which I speak, leaving the heart undefended, defend only the\nhands and feet. The mischief which has thus been, and is at this day\nwrought in Florence is plain enough to see. For so soon as an enemy\npenetrates within her frontiers, and approaches her heart, all is over\nwith her. And the same was witnessed a few years ago in the case of the\nVenetians, whose city, had it not been girdled by the sea, must then\nhave found its end. In France, indeed, a like result has not been seen\nso often, she being so great a kingdom as to have few enemies mightier\nthan herself. Nevertheless, when the English invaded France in the year\n1513, the whole kingdom tottered; and the King himself, as well as\nevery one else, had to own that a single defeat might have cost him his\ndominions.\nBut with the Romans the reverse of all this took place. For the nearer\nan enemy approached Rome, the more completely he found her armed for\nresistance; and accordingly we see that on the occasion of Hannibal\u2019s\ninvasion of Italy, the Romans, after three defeats, and after the\nslaughter of so many of their captains and soldiers, were still able,\nnot merely to withstand the invader, but even, in the end, to come off\nvictorious. This we may ascribe to the heart being well guarded, while\nthe extremities were but little heeded. For the strength of Rome rested\non the Roman people themselves, on the Latin league, on the confederate\ntowns of Italy, and on her colonies, from all of which sources she drew\nso numerous an army, as enabled her to subdue the whole world and to\nkeep it in subjection.\nThe truth of what I say may be further seen from the question put by\nHanno the Carthaginian to the messengers sent to Carthage by Hannibal\nafter his victory at Cann\u00e6. For when these were vaunting the\nachievements of Hannibal, they were asked by Hanno whether any one had\ncome forward on behalf of the Romans to propose terms of peace, and\nwhether any town of the Latin league or of the colonized districts had\nrevolted from the Romans. And when to both inquiries the envoys\nanswered, \u201cNo,\u201d Hanno observed that the war was no nearer an end than\non the day it was begun.\nWe can understand, therefore, as well from what has now been said, as\nfrom what I have often said before, how great a difference there is\nbetween the methods followed by the republics of the present times, and\nthose followed by the republics of antiquity; and why it is that we see\nevery day astounding losses alternate with extraordinary gains. For\nwhere men are weak, Fortune shows herself strong; and because she\nchanges, States and Governments change with her; and will continue to\nchange, until some one arise, who, following reverently the example of\nthe ancients, shall so control her, that she shall not have opportunity\nwith every revolution of the sun to display anew the greatness of her\npower.\nCHAPTER XXXI.\u2014_Of the Danger of trusting banished Men._\nThe danger of trusting those who are in exile from their own country,\nbeing one to which the rulers of States are often exposed, may, I\nthink, be fitly considered in these Discourses; and I notice it the\nmore willingly, because I am able to illustrate it by a memorable\ninstance which Titus Livius, though with another purpose, relates in\nhis history. When Alexander the Great passed with his army into Asia,\nhis brother-in-law and uncle, Alexander of Epirus, came with another\narmy into Italy, being invited thither by the banished Lucanians, who\ngave him to believe that, with their aid, he might get possession of\nthe whole of that country. But when, confiding in the promises of these\nexiles, and fed by the hopes they held out to him, he came into Italy,\nthey put him to death, their fellow-citizens having offered to restore\nthem to their country upon this condition. It behoves us, therefore, to\nremember how empty are the promises, and how doubtful the faith, of men\nin banishment from their native land. For as to their faith, it may be\nassumed that whenever they can effect their return by other means than\nyours, notwithstanding any covenants they may have made with you, they\nwill throw you over, and take part with their countrymen. And as for\nthe empty promises and delusive hopes which they set before you, so\nextreme is their desire to return home that they naturally believe many\nthings which are untrue, and designedly misrepresent many others; so\nthat between their beliefs and what they say they believe, they fill\nyou with false impressions, on which if you build, your labour is in\nvain, and you are led to engage in enterprises from which nothing but\nruin can result.\nTo this instance of Alexander I shall add only one other, that, namely,\nof Themistocles the Athenian, who, being proclaimed a traitor, fled\ninto Asia to Darius, to whom he made such lavish promises if he would\nonly attack Greece, that he induced him to undertake the enterprise.\nBut afterwards, when he could not fulfil what he had promised, either\nfrom shame, or through fear of punishment, he poisoned himself. But, if\nsuch a mistake as this was made by a man like Themistocles, we may\nreckon that mistakes still greater will be made by those who, being of\na feebler nature, suffer themselves to be more completely swayed by\ntheir feelings and wishes Wherefore, let a prince be careful how he\nembarks in any enterprise on the representations of an exile; for\notherwise, he is likely either to be put to shame, or to incur the\ngravest calamities.\nBecause towns are sometimes, though seldom, taken by craft, through\nsecret practices had with their inhabitants, I think it not out of\nplace to discuss the matter in the following Chapter, wherein I shall\nlikewise show in how many ways the Romans were wont to make such\nacquisitions.\nCHAPTER XXXII.\u2014_In how many Ways the Romans gained Possession of\nTowns._\nTurning their thoughts wholly to arms, the Romans always conducted\ntheir military enterprises in the most advantageous way, both as to\ncost and every other circumstance of war. For which reason they avoided\nattempting towns by siege, judging the expense and inconvenience of\nthis method of carrying on war greatly to outweigh any advantage to be\ngained by it. Accordingly, they thought it better and more for their\ninterest to reduce towns in any other way than this; and in all those\nyears during which they were constantly engaged in wars we find very\nfew instances of their proceeding by siege.\nFor the capture of towns, therefore, they trusted either to assault or\nto surrender. Assaults were effected either by open force, or by force\nand stratagem combined. When a town was assailed by open force, the\nwalls were stormed without being breached, and the assailants were said\n\u201c_aggredi urbem corona,_\u201d because they encircled the city with their\nentire strength and kept up an attack on all sides. In this way they\noften succeeded in carrying towns, and even great towns, at a first\nonset, as when Scipio took new Carthage in Spain. But when they failed\nto carry a town by storm, they set themselves to breach the walls with\nbattering rams and other warlike engines; or they dug mines so as to\nobtain an entrance within the walls, this being the method followed in\ntaking Veii; or else, to be on a level with the defenders, they erected\ntowers of timber or threw up mounds of earth against the outside of the\nwalls so as to reach the top.\nOf these methods of attack, the first, wherein the city was entirely\nsurrounded, exposed the defenders to more sudden perils and left them\nmore doubtful remedies. For while it was necessary for them to have a\nsufficient force at all points, it might happen that the forces at\ntheir disposal were not numerous enough to be everywhere at once, or to\nrelieve one another. Or if their numbers were sufficient, they might\nnot all be equally resolute in standing their ground, and their failure\nat any one point involved a general defeat. Consequently, as I have\nsaid, this method of attack was often successful. But when it did not\nsucceed at the first, it was rarely renewed, being a method dangerous\nto the attacking army, which having to secure itself along an extended\nline, was left everywhere too weak to resist a sally made from the\ntown; nay, of itself, was apt to fall into confusion and disorder. This\nmethod of attack, therefore, could be attempted once only and by way of\nsurprise.\nAgainst breaches in the walls the defence was, as at the present day,\nto throw up new works; while mines were met by counter-mines, in which\nthe enemy were either withstood at the point of the sword, or baffled\nby some other warlike contrivance; as by filling casks with feathers,\nwhich, being set on fire and placed in the mine, choked out the\nassailants by their smoke and stench. Where towers were employed for\nthe attack, the defenders sought to destroy them with fire; and where\nmounds of earth were thrown up against the walls, they would dig holes\nat the base of the wall against which the mound rested, and carry off\nthe earth which the enemy were heaping up; which, being removed from\nwithin as fast as it was thrown up from without, the mound made no\nprogress.\nNone of these methods of attack can long be persisted in and the\nassailant, if unsuccessful, must either strike his camp and seek\nvictory in some other direction, as Scipio did when he invaded Africa\nand, after failing in the attempt to storm Utica, withdrew from his\nattack on that town and turned his strength against the Carthaginian\narmy in the field; or else recourse must be had to regular siege, as by\nthe Romans at Veii, Capua, Carthage, Jerusalem, and divers other cities\nwhich they reduced in this way.\nThe capture of towns by stratagem combined with force is effected, as\nby the Romans at Pal\u00e6opolis, through a secret understanding with some\nwithin the walls. Many attempts of this sort have been made, both by\nthe Romans and by others, but few successfully, because the least\nhindrance disarranges the plan of action, and because such hindrances\nare very likely to occur. For either the plot is discovered before it\ncan be carried out, as it readily may, whether from treachery on the\npart of those to whom it has been communicated, or from the\ndifficulties which attend its inception, the preliminary arrangements\nhaving to be made with the enemy and with persons with whom it is not\npermitted, save under some pretext or other, to hold intercourse; or if\nit be not discovered while it is being contrived, a thousand\ndifficulties will still be met with in its execution. For if you arrive\neither before or after the appointed time, all is ruined. The faintest\nsound, as of the cackling of the geese in the Capitol, the least\ndeparture from some ordinary routine, the most trifling mistake or\nerror, mars the whole enterprise. Add to which, the darkness of night\nlends further terror to the perils of such undertakings; while the\ngreat majority of those engaged in them, having no knowledge of the\ndistrict or places into which they are brought, are bewildered and\ndisconcerted by the least mishap, and put to flight by every imaginary\ndanger. In secret nocturnal enterprises of this sort, no man was ever\nmore successful than Aratus of Sicyon, although in any encounter by day\nthere never was a more arrant coward. This we must suppose due rather\nto some special and occult quality inherent in the man, than to success\nbeing naturally to be looked for in the like attempts. Such\nenterprises, accordingly, are often planned, but few are put into\nexecution, and fewer still with success.\nWhen cities are acquired by surrender, the surrender is either\nvoluntary or under compulsion; voluntary, when the citizens appeal to\nyou for protection against some threatened danger from without, as\nCapua submitted to the Romans; or where they are moved by a desire to\nbe better governed, and are attracted by the good government which he\nto whom they surrender is seen exercising over others who have placed\nthemselves in his hands; as was the case with the Rhodians, the\nMassilians, and others who for like causes gave themselves up to the\nRoman people. Compulsory surrenders take place, either as the result of\na protracted siege, like those we have spoken of above; or from the\ncountry being continually wasted by incursions, forays, and similar\nseverities, to escape which a city makes its submission.\nOf the methods which have been noticed, the Romans, in preference to\nall others, used this last; and for four hundred and fifty years made\nit their aim to wear out their neighbours by invasion and by defeat in\nthe open field, while endeavouring, as I have elsewhere said, to\nestablish their influence over them by treaties and conventions. It was\nto this method of warfare therefore that they always mainly trusted,\nbecause, after trying all others, they found none so free from\ninconvenience and disadvantage\u2014the procedure by siege involving expense\nand delay, that by assault, difficulty and danger, and that by secret\npractice, uncertainty and doubt. They found, likewise, that while in\nsubduing one obstinate city by siege many years might be wasted, a\nkingdom might be gained in a single day by the defeat of a hostile army\nin the field.\nCHAPTER XXXIII.\u2014_That the Romans intrusted the Captains of their Armies\nwith the fullest Powers._\nIn reading this History of Titus Livius with a view to profit by it, I\nthink that all the methods of conduct followed by the Roman people and\nsenate merit attention. And among other things fit to be considered, it\nshould be noted, with how ample an authority they sent forth their\nconsuls, their dictators, and the other captains of their armies, all\nof whom we find clothed with the fullest powers: no other prerogative\nbeing reserved to itself by the senate save that of declaring war and\nmaking peace, while everything else was left to the discretion and\ndetermination of the consul. For so soon as the people and senate had\nresolved on war, for instance on a war against the Latins, they threw\nall further responsibility upon the consul, who might fight or decline\nbattle as he pleased, and attack this or the other city as he thought\nfit.\nThat this was so, is seen in many instances, and especially from what\nhappened during an expedition made against the Etruscans. For the\nconsul Fabius having routed that people near Sutrium, and thinking to\npass onward through the Ciminian forest into Etruria, so far from\nseeking the advice of the senate, gave them no hint whatever of his\ndesign, although for its execution the war had to be carried into a\nnew, difficult, and dangerous country. We have further witness to the\nsame effect, in the action taken in respect of this enterprise by the\nsenate, who being informed of the victory obtained by Fabius, and\napprehending that he might decide to pass onward through the aforesaid\nforest, and deeming it inexpedient that he should incur risk by\nattempting this invasion, sent two messengers to warn him not to enter\nEtruria. These messengers, however, did not come up with the consul\nuntil he had already made his way into that country and gained a second\nvictory; when, instead of opposing his further advance, they returned\nto Rome to announce his good fortune and the glory which he had won.\nWhoever, therefore, shall well consider the character of the authority\nwhereof I speak, will see that it was most wisely accorded; since had\nit been the wish of the senate that a consul, in conducting a war,\nshould proceed step by step as they might direct him, this must have\nmade him at once less cautious and more dilatory; because the credit of\nvictory would not then have seemed to be wholly his own, but shared by\nthe senate on whose advice he acted. Besides which, the senate must\nhave taken upon itself the task of advising on matters which it could\nnot possibly understand; for although it might contain among its\nmembers all who were most versed in military affairs, still, since\nthese men were not on the spot, and were ignorant of many particulars\nwhich, if they were to give sound advice, it was necessary for them to\nknow, they must in advising have made numberless mistakes. For these\nreasons they desired that the consul should act on his own\nresponsibility, and that the honours of success should be wholly his;\njudging that the love of fame would act on him at once as a spur and as\na curb, making him do whatever he had to do well.\nThis matter I have the rather dwelt upon because I observe that our\nmodern republics, such as the Venetian and the Florentine, view it in a\ndifferent light; so that when their captains, commissaries, or\n_provedditori_ have a single gun to place in position, the authorities\nat home must be informed and consulted; a course deserving the same\napproval as is due to all those other methods of theirs, which, one\nwith another, have brought Italy to her present condition.\nBOOK III.\nCHAPTER I.\u2014_For a Sect or Commonwealth to last long, it must often be\nbrought back to its Beginnings._\nDoubtless, all the things of this world have a limit set to their\nduration; yet those of them the bodies whereof have not been suffered\nto grow disordered, but have been so cared for that either no change at\nall has been wrought in them, or, if any, a change for the better and\nnot for the worse, will run that course which Heaven has in a general\nway appointed them. And since I am now speaking of mixed bodies, for\nStates and Sects are so to be regarded, I say that for them these are\nwholesome changes which bring them back to their first beginnings.\nThose States consequently stand surest and endure longest which, either\nby the operation of their institutions can renew themselves, or come to\nbe renewed by accident apart from any design. Nothing, however, can be\nclearer than that unless thus renewed these bodies do not last. Now the\nway to renew them is, as I have said, to bring them back to their\nbeginnings, since all beginnings of sects, commonwealths, or kingdoms\nmust needs have in them a certain excellence, by virtue of which they\ngain their first reputation and make their first growth. But because in\nprogress of time this excellence becomes corrupted, unless something be\ndone to restore it to what it was at first, these bodies necessarily\ndecay; for as the physicians tell us in speaking of the human body,\n\u201c_Something or other is daily added which sooner or later will require\ntreatment._\u201d[10]\n[10] \u201cQuod quotidie aggregatur aliquid quod quandoque indiget\ncuratione.\u201d\nAs regards commonwealths, this return to the point of departure is\nbrought about either by extrinsic accident or by intrinsic foresight.\nAs to the first, we have seen how it was necessary that Rome should be\ntaken by the Gauls, that being thus in a manner reborn, she might\nrecover life and vigour, and resume the observances of religion and\njustice which she had suffered to grow rusted by neglect. This is well\nseen from those passages of Livius wherein he tells us that when the\nRoman army was \u2018sent forth against the Gauls, and again when tribunes\nwere created with consular authority, no religious rites whatever were\ncelebrated, and wherein he further relates how the Romans not only\nfailed to punish the three Fabii, who contrary to the law of nations\nhad fought against the Gauls, but even clothed them with honour. For,\nfrom these instances, we may well infer that the rest of the wise\nordinances instituted by Romulus, and the other prudent kings, had\nbegun to be held of less account than they deserved, and less than was\nessential for the maintenance of good government.\nAnd therefore it was that Rome was visited by this calamity from\nwithout, to the end that all her ordinances might be reformed, and the\npeople taught that it behoved them not only to maintain religion and\njustice, but also to esteem their worthy citizens, and to prize their\nvirtues beyond any advantages of which they themselves might seem to\nhave been deprived at their instance. And this, we find, was just the\neffect produced. For no sooner was the city retaken, than all the\nordinances of the old religion were at once restored; the Fabii, who\nhad fought in violation of the law of nations, were punished; and the\nworth and excellence of Camillus so fully recognized, that the senate\nand the whole people, laying all jealousies aside, once more committed\nto him the entire charge of public affairs.\nIt is necessary then, as I have said already, that where men dwell\ntogether in a regulated society, they be often reminded of those\nordinances in conformity with which they ought to live, either by\nsomething inherent in these, or else by some external accident. A\nreminder is given in the former of these two ways, either by the\npassing of some law whereby the members of the society are brought to\nan account; or else by some man of rare worth arising among them, whose\nvirtuous life and example have the same effect as a law. In a\nCommonwealth, accordingly, this end is served either by the virtues of\nsome one of its citizens, or by the operation of its institutions.\nThe institutions whereby the Roman Commonwealth was led back to its\nstarting point, were the tribuneship of the people and the censorship,\ntogether with all those laws which were passed to check the insolence\nand ambition of its citizens. Such institutions, however, require fresh\nlife to be infused into them by the worth of some one man who\nfearlessly devotes himself to give them effect in opposition to the\npower of those who set them at defiance.\nOf the laws being thus reinforced in Rome, before its capture by the\nGauls, we have notable examples in the deaths of the sons of Brutus, of\nthe Decemvirs, and of Manlius Frumentarius; and after its capture, in\nthe deaths of Manlius Capitolinus, and of the son of Manlius Torquatus\nin the prosecution of his master of the knights by Papirius Cursor, and\nin the impeachment of the Scipios. Such examples as these, being signal\nand extraordinary, had the effect, whenever they took place, of\nbringing men back to the true standard of right; but when they came to\nbe of rarer occurrence, they left men more leisure to grow corrupted,\nand were attended by greater danger and disturbance. Wherefore, between\none and another of these vindications of the laws, no more than ten\nyears, at most, ought to intervene; because after that time men begin\nto change their manners and to disregard the laws; and if nothing occur\nto recall the idea of punishment, and unless fear resume its hold on\ntheir minds, so many offenders suddenly spring up together that it is\nimpossible to punish them without danger. And to this purport it used\nto be said by those who ruled Florence from the year 1434 to 1494, that\ntheir government could hardly be maintained unless it was renewed every\nfive years; by which they meant that it was necessary for them to\narouse the same terror and alarm in men\u2019s minds, as they inspired when\nthey first assumed the government, and when all who offended against\ntheir authority were signally chastised. For when the recollection of\nsuch chastisement has died out, men are emboldened to engage in new\ndesigns, and to speak ill of their rulers; for which the only remedy is\nto restore things to what they were at first.\nA republic may, likewise, be brought back to its original form, without\nrecourse to ordinances for enforcing justice, by the mere virtues of a\nsingle citizen, by reason that these virtues are of such influence and\nauthority that good men love to imitate them, and bad men are ashamed\nto depart from them. Those to whom Rome owed most for services of this\nsort, were Horatius Cocles, Mutius Sc\u00e6vola, the two Decii, Atilius\nRegulus, and divers others, whose rare excellence and generous example\nwrought for their city almost the same results as might have been\neffected by ordinances and laws. And if to these instances of\nindividual worth had been added, every ten years, some signal\nenforcement of justice, it would have been impossible for Rome ever to\nhave grown corrupted. But when both of these incitements to virtuous\nbehavior began to recur less frequently, corruption spread, and after\nthe time of Atilius Regulus, no like example was again witnessed. For\nthough the two Catos came later, so great an interval had elapsed\nbefore the elder Cato appeared, and again, so long a period intervened\nbetween him and the younger, and these two, moreover, stood so much\nalone, that it was impossible for them, by their influence, to work any\nimportant change; more especially for the younger, who found Rome so\nmuch corrupted that he could do nothing to improve his fellow-citizens.\nThis is enough to say concerning commonwealths, but as regards sects,\nwe see from the instance of our own religion that here too a like\nrenewal is needed. For had not this religion of ours been brought back\nto its original condition by Saint Francis and Saint Dominick, it must\nsoon have been utterly extinguished. They, however, by their voluntary\npoverty, and by their imitation of the life of Christ, rekindled in the\nminds of men the dying flame of faith; and by the efficacious rules\nwhich they established averted from our Church that ruin which the ill\nlives of its prelates and heads must otherwise have brought upon it.\nFor living in poverty, and gaining great authority with the people by\nconfessing them and preaching to them, they got them to believe that it\nis evil to speak ill even of what is evil; and that it is good to be\nobedient to rulers, who, if they do amiss, may be left to the judgment\nof God. By which teaching these rulers are encouraged to behave as\nbadly as they can, having no fear of punishments which they neither see\nnor credit. Nevertheless, it is this renewal which has maintained, and\nstill maintains, our religion.\nKingdoms also stand in need of a like renewal, and to have their laws\nrestored to their former force; and we see how, by attending to this,\nthe kingdom of France has profited. For that kingdom, more than any\nother, lies under the control of its laws and ordinances, which are\nmaintained by its parliaments, and more especially by the parliament of\nParis, from which last they derive fresh vigour whenever they have to\nbe enforced against any prince of the realm; for this assembly\npronounces sentence even against the king himself. Heretofore this\nparliament has maintained its name as the fearless champion of the laws\nagainst the nobles of the land; but should it ever at any future time\nsuffer wrongs to pass unpunished, and should offences multiply, either\nthese will have to be corrected with great disturbance to the State, or\nthe kingdom itself must fall to pieces.\nThis, then, is our conclusion\u2014that nothing is so necessary in any\nsociety, be it a religious sect, a kingdom, or a commonwealth, as to\nrestore to it that reputation which it had at first, and to see that it\nis provided either with wholesome laws, or with good men whose actions\nmay effect the same ends, without need to resort to external force. For\nalthough this last may sometimes, as in the case of Rome, afford an\nefficacious remedy, it is too hazardous a remedy to make us ever wish\nto employ it.\nAnd that all may understand how much the actions of particular citizens\nhelped to make Rome great, and how many admirable results they wrought\nin that city, I shall now proceed to set them forth and examine them;\nwith which survey this Third Book of mine, and last division of the\nFirst Decade of Titus Livius, shall be brought to a close. But,\nalthough great and notable actions were done by the Roman kings,\nnevertheless, since history has treated of these at much length, here I\nshall pass them over, and say no more about these princes, save as\nregards certain things done by them with an eye to their private\ninterest. I shall begin, therefore, with Brutus, the father of Roman\nfreedom.\nCHAPTER II.\u2014_That on occasion it is wise to feign Folly._\nNever did any man by the most splendid achievements gain for himself so\ngreat a name for wisdom and prudence as is justly due to Junius Brutus\nfor feigning to be a fool. And although Titus Livius mentions one cause\nonly as having led him to assume this part, namely, that he might live\nmore securely and look after his patrimony; yet on considering his\nbehavior we may believe that in counterfeiting folly it was also his\nobject to escape notice, and so find better convenience to overthrow\nthe kings, and to free his country whenever an occasion offered. That\nthis was in his mind is seen first of all from the interpretation he\ngave to the oracle of Apollo, when, to render the gods favourable to\nhis designs, he pretended to stumble, and secretly kissed his mother\nearth; and, again, from this, that on the death of Lucretia, though her\nfather, her husband, and others of her kinsmen were present, he was the\nfirst to draw the dagger from her wound, and bind the bystanders by\noath never more to suffer king to reign in Rome.\nFrom his example all who are discontented with their prince are taught,\nfirst of all, to measure, and to weigh their strength, and if they find\nthemselves strong enough to disclose their hostility and proclaim open\nwar, then to take that course as at once the nobler and less dangerous;\nbut, if too weak to make open war, then sedulously to court the favour\nof the prince, using to that end all such methods as they may judge\nneedful, adapting themselves to his pleasures, and showing delight in\nwhatever they see him delight in. Such an intimacy, in the first place,\nenables you to live securely, and permits you, without incurring any\nrisk, to share the happy fortunes of the prince, while it affords you\nevery facility for carrying out your plans. Some, no doubt, will tell\nyou that you should not stand so near the prince as to be involved in\nhis downfall; nor yet at such a distance that when he falls you shall\nbe too far off to use the occasion for rising on his ruin. But although\nthis mean course, could we only follow it, were certainly the best,\nyet, since I believe it to be impracticable, we must resort to the\nmethods above indicated, and either keep altogether aloof, or else\ncleave closely to the prince. Whosoever does otherwise, if he be of\ngreat station, lives in constant peril; nor will it avail him to say,\n\u201cI concern myself with nothing; I covet neither honours nor preferment;\nmy sole wish is to live a quiet and peaceful life.\u201d For such excuses,\nthough they be listened to, are not accepted; nor can any man of great\nposition, however much and sincerely he desire it, elect to live this\nlife of tranquillity since his professions will not be believed; so\nthat although he might be contented to be let alone, others will not\nsuffer him to be so. Wherefore, like Brutus, men must feign folly; and\nto play the part effectively, and so as to please their prince, must\nsay, do, see, and praise things contrary to their inclinations.\nBut now, having spoken of the prudence shown by Brutus when he sought\nto recover the freedom of Rome, let us next speak of the severity which\nhe used to maintain it.\nCHAPTER III.\u2014_That to preserve a newly acquired Freedom we must slay\nthe Sons of Brutus._\nThe severity used by Brutus in preserving for Rome the freedom he had\nwon for her, was not less necessary than useful. The spectacle of a\nfather sitting on the judgment, and not merely sentencing his own sons\nto death, but being himself present at their execution, affords an\nexample rare in history. But those who study the records of ancient\ntimes will understand, that after a change in the form of a government,\nwhether it be from a commonwealth to a tyranny or from a tyranny to a\ncommonwealth, those who are hostile to the new order of things must\nalways be visited with signal punishment. So that he who sets up as a\ntyrant and slays not Brutus, and he who creates a free government and\nslays not the sons of Brutus, can never maintain himself long. But\nsince I have elsewhere treated of this matter at large, I shall merely\nrefer to what has there been said concerning it, and shall cite here\none instance only, happening in our own days, and memorable in the\nhistory of our country.\nI speak of Piero Soderini, who thought by his patience and goodness to\novercome the very same temper which prompted the sons of Brutus to\nrevert to the old government, and who failed in the endeavour. For\nalthough his sagacity should have taught him the necessity, while\nchance and the ambition of those who attacked him furnished him with\nthe opportunity of making an end of them, he never could resolve to\nstrike the blow; and not merely believed himself able to subdue\ndisaffection by patience and kindness, and to mitigate the enmity of\nparticular men by the rewards he held out to them, but also persuaded\nhimself, and often declared in the presence of his friends, that he\ncould not confront opposition openly, nor crush his adversaries,\nwithout assuming extraordinary powers and passing laws destructive of\ncivil equality; which measures, although not afterward used by him for\ntyrannical ends, would so alarm the community, that after his death\nthey would never again consent to appoint a Gonfalonier for life, an\noffice which he judged it essential both to maintain and strengthen.\nNow although these scruples of his were wise and good, we ought never\nout of regard for what is good, to suffer an evil to run its course,\nsince it may well happen that the evil will prevail over the good. And\nPiero should have believed that as his acts and intentions were to be\njudged by results, he might, if he lived and if fortune befriended him,\nhave made it clear to all, that what he did was done to preserve his\ncountry, and not from personal ambition; and he might have so contrived\nmatters that no successor of his could ever turn to bad ends the means\nwhich he had used for good ends. But he was misled by a preconceived\nopinion, and failed to understand that ill-will is not to be vanquished\nby time nor propitiated by favours. And, so, from not knowing how to\nresemble Brutus, he lost power, and fame, and was driven an exile from\nhis country.\nThat it is as hard a matter to preserve a princedom as it is to\npreserve a commonwealth, will be shown in the Chapter following.\nCHAPTER IV.\u2014_That an Usurper is never safe in his Princedom while those\nlive whom he has deprived of it._\nFrom what befell the elder Tarquin at the hands of the sons of Ancus,\nand Servius Tullius at the hands of Tarquin the Proud, we see what an\narduous and perilous course it is to strip a king of his kingdom and\nyet suffer him to live on, hoping to conciliate him by benefits. We\nsee, too, how the elder Tarquin was ruined by his belief that he held\nthe kingdom by a just title, since it had been given him by the people\nand confirmed to him by the senate, never suspecting that the sons of\nAncus would be so stirred by resentment that it would be impossible to\ncontent them with what contented all the rest of Rome. Servius Tullius\nagain, was ruined through believing that he could conciliate the sons\nof Ancus by loading them with favours.\nBy the fate of the first of these kings every prince may be warned that\nhe can never live securely in his princedom so long as those from whom\nhe has taken it survive; while the fate of the second should remind all\nrulers that old injuries are not to be healed by subsequent benefits,\nand least of all when the new benefit is less in degree than the injury\nsuffered. And, truly, Servius was wanting in wisdom when he imagined\nthat the sons of Tarquin would contentedly resign themselves to be the\nsons-in-law of one whom they thought should be their subject. For the\ndesire to reign is so prevailing a passion, that it penetrates the\nminds not only of those who are rightful heirs, but also of those who\nare not; as happened with the wife of the younger Tarquin, who was\ndaughter to Servius, but who, possessed by this madness, and setting at\nnaught all filial duty, incited her husband to take her father\u2019s\nkingdom, and with it his life; so much nobler did she esteem it to be a\nqueen than the daughter of a king. But while the elder Tarquin and\nServius Tullius lost the kingdom from not knowing how to secure\nthemselves against those whom they had deprived of it, the younger\nTarquin lost it from not observing the ordinances of the old kings, as\nshall be shown in the following Chapter.\nCHAPTER V.\u2014_How an Hereditary King may come to lose his Kingdom._\nTarquin the Proud, when he had put Servius Tullius to death, inasmuch\nas the latter left no heirs, took secure possession of the kingdom,\nhaving nothing to fear from any of those dangers which had stood in the\nway of his predecessors. And although the means whereby he made himself\nking were hateful and monstrous, nevertheless, had he adhered to the\nancient ordinances of the earlier kings, he might have been endured,\nnor would he have aroused both senate and people to combine against him\nand deprive him of his government. It was not, therefore, because his\nson Sextus violated Lucretia that Tarquin was driven out, but because\nhe himself had violated the laws of the kingdom, and governed as a\ntyrant, stripping the senate of all authority, and bringing everything\nunder his own control. For all business which formerly had been\ntransacted in public, and with the sanction of the senate, he caused to\nbe transacted in his palace, on his own responsibility, and to the\ndispleasure of every one else, and so very soon deprived Rome of\nwhatever freedom she had enjoyed under her other kings.\nNor was it enough for him to have the Fathers his enemies, but he must\nneeds also kindle the commons against him, wearing them out with mere\nmechanic labours, very different from the enterprises in which they had\nbeen employed by his predecessors; so that when Rome overflowed with\ninstances of his cruelty and pride, he had already disposed the minds\nof all the citizens to rebel whenever they found the opportunity.\nWherefore, had not occasion offered in the violence done to Lucretia,\nsome other had soon been found to bring about the same result. But had\nTarquin lived like the other kings, when Sextus his son committed that\noutrage, Brutus and Collatinus would have had recourse to him to punish\nthe offender, and not to the commons of Rome. And hence let princes\nlearn that from the hour they first violate those laws, customs, and\nusages under which men have lived for a great while, they begin to\nweaken the foundations of their authority. And should they, after they\nhave been stripped of that authority, ever grow wise enough to see how\neasily princedoms are preserved by those who are content to follow\nprudent counsels, the sense of their loss will grieve them far more,\nand condemn them to a worse punishment than any they suffer at the\nhands of others. For it is far easier to be loved by good men than by\nbad, and to obey the laws than to seek to control them.\nAnd to learn what means they must use to retain their authority, they\nhave only to take example by the conduct of good princes, such as\nTimoleon of Corinth, Aratus of Sicyone, and the like, in whose lives\nthey will find such security and content, both on the side of the ruler\nand the ruled, as ought to stir them with the desire to imitate them,\nwhich, for the reasons already given, it is easy for them to do. For\nmen, when they are well governed, ask no more, nor look for further\nfreedom; as was the case with the peoples governed by the two whom I\nhave named, whom they constrained to continue their rulers while they\nlived, though both of them sought repeatedly to return to private life.\nBut because, in this and the two preceding Chapters, I have noticed the\nill-will which arose against the kings, the plots contrived by the sons\nof Brutus against their country, and those directed against the elder\nTarquin and Servius Tullius, it seems to me not out of place to\ndiscourse of these matters more at length in the following Chapter, as\ndeserving the attention both of princes and private citizens.\nCHAPTER VI.\u2014_Of Conspiracies._\nIt were an omission not to say something on the subject of\nconspiracies, these being a source of much danger both to princes and\nto private men. For we see that many more princes have lost their lives\nand states through these than in open warfare; power to wage open war\nupon a prince being conceded to few, whereas power to conspire against\nhim is denied to none. On the other hand, since conspiracies are\nattended at every stage by difficulties and dangers, no more hazardous\nor desperate undertakings can be engaged in by any private citizen;\nwhence it comes that while many conspiracies are planned, few effect\ntheir object. Wherefore, to put princes on their guard against these\ndangers, and to make subjects more cautious how they take part in them,\nand rather learn to live content under whatever government fortune has\nassigned them, I shall treat of them at length, without omitting any\nnoteworthy circumstance which may serve for the instruction of either.\nThough, indeed, this is a golden sentence Of Cornelius Tacitus, wherein\nhe says that \u201c_the past should have our reverence, the present our\nobedience, and that we should wish for good princes, but put up with\nany._\u201d[11] For assuredly whosoever does otherwise is likely to bring\nruin both on himself and on his country.\n[11] _Tac. Hist._ iv. 8.\nBut, to go deeper into the matter, we have first of all to examine\nagainst whom conspiracies are directed; and we shall find that men\nconspire either against their country or their prince; and it is of\nthese two kinds of conspiracy that at present I desire to speak. For of\nconspiracies which have for their object the surrender of cities to\nenemies who are besieging them, and of all others contrived for like\nends, I have already said enough.\nFirst, then, I shall treat of those conspiracies which are directed\nagainst a prince, and begin by inquiring into their causes, which are\nmanifold, but of which one is more momentous than all the rest; I mean,\nthe being hated by the whole community. For it may reasonably be\nassumed, that when a prince has drawn upon himself this universal\nhatred, he must also have given special offence to particular men,\nwhich they will be eager to avenge. And this eagerness will be\naugmented by the feeling of general ill-will which the prince is seen\nto have incurred. A prince ought, therefore, to avoid this load of\npublic hatred. How he is to do so I need not stop here to explain,\nhaving discussed the matter already in another place; but if he can\nguard against this, offence given to particular men will expose him to\nbut few attacks. One reason being, that there are few men who think so\nmuch of an injury done them as to run great risks to revenge it;\nanother, that assuming them to have both the disposition and the\ncourage to avenge themselves, they are restrained by the universal\nfavour which they see entertained towards the prince.\nInjuries are either to a man\u2019s life, to his property, or to his honour.\nAs regards the first, they who threaten injuries to life incur more\ndanger than they who actually inflict them; or rather, while great\ndanger is incurred in threatening, none at all is incurred from\ninflicting such injuries. For the dead are past thinking of revenge;\nand those who survive, for the most part leave such thoughts to the\ndead. But he whose life is threatened, finding himself forced by\nnecessity either to do or suffer, becomes a man most dangerous to the\nprince, as shall be fully explained hereafter.\nAfter menaces to life, injuries to property and honour stir men more\nthan any others, and of these a Prince has most to beware. For he can\nnever strip a man so bare of his possessions as not to leave him some\nweapon wherewith to redress his wrongs, nor ever so far dishonour him\nas to quell the stubborn spirit which prompts revenge. Of all\ndishonours those done to the women of a household are the worst; after\nwhich come such personal indignities as nerved the arm of Pausanias\nagainst Philip of Macedon, and of many another against other princes;\nand, in our own days, it was no other reason that moved Giulio Belanti\nto conspire against Pandolfo, lord of Siena, than that Pandolfo, who\nhad given him his daughter to wife, afterwards took her from him, as\npresently shall be told. Chief among the causes which led the Pazzi to\nconspire against the Medici, was the law passed by the latter depriving\nthem of the inheritance of Giovanni Bonromei.\nAnother most powerful motive to conspire against a prince is the desire\nmen feel to free their country from a usurper. This it was which\nimpelled Brutus and Cassius to conspire against C\u00e6sar, and countless\nothers against such tyrants as Phalaris, Dionysius, and the like.\nAgainst this humour no tyrant can guard, except by laying down his\ntyranny; which as none will do, few escape an unhappy end. Whence the\nverses of Juvenal:\u2014\n\u201cFew tyrants die a peaceful death, and few\nThe kings who visit Proserpine\u2019s dread lord,\nUnscathed by wounds and blood.\u201d[12]\n[12] Ad generum Cereris sine caede et vulnere pauci\nDescendunt reges, et sicca morte tiranni.\n_Juv. Sat._ x. 112.\nGreat, as I have said already, are the dangers which men run in\nconspiring; for at all times they are in peril, whether in contriving,\nin executing, or after execution. And since in conspiracies either many\nare engaged, or one only (for although it cannot properly be said of\n_one_ man that he _conspires_, there may exist in him the fixed resolve\nto put the prince to death), it is only the solitary plotter who\nescapes the first of these three stages of danger. For he runs no risk\nbefore executing his design, since as he imparts it to none, there is\nnone to bring it to the ear of the prince. A deliberate resolve like\nthis may be conceived by a person in any rank of life, high or low,\nbase or noble, and whether or no he be the familiar of his prince. For\nevery one must, at some time or other, have leave to speak to the\nprince, and whoever has this leave has opportunity to accomplish his\ndesign. Pausanias, of whom we have made mention so often, slew Philip\nof Macedon as he walked between his son and his son-in-law to the\ntemple, surrounded by a thousand armed guards. Pausanias indeed was\nnoble, and known to the prince, but Ferdinand of Spain was stabbed in\nthe neck by a poor and miserable Spaniard; and though the wound was not\nmortal, it sufficed to show that neither courage nor opportunity were\nwanting to the would-be-assassin. A Dervish, or Turkish priest, drew\nhis scimitar on Bajazet, father of the Sultan now reigning, and if he\ndid not wound him, it was from no lack either of daring or of\nopportunity. And I believe that there are many who in their minds\ndesire the deed, no punishment or danger attending the mere wish,\nthough there be but few who dare do it. For since few or none who\nventure, escape death, few are willing to go forward to certain\ndestruction.\nBut to pass from these solitary attempts to those in which several are\nengaged, I affirm it to be shown by history that all such plots have\nbeen contrived by men of great station, or by those who have been on\nterms of close intimacy with the prince, since no others, not being\ndownright madmen, would ever think of conspiring. For men of humble\nrank, and such as are not the intimates of their prince, are neither\nfed by the hopes nor possessed of the opportunities essential for such\nattempts. Because, in the first place, men of low degree will never\nfind any to keep faith with them, none being moved to join in their\nschemes by those expectations which encourage men to run great risks;\nwherefore, so soon as their design has been imparted to two or three,\nthey are betrayed and ruined. Or, assuming them fortunate enough to\nhave no traitor of their number, they will be so hampered in the\nexecution of their plot by the want of easy access to the prince, that\nthey are sure to perish in the mere attempt. For if even men of great\nposition, who have ready access to the prince, succumb to the\ndifficulties which I shall presently notice, those difficulties must be\ninfinitely increased in the case of men who are without these\nadvantages. And because when life and property are at stake men are not\nutterly reckless, on perceiving themselves to be weak they grow\ncautious, and though cursing the tyrant in their hearts, are content to\nendure him, and to wait until some one of higher station than they,\ncomes forward to redress their wrongs. So that should we ever find\nthese weaklings attempting anything, we may commend their courage\nrather than their prudence.\nWe see, however, that the great majority of conspirators have been\npersons of position and the familiars of their prince, and that their\nplots have been as often the consequence of excessive indulgence as of\nexcessive injury; as when Perennius conspired against Commodus,\nPlautianus against Severus, and Sejanus against Tiberius; all of whom\nhad been raised by their masters to such wealth, honours, and\ndignities, that nothing seemed wanting to their authority save the\nimperial name. That they might not lack this also, they fell to\nconspiring against their prince; but in every instance their\nconspiracies had the end which their ingratitude deserved.\nThe only instance in recent times of such attempts succeeding, is the\nconspiracy of Jacopo IV. d\u2019Appiano against Messer Piero Gambacorti,\nlord of Pisa. For Jacopo, who had been bred and brought up by Piero,\nand loaded by him with honours, deprived him of his State. Similar to\nthis, in our own days, was the conspiracy of Coppola against King\nFerdinand of Aragon. For Coppola had reached such a pitch of power that\nhe seemed to himself to have everything but sovereignty; in seeking to\nobtain which he lost his life; though if any plot entered into by a man\nof great position could be expected to succeed, this certainly might,\nbeing contrived, as we may say, by another king, and by one who had the\namplest opportunities for its accomplishment. But that lust of power\nwhich blinds men to dangers darkened the minds of those to whom the\nexecution of the scheme was committed; who, had they only known how to\nadd prudence to their villainy, could hardly have missed their aim.\nThe prince, therefore, who would guard himself against plots, ought\nmore to fear those men to whom he has been too indulgent, than those to\nwhom he has done great wrongs. For the latter lack opportunities which\nthe former have in abundance; and the moving cause is equally strong in\nboth, lust of power being at least as strong a passion as lust of\nrevenge. Wherefore, a prince should entrust his friends with so much\nauthority only as leaves a certain interval between his position and\ntheirs; that between the two something be still left them to desire.\nOtherwise it will be strange if he do not fare like those princes who\nhave been named above.\nBut to return from this digression, I say, that having shown it to be\nnecessary that conspirators should be men of great station, and such as\nhave ready access to the prince, we have next to consider what have\nbeen the results of their plots, and to trace the causes which have\nmade them succeed or fail. Now, as I have said already, we find that\nconspiracies are attended by danger at three stages: before during, and\nafter their execution; for which reason very few of them have had a\nhappy issue; it being next to impossible to surmount all these\ndifferent dangers successfully. And to begin with those which are\nincurred beforehand, and which are graver than all the rest, I say that\nhe must be both very prudent and very fortunate who, when contriving a\nconspiracy, does not suffer his secret to be discovered.\nConspiracies are discovered either by disclosures made, or by\nconjecture. Disclosures are made through the treachery or folly of\nthose to whom you communicate your design. Treachery is to be looked\nfor, because you can impart your plans only to such persons as you\nbelieve ready to face death on your behalf, or to those who are\ndiscontented with the prince. Of men whom you can trust thus\nimplicitly, one or two may be found; but when you have to open your\ndesigns to many, they cannot all be of this nature; and their goodwill\ntowards you must be extreme if they are not daunted by the danger and\nby fear of punishment. Moreover men commonly deceive themselves in\nrespect of the love which they imagine others bear them, nor can ever\nbe sure of it until they have put it to the proof. But to make proof of\nit in a matter like this is very perilous; and even if you have proved\nit already, and found it true in some other dangerous trial, you cannot\nassume that there will be the same fidelity here, since this far\ntranscends every other kind of danger. Again, if you gauge a man\u2019s\nfidelity by his discontent with the prince, you may easily deceive\nyourself; for so soon as you have taken this discontented man into your\nconfidence, you have supplied him with the means whereby he may become\ncontented; so that either his hatred of the prince must be great\nindeed, or your influence over him extraordinary, if it keep him\nfaithful. Hence it comes that so many conspiracies have been discovered\nand crushed in their earliest stage, and that when the secret is\npreserved among many accomplices for any length of time, it is looked\non as a miracle; as in the case of the conspiracy of Piso against Nero,\nand, in our own days, in that of the Pazzi against Lorenzo and Giuliano\nde\u2019 Medici; which last, though more than fifty persons were privy to\nit, was not discovered until it came to be carried out.\nConspiracies are disclosed through the imprudence of a conspirator when\nhe talks so indiscreetly that some servant, or other person not in the\nplot, overhears him; as happened with the sons of Brutus, who, when\ntreating with the envoys of Tarquin, were overheard by a slave, who\nbecame their accuser; or else through your own weakness in imparting\nyour secret to some woman or boy whom you love, or to some other such\nlight person; as when Dymnus, who was one of those who conspired with\nPhilotas against Alexander the Great, revealed the plot to Nicomachus,\na youth whom he loved, who at once told Cebalinus, and Cebalinus the\nking.\nOf discoveries by conjecture we have an instance in the conspiracy of\nPiso against Nero; for Scaevinus, one of the conspirators, the day\nbefore he was to kill Nero, made his will, liberated all his slaves and\ngave them money, and bade Milichus, his freedman, sharpen his old rusty\ndagger, and have bandages ready for binding up wounds. From all which\npreparations Milichus conjecturing what work was in hand, accused\nScaevinus before Nero; whereupon Scaevinus was arrested, and with him\nNatalis, another of the conspirators, who the day before had been seen\nto speak with him for a long time in private; and when the two differed\nin their account of what then passed between them, they were put to the\ntorture and forced to confess the truth. In this way the conspiracy was\nbrought to light, to the ruin of all concerned.\nAgainst these causes of the discovery of conspiracies it is impossible\nso to guard as that either through treachery, want of caution, or\nlevity, the secret shall not be found out, whenever more than three or\nfour persons are privy to it. And whenever more than one conspirator is\narrested, the plot is certain to be detected, because no two persons\ncan perfectly agree in a false account of what has passed between them.\nIf only one be taken, should he be a man of resolute courage, he may\nrefuse to implicate his comrades; but they on their part must have no\nless courage, to stay quiet where they are, and not betray themselves\nby flight; for if courage be absent anywhere, whether in him who is\ntaken or in those still at large, the conspiracy is revealed. And what\nis related by Titus Livius as having happened in the conspiracy against\nHieronymus, tyrant of Syracuse, is most extraordinary, namely, that on\nthe capture of one of the conspirators, named Theodorus, he, with great\nfortitude, withheld the names of all his accomplices, and accused\nfriends of the tyrant; while his companions, on their part, trusted so\ncompletely in his courage, that not one of them quitted Syracuse or\nshowed any sign of fear.\nAll these dangers, therefore, which attend the contrivance of a plot,\nmust be passed through before you come to its execution; or if you\nwould escape them, you must observe the following precautions: Your\nfirst and surest, nay, to say truth, your only safeguard, is to leave\nyour accomplices no time to accuse you; for which reason you must\nimpart the affair to them, only at the moment when you mean it to be\ncarried out, and not before. Those who have followed this course have\nwholly escaped the preliminary dangers of conspiracies, and, generally\nspeaking, the others also; indeed, I may say that they have all\nsucceeded, and that it is open to every prudent man to act as they did.\nIt will be enough to give two instances of plots effected in this way.\nNelematus, unable to endure the tyranny of Aristotimus, despot of\nEpirus, assembling many of his friends and kinsmen in his house,\nexhorted them to free their country; and when some of them asked for\ntime to consider and mature their plans, he bade his slaves close the\ndoors, and told those assembled that unless they swore to go at once\nand do as he directed he would make them over to Aristotimus as\nprisoners. Alarmed by his threats, they bound themselves by a solemn\noath, and going forth at once and without delay, successfully carried\nout his bidding. A certain Magus having fraudulently usurped the throne\nof Persia; Ortanes, a grandee of that realm, discovering the fraud,\ndisclosed it to six others of the chief nobility, telling them that it\nbehoved them to free the kingdom from the tyranny of this impostor. And\nwhen some among them asked for time, Darius, who was one of the six\nsummoned by Ortanes, stood up and said, \u201cEither we go at once to do\nthis deed, or I go to the Magus to accuse you all.\u201d Whereupon, all\nrising together, without time given to any to change his mind, they\nwent forth and succeeded in effecting their end. Not unlike these\ninstances was the plan taken by the Etolians to rid themselves of\nNabis, the Spartan tyrant, to whom, under pretence of succouring him,\nthey sent Alasamenes, their fellow-citizen, with two hundred foot\nsoldiers and thirty horsemen. For they imparted their real design to\nAlasamenes only, charging the rest, under pain of exile, to obey him in\nwhatever he commanded. Alasamenes repaired to Sparta, and never\ndivulged his commission till the time came for executing it; and so\nsucceeded in putting Nabis to death.\nIt was, therefore, by the precautions they observed, that the persons\nof whom I have just now spoken escaped all those perils that attend the\ncontrivance of conspiracies; and any following their example may expect\nthe like good fortune. And that all may learn to do as they did I shall\nnotice the case of Piso, of which mention has before been made. By\nreason of his rank, his reputation, and the intimate terms on which he\nlived with Nero, who trusted him without reserve, and would often come\nto his garden to sup with him, Piso was able to gain the friendship of\nmany persons of spirit and courage, and well fitted in every way to\ntake part in his plot against the emperor, which, under these\ncircumstances, might easily have been carried out. For when Nero came\nto his garden, Piso could readily have communicated his design to those\nfriends of his, and with suitable words have encouraged them to do\nwhat, in fact, they would not have had time to withdraw from, and was\ncertain to succeed. And were we to examine all similar attempts, it\nwould be seen that there are few which might not have been effected in\nthe manner shown. But since most men are very ignorant of practical\naffairs, they commit the gravest blunders, especially in matters which\nlie, as this does, a little way out of the beaten track.\nWherefore, the contriver of a plot ought never, if he can help it, to\ncommunicate his design until the moment when it is to be executed; or\nif he must communicate it, then to some one man only, with whom he has\nlong been intimate, and whom he knows to be moved by the same feelings\nas himself. To find one such person is far easier than to find several,\nand, at the same time, involves less risk; for though this one man play\nyou false, you are not left altogether without resource, as you are\nwhen your accomplices are numerous. For I have heard it shrewdly said\nthat to one man you may impart anything, since, unless you have been\nled to commit yourself by writing, your denial will go as far as his\nassertion. Shun writing, therefore, as you would a rock, for there is\nnothing so damning as a letter under your own hand.\nPlautianus, desiring to procure the deaths of the Emperor Severus and\nhis son Caracalla, intrusted the business to the tribune Saturninus,\nwho, being more disposed to betray than obey Plautianus, but at the\nsame time afraid that, if it came to laying a charge, Plautianus might\nbe believed sooner than he, asked him for a written authority, that his\ncommission might be credited. Blinded by ambition, Plautianus complied,\nand forthwith was accused by Saturninus and found guilty; whereas, but\nfor that written warrant, together with other corroborating proofs, he\nmust have escaped by his bold denial of the charge. Against the\ntestimony of a single witness, you have thus some defence, unless\nconvicted by your own handwriting, or by other circumstantial proof\nagainst which you must guard. A woman, named Epicharis, who had\nformerly been a mistress of Nero, was privy to Piso\u2019s conspiracy, and\nthinking it might be useful to have the help of a certain captain of\ntriremes whom Nero had among his body-guards, she acquainted him with\nthe plot, but not with the names of the plotters. This fellow, turning\ntraitor, and accusing Epicharis to Nero, so stoutly did she deny the\ncharge, that Nero, confounded by her effrontery, let her go.\nIn imparting a plot to a single person there are, therefore, two risks:\none, that he may come forward of his own accord to accuse you; the\nother, that if arrested on suspicion, or on some proof of his guilt, he\nmay, on being convicted, in the hope to escape punishment, betray you.\nBut in neither of these dangers are you left without a defence; since\nyou may meet the one by ascribing the charge to the malice of your\naccuser, and the other by alleging that the witness his been forced by\ntorture to say what is untrue. The wisest course, however, is to impart\nyour design to none, but to act like those who have been mentioned\nabove; or if you impart it, then to one only: for although even in this\ncourse there be a certain degree of danger, it is far less than when\nmany are admitted to your confidence.\nA case nearly resembling that just now noticed, is where an emergency,\nso urgent as to leave you no time to provide otherwise for your safety,\nconstrains you to do to a prince what you see him minded to do to you.\nA necessity of this sort leads almost always to the end desired, as two\ninstances may suffice to show. Among the closest friends and intimates\nof the Emperor Commodus, were two captains of the pretorian guards,\nLetus and Electus, while among the most favoured of his distresses was\na certain Martia. But because these three often reproved him for his\nmanner of living, as disgraceful to himself and to his station, he\nresolved to rid himself of them; and so wrote their names, along with\nthose of certain others whom he meant should be put to death the next\nnight, in a list which he placed under the pillow of his bed. But on\nhis going to bathe, a boy, who was a favourite of his, while playing\nabout his room and on his bed, found the list, and coming out of the\nchamber with it in his hand, was met by Martia, who took it from him,\nand on reading it and finding what it contained, sent for Letus and\nElectus. And all three recognizing the danger in which they stood,\nresolved to be beforehand with the tyrant, and losing no time, murdered\nhim that very night.\nThe Emperor Caracalla, being with his armies in Mesopotamia, had with\nhim Macrinus, who was more of a statesman than a soldier, as his\nprefect. But because princes who are not themselves good are always\nafraid lest others treat them as they deserve, Caracalla wrote to his\nfriend Maternianus in Rome to learn from the astrologers whether any\nman had ambitious designs upon the empire, and to send him word.\nMaternianus, accordingly, wrote back that such designs were entertained\nby Macrinus. But this letter, ere it reached the emperor, fell into the\nhands of Macrinus, who, seeing when he read it that he must either put\nCaracalla to death before further letters arrived from Rome, or else\ndie himself, committed the business to a centurion, named Martialis,\nwhom he trusted, and whose brother had been slain by Caracalla a few\ndays before, who succeeded in killing the emperor.\nWe see, therefore, that an urgency which leaves no room for delay has\nalmost the same results as the method already noticed as followed by\nNelematus of Epirus. We see, too, what I remarked almost at the outset\nof this Discourse, that the threats of princes expose them to greater\ndanger than the wrongs they actually inflict, and lead to more active\nconspiracies: and, therefore, that a prince should be careful not to\nthreaten; since men are either to be treated kindly or else got rid of,\nbut never brought to such a pass that they have to choose between\nslaying and being slain.\nAs to the dangers attending the execution of plots, these result either\nfrom some change made in the plan, or from a failure in courage on the\npart of him who is to carry it out; or else from some mistake he falls\ninto through want of foresight, or from his not giving the affair its\nfinishing stroke, as when some are left alive whom it was meant to put\nto death. Now, nothing causes so much disturbance and hindrance in\nhuman affairs, as to be forced, at a moment\u2019s notice and without time\nallowed for reflection, to vary your plan of action and adopt a\ndifferent one from that fixed on at the first. And if such changes\ncause confusion anywhere, it is in matters appertaining to war, and in\nenterprises of the kind we are now speaking of; for in such affairs as\nthese, there is nothing so essential as that men be prepared to do the\nexact thing intrusted to them. But when men have for many days together\nturned their whole thoughts to doing a thing in a certain way and in a\ncertain order, and the way and order are suddenly altered, it is\nimpossible but that they should be disconcerted and the whole scheme\nruined. For which reason, it is far better to do everything in\naccordance with the preconcerted plan, though it be seen to be attended\nwith some disadvantages, than, in order to escape these, to involve\nyourself in an infinity of dangers. And this will happen when you\ndepart from your original design without time given to form a new one.\nFor when time is given you may manage as you please.\nThe conspiracy of the Pazzi against Lorenzo and Giuliano de\u2019 Medici is\nwell known. The scheme agreed on was to give a banquet to the Cardinal\nS. Giorgio, at which the brothers should be put to death. To each of\nthe conspirators a part was assigned: to one the murder, to another the\nseizure of the palace, while a third was to ride through the streets\nand call on the people to free themselves. But it so chanced that at a\ntime when the Pazzi, the Medici, and the Cardinal were all assembled in\nthe cathedral church of Florence to hear High Mass, it became known\nthat Giuliano would not be present at the banquet; whereupon the\nconspirators, laying their heads together, resolved to do in church\nwhat they were to have done elsewhere. This, however, deranged the\nwhole scheme. For Giovambattista of Montesecco, would have no hand in\nthe murder if it was to be done in a church; and the whole distribution\nof parts had in consequence to be changed; when, as those to whom the\nnew parts were assigned had no time allowed them to nerve their minds\nto their new tasks, they managed matters so badly that they were\noverpowered in their attempt.\nCourage fails a conspirator either from his own poorness of spirit, or\nfrom his being overcome by some feeling of reverence. For such majesty\nand awe attend the person of a prince, that it may well happen that he\nsoftens or dismays his executioners. When Caius Marius was taken by the\npeople of Minturnum, the slave sent in to slay him, overawed by the\nbearing of the man, and by the memories which his name called up,\nbecame unnerved, and powerless to perform his office. And if this\ninfluence was exercised by one who was a prisoner, and in chains, and\noverwhelmed by adverse fortune, how much more must reverence be\ninspired by a prince who is free and uncontrolled, surrounded by his\nretinue and by all the pomp and splendour of his station; whose dignity\nconfounds, and whose graciousness conciliates.\nCertain persons conspiring against Sitalces, king of Thrace, fixed a\nday for his murder, and assembled at the place appointed, whither the\nking had already come. Yet none of them raised a hand to harm him, and\nall departed without attempting anything against him or knowing why\nthey refrained; each blaming the others. And more than once the same\nfolly was repeated, until the plot getting wind, they were taken and\npunished for what they might have done, yet durst not do.\nTwo brothers of Alfonso, Duke of Ferrara, conspired against him,\nemploying as their tool a certain priest named Giennes, a singing-man\nin the service of the Duke. He, at their request, repeatedly brought\nthe Duke into their company, so that they had full opportunity to make\naway with him. Yet neither of them ever ventured to strike the blow;\ntill at last, their scheme being discovered, they paid the penalty of\ntheir combined cowardice and temerity. Such irresolution can only have\narisen from their being overawed by the majesty of the prince, or\ntouched by his graciousness.\nIn the execution of conspiracies, therefore, errors and mishaps arise\nfrom a failure of prudence or courage to which all are subject, when,\nlosing self-control, they are led in their bewilderment to do and say\nwhat they ought not. That men are thus confounded, and thrown off their\nbalance, could not be better shown than in the words of Titus Livius,\nwhere he describes the behaviour of Alasamenes the Etolian, at the time\nwhen he resolved on the death of Nabis the Spartan, of whom I have\nspoken before. For when the time to act came, and he had disclosed to\nhis followers what they had to do, Livius represents him as\n\u201c_collecting his thoughts which had grown confused by dwelling on so\ndesperate an enterprise_.\u201d For it is impossible for any one, though of\nthe most steadfast temper and used to the sight of death and to handle\ndeadly weapons, not to be perturbed at such a moment. For which reason\nwe should on such occasions choose for our tools those who have had\nexperience in similar affairs, and trust no others though reputed of\nthe truest courage. For in these grave undertakings, no one who is\nwithout such experience, however bold and resolute, is to be trusted.\nThe confusion of which I speak may either cause you to drop your weapon\nfrom your hand, or to use words which will have the same results.\nQuintianus being commanded by Lucilla, sister of Commodus, to slay him,\nlay in wait for him at the entrance of the amphitheatre, and rushing\nupon him with a drawn dagger, cried out, \u201c_The senate sends you this_;\u201d\nwhich words caused him to be seized before his blow descended. In like\nmanner Messer Antonio of Volterra, who as we have elsewhere seen was\ntold off to kill Lorenzo de\u2019 Medici, exclaimed as he approached him,\n\u201c_Ah traitor!_\u201d and this exclamation proved the salvation of Lorenzo\nand the ruin of that conspiracy.\nFor the reasons now given, a conspiracy against a single ruler may\nreadily break down in its execution; but a conspiracy against two\nrulers is not only difficult, but so hazardous that its success is\nalmost hopeless. For to effect like actions, at the same time, in\ndifferent places, is well-nigh impossible; nor can they be effected at\ndifferent times, if you would not have one counteract another. So that\nif conspiracy against a single ruler be imprudent and dangerous, to\nconspire against two, is in the last degree fool-hardy and desperate.\nAnd were it not for the respect in which I hold the historian, I could\nnot credit as possible what Herodian relates of Plautianus, namely,\nthat he committed to the centurion Saturninus the task of slaying\nsingle-handed both Severus and Caracalla, they dwelling in different\nplaces; for the thing is so opposed to reason that on no other\nauthority could I be induced to accept it as true.\nCertain young Athenians conspired against Diocles and Hippias, tyrants\nof Athens. Diocles they slew; but Hippias, making his escape, avenged\nhim. Chion and Leonidas of Heraclea, disciples of Plato, conspired\nagainst the despots Clearchus and Satirus. Clearchus fell, but Satirus\nsurvived and avenged him. The Pazzi, of whom we have spoken so often,\nsucceeded in murdering Giuliano only. From such conspiracies,\ntherefore, as are directed against more heads than one, all should\nabstain; for no good is to be got from them, whether for ourselves, for\nour country, or for any one else. On the contrary, when those conspired\nagainst escape, they become harsher and more unsufferable than before,\nas, in the examples given, Florence, Athens, and Heraclea had cause to\nknow. True it is that the conspiracy contrived by Pelopidas for the\nliberation of his country, had to encounter every conceivable\nhindrance, and yet had the happiest end. For Pelopidas had to deal, not\nwith two tyrants only, but with ten; and so far from having their\nconfidence, could not, being an outlaw, even approach them. And yet he\nsucceeded in coming to Thebes, in putting the tyrants to death, and in\nfreeing his country. But whatever he did was done with the aid of one\nof the counsellors of the tyrants, a certain Charon, through whom he\nhad all facilities for executing his design. Let none, however, take\nthis case as a pattern; for that it was in truth a desperate attempt,\nand its success a marvel, was and is the opinion of all historians, who\nspeak of it as a thing altogether extraordinary and unexampled.\nThe execution of a plot may be frustrated by some groundless alarm or\nunforeseen mischance occurring at the very moment when the scheme is to\nbe carried out. On the morning on which Brutus and his confederates\nwere to slay C\u00e6sar, it so happened that C\u00e6sar talked for a great while\nwith Cneus Pompilius Lenas, one of the conspirators; which some of the\nothers observing, were in terror that Pompilius was divulging the\nconspiracy to C\u00e6sar; whose life they would therefore have attempted\nthen and there, without waiting his arrival in the senate house, had\nthey not been reassured by seeing that when the conference ended he\nshowed no sign of unusual emotion. False alarms of this sort are to be\ntaken into account and allowed for, all the more that they are easily\nraised. For he who has not a clear conscience is apt to assume that\nothers are speaking of him. A word used with a wholly different\npurpose, may throw his mind off its balance and lead him to fancy that\nreference is intended to the matter he is engaged on, and cause him\neither to betray the conspiracy by flight, or to derange its execution\nby anticipating the time fixed. And the more there are privy to the\nconspiracy, the likelier is this to happen.\nAs to the mischances which may befall, since these are unforeseen, they\ncan only be instanced by examples which may make men more cautious.\nGiulio Belanti of Siena, of whom I have spoken before, from the hate he\nbore Pandolfo Petrucci, who had given him his daughter to wife and\nafterwards taken her from him, resolved to murder him, and thus chose\nhis time. Almost every day Pandolfo went to visit a sick kinsman,\npassing the house of Giulio on the way, who, remarking this, took\nmeasures to have his accomplices ready in his house to kill Pandolfo as\nhe passed. Wherefore, placing the rest armed within the doorway, one he\nstationed at a window to give the signal of Pandolfo\u2019s approach. It so\nhappened however, that as he came nigh the house, and after the\nlook-out had given the signal, Pandolfo fell in with a friend who\nstopped him to converse; when some of those with him, going on in\nadvance, saw and heard the gleam and clash of weapons, and so\ndiscovered the ambuscade; whereby Pandolfo was saved, while Giulio with\nhis companions had to fly from Siena. This plot accordingly was marred,\nand Giulio\u2019s schemes baulked, in consequence of a chance meeting.\nAgainst such accidents, since they are out of the common course of\nthings, no provision can be made. Still it is very necessary to take\ninto account all that may happen, and devise what remedies you can.\nIt now only remains for us to consider those dangers which follow after\nthe execution of a plot. These in fact resolve themselves into one,\nnamely, that some should survive who will avenge the death of the\nmurdered prince. The part of avenger is likely to be assumed by a son,\na brother, or other kinsman of the deceased, who in the ordinary course\nof events might have looked to succeed to the princedom. And such\npersons are suffered to live, either from inadvertence, or from some of\nthe causes noted already, as when Giovann\u2019 Andrea of Lampognano, with\nthe help of his companions, put to death the Duke of Milan. For the son\nand two brothers of the Duke, who survived him, were able to avenge his\ndeath. In cases like this, indeed, the conspirators may be held\nexcused, since there is nothing they can do to help themselves. But\nwhen from carelessness and want of due caution some one is allowed to\nlive whose death ought to have been secured, there is no excuse.\nCertain conspirators, after murdering the lord, Count Girolamo of\nForli, made prisoners of his wife and of his children who were still\nvery young. By thinking they could not be safe unless they got\npossession of the citadel, which the governor refused to surrender,\nthey obtained a promise from Madonna Caterina, for so the Countess was\nnamed, that on their permitting her to enter the citadel she would\ncause it to be given up to them, her children in the mean time\nremaining with them as hostages. On which undertaking they suffered her\nto enter the citadel. But no sooner had she got inside than she fell to\nupbraid them from the walls with the murder of her husband, and to\nthreaten them with every kind of vengeance; and to show them how little\nstore she set upon her children, told them scoffingly that she knew how\nothers could be got. In the end, the rebels having no leader to advise\nthem, and perceiving too late the error into which they had been\nbetrayed, had to pay the penalty of their rashness by perpetual\nbanishment.\nBut of all the dangers which may follow on the execution of a plot,\nnone is so much or so justly to be feared as that the people should be\nwell affected to the prince whom you have put to death. For against\nthis danger conspirators have no resource which can ensure their\nsafety. Of this we have example in the case of C\u00e6sar, who as he had the\nlove of the Roman people was by them avenged; for they it was who, by\ndriving out the conspirators from Rome, were the cause that all of\nthem, at different times and in different places, came to violent ends.\nConspiracies against their country are less danger for those who take\npart in them than conspiracies against princes; since there is less\nrisk beforehand, and though there be the same danger in their\nexecution, there is none afterwards. Beforehand, the risks are few,\nbecause a citizen may use means for obtaining power without betraying\nhis wishes or designs to any; and unless his course be arrested, his\ndesigns are likely enough to succeed; nay, though laws be passed to\nrestrain him, he may strike out a new path. This is to be understood of\na commonwealth which has to some degree become corrupted; for in one\nwherein there is no taint of corruption, there being no soil in which\nevil seed can grow, such designs will never suggest themselves to any\ncitizen.\nIn a commonwealth, therefore, a citizen may by many means and in many\nways aspire to the princedom without risking destruction, both because\nrepublics are slower than princes are to take alarm, are less\nsuspicious and consequently less cautious, and because they look with\ngreater reverence upon their great citizens, who are in this way\nrendered bolder and more reckless in attacking them. Any one who has\nread Sallust\u2019s account of the conspiracy of Catiline, must remember\nhow, when that conspiracy was discovered, Catiline not only remained in\nRome, but even made his appearance in the senatehouse, where he was\nsuffered to address the senate in the most insulting terms,\u2014so\nscrupulous was that city in protecting the liberty of all its citizens.\nNay, even after he had left Rome and placed himself at the head of his\narmy, Lentulus and his other accomplices would not have been\nimprisoned, had not letters been found upon them clearly establishing\ntheir guilt. Hanno, the foremost citizen of Carthage, aspiring to\nabsolute power, on the occasion of the marriage of a daughter contrived\na plot for administering poison to the whole senate and so making\nhimself prince. The scheme being discovered, the senate took no steps\nagainst him beyond passing a law to limit the expense of banquets and\nmarriage ceremonies. So great was the respect they paid to his quality.\nTrue, the _execution_ of a plot against your country is attended with\ngreater difficulty and danger, since it seldom happens that, in\nconspiring against so many, your own resources are sufficient by\nthemselves; for it is not every one who, like C\u00e6sar, Agathocles, or\nCleomenes, is at the head of an army, so as to be able at a stroke, and\nby open force to make himself master of his country. To such as these,\ndoubtless, the path is safe and easy enough; but others who have not\nsuch an assembled force ready at their command, must effect their ends\neither by stratagem and fraud, or with the help of foreign troops. Of\nsuch stratagems and frauds we have an instance in the case of\nPisistratus the Athenian, who after defeating the Megarians and thereby\ngaining the favour of his fellow-citizens, showed himself to them one\nmorning covered with wounds and blood, declaring that he had been thus\noutraged through the jealousy of the nobles, and asking that he might\nhave an armed guard assigned for his protection. With the authority\nwhich this lent him, he easily rose to such a pitch of power as to\nbecome tyrant of Athens. In like manner Pandolfo Petrucci, on his\nreturn with the other exiles to Siena, was appointed the command of the\npublic guard, as a mere office of routine which others had declined.\nVery soon, however, this armed force gave him so much importance that\nhe became the supreme ruler of the State. And many others have followed\nother plans and methods, and in the course of time, and without\nincurring danger, have achieved their aim.\nConspirators against their country, whether trusting to their own\nforces or to foreign aid, have had more or less success in proportion\nas they have been favoured by Fortune. Catiline, of whom we spoke just\nnow, was overthrown. Hanno, who has also been mentioned, failing to\naccomplish his object by poison, armed his partisans to the number of\nmany thousands; but both he and they came to an ill end. On the other\nhand, certain citizens of Thebes conspiring to become its tyrants,\nsummoned a Spartan army to their assistance, and usurped the absolute\ncontrol of the city. In short, if we examine all the conspiracies which\nmen have engaged in against their country, we shall find that few or\nnone have been quelled in their inception, but that all have either\nsucceeded, or have broken down in their execution. Once executed, they\nentail no further risks beyond those implied in the nature of a\nprincedom. For the man who becomes a tyrant incurs all the natural and\nordinary dangers in which a tyranny involves him, and has no remedies\nagainst them save those of which I have already spoken.\nThis is all that occurs to me to say on the subject of conspiracies. If\nI have noticed those which have been carried out with the sword rather\nthan those wherein poison has been the instrument, it is because,\ngenerally speaking, the method of proceeding is the same in both. It is\ntrue, nevertheless, that conspiracies which are to be carried out by\npoison are, by reason of their uncertainty, attended by greater danger.\nFor since fewer opportunities offer for their execution, you must have\nan understanding with persons who can command opportunities. But it is\ndangerous to have to depend on others. Again, many causes may hinder a\npoisoned draught from proving mortal; as when the murderers of\nCommodus, on his vomiting the poison given him, had to strangle him.\nPrinces, then, have no worse enemy than conspiracy, for when a\nconspiracy is formed against them, it either carries them off, or\ndiscredits them: since, if it succeeds, they die; while, if it be\ndiscovered, and the conspirators be put to death themselves, it will\nalways be believed that the whole affair has been trumped up by the\nprince that he might glut his greed and cruelty with the goods and\nblood of those whom he has made away with. Let me not, however, forget\nto warn the prince or commonwealth against whom a conspiracy is\ndirected, that on getting word of it, and before taking any steps to\npunish it, they endeavour, as far as they can, to ascertain its\ncharacter, and after carefully weighing the strength of the\nconspirators with their own, on finding it preponderate, never suffer\ntheir knowledge of the plot to appear until they are ready with a force\nsufficient to crush it. For otherwise, to disclose their knowledge will\nonly give the signal for their destruction. They must strive therefore\nto seem unconscious of what is going on; for conspirators who see\nthemselves detected are driven forward by necessity and will stick at\nnothing. Of this precaution we have an example in Roman history, when\nthe officers of the two legions, who, as has already been mentioned,\nwere left behind to defend the Capuans from the Samnites, conspired\ntogether against the Capuans. For on rumours of this conspiracy\nreaching Rome, Rutilius the new consul was charged to see to it; who,\nnot to excite the suspicions of the conspirators, publicly gave out\nthat by order of the senate the Capuan legions were continued in their\nstation. The conspirators believing this, and thinking they would have\nample time to execute their plans, made no effort to hasten matters,\nbut remained at their ease, until they found that the consul was moving\none of the two legions to a distance from the other. This arousing\ntheir suspicion, led them to disclose their designs and endeavour to\ncarry them out.\nNow, we could have no more instructive example than this in whatever\nway we look at it. For it shows how slow men are to move in those\nmatters wherein time seems of little importance, and how active they\nbecome when necessity urges them. Nor can a prince or commonwealth\ndesiring for their own ends to retard the execution of a conspiracy,\nuse any more effectual means to do so, than by artfully holding out to\nthe conspirators some special opportunity as likely soon to present\nitself; awaiting which, and believing they have time and to spare for\nwhat they have to do, they will afford that prince or commonwealth all\nthe leisure needed to prepare for their punishment. Whosoever neglects\nthese precautions hastens his own destruction, as happened with the\nDuke of Athens, and with Guglielmo de\u2019 Pazzi. For the Duke, who had\nmade himself tyrant of Florence, on learning that he was being\nconspired against, without further inquiry into the matter, caused one\nof the conspirators to be seized; whereupon the rest at once armed\nthemselves and deprived him of his government. Guglielmo, again, being\ncommissary in the Val di Chiana in the year 1501, and learning that a\nconspiracy was being hatched in Arezzo to take the town from the\nFlorentines and give it over to the Vitelli, repaired thither with all\nhaste; and without providing himself with the necessary forces or\ngiving a thought to the strength of the conspirators, on the advice of\nthe bishop, his son, had one of them arrested. Which becoming known to\nthe others, they forthwith rushed to arms, and taking the town from the\nFlorentines, made Guglielmo their prisoner. Where, however,\nconspiracies are weak, they may and should be put down without scruple\nor hesitation.\nTwo methods, somewhat opposed to one another, which have occasionally\nbeen followed in dealing with conspiracies, are in no way to be\ncommended. One of these was that adopted by the Duke of Athens, of whom\nI have just now spoken, who to have it thought that he confided in the\ngoodwill of the Florentines, caused a certain man who gave information\nof a plot against him, to be put to death. The other was that followed\nby Dion the Syracusan, who, to sound the intentions of one whom he\nsuspected, arranged with Calippus, whom he trusted, to pretend to get\nup a conspiracy against him. Neither of these tyrants reaped any\nadvantage from the course he followed. For the one discouraged\ninformers and gave heart to those who were disposed to conspire, the\nother prepared an easy road to his own death, or rather was prime mover\nin a conspiracy against himself. As the event showed. For Calippus\nhaving free leave to plot against Dion, plotted to such effect, that he\ndeprived him at once of his State and life.\nCHAPTER VII.\u2014_Why it is that changes from Freedom to Servitude, and\nfrom Servitude to Freedom, are sometimes made without Bloodshed, but at\nother times reek with Blood_.\nSince we find from history that in the countless changes which have\nbeen made from freedom to servitude and from servitude to freedom,\nsometimes an infinite multitude have perished, while at others not a\nsoul has suffered (as when Rome made her change from kings to consuls,\non which occasion none was banished save Tarquin, and no harm was done\nto any other), it may perhaps be asked, how it happens that of these\nrevolutions, some have been attended by bloodshed and others not.\nThe answer I take to be this. The government which suffers change\neither has or has not had its beginning in violence. And since the\ngovernment which has its beginning in violence must start by inflicting\ninjuries on many, it must needs happen that on its downfall those who\nwere injured will desire to avenge themselves; from which desire for\nvengeance the slaughter and death of many will result. But when a\ngovernment originates with, and derives its authority from the whole\ncommunity, there is no reason why the community, if it withdraw that\nauthority, should seek to injure any except the prince from whom it\nwithdraws it. Now the government of Rome was of this nature, and the\nexpulsion of the Tarquins took place in this way. Of a like character\nwas the government of the Medici in Florence, and, accordingly, upon\ntheir overthrow in the year 1494, no injury was done to any save\nthemselves.\nIn such cases, therefore, the changes I speak of do not occasion any\nvery great danger. But the changes wrought by men who have wrongs to\nrevenge, are always of a most dangerous kind, and such, to say the\nleast, as may well cause dismay in the minds of those who read of them.\nBut since history abounds with instances of such changes I need say no\nmore about them.\nCHAPTER VIII.\u2014_That he who would effect Changes in a Commonwealth, must\ngive heed to its Character and Condition_\nI have said before that a bad citizen cannot work grave mischief in a\ncommonwealth which has not become corrupted. This opinion is not only\nsupported by the arguments already advanced, but is further confirmed\nby the examples of Spurius Cassius and Manlius Capitolinus. For\nSpurius, being ambitious, and desiring to obtain extraordinary\nauthority in Rome, and to win over the people by loading them with\nbenefits (as, for instance, by selling them those lands which the\nRomans had taken from the Hernici,) his designs were seen through by\nthe senate, and laid him under such suspicion, that when in haranguing\nthe people he offered them the money realized by the sale of the grain\nbrought from Sicily at the public expense, they would have none of it,\nbelieving that he offered it as the price of their freedom. Now, had\nthe people been corrupted, they would not have refused this bribe, but\nwould have opened rather than closed the way to the tyranny.\nThe example of Manlius is still more striking. For in his case we see\nwhat excellent gifts both of mind and body, and what splendid services\nto his country were afterwards cancelled by that shameful eagerness to\nreign which we find bred in him by his jealousy of the honours paid\nCamillus. For so darkened did his mind become, that without reflecting\nwhat were the institutions to which Rome was accustomed, or testing the\nmaterial he had to work on, when he would have seen that it was still\nunfit to be moulded to evil ends, he set himself to stir up tumults\nagainst the senate and against the laws of his country.\nAnd herein we recognize the excellence of this city of Rome, and of the\nmaterials whereof it was composed. For although the nobles were wont to\nstand up stoutly for one another, not one of them stirred to succour\nManlius, and not one of his kinsfolk made any effort on his behalf, so\nthat although it was customary, in the case of other accused persons,\nfor their friends to put on black and sordid raiment, with all the\nother outward signs of grief, in order to excite pity for the accused,\nnone was seen to do any of these things for Manlius. Even the tribunes\nof the people, though constantly ready to promote whatever courses\nseemed to favour the popular cause, and the more vehemently the more\nthey seemed to make against the nobles, in this instance sided with the\nnobles to put down the common enemy. Nay the very people themselves,\nkeenly alive to their own interests, and well disposed towards any\nattempt to damage the nobles, though they showed Manlius many proofs of\ntheir regard, nevertheless, when he was cited by the tribunes to appear\nbefore them and submit his cause for their decision, assumed the part\nof judges and not of defenders, and without scruple or hesitation\nsentenced him to die. Wherefore, I think, that there is no example in\nthe whole Roman history which serves so well as this to demonstrate the\nvirtues of all ranks in that republic. For not a man in the whole city\nbestirred himself to shield a citizen endowed with every great quality,\nand who, both publicly and privately, had done so much that deserved\npraise. But in all, the love of country outweighed every other thought,\nand all looked less to his past deserts than to the dangers which his\npresent conduct threatened; from which to relieve themselves they put\nhim to death. \u201c_Such_,\u201d says Livius, \u201c_was the fate of a man worthy our\nadmiration had he not been born in a free State_.\u201d\nAnd here two points should be noted. The first, that glory is to be\nsought by different methods in a corrupt city, and in one which still\npreserves its freedom. The second, which hardly differs from the first,\nthat in their actions, and especially in matters of moment, men must\nhave regard to times and circumstances and adapt themselves thereto.\nFor those persons who from an unwise choice, or from natural\ninclination, run counter to the times will for the most part live\nunhappily, and find all they undertake issue in failure; whereas those\nwho accommodate themselves to the times are fortunate and successful.\nAnd from the passage cited we may plainly infer, that had Manlius lived\nin the days of Marius and Sylla, when the body of the State had become\ncorrupted, so that he could have impressed it with the stamp of his\nambition, he might have had the same success as they had, and as those\nothers had who after them aspired to absolute power; and, conversely,\nthat if Sylla and Marius had lived in the days of Manlius, they must\nhave broken down at the very beginning of their attempts.\nFor one man, by mischievous arts and measures, may easily prepare the\nground for the universal corruption of a city; but no one man in his\nlifetime can carry that corruption so far, as himself to reap the\nharvest; or granting that one man\u2019s life might be long enough for this\npurpose, it would be impossible for him, having regard to the ordinary\nhabits of men, who grow impatient and cannot long forego the\ngratification of their desires, to wait until the corruption was\ncomplete. Moreover, men deceive themselves in respect of their own\naffairs, and most of all in respect of those on which they are most\nbent; so that either from impatience or from self-deception, they rush\nupon undertakings for which the time is not ripe, and so come to an ill\nend. Wherefore to obtain absolute authority in a commonwealth and to\ndestroy its liberties, you must find the body of the State already\ncorrupted, and corrupted by a gradual wasting continued from generation\nto generation; which, indeed, takes place necessarily, unless, as has\nbeen already explained, the State be often reinforced by good examples,\nor brought back to its first beginnings by wise laws.\nManlius, therefore, would have been a rare and renowned man had he been\nborn in a corrupt city; and from his example we see that citizens\nseeking to introduce changes in the form of their government, whether\nin favour of liberty or despotism, ought to consider what materials\nthey have to deal with, and then judge of the difficulty of their task.\nFor it is no less arduous and dangerous to attempt to free a people\ndisposed to live in servitude, than to enslave a people who desire to\nlive free.\nAnd because it has been said above, that in their actions men must take\ninto account the character of the times in which they live, and guide\nthemselves accordingly, I shall treat this point more fully in the\nfollowing Chapter.\nCHAPTER IX.\u2014_That to enjoy constant good Fortune we must change with\nthe Times._\nI have repeatedly noted that the good or bad fortune of men depends on\nwhether their methods of acting accord with the character of the times.\nFor we see that in what they do some men act impulsively, others warily\nand with caution. And because, from inability to preserve the just\nmean, they in both of these ways overstep the true limit, they commit\nmistakes in one direction or the other. He, however, will make fewest\nmistakes, and may expect to prosper most, who, while following the\ncourse to which nature inclines him, finds, as I have said, his method\nof acting in accordance with the times in which he lives.\nAll know that in his command of the Roman armies, Fabius Maximus\ndisplayed a prudence and caution very different from the audacity and\nhardihood natural to his countrymen; and it was his good fortune that\nhis methods suited with the times. For Hannibal coming into Italy in\nall the flush of youth and recent success, having already by two\ndefeats stripped Rome of her best soldiers and filled her with dismay,\nnothing could have been more fortunate for that republic than to find a\ngeneral able, by his deliberateness and caution, to keep the enemy at\nbay. Nor, on the other hand, could Fabius have fallen upon times better\nsuited to the methods which he used, and by which he crowned himself\nwith glory. That he acted in accordance with his natural bent, and not\nfrom a reasoned choice, we may gather from this, that when Scipio, to\nbring the war to an end, proposed to pass with his army into Africa,\nFabius, unable to depart from his characteristic methods and habits,\nstrenuously opposed him; so that had it rested with him, Hannibal might\nnever have left Italy. For he perceived not that the times had changed,\nand that with them it was necessary to change the methods of\nprosecuting the war. Had Fabius, therefore, been King of Rome, he might\nwell have caused the war to end unhappily, not knowing how to\naccommodate his methods to the change in the times. As it was, he lived\nin a commonwealth in which there were many citizens, and many different\ndispositions; and which as it produced a Fabius, excellent at a time\nwhen it was necessary to protract hostilities, so also, afterwards gave\nbirth to a Scipio, at a time suited to bring them to a successful\nclose.\nAnd hence it comes that a commonwealth endures longer, and has a more\nsustained good fortune than a princedom, because from the diversity in\nthe characters of its citizens, it can adapt itself better than a\nprince can to the diversity of times. For, as I have said before, a man\naccustomed to follow one method, will never alter it; whence it must\nneeds happen that when times change so as no longer to accord with his\nmethod, he will be ruined. Piero Soderini, of whom I have already\nspoken, was guided in all his actions by patience and gentleness, and\nhe and his country prospered while the times were in harmony with these\nmethods. But, afterwards, when a time came when it behoved him to have\ndone with patience and gentleness, he knew not how to drop them, and\nwas ruined together with his country. Pope Julius II., throughout the\nwhole of his pontificate, was governed by impulse and passion, and\nbecause the times were in perfect accord, all his undertakings\nprospered. But had other times come requiring other qualities, he could\nnot have escaped destruction, since he could not have changed his\nmethods nor his habitual line of conduct.\nAs to why such changes are impossible, two reasons may be given. One is\nthat we cannot act in opposition to the bent of our nature. The other,\nthat when a man has been very successful while following a particular\nmethod, he can never be convinced that it is for his advantage to try\nsome other. And hence it results that a man\u2019s fortunes vary, because\ntimes change and he does not change with them. So, too, with\ncommonwealths, which, as we have already shown at length, are ruined\nfrom not altering their institutions to suit the times. And\ncommonwealths are slower to change than princes are, changes costing\nthem more effort; because occasions must be waited for which shall stir\nthe whole community, and it is not enough that a single citizen alters\nhis method of acting.\nBut since I have made mention of Fabius Maximus who wore out Hannibal\nby keeping him at bay, I think it opportune to consider in the\nfollowing Chapter whether a general who desires to engage his enemy at\nall risks, can be prevented by that enemy from doing so.\nCHAPTER X.\u2014_That a Captain cannot escape Battle when his Enemy forces\nit on him at all risks._\n\u201c_Cneius Sulpitius when appointed dictator against the Gauls, being\nunwilling to tempt Fortune by attacking an enemy whom delay and a\ndisadvantageous position would every day render weaker, protracted the\nwar._\u201d\nWhen a mistake is made of a sort that all or most men are likely to\nfall into, I think it not amiss to mark it again and again with\ndisapproval. Wherefore, although I have already shown repeatedly how in\naffairs of moment the actions of the moderns conform not to those of\nantiquity, still it seems to me not superfluous, in this place, to say\nthe same thing once more. For if in any particular the moderns have\ndeviated from the methods of the ancients, it is especially in their\nmethods of warfare, wherein not one of those rules formerly so much\nesteemed is now attended to. And this because both princes and\ncommonwealths have devolved the charge of such matters upon others,\nand, to escape danger, have kept aloof from all military service; so\nthat although one or another of the princes of our times may\noccasionally be seen present in person with his army, we are not\ntherefore to expect from him any further praiseworthy behaviour. For\neven where such personages take part in any warlike enterprise, they do\nso out of ostentation and from no nobler motive; though doubtless from\nsometimes seeing their soldiers face to face, and from retaining to\nthemselves the title of command, they are likely to make fewer blunders\nthan we find made by republics, and most of all by the republics of\nItaly, which though altogether dependent upon others, and themselves\nutterly ignorant of everything relating to warfare, do yet, that they\nmay figure as the commanders of their armies, take upon them to direct\ntheir movements, and in doing so commit countless mistakes; some of\nwhich have been considered elsewhere but one is of such importance as\nto deserve notice here.\nWhen these sluggard princes or effeminate republics send forth any of\ntheir Captains, it seems to them that the wisest instruction they can\ngive him is to charge him on no account to give battle, but, on the\ncontrary, to do what he can to avoid fighting. Wherein they imagine\nthemselves to imitate the prudence of Fabius Maximus, who by\nprotracting the war with Hannibal, saved the Roman commonwealth; not\nperceiving that in most instances such advice to a captain is either\nuseless or hurtful. For the truth of the matter is, that a captain who\nwould keep the field, cannot decline battle when his adversary forces\nit on him at all hazards. So that the instruction to avoid battle is\nbut tantamount to saying, \u201cYou shall engage when it pleases your enemy,\nand not when it suits yourself.\u201d For if you would keep the field and\nyet avoid battle, the only safe course is to interpose a distance of at\nleast fifty miles between you and your enemy, and afterwards to\nmaintain so vigilant a look-out, that should he advance you will have\ntime to make your retreat. Another method is to shut yourself up in\nsome town. But both of these methods are extremely disadvantageous. For\nby following the former, you leave your country a prey to the enemy,\nand a valiant prince would far sooner risk the chances of battle than\nprolong a war in a manner so disastrous to his subjects; while by\nadopting the latter method, and shutting yourself up in a town with\nyour army, there is manifest danger of your being besieged, and\npresently reduced by famine and forced to surrender. Wherefore it is\nmost mischievous to seek to avoid battle in either of these two ways.\nTo intrench yourself in a strong position, as Fabius was wont to do, is\na good method when your army is so formidable that the enemy dare not\nadvance to attack you in your intrenchments; yet it cannot truly be\nsaid that Fabius avoided battle, but rather that he sought to give\nbattle where he could do so with advantage. For had Hannibal desired to\nfight, Fabius would have waited for him and fought him. But Hannibal\nnever dared to engage him on his own ground. So that an engagement was\navoided as much by Hannibal as by Fabius, since if either had been\nminded to fight at all hazards the other would have been constrained to\ntake one of three courses, that is to say, one or other of the two just\nnow mentioned, or else to retreat. The truth of this is confirmed by\nnumberless examples, and more particularly by what happened in the war\nwaged by the Romans against Philip of Macedon, the father of Perseus.\nFor Philip being invaded by the Romans, resolved not to give them\nbattle; and to avoid battle, sought at first to do as Fabius had done\nin Italy, posting himself on the summit of a hill, where he intrenched\nhimself strongly, thinking that the Romans would not venture to attack\nhim there. But they advancing and attacking him in his intrenchments,\ndrove him from his position; when, unable to make further resistance,\nhe fled with the greater part of his army, and was only saved from\nutter destruction by the difficulty of the ground, which made it\nimpossible for the Romans to pursue him.\nPhilip, therefore, who had no mind to fight, encamping too near the\nRomans, was forced to fly; and learning from this experience that to\nescape fighting it was not enough for him to intrench himself on a\nhill, yet not choosing to shut himself up in a walled town, he was\nconstrained to take the other alternative of keeping at a distance of\nmany miles from the Roman legions. Accordingly, when the Romans entered\none province, he betook himself to another, and when they left a\nprovince he entered it. But perceiving that by protracting the war in\nthis way, his condition grew constantly worse, while his subjects\nsuffered grievously, now from his own troops, at another time from\nthose of the enemy, he at last resolved to hazard battle, and so came\nto a regular engagement with the Romans.\nIt is for your interest, therefore, not to fight, when you possess the\nsame advantages as Fabius, or as Cneius Sulpitius had; in other words,\nwhen your army is so formidable in itself that the enemy dare not\nattack you in your intrenchments, and although he has got within your\nterritory has yet gained no footing there, and suffers in consequence\nfrom the want of necessary supplies. In such circumstances delay is\nuseful, for the reasons assigned by Titus Livius when speaking of\nSulpitius. In no other circumstances, however, can an engagement be\navoided without dishonour or danger. For to retire as Philip did, is\nnothing else than defeat; and the disgrace is greater in proportion as\nyour valour has been less put to the proof. And if Philip was lucky\nenough to escape, another, not similarly favoured by the nature of the\nground, might not have the same good fortune.\nThat Hannibal was not a master in the arts of warfare there is none\nwill venture to maintain. Wherefore, when he had to encounter Scipio in\nAfrica, it may be assumed that had he seen any advantage in prolonging\nthe war he would have done so; and, possibly, being a skilful captain\nand in command of a valiant army, he might have been able to do what\nFabius did in Italy. But since he took not that course, we may infer\nthat he was moved by sufficient reasons. For the captain who has got an\narmy together, and perceives that from want of money or friends he\ncannot maintain it long, must be a mere madman if he do not at once,\nand before his army melts away, try the fortunes of battle; since he is\ncertain to lose by delay, while by fighting he may chance to succeed.\nAnd there is this also to be kept in view, that we must strive, even if\nwe be defeated, to gain glory; and that more glory is to be won in\nbeing beaten by force, than in a defeat from any other cause. And this\nwe may suppose to have weighed with Hannibal. On the other hand,\nsupposing Hannibal to have declined battle, Scipio, even if he had\nlacked courage to follow him up and attack him in his intrenched camp,\nwould not have suffered thereby; for as he had defeated Syphax, and got\npossession of many of the African towns, he could have rested where he\nwas in the same security and with the same convenience as if he had\nbeen in Italy. But this was not the case with Hannibal when he had to\nencounter Fabius, nor with the Gauls when they were opposed to\nSulpitius.\nLeast of all can he decline battle who invades with his army the\ncountry of another; for seeking to enter his enemy\u2019s country, he must\nfight whenever the enemy comes forward to meet him; and is under still\ngreater necessity to fight, if he undertake the siege of any town. As\nhappened in our own day with Duke Charles of Burgundy, who, when\nbeleaguering Morat, a town of the Swiss, was by them attacked and\nrouted; or as happened with the French army encamped against Novara,\nwhich was in like manner defeated by the Swiss.\nCHAPTER XI.\u2014_That one who has to contend with many, though he be weaker\nthan they, will prevail if he can withstand their first onset._\nThe power exercised in Rome by the tribunes of the people was great,\nand, as I have repeatedly explained, was necessary, since otherwise\nthere would have been no check on the ambition of the nobles, and the\ncommonwealth must have grown corrupted far sooner than it did. But\nbecause, as I have said elsewhere, there is in everything a latent evil\npeculiar to it, giving rise to new mischances, it becomes necessary to\nprovide against these by new ordinances. The authority of the tribunes,\ntherefore, being insolently asserted so as to become formidable to the\nnobility and to the entire city, disorders dangerous to the liberty of\nthe State must thence have resulted, had not a method been devised by\nAppius Claudius for controlling the ambition of the tribunes. This was,\nto secure that there should always be one of their number timid, or\nvenal, or else a lover of the general good, who could be influenced to\noppose the rest whenever these sought to pass any measure contrary to\nthe wishes of the senate. This remedy was a great restraint on the\nexcessive authority of the tribunes, and on many occasions proved\nserviceable to Rome.\nI am led by this circumstance to remark, that when many powerful\npersons are united against one, who, although no match for the others\ncollectively, is also powerful, the chances are more in favour of this\nsingle and less I powerful person, than of the many who together are\nmuch stronger. For setting aside an infinity of accidents which can be\nturned to better account by one than by many, it will always happen\nthat, by exercising a little dexterity, the one will be able to divide\nthe many, and weaken the force which was strong while it was united. In\nproof whereof, I shall not refer to ancient examples, though many such\nmight be cited, but content myself with certain modern instances taken\nfrom the events of our own times.\nIn the year 1484, all Italy combined against the Venetians, who finding\ntheir position desperate, and being unable to keep their army any\nlonger in the field, bribed Signer Lodovico, who then governed Milan,\nand so succeeded in effecting a settlement, whereby they not only\nrecovered the towns they had lost, but also obtained for themselves a\npart of the territories of Ferrara; so that those were by peace the\ngainers, who in war had been the losers. Not many years ago the whole\nworld was banded together against France; but before the war came to a\nclose, Spain breaking with the confederates and entering into a\nseparate treaty with France, the other members of the league also, were\npresently forced to make terms.\nWherefore we may always assume when we see a war set on foot by many\nagainst one, that this one, if he have strength to withstand the first\nshock, and can temporize and wait his opportunity, is certain to\nprevail. But unless he can do this he runs a thousand dangers: as did\nthe Venetians in the year 1508, who, could they have temporized with\nthe French, and so got time to conciliate some of those who had\ncombined against them, might have escaped the ruin which then overtook\nthem. But not possessing such a strong army as would have enabled them\nto temporize with their enemies, and consequently not having the time\nneeded for gaining any to their side, they were undone. Yet we know\nthat the Pope, as soon as he had obtained what he wanted, made friends\nwith them, and that Spain did the like; and that both the one and the\nother of these powers would gladly have saved the Lombard territory for\nthemselves, nor would, if they could have helped it, have left it to\nFrance, so as to augment her influence in Italy.\nThe Venetians, therefore, should have given up a part to save the rest;\nand had they done so at a time when the surrender would not have seemed\nto be made under compulsion, and before any step had been taken in the\ndirection of war, it would have been a most prudent course; although\ndiscreditable and probably of little avail after war had been begun.\nBut until the war broke out, few of the Venetian citizens recognized\nthe danger, fewer still the remedy, and none ventured to prescribe it.\nBut to return to the point whence we started, I say that the same\nsafeguard for their country which the Roman senate found against the\nambition of the tribunes in their number, is within the reach of the\nprince who is attacked by many adversaries, if he only know to use\nprudently those methods which promote division.\nCHAPTER XII.\u2014_A prudent Captain will do what he can to make it\nnecessary for his own Soldiers to fight, and to relieve his Enemy from\nthat necessity._\nElsewhere I have noted how greatly men are governed in what they do by\nNecessity, and how much of their renown is due to her guidance, so that\nit has even been said by some philosophers, that the hands and tongues\nof men, the two noblest instruments of their fame, would never have\nworked to perfection, nor have brought their labours to that pitch of\nexcellence we see them to have reached, had they not been impelled by\nthis cause. The captains of antiquity, therefore, knowing the virtues\nof this necessity, and seeing the steadfast courage which it gave their\nsoldiers in battle, spared no effort to bring their armies under its\ninfluence, while using all their address to loosen its hold upon their\nenemies. For which reason, they would often leave open to an adversary\nsome way which they might have closed, and close against their own men\nsome way they might have left open.\nWhosoever, therefore, would have a city defend itself stubbornly, or an\narmy fight resolutely in the field, must before all things endeavour to\nimpress the minds of those whom he commands with the belief that no\nother course is open to them. In like manner a prudent captain who\nundertakes the attack of a city, will measure the ease or difficulty of\nhis enterprise, by knowing and considering the nature of the necessity\nwhich compels the inhabitants to defend it; and where he finds that\nnecessity to be strong, he may infer that his task will be difficult,\nbut if otherwise, that it will be easy.\nAnd hence it happens that cities are harder to be recovered after a\nrevolt than to be taken for the first time. Because on a first attack,\nhaving no occasion to fear punishment, since they have given no ground\nof offence, they readily surrender; but when they have revolted, they\nknow that they have given ground of offence, and, fearing punishment,\nare not so easily brought under. A like stubbornness grows from the\nnatural hostility with which princes or republics who are neighbours\nregard one another; which again is caused by the desire to dominate\nover those who live near, or from jealousy of their power. This is more\nparticularly the case with republics, as in Tuscany for example; for\ncontention and rivalry have always made, and always will make it\nextremely hard for one republic to bring another into subjection. And\nfor this reason any one who considers attentively who are the\nneighbours of Florence, and who of Venice, will not marvel so much as\nsome have done, that Florence should have spent more than Venice on her\nwars and gained less; since this results entirely from the Venetians\nfinding their neighbouring towns less obstinate in their resistance\nthan the Florentines theirs. For all the towns in the neighbourhood of\nVenice have been used to live under princes and not in freedom; and\nthose who are used to servitude commonly think little of changing\nmasters, nay are often eager for the change. In this way Venice, though\nshe has had more powerful neighbours than Florence, has been able, from\nfinding their towns less stubborn, to subdue them more easily than the\nlatter, surrounded exclusively by free cities, has had it in her power\nto do.\nBut, to return to the matter in hand, the captain who attacks a town\nshould use what care he can, not to drive the defenders to extremities,\nlest he render them stubborn; but when they fear punishment should\npromise them pardon, and when they fear for their freedom should assure\nthem that he has no designs against the common welfare, but only\nagainst a few ambitious men in their city; for such assurances have\noften smoothed the way to the surrender of towns. And although pretexts\nof this sort are easily seen through, especially by the wise, the mass\nof the people are often beguiled by them, because desiring present\ntranquillity, they shut their eyes to the snares hidden behind these\nspecious promises. By means such as these, therefore, cities\ninnumerable have been brought into subjection, as recently was the case\nwith Florence. The ruin of Crassus and his army was similarly caused:\nfor although he himself saw through the empty promises of the\nParthians, as meant only to blind the Roman soldiers to the necessity\nof defending themselves, yet he could not keep his men steadfast, they,\nas we clearly gather in reading the life of this captain, being\ndeceived by the offers of peace held out to them by their enemies.\nOn the other hand, when the Samnites, who, at the instance of a few\nambitious men, and in violation of the terms of the truce made with\nthem, had overrun and pillaged lands belonging to the allies of Rome,\nafterwards sent envoys to Rome to implore peace, offering to restore\nwhatever they had taken, and to surrender the authors of these injuries\nand outrages as prisoners, and these offers were rejected by the\nRomans, and the envoys returned to Samnium bringing with them no hope\nof an adjustment, Claudius Pontius, who then commanded the army of the\nSamnites, showed them in a remarkable speech, that the Romans desired\nwar at all hazards, and declared that, although for the sake of his\ncountry he wished for peace, necessity constrained him to prepare for\nwar; telling them \u201c_that was a just war which could not be escaped, and\nthose arms sacred in which lay their only hopes._\u201d And building on this\nnecessity, he raised in the minds of his soldiers a confident\nexpectation of success. That I may not have to revert to this matter\nagain, it will be convenient to notice here those examples from Roman\nhistory which most merit attention. When Caius Manilius was in command\nof the legions encamped against Veii, a division of the Veientine army\nhaving got within the Roman intrenchments, Manilius ran forward with a\ncompany of his men to defend them, and, to prevent the escape of the\nVeientines, guarded all the approaches to the camp. The Veientines\nfinding themselves thus shut in, began to fight with such fury that\nthey slew Manilius, and would have destroyed all the rest of the Roman\narmy, had not the prudence of one of the tribunes opened a way for the\nVeientines to retreat. Here we see that so long as necessity compelled,\nthe Veientines fought most fiercely, but on finding a path opened for\nescape, preferred flight to combat. On another occasion when the\nVolscians and Equians passed with their armies across the Roman\nfrontier, the consuls were sent out to oppose them, and an engagement\nensued. It so happened that when the combat was at its height, the army\nof the Volscians, commanded by Vectius Mescius, suddenly found\nthemselves shut in between their own camp, which a division of the\nRomans had occupied, and the body of the Roman army; when seeing that\nthey must either perish or cut a way for themselves with their swords,\nVectius said to them, \u201c_Come on, my men, here is no wall or rampart to\nbe scaled: we fight man with man; in valour we are their equals, and\nnecessity, that last and mightiest weapon, gives us the advantage._\u201d\nHere, then, necessity is spoken of by Titus Livius as _the last and\nmightiest weapon_.\nCamillus, the wisest and most prudent of all the Roman commanders, when\nhe had got within the town of Veii with his army, to make its surrender\neasier and not to drive its inhabitants to desperation, called out to\nhis men, so that the Veientines might hear, to spare all whom they\nfound unarmed. Whereupon the defenders throwing away their weapons, the\ntown was taken almost without bloodshed. And this device was afterwards\nfollowed by many other captains.\nCHAPTER XIII.\u2014_Whether we may trust more to a valiant Captain with a\nweak Army, or to a valiant Army with a weak Captain._\nCoriolanus being banished from Rome betook himself to the Volscians,\nand when he had got together an army wherewith to avenge himself on his\ncountrymen, came back to Rome; yet, again withdrew, not constrained to\nretire by the might of the Roman arms, but out of reverence for his\nmother. From this incident, says Titus Livius, we may learn that the\nspread of the Roman power was due more to the valour of her captains\nthan of her soldiers. For before this the Volscians had always been\nrouted, and only grew successful when Coriolanus became their captain.\nBut though Livius be of this opinion, there are many passages in his\nhistory to show that the Roman soldiers, even when left without\nleaders, often performed astonishing feats of valour, nay, sometimes\nmaintained better discipline and fought with greater spirit after their\nconsuls were slain than they had before. For example, the army under\nthe Scipios in Spain, after its two leaders had fallen, was able by its\nvalour not merely to secure its own safety, but to overcome the enemy\nand preserve the province for the Roman Republic. So that to state the\ncase fairly, we find many instances in which the valour of the soldiers\nalone gained the day, as well as many in which success was wholly due\nto the excellence of the captain. From which it may be inferred that\nthe one stands in need of the other.\nAnd here the question suggests itself: which is the more formidable, a\ngood army badly led, or a good captain commanding an indifferent army;\nthough, were we to adopt the opinion of C\u00e6sar on this head, we ought\nlightly to esteem both. For when C\u00e6sar went to Spain against Afranius\nand Petreius, who were there in command of a strong army, he made\nlittle account of them, saying, \u201c_that he went to fight an army without\na captain_,\u201d indicating thereby the weakness of these generals. And,\nconversely, when he went to encounter Pompeius in Thessaly, he said,\n\u201c_I go against a captain without an army_.\u201d[13]\n[13] Professus ante inter suos, ire se ad exercitum sine duce, et inde\nreversurum ad ducem sine exercitu. (_Suet. in Vita J. Caes._)\nA further question may also be raised, whether it is easier for a good\ncaptain to make a good army, or for a good army to make a good captain.\nAs to this it might be thought there was barely room for doubt, since\nit ought to be far easier for many who are good to find one who is good\nor teach him to become so, than for one who is good to find or make\nmany good. Lucullus when sent against Mithridates was wholly without\nexperience in war: but his brave army, which was provided with many\nexcellent officers, speedily taught him to be a good captain. On the\nother hand, when the Romans, being badly off for soldiers, armed a\nnumber of slaves and gave them over to be drilled by Sempronius\nGracchus, he in a short time made them into a serviceable army. So too,\nas I have already mentioned, Pelopidas and Epaminondas after rescuing\nThebes, their native city, from Spartan thraldom, in a short time made\nsuch valiant soldiers of the Theban peasantry, as to be able with their\naid not only to withstand, but even to defeat the Spartan armies. So\nthat the question may seem to be equally balanced, excellence on one\nside generally finding excellence on the other.\nA good army, however, when left without a good leader, as the\nMacedonian army was on the death of Alexander, or as those veterans\nwere who had fought in the civil wars, is apt to grow restless and\nturbulent. Wherefore I am convinced that it is better to trust to the\ncaptain who has time allowed him to discipline his men, and means\nwherewith to equip them, than to a tumultuary host with a chance leader\nof its own choosing. But twofold is the merit and twofold the glory of\nthose captains who not only have had to subdue their enemies, but also\nbefore encountering them to organize and discipline their forces. This,\nhowever, is a task requiring qualities so seldom combined, that were\nmany of those captains who now enjoy a great name with the world,\ncalled on to perform it, they would be much less thought of than they\nare.\nCHAPTER XIV.\u2014_Of the effect produced in Battle by strange and\nunexpected Sights or Sounds._\nThat the disorder occasioned by strange and unexpected sights or sounds\nmay have momentous consequences in combat, might be shown by many\ninstances, but by none better than by what befell in the battle fought\nbetween the Romans and the Volscians, when Quintius, the Roman general,\nseeing one wing of his army begin to waver, shouted aloud to his men to\nstand firm, for the other wing was already victorious. Which words of\nhis giving confidence to his own troops and striking the enemy with\ndismay won him the battle. But if a cry like this, produce great effect\non a well disciplined army, far greater must be its effect on one which\nis ill disciplined and disorderly. For by such a wind the whole mass\nwill be moved, as I shall show by a well-known instance happening in\nour own times.\nA few years ago the city of Perugia was split into the two factions of\nthe Baglioni and the Oddi, the former holding the government, the\nlatter being in exile. The Oddeschi, however, with the help of friends,\nhaving got together an armed force which they lodged in villages of\ntheir own near Perugia, obtained, by the favour of some of their party,\nan entrance into the city by night, and moving forward without\ndiscovery, came as far as the public square. And as all the streets of\nPerugia are barred with chains drawn across them at their corners, the\nOddeschi had in front of them a man who carried an iron hammer\nwherewith to break the fastenings of the chains so that horsemen might\npass. When the only chain remaining unbroken was that which closed the\npublic square, the alarm having now been given, the hammerman was so\nimpeded by the crowd pressing behind him that he could not raise his\narm to strike freely. Whereupon, to get more room for his work, he\ncalled aloud to the others to stand back; and the word back passing\nfrom rank to rank those furthest off began to run, and, presently, the\nothers also, with such precipitancy, that they fell into utter\ndisorder. In this way, and from this trifling circumstance, the attempt\nof the Oddeschi came to nothing.\nHere we may note that discipline is needed in an army, not so much to\nenable it to fight according to a settled order, as that it may not be\nthrown into confusion by every insignificant accident. For a tumultuary\nhost is useless in war, simply because every word, or cry, or sound,\nmay throw it into a panic and cause it to fly. Wherefore it behoves a\ngood captain to provide that certain fixed persons shall receive his\norders and pass them on to the rest, and to accustom his soldiers to\nlook to these persons, and to them only, to be informed what his orders\nare. For whenever this precaution is neglected the gravest mishaps are\nconstantly seen to ensue.\nAs regards strange and unexpected sights, every captain should\nendeavour while his army is actually engaged with the enemy, to effect\nsome such feint or diversion as will encourage his own men and dismay\nhis adversary since this of all things that can happen is the likeliest\nto ensure victory. In evidence whereof we may cite the example of\nCneius Sulpitius, the Roman dictator, who, when about to give battle to\nthe Gauls, after arming his sutlers and camp followers, mounted them on\nmules and other beasts of burden, furnished them with spears and\nbanners to look like cavalry, and placing them behind a hill, ordered\nthem on a given signal, when the fight was at the hottest, to appear\nand show themselves to the enemy. All which being carried out as he had\narranged, threw the Gauls into such alarm, that they lost the battle.\nA good captain, therefore, has two things to see to: first, to contrive\nhow by some sudden surprise he may throw his enemy into confusion; and\nnext, to be prepared should the enemy use a like stratagem against him\nto discover and defeat it; as the stratagem of Semiramis was defeated\nby the King of India. For Semiramis seeing that this king had elephants\nin great numbers, to dismay him by showing that she, too, was well\nsupplied, caused the skins of many oxen and buffaloes to be sewn\ntogether in the shape of elephants and placed upon camels and sent to\nthe front. But the trick being detected by the king, turned out not\nonly useless but hurtful to its contriver. In a battle which the\nDictator Mamercus fought against the people of Fidenae, the latter, to\nstrike terror into the minds of the Romans, contrived that while the\ncombat raged a number of soldiers should issue from Fidenae bearing\nlances tipped with fire, thinking that the Romans, disturbed by so\nstrange a sight, would be thrown into confusion.\nWe are to note, however, with regard to such contrivances, that if they\nare to serve any useful end, they should _be_ formidable as well as\n_seem_ so; for when they menace a real danger, their weak points are\nnot so soon discerned. When they have more of pretence than reality, it\nwill be well either to dispense with them altogether, or resorting to\nthem, to keep them, like the muleteers of Sulpitius, in the background,\nso that they be not too readily found out. For any weakness inherent in\nthem is soon discovered if they be brought near, when, as happened with\nthe elephants of Semiramis and the fiery spears of the men of Fidenae,\nthey do harm rather than good. For although by this last-mentioned\ndevice the Romans at the first were somewhat disconcerted, so soon as\nthe dictator came up and began to chide them, asking if they were not\nashamed to fly like bees from smoke, and calling on them to turn on\ntheir enemy, and \u201c_with her own flames efface that Fidenae whom their\nbenefits could not conciliate_,\u201d they took courage; so that the device\nproved of no service to its contrivers, who were vanquished in the\nbattle.\nCHAPTER XV.\u2014_That one and not many should head an Army: and why it is\nharmful to have more Leaders than one._\nThe men of Fidenae rising against the colonists whom the Romans had\nsettled among them, and putting them to the sword, the Romans to avenge\nthe insult appointed four tribunes with consular powers: one of whom\nthey retained to see to the defence of Rome, while the other three were\nsent against the Fidenati and the Veientines. But these three falling\nout among themselves, and being divided in their counsels, returned\nfrom their mission with discredit though not with loss. Of which\ndiscredit they were themselves the cause. That they sustained no loss\nwas due to the valour of their soldiers But the senate perceiving the\nsource of the mischief, to the end that one man might put to rights\nwhat three had thrown into confusion, resorted to the appointment of a\ndictator.\nHere we see the disadvantage of having several leaders in one army or\nin a town which has to defend itself. And the case could not be put in\nclearer words than by Titus Livius, where he says, \u201c_The three tribunes\nwith consular authority gave proof how hurtful it is in war to have\nmany leaders; for each forming a different opinion, and each abiding by\nhis own, they threw opportunities in the way of their enemies._\u201d And\nthough this example suffice by itself to show the disadvantage in war\nof divided commands, to make the matter still plainer I shall cite two\nfurther instances, one ancient and one modern.\nIn the year 1500, Louis XII. of France, after recovering Milan, sent\ntroops to restore Pisa to the Florentines, Giovambattista Ridolfi and\nLuca d\u2019Antonio Albizzi going with them as commissaries. Now, because\nGiovambattista had a great name, and was older than Luca, the latter\nleft the whole management of everything to him; and although he did not\nshow his jealousy of him by opposing him, he betrayed it by his\nsilence, and by being so careless and indifferent about everything,\nthat he gave no help in the business of the siege either by word or\ndeed, just as though he had been a person of no account. But when, in\nconsequence of an accident, Giovambattista had to return to Florence,\nall this was changed; for Luca, remaining in sole charge, behaved with\nthe greatest courage, prudence, and zeal, all which qualities had been\nhidden while he held a joint command. Further to bear me out I shall\nagain borrow the words of Titus Livius, who, in relating how when\nQuintius and Agrippa his colleague were sent by the Romans against the\nEquians, Agrippa contrived that the conduct of the war should rest with\nQuintius, observes, \u201c_Most wholesome is it that in affairs of great\nmoment, supreme authority be vested in one man._\u201d Very different,\nhowever, is the course followed by the republics and princes of our own\ndays, who, thinking to be better served, are used to appoint several\ncaptains or commissioners to fill one command; a practice giving rise\nto so much confusion, that were we seeking for the causes of the\noverthrow of the French and Italian armies in recent times, we should\nfind this to be the most active of any.\nRightly, therefore, may we conclude that in sending forth an army upon\nservice, it is wiser to entrust it to one man of ordinary prudence,\nthan to two of great parts but with a divided command.\nCHAPTER XVI.\u2014_That in Times of Difficulty true Worth is sought after;\nwhereas in quiet Times it is not the most deserving, but those who are\nrecommended by Wealth or Connection who are most in favour._\nIt always has happened and always will, that the great and admirable\nmen of a republic are neglected in peaceful times; because at such\nseasons many citizens are found, who, envying the reputation these men\nhave justly earned, seek to be regarded not merely as their equals but\nas their superiors. Touching this there is a notable passage in\nThucydides, the Greek historian, where he tells how the republic of\nAthens coming victorious out of the Peloponessian war, wherein she had\nbridled the pride of Sparta, and brought almost the whole of Greece\nunder her authority, was encouraged by the greatness of her renown to\npropose to herself the conquest of Sicily. In Athens this scheme was\nmuch debated, Alcibiades and certain others who had the public welfare\nvery little in their thoughts, but who hoped that the enterprise, were\nthey placed in command, might minister to their fame, recommending that\nit should be undertaken. Nicias, on the other hand, one of the best\nesteemed of the Athenian citizens, was against it, and in addressing\nthe people, gave it as the strongest reason for trusting his advice,\nthat in advising them not to engage in this war, he urged what was not\nfor his own advantage; for he knew that while Athens remained at peace\nnumberless citizens were ready to take precedence of him: whereas, were\nwar declared, he was certain that none would rank before him or even be\nlooked upon as his equal.\nHere we see that in tranquil times republics are subject to the\ninfirmity of lightly esteeming their worthiest citizens. And this\noffends these persons for two reasons: first, because they are not\ngiven the place they deserve; and second, because they see unworthy men\nand of abilities inferior to their own, as much or more considered than\nthey. Injustice such as this has caused the ruin of many republics. For\ncitizens who find themselves undeservedly slighted, and perceive the\ncause to be that the times are tranquil and not troubled, will strive\nto change the times by stirring up wars hurtful to the public welfare.\nWhen I look for remedies for this state of things, I find two: first,\nto keep the citizens poor, so that wealth without worth shall corrupt\nneither them nor others; second, to be so prepared for war as always to\nbe ready to make war; for then there will always be a need for worthy\ncitizens, as was the case in Rome in early times. For as Rome\nconstantly kept her armies in the field, there was constant opportunity\nfor men to display their valour, nor was it possible to deprive a\ndeserving man of his post and give it to another who was not deserving.\nOr if ever this were done by inadvertency, or by way of experiment,\nthere forthwith resulted such disorder and danger, that the city at\nonce retraced its steps and reverted to the true path. But other\nrepublics which are not regulated on the same plan, and make war only\nwhen driven to it by necessity, cannot help committing this injustice,\nnay, will constantly run into it, when, if the great citizen who finds\nhimself slighted be vindictive, and have some credit and following in\nthe city, disorder will always ensue. And though Rome escaped this\ndanger for a time, she too, as has elsewhere been said, having no\nlonger, after she had conquered Carthage and Antiochus, any fear of\nwar, came to think she might commit her armies to whom she would,\nmaking less account of the valour of her captains than of those other\nqualities which gain favour with the people. Accordingly we find Paulus\nEmilius rejected oftener than once when he sought the consulship; nor,\nin fact, obtaining it until the Macedonian war broke out, which, being\njudged a formidable business, was by the voice of the whole city\ncommitted to his management. After the year 1494 our city of Florence\nwas involved in a series of wars, in conducting which none of our\ncitizens had any success until chance threw the command into the hands\nof one who showed us how an army should be led. This was Antonio\nGiacomini, and so long as there were dangerous wars on foot, all\nrivalry on the part of other citizens was suspended; and whenever a\ncaptain or commissary had to be appointed he was unopposed. But when a\nwar came to be undertaken, as to the issue of which no misgivings were\nfelt, and which promised both honour and preferment, so numerous were\nthe competitors for command, that three commissaries having to be\nchosen to conduct the siege of Pisa, Antonio was left out; and though\nit cannot with certainty be shown that any harm resulted to our\nrepublic from his not having been sent on this enterprise, we may\nreasonably conjecture that such was indeed the case. For as the people\nof Pisa were then without means either for subsistence or defence, it\nmay be believed that had Antonio been there he would have reduced them\nto such extremities as would have forced them to surrender at\ndiscretion to the Florentines. But Pisa being besieged by captains who\nknew neither how to blockade nor how to storm it, held out so long,\nthat the Florentines, who should have reduced it by force, were obliged\nto buy its submission. Neglect like this might well move Antonio to\nresentment; and he must needs have been both very patient and very\nforgiving if he felt no desire to revenge himself when he could, by the\nruin of the city or by injuries to individual citizens. But a republic\nshould beware not to rouse such feelings, as I shall show in the\nfollowing Chapter.\nCHAPTER XVII.\u2014_That we are not to offend a Man, and then send him to\nfill an important Office or Command._\nA republic should think twice before appointing to an important command\na citizen who has sustained notable wrong at the hands of his\nfellow-citizens. Claudius Nero, quitting the army with which he was\nopposing Hannibal, went with a part of his forces into the March of\nAncona, designing to join the other consul there, and after joining him\nto attack Hasdrubal before he came up with his brother. Now Claudius\nhad previously commanded against Hasdrubal in Spain, and after driving\nhim with his army into such a position that it seemed he must either\nfight at a disadvantage or perish by famine, had been outwitted by his\nadversary, who, while diverting his attention with proposals of terms,\ncontrived to slip through his hands and rob him of the opportunity for\neffecting his destruction. This becoming known in Rome brought Claudius\ninto so much discredit both with the senate and people, that to his\ngreat mortification and displeasure, he was slightingly spoken of by\nthe whole city. But being afterwards made consul and sent to oppose\nHannibal, he took the course mentioned above, which was in itself so\nhazardous that all Rome was filled with doubt and anxiety until tidings\ncame of Hasdrubal\u2019s defeat. When subsequently asked why he had played\nso dangerous a game, wherein without urgent necessity he had staked the\nvery existence of Rome, Claudius answered, he had done so because he\nknew that were he to succeed he would recover whatever credit he had\nlost in Spain; while if he failed, and his attempt had an untoward\nissue, he would be revenged on that city and On those citizens who had\nso ungratefully and indiscreetly wronged him.\nBut if resentment for an offence like this so deeply moved a Roman\ncitizen at a time when Rome was still uncorrupted, we should consider\nhow it may act on the citizen of a State not constituted as Rome then\nwas. And because there is no certain remedy we can apply to such\ndisorders when they arise in republics, it follows that it is\nimpossible to establish a republic which shall endure always; since in\na thousand unforeseen ways ruin may overtake it.\nCHAPTER XVIII.\u2014_That it is the highest Quality of a Captain to be able\nto forestall the designs of his Adversary._\nIt was a saying of Epaminondas the Theban that nothing was so useful\nand necessary for a commander as to be able to see through the\nintentions and designs of his adversary. And because it is hard to come\nat this knowledge directly, the more credit is due to him who reaches\nit by conjecture. Yet sometimes it is easier to fathom an enemy\u2019s\ndesigns than to construe his actions; and not so much those actions\nwhich are done at a distance from us, as those done in our presence and\nunder our very eyes. For instance, it has often happened that when a\nbattle has lasted till nightfall, the winner has believed himself the\nloser, and the loser has believed himself the winner and that this\nmistake has led him who made it to follow a course hurtful to himself.\nIt was from a mistake of this sort, that Brutus and Cassius lost the\nbattle of Philippi. For though Brutus was victorious with his wing of\nthe army Cassius, whose wing was beaten, believed the entire army to be\ndefeated, and under this belief gave way to despair and slew himself.\nSo too, in our own days, in the battle fought by Francis, king of\nFrance, with the Swiss at Santa Cecilia in Lombardy, when night fell,\nthose of the Swiss who remained unbroken, not knowing that the rest had\nbeen routed and slain, thought they had the victory; and so believing\nwould not retreat, but, remaining on the field, renewed the combat the\nfollowing morning to their great disadvantage. Nor were they the only\nsufferers from their mistake, since the armies of the Pope and of Spain\nwere also misled by it, and well-nigh brought to destruction. For on\nthe false report of a victory they crossed the Po, and had they only\nadvanced a little further must have been made prisoners by the\nvictorious French.\nAn instance is recorded of a like mistake having been made in the camps\nboth of the Romans and of the Equians. For the Consul Sempronius being\nin command against the Equians, and giving the enemy battle, the\nengagement lasted with varying success till nightfall, when as both\narmies had suffered what was almost a defeat, neither returned to their\ncamp, but each drew off to the neighboring hills where they thought\nthey would be safer. The Romans separated into two divisions, one of\nwhich with the consul, the other with the centurion Tempanius by whose\nvalour the army had that day been saved from utter rout. At daybreak\nthe consul, without waiting for further tidings of the enemy, made\nstraight for Rome; and the Equians, in like manner, withdrew to their\nown country. For as each supposed the other to be victorious, neither\nthought much of leaving their camp to be plundered by the enemy. It so\nchanced, however, that Tempanius, who was himself retreating with the\nsecond division of the Roman army, fell in with certain wounded\nEquians, from whom he learned that their commanders had fled,\nabandoning their camp; on hearing which, he at once returned to the\nRoman camp and secured it, and then, after sacking the camp of the\nEquians, went back victorious to Rome. His success, as we see, turned\nentirely on his being the first to be informed of the enemy\u2019s\ncondition. And here we are to note that it may often happen that both\nthe one and the other of two opposed armies shall fall into the same\ndisorder, and be reduced to the same straits; in which case, that which\nsoonest detects the other\u2019s distress is sure to come off best.\nI shall give an instance of this which occurred recently in our own\ncountry. In the year 1498, when the Florentines had a great army in the\nterritory of Pisa and had closely invested the town, the Venetians, who\nhad undertaken its protection, seeing no other way to save it, resolved\nto make a diversion in its favour by attacking the territories of the\nFlorentines in another quarter. Wherefore, having assembled a strong\nforce, they entered Tuscany by the Val di Lamona, and seizing on the\nvillage of Marradi, besieged the stronghold of Castiglione which stands\non the height above it. Getting word of this, the Florentines sought to\nrelieve Marradi, without weakening the army which lay round Pisa. They\naccordingly raised a new levy of foot-soldiers, and equipped a fresh\nsquadron of horse, which they despatched to Marradi under the joint\ncommand of Jacopo IV. d\u2019Appiano, lord of Piombino, and Count Rinuccio\nof Marciano. These troops taking up their position on the hill above\nMarradi, the Venetians withdrew from the investment of Castiglione and\nlodged themselves in the village. But when the two armies had\nconfronted one another for several days, both began to suffer sorely\nfrom want of victuals and other necessaries, and neither of them daring\nto attack the other, or knowing to what extremities the other was\nreduced, both simultaneously resolved to strike their camps the\nfollowing morning, and to retreat, the Venetians towards Berzighella\nand Faenza, the Florentines towards Casaglia and the Mugello. But at\ndaybreak, when both armies had begun to remove their baggage, it so\nhappened that an old woman, whose years and poverty permitted her to\npass unnoticed, leaving the village of Marradi, came to the Florentine\ncamp, where were certain of her kinsfolk whom she desired to visit.\nLearning from her that the Venetians were in retreat, the Florentine\ncommanders took courage, and changing their plan, went in pursuit of\nthe enemy as though they had dislodged them, sending word to Florence\nthat they had repulsed the Venetians and gained a victory. But in truth\nthis victory was wholly due to their having notice of the enemy\u2019s\nmovements before the latter had notice of theirs. For had that notice\nbeen given to the Venetians first, it would have wrought against us the\nsame results as it actually wrought for us.\nCHAPTER XIX.\u2014_Whether Indulgence or Severity be more necessary for\ncontrolling a Multitude._\nThe Roman Republic was distracted by the feuds of the nobles and\ncommons. Nevertheless, on war breaking out, Quintius and Appius\nClaudius were sent forth in command of Roman armies. From his harshness\nand severity to his soldiers, Appius was so ill obeyed by them, that\nafter sustaining what almost amounted to a defeat, he had to resign his\ncommand. Quintius, on the contrary, by kindly and humane treatment,\nkept his men obedient and returned victorious to Rome. From this it\nmight seem that to govern a large body of men, it is better to be\nhumane than haughty, and kindly rather than severe.\nAnd yet Cornelius Tacitus, with whom many other authors are agreed,\npronounces a contrary opinion where he says, \u201c_In governing a multitude\nit avails more to punish than to be compliant._\u201d[14] If it be asked how\nthese opposite views can be reconciled, I answer that you exercise\nauthority either over men used to regard you as their equal, or over\nmen who have always been subject to you. When those over whom you\nexercise authority are your equals, you cannot trust wholly to\npunishment or to that severity of which Tacitus speaks. And since in\nRome itself the commons had equal weight with the nobles, none\nappointed their captain for a time only, could control them by using\nharshness and severity. Accordingly we find that those Roman captains\nwho gained the love of their soldiers and were considerate of them,\noften achieved greater results than those who made themselves feared by\nthem in an unusual degree, unless, like Manlius Torquatus, these last\nwere endowed with consummate valour. But he who has to govern subjects\nsuch as those of whom Tacitus speaks, to prevent their growing insolent\nand trampling upon him by reason of his too great easiness, must resort\nto punishment rather than to compliance. Still, to escape hatred,\npunishment should be moderate in degree, for to make himself hated is\nnever for the interest of any prince. And to escape hatred, a prince\nhas chiefly to guard against tampering with the property of any of his\nsubjects; for where nothing is to be gained by it, no prince will\ndesire to shed blood, unless, as seldom happens, constrained to do so\nby necessity. But where advantage is to be gained thereby, blood will\nalways flow, and neither the desire to shed it, nor causes for shedding\nit will ever be wanting, as I have fully shown when discussing this\nsubject in another treatise.\n[14] \u201cIn multitudine regenda plus poena quam obsequium valet.\u201d But\ncompare Annals, III. 55, \u201cObsequium inde in principem et \u00e6mulandi amoi\nvalidioi quam poena ex legibus et metus.\u201d\nQuintius therefore was more deserving of praise than Appius.\nNevertheless the opinion of Tacitus, duly restricted and not understood\nas applying to a case like that of Appius, merits approval. But since I\nhave spoken of punishment and indulgence, it seems not out of place to\nshow how a single act of humanity availed more than arms with the\ncitizens of Falerii.\nCHAPTER XX.\u2014_How one humane act availed more with the men of Falerii,\nthan all the might of the Roman Arms._\nWhen the besieging army of the Romans lay round Falerii, the master of\na school wherein the best-born youths of the city were taught, thinking\nto curry favour with Camillus and the Romans, came forth from the town\nwith these boys, on pretence of giving them exercise, and bringing them\ninto the camp where Camillus was, presented them to him, saying, \u201c_To\nransom these that city would yield itself into your hands._\u201d Camillus,\nhowever, not only rejected this offer, but causing the schoolmaster to\nbe stripped and his hands tied behind him, gave each of the boys a\nscourge, and bade them lead the fellow back to the town scourging him\nas they went. When the citizens of Falerii heard of this, so much were\nthey pleased with the humanity and integrity of Camillus, that they\nresolved to surrender their town to him without further defence.\nThis authentic instance may lead us to believe that a humane and kindly\naction may sometimes touch men\u2019s minds more nearly than a harsh and\ncruel one; and that those cities and provinces into which the\ninstruments and engines of war, with every other violence to which men\nresort, have failed to force a way, may be thrown open to a single act\nof tenderness, mercy, chastity, or generosity. Whereof history supplies\nus with many examples besides the one which I have just now noticed.\nFor we find that when the arms of Rome were powerless to drive Pyrrhus\nout of Italy, he was moved to depart by the generosity of Fabritius in\ndisclosing to him the proposal which his slave had made the Romans to\npoison him. Again, we read how Scipio gained less reputation in Spain\nby the capture of New Carthage, than by his virtue in restoring a young\nand beautiful wife unviolated to her husband; the fame of which action\nwon him the love of the whole province. We see, too, how much this\ngenerous temper is esteemed by a people in its great men; and how much\nit is praised by historians and by those who write the lives of\nprinces, as well as by those who lay down rules of human conduct. Among\nwhom Xenophon has taken great pains to show what honours, and\nvictories, and how fair a fame accrued to Cyrus from his being kindly\nand gracious, without taint of pride, or cruelty, or luxury, or any\nother of those vices which cast a stain upon men\u2019s lives.\nAnd yet when we note that Hannibal, by methods wholly opposite to\nthese, achieved splendid victories and a great renown, I think I am\nbound to say something in my next Chapter as to how this happened.\nCHAPTER XXI.\u2014_How it happened that Hannibal pursuing a course contrary\nto that taken by Scipio, wrought the same results in Italy which the\nother achieved in Spain._\nSome, I suspect, may marvel to find a captain, taking a contrary\ncourse, nevertheless arrive at the same ends as those who have pursued\nthe methods above spoken of; since it must seem as though success did\nnot depend on the causes I have named; nay, that if glory and fame are\nto be won in other ways, these causes neither add to our strength nor\nadvance our fortunes. Wherefore, to make my meaning plain, and not to\npart company with the men of whom I have been speaking, I say, that as,\non the one hand, we see Scipio enter Spain, and by his humane and\ngenerous conduct at once secure the good-will of the province, and the\nadmiration and reverence of its inhabitants, so on the other hand, we\nsee Hannibal enter Italy, and by methods wholly opposite, to wit, by\nviolence and rapine, by cruelty and treachery of every kind, effect in\nthat country the very same results. For all the States of Italy\nrevolted in his favour, and all the Italian nations ranged themselves\non his side.\nWhen we seek to know why this was, several reasons present themselves,\nthe first being that men so passionately love change, that, commonly\nspeaking, those who are well off are as eager for it as those who are\nbadly off: for as already has been said with truth, men are pampered by\nprosperity, soured by adversity. This love of change, therefore, makes\nthem open the door to any one who puts himself at the head of new\nmovements in their country, and if he be a foreigner they adopt his\ncause, if a fellow-countryman they gather round him and become his\npartisans and supporters; so that whatever methods he may there use, he\nwill succeed in making great progress. Moreover, men being moved by two\nchief passions, love and fear, he who makes himself feared commands\nwith no less authority than he who makes himself loved; nay, as a rule,\nis followed and obeyed more implicitly than the other. It matters\nlittle, however, which of these two ways a captain chooses to follow,\nprovided he be of transcendent valour, and has thereby won for himself\na great name For when, like Hannibal or Scipio, a man is very valiant,\nthis quality will cloak any error he may commit in seeking either to be\ntoo much loved or too much feared. Yet from each of these two\ntendencies, grave mischiefs, and such as lead to the ruin of a prince,\nmay arise. For he who would be greatly loved, if he swerve ever so\nlittle from the right road, becomes contemptible; while he who would be\ngreatly feared, if he go a jot too far, incurs hatred. And since it is\nimpossible, our nature not allowing it, to adhere to the exact mean, it\nis essential that any excess should be balanced by an exceeding valour,\nas it was in Hannibal and Scipio. And yet we find that even they, while\nthey were exalted by the methods they followed, were also injured by\nthem. How they were exalted has been shown. The injury which Scipio\nsuffered was, that in Spain his soldiers, in concert with certain of\nhis allies, rose against him, for no other reason than that they stood\nin no fear of him. For men are so restless, that if ever so small a\ndoor be opened to their ambition, they forthwith forget all the love\nthey have borne their prince in return for his graciousness and\ngoodness, as did these soldiers and allies of Scipio; when, to correct\nthe mischief, he was forced to use something of a cruelty foreign to\nhis nature.\nAs to Hannibal, we cannot point to any particular instance wherein his\ncruelty or want of faith are seen to have been directly hurtful to him;\nbut we may well believe that Naples and other towns which remained\nloyal to the Roman people, did so by reason of the dread which his\ncharacter inspired. This, however, is abundantly clear, that his\ninhumanity made him more detested by the Romans than any other enemy\nthey ever had; so that while to Pyrrhus, in Italy with his army, they\ngave up the traitor who offered to poison him, Hannibal, even when\ndisarmed and a fugitive, they never forgave, until they had compassed\nhis death.\nTo Hannibal, therefore, from his being accounted impious, perfidious,\nand cruel, these disadvantages resulted; but, on the other hand, there\naccrued to him one great gain, noticed with admiration by all\nhistorians, namely, that in his army, although made up of men of every\nrace and country, no dissensions ever broke out among the soldiers\nthemselves, nor any mutiny against their leader. This we can only\nascribe to the awe which his character inspired, which together with\nthe great name his valour had won for him, had the effect of keeping\nhis soldiers quiet and united. I repeat, therefore, that it is of\nlittle moment which method a captain may follow if he be endowed with\nsuch valour as will bear him out in the course which he adopts. For, as\nI have said, there are disadvantages incident to both methods unless\ncorrected by extraordinary valour.\nAnd now, since I have spoken of Scipio and Hannibal, the former of whom\nby praiseworthy, the latter by odious qualities, effected the same\nresults, I must not, I think, omit to notice the characters of two\nRoman citizens, who by different, yet both by honourable methods,\nobtained a like glory.\nChapter XXII.\u2014_That the severity of Manlius Torquatus and the\ngentleness of Valerius Corvinus won for both the same Glory._\nThere lived in Rome, at the same time, two excellent captains, Manlius\nTorquatus and Valerius Corvinus, equal in their triumphs and in their\nrenown, and in the valour which in obtaining these they had displayed\nagainst the enemy; but who in the conduct of their armies and treatment\nof their soldiers, followed very different methods. For Manlius, in his\ncommand, resorted to every kind of severity, never sparing his men\nfatigue, nor remitting punishment; while Valerius, on the contrary,\ntreated them with all kindness and consideration, and was easy and\nfamiliar in his intercourse with them. So that while the one, to secure\nthe obedience of his soldiers, put his own son to death, the other\nnever dealt harshly with any man. Yet, for all this diversity in their\nmodes of acting, each had the same success against the enemy, and each\nobtained the same advantages both for the republic and for himself. For\nno soldier of theirs ever flinched in battle, or rose in mutiny against\nthem, or in any particular opposed their will; though the commands of\nManlius were of such severity that any order of excessive rigour came\nto be spoken of as a _Manlian order_.\nHere, then, we have to consider first of all why Manlius was obliged to\nuse such severity; next, why Valerius could behave so humanely;\nthirdly, how it was that these opposite methods had the same results;\nand lastly, which of the two methods it is better and more useful for\nus to follow. Now, if we well examine the character of Manlius from the\nmoment when Titus Livius first begins to make mention of him, we shall\nfind him to have been endowed with a rare vigour both of mind and body,\ndutiful in his behaviour to his father and to his country, and most\nreverent to his superiors. All which we see in his slaying the Gaul, in\nhis defence of his father against the tribune, and in the words in\nwhich, before going forth to fight the Gaul, he addressed the consul,\nwhen he said, \u201c_Although assured of victory, never will I without thy\nbidding engage an enemy._\u201d But when such a man as this attains to\ncommand, he looks to find all others like himself; his dauntless spirit\nprompts him to engage in daring enterprises, and to insist on their\nbeing carried out. And this is certain, that where things hard to\nexecute are ordered to be done, the order must be enforced with\nsternness, since, otherwise, it will be disobeyed.\nAnd here be it noted that if you would be obeyed you must know how to\ncommand, and that they alone have this knowledge who have measured\ntheir power to enforce, with the willingness of others to yield\nobedience; and who issue their orders when they find these conditions\ncombining, but, otherwise, abstain. Wherefore, a wise man was wont to\nsay that to hold a republic by force, there must be a proportion\nbetween him who uses the force and him against whom it is used; and\nthat while this proportion obtains the force will operate; but that\nwhen he who suffers is stronger than he who uses the force, we may\nexpect to see it brought to an end at any moment.\nBut returning to the matter in hand, I say that to command things hard\nof execution, requires hardness in him who gives the command, and that\na man of this temper and who issues such commands, cannot look to\nenforce them by gentleness. He who is not of such a temper must be\ncareful not to impose tasks of extraordinary difficulty, but may use\nhis natural gentleness in imposing such as are ordinary. For common\npunishments are not imputed to the prince, but to the laws and\nordinances which he has to administer.\nWe must believe, therefore, that Manlius was constrained to act with\nseverity by the unusual character of the commands which his natural\ndisposition prompted him to issue. Such commands are useful in a\nrepublic, as restoring its ordinances to their original efficacy and\nexcellence. And were a republic, as I have before observed, fortunate\nenough to come frequently under the influence of men who, by their\nexample, reinforce its laws, and not only retard its progress towards\ncorruption, but bring it back to its first perfection, it might endure\nfor ever.\nManlius, therefore, was of those who by the severity of their commands\nmaintained the military discipline of Rome; urged thereto, in the first\nplace, by his natural temper, and next by the desire that whatever he\nwas minded to command should be done. Valerius, on the other hand,\ncould afford to act humanely, because for him it was enough if all were\ndone which in a Roman army it was customary to do. And, since the\ncustoms of that army were good customs, they sufficed to gain him\nhonour, while at the same time their maintenance cost him no effort,\nnor threw on him the burthen of punishing transgressors; as well\nbecause there were none who trangressed, as because had there been any,\nthey would, as I have said, have imputed their punishment to the\nordinary rules of discipline, and not to the severity of their\ncommander. In this way Valerius had room to exercise that humane\ndisposition which enabled him at once to gain influence over his\nsoldiers and to content them. Hence it was that both these captains\nobtaining the same obedience, could, while following different methods,\narrive at the same ends. Those, however, who seek to imitate them may\nchance to fall into the errors of which I have already spoken, in\nconnection with Hannibal and Scipio, as breeding contempt or hatred,\nand which are only to be corrected by the presence of extraordinary\nvalour, and not otherwise.\nIt rests now to determine which of these two methods is the more to be\ncommended. This, I take it, is matter of dispute, since both methods\nhave their advocates. Those writers, however, who have laid down rules\nfor the conduct of princes, describe a character approaching more\nnearly to that of Valerius than to that of Manlius; and Xenophon, whom\nI have already cited, while giving many instances of the humanity of\nCyrus, conforms closely to what Livius tells us of Valerius. For\nValerius being made consul against the Samnites, on the eve of battle\nspoke to his men with the same kindliness with which he always treated\nthem; and Livius, after telling us what he said, remarks of him:\n\u201c_Never was there a leader more familiar with his men; cheerfully\nsharing with the meanest among them every hardship and fatigue. Even in\nthe military games, wherein those of the same rank were wont to make\ntrial of their strength or swiftness, he would good-naturedly take a\npart, nor disdain any adversary who offered; meeting victory or defeat\nwith an unruffled temper and an unchanged countenance. When called on\nto act, his bounty and generosity never fell short. When he had to\nspeak, he was as mindful of the feelings of others as of his own\ndignity. And, what more than anything else secures the popular favour,\nhe maintained when exercising his magistracies the same bearing he had\nworn in seeking them._\u201d\nOf Manlius also, Titus Livius speaks in like honourable terms, pointing\nout that his severity in putting his son to death brought the Roman\narmy to that pitch of discipline which enabled it to prevail against\nthe Latins, nay, he goes so far in his praises that after describing\nthe whole order of the battle, comparing the strength of both armies,\nand showing all the dangers the Romans ran, and the difficulties they\nhad to surmount, he winds up by saying, that it was the valour of\nManlius which alone gained for them this great victory, and that\nwhichever side had Manlius for its leader must have won the day. So\nthat weighing all that the historians tell us of these two captains, it\nmight be difficult to decide between them.\nNevertheless, not to leave the question entirely open, I say, that for\na citizen living under a republic, I think the conduct of Manlius more\ndeserving of praise and less dangerous in its consequences. For methods\nlike his tend only to the public good and in no way subserve private\nends. He who shows himself harsh and stern at all times and to all men\nalike, and is seen to care only for the common welfare, will never gain\nhimself partisans, since this is not the way to win personal friends,\nto whom, as I said before, the name of partisans is given. For a\nrepublic, therefore, no line of conduct could be more useful or more to\nbe desired than this, because in following it the public interest is\nnot neglected, and no room is given to suspect personal ambition.\nBut the contrary holds as to the methods followed by Valerius. For\nthough the public service they render be the same, misgivings must\nneeds arise that the personal good-will which, in the course of a\nprolonged command, a captain obtains from his soldiers, may lead to\nconsequences fatal to the public liberty. And if this was not found to\nhappen in the case of Valerius, it was because the minds of the Roman\npeople were not yet corrupted, and because they had never remained for\na long time and continuously under his command.\nHad we, however, like Xenophon, to consider what is most for the\ninterest of a prince, we should have to give up Manlius and hold by\nValerius; for, undoubtedly, a prince should strive to gain the love of\nhis soldiers and subjects, as well as their obedience. The latter he\ncan secure by discipline and by his reputation for valour. But for the\nformer he will be indebted to his affability, kindliness, gentleness,\nand all those other like qualities which were possessed by Valerius,\nand which are described by Xenophon as existing in Cyrus. That a prince\nshould be personally loved and have his army wholly devoted to him is\nconsistent with the character of his government; but that this should\nhappen to a person of private station does not consist with his\nposition as a citizen who has to live in conformity with the laws and\nin subordination to the magistrates. We read in the early annals of the\nVenetian Republic, that once, on the return of the fleet, a dispute\nbroke out between the sailors and the people, resulting in tumults and\narmed violence which neither the efforts of the public officers, the\nrespect felt for particular citizens, nor the authority of the\nmagistrates could quell. But on a certain gentleman, who the year\nbefore had been in command of these sailors, showing himself among\nthem, straightway, from the love they bore him, they submitted to his\nauthority and withdrew from the fray. Which deference on their part\naroused such jealousy and suspicion in the minds of the Venetian\nsenators that very soon after they got rid of this gentleman, either by\ndeath or exile.\nThe sum of the matter, therefore, is, that the methods followed by\nValerius are useful in a prince, but pernicious in a private citizen,\nboth for his country and for himself, for his country, because such\nmethods pave the way to a tyranny; for himself, because his\nfellow-citizens, growing suspicious of his conduct, are constrained to\nprotect themselves to his hurt. And conversely, I maintain, that the\nmethods of Manlius, while hurtful in a prince are useful in a citizen,\nand in the highest degree for his country; and, moreover, seldom give\noffence, unless the hatred caused by his severity be augmented by the\njealousy which the fame of his other virtues inspires: a matter now to\nbe considered in connection with the banishment of Camillas.\nCHAPTER XXIII.\u2014_Why Camillus was banished from Rome._\nIt has been shown above how methods like those of Valerius are hurtful\nto the citizen who employs them and to his country, while methods like\nthose of Manlius are advantageous for a man\u2019s country, though sometimes\nthey be hurtful to the man himself. This is well seen in the example of\nCamillus, whose bearing more nearly resembled that of Manlius than that\nof Valerius, so that Titus Livius, in speaking of him, says, \u201c_His\nvirtues were at once hated and admired by his soldiers._\u201d What gained\nhim their admiration was his care for their safety, his prudence, his\nmagnanimity, and the good order he maintained in conducting and\ncommanding them. What made him hated was his being more stern to punish\nthan bountiful to reward; and Livius instances the following\ncircumstances as giving rise to this hatred. First, his having applied\nthe money got by the sale of the goods of the Veientines to public\npurposes, and not divided it along with the rest of the spoils. Second,\nhis having, on the occasion of his triumph, caused his chariot to be\ndrawn by four white horses, seeking in his pride, men said, to make\nhimself the equal of the sun god. And, third, his having vowed to\nApollo a tenth of the Veientine plunder, which, if he was to fulfil his\nvow, he had to recover from his soldiers, into whose hands it had\nalready come.\nHerein we may well and readily discern what causes tend to make a\nprince hateful to his people; the chief whereof is the depriving them\nof some advantage. And this is a matter of much importance. For when a\nman is deprived of what is in itself useful, he never forgets it, and\nevery trifling occasion recalls it to his mind; and because such\noccasions recur daily, he is every day reminded of his loss. Another\nerror which we are here taught to guard against, is the appearing\nhaughty and proud, than which nothing is more distasteful to a people,\nand most of all to a free people; for although such pride and\nhaughtiness do them no hurt, they nevertheless hold in detestation any\nwho display these qualities. Every show of pride, therefore, a prince\nshould shun as he would a rock, since to invite hatred without\nresulting advantage were utterly rash and futile.\nCHAPTER XXIV.\u2014_That prolonged Commands brought Rome to Servitude_.\nIf we well examine the course of Roman history, we shall find two\ncauses leading to the break-up of that republic: one, the dissensions\nwhich arose in connection with the agrarian laws; the other, the\nprolongation of commands. For had these matters been rightly understood\nfrom the first, and due remedies applied, the freedom of Rome had been\nfar more lasting, and, possibly, less disturbed. And although, as\ntouching the prolongation of commands, we never find any tumult\nbreaking out in Rome on that account, we do in fact discern how much\nharm was done to the city by the ascendency which certain of its\ncitizens thereby gained. This mischief indeed would not have arisen, if\nother citizens whose period of office was extended had been as good and\nwise as Lucius Quintius, whose virtue affords a notable example. For\nterms of accord having been settled between the senate and commons of\nRome, the latter, thinking their tribunes well able to withstand the\nambition of the nobles, prolonged their authority for a year.\nWhereupon, the senate, not to be outdone by the commons, proposed, out\nof rivalry, to extend the consulship of Quintius. He, however, refused\nabsolutely to lend himself to their designs, and insisted on their\nappointing new consuls, telling them that they should seek to discredit\nevil examples, not add to them by setting worse. Had this prudence and\nvirtue of his been shared by all the citizens of Rome, the practice of\nprolonging the terms of civil offices would not have been suffered to\nestablish itself, nor have led to the kindred practice of extending the\nterm of military commands, which in progress of time effected the ruin\nof their republic.\nThe first military commander whose term was extended, was Publius\nPhilo; for when his consulship was about to expire, he being then\nengaged in the siege of Pal\u00e6opolis, the senate, seeing he had the\nvictory in his hands, would not displace him by a successor, but\nappointed him _Proconsul_, which office he was the first to hold. Now,\nalthough in thus acting the senate did what they thought best for the\npublic good, nevertheless it was this act of theirs that in time\nbrought Rome to slavery. For the further the Romans carried their arms,\nthe more necessary it seemed to them to grant similar extensions of\ncommand, and the oftener they, in fact, did so. This gave rise to two\ndisadvantages: first that a smaller number of men were trained to\ncommand; second, that by the long continuance of his command a captain\ngained so much influence and ascendency over his soldiers that in time\nthey came to hold the senate of no account, and looked only to him.\nThis it was, that enabled Sylla and Marius to find adherents ready to\nfollow them even to the public detriment, and enabled C\u00e6sar to\noverthrow the liberties of his country; whereas, had the Romans never\nprolonged the period of authority, whether civil or military, though\nthey might have taken longer to build up their empire, they certainly\nhad been later in incurring servitude.\nCHAPTER XXV.\u2014_Of the poverty of Cincinnatus and of many other Roman\nCitizens.\nElsewhere I have shown that no ordinance is of such advantage to a\ncommonwealth, as one which enforces poverty on its citizens. And\nalthough it does not appear what particular law it was that had this\noperation in Rome (especially since we know the agrarian law to have\nbeen stubbornly resisted), we find, as a fact, that four hundred years\nafter the city was founded, great poverty still prevailed there; and\nmay assume that nothing helped so much to produce this result as the\nknowledge that the path to honours and preferment was closed to none,\nand that merit was sought after wheresoever it was to be found; for\nthis manner of conferring honours made riches the less courted. In\nproof whereof I shall cite one instance only.\nWhen the consul Minutius was beset in his camp by the Equians, the\nRoman people were filled with such alarm lest their army should be\ndestroyed, that they appointed a dictator, always their last stay in\nseasons of peril. Their choice fell on Lucius Quintius Cincinnatus, who\nat the time was living on his small farm of little more than four\nacres, which he tilled with his own hand. The story is nobly told by\nTitus Livius where he says: \u201c_This is worth listening to by those who\ncontemn all things human as compared with riches, and think that glory\nand excellence can have no place unless accompanied by lavish wealth._\u201d\nCincinnatus, then, was ploughing in his little field, when there\narrived from Rome the messengers sent by the senate to tell him he had\nbeen made dictator, and inform him of the dangers which threatened the\nRepublic. Putting on his gown, he hastened to Rome, and getting\ntogether an army, marched to deliver Minutius. But when he had defeated\nand spoiled the enemy, and released Minutius, he would not suffer the\narmy he had rescued to participate in the spoils, saying, \u201c_I will not\nhave you share in the plunder of those to whom you had so nearly fallen\na prey._\u201d Minutius he deprived of his consulship, and reduced to be a\nsubaltern, in which rank he bade him remain till he had learned how to\ncommand. And before this he had made Lucius Tarquininus, although\nforced by his poverty to serve on foot, his master of the knights.\nHere, then, we see what honour was paid in Rome to poverty, and how\nfour acres of land sufficed to support so good and great a man as\nCincinnatus. We find the same Poverty still prevailing in the time of\nMarcus Regulus, who when serving with the army in Africa sought leave\nof senate to return home that he might look after his farm which his\nlabourers had suffered to run to waste. Here again we learn two things\nworthy our attention: first, the poverty of these men and their\ncontentment under it, and how their sole study was to gain renown from\nwar, leaving all its advantages to the State. For had they thought of\nenriching themselves by war, it had given them little concern that\ntheir fields were running to waste Further, we have to remark the\nmagnanimity of these citizens, who when placed at the head of armies\nsurpassed all princes in the loftiness of their spirit, who cared\nneither for king nor for commonwealth, and whom nothing could daunt or\ndismay; but who, on returning to private life, became once more so\nhumble, so frugal, so careful of their slender means, and so submissive\nto the magistrates and reverential to their superiors, that it might\nseem impossible for the human mind to undergo so violent a change.\nThis poverty prevailed down to the days of Paulus Emilius, almost the\nlast happy days for this republic wherein a citizen, while enriching\nRome by his triumphs, himself remained poor. And yet so greatly was\npoverty still esteemed at this time, that when Paulus, in conferring\nrewards on those who had behaved well in the war, presented his own\nson-in-law with a silver cup, it was the first vessel of silver ever\nseen in his house.\nI might run on to a great length pointing out how much better are the\nfruits of poverty than those of riches, and how poverty has brought\ncities, provinces, and nations to honour, while riches have wrought\ntheir ruin, had not this subject been often treated by others.\nCHAPTER XXVI.\u2014_How Women are a cause of the ruin of States._\nA feud broke out in Ardea touching the marriage of an heiress, whose\nhand was sought at the same time by two suitors, the one of plebeian,\nthe other of noble birth. For her father being dead, her guardian\nwished her to wed the plebeian, her mother the noble. And so hot grew\nthe dispute that resort was had to arms, the whole nobility siding with\ntheir fellow-noble, and all the plebeians with the plebeian. The latter\nfaction being worsted, left the town, and sent to the Volscians for\nhelp; whereupon, the nobles sought help from Rome. The Volscians were\nfirst in the field, and on their arrival encamped round Ardea. The\nRomans, coming up later, shut in the Volscians between themselves and\nthe town, and, reducing them by famine, forced them to surrender at\ndiscretion. They then entered Ardea, and putting all the ringleaders in\nthis dispute to the sword, composed the disorders of the city.\nIn connection with this affair there are several points to be noted.\nAnd in the first place we see how women have been the occasion of many\ndivisions and calamities in States, and have wrought great harm to\nrulers; as when, according to our historian, the violence done to\nLucretia drove the Tarquins from their kingdom, and that done to\nVirginia broke the power of the decemvirs. And among the chief causes\nwhich Aristotle assigns for the downfall of tyrants are the wrongs done\nby them to their subjects in respect of their women, whether by\nadultery, rape, or other like injury to their honour, as has been\nsufficiently noticed in the Chapter wherein we treated \u201c_of\nConspiracies_\u201d\nI say, then, that neither absolute princes nor the rulers of free\nStates should underrate the importance of matter, but take heed to the\ndisorders which it may breed and provide against them while remedies\ncan still be used without discredit to themselves or to their\ngovernments And this should have been done by the rulers of Ardea who\nby suffering the rivalry between their citizens to come to a head,\npromoted their divisions, and when they sought to reunite them had to\nsummon foreign help, than which nothing sooner leads to servitude.\nBut now let us turn to another subject which merits attention, namely,\nthe means whereby divided cities may be reunited; and of this I propose\nto speak in the following Chapter.\nCHAPTER XXVII.\u2014_How a divided City may be reunited, and how it is a\nfalse opinion that to hold Cities in subjection they must be kept\ndivided._\nFrom the example of the Roman consuls who reconciled the citizens of\nArdea, we are taught the method whereby the feuds of a divided city may\nbe composed, namely, by putting the ringleaders of the disturbances to\ndeath; and that no other remedy should be used. Three courses, indeed,\nare open to you, since you may either put to death, as these consuls\ndid, or banish, or bind the citizens to live at peace with one another,\ntaking security for their good behaviour. Of which three ways the last\nis the most hurtful, the most uncertain, and the least effectual;\nbecause when much blood has been shed, or other like outrage done, it\ncannot be that a peace imposed on compulsion should endure between men\nwho are every day brought face to face with one another; for since\nfresh cause of contention may at any moment result from their meeting,\nit will be impossible for them to refrain from mutual injury. Of this\nwe could have no better instance than in the city of Pistoja.\nFifteen years ago this city was divided between the Panciatichi and\nCancellieri, as indeed it still continues, the only difference being\nthat then they were in arms, whereas, now, they have laid them aside.\nAfter much controversy and wrangling, these factions would presently\nproceed to bloodshed, to pulling down houses, plundering property, and\nall the other violent courses usual in divided cities. The Florentines,\nwith whom it lay to compose these feuds, strove for a long time to do\nso by using the third of the methods mentioned; but when this only led\nto increased tumult and disorder, losing patience, they decided to try\nthe second method and get rid of the ringleaders of both factions by\nimprisoning some and banishing others. In this way a sort of settlement\nwas arrived at, which continues in operation up to the present hour.\nThere can be no question, however, that the first of the methods named\nwould have been the surest. But because extreme measures have in them\nan element of greatness and nobility, a weak republic, so far from\nknowing how to use this first method, can with difficulty be brought to\nemploy even the second. This, as I said at the beginning, is the kind\nof blunder made by the princes of our times when they have to decide on\nmatters of moment, from their not considering how those men acted who\nin ancient days had to determine under like conditions. For the\nweakness of the present race of men (the result of their enfeebling\neducation and their ignorance of affairs), makes them regard the\nmethods followed by the ancients as partly inhuman and partly\nimpracticable. Accordingly, they have their own newfangled ways of\nlooking at things, wholly at variance with the true, as when the sages\nof our city, some time since, pronounced that _Pistoja was to be held\nby feuds and Pisa by fortresses_, not perceiving how useless each of\nthese methods is in itself.\nHaving spoken of fortresses already at some length, I shall not further\nrefer to them here, but shall consider the futility of trying to hold\nsubject cities by keeping them divided. In the first place, it is\nimpossible for the ruling power, whether prince or republic, to be\nfriends with both factions. For wherever there is division, it is human\nnature to take a side, and to favour one party more than another. But\nif one party in a subject city be unfriendly to you, the consequence\nwill be that you will lose that city so soon as you are involved in\nwar, since it is impossible for you to hold a city where you have\nenemies both within and without. Should the ruling power be a republic,\nthere is nothing so likely to corrupt its citizens and sow dissension\namong them, as having to control a divided city. For as each faction in\nthat city will seek support and endeavour to make friends in a variety\nof corrupt ways, two very serious evils will result: first, that the\ngoverned city will never be contented with its governors, since there\ncan be no good government where you often change its form, adapting\nyourself to the humours now of one party and now of another; and next,\nthat the factious spirit of the subject city is certain to infect your\nown republic. To which Biondo testifies, when, in speaking of the\ncitizens of Florence and Pistoja, he says, \u201c_In seeking to unite\nPistoja the Florentines themselves fell out_.\u201d[15]\n[15] _Flav. Blondri Hist._, dec. ii. lib. 9. Basle ed. 1559, p. 337\nIt is easy, therefore, to understand how much mischief attends on such\ndivisions. In the year 1501, when we lost Arezzo, and when all the Val\ndi Tevere and Val di Chiana were occupied by the Vitelli and by Duke\nValentino, a certain M. de Lant was sent by the King of France to cause\nthe whole of the lost towns to be restored to the Florentines; who\nfinding in all these towns men who came to him claiming to be of the\nparty of the _Marzocco_,[16] greatly blamed this distinction,\nobserving, that if in France any of the king\u2019s subjects were to say\nthat he was of the king\u2019s party, he would be punished; since the\nexpression would imply that there was a party hostile to the king,\nwhereas it was his majesty\u2019s desire that all his subjects should be his\nfriends and live united without any distinction of party. But all these\nmistaken methods and opinions originate in the weakness of rulers, who,\nseeing that they cannot hold their States by their own strength and\nvalour, have recourse to like devices; which, if now and then in\ntranquil times they prove of some slight assistance to them, in times\nof danger are shown to be worthless.\n[16] The heraldic Lion of Florence.\nCHAPTER XXVIII.\u2014_That a Republic must keep an eye on what its Citizens\nare about; since often the seeds of a Tyranny lie hidden under a\nsemblance of generous deeds._\nThe granaries of Rome not sufficing to meet a famine with which the\ncity was visited, a certain Spurius Melius, a very wealthy citizen for\nthese days, privately laid in a supply of corn wherewith to feed the\npeople at his own expense; gaining thereby such general favour with the\ncommons, that the senate, apprehending that his bounty might have\ndangerous consequences, in order to crush him before he grew too\npowerful, appointed a dictator to deal with him and caused him to be\nput to death.\nHere we have to note that actions which seem good in themselves and\nunlikely to occasion harm to any one, very often become hurtful, nay,\nunless corrected in time, most dangerous for a republic. And to treat\nthe matter with greater fulness, I say, that while a republic can never\nmaintain itself long, or manage its affairs to advantage, without\ncitizens of good reputation, on the other hand the credit enjoyed by\nparticular citizens often leads to the establishment of a tyranny. For\nwhich reasons, and that things may take a safe course, it should be so\narranged that a citizen shall have credit only for such behaviour as\nbenefits, and not for such as injures the State and its liberties. We\nmust therefore examine by what ways credit is acquired. These, briefly,\nare two, public or secret. Public, when a citizen gains a great name by\nadvising well or by acting still better for the common advantage. To\ncredit of this sort we should open a wide door, holding out rewards\nboth for good counsels and for good actions, so that he who renders\nsuch services may be at once honoured and satisfied. Reputation\nacquired honestly and openly by such means as these can never be\ndangerous. But credit acquired by secret practices, which is the other\nmethod spoken of, is most perilous and prejudicial. Of such secret\npractices may be instanced, acts of kindness done to this or the other\ncitizen in lending him money, in assisting him to marry his daughters,\nin defending him against the magistrates, and in conferring such other\nprivate favours as gain men devoted adherents, and encourage them after\nthey have obtained such support, to corrupt the institutions of the\nState and to violate its laws.\nA well-governed republic, therefore, ought, as I have said, to throw\nwide the door to all who seek public favour by open courses, and to\nclose it against any who would ingratiate themselves by underhand\nmeans. And this we find was done in Rome. For the Roman republic, as a\nreward to any citizen who served it well, ordained triumphs and all the\nother honours which it had to bestow; while against those who sought to\naggrandize themselves by secret intrigues, it ordained accusations and\nimpeachment; and when, from the people being blinded by a false show of\nbenevolence, these proved insufficient, it provided for a dictator, who\nwith regal authority might bring to bounds any who had strayed beyond\nthem, as instanced in the case of Spurius Melius. And if conduct like\nhis be ever suffered to pass unchastised, it may well be the ruin of a\nrepublic, for men when they have such examples set them are not easily\nled back into the right path.\nCHAPTER XXIX.\u2014_That the Faults of a People are due to its Prince._\nLet no prince complain of the faults committed by a people under his\ncontrol; since these must be ascribed either to his negligence, or to\nhis being himself blemished by similar defects. And were any one to\nconsider what peoples in our own times have been most given to robbery\nand other like offences, he would find that they have only copied their\nrulers, who have themselves been of a like nature. Romagna, before\nthose lords who ruled it were driven out by Pope Alexander VI., was a\nnursery of all the worst crimes, the slightest occasion giving rise to\nwholesale rapine and murder. This resulted from the wickedness of these\nlords, and not, as they asserted, from the evil disposition of their\nsubjects. For these princes being poor, yet choosing to live as though\nthey were rich, were forced to resort to cruelties innumerable and\npractised in divers ways; and among other shameful devices contrived by\nthem to extort money, they would pass laws prohibiting certain acts,\nand then be the first to give occasion for breaking them; nor would\nthey chastise offenders until they saw many involved in the same\noffence; when they fell to punishing, not from any zeal for the laws\nwhich they had made, but out of greed to realize the penalty. Whence\nflowed many mischiefs, and more particularly this, that the people\nbeing impoverished, but not corrected, sought to make good their\ninjuries at the expense of others weaker than themselves. And thus\nthere sprang up all those evils spoken of above, whereof the prince is\nthe true cause.\nThe truth of what I say is confirmed by Titus Livius where he relates\nhow the Roman envoys, who were conveying the spoils of the Veientines\nas an offering to Apollo, were seized and brought on shore by the\ncorsairs of the Lipari islands in Sicily; when Timasitheus, the prince\nof these islands, on learning the nature of the offering, its\ndestination, and by whom sent, though himself of Lipari, behaved as a\nRoman might, showing his people what sacrilege it would be to intercept\nsuch a gift, and speaking to such purpose that by general consent the\nenvoys were suffered to proceed upon their voyage, taking all their\npossessions with them. With reference to which incident the historian\nobserves: \u201c_The multitude, who always take their colour from their\nruler, were filled by Timasitheus with a religious awe._\u201d And to like\npurport we find it said by Lorenzo de\u2019 Medici:\u2014\n\u201cA prince\u2019s acts his people imitate;\nFor on their lord the eyes of all men wait.\u201d[17]\n[17] E quel che fa il signer, fanno poi molti;\nCh\u00e8 nel signer son tutti gli occhi volti.\n(_La Rappresentazione di San Giovanni e Paolo._)\nCHAPTER XXX.\u2014_That a Citizen who seeks by his personal influence to\nrender signal service to his Country, must first stand clear of Envy.\nHow a City should prepare for its defence on the approach of an Enemy._\nWhen the Roman senate learned that all Etruria was assembled in arms to\nmarch against Rome, and that the Latins and Hernicians, who before had\nbeen the friends of the Romans, had ranged themselves with the\nVolscians the ancient enemies of the Roman name, they foresaw that a\nperilous contest awaited them. But because Camillus was at that time\ntribune with consular authority they thought all might be managed\nwithout the appointment of a dictator, provided the other tribunes, his\ncolleagues would agree to his assuming the sole direction of affairs.\nThis they willingly did; \u201c_nor_,\u201d says Titus Livius, \u201c_did they account\nanything as taken from their own dignity which was added to his._\u201d\nOn receiving their promise of obedience, Camillus gave orders that\nthree armies should be enrolled. Of the first, which was to be directed\nagainst the Etruscans, he himself assumed command. The command of the\nsecond, which he meant to remain near Rome and meet any movement of the\nLatins and Hernicians, he gave to Quintius Servilius. The third army,\nwhich he designed for the protection of the city, and the defence of\nthe gates and Curia, he entrusted to Lucius Quintius. And he further\ndirected, that Horatius, one of his colleagues, should furnish supplies\nof arms, and corn, and of all else needful in time of war. Finally he\nput forward his colleague Cornelius to preside in the senate and public\ncouncil, that from day to day he might advise what should be done. For\nin those times these tribunes were ready either to command or obey as\nthe welfare of their country might require.\nWe may gather from this passage how a brave and prudent man should act,\nhow much good he may effect, and how serviceable he may be to his\ncountry, when by the force of his character and worth he succeeds in\nextinguishing envy. For this often disables men from acting to the best\nadvantage, not permitting them to obtain that authority which it is\nessential they should have in matters of importance. Now, envy may be\nextinguished in one or other of two ways: first, by the approach of\nsome flagrant danger, whereby seeing themselves like to be overwhelmed,\nall forego their own private ambition and lend a willing obedience to\nhim who counts on his valour to rescue them. As in the case of\nCamillas, who from having given many proofs of surpassing ability, and\nfrom having been three times dictator and always exercised the office\nfor the public good and not for his private advantage, had brought men\nto fear nothing from his advancement; while his fame and reputation\nmade it no shame for them to recognize him as their superior. Wisely,\ntherefore, does Titus Livius use concerning him the words which I have\ncited.\nThe other way in which envy may be extinguished, is by the death,\nwhether by violence or in the ordinary course of nature, of those who\nhave been your rivals in the pursuit of fame or power, and who seeing\nyou better esteemed than themselves, could never acquiesce in your\nsuperiority or put up with it in patience. For when these men have been\nbrought up in a corrupt city, where their training is little likely to\nimprove them, nothing that can happen will induce them to withdraw\ntheir pretensions; nay, to have their own way and satisfy their\nperverse humour, they will be content to look on while their country is\nruined. For envy such as this there is no cure save by the death of\nthose of whom it has taken possession. And when fortune so befriends a\ngreat man that his rivals are removed from his path by a natural death,\nhis glory is established without scandal or offence, since he is then\nable to display his great qualities unhindered. But when fortune is not\nthus propitious to him, he must contrive other means to rid himself of\nrivals, and must do so successfully before he can accomplish anything.\nAny one who reads with intelligence the lessons of Holy Writ, will\nremember how Moses, to give effect to his laws and ordinances, was\nconstrained to put to death an endless number of those who out of mere\nenvy withstood his designs. The necessity of this course was well\nunderstood by the Friar Girolamo Savonarola, and by the Gonfalonier\nPiero Soderini. But the former could not comply with it, because, as a\nfriar, he himself lacked the needful authority; while those of his\nfollowers who might have exercised that authority, did not rightly\ncomprehend his teaching. This, however, was no fault of his; for his\nsermons are full of invectives and attacks against \u201c_the wise of this\nworld_,\u201d that being the name he gave to envious rivals and to all who\nopposed his reforms. As for Piero Soderini, he was possessed by the\nbelief that in time and with favourable fortune he could allay envy by\ngentleness-and by benefits conferred on particular men; for as he was\nstill in the prime of life, and in the fresh enjoyment of that\ngood-will which his character and opinions had gained for him, he\nthought to get the better of all who out of jealousy opposed him,\nwithout giving occasion for tumult, violence, or disorder; not knowing\nhow time stays not, worth suffices not, fortune shifts, and malice will\nnot be won over by any benefit Wherefore, because they could not or\nknew not how to vanquish this envy, the two whom I have named came to\ntheir downfall.\nAnother point to be noted in the passage we are considering, is the\ncareful provision made by Camillus for the safety of Rome both within\nand without the city. And, truly, not without reason do wise\nhistorians, like our author, set forth certain events with much\nminuteness and detail, to the end that those who come after may learn\nhow to protect themselves in like dangers. Further, we have to note\nthat there is no more hazardous or less useful defence than one\nconducted without method or system. This is shown in Camillus causing a\nthird army to be enrolled that it might be left in Rome for the\nprotection of the city. Many persons, doubtless, both then and now,\nwould esteem this precaution superfluous, thinking that as the Romans\nwere a warlike people and constantly under arms, there could be no\noccasion for a special levy, and that it was time enough to arm when\nthe need came. But Camillus, and any other equally prudent captain\nwould be of the same mind, judged otherwise, not permitting the\nmultitude to take up arms unless they were to be bound by the rules and\ndiscipline of military service. Let him, therefore, who is called on to\ndefend a city, taking example by Camillus, before all things avoid\nplacing arms in the hands of an undisciplined multitude, but first of\nall select and enroll those whom he proposes to arm, so that they may\nbe wholly governed by him as to where they shall assemble and whither\nthey shall march; and then let him direct those who are not enrolled,\nto abide every man in his own house for its defence. Whosoever observes\nthis method in a city which is attacked, will be able to defend it with\nease; but whosoever disregards it, and follows not the example of\nCamillus, shall never succeed.\nCHAPTER XXXI.\u2014_That strong Republics and valiant Men preserve through\nevery change the same Spirit and Bearing._\nAmong other high sayings which our historian ascribes to Camillus, as\nshowing of what stuff a truly great man should be made, he puts in his\nmouth the words, \u201c_My courage came not with my dictatorship nor went\nwith my exile;_\u201d for by these words we are taught that a great man is\nconstantly the same through all vicissitudes of Fortune; so that\nalthough she change, now exalting, now depressing, he remains\nunchanged, and retains always a mind so unmoved, and in such complete\naccordance with his nature as declares to all that over him Fortune has\nno dominion.\nVery different is the behaviour of those weak-minded mortals who,\npuffed up and intoxicated with their success, ascribe all their\nfelicity to virtues which they never knew, and thus grow hateful and\ninsupportable to all around them. Whence also the changes in their\nfortunes. For whenever they have to look adversity in the face, they\nsuddenly pass to the other extreme, becoming abject and base. And thus\nit happens that feeble-minded princes, when they fall into\ndifficulties, think rather of flight than of defence, because, having\nmade bad use of their prosperity, they are wholly unprepared to defend\nthemselves.\nThe same merits and defects which I say are found in individual men,\nare likewise found in republics, whereof we have example in the case of\nRome and of Venice. For no reverse of fortune ever broke the spirit of\nthe Roman people, nor did any success ever unduly elate them; as we see\nplainly after their defeat at Cann\u00e6, and after the victory they had\nover Antiochus. For the defeat at Cann\u00e6, although most momentous, being\nthe third they had met with, no whit daunted them; so that they\ncontinued to send forth armies, refused to ransom prisoners as contrary\nto their custom, and despatched no envoy to Hannibal or to Carthage to\nsue for peace; but without ever looking back on past humiliations,\nthought always of war, though in such straits for soldiers that they\nhad to arm their old men and slaves. Which facts being made known to\nHanno the Carthaginian, he, as I have already related, warned the\nCarthaginian senate not to lay too much stress upon their victory.\nHere, therefore, we see that in times of adversity the Romans were\nneither cast down nor dismayed. On the other hand, no prosperity ever\nmade them arrogant. Before fighting the battle wherein he was finally\nrouted, Antiochus sent messengers to Scipio to treat for an accord;\nwhen Scipio offered peace on condition that he withdrew at once into\nSyria, leaving all his other dominions to be dealt with by the Romans\nas they thought fit. Antiochus refusing these terms, fought and was\ndefeated, and again sent envoys to Scipio, enjoining them to accept\nwhatever conditions the victor might be pleased to impose. But Scipio\nproposed no different terms from those he had offered before saying\nthat \u201c_the Romans, as they lost not heart on defeat, so waxed not\ninsolent with success._\u201d\nThe contrary of all this is seen in the behaviour of the Venetians, who\nthinking their good fortune due to valour of which they were devoid, in\ntheir pride addressed the French king as \u201cSon of St. Mark;\u201d and making\nno account of the Church, and no longer restricting their ambition to\nthe limits of Italy, came to dream of founding an empire like the\nRoman. But afterwards, when their good fortune deserted them, and they\nmet at Vail\u00e0 a half-defeat at the hands of the French king, they lost\ntheir whole dominions, not altogether from revolt, but mainly by a base\nand abject surrender to the Pope and the King of Spain. Nay, so low did\nthey stoop as to send ambassadors to the Emperor offering to become his\ntributaries, and to write letters to the Pope, full of submission and\nservility, in order to move his compassion. To such abasement were they\nbrought in four days\u2019 time by what was in reality only a half-defeat.\nFor on their flight after the battle of Vail\u00e0 only about a half of\ntheir forces were engaged, and one of their two provedditori escaped to\nVerona with five and twenty thousand men, horse and foot. So that had\nthere been a spark of valour in Venice, or any soundness in her\nmilitary system, she might easily have renewed her armies, and again\nconfronting fortune have stood prepared either to conquer, or, if she\nmust fall, to fall more gloriously; and at any rate might have obtained\nfor herself more honourable terms. But a pusillanimous spirit,\noccasioned by the defects of her ordinances in so far as they relate to\nwar, caused her to lose at once her courage and her dominions. And so\nwill it always happen with those who behave like the Venetians. For\nwhen men grow insolent in good fortune, and abject inn evil, the fault\nlies in themselves and in the character of their training, which, when\nslight and frivolous, assimilates them to itself; but when otherwise,\nmakes them of another temper, and giving them better acquaintance with\nthe world, causes them to be less disheartened by misfortunes and less\nelated by success.\nAnd while this is true of individual men, it holds good also of a\nconcourse of men living together in one republic, who will arrive at\nthat measure of perfection which the institutions of their State\npermit. And although I have already said on another occasion that a\ngood militia is the foundation of all States, and where that is wanting\nthere can neither be good laws, nor aught else that is good, it seems\nto me not superfluous to say the same again; because in reading this\nhistory of Titus Livius the necessity of such a foundation is made\napparent in every page. It is likewise shown that no army can be good\nunless it be thoroughly trained and exercised, and that this can only\nbe the case with an army raised from your own subjects. For as a State\nis not and cannot always be at war, you must have opportunity to train\nyour army in times of peace; but this, having regard to the cost, you\ncan only have in respect of your own subjects.\nWhen Camillus, as already related, went forth to meet the Etruscans,\nhis soldiers on seeing the great army of their enemy, were filled with\nfear, thinking themselves too to withstand its onset. This untoward\ndisposition being reported to Camillus, he showed himself to his men\nand by visiting their tents, and conversing with this and the other\namong them, was able to remove their misgivings; and, finally, without\nother word of command, he bade them \u201c_each do his part as he had\nlearned and been accustomed_.\u201d Now, any one who well considers the\nmethods followed by Camillus, and the words spoken by him to encourage\nhis soldiers to face their enemy, will perceive that these words and\nmethods could never have been used with an army which had not been\ntrained and disciplined in time of peace as well as of war. For no\ncaptain can trust to untrained soldiers or look for good service at\ntheir hands; nay, though he were another Hannibal, with such troops his\ndefeat were certain. For, as a captain cannot be present everywhere\nwhile a battle is being fought, unless he have taken all measures\nbeforehand to render his men of the same temper as himself, and have\nmade sure that they perfectly understand his orders and arrangements,\nhe will inevitably be destroyed.\nWhen a city therefore is armed and trained as Rome was, and when its\ncitizens have daily opportunity, both singly and together, to make\ntrial of their valour and learn what fortune can effect, it will always\nhappen, that at all times, and whether circumstances be adverse or\nfavourable, they will remain of unaltered courage and preserve the same\nnoble bearing. But when its citizens are unpractised in arms, and trust\nnot to their own valour but wholly to the arbitration of Fortune, they\nwill change their temper as she changes, and offer always the same\nexample of behaviour as was given by the Venetians.\nCHAPTER XXXII.\u2014_Of the methods which some have used to make Peace\nimpossible_.\nThe towns of C\u00e6re and Velitr\u00e6, two of her own colonies, revolted from\nRome in expectation of being protected by the Latins. But the Latins\nbeing routed and all hopes of help from that quarter at an end, many of\nthe townsmen recommended that envoys should be sent to Rome to make\ntheir peace with the senate. This proposal, however, was defeated by\nthose who had been the prime movers of the revolt, who, fearing that\nthe whole punishment might fall on their heads, to put a stop to any\ntalk of an adjustment, incited the multitude to take up arms and make a\nforay into the Roman territory.\nAnd, in truth, when it is desired that a prince or people should banish\nfrom their minds every thought of reconciliation, there is no surer or\nmore effectual plan than to incite them to inflict grave wrong on him\nwith whom you would not have them be reconciled; for, then, the fear of\nthat punishment which they will seem to themselves to have deserved,\nwill always keep them apart. At the close of the first war waged by the\nRomans against Carthage, the soldiers who had served under the\nCarthaginians in Sardinia and Sicily, upon peace being proclaimed,\nreturned to Africa; where, being dissatisfied with their pay, they\nmutinied against the Carthaginians, and choosing two of their number,\nMato and Spendio, to be their leaders, seized and sacked many towns\nsubject to Carthage. The Carthaginians, being loath to use force until\nthey had tried all other methods for bringing them to reason, sent\nHasdrubal, their fellow-citizen, to mediate with them, thinking that\nfrom formerly having commanded them he might be able to exercise some\ninfluence over them. But on his arrival, Spendio and Mato, to\nextinguish any hope these mutineers might have had of making peace with\nCarthage, and so leave them no alternative but war, persuaded them that\ntheir best course was to put Hasdrubal, with all the other Carthaginian\ncitizens whom they had taken prisoners, to death. Whereupon, they not\nonly put them to death, but first subjected them to an infinity of\ntortures; crowning their wickedness by a proclamation to the effect\nthat every Carthaginian who might thereafter fall into their hands\nshould meet a like fate. This advice, therefore, and its consummation\nhad the effect of rendering these mutineers relentless and inveterate\nin their hostility to the Carthaginians.\nCHAPTER XXXIII.\u2014_That to insure victory in battle you must inspire your\nMen with confidence in one another and in you._\nTo insure an army being victorious in battle you must inspire it with\nthe conviction that it is certain to prevail. The causes which give it\nthis confidence are its being well armed and disciplined, and the\nsoldiers knowing one another. These conditions are only to be found\nunited in soldiers born and bred in the same country.\nIt is likewise essential that the army should think so well of its\ncaptain as to trust implicitly to his prudence; which it will always do\nif it see him careful of its welfare, attentive to discipline, brave in\nbattle, and otherwise supporting well and honourably the dignity of his\nposition. These conditions he fulfils when, while punishing faults, he\ndoes not needlessly harass his men, keeps his word with them, shows\nthem that the path to victory is easy, and conceals from them, or makes\nlight of things which seen from a distance might appear to threaten\ndanger. The observance of these precautions will give an army great\nconfidence, and such confidence leads to victory.\nThis confidence the Romans were wont to inspire in the minds of their\nsoldiers by the aid of religion; and accordingly their consuls were\nappointed, their armies were enrolled, their soldiers marched forth,\nand their battles were begun, only when the auguries and auspices were\nfavourable; and without attending to all these observances no prudent\ncaptain would ever engage in combat; knowing that unless his soldiers\nwere first assured that the gods were on their side, he might readily\nsuffer defeat. But if any consul or other leader ever joined battle\ncontrary to the auspices, the Romans would punish him, as they did\nClaudius Pulcher.\nThe truth of what I affirm is plainly seen from the whole course of the\nRoman history, but is more particularly established by the words which\nLivius puts into the mouth of Appius Claudius, who, when complaining to\nthe people of the insolence of the tribunes, and taxing them with\nhaving caused the corruption of the auspices and other rites of\nreligion, is made to say, \u201c_And now they would strip even religion of\nits authority. For what matters it, they will tell you, that the fowls\nrefuse to peck, or come slowly from the coop, or that a cock has\ncrowed? These are small matters doubtless; but it was by not contemning\nsuch small matters as these, that our forefathers built up this great\nrepublic._\u201d And, indeed, in these small matters lies a power which\nkeeps men united and of good courage, which is of itself the chief\ncondition of success.\nBut the observances of religion must be accompanied by valour, for\notherwise they can nothing avail. The men of Praneste, leading forth\ntheir army against the Romans, took up their position near the river\nAllia, on the very spot where the Romans had been routed by the Gauls,\nselecting this ground that it might inspire their own side with\nconfidence, and dishearten their enemies with the unhappy memories\nwhich it recalled But although, for the reasons already noted, this was\na course which promised success, the result nevertheless showed that\ntrue valour is not to be daunted by trifling disadvantages. And this\nthe historian well expresses by the words he puts in the mouth of the\ndictator as spoken to his master of the knights \u201c_See how these\nfellows, in encamping on the banks of the Allia, have chosen their\nground in reliance upon fortune. Do you, therefore, relying on\ndiscipline and valour, fall upon then centre._\u201d For true valour, tight\ndiscipline, and the feeling of security gained by repeated victories,\nare not to be counteracted by things of no real moment, dismayed by\nempty terrors, or quelled by a solitary mishap. As was well seen when\nthe two Manlii, being consuls in command against the Volscians, rashly\nallowed a part of their army to go out foraging, and both those who\nwent out and those who stayed behind found themselves attacked at the\nsame moment For from this danger they were saved by the courage of the\nsoldiers, and not by the foresight of the consuls. With regard to which\noccurrence Titus Livius observes, \u201c_Even without a leader the steadfast\nvalour of the soldiers was maintained._\u201d\nHere I must not omit to notice the device practised by Fabius to give\nhis army confidence, when he led it for the first time into Etruria.\nFor judging such encouragement to be especially needed by his men,\nsince they were entering an unknown country to encounter a new foe, he\naddressed them before they joined battle, and, after reciting many\nreasons for expecting a victory, told them, that \u201c_he could have\nmentioned other favourable circumstances making victory certain, had it\nnot been dangerous to disclose them._\u201d And as this device was\ndexterously used it merits imitation.\nCHAPTER XXXIV.\u2014_By what reports, rumours, or surmises the Citizens of a\nRepublic are led to favour a Fellow-citizen: and-whether the\nMagistracies are bestowed with better judgment by a People or by a\nPrince._\nI have elsewhere related how Titus Manlius, afterwards named Torquatus,\nrescued his father from the charge laid against him by Marcus\nPomponius, tribune of the people. And though the means he took to\neffect this were somewhat violent and irregular, so pleasing to\neveryone were his filial piety and affection, that not only did he\nescape rebuke, but when military tribunes had to be appointed his name\nwas second on the list of those chosen. To explain his good fortune, it\nwill, I think, be useful to consider what are the methods followed by\nthe citizens of a republic in estimating the character of those on whom\nthey bestow honours, so as to see whether what I have already said on\nthis head be true, namely, that a people is more discriminating in\nawarding honours than a prince.\nI say, then, that in conferring honours and offices, the people, when\nit has no knowledge of a man from his public career, follows the\nestimate given of him by the general voice, and by common report; or\nelse is guided by some prepossession or preconceived opinion which it\nhas adopted concerning him. Such impressions are formed either from\nconsideration of a man\u2019s descent (it being assumed, until the contrary\nappears, that where his ancestors have been great and distinguished\ncitizens their descendant will resemble them), or else from regard to\nhis manners and habits; and nothing can be more in his favour than that\nhe frequents the company of the grave and virtuous, and such as are\ngenerally reputed wise. For as we can have no better clue to a man\u2019s\ncharacter than the company he keeps, he who frequents worthy company\ndeservedly obtains a good name, since there can hardly fail to be some\nsimilarity between himself and his associates. Sometimes, however, the\npopular estimate of a man is founded on some remarkable and noteworthy\naction, though not of public moment, in which he has acquitted himself\nwell. And of all the three causes which create a prepossession in a\nman\u2019s favour, none is so effectual as this last. For the presumption\nthat he will resemble his ancestors and kinsmen is so often misleading,\nthat men are slow to trust and quick to discard it, unless confirmed by\nthe personal worth of him of whom they are judging.\nThe criterion of character afforded by a man\u2019s manners and conversation\nis a safer guide than the presumption of inherited excellence, but is\nfar inferior to that afforded by his actions; for until he has given\nactual proof of his worth, his credit is built on mere opinion, which\nmay readily change. But this third mode of judging, which originates in\nand rests upon his actions, at once gives him a name which can only be\ndestroyed by his afterwards doing many actions of a contrary nature.\nThose therefore who live in a republic should conform to this third\ncriterion, and endeavour, as did many of the Roman youth, to make their\nstart in life with some extraordinary achievement, either by promoting\na law conducive to the general well-being, or by accusing some powerful\ncitizen as a transgressor of the laws, or by performing some similar\nnew and notable action which cannot fail to be much spoken of.\nActions like this are necessary not only to lay a foundation for your\nfame, but also to maintain and extend it. To which end, they must\ncontinually be renewed, as we find done by Titus Manlius throughout the\nwhole course of his life. For after winning his earliest renown by his\nbold and singular defence of his father, when some years had passed he\nfought his famous duel with the Gaul, from whom, when he had slain him,\nhe took the twisted golden collar which gave him the name of Torquatus.\nNor was this the last of his remarkable actions, for at a later period,\nwhen he was of ripe years, he caused his own son to be put to death,\nbecause he had fought without leave, although successfully. Which three\nactions gained for him at the time a greater name, and have made him\nmore renowned through after ages than all his triumphs and victories,\nthough of these he had as large a share as fell to the lot of any other\nRoman. The explanation of which is, that while in his victories Manlius\nhad many who resembled him, in these particular actions he stood almost\nor entirely alone.\nSo, too, with the elder Scipio, all whose victories together did not\nobtain for him so much reputation, as did his rescue, while he was yet\nyoung, of his father at the Ticino, and his undaunted bearing after the\nrout at Cann\u00e6, when with his naked sword he constrained a number of the\nRoman youth to swear never to abandon their country, as some among them\nhad before been minded to do. It was these two actions, therefore,\nwhich laid the foundation of his future fame and paved the way for his\ntriumphs in Spain and Africa. And the fair esteem in which men held\nhim, was still further heightened when in Spain he restored a daughter\nto her father, a wife to her husband.\nNor is it only the citizen who seeks reputation as leading to civil\nhonours, who must act in this way; the prince who would maintain his\ncredit in his princedom must do likewise; since nothing helps so much\nto make a prince esteemed as to give signal proofs of his worth,\nwhether by words or by deeds which tend to promote the public good, and\nshow him to be so magnanimous, generous, and just, that he may well\npass into a proverb among his subjects. But to return to the point\nwhence I digressed, I say that if a people, when they first confer\nhonours on a fellow-citizen, rest their judgment on any one of the\nthree circumstances above-mentioned, they build on a reasonable\nfoundation; but, when many instances of noble conduct have made a man\nfavourably known, that the foundation is still better, since then there\nis hardly room for mistake. I speak merely of those honours which are\nbestowed on a man at the outset of his career, before he has come to be\nknown by continued proof, or is found to have passed from one kind of\nconduct to another and dissimilar kind, and I maintain that in such\ncases, so far as erroneous judgments or corrupt motives are concerned,\na people will always commit fewer mistakes than a prince.\nBut since a people may happen to be deceived as regards the character,\nreputation, and actions of a man, thinking them better or greater than\nin truth they are, an error a prince is less likely to fall into from\nhis being informed and warned by his advisers, in order that the people\nmay not lack similar advice, wise founders of republics have provided,\nthat when the highest dignities of the State, to which it would be\ndangerous to appoint incapable men, have to be filled up, and it\nappears that some incapable man is the object of the popular choice, it\nshall be lawful and accounted honourable for any citizen to declare in\nthe public assemblies the defects of the favoured candidate, that the\npeople, being made acquainted therewith, may be better able to judge of\nhis fitness. That this was the practice in Rome we have proof in the\nspeech made by Fabius Maximus to the people during the second Punic\nwar, when in the appointment of consuls public favour leaned towards\nTitus Ottacilius. For Fabius judging him unequal to the duties of the\nconsulship at such a crisis, spoke against him and pointed out his\ninsufficiency, and so prevented his appointment, turning the popular\nfavour towards another who deserved it more.\nIn the choice of its magistrates, therefore, a people judges of those\namong whom it has to choose, in accordance with the surest indications\nit can get; and when it can be advised as princes are, makes fewer\nmistakes than they. But the citizen who would make a beginning by\ngaining the good-will of the people, must, to obtain it, perform, like\nTitus Manlius, some noteworthy action.\nCHAPTER XXXV.\u2014_Of the Danger incurred in being the first to recommend\nnew Measures; and that the more unusual the Measures the greater the\nDanger_.\nHow perilous a thing it is to put one\u2019s self at the head of changes\nwhereby many are affected, how difficult to guide and bring them to\nperfection, and when perfected to maintain them, were too wide and\narduous a subject to be treated here. Wherefore I reserve it for a\nfitter occasion, and shall now speak only of those dangers which are\nincurred by the citizens of a republic or by the counsellors of a\nprince in being the first to promote some grave and important measure\nin such manner that the whole responsibility attending it rests with\nthem. For as men judge of things by their results, any evil which\nensues from such measures will be imputed to their author. And although\nif good ensue he will be applauded, nevertheless in matters of this\nkind, what a man may gain is as nothing to what he may lose.\nSelim, the present sultan, or Grand Turk as he is called, being in\nreadiness, as some who come from his country relate, to set forth on an\nexpedition against Egypt and Syria, was urged by one of his bashaws\nwhom he had stationed on the confines of Persia, to make war upon the\nSofi. In compliance with which advice he went on this new enterprise\nwith a vast army. But coming to a great plain, wherein were many\ndeserts and few streams, and encountering the same difficulties as in\nancient times had proved the ruin of many Roman armies, he suffered so\nmuch from pestilence and famine, that, although victorious in battle,\nhe lost a great part of his men. This so enraged him against the bashaw\non whose advice he had acted, that he forthwith put him to death.\nIn like manner, we read of many citizens who having strenuously\npromoted various measures were banished when these turned out badly.\nCertain citizens of Rome, for instance, were very active in forwarding\na law allowing the appointment of a plebeian to be consul. This law\npassing, it so happened that the first plebeian consul who went forth\nwith the armies was routed; and had it not been that the party in whose\nbehalf the law was made was extremely powerful, its promoters would\nhave fared badly. It is plain therefore that the counsellors whether of\na republic or of a prince stand in this dilemma, that if they do not\nconscientiously advise whatsoever they think advantageous for their\ncity or prince, they fail in their duty; if they do advise it, they\nrisk their places and their lives; all men being subject to this\ninfirmity of judging advice by the event.\nWhen I consider in what way this reproach or this danger may best be\nescaped, I find no other remedy to recommend than that in giving advice\nyou proceed discreetly not identifying yourself in a special manner\nwith the measure you would see carried out, but offering your opinion\nwithout heat, and supporting it temperately and modestly, so that if\nthe prince or city follow it, they shall do so of their own good-will,\nand not seem to be dragged into it by your importunity. When you act\nthus, neither prince nor people can reasonably bear you a grudge in\nrespect of the advice given by you, since that advice was not adopted\ncontrary to the general opinion. For your danger lies in many having\nopposed you, who afterwards, should your advice prove hurtful, combine\nto ruin you. And although in taking this course you fall short of the\nglory which is earned by him who stands alone against many in urging\nsome measure which succeeds, you have nevertheless two advantages to\nmake up for it: first, that you escape danger; and second, that when\nyou have temperately stated your views, and when, in consequence of\nopposition, your advice has not been taken, should other counsels\nprevail and mischief come of them, your credit will be vastly enhanced.\nAnd although credit gained at the cost of misfortune to your prince or\ncity cannot be matter of rejoicing, still it is something to be taken\ninto account.\nOn this head, then, I know of no other advice to offer. For that you\nshould be silent and express no opinion at all, were a course hurtful\nfor your prince or city, and which would not absolve you from danger,\nsince you would soon grow to be suspected, when it might fare with you\nas with the friend of Perseus the Macedonian king. For Perseus being\ndefeated by Paulus Emilius, and making his escape with a few\ncompanions, it happened that one of them, in reviewing the past, began\nto point out to the king many mistakes which he had made and which had\nbeen his ruin. Whereupon Perseus turning upon him said, \u201c_Traitor, hast\nthou waited till now when there is no remedy to tell me these things_?\u201d\nand so saying, slew him with his own hand. Such was the penalty\nincurred by one who was silent when he should have spoken, and who\nspoke when he should have been silent; and who found no escape from\ndanger in having refrained from giving advice. Wherefore, I believe,\nthat the course which I have recommended should be observed and\nfollowed.\nCHAPTER XXXVI.\u2014_Why it has been and still may be affirmed of the Gauls,\nthat at the beginning of a fray they are more than Men, but afterwards\nless than Women_.\nThe bravery of the Gaul who on the banks of the Anio challenged any\namong the Romans to fight with him, and the combat that thereupon\nensued between him and Titus Manlius, remind me of what Titus Livius\noftener than once observes in his history, that \u201c_at the beginning of a\nfray the Gauls are more than men, but ere it is ended show themselves\nless than women_.\u201d\nTouching the cause of this, many are content to believe that such is\ntheir nature, which, indeed, I take to be true; but we are not,\ntherefore, to assume that the natural temper which makes them brave at\nthe outset, may not be so trained and regulated as to keep them brave\nto the end. And, to prove this, I say, that armies are of three kinds.\nIn one of these you have discipline with bravery and valour as its\nconsequence. Such was the Roman army, which is shown by all historians\nto have maintained excellent discipline as the result of constant\nmilitary training. And because in a well-disciplined army none must do\nanything save by rule, we find that in the Roman army, from which as it\nconquered the world all others should take example, none either eat, or\nslept, or bought, or sold, or did anything else, whether in his\nmilitary or in his private capacity, without orders from the consul.\nThose armies which do otherwise are not true armies, and if ever they\nhave any success, it is owing to the fury and impetuosity of their\nonset and not to trained and steady valour. But of this impetuosity and\nfury, trained valour, when occasion requires, will make use; nor will\nany danger daunt it or cause it to lose heart, its courage being kept\nalive by its discipline, and its confidence fed by the hope of victory\nwhich never fails it while that discipline is maintained.\nBut the contrary happens with armies of the second sort, those, namely,\nwhich have impetuosity without discipline, as was the case with the\nGauls whose courage in a protracted conflict gradually wore away; so\nthat unless they succeeded in their first attack, the impetuosity to\nwhich they trusted, having no support from disciplined valour, soon\ncooled; when, as they had nothing else to depend on, their efforts\nceased. The Romans, on the other hand, being less disquieted in danger\nby reason of their perfect discipline, and never losing hope, fought\nsteadily and stubbornly to the last, and with the same courage at the\nend as at the outset; nay, growing heated by the conflict, only became\nthe fiercer the longer it was continued.\nIn armies of the third sort both natural spirit and trained valour are\nwanting; and to this class belong the Italian armies of our own times,\nof which it may be affirmed that they are absolutely worthless, never\nobtaining a victory, save when, by some accident, the enemy they\nencounter takes to flight. But since we have daily proofs of this\nabsence of valour, it were needless to set forth particular instances\nof it.\nThat all, however, may know on the testimony of Titus Livius what\nmethods a good army should take, and what are taken by a bad army, I\nshall cite the words he represents Papirius Cursor to have used when\nurging that Fabius, his master of the knights, should be punished for\ndisobedience, and denouncing the consequences which would ensue were he\nabsolved, saying:\u2014\u201c_Let neither God nor man be held in reverence; let\nthe orders of captains and the Divine auspices be alike disregarded;\nlet a vagrant soldiery range without leave through the country of\nfriend or foe; reckless of their military oath, let them disband at\ntheir pleasure; let them forsake their deserted standards, and neither\nrally nor disperse at the word of command; let them fight when they\nchoose, by day or by night, with or without advantage of ground, with\nor without the bidding of their leader, neither maintaining their ranks\n_nor observing the order of battle; and let our armies, from being a\nsolemn and consecrated company, grow to resemble some dark and\nfortuitous gathering of cut-throats._\u201d With this passage before us, it\nis easy to pronounce whether the armies of our times be \u201c_a dark and\nfortuitous gathering_,\u201d or \u201c_a solemn and consecrated company_;\u201d nay,\nhow far they fall short of anything worthy to be called an army,\npossessing neither the impetuous but disciplined valour of the Romans,\nnor even the mere undisciplined impetuosity of the Gauls.\nCHAPTER XXXVII.\u2014_Whether a general engagement should be preceded by\nskirmishes; and how, avoiding these, we may get knowledge of a new\nEnemy._\nBesides all the other difficulties which hinder men from bringing\nanything to its utmost perfection, it appears, as I have already\nobserved, that in close vicinity to every good is found also an evil,\nso apt to grow up along with it that it is hardly possible to have the\none without accepting the other. This we see in all human affairs, and\nthe result is, that unless fortune aid us to overcome this natural and\ncommon disadvantage, we never arrive at any excellence. I am reminded\nof this by the combat between Titus Manlius and the Gaul, concerning\nwhich Livius writes that it \u201c_determined the issue of the entire war;\nsince the Gauls, abandoning their camp, hastily withdrew to the country\nabout Tivoli, whence they presently passed into Campania._\u201d\nIt may be said, therefore, on the one hand, that a prudent captain\nought absolutely to refrain from all those operations which, while of\ntrifling moment in themselves, may possibly produce an ill effect on\nhis army. Now, to engage in a combat wherein you risk your whole\nfortunes without putting forth your entire strength, is, as I observed\nbefore, when condemning the defence of a country by guarding its\ndefiles, an utterly foolhardy course. On the other hand, it is to be\nsaid that a prudent captain, when he has to meet a new and redoubtable\nadversary, ought, before coming to a general engagement, to accustom\nhis men by skirmishes and passages of arms, to the quality of their\nenemy; that they may learn to know him, and how to deal with him, and\nso free themselves from the feeling of dread which his name and fame\ninspire.\nThis for a captain is a matter of the very greatest importance, and one\nwhich it might be almost fatal for him to neglect, since to risk a\npitched battle without first giving your soldiers such opportunities to\nknow their enemy and shake off their fear of him, is to rush on certain\ndestruction. When Valerius Corvinus was sent by the Romans with their\narmies against the Samnites, these being new adversaries with whom up\nto that time they had not measured their strength, Titus Livius tells\nus that before giving battle he made his men make trial of the enemy in\nseveral unimportant skirmishes, \u201c_lest they should be dismayed by a new\nfoe and a new method of warfare._\u201d Nevertheless, there is very great\ndanger that, if your soldiers get the worst in these encounters, their\nalarm and self-distrust may be increased, and a result follow contrary\nto that intended, namely, that you dispirit where you meant to\nreassure.\nThis, therefore, is one of those cases in which the evil lies so nigh\nthe good, and both are so mixed up together that you may readily lay\nhold of the one when you think to grasp the other. And with regard to\nthis I say, that a good captain should do what he can that nothing\nhappen which might discourage his men, nor is there anything so likely\nto discourage them as to begin with a defeat. For which reason\nskirmishes are, as a rule, to be avoided, and only to be allowed where\nyou fight to great advantage and with a certainty of victory. In like\nmanner, no attempt should be made to defend the passes leading into\nyour country unless your whole army can co-operate; nor are any towns\nto be defended save those whose loss necessarily involves your ruin.\nAnd as to those towns which you do defend, you must so arrange, both in\nrespect of the garrison within and the army without, that in the event\nof a siege your whole forces can be employed. All other towns you must\nleave undefended. For, provided your army be kept together, you do not,\nin losing what you voluntarily abandon, forfeit your military\nreputation, or sacrifice your hopes of final success. But when you lose\nwhat it was your purpose, and what all know it was your purpose to\nhold, you suffer a real loss and injury, and, like the Gauls on the\ndefeat of their champion, you are ruined by a mishap of no moment in\nitself.\nPhilip of Macedon, the father of Perseus, a great soldier in his day,\nand of a great name, on being invaded by the Romans, laid waste and\nrelinquished much of his territory which he thought he could not\ndefend; rightly judging it more hurtful to his reputation to lose\nterritory after an attempt to defend it, than to abandon it to the\nenemy as something he cared little to retain. So, likewise, after the\nbattle of Cann\u00e6, when their affairs were at their worst, the Romans\nrefused aid to many subject and protected States, charging them to\ndefend themselves as best they could. And this is a better course than\nto undertake to defend and then to fail; for by refusing to defend, you\nlose only your friend; whereas in failing, you not only lose your\nfriend, but weaken yourself.\nBut to return to the matter in hand, I affirm, that even when a captain\nis constrained by inexperience of his enemy to make trial of him by\nmeans of skirmishes, he ought first to see that he has so much the\nadvantage that he runs no risk of defeat; or else, and this is his\nbetter course, he must do as Marius did when sent against the\nCimbrians, a very courageous people who were laying Italy waste, and by\ntheir fierceness and numbers, and from the fact of their having already\nrouted a Roman army, spreading terror wherever they came. For before\nfighting a decisive battle, Marius judged it necessary to do something\nto lessen the dread in which these enemies were held by his army; and\nbeing a prudent commander, he, on several occasions, posted his men at\npoints where the Cimbrians must pass, that seeing and growing familiar\nwith their appearance, while themselves in safety and within the\nshelter of their intrenched camp, and finding them to be a mere\ndisorderly rabble, encumbered with baggage, and either without weapons,\nor with none that were formidable, they might at last assume courage\nand grow eager to engage them in battle. The part thus prudently taken\nby Marius, should be carefully imitated by others who would escape the\ndangers above spoken of and not have to betake themselves like the\nGauls to a disgraceful flight, on sustaining some trifling defeat.\nBut since in this Discourse I have referred by name to Valerius\nCorvinus, in my next Chapter I shall cite his words to show what manner\nof man a captain ought to be.\nCHAPTER XXXVIII.\u2014_Of the Qualities of a Captain in whom his Soldiers\ncan confide._\nValerius Corvinus, as I have said already, was sent in command of an\narmy against the Samnites, who were then new enemies to Rome.\nWherefore, to reassure his soldiers and familiarize them with their\nadversaries, he made them engage with them in various unimportant\npassages of arms. But not thinking this enough, he resolved before\ndelivering battle to address his men, and by reminding them of their\nvalour and his own, to make it plain how little they should esteem such\nenemies. And from the words which Titus Livius puts in his mouth we may\ngather what manner of man the captain ought to be in whom an army will\nput its trust. For he makes him say:\u2014\u201c_Bear ye also this in mind under\nwhose conduct and auspices you are about to fight, and whether he whom\nyou are to obey be great only in exhorting, bold only in words, and all\nunpractised in arms; or whether he be one who himself knows how to use\nhis spear, to march before the eagles, and play his part in the\nthickest of the fight. Soldiers! I would have you follow my deeds and\nnot my words, and look to me for example rather than for commands; for\nwith this right hand I have won for myself three consulships, and an\nunsurpassed renown._\u201d Which words rightly understood give every one to\nknow what he must do to merit a captain\u2019s rank. And if any man obtain\nit by other means, he will soon discover that advancement due to chance\nor intrigue rather takes away than brings reputation, since it is men\nwho give lustre to titles and not titles to men.\nFrom what has been said it will likewise be understood that if great\ncaptains when matched against an unfamiliar foe have had to resort to\nunusual methods for reassuring the minds even of veteran soldiers, much\nmore will it be necessary for them to use all their address when in\ncommand of a raw and untried army which has never before looked an\nenemy in the face. For if an unfamiliar adversary inspire terror even\nin a veteran army, how much greater must be the terror which any army\nwill inspire in the minds of untrained men. And yet we often find all\nthese difficulties overcome by the supreme prudence of a great captain\nlike the Roman Gracchus or the Theban Epaminondas, of whom I have\nbefore spoken, who with untried troops defeated the most practised\nveterans. And the method they are said to have followed was to train\ntheir men for some months in mimic warfare, so as to accustom them to\ndiscipline and obedience, after which they employed them with complete\nconfidence on actual service.\nNo man, therefore, of warlike genius, need despair of creating a good\narmy if only he have the men; for the prince who has many subjects and\nyet lacks soldiers, has only to thank his own inertness and want of\nforesight, and must not complain of the cowardice of his people.\nCHAPTER XXXIX.\u2014_That a Captain should have good knowledge of Places._\nAmong other qualifications essential in a good captain is a knowledge,\nboth general and particular, of places and countries, for without such\nknowledge it is impossible for him to carry out any enterprise in the\nbest way. And while practice is needed for perfection in every art, in\nthis it is needed in the highest degree. Such practice, or particular\nknowledge as it may be termed, is sooner acquired in the chase than in\nany other exercise; and, accordingly, we find it said by ancient\nhistorians that those heroes who, in their day, ruled the world, were\nbred in the woods and trained to the chase; for this exercise not\nmerely gives the knowledge I speak of, but teaches countless other\nlessons needful in war. And Xenophon in his life of Cyrus tells us,\nthat Cyrus, on his expedition against the King of Armenia, when\nassigning to each of his followers the part he was to perform, reminded\nthem that the enterprise on which they were engaged, differed little\nfrom one of those hunting expeditions on which they had gone so often\nin his company; likening those who were to lie in ambush in the\nmountains, to the men sent to spread the toils on the hill-tops; and\nthose who were to overrun the plain, to the beaters whose business it\nis to start the game from its lair that it may be driven into the\ntoils. Now, this is related to show how, in the opinion of Xenophon,\nthe chase is a mimic representation of war, and therefore to be\nesteemed by the great as useful and honourable.\nNor can that knowledge of countries which I have spoken of as necessary\nin a commander, be obtained in any convenient way except by the chase.\nFor he who joins therein gains a special acquaintance with the\ncharacter of the country in which it is followed; and he who has made\nhimself specially familiar with one district, will afterwards readily\nunderstand the character of any strange country into which he comes.\nFor all countries, and the districts of which they are made up, have a\ncertain resemblance to one another, so that from a knowledge of one we\ncan pass easily to the knowledge of another. He therefore who is\nwithout such practical acquaintance with some one country, can only\nwith difficulty, and after a long time, obtain a knowledge of another,\nwhile he who possesses it can take in at a glance how this plain\nspreads, how that mountain slopes, whither that valley winds, and all\nother like particulars in respect of which he has already acquired a\ncertain familiarity.\nThe truth of what I affirm is shown by Titus Livius in the case of\nPublius Decius, who, being military tribune in the army which the\nconsul Cornelius led against the Samnites, when the consul advanced\ninto a defile where the Roman army were like to be shut in by the\nenemy, perceiving the great danger they ran, and noting, as Livius\nrelates, a hill which rose by a steep ascent and overhung the enemy\u2019s\ncamp, and which, though hard of access for heavy-armed troops,\npresented little difficulty to troops lightly armed, turned to the\nconsul and said:\u2014\u201c_Seest thou, Aulus Cornelius, yonder height over\nabove the enemy, which they have been blind enough to neglect? There,\nwere we manfully to seize it, might we find the citadel of our hopes\nand of our safety._\u201d Whereupon, he was sent by the consul with three\nthousand men to secure the height, and so saved the Roman army. And as\nit was part of his plan to make his own escape and carry off his men\nsafely under shelter of night, Livius represents him as saying to his\nsoldiers:\u2014\u201c_Come with me, that, while daylight still serves, we may\nlearn where the enemy have posted their guards, and by what exit we may\nissue hence._\u201d Accordingly, putting on the cloak of a common soldier,\nlest the enemy should observe that an officer was making his rounds he\nsurveyed their camp in all directions.\nNow any one who carefully studies the whole of this passage, must\nperceive how useful and necessary it is for a captain to know the\nnature of places, which knowledge had Decius not possessed he could not\nhave decided that it would be for the advantage of the Roman army to\noccupy this hill; nor could he have judged from a distance whether the\nhill was accessible or no; and when he reached the summit and desired\nto return to the consul, since he was surrounded on all sides by the\nenemy, he never could have distinguished the path it was safe for him\nto take, from those guarded by the foe. For all which reasons it was\nabsolutely essential that Decius should have that thorough knowledge\nwhich enabled him by gaining possession of this hill to save the Roman\narmy, and to discover a path whereby, in the event of his being\nattacked, he and his followers might escape.\nCHAPTER XL.\u2014_That Fraud is fair in War._\nAlthough in all other affairs it be hateful to use fraud, in the\noperations of war it is praiseworthy and glorious; so that he who gets\nthe better of his enemy by fraud, is as much extolled as he who\nprevails by force. This appears in the judgments passed by such as have\nwritten of the lives of great warriors, who praise Hannibal and those\nother captains who have been most noted for acting in this way. But\nsince we may read of many instances of such frauds, I shall not cite\nthem here. This, however, I desire to say, that I would not have it\nunderstood that any fraud is glorious which leads you to break your\nplighted word, or to depart from covenants to which you have agreed;\nfor though to do so may sometimes gain you territory and power, it can\nnever, as I have said elsewhere, gain you glory.\nThe fraud, then, which I here speak of is that employed against an\nenemy who places no trust in you, and is wholly directed to military\noperations, such as the stratagem of Hannibal at the Lake of\nThrasymene, when he feigned flight in order to draw the Roman consul\nand his army into an ambuscade; or when to escape from the hands of\nFabius Maximus he fastened lights to the horns of his oxen. Similar to\nthe above was the deceit practised by Pontius the Samnite commander to\ninveigle the Roman army into the Caudine Forks. For after he had drawn\nup his forces behind the hills, he sent out a number of his soldiers,\ndisguised as herdsmen, to drive great herds of cattle across the plain;\nwho being captured by the Romans, and interrogated as to where the\nSamnite army was, all of them, as they had been taught by Pontius,\nagreed in saying that it had gone to besiege Nocera: which being\nbelieved by the consuls, led them to advance within the Caudine Valley,\nwhere no sooner were they come than they were beset by the Samnites.\nAnd the victory thus won by a fraud would have been most glorious for\nPontius had he but taken the advice of his father Herennius, who urged\nthat the Romans should either be set at liberty unconditionally, or all\nbe put to death; but that a mean course \u201c_which neither gains friends\nnor gets rid of foes_\u201d should be avoided. And this was sound advice,\nfor, as has already been shown, in affairs of moment a mean course is\nalways hurtful.\nCHAPTER XLI.\u2014_That our Country is to be defended by Honour or by\nDishonour; and in either way is well defended._\nThe consuls together with the whole Roman army fell, as I have related,\ninto the hands of the Samnites, who imposed on them the most\nignominious terms, insisting that they should be stripped of their\narms, and pass under the yoke before they were allowed to return to\nRome. The consuls being astounded by the harshness of these conditions\nand the whole army overwhelmed with dismay, Lucius Lentulus, the Roman\nlieutenant, stood forward and said, that in his opinion they ought to\ndecline no course whereby their country might be saved; and that as the\nvery existence of Rome depended on the preservation of her army, that\narmy must be saved at any sacrifice, for whether the means be\nhonourable or ignominious, all is well done that is done for the\ndefence of our country. And he said that were her army preserved, Rome,\nin course of time, might wipe out the disgrace; but if her army were\ndestroyed, however gloriously it might perish, Rome and her freedom\nwould perish with it. In the event his counsel was followed.\nNow this incident deserves to be noted and pondered over by every\ncitizen who is called on to advise his country; for when the entire\nsafety of our country is at stake, no consideration of what is just or\nunjust, merciful or cruel, praiseworthy or shameful, must intervene. On\nthe contrary, every other consideration being set aside, that course\nalone must be taken which preserves the existence of the country and\nmaintains its liberty. And this course we find followed by the people\nof France, both in their words and in their actions, with the view of\nsupporting the dignity of their king and the integrity of their\nkingdom; for there is no remark they listen to with more impatience\nthan that this or the other course is disgraceful to the king. For\ntheir king, they say, can incur no disgrace by any resolve he may take,\nwhether it turn out well or ill; and whether it succeed or fail, all\nmaintain that he has acted as a king should.\nCHAPTER XLII.\u2014_That Promises made on Compulsion are not to be\nobserved._\nWhen, after being subjected to this disgrace, the consuls returned to\nRome with their disarmed legions, Spurius Posthumius, himself one of\nthe consuls, was the first to contend in the senate that the terms made\nin the Caudine Valley were not to be observed. For he argued that the\nRoman people were not bound by them, though he himself doubtless was,\ntogether with all the others who had promised peace; wherefore, if the\npeople desired to set themselves free from every engagement, he and all\nthe rest who had given this promise must be made over as prisoners into\nthe hands of the Samnites. And so steadfastly did he hold to this\nopinion, that the senate were content to adopt it, and sending him and\nthe rest as prisoners back to Samnium, protested to the Samnites that\nthe peace was not binding. And so kind was Fortune to Posthumius on\nthis occasion, that the Samnites would not keep him as a prisoner, and\nthat on his return to Rome, notwithstanding his defeat, he was held in\nhigher honour by the Romans than the victorious Pontius by his\ncountrymen.\nHere two points are to be noted; first, that glory may be won by any\naction; for although, commonly, it follow upon victory, it may also\nfollow on defeat, if this defeat be seen to have happened through no\nfault of yours, or if, directly after, you perform some valiant action\nwhich cancels it. The other point to be noted is that there is no\ndisgrace in not observing promises wrung from you by force; for\npromises thus extorted when they affect the public welfare will always\nbe broken so soon as the pressure under which they were made is\nwithdrawn, and that, too, without shame on the part of him who breaks\nthem; of which we read many instances in history, and find them\nconstantly occurring at the present day. Nay, as between princes, not\nonly are such compulsory promises broken when the force which extorted\nthem is removed, but all other promises as well, are in like manner\ndisregarded when the causes which led to them no longer operate.\nWhether this is a thing to be commended or no, and whether such methods\nought or ought not to be followed by princes, has already been\nconsidered by me in my \u201c_Treatise of the Prince_\u201d wherefore I say no\nmore on that subject here.\nCHAPTER XLIII.\u2014_That Men born in the same Province retain through all\nTimes nearly the same Character._\nThe wise are wont to say, and not without reason or at random, that he\nwho would forecast what is about to happen should look to what has\nbeen; since all human events, whether present or to come, have their\nexact counterpart in the past. And this, because these events are\nbrought about by men, whose passions and dispositions remaining in all\nages the same naturally give rise to the same effects; although,\ndoubtless, the operation of these causes takes a higher form, now in\none province, and now in another, according to the character of the\ntraining wherein the inhabitants of these provinces acquire their way\nof life.\nAnother aid towards judging of the future by the past, is to observe\nhow the same nation long retains the same customs, remaining constantly\ncovetous or deceitful, or similarly stamped by some one vice or virtue.\nAny one reading the past history of our city of Florence, and noting\nwhat has recently befallen it, will find the French and German nations\noverflowing with avarice, pride, cruelty, and perfidy, all of which\nfour vices have at divers times wrought much harm to our city. As an\ninstance of their perfidy, every one knows how often payments of money\nwere made to Charles VIII. of France, in return for which he engaged to\nrestore the fortresses of Pisa, yet never did restore them, manifesting\nthereby his bad faith and grasping avarice. Or, to pass from these very\nrecent events, all may have heard of what happened in the war in which\nthe Florentines were involved with the Visconti, dukes of Milan, when\nFlorence, being left without other resource, resolved to invite the\nemperor into Italy, that she might be assisted by his name and power in\nher struggle with Lombardy. The emperor promised to come with a strong\narmy to take part against the Visconti and to protect Florence from\nthem, on condition that the Florentines paid him a hundred thousand\nducats on his setting out, and another hundred thousand on his arrival\nin Italy; to which terms the Florentines agreed. But although he then\nreceived payment of the first instalment and, afterwards, on reaching\nVerona, of the second, he turned back from the expedition without\neffecting anything, alleging as his excuse that he was stopped by\ncertain persons who had failed to fulfil their engagements. But if\nFlorence had not been urged by passion or overcome by necessity, or had\nshe read of and understood the ancient usages of the barbarians, she\nwould neither on this, nor on many other occasions, have been deceived\nby them, seeing that these nations have always been of the same\ncharacter, and have always, in all circumstances, and with all men\nalike, used the same methods. For in ancient times we find them\nbehaving after the same fashion to the Etruscans, who, when overpowered\nby the Romans, by whom they had been repeatedly routed and put to\nflight, perceiving that they could not stand without help, entered into\na compact with the Gauls dwelling in the parts of Italy south of the\nAlps, to pay them a certain sum if they would unite with them in a\ncampaign against the Romans. But the Gauls, after taking their money,\nrefused to arm on their behalf, alleging that they had not been paid to\nmake war on the enemies of the Etruscans, but only to refrain from\npillaging their lands. And thus the people of Etruria, through the\navarice and perfidy of the Gauls, were at once defrauded of their money\nand disappointed of the help which they had counted on obtaining.\nFrom which two instances of the Etruscans in ancient times and of the\nFlorentines in recent, we may see that barbaric races have constantly\nfollowed the same methods, and may easily draw our conclusions as to\nhow far princes should trust them.\nCHAPTER XLIV.\u2014_That where ordinary methods fail, Hardihood and Daring\noften succeed._\nWhen attacked by the Romans, the Samnites as they could not without\nhelp stand against them in the field, resolved to leave garrisons in\nthe towns of Samnium, and to pass with their main army into Etruria,\nthat country being then at truce with Rome, and thus ascertain whether\ntheir actual presence in arms might not move the Etruscans to renew\nhostilities against Rome, which they had refused to renew when invited\nthrough envoys. During the negotiations which, on this occasion, passed\nbetween the two nations, the Samnites in explaining the chief causes\nthat led them to take up arms, used the memorable words\u2014\u201c_they had\nrisen because peace is a heavier burthen for slaves than war for\nfreemen_\u201d In the end, partly by their persuasions, and partly by the\npresence of their army, they induced the Etruscans to join forces with\nthem.\nHere we are to note that when a prince would obtain something from\nanother, he ought, if the occasion allow, to leave him no time to\ndeliberate, but should so contrive that the other may see the need of\nresolving at once; as he will, if he perceive that refusal or delay in\ncomplying with what is asked of him, will draw upon him a sudden and\ndangerous resentment.\nThis method we have seen employed with good effect in our own times by\nPope Julius II. in dealing with France, and by M. de Foix, the general\nof the French king, in dealing with the Marquis of Mantua. For Pope\nJulius desiring to expel the Bentivogli from Bologna, and thinking that\nfor this purpose he needed the help of French troops, and to have the\nVenetians neutral, after sounding both and receiving from both\nhesitating and ambiguous answers, determined to make both fall in with\nhis views, by giving them no time to oppose him; and so, setting forth\nfrom Rome with as strong a force as he could get together, he marched\non Bologna, sending word to the Venetians that they must stand aloof,\nand to the King of France to send him troops. The result was that in\nthe brief time allowed them, neither of the two powers could make up\ntheir mind to thwart him; and knowing that refusal or delay would be\nviolently resented by the Pope, they yielded to his demands, the king\nsending him soldiers and the Venetians maintaining neutrality.\nM. de Foix, again, being with the king\u2019s army in Bologna when word came\nthat Brescia had risen, could not rest till he had recovered that town.\nBut, to get there he had to choose between two routes, one long and\ncircuitous leading through the territories of the king, the other short\nand direct. In taking the latter route, however, not only would he have\nto pass through the dominions of the Marquis of Mantua, but also to\nmake his way into these through the lakes and marshes wherewith that\ncountry abounds, by following an embanked road, closed and guarded by\nthe marquis with forts and other defensive works. Resolving,\nnevertheless, to take the shortest road at all hazards, he waited till\nhis men were already on their march before signifying to the marquis\nthat he desired leave to pass through his country, so that no time\nmight be left him to deliberate. Taken aback by the unexpected demand,\nthe marquis gave the leave sought, which he never would have given had\nDe Foix acted with less impetuosity. For he was in league with the\nVenetians and with the Pope, and had a son in the hands of the latter;\nall which circumstances would have afforded him fair pretexts for\nrefusal. But carried away by the suddenness and urgency of the demand,\nhe yielded. And in like manner the Etruscans yielded to the instances\nof the Samnites, the presence of whose army decided them to renew\nhostilities which before they had declined to renew.\nCHAPTER XLV.\u2014_Whether in battle it is better to await and repel the\nEnemy\u2019s attack, or to anticipate it by an impetuous onset._\nDecius and Fabius, the Roman consuls, were each of them in command of a\nseparate army, one directed against the Samnites, the other against the\nEtruscans: and as both delivered battle, we have to pronounce, in\nrespect of the two engagements, which commander followed the better\nmethod. Decius attacked his enemy at once with the utmost fury and with\nhis whole strength. Fabius was content, at first, merely to maintain\nhis ground; for judging that more was to be gained by a later attack,\nhe reserved his forces for a final effort, when the ardour of the enemy\nhad cooled and his energy spent itself. The event showed Fabius to be\nmore successful in his tactics than Decius, who being exhausted by his\nfirst onset, and seeing his ranks begin to waver, to secure by death\nthe glory he could no longer hope from victory, followed the example\nset him by his father, and sacrificed himself to save the Roman\nlegions. Word whereof being brought to Fabius, he, to gain, while he\nyet lived, as much honour as the other had earned by his death, pushed\nforward all the troops he had reserved for his final effort, and so\nobtained an unexampled victory. Whence we see that of the two methods,\nthat of Fabius was the safer and the more deserving our imitation.\nCHAPTER XLVI.\u2014_How the Characteristics of Families come to be\nperpetuated._\nManners and institutions differing in different cities, seem here to\nproduce a harder and there a softer race; and a like difference may\nalso be discerned in the character of different families in the same\ncity. And while this holds good of all cities, we have many instances\nof it in reading the history of Rome. For we find the Manlii always\nstern and stubborn; the Valerii kindly and courteous; the Claudii\nhaughty and ambitious; and many families besides similarly\ndistinguished from one another by their peculiar qualities.\nThese qualities we cannot refer wholly to the _blood_, for that must\nchange as a result of repeated intermarriages, but must ascribe rather\nto the different training and education given in different families.\nFor much turns on whether a child of tender years hears a thing well or\nill spoken of, since this must needs make an impression on him whereby\nhis whole conduct in after life will be influenced. Were it otherwise\nwe should not have found the whole family of the Claudii moved by the\ndesires and stirred by the passions which Titus Livius notes in many of\nthem, and more especially in one holding the office of censor, who,\nwhen his colleague laid down his magistracy, as the law prescribed, at\nthe end of eighteen months, would not resign, maintaining that he was\nentitled to hold the office for five years in accordance with the\noriginal law by which the censorship was regulated. And although his\nrefusal gave occasion to much controversy, and bred great tumult and\ndisturbance, no means could be found to depose him from his office,\nwhich he persisted in retaining in opposition to the will of the entire\ncommons and a majority of the senate. And any who shall read the speech\nmade against him by Publius Sempronius, tribune of the people, will\nfind therein all the Claudian insolence exposed, and will recognize the\ndocility and good temper shown by the body of the citizens in\nrespecting the laws and institutions of their country.\nCHAPTER XLVII.\u2014_That love of his Country should lead a good Citizen to\nforget private Wrongs._\nWhile commanding as consul against the Samnites, Manlius was wounded in\na skirmish. His army being thereby endangered, the senate judged it\nexpedient to send Papirius Cursor as dictator to supply his place. But\nas it was necessary that the dictator should be nominated by Fabius,\nthe other consul, who was with the army in Etruria, and as a doubt was\nfelt that he might refuse to nominate Papirius, who was his enemy, the\nsenate sent two messengers to entreat him to lay aside private\nanimosity, and make the nomination which the public interest required.\nMoved by love of his country Fabius did as he was asked, although by\nhis silence, and by many other signs, he gave it to be known that\ncompliance was distasteful. From his conduct at this juncture all who\nwould be thought good citizens should take example.\nCHAPTER XLVIII.\u2014_That on finding an Enemy make what seems a grave\nblunder, we should suspect some fraud to lurk behind._\nThe consul having gone to Rome to perform certain ceremonial rites, and\nFulvius being left in charge of the Roman army in Etruria, the\nEtruscans, to see whether they could not circumvent the new commander,\nplanting an ambush not far from the Roman camp, sent forward soldiers\ndisguised as shepherds driving large flocks of sheep so as to pass in\nsight of the Roman army. These pretended shepherds coming close to the\nwall of his camp, Fulvius, marvelling at what appeared to him\nunaccountable audacity, hit upon a device whereby the artifice of the\nEtruscans was detected and their design defeated.\nHere it seems proper to note that the captain of an army ought not to\nbuild on what seems a manifest blunder on the part of an enemy; for as\nmen are unlikely to act with conspicuous want of caution, it will\ncommonly be found that this blunder is cover to a fraud. And yet, so\nblinded are men\u2019s minds by their eagerness for victory, that they look\nonly to what appears on the surface.\nAfter defeating the Romans on the Allia, the Gauls, hastening on to\nRome, found the gates of the city left open and unguarded. But fearing\nsome stratagem, and being unable to believe that the Romans could be so\nfoolish and cowardly as to abandon their city, they waited during the\nwhole of that day and the following night outside the gates, without\ndaring to enter. In the year 1508, when the Florentines Avere engaged\nin besieging Pisa, Alfonso del Mutolo, a citizen of that town,\nhappening to be taken prisoner, was released on his promise to procure\nthe surrender to the Florentines of one of the gates of the city.\nAfterwards, on pretence of arranging for the execution of this\nsurrender, he came repeatedly to confer with those whom the Florentine\ncommissaries had deputed to treat with him, coming not secretly but\nopenly, and accompanied by other citizens of Pisa, whom he caused to\nstand aside while he conversed with the Florentines. From all which\ncircumstances his duplicity might have been suspected, since, had he\nmeant to do as he had engaged, it was most unlikely that he should be\nnegotiating so openly. But the desire to recover possession of Pisa so\nblinded the Florentines that they allowed themselves to be conducted\nunder his guidance to the Lucca Gate, where, through his treachery, but\nto their own disgrace, they lost a large number of their men and\nofficers.\nCHAPTER XLIX.\u2014_That a Commonwealth to preserve its Freedom has constant\nneed of new Ordinances. Of the services in respect of which Quintius\nFabius received the surname of Maximus._\nIt must happen, as I have already said, in every great city, that\ndisorders needing the care of the physician continually spring up; and\nthe graver these disorders are, the greater will be the skill needed\nfor their treatment. And if ever in any city, most assuredly in Rome,\nwe see these disorders assume strange and unexpected shapes. As when it\nappeared that all the Roman wives had conspired to murder their\nhusbands, many of them being found to have actually administered\npoison, and many others to have drugs in readiness for the purpose.\nOf like nature was the conspiracy of the Bacchanals, discovered at the\ntime of the Macedonian war, wherein many thousands, both men and women,\nwere implicated, and which, had it not been found out, or had the\nRomans not been accustomed to deal with large bodies of offenders, must\nhave proved perilous for their city. And, indeed, if the greatness of\nthe Roman Republic were not declared by countless other signs, as well\nas by the manner in which it caused its laws to be observed, it might\nbe seen in the character of the punishments which it inflicted against\nwrong-doers. For in vindicating justice, it would not scruple or\nhesitate to put a whole legion to death, to depopulate an entire city,\nor send eight or ten thousand men at a time into banishment, subject to\nthe most stringent conditions, which had to be observed, not by one of\nthese exiles only, but by all. As in the case of those soldiers who\nfought unsuccessfully at Cann\u00e6, who were banished to Sicily, subject to\nthe condition that they should not harbour in towns, and should all eat\nstanding.\nBut the most formidable of all their punishments was that whereby one\nman out of every ten in an entire army was chosen by lot to be put to\ndeath. For correcting a great body of men no more effectual means could\nbe devised; because, when a multitude have offended and the ringleaders\nare not known, all cannot be punished, their number being too great;\nwhile to punish some only, and leave the rest unpunished, were unjust\nto those punished and an encouragement to those passed over to offend\nagain. But where you put to death a tenth chosen by lot, where all\nequally deserve death, he who is punished will blame his unlucky\nfortune, while he who escapes will be afraid that another time the lot\nmay be his, and for that reason will be careful how he repeats his\noffence. The poisoners and the Bacchanals, therefore, were punished as\ntheir crimes deserved.\nAlthough disorders like these occasion mischievous results in a\ncommonwealth, still they are not fatal, since almost always there is\ntime to correct them. But no time is given in the case of disorders in\nthe State itself, which unless they be treated by some wise citizen,\nwill always bring a city to destruction. From the readiness wherewith\nthe Romans conferred the right of citizenship on foreigners, there came\nto be so many new citizens in Rome, and possessed of so large a share\nof the suffrage, that the government itself began to alter, forsaking\nthose courses which it was accustomed to follow, and growing estranged\nfrom the men to whom it had before looked for guidance. Which being\nobserved by Quintius Fabius when censor, he caused all those new\ncitizens to be classed in four _Tribes_, that being reduced within this\nnarrow limit they might not have it in their power to corrupt the\nentire State. And this was a wisely contrived measure, for, without\nintroducing any violent change, it supplied a convenient remedy, and\none so acceptable to the republic as to gain for Fabius the\nwell-deserved name of Maximus.\nTHE END.", "source": "discourses.txt"}
