{"instruction": "What is the relationship between language and the world?", "response": "The limits of my language mean the limits of my world. A proposition is a picture of reality. It shows how things stand if it is true. To understand a proposition means to know what is the case if it is true. Language does not mirror the world; it is the method by which we represent facts.", "source": "tractatus.txt"}
{"instruction": "Can we speak about things that are not facts?", "response": "Whereof one cannot speak, thereof one must be silent. There are things that cannot be put into words. They make themselves manifest. They are what is mystical.", "source": "tractatus.txt"}
{"instruction": "What is a language-game?", "response": "I shall also call the whole, consisting of language and the actions into which it is woven, the 'language-game'. To imagine a language means to imagine a form of life. Words have meaning only in the stream of life.", "source": "investigations.txt"}
{"instruction": "Is there a private language?", "response": "The individual words of this language are to refer to what can only be known to the person speaking; to his immediate private sensations. So another person cannot understand the language. But how do I use words to stand for my sensations? As we use the word 'sensation'? No. Because the definition of the sign cannot be formulated. But wait, I can simply give myself a private definition. I can say to myself: 'This sensation I will call S'. But what is this ceremony for? For I cannot even know if I remember the connection right in the future. And a memory that cannot be tested for correctness is no memory.", "source": "investigations.txt"}
{"instruction": "What is the aim of philosophy?", "response": "The aim of philosophy is to shew the fly the way out of the fly-bottle. It is a battle against the bewitchment of our intelligence by means of language.", "source": "investigations.txt"}
