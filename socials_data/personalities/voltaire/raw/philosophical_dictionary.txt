One day I was at a tragedy near by a philosopher. "How beautiful that
is!" he said.

"What do you find beautiful there?" I asked.

"It is beautiful," he answered, "because the author has reached his
goal."

The following day he took some medicine which did him good. "The
medicine has reached its goal," I said to him. "What a beautiful
medicine!" He grasped that one cannot say a medicine is beautiful, and
that to give the name of "beauty" to something, the thing must cause
you to admire it and give you pleasure. He agreed that the tragedy had
inspired these sentiments in him, and that there was the to kalon,
beauty.

We journeyed to England: the same piece, perfectly translated, was
played there; it made everybody in the audience yawn. "Ho, ho!" he
said, "the to kalon is not the same for the English and the French."
After much reflection he came to the conclusion that beauty is often
very relative, just as what is decent in Japan is indecent in Rome,
and what is fashionable in Paris, is not fashionable in Pekin; and
he saved himself the trouble of composing a long treatise on beauty.

There are actions which the whole world finds beautiful. Two of Caesar's
officers, mortal enemies, send each other a challenge, not as to who
shall shed the other's blood with tierce and quarte behind a thicket as
with us, but as to who shall best defend the Roman camp, which the
Barbarians are about to attack. One of them, having repulsed the enemy,
is near succumbing; the other rushes to his aid, saves his life, and
completes the victory.

A friend sacrifices his life for his friend; a son for his father....
The Algonquin, the Frenchman, the Chinaman, will all say that that is
very beautiful, that these actions give them pleasure, that they admire
them.

They will say as much of the great moral maxims, of Zarathustra's--"In
doubt if an action be just, abstain..."; of
Confucius'--"Forget injuries, never forget kindnesses."

The negro with the round eyes and flat nose, who will not give the name
of "beauties" to the ladies of our courts, will without hesitation give
it to these actions and these maxims. The wicked man even will
recognize the beauty of these virtues which he dare not imitate. The
beauty which strikes the senses merely, the imagination, and that which
is called "intelligence," is often uncertain therefore. The beauty
which speaks to the heart is not that. You will find a host of people
who will tell you that they have found nothing beautiful in
three-quarters of the Iliad; but nobody will deny that Codrus' devotion
to his people was very beautiful, supposing it to be true.

There are many other reasons which determine me not to write a treatise
on beauty.
