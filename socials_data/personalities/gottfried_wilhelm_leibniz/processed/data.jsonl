{"text": "The Monad, of which we shall here speak, is nothing but a simple substance, which enters into compounds. By 'simple' is meant that without parts.\nAnd there must be simple substances, since there are compounds; for a compound is nothing but a collection or aggregatum of simple things.\nNow where there are no parts, there can be neither extension nor form nor divisibility. These Monads are the real atoms of nature and in a word the elements of things.\nNo dissolution of these elements is to be feared, and there is no conceivable way in which a simple substance can be destroyed by natural means.\nFor the same reason there is no conceivable way in which a simple substance can come into existence by natural means, since it cannot be formed by the composition of parts.\nThus it may be said that a Monad can only come into existence or end its existence all at once; that is to say, it can come into existence only by creation and end only by annihilation, while that which is compound, comes into existence or ends by parts.\nThere is also no way of explaining how a Monad can be altered in quality or internally changed by any other created thing; since it is impossible to change the place of anything in it or to conceive in it any internal motion which could be produced, directed, increased or diminished therein, although all this is possible in the case of compounds, in which there are changes among the parts. The Monads have no windows, through which anything could come in or go out. Accidents cannot separate themselves from substances nor go about outside of them, as the 'sensible species' of the Scholastics used to do. Thus neither substance nor accident can enter a Monad from without.\nHowever, the Monads must have some qualities, otherwise they would not even be existing things. And if simple substances did not differ by their qualities, there would be no means of perceiving any change in things; for what is in the compound can come only from the simple elements it contains, and the Monads, if they had no qualities, would be indistinguishable from one another, since they do not differ in quantity. Consequently, space being a plenum, each place would always receive, in any motion, exactly the equivalent of what it already had, and no one state of things would be discernible from another.\nIndeed, every Monad must be different from every other. For in nature there are never two beings which are perfectly alike and in which it is not possible to find an internal difference, or at least a difference founded upon an intrinsic quality.\nI assume also as admitted that every created being, and consequently the created Monad, is subject to change, and further that this change is continuous in each.\nIt follows from what has just been said, that the natural changes of the Monads come from an internal principle, since an external cause can have no influence upon their inner being.\nBut, besides the principle of the change, there must be a particular series of changes, which constitutes, so to speak, the specific nature and variety of the simple substances.\nThis particular series of changes should involve a multiplicity in the unit or in that which is simple. For, as every natural change takes place by degrees, something changes and something remains; and consequently in the simple substance there must be a plurality of affections and relations, although there are no parts.\nThe passing condition, which involves and represents a multiplicity in the unit or in the simple substance, is nothing but what is called Perception, which is to be distinguished from Apperception or Consciousness, as will appear in what follows. In this matter the Cartesian view is extremely defective, for it treats as non-existent those perceptions of which we are not consciously aware. This has also led them to believe that minds alone are Monads, and that there are no souls of animals nor other Entelechies. Thus, like the crowd, they have failed to distinguish between a prolonged unconsciousness and absolute death, which has made them fall into the error of the Scholastics of regarding souls as entirely separate from bodies, and has even confirmed the ill-balanced minds in the opinion that the soul is mortal.\nThe action of the internal principle which causes the change or the passage from one perception to another, may be called Appetition; it is true that desire cannot always fully attain to the whole perception at which it aims, but it always obtains some of it and reaches new perceptions.\nWe experience in ourselves a multiplicity in the simple substance, when we find that the least thought of which we are conscious involves variety in its object. Thus all those who admit that the soul is a simple substance should admit this multiplicity in the Monad; and M. Bayle ought not to have found any difficulty in this, as he has done in his Dictionary, article 'Rorarius'.", "source": "monadology_excerpts.txt"}
{"text": "I. THE DIVINE PERFECTION AND THAT GOD DOES EVERYTHING IN THE MOST DESIRABLE WAY\nThe conception of God which is the most common and the most full of meaning is that which presents him as an absolutely perfect being. But the consequences of this are not yet sufficiently well understood; and in order to get at them, there is need of remarking that there are several entirely different kinds of perfection, that God possesses all of them together, and that each of them belongs to him in the highest degree.\nWe must also know what perfection is. One thing is surely more perfect than another if it has more of essence or reality. For perfection is nothing but the quantity of essence or reality.\nThus, since God is the supreme cause, he must be the author of the existence of effects; but since he is also the supreme reason, he must be the author of their essence or of their nature, which is nothing else than their capacity for existence, just as the number of sides and the equality of the angles is the nature of the square.\nIt is for this reason that God is the author of all the realities which are in contingent things, and that he is the source of all the possibilities which are in necessary things.\nBut we must not imagine that the eternal truths, being dependent on God, are arbitrary and depend on his will, as Descartes seems to have held, and afterwards M. Poiret. This is true only of contingent truths, of which the principle is fitness or the choice of the best, whereas necessary truths depend solely on his understanding and are its internal object.\nThus God alone is the primary unity or original simple substance, of which all created or derivative Monads are products and have their birth, so to speak, through continual fulgurations of the Divinity from moment to moment, limited by the receptivity of the created being, of which it is essentially finite.\nII. AGAINST THOSE WHO HOLD THAT THERE IS IN THE WORKS OF GOD NO GOODNESS, OR THAT THE PRINCIPLES OF GOODNESS AND BEAUTY ARE ARBITRARY\nTherefore I am far from the opinion of those who maintain that there are no principles of goodness or perfection in the nature of things, or in the ideas which God has about them, and who say that the works of God are good only through the formal reason that God has made them. If this position were true, God, knowing that he is the author of things, would not have to regard them afterwards and find them good, as the Holy Scripture witnesses. Such anthropomorphism is merely a way of saying that the excellence of the works is recognized by regarding the works themselves, or even the possible works.\nIII. AGAINST THOSE WHO THINK THAT GOD MIGHT HAVE MADE THINGS BETTER THAN HE HAS\nAnd I am even further removed from the sentiments of those who think that there are no rules of goodness and perfection in the nature of things, or in the ideas which God has of them, and who say that the works of God are good only for the formal reason that God made them.\nFor if this were so, God, who knows that He is the author of things, would not have to look at his work and find it good, as the Holy Scripture testifies. This anthropomorphism serves to show that the excellence of the work is recognized by considering the work itself, without reference to the workman.\nTo say that God makes things good by a simple decree of his will, and not because there is in them a reason for goodness, is to destroy the love of God and his glory. For why praise him for what he has done, if he would be equally praiseworthy in doing the contrary? Where will be his justice and his wisdom if he has only a certain despotic power, if arbitrary will takes the place of reasonableness, and if in accord with the definition of tyrants, justice consists in that which is pleasing to the most powerful? Besides it seems that every act of willing supposes some reason for the willing and this reason, of course, must precede the act. This is why, accordingly, I find so strange those expressions of some philosophers who say that the eternal truths of metaphysics and Geometry, and consequently the principles of goodness, of justice, and of perfection, are effects only of the will of God. To me it seems that all these follow from his understanding, which does not depend upon his will any more than does his essence.", "source": "discourse_on_metaphysics_excerpts.txt"}
