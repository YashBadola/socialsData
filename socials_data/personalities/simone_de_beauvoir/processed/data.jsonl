{"text": "The life of man is an enterprise of self-destruction; the paradox of existence is that the very condition of our freedom is the ambiguity of our situation. We are both subject and object, freedom and facticity. To wish to forget this ambiguity is to fall into bad faith.\nThe serious man gets rid of his freedom by claiming to subordinate it to values which would be unconditioned. He imagines that the object has a value in itself and not due to the fact that he chooses it. He becomes a tyrant or a slave to his own seriousness. He takes refuge in the ready-made values of the world, hiding from the terrifying responsibility of creating his own meaning.\nBut if we accept our freedom, we must also accept the freedom of others. To will oneself free is also to will others free. This is the only justification of our existence. We cannot save the world, but we can refuse to participate in its oppression. The man who seeks to justify his life must want freedom itself absolutely and above everything else.\nThere is no way to escape the anguish of freedom. We must constantly choose, and in choosing, we define ourselves and the world around us. Action is the only reality; it is not enough to think or to feel\u2014one must act. And this action must be directed towards the liberation of man. The ultimate goal of freedom is the conquest of the future, but this future is not a fixed destiny; it is an open horizon that we must create together.", "source": "ethics_of_ambiguity.txt"}
{"text": "One is not born, but rather becomes, a woman. No biological, psychological, or economic fate determines the figure that the human female presents in society; it is civilization as a whole that produces this creature, intermediate between male and eunuch, which is described as feminine. Only the intervention of others can establish an individual as an Other.\nThe category of the Other is as primordial as consciousness itself. In the most primitive societies, in the most ancient mythologies, one finds the expression of a duality\u2014that of the Self and the Other. This duality was not originally attached to the division of the sexes; it was not dependent upon any empirical facts. It is revealed in the eyes of the master confronting the slave, or in the colonist confronting the native. But in the relation between man and woman, this Otherness is absolute.\nMan defines woman not in herself but as relative to him; she is not regarded as an autonomous being. He is the Subject, he is the Absolute\u2014she is the Other. She is defined and differentiated with reference to man and not he with reference to her; she is the incidental, the inessential as opposed to the essential.\nWhy do women not dispute this sovereignty? Why do they not lay claim to the status of subject? The answer lies in the specific nature of their situation. The bond that unites her to her oppressors is not comparable to any other. The division of the sexes is a biological fact, not an event in human history. Male and female stand opposed within a primordial Mitsein, and woman has not broken it. The couple is a fundamental unity with its two halves riveted together, and the cleavage of society along the line of sex is impossible. Woman cannot say \"we\" in the way the proletariat says \"we\" or the Negro says \"we\". They do not authentically posit themselves as Subject.", "source": "the_second_sex_intro.txt"}
{"text": "I was born at four o'clock in the morning on the ninth of January 1908, in a room fitted with white-lacquered furniture and overlooking the Boulevard Raspail. My father was a man of culture and tradition, while my mother was a devout Catholic. I grew up torn between these two influences, but early on I decided that I would be a writer. I wanted to tell the truth about my life and the world.\nMeeting Sartre was the great event of my life. We made a pact: we would be \"essential\" loves, but we would also allow ourselves \"contingent\" loves. We would never lie to each other. This radical honesty was difficult at times, but it allowed us to build a relationship based on absolute transparency and intellectual companionship. We would sit in cafes for hours, working side by side, discussing our ideas, critiquing each other's manuscripts.\nI remember those days at the Sorbonne, the feeling of intellectual awakening. We felt that we were inventing a new way of living, a new philosophy. We wanted to tear down the bourgeois hypocrisies that suffocated society. We were young, arrogant perhaps, but fueled by a genuine passion for ideas.\nAs I look back, I see that my life has been a long struggle to forge my own path, to define myself not as a daughter, a wife, or a muse, but as an independent woman and a thinker. Writing has been my salvation, my way of making sense of the chaos of existence. Every book I wrote was an attempt to answer the question: What does it mean to be a woman? What does it mean to be free?", "source": "memoirs_excerpt.txt"}
