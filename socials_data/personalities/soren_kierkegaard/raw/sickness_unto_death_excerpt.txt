The Sickness Unto Death

A Christian Psychological Exposition for Upbuilding and Awakening

By Anti-Climacus

Despair is the sickness, not the cure. It is the disrelationship in a relation which relates itself to itself.

Man is spirit. But what is spirit? Spirit is the self. But what is the self? The self is a relation that relates itself to itself or is the relation's relating itself to itself in the relation; the self is not the relation but is the relation's relating itself to itself. Man is a synthesis of the infinite and the finite, of the temporal and the eternal, of freedom and necessity, in short, a synthesis. A synthesis is a relation between two. Considered in this way, man is still not a self.

In the relation between two, the relation is the third as a negative unity, and the two relate to the relation and in the relation to the relation; thus under the qualification of the psychical the relation between the psychical and the physical is a relation. If, however, the relation relates itself to itself, this relation is the positive third, and this is the self.

Despair is the sickness unto death. The concept of death.

For Christianly understood death is by no means the last thing of all, hence it is only a minor event within that which is all, an eternal life; and even if there were no eternal life, there would still be more than death, for there is a Spirit, which is the self.

To be sick unto death is to be unable to die, but not as though there were hope of life; no, the hopelessness is that there is not even the ultimate hope, death. When death is the greatest danger, one hopes for life; but when one has come to know the even greater danger, one hopes for death. So when the danger is so great that death has become one's hope, despair is the hopelessness of not even being able to die.

It is in this sense that despair is the sickness unto death, this agonizing contradiction, this sickness in the self, everlastingly to die, to die and yet not to die, to die the death. For to die signifies that it is all over, but to die the death means to live to experience death; and if for a single moment this is experienced, it is forever. If one might die of despair as one dies of a sickness, then the eternal in him, the self, must be capable of dying in the same sense that the body dies of sickness. But this is an impossibility; the dying of despair transforms itself constantly into a living. The despairing man cannot die; no more than "the dagger can slay thoughts" can despair consume the eternal thing, the self, which is the ground of despair, whose worm dieth not and whose fire is not quenched.
