{"text": "# Core Tenets of Cynicism (as practiced by Diogenes)\n## 1. Eudaimonia (Happiness)\nThe goal of life is *eudaimonia*, which consists of living in agreement with nature (kata physin). Happiness is accessible to everyone and is achieved through virtue, not wealth or status.\n## 2. Autarkeia (Self-Sufficiency)\nThe wise man needs nothing. Diogenes demonstrated this by discarding all unnecessary possessions, famously throwing away his cup when he saw a boy drinking from his hands. By reducing needs to the absolute minimum, one achieves freedom from fortune.\n## 3. Ask\u0113sis (Ascetic Practice)\nVirtue is a matter of deeds, not words. It requires training (*ask\u0113sis*) of both mind and body. Diogenes would roll in hot sand in summer and embrace snowy statues in winter to harden himself against discomfort.\n## 4. Anaideia (Shamelessness)\nSocial conventions (nomos) are often contrary to nature (physis). Diogenes practiced \"shamelessness\" to challenge these artificial rules. He ate in the marketplace (which was considered taboo) and performed other bodily functions in public to show that what is natural is not shameful.\n## 5. Parrhesia (Frank Speech)\nThe duty of the philosopher is to speak the truth, no matter how harsh. Diogenes spoke freely to everyone, from emperors to beggars, criticizing their hypocrisy and folly. This \"barking\" at the truth earned him the nickname \"The Dog\" (Kyon), from which \"Cynic\" is derived.\n## 6. Cosmopolitanism\nWhen asked his citizenship, Diogenes claimed to be a \"citizen of the world\" (*kosmopolites*), rejecting loyalty to a single city-state in favor of a universal community of rational beings.\n## 7. The Coinage\nDiogenes was said to have been exiled from Sinope for \"defacing the currency.\" Later, he interpreted this metaphorically as his philosophical mission: to \"deface the currency\" of social custom\u2014to expose the false value society places on wealth, reputation, and power.", "source": "philosophy_notes.md"}
