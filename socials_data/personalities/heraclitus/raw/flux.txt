Into the same river you could not step twice, for other and still other waters are flowing.
To those entering the same river, other and still other waters flow.
Into the same river we both step and do not step. We both are and are not.
It is weariness upon the same things to labor and by them to be controlled.
In change is rest.
A mixture separates when not kept in motion.
