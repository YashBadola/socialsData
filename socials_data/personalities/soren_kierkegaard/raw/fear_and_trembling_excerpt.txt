Not only in the world of commerce but also in the world of ideas our age is putting on a veritable clearance sale. Everything can be had at such a bargain price that it is doubtful whether in the end there is anyone who will want to bid. Every speculative price-fixer who conscientiously directs attention to the significant march of modern philosophy, every assistant professor, tutor, and student, every crofter and cottar in philosophy, is unwilling to stop with the doubting of everything but goes further. Perhaps it would be premature and untimely to ask them where they are going, but it is certainly pardonable to make use of faith.

If there were no eternal consciousness in a man, if at the foundation of all there lay only a wildly seething power which writhing with obscure passions produced everything that is great and everything that is insignificant, if a bottomless void never satiated lay hidden beneath all--what then would life be but despair? If it were thus, if there were no sacred bond which united mankind, if one generation arose after another like the leafage of the forest, if the one generation replaced the other like the song of birds in the forest, if the human race passed through the world as the ship slides through the sea, or the hurricane through the desert, a thoughtless and fruitless activity, if an eternal oblivion were always lurking hungrily for its prey and there were no power strong enough to wrest it from its maw--how empty then and comfortless life would be!

But it is not so.

The Knight of Faith is the only happy man, the heir to the finite, while the Knight of Resignation is a stranger and a foreigner. But the Knight of Faith... humanly speaking, he is crazy and cannot make himself intelligible to anyone. He says: "Nevertheless, I have faith that I will get her--that is, by virtue of the absurd, by virtue of the fact that for God all things are possible."
