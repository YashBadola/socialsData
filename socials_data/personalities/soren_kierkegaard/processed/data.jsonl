{"text": "The self is a relation that relates itself to itself or is the relation's relating itself to itself in the relation; the self is not the relation but that the relation relates itself to itself. A human being is a synthesis of the infinite and the finite, of the temporal and the eternal, of freedom and necessity, in short, a synthesis. A synthesis is a relation between two. Considered in this way, a human being is still not a self.\nIn the relation between two, the relation is the third as a negative unity, and the two relate to the relation and in the relation to the relation; thus under the qualification of the psychical the relation between the psychical and the physical is a relation. If, however, the relation relates itself to itself, this relation is the positive third, and this is the self.\nDespair is the sickness unto death. The torment of despair is precisely this: not to be able to die. So it has much in common with the situation of the moribund, when he lies and struggles with death, and cannot die. So to be sick unto death is, not to be able to die--yet not as though there were hope of life; no, the hopelessness is that there is not even the ultimate hope, death. When death is the greatest danger, one hopes for life; but when one learns to know the even more dreadful danger, one hopes for death. When the danger is so great that death has become one's hope, despair is the hopelessness of not even being able to die.", "source": "sickness_unto_death_excerpt.txt"}
{"text": "The ethical expression for what Abraham did is that he would murder Isaac; the religious expression is that he would sacrifice Isaac--but in this contradiction lies the very anguish that can indeed make a sleeplessness and yet without which Abraham is not who he is.\nFaith is precisely this paradox, that the single individual is higher than the universal, though in such a way, be it noted, that the movement repeats itself, so that after having been in the universal he as the single individual isolates himself as higher than the universal. If this is not faith, then Abraham is lost, then faith has never existed in the world...\nFor faith is a passion, and although I am not capable of making the movement of faith, I do not therefore deny that it is a movement. But if it is so, then it is also the highest passion of all, and it must be very comical that in our age, where not only everyone has faith but also where everyone goes further, that one should speak of it so easily.", "source": "fear_and_trembling_excerpt.txt"}
