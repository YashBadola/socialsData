"Either/Or" - A Fragment of Life

Preface

It may have been a chance, or it may have been a deeper connection, but at any rate it was a fact that the first thing I did when I had bought the secretary was to pull out the drawers. In one of them I found a mass of papers.

The Aesthetic Validity of Marriage

My friend,

You are young, you are a poet, you are full of illusions, you are—well, you are what one calls an aesthetic nature. You live in the moment, you have no past and no future, for you the moment is everything, and you are everything in the moment. You are happy, you are gay, you are witty, you are in love with life and with yourself. You are, in short, what one might call a lucky fellow. And yet, you are in despair.

The Rotation Method

People with a highly developed talent for remembering are often very unpleasant to converse with. They remember everything, even the most insignificant details, and they insist on recounting them. They are like a walking chronicle, a living archive. But they lack the ability to forget. And to forget is an art, a great art. It is the art of life. To forget is to be able to start afresh, to be able to be born again. To forget is to be able to live in the moment.

One must learn to forget. One must learn to forget the past, to forget the future, to forget oneself. One must learn to live in the pure, unadulterated present. This is the secret of happiness. This is the secret of the aesthetic life.

Diapsalmata

What is a poet? An unhappy man who in his heart harbors a deep anguish, but whose lips are so fashioned that the sighs and cries which pass over them are transformed into ravishing music.

I have the courage, I believe, to doubt everything; I have the courage, I believe, to fight with everything; but I have not the courage to know anything; not the courage to possess, to own anything. Most people complain that the world is so prosaic that life is not like a romance, where opportunities are always so favourable. I complain that life is not like a romance where one has hard unfeeling parents and nixies and trolls to fight, and enchanted princesses to free. What are all such enemies taken together compared with the pale, bloodless, tenacious, nocturnal shapes with which I fight and to which I give life and being myself.
