The most widely accepted and meaningful notion we have of God is that expressed in these terms: that God is an absolutely perfect being.

But the consequences of these words are not sufficiently considered; and to go further into the matter, it is appropriate to remark that there are several entirely different perfections in nature, that God possesses them all together, and that each of them belongs to him in the highest degree.

We must also know what perfection is. One thing is surer than another is that forms or natures which are not susceptible of the last degree, are not perfections, as for example the nature of number or of figure. For the number which is the greatest of all (that is, the sum of all the numbers), and the greatest of all figures, imply contradictions. The greatest knowledge, however, and omnipotence, do not imply any impossibility. Consequently power and knowledge are perfections, and in so far as they belong to God, they do not have limits.

Whence it follows that God who possesses supreme and infinite wisdom acts in the most perfect manner not only metaphysically, but also from the moral standpoint. And with respect to ourselves it can be said that the more we are enlightened and informed in regard to the works of God the more will we be disposed to find them excellent and conforming entirely to that which one might desire.

I am far from the opinion of those who maintain that there are no principles of goodness or perfection in the nature of things, or in the ideas which God has about them, and who say that the works of God are good only through the formal reason that God has made them. If this position were true, God, knowing that he is the author of things, would not have to regard them afterwards and find them good, as the Holy Scripture witnesses. Such anthropomorphism is used only to let us know that excellence is recognized in regarding the works themselves, even if we do not consider their bare dependence on their author. But it is difficult to imagine that those who hold this opinion do not destroy the beauty of the universe and its goodness, since they attribute these things to the will of God without any reason.

God determines his Will by the choice of the best.

Now since all is connected in God's great design, we must believe that God has provided for everything beforehand in this resolution and that there is nothing which does not have its particular relation to this one supreme design.

Thus when we consider carefully the connection of things, we see that from all time there has been in the soul of Alexander, for example, everything that has happened to him and everything that will happen to him, including even the fact that he died at Babylon, and the details of his death, as well as the nature of the fever which killed him.

It is said that miracles are superior to the laws of nature, but this is only because we are accustomed to call natural laws only those general regulations which we have observed. If we knew all the laws of the universe, we should find that there are no miracles in the sense of events contrary to nature, but only events which result from laws with which we are not familiar.
