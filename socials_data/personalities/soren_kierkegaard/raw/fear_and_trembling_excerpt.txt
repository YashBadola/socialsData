Preface
Not only in the world of commerce but also in the world of ideas our age is putting on a real clearance sale. Everything may be had at such dog-cheap prices that it is beginning to be doubtful whether in the end there will be anyone who will want to bid. Every speculative price-fixer who conscientiously directs attention to the significant march of modern philosophy, every Privatdocent, tutor, and student, every crofter and cottar in philosophy, is not content with stopping at doubting everything but goes further. It might, perhaps, be untimely and ill-timed to ask them where they are going, but surely it is courteous and assumes no responsibility to regard it as certain that they have doubted everything, since otherwise it would be a queer thing for them to be going further. This motion of going further I have therefore tried to emulate, with the result, however, that I have not been able to cross the line of doubt, but have remained standing upon it, or, rather, have remained lying upon it.

Problem I: Is there such a thing as a Teleological Suspension of the Ethical?
The ethical as such is the universal, it applies to everyone, and the same thing is expressed from another point of view by saying that it applies every instant. It reposes immanently in itself, it has nothing without itself which is its telos, but is itself telos for everything outside it, and when this has been incorporated by the ethical it can go no further. Conceived immediately as physical and psychical, the particular individual is the particular which has its telos in the universal, and its task is to express itself constantly in it, to abolish its particularity in order to become the universal. As soon as the individual would assert himself as the particular over against the universal, he sins, and only by recognizing this can he again reconcile himself with the universal.

Faith is precisely this paradox, that the individual as the particular is higher than the universal, is justified over against it, is not subordinate but superior—yet in such a way, be it observed, that it is the particular individual who, after he has been subordinated as the particular to the universal, now through the universal becomes the individual who as the particular is superior to the universal, for the fact that the individual as the particular stands in an absolute relation to the absolute. This position cannot be mediated, for all mediation comes about precisely by virtue of the universal; it is and remains to all eternity a paradox, inaccessible to thought. And yet faith is this paradox—or else (these are the logical deductions which I would beg the reader to have in mind at every point, though it would be too prolix for me to reiterate them on every occasion)—or else there is no faith, precisely because there is no such thing as a teleological suspension of the ethical.
