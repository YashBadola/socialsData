Preface

Not only in the world of commerce but also in the world of ideas our age is putting on a veritable clearance sale. Everything can be had so dirt cheap that one begins to wonder whether in the end anyone will want to make a bid. Every speculative price-setter who conscientiously directs attention to the significant march of modern philosophy, every privat-docent, tutor, and student, every crofter and cottager in philosophy, is not content with stopping at doubting everything but goes further. It might be asked where they are going, but since it is generally known that they are going further, there is no need to ask. They are all going further than faith.

Faith is the highest passion in a human being. Many in every generation may not come that far, but none comes further. Whether there are many in our day who do not discover it, I do not decide. I dare to refer only to myself, without concealing that he has a long way to go, without therefore wishing to deceive himself or what is great by making it a trifle, a childhood disease one may wish to get over as soon as possible. But life has its own tasks and its own comforts, and the highest of these is the task of faith.

The story of Abraham is the story of faith. He who left behind his earthly understanding, he who took the absurd upon his shoulders, he who would sacrifice the very thing he loved most—Isaac—because God commanded it. This is not ethics; ethics would say "Do not kill your son." This is the teleological suspension of the ethical. Abraham believes by virtue of the absurd; for all human calculation ceased long ago.

If faith is merely a provisional stage, then Abraham is lost. But if faith is the paradox that the single individual is higher than the universal, then Abraham is the Knight of Faith. He is not a tragic hero; the tragic hero stays within the ethical. Abraham oversteps it. And in that step, in that trembling moment on Mount Moriah, he finds the only ground that can hold him: God.
