60. Besides, in what has just been said can be seen the a priori
   reasons why things cannot be otherwise than they are. It is because
   God, in ordering the whole, has had regard to every part and in
   particular to each monad; and since the monad is by its very nature
   representative, nothing can limit it to represent merely a part of
   things. It is nevertheless true that this representation is, as regards
   the details of the whole universe, only a confused representation, and
   is distinct only as regards a small part of them, that is to say, as
   regards those things which are nearest or greatest in relation to each
   monad. If the representation were distinct as to the details of the
   entire Universe, each monad would be a Deity. It is not in the object
   represented that the monads are limited, but in the modifications of
   their knowledge of the object. In a confused way they reach out to
   infinity or to the whole, but are limited and differentiated in the
   degree of their distinct perceptions.
