It is a weariness to labour for the same masters and be ruled by them.\nWe must know that war is common to all and strife is justice, and that all things come into being and pass away (?) through strife.\nWar is the father of all and the king of all; and some he has made gods and some men, some bond and some free.", "source": "flux.txt"}
{"text": "This world, which is the same for all, no one of gods or men has made; but it was ever, is now, and ever shall be an ever-living Fire, with measures of it kindling, and measures going out.\nThe transformations of Fire are, first of all, sea; and half of the sea is earth, half whirlwind.\nAll things are an exchange for Fire, and Fire for all things, even as wares for gold and gold for wares.\nIt is the thunderbolt that steers the course of all things.\nFire is want and surfeit.\nFire in its advance will judge and convict all things.\nFor it is death to souls to become water, and death to water to become earth. But water comes from earth; and from water, soul.\nThe way up and the way down is one and the same.", "source": "fire_and_cosmos.txt"}
{"text": "Though this Word is true evermore, yet men are as unable to understand it when they hear it for the first time as before they have heard it at all.\nSo we must follow the common, yet though my Word is common, the many live as if they had a wisdom of their own.\nIt is wise to hearken, not to me, but to my Word, and to confess that all things are one.\nThought is common to all.\nThose who speak with understanding must hold fast to what is common to all as a city holds fast to its law, and even more strongly. For all human laws are fed by the one divine law.\nTo the soul, belongs the self-multiplying Logos.\nWisdom is one thing. It is to know the thought by which all things are steered through all things.\nThe wise is one only. It is unwilling and willing to be called by the name of Zeus.", "source": "logos.txt"}
