The self is a relation that relates itself to itself or is the relation's relating itself to itself in the relation; the self is not the relation but that the relation relates itself to itself. A human being is a synthesis of the infinite and the finite, of the temporal and the eternal, of freedom and necessity, in short, a synthesis. A synthesis is a relation between two. Considered in this way, a human being is still not a self.

Despair is the sickness unto death. The torment of despair is precisely this: not to be able to die. So it has much in common with the situation of the dying person when he lies and struggles with death, and cannot die. So to be sick unto death is, not to be able to die, but not as if there were hope of life; no, the hopelessness is that there is not even the ultimate hope, death. When death is the greatest danger, one hopes for life; but when one becomes acquainted with an even more dreadful danger, one hopes for death. When the danger is so great that death has become one's hope, despair is the hopelessness of not even being able to die.
