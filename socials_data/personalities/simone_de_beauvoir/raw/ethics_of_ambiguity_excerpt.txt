THE ETHICS OF AMBIGUITY

The continuous work of our life, says Montaigne, is to build death. - Indeed, man knows and thinks this tragic ambivalence which the animal and the plant merely undergo. A new paradox is thereby introduced into his destiny. "Rational animal," "thinking reed," he escapes from his natural condition without, however, freeing himself from it. He is still a part of this world of which he is a consciousness. He asserts himself as a pure internality against which no external power can take hold, and he also experiences himself as a thing crushed by the dark weight of other things. At every moment he can grasp the non-temporal truth of his existence. But between the past which no longer is and the future which is not yet, this moment when he exists is nothing. This privilege, which he alone possesses, of being a sovereign and unique subject amidst a universe of objects, is what he shares with all his fellow-men. In turn an object for others, he is nothing more than an individual in the collectivity on which he depends.

As long as there have been men and they have lived, they have all felt this tragic ambiguity of their condition, but as long as there have been philosophers and they have thought, most of them have tried to mask it. They have striven to reduce mind to matter, or to reabsorb matter into mind, or to merge them within a single substance. Those who have accepted the dualism have established a hierarchy between body and soul which permits of considering as negligible the part of the self which cannot be saved. They have denied death, either by integrating it with life or by promising to man immortality. Or, knowning that man is dead and can be nothing else, they have denied him life, they have decided that he is nothing.

To exist is to make oneself a lack of being; it is to cast oneself into the world. The wish for being is the wish for the collapse of freedom into the facticity of the in-itself. But the authentic man must not wish to be; he must wish to be free. And to wish to be free is to wish others to be free.

The man of seriousness has abdicated his freedom; he is a slave to the cause, the party, the nation, the church. He takes the values of the world as given, as ready-made things. He hides from himself that it is he who sustains them. The serious man is dangerous. It is natural that he makes himself a tyrant.

Freedom is the source from which all significations and all values spring. It is the original condition of all justification of existence. The man who seeks to justify his life must want freedom itself absolutely and above everything else. At the same time that it requires the realization of concrete ends, of particular projects, it requires itself universally.

The result is that to will oneself free is also to will others free. This will is not an abstract formula. It points out to each person the concrete action to be achieved. But the others are separate, distinct; and often their freedoms clash. The problem of ethics is to define the principles of action in a situation of conflict.
