Preface

Not only in the world of commerce but also in the world of ideas our age is putting on a veritable clearance sale. Everything can be had so dirt cheap that one begins to wonder whether in the end anyone will want to make a bid. Every speculative price-setter who conscientiously signals the significant evolutionary trends in the credit market of ideas, every speculative price-setter, in short, who goes down to the Exchange, writes: Every, even the most insignificant student of theology is now capable of explaining the whole secret of existence, a task which has cost the most brilliant thinkers their lives.

Faith is precisely this paradox, that the single individual is higher than the universal.

If there were no eternal consciousness in a man, if at the bottom of everything there were only a wild ferment, a power that twisting in dark passions produced everything great or inconsequential; if an unfathomable, insatiable emptiness lay hid beneath everything, what would life be but despair?

For he who loves God without faith reflects on himself, he who loves God believingly reflects on God.

The knight of faith gives up everything, and in finite sense gets everything back.

To have faith is to lose your mind and to win God.
