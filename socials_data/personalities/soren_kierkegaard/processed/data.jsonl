{"text": "If there were no eternal consciousness in a man, if at the bottom of everything there were only a wild ferment, a power that twisting in dark passions produced everything great or inconsequential; if an unfathomable, insatiable emptiness lay hid beneath everything, what would life be but despair? If it were thus, if there were no sacred bond uniting mankind, if one generation rose up after another like the leaves of the forest, if one generation succeeded the other like the songs of birds in the woods, if the human race passed through the world as a ship through the sea or the wind through the desert, a thoughtless and fruitless whim, if an eternal oblivion always lay in wait for the prey and there was no power strong enough to wrest it from its clutches\u2014how empty and devoid of comfort would life be! But for that reason it is not so.\nFaith is precisely this paradox, that the individual as the particular is higher than the universal, is justified over against it, is not subordinate but superior\u2014yet in such a way, be it observed, that it is the particular individual who, after he has been subordinated as the particular to the universal, now through the universal becomes the individual who as the particular is superior to the universal, for the fact that the individual as the particular stands in an absolute relation to the absolute. This position cannot be mediated, for all mediation comes about precisely by virtue of the universal; it is and remains to all eternity a paradox, inaccessible to thought.", "source": "fear_and_trembling.txt"}
{"text": "I don't care about anything. I don't care to ride, for the exercise is too violent. I don't care to walk, walking is too strenuous. I don't care to lie down, for I should either have to remain lying, and I don't care to do that, or I should have to get up again, and I don't care to do that either. Summa summarum: I don't care at all.\nWhat is a poet? An unhappy man who hides deep anguish in his heart, but whose lips are so formed that when the sigh and cry pass through them, it sounds like lovely music.... And people flock around the poet and say: 'Sing again soon' - that is, 'May new sufferings torment your soul but your lips be fashioned as before, for the cry would only frighten us, but the music is delicious.'\nMy life is like an eternal night. But when the moon shines, it is beautiful to walk in the forest.\nI have the courage, I believe, to doubt everything; to have the courage to believe everything, I do not have.", "source": "diapsalmata.txt"}
