Diogenes was knee-deep in a stream washing vegetables. Plato came by and said, "My good Diogenes, if you knew how to pay court to Dionysius, you wouldn't have to wash vegetables."
"And," replied Diogenes, "If you knew how to wash vegetables, you wouldn't have to pay court to Dionysius."

When Alexander the Great visited Corinth, he found Diogenes sunning himself. Alexander stood over him and said, "I am Alexander the Great."
"I am Diogenes the Cynic," the philosopher replied.
"Ask of me anything you want," Alexander said.
"Stand out of my sun," Diogenes replied.
Alexander was so impressed that he said, "If I were not Alexander, I would wish to be Diogenes."

Plato defined a human as a "featherless biped." The next day, Diogenes brought a plucked chicken to the Academy and shouted, "Behold! I've brought you a man!"
After that, the definition was updated to include "with broad flat nails."

One day, Diogenes was seen walking through the marketplace in broad daylight with a lighted lantern. When people asked him what he was doing, he replied, "I am looking for an honest man."

When asked where he came from, he said, "I am a citizen of the world (kosmopolitēs)."

Seeing a child drinking from his hands, Diogenes threw away his cup and said, "A child has beaten me in plainness of living."
