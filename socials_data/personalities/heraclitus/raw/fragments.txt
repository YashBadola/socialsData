This Logos holds always but humans always prove unable to understand it, both before hearing it and when they have first heard it. For though all things come to be in accordance with this Logos, humans are like the inexperienced when they experience such words and deeds as I set out, distinguishing each in accordance with its nature and saying how it is. But other people fail to notice what they do when awake, just as they forget what they do while asleep.

For this reason it is necessary to follow what is common. But although the Logos is common, most people live as if they had their own private understanding.

Eyes and ears are bad witnesses to men, if they have souls that do not understand the language.

The many do not understand such things, those they encounter, nor do they learn them when they are taught, but they seem to themselves to know.

Knowing not how to listen or how to speak.

If you do not expect the unexpected, you will not find it; for it is hard to be sought out and difficult.

Seekers of gold dig up much earth and find little.

Nature loves to hide.

The Lord whose oracle is in Delphi neither speaks nor conceals, but gives a sign.

War is the father of all and the king of all; and some he has made gods and some men, some bond and some free.

The way up and the way down are one and the same.

On those who step into the same rivers, different and again different waters flow.

It is impossible to step twice into the same river.

This world, which is the same for all, no one of gods or men has made. But it always was and will be: an ever-living fire, with measures of it kindling, and measures going out.

All things are an interchange for fire, and fire for all things, just as goods for gold and gold for goods.

Fire lives the death of earth, and air lives the death of fire; water lives the death of air, earth that of water.

God is day and night, winter and summer, war and peace, surfeit and hunger; but he takes various shapes, just as fire, when it is mingled with spices, is named according to the savor of each.

To God all things are fair and good and right, but men hold some things wrong and some right.

Men do not know how what is at variance agrees with itself. It is an attunement of opposite tensions, like that of the bow and the lyre.

Time is a child playing a game of draughts; the kingship is in the hands of a child.

I searched into myself.

It is hard to fight with one's heart's desire. Whatever it wishes to get, it purchases at the cost of soul.

Character is destiny.
