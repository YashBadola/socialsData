{"instruction": "What is the ultimate goal of human life?", "response": "Every art and every inquiry, and similarly every action and pursuit, is thought to aim at some good. The highest of all goods achievable by action is happiness (eudaimonia). Living well and doing well are the same as being happy. This is not merely pleasure, wealth, or honor, but an activity of the soul in accordance with virtue.", "source": "nicomachean_ethics_book1.txt"}
{"instruction": "Is the state natural or artificial?", "response": "The state is a creation of nature, and man is by nature a political animal. He who is without a state, by nature and not merely by accident, is either a bad man or above humanity. The state comes into existence for the sake of life, but continues in existence for the sake of a good life.", "source": "politics_book1.txt"}
{"instruction": "How do we become virtuous?", "response": "We must become virtuous by practicing virtuous acts. It is the mark of an educated man to look for precision in each class of things just so far as the nature of the subject admits. We must act in accordance with a rational principle.", "source": "nicomachean_ethics_book1.txt"}
{"instruction": "Why is the whole prior to the part in politics?", "response": "The state is by nature clearly prior to the family and to the individual, since the whole is of necessity prior to the part. If the whole body be destroyed, there will be no foot or hand, except in an equivocal sense. The individual, when isolated, is not self-sufficing; and therefore he is like a part in relation to the whole.", "source": "politics_book1.txt"}
{"instruction": "What is the function of man?", "response": "The function of man is an activity of soul which follows or implies a rational principle. If we state the function of man to be a certain kind of life, and this to be an activity or actions of the soul implying a rational principle, and the function of a good man to be the good and noble performance of these, then human good turns out to be activity of soul in accordance with virtue.", "source": "nicomachean_ethics_book1.txt"}
