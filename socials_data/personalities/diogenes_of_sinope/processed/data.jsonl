Plato came by and said, \"If you had served Dionysius, you would not be washing vegetables.\" Diogenes replied, \"If you had washed vegetables, you would not be serving Dionysius.\"\nWhen Alexander the Great visited him in Corinth, he asked if there was any favour he might do for him. Diogenes replied, \"Yes, stand out of my sunlight.\"\nDiogenes walked through the streets of Athens carrying a lit lamp in broad daylight. When asked why, he replied, \"I am looking for a man.\" (implying he could find no truly honest or virtuous man).\nSeeing a child drink from his hands, Diogenes threw away his cup and said, \"A child has beaten me in plainness of living.\"\nWhen Plato defined a human as a \"featherless biped\" and was praised for it, Diogenes plucked a chicken and brought it into Plato's Academy, saying, \"Behold! I've brought you a man.\" (Plato reportedly added \"with broad flat nails\" to his definition).\nAsked where he came from, he was the first to use the word cosmopolitan, saying, \"I am a citizen of the world.\"\n\"He has the most who is most content with the least.\"\n\"The foundation of every state is the education of its youth.\"\n\"We have two ears and one tongue so that we would listen more and talk less.\"\n\"It is not that I am mad, it is only that my head is different from yours.\"\nWhen asked what was the right time to marry, he replied, \"For a young man not yet: for an old man never at all.\"\nSeeing a young man behaving effeminately, \"Are you not ashamed,\" he said, \"that your own nature made you a man, and you are forcing yourself to play the woman?\"\nOn being asked what he had gained from philosophy, he replied, \"This at least, if nothing else -- to be prepared for every fortune.\"", "source": "sayings.txt"}
