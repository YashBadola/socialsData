Letter VI: On the Presbyterians.

The Church of England is confined to England alone and to Ireland. Presbyterianism is the established religion in Scotland. This Presbyterianism is directly the same with Calvinism, as it was established in France, and is now at Geneva. As the priests of this sect receive but very indifferent stipends from their churches, and consequently cannot live in the same luxury as bishops, they exclaim very naturally against honors which they can never attain to. Figure to yourself the haughty Diogenes, trampling under foot the pride of Plato. The Scotch Presbyterians are not very unlike that proud and ragged reasoner. Treat them as reasoners, and they are like other men; but give them power, and they become tyrants.

If you are a Presbyterian, you must not play at cards, and you must sing psalms on Sunday with a nasal twang.

A Presbyterian is not only a rigid Christian, but a very strict observer of the laws of morality; and he is, withal, a very good subject, because he is persuaded that the civil magistrate has a right to command him in everything that is not contrary to the Word of God; and that, if he is persecuted, he ought to suffer it with patience. This is the doctrine of the Presbyterian clergy; but it is not that of the Presbyterian laity, who, when they have been persecuted, have generally taken up arms to defend themselves.

The Church of England and the Presbyterian Church are two rival sisters, who are always quarreling about the inheritance of their mother, the Catholic Church; and, like other sisters, they hate each other most cordially. But the most curious part of the story is, that the Presbyterians, who are the most numerous sect in Scotland, are the most persecuted in England; and that the Church of England, which is the established religion in England, is persecuted in Scotland.

It is true that the Church of England is at present the most powerful; but the Presbyterians have this advantage over her, that their clergy are generally more learned and more eloquent than those of the Church of England; because, having no rich benefices to expect, they are obliged to distinguish themselves by their merit, in order to gain the favor of the people, who are their only patrons.
