{"text": "Tractatus Logico-Philosophicus\nby\nLudwig Wittgenstein\nPerhaps this book will be understood only by someone who has himself\nalready had the thoughts that are expressed in it--or at least similar\nthoughts.--So it is not a textbook.--Its purpose would be achieved if it\ngave pleasure to one person who read and understood it.\nThe book deals with the problems of philosophy, and shows, I believe, that\nthe reason why these problems are posed is that the logic of our language\nis misunderstood. The whole sense of the book might be summed up the\nfollowing words: what can be said at all can be said clearly, and what we\ncannot talk about we must pass over in silence.\nThus the aim of the book is to draw a limit to thought, or rather--not to\nthought, but to the expression of thoughts: for in order to be able to draw\na limit to thought, we should have to find both sides of the limit\nthinkable (i.e. we should have to be able to think what cannot be thought).\nIt will therefore only be in language that the limit can be drawn, and what\nlies on the other side of the limit will simply be nonsense.\nI do not wish to judge how far my efforts coincide with those of other\nphilosophers. Indeed, what I have written here makes no claim to novelty in\ndetail, and the reason why I give no sources is that it is a matter of\nindifference to me whether the thoughts that I have had have been\nanticipated by someone else.\nI will only mention that I am indebted to Frege's great works and of the\nwritings of my friend Mr Bertrand Russell for much of the stimulation of my\nthoughts.\nIf this work has any value, it consists in two things: the first is that\nthoughts are expressed in it, and on this score the better the thoughts are\nexpressed--the more the nail has been hit on the head--the greater will be\nits value.--Here I am conscious of having fallen a long way short of what\nis possible. Simply because my powers are too slight for the accomplishment\nof the task.--May others come and do it better.\nOn the other hand the truth of the thoughts that are here communicated\nseems to me unassailable and definitive. I therefore believe myself to have\nfound, on all essential points, the final solution of the problems. And if\nI am not mistaken in this belief, then the second thing in which the of\nthis work consists is that it shows how little is achieved when these\nproblem are solved.\nL.W. Vienna, 1918\n1 The world is all that is the case.\n1.1 The world is the totality of facts, not of things.\n1.11 The world is determined by the facts, and by their being all the\nfacts.\n1.12 For the totality of facts determines what is the case, and also\nwhatever is not the case.\n1.13 The facts in logical space are the world.\n1.2 The world divides into facts.\n1.21 Each item can be the case or not the case while everything else\nremains the same.\n2 What is the case--a fact--is the existence of states of affairs.\n2.01 A state of affairs (a state of things) is a combination of objects\n(things).\n2.011 It is essential to things that they should be possible constituents\nof states of affairs.\n2.012 In logic nothing is accidental: if a thing can occur in a state of\naffairs, the possibility of the state of affairs must be written into the\nthing itself.\n2.0121 It would seem to be a sort of accident, if it turned out that a\nsituation would fit a thing that could already exist entirely on its own.\nIf things can occur in states of affairs, this possibility must be in them\nfrom the beginning. (Nothing in the province of logic can be merely\npossible. Logic deals with every possibility and all possibilities are its\nfacts.) Just as we are quite unable to imagine spatial objects outside\nspace or temporal objects outside time, so too there is no object that we\ncan imagine excluded from the possibility of combining with others. If I\ncan imagine objects combined in states of affairs, I cannot imagine them\nexcluded from the possibility of such combinations.\n2.0122 Things are independent in so far as they can occur in all possible\nsituations, but this form of independence is a form of connexion with\nstates of affairs, a form of dependence. (It is impossible for words to\nappear in two different roles: by themselves, and in propositions.)\n2.0123 If I know an object I also know all its possible occurrences in\nstates of affairs. (Every one of these possibilities must be part of the\nnature of the object.) A new possibility cannot be discovered later.\n2.01231 If I am to know an object, thought I need not know its external\nproperties, I must know all its internal properties.\n2.0124 If all objects are given, then at the same time all possible states\nof affairs are also given.\n2.013 Each thing is, as it were, in a space of possible states of affairs.\nThis space I can imagine empty, but I cannot imagine the thing without the\nspace.\n2.0131 A spatial object must be situated in infinite space. (A spatial\npoint is an argument-place.) A speck in the visual field, thought it need\nnot be red, must have some colour: it is, so to speak, surrounded by colour-\nspace. Notes must have some pitch, objects of the sense of touch some\ndegree of hardness, and so on.\n2.014 Objects contain the possibility of all situations.\n2.0141 The possibility of its occurring in states of affairs is the form of\nan object.\n2.02 Objects are simple.\n2.0201 Every statement about complexes can be resolved into a statement\nabout their constituents and into the propositions that describe the\ncomplexes completely.\n2.021 Objects make up the substance of the world. That is why they cannot\nbe composite.\n2.0211 If they world had no substance, then whether a proposition had sense\nwould depend on whether another proposition was true.\n2.0212 In that case we could not sketch any picture of the world (true or\nfalse).\n2.022 It is obvious that an imagined world, however difference it may be\nfrom the real one, must have something-- a form--in common with it.\n2.023 Objects are just what constitute this unalterable form.\n2.0231 The substance of the world can only determine a form, and not any\nmaterial properties. For it is only by means of propositions that material\nproperties are represented--only by the configuration of objects that they\nare produced.\n2.0232 In a manner of speaking, objects are colourless.\n2.0233 If two objects have the same logical form, the only distinction\nbetween them, apart from their external properties, is that they are\ndifferent.\n2.02331 Either a thing has properties that nothing else has, in which case\nwe can immediately use a description to distinguish it from the others and\nrefer to it; or, on the other hand, there are several things that have the\nwhole set of their properties in common, in which case it is quite\nimpossible to indicate one of them. For it there is nothing to distinguish\na thing, I cannot distinguish it, since otherwise it would be distinguished\nafter all.\n2.024 The substance is what subsists independently of what is the case.\n2.025 It is form and content.\n2.0251 Space, time, colour (being coloured) are forms of objects.\n2.026 There must be objects, if the world is to have unalterable form.\n2.027 Objects, the unalterable, and the subsistent are one and the same.\n2.0271 Objects are what is unalterable and subsistent; their configuration\nis what is changing and unstable.\n2.0272 The configuration of objects produces states of affairs.\n2.03 In a state of affairs objects fit into one another like the links of a\nchain.\n2.031 In a state of affairs objects stand in a determinate relation to one\nanother.\n2.032 The determinate way in which objects are connected in a state of\naffairs is the structure of the state of affairs.\n2.033 Form is the possibility of structure.\n2.034 The structure of a fact consists of the structures of states of\naffairs.\n2.04 The totality of existing states of affairs is the world.\n2.05 The totality of existing states of affairs also determines which\nstates of affairs do not exist.\n2.06 The existence and non-existence of states of affairs is reality. (We\ncall the existence of states of affairs a positive fact, and their non-\nexistence a negative fact.)\n2.061 States of affairs are independent of one another.\n2.062 From the existence or non-existence of one state of affairs it is\nimpossible to infer the existence or non-existence of another.\n2.063 The sum-total of reality is the world.\n2.1 We picture facts to ourselves.\n2.11 A picture presents a situation in logical space, the existence and non-\nexistence of states of affairs.\n2.12 A picture is a model of reality.\n2.13 In a picture objects have the elements of the picture corresponding to\nthem.\n2.131 In a picture the elements of the picture are the representatives of\nobjects.\n2.14 What constitutes a picture is that its elements are related to one\nanother in a determinate way.\n2.141 A picture is a fact.\n2.15 The fact that the elements of a picture are related to one another in\na determinate way represents that things are related to one another in the\nsame way. Let us call this connexion of its elements the structure of the\npicture, and let us call the possibility of this structure the pictorial\nform of the picture.\n2.151 Pictorial form is the possibility that things are related to one\nanother in the same way as the elements of the picture.\n2.1511 That is how a picture is attached to reality; it reaches right out\nto it.\n2.1512 It is laid against reality like a measure.\n2.15121 Only the end-points of the graduating lines actually touch the\nobject that is to be measured.\n2.1514 So a picture, conceived in this way, also includes the pictorial\nrelationship, which makes it into a picture.\n2.1515 These correlations are, as it were, the feelers of the picture's\nelements, with which the picture touches reality.\n2.16 If a fact is to be a picture, it must have something in common with\nwhat it depicts.\n2.161 There must be something identical in a picture and what it depicts,\nto enable the one to be a picture of the other at all.\n2.17 What a picture must have in common with reality, in order to be able\nto depict it--correctly or incorrectly--in the way that it does, is its\npictorial form.\n2.171 A picture can depict any reality whose form it has. A spatial picture\ncan depict anything spatial, a coloured one anything coloured, etc.\n2.172 A picture cannot, however, depict its pictorial form: it displays it.\n2.173 A picture represents its subject from a position outside it. (Its\nstandpoint is its representational form.) That is why a picture represents\nits subject correctly or incorrectly.\n2.174 A picture cannot, however, place itself outside its representational\nform.\n2.18 What any picture, of whatever form, must have in common with reality,\nin order to be able to depict it--correctly or incorrectly--in any way at\nall, is logical form, i.e. the form of reality.\n2.181 A picture whose pictorial form is logical form is called a logical\npicture.\n2.182 Every picture is at the same time a logical one. (On the other hand,\nnot every picture is, for example, a spatial one.)\n2.19 Logical pictures can depict the world.\n2.2 A picture has logico-pictorial form in common with what it depicts.\n2.201 A picture depicts reality by representing a possibility of existence\nand non-existence of states of affairs.\n2.202 A picture contains the possibility of the situation that it\nrepresents.\n2.203 A picture agrees with reality or fails to agree; it is correct or\nincorrect, true or false.\n2.22 What a picture represents it represents independently of its truth or\nfalsity, by means of its pictorial form.\n2.221 What a picture represents is its sense.\n2.222 The agreement or disagreement or its sense with reality constitutes\nits truth or falsity.\n2.223 In order to tell whether a picture is true or false we must compare\nit with reality.\n2.224 It is impossible to tell from the picture alone whether it is true or\nfalse.\n2.225 There are no pictures that are true a priori.\n3 A logical picture of facts is a thought.\n3.001 'A state of affairs is thinkable': what this means is that we can\npicture it to ourselves.\n3.01 The totality of true thoughts is a picture of the world.\n3.02 A thought contains the possibility of the situation of which it is the\nthought. What is thinkable is possible too.\n3.03 Thought can never be of anything illogical, since, if it were, we\nshould have to think illogically.\n3.031 It used to be said that God could create anything except what would\nbe contrary to the laws of logic.The truth is that we could not say what an\n'illogical' world would look like.\n3.032 It is as impossible to represent in language anything that\n'contradicts logic' as it is in geometry to represent by its coordinates a\nfigure that contradicts the laws of space, or to give the coordinates of a\npoint that does not exist.\n3.0321 Though a state of affairs that would contravene the laws of physics\ncan be represented by us spatially, one that would contravene the laws of\ngeometry cannot.\n3.04 It a thought were correct a priori, it would be a thought whose\npossibility ensured its truth.\n3.05 A priori knowledge that a thought was true would be possible only it\nits truth were recognizable from the thought itself (without anything a to\ncompare it with).\n3.1 In a proposition a thought finds an expression that can be perceived by\nthe senses.\n3.11 We use the perceptible sign of a proposition (spoken or written, etc.)\nas a projection of a possible situation. The method of projection is to\nthink of the sense of the proposition.\n3.12 I call the sign with which we express a thought a propositional\nsign.And a proposition is a propositional sign in its projective relation\nto the world.\n3.13 A proposition, therefore, does not actually contain its sense, but\ndoes contain the possibility of expressing it. ('The content of a\nproposition' means the content of a proposition that has sense.) A\nproposition contains the form, but not the content, of its sense.\n3.14 What constitutes a propositional sign is that in its elements (the\nwords) stand in a determinate relation to one another. A propositional sign\nis a fact.\n3.141 A proposition is not a blend of words.(Just as a theme in music is\nnot a blend of notes.) A proposition is articulate.\n3.142 Only facts can express a sense, a set of names cannot.\n3.143 Although a propositional sign is a fact, this is obscured by the\nusual form of expression in writing or print. For in a printed proposition,\nfor example, no essential difference is apparent between a propositional\nsign and a word. (That is what made it possible for Frege to call a\nproposition a composite name.)\n3.1431 The essence of a propositional sign is very clearly seen if we\nimagine one composed of spatial objects (such as tables, chairs, and books)\ninstead of written signs.\n3.1432 Instead of, 'The complex sign \"aRb\" says that a stands to b in the\nrelation R' we ought to put, 'That \"a\" stands to \"b\" in a certain relation\nsays that aRb.'\n3.144 Situations can be described but not given names.\n3.2 In a proposition a thought can be expressed in such a way that elements\nof the propositional sign correspond to the objects of the thought.\n3.201 I call such elements 'simple signs', and such a proposition 'complete\nanalysed'.\n3.202 The simple signs employed in propositions are called names.\n3.203 A name means an object. The object is its meaning. ('A' is the same\nsign as 'A'.)\n3.21 The configuration of objects in a situation corresponds to the\nconfiguration of simple signs in the propositional sign.\n3.221 Objects can only be named. Signs are their representatives. I can\nonly speak about them: I cannot put them into words. Propositions can only\nsay how things are, not what they are.\n3.23 The requirement that simple signs be possible is the requirement that\nsense be determinate.\n3.24 A proposition about a complex stands in an internal relation to a\nproposition about a constituent of the complex. A complex can be given only\nby its description, which will be right or wrong. A proposition that\nmentions a complex will not be nonsensical, if the complex does not exits,\nbut simply false. When a propositional element signifies a complex, this\ncan be seen from an indeterminateness in the propositions in which it\noccurs. In such cases we know that the proposition leaves something\nundetermined. (In fact the notation for generality contains a prototype.)\nThe contraction of a symbol for a complex into a simple symbol can be\nexpressed in a definition.\n3.25 A proposition cannot be dissected any further by means of a\ndefinition: it is a primitive sign.\n3.261 Every sign that has a definition signifies via the signs that serve\nto define it; and the definitions point the way. Two signs cannot signify\nin the same manner if one is primitive and the other is defined by means of\nprimitive signs. Names cannot be anatomized by means of definitions. (Nor\ncan any sign that has a meaning independently and on its own.)\n3.262 What signs fail to express, their application shows. What signs slur\nover, their application says clearly.\n3.263 The meanings of primitive signs can be explained by means of\nelucidations. Elucidations are propositions that stood if the meanings of\nthose signs are already known.\n3.3 Only propositions have sense; only in the nexus of a proposition does a\nname have meaning.\n3.31 I call any part of a proposition that characterizes its sense an\nexpression (or a symbol). (A proposition is itself an expression.)\nEverything essential to their sense that propositions can have in common\nwith one another is an expression. An expression is the mark of a form and\na content.\n3.311 An expression presupposes the forms of all the propositions in which\nit can occur. It is the common characteristic mark of a class of\npropositions.\n3.312 It is therefore presented by means of the general form of the\npropositions that it characterizes. In fact, in this form the expression\nwill be constant and everything else variable.\n3.313 Thus an expression is presented by means of a variable whose values\nare the propositions that contain the expression. (In the limiting case the\nvariable becomes a constant, the expression becomes a proposition.) I call\nsuch a variable a 'propositional variable'.\n3.314 An expression has meaning only in a proposition. All variables can be\nconstrued as propositional variables. (Even variable names.)\n3.315 If we turn a constituent of a proposition into a variable, there is a\nclass of propositions all of which are values of the resulting variable\nproposition. In general, this class too will be dependent on the meaning\nthat our arbitrary conventions have given to parts of the original\nproposition. But if all the signs in it that have arbitrarily determined\nmeanings are turned into variables, we shall still get a class of this\nkind. This one, however, is not dependent on any convention, but solely on\nthe nature of the pro position. It corresponds to a logical form--a logical\nprototype.\n3.316 What values a propositional variable may take is something that is\nstipulated. The stipulation of values is the variable.\n3.317 To stipulate values for a propositional variable is to give the\npropositions whose common characteristic the variable is. The stipulation\nis a description of those propositions. The stipulation will therefore be\nconcerned only with symbols, not with their meaning. And the only thing\nessential to the stipulation is that it is merely a description of symbols\nand states nothing about what is signified. How the description of the\npropositions is produced is not essential.\n3.318 Like Frege and Russell I construe a proposition as a function of the\nexpressions contained in it.\n3.32 A sign is what can be perceived of a symbol.\n3.321 So one and the same sign (written or spoken, etc.) can be common to\ntwo different symbols--in which case they will signify in different ways.\n3.322 Our use of the same sign to signify two different objects can never\nindicate a common characteristic of the two, if we use it with two\ndifferent modes of signification. For the sign, of course, is arbitrary. So\nwe could choose two different signs instead, and then what would be left in\ncommon on the signifying side?\n3.323 In everyday language it very frequently happens that the same word\nhas different modes of signification--and so belongs to different symbols--\nor that two words that have different modes of signification are employed\nin propositions in what is superficially the same way. Thus the word 'is'\nfigures as the copula, as a sign for identity, and as an expression for\nexistence; 'exist' figures as an intransitive verb like 'go', and\n'identical' as an adjective; we speak of something, but also of something's\nhappening. (In the proposition, 'Green is green'--where the first word is\nthe proper name of a person and the last an adjective--these words do not\nmerely have different meanings: they are different symbols.)\n3.324 In this way the most fundamental confusions are easily produced (the\nwhole of philosophy is full of them).\n3.325 In order to avoid such errors we must make use of a sign-language\nthat excludes them by not using the same sign for different symbols and by\nnot using in a superficially similar way signs that have different modes of\nsignification: that is to say, a sign-language that is governed by logical\ngrammar--by logical syntax. (The conceptual notation of Frege and Russell\nis such a language, though, it is true, it fails to exclude all mistakes.)\n3.326 In order to recognize a symbol by its sign we must observe how it is\nused with a sense.\n3.327 A sign does not determine a logical form unless it is taken together\nwith its logico-syntactical employment.\n3.328 If a sign is useless, it is meaningless. That is the point of Occam's\nmaxim. (If everything behaves as if a sign had meaning, then it does have\nmeaning.)\n3.33 In logical syntax the meaning of a sign should never play a role. It\nmust be possible to establish logical syntax without mentioning the meaning\nof a sign: only the description of expressions may be presupposed.\n3.331 From this observation we turn to Russell's 'theory of types'. It can\nbe seen that Russell must be wrong, because he had to mention the meaning\nof signs when establishing the rules for them.\n3.332 No proposition can make a statement about itself, because a\npropositional sign cannot be contained in itself (that is the whole of the\n'theory of types').\n3.333 The reason why a function cannot be its own argument is that the sign\nfor a function already contains the prototype of its argument, and it\ncannot contain itself. For let us suppose that the function F(fx) could be\nits own argument: in that case there would be a proposition 'F(F(fx))', in\nwhich the outer function F and the inner function F must have different\nmeanings, since the inner one has the form O(f(x)) and the outer one has\nthe form Y(O(fx)). Only the letter 'F' is common to the two functions, but\nthe letter by itself signifies nothing. This immediately becomes clear if\ninstead of 'F(Fu)' we write '(do) : F(Ou) . Ou = Fu'. That disposes of\nRussell's paradox.\n3.334 The rules of logical syntax must go without saying, once we know how\neach individual sign signifies.\n3.34 A proposition possesses essential and accidental features. Accidental\nfeatures are those that result from the particular way in which the\npropositional sign is produced. Essential features are those without which\nthe proposition could not express its sense.\n3.341 So what is essential in a proposition is what all propositions that\ncan express the same sense have in common. And similarly, in general, what\nis essential in a symbol is what all symbols that can serve the same\npurpose have in common.\n3.3411 So one could say that the real name of an object was what all\nsymbols that signified it had in common. Thus, one by one, all kinds of\ncomposition would prove to be unessential to a name.\n3.342 Although there is something arbitrary in our notations, this much is\nnot arbitrary--that when we have determined one thing arbitrarily,\nsomething else is necessarily the case. (This derives from the essence of\nnotation.)\n3.3421 A particular mode of signifying may be unimportant but it is always\nimportant that it is a possible mode of signifying. And that is generally\nso in philosophy: again and again the individual case turns out to be\nunimportant, but the possibility of each individual case discloses\nsomething about the essence of the world.\n3.343 Definitions are rules for translating from one language into another.\nAny correct sign-language must be translatable into any other in accordance\nwith such rules: it is this that they all have in common.\n3.344 What signifies in a symbol is what is common to all the symbols that\nthe rules of logical syntax allow us to substitute for it.\n3.3441 For instance, we can express what is common to all notations for\ntruth-functions in the following way: they have in common that, for\nexample, the notation that uses 'Pp' ('not p') and 'p C g' ('p or g') can\nbe substituted for any of them. (This serves to characterize the way in\nwhich something general can be disclosed by the possibility of a specific\nnotation.)\n3.3442 Nor does analysis resolve the sign for a complex in an arbitrary\nway, so that it would have a different resolution every time that it was\nincorporated in a different proposition.\n3.4 A proposition determines a place in logical space. The existence of\nthis logical place is guaranteed by the mere existence of the constituents--\nby the existence of the proposition with a sense.\n3.41 The propositional sign with logical co-ordinates--that is the logical\nplace.\n3.411 In geometry and logic alike a place is a possibility: something can\nexist in it.\n3.42 A proposition can determine only one place in logical space:\nnevertheless the whole of logical space must already be given by it.\n(Otherwise negation, logical sum, logical product, etc., would introduce\nmore and more new elements in co-ordination.) (The logical scaffolding\nsurrounding a picture determines logical space. The force of a proposition\nreaches through the whole of logical space.)\n3.5 A propositional sign, applied and thought out, is a thought.\n4 A thought is a proposition with a sense.\n4.001 The totality of propositions is language.\n4.022 Man possesses the ability to construct languages capable of\nexpressing every sense, without having any idea how each word has meaning\nor what its meaning is--just as people speak without knowing how the\nindividual sounds are produced. Everyday language is a part of the human\norganism and is no less complicated than it. It is not humanly possible to\ngather immediately from it what the logic of language is. Language\ndisguises thought. So much so, that from the outward form of the clothing\nit is impossible to infer the form of the thought beneath it, because the\noutward form of the clothing is not designed to reveal the form of the\nbody, but for entirely different purposes. The tacit conventions on which\nthe understanding of everyday language depends are enormously complicated.\n4.003 Most of the propositions and questions to be found in philosophical\nworks are not false but nonsensical. Consequently we cannot give any answer\nto questions of this kind, but can only point out that they are\nnonsensical. Most of the propositions and questions of philosophers arise\nfrom our failure to understand the logic of our language. (They belong to\nthe same class as the question whether the good is more or less identical\nthan the beautiful.) And it is not surprising that the deepest problems are\nin fact not problems at all.\n4.0031 All philosophy is a 'critique of language' (though not in Mauthner's\nsense). It was Russell who performed the service of showing that the\napparent logical form of a proposition need not be its real one.\n4.01 A proposition is a picture of reality. A proposition is a model of\nreality as we imagine it.\n4.011 At first sight a proposition--one set out on the printed page, for\nexample--does not seem to be a picture of the reality with which it is\nconcerned. But neither do written notes seem at first sight to be a picture\nof a piece of music, nor our phonetic notation (the alphabet) to be a\npicture of our speech. And yet these sign-languages prove to be pictures,\neven in the ordinary sense, of what they represent.\n4.012 It is obvious that a proposition of the form 'aRb' strikes us as a\npicture. In this case the sign is obviously a likeness of what is\nsignified.\n4.013 And if we penetrate to the essence of this pictorial character, we\nsee that it is not impaired by apparent irregularities (such as the use\n[sharp] of and [flat] in musical notation). For even these irregularities\ndepict what they are intended to express; only they do it in a different\nway.\n4.014 A gramophone record, the musical idea, the written notes, and the\nsound-waves, all stand to one another in the same internal relation of\ndepicting that holds between language and the world. They are all\nconstructed according to a common logical pattern. (Like the two youths in\nthe fairy-tale, their two horses, and their lilies. They are all in a\ncertain sense one.)\n4.0141 There is a general rule by means of which the musician can obtain\nthe symphony from the score, and which makes it possible to derive the\nsymphony from the groove on the gramophone record, and, using the first\nrule, to derive the score again. That is what constitutes the inner\nsimilarity between these things which seem to be constructed in such\nentirely different ways. And that rule is the law of projection which\nprojects the symphony into the language of musical notation. It is the rule\nfor translating this language into the language of gramophone records.\n4.015 The possibility of all imagery, of all our pictorial modes of\nexpression, is contained in the logic of depiction.\n4.016 In order to understand the essential nature of a proposition, we\nshould consider hieroglyphic script, which depicts the facts that it\ndescribes. And alphabetic script developed out of it without losing what\nwas essential to depiction.\n4.02 We can see this from the fact that we understand the sense of a\npropositional sign without its having been explained to us.\n4.021 A proposition is a picture of reality: for if I understand a\nproposition, I know the situation that it represents. And I understand the\nproposition without having had its sense explained to me.\n4.022 A proposition shows its sense. A proposition shows how things stand\nif it is true. And it says that they do so stand.\n4.023 A proposition must restrict reality to two alternatives: yes or no.\nIn order to do that, it must describe reality completely. A proposition is\na description of a state of affairs. Just as a description of an object\ndescribes it by giving its external properties, so a proposition describes\nreality by its internal properties. A proposition constructs a world with\nthe help of a logical scaffolding, so that one can actually see from the\nproposition how everything stands logically if it is true. One can draw\ninferences from a false proposition.\n4.024 To understand a proposition means to know what is the case if it is\ntrue. (One can understand it, therefore, without knowing whether it is\ntrue.) It is understood by anyone who understands its constituents.\n4.025 When translating one language into another, we do not proceed by\ntranslating each proposition of the one into a proposition of the other,\nbut merely by translating the constituents of propositions. (And the\ndictionary translates not only substantives, but also verbs, adjectives,\nand conjunctions, etc.; and it treats them all in the same way.)\n4.026 The meanings of simple signs (words) must be explained to us if we\nare to understand them. With propositions, however, we make ourselves\nunderstood.\n4.027 It belongs to the essence of a proposition that it should be able to\ncommunicate a new sense to us.\n4.03 A proposition must use old expressions to communicate a new sense. A\nproposition communicates a situation to us, and so it must be essentially\nconnected with the situation. And the connexion is precisely that it is its\nlogical picture. A proposition states something only in so far as it is a\npicture.\n4.031 In a proposition a situation is, as it were, constructed by way of\nexperiment. Instead of, 'This proposition has such and such a sense, we can\nsimply say, 'This proposition represents such and such a situation'.\n4.0311 One name stands for one thing, another for another thing, and they\nare combined with one another. In this way the whole group--like a tableau\nvivant--presents a state of affairs.\n4.0312 The possibility of propositions is based on the principle that\nobjects have signs as their representatives. My fundamental idea is that\nthe 'logical constants' are not representatives; that there can be no\nrepresentatives of the logic of facts.\n4.032 It is only in so far as a proposition is logically articulated that\nit is a picture of a situation. (Even the proposition, 'Ambulo', is\ncomposite: for its stem with a different ending yields a different sense,\nand so does its ending with a different stem.)\n4.04 In a proposition there must be exactly as many distinguishable parts\nas in the situation that it represents. The two must possess the same\nlogical (mathematical) multiplicity. (Compare Hertz's Mechanics on\ndynamical models.)\n4.041 This mathematical multiplicity, of course, cannot itself be the\nsubject of depiction. One cannot get away from it when depicting.\n4.0411 If, for example, we wanted to express what we now write as '(x) .\nfx' by putting an affix in front of 'fx'--for instance by writing 'Gen. fx'-\n-it would not be adequate: we should not know what was being generalized.\nIf we wanted to signalize it with an affix 'g'--for instance by writing\n'f(xg)'--that would not be adequate either: we should not know the scope of\nthe generality-sign. If we were to try to do it by introducing a mark into\nthe argument-places--for instance by writing '(G,G) . F(G,G)' --it would\nnot be adequate: we should not be able to establish the identity of the\nvariables. And so on. All these modes of signifying are inadequate because\nthey lack the necessary mathematical multiplicity.\n4.0412 For the same reason the idealist's appeal to 'spatial spectacles' is\ninadequate to explain the seeing of spatial relations, because it cannot\nexplain the multiplicity of these relations.\n4.05 Reality is compared with propositions.\n4.06 A proposition can be true or false only in virtue of being a picture\nof reality.\n4.061 It must not be overlooked that a proposition has a sense that is\nindependent of the facts: otherwise one can easily suppose that true and\nfalse are relations of equal status between signs and what they signify. In\nthat case one could say, for example, that 'p' signified in the true way\nwhat 'Pp' signified in the false way, etc.\n4.062 Can we not make ourselves understood with false propositions just as\nwe have done up till now with true ones?--So long as it is known that they\nare meant to be false.--No! For a proposition is true if we use it to say\nthat things stand in a certain way, and they do; and if by 'p' we mean Pp\nand things stand as we mean that they do, then, construed in the new way,\n'p' is true and not false.\n4.0621 But it is important that the signs 'p' and 'Pp' can say the same\nthing. For it shows that nothing in reality corresponds to the sign 'P'.\nThe occurrence of negation in a proposition is not enough to characterize\nits sense (PPp = p). The propositions 'p' and 'Pp' have opposite sense, but\nthere corresponds to them one and the same reality.\n4.063 An analogy to illustrate the concept of truth: imagine a black spot\non white paper: you can describe the shape of the spot by saying, for each\npoint on the sheet, whether it is black or white. To the fact that a point\nis black there corresponds a positive fact, and to the fact that a point is\nwhite (not black), a negative fact. If I designate a point on the sheet (a\ntruth-value according to Frege), then this corresponds to the supposition\nthat is put forward for judgement, etc. etc. But in order to be able to say\nthat a point is black or white, I must first know when a point is called\nblack, and when white: in order to be able to say,'\"p\" is true (or false)',\nI must have determined in what circumstances I call 'p' true, and in so\ndoing I determine the sense of the proposition. Now the point where the\nsimile breaks down is this: we can indicate a point on the paper even if we\ndo not know what black and white are, but if a proposition has no sense,\nnothing corresponds to it, since it does not designatea thing (a truth-\nvalue) which might have properties called 'false' or 'true'. The verb of a\nproposition is not 'is true' or 'is false', as Frege thought: rather, that\nwhich 'is true' must already contain the verb.\n4.064 Every proposition must already have a sense: it cannot be given a\nsense by affirmation. Indeed its sense is just what is affirmed. And the\nsame applies to negation, etc.\n4.0641 One could say that negation must be related to the logical place\ndetermined by the negated proposition. The negating proposition determines\na logical place different from that of the negated proposition. The\nnegating proposition determines a logical place with the help of the\nlogical place of the negated proposition. For it describes it as lying\noutside the latter's logical place. The negated proposition can be negated\nagain, and this in itself shows that what is negated is already a\nproposition, and not merely something that is prelimary to a proposition.\n4.1 Propositions represent the existence and non-existence of states of\naffairs.\n4.11 The totality of true propositions is the whole of natural science (or\nthe whole corpus of the natural sciences).\n4.111 Philosophy is not one of the natural sciences. (The word 'philosophy'\nmust mean something whose place is above or below the natural sciences, not\nbeside them.)\n4.112 Philosophy aims at the logical clarification of thoughts. Philosophy\nis not a body of doctrine but an activity. A philosophical work consists\nessentially of elucidations. Philosophy does not result in 'philosophical\npropositions', but rather in the clarification of propositions. Without\nphilosophy thoughts are, as it were, cloudy and indistinct: its task is to\nmake them clear and to give them sharp boundaries.\n4.1121 Psychology is no more closely related to philosophy than any other\nnatural science. Theory of knowledge is the philosophy of psychology. Does\nnot my study of sign-language correspond to the study of thought-processes,\nwhich philosophers used to consider so essential to the philosophy of\nlogic? Only in most cases they got entangled in unessential psychological\ninvestigations, and with my method too there is an analogous risk.\n4.1122 Darwin's theory has no more to do with philosophy than any other\nhypothesis in natural science.\n4.113 Philosophy sets limits to the much disputed sphere of natural\nscience.\n4.114 It must set limits to what can be thought; and, in doing so, to what\ncannot be thought. It must set limits to what cannot be thought by working\noutwards through what can be thought.\n4.115 It will signify what cannot be said, by presenting clearly what can\nbe said.\n4.116 Everything that can be thought at all can be thought clearly.\nEverything that can be put into words can be put clearly. 4.12 Propositions\ncan represent the whole of reality, but they cannot represent what they\nmust have in common with reality in order to be able to represent it--\nlogical form. In order to be able to represent logical form, we should have\nto be able to station ourselves with propositions somewhere outside logic,\nthat is to say outside the world.\n4.121 Propositions cannot represent logical form: it is mirrored in them.\nWhat finds its reflection in language, language cannot represent. What\nexpresses itself in language, we cannot express by means of language.\nPropositions show the logical form of reality. They display it.\n4.1211 Thus one proposition 'fa' shows that the object a occurs in its\nsense, two propositions 'fa' and 'ga' show that the same object is\nmentioned in both of them. If two propositions contradict one another, then\ntheir structure shows it; the same is true if one of them follows from the\nother. And so on.\n4.1212 What can be shown, cannot be said.\n4.1213 Now, too, we understand our feeling that once we have a sign-\nlanguage in which everything is all right, we already have a correct\nlogical point of view.\n4.122 In a certain sense we can talk about formal properties of objects and\nstates of affairs, or, in the case of facts, about structural properties:\nand in the same sense about formal relations and structural relations.\n(Instead of 'structural property' I also say 'internal property'; instead\nof 'structural relation', 'internal relation'. I introduce these\nexpressions in order to indicate the source of the confusion between\ninternal relations and relations proper (external relations), which is very\nwidespread among philosophers.) It is impossible, however, to assert by\nmeans of propositions that such internal properties and relations obtain:\nrather, this makes itself manifest in the propositions that represent the\nrelevant states of affairs and are concerned with the relevant objects.\n4.1221 An internal property of a fact can also be bed a feature of that\nfact (in the sense in which we speak of facial features, for example).\n4.123 A property is internal if it is unthinkable that its object should\nnot possess it. (This shade of blue and that one stand, eo ipso, in the\ninternal relation of lighter to darker. It is unthinkable that these two\nobjects should not stand in this relation.) (Here the shifting use of the\nword 'object' corresponds to the shifting use of the words 'property' and\n'relation'.)\n4.124 The existence of an internal property of a possible situation is not\nexpressed by means of a proposition: rather, it expresses itself in the\nproposition representing the situation, by means of an internal property of\nthat proposition. It would be just as nonsensical to assert that a\nproposition had a formal property as to deny it.\n4.1241 It is impossible to distinguish forms from one another by saying\nthat one has this property and another that property: for this presupposes\nthat it makes sense to ascribe either property to either form.\n4.125 The existence of an internal relation between possible situations\nexpresses itself in language by means of an internal relation between the\npropositions representing them.\n4.1251 Here we have the answer to the vexed question 'whether all relations\nare internal or external'.\n4.1252 I call a series that is ordered by an internal relation a series of\nforms. The order of the number-series is not governed by an external\nrelation but by an internal relation. The same is true of the series of\npropositions 'aRb', '(d : c) : aRx . xRb', '(d x,y) : aRx . xRy . yRb', and\nso forth. (If b stands in one of these relations to a, I call b a successor\nof a.)\n4.126 We can now talk about formal concepts, in the same sense that we\nspeak of formal properties. (I introduce this expression in order to\nexhibit the source of the confusion between formal concepts and concepts\nproper, which pervades the whole of traditional logic.) When something\nfalls under a formal concept as one of its objects, this cannot be\nexpressed by means of a proposition. Instead it is shown in the very sign\nfor this object. (A name shows that it signifies an object, a sign for a\nnumber that it signifies a number, etc.) Formal concepts cannot, in fact,\nbe represented by means of a function, as concepts proper can. For their\ncharacteristics, formal properties, are not expressed by means of\nfunctions. The expression for a formal property is a feature of certain\nsymbols. So the sign for the characteristics of a formal concept is a\ndistinctive feature of all symbols whose meanings fall under the concept.\nSo the expression for a formal concept is a propositional variable in which\nthis distinctive f\neature alone is constant.\n4.127 The propositional variable signifies the formal concept, and its\nvalues signify the objects that fall under the concept.\n4.1271 Every variable is the sign for a formal concept. For every variable\nrepresents a constant form that all its values possess, and this can be\nregarded as a formal property of those values.\n4.1272 Thus the variable name 'x' is the proper sign for the pseudo-concept\nobject. Wherever the word 'object' ('thing', etc.) is correctly used, it is\nexpressed in conceptual notation by a variable name. For example, in the\nproposition, 'There are 2 objects which. . .', it is expressed by ' (dx,y)\n... '. Wherever it is used in a different way, that is as a proper concept-\nword, nonsensical pseudo-propositions are the result. So one cannot say,\nfor example, 'There are objects', as one might say, 'There are books'. And\nit is just as impossible to say, 'There are 100 objects', or, 'There are !0\nobjects'. And it is nonsensical to speak of the total number of objects.\nThe same applies to the words 'complex', 'fact', 'function', 'number', etc.\nThey all signify formal concepts, and are represented in conceptual\nnotation by variables, not by functions or classes (as Frege and Russell\nbelieved). '1 is a number', 'There is only one zero', and all similar\nexpressions are nonsensical. (It is just as nonsensical to say, 'There is\nonly one 1', as it would be to say, '2 + 2 at 3 o'clock equals 4'.)\n4.12721 A formal concept is given immediately any object falling under it\nis given. It is not possible, therefore, to introduce as primitive ideas\nobjects belonging to a formal concept and the formal concept itself. So it\nis impossible, for example, to introduce as primitive ideas both the\nconcept of a function and specific functions, as Russell does; or the\nconcept of a number and particular numbers.\n4.1273 If we want to express in conceptual notation the general\nproposition, 'b is a successor of a', then we require an expression for the\ngeneral term of the series of forms 'aRb', '(d : c) : aRx . xRb', '(d x,y)\n: aRx . xRy . yRb', ... , In order to express the general term of a series\nof forms, we must use a variable, because the concept 'term of that series\nof forms' is a formal concept. (This is what Frege and Russell overlooked:\nconsequently the way in which they want to express general propositions\nlike the one above is incorrect; it contains a vicious circle.) We can\ndetermine the general term of a series of forms by giving its first term\nand the general form of the operation that produces the next term out of\nthe proposition that precedes it.\n4.1274 To ask whether a formal concept exists is nonsensical. For no\nproposition can be the answer to such a question. (So, for example, the\nquestion, 'Are there unanalysable subject-predicate propositions?' cannot\nbe asked.)\n4.128 Logical forms are without number. Hence there are no preeminent\nnumbers in logic, and hence there is no possibility of philosophical monism\nor dualism, etc.\n4.2 The sense of a proposition is its agreement and disagreement with\npossibilities of existence and non-existence of states of affairs. 4.21 The\nsimplest kind of proposition, an elementary proposition, asserts the\nexistence of a state of affairs.\n4.211 It is a sign of a proposition's being elementary that there can be no\nelementary proposition contradicting it.\n4.22 An elementary proposition consists of names. It is a nexus, a\nconcatenation, of names.\n4.221 It is obvious that the analysis of propositions must bring us to\nelementary propositions which consist of names in immediate combination.\nThis raises the question how such combination into propositions comes\nabout.\n4.2211 Even if the world is infinitely complex, so that every fact consists\nof infinitely many states of affairs and every state of affairs is composed\nof infinitely many objects, there would still have to be objects and states\nof affairs.\n4.23 It is only in the nexus of an elementary proposition that a name\noccurs in a proposition.\n4.24 Names are the simple symbols: I indicate them by single letters ('x',\n'y', 'z'). I write elementary propositions as functions of names, so that\nthey have the form 'fx', 'O (x,y)', etc. Or I indicate them by the letters\n'p', 'q', 'r'.\n4.241 When I use two signs with one and the same meaning, I express this by\nputting the sign '=' between them. So 'a = b' means that the sign 'b' can\nbe substituted for the sign 'a'. (If I use an equation to introduce a new\nsign 'b', laying down that it shall serve as a substitute for a sign a that\nis already known, then, like Russell, I write the equation-- definition--in\nthe form 'a = b Def.' A definition is a rule dealing with signs.)\n4.242 Expressions of the form 'a = b' are, therefore, mere representational\ndevices. They state nothing about the meaning of the signs 'a' and 'b'.\n4.243 Can we understand two names without knowing whether they signify the\nsame thing or two different things?--Can we understand a proposition in\nwhich two names occur without knowing whether their meaning is the same or\ndifferent? Suppose I know the meaning of an English word and of a German\nword that means the same: then it is impossible for me to be unaware that\nthey do mean the same; I must be capable of translating each into the\nother. Expressions like 'a = a', and those derived from them, are neither\nelementary propositions nor is there any other way in which they have\nsense. (This will become evident later.)\n4.25 If an elementary proposition is true, the state of affairs exists: if\nan elementary proposition is false, the state of affairs does not exist.\n4.26 If all true elementary propositions are given, the result is a\ncomplete description of the world. The world is completely described by\ngiving all elementary propositions, and adding which of them are true and\nwhich false. For n states of affairs, there are possibilities of existence\nand non-existence. Of these states of affairs any combination can exist and\nthe remainder not exist.\n4.28 There correspond to these combinations the same number of\npossibilities of truth--and falsity--for n elementary propositions.\n4.3 Truth-possibilities of elementary propositions mean Possibilities of\nexistence and non-existence of states of affairs.\n4.31 We can represent truth-possibilities by schemata of the following kind\n('T' means 'true', 'F' means 'false'; the rows of 'T's' and 'F's' under the\nrow of elementary propositions symbolize their truth-possibilities in a way\nthat can easily be understood):\n4.4 A proposition is an expression of agreement and disagreement with truth-\npossibilities of elementary propositions.\n4.41 Truth-possibilities of elementary propositions are the conditions of\nthe truth and falsity of propositions.\n4.411 It immediately strikes one as probable that the introduction of\nelementary propositions provides the basis for understanding all other\nkinds of proposition. Indeed the understanding of general propositions\npalpably depends on the understanding of elementary propositions.\n4.42 For n elementary propositions there are ways in which a proposition\ncan agree and disagree with their truth possibilities.\n4.43 We can express agreement with truth-possibilities by correlating the\nmark 'T' (true) with them in the schema. The absence of this mark means\ndisagreement.\n4.431 The expression of agreement and disagreement with the truth\npossibilities of elementary propositions expresses the truth-conditions of\na proposition. A proposition is the expression of its truth-conditions.\n(Thus Frege was quite right to use them as a starting point when he\nexplained the signs of his conceptual notation. But the explanation of the\nconcept of truth that Frege gives is mistaken: if 'the true' and 'the\nfalse' were really objects, and were the arguments in Pp etc., then Frege's\nmethod of determining the sense of 'Pp' would leave it absolutely\nundetermined.)\n4.44 The sign that results from correlating the mark 'I\" with truth-\npossibilities is a propositional sign.\n4.441 It is clear that a complex of the signs 'F' and 'T' has no object (or\ncomplex of objects) corresponding to it, just as there is none\ncorresponding to the horizontal and vertical lines or to the brackets.--\nThere are no 'logical objects'. Of course the same applies to all signs\nthat express what the schemata of 'T's' and 'F's' express.\n4.442 For example, the following is a propositional sign: (Frege's\n'judgement stroke' '|-' is logically quite meaningless: in the works of\nFrege (and Russell) it simply indicates that these authors hold the\npropositions marked with this sign to be true. Thus '|-' is no more a\ncomponent part of a proposition than is, for instance, the proposition's\nnumber. It is quite impossible for a proposition to state that it itself is\ntrue.) If the order or the truth-possibilities in a scheme is fixed once\nand for all by a combinatory rule, then the last column by itself will be\nan expression of the truth-conditions. If we now write this column as a\nrow, the propositional sign will become '(TT-T) (p,q)' or more explicitly\n'(TTFT) (p,q)' (The number of places in the left-hand pair of brackets is\ndetermined by the number of terms in the right-hand pair.)\n4.45 For n elementary propositions there are Ln possible groups of truth-\nconditions. The groups of truth-conditions that are obtainable from the\ntruth-possibilities of a given number of elementary propositions can be\narranged in a series.\n4.46 Among the possible groups of truth-conditions there are two extreme\ncases. In one of these cases the proposition is true for all the truth-\npossibilities of the elementary propositions. We say that the truth-\nconditions are tautological. In the second case the proposition is false\nfor all the truth-possibilities: the truth-conditions are contradictory .\nIn the first case we call the proposition a tautology; in the second, a\ncontradiction.\n4.461 Propositions show what they say; tautologies and contradictions show\nthat they say nothing. A tautology has no truth-conditions, since it is\nunconditionally true: and a contradiction is true on no condition.\nTautologies and contradictions lack sense. (Like a point from which two\narrows go out in opposite directions to one another.) (For example, I know\nnothing about the weather when I know that it is either raining or not\nraining.)\n4.46211 Tautologies and contradictions are not, however, nonsensical. They\nare part of the symbolism, much as '0' is part of the symbolism of\narithmetic.\n4.462 Tautologies and contradictions are not pictures of reality. They do\nnot represent any possible situations. For the former admit all possible\nsituations, and latter none . In a tautology the conditions of agreement\nwith the world--the representational relations--cancel one another, so that\nit does not stand in any representational relation to reality.\n4.463 The truth-conditions of a proposition determine the range that it\nleaves open to the facts. (A proposition, a picture, or a model is, in the\nnegative sense, like a solid body that restricts the freedom of movement of\nothers, and in the positive sense, like a space bounded by solid substance\nin which there is room for a body.) A tautology leaves open to reality the\nwhole--the infinite whole--of logical space: a contradiction fills the\nwhole of logical space leaving no point of it for reality. Thus neither of\nthem can determine reality in any way.\n4.464 A tautology's truth is certain, a proposition's possible, a\ncontradiction's impossible. (Certain, possible, impossible: here we have\nthe first indication of the scale that we need in the theory of\nprobability.)\n4.465 The logical product of a tautology and a proposition says the same\nthing as the proposition. This product, therefore, is identical with the\nproposition. For it is impossible to alter what is essential to a symbol\nwithout altering its sense.\n4.466 What corresponds to a determinate logical combination of signs is a\ndeterminate logical combination of their meanings. It is only to the\nuncombined signs that absolutely any combination corresponds. In other\nwords, propositions that are true for every situation cannot be\ncombinations of signs at all, since, if they were, only determinate\ncombinations of objects could correspond to them. (And what is not a\nlogical combination has no combination of objects corresponding to it.)\nTautology and contradiction are the limiting cases--indeed the\ndisintegration--of the combination of signs.\n4.4661 Admittedly the signs are still combined with one another even in\ntautologies and contradictions--i.e. they stand in certain relations to one\nanother: but these relations have no meaning, they are not essential to the\nsymbol .\n4.5 It now seems possible to give the most general propositional form: that\nis, to give a description of the propositions of any sign-language\nwhatsoever in such a way that every possible sense can be expressed by a\nsymbol satisfying the description, and every symbol satisfying the\ndescription can express a sense, provided that the meanings of the names\nare suitably chosen. It is clear that only what is essential to the most\ngeneral propositional form may be included in its description--for\notherwise it would not be the most general form. The existence of a general\npropositional form is proved by the fact that there cannot be a proposition\nwhose form could not have been foreseen (i.e. constructed). The general\nform of a proposition is: This is how things stand.\n4.51 Suppose that I am given all elementary propositions: then I can simply\nask what propositions I can construct out of them. And there I have all\npropositions, and that fixes their limits.\n4.52 Propositions comprise all that follows from the totality of all\nelementary propositions (and, of course, from its being the totality of\nthem all ). (Thus, in a certain sense, it could be said that all\npropositions were generalizations of elementary propositions.)\n4.53 The general propositional form is a variable.\n5 A proposition is a truth-function of elementary propositions. (An\nelementary proposition is a truth-function of itself.)\n5.01 Elementary propositions are the truth-arguments of propositions.\n5.02 The arguments of functions are readily confused with the affixes of\nnames. For both arguments and affixes enable me to recognize the meaning of\nthe signs containing them. For example, when Russell writes '+c', the 'c'\nis an affix which indicates that the sign as a whole is the addition-sign\nfor cardinal numbers. But the use of this sign is the result of arbitrary\nconvention and it would be quite possible to choose a simple sign instead\nof '+c'; in 'Pp' however, 'p' is not an affix but an argument: the sense of\n'Pp' cannot be understood unless the sense of 'p' has been understood\nalready. (In the name Julius Caesar 'Julius' is an affix. An affix is\nalways part of a description of the object to whose name we attach it: e.g.\nthe Caesar of the Julian gens.) If I am not mistaken, Frege's theory about\nthe meaning of propositions and functions is based on the confusion between\nan argument and an affix. Frege regarded the propositions of logic as\nnames, and their arguments as the affixes of those names.\n5.1 Truth-functions can be arranged in series. That is the foundation of\nthe theory of probability.\n5.101 The truth-functions of a given number of elementary propositions can\nalways be set out in a schema of the following kind: (TTTT) (p, q)\nTautology (If p then p, and if q then q.) (p z p . q z q) (FTTT) (p, q) In\nwords : Not both p and q. (P(p . q)) (TFTT) (p, q) \" : If q then p. (q z p)\n(TTFT) (p, q) \" : If p then q. (p z q) (TTTF) (p, q) \" : p or q. (p C q)\n(FFTT) (p, q) \" : Not g. (Pq) (FTFT) (p, q) \" : Not p. (Pp) (FTTF) (p, q) \"\n: p or q, but not both. (p . Pq : C : q . Pp) (TFFT) (p, q) \" : If p then\np, and if q then p. (p + q) (TFTF) (p, q) \" : p (TTFF) (p, q) \" : q (FFFT)\n(p, q) \" : Neither p nor q. (Pp . Pq or p | q) (FFTF) (p, q) \" : p and not\nq. (p . Pq) (FTFF) (p, q) \" : q and not p. (q . Pp) (TFFF) (p,q) \" : q and\np. (q . p) (FFFF) (p, q) Contradiction (p and not p, and q and not q.) (p .\nPp . q . Pq) I will give the name truth-grounds of a proposition to those\ntruth-possibilities of its truth-arguments that make it true.\n5.11 If all the truth-grounds that are common to a number of propositions\nare at the same time truth-grounds of a certain proposition, then we say\nthat the truth of that proposition follows from the truth of the others.\n5.12 In particular, the truth of a proposition 'p' follows from the truth\nof another proposition 'q' is all the truth-grounds of the latter are truth-\ngrounds of the former.\n5.121 The truth-grounds of the one are contained in those of the other: p\nfollows from q.\n5.122 If p follows from q, the sense of 'p' is contained in the sense of\n'q'.\n5.123 If a god creates a world in which certain propositions are true, then\nby that very act he also creates a world in which all the propositions that\nfollow from them come true. And similarly he could not create a world in\nwhich the proposition 'p' was true without creating all its objects.\n5.124 A proposition affirms every proposition that follows from it.\n5.1241 'p . q' is one of the propositions that affirm 'p' and at the same\ntime one of the propositions that affirm 'q'. Two propositions are opposed\nto one another if there is no proposition with a sense, that affirms them\nboth. Every proposition that contradicts another negate it.\n5.13 When the truth of one proposition follows from the truth of others, we\ncan see this from the structure of the proposition.\n5.131 If the truth of one proposition follows from the truth of others,\nthis finds expression in relations in which the forms of the propositions\nstand to one another: nor is it necessary for us to set up these relations\nbetween them, by combining them with one another in a single proposition;\non the contrary, the relations are internal, and their existence is an\nimmediate result of the existence of the propositions.\n5.1311 When we infer q from p C q and Pp, the relation between the\npropositional forms of 'p C q' and 'Pp' is masked, in this case, by our\nmode of signifying. But if instead of 'p C q' we write, for example, 'p|q .\n| . p|q', and instead of 'Pp', 'p|p' (p|q = neither p nor q), then the\ninner connexion becomes obvious. (The possibility of inference from (x) .\nfx to fa shows that the symbol (x) . fx itself has generality in it.)\n5.132 If p follows from q, I can make an inference from q to p, deduce p\nfrom q. The nature of the inference can be gathered only from the two\npropositions. They themselves are the only possible justification of the\ninference. 'Laws of inference', which are supposed to justify inferences,\nas in the works of Frege and Russell, have no sense, and would be\nsuperfluous.\n5.133 All deductions are made a priori.\n5.134 One elementary proposition cannot be deduced form another.\n5.135 There is no possible way of making an inference form the existence of\none situation to the existence of another, entirely different situation.\n5.136 There is no causal nexus to justify such an inference.\n5.1361 We cannot infer the events of the future from those of the present.\nBelief in the causal nexus is superstition.\n5.1362 The freedom of the will consists in the impossibility of knowing\nactions that still lie in the future. We could know them only if causality\nwere an inner necessity like that of logical inference.--The connexion\nbetween knowledge and what is known is that of logical necessity. ('A knows\nthat p is the case', has no sense if p is a tautology.)\n5.1363 If the truth of a proposition does not follow from the fact that it\nis self-evident to us, then its self-evidence in no way justifies our\nbelief in its truth.\n5.14 If one proposition follows from another, then the latter says more\nthan the former, and the former less than the latter.\n5.141 If p follows from q and q from p, then they are one and same\nproposition.\n5.142 A tautology follows from all propositions: it says nothing.\n5.143 Contradiction is that common factor of propositions which no\nproposition has in common with another. Tautology is the common factor of\nall propositions that have nothing in common with one another.\nContradiction, one might say, vanishes outside all propositions: tautology\nvanishes inside them. Contradiction is the outer limit of propositions:\ntautology is the unsubstantial point at their centre.\n5.15 If Tr is the number of the truth-grounds of a proposition 'r', and if\nTrs is the number of the truth-grounds of a proposition 's' that are at the\nsame time truth-grounds of 'r', then we call the ratio Trs : Tr the degree\nof probability that the proposition 'r' gives to the proposition 's'. 5.151\nIn a schema like the one above in\n5.101, let Tr be the number of 'T's' in the proposition r, and let Trs, be\nthe number of 'T's' in the proposition s that stand in columns in which the\nproposition r has 'T's'. Then the proposition r gives to the proposition s\nthe probability Trs : Tr.\n5.1511 There is no special object peculiar to probability propositions.\n5.152 When propositions have no truth-arguments in common with one another,\nwe call them independent of one another. Two elementary propositions give\none another the probability 1/2. If p follows from q, then the proposition\n'q' gives to the proposition 'p' the probability 1. The certainty of\nlogical inference is a limiting case of probability. (Application of this\nto tautology and contradiction.)\n5.153 In itself, a proposition is neither probable nor improbable. Either\nan event occurs or it does not: there is no middle way.\n5.154 Suppose that an urn contains black and white balls in equal numbers\n(and none of any other kind). I draw one ball after another, putting them\nback into the urn. By this experiment I can establish that the number of\nblack balls drawn and the number of white balls drawn approximate to one\nanother as the draw continues. So this is not a mathematical truth. Now, if\nI say, 'The probability of my drawing a white ball is equal to the\nprobability of my drawing a black one', this means that all the\ncircumstances that I know of (including the laws of nature assumed as\nhypotheses) give no more probability to the occurrence of the one event\nthan to that of the other. That is to say, they give each the probability\n1/2 as can easily be gathered from the above definitions. What I confirm by\nthe experiment is that the occurrence of the two events is independent of\nthe circumstances of which I have no more detailed knowledge.\n5.155 The minimal unit for a probability proposition is this: The\ncircumstances--of which I have no further knowledge--give such and such a\ndegree of probability to the occurrence of a particular event.\n5.156 It is in this way that probability is a generalization. It involves a\ngeneral description of a propositional form. We use probability only in\ndefault of certainty--if our knowledge of a fact is not indeed complete,\nbut we do know something about its form. (A proposition may well be an\nincomplete picture of a certain situation, but it is always a complete\npicture of something .) A probability proposition is a sort of excerpt from\nother propositions.\n5.2 The structures of propositions stand in internal relations to one\nanother.\n5.21 In order to give prominence to these internal relations we can adopt\nthe following mode of expression: we can represent a proposition as the\nresult of an operation that produces it out of other propositions (which\nare the bases of the operation).\n5.22 An operation is the expression of a relation between the structures of\nits result and of its bases.\n5.23 The operation is what has to be done to the one proposition in order\nto make the other out of it.\n5.231 And that will, of course, depend on their formal properties, on the\ninternal similarity of their forms.\n5.232 The internal relation by which a series is ordered is equivalent to\nthe operation that produces one term from another.\n5.233 Operations cannot make their appearance before the point at which one\nproposition is generated out of another in a logically meaningful way; i.e.\nthe point at which the logical construction of propositions begins.\n5.234 Truth-functions of elementary propositions are results of operations\nwith elementary propositions as bases. (These operations I call truth-\noperations.)\n5.2341 The sense of a truth-function of p is a function of the sense of p.\nNegation, logical addition, logical multiplication, etc. etc. are\noperations. (Negation reverses the sense of a proposition.)\n5.24 An operation manifests itself in a variable; it shows how we can get\nfrom one form of proposition to another. It gives expression to the\ndifference between the forms. (And what the bases of an operation and its\nresult have in common is just the bases themselves.)\n5.241 An operation is not the mark of a form, but only of a difference\nbetween forms.\n5.242 The operation that produces 'q' from 'p' also produces 'r' from 'q',\nand so on. There is only one way of expressing this: 'p', 'q', 'r', etc.\nhave to be variables that give expression in a general way to certain\nformal relations.\n5.25 The occurrence of an operation does not characterize the sense of a\nproposition. Indeed, no statement is made by an operation, but only by its\nresult, and this depends on the bases of the operation. (Operations and\nfunctions must not be confused with each other.)\n5.251 A function cannot be its own argument, whereas an operation can take\none of its own results as its base.\n5.252 It is only in this way that the step from one term of a series of\nforms to another is possible (from one type to another in the hierarchies\nof Russell and Whitehead). (Russell and Whitehead did not admit the\npossibility of such steps, but repeatedly availed themselves of it.)\n5.2521 If an operation is applied repeatedly to its own results, I speak of\nsuccessive applications of it. ('O'O'O'a' is the result of three successive\napplications of the operation 'O'E' to 'a'.) In a similar sense I speak of\nsuccessive applications of more than one operation to a number of\npropositions.\n5.2522 Accordingly I use the sign '[a, x, O'x]' for the general term of the\nseries of forms a, O'a, O'O'a, ... . This bracketed expression is a\nvariable: the first term of the bracketed expression is the beginning of\nthe series of forms, the second is the form of a term x arbitrarily\nselected from the series, and the third is the form of the term that\nimmediately follows x in the series.\n5.2523 The concept of successive applications of an operation is equivalent\nto the concept 'and so on'.\n5.253 One operation can counteract the effect of another. Operations can\ncancel one another.\n5.254 An operation can vanish (e.g. negation in 'PPp' : PPp = p).\n5.3 All propositions are results of truth-operations on elementary\npropositions. A truth-operation is the way in which a truth-function is\nproduced out of elementary propositions. It is of the essence of truth-\noperations that, just as elementary propositions yield a truth-function of\nthemselves, so too in the same way truth-functions yield a further truth-\nfunction. When a truth-operation is applied to truth-functions of\nelementary propositions, it always generates another truth-function of\nelementary propositions, another proposition. When a truth-operation is\napplied to the results of truth-operations on elementary propositions,\nthere is always a single operation on elementary propositions that has the\nsame result. Every proposition is the result of truth-operations on\nelementary propositions.\n5.31 The schemata in 4.31 have a meaning even when 'p', 'q', 'r', etc. are\nnot elementary propositions. And it is easy to see that the propositional\nsign in 4.442 expresses a single truth-function of elementary propositions\neven when 'p' and 'q' are truth-functions of elementary propositions.\n5.32 All truth-functions are results of successive applications to\nelementary propositions of a finite number of truth-operations.\n5.4 At this point it becomes manifest that there are no 'logical objects'\nor 'logical constants' (in Frege's and Russell's sense).\n5.41 The reason is that the results of truth-operations on truth-functions\nare always identical whenever they are one and the same truth-function of\nelementary propositions.\n5.42 It is self-evident that C, z, etc. are not relations in the sense in\nwhich right and left etc. are relations. The interdefinability of Frege's\nand Russell's 'primitive signs' of logic is enough to show that they are\nnot primitive signs, still less signs for relations. And it is obvious that\nthe 'z' defined by means of 'P' and 'C' is identical with the one that\nfigures with 'P' in the definition of 'C'; and that the second 'C' is\nidentical with the first one; and so on.\n5.43 Even at first sight it seems scarcely credible that there should\nfollow from one fact p infinitely many others , namely PPp, PPPPp, etc. And\nit is no less remarkable that the infinite number of propositions of logic\n(mathematics) follow from half a dozen 'primitive propositions'. But in\nfact all the propositions of logic say the same thing, to wit nothing.\n5.44 Truth-functions are not material functions. For example, an\naffirmation can be produced by double negation: in such a case does it\nfollow that in some sense negation is contained in affirmation? Does 'PPp'\nnegate Pp, or does it affirm p--or both? The proposition 'PPp' is not about\nnegation, as if negation were an object: on the other hand, the possibility\nof negation is already written into affirmation. And if there were an\nobject called 'P', it would follow that 'PPp' said something different from\nwhat 'p' said, just because the one proposition would then be about P and\nthe other would not.\n5.441 This vanishing of the apparent logical constants also occurs in the\ncase of 'P(dx) . Pfx', which says the same as '(x) . fx', and in the case\nof '(dx) . fx . x = a', which says the same as 'fa'.\n5.442 If we are given a proposition, then with it we are also given the\nresults of all truth-operations that have it as their base.\n5.45 If there are primitive logical signs, then any logic that fails to\nshow clearly how they are placed relatively to one another and to justify\ntheir existence will be incorrect. The construction of logic out of its\nprimitive signs must be made clear.\n5.451 If logic has primitive ideas, they must be independent of one\nanother. If a primitive idea has been introduced, it must have been\nintroduced in all the combinations in which it ever occurs. It cannot,\ntherefore, be introduced first for one combination and later reintroduced\nfor another. For example, once negation has been introduced, we must\nunderstand it both in propositions of the form 'Pp' and in propositions\nlike 'P(p C q)', '(dx) . Pfx', etc. We must not introduce it first for the\none class of cases and then for the other, since it would then be left in\ndoubt whether its meaning were the same in both cases, and no reason would\nhave been given for combining the signs in the same way in both cases. (In\nshort, Frege's remarks about introducing signs by means of definitions (in\nThe Fundamental Laws of Arithmetic ) also apply, mutatis mutandis, to the\nintroduction of primitive signs.)\n5.452 The introduction of any new device into the symbolism of logic is\nnecessarily a momentous event. In logic a new device should not be\nintroduced in brackets or in a footnote with what one might call a\ncompletely innocent air. (Thus in Russell and Whitehead's Principia\nMathematica there occur definitions and primitive propositions expressed in\nwords. Why this sudden appearance of words? It would require a\njustification, but none is given, or could be given, since the procedure is\nin fact illicit.) But if the introduction of a new device has proved\nnecessary at a certain point, we must immediately ask ourselves, 'At what\npoints is the employment of this device now unavoidable ?' and its place in\nlogic must be made clear.\n5.453 All numbers in logic stand in need of justification. Or rather, it\nmust become evident that there are no numbers in logic. There are no pre-\neminent numbers.\n5.454 In logic there is no co-ordinate status, and there can be no\nclassification. In logic there can be no distinction between the general\nand the specific.\n5.4541 The solutions of the problems of logic must be simple, since they\nset the standard of simplicity. Men have always had a presentiment that\nthere must be a realm in which the answers to questions are symmetrically\ncombined--a priori--to form a self-contained system. A realm subject to the\nlaw: Simplex sigillum veri.\n5.46 If we introduced logical signs properly, then we should also have\nintroduced at the same time the sense of all combinations of them; i.e. not\nonly 'p C q' but 'P(p C q)' as well, etc. etc. We should also have\nintroduced at the same time the effect of all possible combinations of\nbrackets. And thus it would have been made clear that the real general\nprimitive signs are not ' p C q', '(dx) . fx', etc. but the most general\nform of their combinations.\n5.461 Though it seems unimportant, it is in fact significant that the\npseudo-relations of logic, such as C and z, need brackets--unlike real\nrelations. Indeed, the use of brackets with these apparently primitive\nsigns is itself an indication that they are not primitive signs. And surely\nno one is going to believe brackets have an independent meaning. 5.4611\nSigns for logical operations are punctuation-marks,\n5.47 It is clear that whatever we can say in advance about the form of all\npropositions, we must be able to say all at once . An elementary\nproposition really contains all logical operations in itself. For 'fa' says\nthe same thing as '(dx) . fx . x = a' Wherever there is compositeness,\nargument and function are present, and where these are present, we already\nhave all the logical constants. One could say that the sole logical\nconstant was what all propositions, by their very nature, had in common\nwith one another. But that is the general propositional form.\n5.471 The general propositional form is the essence of a proposition.\n5.4711 To give the essence of a proposition means to give the essence of\nall description, and thus the essence of the world.\n5.472 The description of the most general propositional form is the\ndescription of the one and only general primitive sign in logic.\n5.473 Logic must look after itself. If a sign is possible , then it is also\ncapable of signifying. Whatever is possible in logic is also permitted.\n(The reason why 'Socrates is identical' means nothing is that there is no\nproperty called 'identical'. The proposition is nonsensical because we have\nfailed to make an arbitrary determination, and not because the symbol, in\nitself, would be illegitimate.) In a certain sense, we cannot make mistakes\nin logic.\n5.4731 Self-evidence, which Russell talked about so much, can become\ndispensable in logic, only because language itself prevents every logical\nmistake.--What makes logic a priori is the impossibility of illogical\nthought.\n5.4732 We cannot give a sign the wrong sense.\n5,47321 Occam's maxim is, of course, not an arbitrary rule, nor one that is\njustified by its success in practice: its point is that unnecessary units\nin a sign-language mean nothing. Signs that serve one purpose are logically\nequivalent, and signs that serve none are logically meaningless.\n5.4733 Frege says that any legitimately constructed proposition must have a\nsense. And I say that any possible proposition is legitimately constructed,\nand, if it has no sense, that can only be because we have failed to give a\nmeaning to some of its constituents. (Even if we think that we have done\nso.) Thus the reason why 'Socrates is identical' says nothing is that we\nhave not given any adjectival meaning to the word 'identical'. For when it\nappears as a sign for identity, it symbolizes in an entirely different way--\nthe signifying relation is a different one--therefore the symbols also are\nentirely different in the two cases: the two symbols have only the sign in\ncommon, and that is an accident.\n5.474 The number of fundamental operations that are necessary depends\nsolely on our notation.\n5.475 All that is required is that we should construct a system of signs\nwith a particular number of dimensions--with a particular mathematical\nmultiplicity\n5.476 It is clear that this is not a question of a number of primitive\nideas that have to be signified, but rather of the expression of a rule.\n5.5 Every truth-function is a result of successive applications to\nelementary propositions of the operation '(-----T)(E, ....)'. This\noperation negates all the propositions in the right-hand pair of brackets,\nand I call it the negation of those propositions.\n5.501 When a bracketed expression has propositions as its terms--and the\norder of the terms inside the brackets is indifferent--then I indicate it\nby a sign of the form '(E)'. '(E)' is a variable whose values are terms of\nthe bracketed expression and the bar over the variable indicates that it is\nthe representative of ali its values in the brackets. (E.g. if E has the\nthree values P,Q, R, then (E) = (P, Q, R). ) What the values of the\nvariable are is something that is stipulated. The stipulation is a\ndescription of the propositions that have the variable as their\nrepresentative. How the description of the terms of the bracketed\nexpression is produced is not essential. We can distinguish three kinds of\ndescription: 1.Direct enumeration, in which case we can simply substitute\nfor the variable the constants that are its values; 2. giving a function fx\nwhose values for all values of x are the propositions to be described; 3.\ngiving a formal law that governs the construction of the propositions, in\nwhich case the bracketed expression has as its members all the terms of a\nseries of forms.\n5.502 So instead of '(-----T)(E, ....)', I write 'N(E)'. N(E) is the\nnegation of all the values of the propositional variable E.\n5.503 It is obvious that we can easily express how propositions may be\nconstructed with this operation, and how they may not be constructed with\nit; so it must be possible to find an exact expression for this.\n5.51 If E has only one value, then N(E) = Pp (not p); if it has two values,\nthen N(E) = Pp . Pq. (neither p nor g).\n5.511 How can logic--all-embracing logic, which mirrors the world--use such\npeculiar crotchets and contrivances? Only because they are all connected\nwith one another in an infinitely fine network, the great mirror.\n5.512 'Pp' is true if 'p' is false. Therefore, in the proposition 'Pp',\nwhen it is true, 'p' is a false proposition. How then can the stroke 'P'\nmake it agree with reality? But in 'Pp' it is not 'P' that negates, it is\nrather what is common to all the signs of this notation that negate p. That\nis to say the common rule that governs the construction of 'Pp', 'PPPp',\n'Pp C Pp', 'Pp . Pp', etc. etc. (ad inf.). And this common factor mirrors\nnegation.\n5.513 We might say that what is common to all symbols that affirm both p\nand q is the proposition 'p . q'; and that what is common to all symbols\nthat affirm either p or q is the proposition 'p C q'. And similarly we can\nsay that two propositions are opposed to one another if they have nothing\nin common with one another, and that every proposition has only one\nnegative, since there is only one proposition that lies completely outside\nit. Thus in Russell's notation too it is manifest that 'q : p C Pp' says\nthe same thing as 'q', that 'p C Pq' says nothing.\n5.514 Once a notation has been established, there will be in it a rule\ngoverning the construction of all propositions that negate p, a rule\ngoverning the construction of all propositions that affirm p, and a rule\ngoverning the construction of all propositions that affirm p or q; and so\non. These rules are equivalent to the symbols; and in them their sense is\nmirrored.\n5.515 It must be manifest in our symbols that it can only be propositions\nthat are combined with one another by 'C', '.', etc. And this is indeed the\ncase, since the symbol in 'p' and 'q' itself presupposes 'C', 'P', etc. If\nthe sign 'p' in 'p C q' does not stand for a complex sign, then it cannot\nhave sense by itself: but in that case the signs 'p C p', 'p . p', etc.,\nwhich have the same sense as p, must also lack sense. But if 'p C p' has no\nsense, then 'p C q' cannot have a sense either.\n5.5151 Must the sign of a negative proposition be constructed with that of\nthe positive proposition? Why should it not be possible to express a\nnegative proposition by means of a negative fact? (E.g. suppose that \"a'\ndoes not stand in a certain relation to 'b'; then this might be used to say\nthat aRb was not the case.) But really even in this case the negative\nproposition is constructed by an indirect use of the positive. The positive\nproposition necessarily presupposes the existence of the negative\nproposition and vice versa.\n5.52 If E has as its values all the values of a function fx for all values\nof x, then N(E) = P(dx) . fx.\n5.521 I dissociate the concept all from truth-functions. Frege and Russell\nintroduced generality in association with logical productor logical sum.\nThis made it difficult to understand the propositions '(dx) . fx' and '(x)\n. fx', in which both ideas are embedded.\n5.522 What is peculiar to the generality-sign is first, that it indicates a\nlogical prototype, and secondly, that it gives prominence to constants.\n5.523 The generality-sign occurs as an argument.\n5.524 If objects are given, then at the same time we are given all objects.\nIf elementary propositions are given, then at the same time all elementary\npropositions are given.\n5.525 It is incorrect to render the proposition '(dx) . fx' in the words,\n'fx is possible ' as Russell does. The certainty, possibility, or\nimpossibility of a situation is not expressed by a proposition, but by an\nexpression's being a tautology, a proposition with a sense, or a\ncontradiction. The precedent to which we are constantly inclined to appeal\nmust reside in the symbol itself.\n5.526 We can describe the world completely by means of fully generalized\npropositions, i.e. without first correlating any name with a particular\nobject.\n5.5261 A fully generalized proposition, like every other proposition, is\ncomposite. (This is shown by the fact that in '(dx, O) . Ox' we have to\nmention 'O' and 's' separately. They both, independently, stand in\nsignifying relations to the world, just as is the case in ungeneralized\npropositions.) It is a mark of a composite symbol that it has something in\ncommon with other symbols.\n5.5262 The truth or falsity of every proposition does make some alteration\nin the general construction of the world. And the range that the totality\nof elementary propositions leaves open for its construction is exactly the\nsame as that which is delimited by entirely general propositions. (If an\nelementary proposition is true, that means, at any rate, one more true\nelementary proposition.)\n5.53 Identity of object I express by identity of sign, and not by using a\nsign for identity. Difference of objects I express by difference of signs.\n5.5301 It is self-evident that identity is not a relation between objects.\nThis becomes very clear if one considers, for example, the proposition '(x)\n: fx . z . x = a'. What this proposition says is simply that only a\nsatisfies the function f, and not that only things that have a certain\nrelation to a satisfy the function, Of course, it might then be said that\nonly a did have this relation to a; but in order to express that, we should\nneed the identity-sign itself.\n5.5302 Russell's definition of '=' is inadequate, because according to it\nwe cannot say that two objects have all their properties in common. (Even\nif this proposition is never correct, it still has sense .)\n5.5303 Roughly speaking, to say of two things that they are identical is\nnonsense, and to say of one thing that it is identical with itself is to\nsay nothing at all.\n5.531 Thus I do not write 'f(a, b) . a = b', but 'f(a, a)' (or 'f(b, b));\nand not 'f(a,b) . Pa = b', but 'f(a, b)'.\n5.532 And analogously I do not write '(dx, y) . f(x, y) . x = y', but '(dx)\n. f(x, x)'; and not '(dx, y) . f(x, y) . Px = y', but '(dx, y) . f(x, y)'.\n5.5321 Thus, for example, instead of '(x) : fx z x = a' we write '(dx) . fx\n. z : (dx, y) . fx. fy'. And the proposition, 'Only one x satisfies f( )',\nwill read '(dx) . fx : P(dx, y) . fx . fy'.\n5.533 The identity-sign, therefore, is not an essential constituent of\nconceptual notation.\n5.534 And now we see that in a correct conceptual notation pseudo-\npropositions like 'a = a', 'a = b . b = c . z a = c', '(x) . x = x', '(dx)\n. x = a', etc. cannot even be written down.\n5.535 This also disposes of all the problems that were connected with such\npseudo-propositions. All the problems that Russell's 'axiom of infinity'\nbrings with it can be solved at this point. What the axiom of infinity is\nintended to say would express itself in language through the existence of\ninfinitely many names with different meanings.\n5.5351 There are certain cases in which one is tempted to use expressions\nof the form 'a = a' or 'p z p' and the like. In fact, this happens when one\nwants to talk about prototypes, e.g. about proposition, thing, etc. Thus in\nRussell's Principles of Mathematics 'p is a proposition'--which is nonsense-\n-was given the symbolic rendering 'p z p' and placed as an hypothesis in\nfront of certain propositions in order to exclude from their argument-\nplaces everything but propositions. (It is nonsense to place the hypothesis\n'p z p' in front of a proposition, in order to ensure that its arguments\nshall have the right form, if only because with a non-proposition as\nargument the hypothesis becomes not false but nonsensical, and because\narguments of the wrong kind make the proposition itself nonsensical, so\nthat it preserves itself from wrong arguments just as well, or as badly, as\nthe hypothesis without sense that was appended for that purpose.)\n5.5352 In the same way people have wanted to express, 'There are no things\n', by writing 'P(dx) . x = x'. But even if this were a proposition, would\nit not be equally true if in fact 'there were things' but they were not\nidentical with themselves?\n5.54 In the general propositional form propositions occur in other\npropositions only as bases of truth-operations.\n5.541 At first sight it looks as if it were also possible for one\nproposition to occur in another in a different way. Particularly with\ncertain forms of proposition in psychology, such as 'A believes that p is\nthe case' and A has the thought p', etc. For if these are considered\nsuperficially, it looks as if the proposition p stood in some kind of\nrelation to an object A. (And in modern theory of knowledge (Russell,\nMoore, etc.) these propositions have actually been construed in this way.)\n5.542 It is clear, however, that 'A believes that p', 'A has the thought\np', and 'A says p' are of the form '\"p\" says p': and this does not involve\na correlation of a fact with an object, but rather the correlation of facts\nby means of the correlation of their objects.\n5.5421 This shows too that there is no such thing as the soul--the subject,\netc.--as it is conceived in the superficial psychology of the present day.\nIndeed a composite soul would no longer be a soul.\n5.5422 The correct explanation of the form of the proposition, 'A makes the\njudgement p', must show that it is impossible for a judgement to be a piece\nof nonsense. (Russell's theory does not satisfy this requirement.)\n5.5423 To perceive a complex means to perceive that its constituents are\nrelated to one another in such and such a way. This no doubt also explains\nwhy there are two possible ways of seeing the figure as a cube; and all\nsimilar phenomena. For we really see two different facts. (If I look in the\nfirst place at the corners marked a and only glance at the b's, then the\na's appear to be in front, and vice versa).\n5.55 We now have to answer a priori the question about all the possible\nforms of elementary propositions. Elementary propositions consist of names.\nSince, however, we are unable to give the number of names with different\nmeanings, we are also unable to give the composition of elementary\npropositions.\n5.551 Our fundamental principle is that whenever a question can be decided\nby logic at all it must be possible to decide it without more ado. (And if\nwe get into a position where we have to look at the world for an answer to\nsuch a problem, that shows that we are on a completely wrong track.)\n5.552 The 'experience' that we need in order to understand logic is not\nthat something or other is the state of things, but that something is :\nthat, however, is not an experience. Logic is prior to every experience--\nthat something is so . It is prior to the question 'How?' not prior to the\nquestion 'What?'\n5.5521 And if this were not so, how could we apply logic? We might put it\nin this way: if there would be a logic even if there were no world, how\nthen could there be a logic given that there is a world?\n5.553 Russell said that there were simple relations between different\nnumbers of things (individuals). But between what numbers? And how is this\nsupposed to be decided?--By experience? (There is no pre-eminent number.)\n5.554 It would be completely arbitrary to give any specific form.\n5.5541 It is supposed to be possible to answer a priori the question\nwhether I can get into a position in which I need the sign for a 27-termed\nrelation in order to signify something.\n5.5542 But is it really legitimate even to ask such a question? Can we set\nup a form of sign without knowing whether anything can correspond to it?\nDoes it make sense to ask what there must be in order that something can be\nthe case?\n5.555 Clearly we have some concept of elementary propositions quite apart\nfrom their particular logical forms. But when there is a system by which we\ncan create symbols, the system is what is important for logic and not the\nindividual symbols. And anyway, is it really possible that in logic I\nshould have to deal with forms that I can invent? What I have to deal with\nmust be that which makes it possible for me to invent them.\n5.556 There cannot be a hierarchy of the forms of elementary propositions.\nWe can foresee only what we ourselves construct.\n5.5561 Empirical reality is limited by the totality of objects. The limit\nalso makes itself manifest in the totality of elementary propositions.\nHierarchies are and must be independent of reality.\n5.5562 If we know on purely logical grounds that there must be elementary\npropositions, then everyone who understands propositions in their C form\nmust know It.\n5.5563 In fact, all the propositions of our everyday language, just as they\nstand, are in perfect logical order.--That utterly simple thing, which we\nhave to formulate here, is not a likeness of the truth, but the truth\nitself in its entirety. (Our problems are not abstract, but perhaps the\nmost concrete that there are.)\n5.557 The application of logic decides what elementary propositions there\nare. What belongs to its application, logic cannot anticipate. It is clear\nthat logic must not clash with its application. But logic has to be in\ncontact with its application. Therefore logic and its application must not\noverlap.\n5.5571 If I cannot say a priori what elementary propositions there are,\nthen the attempt to do so must lead to obvious nonsense. 5.6 The limits of\nmy language mean the limits of my world.\n5.61 Logic pervades the world: the limits of the world are also its limits.\nSo we cannot say in logic, 'The world has this in it, and this, but not\nthat.' For that would appear to presuppose that we were excluding certain\npossibilities, and this cannot be the case, since it would require that\nlogic should go beyond the limits of the world; for only in that way could\nit view those limits from the other side as well. We cannot think what we\ncannot think; so what we cannot think we cannot say either.\n5.62 This remark provides the key to the problem, how much truth there is\nin solipsism. For what the solipsist means is quite correct; only it cannot\nbe said , but makes itself manifest. The world is my world: this is\nmanifest in the fact that the limits of language (of that language which\nalone I understand) mean the limits of my world.\n5.621 The world and life are one.\n5.63 I am my world. (The microcosm.)\n5.631 There is no such thing as the subject that thinks or entertains\nideas. If I wrote a book called The World as l found it , I should have to\ninclude a report on my body, and should have to say which parts were\nsubordinate to my will, and which were not, etc., this being a method of\nisolating the subject, or rather of showing that in an important sense\nthere is no subject; for it alone could not be mentioned in that book.--\n5.632 The subject does not belong to the world: rather, it is a limit of\nthe world.\n5.633 Where in the world is a metaphysical subject to be found? You will\nsay that this is exactly like the case of the eye and the visual field. But\nreally you do not see the eye. And nothing in the visual field allows you\nto infer that it is seen by an eye.\n5.6331 For the form of the visual field is surely not like this\n5.634 This is connected with the fact that no part of our experience is at\nthe same time a priori. Whatever we see could be other than it is. Whatever\nwe can describe at all could be other than it is. There is no a priori\norder of things.\n5.64 Here it can be seen that solipsism, when its implications are followed\nout strictly, coincides with pure realism. The self of solipsism shrinks to\na point without extension, and there remains the reality co-ordinated with\nit.\n5.641 Thus there really is a sense in which philosophy can talk about the\nself in a non-psychological way. What brings the self into philosophy is\nthe fact that 'the world is my world'. The philosophical self is not the\nhuman being, not the human body, or the human soul, with which psychology\ndeals, but rather the metaphysical subject, the limit of the world--not a\npart of it.\n6 The general form of a truth-function is [p, E, N(E)]. This is the general\nform of a proposition.\n6.001 What this says is just that every proposition is a result of\nsuccessive applications to elementary propositions of the operation N(E)\n6.002 If we are given the general form according to which propositions are\nconstructed, then with it we are also given the general form according to\nwhich one proposition can be generated out of another by means of an\noperation.\n6.01 Therefore the general form of an operation /'(n) is [E, N(E)] ' (n) (\n= [n, E, N(E)]). This is the most general form of transition from one\nproposition to another.\n6.02 And this is how we arrive at numbers. I give the following definitions\nx = /0x Def., /'/v'x = /v+1'x Def. So, in accordance with these rules,\nwhich deal with signs, we write the series x, /'x, /'/'x, /'/'/'x, ... , in\nthe following way /0'x, /0+1'x, /0+1+1'x, /0+1+1+1'x, ... . Therefore,\ninstead of '[x, E, /'E]', I write '[/0'x, /v'x, /v+1'x]'. And I give the\nfollowing definitions 0 + 1 = 1 Def., 0 + 1 + 1 = 2 Def., 0 + 1 + 1 +1 = 3\nDef., (and so on).\n6.021 A number is the exponent of an operation.\n6.022 The concept of number is simply what is common to all numbers, the\ngeneral form of a number. The concept of number is the variable number. And\nthe concept of numerical equality is the general form of all particular\ncases of numerical equality.\n6.03 The general form of an integer is [0, E, E +1].\n6.031 The theory of classes is completely superfluous in mathematics. This\nis connected with the fact that the generality required in mathematics is\nnot accidental generality.\n6.1 The propositions of logic are tautologies.\n6.11 Therefore the propositions of logic say nothing. (They are the\nanalytic propositions.)\n6.111 All theories that make a proposition of logic appear to have content\nare false. One might think, for example, that the words 'true' and 'false'\nsignified two properties among other properties, and then it would seem to\nbe a remarkable fact that every proposition possessed one of these\nproperties. On this theory it seems to be anything but obvious, just as,\nfor instance, the proposition, 'All roses are either yellow or red', would\nnot sound obvious even if it were true. Indeed, the logical proposition\nacquires all the characteristics of a proposition of natural science and\nthis is the sure sign that it has been construed wrongly.\n6.112 The correct explanation of the propositions of logic must assign to\nthem a unique status among all propositions.\n6.113 It is the peculiar mark of logical propositions that one can\nrecognize that they are true from the symbol alone, and this fact contains\nin itself the whole philosophy of logic. And so too it is a very important\nfact that the truth or falsity of non-logical propositions cannot be\nrecognized from the propositions alone.\n6.12 The fact that the propositions of logic are tautologies shows the\nformal--logical--properties of language and the world. The fact that a\ntautology is yielded by this particular way of connecting its constituents\ncharacterizes the logic of its constituents. If propositions are to yield a\ntautology when they are connected in a certain way, they must have certain\nstructural properties. So their yielding a tautology when combined in this\nshows that they possess these structural properties.\n6.1201 For example, the fact that the propositions 'p' and 'Pp' in the\ncombination '(p . Pp)' yield a tautology shows that they contradict one\nanother. The fact that the propositions 'p z q', 'p', and 'q', combined\nwith one another in the form '(p z q) . (p) :z: (q)', yield a tautology\nshows that q follows from p and p z q. The fact that '(x) . fxx :z: fa' is\na tautology shows that fa follows from (x) . fx. Etc. etc.\n6.1202 It is clear that one could achieve the same purpose by using\ncontradictions instead of tautologies.\n6.1203 In order to recognize an expression as a tautology, in cases where\nno generality-sign occurs in it, one can employ the following intuitive\nmethod: instead of 'p', 'q', 'r', etc. I write 'TpF', 'TqF', 'TrF', etc.\nTruth-combinations I express by means of brackets, e.g. and I use lines to\nexpress the correlation of the truth or falsity of the whole proposition\nwith the truth-combinations of its truth-arguments, in the following way So\nthis sign, for instance, would represent the proposition p z q. Now, by way\nof example, I wish to examine the proposition P(p .Pp) (the law of\ncontradiction) in order to determine whether it is a tautology. In our\nnotation the form 'PE' is written as and the form 'E . n' as Hence the\nproposition P(p . Pp). reads as follows If we here substitute 'p' for 'q'\nand examine how the outermost T and F are connected with the innermost\nones, the result will be that the truth of the whole proposition is\ncorrelated with all the truth-combinations of its argument, and its falsity\nwith none of the truth-combinations.\n6.121 The propositions of logic demonstrate the logical properties of\npropositions by combining them so as to form propositions that say nothing.\nThis method could also be called a zero-method. In a logical proposition,\npropositions are brought into equilibrium with one another, and the state\nof equilibrium then indicates what the logical constitution of these\npropositions must be.\n6.122 It follows from this that we can actually do without logical\npropositions; for in a suitable notation we can in fact recognize the\nformal properties of propositions by mere inspection of the propositions\nthemselves.\n6.1221 If, for example, two propositions 'p' and 'q' in the combination 'p\nz q' yield a tautology, then it is clear that q follows from p. For\nexample, we see from the two propositions themselves that 'q' follows from\n'p z q . p', but it is also possible to show it in this way: we combine\nthem to form 'p z q . p :z: q', and then show that this is a tautology.\n6.1222 This throws some light on the question why logical propositions\ncannot be confirmed by experience any more than they can be refuted by it.\nNot only must a proposition of logic be irrefutable by any possible\nexperience, but it must also be unconfirmable by any possible experience.\n6.1223 Now it becomes clear why people have often felt as if it were for us\nto 'postulate ' the 'truths of logic'. The reason is that we can postulate\nthem in so far as we can postulate an adequate notation.\n6.1224 It also becomes clear now why logic was called the theory of forms\nand of inference.\n6.123 Clearly the laws of logic cannot in their turn be subject to laws of\nlogic. (There is not, as Russell thought, a special law of contradiction\nfor each 'type'; one law is enough, since it is not applied to itself.)\n6.1231 The mark of a logical proposition is not general validity. To be\ngeneral means no more than to be accidentally valid for all things. An\nungeneralized proposition can be tautological just as well as a generalized\none.\n6.1232 The general validity of logic might be called essential, in contrast\nwith the accidental general validity of such propositions as 'All men are\nmortal'. Propositions like Russell's 'axiom of reducibility' are not\nlogical propositions, and this explains our feeling that, even if they were\ntrue, their truth could only be the result of a fortunate accident.\n6.1233 It is possible to imagine a world in which the axiom of reducibility\nis not valid. It is clear, however, that logic has nothing to do with the\nquestion whether our world really is like that or not.\n6.124 The propositions of logic describe the scaffolding of the world, or\nrather they represent it. They have no 'subject-matter'. They presuppose\nthat names have meaning and elementary propositions sense; and that is\ntheir connexion with the world. It is clear that something about the world\nmust be indicated by the fact that certain combinations of symbols--whose\nessence involves the possession of a determinate character--are\ntautologies. This contains the decisive point. We have said that some\nthings are arbitrary in the symbols that we use and that some things are\nnot. In logic it is only the latter that express: but that means that logic\nis not a field in which we express what we wish with the help of signs, but\nrather one in which the nature of the absolutely necessary signs speaks for\nitself. If we know the logical syntax of any sign-language, then we have\nalready been given all the propositions of logic.\n6.125 It is possible--indeed possible even according to the old conception\nof logic--to give in advance a description of all 'true' logical\npropositions.\n6.1251 Hence there can never be surprises in logic.\n6.126 One can calculate whether a proposition belongs to logic, by\ncalculating the logical properties of the symbol. And this is what we do\nwhen we 'prove' a logical proposition. For, without bothering about sense\nor meaning, we construct the logical proposition out of others using only\nrules that deal with signs . The proof of logical propositions consists in\nthe following process: we produce them out of other logical propositions by\nsuccessively applying certain operations that always generate further\ntautologies out of the initial ones. (And in fact only tautologies follow\nfrom a tautology.) Of course this way of showing that the propositions of\nlogic are tautologies is not at all essential to logic, if only because the\npropositions from which the proof starts must show without any proof that\nthey are tautologies.\n6.1261 In logic process and result are equivalent. (Hence the absence of\nsurprise.)\n6.1262 Proof in logic is merely a mechanical expedient to facilitate the\nrecognition of tautologies in complicated cases.\n6.1263 Indeed, it would be altogether too remarkable if a proposition that\nhad sense could be proved logically from others, and so too could a logical\nproposition. It is clear from the start that a logical proof of a\nproposition that has sense and a proof in logic must be two entirely\ndifferent things.\n6.1264 A proposition that has sense states something, which is shown by its\nproof to be so. In logic every proposition is the form of a proof. Every\nproposition of logic is a modus ponens represented in signs. (And one\ncannot express the modus ponens by means of a proposition.)\n6.1265 It is always possible to construe logic in such a way that every\nproposition is its own proof.\n6.127 All the propositions of logic are of equal status: it is not the case\nthat some of them are essentially derived propositions. Every tautology\nitself shows that it is a tautology.\n6.1271 It is clear that the number of the 'primitive propositions of logic'\nis arbitrary, since one could derive logic from a single primitive\nproposition, e.g. by simply constructing the logical product of Frege's\nprimitive propositions. (Frege would perhaps say that we should then no\nlonger have an immediately self-evident primitive proposition. But it is\nremarkable that a thinker as rigorous as Frege appealed to the degree of\nself-evidence as the criterion of a logical proposition.)\n6.13 Logic is not a body of doctrine, but a mirror-image of the world.\nLogic is transcendental.\n6.2 Mathematics is a logical method. The propositions of mathematics are\nequations, and therefore pseudo-propositions.\n6.21 A proposition of mathematics does not express a thought.\n6.211 Indeed in real life a mathematical proposition is never what we want.\nRather, we make use of mathematical propositions only in inferences from\npropositions that do not belong to mathematics to others that likewise do\nnot belong to mathematics. (In philosophy the question, 'What do we\nactually use this word or this proposition for?' repeatedly leads to\nvaluable insights.)\n6.22 The logic of the world, which is shown in tautologies by the\npropositions of logic, is shown in equations by mathematics.\n6.23 If two expressions are combined by means of the sign of equality, that\nmeans that they can be substituted for one another. But it must be manifest\nin the two expressions themselves whether this is the case or not. When two\nexpressions can be substituted for one another, that characterizes their\nlogical form.\n6.231 It is a property of affirmation that it can be construed as double\nnegation. It is a property of '1 + 1 + 1 + 1' that it can be construed as\n'(1 + 1) + (1 + 1)'.\n6.232 Frege says that the two expressions have the same meaning but\ndifferent senses. But the essential point about an equation is that it is\nnot necessary in order to show that the two expressions connected by the\nsign of equality have the same meaning, since this can be seen from the two\nexpressions themselves.\n6.2321 And the possibility of proving the propositions of mathematics means\nsimply that their correctness can be perceived without its being necessary\nthat what they express should itself be compared with the facts in order to\ndetermine its correctness.\n6.2322 It is impossible to assert the identity of meaning of two\nexpressions. For in order to be able to assert anything about their\nmeaning, I must know their meaning, and I cannot know their meaning without\nknowing whether what they mean is the same or different.\n6.2323 An equation merely marks the point of view from which I consider the\ntwo expressions: it marks their equivalence in meaning.\n6.233 The question whether intuition is needed for the solution of\nmathematical problems must be given the answer that in this case language\nitself provides the necessary intuition.\n6.2331 The process of calculating serves to bring about that intuition.\nCalculation is not an experiment.\n6.234 Mathematics is a method of logic.\n6.2341 It is the essential characteristic of mathematical method that it\nemploys equations. For it is because of this method that every proposition\nof mathematics must go without saying.\n6.24 The method by which mathematics arrives at its equations is the method\nof substitution. For equations express the substitutability of two\nexpressions and, starting from a number of equations, we advance to new\nequations by substituting different expressions in accordance with the\nequations.\n6.241 Thus the proof of the proposition 2 t 2 = 4 runs as follows: (/v)n'x\n= /v x u'x Def., /2 x 2'x = (/2)2'x = (/2)1 + 1'x = /2' /2'x = /1 + 1'/1 +\n1'x = (/'/)'(/'/)'x =/'/'/'/'x = /1 + 1 + 1 + 1'x = /4'x. 6.3 The\nexploration of logic means the exploration of everything that is subject to\nlaw . And outside logic everything is accidental.\n6.31 The so-called law of induction cannot possibly be a law of logic,\nsince it is obviously a proposition with sense.---Nor, therefore, can it be\nan a priori law.\n6.32 The law of causality is not a law but the form of a law.\n6.321 'Law of causality'--that is a general name. And just as in mechanics,\nfor example, there are 'minimum-principles', such as the law of least\naction, so too in physics there are causal laws, laws of the causal form.\n6.3211 Indeed people even surmised that there must be a 'law of least\naction' before they knew exactly how it went. (Here, as always, what is\ncertain a priori proves to be something purely logical.)\n6.33 We do not have an a priori belief in a law of conservation, but rather\na priori knowledge of the possibility of a logical form.\n6.34 All such propositions, including the principle of sufficient reason,\ntile laws of continuity in nature and of least effort in nature, etc. etc.--\nall these are a priori insights about the forms in which the propositions\nof science can be cast.\n6.341 Newtonian mechanics, for example, imposes a unified form on the\ndescription of the world. Let us imagine a white surface with irregular\nblack spots on it. We then say that whatever kind of picture these make, I\ncan always approximate as closely as I wish to the description of it by\ncovering the surface with a sufficiently fine square mesh, and then saying\nof every square whether it is black or white. In this way I shall have\nimposed a unified form on the description of the surface. The form is\noptional, since I could have achieved the same result by using a net with a\ntriangular or hexagonal mesh. Possibly the use of a triangular mesh would\nhave made the description simpler: that is to say, it might be that we\ncould describe the surface more accurately with a coarse triangular mesh\nthan with a fine square mesh (or conversely), and so on. The different nets\ncorrespond to different systems for describing the world. Mechanics\ndetermines one form of description of the world by saying that all\npropositions used in the description of the world must be obtained in a\ngiven way from a given set of propositions--the axioms of mechanics. It\nthus supplies the bricks for building the edifice of science, and it says,\n'Any building that you want to erect, whatever it may be, must somehow be\nconstructed with these bricks, and with these alone.' (Just as with the\nnumber-system we must be able to write down any number we wish, so with the\nsystem of mechanics we must be able to write down any proposition of\nphysics that we wish.)\n6.342 And now we can see the relative position of logic and mechanics. (The\nnet might also consist of more than one kind of mesh: e.g. we could use\nboth triangles and hexagons.) The possibility of describing a picture like\nthe one mentioned above with a net of a given form tells us nothing about\nthe picture. (For that is true of all such pictures.) But what does\ncharacterize the picture is that it can be described completely by a\nparticular net with a particular size of mesh. Similarly the possibility of\ndescribing the world by means of Newtonian mechanics tells us nothing about\nthe world: but what does tell us something about it is the precise way in\nwhich it is possible to describe it by these means. We are also told\nsomething about the world by the fact that it can be described more simply\nwith one system of mechanics than with another.\n6.343 Mechanics is an attempt to construct according to a single plan all\nthe true propositions that we need for the description of the world.\n6.3431 The laws of physics, with all their logical apparatus, still speak,\nhowever indirectly, about the objects of the world.\n6.3432 We ought not to forget that any description of the world by means of\nmechanics will be of the completely general kind. For example, it will\nnever mention particular point-masses: it will only talk about any point-\nmasses whatsoever.\n6.35 Although the spots in our picture are geometrical figures,\nnevertheless geometry can obviously say nothing at all about their actual\nform and position. The network, however, is purely geometrical; all its\nproperties can be given a priori. Laws like the principle of sufficient\nreason, etc. are about the net and not about what the net describes.\n6.36 If there were a law of causality, it might be put in the following\nway: There are laws of nature. But of course that cannot be said: it makes\nitself manifest.\n6.361 One might say, using Hertt:'s terminology, that only connexions that\nare subject to law are thinkable.\n6.3611 We cannot compare a process with 'the passage of time'--there is no\nsuch thing--but only with another process (such as the working of a\nchronometer). Hence we can describe the lapse of time only by relying on\nsome other process. Something exactly analogous applies to space: e.g. when\npeople say that neither of two events (which exclude one another) can\noccur, because there is nothing to cause the one to occur rather than the\nother, it is really a matter of our being unable to describe one of the two\nevents unless there is some sort of asymmetry to be found. And if such an\nasymmetry is to be found, we can regard it as the cause of the occurrence\nof the one and the non-occurrence of the other.\n6.36111 Kant's problem about the right hand and the left hand, which cannot\nbe made to coincide, exists even in two dimensions. Indeed, it exists in\none-dimensional space in which the two congruent figures, a and b, cannot\nbe made to coincide unless they are moved out of this space. The right hand\nand the left hand are in fact completely congruent. It is quite irrelevant\nthat they cannot be made to coincide. A right-hand glove could be put on\nthe left hand, if it could be turned round in four-dimensional space.\n6.362 What can be described can happen too: and what the law of causality\nis meant to exclude cannot even be described.\n6.363 The procedure of induction consists in accepting as true the simplest\nlaw that can be reconciled with our experiences.\n6.3631 This procedure, however, has no logical justification but only a\npsychological one. It is clear that there are no grounds for believing that\nthe simplest eventuality will in fact be realized.\n6.36311 It is an hypothesis that the sun will rise tomorrow: and this means\nthat we do not know whether it will rise.\n6.37 There is no compulsion making one thing happen because another has\nhappened. The only necessity that exists is logical necessity.\n6.371 The whole modern conception of the world is founded on the illusion\nthat the so-called laws of nature are the explanations of natural\nphenomena.\n6.372 Thus people today stop at the laws of nature, treating them as\nsomething inviolable, just as God and Fate were treated in past ages. And\nin fact both are right and both wrong: though the view of the ancients is\nclearer in so far as they have a clear and acknowledged terminus, while the\nmodern system tries to make it look as if everything were explained.\n6.373 The world is independent of my will.\n6.374 Even if all that we wish for were to happen, still this would only be\na favour granted by fate, so to speak: for there is no logical connexion\nbetween the will and the world, which would guarantee it, and the supposed\nphysical connexion itself is surely not something that we could will.\n6.375 Just as the only necessity that exists is logical necessity, so too\nthe only impossibility that exists is logical impossibility.\n6.3751 For example, the simultaneous presence of two colours at the same\nplace in the visual field is impossible, in fact logically impossible,\nsince it is ruled out by the logical structure of colour. Let us think how\nthis contradiction appears in physics: more or less as follows--a particle\ncannot have two velocities at the same time; that is to say, it cannot be\nin two places at the same time; that is to say, particles that are in\ndifferent places at the same time cannot be identical. (It is clear that\nthe logical product of two elementary propositions can neither be a\ntautology nor a contradiction. The statement that a point in the visual\nfield has two different colours at the same time is a contradiction.)\n6.4 All propositions are of equal value.\n6.41 The sense of the world must lie outside the world. In the world\neverything is as it is, and everything happens as it does happen: in it no\nvalue exists--and if it did exist, it would have no value. If there is any\nvalue that does have value, it must lie outside the whole sphere of what\nhappens and is the case. For all that happens and is the case is\naccidental. What makes it non-accidental cannot lie within the world, since\nif it did it would itself be accidental. It must lie outside the world.\n6.42 So too it is impossible for there to be propositions of ethics.\nPropositions can express nothing that is higher.\n6.421 It is clear that ethics cannot be put into words. Ethics is\ntranscendental. (Ethics and aesthetics are one and the same.)\n6.422 When an ethical law of the form, 'Thou shalt ...' is laid down, one's\nfirst thought is, 'And what if I do, not do it?' It is clear, however, that\nethics has nothing to do with punishment and reward in the usual sense of\nthe terms. So our question about the consequences of an action must be\nunimportant.--At least those consequences should not be events. For there\nmust be something right about the question we posed. There must indeed be\nsome kind of ethical reward and ethical punishment, but they must reside in\nthe action itself. (And it is also clear that the reward must be something\npleasant and the punishment something unpleasant.)\n6.423 It is impossible to speak about the will in so far as it is the\nsubject of ethical attributes. And the will as a phenomenon is of interest\nonly to psychology.\n6.43 If the good or bad exercise of the will does alter the world, it can\nalter only the limits of the world, not the facts--not what can be\nexpressed by means of language. In short the effect must be that it becomes\nan altogether different world. It must, so to speak, wax and wane as a\nwhole. The world of the happy man is a different one from that of the\nunhappy man.\n6.431 So too at death the world does not alter, but comes to an end.\n6.4311 Death is not an event in life: we do not live to experience death.\nIf we take eternity to mean not infinite temporal duration but\ntimelessness, then eternal life belongs to those who live in the present.\nOur life has no end in just the way in which our visual field has no\nlimits.\n6.4312 Not only is there no guarantee of the temporal immortality of the\nhuman soul, that is to say of its eternal survival after death; but, in any\ncase, this assumption completely fails to accomplish the purpose for which\nit has always been intended. Or is some riddle solved by my surviving for\never? Is not this eternal life itself as much of a riddle as our present\nlife? The solution of the riddle of life in space and time lies outside\nspace and time. (It is certainly not the solution of any problems of\nnatural science that is required.)\n6.432 How things are in the world is a matter of complete indifference for\nwhat is higher. God does not reveal himself in the world.\n6.4321 The facts all contribute only to setting the problem, not to its\nsolution.\n6.44 It is not how things are in the world that is mystical, but that it\nexists.\n6.45 To view the world sub specie aeterni is to view it as a whole--a\nlimited whole. Feeling the world as a limited whole--it is this that is\nmystical.\n6.5 When the answer cannot be put into words, neither can the question be\nput into words. The riddle does not exist. If a question can be framed at\nall, it is also possible to answer it.\n6.51 Scepticism is not irrefutable, but obviously nonsensical, when it\ntries to raise doubts where no questions can be asked. For doubt can exist\nonly where a question exists, a question only where an answer exists, and\nan answer only where something can be said.\n6.52 We feel that even when all possible scientific questions have been\nanswered, the problems of life remain completely untouched. Of course there\nare then no questions left, and this itself is the answer.\n6.521 The solution of the problem of life is seen in the vanishing of the\nproblem. (Is not this the reason why those who have found after a long\nperiod of doubt that the sense of life became clear to them have then been\nunable to say what constituted that sense?)\n6.522 There are, indeed, things that cannot be put into words. They make\nthemselves manifest. They are what is mystical.\n6.53 The correct method in philosophy would really be the following: to say\nnothing except what can be said, i.e. propositions of natural science--i.e.\nsomething that has nothing to do with philosophy -- and then, whenever\nsomeone else wanted to say something metaphysical, to demonstrate to him\nthat he had failed to give a meaning to certain signs in his propositions.\nAlthough it would not be satisfying to the other person--he would not have\nthe feeling that we were teaching him philosophy--this method would be the\nonly strictly correct one.\n6.54 My propositions are elucidatory in this way: he who understands me\nfinally recognizes them as senseless, when he has climbed out through them,\non them, over them. (He must so to speak throw away the ladder, after he\nhas climbed up on it.) He must transcend these propositions, and then he\nwill see the world aright.\n7 What we cannot speak about we must pass over in silence.", "source": "tractatus.txt"}
