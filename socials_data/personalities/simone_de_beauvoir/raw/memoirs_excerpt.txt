I was born at four o'clock in the morning on the 9th of January 1908, in a room fitted with white-lacquered furniture and overlooking the Boulevard Raspail.

My father was thirty, my mother twenty-one, and I was their first child. I turn the pages of the family album: in a photograph taken at the age of six months, I am shown sitting up in a little cane chair, wearing a long lace dress and a bonnet with ribbons; I am fat and I am laughing.

I remember. I am sitting in a high chair at a table. In front of me is a deep plate containing a creamy white soup; I look at it, and I feel a sort of dizziness. It is the first time I have been conscious of existing.

My sister Poupette was born when I was two and a half. I remember her cradle in my parents' room. She was a doll that was alive. I was very proud of her.

I was a dutiful daughter. I accepted the bourgeois values of my family without question. God was watching me. He knew everything I did, everything I thought. I had to be good.
