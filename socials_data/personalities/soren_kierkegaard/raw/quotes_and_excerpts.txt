Preface

Not only in the world of commerce but also in the world of ideas our age is putting on a veritable clearance sale. Everything may be had at such a bargain that it is doubtful whether in the end there is anybody who will want to buy. Every speculative price-fixer who conscientiously directs attention to the significant march of modern philosophy, every privat-docent, tutor, and student, every crofter and cottar in philosophy, is not content with doubting everything but goes further. Perhaps it would be untimely and ill-timed to ask them where they are going, but surely it is courteous and assumes no responsibility to inquire whether they have doubted everything. It seems to me, however, that they have made a peculiar disposition of the matter; for they do not say that they are doubting everything, but that they have doubted everything. So the transition to the next stage is easy enough.

I am not one of those who has doubted everything, and I am not one of those who can say that he has done so. I am a freelancer who has no system, who neither has nor wishes to have a system, who neither has subscribed nor wishes to subscribe to any system. I am a freelancer who writes because it is a luxury to me, and who writes as I please.

What I really lack is to be clear in my mind what I am to do, not what I am to know, except in so far as a certain understanding must precede every action. The thing is to understand myself, to see what God really wishes me to do; the thing is to find a truth which is true for me, to find the idea for which I can live and die. What is the use of discovering so-called objective truth, of working through all the systems of philosophy and of being able, if required, to review them all and show up the inconsistencies within each system; -what good would it do me if truth stood before me, cold and naked, not caring whether I recognised her or not, and producing in me a shudder of fear rather than a trusting devotion? I certainly do not deny that I still recognize an imperative of understanding and that through it one can work upon men, but it must be taken up into my life, and that is what I now recognize as the most important thing.

...

The crowd is untruth. There is therefore no one who has more contempt for what it is to be a man than he who makes it his profession to lead the crowd. Let him be someone who has real power and authority—it is still the same. He who can only maintain his position by leading the crowd is no more a man than the individual in the crowd; he is only a speciman of the species.

...

Anxiety is the dizziness of freedom.

...

Life can only be understood backwards; but it must be lived forwards.

...

People understand me so poorly that they don't even understand my complaint about them not understanding me.

...

The most common form of despair is not being who you are.

...

Faith is the highest passion in a human being. Many in every generation may not come that far, but none comes further.
