The self is a relation that relates itself to itself or is the relation's relating itself to itself in the relation; the self is not the relation but that the relation relates itself to itself. A human being is a synthesis of the infinite and the finite, of the temporal and the eternal, of freedom and necessity, in short, a synthesis. A synthesis is a relation between two. Considered in this way, a human being is still not a self.

Despair is the sickness unto death. It is not a physical sickness, but a sickness of the spirit. And this sickness is not one that we contract and then die from, like a fever. No, the torment of despair is precisely that one cannot die. It is to be sick unto death but unable to die. The dying is not the end, but the dying is continuously converted into living. The despairing person cannot consume himself, cannot get rid of himself, cannot become nothing. This is the formula for all despair: to want to be oneself, or not to want to be oneself.

The commonest form of despair is not knowing that one is in despair. It is the despair of the immediate man, who lives in the category of the finite and the temporal, and has no consciousness of the eternal. He may be happy, successful, and well-adjusted, but he is in despair because he has no self. He is a spiritless man.
