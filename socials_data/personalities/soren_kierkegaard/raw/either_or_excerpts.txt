DIAPSAMATA

What is a poet? An unhappy man who in his heart harbors a deep anguish, but whose lips are so fashioned that the moans and cries which pass over them are transformed into ravishing music. His fate is like that of the unfortunate victims whom the tyrant Phalaris imprisoned in a brazen bull, and slowly tortured over a steady fire; their cries could not reach the tyrant’s ears so as to strike terror into his heart; when they reached his ears they sounded like sweet music.

I feel as if I were a piece in a game of chess, when my opponent says of it: That piece cannot be moved.

...

My sorrow is my castle, which like an eagle’s eyrie is built high up on the mountain peak among the clouds. No one can storm it. From it I fly down into reality to seize my prey; but I do not remain down there, I bring my quarry home; and this prey is a picture I weave into the tapestries of my palace.

The Rotation of Crops

People with experience maintain that proceeding from a basic principle is the only reasonable way to behave. I grant them that and am also content to adopt the principle which is generally acknowledged to be the starting point for all human activity—namely, the boredom of it.

The Aesthetic Validity of Marriage

(Letter from Judge Vilhelm)

My Dear Friend,

You are a young man, in many respects a happily gifted young man. You are free, independent, have no family ties to bind you, no professional cares to weigh you down, you have the means to live for your pleasure, and you have enough mental agility to know how to catch the interesting side of life. You are, in short, what one might call a lucky fellow.

And yet you are unhappy. Your mind is heavy, your heart is empty, your will is paralyzed. You hover above reality, but you have no foothold in it. You seek the interesting, but you find only the momentary. You are trapped in the aesthetic sphere, my friend, and you must make the movement to the ethical. You must choose!

To choose is to give your life a solemnity, a dignity, a worth that the aesthetic man knows nothing of. In choosing yourself, you choose your freedom.
