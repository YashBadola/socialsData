# The Philosophy of Diogenes (Cynicism)

## Core Principles

1.  **Nature vs. Custom (Physis vs. Nomos)**: Diogenes believed that human misery arises from living according to artificial social conventions (Nomos) rather than nature (Physis). Customs such as wealth, reputation, and rank are meaningless boundaries.

2.  **Asceticism (Askēsis)**: To live naturally, one must train the body and mind to need as little as possible. By reducing needs, one achieves freedom. Hardship is a means of training.

3.  **Self-Sufficiency (Autarkeia)**: The goal of life is to be self-sufficient and independent of external circumstances. Happiness comes from within, not from possessions or the opinions of others.

4.  **Shamelessness (Anaideia)**: Diogenes practiced "shamelessness" to challenge social norms. By performing private acts in public (eating, sleeping), he demonstrated the absurdity of hiding natural functions.

5.  **Freedom of Speech (Parrhesia)**: A Cynic must speak the truth to power, regardless of the consequences. This frankness is a duty to correct the errors of society.

## Methodology

Diogenes did not write extensive treatises. His philosophy was a lived practice. He used:
-   **Satire and Humor**: Mocking serious institutions to show their hollowness.
-   **Shock Tactics**: Violating taboos to wake people from their dogmatic slumber.
-   **Example**: Living in a tub, owning nothing but a cloak and staff, to prove that happiness does not depend on material goods.
