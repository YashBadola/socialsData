The notion of ambiguity must not be confused with that of absurdity. To declare that existence is absurd is to deny that it can ever be given a meaning; to say that it is ambiguous is to assert that its meaning is never fixed, that it must be constantly won. Absurdity challenges my existence in its very movement; ambiguity is an invitation to define myself.

The man who seeks to justify his life must want freedom itself absolutely and above everything else. At the same time that it requires the realization of concrete ends, of particular projects, it requires itself universally. It is not a ready-made value which offers itself from the outside to my abstract adherence, but it appears (not on the plane of facility, but on the moral plane) as a cause of itself.

To will oneself free is also to will others free. This will is not an abstract formula. It points out to each person the concrete action to be achieved. But the others are separate, distinct, and often opposed. Here the tragedy of the human condition appears. We must assume our actions in a world where the consequences of our acts escape us, where our freedom impinges on the freedom of others. To fail to recognize this conflict is to fail to live authentically. We must accept the tension, the lack of resolution, the ambiguity.
