For notwithstanding that all things happen according to this Reason, men act as though they had never had any experience in regard to it when they attempt such words and works as I am now relating, describing each thing according to its nature and explaining how it is ordered.

{"text": "Heraclitus of Ephesus (/\u02cch\u025br\u0259\u02c8kla\u026at\u0259s/; Greek: \u1f29\u03c1\u03ac\u03ba\u03bb\u03b5\u03b9\u03c4\u03bf\u03c2 \u1f41 \u1f18\u03c6\u03ad\u03c3\u03b9\u03bf\u03c2, H\u0113r\u00e1kleitos ho Eph\u00e9sios; c. 535 \u2013 c. 475 BC) was a pre-Socratic Greek philosopher, and a native of the city of Ephesus, then part of the Persian Empire. He was of distinguished parentage. Little is known about his early life and education, but he regarded himself as self-taught and a pioneer of wisdom. From the lonely life he led, and still more from the apparently riddled and allegedly paradoxical nature of his philosophy and his stress upon the needless unconsciousness of humankind, he was called \"The Obscure\" and the \"Weeping Philosopher\".\nHeraclitus was famous for his insistence on ever-present change as being the fundamental essence of the universe, as stated in the famous saying, \"No man ever steps in the same river twice\" (see panta rhei, below). This position was complemented by his stark commitment to a unity of opposites in the world, stating that \"the path up and down are one and the same\". Through these doctrines Heraclitus characterized all existing entities by pairs of contrary properties, whereby no entity may ever occupy a single state at a single time. This, along with his cryptic utterance that \"all entities come to be in accordance with this Logos\" (literally, \"word\", \"reason\", or \"account\") has been the subject of numerous interpretations.\nDiogenes relates that Heraclitus had a poor opinion of human affairs. He believed that Hesiod and Pythagoras lacked understanding though learned and that Homer and Archilochus deserved to be beaten. Laws needed to be defended as though they were city walls. Timon is said to have called him a \"mob-reviler.\" Heraclitus hated the Athenians and his fellow Ephesians, wishing the latter wealth in punishment for their wicked ways. Says Diogenes: \"Finally, he became a hater of his kind (misanthrope) and wandered the mountains ... making his diet of grass and herbs.\"\nDiogenes states that Heraclitus' work was \"a continuous treatise On Nature, but was divided into three discourses, one on the universe, another on politics, and a third on theology.\"\nAt some time in antiquity he acquired this epithet denoting that his major sayings were difficult to understand. According to Diogenes La\u00ebrtius, Timon of Phlius called him \"the riddler\" (\u03b1\u1f30\u03bd\u03b9\u03ba\u03c4\u03ae\u03c2 ainikt\u0113s), and explained that Heraclitus wrote his book \"rather unclearly\" (asaphesteron) so that only the \"capable\" should attempt it. By the time of Cicero he had become \"the dark\" (\u1f41 \u03a3\u03ba\u03bf\u03c4\u03b5\u03b9\u03bd\u03cc\u03c2 \u2014 ho Skotein\u00f3s) because he had spoken nimis obscur\u0113, \"too obscurely\", concerning nature and had done so deliberately in order to be misunderstood.", "source": "biography.txt"}
