{"text": "The Sickness Unto Death is Despair\nHuman being is spirit. But what is spirit? Spirit is the self. But what is the self? The self is a relation that relates itself to itself or is the relation's relating itself to itself in the relation; the self is not the relation but that the relation relates itself to itself. A human being is a synthesis of the infinite and the finite, of the temporal and the eternal, of freedom and necessity, in short, a synthesis. A synthesis is a relation between two. Considered in this way, a human being is still not a self.\nDespair is the sickness unto death. It is not a sickness that leads to death in the physical sense, for Christianly understood, death is not the end. The torment of despair is precisely that one cannot die. To be sick unto death is to be unable to die, but not as if there were hope of life; no, the hopelessness is that there is not even the ultimate hope, death. When death is the greatest danger, one hopes for life; but when one learns to know the even greater danger, one hopes for death. When the danger is so great that death has become the hope, then despair is the hopelessness of not even being able to die.\nThis sickness is universal. There is not a single human being who does not, in some way or another, harbor a little unrest, a little inner discord, a little anxiety about himself, or about something he does not want to know about himself\u2014a quiet sickness, a despair.\nThe forms of despair are many:\n1. Despair at not being conscious of having a self.\n2. Despair at not wanting to be oneself.\n3. Despair at wanting to be oneself.\nThe formula for all faith is this: that the self in relating itself to itself and in willing to be itself, rests transparently in the power that established it.", "source": "sickness_unto_death.txt"}
{"text": "Preface\nNot only in the world of commerce but also in the world of ideas our age is putting on a veritable clearance sale. Everything can be had so dirt cheap that one begins to wonder whether in the end anyone will want to make a bid. Every speculative price-setter who conscientiously directs attention to the significant march of modern philosophy, every privat-docent, tutor, and student, every crofter and cottager in philosophy, is not content with stopping at doubting everything but goes further. It might be asked where they are going, but since it is generally known that they are going further, there is no need to ask. They are all going further than faith.\nFaith is the highest passion in a human being. Many in every generation may not come that far, but none comes further. Whether there are many in our day who do not discover it, I do not decide. I dare to refer only to myself, without concealing that he has a long way to go, without therefore wishing to deceive himself or what is great by making it a trifle, a childhood disease one may wish to get over as soon as possible. But life has its own tasks and its own comforts, and the highest of these is the task of faith.\nThe story of Abraham is the story of faith. He who left behind his earthly understanding, he who took the absurd upon his shoulders, he who would sacrifice the very thing he loved most\u2014Isaac\u2014because God commanded it. This is not ethics; ethics would say \"Do not kill your son.\" This is the teleological suspension of the ethical. Abraham believes by virtue of the absurd; for all human calculation ceased long ago.\nIf faith is merely a provisional stage, then Abraham is lost. But if faith is the paradox that the single individual is higher than the universal, then Abraham is the Knight of Faith. He is not a tragic hero; the tragic hero stays within the ethical. Abraham oversteps it. And in that step, in that trembling moment on Mount Moriah, he finds the only ground that can hold him: God.", "source": "fear_and_trembling.txt"}
{"text": "Diapsalmata\nWhat is a poet? An unhappy man who in his heart harbors a deep anguish, but whose lips are so fashioned that the sighs and cries which pass over them are transformed into ravishing music. His fate is like that of the unfortunate victims whom the tyrant Phalaris imprisoned in a brazen bull, and slowly tortured over a steady fire; their cries could not reach the tyrant\u2019s ears so as to strike terror into his heart; when they reached him they sounded like sweet music. And men crowd about the poet and say to him, \u201cSing for us soon again\u201d\u2014which is as much as to say, \u201cMay new sufferings torment your soul, but may your lips be fashioned as before; for the cries would only distress us, but the music is delicious.\u201d\nI divide my time as follows: half the time I sleep, the other half I dream. I never dream when I sleep, for that would be a pity, for sleeping is the highest genius.\nMy life is like an eternal night...\nI have the courage, I believe, to doubt everything; I have the courage, I believe, to fight with everything; but I have not the courage to know anything, not the courage to possess, to own anything. Most people complain that the world is so prosaic, that life is not like a romance, where opportunities are always so favorable. I complain that life is not like a romance, where one has hard-hearted parents and nixies and trolls to fight, and enchanted princesses to free. What are all such enemies taken together compared with the pale, bloodless, tenacious, nocturnal shapes with which I fight and to which I myself give life and being?\nLet others complain that the age is wicked; my complaint is that it is paltry; for it lacks passion. Men\u2019s thoughts are thin and flimsy like lace, they are themselves pitiable like the lacemakers. The thoughts of their hearts are too paltry to be sinful. For a worm it might be regarded as a sin to harbor such thoughts, but not for a being made in the image of God. Their lusts are dull and sluggish, their passions sleepy. They do their duty, these shopkeeper souls, but they permit themselves, like the Jews, a little clipping of the coin...", "source": "either_or.txt"}
