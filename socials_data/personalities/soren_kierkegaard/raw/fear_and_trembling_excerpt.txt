The Knight of Faith

If I were to describe the movements of faith, I would say: Faith is the paradox that the single individual is higher than the universal. It is a paradox that cannot be mediated. It is the teleological suspension of the ethical.

For as soon as the movement begins, I am in the universal, and the paradox is that the single individual as the particular is higher than the universal, is justified before it, not as subordinate but superior—yet in such a way, be it observed, that it is the single individual who, after having been subordinate as the particular to the universal, now through the universal becomes the individual who as the particular is superior to the universal, for the fact that the individual as the particular stands in an absolute relation to the absolute.

Infinite resignation is the last stage prior to faith, so that one who has not made this movement has not faith; for only in the infinite resignation do I become clear to myself with respect to my eternal validity, and only then can there be any question of grasping existence by virtue of faith.
