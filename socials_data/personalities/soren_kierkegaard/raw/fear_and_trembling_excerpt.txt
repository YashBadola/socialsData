If there were no eternal consciousness in a man, if at the bottom of everything there were only a wild ferment, a power that twisting in dark passions produced everything great or inconsequential; if an unfathomable, insatiable emptiness lay hid beneath everything, what then would life be but despair? If it were thus, if there were no sacred bond uniting mankind, if one generation rose up after another like the leaves of the forest, if one generation succeeded the other as the songs of birds in the woods, if the human race passed through the world as a ship through the sea or the wind through the desert, a thoughtless and fruitless whim, if an eternal oblivion always lurked hungrily for its prey and there was no power strong enough to wrest it from its clutches—how empty and devoid of comfort would life be! But for that reason it is not so, and as God created man and woman, so too He fashioned the hero and the poet or orator. The poet cannot do what the other does, he can only admire, love and rejoice in the hero. Yet he too is happy, and not less so, for the hero is as it were his better nature, with which he is in love, and yet he is not the hero, and therefore his love can be admiration. The poet is the genius of recollection, can do nothing but call to mind what has been done, can do nothing but admire what has been done; he contributes nothing of his own, but is jealous of the entrusted treasure. He follows the choice of his heart, but when he has found what he sought, he wanders before every man’s door with his song and with his speech, that all may admire the hero as he does, be proud of the hero as he is. This is his achievement, his humble work, this is his faithful service in the house of the hero. If he thus remains true to his love, he strives day and night against the cunning of oblivion, which would trick him out of his hero, then he has completed his work, then he is gathered to the hero, who has loved him as faithfully, for the poet is as it were the hero’s better nature, powerless it is true as a memory is, but also transfigured as a memory is. Therefore shall no one who was great be forgotten, and whoever was great shall be remembered, but everyone became great in proportion to his expectation. One became great by expecting the possible, another by expecting the eternal, but he who expected the impossible became greatest of all. Everyone shall be remembered, but each became great in proportion to the greatness of that with which he strove. For he who strove with the world became great by overcoming the world, and he who strove with himself became great by overcoming himself, but he who strove with God became greatest of all. So there was strife in the world, man against man, one against a thousand, but he who strove with God was greatest of all. There was strife on earth, and there was one who overcame all by his power, and there was one who overcame God by his powerlessness. There was one who relied upon himself and gained all, there was one who secure in his strength sacrificed all, but he who believed in God was greatest of all. There was one who was great by reason of his power, and one who was great by reason of his wisdom, and one who was great by reason of his hope, and one who was great by reason of his love; but Abraham was greater than all, great by reason of his power whose strength is impotence, great by reason of his wisdom whose secret is foolishness, great by reason of his hope whose form is madness, great by reason of his love which is hatred of oneself.
By faith Abraham went out from the land of his fathers and became a sojourner in the land of promise. He left one thing behind, took one thing with him. He left his earthly understanding behind and took faith with him—otherwise he would not have wandered forth but would have thought this unreasonable. By faith he was a stranger in the land of promise, and there was nothing to recall what was dear to him, but by its novelty everything tempted his soul to melancholy yearning—and yet he was God’s elect, in whom the Lord was well pleased! Indeed, if he had been estranged from the world, so that the life we live had been for him a world of sorrow, and the other life a world of hope, he would not have been the one he was. But this was not the case, he was not of that sort. The promise was made to him that in his seed all the nations of the earth should be blessed, it was to him, the aging man, that it was made, and yet he was God’s elect, in whom the Lord was well pleased! He had to wait for the fulfillment, wait as the time passed, wait as the shadow of the evening lengthened, wait as the hair turned white, wait as the grave beckoned, wait as the hope became more and more unreasonable, and yet he was God’s elect, in whom the Lord was well pleased!
