The ethical expression for what Abraham did is that he would murder Isaac; the religious expression is that he would sacrifice Isaac--but in this contradiction lies the very anguish that can indeed make a sleeplessness and yet without which Abraham is not who he is.

Faith is precisely this paradox, that the single individual is higher than the universal, though in such a way, be it noted, that the movement repeats itself, so that after having been in the universal he as the single individual isolates himself as higher than the universal. If this is not faith, then Abraham is lost, then faith has never existed in the world...

For faith is a passion, and although I am not capable of making the movement of faith, I do not therefore deny that it is a movement. But if it is so, then it is also the highest passion of all, and it must be very comical that in our age, where not only everyone has faith but also where everyone goes further, that one should speak of it so easily.
