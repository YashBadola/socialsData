LETTER I. ON THE QUAKERS

I was of opinion that the doctrine and history of so extraordinary a people were worthy the attention of the curious. To acquaint myself with them I made a visit to one of the most eminent Quakers in England, who, after having traded thirty years, had the wisdom to prescribe limits to his fortune and to his desires, and was settled in a little solitude not far from London. Being come to him, I perceived that his house was small, but built with great neatness, without the least ornament. The Quaker was a fresh-looking old man, who had never been visited by sickness, because he had never given way to the irregular passions nor to intemperance. I never in my life saw a more noble or a more engaging aspect than his. He was dressed like those of his persuasion, in a plain coat without pleats in the sides, or buttons on the pockets and sleeves; and had on a beaver, the brims of which were horizontal like those of our clergy. He did not uncover himself when I appeared, and advanced toward me without once stooping his body; but there appeared more politeness in the open, humane air of his countenance, than in the custom of drawing one leg behind the other, and carrying that in the hand which is made to cover the head. "Friend," said he to me, "I perceive thou art a stranger, but if I can do anything for thee, only tell me." "Sir," said I to him, bending forward and advancing, as is our custom, one leg toward him, "I flatter myself that my just curiosity will not give you any offense, and that you'll do me the honor to inform me of the particulars of your religion." "The people of thy country," replied the Quaker, "are too full of their bows and compliments, but I never yet met with one of them who had so much curiosity. Come in, and let us first dine together." I still continued to make some very unseasonable ceremonies, it not being easy to disengage one's self at once from habits we have been long used to; and after taking part in a frugal meal, which began and ended with a prayer to God, I began to question my plain host.

LETTER VIII. ON THE PARLIAMENT

The Members of the English Parliament are fond of comparing themselves to the old Romans.

Not long since Mr. Shippen opened a speech in the House of Commons with these words, "The majesty of the people of England would be wounded." The singularity of the expression caused a loud laugh; but this gentleman, so far from being disconcerted, repeated the same words with a resolute tone of voice, and the laugh ceased. In my opinion, the Majesty of the people of England has nothing in common with that of the people of Rome, much less is there any affinity between their governments. There is in London a senate and a mob, but the senate is not invested with that absolute authority which was a weight on the executive power of Rome, and as to the mob, it is not quite so rebellious as that of Rome. Besides, the Romans have never known the terrible madness of religious wars. That abomination was reserved for devout preachers of humility and patience. Marius and Sylla, Cæsar and Pompey, Anthony and Augustus, did not draw their swords and set the world in a blaze merely to determine whether the flamen should wear his shirt over his robe, or his robe over his shirt, or whether the sacred chickens should eat and drink, or eat only, in order to take the augury. The English have hanged one another by law, and cut one another to pieces in pitched battles, for quarrels of as trifling a nature. The sects of the Episcopalians and Presbyterians quite turned the heads of these serious people for a time. But I fancy they’ll hardly ever be so silly again, they seem to be grown wiser at their own expense; and I don’t perceive the least inclination in them to murder one another merely about syllogisms, as some zealots among them once did.
