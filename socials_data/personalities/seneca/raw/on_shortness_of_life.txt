DE BREVITATE VITAE
(On the Shortness of Life)

Chapter 1
Most of mankind, Paulinus, complains about nature's meanness, because our allotted span of life is so short, and because this stretch of time that is given to us runs its course so quickly, so rapidly—so much so that, with few exceptions, life leaves the rest of us in the lurch just as we're getting ready to live. And it's not just the masses and the unthinking crowd that complain about this perceived evil; the same feeling has drawn complaints from famous men, too. Hence the dictum of the greatest of doctors: "Life is short, art is long." Hence too the grievance—most unbecoming to a wise man—which Aristotle expressed when he took nature to task for granting animals such long existences (some of them living through five or ten human lifetimes) while a much shorter limit is set for man, born to achieve so many and such great things.

It is not that we have a short time to live, but that we waste a lot of it. Life is long enough, and a sufficiently generous amount has been given to us for the highest achievements if it were all well invested. But when it is wasted in heedless luxury and spent on no good activity, we are forced at last by death's final constraint to realize that it has passed away before we knew it was passing. So it is: we are not given a short life but we make it short, and we are not ill-supplied but wasteful of it. Just as when ample and princely wealth falls to a bad owner it is squandered in a moment, but wealth however modest, if entrusted to a good custodian, increases with use, so our lifetime extends for a lot if you manage it well.

Chapter 2
Why do we complain of nature? She has shown herself kindly; life, if you know how to use it, is long. But one man is gripped by insatiable greed, another by a laborious dedication to useless tasks. One man is soaked in wine, another sluggish with idleness. One man is worn out by political ambition, which is always at the mercy of the judgment of others. Another through hope of profit is driven headlong over all lands and seas by the greed of trading. Some are tormented by a passion for the camp, always intent on other people's dangers or anxious about their own. Some are worn out by the voluntary servitude of thankless attendance on the great. Many are kept busy either in the pursuit of other men's fortune or in complaining about their own. Many following no fixed aim, shifting and inconstant and dissatisfied, are plunged by their fickleness into plans that are ever new. Some have no fixed principle by which to direct their course, but Fate takes them by surprise while they are lolling and yawning—so surely does it happen that I cannot doubt the truth of that which the greatest of poets said in the form of an oracle: "The part of life we really live is small." For all the rest of existence is not life, but merely time.
