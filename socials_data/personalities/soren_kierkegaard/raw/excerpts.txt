From "Fear and Trembling":

The Knight of Faith is the only happy man, the heir apparent to the finite, while the Knight of Resignation is a stranger and a sojourner. But this Knight of Faith... I have never found him. If I were to find him, I would be astounded. The moment I set eyes on him I would push him away and leap back, clapping my hands and saying half aloud, "Good Lord, is this the man? Is it really he? Why, he looks like a tax-collector!" However, it is indeed he. I draw closer to him, watching his least movement to see whether there is not some incongruous telegraphic message from the infinite, a glance, a look, a gesture, a note of sadness, a smile, which betrays the infinite in its heterogeneity with the finite. No! I examine his figure from tip to toe to see if there might not be a cranny through which the infinite was peeping. No! He is solid through and through. His tread? It is vigorous, belonging entirely to finiteness; no smartly dressed townsman who walks out to Fresberg on a Sunday afternoon treads the ground more firmly, he belongs entirely to the world, no Philistine more so.

Faith is precisely this paradox, that the single individual is higher than the universal. If this is not faith, then Abraham is lost, then faith has never existed in the world... because it has always existed. For if the ethical (i.e., the moral) is the highest thing, and if nothing incommensurable remains in man in any other way but as the evil (i.e., the particular which has to be expressed in the universal), then one needs no other categories than those which the Greek philosophers possessed or which can be deduced from them by logic. But the paradox of faith is this: that there is an interiority which is incommensurable for the exteriority, an interiority which is not identical with the first, but is a new interiority. This must not be overlooked.

From "The Sickness Unto Death":

Man is spirit. But what is spirit? Spirit is the self. But what is the self? The self is a relation which relates itself to its own self, or it is that in the relation [which accounts for it] that the relation relates itself to its own self; the self is not the relation but [consists in the fact] that the relation relates itself to its own self. Man is a synthesis of the infinite and the finite, of the temporal and the eternal, of freedom and necessity, in short it is a synthesis. A synthesis is a relation between two factors. So regarded, man is not yet a self.

In the relation between two, the relation is the third term as a negative unity, and the two relate themselves to the relation, and in the relation to the relation; such a relation is that between soul and body, when man is regarded as soul. If on the contrary the relation relates itself to its own self, the then this relation is the positive third term, and this is the self.

Despair is the sickness unto death. The concept of this sickness is: the sickness is the self. And as "sickness" is not the self, but the self is the sickness, so it is the sickness of the self to be the self. And this is despair.

From "Either/Or":

What I really lack is to be clear in my mind what I am to do, not what I am to know, except in so far as a certain understanding must precede every action. The thing is to understand myself, to see what God really wishes me to do; the thing is to find a truth which is true for me, to find the idea for which I can live and die. What good would it do me if truth stood before me, cold and naked, not caring whether I recognised her or not, and producing in me a shudder of fear rather than a trusting devotion? I certainly do not deny that I still recognize an imperative of understanding and that through it one can work upon men, but it must be taken up into my life, and that is what I now recognize as the most important thing.

I feel as if I were a piece in a game of chess, when my opponent says of it: That piece cannot be moved.
