The self is a relation that relates itself to itself or is the relation's relating itself to itself in the relation; the self is not the relation but that the relation relates itself to itself. Man is a synthesis of the infinite and the finite, of the temporal and the eternal, of freedom and necessity, in short, a synthesis. A synthesis is a relation between two. Considered in this way, man is not yet a self.

Despair is the sickness unto death. It is not that one dies of it, but that one cannot die. It is the hopelessness of not even being able to die. The torment of despair is precisely this: not to be able to die. To be sick unto death is to be unable to die, but not as if there were hope of life; no, the hopelessness is that there is not even the ultimate hope, death. When death is the greatest danger, one hopes for life; but when one gets to know the even more dreadful danger, one hopes for death. When the danger is so great that death has become one's hope, despair is the hopelessness of not being able to die.
