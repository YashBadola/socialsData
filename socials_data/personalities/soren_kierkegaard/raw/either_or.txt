Marry, and you will regret it. Do not marry, and you will also regret it. Marry or do not marry, you will regret it either way. Whether you marry or you do not marry, you will regret it either way. Laugh at the world’s follies, you will regret it; weep over them, you will also regret it. Laugh at the world’s follies or weep over them, you will regret it either way. Whether you laugh at the world’s follies or weep over them, you will regret it either way. Believe a woman, you will regret it, believe her not, you will also regret it. Believe a woman or believe her not, you will regret it either way. Whether you believe a woman or believe her not, you will regret it either way. Hang yourself, you will regret it; do not hang yourself, and you will also regret it. Hang yourself or do not hang yourself, you will regret it either way. Whether you hang yourself or do not hang yourself, you will regret it either way. This, gentlemen, is the quintessence of all the wisdom of life.
