ON ANGER (DE IRA) - EXCERPTS

We must prevent anger from coming to the fore; for if it once begins to lead the charge, it is hard to retreat. Reason is strong only so long as it stands aloof from the passions; if it once mixes with them, it is polluted and unable to hold back what it might have cleared away. For when the mind has once been shaken and thrown off its balance, it becomes the slave of the impulse which urges it on. Certain things, at the start, are in our own power, but later on they drag us by their own force and allow us no retreat. Thus a man running down a steep slope cannot stop just where he wishes, but the weight of his body and the irreversible nature of his course carry him further than he intended.

The best plan is to reject straightway the first incentives to anger, to resist its very beginnings, and to take care not to be betrayed into it: for if once it begins to carry us away, it is hard to get back again into a healthy condition, because reason goes for nothing when once passion has been admitted to the mind, and has by our own free will been given a certain authority, it will for the future do as much as it chooses, not only as much as you will allow it. The enemy, I repeat, must be met and driven back at the outermost frontier-line: for when he has once entered the city and passed its gates, he will not allow his prisoners to set bounds to his victory.

Let us then consider how we may avoid falling into anger, or how we may free ourselves from it. And the first thing is not to be angry at all; the second, to cease from being angry.

Some may think that anger is necessary for the punishment of crimes and the defense of the state. But virtue does not need the help of vice. Reason is sufficient for all the needs of life. When reason punishes, it does so not because it delights in punishment, but because it is necessary. It looks to the future, not to the past. It does not punish because a crime has been committed, but in order that crimes may not be committed. It is not angry, but it is firm.

If you wish to correct a man who is doing wrong, you must be calm yourself. For if you are angry, you are doing wrong yourself. How can you correct another when you yourself need correction? The physician does not get angry with his patient, but tries to cure him. We should look upon sinners as sick men who need to be cured.

We are all bad men living among bad men; and only one thing can calm us—we must agree to go easy with one another.
