The sickness unto death is despair.

Despair is the sickness, not the cure. It is the disrelationship in a relation that relates itself to itself.

There are three forms of despair:
1. Not being conscious of having a self (not despair in the strict sense).
2. Not wanting to be oneself.
3. Wanting to be oneself.

The formula for all despair is this: to despair over oneself, in despair to will to be rid of oneself.

To be a self is the greatest concession made to man, but at the same time it is eternity's demand upon him.
