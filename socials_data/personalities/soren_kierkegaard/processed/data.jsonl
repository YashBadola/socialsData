{"text": "Preface\n\nNot only in the world of commerce but also in the world of ideas our age is putting on a veritable clearance sale. Everything can be had so dirt cheap that one begins to wonder whether in the end anyone will want to make a bid. Every speculative price-fixer who conscientiously directs attention to the significant march of modern philosophy, every Privatdocent, tutor, and student, every crofter and cottager in philosophy, is not content with doubting everything but goes further. Perhaps it would be untimely and ill-timed to ask them where they are going, but surely it is courteous and assumes no responsibility to take it for granted that they have doubted everything, since otherwise it would be queer indeed for them to be going further. Having performed this preliminary movement, they have all of them likely enough made the discovery that this did not require so much after all, and so they do not think it is worth the trouble to tell a lie about it; they are not like the man who \"made the movement\" with a single leg, for they have no doubt made it with both.\n\nI. A Panegyric upon Abraham\n\nIf there were no eternal consciousness in a man, if at the foundation of all there lay only a wildly seething power which writhing with obscure passions produced everything that is great and everything that is insignificant, if a bottomless void never satiated lay hidden beneath all--what then would life be but despair? If it were thus, if there were no sacred bond which united mankind, if one generation arose after another like the leafage of a little forest, if the one generation replaced the other like the song of birds in the forest, if the human race passed through the world as the ship goes through the sea, like the wind through the desert, a thoughtless and fruitless activity, if an eternal oblivion were always lurking hungrily for its prey and there were no power strong enough to wrest it from its maw--how empty then and comfortless life would be! But therefore it is not thus, but as God created man and woman, so too He fashioned the hero and the poet or orator. The poet cannot do what the hero does, but he can admire him and love him and rejoice in the hero.\n\n...\n\nFaith is precisely this paradox, that the single individual is higher than the universal, yet in such a way, be it observed, that the movement repeats itself, and that consequently the individual, after having been in the universal, now as the single individual isolates himself as higher than the universal. If this be not faith, then Abraham is lost, then faith has never existed in the world... because it has always existed. For if the ethical (i.e., the moral) is the highest thing, and if nothing incommensurable remains in man in any other way but as the evil (i.e., the particular which has to be expressed in the universal), then one needs no other categories than those which the Greek philosophy possessed or which can be deduced from them by the most consistent thought. This is the truth which Hegel respects. But faith begins precisely there where thinking leaves off.", "source": "fear_and_trembling_excerpt.txt"}
{"text": "The Sickness Unto Death\n\nA Christian Psychological Exposition for Upbuilding and Awakening\nby Anti-Climacus\n\nIntroduction\n\nMan is spirit. But what is spirit? Spirit is the self. But what is the self? The self is a relation which relates itself to its own self, or it is that in the relation [which accounts for it] that the relation relates itself to its own self; the self is not the relation but [consists in the fact] that the relation relates itself to its own self. Man is a synthesis of the infinite and the finite, of the temporal and the eternal, of freedom and necessity, in short it is a synthesis. A synthesis is a relation between two factors. So regarded, man is not yet a self.\n\nIn the relation between two, the relation is the third term as a negative unity, and the two relate themselves to the relation, and in the relation to the relation; such a relation is that between soul and body, when man is regarded as soul. But if the relation relates itself to its own self, the relation is then the positive third term, and this is the self.\n\nSuch a relation which relates itself to its own self (that is to say, a self) must either have constituted itself or have been constituted by another.\n\nIf this relation which relates itself to its own self is constituted by another, the relation doubtless is the third term, but this relation (the third term) is in turn a relation relating itself to that which constituted the whole relation.\n\nSuch a derived, constituted, relation is the human self, a relation which relates itself to its own self, and in relating itself to its own self relates itself to another. Hence it is that there can be two forms of despair properly so called. If the human self had constituted itself, there could be only one form: not to will to be oneself, to will to get rid of oneself, but there could be no question of despairing over willing to be oneself. This formula [i.e. that the self is constituted by another] is the expression for the total dependence of the relation (the self), the expression for the fact that the self cannot of itself attain and remain in equilibrium and rest by its own self, but only by relating itself to that Power which constituted it. This relation to that Power is faith.\n\n...\n\nDespair is the sickness unto death. The torment of despair is precisely this, not to be able to die. So it has much in common with the situation of the moribund when he lies and struggles with death, and cannot die. Thus to be sick unto death is, not to be able to die\u2014yet not as though there were hope of life. No, the hopelessness in this case is that even the last hope, death, is not available. When death is the greatest danger, one hopes for life; but when one becomes acquainted with an even more dreadful danger, one hopes for death. So when the danger is so great that death has become one\u2019s hope, despair is the disconsolateness of not being able to die.", "source": "sickness_unto_death_excerpt.txt"}
