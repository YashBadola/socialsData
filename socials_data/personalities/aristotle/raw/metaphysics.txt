All men by nature desire to know. An indication of this is the delight we take in our senses; for even apart from their usefulness they are loved for themselves; and above all others the sense of sight. For not only with a view to action, but even when we are not going to do anything, we prefer seeing (one might say) to everything else. The reason is that this, most of all the senses, makes us know and brings to light many differences between things.
It is clear that we must obtain knowledge of the primary causes, because it is when we think that we understand its primary cause that we think we know each thing. Now causes are spoken of in four ways. In one way we say that the substance or the essence is a cause (for the "why" leads us back ultimately to the definition, and the first "why" is a cause and principle); in another, the matter or the subject; in a third, the source of the change; and in a fourth, the cause opposite to this, the purpose and the good (for this is the end of all generation and change).
