Preface
Not only in the world of commerce but also in the world of ideas our age is putting on a veritable clearance sale. Everything can be had so dirt cheap that one begins to wonder whether in the end anyone will want to make a bid. Every speculative price-fixer who conscientiously directs the attention of the significant moments of modern philosophy to the stock market, every speculative freelance who in the interest of science, to be sure, but also on his own behalf, is always ready to sell out—they all are so zealous to harvest the demands of the times for a clearance sale of everything even before they are made that it almost seems as if they feared that the demands would not be made, something that would indeed be a great distress, for what, then, would they have to dispose of?

...

Faith is precisely this paradox, that the single individual as the single individual is higher than the universal, is justified before it, not as inferior to it but as superior—yet in such a way, please note, that it is the single individual who, after having been subordinate as the single individual to the universal, now by means of the universal becomes the single individual who as the single individual is superior, that the single individual as the single individual stands in an absolute relation to the absolute. This position cannot be mediated, for all mediation comes about precisely by virtue of the universal; it is and remains to all eternity a paradox, inaccessible to thought. And yet faith is this paradox—or else (these are the logical deductions which I would beg the reader to have in mente at every point, though it would be too prolix for me to reiterate them on every occasion)—or else there is no faith, precisely because there is no such thing as faith, and Abraham is lost, and the whole of existence is a trial and a tribulation.

If this is the case, then the ethical is the highest and nothing more can be said, for then the ethical is the divine and the divine is the ethical. Then there is no teleological suspension of the ethical, for the ethical is the telos for everything, and there is nothing outside it.

But if the ethical (i.e., the universal) is the highest, and if there is nothing incommensurable in man, then the individual is morally and religiously justified only by being the universal, and he is a sinner only by asserting himself as the particular over against the universal.
