Beshrew me if I think anything more requisite than silence for a man who secludes himself in order to study! Imagine what a variety of noises reverberates about my ears! I have lodgings right over a bathing establishment. So picture to yourself the assortment of sounds, which are strong enough to make me hate my very powers of hearing! When your strenuous gentleman, for example, is exercising himself by flourishing leaden weights; when he is working hard, or else pretends to be working hard, I can hear him grunt; and whenever he releases his imprisoned breath, I can hear him panting in wheezy and high-pitched tones. Or perhaps I notice some lazy fellow, content with a cheap rubdown, and hear the crack of the pummelling hand on his shoulder, varying in sound according as the hand is laid on flat or hollow. Then, perhaps, a leech comes along and shouts for the cook, or a sausage-dealer, or a confectioner, or all the vendors of food hawking their wares, each with his own distinctive intonation.
"But," you say, "the mere click of a voice which is characteristic of the place does not distract me anymore than the sound of the waves or the falling water." I will tell you, however, that there is this difference: the one noise is intermittent, the other is continuous. The one startles me, the other soothes me. For I have forced my mind to concentrate, and keep it from straying to outside things; all outdoors may be bedlam, provided that there is no disturbance within, provided that fear is not wrangling with desire in my breast, provided that meanness and luxury are not at odds, one harassing the other. For of what benefit is the quiet of the whole neighbourhood, if our emotions are in an uproar?
