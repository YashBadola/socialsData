The Knight of Faith is the only happy man, the heir to the finite, while the Knight of Resignation is a stranger and a sojourner. But if I knew where to find such a knight of faith, I would travel on foot to him, for this marvel interests me absolutely. I would not let him go for a moment, I would watch how he managed to make the movements, I would regard myself as sustained by him, and I would divide my time between looking at him and practicing the exercises myself, and thus I would spend all my time admiring him.

Faith is precisely this paradox, that the single individual is higher than the universal. It is the paradox that the single individual as the single individual determines his relation to the universal by his relation to the absolute, not his relation to the absolute by his relation to the universal. The paradox may also be expressed in this way: that there is an absolute duty toward God; for in this relationship of duty the individual as an individual stands related absolutely to the absolute.
