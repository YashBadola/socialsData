Fame\nINTRODUCTION.\nIn these pages I shall speak of _The Wisdom of Life_ in the common\nmeaning of the term, as the art, namely, of ordering our lives so as\nto obtain the greatest possible amount of pleasure and success; an art\nthe theory of which may be called _Eudaemonology_, for it teaches us\nhow to lead a happy existence. Such an existence might perhaps be\ndefined as one which, looked at from a purely objective point of\nview, or, rather, after cool and mature reflection--for the question\nnecessarily involves subjective considerations,--would be decidedly\npreferable to non-existence; implying that we should cling to it for\nits own sake, and not merely from the fear of death; and further, that\nwe should never like it to come to an end.\nNow whether human life corresponds, or could possibly correspond,\nto this conception of existence, is a question to which, as is\nwell-known, my philosophical system returns a negative answer. On the\neudaemonistic hypothesis, however, the question must be answered in\nthe affirmative; and I have shown, in the second volume of my chief\nwork (ch. 49), that this hypothesis is based upon a fundamental\nmistake. Accordingly, in elaborating the scheme of a happy existence,\nI have had to make a complete surrender of the higher metaphysical and\nethical standpoint to which my own theories lead; and everything I\nshall say here will to some extent rest upon a compromise; in so far,\nthat is, as I take the common standpoint of every day, and embrace\nthe error which is at the bottom of it. My remarks, therefore, will\npossess only a qualified value, for the very word _eudaemonology_ is a\neuphemism. Further, I make no claims to completeness; partly because\nthe subject is inexhaustible, and partly because I should otherwise\nhave to say over again what has been already said by others.\nThe only book composed, as far as I remember, with a like purpose to\nthat which animates this collection of aphorisms, is Cardan's _De\nutilitate ex adversis capienda_, which is well worth reading, and may\nbe used to supplement the present work. Aristotle, it is true, has a\nfew words on eudaemonology in the fifth chapter of the first book\nof his _Rhetoric_; but what he says does not come to very much.\nAs compilation is not my business, I have made no use of these\npredecessors; more especially because in the process of compiling,\nindividuality of view is lost, and individuality of view is the kernel\nof works of this kind. In general, indeed, the wise in all ages have\nalways said the same thing, and the fools, who at all times form the\nimmense majority, have in their way too acted alike, and done just the\nopposite; and so it will continue. For, as Voltaire says, _we shall\nleave this world as foolish and as wicked as we found it on our\narrival_.\nTHE WISDOM OF LIFE.\nCHAPTER I.\nDIVISION OF THE SUBJECT.\nAristotle[1] divides the blessings of life into three classes--those\nwhich come to us from without, those of the soul, and those of the\nbody. Keeping nothing of this division but the number, I observe that\nthe fundamental differences in human lot may be reduced to three\ndistinct classes:\n[Footnote 1: _Eth. Nichom_., I. 8.]\n(1) What a man is: that is to say, personality, in the widest sense\nof the word; under which are included health, strength, beauty,\ntemperament, moral character, intelligence, and education.\n(2) What a man has: that is, property and possessions of every kind.\n(3) How a man stands in the estimation of others: by which is to be\nunderstood, as everybody knows, what a man is in the eyes of his\nfellowmen, or, more strictly, the light in which they regard him. This\nis shown by their opinion of him; and their opinion is in its turn\nmanifested by the honor in which he is held, and by his rank and\nreputation.\nThe differences which come under the first head are those which Nature\nherself has set between man and man; and from this fact alone we may\nat once infer that they influence the happiness or unhappiness of\nmankind in a much more vital and radical way than those contained\nunder the two following heads, which are merely the effect of human\narrangements. Compared with _genuine personal advantages_, such as a\ngreat mind or a great heart, all the privileges of rank or birth, even\nof royal birth, are but as kings on the stage, to kings in real life.\nThe same thing was said long ago by Metrodorus, the earliest disciple\nof Epicurus, who wrote as the title of one of his chapters, _The\nhappiness we receive from ourselves is greater than that which we\nobtain from our surroundings_[1] And it is an obvious fact, which\ncannot be called in question, that the principal element in a man's\nwell-being,--indeed, in the whole tenor of his existence,--is what he\nis made of, his inner constitution. For this is the immediate source\nof that inward satisfaction or dissatisfaction resulting from the\nsum total of his sensations, desires and thoughts; whilst his\nsurroundings, on the other hand, exert only a mediate or indirect\ninfluence upon him. This is why the same external events or\ncircumstances affect no two people alike; even with perfectly similar\nsurroundings every one lives in a world of his own. For a man has\nimmediate apprehension only of his own ideas, feelings and volitions;\nthe outer world can influence him only in so far as it brings these to\nlife. The world in which a man lives shapes itself chiefly by the way\nin which he looks at it, and so it proves different to different\nmen; to one it is barren, dull, and superficial; to another rich,\ninteresting, and full of meaning. On hearing of the interesting events\nwhich have happened in the course of a man's experience, many people\nwill wish that similar things had happened in their lives too,\ncompletely forgetting that they should be envious rather of the mental\naptitude which lent those events the significance they possess when he\ndescribes them; to a man of genius they were interesting adventures;\nbut to the dull perceptions of an ordinary individual they would have\nbeen stale, everyday occurrences. This is in the highest degree the\ncase with many of Goethe's and Byron's poems, which are obviously\nfounded upon actual facts; where it is open to a foolish reader to\nenvy the poet because so many delightful things happened to him,\ninstead of envying that mighty power of phantasy which was capable\nof turning a fairly common experience into something so great and\nbeautiful.\n[Footnote 1: Cf. Clemens Alex. Strom. II., 21.]\nIn the same way, a person of melancholy temperament will make a scene\nin a tragedy out of what appears to the sanguine man only in the light\nof an interesting conflict, and to a phlegmatic soul as something\nwithout any meaning;--all of which rests upon the fact that every\nevent, in order to be realized and appreciated, requires the\nco-operation of two factors, namely, a subject and an object, although\nthese are as closely and necessarily connected as oxygen and hydrogen\nin water. When therefore the objective or external factor in an\nexperience is actually the same, but the subjective or personal\nappreciation of it varies, the event is just as much a different one\nin the eyes of different persons as if the objective factors had not\nbeen alike; for to a blunt intelligence the fairest and best object in\nthe world presents only a poor reality, and is therefore only poorly\nappreciated,--like a fine landscape in dull weather, or in the\nreflection of a bad _camera obscura_. In plain language, every man\nis pent up within the limits of his own consciousness, and cannot\ndirectly get beyond those limits any more than he can get beyond his\nown skin; so external aid is not of much use to him. On the stage, one\nman is a prince, another a minister, a third a servant or a soldier or\na general, and so on,--mere external differences: the inner reality,\nthe kernel of all these appearances is the same--a poor player, with\nall the anxieties of his lot. In life it is just the same. Differences\nof rank and wealth give every man his part to play, but this by no\nmeans implies a difference of inward happiness and pleasure; here,\ntoo, there is the same being in all--a poor mortal, with his hardships\nand troubles. Though these may, indeed, in every case proceed from\ndissimilar causes, they are in their essential nature much the same in\nall their forms, with degrees of intensity which vary, no doubt, but\nin no wise correspond to the part a man has to play, to the presence\nor absence of position and wealth. Since everything which exists or\nhappens for a man exists only in his consciousness and happens for it\nalone, the most essential thing for a man is the constitution of this\nconsciousness, which is in most cases far more important than the\ncircumstances which go to form its contents. All the pride and\npleasure of the world, mirrored in the dull consciousness of a fool,\nare poor indeed compared with the imagination of Cervantes writing his\n_Don Quixote_ in a miserable prison. The objective half of life and\nreality is in the hand of fate, and accordingly takes various forms in\ndifferent cases: the subjective half is ourself, and in essentials is\nalways remains the same.\nHence the life of every man is stamped with the same character\nthroughout, however much his external circumstances may alter; it is\nlike a series of variations on a single theme. No one can get beyond\nhis own individuality. An animal, under whatever circumstances it\nis placed, remains within the narrow limits to which nature has\nirrevocably consigned it; so that our endeavors to make a pet happy\nmust always keep within the compass of its nature, and be restricted\nto what it can feel. So it is with man; the measure of the happiness\nhe can attain is determined beforehand by his individuality. More\nespecially is this the case with the mental powers, which fix once for\nall his capacity for the higher kinds of pleasure. If these powers are\nsmall, no efforts from without, nothing that his fellowmen or that\nfortune can do for him, will suffice to raise him above the ordinary\ndegree of human happiness and pleasure, half animal though it be; his\nonly resources are his sensual appetite,--a cozy and cheerful family\nlife at the most,--low company and vulgar pastime; even education, on\nthe whole, can avail little, if anything, for the enlargement of his\nhorizon. For the highest, most varied and lasting pleasures are those\nof the mind, however much our youth may deceive us on this point; and\nthe pleasures of the mind turn chiefly on the powers of the mind. It\nis clear, then, that our happiness depends in a great degree upon what\nwe _are_, upon our individuality, whilst lot or destiny is generally\ntaken to mean only what we _have_, or our _reputation_. Our lot,\nin this sense, may improve; but we do not ask much of it if we are\ninwardly rich: on the other hand, a fool remains a fool, a dull\nblockhead, to his last hour, even though he were surrounded by houris\nin paradise. This is why Goethe, in the _West-\u00f6stliclien Divan_, says\nthat every man, whether he occupies a low position in life, or emerges\nas its victor, testifies to personality as the greatest factor in\nhappiness:--\n_Volk und Knecht und Uberwinder\nSie gestehen, zu jeder Zeit,\nH\u00f6chtes Gl\u00fcck der Erdenkinder\nSei nur die Pers\u00f6nlichkeit_.\nEverything confirms the fact that the subjective element in life is\nincomparably more important for our happiness and pleasure than the\nobjective, from such sayings as _Hunger is the best sauce_, and _Youth\nand Age cannot live together_, up to the life of the Genius and the\nSaint. Health outweighs all other blessings so much that one may\nreally say that a healthy beggar is happier than an ailing king. A\nquiet and cheerful temperament, happy in the enjoyment of a perfectly\nsound physique, an intellect clear, lively, penetrating and seeing\nthings as they are, a moderate and gentle will, and therefore a good\nconscience--these are privileges which no rank or wealth can make up\nfor or replace. For what a man is in himself, what accompanies him\nwhen he is alone, what no one can give or take away, is obviously more\nessential to him than everything he has in the way of possessions, or\neven what he may be in the eyes of the world. An intellectual man in\ncomplete solitude has excellent entertainment in his own thoughts and\nfancies, while no amount of diversity or social pleasure, theatres,\nexcursions and amusements, can ward off boredom from a dullard. A\ngood, temperate, gentle character can be happy in needy circumstances,\nwhilst a covetous, envious and malicious man, even if he be the\nrichest in the world, goes miserable. Nay more; to one who has the\nconstant delight of a special individuality, with a high degree of\nintellect, most of the pleasures which are run after by mankind are\nsimply superfluous; they are even a trouble and a burden. And so\nHorace says of himself, that, however many are deprived of the\nfancy-goods of life, there is one at least who can live without\nthem:--\n_Gemmas, marmor, ebur, Tyrrhena sigilla, tabellas,\nArgentum, vestes, Gaetulo murice tinctas\nSunt qui non habeant, est qui non curat habere_;\nand when Socrates saw various articles of luxury spread out for sale,\nhe exclaimed: _How much there is in the world I do not want_.\nSo the first and most essential element in our life's happiness is\nwhat we are,--our personality, if for no other reason than that it is\na constant factor coming into play under all circumstances: besides,\nunlike the blessings which are described under the other two heads, it\nis not the sport of destiny and cannot be wrested from us;--and, so\nfar, it is endowed with an absolute value in contrast to the merely\nrelative worth of the other two. The consequence of this is that it is\nmuch more difficult than people commonly suppose to get a hold on a\nman from without. But here the all-powerful agent, Time, comes in\nand claims its rights, and before its influence physical and mental\nadvantages gradually waste away. Moral character alone remains\ninaccessible to it. In view of the destructive effect of time, it\nseems, indeed, as if the blessings named under the other two heads,\nof which time cannot directly rob us, were superior to those of the\nfirst. Another advantage might be claimed for them, namely, that being\nin their very nature objective and external, they are attainable, and\nevery one is presented with the possibility, at least, of coming into\npossession of them; whilst what is subjective is not open to us to\nacquire, but making its entry by a kind of _divine right_, it remains\nfor life, immutable, inalienable, an inexorable doom. Let me quote\nthose lines in which Goethe describes how an unalterable destiny is\nassigned to every man at the hour of his birth, so that he can develop\nonly in the lines laid down for him, as it were, by the conjunctions\nof the stars: and how the Sybil and the prophets declare that\n_himself_ a man can never escape, nor any power of time avail to\nchange the path on which his life is cast:--\n_Wie an dem Tag, der dich der Welt verliehen,\nD\u00efe Sonne stand zum Grusse der Planeten,\nBist alsobald und fort und fort gediehen,\nNach dem Gesetz, wonach du angetreten.\nSo musst du sein, dir kannst du nicht entfliehen,\nSo tagten schon Sybillen und Propheten;\nUnd keine Zeit, und keine Macht zerst\u00fcckelt\nGepr\u00e4gte Form, die lebend sich entwickelt_.\nThe only thing that stands in our power to achieve, is to make the\nmost advantageous use possible of the personal qualities we possess,\nand accordingly to follow such pursuits only as will call them into\nplay, to strive after the kind of perfection of which they admit and\nto avoid every other; consequently, to choose the position, occupation\nand manner of life which are most suitable for their development.\nImagine a man endowed with herculean strength who is compelled by\ncircumstances to follow a sedentary occupation, some minute exquisite\nwork of the hands, for example, or to engage in study and mental\nlabor demanding quite other powers, and just those which he has not\ngot,--compelled, that is, to leave unused the powers in which he is\npre-eminently strong; a man placed like this will never feel happy all\nhis life through. Even more miserable will be the lot of the man\nwith intellectual powers of a very high order, who has to leave them\nundeveloped and unemployed, in the pursuit of a calling which does not\nrequire them, some bodily labor, perhaps, for which his strength is\ninsufficient. Still, in a case of this kind, it should be our care,\nespecially in youth, to avoid the precipice of presumption, and not\nascribe to ourselves a superfluity of power which is not there.\nSince the blessings described under the first head decidedly outweigh\nthose contained under the other two, it is manifestly a wiser course\nto aim at the maintenance of our health and the cultivation of our\nfaculties, than at the amassing of wealth; but this must not be\nmistaken as meaning that we should neglect to acquire an adequate\nsupply of the necessaries of life. Wealth, in the strict sense of the\nword, that is, great superfluity, can do little for our happiness; and\nmany rich people feel unhappy just because they are without any true\nmental culture or knowledge, and consequently have no objective\ninterests which would qualify them for intellectual occupations. For\nbeyond the satisfaction of some real and natural necessities, all that\nthe possession of wealth can achieve has a very small influence upon\nour happiness, in the proper sense of the word; indeed, wealth rather\ndisturbs it, because the preservation of property entails a great many\nunavoidable anxieties. And still men are a thousand times more intent\non becoming rich than on acquiring culture, though it is quite certain\nthat what a man _is_ contributes much more to his happiness than\nwhat he _has_. So you may see many a man, as industrious as an ant,\nceaselessly occupied from morning to night in the endeavor to increase\nhis heap of gold. Beyond the narrow horizon of means to this end, he\nknows nothing; his mind is a blank, and consequently unsusceptible to\nany other influence. The highest pleasures, those of the intellect,\nare to him inaccessible, and he tries in vain to replace them by the\nfleeting pleasures of sense in which he indulges, lasting but a brief\nhour and at tremendous cost. And if he is lucky, his struggles result\nin his having a really great pile of gold, which he leaves to\nhis heir, either to make it still larger, or to squander it in\nextravagance. A life like this, though pursued with a sense of\nearnestness and an air of importance, is just as silly as many another\nwhich has a fool's cap for its symbol.\n_What a man has in himself_ is, then, the chief element in his\nhappiness. Because this is, as a rule, so very little, most of those\nwho are placed beyond the struggle with penury feel at bottom quite as\nunhappy as those who are still engaged in it. Their minds are vacant,\ntheir imagination dull, their spirits poor, and so they are driven to\nthe company of those like them--for _similis simili gaudet_--where\nthey make common pursuit of pastime and entertainment, consisting\nfor the most part in sensual pleasure, amusement of every kind, and\nfinally, in excess and libertinism. A young man of rich family enters\nupon life with a large patrimony, and often runs through it in an\nincredibly short space of time, in vicious extravagance; and why?\nSimply because, here too, the mind is empty and void, and so the man\nis bored with existence. He was sent forth into the world outwardly\nrich but inwardly poor, and his vain endeavor was to make his\nexternal wealth compensate for his inner poverty, by trying to obtain\neverything _from without_, like an old man who seeks to strengthen\nhimself as King David or Mar\u00e9chal de Rex tried to do. And so in the\nend one who is inwardly poor comes to be also poor outwardly.\nI need not insist upon the importance of the other two kinds of\nblessings which make up the happiness of human life; now-a-days the\nvalue of possessing them is too well known to require advertisement.\nThe third class, it is true, may seem, compared with the second, of\na very ethereal character, as it consists only of other people's\nopinions. Still every one has to strive for reputation, that is to\nsay, a good name. Rank, on the other hand, should be aspired to only\nby those who serve the state, and fame by very few indeed. In any\ncase, reputation is looked upon as a priceless treasure, and fame as\nthe most precious of all the blessings a man can attain,--the Golden\nFleece, as it were, of the elect: whilst only fools will prefer rank\nto property. The second and third classes, moreover, are reciprocally\ncause and effect; so far, that is, as Petronius' maxim, _habes\nhabeberis_, is true; and conversely, the favor of others, in all its\nforms, often puts us in the way of getting what we want.\nCHAPTER II.\nPERSONALITY, OR WHAT A MAN IS.\nWe have already seen, in general, that what a man _is_ contributes\nmuch more to his happiness than what he _has_, or how he is regarded\nby others. What a man is, and so what he has in his own person, is\nalways the chief thing to consider; for his individuality accompanies\nhim always and everywhere, and gives its color to all his experiences.\nIn every kind of enjoyment, for instance, the pleasure depends\nprincipally upon the man himself. Every one admits this in regard to\nphysical, and how much truer it is of intellectual, pleasure. When we\nuse that English expression, \"to enjoy one's self,\" we are employing a\nvery striking and appropriate phrase; for observe--one says, not \"he\nenjoys Paris,\" but \"he enjoys himself in Paris.\" To a man possessed of\nan ill-conditioned individuality, all pleasure is like delicate wine\nin a mouth made bitter with gall. Therefore, in the blessings as well\nas in the ills of life, less depends upon what befalls us than upon\nthe way in which it is met, that is, upon the kind and degree of our\ngeneral susceptibility. What a man is and has in himself,--in a word\npersonality, with all it entails, is the only immediate and direct\nfactor in his happiness and welfare. All else is mediate and indirect,\nand its influence can be neutralized and frustrated; but the influence\nof personality never. This is why the envy which personal qualities\nexcite is the most implacable of all,--as it is also the most\ncarefully dissembled.\nFurther, the constitution of our consciousness is the ever present\nand lasting element in all we do or suffer; our individuality is\npersistently at work, more or less, at every moment of our life: all\nother influences are temporal, incidental, fleeting, and subject to\nevery kind of chance and change. This is why Aristotle says: _It is\nnot wealth but character that lasts_.[1]\n[Greek: --hae gar phusis bebion ou ta chraemata]\n[Footnote 1: Eth. Eud., vii. 2. 37:]\nAnd just for the same reason we can more easily bear a misfortune\nwhich comes to us entirely from without, than one which we have drawn\nupon ourselves; for fortune may always change, but not character.\nTherefore, subjective blessings,--a noble nature, a capable head, a\njoyful temperament, bright spirits, a well-constituted, perfectly\nsound physique, in a word, _mens sana in corpore sano_, are the first\nand most important elements in happiness; so that we should be\nmore intent on promoting and preserving such qualities than on the\npossession of external wealth and external honor.\nAnd of all these, the one which makes us the most directly happy is\na genial flow of good spirits; for this excellent quality is its own\nimmediate reward. The man who is cheerful and merry has always a\ngood reason for being so,--the fact, namely, that he is so. There is\nnothing which, like this quality, can so completely replace the loss\nof every other blessing. If you know anyone who is young, handsome,\nrich and esteemed, and you want to know, further, if he is happy, ask,\nIs he cheerful and genial?--and if he is, what does it matter whether\nhe is young or old, straight or humpbacked, poor or rich?--he is\nhappy. In my early days I once opened an old book and found these\nwords: _If you laugh a great deal, you are happy; if you cry a great\ndeal, you are unhappy_;--a very simple remark, no doubt; but just\nbecause it is so simple I have never been able to forget it, even\nthough it is in the last degree a truism. So if cheerfulness knocks\nat our door, we should throw it wide open, for it never comes\ninopportunely; instead of that, we often make scruples about letting\nit in. We want to be quite sure that we have every reason to be\ncontented; then we are afraid that cheerfulness of spirits may\ninterfere with serious reflections or weighty cares. Cheerfulness is a\ndirect and immediate gain,--the very coin, as it were, of happiness,\nand not, like all else, merely a cheque upon the bank; for it alone\nmakes us immediately happy in the present moment, and that is the\nhighest blessing for beings like us, whose existence is but an\ninfinitesimal moment between two eternities. To secure and promote\nthis feeling of cheerfulness should be the supreme aim of all our\nendeavors after happiness.\nNow it is certain that nothing contributes so little to cheerfulness\nas riches, or so much, as health. Is it not in the lower classes, the\nso-called working classes, more especially those of them who live in\nthe country, that we see cheerful and contented faces? and is it\nnot amongst the rich, the upper classes, that we find faces full of\nill-humor and vexation? Consequently we should try as much as possible\nto maintain a high degree of health; for cheerfulness is the very\nflower of it. I need hardly say what one must do to be healthy--avoid\nevery kind of excess, all violent and unpleasant emotion, all mental\noverstrain, take daily exercise in the open air, cold baths and such\nlike hygienic measures. For without a proper amount of daily exercise\nno one can remain healthy; all the processes of life demand exercise\nfor the due performance of their functions, exercise not only of the\nparts more immediately concerned, but also of the whole body. For, as\nAristotle rightly says, _Life is movement_; it is its very essence.\nCeaseless and rapid motion goes on in every part of the organism.\nThe heart, with its complicated double systole and diastole, beats\nstrongly and untiringly; with twenty-eight beats it has to drive the\nwhole of the blood through arteries, veins and capillaries; the lungs\npump like a steam-engine, without intermission; the intestines are\nalways in peristaltic action; the glands are all constantly absorbing\nand secreting; even the brain has a double motion of its own, with\nevery beat of the pulse and every breath we draw. When people can get\nno exercise at all, as is the case with the countless numbers who\nare condemned to a sedentary life, there is a glaring and fatal\ndisproportion between outward inactivity and inner tumult. For this\nceaseless internal motion requires some external counterpart, and the\nwant of it produces effects like those of emotion which we are obliged\nto suppress. Even trees must be shaken by the wind, if they are to\nthrive. The rule which finds its application here may be most briefly\nexpressed in Latin: _omnis motus, quo celerior, eo magis motus_.\nHow much our happiness depends upon our spirits, and these again upon\nour state of health, may be seen by comparing the influence which the\nsame external circumstances or events have upon us when we are well\nand strong with the effects which they have when we are depressed and\ntroubled with ill-health. It is not what things are objectively and in\nthemselves, but what they are for us, in our way of looking at them,\nthat makes us happy or the reverse. As Epictetus says, _Men are not\ninfluenced by things, but by their thoughts about things_. And, in\ngeneral, nine-tenths of our happiness depends upon health alone. With\nhealth, everything is a source of pleasure; without it, nothing\nelse, whatever it may be, is enjoyable; even the other personal\nblessings,--a great mind, a happy temperament--are degraded and\ndwarfed for want of it. So it is really with good reason that, when\ntwo people meet, the first thing they do is to inquire after each\nother's health, and to express the hope that it is good; for good\nhealth is by far the most important element in human happiness. It\nfollows from all this that the greatest of follies is to sacrifice\nhealth for any other kind of happiness, whatever it may be, for gain,\nadvancement, learning or fame, let alone, then, for fleeting sensual\npleasures. Everything else should rather be postponed to it.\nBut however much health may contribute to that flow of good spirits\nwhich is so essential to our happiness, good spirits do not entirely\ndepend upon health; for a man may be perfectly sound in his physique\nand still possess a melancholy temperament and be generally given up\nto sad thoughts. The ultimate cause of this is undoubtedly to be\nfound in innate, and therefore unalterable, physical constitution,\nespecially in the more or less normal relation of a man's\nsensitiveness to his muscular and vital energy. Abnormal sensitiveness\nproduces inequality of spirits, a predominating melancholy, with\nperiodical fits of unrestrained liveliness. A genius is one whose\nnervous power or sensitiveness is largely in excess; as Aristotle[1]\nhas very correctly observed, _Men distinguished in philosophy,\npolitics, poetry or art appear to be all of a melancholy temperament_.\nThis is doubtless the passage which Cicero has in his mind when\nhe says, as he often does, _Aristoteles ait omnes ingeniosos\nmelancholicos esse_.[2] Shakespeare has very neatly expressed this\nradical and innate diversity of temperament in those lines in _The\nMerchant of Venice_:\n[Footnote 1: Probl. xxx., ep. 1]\n[Footnote 2: Tusc. i., 33.]\n_Nature has framed strange fellows in her time;\nSome that will evermore peep through their eyes,\nAnd laugh, like parrots at a bag-piper;\nAnd others of such vinegar aspect,\nThat they'll not show their teeth in way of smile,\nThough Nestor swear the jest be laughable_.\nThis is the difference which Plato draws between [Greek: eukolos]\nand [Greek: dyskolos]--the man of _easy_, and the man of _difficult_\ndisposition--in proof of which he refers to the varying degrees of\nsusceptibility which different people show to pleasurable and painful\nimpressions; so that one man will laugh at what makes another despair.\nAs a rule, the stronger the susceptibility to unpleasant impressions,\nthe weaker is the susceptibility to pleasant ones, and _vice versa_.\nIf it is is equally possible for an event to turn out well or ill,\nthe [Greek: dyskolos] will be annoyed or grieved if the issue is\nunfavorable, and will not rejoice, should it be happy. On the other\nhand, the [Greek: eukolos] will neither worry nor fret over an\nunfavorable issue, but rejoice if it turns out well. If the one is\nsuccessful in nine out of ten undertakings, he will not be pleased,\nbut rather annoyed that one has miscarried; whilst the other, if only\na single one succeeds, will manage to find consolation in the fact\nand remain cheerful. But here is another instance of the truth,\nthat hardly any evil is entirely without its compensation; for the\nmisfortunes and sufferings which the [Greek: auskoloi], that is,\npeople of gloomy and anxious character, have to overcome, are, on the\nwhole, more imaginary and therefore less real than those which befall\nthe gay and careless; for a man who paints everything black, who\nconstantly fears the worst and takes measures accordingly, will not be\ndisappointed so often in this world, as one who always looks upon the\nbright side of things. And when a morbid affection of the nerves, or a\nderangement of the digestive organs, plays into the hands of an\ninnate tendency to gloom, this tendency may reach such a height that\npermanent discomfort produces a weariness of life. So arises an\ninclination to suicide, which even the most trivial unpleasantness may\nactually bring about; nay, when the tendency attains its worst form,\nit may be occasioned by nothing in particular, but a man may resolve\nto put an end to his existence, simply because he is permanently\nunhappy, and then coolly and firmly carry out his determination;\nas may be seen by the way in which the sufferer, when placed under\nsupervision, as he usually is, eagerly waits to seize the first\nunguarded moment, when, without a shudder, without a struggle or\nrecoil, he may use the now natural and welcome means of effecting his\nrelease.[1] Even the healthiest, perhaps even the most cheerful\nman, may resolve upon death under certain circumstances; when, for\ninstance, his sufferings, or his fears of some inevitable misfortune,\nreach such a pitch as to outweigh the terrors of death. The only\ndifference lies in the degree of suffering necessary to bring about\nthe fatal act, a degree which will be high in the case of a cheerful,\nand low in that of a gloomy man. The greater the melancholy, the lower\nneed the degree be; in the end, it may even sink to zero. But if a man\nis cheerful, and his spirits are supported by good health, it requires\na high degree of suffering to make him lay hands upon himself. There\nare countless steps in the scale between the two extremes of suicide,\nthe suicide which springs merely from a morbid intensification of\ninnate gloom, and the suicide of the healthy and cheerful man, who has\nentirely objective grounds for putting an end to his existence.\n[Footnote 1: For a detailed description of this condition of mind _Cf_\nEsquirol, _Des maladies mentales_.]\nBeauty is partly an affair of health. It may be reckoned as a personal\nadvantage; though it does not, properly speaking, contribute directly\nto our happiness. It does so indirectly, by impressing other people;\nand it is no unimportant advantage, even in man. Beauty is an open\nletter of recommendation, predisposing the heart to favor the person\nwho presents it. As is well said in these lines of Homer, the gift of\nbeauty is not lightly to be thrown away, that glorious gift which none\ncan bestow save the gods alone--\n[Greek: outoi hapoblaet erti theon erikuoea dora,\nossa ken autoi dosin, ekon douk an tis eloito].[1]\n[Footnote 1: _Iliad_ 3, 65.]\nThe most general survey shows us that the two foes of human happiness\nare pain and boredom. We may go further, and say that in the degree in\nwhich we are fortunate enough to get away from the one, we approach\nthe other. Life presents, in fact, a more or less violent oscillation\nbetween the two. The reason of this is that each of these two poles\nstands in a double antagonism to the other, external or objective,\nand inner or subjective. Needy surroundings and poverty produce pain;\nwhile, if a man is more than well off, he is bored. Accordingly, while\nthe lower classes are engaged in a ceaseless struggle with need,\nin other words, with pain, the upper carry on a constant and often\ndesperate battle with boredom.[1] The inner or subjective antagonism\narises from the fact that, in the individual, susceptibility to\npain varies inversely with susceptibility to boredom, because\nsusceptibility is directly proportionate to mental power. Let\nme explain. A dull mind is, as a rule, associated with dull\nsensibilities, nerves which no stimulus can affect, a temperament, in\nshort, which does not feel pain or anxiety very much, however great\nor terrible it may be. Now, intellectual dullness is at the bottom of\nthat _vacuity of soul_ which is stamped on so many faces, a state of\nmind which betrays itself by a constant and lively attention to all\nthe trivial circumstances in the external world. This is the true\nsource of boredom--a continual panting after excitement, in order to\nhave a pretext for giving the mind and spirits something to occupy\nthem. The kind of things people choose for this purpose shows that\nthey are not very particular, as witness the miserable pastimes they\nhave recourse to, and their ideas of social pleasure and conversation:\nor again, the number of people who gossip on the doorstep or gape out\nof the window. It is mainly because of this inner vacuity of soul that\npeople go in quest of society, diversion, amusement, luxury of every\nsort, which lead many to extravagance and misery. Nothing is so good\na protection against such misery as inward wealth, the wealth of\nthe mind, because the greater it grows, the less room it leaves for\nboredom. The inexhaustible activity of thought! Finding ever new\nmaterial to work upon in the multifarious phenomena of self and\nnature, and able and ready to form new combinations of them,--there\nyou have something that invigorates the mind, and apart from moments\nof relaxation, sets it far above the reach of boredom.\n[Footnote 1: And the extremes meet; for the lowest state of\ncivilization, a nomad or wandering life, finds its counterpart in the\nhighest, where everyone is at times a tourist. The earlier stage was a\ncase of necessity; the latter is a remedy for boredom.]\nBut, on the other hand, this high degree of intelligence is rooted in\na high degree of susceptibility, greater strength of will, greater\npassionateness; and from the union of these qualities comes an\nincreased capacity for emotion, an enhanced sensibility to all mental\nand even bodily pain, greater impatience of obstacles, greater\nresentment of interruption;--all of which tendencies are augmented by\nthe power of the imagination, the vivid character of the whole range\nof thought, including what is disagreeable. This applies, in various\ndegrees, to every step in the long scale of mental power, from the\nveriest dunce to the greatest genius that ever lived. Therefore the\nnearer anyone is, either from a subjective or from an objective point\nof view, to one of those sources of suffering in human life, the\nfarther he is from the other. And so a man's natural bent will lead\nhim to make his objective world conform to his subjective as much as\npossible; that is to say, he will take the greatest measures against\nthat form of suffering to which he is most liable. The wise man will,\nabove all, strive after freedom from pain and annoyance, quiet and\nleisure, consequently a tranquil, modest life, with as few encounters\nas may be; and so, after a little experience of his so-called\nfellowmen, he will elect to live in retirement, or even, if he is\na man of great intellect, in solitude. For the more a man has in\nhimself, the less he will want from other people,--the less, indeed,\nother people can be to him. This is why a high degree of intellect\ntends to make a man unsocial. True, if _quality_ of intellect could be\nmade up for by quantity, it might be worth while to live even in the\ngreat world; but unfortunately, a hundred fools together will not make\none wise man.\nBut the individual who stands at the other end of the scale is no\nsooner free from the pangs of need than he endeavors to get pastime\nand society at any cost, taking up with the first person he meets, and\navoiding nothing so much as himself. For in solitude, where every one\nis thrown upon his own resources, what a man has in himself comes\nto light; the fool in fine raiment groans under the burden of his\nmiserable personality, a burden which he can never throw off, whilst\nthe man of talent peoples the waste places with his animating\nthoughts. Seneca declares that folly is its own burden,--_omnis\nstultitia laborat fastidio sui_,--a very true saying, with which may\nbe compared the words of Jesus, the son of Sirach, _The life of a fool\nis worse than death_[1]. And, as a rule, it will be found that a man\nis sociable just in the degree in which he is intellectually poor and\ngenerally vulgar. For one's choice in this world does not go much\nbeyond solitude on one side and vulgarity on the other. It is said\nthat the most sociable of all people are the negroes; and they are at\nthe bottom of the scale in intellect. I remember reading once in a\nFrench paper[2] that the blacks in North America, whether free or\nenslaved, are fond of shutting themselves up in large numbers in the\nsmallest space, because they cannot have too much of one another's\nsnub-nosed company.\n[Footnote 1: Ecclesiasticus, xxii. 11.]\n[Footnote 2: _Le Commerce_, Oct. 19th, 1837.]\nThe brain may be regarded as a kind of parasite of the organism, a\npensioner, as it were, who dwells with the body: and leisure, that\nis, the time one has for the free enjoyment of one's consciousness or\nindividuality, is the fruit or produce of the rest of existence, which\nis in general only labor and effort. But what does most people's\nleisure yield?--boredom and dullness; except, of course, when it is\noccupied with sensual pleasure or folly. How little such leisure is\nworth may be seen in the way in which it is spent: and, as Ariosto\nobserves, how miserable are the idle hours of ignorant men!--_ozio\nlungo d'uomini ignoranti_. Ordinary people think merely how they shall\n_spend_ their time; a man of any talent tries to _use_ it. The reason\nwhy people of limited intellect are apt to be bored is that their\nintellect is absolutely nothing more than the means by which the\nmotive power of the will is put into force: and whenever there is\nnothing particular to set the will in motion, it rests, and their\nintellect takes a holiday, because, equally with the will, it requires\nsomething external to bring it into play. The result is an awful\nstagnation of whatever power a man has--in a word, boredom. To\ncounteract this miserable feeling, men run to trivialities which\nplease for the moment they are taken up, hoping thus to engage the\nwill in order to rouse it to action, and so set the intellect in\nmotion; for it is the latter which has to give effect to these motives\nof the will. Compared with real and natural motives, these are but as\npaper money to coin; for their value is only arbitrary--card games and\nthe like, which have been invented for this very purpose. And if there\nis nothing else to be done, a man will twirl his thumbs or beat the\ndevil's tattoo; or a cigar may be a welcome substitute for exercising\nhis brains. Hence, in all countries the chief occupation of society is\ncard-playing,[1] and it is the gauge of its value, and an outward sign\nthat it is bankrupt in thought. Because people have no thoughts to\ndeal in, they deal cards, and try and win one another's money. Idiots!\nBut I do not wish to be unjust; so let me remark that it may certainly\nbe said in defence of card-playing that it is a preparation for the\nworld and for business life, because one learns thereby how to make a\nclever use of fortuitous but unalterable circumstances (cards, in this\ncase), and to get as much out of them as one can: and to do this a man\nmust learn a little dissimulation, and how to put a good face upon a\nbad business. But, on the other hand, it is exactly for this reason\nthat card-playing is so demoralizing, since the whole object of it is\nto employ every kind of trick and machination in order to win\nwhat belongs to another. And a habit of this sort, learnt at the\ncard-table, strikes root and pushes its way into practical life; and\nin the affairs of every day a man gradually comes to regard _meum_ and\n_tuum_ in much the same light as cards, and to consider that he may\nuse to the utmost whatever advantages he possesses, so long as he does\nnot come within the arm of the law. Examples of what I mean are of\ndaily occurrence in mercantile life. Since, then, leisure is the\nflower, or rather the fruit, of existence, as it puts a man into\npossession of himself, those are happy indeed who possess something\nreal in themselves. But what do you get from most people's\nleisure?--only a good-for-nothing fellow, who is terribly bored and a\nburden to himself. Let us, therefore, rejoice, dear brethren, for _we\nare not children of the bondwoman, but of the free_.\n[Footnote 1: _Translator's Note_.--Card-playing to this extent is now,\nno doubt, a thing of the past, at any rate amongst the nations\nof northern Europe. The present fashion is rather in favor of a\ndilettante interest in art or literature.]\nFurther, as no land is so well off as that which requires few imports,\nor none at all, so the happiest man is one who has enough in his own\ninner wealth, and requires little or nothing from outside for his\nmaintenance, for imports are expensive things, reveal dependence,\nentail danger, occasion trouble, and when all is said and done, are\na poor substitute for home produce. No man ought to expect much from\nothers, or, in general, from the external world. What one human being\ncan be to another is not a very great deal: in the end every one\nstands alone, and the important thing is _who_ it is that stands\nalone. Here, then, is another application of the general truth which\nGoethe recognizes in _Dichtung und Wahrheit_ (Bk. III.), that in\neverything a man has ultimately to appeal to himself; or, as Goldsmith\nputs it in _The Traveller_:\n_Still to ourselves in every place consign'd\nOur own felicity we make or find_.\nHimself is the source of the best and most a man can be or achieve.\nThe more this is so--the more a man finds his sources of pleasure in\nhimself--the happier he will be. Therefore, it is with great truth\nthat Aristotle[1] says, _To be happy means to be self-sufficient_. For\nall other sources of happiness are in their nature most uncertain,\nprecarious, fleeting, the sport of chance; and so even under the most\nfavorable circumstances they can easily be exhausted; nay, this is\nunavoidable, because they are not always within reach. And in old age\nthese sources of happiness must necessarily dry up:--love leaves us\nthen, and wit, desire to travel, delight in horses, aptitude for\nsocial intercourse; friends and relations, too, are taken from us by\ndeath. Then more than ever, it depends upon what a man has in himself;\nfor this will stick to him longest; and at any period of life it is\nthe only genuine and lasting source of happiness. There is not much to\nbe got anywhere in the world. It is filled with misery and pain; and\nif a man escapes these, boredom lies in wait for him at every corner.\nNay more; it is evil which generally has the upper hand, and folly\nmakes the most noise. Fate is cruel, and mankind is pitiable. In such\na world as this, a man who is rich in himself is like a bright, warm,\nhappy room at Christmastide, while without are the frost and snow of\na December night. Therefore, without doubt, the happiest destiny on\nearth is to have the rare gift of a rich individuality, and, more\nespecially to be possessed of a good endowment of intellect; this\nis the happiest destiny, though it may not be, after all, a very\nbrilliant one.\n[Footnote 1: Eth. Eud, vii 2]\nThere was a great wisdom in that remark which Queen Christina of\nSweden made, in her nineteenth year, about Descartes, who had then\nlived for twenty years in the deepest solitude in Holland, and, apart\nfrom report, was known to her only by a single essay: _M. Descartes_,\nshe said, _is the happiest of men, and his condition seems to me much\nto be envied.[1]_ Of course, as was the case with Descartes, external\ncircumstances must be favorable enough to allow a man to be master of\nhis life and happiness; or, as we read in _Ecclesiastes_[2]--_Wisdom\nis good together with an inheritance, and profitable unto them that\nsee the sun_. The man to whom nature and fate have granted the\nblessing of wisdom, will be most anxious and careful to keep open\nthe fountains of happiness which he has in himself; and for this,\nindependence and leisure are necessary. To obtain them, he will be\nwilling to moderate his desires and harbor his resources, all the more\nbecause he is not, like others, restricted to the external world for\nhis pleasures. So he will not be misled by expectations of office, or\nmoney, or the favor and applause of his fellowmen, into surrendering\nhimself in order to conform to low desires and vulgar tastes; nay, in\nsuch a case he will follow the advice that Horace gives in his epistle\nto Maecenas.[3]\n[Footnote 1: _Vie de Descartes_, par Baillet. Liv. vii., ch. 10.]\n[Footnote 2: vii. 12.]\n[Footnote 3: Lib. 1., ep. 7.]\n_Nec somnum plebis laudo, satur altilium, nec\nOtia divitiis Arabum liberrima muto_.\nIt is a great piece of folly to sacrifice the inner for the outer man,\nto give the whole or the greater part of one's quiet, leisure and\nindependence for splendor, rank, pomp, titles and honor. This is what\nGoethe did. My good luck drew me quite in the other direction.\nThe truth which I am insisting upon here, the truth, namely, that the\nchief source of human happiness is internal, is confirmed by that most\naccurate observation of Aristotle in the _Nichomachean Ethics_[1] that\nevery pleasure presupposes some sort of activity, the application of\nsome sort of power, without which it cannot exist. The doctrine of\nAristotle's, that a man's happiness consists in the free exercise\nof his highest faculties, is also enunciated by Stobaeus in his\nexposition of the Peripatetic philosophy[2]: _happiness_, he says,\n_means vigorous and successful activity in all your undertakings_; and\nhe explains that by _vigor [Greek: aretae]_ he means _mastery_ in any\nthing, whatever it be. Now, the original purpose of those forces with\nwhich nature has endowed man is to enable him to struggle against the\ndifficulties which beset him on all sides. But if this struggle comes\nto an end, his unemployed forces become a burden to him; and he has to\nset to work and play with them,--to use them, I mean, for no purpose\nat all, beyond avoiding the other source of human suffering, boredom,\nto which he is at once exposed. It is the upper classes, people of\nwealth, who are the greatest victims of boredom. Lucretius long ago\ndescribed their miserable state, and the truth of his description may\nbe still recognized to-day, in the life of every great capital--where\nthe rich man is seldom in his own halls, because it bores him to be\nthere, and still he returns thither, because he is no better off\noutside;--or else he is away in post-haste to his house in the\ncountry, as if it were on fire; and he is no sooner arrived there,\nthan he is bored again, and seeks to forget everything in sleep, or\nelse hurries back to town once more.\n[Footnote 1: i. 7 and vii. 13, 14.]\n[Footnote 2: Ecl. eth. ii., ch 7.]\n_Exit saepe foras magnis ex aedibus ille,\nEsse domi quem pertaesum est, subitoque reventat,\nQuippe foris nihilo melius qui sentiat esse.\nCurrit, agens mannos, ad villam precipitanter,\nAuxilium tectis quasi ferre ardentibus instans:\nOscitat extemplo, tetigit quum limina villae;\nAut abit in somnum gravis, atque oblivia quaerit;\nAut etiam properans urbem petit atque revisit_.[1]\n[Footnote 1: III 1073.]\nIn their youth, such people must have had a superfluity of muscular\nand vital energy,--powers which, unlike those of the mind, cannot\nmaintain their full degree of vigor very long; and in later years they\neither have no mental powers at all, or cannot develop any for want\nof employment which would bring them into play; so that they are in a\nwretched plight. _Will_, however, they still possess, for this is the\nonly power that is inexhaustible; and they try to stimulate their\nwill by passionate excitement, such as games of chance for high\nstakes--undoubtedly a most degrading form of vice. And one may say\ngenerally that if a man finds himself with nothing to do, he is sure\nto choose some amusement suited to the kind of power in which he\nexcels,--bowls, it may be, or chess; hunting or painting; horse-racing\nor music; cards, or poetry, heraldry, philosophy, or some other\ndilettante interest. We might classify these interests methodically,\nby reducing them to expressions of the three fundamental powers,\nthe factors, that is to say, which go to make up the physiological\nconstitution of man; and further, by considering these powers by\nthemselves, and apart from any of the definite aims which they may\nsubserve, and simply as affording three sources of possible pleasure,\nout of which every man will choose what suits him, according as he\nexcels in one direction or another.\nFirst of all come the pleasures of _vital energy_, of food, drink,\ndigestion, rest and sleep; and there are parts of the world where it\ncan be said that these are characteristic and national pleasures.\nSecondly, there are the pleasures of _muscular energy_, such as\nwalking, running, wrestling, dancing, fencing, riding and similar\nathletic pursuits, which sometimes take the form of sport, and\nsometimes of a military life and real warfare. Thirdly, there are the\npleasures of sensibility, such as observation, thought, feeling, or\na taste for poetry or culture, music, learning, reading, meditation,\ninvention, philosophy and the like. As regards the value, relative\nworth and duration of each of these kinds of pleasure, a great deal\nmight be said, which, however, I leave the reader to supply. But every\none will see that the nobler the power which is brought into play,\nthe greater will be the pleasure which it gives; for pleasure always\ninvolves the use of one's own powers, and happiness consists in a\nfrequent repetition of pleasure. No one will deny that in this respect\nthe pleasures of sensibility occupy a higher place than either of\nthe other two fundamental kinds; which exist in an equal, nay, in\na greater degree in brutes; it is this preponderating amount of\nsensibility which distinguishes man from other animals. Now, our\nmental powers are forms of sensibility, and therefore a preponderating\namount of it makes us capable of that kind of pleasure which has to do\nwith mind, so-called intellectual pleasure; and the more sensibility\npredominates, the greater the pleasure will be.[1]\n[Footnote 1: Nature exhibits a continual progress, starting from the\nmechanical and chemical activity of the inorganic world, proceeding\nto the vegetable, with its dull enjoyment of self, from that to the\nanimal world, where intelligence and consciousness begin, at first\nvery weak, and only after many intermediate stages attaining its last\ngreat development in man, whose intellect is Nature's crowning point,\nthe goal of all her efforts, the most perfect and difficult of all her\nworks. And even within the range of the human intellect, there are a\ngreat many observable differences of degree, and it is very seldom\nthat intellect reaches its highest point, intelligence properly\nso-called, which in this narrow and strict sense of the word, is\nNature's most consummate product, and so the rarest and most precious\nthing of which the world can boast. The highest product of Nature\nis the clearest degree of consciousness, in which the world mirrors\nitself more plainly and completely than anywhere else. A man endowed\nwith this form of intelligence is in possession of what is noblest\nand best on earth; and accordingly, he has a source of pleasure in\ncomparison with which all others are small. From his surroundings he\nasks nothing but leisure for the free enjoyment of what he has got,\ntime, as it were, to polish his diamond. All other pleasures that are\nnot of the intellect are of a lower kind; for they are, one and all,\nmovements of will--desires, hopes, fears and ambitions, no matter to\nwhat directed: they are always satisfied at the cost of pain, and in\nthe case of ambition, generally with more or less of illusion. With\nintellectual pleasure, on the other hand, truth becomes clearer and\nclearer. In the realm of intelligence pain has no power. Knowledge is\nall in all. Further, intellectual pleasures are accessible entirely\nand only through the medium of the intelligence, and are limited by\nits capacity. _For all the wit there is in the world is useless to him\nwho has none_. Still this advantage is accompanied by a substantial\ndisadvantage; for the whole of Nature shows that with the growth of\nintelligence comes increased capacity for pain, and it is only with\nthe highest degree of intelligence that suffering reaches its supreme\npoint.]\nThe normal, ordinary man takes a vivid interest in anything only in so\nfar as it excites his will, that is to say, is a matter of personal\ninterest to him. But constant excitement of the will is never an\nunmixed good, to say the least; in other words, it involves pain.\nCard-playing, that universal occupation of \"good society\" everywhere,\nis a device for providing this kind of excitement, and that, too,\nby means of interests so small as to produce slight and momentary,\ninstead of real and permanent, pain. Card-playing is, in fact, a mere\ntickling of the will.[1]\n[Footnote 1: _Vulgarity_ is, at bottom, the kind of consciousness in\nwhich the will completely predominates over the intellect, where the\nlatter does nothing more than perform the service of its master, the\nwill. Therefore, when the will makes no demands, supplies no motives,\nstrong or weak, the intellect entirely loses its power, and the result\nis complete vacancy of mind. Now _will without intellect_ is the most\nvulgar and common thing in the world, possessed by every blockhead,\nwho, in the gratification of his passions, shows the stuff of which he\nis made. This is the condition of mind called _vulgarity_, in which\nthe only active elements are the organs of sense, and that small\namount of intellect which is necessary for apprehending the data of\nsense. Accordingly, the vulgar man is constantly open to all sorts of\nimpressions, and immediately perceives all the little trifling things\nthat go on in his environment: the lightest whisper, the most trivial\ncircumstance, is sufficient to rouse his attention; he is just like an\nanimal. Such a man's mental condition reveals itself in his face, in\nhis whole exterior; and hence that vulgar, repulsive appearance, which\nis all the more offensive, if, as is usually the case, his will--the\nonly factor in his consciousness--is a base, selfish and altogether\nbad one.]\nOn the other hand, a man of powerful intellect is capable of taking\na vivid interest in things in the way of mere _knowledge_, with no\nadmixture of _will_; nay, such an interest is a necessity to him. It\nplaces him in a sphere where pain is an alien,--a diviner air, where\nthe gods live serene.\n_[Greek: phusis bebion ou ta chraematatheoi reia xoontes][1]_\n[Footnote 1: Odyssey IV., 805.]\nLook on these two pictures--the life of the masses, one long, dull\nrecord of struggle and effort entirely devoted to the petty interests\nof personal welfare, to misery in all its forms, a life beset by\nintolerable boredom as soon as ever those aims are satisfied and the\nman is thrown back upon himself, whence he can be roused again to some\nsort of movement only by the wild fire of passion. On the other side\nyou have a man endowed with a high degree of mental power, leading an\nexistence rich in thought and full of life and meaning, occupied by\nworthy and interesting objects as soon as ever he is free to give\nhimself to them, bearing in himself a source of the noblest pleasure.\nWhat external promptings he wants come from the works of nature, and\nfrom the contemplation of human affairs and the achievements of the\ngreat of all ages and countries, which are thoroughly appreciated by a\nman of this type alone, as being the only one who can quite understand\nand feel with them. And so it is for him alone that those great ones\nhave really lived; it is to him that they make their appeal; the rest\nare but casual hearers who only half understand either them or their\nfollowers. Of course, this characteristic of the intellectual man\nimplies that he has one more need than the others, the need of\nreading, observing, studying, meditating, practising, the need, in\nshort, of undisturbed leisure. For, as Voltaire has very rightly said,\n_there are no real pleasures without real needs_; and the need of them\nis why to such a man pleasures are accessible which are denied to\nothers,--the varied beauties of nature and art and literature. To\nheap these pleasures round people who do not want them and cannot\nappreciate them, is like expecting gray hairs to fall in love. A man\nwho is privileged in this respect leads two lives, a personal and an\nintellectual life; and the latter gradually comes to be looked upon\nas the true one, and the former as merely a means to it. Other people\nmake this shallow, empty and troubled existence an end in itself. To\nthe life of the intellect such a man will give the preference over\nall his other occupations: by the constant growth of insight and\nknowledge, this intellectual life, like a slowly-forming work of art,\nwill acquire a consistency, a permanent intensity, a unity which\nbecomes ever more and more complete; compared with which, a life\ndevoted to the attainment of personal comfort, a life that may broaden\nindeed, but can never be deepened, makes but a poor show: and yet,\nas I have said, people make this baser sort of existence an end in\nitself.\nThe ordinary life of every day, so far as it is not moved by passion,\nis tedious and insipid; and if it is so moved, it soon becomes\npainful. Those alone are happy whom nature has favored with some\nsuperfluity of intellect, something beyond what is just necessary to\ncarry out the behests of their will; for it enables them to lead an\nintellectual life as well, a life unattended by pain and full of vivid\ninterests. Mere leisure, that is to say, intellect unoccupied in the\nservice of the will, is not of itself sufficient: there must be a\nreal superfluity of power, set free from the service of the will and\ndevoted to that of the intellect; for, as Seneca says, _otium sine\nlitteris mors est et vivi hominis sepultura_--illiterate leisure is\na form of death, a living tomb. Varying with the amount of the\nsuperfluity, there will be countless developments in this second life,\nthe life of the mind; it may be the mere collection and labelling of\ninsects, birds, minerals, coins, or the highest achievements of poetry\nand philosophy. The life of the mind is not only a protection against\nboredom; it also wards off the pernicious effects of boredom; it keeps\nus from bad company, from the many dangers, misfortunes, losses and\nextravagances which the man who places his happiness entirely in the\nobjective world is sure to encounter, My philosophy, for instance, has\nnever brought me in a six-pence; but it has spared me many an expense.\nThe ordinary man places his life's happiness in things external to\nhim, in property, rank, wife and children, friends, society, and the\nlike, so that when he loses them or finds them disappointing, the\nfoundation of his happiness is destroyed. In other words, his centre\nof gravity is not in himself; it is constantly changing its place,\nwith every wish and whim. If he is a man of means, one day it will\nbe his house in the country, another buying horses, or entertaining\nfriends, or traveling,--a life, in short, of general luxury, the\nreason being that he seeks his pleasure in things outside him. Like\none whose health and strength are gone, he tries to regain by the use\nof jellies and drugs, instead of by developing his own vital power,\nthe true source of what he has lost. Before proceeding to the\nopposite, let us compare with this common type the man who comes\nmidway between the two, endowed, it may be, not exactly with\ndistinguished powers of mind, but with somewhat more than the ordinary\namount of intellect. He will take a dilettante interest in art, or\ndevote his attention to some branch of science--botany, for example,\nor physics, astronomy, history, and find a great deal of pleasure in\nsuch studies, and amuse himself with them when external forces of\nhappiness are exhausted or fail to satisfy him any more. Of a man like\nthis it may be said that his centre of gravity is partly in himself.\nBut a dilettante interest in art is a very different thing from\ncreative activity; and an amateur pursuit of science is apt to be\nsuperficial and not to penetrate to the heart of the matter. A man\ncannot entirely identify himself with such pursuits, or have his whole\nexistence so completely filled and permeated with them that he loses\nall interest in everything else. It is only the highest intellectual\npower, what we call _genius_, that attains to this degree of\nintensity, making all time and existence its theme, and striving to\nexpress its peculiar conception of the world, whether it contemplates\nlife as the subject of poetry or of philosophy. Hence, undisturbed\noccupation with himself, his own thoughts and works, is a matter of\nurgent necessity to such a man; solitude is welcome, leisure is\nthe highest good, and everything else is unnecessary, nay, even\nburdensome.\nThis is the only type of man of whom it can be said that his centre of\ngravity is entirely in himself; which explains why it is that people\nof this sort--and they are very rare--no matter how excellent their\ncharacter may be, do not show that warm and unlimited interest in\nfriends, family, and the community in general, of which others are\nso often capable; for if they have only themselves they are not\ninconsolable for the loss of everything else. This gives an isolation\nto their character, which is all the more effective since other\npeople never really quite satisfy them, as being, on the whole, of\na different nature: nay, more; since this difference is constantly\nforcing itself upon their notice they get accustomed to move about\namongst mankind as alien beings, and in thinking of humanity in\ngeneral, to say _they_ instead of _we_.\nSo the conclusion we come to is that the man whom nature has endowed\nwith intellectual wealth is the happiest; so true it is that the\nsubjective concerns us more than the objective; for whatever the\nlatter may be, it can work only indirectly, secondly, and through the\nmedium of the former--a truth finely expressed by Lucian:--\n[Greek: _Aeloutos ho taes psychaes ploutus monos estin alaethaes\nTalla dechei ataen pleiona ton kteanon_--][1]\n[Footnote 1: Epigrammata, 12.]\nthe wealth of the soul is the only true wealth, for with all other\nriches comes a bane even greater than they. The man of inner wealth\nwants nothing from outside but the negative gift of undisturbed\nleisure, to develop and mature his intellectual faculties, that is,\nto enjoy his wealth; in short, he wants permission to be himself,\nhis whole life long, every day and every hour. If he is destined to\nimpress the character of his mind upon a whole race, he has only one\nmeasure of happiness or unhappiness--to succeed or fail in perfecting\nhis powers and completing his work. All else is of small consequence.\nAccordingly, the greatest minds of all ages have set the highest value\nupon undisturbed leisure, as worth exactly as much as the man himself.\n_Happiness appears to consist in leisure_, says Aristotle;[1] and\nDiogenes Laertius reports that _Socrates praised leisure as the\nfairest of all possessions_. So, in the _Nichomachean Ethics_,\nAristotle concludes that a life devoted to philosophy is the happiest;\nor, as he says in the _Politics,[2] the free exercise of any power,\nwhatever it may be, is happiness_. This again, tallies with what\nGoethe says in _Wilhelm Meister: The man who is born with a talent\nwhich he is meant to use, finds his greatest happiness in using it_.\n[Footnote 1: Eth. Nichom. x. 7.]\n[Footnote 2: iv. 11.]\nBut to be in possession of undisturbed leisure, is far from being\nthe common lot; nay, it is something alien to human nature, for the\nordinary man's destiny is to spend life in procuring what is necessary\nfor the subsistence of himself and his family; he is a son of struggle\nand need, not a free intelligence. So people as a rule soon get tired\nof undisturbed leisure, and it becomes burdensome if there are no\nfictitious and forced aims to occupy it, play, pastime and hobbies of\nevery kind. For this very reason it is full of possible danger, and\n_difficilis in otio quies_ is a true saying,--it is difficult to keep\nquiet if you have nothing to do. On the other hand, a measure of\nintellect far surpassing the ordinary, is as unnatural as it is\nabnormal. But if it exists, and the man endowed with it is to be\nhappy, he will want precisely that undisturbed leisure which the\nothers find burdensome or pernicious; for without it he is a Pegasus\nin harness, and consequently unhappy. If these two unnatural\ncircumstances, external, and internal, undisturbed leisure and great\nintellect, happen to coincide in the same person, it is a great piece\nof fortune; and if the fate is so far favorable, a man can lead the\nhigher life, the life protected from the two opposite sources of human\nsuffering, pain and boredom, from the painful struggle for existence,\nand the incapacity for enduring leisure (which is free existence\nitself)--evils which may be escaped only by being mutually\nneutralized.\nBut there is something to be said in opposition to this view. Great\nintellectual gifts mean an activity pre-eminently nervous in its\ncharacter, and consequently a very high degree of susceptibility to\npain in every form. Further, such gifts imply an intense temperament,\nlarger and more vivid ideas, which, as the inseparable accompaniment\nof great intellectual power, entail on its possessor a corresponding\nintensity of the emotions, making them incomparably more violent than\nthose to which the ordinary man is a prey. Now, there are more things\nin the world productive of pain than of pleasure. Again, a large\nendowment of intellect tends to estrange the man who has it from other\npeople and their doings; for the more a man has in himself, the less\nhe will be able to find in them; and the hundred things in which they\ntake delight, he will think shallow and insipid. Here, then, perhaps,\nis another instance of that law of compensation which makes itself\nfelt everywhere. How often one hears it said, and said, too, with some\nplausibility, that the narrow-minded man is at bottom the happiest,\neven though his fortune is unenviable. I shall make no attempt to\nforestall the reader's own judgment on this point; more especially as\nSophocles himself has given utterance to two diametrically opposite\nopinions:--\n[Greek: Pollo to phronein eudaimonias\nproton uparchei.][1]\nhe says in one place--wisdom is the greatest part of happiness;\nand again, in another passage, he declares that the life of the\nthoughtless is the most pleasant of all--\n[Greek: En ta phronein gar maeden aedistos bios.][2]\nThe philosophers of the _Old Testament_ find themselves in a like\ncontradiction.\n_The life of a fool is worse than death_[3]\nand--\n_In much wisdom is much grief; and he that increaseth knowledge\nincreaseth sorrow_.[4]\n[Footnote 1: Antigone, 1347-8.]\n[Footnote 2: Ajax, 554.]\n[Footnote 3: Ecclesiasticus, xxii. 11.]\n[Footnote 4: Ecclesiastes, i. 18.]\nI may remark, however, that a man who has no mental needs, because his\nintellect is of the narrow and normal amount, is, in the strict sense\nof the word, what is called a _philistine_--an expression at first\npeculiar to the German language, a kind of slang term at the\nUniversities, afterwards used, by analogy, in a higher sense, though\nstill in its original meaning, as denoting one who is not _a Son of\nthe Muses_. A philistine is and remains [Greek: amousos anaer]. I\nshould prefer to take a higher point of view, and apply the term\n_philistine_ to people who are always seriously occupied with\nrealities which are no realities; but as such a definition would be a\ntranscendental one, and therefore not generally intelligible, it\nwould hardly be in place in the present treatise, which aims at\nbeing popular. The other definition can be more easily elucidated,\nindicating, as it does, satisfactorily enough, the essential nature of\nall those qualities which distinguish the philistine. He is defined to\nbe _a man without mental needs_. From this is follows, firstly, _in\nrelation to himself_, that he has _no intellectual pleasures_; for, as\nwas remarked before, there are no real pleasures without real needs.\nThe philistine's life is animated by no desire to gain knowledge and\ninsight for their own sake, or to experience that true aeesthetic\npleasure which is so nearly akin to them. If pleasures of this kind\nare fashionable, and the philistine finds himself compelled to pay\nattention to them, he will force himself to do so, but he will take as\nlittle interest in them as possible. His only real pleasures are of a\nsensual kind, and he thinks that these indemnify him for the loss of\nthe others. To him oysters and champagne are the height of existence;\nthe aim of his life is to procure what will contribute to his bodily\nwelfare, and he is indeed in a happy way if this causes him some\ntrouble. If the luxuries of life are heaped upon him, he will\ninevitably be bored, and against boredom he has a great many fancied\nremedies, balls, theatres, parties, cards, gambling, horses, women,\ndrinking, traveling and so on; all of which can not protect a man\nfrom being bored, for where there are no intellectual needs, no\nintellectual pleasures are possible. The peculiar characteristic\nof the philistine is a dull, dry kind of gravity, akin to that of\nanimals. Nothing really pleases, or excites, or interests him, for\nsensual pleasure is quickly exhausted, and the society of philistines\nsoon becomes burdensome, and one may even get tired of playing cards.\nTrue, the pleasures of vanity are left, pleasures which he enjoys in\nhis own way, either by feeling himself superior in point of wealth, or\nrank, or influence and power to other people, who thereupon pay\nhim honor; or, at any rate, by going about with those who have a\nsuperfluity of these blessings, sunning himself in the reflection of\ntheir splendor--what the English call a _snob_.\nFrom the essential nature of the philistine it follows, secondly, _in\nregard to others_, that, as he possesses no intellectual, but only\nphysical need, he will seek the society of those who can satisfy the\nlatter, but not the former. The last thing he will expect from his\nfriends is the possession of any sort of intellectual capacity; nay,\nif he chances to meet with it, it will rouse his antipathy and\neven hatred; simply because in addition to an unpleasant sense of\ninferiority, he experiences, in his heart, a dull kind of envy, which\nhas to be carefully concealed even from himself. Nevertheless, it\nsometimes grows into a secret feeling of rancor. But for all that,\nit will never occur to him to make his own ideas of worth or value\nconform to the standard of such qualities; he will continue to give\nthe preference to rank and riches, power and influence, which in his\neyes seem to be the only genuine advantages in the world; and his wish\nwill be to excel in them himself. All this is the consequence of his\nbeing a man _without intellectual needs_. The great affliction of all\nphilistines is that they have no interest in _ideas_, and that, to\nescape being bored, they are in constant need of _realities_. But\nrealities are either unsatisfactory or dangerous; when they lose their\ninterest, they become fatiguing. But the ideal world is illimitable\nand calm,\n_something afar\nFrom the sphere of our sorrow_.\nNOTE.--In these remarks on the personal qualities which go to make\nhappiness, I have been mainly concerned with the physical and\nintellectual nature of man. For an account of the direct and immediate\ninfluence of _morality_ upon happiness, let me refer to my prize essay\non _The Foundation of Morals_ (Sec. 22.)", "source": "the_wisdom_of_life.txt"}
