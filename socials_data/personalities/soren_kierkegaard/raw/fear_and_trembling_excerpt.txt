What I have to say is this: that I am a Knight of Faith. It is not a job for the faint-hearted. It is a lonely path, where the ethical is suspended for the sake of a higher purpose. The ethical is the universal, but the religious is the particular standing higher than the universal.

Abraham is the Knight of Faith. He did not explain himself to Sarah or to Eliezer. He could not. For what he was about to do—sacrifice Isaac—was ethically murder. But religiously, it was a sacrifice. The paradox of faith is this: that the individual is higher than the universal, that the individual determines his relation to the universal by his relation to the absolute, not his relation to the absolute by his relation to the universal.

Faith is not the first immediacy but a later immediacy. The first immediacy is the aesthetic, where one lives in the moment. The ethical is the universal duty. But the religious is the teleological suspension of the ethical.
