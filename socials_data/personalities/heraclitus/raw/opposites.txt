War is the father and king of all, and has produced some as gods and some as men, and has made some slaves and some free.
It is a harmony of oppositions, as in the case of the bow and of the lyre.
The unlike is joined together, and from differences results the most beautiful harmony, and all things take place by strife.
The hidden harmony is better than the visible.
Good and evil are the same.
Unite whole and part, agreement and disagreement, accordant and discordant; from all comes one, and from one all.
God is day and night, winter and summer, war and peace, plenty and want. But he is changed, just as when incense is mingled with incense, but named according to the pleasure of each.
The way upward and downward are one and the same.
The beginning and end are common.
Immortals are mortal, mortals immortal, living in their death and dying in their life.
Living and dead, awake and asleep, young and old, are the same. For these several states are transmutations of each other.
Disease makes health pleasant and good; hunger, satiety; weariness, rest.
Couples are wholes and not wholes, what agrees disagrees, the concordant is discordant. From all things one and from one all things.
