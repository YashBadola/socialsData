{"text": "THE FIRST BOOK\nI. Of my grandfather Verus I have learned to be gentle and meek, and to\nrefrain from all anger and passion. From the fame and memory of him that\nbegot me I have learned both shamefastness and manlike behaviour. Of my\nmother I have learned to be religious, and bountiful; and to forbear,\nnot only to do, but to intend any evil; to content myself with a spare\ndiet, and to fly all such excess as is incidental to great wealth. Of my\ngreat-grandfather, both to frequent public schools and auditories, and\nto get me good and able teachers at home; and that I ought not to think\nmuch, if upon such occasions, I were at excessive charges.\nII. Of him that brought me up, not to be fondly addicted to either of\nthe two great factions of the coursers in the circus, called Prasini,\nand Veneti: nor in the amphitheatre partially to favour any of the\ngladiators, or fencers, as either the Parmularii, or the Secutores.\nMoreover, to endure labour; nor to need many things; when I have\nanything to do, to do it myself rather than by others; not to meddle\nwith many businesses; and not easily to admit of any slander.\nIII. Of Diognetus, not to busy myself about vain things, and not easily\nto believe those things, which are commonly spoken, by such as take upon\nthem to work wonders, and by sorcerers, or prestidigitators, and\nimpostors; concerning the power of charms, and their driving out of\ndemons, or evil spirits; and the like. Not to keep quails for the game;\nnor to be mad after such things. Not to be offended with other men's\nliberty of speech, and to apply myself unto philosophy. Him also I must\nthank, that ever I heard first Bacchius, then Tandasis and Marcianus,\nand that I did write dialogues in my youth; and that I took liking to\nthe philosophers' little couch and skins, and such other things, which\nby the Grecian discipline are proper to those who profess philosophy.\nIV. To Rusticus I am beholding, that I first entered into the conceit\nthat my life wanted some redress and cure. And then, that I did not\nfall into the ambition of ordinary sophists, either to write tracts\nconcerning the common theorems, or to exhort men unto virtue and the\nstudy of philosophy by public orations; as also that I never by way of\nostentation did affect to show myself an active able man, for any kind\nof bodily exercises. And that I gave over the study of rhetoric and\npoetry, and of elegant neat language. That I did not use to walk about\nthe house in my long robe, nor to do any such things. Moreover I learned\nof him to write letters without any affectation, or curiosity; such as\nthat was, which by him was written to my mother from Sinuessa: and to be\neasy and ready to be reconciled, and well pleased again with them that\nhad offended me, as soon as any of them would be content to seek unto\nme again. To read with diligence; not to rest satisfied with a light and\nsuperficial knowledge, nor quickly to assent to things commonly spoken\nof: whom also I must thank that ever I lighted upon Epictetus his\n_Hypomnemata_, or moral commentaries and common-factions: which also he\ngave me of his own.\nV. From Apollonius, true liberty, and unvariable steadfastness, and not\nto regard anything at all, though never so little, but right and reason:\nand always, whether in the sharpest pains, or after the loss of a child,\nor in long diseases, to be still the same man; who also was a present\nand visible example unto me, that it was possible for the same man to\nbe both vehement and remiss: a man not subject to be vexed, and offended\nwith the incapacity of his scholars and auditors in his lectures and\nexpositions; and a true pattern of a man who of all his good gifts\nand faculties, least esteemed in himself, that his excellent skill and\nability to teach and persuade others the common theorems and maxims of\nthe Stoic philosophy. Of him also I learned how to receive favours and\nkindnesses (as commonly they are accounted:) from friends, so that I\nmight not become obnoxious unto them, for them, nor more yielding upon\noccasion, than in right I ought; and yet so that I should not pass them\nneither, as an unsensible and unthankful man.\nVI. Of Sextus, mildness and the pattern of a family governed with\npaternal affection; and a purpose to live according to nature: to be\ngrave without affectation: to observe carefully the several dispositions\nof my friends, not to be offended with idiots, nor unseasonably to set\nupon those that are carried with the vulgar opinions, with the theorems,\nand tenets of philosophers: his conversation being an example how a man\nmight accommodate himself to all men and companies; so that though his\ncompany were sweeter and more pleasing than any flatterer's cogging and\nfawning; yet was it at the same time most respected and reverenced: who\nalso had a proper happiness and faculty, rationally and methodically to\nfind out, and set in order all necessary determinations and instructions\nfor a man's life. A man without ever the least appearance of anger, or\nany other passion; able at the same time most exactly to observe the\nStoic _Apathia_, or unpassionateness, and yet to be most tender-hearted:\never of good credit; and yet almost without any noise, or rumour: very\nlearned, and yet making little show.\nVII. From Alexander the Grammarian, to be un-reprovable myself, and not\nreproachfully to reprehend any man for a barbarism, or a solecism, or\nany false pronunciation, but dextrously by way of answer, or testimony,\nor confirmation of the same matter (taking no notice of the word) to\nutter it as it should have been spoken; or by some other such close and\nindirect admonition, handsomely and civilly to tell him of it.\nVIII. Of Fronto, to how much envy and fraud and hypocrisy the state of a\ntyrannous king is subject unto, and how they who are commonly called\n\u03b5\u1f50\u03c0\u03b1\u03c4\u03c1\u1f77\u03b4\u03b1\u03b9, _i.e._ nobly born, are in some sort incapable, or void\nof natural affection.\nIX. Of Alexander the Platonic, not often nor without great necessity to\nsay, or to write to any man in a letter, 'I am not at leisure'; nor in\nthis manner still to put off those duties, which we owe to our friends\nand acquaintances (to every one in his kind) under pretence of urgent\naffairs.\nX. Of Catulus, not to contemn any friend's expostulation, though unjust,\nbut to strive to reduce him to his former disposition: freely and\nheartily to speak well of all my masters upon any occasion, as it is\nreported of Domitius, and Athenodotus: and to love my children with true\naffection.\nXI. From my brother Severus, to be kind and loving to all them of my\nhouse and family; by whom also I came to the knowledge of Thrasea and\nHelvidius, and Cato, and Dio, and Brutus. He it was also that did put me\nin the first conceit and desire of an equal commonwealth, administered\nby justice and equality; and of a kingdom wherein should be regarded\nnothing more than the good and welfare of the subjects. Of him also,\nto observe a constant tenor, (not interrupted, with any other cares and\ndistractions,) in the study and esteem of philosophy: to be bountiful\nand liberal in the largest measure; always to hope the best; and to\nbe confident that my friends love me. In whom I moreover observed open\ndealing towards those whom he reproved at any time, and that his friends\nmight without all doubt or much observation know what he would, or would\nnot, so open and plain was he.\nXII. From Claudius Maximus, in all things to endeavour to have power\nof myself, and in nothing to be carried about; to be cheerful and\ncourageous in all sudden chances and accidents, as in sicknesses: to\nlove mildness, and moderation, and gravity: and to do my business,\nwhatsoever it be, thoroughly, and without querulousness. Whatsoever\nhe said, all men believed him that as he spake, so he thought, and\nwhatsoever he did, that he did it with a good intent. His manner was,\nnever to wonder at anything; never to be in haste, and yet never\nslow: nor to be perplexed, or dejected, or at any time unseemly, or\nexcessively to laugh: nor to be angry, or suspicious, but ever ready to\ndo good, and to forgive, and to speak truth; and all this, as one that\nseemed rather of himself to have been straight and right, than ever to\nhave been rectified or redressed; neither was there any man that ever\nthought himself undervalued by him, or that could find in his heart, to\nthink himself a better man than he. He would also be very pleasant and\ngracious.\nXIII. In my father, I observed his meekness; his constancy without\nwavering in those things, which after a due examination and\ndeliberation, he had determined. How free from all vanity he carried\nhimself in matter of honour and dignity, (as they are esteemed:) his\nlaboriousness and assiduity, his readiness to hear any man, that had\naught to say tending to any common good: how generally and impartially\nhe would give every man his due; his skill and knowledge, when rigour\nor extremity, or when remissness or moderation was in season; how he did\nabstain from all unchaste love of youths; his moderate condescending to\nother men's occasions as an ordinary man, neither absolutely requiring\nof his friends, that they should wait upon him at his ordinary meals,\nnor that they should of necessity accompany him in his journeys; and\nthat whensoever any business upon some necessary occasions was to be put\noff and omitted before it could be ended, he was ever found when he\nwent about it again, the same man that he was before. His accurate\nexamination of things in consultations, and patient hearing of others.\nHe would not hastily give over the search of the matter, as one easy to\nbe satisfied with sudden notions and apprehensions. His care to preserve\nhis friends; how neither at any time he would carry himself towards them\nwith disdainful neglect, and grow weary of them; nor yet at any time\nbe madly fond of them. His contented mind in all things, his cheerful\ncountenance, his care to foresee things afar off, and to take order for\nthe least, without any noise or clamour. Moreover how all acclamations\nand flattery were repressed by him: how carefully he observed all things\nnecessary to the government, and kept an account of the common expenses,\nand how patiently he did abide that he was reprehended by some for this\nhis strict and rigid kind of dealing. How he was neither a superstitious\nworshipper of the gods, nor an ambitious pleaser of men, or studious of\npopular applause; but sober in all things, and everywhere observant of\nthat which was fitting; no affecter of novelties: in those things which\nconduced to his ease and convenience, (plenty whereof his fortune\ndid afford him,) without pride and bragging, yet with all freedom and\nliberty: so that as he did freely enjoy them without any anxiety or\naffectation when they were present; so when absent, he found no want\nof them. Moreover, that he was never commended by any man, as either a\nlearned acute man, or an obsequious officious man, or a fine orator; but\nas a ripe mature man, a perfect sound man; one that could not endure to\nbe flattered; able to govern both himself and others. Moreover, how much\nhe did honour all true philosophers, without upbraiding those that were\nnot so; his sociableness, his gracious and delightful conversation, but\nnever unto satiety; his care of his body within bounds and measure,\nnot as one that desired to live long, or over-studious of neatness, and\nelegancy; and yet not as one that did not regard it: so that through his\nown care and providence, he seldom needed any inward physic, or outward\napplications: but especially how ingeniously he would yield to any that\nhad obtained any peculiar faculty, as either eloquence, or the knowledge\nof the laws, or of ancient customs, or the like; and how he concurred\nwith them, in his best care and endeavour that every one of them might\nin his kind, for that wherein he excelled, be regarded and esteemed: and\nalthough he did all things carefully after the ancient customs of his\nforefathers, yet even of this was he not desirous that men should take\nnotice, that he did imitate ancient customs. Again, how he was not\neasily moved and tossed up and down, but loved to be constant, both in\nthe same places and businesses; and how after his great fits of headache\nhe would return fresh and vigorous to his wonted affairs. Again, that\nsecrets he neither had many, nor often, and such only as concerned\npublic matters: his discretion and moderation, in exhibiting of the\npublic sights and shows for the pleasure and pastime of the people: in\npublic buildings. congiaries, and the like. In all these things,\nhaving a respect unto men only as men, and to the equity of the things\nthemselves, and not unto the glory that might follow. Never wont to\nuse the baths at unseasonable hours; no builder; never curious, or\nsolicitous, either about his meat, or about the workmanship, or colour\nof his clothes, or about anything that belonged to external beauty.\nIn all his conversation, far from all inhumanity, all boldness, and\nincivility, all greediness and impetuosity; never doing anything with\nsuch earnestness, and intention, that a man could say of him, that\nhe did sweat about it: but contrariwise, all things distinctly, as at\nleisure; without trouble; orderly, soundly, and agreeably. A man might\nhave applied that to him, which is recorded of Socrates, that he knew\nhow to want, and to enjoy those things, in the want whereof, most men\nshow themselves weak; and in the fruition, intemperate: but to hold out\nfirm and constant, and to keep within the compass of true moderation and\nsobriety in either estate, is proper to a man, who hath a perfect and\ninvincible soul; such as he showed himself in the sickness of Maximus.\nXIV. From the gods I received that I had good grandfathers, and parents,\na good sister, good masters, good domestics, loving kinsmen, almost all\nthat I have; and that I never through haste and rashness transgressed\nagainst any of them, notwithstanding that my disposition was such,\nas that such a thing (if occasion had been) might very well have been\ncommitted by me, but that It was the mercy of the gods, to prevent such\na concurring of matters and occasions, as might make me to incur this\nblame. That I was not long brought up by the concubine of my father;\nthat I preserved the flower of my youth. That I took not upon me to be\na man before my time, but rather put it off longer than I needed. That\nI lived under the government of my lord and father, who would take\naway from me all pride and vainglory, and reduce me to that conceit and\nopinion that it was not impossible for a prince to live in the court\nwithout a troop of guards and followers, extraordinary apparel, such\nand such torches and statues, and other like particulars of state and\nmagnificence; but that a man may reduce and contract himself almost to\nthe state of a private man, and yet for all that not to become the more\nbase and remiss in those public matters and affairs, wherein power and\nauthority is requisite. That I have had such a brother, who by his own\nexample might stir me up to think of myself; and by his respect and\nlove, delight and please me. That I have got ingenuous children, and\nthat they were not born distorted, nor with any other natural deformity.\nThat I was no great proficient in the study of rhetoric and poetry, and\nof other faculties, which perchance I might have dwelt upon, if I had\nfound myself to go on in them with success. That I did by times prefer\nthose, by whom I was brought up, to such places and dignities, which\nthey seemed unto me most to desire; and that I did not put them off with\nhope and expectation, that (since that they were yet but young) I would\ndo the same hereafter. That I ever knew Apollonius and Rusticus, and\nMaximus. That I have had occasion often and effectually to consider and\nmeditate with myself, concerning that life which is according to nature,\nwhat the nature and manner of it is: so that as for the gods and such\nsuggestions, helps and inspirations, as might be expected from them,\nnothing did hinder, but that I might have begun long before to live\naccording to nature; or that even now that I was not yet partaker and\nin present possession of that life, that I myself (in that I did not\nobserve those inward motions, and suggestions, yea and almost plain and\napparent instructions and admonitions of the gods,) was the only cause\nof it. That my body in such a life, hath been able to hold out so long.\nThat I never had to do with Benedicta and Theodotus, yea and afterwards\nwhen I fell into some fits of love, I was soon cured. That having been\noften displeased with Rusticus, I never did him anything for which\nafterwards I had occasion to repent. That it being so that my mother was\nto die young, yet she lived with me all her latter years. That as often\nas I had a purpose to help and succour any that either were poor, or\nfallen into some present necessity, I never was answered by my officers\nthat there was not ready money enough to do it; and that I myself never\nhad occasion to require the like succour from any other. That I have\nsuch a wife, so obedient, so loving, so ingenuous. That I had choice of\nfit and able men, to whom I might commit the bringing up of my children.\nThat by dreams I have received help, as for other things, so in\nparticular, how I might stay my casting of blood, and cure my dizziness,\nas that also that happened to thee in Cajeta, as unto Chryses when he\nprayed by the seashore. And when I did first apply myself to philosophy,\nthat I did not fall into the hands of some sophists, or spent my time\neither in reading the manifold volumes of ordinary philosophers, nor in\npractising myself in the solution of arguments and fallacies, nor dwelt\nupon the studies of the meteors, and other natural curiosities. All\nthese things without the assistance of the gods, and fortune, could not\nhave been.\nXV. In the country of the Quadi at Granua, these. Betimes in the morning\nsay to thyself, This day I shalt have to do with an idle curious man,\nwith an unthankful man, a railer, a crafty, false, or an envious man; an\nunsociable uncharitable man. All these ill qualities have happened unto\nthem, through ignorance of that which is truly good and truly bad. But I\nthat understand the nature of that which is good, that it only is to\nbe desired, and of that which is bad, that it only is truly odious and\nshameful: who know moreover, that this transgressor, whosoever he be, is\nmy kinsman, not by the same blood and seed, but by participation of the\nsame reason, and of the same divine particle; How can I either be\nhurt by any of those, since it is not in their power to make me incur\nanything that is truly reproachful? or angry, and ill affected towards\nhim, who by nature is so near unto me? for we are all born to be\nfellow-workers, as the feet, the hands, and the eyelids; as the rows of\nthe upper and under teeth: for such therefore to be in opposition, is\nagainst nature; and what is it to chafe at, and to be averse from, but\nto be in opposition?\nXVI. Whatsoever I am, is either flesh, or life, or that which we\ncommonly call the mistress and overruling part of man; reason. Away with\nthy books, suffer not thy mind any more to be distracted, and carried to\nand fro; for it will not be; but as even now ready to die, think little\nof thy flesh: blood, bones, and a skin; a pretty piece of knit and\ntwisted work, consisting of nerves, veins and arteries; think no more of\nit, than so. And as for thy life, consider what it is; a wind; not one\nconstant wind neither, but every moment of an hour let out, and sucked\nin again. The third, is thy ruling part; and here consider; Thou art an\nold man; suffer not that excellent part to be brought in subjection, and\nto become slavish: suffer it not to be drawn up and down with\nunreasonable and unsociable lusts and motions, as it were with wires and\nnerves; suffer it not any more, either to repine at anything now\npresent, or to fear and fly anything to come, which the destiny hath\nappointed thee.\nXVII. Whatsoever proceeds from the gods immediately, that any man will\ngrant totally depends from their divine providence. As for those\nthings that are commonly said to happen by fortune, even those must be\nconceived to have dependence from nature, or from that first and general\nconnection, and concatenation of all those things, which more apparently\nby the divine providence are administered and brought to pass.\nAll things flow from thence: and whatsoever it is that is, is both\nnecessary, and conducing to the whole (part of which thou art), and\nwhatsoever it is that is requisite and necessary for the preservation of\nthe general, must of necessity for every particular nature, be good and\nbehoveful. And as for the whole, it is preserved, as by the perpetual\nmutation and conversion of the simple elements one into another, so\nalso by the mutation, and alteration of things mixed and compounded. Let\nthese things suffice thee; let them be always unto thee, as thy general\nrules and precepts. As for thy thirst after books, away with it with all\nspeed, that thou die not murmuring and complaining, but truly meek and\nwell satisfied, and from thy heart thankful unto the gods.\nTHE SECOND BOOK\nI. Remember how long thou hast already put off these things, and how\noften a certain day and hour as it were, having been set unto thee by\nthe gods, thou hast neglected it. It is high time for thee to understand\nthe true nature both of the world, whereof thou art a part; and of that\nLord and Governor of the world, from whom, as a channel from the spring,\nthou thyself didst flow: and that there is but a certain limit of time\nappointed unto thee, which if thou shalt not make use of to calm and\nallay the many distempers of thy soul, it will pass away and thou with\nit, and never after return.\nII. Let it be thy earnest and incessant care as a Roman and a man to\nperform whatsoever it is that thou art about, with true and unfeigned\ngravity, natural affection, freedom and justice: and as for all other\ncares, and imaginations, how thou mayest ease thy mind of them. Which\nthou shalt do; if thou shalt go about every action as thy last action,\nfree from all vanity, all passionate and wilful aberration from reason,\nand from all hypocrisy, and self-love, and dislike of those things,\nwhich by the fates or appointment of God have happened unto thee. Thou\nseest that those things, which for a man to hold on in a prosperous\ncourse, and to live a divine life, are requisite and necessary, are not\nmany, for the gods will require no more of any man, that shall but keep\nand observe these things.\nIII. Do, soul, do; abuse and contemn thyself; yet a while and the time\nfor thee to respect thyself, will be at an end. Every man's happiness\ndepends from himself, but behold thy life is almost at an end, whiles\naffording thyself no respect, thou dost make thy happiness to consist in\nthe souls, and conceits of other men.\nIV. Why should any of these things that happen externally, so much\ndistract thee? Give thyself leisure to learn some good thing, and cease\nroving and wandering to and fro. Thou must also take heed of another\nkind of wandering, for they are idle in their actions, who toil and\nlabour in this life, and have no certain scope to which to direct all\ntheir motions, and desires. V. For not observing the state of another\nman's soul, scarce was ever any man known to be unhappy. Tell whosoever\nthey be that intend not, and guide not by reason and discretion the\nmotions of their own souls, they must of necessity be unhappy.\nVI. These things thou must always have in mind: What is the nature\nof the universe, and what is mine--in particular: This unto that what\nrelation it hath: what kind of part, of what kind of universe it is: And\nthat there is nobody that can hinder thee, but that thou mayest always\nboth do and speak those things which are agreeable to that nature,\nwhereof thou art a part.\nVII. Theophrastus, where he compares sin with sin (as after a vulgar\nsense such things I grant may be compared:) says well and like a\nphilosopher, that those sins are greater which are committed through\nlust, than those which are committed through anger. For he that is angry\nseems with a kind of grief and close contraction of himself, to turn\naway from reason; but he that sins through lust, being overcome by\npleasure, doth in his very sin bewray a more impotent, and unmanlike\ndisposition. Well then and like a philosopher doth he say, that he of\nthe two is the more to be condemned, that sins with pleasure, than he\nthat sins with grief. For indeed this latter may seem first to have been\nwronged, and so in some manner through grief thereof to have been forced\nto be angry, whereas he who through lust doth commit anything, did of\nhimself merely resolve upon that action.\nVIII. Whatsoever thou dost affect, whatsoever thou dost project, so do,\nand so project all, as one who, for aught thou knowest, may at this very\npresent depart out of this life. And as for death, if there be any gods,\nit is no grievous thing to leave the society of men. The gods will do\nthee no hurt, thou mayest be sure. But if it be so that there be no\ngods, or that they take no care of the world, why should I desire to\nlive in a world void of gods, and of all divine providence? But gods\nthere be certainly, and they take care for the world; and as for those\nthings which be truly evil, as vice and wickedness, such things they\nhave put in a man's own power, that he might avoid them if he would: and\nhad there been anything besides that had been truly bad and evil, they\nwould have had a care of that also, that a man might have avoided it.\nBut why should that be thought to hurt and prejudice a man's life in\nthis world, which cannot any ways make man himself the better, or the\nworse in his own person? Neither must we think that the nature of the\nuniverse did either through ignorance pass these things, or if not as\nignorant of them, yet as unable either to prevent, or better to order\nand dispose them. It cannot be that she through want either of power or\nskill, should have committed such a thing, so as to suffer all things\nboth good and bad, equally and promiscuously, to happen unto all both\ngood and bad. As for life therefore, and death, honour and dishonour,\nlabour and pleasure, riches and poverty, all these things happen\nunto men indeed, both good and bad, equally; but as things which of\nthemselves are neither good nor bad; because of themselves, neither\nshameful nor praiseworthy.\nIX. Consider how quickly all things are dissolved and resolved: the\nbodies and substances themselves, into the matter and substance of the\nworld: and their memories into the general age and time of the world.\nConsider the nature of all worldly sensible things; of those especially,\nwhich either ensnare by pleasure, or for their irksomeness are dreadful,\nor for their outward lustre and show are in great esteem and request,\nhow vile and contemptible, how base and corruptible, how destitute of\nall true life and being they are.\nX. It is the part of a man endowed with a good understanding faculty, to\nconsider what they themselves are in very deed, from whose bare conceits\nand voices, honour and credit do proceed: as also what it is to die, and\nhow if a man shall consider this by itself alone, to die, and separate\nfrom it in his mind all those things which with it usually represent\nthemselves unto us, he can conceive of it no otherwise, than as of a\nwork of nature, and he that fears any work of nature, is a very child.\nNow death, it is not only a work of nature, but also conducing to\nnature.\nXI. Consider with thyself how man, and by what part of his, is joined\nunto God, and how that part of man is affected, when it is said to be\ndiffused. There is nothing more wretched than that soul, which in a kind\nof circuit compasseth all things, searching (as he saith) even the very\ndepths of the earth; and by all signs and conjectures prying into the\nvery thoughts of other men's souls; and yet of this, is not sensible,\nthat it is sufficient for a man to apply himself wholly, and to confine\nall his thoughts and cares to the tendance of that spirit which is\nwithin him, and truly and really to serve him. His service doth consist\nin this, that a man keep himself pure from all violent passion and\nevil affection, from all rashness and vanity, and from all manner of\ndiscontent, either in regard of the gods or men. For indeed whatsoever\nproceeds from the gods, deserves respect for their worth and excellency;\nand whatsoever proceeds from men, as they are our kinsmen, should by us\nbe entertained, with love, always; sometimes, as proceeding from their\nignorance, of that which is truly good and bad, (a blindness no less,\nthan that by which we are not able to discern between white and black:)\nwith a kind of pity and compassion also.\nXII. If thou shouldst live three thousand, or as many as ten thousands\nof years, yet remember this, that man can part with no life properly,\nsave with that little part of life, which he now lives: and that which\nhe lives, is no other, than that which at every instant he parts with.\nThat then which is longest of duration, and that which is shortest, come\nboth to one effect. For although in regard of that which is already past\nthere may be some inequality, yet that time which is now present and\nin being, is equal unto all men. And that being it which we part with\nwhensoever we die, it doth manifestly appear, that it can be but a\nmoment of time, that we then part with. For as for that which is either\npast or to come, a man cannot be said properly to part with it. For\nhow should a man part with that which he hath not? These two things\ntherefore thou must remember. First, that all things in the world from\nall eternity, by a perpetual revolution of the same times and things\never continued and renewed, are of one kind and nature; so that whether\nfor a hundred or two hundred years only, or for an infinite space of\ntime, a man see those things which are still the same, it can be no\nmatter of great moment. And secondly, that that life which any the\nlongest liver, or the shortest liver parts with, is for length and\nduration the very same, for that only which is present, is that, which\neither of them can lose, as being that only which they have; for that\nwhich he hath not, no man can truly be said to lose.\nXIII. Remember that all is but opinion and conceit, for those things\nare plain and apparent, which were spoken unto Monimus the Cynic; and as\nplain and apparent is the use that may be made of those things, if that\nwhich is true and serious in them, be received as well as that which is\nsweet and pleasing.\nXIV. A man's soul doth wrong and disrespect itself first and especially,\nwhen as much as in itself lies it becomes an aposteme, and as it were an\nexcrescency of the world, for to be grieved and displeased with anything\nthat happens in the world, is direct apostacy from the nature of the\nuniverse; part of which, all particular natures of the world, are.\nSecondly, when she either is averse from any man, or led by contrary\ndesires or affections, tending to his hurt and prejudice; such as are\nthe souls of them that are angry. Thirdly, when she is overcome by any\npleasure or pain. Fourthly, when she doth dissemble, and covertly and\nfalsely either doth or saith anything. Fifthly, when she doth either\naffect or endeavour anything to no certain end, but rashly and without\ndue ratiocination and consideration, how consequent or inconsequent it\nis to the common end. For even the least things ought not to be done,\nwithout relation unto the end; and the end of the reasonable creatures\nis, to follow and obey him, who is the reason as it were, and the law of\nthis great city, and ancient commonwealth.\nXV. The time of a man's life is as a point; the substance of it ever\nflowing, the sense obscure; and the whole composition of the body\ntending to corruption. His soul is restless, fortune uncertain, and fame\ndoubtful; to be brief, as a stream so are all things belonging to the\nbody; as a dream, or as a smoke, so are all that belong unto the soul.\nOur life is a warfare, and a mere pilgrimage. Fame after life is no\nbetter than oblivion. What is it then that will adhere and follow? Only\none thing, philosophy. And philosophy doth consist in this, for a man to\npreserve that spirit which is within him, from all manner of contumelies\nand injuries, and above all pains or pleasures; never to do anything\neither rashly, or feignedly, or hypocritically: wholly to depend from\nhimself and his own proper actions: all things that happen unto him to\nembrace contentedly, as coming from Him from whom he himself also came;\nand above all things, with all meekness and a calm cheerfulness, to\nexpect death, as being nothing else but the resolution of those\nelements, of which every creature is composed. And if the elements\nthemselves suffer nothing by this their perpetual conversion of one into\nanother, that dissolution, and alteration, which is so common unto all,\nwhy should it be feared by any? Is not this according to nature? But\nnothing that is according to nature can be evil.\n_Whilst I was at Carnuntum._\nTHE THIRD BOOK\nI. A man must not only consider how daily his life wasteth and\ndecreaseth, but this also, that if he live long, he cannot be certain,\nwhether his understanding shall continue so able and sufficient,\nfor either discreet consideration, in matter of businesses; or for\ncontemplation: it being the thing, whereon true knowledge of things both\ndivine and human, doth depend. For if once he shall begin to dote,\nhis respiration, nutrition, his imaginative, and appetitive, and other\nnatural faculties, may still continue the same: he shall find no want of\nthem. But how to make that right use of himself that he should, how\nto observe exactly in all things that which is right and just, how to\nredress and rectify all wrong, or sudden apprehensions and imaginations,\nand even of this particular, whether he should live any longer or no, to\nconsider duly; for all such things, wherein the best strength and vigour\nof the mind is most requisite; his power and ability will be past and\ngone. Thou must hasten therefore; not only because thou art every day\nnearer unto death than other, but also because that intellective faculty\nin thee, whereby thou art enabled to know the true nature of things, and\nto order all thy actions by that knowledge, doth daily waste and decay:\nor, may fail thee before thou die.\nII. This also thou must observe, that whatsoever it is that naturally\ndoth happen to things natural, hath somewhat in itself that is pleasing\nand delightful: as a great loaf when it is baked, some parts of it\ncleave as it were, and part asunder, and make the crust of it rugged and\nunequal, and yet those parts of it, though in some sort it be against\nthe art and intention of baking itself, that they are thus cleft and\nparted, which should have been and were first made all even and uniform,\nthey become it well nevertheless, and have a certain peculiar property,\nto stir the appetite. So figs are accounted fairest and ripest then,\nwhen they begin to shrink, and wither as it were. So ripe olives, when\nthey are next to putrefaction, then are they in their proper beauty. The\nhanging down of grapes--the brow of a lion, the froth of a foaming wild\nboar, and many other like things, though by themselves considered, they\nare far from any beauty, yet because they happen naturally, they both\nare comely, and delightful; so that if a man shall with a profound mind\nand apprehension, consider all things in the world, even among all those\nthings which are but mere accessories and natural appendices as it were,\nthere will scarce appear anything unto him, wherein he will not find\nmatter of pleasure and delight. So will he behold with as much pleasure\nthe true _rictus_ of wild beasts, as those which by skilful painters and\nother artificers are imitated. So will he be able to perceive the proper\nripeness and beauty of old age, whether in man or woman: and whatsoever\nelse it is that is beautiful and alluring in whatsoever is, with chaste\nand continent eyes he will soon find out and discern. Those and many\nother things will he discern, not credible unto every one, but unto them\nonly who are truly and familiarly acquainted, both with nature itself,\nand all natural things.\nIII. Hippocrates having cured many sicknesses, fell sick himself and\ndied. The Chaldeans and Astrologians having foretold the deaths of\ndivers, were afterwards themselves surprised by the fates. Alexander and\nPompeius, and Caius C\u00e6sar, having destroyed so many towns, and cut\noff in the field so many thousands both of horse and foot, yet they\nthemselves at last were fain to part with their own lives. Heraclitus\nhaving written so many natural tracts concerning the last and general\nconflagration of the world, died afterwards all filled with water\nwithin, and all bedaubed with dirt and dung without. Lice killed\nDemocritus; and Socrates, another sort of vermin, wicked ungodly men.\nHow then stands the case? Thou hast taken ship, thou hast sailed, thou\nart come to land, go out, if to another life, there also shalt thou find\ngods, who are everywhere. If all life and sense shall cease, then shalt\nthou cease also to be subject to either pains or pleasures; and to serve\nand tend this vile cottage; so much the viler, by how much that which\nministers unto it doth excel; the one being a rational substance, and a\nspirit, the other nothing but earth and blood.\nIV. Spend not the remnant of thy days in thoughts and fancies concerning\nother men, when it is not in relation to some common good, when by it\nthou art hindered from some other better work. That is, spend not thy\ntime in thinking, what such a man doth, and to what end: what he saith,\nand what he thinks, and what he is about, and such other things or\ncuriosities, which make a man to rove and wander from the care and\nobservation of that part of himself, which is rational, and overruling.\nSee therefore in the whole series and connection of thy thoughts, that\nthou be careful to prevent whatsoever is idle and impertinent: but\nespecially, whatsoever is curious and malicious: and thou must use\nthyself to think only of such things, of which if a man upon a sudden\nshould ask thee, what it is that thou art now thinking, thou mayest\nanswer This, and That, freely and boldly, that so by thy thoughts it may\npresently appear that in all thee is sincere, and peaceable; as becometh\none that is made for society, and regards not pleasures, nor gives way\nto any voluptuous imaginations at all: free from all contentiousness,\nenvy, and suspicion, and from whatsoever else thou wouldest blush to\nconfess thy thoughts were set upon. He that is such, is he surely that\ndoth not put off to lay hold on that which is best indeed, a very priest\nand minister of the gods, well acquainted and in good correspondence\nwith him especially that is seated and placed within himself, as in\na temple and sacrary: to whom also he keeps and preserves himself\nunspotted by pleasure, undaunted by pain; free from any manner of wrong,\nor contumely, by himself offered unto himself: not capable of any evil\nfrom others: a wrestler of the best sort, and for the highest prize,\nthat he may not be cast down by any passion or affection of his own;\ndeeply dyed and drenched in righteousness, embracing and accepting with\nhis whole heart whatsoever either happeneth or is allotted unto him. One\nwho not often, nor without some great necessity tending to some public\ngood, mindeth what any other, either speaks, or doth, or purposeth: for\nthose things only that are in his own power, or that are truly his own,\nare the objects of his employments, and his thoughts are ever taken\nup with those things, which of the whole universe are by the fates or\nProvidence destinated and appropriated unto himself. Those things that\nare his own, and in his own power, he himself takes order, for that they\nbe good: and as for those that happen unto him, he believes them to be\nso. For that lot and portion which is assigned to every one, as it is\nunavoidable and necessary, so is it always profitable. He remembers\nbesides that whatsoever partakes of reason, is akin unto him, and that\nto care for all men generally, is agreeing to the nature of a man: but\nas for honour and praise, that they ought not generally to be admitted\nand accepted of from all, but from such only, who live according to\nnature. As for them that do not, what manner of men they be at home,\nor abroad; day or night, how conditioned themselves with what manner of\nconditions, or with men of what conditions they moil and pass away\nthe time together, he knoweth, and remembers right well, he therefore\nregards not such praise and approbation, as proceeding from them, who\ncannot like and approve themselves.\nV. Do nothing against thy will, nor contrary to the community, nor\nwithout due examination, nor with reluctancy. Affect not to set out thy\nthoughts with curious neat language. Be neither a great talker, nor a\ngreat undertaker. Moreover, let thy God that is in thee to rule over\nthee, find by thee, that he hath to do with a man; an aged man; a\nsociable man; a Roman; a prince; one that hath ordered his life, as\none that expecteth, as it were, nothing but the sound of the trumpet,\nsounding a retreat to depart out of this life with all expedition. One\nwho for his word or actions neither needs an oath, nor any man to be a\nwitness.\nVI. To be cheerful, and to stand in no need, either of other men's help\nor attendance, or of that rest and tranquillity, which thou must be\nbeholding to others for. Rather like one that is straight of himself, or\nhath ever been straight, than one that hath been rectified.\nVII. If thou shalt find anything in this mortal life better than\nrighteousness, than truth, temperance, fortitude, and in general better\nthan a mind contented both with those things which according to right\nand reason she doth, and in those, which without her will and knowledge\nhappen unto thee by the providence; if I say, thou canst find out\nanything better than this, apply thyself unto it with thy whole heart,\nand that which is best wheresoever thou dost find it, enjoy freely. But\nif nothing thou shalt find worthy to be preferred to that spirit which\nis within thee; if nothing better than to subject unto thee thine own\nlusts and desires, and not to give way to any fancies or imaginations\nbefore thou hast duly considered of them, nothing better than to\nwithdraw thyself (to use Socrates his words) from all sensuality, and\nsubmit thyself unto the gods, and to have care of all men in general: if\nthou shalt find that all other things in comparison of this, are but\nvile, and of little moment; then give not way to any other thing, which\nbeing once though but affected and inclined unto, it will no more be in\nthy power without all distraction as thou oughtest to prefer and to\npursue after that good, which is thine own and thy proper good. For it\nis not lawful, that anything that is of another and inferior kind and\nnature, be it what it will, as either popular applause, or honour, or\nriches, or pleasures; should be suffered to confront and contest as it\nwere, with that which is rational, and operatively good. For all these\nthings, if once though but for a while, they begin to please, they\npresently prevail, and pervert a man's mind, or turn a man from the\nright way. Do thou therefore I say absolutely and freely make choice of\nthat which is best, and stick unto it. Now, that they say is best, which\nis most profitable. If they mean profitable to man as he is a rational\nman, stand thou to it, and maintain it; but if they mean profitable, as\nhe is a creature, only reject it; and from this thy tenet and conclusion\nkeep off carefully all plausible shows and colours of external\nappearance, that thou mayest be able to discern things rightly.\nVIII. Never esteem of anything as profitable, which shall ever constrain\nthee either to break thy faith, or to lose thy modesty; to hate any man,\nto suspect, to curse, to dissemble, to lust after anything, that\nrequireth the secret of walls or veils. But he that preferreth before\nall things his rational part and spirit, and the sacred mysteries of\nvirtue which issueth from it, he shall never lament and exclaim, never\nsigh; he shall never want either solitude or company: and which is\nchiefest of all, he shall live without either desire or fear. And as for\nlife, whether for a long or short time he shall enjoy his soul thus\ncompassed about with a body, he is altogether indifferent. For if even\nnow he were to depart, he is as ready for it, as for any other action,\nwhich may be performed with modesty and decency. For all his life long,\nthis is his only care, that his mind may always be occupied in such\nintentions and objects, as are proper to a rational sociable creature.\nIX. In the mind that is once truly disciplined and purged, thou canst\nnot find anything, either foul or impure, or as it were festered:\nnothing that is either servile, or affected: no partial tie; no\nmalicious averseness; nothing obnoxious; nothing concealed. The life of\nsuch an one, death can never surprise as imperfect; as of an actor, that\nshould die before he had ended, or the play itself were at an end, a man\nmight speak.\nX. Use thine opinative faculty with all honour and respect, for in\nher indeed is all: that thy opinion do not beget in thy understanding\nanything contrary to either nature, or the proper constitution of a\nrational creature. The end and object of a rational constitution is, to\ndo nothing rashly, to be kindly affected towards men, and in all things\nwillingly to submit unto the gods. Casting therefore all other things\naside, keep thyself to these few, and remember withal that no man\nproperly can be said to live more than that which is now present, which\nis but a moment of time. Whatsoever is besides either is already past,\nor uncertain. The time therefore that any man doth live, is but a\nlittle, and the place where he liveth, is but a very little corner of\nthe earth, and the greatest fame that can remain of a man after his\ndeath, even that is but little, and that too, such as it is whilst it\nis, is by the succession of silly mortal men preserved, who likewise\nshall shortly die, and even whiles they live know not what in very deed\nthey themselves are: and much less can know one, who long before is dead\nand gone.\nXI. To these ever-present helps and mementoes, let one more be added,\never to make a particular description and delineation as it were of\nevery object that presents itself to thy mind, that thou mayest wholly\nand throughly contemplate it, in its own proper nature, bare and naked;\nwholly, and severally; divided into its several parts and quarters: and\nthen by thyself in thy mind, to call both it, and those things of which\nit doth consist, and in which it shall be resolved, by their own proper\ntrue names, and appellations. For there is nothing so effectual to beget\ntrue magnanimity, as to be able truly and methodically to examine and\nconsider all things that happen in this life, and so to penetrate\ninto their natures, that at the same time, this also may concur in our\napprehensions: what is the true use of it? and what is the true nature\nof this universe, to which it is useful? how much in regard of the\nuniverse may it be esteemed? how much in regard of man, a citizen of the\nsupreme city, of which all other cities in the world are as it were but\nhouses and families?\nXII. What is this, that now my fancy is set upon? of what things doth\nit consist? how long can it last? which of all the virtues is the proper\nvirtue for this present use? as whether meekness, fortitude, truth,\nfaith, sincerity, contentation, or any of the rest? Of everything\ntherefore thou must use thyself to say, This immediately comes from God,\nthis by that fatal connection, and concatenation of things, or (which\nalmost comes to one) by some coincidental casualty. And as for this, it\nproceeds from my neighbour, my kinsman, my fellow: through his ignorance\nindeed, because he knows not what is truly natural unto him: but I know\nit, and therefore carry myself towards him according to the natural law\nof fellowship; that is kindly, and justly. As for those things that of\nthemselves are altogether indifferent, as in my best judgment I conceive\neverything to deserve more or less, so I carry myself towards it.\nXIII. If thou shalt intend that which is present, following the rule of\nright and reason carefully, solidly, meekly, and shalt not intermix\nany other businesses, but shall study this only to preserve thy spirit\nunpolluted, and pure, and shall cleave unto him without either hope\nor fear of anything, in all things that thou shalt either do or speak,\ncontenting thyself with heroical truth, thou shalt live happily; and\nfrom this, there is no man that can hinder thee.\nXIV. As physicians and chirurgeons have always their instruments ready\nat hand for all sudden cures; so have thou always thy dogmata in a\nreadiness for the knowledge of things, both divine and human: and\nwhatsoever thou dost, even in the smallest things that thou dost, thou\nmust ever remember that mutual relation, and connection that is between\nthese two things divine, and things human. For without relation unto\nGod, thou shalt never speed in any worldly actions; nor on the other\nside in any divine, without some respect had to things human.\nXV. Be not deceived; for thou shalt never live to read thy moral\ncommentaries, nor the acts of the famous Romans and Grecians; nor those\nexcerpta from several books; all which thou hadst provided and laid\nup for thyself against thine old age. Hasten therefore to an end, and\ngiving over all vain hopes, help thyself in time if thou carest for\nthyself, as thou oughtest to do.\nXVI. To steal, to sow, to buy, to be at rest, to see what is to be done\n(which is not seen by the eyes, but by another kind of sight:) what\nthese words mean, and how many ways to be understood, they do not\nunderstand. The body, the soul, the understanding. As the senses\nnaturally belong to the body, and the desires and affections to the\nsoul, so do the dogmata to the understanding.\nXVII. To be capable of fancies and imaginations, is common to man and\nbeast. To be violently drawn and moved by the lusts and desires of the\nsoul, is proper to wild beasts and monsters, such as Phalaris and Nero\nwere. To follow reason for ordinary duties and actions is common to them\nalso, who believe not that there be any gods, and for their advantage\nwould make no conscience to betray their own country; and who when once\nthe doors be shut upon them, dare do anything. If therefore all things\nelse be common to these likewise, it follows, that for a man to like and\nembrace all things that happen and are destinated unto him, and not to\ntrouble and molest that spirit which is seated in the temple of his own\nbreast, with a multitude of vain fancies and imaginations, but to keep\nhim propitious and to obey him as a god, never either speaking anything\ncontrary to truth, or doing anything contrary to justice, is the only\ntrue property of a good man. And such a one, though no man should\nbelieve that he liveth as he doth, either sincerely and conscionably,\nor cheerful and contentedly; yet is he neither with any man at all angry\nfor it, nor diverted by it from the way that leadeth to the end of his\nlife, through which a man must pass pure, ever ready to depart, and\nwilling of himself without any compulsion to fit and accommodate himself\nto his proper lot and portion.\nTHE FOURTH BOOK\nI. That inward mistress part of man if it be in its own true natural\ntemper, is towards all worldly chances and events ever so disposed and\naffected, that it will easily turn and apply itself to that which may\nbe, and is within its own power to compass, when that cannot be which at\nfirst it intended. For it never doth absolutely addict and apply itself\nto any one object, but whatsoever it is that it doth now intend and\nprosecute, it doth prosecute it with exception and reservation; so that\nwhatsoever it is that falls out contrary to its first intentions, even\nthat afterwards it makes its proper object. Even as the fire when it\nprevails upon those things that are in his way; by which things indeed a\nlittle fire would have been quenched, but a great fire doth soon turn to\nits own nature, and so consume whatsoever comes in his way: yea by those\nvery things it is made greater and greater.\nII. Let nothing be done rashly, and at random, but all things according\nto the most exact and perfect rules of art.\nIII. They seek for themselves private retiring\nplaces, as country villages, the sea-shore, mountains; yea thou thyself\nart wont to long much after such places. But all this thou must know\nproceeds from simplicity in the highest degree. At what time soever thou\nwilt, it is in thy power to retire into thyself, and to be at rest, and\nfree from all businesses. A man cannot any whither retire better than\nto his own soul; he especially who is beforehand provided of such\nthings within, which whensoever he doth withdraw himself to look in, may\npresently afford unto him perfect ease and tranquillity. By tranquillity\nI understand a decent orderly disposition and carriage, free from\nall confusion and tumultuousness. Afford then thyself this retiring\ncontinually, and thereby refresh and renew thyself. Let these precepts\nbe brief and fundamental, which as soon as thou dost call them to mind,\nmay suffice thee to purge thy soul throughly, and to send thee away well\npleased with those things whatsoever they be, which now again after this\nshort withdrawing of thy soul into herself thou dost return unto. For\nwhat is it that thou art offended at? Can it be at the wickedness of\nmen, when thou dost call to mind this conclusion, that all reasonable\ncreatures are made one for another? and that it is part of justice to\nbear with them? and that it is against their wills that they offend?\nand how many already, who once likewise prosecuted their enmities,\nsuspected, hated, and fiercely contended, are now long ago stretched\nout, and reduced unto ashes? It is time for thee to make an end. As for\nthose things which among the common chances of the world happen unto\nthee as thy particular lot and portion, canst thou be displeased with\nany of them, when thou dost call that our ordinary dilemma to mind,\neither a providence, or Democritus his atoms; and with it, whatsoever we\nbrought to prove that the whole world is as it were one city? And as for\nthy body, what canst thou fear, if thou dost consider that thy mind and\nunderstanding, when once it hath recollected itself, and knows its own\npower, hath in this life and breath (whether it run smoothly and gently,\nor whether harshly and rudely), no interest at all, but is altogether\nindifferent: and whatsoever else thou hast heard and assented unto\nconcerning either pain or pleasure? But the care of thine honour and\nreputation will perchance distract thee? How can that be, if thou\ndost look back, and consider both how quickly all things that are, are\nforgotten, and what an immense chaos of eternity was before, and will\nfollow after all things: and the vanity of praise, and the inconstancy\nand variableness of human judgments and opinions, and the narrowness of\nthe place, wherein it is limited and circumscribed? For the whole earth\nis but as one point; and of it, this inhabited part of it, is but a very\nlittle part; and of this part, how many in number, and what manner of\nmen are they, that will commend thee? What remains then, but that thou\noften put in practice this kind of retiring of thyself, to this little\npart of thyself; and above all things, keep thyself from distraction,\nand intend not anything vehemently, but be free and consider all things,\nas a man whose proper object is Virtue, as a man whose true nature is\nto be kind and sociable, as a citizen, as a mortal creature. Among\nother things, which to consider, and look into thou must use to withdraw\nthyself, let those two be among the most obvious and at hand. One, that\nthe things or objects themselves reach not unto the soul, but stand\nwithout still and quiet, and that it is from the opinion only which is\nwithin, that all the tumult and all the trouble doth proceed. The next,\nthat all these things, which now thou seest, shall within a very little\nwhile be changed, and be no more: and ever call to mind, how many\nchanges and alterations in the world thou thyself hast already been an\neyewitness of in thy time. This world is mere change, and this life,\nopinion.\nIV. If to understand and to be reasonable be common unto all men, then\nis that reason, for which we are termed reasonable, common unto all. If\nreason is general, then is that reason also, which prescribeth what is\nto be done and what not, common unto all. If that, then law. If law,\nthen are we fellow-citizens. If so, then are we partners in some one\ncommonweal. If so, then the world is as it were a city. For which other\ncommonweal is it, that all men can be said to be members of? From this\ncommon city it is, that understanding, reason, and law is derived unto\nus, for from whence else? For as that which in me is earthly I have from\nsome common earth; and that which is moist from some other element is\nimparted; as my breath and life hath its proper fountain; and that\nlikewise which is dry and fiery in me: (for there is nothing which doth\nnot proceed from something; as also there is nothing that can be reduced\nunto mere nothing:) so also is there some common beginning from whence\nmy understanding hath proceeded.\nV. As generation is, so also death, a secret of nature's wisdom: a\nmixture of elements, resolved into the same elements again, a thing\nsurely which no man ought to be ashamed of: in a series of other fatal\nevents and consequences, which a rational creature is subject unto,\nnot improper or incongruous, nor contrary to the natural and proper\nconstitution of man himself.\nVI. Such and such things, from such and such causes, must of necessity\nproceed. He that would not have such things to happen, is as he that\nwould have the fig-tree grow without any sap or moisture. In sum,\nremember this, that within a very little while, both thou and he shall\nboth be dead, and after a little while more, not so much as your names\nand memories shall be remaining.\nVII. Let opinion be taken away, and no man will think himself wronged.\nIf no man shall think himself wronged, then is there no more any such\nthing as wrong. That which makes not man himself the worse, cannot\nmake his life the worse, neither can it hurt him either inwardly\nor outwardly. It was expedient in nature that it should be so, and\ntherefore necessary.\nVIII. Whatsoever doth happen in the world, doth happen justly, and so if\nthou dost well take heed, thou shalt find it. I say not only in right\norder by a series of inevitable consequences, but according to justice\nand as it were by way of equal distribution, according to the true worth\nof everything. Continue then to take notice of it, as thou hast begun,\nand whatsoever thou dost, do it not without this proviso, that it be a\nthing of that nature that a good man (as the word good is properly\ntaken) may do it. This observe carefully in every action.\nIX. Conceit no such things, as he that wrongeth thee conceiveth,\nor would have thee to conceive, but look into the matter itself, and see\nwhat it is in very truth.\nX. These two rules, thou must have always in a readiness. First, do\nnothing at all, but what reason proceeding from that regal and supreme\npart, shall for the good and benefit of men, suggest unto thee. And\nsecondly, if any man that is present shall be able to rectify thee or to\nturn thee from some erroneous persuasion, that thou be always ready to\nchange thy mind, and this change to proceed, not from any respect of any\npleasure or credit thereon depending, but always from some probable\napparent ground of justice, or of some public good thereby to be\nfurthered; or from some other such inducement.\nXI. Hast thou reason? I have. Why then makest thou not use of it? For if\nthy reason do her part, what more canst thou require?\nXII. As a part hitherto thou hast had a particular subsistence: and now\nshalt thou vanish away into the common substance of Him, who first begot\nthee, or rather thou shalt be resumed again into that original rational\nsubstance, out of which all others have issued, and are propagated.\nMany small pieces of frankincense are set upon the same altar, one drops\nfirst and is consumed, another after; and it comes all to one.\nXIII. Within ten days, if so happen, thou shalt be esteemed a god of\nthem, who now if thou shalt return to the dogmata and to the honouring\nof reason, will esteem of thee no better than of a mere brute, and of an\nape.\nXIV. Not as though thou hadst thousands of years to live. Death hangs\nover thee: whilst yet thou livest, whilst thou mayest, be good.\nXV. Now much time and leisure doth he gain, who is not curious to know\nwhat his neighbour hath said, or hath done, or hath attempted, but only\nwhat he doth himself, that it may be just and holy? or to express it in\nAgathos' words, Not to look about upon the evil conditions of others,\nbut to run on straight in the line, without any loose and extravagant\nagitation.\nXVI. He who is greedy of credit and reputation after his death, doth\nnot consider, that they themselves by whom he is remembered, shall soon\nafter every one of them be dead; and they likewise that succeed those;\nuntil at last all memory, which hitherto by the succession of men\nadmiring and soon after dying hath had its course, be quite extinct.\nBut suppose that both they that shall remember thee, and thy memory\nwith them should be immortal, what is that to thee? I will not say to\nthee after thou art dead; but even to thee living, what is thy praise?\nBut only for a secret and politic consideration, which we call\n\u03bf\u1f30\u03ba\u03bf\u03bd\u03bf\u03bc\u1f77\u03b1\u03bd, or dispensation. For as for that, that it is the gift of\nnature, whatsoever is commended in thee, what might be objected from\nthence, let that now that we are upon another consideration be omitted\nas unseasonable. That which is fair and goodly, whatsoever it be, and\nin what respect soever it be, that it is fair and goodly, it is so of\nitself, and terminates in itself, not admitting praise as a part or\nmember: that therefore which is praised, is not thereby made either\nbetter or worse. This I understand even of those things, that are\ncommonly called fair and good, as those which are commended either for\nthe matter itself, or for curious workmanship. As for that which is\ntruly good, what can it stand in need of more than either justice or\ntruth; or more than either kindness and modesty? Which of all those,\neither becomes good or fair, because commended; or dispraised suffers\nany damage? Doth the emerald become worse in itself, or more vile if it\nbe not commended? Doth gold, or ivory, or purple? Is there anything\nthat doth though never so common, as a knife, a flower, or a tree?\nXVII. If so be that the souls remain after death (say they that will not\nbelieve it); how is the air from all eternity able to contain them? How\nis the earth (say I) ever from that time able to Contain the bodies\nof them that are buried? For as here the change and resolution of dead\nbodies into another kind of subsistence (whatsoever it be;) makes place\nfor other dead bodies: so the souls after death transferred into the\nair, after they have conversed there a while, are either by way of\ntransmutation, or transfusion, or conflagration, received again into\nthat original rational substance, from which all others do proceed:\nand so give way to those souls, who before coupled and associated unto\nbodies, now begin to subsist single. This, upon a supposition that the\nsouls after death do for a while subsist single, may be answered. And\nhere, (besides the number of bodies, so buried and contained by the\nearth), we may further consider the number of several beasts, eaten\nby us men, and by other creatures. For notwithstanding that such a\nmultitude of them is daily consumed, and as it were buried in the bodies\nof the eaters, yet is the same place and body able to contain them, by\nreason of their conversion, partly into blood, partly into air and fire.\nWhat in these things is the speculation of truth? to divide things into\nthat which is passive and material; and that which is active and formal.\nXVIII. Not to wander out of the way, but upon every motion and desire,\nto perform that which is just: and ever to be careful to attain to the\ntrue natural apprehension of every fancy, that presents itself.\nXIX. Whatsoever is expedient unto thee, O World, is expedient unto me;\nnothing can either be 'unseasonable unto me, or out of date, which unto\nthee is seasonable. Whatsoever thy seasons bear, shall ever by me be\nesteemed as happy fruit, and increase. O Nature! from thee are all\nthings, in thee all things subsist, and to thee all tend. Could he say\nof Athens, Thou lovely city of Cecrops; and shalt not thou say of the\nworld, Thou lovely city of God?\nXX. They will say commonly, Meddle not with many things, if thou wilt\nlive cheerfully. Certainly there is nothing better, than for a man\nto confine himself to necessary actions; to such and so many only, as\nreason in a creature that knows itself born for society, will command\nand enjoin. This will not only procure that cheerfulness, which from the\ngoodness, but that also, which from the paucity of actions doth usually\nproceed. For since it is so, that most of those things, which we either\nspeak or do, are unnecessary; if a man shall cut them off, it must needs\nfollow that he shall thereby gain much leisure, and save much trouble,\nand therefore at every action a man must privately by way of admonition\nsuggest unto himself, What? may not this that now I go about, be of the\nnumber of unnecessary actions? Neither must he use himself to cut off\nactions only, but thoughts and imaginations also, that are unnecessary\nfor so will unnecessary consequent actions the better be prevented and\ncut off.\nXXI. Try also how a good man's life; (of one, who is well pleased with\nthose things whatsoever, which among the common changes and chances of\nthis world fall to his own lot and share; and can live well contented\nand fully satisfied in the justice of his own proper present action,\nand in the goodness of his disposition for the future:) will agree with\nthee. Thou hast had experience of that other kind of life: make now\ntrial of this also. Trouble not thyself any more henceforth, reduce\nthyself unto perfect simplicity. Doth any man offend? It is against\nhimself that he doth offend: why should it trouble thee? Hath anything\nhappened unto thee? It is well, whatsoever it be, it is that which\nof all the common chances of the world from the very beginning in the\nseries of all other things that have, or shall happen, was destinated\nand appointed unto thee. To comprehend all in a few words, our life is\nshort; we must endeavour to gain the present time with best discretion\nand justice. Use recreation with sobriety.\nXXII. Either this world is a \u03ba\u1f79\u03c3\u03bc\u03bf\u03c2 or comely piece, because all\ndisposed and governed by certain order: or if it be a mixture, though\nconfused, yet still it is a comely piece. For is it possible that in\nthee there should be any beauty at all, and that in the whole world\nthere should be nothing but disorder and confusion? and all things in it\ntoo, by natural different properties one from another differenced and\ndistinguished; and yet all through diffused, and by natural sympathy,\none to another united, as they are?\nXXIII. A black or malign disposition, an effeminate disposition; an\nhard inexorable disposition, a wild inhuman disposition, a sheepish\ndisposition, a childish disposition; a blockish, a false, a scurril, a\nfraudulent, a tyrannical: what then? If he be a stranger in the world,\nthat knows not the things that are in it; why not be a stranger as well,\nthat wonders at the things that are done in it?\nXXIV. He is a true fugitive, that flies from reason, by which men are\nsociable. He blind, who cannot see with the eyes of his understanding.\nHe poor, that stands in need of another, and hath not in himself all\nthings needful for this life. He an aposteme of the world, who by being\ndiscontented with those things that happen unto him in the world,\ndoth as it were apostatise, and separate himself from common nature's\nrational administration. For the same nature it is that brings this\nunto thee, whatsoever it be, that first brought thee into the world. He\nraises sedition in the city, who by irrational actions withdraws his own\nsoul from that one and common soul of all rational creatures.\nXXV. There is, who without so much as a coat; and there is, who without\nso much as a book, doth put philosophy in practice. I am half naked,\nneither have I bread to eat, and yet I depart not from reason, saith\none. But I say; I want the food of good teaching, and instructions, and\nyet I depart not from reason.\nXXVI. What art and profession soever thou hast learned, endeavour to\naffect it, and comfort thyself in it; and pass the remainder of thy life\nas one who from his whole heart commits himself and whatsoever belongs\nunto him, unto the gods: and as for men, carry not thyself either\ntyrannically or servilely towards any.\nXXVII. Consider in my mind, for example's sake, the times of Vespasian:\nthou shalt see but the same things: some marrying, some bringing up\nchildren, some sick, some dying, some fighting, some feasting, some\nmerchandising, some tilling, some flattering, some boasting, some\nsuspecting, some undermining, some wishing to die, some fretting and\nmurmuring at their present estate, some wooing, some hoarding, some\nseeking after magistracies, and some after kingdoms. And is not that\ntheir age quite over, and ended? Again, consider now the times of\nTrajan. There likewise thou seest the very self-same things, and that\nage also is now over and ended. In the like manner consider other\nperiods, both of times and of whole nations, and see how many men, after\nthey had with all their might and main intended and prosecuted some one\nworldly thing or other did soon after drop away, and were resolved into\nthe elements. But especially thou must call to mind them, whom thou\nthyself in thy lifetime hast known much distracted about vain things,\nand in the meantime neglecting to do that, and closely and unseparably\n(as fully satisfied with it) to adhere unto it, which their own proper\nconstitution did require. And here thou must remember, that thy carriage\nin every business must be according to the worth and due proportion of\nit, for so shalt thou not easily be tired out and vexed, if thou shalt\nnot dwell upon small matters longer than is fitting.\nXXVIII. Those words which once were common and ordinary, are now become\nobscure and obsolete; and so the names of men once commonly known and\nfamous, are now become in a manner obscure and obsolete names. Camillus,\nC\u00e6so, Volesius, Leonnatus; not long after, Scipio, Cato, then Augustus,\nthen Adrianus, then Antoninus Pius: all these in a short time will\nbe out of date, and, as things of another world as it were, become\nfabulous. And this I say of them, who once shined as the wonders of\ntheir ages, for as for the rest, no sooner are they expired, than with\nthem all their fame and memory. And what is it then that shall always be\nremembered? all is vanity. What is it that we must bestow our care and\ndiligence upon? even upon this only: that our minds and wills be just;\nthat our actions be charitable; that our speech be never deceitful, or\nthat our understanding be not subject to error; that our inclination be\nalways set to embrace whatsoever shall happen unto us, as necessary,\nas usual, as ordinary, as flowing from such a beginning, and such a\nfountain, from which both thou thyself and all things are.\nWillingly therefore, and wholly surrender up thyself unto that fatal\nconcatenation, yielding up thyself unto the fates, to be disposed of at\ntheir pleasure.\nXXIX. Whatsoever is now present, and from day to day hath its existence;\nall objects of memories, and the minds and memories themselves,\nincessantly consider, all things that are, have their being by change\nand alteration. Use thyself therefore often to meditate upon this, that\nthe nature of the universe delights in nothing more, than in altering\nthose things that are, and in making others like unto them. So that we\nmay say, that whatsoever is, is but as it were the seed of that which\nshall be. For if thou think that that only is seed, which either the\nearth or the womb receiveth, thou art very simple.\nXXX. Thou art now ready to die, and yet hast thou not attained to\nthat perfect simplicity: thou art yet subject to many troubles and\nperturbations; not yet free from all fear and suspicion of external\naccidents; nor yet either so meekly disposed towards all men, as thou\nshouldest; or so affected as one, whose only study and only wisdom is,\nto be just in all his actions.\nXXXI. Behold and observe, what is the state of their rational part; and\nthose that the world doth account wise, see what things they fly and are\nafraid of; and what things they hunt after.\nXXXII. In another man's mind and understanding thy evil Cannot subsist,\nnor in any proper temper or distemper of the natural constitution of thy\nbody, which is but as it were the coat or cottage of thy soul. Wherein\nthen, but in that part of thee, wherein the conceit, and apprehension\nof any misery can subsist? Let not that part therefore admit any such\nconceit, and then all is well. Though thy body which is so near it\nshould either be cut or burnt, or suffer any corruption or putrefaction,\nyet let that part to which it belongs to judge of these, be still at\nrest; that is, let her judge this, that whatsoever it is, that equally\nmay happen to a wicked man, and to a good man, is neither good nor evil.\nFor that which happens equally to him that lives according to nature,\nand to him that doth not, is neither according to nature, nor against\nit; and by consequent, neither good nor bad.\nXXXIII. Ever consider and think upon the world as being but one living\nsubstance, and having but one soul, and how all things in the world, are\nterminated into one sensitive power; and are done by one general motion\nas it were, and deliberation of that one soul; and how all things that\nare, concur in the cause of one another's being, and by what manner of\nconnection and concatenation all things happen.\nXXXIV. What art thou, that better and divine part excepted, but as\nEpictetus said well, a wretched soul, appointed to carry a carcass up\nand down?\nXXXV. To suffer change can be no hurt; as no benefit it is, by change to\nattain to being. The age and time of the world is as it were a flood and\nswift current, consisting of the things that are brought to pass in\nthe world. For as soon as anything hath appeared, and is passed away,\nanother succeeds, and that also will presently out of sight.\nXXXVI. Whatsoever doth happen in the world, is, in the course of nature,\nas usual and ordinary as a rose in the spring, and fruit in summer. Of\nthe same nature is sickness and death; slander, and lying in wait, and\nwhatsoever else ordinarily doth unto fools use to be occasion either\nof joy or sorrow. That, whatsoever it is, that comes after, doth always\nvery naturally, and as it were familiarly, follow upon that which was\nbefore. For thou must consider the things of the world, not as a loose\nindependent number, consisting merely of necessary events; but as a\ndiscreet connection of things orderly and harmoniously disposed. There\nis then to be seen in the things of the world, not a bare succession,\nbut an admirable correspondence and affinity.\nXXXVII. Let that of Heraclitus never be out of thy mind, that the death\nof earth, is water, and the death of water, is air; and the death of\nair, is fire; and so on the contrary. Remember him also who was\nignorant whither the way did lead, and how that reason being the thing\nby which all things in the world are administered, and which men are\ncontinually and most inwardly conversant with: yet is the thing, which\nordinarily they are most in opposition with, and how those things which\ndaily happen among them, cease not daily to be strange unto them, and\nthat we should not either speak, or do anything as men in their sleep,\nby opinion and bare imagination: for then we think we speak and do, and\nthat we must not be as children, who follow their father's example; for\nbest reason alleging their bare \u03ba\u03b1\u03b8\u1f79\u03c4\u03b9 \u03c0\u03b1\u03c1\u03b5\u03b9\u03bb\u1f75\u03c6\u03b1\u03bc\u03b5\u03bd; or, as by\nsuccessive tradition from our forefathers we have received it.\nXXXVIII. Even as if any of the gods should tell thee, Thou shalt\ncertainly die to-morrow, or next day, thou wouldst not, except thou wert\nextremely base and pusillanimous, take it for a great benefit, rather\nto die the next day after, than to-morrow; (for alas, what is the\ndifference!) so, for the same reason, think it no great matter to die\nrather many years after, than the very next day.\nXXXIX. Let it be thy perpetual meditation, how many physicians who\nonce looked so grim, and so theatrically shrunk their brows upon their\npatients, are dead and gone themselves. How many astrologers, after that\nin great ostentation they had foretold the death of some others, how\nmany philosophers after so many elaborate tracts and volumes concerning\neither mortality or immortality; how many brave captains and commanders,\nafter the death and slaughter of so many; how many kings and tyrants,\nafter they had with such horror and insolency abused their power upon\nmen's lives, as though themselves had been immortal; how many, that\nI may so speak, whole cities both men and towns: Helice, Pompeii,\nHerculaneum, and others innumerable are dead and gone. Run them over\nalso, whom thou thyself, one after another, hast known in thy time\nto drop away. Such and such a one took care of such and such a one's\nburial, and soon after was buried himself. So one, so another: and all\nthings in a short time. For herein lieth all indeed, ever to look upon\nall worldly things, as things for their continuance, that are but for a\nday: and for their worth, most vile, and contemptible, as for example,\nWhat is man? That which but the other day when he was conceived was vile\nsnivel; and within few days shall be either an embalmed carcass, or mere\nashes. Thus must thou according to truth and nature, throughly consider\nhow man's life is but for a very moment of time, and so depart meek and\ncontented: even as if a ripe olive falling should praise the ground that\nbare her, and give thanks to the tree that begat her.\nXL. Thou must be like a promontory of the sea, against which though\nthe waves beat continually, yet it both itself stands, and about it are\nthose swelling waves stilled and quieted.\nXLI. Oh, wretched I, to whom this mischance is happened! nay, happy I,\nto whom this thing being happened, I can continue without grief; neither\nwounded by that which is present, nor in fear of that which is to come.\nFor as for this, it might have happened unto any man, but any man having\nsuch a thing befallen him, could not have continued without grief. Why\nthen should that rather be an unhappiness, than this a happiness? But\nhowever, canst thou, O man! term that unhappiness, which is no mischance\nto the nature of man I Canst thou think that a mischance to the nature\nof man, which is not contrary to the end and will of his nature? What\nthen hast thou learned is the will of man's nature? Doth that then which\nhath happened unto thee, hinder thee from being just? or magnanimous? or\ntemperate? or wise? or circumspect? or true? or modest? or free? or from\nanything else of all those things in the present enjoying and possession\nwhereof the nature of man, (as then enjoying all that is proper unto\nher,) is fully satisfied? Now to conclude; upon all occasion of sorrow\nremember henceforth to make use of this dogma, that whatsoever it is\nthat hath happened unto thee, is in very deed no such thing of itself,\nas a misfortune; but that to bear it generously, is certainly great\nhappiness.\nXLII. It is but an ordinary coarse one, yet it is a good effectual\nremedy against the fear of death, for a man to consider in his mind the\nexamples of such, who greedily and covetously (as it were) did for a\nlong time enjoy their lives. What have they got more, than they whose\ndeaths have been untimely? Are not they themselves dead at the last?\nas Cadiciant's, Fabius, Julianus Lepidus, or any other who in their\nlifetime having buried many, were at the last buried themselves. The\nwhole space of any man's life, is but little; and as little as it is,\nwith what troubles, with what manner of dispositions, and in the society\nof how wretched a body must it be passed! Let it be therefore unto thee\naltogether as a matter of indifferency. For if thou shalt look backward;\nbehold, what an infinite chaos of time doth present itself unto thee;\nand as infinite a chaos, if thou shalt look forward. In that which is\nso infinite, what difference can there be between that which liveth but\nthree days, and that which liveth three ages?\nXLIII. Let thy course ever be the most compendious way. The most\ncompendious, is that which is according to nature: that is, in all both\nwords and deeds, ever to follow that which is most sound and perfect.\nFor such a resolution will free a man from all trouble, strife,\ndissembling, and ostentation.", "source": "meditations.txt"}
