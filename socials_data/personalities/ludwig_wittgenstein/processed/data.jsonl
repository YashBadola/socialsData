Hoc autem eos velle ex motu corporis aperiebatur: tamquam verbis naturalibus omnium gentium, quae fiunt vultu et nutu oculorum, ceterorumque membrorum actu, et sonitu vocis indicante affectionem animi in petendis, habendis, rejiciendis, fugiendisve rebus. Ita verba in variis sententiis locis suis posita, et crebro audita, quarum rerum signa essent, paulatim colligebam, measque jam voluntates, edomito in eis signis ore, per haec enuntiabam.\" (Augustine, Confessions, I. 8.)\nThese words, it seems to me, give us a particular picture of the essence of human language. It is this: the individual words in language name objects\u2014sentences are combinations of such names. In this picture of language we find the roots of the following idea: Every word has a meaning. This meaning is correlated with the word. It is the object for which the word stands.\nAugustine does not speak of there being any difference between kinds of word. If you describe the learning of language in this way, you are, I believe, thinking primarily of nouns like \"table\", \"chair\", \"bread\", and of people's names, and only secondarily of the names of certain actions and properties; and of the remaining kinds of word as something that will take care of itself.\nNow think of the following use of language: I send someone shopping. I give him a slip marked \"five red apples\". He takes the slip to the shopkeeper, who opens the drawer marked \"apples\"; then he looks up the word \"red\" in a table and finds a colour sample opposite it; then he says the series of cardinal numbers\u2014I assume that he knows them by heart\u2014up to the word \"five\" and for each number he takes an apple of the same colour as the sample out of the drawer.\u2014\u2014It is in this and similar ways that one operates with words.\u2014\u2014\"But how does he know where and how he is to look up the word 'red' and what he is to do with the word 'five'?\"\u2014\u2014Well, I assume that he acts as I have described. Explanations come to an end somewhere.\u2014\u2014But what is the meaning of the word \"five\"?\u2014\u2014No such thing was in question here, only how the word \"five\" is used.\n2. That philosophical concept of meaning has its place in a primitive idea of the way language functions. But one can also say that it is the idea of a language more primitive than ours.\nLet us imagine a language for which the description given by Augustine is right. The language is meant to serve for communication between a builder A and an assistant B. A is building with building-stones: there are blocks, pillars, slabs and beams. B has to pass the stones, and that in the order in which A needs them. For this purpose they use a language consisting of the words \"block\", \"pillar\", \"slab\", \"beam\". A calls them out;\u2014\u2014B brings the stone which he has learnt to bring at such-and-such a call.\u2014\u2014Conceive this as a complete primitive language.\n3. Augustine, we might say, does describe a system of communication; only not everything that we call language is this system. And one has to say this in many cases where the question arises \"Is this an appropriate description or not?\" The answer is: \"Yes, it is appropriate, but only for this narrowly circumscribed region, not for the whole of what you were claiming to describe.\"\nIt is as if someone were to say: \"A game consists in moving objects about on a surface according to certain rules...\"\u2014\u2014and we replied: You seem to be thinking of board games, but there are others. You can make your definition correct by expressly restricting it to those games.\n43. For a large class of cases\u2014though not for all\u2014in which we employ the word \"meaning\" it can be defined thus: the meaning of a word is its use in the language. And the meaning of a name is sometimes explained by pointing to its bearer.", "source": "philosophical_investigations.txt"}

Logic treats of every possibility, and all possibilities are its facts.)\nJust as we cannot think of spatial objects at all apart from space, or temporal objects apart from time, so we cannot think of any object apart from the possibility of its connection with other things.\nIf I can think of an object in the context of an atomic fact, I cannot think of it apart from the possibility of this context.\n7 Whereof one cannot speak, thereof one must be silent.", "source": "tractatus.txt"}
