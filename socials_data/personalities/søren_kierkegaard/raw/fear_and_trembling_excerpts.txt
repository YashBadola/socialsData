Excerpt from Fear and Trembling (1843)

"Faith is precisely this paradox, that the single individual is higher than the universal. It is the paradox that the single individual as the single individual stands in an absolute relation to the absolute."

"If there were no eternal consciousness in a man, if at the foundation of all there lay only a wildly seething power which writhing with obscure passions produced everything that is great and everything that is insignificant, if a bottomless void never satiated lay hidden beneath all--what then would life be but despair?"

"Infinite resignation is the last stage prior to faith, so that one who has not made this movement has not faith; for only in the infinite resignation do I become clear to myself with respect to my eternal validity, and only then can there be question of grasping existence by virtue of faith."

"Abraham is the knight of faith."
