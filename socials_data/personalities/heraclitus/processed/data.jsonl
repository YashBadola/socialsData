{"text": "War is the father and king of all, and has produced some as gods and some as men, and has made some slaves and some free.\nIt is a harmony of oppositions, as in the case of the bow and of the lyre.\nThe unlike is joined together, and from differences results the most beautiful harmony, and all things take place by strife.\nThe hidden harmony is better than the visible.\nGood and evil are the same.\nUnite whole and part, agreement and disagreement, accordant and discordant; from all comes one, and from one all.\nGod is day and night, winter and summer, war and peace, plenty and want. But he is changed, just as when incense is mingled with incense, but named according to the pleasure of each.\nThe way upward and downward are one and the same.\nThe beginning and end are common.\nImmortals are mortal, mortals immortal, living in their death and dying in their life.\nLiving and dead, awake and asleep, young and old, are the same. For these several states are transmutations of each other.\nDisease makes health pleasant and good; hunger, satiety; weariness, rest.\nCouples are wholes and not wholes, what agrees disagrees, the concordant is discordant. From all things one and from one all things.", "source": "opposites.txt"}
{"text": "Into the same river you could not step twice, for other and still other waters are flowing.\nTo those entering the same river, other and still other waters flow.\nInto the same river we both step and do not step. We both are and are not.\nIt is weariness upon the same things to labor and by them to be controlled.\nIn change is rest.\nA mixture separates when not kept in motion.\nIt disperses and gathers, it comes and goes.\nCool becomes warm, and warm, cold; wet becomes dry, and dry, wet.", "source": "flux.txt"}
{"text": "This world, the same for all, neither any of the gods nor any man has made, but it always was, and is, and shall be, an ever living fire, kindled in due measure, and in due measure extinguished.\nThe transmutations of fire are, first, the sea; and of the sea, half is earth, and half the lightning flash.\nAll things are exchanged for fire and fire for all things, just as wares for gold and gold for wares.\nFire lives in the death of earth, air lives in the death of fire, water lives in the death of air, and earth in the death of water.\nFire coming upon all things, will sift and seize them.\nThe sun is new every day.\nThe sun will not overstep his bounds, for if he does, the Erinyes, helpers of justice, will find him out.\nIf there were no sun, it would be night.\nLightning rules all.\nHow can one escape that which never sets?", "source": "cosmos.txt"}
{"text": "Death is what we see waking. What we see in sleep is a dream.\nMan, as a light at night, is lighted and extinguished.\nTime is a child playing at draughts, a child's kingdom.\nA man when he is drunken is led by a beardless youth, stumbling, ignorant where he is going, having a wet soul.\nThe dry soul is the wisest and best.\nTo souls it is death to become water, and to water it is death to become earth, but from earth comes water, and from water, soul.\nTo souls it is joy to become wet.\nThe limits of the soul you would not find out, though you should traverse every way.\nThere awaits men after death what they neither hope nor think.\nCorpses are more worthless than excrement.\nI have inquired of myself.\nOne day is like all.\nA man's character is his daemon.\nGreater fates gain greater rewards.", "source": "life_and_death.txt"}
{"text": "It is wise for those who hear, not me, but the universal Reason, to confess that all things are one.\nTo this universal Reason which I unfold, although it always exists, men make themselves insensible, both before they have heard it and when they have heard it for the first time. For notwithstanding that all things happen according to this Reason, men act as though they had never had any experience in regard to it when they attempt such words and works as I am now relating, describing each thing according to its nature and explaining how it is ordered. And some men are as ignorant of what they do when awake as they are forgetful of what they do when asleep.\nThose who hear and do not understand are like the deaf. Of them the proverb says: \"Present, they are absent.\"\nEyes and ears are bad witnesses to men having rude souls.\nThe majority of people have no understanding of the things with which they daily meet, nor, when instructed, do they have any right knowledge of them, although to themselves they seem to have.\nThey understand neither how to hear nor how to speak.\nOf all whose words I have heard, no one attains to this, to know that wisdom is apart from all.\nThere is one wisdom, to understand the intelligent will by which all things are governed through all.\nThe Law of Understanding is common to all. Those who speak with intelligence must hold fast to that which is common to all, even more strongly than a city holds fast to its law. For all human laws are dependent upon one divine Law, for this rules as far as it wills, and suffices for all, and overabounds.\nAlthough the Law of Reason is common, the majority of people live as though they had an understanding of their own.\nFor human nature does not possess understanding, but the divine does.\nThe thoughtless man understands the voice of the Deity as little as the child understands the man.\nThe straight and crooked way of the woolcarders is one and the same.\nLet us not draw conclusions rashly about the greatest things.\nPhilosophers must be learned in very many things.", "source": "logos.txt"}
{"text": "Much learning does not teach one to have understanding, else it would have taught Hesiod and Pythagoras, and again Xenophanes and Hecataeus.\nPythagoras, son of Mnesarchus, practised investigation most of all men, and having chosen out these treatises, he made a wisdom of his own--much learning and bad art.\nHesiod is a teacher of the masses. They suppose him to have possessed the greatest knowledge, who indeed did not know day and night. For they are one.\nHomer deserved to be driven out of the lists and flogged, and Archilochus likewise.\nThe Ephesians deserve, man for man, to be hung, and the youth to leave the city, inasmuch as they have banished Hermodorus, the worthiest man among them, saying: \"Let no one of us excel, and if there be any such, let him go elsewhere and among other people.\"\nAsses would choose stubble rather than gold.\nDogs, also, bark at what they do not know.\nThe most approved of those who are of repute knows how to cheat. Nevertheless, justice will catch the makers and witnesses of lies.\nFor the best men choose one thing above all--immortal glory among mortals; but the masses stuff themselves like cattle.", "source": "critiques.txt"}
