Preface

If no one else will undertake to tell the story of Abraham, I will. I know very well that I am not the one who can do it as it ought to be done; but I can at least describe my own fascination with the story.

The story of Abraham is one that we all know, but it is not one that we all understand. We know the facts: God commanded Abraham to sacrifice his son Isaac, his only son, the son whom he loved. And Abraham obeyed. He saddled his donkey, took two of his servants and his son Isaac, and set out for the place that God had shown him.

On the third day Abraham looked up and saw the place in the distance. He said to his servants, "Stay here with the donkey; the boy and I will go over there; we will worship, and then we will come back to you."

Abraham took the wood for the burnt offering and placed it on his son Isaac, and he himself carried the fire and the knife. As the two of them went on together, Isaac spoke up and said to his father Abraham, "Father?"

"Yes, my son?" Abraham replied.

"The fire and wood are here," Isaac said, "but where is the lamb for the burnt offering?"

Abraham answered, "God himself will provide the lamb for the burnt offering, my son." And the two of them went on together.

When they reached the place God had told him about, Abraham built an altar there and arranged the wood on it. He bound his son Isaac and laid him on the altar, on top of the wood. Then he reached out his hand and took the knife to slay his son.

But the angel of the Lord called out to him from heaven, "Abraham! Abraham!"

"Here I am," he replied.

"Do not lay a hand on the boy," he said. "Do not do anything to him. Now I know that you fear God, because you have not withheld from me your son, your only son."

Abraham looked up and there in a thicket he saw a ram caught by its horns. He went over and took the ram and sacrificed it as a burnt offering instead of his son. So Abraham called that place The Lord Will Provide. And to this day it is said, "On the mountain of the Lord it will be provided."

This is the story. But what does it mean? What does it mean to have faith like Abraham? Is it possible for us to understand such faith, or is it something that lies beyond the limits of human reason?

I confess that I do not understand Abraham. I admire him, I am astounded by him, but I cannot follow him. Every time I try to think about his action, I am struck by a kind of vertigo. I feel like a man who is standing at the edge of a precipice, looking down into an abyss.

Faith is a paradox. It is the paradox that the single individual is higher than the universal. It is the paradox that the individual determines his relation to the universal by his relation to the absolute, not his relation to the absolute by his relation to the universal.

Abraham is the knight of faith. He is the one who has suspended the ethical in order to obey the divine command. He has acted in virtue of the absurd. He has believed that God would not require Isaac of him, and yet he was willing to sacrifice Isaac. He believed that he would receive Isaac back again, and yet he was willing to give him up.

This is the movement of faith. It is a double movement. It is the movement of infinite resignation and the movement of faith. In infinite resignation, the individual gives up everything. He renounces his claim on the world and on his own happiness. But in faith, he gets everything back. He receives it all back by virtue of the absurd.
