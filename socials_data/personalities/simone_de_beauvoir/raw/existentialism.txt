To exist is to create oneself.

To will oneself moral and to will oneself free are one and the same decision.

I wish that every human life might be pure transparent freedom.

Freedom is the source from which all significations and all values spring.

It is in the knowledge of the genuine conditions of our life that we must draw our strength to live and our reason for acting.

Man is nothing else but what he makes of himself.

There is no justification for present existence other than its expansion into an indefinitely open future.

The details of a situation are interesting only if they can be related to the whole; and that is why, in order to give a faithful account of a human life, we must grasp it in its total movement.

The body is not a thing, it is a situation: it is our grasp on the world and our sketch of our projects.
