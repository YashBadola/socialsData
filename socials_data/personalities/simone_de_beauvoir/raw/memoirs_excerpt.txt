MEMOIRS OF A DUTIFUL DAUGHTER - EXCERPT

I was born at four o’clock in the morning on the 9th of January 1908, in a room fitted with white-lacquered furniture, which overlooked the Boulevard Raspail. In the family photographs taken the following summer, I can be seen—ladies in large hats with ostrich feathers, gentlemen in boaters and panamas, all smiling at a baby: they are my parents, my grandfather, uncles, aunts; and the baby is me. My father was thirty, my mother twenty-one, and I was their first child. I turn the page: here is a photograph of Papa holding me in his arms; I am not looking at the camera; my face is puffed out, my eyes are blank. I look like a doll, or any other baby. But my father’s face is interesting: he is smiling, but there is a certain gravity in his smile, a sort of wonder, and also a hint of anxiety. He seems to be saying: "What is this strange little creature? What will become of her?"

My earliest memories are of a world that was secure, orderly, and bright. I was a happy child, surrounded by love and attention. But even then, I had a sense of my own individuality, a desire to assert myself. I remember flying into rages when I couldn't get my way. I was a dutiful daughter, yes, but I was also a willful one.

I remember the books I read, the games I played, the conversations I overheard. I was fascinated by words, by ideas, by the world of the intellect. I wanted to know everything, to understand everything. I was not content to accept the world as it was; I wanted to question it, to challenge it.

As I grew older, I began to realize that the world was not as simple as I had thought. I saw the injustices, the inequalities, the hypocrisies. I saw how women were treated, how they were expected to be passive and submissive. I rebelled against this. I determined that I would not be like other women. I would be free, independent, my own person.

My friendship with Zaza was a turning point in my life. She was so alive, so vibrant, so full of potential. Her tragic death affected me deeply. It made me realize the fragility of life, the unfairness of fate. It strengthened my resolve to live my own life to the fullest, to make my mark on the world.

Meeting Sartre was another turning point. Here was someone who was my equal, my intellectual partner. We shared a passion for philosophy, for writing, for freedom. We made a pact: we would be essential to each other, but we would also have contingent loves. We would be free, but we would always be honest with each other.

Looking back, I see how all these experiences shaped me, how they led me to become the woman I am today. I have no regrets. I have lived my life on my own terms. I have made mistakes, yes, but they were my mistakes. I have loved, I have suffered, I have created. And through it all, I have tried to be true to myself, to my own truth.
