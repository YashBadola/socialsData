{"text": "The Sickness Unto Death\nA Christian Psychological Exposition for Upbuilding and Awakening\nBy Anti-Climacus\nDespair is the sickness, not the cure. It is the disrelationship in a relation which relates itself to itself.\nMan is spirit. But what is spirit? Spirit is the self. But what is the self? The self is a relation that relates itself to itself or is the relation's relating itself to itself in the relation; the self is not the relation but is the relation's relating itself to itself. Man is a synthesis of the infinite and the finite, of the temporal and the eternal, of freedom and necessity, in short, a synthesis. A synthesis is a relation between two. Considered in this way, man is still not a self.\nIn the relation between two, the relation is the third as a negative unity, and the two relate to the relation and in the relation to the relation; thus under the qualification of the psychical the relation between the psychical and the physical is a relation. If, however, the relation relates itself to itself, this relation is the positive third, and this is the self.\nDespair is the sickness unto death. The concept of death.\nFor Christianly understood death is by no means the last thing of all, hence it is only a minor event within that which is all, an eternal life; and even if there were no eternal life, there would still be more than death, for there is a Spirit, which is the self.\nTo be sick unto death is to be unable to die, but not as though there were hope of life; no, the hopelessness is that there is not even the ultimate hope, death. When death is the greatest danger, one hopes for life; but when one has come to know the even greater danger, one hopes for death. So when the danger is so great that death has become one's hope, despair is the hopelessness of not even being able to die.\nIt is in this sense that despair is the sickness unto death, this agonizing contradiction, this sickness in the self, everlastingly to die, to die and yet not to die, to die the death. For to die signifies that it is all over, but to die the death means to live to experience death; and if for a single moment this is experienced, it is forever. If one might die of despair as one dies of a sickness, then the eternal in him, the self, must be capable of dying in the same sense that the body dies of sickness. But this is an impossibility; the dying of despair transforms itself constantly into a living. The despairing man cannot die; no more than \"the dagger can slay thoughts\" can despair consume the eternal thing, the self, which is the ground of despair, whose worm dieth not and whose fire is not quenched.", "source": "sickness_unto_death_excerpt.txt"}
{"text": "The Rotation Method: An Essay in the Theory of Social Prudence\nPeople with experience maintain that it is very sensible to capture the bird in the hand, but he who wants to capture the bird in the bush must not use his hand but the mousetrap of the imagination.\nAll men are bored. The word itself suggests the possibility of subdivision. The gods were bored, and so they created man. Adam was bored because he was alone, and so Eve was created. Thus boredom entered the world, and increased in proportion to the increase of population. Adam was bored alone; then Adam and Eve were bored together; then Adam and Eve and Cain and Abel were bored en famille; then the population of the world increased, and the peoples were bored en masse. To divert themselves they conceived the idea of constructing a tower high enough to reach the heavens. This idea is itself as boring as the tower was high, and constitutes a terrible proof of how boredom had gained the upper hand.\nBoredom is the root of all evil. It is very curious that boredom, which itself has such a calm and sedate nature, can have such a capacity to initiate motion. The effect of boredom is usually abbreviated to this: that it is the root of all evil.\nThe more one limits oneself, the more inventive one becomes. A prisoner in solitary confinement for life becomes very inventive, and a spider may furnish him with much entertainment. One realizes his pain, but his ingenuity one does not know.\nTo be perfectly consistent, the method should be called the Rotation Method. Here, however, I must not be misunderstood. I do not mean a change of field, but a change in the method of cultivation. It is a principle of agriculture that one should not keep on planting the same crop in the same field; and just as one varies the crops, so one varies the soil. But this is not the rotation method. It is the extensive method. The rotation method, properly so called, consists in this, that one changes the method of cultivation and the crops. One does not need to travel around the world to find distraction. One does not need to constantly seek new friends. No, the art is to remember and to forget.\nIt is essential to have control over one\u2019s moods. One must know how to produce them and how to dismiss them. But the most important thing is to be able to forget. Forgetting is the shears with which you prune away what you cannot use, doing it under the supreme direction of memory. Forgetting and remembering are thus identical arts, and the artistic achievement is the unity of the two.", "source": "either_or_excerpt.txt"}
{"text": "Preface\nNot only in the world of commerce but also in the world of ideas our age has organized a regular clearance sale. Everything is to be had at such a bargain that it is questionable whether in the end there is anybody who will want to bid. Every speculative price-fixer who conscientiously directs attention to the significant march of modern philosophy, every assistant professor, tutor, and student, every crofter and cottar in philosophy, is not content with doubting everything but goes further. Perhaps it would be untimely and ill-timed to ask them where they are going, but surely it is courteous and assumes no responsibility to take it for granted that they have doubted everything, since otherwise it would be a queer thing for them to be going further. Having made this preliminary movement, having perceived that they have done this, they may perhaps not take it amiss if one asks them why they have done it, or better still, implies this question by showing the consequences.\nThe present author is by no means a philosopher. He is, poetice et eleganter [in a poetic and elegant way], a freelance writer who neither writes the system nor gives promises of the system, who neither subscribes to the system nor ascribes anything to it. He writes because to him it is a luxury that is all the more pleasant and apparent the fewer there are who buy and read what he writes. He can easily foresee his fate in an age when passion has been obliterated in favor of science, in an age when an author who wants to have readers must take care to write in such a way that the book can be easily perused during the afternoon nap, and be sure to look like the polite gardener in the advertisement, who with hat in hand and a good certificate from the last place he worked recommends himself to the esteemed public.\nFaith is precisely this paradox, that the single individual is higher than the universal.\nIf this is not faith, then Abraham is lost, then faith has never existed in the world because it has always existed. For if the ethical (i.e., the moral) is the highest thing, and if nothing incommensurable remains in man in any other way but as the evil (i.e., the particular which has to be expressed in the universal), then one needs no other categories than those which the Greeks possessed or which by consistent thinking can be derived from them. This is the new category which understanding cannot think.\nAbraham I cannot understand, in a certain sense I can learn nothing from him but astonishment. If people fancy that by considering the outcome of this story they might let themselves be moved to believe, they deceive themselves and want to swindle God out of the first movement of faith, the infinite resignation. They would suck worldly wisdom out of the paradox. Perhaps one or another may succeed in that, for our age is not willing to stop with faith, with its miracle of turning water into wine, it goes further, it turns wine into water.", "source": "fear_and_trembling_excerpt.txt"}
