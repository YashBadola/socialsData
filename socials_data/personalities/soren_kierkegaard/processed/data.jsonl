{"text": "The Sickness Unto Death\nby Anti-Climacus\nA Christian Psychological Exposition for Upbuilding and Awakening\nThe human being is spirit. But what is spirit? Spirit is the self. But what is the self? The self is a relation that relates itself to itself or is the relation's relating itself to itself in the relation; the self is not the relation but that the relation relates itself to itself. A human being is a synthesis of the infinite and the finite, of the temporal and the eternal, of freedom and necessity, in short, a synthesis. A synthesis is a relation between two. Considered in this way, a human being is still not a self.\nIn the relation between two, the relation is the third as a negative unity, and the two relate to the relation and in the relation to the relation; thus under the qualification of the psychical the relation between the psychical and the physical is a relation. But if the relation relates itself to itself, this relation is the positive third, and this is the self.\nSuch a relation that relates itself to itself, a self, must either have established itself or have been established by another.\nIf the relation that relates itself to itself has been established by another, then the relation is indeed the third, but this relation, the third, is yet again a relation and relates itself to that which established the whole relation.\nThe human self is such a derived, established relation, a relation that relates itself to itself and in relating itself to itself relates itself to another. This is why there can be two forms of despair. If the human self had established itself, then there could be only one form: not to will to be oneself, to will to do away with oneself, but there could not be the form: in despair to will to be oneself.\nDespair is the sickness unto death.\nThe concept of the sickness unto death must be understood in a specific way. It is not literally a sickness of which one dies, but a sickness the end of which is death, and death is the end. Thus, metaphorically speaking, there is much that is a sickness unto death. But in the Christian sense, death is not the end of everything; it is merely an event within life, which is infinitely more than death. Therefore, in the Christian sense, the sickness unto death is not a bodily sickness, for even if this were to cause death, death is not the end.\nNo, the sickness unto death is despair.", "source": "sickness_unto_death.txt"}
{"text": "The ethical as such is the universal, it applies to everyone, which may be expressed from another point of view by saying that it applies every instant. It reposes immanently in itself, it has nothing without itself which is its telos, but is itself telos for everything outside it, and when this has been incorporated by the ethical it can go no further. Conceived immediately as physical and psychical, the particular individual is the individual who has his telos in the universal, and his ethical task is to express himself constantly in it, to abolish his particularity in order to become the universal. As soon as the individual would assert himself as the particular over against the universal, he sins, and only by recognizing this can he again reconcile himself with the universal. Every time the individual after he has entered the universal either feels an impulse to assert himself as the particular or does this, he is in a spiritual trial (tentation), and he can only work himself out of this by penitently abandoning himself as the particular in the universal. If this be the highest thing that can be said of man and his existence, then the ethical has the same nature as man's eternal blessedness, which to all eternity and at every instant is his telos, since it would be a contradiction to say that this might be abandoned (i.e. teleologically suspended), seeing that as soon as it is suspended it is forfeited, whereas in other cases what is suspended is not forfeited but is preserved precisely in that higher thing which is its telos.\nIf such be the case, then Hegel is right when in his chapter on \"The Good and the Conscience,\" he characterizes man only as the particular and regards this character as \"a moral form of evil\" which is to be annulled in the teleology of the moral, so that the individual who remains in this stage is either sinning or subjected to spiritual trial (tentation). But he is wrong in talking of faith, wrong in not protesting loudly and clearly against the fact that Abraham enjoys honor and glory as the father of faith, whereas he ought to be prosecuted and convicted of murder.\nFor faith is this paradox, that the particular is higher than the universal--yet in such a way, be it observed, that the movement repeats itself, and that consequently the individual, after having been in the universal, now as the particular isolates himself as higher than the universal. If this be not faith, then Abraham is lost, then faith has never existed in the world... because it has always existed. For if the ethical (i.e. the moral) is the highest thing, and if nothing incommensurable remains in man in any other way but as the evil (i.e. the particular which has to be expressed in the universal), then one needs no other categories than those which the Greek philosophers possessed or which can be deduced from them. This is what Hegel should have said, and then he would have said something strange and demanding.", "source": "fear_and_trembling.txt"}
{"text": "Either/Or: A Fragment of Life\nPreface\nIt may perhaps occur to you, dear reader, to doubt a little whether the position is quite correct that the outer is the inner and the inner the outer. Perhaps you have rather felt that it is an expression of a certain proud modesty which, on the one hand, is too proud to wish to be understood by everyone, and on the other, too modest to wish to obtrude itself upon everyone. You may perhaps have felt that the inner is the inner, and the outer is the outer, and that the one is not the other. You may perhaps have had a secret suspicion that the philosophical movement of the age, in its haste to realize the system, has perhaps been a little too quick in cancelling the distinction.\nDiapsalmata\nWhat is a poet? An unhappy man who in his heart harbors a deep anguish, but whose lips are so fashioned that the moans and cries which pass over them are transformed into ravishing music. His fate is like that of the unfortunate victims whom the tyrant Phalaris imprisoned in a brazen bull, and slowly tortured over a steady fire; their cries could not reach the tyrant's ears so as to strike terror into his heart; when they reached him they sounded like sweet music. And men crowd about the poet and say to him, \"Sing for us soon again\"\u2014that is as much as to say, \"May new sufferings torment your soul, but may your lips be fashioned as before; for the cries would only distress us, but the music is delicious.\" And the critics come forward and say, \"That is perfectly done\u2014just as the rules of aesthetics demand.\" To be sure, a critic resembles a poet to a hair; he only lacks the anguish in his heart and the music upon his lips. I tell you, I would rather be a swineherd, understood by the swine, than be a poet and be misunderstood by men.\nI feel as if I were a piece in a game of chess, when my opponent says of it: That piece cannot be moved.\nMy life is like an eternal night...\nThe Rotation of Crops\nPeople with experience maintain that proceeding from a basic principle is the supposed starting point for all reasonable conduct. I will not impugn this position but merely remark that in order to justify it one must go back to a still more basic principle. The basic principle I am thinking of, however, is not a starting point for action but for inaction, and this principle is: All men are bores.", "source": "either_or.txt"}
