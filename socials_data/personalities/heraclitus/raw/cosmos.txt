This world, the same for all, neither any of the gods nor any man has made, but it always was, and is, and shall be, an ever living fire, kindled in due measure, and in due measure extinguished.
The transmutations of fire are, first, the sea; and of the sea, half is earth, and half the lightning flash.
All things are exchanged for fire and fire for all things, just as wares for gold and gold for wares.
Fire lives in the death of earth, air lives in the death of fire, water lives in the death of air, and earth in the death of water.
Fire coming upon all things, will sift and seize them.
The sun is new every day.
The sun will not overstep his bounds, for if he does, the Erinyes, helpers of justice, will find him out.
If there were no sun, it would be night.
Lightning rules all.
How can one escape that which never sets?
