The Absurd is born of this confrontation between the human need and the unreasonable silence of the world. This must not be forgotten. This must be clung to because the whole consequence of a life can depend on it. The irrational, the human nostalgia, and the absurd that is born of their encounter—these are the three characters in the drama that must necessarily end with all the logic of which an existence is capable.

The absurd is not in man (if such a metaphor could have a meaning) nor in the world, but in their presence together. For the moment it is the only bond uniting them. If I wish to remain faithful to that evidence, I must say that what is true of all the evils of the world is true of the absurd as well. It is impossible to escape it.

To explore the absurd is to understand that there is no 'higher meaning' to life, but that this lack of meaning does not dictate a lack of value. On the contrary, it liberates us. We are free to create our own meaning, to live with passion, to revolt against the inevitable end.
