{"text": "1. \"Cum Augustinus infantiam suam...\" The individual words in language name objects\u2014sentences are combinations of such names.\n2. That philosophical concept of meaning has its place in a primitive idea of the way language functions. But one can also say that it is the idea of a language more primitive than ours.\n7. We can also think of the whole process of using words in (2) as one of those games by means of which children learn their native language. I will call these games \"language-games\" and will sometimes speak of a primitive language as a language-game.\n11. Think of the tools in a tool-box: there is a hammer, pliers, a saw, a screw-driver, a rule, a glue-pot, glue, nails and screws.\u2014The functions of words are as diverse as the functions of these objects.\n19. It is easy to imagine a language consisting only of orders and reports in battle.\u2014Or a language consisting only of questions and expressions for answering yes and no. And innumerable others. And to imagine a language means to imagine a form of life.\n23. But how many kinds of sentence are there? Say assertion, question, and command?\u2014There are countless kinds: countless different kinds of use of what we call \"symbols\", \"words\", \"sentences\". And this multiplicity is not something fixed, given once for all; but new types of language, new language-games, as we may say, come into existence, and others become obsolete and get forgotten.\n43. For a large class of cases\u2014though not for all\u2014in which we employ the word \"meaning\" it can be defined thus: the meaning of a word is its use in the language.\n109. Philosophy is a battle against the bewitchment of our intelligence by means of language.\n309. What is your aim in philosophy?\u2014To shew the fly the way out of the fly-bottle.", "source": "philosophical_investigations.txt"}
