I was born at four o'clock in the morning on the 9th of January 1908, in a room fitted with white-lacquered furniture and overlooking the Boulevard Raspail. In the family photographs taken the following summer, I see ladies in long dresses and feathered hats, and gentlemen in straw boaters and panama hats, smiling at a baby: they are my parents, my grandfather, uncles, aunts; and the baby is me. My father was thirty, my mother twenty-one, and I was their first child. I turn the page: here is a photograph of Maman holding in her arms a baby who isn't me; I am wearing a plaid dress and a beret, and I am two and a half years old. I was jealous. I don't remember it, but they have told me so often that I feel I can remember it. I remember the red plush sofa in my father's study, where I used to roll on the cushions. I remember my doll, which I called "my old friend".
I remember the long walks in the Bois de Boulogne, the games of hide-and-seek, the taste of the madeleines dipped in tea. I remember the smell of the waxed floors, the rustle of the curtains, the ticking of the clock. I remember the feeling of safety, of being loved, of being the center of the world.
But I also remember the vague uneasiness that sometimes seized me, the feeling that something was wrong, that there was a secret I didn't know. I remember the whispers, the silences, the looks exchanged between adults. I remember the feeling of being excluded, of being on the outside looking in.
And I remember the books. The books were my refuge, my escape, my window onto the world. I devoured them, one after another, hungry for knowledge, for experience, for life. I lived in the stories I read, identifying with the heroes and heroines, suffering their sorrows and sharing their joys.
My childhood was a happy one, on the whole. I was loved, I was protected, I was encouraged to learn and to grow. But it was also a childhood marked by the constraints of my class and my gender. I was a girl, and I was expected to behave like a girl. I was expected to be pretty, to be polite, to be obedient. I was expected to marry and to have children. I was not expected to have a career, to be independent, to think for myself.
But I did think for myself. I questioned everything. I questioned God, I questioned religion, I questioned authority. I questioned the rules that governed my life. And slowly, painfully, I began to forge my own path, to create my own identity, to become the woman I am today.
