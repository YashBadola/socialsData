Preface

Not only in the world of commerce but also in the world of ideas our age is putting on a veritable clearance sale. Everything can be had so dirt cheap that one begins to wonder whether in the end anyone will want to make a bid. Every speculative price-fixer who conscientiously directs attention to the significant march of modern science, every assistant professor, tutor, and student, every crofter and cottar in philosophy, is not content with doubting everything but “goes further.” Perhaps it would be untimely and ill-timed to ask where they are going, but surely it is courteous and unobtrusive to take it for granted that they have doubted everything, since otherwise it would be queer to say that they were going further. This preliminary movement they have therefore all completed, and presumably with such ease that they do not think it necessary to waste a word on the how; for not even he who anxiously and with deep concern sought a little guidance from these veterans found a single hint, a single little dietetic prescription, with respect to how one is to comport oneself in this enormous task. “But Descartes did it.” Descartes, a venerable, humble, honest thinker, whose writings no one can read without being deeply affected—he did what he said and said what he did. Alas, alack, that is a great rarity in our times! Descartes, as he has frequently explained, did not doubt in matters of faith. “Memores tamen, ut jam dictum est, huic lumini naturali tamdiu tantum esse credendum, quamdiu nihil contrarium a Deo ipso revelatur. . . . Praeter caetera autem, memoriae nostrae pro summa regula est infigendum, ea quae nobis a Deo revelata sunt, ut omnium certissima esse credenda; et quamvis forte lumen rationis, quam maxime clarum et evidens, aliud quid nobis suggerere videretur, soli tamen auctoritati divinae potius quam proprio judicio fidem esse adhibendam.” He did not cry, “Fire!” and make it a duty for everyone to doubt, for Descartes was a quiet and solitary thinker, not a shouting street watchman; he let one know that he had doubted, but as for the rest, he said that his method had significance only for himself, and was partly based on his own earlier bungled knowledge. “Ne quis igitur putet me hic traditurum aliquam methodum, quam unusquisque sequi debeat ad recte regendum rationem; illam enim tantum quam ipsemet secutus sum exponere decrevi. . . . Sed simulac illud studiorum curriculum absolvi . . . totum planum mutavi consilium. . . . Quia enim pro unoquoque homine optimum est, se ipsum regere, quam celeriter illis, qui valde curiosi sunt, credere, etiamsi nonnulla valde vera dixerint.”

In our time, as was said, one does not stop with faith but goes further. It would perhaps be rash to ask where one is going, but it is surely a sign of breeding and culture for me to assume that everyone has faith, for otherwise it would be queer to speak of going further. In those old days it was different, then faith was a task for a whole lifetime, because it was assumed that dexterity in faith is not acquired in a few days or weeks. When the tried oldster drew near to his last hour, having fought the good fight and kept the faith, his heart was still young enough not to have forgotten that fear and trembling which chastened the youth, which the man indeed held in check, but which no man quite outgrows . . . except as he might succeed in going further as early as possible. The point where one arrives is capable of being reached by every one, the terrifying thing is only the starting point.

Problem I: Is there such a thing as a teleological suspension of the ethical?

The ethical as such is the universal, it applies to everyone, which may be expressed from another point of view by saying that it applies every instant. It reposes immanently in itself, it has nothing without itself which is its telos, but is itself telos for everything outside it, and when this has been incorporated by the ethical it can go no further. Conceived immediately as physical and psychical, the particular individual is the particular which has its telos in the universal, and its task is to express itself constantly in it, to abolish its particularity in order to become the universal. As soon as the individual would assert himself in his particularity over against the universal, he sins, and only by recognizing this can he again reconcile himself with the universal. Every time the individual after he has entered the universal asserts himself as the particular, he is in temptation (Anfechtung), and he can labor himself out of this only by abandoning himself as the particular in the universal. If this be the highest thing that can be said of man and of his existence, then the ethical has the same nature as man's eternal blessedness, which to all eternity and at every instant is his telos, since it would be a contradiction to say that this might be abandoned (i.e. teleologically suspended), seeing that as soon as it is suspended it is forfeited, whereas in other cases what is suspended is not forfeited but is preserved in the higher sphere which gives it its true place.

If such be the case, then Hegel is right when in his chapter on “The Good and the Conscience,” he characterizes man merely as the particular and regards this character as “a moral form of evil” which is to be annulled in the teleology of the moral, so that the individual who remains in this stage is either sinning or subjected to temptation (Anfechtung). On the other hand, he is wrong in talking of faith, wrong in not protesting loudly and clearly against the fact that Abraham enjoys honor and glory as the father of the faith, whereas he ought to be prosecuted and convicted as a murderer.

For faith is this paradox, that the particular is higher than the universal—yet in such a way, be it observed, that the movement repeats itself, and that consequently the individual, after having been in the universal, now as the particular isolates himself as higher than the universal. If this be not faith, then Abraham is lost, then faith has never existed in the world . . . because it has always existed. For if the ethical (i.e. the moral) is the highest thing, and if nothing incommensurable remains in man in any other way but as the evil (i.e. the particular which has to be expressed in the universal), then one needs no other categories than those which the Greek philosophers possessed or which can be deduced from them. This is what Hegel ought to have said, and then he would not have needed to appear to include what he had not included, or needed to apply the word “faith” to something which is not faith.

The story of Abraham contains therefore a teleological suspension of the ethical. As the individual he became higher than the universal. This is the paradox which does not permit of mediation. It is just as inexplicable how he got into it as it is inexplicable how he remained in it. If such is not the position of Abraham, then he is not even a tragic hero but a murderer. To want to continue to call him the father of faith, and then to speak of this to men who do not concern themselves with anything but words, is thoughtless. A man can become a tragic hero by his own powers—but not a knight of faith. When a man enters upon the way, in a certain sense the hard way of the tragic hero, many will be able to give him counsel; to him who follows the narrow way of faith no one can give counsel, him no one can understand. Faith is a miracle, and yet no man is excluded from it; for that in which all human life is unified is passion, and faith is a passion.
