This world, which is the same for all, no one of gods or men has made; but it was ever, is now, and ever shall be an ever-living Fire, with measures of it kindling, and measures going out.

The transformations of Fire are, first of all, sea; and half of the sea is earth, half whirlwind.

It is the thunderbolt that steers the course of all things.

All things are an exchange for Fire, and Fire for all things, even as wares for gold and gold for wares.

Fire in its advance will judge and convict all things.

Fire lives the death of air, and air lives the death of fire; water lives the death of earth, earth that of water.

The wise is one only. It is unwilling and willing to be called by the name of Zeus.

The sun is new every day.

The sun will not overstep his measures; if he does, the Erinyes, the handmaids of Justice, will find him out.
