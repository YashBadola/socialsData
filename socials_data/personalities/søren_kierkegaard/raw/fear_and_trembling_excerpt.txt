The Knight of Faith is the only happy man, the heir to the finite, while the Knight of Resignation is a stranger and a sojourner. But the Knight of Faith is no stranger; he is the heir, he belongs to the finite, and yet he has the infinite.

Infinite resignation is the last stage prior to faith, so that one who has not made this movement has not faith; for only in infinite resignation do I become clear to myself with respect to my eternal validity, and only then can there be question of grasping existence by virtue of faith.

The ethical expression for what Abraham did is that he would murder Isaac; the religious expression is that he would sacrifice Isaac—but precisely in this contradiction is the anxiety that can make a person sleepless, and yet without this anxiety Abraham is not who he is.

If there were no eternal consciousness in a man, if at the bottom of everything there were only a wild ferment, a power that twisting in dark passions produced everything great or inconsequential; if an unfathomable, insatiable emptiness lay hid beneath everything, what would life be but despair? If it were thus, if there were no sacred bond uniting mankind, if one generation arose after another like the leaves of the forest, if one generation replaced the other like the songs of birds in the woods, if the human race passed through the world as a ship through the sea or the wind through the desert, a thoughtless and fruitless whim, if an eternal oblivion always lurked hungrily for its prey and there was no power strong enough to wrest it from its clutches—how empty and devoid of comfort would life be! But for that reason it is not so; and as God created man and woman, so too He fashioned the hero and the poet or orator.

Faith is precisely this paradox, that the single individual is higher than the universal, yet in such a way, be it observed, that the movement repeats itself, and that consequently the single individual, after having been in the universal, now as the single individual isolates himself as higher than the universal. If this be not faith, then Abraham is lost, then faith has never existed in the world... because it has always existed.
