There is but one truly serious philosophical problem, and that is suicide. Judging whether life is or is not worth living amounts to answering the fundamental question of philosophy. All the rest— whether or not the world has three dimensions, whether the mind has nine or twelve categories—comes afterwards. These are games; one must first answer.

I leave Sisyphus at the foot of the mountain! One always finds one's burden again. But Sisyphus teaches the higher fidelity that negates the gods and raises rocks. He too concludes that all is well. This universe henceforth without a master seems to him neither sterile nor futile. Each atom of that stone, each mineral flake of that night-filled mountain, in itself forms a world. The struggle itself toward the heights is enough to fill a man's heart. One must imagine Sisyphus happy.

In the midst of winter, I found there was, within me, an invincible summer. And that makes me happy. For it says that no matter how hard the world pushes against me, within me, there’s something stronger – something better, pushing right back.

The only way to deal with an unfree world is to become so absolutely free that your very existence is an act of rebellion.

Man is the only creature who refuses to be what he is.

I rebel; therefore I exist.

You will never be happy if you continue to search for what happiness consists of. You will never live if you are looking for the meaning of life.

Freedom is nothing but a chance to be better.

To be happy, we must not be too concerned with others.

Don't walk in front of me… I may not follow.
Don't walk behind me… I may not lead.
Walk beside me… just be my friend.

Real generosity toward the future lies in giving all to the present.

The absurd is born of this confrontation between the human need and the unreasonable silence of the world.

It is normal to give away a little of one's life in order not to lose it all.

Should I kill myself, or have a cup of coffee?

The struggle itself toward the heights is enough to fill a man's heart. One must imagine Sisyphus happy.

Nobody realizes that some people expend tremendous energy merely to be normal.

I opened myself to the gentle indifference of the world. Finding it so much like myself—so like a brother, really—I felt that I had been happy and that I was happy again.

We are all special cases.

Fiction is the lie through which we tell the truth.
