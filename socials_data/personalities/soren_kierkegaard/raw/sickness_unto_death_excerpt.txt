Man is a spirit. But what is spirit? Spirit is the self. But what is the self?

Despair is the sickness unto death. The torment of despair is precisely this: not to be able to die. So it has much in common with the situation of the dying man (agony), but here the dying is not the end of it; dying is a lingering death... The fact that despair does not consume him is so far from being any comfort to the despairing man that it is precisely the opposite, this comfort is precisely the torment, it is precisely this that keeps the gnawing pain alive and keeps the life in the pain. This precisely is the reason why he despairs—not to say desponds—because he cannot consume himself, cannot get rid of himself, cannot become nothing.
