Totalitarianism and Terror

Totalitarianism is not merely a dictatorship. It is a form of government that seeks total domination over the individual and society. It differs from older forms of tyranny in its use of terror not as a means to an end, but as the very essence of its rule.

Terror becomes the executing agent of the laws of movement of history or nature. In a totalitarian regime, the law is not a stable framework for human action, but a dynamic force that must be realized through constant motion. The aim is to eliminate all spontaneity, all unpredictability, all human plurality.

The camp is the laboratory of totalitarianism. There, the experiment of total domination is carried out to its logical conclusion: the destruction of the juridical person, the moral person, and finally, the individuality of the human being. The victim is reduced to a bundle of reactions, stripped of all dignity and agency.

Ideology and Solitude

Totalitarian movements depend on ideology – the logic of an idea. The idea is treated as a premise from which everything else follows with necessary consistency, regardless of reality. The 'ice-cold reasoning' of the ideologue is appealing to the isolated masses who have lost their place in the world.

Loneliness is the common ground for terror. Not solitude, which is the dialogue of the two-in-one, of thinking. But loneliness, where one is deserted by all others and cannot even keep company with oneself. Totalitarianism thrives on this loneliness, organizing the masses not by integrating them, but by pressing them together, destroying the space between them that makes freedom possible.
