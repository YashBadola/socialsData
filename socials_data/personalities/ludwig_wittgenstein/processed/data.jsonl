{"text": "1 The world is all that is the case.\n1.1 The world is the totality of facts, not of things.\n1.11 The world is determined by the facts, and by their being all the facts.\n1.12 For the totality of facts determines what is the case, and also whatever is not the case.\n1.13 The facts in logical space are the world.\n1.2 The world divides into facts.\n1.21 Any one can either be the case or not be the case and everything else remain the same.\n2 What is the case--a fact--is the existence of states of affairs.\n2.01 A state of affairs (a state of things) is a combination of objects (things).\n2.011 It is essential to things that they should be possible constituents of states of affairs.\n2.012 In logic nothing is accidental: if a thing can occur in a state of affairs, the possibility of the state of affairs must be written into the thing itself.\n7 Whereof one cannot speak, thereof one must be silent.", "source": "tractatus_excerpt.txt"}
{"text": "1. \"Excalibur\" is a sharp bright sword. \"Excalibur\" is a proper name.\n2. But what does it mean to say that \"Excalibur\" has a meaning?\n3. Think of the tools in a tool-box: there is a hammer, pliers, a saw, a screw-driver, a rule, a glue-pot, glue, nails and screws.--The functions of words are as diverse as the functions of these objects. (And in both cases there are similarities.)\n4. Of course, what confuses us is the uniform appearance of words when we hear them spoken or meet them in script and print. For their application is not presented to us so clearly. Especially when we are doing philosophy!\n5. It is like looking into the cabin of a locomotive. We see handles all looking more or less alike. (Naturally, since they are all supposed to be handled.) But one is the handle of a crank which can be moved continuously (it regulates the opening of a valve); another is the handle of a switch, which has only two effective positions, it is either off or on; a third is the handle of a brake-lever, the harder one pulls on it, the harder it brakes; a fourth, the handle of a pump: it has an effect only so long as it is moved to and fro.\n6. The meaning of a word is its use in the language.\n7. And the meaning of a name is sometimes explained by pointing to its bearer.", "source": "investigations_excerpt.txt"}
