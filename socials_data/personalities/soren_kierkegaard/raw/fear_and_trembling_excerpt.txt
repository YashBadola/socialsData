Excerpt from Fear and Trembling:

Not one shall be forgotten who was great in the world. But each was great in his own way, and each in proportion to the greatness of that which he loved. For he who loved himself became great by himself, and he who loved other men became great by his selfless devotion, but he who loved God became greater than all. Everyone shall be remembered, but each became great in proportion to his expectation. One became great by expecting the possible, another by expecting the eternal, but he who expected the impossible became greater than all.

There was one who was great by reason of his power, and one who was great by reason of his wisdom, and one who was great by reason of his hope, and one who was great by reason of his love; but Abraham was greater than all, great by reason of his power whose strength is impotence, great by reason of his wisdom whose secret is foolishness, great by reason of his hope whose form is madness, great by reason of his love which is hatred of oneself.

By faith Abraham did not renounce his claim upon Isaac, but by faith he got Isaac. By faith Abraham received the promise that in his seed all races of the world would be blessed. Time passed, the possibility was there, Abraham believed; time passed, it became unreasonable, Abraham believed. There was one who was great in his expectation of the possible; there was one who was great in his expectation of the eternal; but he who expected the impossible became greater than all.

The Knight of Faith is the only happy man, the heir to the finite, while the Knight of Resignation is a stranger and a sojourner. But the Knight of Faith knows that it is glorious to belong to the infinite and that the only thing that can save him is the absurd, and this he grasps by faith.

The ethical expression for what Abraham did is that he would murder Isaac; the religious expression is that he would sacrifice Isaac. But precisely in this contradiction is the dread which can well make a man sleepless, and yet Abraham is not what he is without this dread. Or if he is not the one I speak of, then he is a murderer, and we want no repetition of that story.

Faith is precisely this paradox, that the individual as the particular is higher than the universal, is justified over against it, is not subordinate but superior—yet in such a way, be it observed, that it is the particular individual who, after he has been subordinated as the particular to the universal, now through the universal becomes the individual who as the particular is superior to the universal, for the fact that the individual as the particular stands in an absolute relation to the absolute.

This position cannot be mediated, for all mediation comes about precisely by virtue of the universal; it is and remains to all eternity a paradox, inaccessible to thought. And yet faith is this paradox—or else (these are the two horns of the dilemma which I have often struck, but which I have never heard so much as a whisper of from the System-makers)—or else faith has never existed in the world because it has always existed, or else Abraham is lost.
