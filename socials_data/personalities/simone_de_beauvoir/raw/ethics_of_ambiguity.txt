The wish for being is reserved for man alone; it is a wish that he cannot fulfill, but which he cannot cease to entertain. But this failure is not a defeat; it is the condition of his existence. Man exists only insofar as he is not; he is a disclosure of being, and he can disclose being only by being a lack of being. It is this lack which makes freedom possible.

If the satisfaction of the old man is not to be a mere stagnation, it must imply the movement of an indefinite transcendence; but if he has no future before him, if he is cut off from the world, this transcendence falls into a void. It is only in the presence of others that one can truly exist.

The man who seeks to justify his life must want freedom itself absolutely and above everything else. At the same time that it requires the realization of concrete ends, of particular projects, it requires itself universally. It is not a ready-made value which offers itself from the outside to my abstract adherence, but it appears (not on the plane of facility, but on the moral plane) as a cause of itself.

To will oneself free is also to will others free. This is not an abstract formula. It points out to each individual that his freedom is not a solitary privilege but is linked to the freedom of all men. We can not be truly free unless we are surrounded by free men.

The ambiguity of the human condition is that man is at once a physical object, a thing among things, and a consciousness, a freedom. He is a sovereign subject and an object for others. He is an individual, and part of a collectivity. He is alive, and he will die. Ethics does not consist in denying this ambiguity, but in assuming it. To assume it is to refuse to flee into the illusion of an absolute, whether it be the absolute of God, of Nature, or of History. It is to accept the risk of existence, the risk of failure, the risk of freedom.

There is no justification for existence other than its own expansion. Life is occupied in both perpetuating itself and in surpassing itself; if all it does is maintain itself, then living is only not dying.
