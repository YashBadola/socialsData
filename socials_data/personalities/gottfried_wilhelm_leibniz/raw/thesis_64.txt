64. Therefore every organic body of a living being is a kind of divine
   machine or natural automaton, infinitely surpassing all artificial
   automatons. Because a machine constructed by man's skill is not a
   machine in each of its parts; for instance, the teeth of a brass wheel
   have parts or bits which to us are not artificial products and contain
   nothing in themselves to show the use to which the wheel was destined
   in the machine. The machines of nature, however, that is to say, living
   bodies, are still machines in their smallest parts ad infinitum. Such
   is the difference between nature and art, that is to say, between
   divine art and ours.
