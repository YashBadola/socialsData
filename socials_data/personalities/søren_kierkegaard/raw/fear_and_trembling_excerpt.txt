PREFACE

Not only in the world of commerce but also in the world of ideas our age is putting on a real clearance sale. Everything may be had at such a bargain that it is doubtful whether in the end there is anybody who will want to bid. Every speculative price-fixer who conscientiously directs attention to the significant march of modern philosophy, every privat-docent, tutor, and student, every crofter and cottar in philosophy, is not content with doubting everything but goes further. Perhaps it would be untimely and ill-timed to ask them where they are going, but surely it is courteous and assumes no responsibility to inquire whether they have doubted everything, since otherwise it is odd of them to say they are going further. Having made this preliminary movement, they have scarcely verified the saying of Descartes and did not act on the principle that the beginning of wisdom is doubt, but that one must start with doubt and then go further.

This position cannot be mediated, for all mediation comes about precisely by virtue of the universal; it is and remains to all eternity a paradox, inaccessible to thought. And yet faith is this paradox—or else (these are the logical consequences which I would beg the reader to judge) there never has been faith...

ABRAHAM AND ISAAC

...But Abraham believed. He did not believe that he should be happy sometime in the hereafter, but that he should find blessedness here in this world. God could give him a new Isaac, could bring the sacrificial offering back to life. He believed by virtue of the absurd; for all human calculation had long since ceased...

It is great to give up one's wish, but it is greater to hold it fast after having given it up, it is great to grasp the eternal, but it is greater to hold fast to the temporal after having given it up.
