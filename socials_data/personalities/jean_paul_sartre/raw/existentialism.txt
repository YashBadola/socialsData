Man is condemned to be free; because once thrown into the world, he is responsible for everything he does.
It is up to you to give [life] a meaning.
Freedom is what you do with what's been done to you.
If you are lonely when you're alone, you are in bad company.
There is no traced-out path to lead man to his salvation; he must invent his own path. But, to invent it, he is free, responsible, without excuse, and every hope lies within him.
We do not know what we want and yet we are responsible for what we are - that is the fact.
Everything has been figured out, except how to live.
Hell is other people.
I exist, that is all, and I find it nauseating.
Man is nothing else but that which he makes of himself.
When we say that man chooses himself, we do mean that every one of us must choose himself; but by that we also mean that in choosing for himself he chooses for all men.
To be is to be chosen.
I am responsible for everything ... except for my very responsibility, for I am not the foundation of my being. Therefore everything takes place as if I were compelled to be responsible. I am abandoned in the world ... in the sense that I find myself suddenly alone and without help, engaged in a world for which I bear the whole responsibility without being able, whatever I do, to tear myself away from this responsibility for an instant.
The best work could not be guaranteed against the malice of things or of men, but it must be taken upon oneself.
To choose this or that is to affirm at the same time the value of what we choose.
Our responsibility is much greater than we might have supposed, because it concerns mankind as a whole.
I cannot make liberty my aim unless I make that of others equal in aim as well.
One always dies too soon - or too late. And yet one's whole life is complete at that moment, with a line drawn neatly under it, ready for the summing up. You are - your life, and nothing else.
Words are loaded pistols.
Like all dreamers, I mistook disenchantment for truth.
We are our choices.
Life begins on the other side of despair.
