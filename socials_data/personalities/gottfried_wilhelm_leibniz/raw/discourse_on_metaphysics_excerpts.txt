The most widely accepted and meaningful notion we have of God is expressed well enough in these words: that God is an absolutely perfect being; but the consequences of these words are not sufficiently considered; and in order to go further into the matter, it is necessary to remark that there are several entirely different perfections in nature, that God possesses all of them together, and that he possesses each one in the highest degree.

We must also know what a perfection is. One thing which can surely be affirmed about it is that those forms or natures which are not susceptible of the highest degree are in no way perfections, as for example the nature of number or of figure. For the number which is the greatest of all (that is, the sum of all the numbers), and the figure which is the greatest of all, imply contradictions. The greatest knowledge, however, and the greatest power do not imply any contradiction. Consequently power and knowledge are perfections, and insofar as they belong to God they have no limits.

It follows from this that God, possessing supreme and infinite wisdom, acts in the most perfect manner not only metaphysically, but also morally speaking. And with respect to ourselves it can be said that the more we are enlightened and informed in regard to the works of God the more will we be disposed to find them excellent and conforming entirely to that which we might desire.

Thus I am far from subscribing to the opinion of those who maintain that there are no principles of goodness or perfection in the nature of things, or in the ideas which God has about them, and who say that the works of God are good only through the formal reason that God has made them. If this were so, God, knowing that he is the author, would not be required to regard them afterwards and find them good, as the Holy Scripture testifies.

It seems to me that the consequences of this opinion are contrary to the love of God. For why should one praise him for what he has done, if he would be equally praiseworthy in doing the contrary? Where will be his justice and his wisdom if he has only a certain despotic power, if arbitrary will takes the place of reasonableness, and if in accord with the definition of tyrants, justice consists in that which is pleasing to the most powerful?

It is true that the supreme felicity (by whatever name it is called) can never be separated from the love of God. But does it not happen that men who are very virtuous and very pious and who believe that they have the love of God are not always fortunate and happy? We must assume, therefore, that this love of God is not sufficient for a complete happiness if it is not accompanied by knowledge and by the enjoyment of the universal good.

Thus, to conclude, I say that God is the monarch of the most perfect republic composed of all the spirits, and that the happiness of this city of God constitutes his principal purpose.
