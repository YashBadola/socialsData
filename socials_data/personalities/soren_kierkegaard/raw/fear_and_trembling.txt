Preface

Not only in the world of commerce but also in the world of ideas our age is putting on a real clearance sale. Everything can be had at such a bargain that it is doubtful whether in the end there is anyone who will want to bid. Every speculative price-fixer who conscientiously directs attention to the significant march of modern philosophy, every assistant professor, tutor, and student, every crofter and cottager in philosophy, is not content with doubting everything but goes further. It might be premature and almost ill-bred to ask them where they are going, but it is certainly polite and taken for granted that they have doubted everything, since otherwise it would be a curious speech for them to make, that they have proceeded further. This movement they have made, by which they have proceeded further, they have consequently made either in the beginning or have made it earlier. If they have made it in the beginning, then they have never doubted, and consequently they have never made the movement of doubting, and consequently they have never proceeded further. If they have made it earlier, then it must have been in childhood, but at that time one is not sufficiently developed to be able to doubt.

Whatever one may say, it is certain that I am no philosopher. I am a poetic and elegant thinker who writes for the few. I have not understood the System, whether it is because I am not clever enough or because the System is not clever enough, creating a noise like the man who entered the fish market and shouted "Silence!"

Problem I: Is there such a thing as a teleological suspension of the ethical?

The ethical as such is the universal, and as the universal it applies to everyone, which may be expressed from another point of view by saying that it applies at every instant. It rests immanent in itself, has nothing outside itself which is its telos, but is itself telos for everything outside it, and when this has been incorporated by the ethical it can go no further. Conceived immediately as physical and psychical, the particular individual is the particular which has its telos in the universal, and its task is to express itself constantly in it, to abolish its particularity in order to become the universal. As soon as the individual would assert himself in his particularity over against the universal, he sins, and only by recognizing this can he again reconcile himself with the universal.

But faith is precisely this paradox, that the individual as the particular is higher than the universal, is justified over against it, is not subordinate but superior—yet in such a way, be it observed, that it is the particular individual who, after he has been subordinated as the particular to the universal, now through the universal becomes the individual who as the particular is superior to the universal, for the fact that the individual as the particular stands in an absolute relation to the absolute. This position cannot be mediated, for all mediation comes about precisely by virtue of the universal; it is and remains to all eternity a paradox, inaccessible to thought. And yet faith is this paradox—or else (these are the logical deductions which I would beg the reader to have in mente at every point, though it would be too prolix for me to reiterate them on every occasion)—or else there never has been faith...

The story of Abraham contains therefore a teleological suspension of the ethical. As the individual he became higher than the universal. This is the paradox which does not permit of mediation. It is just as inexplicable how he got into it as it is inexplicable how he remained in it. If such is not the position of Abraham, then he is not even a tragic hero but a murderer. To want to continue to call him the father of faith, to talk of this to people who do not concern themselves with anything but words, is thoughtless. A man can become a tragic hero by his own powers—but not a knight of faith. When a man enters upon the way, in a certain sense the hard way of the tragic hero, many will be able to give him counsel; to him who follows the narrow way of faith no one can give counsel, him no one can understand. Faith is a miracle, and yet no man is excluded from it; for that in which all human life is unified is passion, and faith is a passion.
