Title: Fear and Trembling
       A Dialectical Lyric

Author: Søren Kierkegaard (Johannes de Silentio)

PREFACE

Not only in the world of commerce but also in the world of ideas our age
is putting on a veritable clearance sale. Everything can be had so dirt
cheap that one begins to wonder whether in the end anyone will want to
make a bid. Every speculative price-fixer who conscientiously directs
attention to the significant march of modern philosophy, every
Privatdocent, tutor, and student, every crofter and cottar in philosophy,
is not content with doubting everything but goes further. Perhaps it would
be premature and untimely to ask them where they are going, but surely it
is courteous and modest to take it for granted that they have doubted
everything, since otherwise it would be queer of them to be going further.
This proceeding they have all performed with such ease that one does not
think the least bit about how they did it.

PRELUDE

Once upon a time there was a man who as a child had heard the beautiful
story about how God tempted Abraham, and how he endured temptation, kept
the faith, and a second time received again a son contrary to expectation.
When the man became older, he read the same story with even greater
admiration, for life had separated what had been united in the pious
simplicity of the child. The older he became, the more frequently his
mind reverted to that story, his enthusiasm became greater and greater,
and yet he was less and less able to understand the story. At last in his
interest for that he forgot everything else; his soul had only one wish,
to see Abraham, one longing, to have been witness to that event.

ABRAHAM AND ISAAC

By faith Abraham went out from the land of his fathers and became a
sojourner in the land of promise. He left one thing behind, took one thing
with him: he left his earthly understanding behind and took faith with him--
otherwise he would not have wandered forth but would have thought this
unreasonable. By faith he was a stranger in the land of promise, and
there was nothing to recall what was dear to him, but by its novelty
everything tempted his soul to melancholy yearning. And yet he was God's
elect, in whom the Lord was well pleased! Indeed, if he had been
disowned, cast off from God's grace, he could have comprehended it better;
but now it was like a mockery of him and of his faith. There was in the
world one who lived in expectation also. Time passed, the evening drew
nigh, he was not paltry enough to have forgotten his expectation,
therefore he had also not forgotten himself. Then he sorrowed, and
sorrow did not deceive him as life had done, it did what it could for
him, in the sweetness of sorrow he possessed his disappointed expectation.
It is human to sorrow, human to sorrow with the sorrowing, but it is
greater to keep faith, more wonderful to be one of the faithful.

But Abraham believed. Therefore he was young; for he who always hopes for
the best becomes old, and he who is always prepared for the worst becomes
old, but he who believes preserves an eternal youth. Praise be to that
story! For Sarah, though advanced in age, was young enough to desire the
pleasure of motherhood, and Abraham, though gray-haired, was young enough
to wish to be a father. In an outward respect the marvel consists in the
fact that it came to pass according to their expectation, in a deeper
sense the miracle of faith consists in the fact that Abraham and Sarah
were young enough to wish, and that faith had preserved their wish and
therewith their youth. He accepted the fulfillment of the promise, he
accepted it by faith, and it came to pass according to the promise and
according to his faith--for Moses smote the rock with his rod and the
waters gushed forth, but he did not believe.

PROBLEM I: IS THERE SUCH A THING AS A TELEOLOGICAL SUSPENSION OF THE ETHICAL?

The ethical as such is the universal, it applies to everyone, which may
be expressed from another point of view by saying that it applies every
instant. It reposes immanently in itself, it has nothing without itself
which is its telos, but is itself telos for everything outside it, and
when this has been incorporated by the ethical it can go no further.
Conceived immediately as physical and psychical, the particular
individual is the individual who has his telos in the universal, and
his ethical task is to express himself constantly in it, to abolish his
particularity in order to become the universal. As soon as the individual
would assert himself as the particular over against the universal, he
sins, and he only recognizes the universal by confessing his sin.

Faith is precisely this paradox, that the individual as the particular
is higher than the universal, is justified over against it, is not
subordinate but superior--yet in such a way, be it observed, that it is
the particular individual who, after he has been subordinated as the
particular to the universal, now through the universal becomes the
individual who as the particular is superior to the universal, for the
fact that the individual as the particular stands in an absolute relation
to the absolute. This position cannot be mediated, for all mediation
comes about precisely by virtue of the universal; it is and remains to
all eternity a paradox, inaccessible to thought.
