{"text": "The Sickness Unto Death\nPart First\nThe Sickness Unto Death is Despair\nA. That Despair is the Sickness Unto Death\nA. Despair is a Sickness in the Spirit, in the Self, and So It May Assume a Triple Form: in Despair at Not Being Conscious of Having a Self (Despair Improperly So Called); in Despair at Not Willing to Be Oneself; in Despair at Willing to Be Oneself.\nMan is spirit. But what is spirit? Spirit is the self. But what is the self? The self is a relation which relates itself to its own self, or it is that in the relation [which accounts for it] that the relation relates itself to its own self; the self is not the relation but [consists in the fact] that the relation relates itself to its own self. Man is a synthesis of the infinite and the finite, of the temporal and the eternal, of freedom and necessity, in short it is a synthesis. A synthesis is a relation between two factors. So regarded, man is not yet a self.\nIn the relation between two, the relation is the third term as a negative unity, and the two relate themselves to the relation, and in the relation to the relation; such a relation is that between soul and body, when man is regarded as soul. But if, on the contrary, the relation relates itself to its own self, the relation is then the positive third term, and this is the self.\nSuch a relation which relates itself to its own self (that is to say, a self) must either have constituted itself or have been constituted by another.\nIf this relation which relates itself to its own self is constituted by another, the relation doubtless is the third term, but this relation (the third term) is in turn a relation relating itself to that which constituted the whole relation.\nSuch a derived, constituted, relation is the human self, a relation which relates itself to its own self, and in relating itself to its own self relates itself to another. Hence it is that there can be two forms of despair properly so called. If the human self had constituted itself, there could be a question only of one form: not to will to be oneself, to will to get rid of oneself, but there could be no question of despair in willing to be oneself. This formula [i.e. that the self is constituted by another] is the expression for the total dependence of the relation (the self), the expression for the fact that the self cannot of itself attain and remain in equilibrium and rest by its own self, but only by relating itself to that Power which constituted it.\nB. The Possibility and Actuality of Despair\nIs despair an advantage or a defect? It is pure dialectically both the one and the other. If one were to stick to the abstract idea of despair, without thinking of any concrete despairer, one might say that it is an immense advantage. The possibility of this sickness is man's advantage over the beast, and this advantage distinguishes him far more essentially than the erect posture, for it implies the infinite erectness or loftiness of being spirit. The possibility of this sickness is man's advantage over the beast; to be aware of this sickness is the Christian's advantage over the natural man; to be cured of this sickness is the Christian's blessedness.", "source": "sickness_unto_death.txt"}
{"text": "Preface\nNot only in the world of commerce but also in the world of ideas our age is putting on a veritable clearance sale. Everything is to be had at such a bargain that it is doubtful whether in the end there is anyone who will want to bid. Every speculative price-fixer who conscientiously directs attention to the significant march of modern philosophy, every privat-docent, tutor, and student, every crofter and cottar in philosophy, is not content with doubting everything but goes further. Perhaps it would be untimely and ill-timed to ask them where they are going, but surely it is courteous and unobtrusive to assume that they have doubted everything, since otherwise it would be queer for them to be going further. Having made this preliminary movement, they have thus prepared themselves to follow the straight path of the System, and only when they have arrived at the end of it, only when they have reached the Truth, will they have time to doubt everything\u2014unless by that time they have forgotten how to doubt.\nWhatever one may think of this, it is certain that in our time we hear very little about faith. I do not mean to say that it is not preached in the churches, but it is preached in such a way that it seems as if the whole congregation knew what faith is, as if the only thing lacking were a little more fervour, a little more inwardness. But if this is so, then faith must be something very easy, something which perhaps even the most immediate of immediate men has. And yet in the old days it was different; faith was then a task for a whole lifetime, because it was assumed that proficiency in believing is not acquired in a few days or weeks. When the tried old soldier approaches the end of his life, he answers the young man who asks him about the way: \"It is long and hard.\" But nowadays everyone has faith, for everyone is going further.\nThe Story of Abraham\nThere was once a man who as a child had heard the beautiful story about how God tempted Abraham, and how he withstood the temptation, kept the faith, and a second time received a son contrary to expectation. When the child became older, he read the same story with even greater admiration, for life had separated what was united in the pious simplicity of the child. The older he became, the more frequently his thoughts turned to that story, his enthusiasm became greater and greater, and yet less and less could he understand the story. At last he forgot everything else in his thoughts of Abraham; his soul had but one wish, to see Abraham, one longing, to have been witness to that event. His desire was not to see the beautiful countries of the Orient, or the earthly glory of the Promised Land, or that god-fearing couple whose old age God had blessed, or the venerable figure of the aged patriarch, or the vigorous youth of Isaac, whom God had bestowed upon Abraham\u2014he wished to be present only when God tempted Abraham. He wished to see how Abraham lifted the knife.\nHe had not yet learned that there is a difference between the result and the way, and that the result is easier to understand than the way. He did not know that the result is the aesthetic, the way the ethical; that the result is the external, the way the internal; that the result is the finite, the way the infinite.", "source": "fear_and_trembling.txt"}
{"text": "Either/Or: A Fragment of Life\nDiapsalmata\nWhat is a poet? An unhappy man who in his heart harbors a deep anguish, but whose lips are so fashioned that the sighs and cries which pass over them are transformed into ravishing music. His fate is like that of the unfortunate victims whom the tyrant Phalaris imprisoned in a brazen bull, and slowly tortured over a steady fire; their cries could not reach the tyrant\u2019s ears so as to strike terror into his heart; when they reached him they sounded like sweet music. And men crowd about the poet and say to him, \"Sing for us soon again\"\u2014which is as much as to say, \"May new sufferings torment your soul, but may your lips be fashioned as before; for the cries would only distress us, but the music is delicious.\" And the critics come forward and say, \"That is perfectly done\u2014just as it should be, according to the rules of aesthetics.\" Now it is understood that a critic resembles a poet to a hair; he only lacks the anguish in his heart and the music upon his lips. Lo, therefore I would rather be a swineherd, understood by the swine, than a poet misunderstood by men.\n***\nI do not care for anything. I do not care to ride, for the exercise is too violent. I do not care to walk, for it is too strenuous. I do not care to lie down, for I should either have to remain lying, and I do not care to do that, or I should have to get up again, and I do not care to do that either. Summa summarum: I do not care at all.\n***\nMy life is like an eternal night; when will the day dawn? When will the morning star arise?\n***\nThe result of my life is simply nothing, a mood, a single color. My result is like the painting of the artist who was to paint a picture of the Israelites crossing the Red Sea. To this end, he painted the whole wall red, explaining that the Israelites had already crossed over, and that the Egyptians were drowned.\n***\nHow empty and meaningless life is. We bury a man; we follow him to the grave, we throw three spadefuls of earth over him; we ride out to the cemetery in a carriage, we ride home in a carriage; and we take comfort in thinking that a long life lies before us. How long? Seven times ten years? Why not seven times seventy years?\n***\nIf I were to wish for anything, I should not wish for wealth and power, but for the passionate sense of the potential, for the eye which, ever young and ardent, sees the possible. Pleasure disappoints, possibility never. And what wine is so sparkling, what so fragrant, what so intoxicating, as possibility!", "source": "either_or.txt"}
