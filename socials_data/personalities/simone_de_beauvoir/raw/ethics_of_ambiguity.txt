The wish for being is one of the most powerful of human desires. But the desire to be is also a desire for disclosure. This disclosure is the transition from being to existence.

Man is free; but his freedom is only real in so far as it is engaged in the world. To be free is not to have the power to do anything you like; it is to be able to surpass the given toward an open future. The existence of others is not a limit to my freedom, but the condition of it.

As long as there have been men and they have lived, they have all felt this tragic ambiguity of their condition, but as long as there have been philosophers and they have thought, most of them have tried to mask it. They have striven to reduce mind to matter, or to reabsorb matter into mind, or to merge them within a single substance. They have denied death, or made it a passage to another life.

Life occupies a very small place in the immense universe, and man is a very small place in life. But this living grain of dust is the center of the universe. Man is a being who makes himself a lack of being in order that there might be being.

Freedom is the source from which all significations and all values spring. It is the original condition of all justification of existence. The man who seeks to justify his life must want freedom itself absolutely and above everything else. At the same time that it requires the realization of concrete ends, of particular projects, it requires itself universally.
