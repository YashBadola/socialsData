PREFACE

Not only in the world of commerce but also in the world of ideas our age is putting on a veritable clearance sale. Everything is to be had at such a bargain that it is doubtful whether in the end there is anyone who will want to bid. Every speculative price-watcher who conscientiously signals the significant progress of modern philosophy, every assistant professor, tutor, and student, every crofter and cottar in philosophy, is not content with doubting everything but goes further. It might perhaps be untimely and ill-timed to ask them where they are going, but it is surely courteous and unobtrusive to take it for granted that they have doubted everything, since otherwise it would be queer for them to be going further. This motion of going further I have tried to express in the Preliminary Expectoration by the phrase “infinite resignation,” which is the last stage prior to faith, so that anyone who has not made this movement has not faith; for only in the infinite resignation do I become clear to myself with respect to my eternal validity, and only then can there be question of grasping existence by virtue of faith.

The story of Abraham is a strange one. He lived for seventy years in the land of his fathers, and then he heard a voice that commanded him to leave his home and his kindred. He obeyed. He wandered in the wilderness, he was a stranger in a strange land. He had been promised that he would be the father of a great nation, and yet he was childless. He waited. He waited twenty-five years. Then, when he was a hundred years old and his wife Sarah was ninety, the son of the promise was born. Isaac. The child of laughter. The joy of his old age.

And then, the test. The ordeal. God said to Abraham: "Take now thy son, thine only son Isaac, whom thou lovest, and get thee into the land of Moriah; and offer him there for a burnt offering upon one of the mountains which I will tell thee of."

What did Abraham think? What did he feel? We are told nothing of his inner turmoil. We only know that he rose up early in the morning, saddled his ass, and took two of his young men with him, and Isaac his son, and clave the wood for the burnt offering, and rose up, and went unto the place of which God had told him.

This is the movement of faith. It is not a rational decision. It is a paradox. Ethically, Abraham is a murderer. He is willing to kill his own son. But religiously, he is a knight of faith. He believes that God will not demand this of him, or that God will restore Isaac to him. He believes by virtue of the absurd.

The knight of faith is the only happy man, the heir to the finite, while the knight of resignation is a stranger and a foreigner. To be able to lose one's understanding and along with it everything finite, for which it is the stockbroker, and then to win the very same finite again by virtue of the absurd—this horrifies the soul, but that is the kind of leap the knight of faith makes.
