The ethical expression for what Abraham did is that he would murder Isaac; the religious expression is that he would sacrifice Isaac--but in this contradiction lies the very anguish that can indeed make a man sleepless, and yet Abraham is not what he is without this anguish. Or perhaps he is not the man for whom the poet weeps, but something else...

Faith is precisely this paradox, that the single individual is higher than the universal. It is the paradox that the single individual as the single individual stands in an absolute relation to the Absolute. This position cannot be mediated, for all mediation comes about precisely by virtue of the universal; it is and remains to all eternity a paradox, inaccessible to thought.

If faith does not make it a holy act to be willing to murder one's son, then let the same judgment be passed upon Abraham as upon every other man. But if faith does make it a holy act, then let us not be afraid of the paradox.

The knight of faith is the only happy man, the heir to the finite, while the knight of resignation is a stranger and a foreigner. But the knight of faith knows it is glorious to belong to the universal. He knows that it is beautiful and salutary to be the individual who translates himself into the universal, who edits, as it were, a pure and elegant edition of himself, as free from errors as possible and which everyone can read. He knows that it is refreshing to become intelligible to oneself in the universal so that he understands it and so that every individual who understands him understands the universal through him, and both rejoice in the security of the universal. He knows that it is beautiful to be born as the individual who has the universal as his home, his friendly abiding place, which at once welcomes him with open arms when he would tarry in it. But he knows also that higher than this there winds a solitary path, narrow and steep; he knows that it is terrible to be born outside the universal, to walk without meeting a single traveler. He knows that it is humanly speaking crazy and cannot be understood by anyone.
