Preface

Not only in the world of commerce but also in the world of ideas our age is putting on a veritable clearance sale. Everything may be had at such a bargain that it is questionable whether in the end there is anybody who will want to bid. Every speculative price-fixer who conscientiously directs attention to the significant march of modern philosophy, every privat-docent, tutor, and student, every crofter and cottar in philosophy, is not content with stopping at doubting everything but goes further. It might, perhaps, be untimely and ill-timed to ask them where they are going, but surely it is courteous and altogether proper to assume that they have doubted everything, since otherwise it would be queer for them to be going further. This preliminary movement they have therefore all of them made, and presumably with such ease that they do not think it necessary to waste a word about the how; for not even he who anxiously and with deep concern sought a little enlightenment by means of the renowned Straightway found this step particularly heavy or cause for anxiety.

...

Faith is precisely this paradox, that the single individual is higher than the universal, yet in such a way, be it observed, that the movement repeats itself, and that consequently the individual, after having been in the universal, now as the single individual sets himself apart as higher than the universal. If this be not faith, then Abraham is lost, then faith has never existed in the world...

The knight of faith is obliged to rely upon himself alone, he feels the pain of not being able to make himself intelligible to others, but he feels no vain desire to guide others. The pain is his assurance that he is in the right way, this pain he overcomes by passion.

...

The ethical expression for what Abraham did is that he would murder Isaac; the religious expression is that he would sacrifice Isaac--but in this contradiction lies the dread which can well make a man sleepless, and yet Abraham is not what he is without this dread.
