{"text": "Excerpt from The Sickness Unto Death (1849)\n\"The self is a relation that relates itself to itself or is the relation's relating itself to itself in the relation; the self is not the relation but that the relation relates itself to itself. A human being is a synthesis of the infinite and the finite, of the temporal and the eternal, of freedom and necessity, in short, a synthesis. A synthesis is a relation between two. Considered in this way, a human being is still not a self.\"\n\"Despair is the sickness unto death.\"\n\"To be unaware of being defined as a spirit is exactly the despair which is virtually the deathless dying.\"\n\"The formula that describes the state of the self when despair is completely rooted out is this: in relating itself to itself and in willing to be itself, the self rests transparently in the power that established it.\"", "source": "sickness_unto_death_excerpts.txt"}
{"text": "Excerpt from Either/Or (1843)\n\"What I really need is to get clear about what I must do, not what I must know, except insofar as knowledge must precede every act. What matters is to find a purpose, to see what it really is that God wills that I shall do; the crucial thing is to find a truth which is truth for me, to find the idea for which I am willing to live and die.\"\n\"Marry, and you will regret it; don\u2019t marry, you will also regret it; marry or don\u2019t marry, you will regret it either way.

This, gentlemen, is the essence of all philosophy.\"\n\"I see it all perfectly; there are two possible situations \u2014 one can either do this or that.

{"text": "Excerpt from Fear and Trembling (1843)\n\"Faith is precisely this paradox, that the single individual is higher than the universal. It is the paradox that the single individual as the single individual stands in an absolute relation to the absolute.\"\n\"If there were no eternal consciousness in a man, if at the foundation of all there lay only a wildly seething power which writhing with obscure passions produced everything that is great and everything that is insignificant, if a bottomless void never satiated lay hidden beneath all--what then would life be but despair?\"\n\"Infinite resignation is the last stage prior to faith, so that one who has not made this movement has not faith; for only in the infinite resignation do I become clear to myself with respect to my eternal validity, and only then can there be question of grasping existence by virtue of faith.\"\n\"Abraham is the knight of faith.\"", "source": "fear_and_trembling_excerpts.txt"}
