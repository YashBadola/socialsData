The Sickness Unto Death
A Christian Psychological Exposition for Upbuilding and Awakening

Part First
The Sickness Unto Death is Despair
I. That Despair is the Sickness Unto Death

A. Despair is a Sickness in the Spirit, in the Self, and so it may assume a triple form: in Despair at not being conscious of having a self (Despair improperly so called); in Despair at not willing to be oneself; in Despair at willing to be oneself.

Man is spirit. But what is spirit? Spirit is the self. But what is the self? The self is a relation which relates itself to its own self, or it is that in the relation [which accounts for it] that the relation relates itself to its own self; the self is not the relation but [consists in the fact] that the relation relates itself to its own self. Man is a synthesis of the infinite and the finite, of the temporal and the eternal, of freedom and necessity, in short it is a synthesis. A synthesis is a relation between two factors. So regarded, man is not yet a self.

In the relation between two, the relation is the third term as a negative unity, and the two relate themselves to the relation, and in the relation to the relation; such a relation is that between soul and body, when man is regarded as soul. If on the contrary the relation relates itself to its own self, the relation is then the positive third term, and this is the self.
Such a relation which relates itself to its own self (that is to say, a self) must either have constituted itself or have been constituted by another.
If this relation which relates itself to its own self is constituted by another, the relation doubtless is the third term, but this relation (the third term) is in turn a relation relating itself to that which constituted the whole relation.
Such a derived, constituted, relation is the human self, a relation which relates itself to its own self, and in relating itself to its own self relates itself to another. Hence it is that there can be two forms of despair properly so called. If the human self had constituted itself, there could be a question only of one form: not willing to be one's own self, of willing to get rid of oneself, but there could be no question of despair at willing to be oneself.

This form of despair (willing to be oneself) is the formula for all despair, so that the first form (not willing to be oneself) resolves itself into the second (willing to be oneself), just as in the foregoing we saw that the one form (despair at not willing to be oneself) resolves itself into the other (despair at willing to be oneself).

The formula that describes the state of the self when despair is completely rooted out is this: in relating itself to itself and in willing to be itself, the self rests transparently in the power that established it.

B. Possibility and Necessity
The self is the synthesis of possibility and necessity. The self is composed of finitude and infinitude. But this synthesis is not the self, it is the task.
If the self gets lost in possibility, it has no necessity to which it must return. It runs wild in possibility. But possibility is like a child who must be given something; necessity is like a grave man who takes something.
If the self gets lost in necessity, it has no possibility. The philistine is the man without possibility. He is the man who lives in the trivial. He lacks the imagination to see the possibility.
Faith is the specific remedy for this sickness. For with God all things are possible. The believer possesses the eternally certain antidote to despair: possibility.
