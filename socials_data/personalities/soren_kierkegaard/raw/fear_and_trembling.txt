Preface

Not only in the world of commerce but also in the world of ideas our age is organizing a regular clearance sale. Everything is to be had at such a bargain that it is questionable whether in the end there is anybody who will want to bid. Every speculative price-fixer who conscientiously directs attention to the significant march of modern philosophy, every privatdocent, tutor, and student, every crofter and cottar in philosophy, is not content with doubting everything but goes further. Perhaps it would be untimely and ill-timed to ask them where they are going, but surely it is courteous and assumes no responsibility to inquire: Where did they find the certainty that they have gone further? ...

The Story of Abraham

...Now Abraham was old, he was well stricken in years, and the Lord had given him Isaac. Then it happened one day that he sat in his tent and looked out, and he saw a man coming along the road, and the man was a stranger to him. But Abraham rose and went to meet him and bowed down before him and said, “Lord, do not pass by thy servant.” And the Stranger was God.

And God tempted Abraham and said unto him, “Take Isaac, thine only son, whom thou lovest, and get thee into the land of Moriah, and offer him there for a burnt offering upon one of the mountains which I will tell thee of.”

It was early in the morning, Abraham arose and saddled his ass, and took two of his young men with him, and Isaac his son; and he clave the wood for the burnt offering, and rose up, and went unto the place of which God had told him. On the third day Abraham lifted up his eyes and saw the place afar off. Then said Abraham unto his young men, “Abide ye here with the ass; and I and the lad will go yonder and worship, and come again to you.” And Abraham took the wood of the burnt offering and laid it upon Isaac his son; and he took the fire in his hand, and a knife; and they went both of them together. And Isaac spake unto Abraham his father and said, “My father.” And he said, “Here am I, my son.” And he said, “Behold the fire and the wood; but where is the lamb for a burnt offering?” And Abraham said, “My son, God will provide himself a lamb for a burnt offering.” So they went both of them together.

And they came to the place which God had told him of; and Abraham built an altar there, and laid the wood in order, and bound Isaac his son, and laid him on the altar upon the wood. And Abraham stretched forth his hand, and took the knife to slay his son.

Preliminary Expectoration

Although I am an outsider, completely uninitiated into the mysteries of the system, my relation to the system is not like that of the inhabitants of Hamelin to the Pied Piper. I am not magnetized by the flute-playing of the system-builders. I am not one of the young men who have sworn fidelity to the banner of the system. I am a freelancer who, if he had the capacity, would perhaps try to think something on his own account.

Faith is precisely this paradox, that the single individual is higher than the universal. If this is not faith, then Abraham is lost, then faith has never existed in the world...
