Faith is precisely this paradox, that the single individual is higher than the universal. It is not that he remains within the universal, but that he goes beyond it. If this is not faith, then Abraham is lost, then faith has never existed in the world... precisely because it is absurd. The Knight of Faith is the only happy man, the heir apparent to the finite, while the Knight of Resignation is a stranger and an alien. To have faith is to lose one's mind in order to win God.
