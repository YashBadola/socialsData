{"text": "When Zarathustra was thirty years old, he left his home and the lake of his home, and went into the mountains.\nThere he enjoyed his spirit and his solitude, and for ten years did not weary of it.\nBut at last his heart changed,\u2014and rising one morning with the rosy dawn, he went before the sun, and spake thus unto it:\n\u201cThou great star! What would be thy happiness if thou hadst not those for whom thou shinest!\nFor ten years hast thou climbed hither to my cave: thou wouldst have wearied of thy light and of the journey, had it not been for me, mine eagle, and my serpent.\nBut we awaited thee every morning, took from thee thy overflow and blessed thee for it.\nLo! I am weary of my wisdom, like the bee that hath gathered too much honey; I need hands outstretched to take it.\nI would fain bestow and distribute, until the wise have once more become joyous in their folly, and the poor happy in their riches.\nTherefore must I descend into the deep: as thou doest in the evening, when thou goest behind the sea, and givest light also to the nether-world, thou exuberant star!\nLike thee must I go down, as men say, to whom I shall descend.\nBless me, then, thou tranquil eye, that canst behold even the greatest happiness without envy!\nBless the cup that is about to overflow, that the water may flow golden out of it, and carry everywhere the reflection of thy bliss!\nLo! This cup is again going to empty itself, and Zarathustra is again going to become a man.\u201d\nThus began Zarathustra\u2019s down-going.", "source": "zarathustra_prologue.txt"}
