It is this: the individual words in language name objects\u2014sentences are combinations of such names. In this picture of language we find the roots of the following idea: Every word has a meaning. This meaning is correlated with the word. It is the object for which the word stands.\n2. That philosophical concept of meaning has its place in a primitive idea of the way language functions. But one can also say that it is the idea of a language more primitive than ours. Let us imagine a language for which the description given by Augustine is right. The language is meant to serve for communication between a builder A and an assistant B. A is building with building-stones: there are blocks, pillars, slabs and beams. B has to pass the stones, and that in the order in which A needs them. For this purpose they use a language consisting of the words \"block\", \"pillar\", \"slab\", \"beam\". A calls them out; \u2014B brings the stone which he has learnt to bring at such-and-such a call. \u2014Conceive this as a complete primitive language.\n7. In the practice of the use of language (2) one party calls out the words, the other acts on them. In instruction in the language the following process will occur: the learner names the objects; that is, he utters the word when the teacher points to the stone.\u2014And there will be this still simpler exercise: the teacher points to the objects and utters the words. We can also think of the whole process of using words in (2) as one of those games by means of which children learn their native language. I will call these games \"language-games\" and will sometimes speak of a primitive language as a language-game.\n11. Think of the tools in a tool-box: there is a hammer, pliers, a saw, a screw-driver, a rule, a glue-pot, glue, nails and screws.\u2014The functions of words are as diverse as the functions of these objects. (And in both cases there are similarities.)\n19. It is easy to imagine a language consisting only of orders and reports in battle.\u2014Or a language consisting only of questions and expressions for answering yes and no. And innumerable others. To imagine a language means to imagine a form of life.\n23. But how many kinds of sentence are there? Say assertion, question, and command?\u2014There are countless kinds: countless different kinds of use of what we call \"symbols\", \"words\", \"sentences\". And this multiplicity is not something fixed, given once for all; but new types of language, new language-games, as we may say, come into existence, and others become obsolete and get forgotten.\n43. For a large class of cases\u2014though not for all\u2014in which we employ the word \"meaning\" it can be defined thus: the meaning of a word is its use in the language.\n109. Philosophy is a battle against the bewitchment of our intelligence by means of language.\n119. The results of philosophy are the uncovering of one or another piece of plain nonsense and of bumps that the understanding has got by running its head up against the limits of language. These bumps make us see the value of the discovery.\n123. A philosophical problem has the form: \"I don't know my way about\".\n255. The philosopher treats a question; like an illness.\n309. What is your aim in philosophy?\u2014To shew the fly the way out of the fly-bottle.", "source": "philosophical_investigations.txt"}

What is thinkable is also possible.\n3.03 We cannot think anything unlogical, for otherwise we should have to think unlogically.\n4 The thought is the significant proposition.\n4.001 The totality of propositions is the language.\n4.002 Man possesses the capacity of constructing languages, in which every sense can be expressed, without having an idea how and what each word means\u2014just as one speaks without knowing how the single sounds are produced.\n4.003 Most proposition and questions, that have been written about philosophical matters, are not false, but senseless. We cannot, therefore, answer questions of this kind at all, but only state their senselessness. Most questions and propositions of the philosophers result from the fact that we do not understand the logic of our language.\n4.116 Everything that can be thought at all can be thought clearly. Everything that can be said can be said clearly.\n5.6 The limits of my language mean the limits of my world.\n6.54 My propositions are elucidatory in this way: he who understands me finally recognizes them as senseless, when he has climbed out through them, on them, over them.
