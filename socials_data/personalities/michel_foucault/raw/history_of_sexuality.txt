It is said that no society has been more prudish for a long time than ours, and that since the beginning of the seventeenth century, a veritably exuberant explosion of unorthodox sexualities has been followed by a twilight of repression. But this is the 'repressive hypothesis'. The question I would like to pose is not, Why are we repressed? but rather, Why do we say, with so much passion and so much resentment against our most recent past, against our present, and against ourselves, that we are repressed?

By what spiral did we come to affirm that sex is the secret? What is this 'will to knowledge' that has not only made sex the object of a science but has also invested it with a power that forces it to speak?
The history of sexuality—that is, the history of what functioned in the nineteenth century as a specific field of truth—must first be written from the viewpoint of a history of discourses.

Power is everywhere; not because it embraces everything, but because it comes from everywhere. And "Power," insofar as it is permanent, repetitious, inert, and self-reproducing, is simply the over-all effect that emerges from all these mobilities, the concatenation that rests on each of them and seeks in turn to arrest their movement.

Where there is power, there is resistance, and yet, or rather consequently, this resistance is never in a position of exteriority in relation to power. One is always "inside" power, there is no "escaping" it, there is no absolute outside where it is concerned, because one is subject to the law in any case. The existence of power relations depends on a multiplicity of points of resistance: these play the role of adversary, target, support, or handle in power relations. These points of resistance are present everywhere in the power network.
