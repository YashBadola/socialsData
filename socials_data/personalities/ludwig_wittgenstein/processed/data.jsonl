Hoc autem eos velle ex motu corporis aperiebatur: tamquam verbis naturalibus omnium gentium, quae fiunt vultu et nutu oculorum, ceterorumque membrorum actu, et sonitu vocis indicante affectionem animi in petendis, habendis, rejiciendis, fugiendisve rebus. Ita verba in variis sententiis locis suis posita, et crebro audita, quarum rerum signa essent, paulatim colligebam, measque jam voluntates, edomito in eis signis ore, per haec enuntiabam.\" (Augustine, Confessions, I. 8.)\nThese words, it seems to me, give us a particular picture of the essence of human language. It is this: the individual words in language name objects -- sentences are combinations of such names. In this picture of language we find the roots of the following idea: Every word has a meaning. This meaning is correlated with the word. It is the object for which the word stands.\nAugustine does not speak of there being any difference between kinds of word. If you describe the learning of language in this way you are, I believe, thinking primarily of nouns like \"table\", \"chair\", \"bread\", and of people's names, and only secondarily of the names of certain actions and properties; and of the remaining kinds of word as something that will take care of itself.\nNow think of the following use of language: I send someone shopping. I give him a slip marked \"five red apples\". He takes the slip to the shopkeeper, who opens the drawer marked \"apples\"; then he looks up the word \"red\" in a table and finds a colour sample opposite it; then he says the series of cardinal numbers--I assume that he knows them by heart--up to the word \"five\" and for each number he takes an apple of the same colour as the sample out of the drawer. -- It is in this and similar ways that one operates with words. -- \"But how does he know where and how he is to look up the word 'red' and what he is to do with the word 'five'?\" -- Well, I assume that he acts as I have described. Explanations come to an end somewhere. -- But what is the meaning of the word \"five\"? -- No such thing was in question here, only how the word \"five\" is used.\n23. But how many kinds of sentence are there? Say assertion, question, and command? -- There are countless kinds: countless different kinds of use of what we call \"symbols\", \"words\", \"sentences\". And this multiplicity is not something fixed, given once for all; but new types of language, new language-games, as we may say, come into existence, and others become obsolete and get forgotten. (We can get a rough picture of this from the changes in mathematics.)\nHere the term \"language-game\" is meant to bring into prominence the fact that the speaking of language is part of an activity, or of a form of life.\nReview the multiplicity of language-games in the following examples, and in others:\nGiving orders, and obeying them --\nDescribing the appearance of an object, or giving its measurements --\nConstructing an object from a description (a drawing) --\nReporting an event --\nSpeculating about an event --\nForming and testing a hypothesis --\nPresenting the results of an experiment in tables and diagrams --\nMaking up a story; and reading it --\nPlay-acting --\nSinging catches --\nGuessing riddles --\nMaking a joke; telling it --\nSolving a problem in practical arithmetic --\nTranslating from one language into another --\nAsking, thanking, cursing, greeting, praying.", "source": "philosophical_investigations.txt"}
