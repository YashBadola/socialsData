2 What is the case--a fact--is the existence of states of affairs.


2.01 A state of affairs (a state of things) is a combination of objects
(things).


2.011 It is essential to things that they should be possible constituents
of states of affairs.


2.012 In logic nothing is accidental: if a thing can occur in a state of
affairs, the possibility of the state of affairs must be written into the
thing itself.


2.0121 It would seem to be a sort of accident, if it turned out that a
situation would fit a thing that could already exist entirely on its own.
If things can occur in states of affairs, this possibility must be in them
from the beginning. (Nothing in the province of logic can be merely
possible. Logic deals with every possibility and all possibilities are its
facts.) Just as we are quite unable to imagine spatial objects outside
space or temporal objects outside time, so too there is no object that we
can imagine excluded from the possibility of combining with others. If I
can imagine objects combined in states of affairs, I cannot imagine them
excluded from the possibility of such combinations.


2.0122 Things are independent in so far as they can occur in all possible
situations, but this form of independence is a form of connexion with
states of affairs, a form of dependence. (It is impossible for words to
appear in two different roles: by themselves, and in propositions.)


2.0123 If I know an object I also know all its possible occurrences in
states of affairs. (Every one of these possibilities must be part of the
nature of the object.) A new possibility cannot be discovered later.


2.01231 If I am to know an object, thought I need not know its external
properties, I must know all its internal properties.


2.0124 If all objects are given, then at the same time all possible states
of affairs are also given.


2.013 Each thing is, as it were, in a space of possible states of affairs.
This space I can imagine empty, but I cannot imagine the thing without the
space.


2.0131 A spatial object must be situated in infinite space. (A spatial
point is an argument-place.) A speck in the visual field, thought it need
not be red, must have some colour: it is, so to speak, surrounded by colour-
space. Notes must have some pitch, objects of the sense of touch some
degree of hardness, and so on.


2.014 Objects contain the possibility of all situations.


2.0141 The possibility of its occurring in states of affairs is the form of
an object.


2.02 Objects are simple.


2.0201 Every statement about complexes can be resolved into a statement
about their constituents and into the propositions that describe the
complexes completely.


2.021 Objects make up the substance of the world. That is why they cannot
be composite.


2.0211 If they world had no substance, then whether a proposition had sense
would depend on whether another proposition was true.


2.0212 In that case we could not sketch any picture of the world (true or
false).


2.022 It is obvious that an imagined world, however difference it may be
from the real one, must have something-- a form--in common with it.


2.023 Objects are just what constitute this unalterable form.


2.0231 The substance of the world can only determine a form, and not any
material properties. For it is only by means of propositions that material
properties are represented--only by the configuration of objects that they
are produced.


2.0232 In a manner of speaking, objects are colourless.


2.0233 If two objects have the same logical form, the only distinction
between them, apart from their external properties, is that they are
different.


2.02331 Either a thing has properties that nothing else has, in which case
we can immediately use a description to distinguish it from the others and
refer to it; or, on the other hand, there are several things that have the
whole set of their properties in common, in which case it is quite
impossible to indicate one of them. For it there is nothing to distinguish
a thing, I cannot distinguish it, since otherwise it would be distinguished
after all.


2.024 The substance is what subsists independently of what is the case.


2.025 It is form and content.


2.0251 Space, time, colour (being coloured) are forms of objects.


2.026 There must be objects, if the world is to have unalterable form.


2.027 Objects, the unalterable, and the subsistent are one and the same.


2.0271 Objects are what is unalterable and subsistent; their configuration
is what is changing and unstable.


2.0272 The configuration of objects produces states of affairs.


2.03 In a state of affairs objects fit into one another like the links of a
chain.


2.031 In a state of affairs objects stand in a determinate relation to one
another.


2.032 The determinate way in which objects are connected in a state of
affairs is the structure of the state of affairs.


2.033 Form is the possibility of structure.


2.034 The structure of a fact consists of the structures of states of
affairs.


2.04 The totality of existing states of affairs is the world.


2.05 The totality of existing states of affairs also determines which
states of affairs do not exist.


2.06 The existence and non-existence of states of affairs is reality. (We
call the existence of states of affairs a positive fact, and their non-
existence a negative fact.)


2.061 States of affairs are independent of one another.


2.062 From the existence or non-existence of one state of affairs it is
impossible to infer the existence or non-existence of another.


2.063 The sum-total of reality is the world.


2.1 We picture facts to ourselves.


2.11 A picture presents a situation in logical space, the existence and non-
existence of states of affairs.


2.12 A picture is a model of reality.


2.13 In a picture objects have the elements of the picture corresponding to
them.


2.131 In a picture the elements of the picture are the representatives of
objects.


2.14 What constitutes a picture is that its elements are related to one
another in a determinate way.


2.141 A picture is a fact.


2.15 The fact that the elements of a picture are related to one another in
a determinate way represents that things are related to one another in the
same way. Let us call this connexion of its elements the structure of the
picture, and let us call the possibility of this structure the pictorial
form of the picture.


2.151 Pictorial form is the possibility that things are related to one
another in the same way as the elements of the picture.


2.1511 That is how a picture is attached to reality; it reaches right out
to it.


2.1512 It is laid against reality like a measure.


2.15121 Only the end-points of the graduating lines actually touch the
object that is to be measured.


2.1514 So a picture, conceived in this way, also includes the pictorial
relationship, which makes it into a picture.


2.1515 These correlations are, as it were, the feelers of the picture's
elements, with which the picture touches reality.


2.16 If a fact is to be a picture, it must have something in common with
what it depicts.


2.161 There must be something identical in a picture and what it depicts,
to enable the one to be a picture of the other at all.


2.17 What a picture must have in common with reality, in order to be able
to depict it--correctly or incorrectly--in the way that it does, is its
pictorial form.


2.171 A picture can depict any reality whose form it has. A spatial picture
can depict anything spatial, a coloured one anything coloured, etc.


2.172 A picture cannot, however, depict its pictorial form: it displays it.


2.173 A picture represents its subject from a position outside it. (Its
standpoint is its representational form.) That is why a picture represents
its subject correctly or incorrectly.


2.174 A picture cannot, however, place itself outside its representational
form.


2.18 What any picture, of whatever form, must have in common with reality,
in order to be able to depict it--correctly or incorrectly--in any way at
all, is logical form, i.e. the form of reality.


2.181 A picture whose pictorial form is logical form is called a logical
picture.


2.182 Every picture is at the same time a logical one. (On the other hand,
not every picture is, for example, a spatial one.)


2.19 Logical pictures can depict the world.


2.2 A picture has logico-pictorial form in common with what it depicts.


2.201 A picture depicts reality by representing a possibility of existence
and non-existence of states of affairs.


2.202 A picture contains the possibility of the situation that it
represents.


2.203 A picture agrees with reality or fails to agree; it is correct or
incorrect, true or false.


2.22 What a picture represents it represents independently of its truth or
falsity, by means of its pictorial form.


2.221 What a picture represents is its sense.


2.222 The agreement or disagreement or its sense with reality constitutes
its truth or falsity.


2.223 In order to tell whether a picture is true or false we must compare
it with reality.


2.224 It is impossible to tell from the picture alone whether it is true or
false.


2.225 There are no pictures that are true a priori.
