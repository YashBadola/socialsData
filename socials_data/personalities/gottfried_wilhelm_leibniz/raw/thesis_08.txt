8. Still monads need to have some qualities, otherwise they would not
   even be existences. And if simple substances did not differ at all in
   their qualities, there would be no means of perceiving any change in
   things. Whatever is in a compound can come into it only through its
   simple elements and the monads, if they were without qualities (since
   they do not differ at all in quantity) would be indistinguishable one
   from another. For instance, if we imagine a plenum or completely filled
   space, where each part receives only the equivalent of its own previous
   motion, one state of things would not be distinguishable from another.
