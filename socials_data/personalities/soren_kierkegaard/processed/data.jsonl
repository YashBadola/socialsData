{"text": "The possible corresponds exactly to the future. For freedom the possible is the future, and for time the future is the possible. Corresponding to both of these in the individual life is anxiety. A precise definition of anxiety would therefore be: anxiety is freedom's possibility.\nThe specific character of despair is precisely this: it is unaware of being despair.\nThe self is a relation that relates itself to itself or is the relation's relating itself to itself in the relation; the self is not the relation but that the relation relates itself to itself. A human being is a synthesis of the infinite and the finite, of the temporal and the eternal, of freedom and necessity, in short, a synthesis. A synthesis is a relation between two. Considered in this way, a human being is still not a self.\nTo be a self is the greatest concession made to man, but at the same time it is eternity's demand upon him.\nDespair is the Sickness Unto Death.", "source": "sickness_unto_death_excerpt.txt"}
{"text": "The crowd is untruth. There is therefore no one who has more contempt for what it is to be a human being than those who make it their profession to lead the crowd.\nPeople demand freedom of speech as a compensation for the freedom of thought which they seldom use.\nMost people are subjective toward themselves and objective toward all others, frightfully objective sometimes--but the task is precisely to be objective toward oneself and subjective toward all others.\nLife can only be understood backwards; but it must be lived forwards.\nIt is quite true what philosophy says: that life must be understood backwards. But that makes one forget the other saying: that it must be lived--forwards.\nThe thing is to understand myself, to see what God really wishes me to do; the thing is to find a truth which is true for me, to find the idea for which I can live and die.", "source": "journals_excerpt.txt"}
{"text": "If you marry, you will regret it; if you do not marry, you will also regret it; if you marry or do not marry, you will regret both; whether you marry or do not marry, you will regret both. Laugh at the world\u2019s follies, you will regret it; weep over them, you will also regret that; laugh at the world\u2019s follies or weep over them, you will regret both; whether you laugh at the world\u2019s follies or weep over them, you will regret both. Believe a woman, you will regret it; believe her not, you will also regret that; believe a woman or believe her not, you will regret both; whether you believe a woman or believe her not, you will regret both. Hang yourself, you will regret it; do not hang yourself, and you will also regret that; hang yourself or do not hang yourself, you will regret both; whether you hang yourself or do not hang yourself, you will regret both. This, gentlemen, is the essence of all philosophy.\nI say of my sorrow what the Englishman says of his house: my sorrow is my castle. Many consider that they have their sorrow when they have a heavy load of sorrow; but he who has the heavy load is not sorrowful, but he who has the light load is sorrowful.\nAnxiety is the dizziness of freedom.\nThe unhappiest man is the one who is unable to die.\nMy life is like an eternal night...\nWhat is a poet? An unhappy man who in his heart harbors a deep anguish, but whose lips are so fashioned that the sighs and cries which pass over them are transformed into ravishing music.", "source": "either_or_excerpt.txt"}
{"text": "The ethical expression for what Abraham did is that he would murder Isaac; the religious expression is that he would sacrifice Isaac; but precisely in this contradiction is the anxiety that can make a person sleepless, and yet without this anxiety Abraham is not who he is.\nFaith begins precisely where thinking leaves off.\nTo have faith is to lose your mind and to win God.\nIf there were no eternal consciousness in a man, if at the foundation of all there lay only a wildly seething power which writhing with obscure passions produced everything that is great and everything that is insignificant, if a bottomless void never satiated lay hidden beneath all--what then would life be but despair?\nBy faith Abraham did not renounce his claim upon Isaac, but by faith he got Isaac. By faith Abraham did not become a hero, but by faith he became a knight of resignation? No, he became a knight of faith.", "source": "fear_and_trembling_excerpt.txt"}
