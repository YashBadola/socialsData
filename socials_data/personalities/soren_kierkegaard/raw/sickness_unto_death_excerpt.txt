The self is a relation that relates itself to itself or is the relation's relating itself to itself in the relation; the self is not the relation but that the relation relates itself to itself. A human being is a synthesis of the infinite and the finite, of the temporal and the eternal, of freedom and necessity, in short, a synthesis. A synthesis is a relation between two. Considered in this way, a human being is still not a self.

Despair is the sickness unto death. It is not to die, but to die the death; to die and yet not die. It is a state of the self in which the self is misrelated to itself. To not want to be oneself is despair; to want to be oneself is also despair, if that self is not grounded in the Power that constituted it.

The formula that describes the state of the self when despair is completely rooted out is this: in relating itself to itself and in willing to be itself, the self rests transparently in the power that established it.
