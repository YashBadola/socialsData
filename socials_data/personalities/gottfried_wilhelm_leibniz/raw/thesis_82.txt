82. Although I find that essentially the same thing is true of all
   living things and animals, which we have just said (namely, that
   animals and souls begin from the very commencement of the world and
   that they no more come to an end than does the world) nevertheless,
   rational animals have this peculiarity, that their little spermatic
   animals, as long as they remain such, have only ordinary or sensuous
   souls, but those of them which are, so to speak, elected, attain by
   actual conception to human nature, and their sensuous souls are raised
   to the rank of reason and to the prerogative of spirits.
