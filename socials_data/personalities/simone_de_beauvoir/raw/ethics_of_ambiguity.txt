Ambiguity and Freedom

The notion of ambiguity must not be confused with that of absurdity. To declare that existence is absurd is to deny that it can ever be given a meaning; to say that it is ambiguous is to assert that its meaning is never fixed, that it must be constantly won. Absurdity challenges every attempt at meaning; ambiguity invites us to create meaning.

The man who finds himself cast into the world is first of all a freedom. But this freedom is not a thing, a static quality. It is a movement, a project. It is the power to transcend the given, to go beyond what is, towards what is not yet.

But this freedom is also a burden. It is the source of our anxiety. We are condemned to be free, as Sartre said. We cannot escape our freedom. Even if we choose not to choose, we are still choosing.

The coward is the one who flees from his freedom, who tries to hide from his responsibility. He takes refuge in the ready-made values of society, in the comforting dogmas of religion, in the blind obedience to authority. He tries to become a thing, a solid object, in order to escape the fluidity and uncertainty of his existence.

The serious man is also a flight from freedom. He takes himself too seriously. He believes that his values are absolute, objective, eternal. He forgets that he is the one who has chosen them. He becomes a slave to his own creation.

The authentic man, on the other hand, accepts his freedom and his ambiguity. He knows that there are no absolute values, no guarantees. He knows that he has to create his own meaning, his own morality. He accepts the risk of failure, the possibility of error. He lives in the tension between what he is and what he wants to be.
