The judgement of taste has nothing at its basis but the\nform of the purposiveness of an object (or of its mode of\nrepresentation)                                             69\n\u00a7 12. The judgement of taste rests on _a priori_ grounds            70\n\u00a7 13. The pure judgement of taste is independent of charm and\nemotion                                                     72\n\u00a7 14. Elucidation by means of examples                              73\n\u00a7 15.

What the modality in a judgement of taste is                  91\n\u00a7 19.

The condition of necessity which a judgement of taste\nasserts is the Idea of a common sense                       92\n\u00a7 21. Have we ground for presupposing a common sense?               93\n\u00a7 22. The necessity of the universal agreement that is thought\nin a judgement of taste is a subjective necessity, which\nis represented as objective under the presupposition of a\ncommon sense                                                94\n_General remark_ on the first section of the Analytic               96\n_Second Book._--Analytic of the Sublime                            101\n\u00a7 23.

To lighten the toil of penetrating through the\nwilderness of Kant\u2019s long sentences, the English student has now many\naids, which those who began their studies fifteen or twenty years\nago did not enjoy. Translations, paraphrases, criticisms, have been\npublished in considerable numbers; so that if it is not yet true that\n\u201che who runs may read,\u201d it may at least be said that a patient student\nof ordinary industry and intelligence has his way made plain before\nhim. And yet the very number of aids is dangerous. Whatever may be the\nvalue of short and easy handbooks in other departments of science,\nit is certain that no man will become a philosopher, no man will\neven acquire a satisfactory knowledge of the history of philosophy,\nwithout personal and prolonged study of the _ipsissima verba_ of the\ngreat masters of human thought. \u201cAbove all,\u201d said Schopenhauer, \u201cmy\ntruth-seeking young friends, beware of letting our professors tell\nyou what is contained in the Critique of the Pure Reason\u201d; and the\nadvice has not become less wholesome with the lapse of years. The fact,\nhowever, that many persons have not sufficient familiarity with German\nto enable them to study German Philosophy in the original with ease,\nmakes translations an educational necessity; and this translation of\nKant\u2019s Critique of the faculty of Judgement has been undertaken in the\nhope that it may promote a more general study of that masterpiece. If\nany reader wishes to follow Schopenhauer\u2019s advice, he has only to omit\nthe whole of this prefatory matter and proceed at once to the Author\u2019s\nlaborious Introduction.\nIt is somewhat surprising that the Critique of Judgement has never\nyet been made accessible to the English reader. Dr. Watson has indeed\ntranslated a few selected passages, so also has Dr. Caird in his\nvaluable account of the Kantian philosophy, and I have found their\nrenderings of considerable service; but the space devoted by both\nwriters to the Critique of Judgement is very small in comparison\nwith that given to the Critiques of Pure and Practical Reason. And\nyet the work is not an unimportant one. Kant himself regarded it as\nthe coping-stone of his critical edifice; it even formed the point\nof departure for his successors, Fichte, Schelling and Hegel, in the\nconstruction of their respective systems. Possibly the reason of\nits comparative neglect lies in its repulsive style. Kant was never\ncareful of style, and in his later years he became more and more\nenthralled by those technicalities and refined distinctions which deter\nso many from the Critical Philosophy even in its earlier sections.\nThese \u201csymmetrical architectonic amusements,\u201d as Schopenhauer called\nthem, encumber every page of Kant\u2019s later writings, and they are a\nconstant source of embarrassment to his unhappy translator. For, as\nevery translator knows, no single word in one language exactly covers\nany single word in another; and yet if Kant\u2019s distinctions are to be\npreserved it is necessary to select with more or less arbitrariness\nEnglish equivalents for German technical terms, and retain them all\nthrough. Instances of this will be given later on; I only remark\nhere on the fact that Kant\u2019s besetting sin of over-technicality is\nespecially conspicuous in this treatise.\nAnother fault--an old fault of Kant--apparent after reading even a few\npages, is that repetitions are very frequent of the same thought in but\nslightly varied language. Arguments are repeated over and over again\nuntil they become quite wearisome; and then when the reader\u2019s attention\nhas flagged, and he is glancing cursorily down the page, some important\nnew point is introduced without emphasis, as if the author were really\nanxious to keep his meaning to himself at all hazards. A book written\nin such fashion rarely attracts a wide circle of readers. And yet, not\nonly did Goethe think highly of it, but it received a large measure\nof attention in France as well as in Germany on its first appearance.\nOriginally published at Berlin in 1790, a Second Edition was called\nfor in 1793; and a French translation was made by Imhoff in 1796. Other\nFrench versions are those by Keratry and Weyland in 1823, and by Barni\nin 1846. This last I have had before me while performing my task, but\nI have not found it of much service; the older French translations\nI have not seen. The existence of these French versions, when taken\nin connexion with the absence until very recently of any systematic\naccount of the Critique of Judgement in English, may be perhaps\nexplained by the lively interest that was taken on the Continent in the\nPhilosophy of Art in the early part of the century; whereas scientific\nstudies on this subject received little attention in England during the\nsame period.\nThe student of the Critique of Pure Reason will remember how closely,\nin his Transcendental Logic, Kant follows the lines of the ordinary\nlogic of the schools. He finds his whole plan ready made for him, as\nit were; and he proceeds to work out the metaphysical principles which\nunderlie the process of syllogistic reasoning. And as there are three\npropositions in every syllogism, he points out that, in correspondence\nwith this triplicity, the higher faculties of the soul may be regarded\nas threefold. The Understanding or the faculty of concepts gives us our\nmajor premise, as it supplies us in the first instance with a general\nnotion. By means of the Judgement we see that a particular case comes\nunder the general rule, and by the Reason we draw our conclusion.\nThese, as three distinct movements in the process of reasoning,\nare regarded by Kant as indicating three distinct faculties, with\nwhich the Analytic of Concepts, the Analytic of Principles, and the\nDialectic are respectively concerned. The full significance of this\nimportant classification does not seem, however, to have occurred\nto Kant at the time, as we may see from the order in which he wrote\nhis great books.[1] The first problem which arrests the attention\nof all modern philosophers is, of course, the problem of knowledge,\nits conditions and its proper objects. And in the Critique of Pure\nReason this is discussed, and the conclusion is reached that nature\nas phenomenon is the only object of which we can hope to acquire any\nexact knowledge. But it is apparent that there are other problems which\nmerit consideration; a complete philosophy includes practice as well\nas theory; it has to do not only with logic, but with life. And thus\nthe Critique of Practical Reason was written, in which is unfolded\nthe doctrine of man\u2019s freedom standing in sharp contrast with the\nnecessity of natural law. Here, then, it seems at first sight as if we\nhad covered the whole field of human activity. For we have investigated\nthe sources of knowledge, and at the same time have pointed out the\nconditions of practical life, and have seen that the laws of freedom\nare just as true in their own sphere as are the laws of nature.\nBut as we reflect on our mental states we find that here no proper\naccount has been given of the phenomena of _feeling_, which play so\nlarge a part in experience. And this Kant saw before he had proceeded\nvery far with the Critique of Practical Reason; and in consequence\nhe adopted a threefold classification of the higher mental faculties\nbased on that given by previous psychologists. Knowledge, feeling,\ndesire, these are the three ultimate modes of consciousness, of which\nthe second has not yet been described. And when we compare this with\nthe former triple division which we took up from the Aristotelian\nlogic, we see that the parallelism is significant. Understanding is\n_par excellence_ the faculty of knowledge, and Reason the faculty of\ndesire (these points are developed in Kant\u2019s first two Critiques). And\nthis suggests that the Judgement corresponds to the feeling of pleasure\nand pain; it occupies a position intermediate between Understanding\nand Reason, just as, roughly speaking, the feeling of pleasure is\nintermediate between our perception of an object and our desire to\npossess it.\nAnd so the Critique of Judgement completes the whole undertaking\nof criticism; its endeavour is to show that there are _a priori_\nprinciples at the basis of Judgement just as there are in the case\nof Understanding and of Reason; that these principles, like the\nprinciples of Reason, are not constitutive but only regulative of\nexperience, _i.e._ that they do not teach us anything positive about\nthe characteristics of objects, but only indicate the conditions under\nwhich we find it necessary to view them; and lastly, that we are thus\nfurnished with an _a priori_ philosophy of pleasure.\nThe fundamental principle underlying the procedure of the Judgement is\nseen to be that of the purposiveness of Nature; nature is everywhere\nadapted to ends or purposes, and thus constitutes a \u03ba\u03cc\u03c3\u03bc\u03bf\u03c2, a\nwell-ordered whole. By this means, nature is regarded by us as if\nits particular empirical laws were not isolated and disparate, but\nconnected and in relation, deriving their unity in seeming diversity\nfrom an intelligence which is at the source of nature. It is only\nby the assumption of such a principle that we can construe nature\nto ourselves; and the principle is then said to be a transcendental\ncondition of the exercise of our judging faculty, but valid only for\nthe reflective, not for the determinant Judgement. It gives us pleasure\nto view nature in this way; just as the contemplation of chaos would be\npainful.\nBut this purposiveness may be only formal and subjective, or real\nand objective. In some cases the purposiveness resides in the felt\nharmony and accordance of the form of the object with the cognitive\nfaculties; in others the form of the object is judged to harmonise\nwith the purpose in view in its existence. That is to say, in the one\ncase we judge the form of the object to be purposive, as in the case\nof a flower, but could not explain any purpose served by it; in the\nother case we have a definite notion of what it is adapted for. In the\nformer case the aesthetical Judgement is brought to bear, in the latter\nthe teleological; and it thus appears that the Critique of Judgement\nhas two main divisions; it treats first of the philosophy of Taste, the\nBeautiful and the Sublime in Nature; and secondly, of the Teleology of\nnature\u2019s working. It is a curious literary parallel that St. Augustine\nhints (_Confessions_ iv. 15) that he had written a book, _De Pulchro\net \u00c1pto_, in which these apparently distinct topics were combined;\n\u201cpulchrum esse, quod per se ipsum; aptum, autem, quod ad aliquid\naccommodatum deceret.\u201d A beautiful object has no purpose external to\nitself and the observer; but a useful object serves further ends. Both,\nhowever, may be brought under the higher category of things that are\nreckoned _purposive_ by the Judgement.\nWe have here then, in the first place, a basis for an _a priori_\nPhilosophy of Taste; and Kant works out its details with great\nelaboration. He borrowed little from the writings of his predecessors,\nbut struck out, as was ever his plan, a line of his own. He quotes\nwith approval from Burke\u2019s _Treatise on the Sublime and Beautiful_,\nwhich was accessible to him in a German translation; but is careful to\nremark that it is as psychology, not as philosophy, that Burke\u2019s work\nhas value. He may have read in addition Hutcheson\u2019s _Inquiry_ which\nhad also been translated into German; and he was complete master of\nHume\u2019s opinions. Of other writers on Beauty, he only names Batteux and\nLessing. Batteux was a French writer of repute who had attempted a\ntwofold arrangement of the Arts as they may be brought under Space and\nunder Time respectively, a mode of classification which would naturally\nappeal to Kant. He does not seem, however, to have read the ancient\ntext-book on the subject, Aristotle\u2019s _Poetics_, the principles of\nwhich Lessing declared to be as certain as Euclid.\nFollowing the guiding thread of the categories, he declares that\nthe aesthetical judgement about Beauty is according to _quality_\ndisinterested; a point which had been laid down by such different\nwriters as Hutcheson and Moses Mendelssohn. As to _quantity_, the\njudgement about beauty gives universal satisfaction, although it is\nbased on no definite concept. The universality is only subjective; but\nstill it is there. The maxim _Trahit sua quemque voluptas_ does not\napply to the pleasure afforded by a pure judgement about beauty. As to\n_relation_, the characteristic of the object called beautiful is that\nit betrays a purposiveness without definite purpose. The pleasure is\n_a priori_, independent on the one hand of the charms of sense or the\nemotions of mere feeling, as Winckelmann had already declared; and\non the other hand is a pleasure quite distinct from that taken which\nwe feel when viewing perfection, with which Wolff and Baumgarten had\nidentified it. By his distinction between free and dependent beauty,\nwhich we also find in the pages of Hutcheson, Kant further develops\nhis doctrine of the freedom of the pure judgement of taste from the\nthraldom of concepts.\nFinally, the satisfaction afforded by the contemplation of a beautiful\nobject is a necessary satisfaction. This necessity is not, to be sure,\ntheoretical like the necessity attaching to the Law of Causality; nor\nis it a practical necessity as is the need to assume the Moral Law as\nthe guiding principle of conduct. But it may be called _exemplary_;\nthat is, we may set up our satisfaction in a beautiful picture as\nsetting an example to be followed by others. It is plain, however,\nthat this can only be assumed under certain presuppositions. We must\npresuppose the idea of a _sensus communis_ or common sense in which all\nmen share. As knowledge admits of being communicated to others, so also\ndoes the feeling for beauty. For the relation between the cognitive\nfaculties requisite for Taste is also requisite for Intelligence or\nsound Understanding, and as we always presuppose the latter to be the\nsame in others as in ourselves, so may we presuppose the former.\nThe analysis of the Sublime which follows that of the Beautiful is\ninteresting and profound; indeed Schopenhauer regarded it as the\nbest part of the Critique of the Aesthetical Judgement. The general\ncharacteristics of our judgements about the Sublime are similar to\nthose already laid down in the case of the Beautiful; but there\nare marked differences in the two cases. If the pleasure taken in\nbeauty arises from a feeling of the purposiveness of the object in\nits relation to the subject, that in sublimity rather expresses a\npurposiveness of the subject in respect of the object. Nothing in\nnature is sublime; and the sublimity really resides in the mind and\nthere alone. Indeed, as true Beauty is found, properly speaking, only\nin beauty of form, the idea of sublimity is excited rather by those\nobjects which are formless and exhibit a violation of purpose.\nA distinction not needed in the case of the Beautiful becomes\nnecessary when we proceed to further analyse the Sublime. For in\naesthetical judgements about the Beautiful the mind is in _restful_\ncontemplation; but in the case of the Sublime a mental _movement_ is\nexcited (pp. 105 and 120). This movement, as it is pleasing, must\ninvolve a purposiveness in the harmony of the mental powers; and the\npurposiveness may be either in reference to the faculty of cognition\nor to that of desire. In the former case the sublime is called the\nMathematically Sublime--the sublime of mere magnitude--the absolutely\ngreat; in the latter it is the sublime of power, the Dynamically\nSublime. Gioberti, an Italian writer on the philosophy of Taste, has\npushed this distinction so far as to find in it an explanation of the\nrelation between Beauty and Sublimity. \u201cThe dynamical Sublime,\u201d he\nsays, \u201ccreates the Beautiful; the mathematical Sublime contains it,\u201d a\nremark with which probably Kant would have no quarrel.\nIn both cases, however, we find that the feeling of the Sublime awakens\nin us a feeling of the supersensible destination of man. \u201cThe very\ncapacity of conceiving the sublime,\u201d he tells us, \u201cindicates a mental\nfaculty that far surpasses every standard of sense.\u201d And to explain\nthe necessity belonging to our judgements about the sublime, Kant\npoints out that as we find ourselves compelled to postulate a _sensus\ncommunis_ to account for the agreement of men in their appreciation of\nbeautiful objects, so the principle underlying their consent in judging\nof the sublime is \u201cthe presupposition of the moral feeling in man.\u201d The\nfeeling of the sublimity of our own moral destination is the necessary\nprerequisite for forming such judgements. The connexion between Beauty\nand Goodness involved to a Greek in the double sense of the word \u03ba\u03b1\u03bb\u03cc\u03bd\nis developed by Kant with keen insight. To feel interest in the beauty\nof Nature he regards as a mark of a moral disposition, though he will\nnot admit that the same inference may be drawn as to the character\nof the art connoisseur (\u00a7 42). But it is specially with reference to\nthe connexion between the capacity for appreciating the Sublime, and\nthe moral feeling, that the originality of Kant\u2019s treatment becomes\napparent.\nThe objects of nature, he continues, which we call sublime, inspire us\nwith a feeling of pain rather than of pleasure; as Lucretius has it--\nMe quaedam divina voluptas\nPercipit atque horror.\nBut this \u201chorror\u201d must not inspire actual fear. As no extraneous\ncharm must mingle with the satisfaction felt in a beautiful object,\nif the judgement about beauty is to remain pure; so in the case of\nthe sublime we must not be afraid of the object which yet in certain\naspects is fearful.\nThis conception of the feelings of sublimity excited by the loneliness\nof an Alpine peak or the grandeur of an earthquake is now a familiar\none; but it was not so in Kant\u2019s day. Switzerland had not then become\nthe recreation-ground of Europe; and though natural beauty was a\nfamiliar topic with poets and painters it was not generally recognised\nthat taste has also to do with the sublime. De Saussure\u2019s _Travels_,\nHaller\u2019s poem _Die Alpen_, and this work of Kant\u2019s mark the beginning\nof a new epoch in our ways of looking at the sublime and terrible\naspects of Nature. And it is not a little remarkable that the man who\ncould write thus feelingly about the emotions inspired by grand and\nsavage scenery, had never seen a mountain in his life. The power and\nthe insight of his observations here are in marked contrast to the\npoverty of some of his remarks about the characteristics of beauty. For\ninstance, he puts forward the curious doctrine that colour in a picture\nis only an extraneous charm, and does not really add to the beauty\nof the form delineated, nay rather distracts the mind from it. His\ncriticisms on this point, if sound, would make Flaxman a truer artist\nthan Titian or Paolo Veronese. But indeed his discussion of Painting or\nMusic is not very appreciative; he was, to the end, a creature of pure\nReason.\nUpon the analysis he gives of the Arts, little need be said here. Fine\nArt is regarded as the Art of Genius, \u201cthat innate mental disposition\nthrough which Nature gives the rule to Art\u201d (\u00a7 46). Art differs\nfrom Science in the absence of definite concepts in the mind of the\nartist. It thus happens that the great artist can rarely communicate\nhis methods; indeed he cannot explain them even to himself. _Poeta\nnascitur, non fit_; and the same is true in every form of fine art.\nGenius is, in short, the faculty of presenting aesthetical Ideas; an\naesthetical Idea being an intuition of the Imagination, to which no\nconcept is adequate. And it is by the excitation of such ineffable\nIdeas that a great work of art affects us. As Bacon tells us, \u201cthat is\nthe best part of Beauty which a picture cannot express; no, nor the\nfirst sight of the eye.\u201d This characteristic of the artistic genius\nhas been noted by all who have thought upon art; more is present in\nits productions than can be perfectly expressed in language. As Pliny\nsaid of Timanthus the painter of Iphigenia, \u201cIn omnibus ejus operibus\nintelligitur plus super quam pingitur.\u201d But this genius requires to be\nkept in check by taste; quite in the spirit of the \u03c3\u03c9\u03c6\u03c1\u03bf\u03c3\u03cd\u03bd\u03b7 of the\nbest Greek art, Kant remarks that if in a work of art some feature must\nbe sacrificed, it is better to lose something of genius than to violate\nthe canons of taste. It is in this self-mastery that \u201cthe sanity of\ntrue genius\u201d expresses itself.\nThe main question with which the Critique of Judgement is concerned\nis, of course, the question as to the purposiveness, the\n_Zweckm\u00e4ssigkeit_, exhibited by nature. That nature appears to be\nfull of purpose is mere matter of fact. It displays purposiveness\nin respect of our faculties of cognition, in those of its phenomena\nwhich we designate beautiful. And also in its organic products we\nobserve methods of operation which we can only explain by describing\nthem as processes in which means are used to accomplish certain\nends, as processes that are _purposive_. In our observation of\nnatural phenomena, as Kuno Fischer puts it, we judge their _forms_\naesthetically, and their _life_ teleologically.\nAs regards the first kind of _Zweckm\u00e4ssigkeit_, that which is _ohne\nZweck_--the purposiveness of a beautiful object which does not seem to\nbe directed to any external end--there are two ways in which we may\naccount for it. We may either say that it was actually designed to\nbe beautiful by the Supreme Force behind Nature, or we may say that\npurposiveness is not really resident in nature, but that our perception\nof it is due to the subjective needs of our judging faculty. We have\nto contemplate beautiful objects _as if_ they were purposive, but they\nmay not be so in reality. And this latter idealistic doctrine is what\nKant falls back upon. He appeals in support of it, to the phenomena of\ncrystallisation (pp. 243 _sqq._), in which many very beautiful forms\nseem to be produced by merely mechanical processes. The beauty of a\nrock crystal is apparently produced without any forethought on the\npart of nature, and he urges that we are not justified in asserting\ndogmatically that any laws distinct from those of mechanism are needed\nto account for beauty in other cases. Mechanism can do so much; may it\nnot do all? And he brings forward as a consideration which ought to\nsettle the question, the fact that in judging of beauty \u201cwe invariably\nseek its gauge _in ourselves a priori_\u201d; we do not learn from nature,\nbut from ourselves, what we are to find beautiful. Mr. Kennedy in his\nDonnellan Lectures has here pointed out several weak spots in Kant\u2019s\narmour. In the first place, the fact that we seek the gauge of beauty\nin our own mind \u201cmay be shown from his own definition to be a necessary\nresult of the very nature of beauty.\u201d[2] For Kant tells us that the\naesthetical judgement about beauty always involves \u201ca reference of the\nrepresentation to the subject\u201d; and this applies equally to judgements\nabout the beautiful in Art and the beautiful in Nature. But no one\ncould maintain that from this definition it follows that we are not\ncompelled to postulate design in the mind of the artist who paints a\nbeautiful picture. And thus as the fact that \u201cwe always seek the gauge\nof beauty\u201d in ourselves does not do away with the belief in a designing\nmind when we are contemplating works of art, it cannot be said to\nexclude the belief in a Master Hand which moulded the forms of Nature.\nAs Cicero has it, nature is \u201cnon artificiosa solum, sed plane artifex.\u201d\nBut the cogency of this reasoning, for the details of which I must\nrefer the reader to Mr. Kennedy\u2019s pages, becomes more apparent when\nwe reflect on that second form of purposiveness, viz. adaptation to\ndefinite ends, with which we meet in the phenomena of organic life.\nIf we watch, _e.g._ the growth of a tree we perceive that its various\nparts are not isolated and unconnected, but that on the contrary they\nare only possible by reference to the idea of the whole. Each limb\naffects every other, and is reciprocally affected by it; in short \u201cin\nsuch a product of nature every part not only exists _by means of_ the\nother parts, but is thought as existing _for the sake of_ the others\nand the whole\u201d (p. 277). The operations of nature in organised bodies\nseem to be of an entirely different character from mere mechanical\nprocesses; we cannot construe them to ourselves except under the\nhypothesis that nature in them is working towards a designed end.\nThe distinction between nature\u2019s \u201cTechnic\u201d or purposive operation,\nand nature\u2019s Mechanism is fundamental for the explanation of natural\nlaw. The language of biology eloquently shows the impossibility of\neliminating at least the _idea_ of purpose from our investigations into\nthe phenomena of life, growth, and reproduction. And Kant dismisses\nwith scant respect that cheap and easy philosophy which would fain\ndeny the distinctiveness of nature\u2019s purposive operation. A doctrine,\nlike that of Epicurus, in which every natural phenomenon is regarded\nas the result of the blind drifting of atoms in accordance with purely\nmechanical laws, really explains nothing, and least of all explains\nthat illusion in our teleological judgements which leads us to assume\npurpose where really there is none.\nIt has been urged by Kirchmann and others that this distinction\nbetween Technic and Mechanism, on which Kant lays so much stress,\nhas been disproved by the progress of modern science. The doctrines,\nusually associated with the name of Darwin, of Natural Selection and\nSurvival of the Fittest, quite sufficiently explain, it is said, on\nmechanical principles the semblance of purpose with which nature mocks\nus. The presence of order is not due to any purpose behind the natural\noperation, but to the inevitable disappearance of the disorderly. It\nwould be absurd, of course, to claim for Kant that he anticipated the\nDarwinian doctrines of development; and yet passages are not wanting\nin his writings in which he takes a view of the continuity of species\nwith which modern science would have little fault to find. \u201cNature\norganises itself and its organised products in every species, no\ndoubt after one general pattern but yet with suitable deviations,\nwhich self-preservation demands according to circumstances\u201d (p. 279).\n\u201cThe analogy of forms, which with all their differences seem to have\nbeen produced according to a common original type, strengthens our\nsuspicions of an actual relationship between them in their production\nfrom a common parent, through the gradual approximation of one animal\ngenus to another--from those in which the principle of purposes seems\nto be best authenticated, _i.e._ from man, down to the polype and again\nfrom this down to mosses and lichens, and finally to crude matter.\nAnd so the whole Technic of nature, which is so incomprehensible to\nus in organised beings that we believe ourselves compelled to think a\ndifferent principle for it, seems to be derived from matter and its\npowers according to mechanical laws (like those by which it works in\nthe formation of crystals)\u201d (p. 337). Such a theory he calls \u201ca daring\nventure of reason,\u201d and its coincidences with modern science are real\nand striking. But he is careful to add that such a theory, even if\nestablished, would not eliminate purpose from the universe; it would\nindeed suggest that certain special processes having the semblance of\npurpose may be elucidated on mechanical principles, but on the whole,\npurposive operation on the part of Mother Nature it would still be\nneedful to assume (p. 338). \u201cNo finite Reason can hope to understand\nthe production of even a blade of grass by mere mechanical causes\u201d\n(p. 326). \u201cIt is absurd to hope that another Newton will arise in the\nfuture who shall make comprehensible by us the production of a blade of\ngrass according to natural laws which no design has ordered\u201d (p. 312).\nCrude materialism thus affording no explanation of the purposiveness\nin nature, we go on to ask what other theories are logically possible.\nWe may dismiss at once the doctrine of Hylozoism, according to which\nthe purposes in nature are explained in reference to a world-soul,\nwhich is the inner principle of the material universe and constitutes\nits life. For such a doctrine is self-contradictory, inasmuch as\nlifelessness, _inertia_, is the essential characteristic of matter,\nand to talk of living matter is absurd (p. 304). A much more plausible\nsystem is that of Spinoza, who aimed at establishing the ideality\nof the principle of natural purposes. He regarded the world whole\nas a complex of manifold determinations inhering in a single simple\nsubstance; and thus reduced our concepts of the purposive in nature to\nour own consciousness of existing in an all-embracing Being. But on\nreflection we see that this does not so much explain as explain away\nthe purposiveness of nature; it gives us an unity of inherence _in_ one\nSubstance, but not an unity of causal dependence _on_ one Substance (p.\n303). And this latter would be necessary in order to explain the unity\nof purpose which nature exhibits in its phenomenal working. Spinozism,\ntherefore, does not give what it pretends to give; it puts us off with\na vague and unfruitful unity of ground, when what we seek is a unity\nthat shall itself contain the causes of the differences manifest in\nnature.\nWe have left then as the only remaining possible doctrine, Theism,\nwhich represents natural purposes as produced in accordance with the\nWill and Design of an Intelligent Author and Governor of Nature.\nThis theory is, in the first place, \u201csuperior to all other grounds\nof explanation\u201d (p. 305), for it gives a full solution of the\nproblem before us and enables us to maintain the reality of the\n_Zweckm\u00e4ssigkeit_ of nature. \u201cTeleology finds the consummation of its\ninvestigations only in Theology\u201d (p. 311). To represent the world\nand the natural purposes therein as produced by an intelligent Cause\nis \u201ccompletely satisfactory from every human point of view for both\nthe speculative and practical use of our Reason\u201d (p. 312). Thus the\ncontemplation of natural purposes, _i.e._ the common Argument from\nDesign, enables us to reach a highest Understanding as Cause of the\nworld \u201cin accordance with the principles of the reflective Judgement,\n_i.e._ _in accordance with the constitution of our human faculty of\ncognition_\u201d (p. 416).\nIt is in this qualifying clause that Kant\u2019s negative attitude in\nrespect of Theism betrays itself. He regards it as a necessary\nassumption for the guidance of scientific investigation, no less than\nfor the practical needs of morals; but he does not admit that we can\nclaim for it objective validity. In the language of the Critique of\nPure Reason, the Idea of God furnishes a regulative, not a constitutive\nprinciple of Reason; or as he prefers to put it in the present work, it\nis valid only for the reflective, not for the determinant Judgement. We\nare not justified, Kant maintains, in asserting dogmatically that God\nexists; there is only permitted to us the limited formula \u201cWe cannot\notherwise conceive the purposiveness which must lie at the basis of our\ncognition of the internal possibility of many natural things, than by\nrepresenting it and the world in general as produced by an intelligent\ncause, _i.e._ a God\u201d (p. 312).\nWe ask then, whence arises this impossibility of objective statement?\nIt is in the true Kantian spirit to assert that no synthetical\nproposition can be made with reference to what lies above and behind\nthe world of sense; but there is a difficulty in carrying out this\nprinciple into details. Kant\u2019s refusal to infer a designing Hand behind\nthe apparent order of nature is based, he tells us, on the fact that\nthe concept of a \u201cnatural purpose\u201d is one that cannot be justified to\nthe speculative Reason. For all we know it may only indicate our way of\nlooking at things, and may point to no corresponding objective reality.\nThat we are forced by the limited nature of our faculties to view\nnature as working towards ends, as purposive, does not prove that it is\nreally so. We cannot justify such pretended insight into what is behind\nthe veil.\nIt is to be observed, however, that precisely similar arguments might\nbe urged against our affirmation of purpose, design, will, as the\nspring of the actions of other human beings.[3] For let us consider\nwhy it is that, mind being assumed as the basis of our own individual\nconsciousness, we go on to attribute minds of like character to other\nmen. We see that the external behaviour of other men is similar to our\nown, and that the most reasonable way of accounting for such behaviour\nis to suppose that they have minds like ourselves, that they are\npossessed of an active and spontaneously energising faculty, which is\nthe seat of their personality. But it is instructive to observe that\nneither on Kantian principles nor on any other can we _demonstrate_\nthis; to cross the chasm which separates one man\u2019s personality from\nanother\u2019s requires a venture of faith just as emphatically as any\ntheological formula. I can by no means _prove_ to the determinant\nJudgement that the complex of sensations which I constantly experience,\nand which I call the Prime Minister, is anything more than a\nwell-ordered machine. It is improbable that this is the case--highly\nimprobable; but the falsity of such an hypothesis cannot be proved in\nthe same way that we would prove the falsity of the assertion that two\nand two make five. But then though the hypothesis cannot be thus ruled\nout of court by demonstration of its absurdity, it is not the simplest\nhypothesis, nor is it that one which best accounts for the facts. The\nassumption, on the other hand, that the men whom I meet every day have\nminds like my own, perfectly accounts for all the facts, and is a very\nsimple assumption. It merely extends by induction the sphere of a force\nwhich I already know to exist. Or in other words, crude materialism not\ngiving me an intelligent account of my own individual consciousness,\nI recognise mind, \u03bd\u03bf\u1fe6\u03c2, as a _vera causa_, as something which really\ndoes produce effects in the field of experience, and which therefore I\nmay legitimately put forward as the cause of those actions of other\nmen which externally so much resemble my own. But, as has been said\nbefore, this argument, though entirely convincing to any sane person,\nis not demonstrative; in Kantian language and on Kantian principles\nthe reasoning here used would seem to be valid only for the reflective\nand not for the determinant Judgement. If the principle of design or\nconscious adaptation of means to ends be not a constitutive principle\nof experience, but only a regulative principle introduced to account\nfor the facts, what right have we to put it forward dogmatically as\naffording an explanation of the actions of other human beings?\nIt cannot be said that Kant\u2019s attempted answer to such a defence of\nthe Design Argument is quite conclusive. In \u00a7 90 of the _Methodology_\n(p. 399) he pleads that though it is perfectly legitimate to argue by\nanalogy from our own minds to the minds of other men,--nay further,\nalthough we may conclude from those actions of the lower animals\nwhich display plan, that they are not, as Descartes alleged, mere\nmachines--yet it is not legitimate to conclude from the apparent\npresence of design in the operations of nature that a conscious mind\ndirects those operations. For, he argues, that in comparing the actions\nof men and the lower animals, or in comparing the actions of one man\nwith those of another, we are not pressing our analogy beyond the\nlimits of experience. Men and beasts alike are finite living beings,\nsubject to the limitations of finite existence; and hence the law which\ngoverns the one series of operations may be regarded by analogy as\nsufficiently explaining the other series. But the power at the basis of\nNature is utterly above definition or comprehension, and we are going\nbeyond our legitimate province if we venture to ascribe to it a mode\nof operation with which we are only conversant in the case of beings\nsubject to the conditions of space and time. He urges in short that\nwhen speaking about man and his mind we thoroughly understand what we\nare talking about; but in speaking of the Mind of Deity we are dealing\nwith something of which we have no experience, and of which therefore\nwe have no right to predicate anything.\nBut it is apparent that, as has been pointed out, even when we infer\nthe existence of another finite mind from certain observed operations,\nwe are making an inference about something which is as mysterious an\n_x_ as anything can be. Mind is not a thing that is subject to the\nlaws and conditions of the world of sense; it is \u201c_in_ the world but\nnot _of_ the world.\u201d And so to infer the existence of the mind of any\nindividual except myself is a quite different kind of inference from\nthat by which, for example, we infer the presence of an electro-magnet\nin a given field. The action of the latter we understand to a large\nextent; but we do not understand the action of mind, which yet we\nknow from daily experience of ourselves does produce effects in the\nphenomenal world, often permanent and important effects. Briefly,\nthe action of mind upon matter (to use the ordinary phraseology for\nthe sake of clearness) is--we may assume for our present purpose--an\nestablished fact. Hence the causality of mind is a _vera causa_; we\nbring it in to account for the actions of other human beings, and by\nprecisely the same process of reasoning we invoke it to explain the\noperations of nature.\nAnd it is altogether beside the point to urge, as Kant does\nincessantly, that in the latter case the intelligence inferred is\n_infinite_; in the former only _finite_. All that the Design Argument\nundertakes to prove is that mind lies at the basis of nature. It\nis quite beyond its province to say whether this mind is finite or\ninfinite; and thus Kant\u2019s criticisms on p. 364 are somewhat wide of\nthe mark. There is always a difficulty in any argument which tries to\nestablish the operation of mind anywhere, for mind cannot be seen or\ntouched or felt; but the difficulty is not peculiar to that particular\nform of argument with which theological interests are involved.\nThe real plausibility of this objection arises from a vague idea,\noften present to us when we speak of _infinite_ wisdom or _infinite_\nintelligence, namely that the epithet _infinite_ in some way alters\nthe meaning of the attributes to which it is applied. But the truth is\nthat the word _infinite_, when applied to wisdom or knowledge or any\nother intellectual or moral quality, can only properly have reference\nto the number of acts of wisdom or knowledge that we suppose to have\nbeen performed. The only sense in which we have any right to speak of\n_infinite_ wisdom is that it is that which performs an infinite number\nof wise acts. And so when we speak of infinite _intelligence_, we have\nnot the slightest warrant, either in logic or in common sense, for\nsupposing that such intelligence is not similar in kind to that finite\nintelligence which we know in man.\nTo understand Kant\u2019s attitude fully, we must also take into\nconsideration the great weight that he attaches to the Moral Argument\nfor the existence of God. The positive side of his teaching on Theism\nis summed up in the following sentence (p. 388): \u201cFor the theoretical\nreflective Judgement physical Teleology sufficiently proves from the\npurposes of Nature an intelligent world-cause; for the practical\nJudgement moral Teleology establishes it by the concept of a final\npurpose, which it is forced to ascribe to creation.\u201d That side of his\nsystem which is akin to Agnosticism finds expression in his determined\nrefusal to admit anything more than this. The existence of God is for\nhim a \u201cthing of faith\u201d; and is not a fact of knowledge, strictly so\ncalled. \u201cFaith\u201d he holds (p. 409) \u201cis the moral attitude of Reason as\nto belief in that which is unattainable by theoretical cognition. It\nis therefore the constant principle of the mind to assume as true that\nwhich it is necessary to presuppose as condition of the possibility of\nthe highest moral final purpose.\u201d As he says elsewhere (Introduction\nto Logic, ix. p. 60), \u201cThat man is morally _unbelieving_ who does not\naccept that which, though _impossible_ to know, is _morally necessary_\nto suppose.\u201d And as far as he goes a Theist may agree with him, and he\nhas done yeoman\u2019s service to Theism by his insistence on the absolute\nimpossibility of any other working hypothesis as an explanation of the\nphenomena of nature. But I have endeavoured to indicate at what points\nhe does not seem to me to have gone as far as even his own declared\nprinciples would justify him in going. If the existence of a Supreme\nMind be a \u201cthing of faith,\u201d this may with equal justice be said of the\nfinite minds of the men all around us; and his attempt to show that the\nargument from analogy is here without foundation is not convincing.\nKant, however, in the Critique of Judgement is sadly fettered by\nthe chains that he himself had forged, and frequently chafes under\nthe restraints they impose. He indicates more than once a point of\nview higher than that of the Critique of Pure Reason, from which\nthe phenomena of life and mind may be contemplated. He had already\nhinted in that work that the supersensible substrate of the ego and\nthe non-ego might be identical. \u201cBoth kinds of objects differ from\neach other, not internally, but only so far as the one _appears_\nexternal to the other; possibly what is at the basis of phenomenal\nmatter as a thing in itself may not be so heterogeneous after all\nas we imagine.\u201d[4] This hypothesis which remains a bare undeveloped\npossibility in the earlier work is put forward as a positive doctrine\nin the Critique of Judgement. \u201cThere must,\u201d says Kant, \u201cbe a ground\nof the _unity_ of the supersensible, which lies at the basis of\nnature, with that which the concept of freedom practically contains\u201d\n(Introduction, p. 13). That is to say, he maintains that to explain\nthe phenomena of organic life and the purposiveness of nature we must\nhold that the world of sense is not disparate from and opposed to the\nworld of thought, but that _nature is the development of freedom_.\nThe connexion of nature and freedom is suggested by, nay is involved\nin, the notion of natural adaptation; and although we can arrive\nat no knowledge of the supersensible substrate of both, yet such a\ncommon ground there must be. This principle is the starting-point of\nthe systems which followed that of Kant; and the philosophy of later\nIdealism is little more than a development of the principle in its\nconsequences.\nHe approaches the same doctrine by a different path in the Critique of\nthe Teleological Judgement (\u00a7 77), where he argues that the distinction\nbetween the mechanical and the teleological working of nature, upon\nwhich so much stress has been justly laid, depends for its validity\nupon the peculiar character of our Understanding. When we give what may\nbe called a mechanical elucidation of any natural phenomenon, we begin\nwith its parts, and from what we know of them we explain the whole. But\nin the case of certain objects, _e.g._ organised bodies, this cannot be\ndone. In their case we can only account for the parts by a reference to\nthe whole. Now, were it possible for us to perceive a whole before its\nparts and derive the latter from the former,[5] then an organism would\nbe capable of being understood and would be an object of knowledge in\nthe strictest sense. But our Understanding is not able to do this, and\nits inadequacy for such a task leads us to conceive the possibility of\nan Understanding, not discursive like ours, but intuitive, for which\nknowledge of the whole would precede that of the parts. \u201cIt is at\nleast possible to consider the material world as mere phenomenon, and\nto think as its substrate something like a thing in itself (which is\nnot phenomenon), and to attach to this a corresponding intellectual\nintuition. Thus there would be, although incognisable by us, a\nsupersensible real ground for nature, to which we ourselves belong\u201d\n(p. 325). Hence, although Mechanism and Technic must not be confused\nand must ever stand side by side in our scientific investigation of\nnatural law, yet must they be regarded as coalescing in a single higher\nprinciple incognisable by us. The ground of union is \u201cthe supersensible\nsubstrate of nature of which we can determine nothing positively,\nexcept that it is the being in itself of which we merely know the\nphenomenon.\u201d Thus, then, it appears that the whole force of Kant\u2019s\nmain argument has proceeded upon an assumption, viz. the permanent\nopposition between Sense and Understanding, which the progress of the\nargument has shown to be unsound. \u201cKant seems,\u201d says Goethe,[6] \u201cto\nhave woven a certain element of irony into his method. For, while at\none time he seemed to be bent on limiting our faculties of knowledge in\nthe narrowest way, at another time he pointed, as it were with a side\ngesture, beyond the limits which he himself had drawn.\u201d The fact of\nadaptation of means to ends observable in nature seems to break down\nthe barrier between Nature and Freedom; and if we once relinquish the\ndistinction between Mechanism and Technic in the operations of nature\nwe are led to the Idea of an absolute Being, who manifests Himself by\naction which, though necessary, is yet the outcome of perfect freedom.\nKant, however, though he approaches such a position more than once,\ncan never be said to have risen to it. He deprecates unceasingly the\nattempt to combine principles of nature with the principles of freedom\nas a task beyond the modest capacity of human reason; and while\nstrenuously insisting on the practical force of the Moral Argument for\nthe Being of God, which is found in the witness of man\u2019s conscience,\nwill not admit that it can in any way be regarded as strengthening the\ntheoretical arguments adduced by Teleology. The two lines of proof, he\nholds, are quite distinct; and nothing but confusion and intellectual\ndisaster can result from the effort to combine them. The moral proof\nstands by itself, and it needs no such crutches as the argument\nfrom Design can offer. But, as Mr. Kennedy has pointed out in his\nacute criticism[7] of the Kantian doctrine of Theism, it would not\nbe possible to combine a theoretical _disbelief_ in God with a frank\nacceptance of the practical belief of His existence borne in upon us\nby the Moral Law. Kant himself admits this: \u201cA dogmatical _unbelief_,\u201d\nhe says (p. 411), \u201ccannot subsist together with a moral maxim dominant\nin the mental attitude.\u201d That is, though the theoretical argument be\nincomplete, we cannot reject the conclusion to which it leads, for this\nis confirmed by the moral necessities of conscience.\nKant\u2019s position, then, seems to come to this, that though he never\ndoubts the existence of God, he has very grave doubts that He can\nbe theoretically known by man. _That_ He is, is certain; _what_ He\nis, we cannot determine. It is a position not dissimilar to current\nAgnostic doctrines; and as long as the antithesis between Sense and\nUnderstanding, between Matter and Mind, is insisted upon as expressing\na real and abiding truth, Kant\u2019s reasoning can hardly be refuted\nwith completeness. No doubt it may be urged that since the practical\nand theoretical arguments both arrive at the same conclusion, the\ncogency of our reasoning in the latter should confirm our trust in\nthe former. But true conclusions may sometimes seem to follow from\nquite insufficient premises; and Kant is thus justified in demanding\nthat each argument shall be submitted to independent tests. I have\nendeavoured to show above that he has not treated the theoretical line\nof reasoning quite fairly, and that he has underestimated its force;\nbut its value _as an argument_ is not increased by showing that another\nentirely different process of thought leads to the same result. And\nthat the witness of conscience affords the most powerful and convincing\nargument for the existence of a Supreme Being, the source of law as of\nlove, is a simple matter of experience. Induction, syllogism, analogy,\ndo not really generate belief in God, though they may serve to justify\nto reason a faith that we already possess. The poet has the truth of it:\nWer Gott nicht f\u00fchlt in sich und allen Lebenskreisen,\nDem werdet Ihr Ihn nicht beweisen mit Beweisen.\n*       *       *       *       *\nI give at the end of this Introduction a Glossary of the chief\nphilosophical terms used by Kant; I have tried to render them by the\nsame English equivalents all through the work, in order to preserve,\nas far as may be, the exactness of expression in the original. I am\nconscious that this makes the translation clumsy in many places, but\nhave thought it best to sacrifice elegance to precision. This course\nis the more necessary to adopt, as Kant cannot be understood unless\nhis nice verbal distinctions be attended to. Thus _real_ means quite\na different thing from _wirklich_; _Hang_ from _Neigung_; _R\u00fchrung_\nfrom _Affekt_ or _Leidenschaft_; _Anschauung_ from _Empfindung_\nor _Wahrnehmung_; _Endzweck_ from _letzter Zweck_; _Idee_ from\n_Vorstellung_; _Eigenschaft_ from _Attribut_ or _Beschaffenheit_;\n_Schranke_ from _Grenze_; _\u00fcberreden_ from _\u00fcberzeugen_, etc. I am not\nsatisfied with \u201cgratification\u201d and \u201cgrief\u201d as the English equivalents\nfor _Vergn\u00fcgen_ and _Schmerz_; but it is necessary to distinguish these\nwords from _Lust_ and _Unlust_, and \u201cmental pleasure,\u201d \u201cmental pain,\u201d\nwhich would nearly hit the sense, are awkward. Again, the constant\nrendering of _sch\u00f6n_ by beautiful involves the expression \u201cbeautiful\nart\u201d instead of the more usual phrase \u201cfine art.\u201d _Purposive_ is an\nugly word, but it has come into use lately; and its employment enables\nus to preserve the connexion between _Zweck_ and _zweckm\u00e4ssig_. I\nhave printed _Judgement_ with a capital letter when it signifies\nthe _faculty_, with a small initial when it signifies the _act_, of\njudging. And in like manner I distinguish _Objekt_ from _Gegenstand_,\nby printing the word \u201cObject,\u201d when it represents the former, with a\nlarge initial.\nThe text I have followed is, in the main, that printed by Hartenstein;\nbut occasionally Rosenkranz preserves the better reading. All important\nvariants between the First and Second Editions have been indicated at\nthe foot of the page. A few notes have been added, which are enclosed\nin square brackets, to distinguish them from those which formed part\nof the original work. I have in general quoted Kant\u2019s _Introduction to\nLogic_ and _Critique of Practical Reason_ in Dr. Abbott\u2019s translations.\nMy best thanks are due to Rev. J. H. Kennedy and Mr. F. Purser for much\nvaluable aid during the passage of this translation through the press.\nAnd I am under even greater obligations to Mr. Mahaffy, who was good\nenough to read through the whole of the proof; by his acute and learned\ncriticisms many errors have been avoided. Others I have no doubt still\nremain, but for these I must be accounted alone responsible.\nJ. H. BERNARD.\nTRINITY COLLEGE, DUBLIN,\n_May 24, 1892_.\n*       *       *       *       *\nMore than twenty-one years have passed since the first edition of this\nTranslation was published, and during that time much has been written,\nboth in Germany and in England, on the subject of Kant\u2019s _Critique\nof Judgement_. In particular, the German text has been critically\ndetermined by the labours of Professor Windelband, whose fine edition\nforms the fifth volume of Kant\u2019s Collected Works as issued by the Royal\nPrussian Academy of Sciences (Berlin, 1908). It will be indispensable\nto future students. An excellent account of the significance, in the\nKantian system, of the _Urtheilskraft_, by Mr. R.\u00a0A.\u00a0C. Macmillan,\nappeared in 1912; and Mr. J.\u00a0C. Meredith has published recently an\nEnglish edition of the _Critique of Aesthetical Judgement_, with notes\nand essays, dealing with the philosophy of art, which goes over the\nground very fully.\nSome critics of my first edition took exception to the clumsiness\nof the word \u201crepresentation\u201d as the equivalent of _Vorstellung_, but\nI have made no change in this respect, as it seems to me (and so far\nas I have observed to others who have worked on the _Critique of\nJudgement_), that it is necessary to preserve in English the relation\nbetween the noun _Vorstellung_ and the verb _vorstellen_, if Kant\u2019s\nreasoning is to be exhibited clearly. I have, however, abandoned the\nattempt to preserve the word _Kritik_ in English, and have replaced it\nby _Critique_ or _criticism_, throughout. The other changes that have\nbeen made are mere corrections or emendations of faulty or obscure\nrenderings, with a few additional notes. I have left my original\nIntroduction as it was written in 1892, without attempting any fresh\nexamination of the problems that Kant set himself.\nJOHN OSSORY.\nTHE PALACE, KILKENNY,\n_January 6, 1914_.\nGLOSSARY OF KANT\u2019S PHILOSOPHICAL TERMS\nAbsicht; _design_.\nAchtung; _respect_.\nAffekt; _affection_.\nAngenehm; _pleasant_.\nAnschauung; _intuition_.\nAttribut; _attribute_.\nAufkl\u00e4rung; _enlightenment_.\nBegehr; _desire_.\nBegriff; _concept_.\nBeschaffenheit; _constitution_ or _characteristic_.\nBestimmen; _to determine_.\nDarstellen; _to present_.\nDasein; _presence_ or _being_.\nEigenschaft; _property_.\nEmpfindung; _sensation_.\nEndzweck; _final purpose_.\nErkenntniss; _cognition_ or _knowledge_.\nErkl\u00e4rung; _explanation_.\nErscheinung; _phenomenon_.\nExistenz; _existence_.\nF\u00fcrwahrhalten; _belief_.\nGebiet; _realm_.\nGef\u00fchl; _feeling_.\nGegenstand; _object_.\nGeist; _spirit_.\nGeniessen; _enjoyment_.\nGeschicklichkeit; _skill_.\nGeschmack; _Taste_.\nGesetzm\u00e4ssigkeit; _conformity to law_.\nGewalt; _dominion_ or _authority_.\nGlaube; _faith_.\nGrenze; _bound_.\nGrundsatz; _fundamental proposition_ or _principle_.\nHang; _propension_.\nIdee; _Idea_.\nLeidenschaft; _passion_.\nLetzter Zweck; _ultimate purpose_.\nLust; _pleasure_.\nMeinen; _opinion_.\nNeigung; _inclination_.\nObjekt; _Object_.\nPrinzip; _principle_.\nReal; _real_.\nReich; _kingdom_.\nReiz; _charm_.\nR\u00fchrung; _emotion_.\nSchein; _illusion_.\nSchmerz; _grief_.\nSch\u00f6n; _beautiful_.\nSchranke; _limit_.\nSchw\u00e4rmerei; _fanaticism_.\nSeele; _soul_.\nUeberreden; _to persuade_.\nUeberschw\u00e4nglich; _transcendent_.\nUeberzeugen; _to convince_.\nUnlust; _pain_.\nUrtheil; _judgement_.\nUrtheilskraft; _Judgement_.\nVerbindung; _combination_.\nVergn\u00fcgen; _gratification_.\nVerkn\u00fcpfung; _connexion_.\nVerm\u00f6gen; _faculty_.\nVernunft; _Reason_.\nVern\u00fcnftelei; _sophistry_ or _subtlety_.\nVerstand; _Understanding_.\nVorstellung; _representation_.\nWahrnehmung; _perception_.\nWesen; _being_.\nWillk\u00fchr; _elective will_.\nWirklich; _actual_.\nWohlgefallen; _satisfaction_.\nZufriedenheit; _contentment_.\nZweck; _purpose_.\nZweckm\u00e4ssig; _purposive_.\nZweckverbindung; _purposive combination_, etc.\nPREFACE\nWe may call the faculty of cognition from principles _a priori_, _pure\nReason_, and the inquiry into its possibility and bounds generally the\nCritique of pure Reason, although by this faculty we only understand\nReason in its theoretical employment, as it appears under that name\nin the former work; without wishing to inquire into its faculty, as\npractical Reason, according to its special principles. That [Critique]\ngoes merely into our faculty of knowing things _a priori_, and busies\nitself therefore only with the _cognitive faculty_ to the exclusion\nof the feeling of pleasure and pain and the faculty of desire; and of\nthe cognitive faculties it only concerns itself with _Understanding_,\naccording to its principles _a priori_, to the exclusion of _Judgement_\nand _Reason_ (as faculties alike belonging to theoretical cognition),\nbecause it is found in the sequel that no other cognitive faculty but\nthe Understanding can furnish constitutive principles of cognition _a\npriori_. The Critique, then, which sifts them all, as regards the share\nwhich each of the other faculties might pretend to have in the clear\npossession of knowledge from its own peculiar root, leaves nothing but\nwhat the _Understanding_ prescribes _a priori_ as law for nature as\nthe complex of phenomena (whose form also is given _a priori_). It\nrelegates all other pure concepts under Ideas, which are transcendent\nfor our theoretical faculty of cognition, but are not therefore useless\nor to be dispensed with. For they serve as regulative principles;\npartly to check the dangerous pretensions of Understanding, as if\n(because it can furnish _a priori_ the conditions of the possibility\nof all things which it can know) it had thereby confined within\nthese bounds the possibility of all things in general; and partly to\nlead it to the consideration of nature according to a principle of\ncompleteness, although it can never attain to this, and thus to further\nthe final design of all knowledge.\nIt was then properly the _Understanding_ which has its special realm in\nthe _cognitive faculty_, so far as it contains constitutive principles\nof cognition _a priori_, which by the Critique, comprehensively called\nthe Critique of pure Reason, was to be placed in certain and sole\npossession[8] against all other competitors. And so also to _Reason_,\nwhich contains constitutive principles _a priori_ nowhere except simply\nin respect of the _faculty of desire_, should be assigned its place in\nthe Critique of practical Reason.\nWhether now the _Judgement_, which in the order of our cognitive\nfaculties forms a mediating link between Understanding and Reason, has\nalso principles _a priori_ for itself; whether these are constitutive\nor merely regulative (thus indicating no special realm); and whether\nthey give a rule _a priori_ to the feeling of pleasure and pain, as the\nmediating link between the cognitive faculty and the faculty of desire\n(just as the Understanding prescribes laws _a priori_ to the first,\nReason to the second); these are the questions with which the present\nCritique of Judgement is concerned.\nA Critique of pure Reason, _i.e._ of our faculty of judging _a priori_\naccording to principles, would be incomplete, if the Judgement, which\nas a cognitive faculty also makes claim to such principles, were not\ntreated as a particular part of it; although its principles in a\nsystem of pure Philosophy need form no particular part between the\ntheoretical and the practical, but can be annexed when needful to one\nor both as occasion requires. For if such a system is one day to be\ncompleted under the general name of Metaphysic (which it is possible\nto achieve quite completely, and which is supremely important for the\nuse of Reason in every reference), the soil for the edifice must be\nexplored by Criticism as deep down as the foundation of the faculty of\nprinciples independent of experience, in order that it may sink in no\npart, for this would inevitably bring about the downfall of the whole.\nWe can easily infer from the nature of the Judgement (whose right use\nis so necessarily and so universally requisite, that by the name of\nsound Understanding nothing else but this faculty is meant), that it\nmust be attended with great difficulties to find a principle peculiar\nto it; (some such it must contain _a priori_ in itself, for otherwise\nit would not be set apart by the commonest Criticism as a special\ncognitive faculty). This principle must not be derived _a priori_ from\nconcepts, for these belong to the Understanding, and Judgement is only\nconcerned with their application. It must, therefore, furnish of itself\na concept, through which, properly speaking, no thing is cognised,\nbut which only serves as a rule, though not an objective one to which\nit can adapt its judgement; because for this latter another faculty\nof Judgement would be requisite, in order to be able to distinguish\nwhether [any given case] is or is not the case for the rule.\nThis perplexity about a principle (whether it is subjective or\nobjective) presents itself mainly in those judgements that we call\naesthetical, which concern the Beautiful and the Sublime of Nature or\nof Art. And, nevertheless, the critical investigation of a principle\nof Judgement in these is the most important part in a Critique of\nthis faculty. For although they do not by themselves contribute to\nthe knowledge of things, yet they belong to the cognitive faculty\nalone, and point to an immediate reference of this faculty to the\nfeeling of pleasure or pain according to some principle _a priori_;\nwithout confusing this with what may be the determining ground of the\nfaculty of desire, which has its principles _a priori_ in concepts\nof Reason.--In the logical judging of nature, experience exhibits a\nconformity to law in things, to the understanding or to the explanation\nof which the general concept of the sensible does not attain; here the\nJudgement can only derive from itself a principle of the reference of\nthe natural thing to the unknowable supersensible (a principle which it\nmust only use from its own point of view for the cognition of nature).\nAnd so, though in this case such a principle _a priori_ can and must be\napplied to the _cognition_ of the beings of the world, and opens out\nat the same time prospects which are advantageous for the practical\nReason, yet it has no immediate reference to the feeling of pleasure\nand pain. But this reference is precisely the puzzle in the principle\nof Judgement, which renders a special section for this faculty\nnecessary in the Critique; since the logical judging according to\nconcepts (from which an immediate inference can never be drawn to the\nfeeling of pleasure and pain) along with their critical limitation, has\nat all events been capable of being appended to the theoretical part of\nPhilosophy.\nThe examination of the faculty of taste, as the aesthetical Judgement,\nis not here planned in reference to the formation or the culture of\ntaste (for this will take its course in the future as in the past\nwithout any such investigations), but merely in a transcendental point\nof view. Hence, I trust that as regards the deficiency of the former\npurpose it will be judged with indulgence, though in the latter point\nof view it must be prepared for the severest scrutiny. But I hope that\nthe great difficulty of solving a problem so involved by nature may\nserve as excuse for some hardly avoidable obscurity in its solution, if\nonly it be clearly established that the principle is correctly stated.\nI grant that the mode of deriving the phenomena of the Judgement from\nit has not all the clearness which might be rightly demanded elsewhere,\nviz. in the case of cognition according to concepts; but I believe that\nI have attained to it in the second part of this work.\nHere then I end my whole critical undertaking. I shall proceed without\ndelay to the doctrinal [part] in order to profit, as far as is\npossible, by the more favourable moments of my increasing years. It is\nobvious that in this [part] there will be no special section for the\nJudgement, because in respect of this faculty Criticism serves instead\nof Theory; but, according to the division of Philosophy (and also of\npure Philosophy) into theoretical and practical, the Metaphysic of\nNature and of Morals will complete the undertaking.\nINTRODUCTION\nI. OF THE DIVISION OF PHILOSOPHY\nWe proceed quite correctly if, as usual, we divide Philosophy, as\ncontaining the principles of the rational cognition of things by means\nof concepts (not merely, as logic does, principles of the form of\nthought in general without distinction of Objects), into _theoretical_\nand _practical_. But then the concepts, which furnish their Object\nto the principles of this rational cognition, must be specifically\ndistinct; otherwise they would not justify a division, which always\npresupposes a contrast between the principles of the rational cognition\nbelonging to the different parts of a science.\nNow there are only two kinds of concepts, and these admit as many\ndistinct principles of the possibility of their objects, viz. _natural\nconcepts_ and the _concept of freedom_. The former render possible\n_theoretical_ cognition according to principles _a priori_; the latter\nin respect of this theoretical cognition only supplies in itself a\nnegative principle (that of mere contrast), but on the other hand it\nfurnishes fundamental propositions which extend the sphere of the\ndetermination of the will and are therefore called practical. Thus\nPhilosophy is correctly divided into two parts, quite distinct in\ntheir principles; the theoretical part or _Natural Philosophy_, and\nthe practical part or _Moral Philosophy_ (for that is the name given\nto the practical legislation of Reason in accordance with the concept\nof freedom). But up to the present a gross misuse of these expressions\nhas prevailed, both in the division of the different principles and\nconsequently also of Philosophy itself. For what is practical according\nto natural concepts has been identified with the practical according\nto the concept of freedom; and so with the like titles, \u2018theoretical\u2019\nand \u2018practical\u2019 Philosophy, a division has been made, by which in\nfact nothing has been divided (for both parts might in such case have\nprinciples of the same kind).\nThe will, regarded as the faculty of desire, is (in this view) one\nof the many natural causes in the world, viz. that cause which acts\nin accordance with concepts. All that is represented as possible (or\nnecessary) by means of a will is called practically possible (or\nnecessary); as distinguished from the physical possibility or necessity\nof an effect, whose cause is not determined to causality by concepts\n(but in lifeless matter by mechanism and in animals by instinct).\nHere, in respect of the practical, it is left undetermined whether the\nconcept which gives the rule to the causality of the will, is a natural\nconcept or a concept of freedom.\nBut the last distinction is essential. For if the concept which\ndetermines the causality is a natural concept, then the principles are\n_technically practical_; whereas, if it is a concept of freedom they\nare _morally practical_. And as the division of a rational science\ndepends on the distinction between objects whose cognition needs\ndistinct principles, the former will belong to theoretical Philosophy\n(doctrine of Nature), but the latter alone will constitute the second\npart, viz. practical Philosophy (doctrine of Morals).\nAll technically practical rules (_i.e._ the rules of art and skill\ngenerally, or of prudence regarded as skill in exercising an influence\nover men and their wills), so far as their principles rest on concepts,\nmust be reckoned only as corollaries to theoretical Philosophy. For\nthey concern only the possibility of things according to natural\nconcepts, to which belong not only the means which are to be met\nwith in nature, but also the will itself (as a faculty of desire\nand consequently a natural faculty), so far as it can be determined\nconformably to these rules by natural motives. However, practical\nrules of this kind are not called laws (like physical laws), but only\nprecepts; because the will does not stand merely under the natural\nconcept, but also under the concept of freedom, in relation to which\nits principles are called laws. These with their consequences alone\nconstitute the second or practical part of Philosophy.\nThe solution of the problems of pure geometry does not belong to a\nparticular part of the science; mensuration does not deserve the\nname of practical, in contrast to pure, geometry, as a second part\nof geometry in general; and just as little ought the mechanical\nor chemical art of experiment or observation to be reckoned as a\npractical part of the doctrine of Nature. Just as little, in fine,\nought housekeeping, farming, statesmanship, the art of conversation,\nthe prescribing of diet, the universal doctrine of happiness itself,\nor the curbing of the inclinations and checking of the affections\nfor the sake of happiness, to be reckoned as practical Philosophy,\nor taken to constitute the second part of Philosophy in general.\nFor all these contain only rules of skill (and are consequently only\ntechnically practical) for bringing about an effect that is possible\naccording to the natural concepts of causes and effects, which, since\nthey belong to theoretical Philosophy, are subject to those precepts\nas mere corollaries from it (viz. natural science), and can therefore\nclaim no place in a special Philosophy called practical. On the other\nhand, the morally practical precepts, which are altogether based on the\nconcept of freedom to the complete exclusion of the natural determining\ngrounds of the will, constitute a quite special class. These, like the\nrules which nature obeys, are called simply laws, but they do not, like\nthem, rest on sensuous conditions but on a supersensible principle;\nand accordingly they require for themselves a quite different part of\nPhilosophy, called practical, corresponding to its theoretical part.\nWe hence see that a complex of practical precepts given by Philosophy\ndoes not constitute a distinct part of Philosophy, as opposed to the\ntheoretical part, because these precepts are practical; for they might\nbe that, even if their principles were derived altogether from the\ntheoretical cognition of nature (as technically practical rules). [A\ndistinct branch of Philosophy is constituted only] if their principle,\nas it is not borrowed from the natural concept, which is always\nsensuously conditioned, rests on the supersensible, which alone makes\nthe concept of freedom cognisable by formal laws. These precepts are\nthen morally practical, _i.e._ not merely precepts or rules in this\nor that aspect, but, without any preceding reference to purposes and\ndesigns, are laws.\nII. OF THE REALM OF PHILOSOPHY IN GENERAL\nSo far as our concepts have _a priori_ application, so far extends\nthe use of our cognitive faculty according to principles, and with it\nPhilosophy.\nBut the complex of all objects, to which those concepts are referred,\nin order to bring about a knowledge of them where it is possible,\nmay be subdivided according to the adequacy or inadequacy of our\n[cognitive] faculty to this design.\nConcepts, so far as they are referred to objects, independently of the\npossibility or impossibility of the cognition of these objects, have\ntheir field which is determined merely according to the relation that\ntheir Object has to our cognitive faculty in general. The part of this\nfield in which knowledge is possible for us is a ground or territory\n(_territorium_) for these concepts and the requisite cognitive faculty.\nThe part of this territory, where they are legislative, is the realm\n(_ditio_) of these concepts and of the corresponding cognitive\nfaculties. Empirical concepts have, therefore, their territory in\nnature, as the complex of all objects of sense, but no realm, only\na dwelling-place (_domicilium_); for though they are produced in\nconformity to law they are not legislative, but the rules based on them\nare empirical and consequently contingent.\nOur whole cognitive faculty has two realms, that of natural concepts\nand that of the concept of freedom; for through both it is legislative\n_a priori_. In accordance with this, Philosophy is divided into\ntheoretical and practical. But the territory to which its realm extends\nand in which its legislation is _exercised_, is always only the complex\nof objects of all possible experience, so long as they are taken for\nnothing more than mere phenomena; for otherwise no legislation of the\nUnderstanding in respect of them is conceivable.\nLegislation through natural concepts is carried on by means of the\nUnderstanding and is theoretical. Legislation through the concept of\nfreedom is carried on by the Reason and is merely practical. It is\nonly in the practical [sphere] that the Reason can be legislative;\nin respect of theoretical cognition (of nature) it can merely (as\nacquainted with law by the Understanding) deduce from given laws\nconsequences which always remain within [the limits of] nature. But on\nthe other hand, Reason is not always therefore _legislative_, where\nthere are practical rules, for they may be only technically practical.\nUnderstanding and Reason exercise, therefore, two distinct legislations\nin regard to one and the same territory of experience, without\nprejudice to each other. The concept of freedom as little disturbs\nthe legislation of nature, as the natural concept influences the\nlegislation through the former.--The possibility of at least thinking\nwithout contradiction the co-existence of both legislations, and of\nthe corresponding faculties in the same subject, has been shown in the\nCritique of pure Reason; for it annulled the objections on the other\nside by exposing the dialectical illusion which they contain.\nThese two different realms then do not limit each other in their\nlegislation, though they perpetually do so in the world of sense.\nThat they do not constitute _one_ realm, arises from this, that the\nnatural concept represents its objects in intuition, not as things\nin themselves, but as mere phenomena; the concept of freedom, on the\nother hand, represents in its Object a thing in itself, but not in\nintuition. Hence, neither of them can furnish a theoretical knowledge\nof its Object (or even of the thinking subject) as a thing in itself;\nthis would be the supersensible, the Idea of which we must indeed make\nthe basis of the possibility of all these objects of experience, but\nwhich we can never extend or elevate into a cognition.\nThere is, then, an unbounded but also inaccessible field for our whole\ncognitive faculty--the field of the supersensible--wherein we find no\nterritory, and, therefore, can have in it, for theoretical cognition,\nno realm either for concepts of Understanding or Reason. This field we\nmust indeed occupy with Ideas on behalf of the theoretical as well as\nthe practical use of Reason, but we can supply to them in reference to\nthe laws [arising] from the concept of freedom no other than practical\nreality, by which our theoretical cognition is not extended in the\nslightest degree towards the supersensible.\nNow even if an immeasurable gulf is fixed between the sensible realm\nof the concept of nature and the supersensible realm of the concept of\nfreedom, so that no transition is possible from the first to the second\n(by means of the theoretical use of Reason), just as if they were two\ndifferent worlds of which the first could have no influence upon the\nsecond, yet the second is _meant_ to have an influence upon the first.\nThe concept of freedom is meant to actualise in the world of sense\nthe purpose proposed by its laws, and consequently nature must be so\nthought that the conformity to law of its form, at least harmonises\nwith the possibility of the purposes to be effected in it according to\nlaws of freedom.--There must, therefore, be a ground of the _unity_\nof the supersensible, which lies at the basis of nature, with that\nwhich the concept of freedom practically contains; and the concept\nof this ground, although it does not attain either theoretically or\npractically to a knowledge of the same, and hence has no peculiar\nrealm, nevertheless makes possible the transition from the mode of\nthought according to the principles of the one to that according to the\nprinciples of the other.\nIII. OF THE CRITIQUE OF JUDGEMENT AS A MEANS OF COMBINING THE TWO PARTS\nOF PHILOSOPHY INTO A WHOLE.\nThe Critique of the cognitive faculties, as regards what they can\nfurnish _a priori_, has properly speaking no realm in respect of\nObjects, because it is not a doctrine, but only has to investigate\nwhether and how, in accordance with the state of these faculties, a\ndoctrine is possible by their means. Its field extends to all their\npretensions, in order to confine them within their legitimate bounds.\nBut what cannot enter into the division of Philosophy may yet enter,\nas a chief part, into the Critique of the pure faculty of cognition in\ngeneral, viz. if it contains principles which are available neither for\ntheoretical nor for practical use.\nThe natural concepts, which contain the ground of all\ntheoretical knowledge _a priori_, rest on the legislation of the\nUnderstanding.--The concept of freedom, which contains the ground of\nall sensuously-unconditioned practical precepts _a priori_, rests on\nthe legislation of the Reason. Both faculties, therefore, besides being\ncapable of application as regards their logical form to principles of\nwhatever origin, have also as regards their content, their special\nlegislations above which there is no other (_a priori_); and hence the\ndivision of Philosophy into theoretical and practical is justified.\nBut in the family of the higher cognitive faculties there is a middle\nterm between the Understanding and the Reason. This is the _Judgement_,\nof which we have cause for supposing according to analogy that it\nmay contain in itself, if not a special legislation, yet a special\nprinciple of its own to be sought according to laws, though merely\nsubjective _a priori_. This principle, even if it have no field of\nobjects as its realm, yet may have somewhere a territory with a certain\ncharacter, for which no other principle can be valid.\nBut besides (to judge by analogy) there is a new ground for bringing\nthe Judgement into connexion with another arrangement of our\nrepresentative faculties, which seems to be of even greater importance\nthan that of its relationship with the family of the cognitive\nfaculties. For all faculties or capacities of the soul can be reduced\nto three, which cannot be any further derived from one common ground:\nthe _faculty of knowledge_, the _feeling of pleasure and pain_, and the\n_faculty of desire_.[9] For the faculty of knowledge the Understanding\nis alone legislative, if (as must happen when it is considered by\nitself without confusion with the faculty of desire) this faculty is\nreferred to nature as the faculty of _theoretical knowledge_; for in\nrespect of nature (as phenomenon) it is alone possible for us to give\nlaws by means of natural concepts _a priori_, _i.e._ by pure concepts\nof Understanding.--For the faculty of desire, as a higher faculty\naccording to the concept of freedom, the Reason (in which alone this\nconcept has a place) is alone _a priori_ legislative.--Now between the\nfaculties of knowledge and desire there is the feeling of pleasure,\njust as the Judgement is intermediate between the Understanding and\nthe Reason. We may therefore suppose provisionally that the Judgement\nlikewise contains in itself an _a priori_ principle. And as pleasure\nor pain is necessarily combined with the faculty of desire (either\npreceding this principle as in the lower desires, or following it as\nin the higher, when the desire is determined by the moral law), we may\nalso suppose that the Judgement will bring about a transition from the\npure faculty of knowledge, the realm of natural concepts, to the realm\nof the concept of freedom, just as in its logical use it makes possible\nthe transition from Understanding to Reason.\nAlthough, then, Philosophy can be divided only into two main parts,\nthe theoretical and the practical, and although all that we may be\nable to say of the special principles of Judgement must be counted as\nbelonging in it to the theoretical part, _i.e._ to rational cognition\nin accordance with natural concepts; yet the Critique of pure Reason,\nwhich must decide all this, as regards the possibility of the system\nbefore undertaking it, consists of three parts; the Critique of pure\nUnderstanding, of pure Judgement, and of pure Reason, which faculties\nare called pure because they are legislative _a priori_.\nIV. OF JUDGEMENT AS A FACULTY LEGISLATING _A PRIORI_\nJudgement in general is the faculty of thinking the particular as\ncontained under the Universal. If the universal (the rule, the\nprinciple, the law) be given, the Judgement which subsumes the\nparticular under it (even if, as transcendental Judgement, it furnishes\n_a priori_, the conditions in conformity with which subsumption under\nthat universal is alone possible) is _determinant_. But if only the\nparticular be given for which the universal has to be found, the\nJudgement is merely _reflective_.\nThe determinant Judgement only subsumes under universal transcendental\nlaws given by the Understanding; the law is marked out for it, _a\npriori_, and it has therefore no need to seek a law for itself in\norder to be able to subordinate the particular in nature to the\nuniversal.--But the forms of nature are so manifold, and there\nare so many modifications of the universal transcendental natural\nconcepts left undetermined by the laws given, _a priori_, by the pure\nUnderstanding,--because these only concern the possibility of a nature\nin general (as an object of sense),--that there must be laws for these\n[forms] also. These, as empirical, may be contingent from the point\nof view of _our_ Understanding, and yet, if they are to be called\nlaws (as the concept of a nature requires), they must be regarded as\nnecessary in virtue of a principle of the unity of the manifold, though\nit be unknown to us.--The reflective Judgement, which is obliged to\nascend from the particular in nature to the universal, requires on that\naccount a principle that it cannot borrow from experience, because its\nfunction is to establish the unity of all empirical principles under\nhigher ones, and hence to establish the possibility of their systematic\nsubordination. Such a transcendental principle, then, the reflective\nJudgement can only give as a law from and to itself. It cannot derive\nit from outside (because then it would be the determinant Judgement);\nnor can it prescribe it to nature, because reflection upon the laws\nof nature adjusts itself by nature, and not nature by the conditions\naccording to which we attempt to arrive at a concept of it which is\nquite contingent in respect of these.\nThis principle can be no other than the following: As universal laws\nof nature have their ground in our Understanding, which prescribes\nthem to nature (although only according to the universal concept of\nit as nature); so particular empirical laws, in respect of what is in\nthem left undetermined by these universal laws, must be considered in\naccordance with such a unity as they would have if an Understanding\n(although not our Understanding) had furnished them to our cognitive\nfaculties, so as to make possible a system of experience according\nto particular laws of nature. Not as if, in this way, such an\nUnderstanding must be assumed as actual (for it is only our reflective\nJudgement to which this Idea serves as a principle--for reflecting, not\nfor determining); but this faculty thus gives a law only to itself and\nnot to nature.\nNow the concept of an Object, so far as it contains the ground of\nthe actuality of this Object, is the _purpose_; and the agreement\nof a thing with that constitution of things, which is only possible\naccording to purposes, is called the _purposiveness_ of its form. Thus\nthe principle of Judgement, in respect of the form of things of nature\nunder empirical laws generally, is the _purposiveness of nature_ in its\nmanifoldness. That is, nature is represented by means of this concept,\nas if an Understanding contained the ground of the unity of the\nmanifold of its empirical laws.\nThe purposiveness of nature is therefore a particular concept, _a\npriori_, which has its origin solely in the reflective Judgement. For\nwe cannot ascribe to natural products anything like a reference of\nnature in them to purposes; we can only use this concept to reflect\nupon such products in respect of the connexion of phenomena which is\ngiven in nature according to empirical laws. This concept is also quite\ndifferent from practical purposiveness (in human art or in morals),\nthough it is certainly thought according to the analogy of these last.\nV. THE PRINCIPLE OF THE FORMAL PURPOSIVENESS OF NATURE IS A\nTRANSCENDENTAL PRINCIPLE OF JUDGEMENT.\nA transcendental principle is one by means of which is represented, _a\npriori_, the universal condition under which alone things can be in\ngeneral Objects of our cognition. On the other hand, a principle is\ncalled metaphysical if it represents the _a priori_ condition under\nwhich alone Objects, whose concept must be empirically given, can be\nfurther determined _a priori_. Thus the principle of the cognition of\nbodies as substances, and as changeable substances, is transcendental,\nif thereby it is asserted that their changes must have a cause; it is\nmetaphysical if it asserts that their changes must have an _external_\ncause. For in the former case bodies need only be thought by means\nof ontological predicates (pure concepts of Understanding), _e.g._\nsubstance, in order to cognise the proposition _a priori_; but in\nthe latter case the empirical concept of a body (as a movable thing\nin space) must lie at the basis of the proposition, although once\nthis basis has been laid down, it may be seen completely _a priori_\nthat this latter predicate (motion only by external causes) belongs\nto body.--Thus, as I shall presently show, the principle of the\npurposiveness of nature (in the manifoldness of its empirical laws) is\na transcendental principle. For the concept of Objects, so far as they\nare thought as standing under this principle, is only the pure concept\nof objects of possible empirical cognition in general and contains\nnothing empirical. On the other hand, the principle of practical\npurposiveness, which must be thought in the Idea of the _determination_\nof a free _will_, is a metaphysical principle; because the concept of a\nfaculty of desire as a will must be given empirically (_i.e._ does not\nbelong to transcendental predicates). Both principles are, however, not\nempirical, but _a priori_; because for the combination of the predicate\nwith the empirical concept of the subject of their judgements no\nfurther experience is needed, but it can be apprehended completely _a\npriori_.\nThat the concept of a purposiveness of nature belongs to transcendental\nprinciples can be sufficiently seen from the maxims of the Judgement,\nwhich lie at the basis of the investigation of nature _a priori_,\nand yet do not go further than the possibility of experience, and\nconsequently of the cognition of nature--not indeed nature in general,\nbut nature as determined through a variety of particular laws. These\nmaxims present themselves in the course of this science often enough,\nthough in a scattered way, as sentences of metaphysical wisdom,\nwhose necessity we cannot demonstrate from concepts. \u201cNature takes\nthe shortest way (_lex parsimoniae_); at the same time it makes no\nleaps, either in the course of its changes or in the juxtaposition\nof specifically different forms (_lex continui in natura_); its\ngreat variety in empirical laws is yet unity under a few principles\n(_principia praeter necessitatem non sunt multiplicanda_),\u201d etc.\nIf we propose to set forth the origin of these fundamental propositions\nand try to do so by the psychological method, we violate their sense.\nFor they do not tell us what happens, _i.e._ by what rule our cognitive\npowers actually operate, and how we judge, but how we ought to judge;\nand this logical objective necessity does not emerge if the principles\nare merely empirical. Hence that purposiveness of nature for our\ncognitive faculties and their use, which is plainly apparent from them,\nis a transcendental principle of judgements, and needs therefore also a\nTranscendental Deduction, by means of which the ground for so judging\nmust be sought in the sources of cognition _a priori_.\nWe find in the grounds of the possibility of an experience in the\nvery first place something necessary, viz. the universal laws without\nwhich nature in general (as an object of sense) cannot be thought;\nand these rest upon the Categories, applied to the formal conditions\nof all intuition possible for us, so far as it is also given _a\npriori_. Now under these laws the Judgement is determinant, for it\nhas nothing to do but to subsume under given laws. For example, the\nUnderstanding says that every change has its cause (universal law of\nnature); the transcendental Judgement has nothing further to do than\nto supply _a priori_ the condition of subsumption under the concept\nof the Understanding placed before it, _i.e._ the succession [in\ntime] of the determinations of one and the same thing. For nature in\ngeneral (as an object of possible experience) that law is cognised as\nabsolutely necessary.--But now the objects of empirical cognition are\ndetermined in many other ways than by that formal time-condition,\nor, at least as far as we can judge _a priori_, are determinable.\nHence specifically different natures can be causes in an infinite\nvariety of ways, as well as in virtue of what they have in common\nas belonging to nature in general; and each of these modes must (in\naccordance with the concept of a cause in general) have its rule, which\nis a law and therefore brings necessity with it, although we do not\nat all comprehend this necessity, in virtue of the constitution and\nthe limitations of our cognitive faculties. We must therefore think\nin nature, in respect of its merely empirical laws, a possibility of\ninfinitely various empirical laws, which are, as far as our insight\ngoes, contingent (cannot be cognised _a priori_), and in respect of\nwhich we judge nature, according to empirical laws and the possibility\nof the unity of experience (as a system according to empirical laws),\nto be contingent. But such a unity must be necessarily presupposed and\nassumed, for otherwise there would be no thoroughgoing connexion of\nempirical cognitions in a whole of experience. The universal laws of\nnature no doubt furnish such a connexion of things according to their\nkind as things of nature in general, but not specifically, as such\nparticular beings of nature. Hence the Judgement must assume for its\nspecial use this principle _a priori_, that what in the particular\n(empirical) laws of nature is from the human point of view contingent,\nyet contains a unity of law in the combination of its manifold into an\nexperience possible in itself--a unity not indeed to be fathomed by us,\nbut yet thinkable. Consequently as the unity of law in a combination,\nwhich we cognise as contingent in itself, although in conformity with\na necessary design (a need) of Understanding, is represented as the\npurposiveness of Objects (here of nature); so must the Judgement, which\nin respect of things under possible (not yet discovered) empirical\nlaws is merely reflection, think of nature in respect of the latter\naccording to _a principle of purposiveness_ for our cognitive faculty,\nwhich then is expressed in the above maxims of the Judgement. This\ntranscendental concept of a purposiveness of nature is neither a\nnatural concept nor a concept of freedom, because it ascribes nothing\nto the Object (of nature), but only represents the peculiar way in\nwhich we must proceed in reflection upon the objects of nature in\nreference to a thoroughly connected experience, and is consequently a\nsubjective principle (maxim) of the Judgement. Hence, as if it were a\nlucky chance favouring our design, we are rejoiced (properly speaking,\nrelieved of a want), if we meet with such systematic unity under merely\nempirical laws; although we must necessarily assume that there is such\na unity without our comprehending it or being able to prove it.\nIn order to convince ourselves of the correctness of this Deduction\nof the concept before us, and the necessity of assuming it as a\ntranscendental principle of cognition, just consider the magnitude of\nthe problem. The problem, which lies _a priori_ in our Understanding,\nis to make a connected experience out of given perceptions of a nature\ncontaining at all events an infinite variety of empirical laws. The\nUnderstanding is, no doubt, in possession _a priori_ of universal laws\nof nature, without which nature could not be an object of experience;\nbut it needs in addition a certain order of nature in its particular\nrules, which can only be empirically known and which are, as regards\nthe Understanding, contingent. These rules, without which we could\nnot proceed from the universal analogy of a possible experience in\ngeneral to the particular, must be thought by it as laws (_i.e._ as\nnecessary), for otherwise they would not constitute an order of nature;\nalthough their necessity can never be cognised or comprehended by\nit. Although, therefore, the Understanding can determine nothing _a\npriori_ in respect of Objects, it must, in order to trace out these\nempirical so-called laws, place at the basis of all reflection upon\nObjects an _a priori_ principle, viz. that a cognisable order of nature\nis possible in accordance with these laws. The following propositions\nexpress some such principle. There is in nature a subordination of\ngenera and species comprehensible by us. Each one approximates to some\nother according to a common principle, so that a transition from one to\nanother and so on to a higher genus may be possible. Though it seems at\nthe outset unavoidable for our Understanding to assume different kinds\nof causality for the specific differences of natural operations, yet\nthese different kinds may stand under a small number of principles,\nwith the investigation of which we have to busy ourselves. This harmony\nof nature with our cognitive faculty is presupposed _a priori_ by the\nJudgement, on behalf of its reflection upon nature in accordance with\nits empirical laws; whilst the Understanding at the same time cognises\nit objectively as contingent, and it is only the Judgement that\nascribes it to nature as a trancendental purposiveness (in relation to\nthe cognitive faculty of the subject). For without this presupposition\nwe should have no order of nature in accordance with empirical laws,\nand consequently no guiding thread for an experience ordered by these\nin all their variety, or for an investigation of them.\nFor it might easily be thought that, in spite of all the uniformity of\nnatural things according to the universal laws, without which we should\nnot have the form of an empirical cognition in general, the specific\nvariety of the empirical laws of nature including their effects might\nyet be so great, that it would be impossible for our Understanding, to\ndetect in nature a comprehensible order; to divide its products into\ngenera and species, so as to use the principles which explain and make\nintelligible one for the explanation and comprehension of another; or\nout of such confused material (strictly we should say, so infinitely\nvarious and not to be measured by our faculty of comprehension) to make\na connected experience.\nThe Judgement has therefore also in itself a principle _a priori_ of\nthe possibility of nature, but only in a subjective aspect; by which\nit prescribes, not to nature (autonomy), but to itself (heautonomy)\na law for its reflection upon nature. This we might call the _law of\nthe specification of nature_ in respect of its empirical laws. The\nJudgement does not cognise this _a priori_ in nature, but assumes it\non behalf of a natural order cognisable by our Understanding in the\ndivision which it makes of the universal laws of nature when it wishes\nto subordinate to these the variety of particular laws. If then we say\nthat nature specifies its universal laws according to the principles of\npurposiveness for our cognitive faculty, _i.e._ in accordance with the\nnecessary business of the human Understanding of finding the universal\nfor the particular which perception offers it, and again of finding\nconnexion for the diverse (which however is a universal for each\nspecies) in the unity of a principle,--we thus neither prescribe to\nnature a law, nor do we learn one from it by observation (although such\na principle may be confirmed by this means). For it is not a principle\nof the determinant but merely of the reflective Judgement. We only\nrequire that, be nature disposed as it may as regards its universal\nlaws, investigation into its empirical laws may be carried on in\naccordance with that principle and the maxims founded thereon, because\nit is only so far as that holds that we can make any progress with the\nuse of our Understanding in experience, or gain knowledge.\nVI. OF THE COMBINATION OF THE FEELING OF PLEASURE WITH THE CONCEPT OF\nTHE PURPOSIVENESS OF NATURE.\nThe thought harmony of nature in the variety of its particular laws\nwith our need of finding universality of principles for it, must\nbe judged as contingent in respect of our insight, but yet at the\nsame time as indispensable for the needs of our Understanding, and\nconsequently as a purposiveness by which nature is harmonised with our\ndesign, which, however, has only knowledge for its aim. The universal\nlaws of the Understanding, which are at the same time laws of nature,\nare just as necessary (although arising from spontaneity) as the\nmaterial laws of motion. Their production presupposes no design on the\npart of our cognitive faculty, because it is only by means of them\nthat we, in the first place, attain a concept of what the cognition\nof things (of nature) is, and attribute them necessarily to nature as\nObject of our cognition in general. But, so far as we can see, it is\ncontingent that the order of nature according to its particular laws,\nin all its variety and heterogeneity possibly at least transcending\nour comprehension, should be actually conformable to these [laws]. The\ndiscovery of this [order] is the business of the Understanding which\nis designedly borne towards a necessary purpose, viz. the bringing of\nunity of principles into nature, which purpose then the Judgement must\nascribe to nature, because the Understanding cannot here prescribe any\nlaw to it.\nThe attainment of that design is bound up with the feeling of pleasure,\nand since the condition of this attainment is a representation\n_a priori_,--as here a principle for the reflective Judgement in\ngeneral,--therefore the feeling of pleasure is determined by a ground\n_a priori_ and valid for every man, and that merely by the reference of\nthe Object to the cognitive faculty, the concept of purposiveness here\nnot having the least reference to the faculty of desire. It is thus\nquite distinguished from all practical purposiveness of nature.\nIn fact, although from the agreement of perceptions with laws in\naccordance with universal natural concepts (the categories), we do not\nand cannot find in ourselves the slightest effect upon the feeling of\npleasure, because the Understanding necessarily proceeds according to\nits nature without any design; yet, on the other hand, the discovery\nthat two or more empirical heterogeneous laws of nature may be combined\nunder one principle comprehending them both, is the ground of a very\nmarked pleasure, often even of an admiration, which does not cease,\nthough we may be already quite familiar with the objects of it. We no\nlonger find, it is true, any marked pleasure in the comprehensibility\nof nature and in the unity of its divisions into genera and species,\nwhereby are possible all empirical concepts, through which we cognise\nit according to its particular laws. But this pleasure has certainly\nbeen present at one time, and it is only because the commonest\nexperience would be impossible without it that it is gradually\nconfounded with mere cognition and no longer arrests particular\nattention. There is then something in our judgements upon nature which\nmakes us attentive to its purposiveness for our Understanding--an\nendeavour to bring, where possible, its dissimilar laws under higher\nones, though still always empirical--and thus, if successful, makes\nus feel pleasure in that harmony of these with our cognitive faculty,\nwhich harmony we regard as merely contingent. On the other hand, a\nrepresentation of nature would altogether displease, by which it\nshould be foretold to us that in the smallest investigation beyond the\ncommonest experience we should meet with a heterogeneity of its laws,\nwhich would make the union of its particular laws under universal\nempirical laws impossible for our Understanding. For this would\ncontradict the principle of the subjectively-purposive specification of\nnature in its genera, and also of our reflective Judgement in respect\nof such principle.\nThis presupposition of the Judgement is, however, at the same time so\nindeterminate as to how far that ideal purposiveness of nature for\nour cognitive faculty should be extended, that if we were told that\na deeper or wider knowledge of nature derived from observation must\nlead at last to a variety of laws, which no human Understanding could\nreduce to a principle, we should at once acquiesce. But still we more\ngladly listen to one who offers hope that the more we know nature\ninternally, and can compare it with external members now unknown to\nus, the more simple shall we find it in its principles, and that the\nfurther our experience reaches the more uniform shall we find it amid\nthe apparent heterogeneity of its empirical laws. For it is a mandate\nof our Judgement to proceed according to the principle of the harmony\nof nature with our cognitive faculty so far as that reaches, without\ndeciding (because it is not the determinant Judgement which gives us\nthis rule) whether or not it is bounded anywhere. For although in\nrespect of the rational use of our cognitive faculty we can determine\nsuch bounds, this is not possible in the empirical field.\nVII. OF THE AESTHETICAL REPRESENTATION OF THE PURPOSIVENESS OF NATURE.\nThat which in the representation of an Object is merely subjective,\n_i.e._ which decides its reference to the subject, not to the object,\nis its aesthetical character; but that which serves or can be used\nfor the determination of the object (for cognition), is its logical\nvalidity. In the cognition of an object of sense both references\npresent themselves. In the sense-representation of external things\nthe quality of space wherein we intuite them is the merely subjective\n[element] of my representation (by which it remains undecided what\nthey may be in themselves as Objects), on account of which reference\nthe object is thought thereby merely as phenomenon. But space,\nnotwithstanding its merely subjective quality, is at the same time\nan ingredient in the cognition of things as phenomena. _Sensation_,\nagain (_i.e._ external sensation), expresses the merely subjective\n[element] of our representations of external things, but it is also the\nproper material (reale) of them (by which something existing is given),\njust as space is the mere form _a priori_ of the possibility of their\nintuition. Nevertheless, however, sensation is also employed in the\ncognition of external Objects.\nBut the subjective [element] in a representation _which cannot be\nan ingredient of cognition_, is the _pleasure_ or _pain_ which is\nbound up with it; for through it I cognise nothing in the object of\nthe representation, although it may be the effect of some cognition.\nNow the purposiveness of a thing, so far as it is represented in\nperception, is no characteristic of the Object itself (for such cannot\nbe perceived), although it may be inferred from a cognition of things.\nThe purposiveness, therefore, which precedes the cognition of an\nObject, and which, even without our wishing to use the representation\nof it for cognition, is, at the same time, immediately bound up\nwith it, is that subjective [element] which cannot be an ingredient\nin cognition. Hence the object is only called purposive, when its\nrepresentation is immediately combined with the feeling of pleasure;\nand this very representation is an aesthetical representation of\npurposiveness.--The only question is whether there is, in general, such\na representation of purposiveness.\nIf pleasure is bound up with the mere apprehension (_apprehensio_) of\nthe form of an object of intuition, without reference to a concept for\na definite cognition, then the representation is thereby not referred\nto the Object, but simply to the subject; and the pleasure can express\nnothing else than its harmony with the cognitive faculties which come\ninto play in the reflective Judgement, and so far as they are in play;\nand hence can only express a subjective formal purposiveness of the\nObject. For that apprehension of forms in the Imagination can never\ntake place without the reflective Judgement, though undesignedly,\nat least comparing them with its faculty of referring intuitions to\nconcepts. If now in this comparison the Imagination (as the faculty of\n_a priori_ intuitions) is placed by means of a given representation\nundesignedly in agreement with the Understanding, as the faculty of\nconcepts, and thus a feeling of pleasure is aroused, the object must\nthen be regarded as purposive for the reflective Judgement. Such a\njudgement is an aesthetical judgement upon the purposiveness of the\nObject, which does not base itself upon any present concept of the\nobject, nor does it furnish any such. In the case of an object whose\nform (not the matter of its representation, as sensation), in the mere\nreflection upon it (without reference to any concept to be obtained\nof it), is judged as the ground of a pleasure in the representation\nof such an Object, this pleasure is judged as bound up with the\nrepresentation necessarily; and, consequently, not only for the subject\nwhich apprehends this form, but for every judging being in general. The\nobject is then called beautiful; and the faculty of judging by means\nof such a pleasure (and, consequently, with universal validity) is\ncalled Taste. For since the ground of the pleasure is placed merely in\nthe form of the object for reflection in general--and, consequently,\nin no sensation of the object, and also without reference to any\nconcept which anywhere involves design--it is only the conformity\nto law in the empirical use of the Judgement in general (unity of\nthe Imagination with the Understanding) in the subject, with which\nthe representation of the Object in reflection, whose conditions are\nuniversally valid _a priori_, harmonises. And since this harmony of the\nobject with the faculties of the subject is contingent, it brings about\nthe representation of its purposiveness in respect of the cognitive\nfaculties of the subject.\nHere now is a pleasure, which, like all pleasure or pain that is not\nproduced through the concept of freedom (_i.e._ through the preceding\ndetermination of the higher faculties of desire by pure Reason), can\nnever be comprehended from concepts, as necessarily bound up with the\nrepresentation of an object. It must always be cognised as combined\nwith this only by means of reflective perception; and, consequently,\nlike all empirical judgements, it can declare no objective necessity\nand lay claim to no _a priori_ validity. But the judgement of taste\nalso claims, as every other empirical judgement does, to be valid\nfor every one; and in spite of its inner contingency this is always\npossible. The strange and irregular thing is that it is not an\nempirical concept, but a feeling of pleasure (consequently not a\nconcept at all), which by the judgement of taste is attributed to every\none,--just as if it were a predicate bound up with the cognition of the\nObject--and which is connected with the representation thereof.\nA singular judgement of experience, _e.g._, when we perceive a moveable\ndrop of water in an ice-crystal, may justly claim that every one\nelse should find it the same; because we have formed this judgement,\naccording to the universal conditions of the determinant faculty of\nJudgement, under the laws of a possible experience in general. Just\nin the same way he who feels pleasure in the mere reflection upon\nthe form of an object without respect to any concept, although this\njudgement be empirical and singular, justly claims the agreement\nof every one; because the ground of this pleasure is found in the\nuniversal, although subjective, condition of reflective judgements,\nviz., the purposive harmony of an object (whether a product of nature\nor of art) with the mutual relations of the cognitive faculties (the\nImagination and the Understanding), a harmony which is requisite for\nevery empirical cognition. The pleasure, therefore, in the judgement\nof taste is dependent on an empirical representation, and cannot be\nbound up _a priori_ with any concept (we cannot determine _a priori_\nwhat object is or is not according to taste; that we must find out\nby experiment). But the pleasure is the determining ground of this\njudgement only because we are conscious that it rests merely on\nreflection and on the universal though only subjective conditions\nof the harmony of that reflection with the cognition of Objects in\ngeneral, for which the form of the Object is purposive.\nThus the reason why judgements of taste according to their possibility\nare subjected to a Critique is that they presuppose a principle _a\npriori_, although this principle is neither one of cognition for the\nUnderstanding nor of practice for the Will, and therefore is not in any\nway determinant _a priori_.\nSusceptibility to pleasure from reflection upon the forms of things (of\nNature as well as of Art), indicates not only a purposiveness of the\nObjects in relation to the reflective Judgement, conformably to the\nconcept of nature in the subject; but also conversely a purposiveness\nof the subject in respect of the objects according to their form or\neven their formlessness, in virtue of the concept of freedom. Hence\nthe aesthetical judgement is not only related as a judgement of taste\nto the beautiful, but also as springing from a spiritual feeling is\nrelated to the _sublime_; and thus the Critique of the aesthetical\nJudgement must be divided into two corresponding sections.\nVIII. OF THE LOGICAL REPRESENTATION OF THE PURPOSIVENESS OF NATURE\nPurposiveness may be represented in an object given in experience\non a merely subjective ground, as the harmony of its form,--in the\n_apprehension_ (_apprehensio_) of it prior to any concept,--with the\ncognitive faculties, in order to unite the intuition with concepts\nfor a cognition generally. Or it may be represented objectively as\nthe harmony of the form of the object with the possibility of the\nthing itself, according to a concept of it which precedes and contains\nthe ground of this form. We have seen that the representation of\npurposiveness of the first kind rests on the immediate pleasure\nin the form of the object in the mere reflection upon it. But the\nrepresentation of purposiveness of the second kind, since it refers\nthe form of the Object, not to the cognitive faculties of the subject\nin the apprehension of it, but to a definite cognition of the object\nunder a given concept, has nothing to do with a feeling of pleasure in\nthings, but only with the Understanding in its judgement upon them.\nIf the concept of an object is given, the business of the Judgement\nin the use of the concept for cognition consists in _presentation_\n(_exhibitio_), _i.e._ in setting a corresponding intuition beside the\nconcept. This may take place either through our own Imagination, as\nin Art when we realise a preconceived concept of an object which is\na purpose of ours; or through Nature in its Technic (as in organised\nbodies) when we supply to it our concept of its purpose in order\nto judge of its products. In the latter case it is not merely the\n_purposiveness_ of nature in the form of the thing that is represented,\nbut this its product is represented as a _natural purpose_.--Although\nour concept of a subjective purposiveness of nature in its forms\naccording to empirical laws is not a concept of the Object, but only\na principle of the Judgement for furnishing itself with concepts amid\nthe immense variety of nature (and thus being able to ascertain its\nown position), yet we thus ascribe to nature as it were a regard to\nour cognitive faculty according to the analogy of purpose. Thus we can\nregard _natural beauty_ as the _presentation_ of the concept of the\nformal (merely subjective) purposiveness, and _natural purposes_ as\nthe presentation of the concept of a real (objective) purposiveness.\nThe former of these we judge of by Taste (aesthetically, by the medium\nof the feeling of pleasure), the latter by Understanding and Reason\n(logically, according to concepts).\nOn this is based the division of the Critique of Judgement into the\nCritique of _aesthetical_ and of _teleological_ Judgement. By the\nfirst we understand the faculty of judging of the formal purposiveness\n(otherwise called subjective) of Nature by means of the feeling of\npleasure or pain; by the second the faculty of judging its real\n(objective) purposiveness by means of Understanding and Reason.\nIn a Critique of Judgement the part containing the aesthetical\nJudgement is essential, because this alone contains a principle\nwhich the Judgement places quite _a priori_ at the basis of its\nreflection upon nature; viz., the principle of a formal purposiveness\nof nature, according to its particular (empirical) laws, for our\ncognitive faculty, without which the Understanding could not find\nitself in nature. On the other hand no reason _a priori_ could be\nspecified,--and even the possibility of a reason would not be apparent\nfrom the concept of nature as an object of experience whether general\nor particular,--why there should be objective purposes of nature,\n_i.e._ things which are only possible as natural purposes; but the\nJudgement, without containing such a principle _a priori_ in itself,\nin given cases (of certain products), in order to make use of the\nconcept of purposes on behalf of Reason, would only contain the rule\naccording to which that transcendental principle has already prepared\nthe Understanding to apply to nature the concept of a purpose (at least\nas regards its form).\nBut the transcendental principle which represents a purposiveness of\nnature (in subjective reference to our cognitive faculty) in the form\nof a thing as a principle by which we judge of nature, leaves it quite\nundetermined where and in what cases I have to judge of a product\naccording to a principle of purposiveness, and not rather according to\nuniversal natural laws. It leaves it to the _aesthetical_ Judgement\nto decide by taste the harmony of this product (of its form) with our\ncognitive faculty (so far as this decision rests not on any agreement\nwith concepts but on feeling). On the other hand, the Judgement\nteleologically employed furnishes conditions determinately under which\nsomething (_e.g._ an organised body) is to be judged according to\nthe Idea of a purpose of nature; but it can adduce no fundamental\nproposition from the concept of nature as an object of experience\nauthorising it to ascribe to nature _a priori_ a reference to purposes,\nor even indeterminately to assume this of such products in actual\nexperience. The reason of this is that we must have many particular\nexperiences, and consider them under the unity of their principle, in\norder to be able to cognise, even empirically, objective purposiveness\nin a certain object.--The aesthetical Judgement is therefore a special\nfaculty for judging of things according to a rule, but not according\nto concepts. The teleological Judgement is not a special faculty, but\nonly the reflective Judgement in general, so far as it proceeds, as it\nalways does in theoretical cognition, according to concepts; but in\nrespect of certain objects of nature according to special principles,\nviz., of a merely reflective Judgement, and not of a Judgement that\ndetermines Objects. Thus as regards its application it belongs to\nthe theoretical part of Philosophy; and on account of its special\nprinciples which are not determinant, as they must be in Doctrine, it\nmust constitute a special part of the Critique. On the other hand, the\naesthetical Judgement contributes nothing towards the knowledge of\nits objects, and thus must be reckoned as belonging to the criticism\nof the judging subject and its cognitive faculties, _only_ so far as\nthey are susceptible of _a priori_ principles, of whatever other use\n(theoretical or practical) they may be. This is the propaedeutic of all\nPhilosophy.\nIX. OF THE CONNEXION OF THE LEGISLATION OF UNDERSTANDING WITH THAT OF\nREASON BY MEANS OF THE JUDGEMENT\nThe Understanding legislates _a priori_ for nature as an Object of\nsense--for a theoretical knowledge of it in a possible experience.\nReason legislates _a priori_ for freedom and its peculiar casuality;\nas the supersensible in the subject, for an unconditioned practical\nknowledge. The realm of the natural concept under the one legislation\nand that of the concept of freedom under the other are entirely removed\nfrom all mutual influence which they might have on one another (each\naccording to its fundamental laws) by the great gulf that separates\nthe supersensible from phenomena. The concept of freedom determines\nnothing in respect of the theoretical cognition of nature; and the\nnatural concept determines nothing in respect of the practical laws of\nfreedom. So far then it is not possible to throw a bridge from the one\nrealm to the other. But although the determining grounds of causality\naccording to the concept of freedom (and the practical rules which it\ncontains) are not resident in nature, and the sensible cannot determine\nthe supersensible in the subject, yet this is possible conversely (not,\nto be sure, in respect of the cognition of nature, but as regards\nthe effects of the supersensible upon the sensible). This in fact is\ninvolved in the concept of a causality through freedom, the _effect_\nof which is to take place in the world according to its formal laws.\nThe word _cause_, of course, when used of the supersensible only\nsignifies the _ground_ which determines the causality of natural\nthings to an effect in accordance with their proper natural laws,\nalthough harmoniously with the formal principle of the laws of\nReason. Although the possibility of this cannot be comprehended, yet\nthe objection of a contradiction alleged to be found in it can be\nsufficiently answered.[10]--The effect in accordance with the concept\nof freedom is the final purpose which (or its phenomenon in the world\nof sense) ought to exist; and the condition of the possibility of this\nis presupposed in nature (in the nature of the subject as a sensible\nbeing, that is, as man). The Judgement presupposes this _a priori_ and\nwithout reference to the practical; and thus furnishes the mediating\nconcept between the concepts of nature and that of freedom. It makes\npossible the transition from the conformity to law in accordance with\nthe former to the final purpose in accordance with the latter, and this\nby the concept of a _purposiveness_ of nature. For thus is cognised\nthe possibility of the final purpose which alone can be actualised in\nnature in harmony with its laws.\nThe Understanding by the possibility of its _a priori_ laws for\nnature, gives a proof that nature is only cognised by us as phenomenon;\nand implies at the same time that it has a supersensible substrate,\nthough it leaves this quite _undetermined_. The Judgement by its _a\npriori_ principle for the judging of nature according to its possible\nparticular laws, makes the supersensible substrate (both in us and\nwithout us) _determinable by means of the intellectual faculty_. But\nthe Reason by its practical _a priori_ law _determines_ it; and thus\nthe Judgement makes possible the transition from the realm of the\nconcept of nature to that of the concept of freedom.\nAs regards the faculties of the soul in general, in their higher\naspect, as containing an autonomy; the Understanding is that which\ncontains the _constitutive_ principles _a priori_ for the _cognitive\nfaculty_ (the theoretical cognition of nature). For the _feeling of\npleasure and pain_ there is the Judgement, independently of concepts\nand sensations which relate to the determination of the faculty of\ndesire and can thus be immediately practical. For the _faculty of\ndesire_ there is the Reason which is practical without the mediation\nof any pleasure whatever. It determines for the faculty of desire,\nas a superior faculty, the final purpose which carries with it the\npure intellectual satisfaction in the Object.--The concept formed by\nJudgement of a purposiveness of nature belongs to natural concepts,\nbut only as a regulative principle of the cognitive faculty; although\nthe aesthetical judgement upon certain objects (of Nature or Art)\nwhich occasions it is, in respect of the feeling of pleasure or pain,\na constitutive principle. The spontaneity in the play of the cognitive\nfaculties, the harmony of which contains the ground of this pleasure,\nmakes the above concept [of the purposiveness of nature] fit to be the\nmediating link between the realm of the natural concept and that of the\nconcept of freedom in its effects; whilst at the same time it promotes\nthe sensibility of the mind for moral feeling.--The following table may\nfacilitate the review of all the higher faculties according to their\nsystematic unity.[11]\n_All the faculties of the mind_\nCognitive faculties.

The judgement of\ntaste is therefore not a judgement of cognition, and is consequently\nnot logical but aesthetical, by which we understand that whose\ndetermining ground can be _no other than subjective_. Every reference\nof representations, even that of sensations, may be objective (and\nthen it signifies the real in an empirical representation); save only\nthe reference to the feeling of pleasure and pain, by which nothing in\nthe Object is signified, but through which there is a feeling in the\nsubject, as it is affected by the representation.\nTo apprehend a regular, purposive building by means of one\u2019s\ncognitive faculty (whether in a clear or a confused way of\nrepresentation) is something quite different from being conscious of\nthis representation as connected with the sensation of satisfaction.\nHere the representation is altogether referred to the subject and\nto its feeling of life, under the name of the feeling of pleasure\nor pain. This establishes a quite separate faculty of distinction\nand of judgement, adding nothing to cognition, but only comparing\nthe given representation in the subject with the whole faculty of\nrepresentations, of which the mind is conscious in the feeling of\nits state. Given representations in a judgement can be empirical\n(consequently, aesthetical); but the judgement which is formed by means\nof them is logical, provided they are referred in the judgement to the\nObject. Conversely, if the given representations are rational, but are\nreferred in a judgement simply to the subject (to its feeling), the\njudgement is so far always aesthetical.\n\u00a7 2. _The satisfaction which determines the judgement of taste is\ndisinterested_\nThe satisfaction which we combine with the representation of the\nexistence of an object is called interest. Such satisfaction always\nhas reference to the faculty of desire, either as its determining\nground or as necessarily connected with its determining ground. Now\nwhen the question is if a thing is beautiful, we do not want to know\nwhether anything depends or can depend on the existence of the thing\neither for myself or for any one else, but how we judge it by mere\nobservation (intuition or reflection). If any one asks me if I find\nthat palace beautiful which I see before me, I may answer: I do not\nlike things of that kind which are made merely to be stared at. Or I\ncan answer like that Iroquois _sachem_ who was pleased in Paris by\nnothing more than by the cook-shops. Or again after the manner of\n_Rousseau_ I may rebuke the vanity of the great who waste the sweat of\nthe people on such superfluous things. In fine I could easily convince\nmyself that if I found myself on an uninhabited island without the\nhope of ever again coming among men, and could conjure up just such\na splendid building by my mere wish, I should not even give myself\nthe trouble if I had a sufficiently comfortable hut. This may all be\nadmitted and approved; but we are not now talking of this. We wish\nonly to know if this mere representation of the object is accompanied\nin me with satisfaction, however indifferent I may be as regards the\nexistence of the object of this representation. We easily see that\nin saying it is _beautiful_ and in showing that I have taste, I am\nconcerned, not with that in which I depend on the existence of the\nobject, but with that which I make out of this representation in\nmyself. Every one must admit that a judgement about beauty, in which\nthe least interest mingles, is very partial and is not a pure judgement\nof taste. We must not be in the least prejudiced in favour of the\nexistence of the things, but be quite indifferent in this respect, in\norder to play the judge in things of taste.\nWe cannot, however, better elucidate this proposition, which is of\ncapital importance, than by contrasting the pure disinterested[13]\nsatisfaction in judgements of taste, with that which is bound up with\nan interest, especially if we can at the same time be certain that\nthere are no other kinds of interest than those which are now to be\nspecified.\n\u00a7 3. _The satisfaction in the_ PLEASANT _is bound up with interest_\n_That which pleases the senses in sensation is_ PLEASANT. Here the\nopportunity presents itself of censuring a very common confusion of\nthe double sense which the word sensation can have, and of calling\nattention to it. All satisfaction (it is said or thought) is itself\nsensation (of a pleasure). Consequently everything that pleases is\npleasant because it pleases (and according to its different degrees\nor its relations to other pleasant sensations it is _agreeable_,\n_lovely_, _delightful_, _enjoyable_, etc.). But if this be admitted,\nthen impressions of Sense which determine the inclination, fundamental\npropositions of Reason which determine the Will, mere reflective forms\nof intuition which determine the Judgement, are quite the same, as\nregards the effect upon the feeling of pleasure. For this would be\npleasantness in the sensation of one\u2019s state, and since in the end all\nthe operations of our faculties must issue in the practical and unite\nin it as their goal, we could suppose no other way of estimating things\nand their worth than that which consists in the gratification that\nthey promise. It is of no consequence at all how this is attained, and\nsince then the choice of means alone could make a difference, men could\nindeed blame one another for stupidity and indiscretion, but never for\nbaseness and wickedness. For all, each according to his own way of\nseeing things, seek one goal, that is, gratification.\nIf a determination of the feeling of pleasure or pain is called\nsensation, this expression signifies something quite different from\nwhat I mean when I call the representation of a thing (by sense, as a\nreceptivity belonging to the cognitive faculty) sensation. For in the\nlatter case the representation is referred to the Object, in the former\nsimply to the subject, and is available for no cognition whatever, not\neven for that by which the subject _cognises_ itself.\nIn the above elucidation we understand by the word sensation,\nan objective representation of sense; and in order to avoid\nmisinterpretation, we shall call that, which must always remain merely\nsubjective and can constitute absolutely no representation of an\nobject, by the ordinary term \u201cfeeling.\u201d The green colour of the meadows\nbelongs to _objective_ sensation, as a perception of an object of\nsense; the pleasantness of this belongs to _subjective_ sensation by\nwhich no object is represented, _i.e._ to feeling, by which the object\nis considered as an Object of satisfaction (which does not furnish a\ncognition of it).\nNow that a judgement about an object, by which I describe it as\npleasant, expresses an interest in it, is plain from the fact that by\nsensation it excites a desire for objects of that kind; consequently\nthe satisfaction presupposes not the mere judgement about it, but the\nrelation of its existence to my state, so far as this is affected\nby such an Object. Hence we do not merely say of the pleasant, _it\npleases_; but, _it gratifies_. I give to it no mere approval, but\ninclination is aroused by it; and in the case of what is pleasant\nin the most lively fashion, there is no judgement at all upon the\ncharacter of the Object, for those who always lay themselves out only\nfor enjoyment (for that is the word describing intense gratification)\nwould fain dispense with all judgement.\n\u00a7 4. _The satisfaction in the_ GOOD _is bound up with interest_\nWhatever by means of Reason pleases through the mere concept is GOOD.\nThat which pleases only as a means we call _good for something_ (the\nuseful); but that which pleases for itself is _good in itself_. In both\nthere is always involved the concept of a purpose, and consequently\nthe relation of Reason to the (at least possible) volition, and thus a\nsatisfaction in the _presence_ of an Object or an action, _i.e._ some\nkind of interest.\nIn order to find anything good, I must always know what sort of a\nthing the object ought to be, _i.e._ I must have a concept of it. But\nthere is no need of this, to find a thing beautiful. Flowers, free\ndelineations, outlines intertwined with one another without design\nand called foliage, have no meaning, depend on no definite concept,\nand yet they please. The satisfaction in the beautiful must depend\non the reflection upon an object, leading to any concept (however\nindefinite); and it is thus distinguished from the pleasant which rests\nentirely upon sensation.\nIt is true, the Pleasant seems in many cases to be the same as the\nGood. Thus people are accustomed to say that all gratification\n(especially if it lasts) is good in itself; which is very much the\nsame as to say that lasting pleasure and the good are the same. But\nwe can soon see that this is merely a confusion of words; for the\nconcepts which properly belong to these expressions can in no way be\ninterchanged. The pleasant, which, as such, represents the object\nsimply in relation to Sense, must first be brought by the concept of\na purpose under principles of Reason, in order to call it good, as an\nobject of the Will. But that there is [involved] a quite different\nrelation to satisfaction in calling that which gratifies at the same\ntime _good_, may be seen from the fact that in the case of the good the\nquestion always is, whether it is mediately or immediately good (useful\nor good in itself); but on the contrary in the case of the pleasant\nthere can be no question about this at all, for the word always\nsignifies something which pleases immediately. (The same is applicable\nto what I call beautiful.)\nEven in common speech men distinguish the Pleasant from the Good.\nOf a dish which stimulates the taste by spices and other condiments\nwe say unhesitatingly that it is pleasant, though it is at the same\ntime admitted not to be good; for though it immediately _delights_\nthe senses, yet mediately, _i.e._ considered by Reason which looks to\nthe after results, it displeases. Even in the judging of health we\nmay notice this distinction. It is immediately pleasant to every one\npossessing it (at least negatively, _i.e._ as the absence of all bodily\npains). But in order to say that it is good, it must be considered\nby Reason with reference to purposes; viz. that it is a state which\nmakes us fit for all our business. Finally in respect of happiness\nevery one believes himself entitled to describe the greatest sum of\nthe pleasantnesses of life (as regards both their number and their\nduration) as a true, even as the highest, good. However Reason is\nopposed to this. Pleasantness is enjoyment. And if we were concerned\nwith this alone, it would be foolish to be scrupulous as regards the\nmeans which procure it for us, or [to care] whether it is obtained\npassively by the bounty of nature or by our own activity and work.\nBut Reason can never be persuaded that the existence of a man who\nmerely lives for _enjoyment_ (however busy he may be in this point of\nview), has a worth in itself; even if he at the same time is conducive\nas a means to the best enjoyment of others, and shares in all their\ngratifications by sympathy. Only what he does, without reference to\nenjoyment, in full freedom and independently of what nature can procure\nfor him passively, gives an [absolute[14]] worth to his being, as the\nexistence of a person; and happiness, with the whole abundance of its\npleasures, is far from being an unconditioned good.[15]\nHowever, notwithstanding all this difference between the pleasant and\nthe good, they both agree in this that they are always bound up with an\ninterest in their object. [This is true] not only of the pleasant(\u00a7 3),\nand the mediate good (the useful) which is pleasing as a means towards\npleasantness somewhere, but also of that which is good absolutely and\nin every aspect, viz. moral good, which brings with it the highest\ninterest. For the good is the Object of will (_i.e._ of a faculty of\ndesire determined by Reason). But to will something, and to have a\nsatisfaction in its existence, _i.e._ to take an interest in it, are\nidentical.\n\u00a7 5. _Comparison of the three specifically different kinds of\nsatisfaction_\nThe pleasant and the good have both a reference to the faculty\nof desire; and they bring with them--the former a satisfaction\npathologically conditioned (by impulses, _stimuli_)--the latter a\npure practical satisfaction, which is determined not merely by the\nrepresentation of the object, but also by the represented connexion\nof the subject with the existence of the object. [It is not merely\nthe object that pleases, but also its existence.[16]] On the other\nhand, the judgement of taste is merely _contemplative_; _i.e._ it is\na judgement which, indifferent as regards the being of an object,\ncompares its character with the feeling of pleasure and pain. But this\ncontemplation itself is not directed to concepts; for the judgement of\ntaste is not a cognitive judgement (either theoretical or practical),\nand thus is not _based_ on concepts, nor has it concepts as its\n_purpose_.\nThe Pleasant, the Beautiful, and the Good, designate then, three\ndifferent relations of representations to the feeling of pleasure and\npain, in reference to which we distinguish from each other objects or\nmethods of representing them. And the expressions corresponding to\neach, by which we mark our complacency in them, are not the same. That\nwhich GRATIFIES a man is called _pleasant_; that which merely PLEASES\nhim is _beautiful_; that which is ESTEEMED [or _approved_[17]] by\nhim, _i.e._ that to which he accords an objective worth, is _good_.\nPleasantness concerns irrational animals also; but Beauty only\nconcerns men, _i.e._ animal, but still rational, beings--not merely\n_qu\u00e2_ rational (_e.g._ spirits), but _qu\u00e2_ animal also; and the Good\nconcerns every rational being in general. This is a proposition which\ncan only be completely established and explained in the sequel. We may\nsay that of all these three kinds of satisfaction, that of taste in\nthe Beautiful is alone a disinterested and _free_ satisfaction; for no\ninterest, either of Sense or of Reason, here forces our assent. Hence\nwe may say of satisfaction that it is related in the three aforesaid\ncases to _inclination_, to _favour_, or to _respect_. Now _favour_ is\nthe only free satisfaction. An object of inclination, and one that\nis proposed to our desire by a law of Reason, leave us no freedom in\nforming for ourselves anywhere an object of pleasure. All interest\npresupposes or generates a want; and, as the determining ground of\nassent, it leaves the judgement about the object no longer free.\nAs regards the interest of inclination in the case of the Pleasant,\nevery one says that hunger is the best sauce, and everything that is\neatable is relished by people with a healthy appetite; and thus a\nsatisfaction of this sort does not indicate choice directed by taste.\nIt is only when the want is appeased that we can distinguish which of\nmany men has or has not taste. In the same way there may be manners\n(conduct) without virtue, politeness without goodwill, decorum without\nmodesty, etc. For where the moral law speaks there is no longer,\nobjectively, a free choice as regards what is to be done; and to\ndisplay taste in its fulfilment (or in judging of another\u2019s fulfilment\nof it) is something quite different from manifesting the moral attitude\nof thought. For this involves a command and generates a want, whilst\nmoral taste only plays with the objects of satisfaction, without\nattaching itself to one of them.\nEXPLANATION OF THE BEAUTIFUL RESULTING FROM THE FIRST MOMENT\n_Taste_ is the faculty of judging of an object or a method of\nrepresenting it by an _entirely disinterested_ satisfaction\nor dissatisfaction. The object of such satisfaction is called\n_beautiful_.[18]\nSECOND MOMENT\nOF THE JUDGEMENT OF TASTE, VIZ. ACCORDING TO QUANTITY\n\u00a7 6. _The beautiful is that which apart from concepts is represented as\nthe object of a universal satisfaction_\nThis explanation of the beautiful can be derived from the preceding\nexplanation of it as the object of an entirely disinterested\nsatisfaction. For the fact of which every one is conscious, that the\nsatisfaction is for him quite disinterested, implies in his judgement a\nground of satisfaction for every one. For since it does not rest on any\ninclination of the subject (nor upon any other premeditated interest),\nbut since he who judges feels himself quite _free_ as regards the\nsatisfaction which he attaches to the object, he cannot find the ground\nof this satisfaction in any private conditions connected with his own\nsubject; and hence it must be regarded as grounded on what he can\npresuppose in every other man. Consequently he must believe that he has\nreason for attributing a similar satisfaction to every one. He will\ntherefore speak of the beautiful, as if beauty were a characteristic\nof the object and the judgement logical (constituting a cognition of\nthe Object by means of concepts of it); although it is only aesthetical\nand involves merely a reference of the representation of the object to\nthe subject. For it has this similarity to a logical judgement that we\ncan presuppose its validity for every one. But this universality cannot\narise from concepts; for from concepts there is no transition to the\nfeeling of pleasure or pain (except in pure practical laws, which bring\nan interest with them such as is not bound up with the pure judgement\nof taste). Consequently the judgement of taste, accompanied with the\nconsciousness of separation from all interest, must claim validity for\nevery one, without this universality depending on Objects. That is,\nthere must be bound up with it a title to subjective universality.\n\u00a7 7. _Comparison of the Beautiful with the Pleasant and the Good by\nmeans of the above characteristic_\nAs regards the Pleasant every one is content that his judgement, which\nhe bases upon private feeling, and by which he says of an object that\nit pleases him, should be limited merely to his own person. Thus he\nis quite contented that if he says \u201cCanary wine is pleasant,\u201d another\nman may correct his expression and remind him that he ought to say \u201cIt\nis pleasant _to me_.\u201d And this is the case not only as regards the\ntaste of the tongue, the palate, and the throat, but for whatever is\npleasant to any one\u2019s eyes and ears. To one violet colour is soft and\nlovely, to another it is faded and dead. One man likes the tone of wind\ninstruments, another that of strings. To strive here with the design of\nreproving as incorrect another man\u2019s judgement which is different from\nour own, as if the judgements were logically opposed, would be folly.\nAs regards the pleasant therefore the fundamental proposition is valid,\n_every one has his own taste_ (the taste of Sense).\nThe case is quite different with the Beautiful. It would (on the\ncontrary) be laughable if a man who imagined anything to his own taste,\nthought to justify himself by saying: \u201cThis object (the house we see,\nthe coat that person wears, the concert we hear, the poem submitted\nto our judgement) is beautiful _for me_.\u201d For he must not call it\n_beautiful_ if it merely pleases himself. Many things may have for\nhim charm and pleasantness; no one troubles himself at that; but if\nhe gives out anything as beautiful, he supposes in others the same\nsatisfaction--he judges not merely for himself, but for every one,\nand speaks of beauty as if it were a property of things. Hence he says\n\u201cthe _thing_ is beautiful\u201d; and he does not count on the agreement of\nothers with this his judgement of satisfaction, because he has found\nthis agreement several times before, but he _demands_ it of them. He\nblames them if they judge otherwise and he denies them taste, which he\nnevertheless requires from them. Here then we cannot say that each man\nhas his own particular taste. For this would be as much as to say that\nthere is no taste whatever; _i.e._ no aesthetical judgement, which can\nmake a rightful claim upon every one\u2019s assent.\nAt the same time we find as regards the Pleasant that there is an\nagreement among men in their judgements upon it, in regard to which\nwe deny Taste to some and attribute it to others; by this not meaning\none of our organic senses, but a faculty of judging in respect of the\npleasant generally. Thus we say of a man who knows how to entertain\nhis guests with pleasures (of enjoyment for all the senses), so that\nthey are all pleased, \u201che has taste.\u201d But here the universality is only\ntaken comparatively; and there emerge rules which are only _general_\n(like all empirical ones), and not _universal_; which latter the\njudgement of Taste upon the beautiful undertakes or lays claim to. It\nis a judgement in reference to sociability, so far as this rests on\nempirical rules. In respect of the Good it is true that judgements make\nrightful claim to validity for every one; but the Good is represented\nonly _by means of a concept_ as the Object of a universal satisfaction,\nwhich is the case neither with the Pleasant nor with the Beautiful.\n\u00a7 8. _The universality of the satisfaction is represented in a\njudgement of Taste only as subjective_\nThis particular determination of the universality of an aesthetical\njudgement, which is to be met with in a judgement of taste, is\nnoteworthy, not indeed for the logician, but for the transcendental\nphilosopher. It requires no small trouble to discover its origin, but\nwe thus detect a property of our cognitive faculty which without this\nanalysis would remain unknown.\nFirst, we must be fully convinced of the fact that in a judgement\nof taste (about the Beautiful) the satisfaction in the object is\nimputed to _every one_, without being based on a concept (for then\nit would be the Good). Further, this claim to universal validity so\nessentially belongs to a judgement by which we describe anything as\n_beautiful_, that if this were not thought in it, it would never come\ninto our thoughts to use the expression at all, but everything which\npleases without a concept would be counted as pleasant. In respect\nof the latter every one has his own opinion; and no one assumes, in\nanother, agreement with his judgement of taste, which is always the\ncase in a judgement of taste about beauty. I may call the first the\ntaste of Sense, the second the taste of Reflection; so far as the\nfirst lays down mere private judgements, and the second judgements\nsupposed to be generally valid (public), but in both cases aesthetical\n(not practical) judgements about an object merely in respect of the\nrelation of its representation to the feeling of pleasure and pain.\nNow here is something strange. As regards the taste of Sense not only\ndoes experience show that its judgement (of pleasure or pain connected\nwith anything) is not valid universally, but every one is content not\nto impute agreement with it to others (although actually there is\noften found a very extended concurrence in these judgements). On the\nother hand, the taste of Reflection has its claim to the universal\nvalidity of its judgements (about the beautiful) rejected often\nenough, as experience teaches; although it may find it possible (as it\nactually does) to represent judgements which can demand this universal\nagreement. In fact for each of its judgements of taste it imputes\nthis to every one, without the persons that judge disputing as to the\npossibility of such a claim; although in particular cases they cannot\nagree as to the correct application of this faculty.\nHere we must, in the first place, remark that a universality which\ndoes not rest on concepts of Objects (not even on empirical ones) is\nnot logical but aesthetical, _i.e._ it involves no objective quantity\nof the judgement but only that which is subjective. For this I use\nthe expression _general validity_ which signifies the validity of the\nreference of a representation, not to the cognitive faculty but, to the\nfeeling of pleasure and pain for every subject. (We can avail ourselves\nalso of the same expression for the logical quantity of the judgement,\nif only we prefix _objective_ to \u201cuniversal validity,\u201d to distinguish\nit from that which is merely subjective and aesthetical.)\nA judgement with _objective universal validity_ is also always valid\nsubjectively; _i.e._ if the judgement holds for everything contained\nunder a given concept, it holds also for every one who represents an\nobject by means of this concept. But from a _subjective universal\nvalidity_, _i.e._ aesthetical and resting on no concept, we cannot\ninfer that which is logical; because that kind of judgement does not\nextend to the Object. Hence the aesthetical universality which is\nascribed to a judgement must be of a particular kind, because it does\nnot unite the predicate of beauty with the concept of the _Object_,\nconsidered in its whole logical sphere, and yet extends it to the whole\nsphere of judging persons.\nIn respect of logical quantity all judgements of taste are _singular_\njudgements. For because I must refer the object immediately to my\nfeeling of pleasure and pain, and that not by means of concepts, they\ncannot have the quantity of objective generally valid judgements.\nNevertheless if the singular representation of the Object of the\njudgement of taste in accordance with the conditions determining the\nlatter, were transformed by comparison into a concept, a logically\nuniversal judgement could result therefrom. _E.g._ I describe by\na judgement of taste the rose, that I see, as beautiful. But the\njudgement which results from the comparison of several singular\njudgements, \u201cRoses in general are beautiful\u201d is no longer described\nsimply as aesthetical, but as a logical judgement based on an\naesthetical one. Again the judgement \u201cThe rose is pleasant\u201d (to smell)\nis, although aesthetical and singular, not a judgement of Taste but\nof Sense. It is distinguished from the former by the fact that the\njudgement of Taste carries with it an _aesthetical quantity_ of\nuniversality, _i.e._ of validity for every one; which cannot be found\nin a judgement about the Pleasant. It is only judgements about the Good\nwhich--although they also determine satisfaction in an object,--have\nlogical and not merely aesthetical universality; for they are valid of\nthe Object, as cognitive of it, and thus are valid for every one.\nIf we judge Objects merely according to concepts, then all\nrepresentation of beauty is lost. Thus there can be no rule according\nto which any one is to be forced to recognise anything as beautiful.\nWe cannot press [upon others] by the aid of any reasons or fundamental\npropositions our judgement that a coat, a house, or a flower is\nbeautiful. We wish to submit the Object to our own eyes, as if the\nsatisfaction in it depended on sensation; and yet if we then call the\nobject beautiful, we believe that we speak with a universal voice, and\nwe claim the assent of every one, although on the contrary all private\nsensation can only decide for the observer himself and his satisfaction.\nWe may see now that in the judgement of taste nothing is postulated but\nsuch a _universal voice_, in respect of the satisfaction without the\nintervention of concepts; and thus the _possibility_ of an aesthetical\njudgement that can, at the same time, be regarded as valid for every\none. The judgement of taste itself does not _postulate_ the agreement\nof every one (for that can only be done by a logically universal\njudgement because it can adduce reasons); it only _imputes_ this\nagreement to every one, as a case of the rule in respect of which it\nexpects, not confirmation by concepts, but assent from others. The\nuniversal voice is, therefore, only an Idea (we do not yet inquire\nupon what it rests). It may be uncertain whether or not the man, who\nbelieves that he is laying down a judgement of taste, is, as a matter\nof fact, judging in conformity with that Idea; but that he refers his\njudgement thereto, and, consequently, that it is intended to be a\njudgement of taste, he announces by the expression \u201cbeauty.\u201d He can\nbe quite certain of this for himself by the mere consciousness of the\nseparation of everything belonging to the Pleasant and the Good from\nthe satisfaction which is left; and this is all for which he promises\nhimself the agreement of every one--a claim which would be justifiable\nunder these conditions, provided only he did not often make mistakes,\nand thus lay down an erroneous judgement of taste.\n\u00a7 9. _Investigation of the question whether in the judgement of taste\nthe feeling of pleasure precedes or follows the judging of the object_\nThe solution of this question is the key to the Critique of Taste, and\nso is worthy of all attention.\nIf the pleasure in the given object precedes, and it is only its\nuniversal communicability that is to be acknowledged in the judgement\nof taste about the representation of the object, there would be a\ncontradiction. For such pleasure would be nothing different from the\nmere pleasantness in the sensation, and so in accordance with its\nnature could have only private validity, because it is immediately\ndependent on the representation through which the object _is given_.\nHence, it is the universal capability of communication of the mental\nstate in the given representation which, as the subjective condition of\nthe judgement of taste, must be fundamental, and must have the pleasure\nin the object as its consequent. But nothing can be universally\ncommunicated except cognition and representation, so far as it belongs\nto cognition. For it is only thus that this latter can be objective;\nand only through this has it a universal point of reference, with\nwhich the representative power of every one is compelled to harmonise.\nIf the determining ground of our judgement as to this universal\ncommunicability of the representation is to be merely subjective,\n_i.e._ is conceived independently of any concept of the object, it can\nbe nothing else than the state of mind, which is to be met with in the\nrelation of our representative powers to each other, so far as they\nrefer a given representation to _cognition in general_.\nThe cognitive powers, which are involved by this representation,\nare here in free play, because no definite concept limits them to a\nparticular[19] rule of cognition. Hence, the state of mind in this\nrepresentation must be a feeling of the free play of the representative\npowers in a given representation with reference to a cognition in\ngeneral. Now a representation by which an object is given, that is\nto become a cognition in general, requires _Imagination_, for the\ngathering together the manifold of intuition, and _Understanding_, for\nthe unity of the concept uniting the representations. This state of\n_free play_ of the cognitive faculties in a representation by which an\nobject is given, must be universally communicable; because cognition,\nas the determination of the Object with which given representations\n(in whatever subject) are to agree, is the only kind of representation\nwhich is valid for every one.\nThe subjective universal communicability of the mode of representation\nin a judgement of taste, since it is to be possible without\npresupposing a definite concept, can refer to nothing else than the\nstate of mind in the free play of the Imagination and the Understanding\n(so far as they agree with each other, as is requisite for _cognition\nin general_). We are conscious that this subjective relation, suitable\nfor cognition in general, must be valid for every one, and thus must\nbe universally communicable, just as if it were a definite cognition,\nresting always on that relation as its subjective condition.\nThis merely subjective (aesthetical) judging of the object, or of the\nrepresentation by which it is given, precedes the pleasure in it,\nand is the ground of this pleasure in the harmony of the cognitive\nfaculties; but on the universality of the subjective conditions for\njudging of objects is alone based the universal subjective validity of\nthe satisfaction bound up by us with the representation of the object\nthat we call beautiful.\nThe power of communicating one\u2019s state of mind, even though only in\nrespect of the cognitive faculties, carries a pleasure with it, as we\ncan easily show from the natural propension of man towards sociability\n(empirical and psychological). But this is not enough for our design.\nThe pleasure that we feel is, in a judgement of taste, necessarily\nimputed by us to every one else; as if, when we call a thing beautiful,\nit is to be regarded as a characteristic of the object which is\ndetermined in it according to concepts; though beauty, without a\nreference to the feeling of the subject, is nothing by itself. But we\nmust reserve the examination of this question until we have answered\nanother, viz. \u201cIf and how aesthetical judgements are possible _a\npriori_?\u201d\nWe now occupy ourselves with the easier question, in what way we are\nconscious of a mutual subjective harmony of the cognitive powers\nwith one another in the judgement of taste; is it aesthetically by\nmere internal sense and sensation? or is it intellectually by the\nconsciousness of our designed activity, by which we bring them into\nplay?\nIf the given representation, which occasions the judgement of taste,\nwere a concept uniting Understanding and Imagination in the judging\nof the object, into a cognition of the Object, the consciousness of\nthis relation would be intellectual (as in the objective schematism\nof the Judgement of which the Critique[20] treats). But then the\njudgement would not be laid down in reference to pleasure and pain, and\nconsequently would not be a judgement of taste. But the judgement of\ntaste, independently of concepts, determines the Object in respect of\nsatisfaction and of the predicate of beauty. Therefore that subjective\nunity of relation can only make itself known by means of sensation.\nThe excitement of both faculties (Imagination and Understanding) to\nindeterminate, but yet, through the stimulus of the given sensation,\nharmonious activity, viz. that which belongs to cognition in general,\nis the sensation whose universal communicability is postulated by the\njudgement of taste. An objective relation can only be thought, but\nyet, so far as it is subjective according to its conditions, can be\nfelt in its effect on the mind; and, of a relation based on no concept\n(like the relation of the representative powers to a cognitive faculty\nin general), no other consciousness is possible than that through the\nsensation of the effect, which consists in the more lively play of both\nmental powers (the Imagination and the Understanding) when animated by\nmutual agreement. A representation which, as singular and apart from\ncomparison with others, yet has an agreement with the conditions of\nuniversality which it is the business of the Understanding to supply,\nbrings the cognitive faculties into that proportionate accord which\nwe require for all cognition, and so regard as holding for every one\nwho is determined to judge by means of Understanding and Sense in\ncombination (_i.e._ for every man).\nEXPLANATION OF THE BEAUTIFUL RESULTING FROM THE SECOND MOMENT\nThe _beautiful_ is that which pleases universally, without a concept.\nTHIRD MOMENT\nOF JUDGEMENTS OF TASTE, ACCORDING TO THE RELATION OF THE PURPOSES WHICH\nARE BROUGHT INTO CONSIDERATION THEREIN.\n\u00a7 10. _Of purposiveness in general_\nIf we wish to explain what a purpose is according to its transcendental\ndeterminations (without presupposing anything empirical like the\nfeeling of pleasure) [we say that] the purpose is the object of a\nconcept, in so far as the concept is regarded as the cause of the\nobject (the real ground of its possibility); and the causality of a\n_concept_ in respect of its _Object_ is its purposiveness (_forma\nfinalis_). Where then not merely the cognition of an object, but the\nobject itself (its form and existence) is thought as an effect only\npossible by means of the concept of this latter, there we think a\npurpose. The representation of the effect is here the determining\nground of its cause and precedes it. The consciousness of the causality\nof a representation, for _maintaining_ the subject in the same state,\nmay here generally denote what we call pleasure; while on the other\nhand pain is that representation which contains the ground of the\ndetermination of the state of representations into their opposite [of\nrestraining or removing them[21]].\nThe faculty of desire, so far as it is determinable only through\nconcepts, _i.e._ to act in conformity with the representation of a\npurpose, would be the Will. But an Object, or a state of mind, or even\nan action, is called purposive, although its possibility does not\nnecessarily presuppose the representation of a purpose, merely because\nits possibility can be explained and conceived by us only so far as we\nassume for its ground a causality according to purposes, _i.e._ a will\nwhich would have so disposed it according to the representation of a\ncertain rule. There can be, then, purposiveness without[22] purpose,\nso far as we do not place the causes of this form in a will, but yet\ncan only make the explanation of its possibility intelligible to\nourselves by deriving it from a will. Again, we are not always forced\nto regard what we observe (in respect of its possibility) from the\npoint of view of Reason. Thus we can at least observe a purposiveness\naccording to form, without basing it on a purpose (as the material of\nthe _nexus finalis_), and we can notice it in objects, although only\nby reflection.\n\u00a7 11. _The judgement of taste has nothing at its basis but the_ form of\nthe purposiveness _of an object (or of its mode of representation)_\nEvery purpose, if it be regarded as a ground of satisfaction, always\ncarries with it an interest--as the determining ground of the\njudgement--about the object of pleasure. Therefore no subjective\npurpose can lie at the basis of the judgement of taste. But neither\ncan the judgement of taste be determined by any representation of an\nobjective purpose, _i.e._ of the possibility of the object itself in\naccordance with principles of purposive combination, and consequently\nit can be determined by no concept of the good; because it is an\naesthetical and not a cognitive judgement. It therefore has to do with\nno _concept_ of the character and internal or external possibility of\nthe object by means of this or that cause, but merely with the relation\nof the representative powers to one another, so far as they are\ndetermined by a representation.\nNow this relation in the determination of an object as beautiful\nis bound up with the feeling of pleasure, which is declared by the\njudgement of taste to be valid for every one; hence a pleasantness,\naccompanying the representation, can as little contain the determining\nground [of the judgement] as the representation of the perfection of\nthe object and the concept of the good can. Therefore it can be nothing\nelse than the subjective purposiveness in the representation of an\nobject without any purpose (either objective or subjective); and thus\nit is the mere form of purposiveness in the representation by which\nan object is _given_ to us, so far as we are conscious of it, which\nconstitutes the satisfaction that we without a concept judge to be\nuniversally communicable; and, consequently, this is the determining\nground of the judgement of taste.\n\u00a7 12. _The judgement of taste rests on_ a priori _grounds_\nTo establish _a priori_ the connexion of the feeling of a pleasure\nor pain as an effect, with any representation whatever (sensation or\nconcept) as its cause, is absolutely impossible; for that would be a\n[particular][23] causal relation which (with objects of experience)\ncan always only be cognised _a posteriori_, and through the medium\nof experience itself. We actually have, indeed, in the Critique of\npractical Reason, derived from universal moral concepts _a priori_ the\nfeeling of respect (as a special and peculiar modification of feeling\nwhich will not strictly correspond either to the pleasure or the pain\nthat we get from empirical objects). But there we could go beyond\nthe bounds of experience and call in a causality which rested on a\nsupersensible attribute of the subject, viz. freedom. And even there,\nproperly speaking, it was not this _feeling_ which we derived from the\nIdea of the moral as cause, but merely the determination of the will.\nBut the state of mind which accompanies any determination of the will\nis in itself a feeling of pleasure and identical with it, and therefore\ndoes not follow from it as its effect. This last must only be assumed\nif the concept of the moral as a good precede the determination of the\nwill by the law; for in that case the pleasure that is bound up with\nthe concept could not be derived from it as from a mere cognition.\nNow the case is similar with the pleasure in aesthetical judgements,\nonly that here it is merely contemplative and does not bring about\nan interest in the Object, which on the other hand in the moral\njudgement it is practical.[24] The consciousness of the mere formal\npurposiveness in the play of the subject\u2019s cognitive powers, in a\nrepresentation through which an object is given, is the pleasure\nitself; because it contains a determining ground of the activity of\nthe subject in respect of the excitement of its cognitive powers,\nand therefore an inner causality (which is purposive) in respect of\ncognition in general without however being limited to any definite\ncognition; and consequently contains a mere form of the subjective\npurposiveness of a representation in an aesthetical judgement. This\npleasure is in no way practical, neither like that arising from the\npathological ground of pleasantness, nor that from the intellectual\nground of the represented good. But yet it involves causality, viz. of\n_maintaining_ the state of the representation itself, and the exercise\nof the cognitive powers without further design. We _linger_ over the\ncontemplation of the beautiful, because this contemplation strengthens\nand reproduces itself, which is analogous to (though not of the same\nkind as) that lingering which takes place when a [physical] charm in\nthe representation of the object repeatedly arouses the attention, the\nmind being passive.\n\u00a7 13. _The pure judgement of taste is independent of charm and emotion_\nEvery interest spoils the judgement of taste and takes from its\nimpartiality, especially if the purposiveness is not, as with the\ninterest of Reason, placed before the feeling of pleasure but grounded\non it. This last always happens in an aesthetical judgement upon\nanything so far as it gratifies or grieves us. Hence judgements so\naffected can lay no claim at all to a universally valid satisfaction,\nor at least so much the less claim, in proportion as there are\nsensations of this sort among the determining grounds of taste.\nThat taste is still barbaric which needs a mixture of _charms_ and\n_emotions_ in order that there may be satisfaction, and still more so\nif it make these the measure of its assent.\nNevertheless charms are often not only taken account of in the case\nof beauty (which properly speaking ought merely to be concerned with\nform) as contributory to the aesthetical universal satisfaction; but\nthey are passed off as in themselves beauties, and thus the matter of\nsatisfaction is substituted for the form. This misconception, however,\nlike so many others which have something true at their basis, may be\nremoved by a careful definition of these concepts.\nA judgement of taste on which charm and emotion have no influence\n(although they may be bound up with the satisfaction in the\nbeautiful),--which therefore has as its determining ground merely the\npurposiveness of the form,--is a _pure judgement of taste_.\n\u00a7 14. _Elucidation by means of examples_\nAesthetical judgements can be divided just like theoretical (logical)\njudgements into empirical and pure. The first assert pleasantness or\nunpleasantness; the second assert the beauty of an object or of the\nmanner of representing it. The former are judgements of Sense (material\naesthetical judgements); the latter [as formal[25]] are alone strictly\njudgements of Taste.\nA judgement of taste is therefore pure, only so far as no merely\nempirical satisfaction is mingled with its determining ground. But this\nalways happens if charm or emotion have any share in the judgement by\nwhich anything is to be described as beautiful.\nNow here many objections present themselves, which fallaciously put\nforward charm not merely as a necessary ingredient of beauty, but\nas alone sufficient [to justify] a thing\u2019s being called beautiful.\nA mere colour, _e.g._ the green of a grass plot, a mere tone (as\ndistinguished from sound and noise) like that of a violin, are by most\npeople described as beautiful in themselves; although both seem to\nhave at their basis merely the matter of representations, viz. simply\nsensation, and therefore only deserve to be called pleasant. But we\nmust at the same time remark that the sensations of colours and of tone\nhave a right to be regarded as beautiful only in so far as they are\n_pure_. This is a determination which concerns their form, and is the\nonly [element] of these representations which admits with certainty of\nuniversal communicability; for we cannot assume that the quality of\nsensations is the same in all subjects, and we can hardly say that the\npleasantness of one colour or the tone of one musical instrument is\njudged preferable to that of another in the same[26] way by every one.\nIf we assume with _Euler_ that colours are isochronous vibrations\n(_pulsus_) of the aether, as sounds are of the air in a state of\ndisturbance, and,--what is most important,--that the mind not only\nperceives by sense the effect of these in exciting the organ, but also\nperceives by reflection the regular play of impressions (and thus the\nform of the combination of different representations) which I still\ndo not doubt[27]--then colours and tone cannot be reckoned as mere\nsensations, but as the formal determination of the unity of a manifold\nof sensations, and thus as beauties in themselves.\nBut \u201cpure\u201d in a simple mode of sensation means that its uniformity is\ntroubled and interrupted by no foreign sensation, and it belongs merely\nto the form; because here we can abstract from the quality of that\nmode of sensation (abstract from the colours and tone, if any, which\nit represents). Hence all simple colours, so far as they are pure,\nare regarded as beautiful; composite colours have not this advantage,\nbecause, as they are not simple, we have no standard for judging\nwhether they should be called pure or not.\nBut as regards the beauty attributed to the object on account of its\nform, to suppose it to be capable of augmentation through the charm\nof the object is a common error, and one very prejudicial to genuine,\nuncorrupted, well-founded taste. We can doubtless add these charms to\nbeauty, in order to interest the mind by the representation of the\nobject, apart from the bare satisfaction [received]; and thus they may\nserve as a recommendation of taste and its cultivation, especially when\nit is yet crude and unexercised. But they actually do injury to the\njudgement of taste if they draw attention to themselves as the grounds\nfor judging of beauty. So far are they from adding to beauty that they\nmust only be admitted by indulgence as aliens; and provided always that\nthey do not disturb the beautiful form, in cases when taste is yet weak\nand untrained.\nIn painting, sculpture, and in all the formative arts--in architecture,\nand horticulture, so far as they are beautiful arts--the _delineation_\nis the essential thing; and here it is not what gratifies in sensation\nbut what pleases by means of its form that is fundamental for taste.\nThe colours which light up the sketch belong to the charm; they may\nindeed enliven[28] the object for sensation, but they cannot make it\nworthy of contemplation and beautiful. In most cases they are rather\nlimited by the requirements of the beautiful form; and even where charm\nis permissible it is ennobled solely by this.\nEvery form of the objects of sense (both of external sense and also\nmediately of internal) is either _figure_ or _play_. In the latter case\nit is either play of figures (in space, viz. pantomime and dancing), or\nthe mere play of sensations (in time). The _charm_ of colours or of the\npleasant tones of an instrument may be added; but the _delineation_\nin the first case and the composition in the second constitute the\nproper object of the pure judgement of taste. To say that the purity\nof colours and of tones, or their variety and contrast, seems to add\nto beauty, does not mean that they supply a homogeneous addition to\nour satisfaction in the form because they are pleasant in themselves;\nbut they do so, because they make the form more exactly, definitely,\nand completely, intuitible, and besides by their charm [excite the\nrepresentation, whilst they[29]] awaken and fix our attention on the\nobject itself.\nEven what we call _ornaments_ [parerga[29]], _i.e._ those things which\ndo not belong to the complete representation of the object internally\nas elements but only externally as complements, and which augment the\nsatisfaction of taste, do so only by their form; as for example [the\nframes of pictures,[29] or] the draperies of statues or the colonnades\nof palaces. But if the ornament does not itself consist in beautiful\nform, and if it is used as a golden frame is used, merely to recommend\nthe painting by its _charm_, it is then called _finery_ and injures\ngenuine beauty.\n_Emotion_, _i.e._ a sensation in which pleasantness is produced by\nmeans of a momentary checking and a consequent more powerful outflow of\nthe vital force, does not belong at all to beauty. But sublimity [with\nwhich the feeling of emotion is bound up[29]] requires a different\nstandard of judgement from that which is at the foundation of taste;\nand thus a pure judgement of taste has for its determining ground\nneither charm nor emotion, in a word, no sensation as the material of\nthe aesthetical judgement.\n\u00a7 15. _The judgement of taste is quite independent of the concept of\nperfection_\n_Objective_ purposiveness can only be cognised by means of the\nreference of the manifold to a definite purpose, and therefore only\nthrough a concept. From this alone it is plain that the Beautiful, the\njudging of which has at its basis a merely formal purposiveness, _i.e._\na purposiveness without purpose, is quite independent of the concept of\nthe Good; because the latter presupposes an objective purposiveness,\n_i.e._ the reference of the object to a definite purpose.\nObjective purposiveness is either external, _i.e._ the _utility_, or\ninternal, _i.e._ the _perfection_ of the object. That the satisfaction\nin an object, on account of which we call it beautiful, cannot rest on\nthe representation of its utility, is sufficiently obvious from the two\npreceding sections; because in that case it would not be an immediate\nsatisfaction in the object, which is the essential condition of a\njudgement about beauty. But objective internal purposiveness, _i.e._\nperfection, comes nearer to the predicate of beauty; and it has been\nregarded by celebrated philosophers[30] as the same as beauty, with the\nproviso, _if it is thought in a confused way_. It is of the greatest\nimportance in a Critique of Taste to decide whether beauty can thus\nactually be resolved into the concept of perfection.\nTo judge of objective purposiveness we always need not only the\nconcept of a purpose, but (if that purposiveness is not to be external\nutility but internal) the concept of an internal purpose which shall\ncontain the ground of the internal possibility of the object. Now\nas a purpose in general is that whose _concept_ can be regarded as\nthe ground of the possibility of the object itself; so, in order to\nrepresent objective purposiveness in a thing, the concept of _what sort\nof thing it is to be_ must come first. The agreement of the manifold\nin it with this concept (which furnishes the rule for combining the\nmanifold) is the _qualitative perfection_ of the thing. Quite different\nfrom this is _quantitative_ perfection, the completeness of a thing\nafter its kind, which is a mere concept of magnitude (of totality).[31]\nIn this _what the thing ought to be_ is conceived as already\ndetermined, and it is only asked if it has _all_ its requisites. The\nformal [element] in the representation of a thing, _i.e._ the agreement\nof the manifold with a unity (it being undetermined what this ought\nto be), gives to cognition no objective purposiveness whatever. For\nsince abstraction is made of this unity as _purpose_ (what the thing\nought to be), nothing remains but the subjective purposiveness of\nthe representations in the mind of the intuiting subject. And this,\nalthough it furnishes a certain purposiveness of the representative\nstate of the subject, and so a facility of apprehending a given form\nby the Imagination, yet furnishes no perfection of an Object, since\nthe Object is not here conceived by means of the concept of a purpose.\nFor example, if in a forest I come across a plot of sward, round which\ntrees stand in a circle, and do not then represent to myself a purpose,\nviz. that it is intended to serve for country dances, not the least\nconcept of perfection is furnished by the mere form. But to represent\nto oneself a formal _objective_ purposiveness without purpose, _i.e._\nthe mere form of a _perfection_ (without any matter and without\nthe _concept_ of that with which it is accordant, even if it were\nmerely the Idea of conformity to law in general[32]) is a veritable\ncontradiction.\nNow the judgement of taste is an aesthetical judgement, _i.e._ such\nas rests on subjective grounds, the determining ground of which\ncannot be a concept, and consequently cannot be the concept of a\ndefinite purpose. Therefore in beauty, regarded as a formal subjective\npurposiveness, there is in no way thought a perfection of the object,\nas a would-be formal purposiveness, which yet is objective. And thus to\ndistinguish between the concepts of the Beautiful and the Good, as if\nthey were only different in logical form, the first being a confused,\nthe second a clear concept of perfection, but identical in content and\norigin, is quite fallacious. For then there would be no _specific_\ndifference between them, but a judgement of taste would be as much a\ncognitive judgement as the judgement by which a thing is described as\ngood; just as when the ordinary man says that fraud is unjust he bases\nhis judgement on confused grounds, whilst the philosopher bases it\non clear grounds, but both on identical principles of Reason. I have\nalready, however, said that an aesthetical judgement is unique of its\nkind, and gives absolutely no cognition (not even a confused cognition)\nof the Object; this is only supplied by a logical judgement. On the\ncontrary, it simply refers the representation, by which an Object is\ngiven, to the subject; and brings to our notice no characteristic\nof the object, but only the purposive form in the determination of\nthe representative powers which are occupying themselves therewith.\nThe judgement is called aesthetical just because its determining\nground is not a concept, but the feeling (of internal sense) of that\nharmony in the play of the mental powers, so far as it can be felt in\nsensation. On the other hand, if we wish to call confused concepts and\nthe objective judgement based on them, aesthetical, we shall have an\nUnderstanding judging sensibly or a Sense representing its Objects by\nmeans of concepts [both of which are contradictory.[33]] The faculty\nof concepts, be they confused or clear, is the Understanding; and\nalthough Understanding has to do with the judgement of taste, as an\naesthetical judgement (as it has with all judgements), yet it has to\ndo with it not as a faculty by which an object is cognised, but as the\nfaculty which determines the judgement and its representation (without\nany concept) in accordance with its relation to the subject and the\nsubject\u2019s internal feeling, in so far as this judgement may be possible\nin accordance with a universal rule.\n\u00a7 16. _The judgement of taste, by which an object is declared to be\nbeautiful under the condition of a definite concept, is not pure_\nThere are two kinds of beauty; free beauty (_pulchritudo vaga_)\nor merely dependent beauty (_pulchritudo adhaerens_). The first\npresupposes no concept of what the object ought to be; the second\ndoes presuppose such a concept and the perfection of the object in\naccordance therewith. The first is called the (self-subsistent)\nbeauty of this or that thing; the second, as dependent upon a concept\n(conditioned beauty), is ascribed to Objects which come under the\nconcept of a particular purpose.\nFlowers are free natural beauties. Hardly any one but a botanist\nknows what sort of a thing a flower ought to be; and even he, though\nrecognising in the flower the reproductive organ of the plant, pays no\nregard to this natural purpose if he is passing judgement on the flower\nby Taste. There is then at the basis of this judgement no perfection\nof any kind, no internal purposiveness, to which the collection of the\nmanifold is referred. Many birds (such as the parrot, the humming bird,\nthe bird of paradise), and many sea shells are beauties in themselves,\nwhich do not belong to any object determined in respect of its purpose\nby concepts, but please freely and in themselves. So also delineations\n_\u00e0 la grecque_, foliage for borders or wall-papers, mean nothing\nin themselves; they represent nothing--no Object under a definite\nconcept,--and are free beauties. We can refer to the same class what\nare called in music phantasies (_i.e._ pieces without any theme), and\nin fact all music without words.\nIn the judging of a free beauty (according to the mere form) the\njudgement of taste is pure. There is presupposed no concept of any\npurpose, for which the manifold should serve the given Object, and\nwhich therefore is to be represented therein. By such a concept the\nfreedom of the Imagination which disports itself in the contemplation\nof the figure would be only limited.\nBut human beauty (_i.e._ of a man, a woman, or a child), the beauty of\na horse, or a building (be it church, palace, arsenal, or summer-house)\npresupposes a concept of the purpose which determines what the thing is\nto be, and consequently a concept of its perfection; it is therefore\nadherent beauty. Now as the combination of the Pleasant (in sensation)\nwith Beauty, which properly is only concerned with form, is a hindrance\nto the purity of the judgement of taste; so also is its purity injured\nby the combination with Beauty of the Good (viz. that manifold which is\ngood for the thing itself in accordance with its purpose).\nWe could add much to a building which would immediately please the eye,\nif only it were not to be a church. We could adorn a figure with all\nkinds of spirals and light but regular lines, as the New Zealanders do\nwith their tattooing, if only it were not the figure of a human being.\nAnd again this could have much finer features and a more pleasing and\ngentle cast of countenance provided it were not intended to represent a\nman, much less a warrior.\nNow the satisfaction in the manifold of a thing in reference to the\ninternal purpose which determines its possibility is a satisfaction\ngrounded on a concept; but the satisfaction in beauty is such as\npresupposes no concept, but is immediately bound up with the\nrepresentation through which the object is given (not through which it\nis thought). If now the judgement of Taste in respect of the beauty\nof a thing is made dependent on the purpose in its manifold, like a\njudgement of Reason, and thus limited, it is no longer a free and pure\njudgement of Taste.\nIt is true that taste gains by this combination of aesthetical with\nintellectual satisfaction, inasmuch as it becomes fixed; and though\nit is not universal, yet in respect to certain purposively determined\nObjects it becomes possible to prescribe rules for it. These, however,\nare not rules of taste, but merely rules for the unification of Taste\nwith Reason, _i.e._ of the Beautiful with the Good, by which the former\nbecomes available as an instrument of design in respect of the latter.\nThus the tone of mind which is self-maintaining and of subjective\nuniversal validity is subordinated to the way of thinking which can\nbe maintained only by painful resolve, but is of objective universal\nvalidity. Properly speaking, however, perfection gains nothing by\nbeauty or beauty by perfection; but, when we compare the representation\nby which an object is given to us with the Object (as regards what it\nought to be) by means of a concept, we cannot avoid considering along\nwith it the sensation in the subject. And thus when both states of mind\nare in harmony our _whole faculty_ of representative power gains.\nA judgement of taste, then, in respect of an object with a definite\ninternal purpose, can only be pure, if either the person judging\nhas no concept of this purpose, or else abstracts from it in his\njudgement. Such a person, although forming an accurate judgement of\ntaste in judging of the object as free beauty, would yet by another\nwho considers the beauty in it only as a dependent attribute (who looks\nto the purpose of the object) be blamed, and accused of false taste;\nalthough both are right in their own way, the one in reference to what\nhe has before his eyes, the other in reference to what he has in his\nthought. By means of this distinction we can settle many disputes about\nbeauty between judges of taste; by showing that the one is speaking of\nfree, the other of dependent, beauty,--that the first is making a pure,\nthe second an applied, judgement of taste.\n\u00a7 17. _Of the Ideal of beauty_\nThere can be no objective rule of taste which shall determine by\nmeans of concepts what is beautiful. For every judgement from this\nsource is aesthetical; _i.e._ the feeling of the subject, and not\na concept of the Object, is its determining ground. To seek for a\nprinciple of taste which shall furnish, by means of definite concepts,\na universal criterion of the beautiful, is fruitless trouble; because\nwhat is sought is impossible and self-contradictory. The universal\ncommunicability of sensation (satisfaction or dissatisfaction) without\nthe aid of a concept--the agreement, as far as is possible, of all\ntimes and peoples as regards this feeling in the representation of\ncertain objects--this is the empirical criterion, although weak and\nhardly sufficing for probability, of the derivation of a taste, thus\nconfirmed by examples, from the deep-lying grounds of agreement common\nto all men, in judging of the forms under which objects are given to\nthem.\nHence, we consider some products of taste as _exemplary_. Not that\ntaste can be acquired by imitating others; for it must be an original\nfaculty. He who imitates a model shows, no doubt, in so far as he\nattains to it, skill; but only shows taste in so far as he can judge\nof this model itself.[34] It follows from hence that the highest\nmodel, the archetype of taste, is a mere Idea, which every one must\nproduce in himself; and according to which he must judge every Object\nof taste, every example of judgement by taste, and even the taste\nof every one. _Idea_ properly means a rational concept, and _Ideal_\nthe representation of an individual being, regarded as adequate to\nan Idea.[35] Hence that archetype of taste, which certainly rests on\nthe indeterminate Idea that Reason has of a maximum, but which cannot\nbe represented by concepts, but only in an individual presentation,\nis better called the Ideal of the beautiful. Although we are not in\npossession of this, we yet strive to produce it in ourselves. But\nit can only be an Ideal of the Imagination, because it rests on a\npresentation and not on concepts, and the Imagination is the faculty of\npresentation.--How do we arrive at such an Ideal of beauty? _A priori_,\nor empirically? Moreover, what species of the beautiful is susceptible\nof an Ideal?\nFirst, it is well to remark that the beauty for which an Ideal is to\nbe sought cannot be _vague_ beauty, but is _fixed_ by a concept of\nobjective purposiveness; and thus it cannot appertain to the Object\nof a quite pure judgement of taste, but to that of a judgement of\ntaste which is in part intellectual. That is, in whatever grounds of\njudgement an Ideal is to be found, an Idea of Reason in accordance with\ndefinite concepts must lie at its basis; which determines _a priori_\nthe purpose on which the internal possibility of the object rests.\nAn Ideal of beautiful flowers, of a beautiful piece of furniture,\nof a beautiful view, is inconceivable. But neither can an Ideal be\nrepresented of a beauty dependent on definite purposes, _e.g._ of a\nbeautiful dwelling-house, a beautiful tree, a beautiful garden, etc.;\npresumably because their purpose is not sufficiently determined and\nfixed by the concept, and thus the purposiveness is nearly as free as\nin the case of _vague_ beauty. The only being which has the purpose of\nits existence in itself is _man_, who can determine his purposes by\nReason; or, where he must receive them from external perception, yet\ncan compare them with essential and universal purposes, and can judge\nthis their accordance aesthetically. This _man_ is, then, alone of all\nobjects in the world, susceptible of an Ideal of _beauty_; as it is\nonly _humanity_ in his person, as an intelligence, that is susceptible\nof the Ideal of _perfection_.\nBut there are here two elements. _First_, there is the aesthetical\n_normal Idea_, which is an individual intuition (of the Imagination),\nrepresenting the standard of our judgement [upon man] as a thing\nbelonging to a particular animal species. _Secondly_, there is the\n_rational Idea_ which makes the purposes of humanity, so far as they\ncannot be sensibly represented, the principle for judging of a figure\nthrough which, as their phenomenal effect, those purposes are revealed.\nThe normal Idea of the figure of an animal of a particular race must\ntake its elements from experience. But the greatest purposiveness\nin the construction of the figure, that would be available for the\nuniversal standard of aesthetical judgement upon each individual of\nthis species--the image which is as it were designedly at the basis of\nnature\u2019s Technic, to which only the whole race and not any isolated\nindividual is adequate--this lies merely in the Idea of the judging\n[subject]. And this, with its proportions, as an aesthetical Idea, can\nbe completely presented _in concreto_ in a model. In order to make\nintelligible in some measure (for who can extract her whole secret\nfrom nature?) how this comes to pass, we shall attempt a psychological\nexplanation.\nWe must remark that, in a way quite incomprehensible by us, the\nImagination can not only recall, on occasion, the signs for concepts\nlong past, but can also reproduce the image of the figure of the object\nout of an unspeakable number of objects of different kinds or even of\nthe same kind. Further, if the mind is concerned with comparisons, the\nImagination can, in all probability, actually though unconsciously let\none image glide into another, and thus by the concurrence of several of\nthe same kind come by an average, which serves as the common measure\nof all. Every one has seen a thousand full-grown men. Now if you wish\nto judge of their normal size, estimating it by means of comparison,\nthe Imagination (as I think) allows a great number of images (perhaps\nthe whole thousand) to fall on one another. If I am allowed to apply\nhere the analogy of optical presentation, it is in the space where\nmost of them are combined and inside the contour, where the place is\nilluminated with the most vivid colours, that the _average size_ is\ncognisable; which, both in height and breadth, is equally far removed\nfrom the extreme bounds of the greatest and smallest stature. And this\nis the stature of a beautiful man. (We could arrive at the same thing\nmechanically, by adding together all thousand magnitudes, heights,\nbreadths, and thicknesses, and dividing the sum by a thousand. But the\nImagination does this by means of a dynamical effect, which arises\nfrom the various impressions of such figures on the organ of internal\nsense.) If now in a similar way for this average man we seek the\naverage head, for this head the average nose, etc., such figure is at\nthe basis of the normal Idea in the country where the comparison is\ninstituted. Thus necessarily under these empirical conditions a negro\nmust have a different normal Idea of the beauty of the [human figure]\nfrom a white man, a Chinaman a different normal Idea from a European,\netc. And the same is the case with the model of a beautiful horse or\ndog (of a certain breed).--This _normal Idea_ is not derived from\nproportions got from experience [and regarded] _as definite rules_; but\nin accordance with it rules for judging become in the first instance\npossible. It is the image for the whole race, which floats among all\nthe variously different intuitions of individuals, which nature takes\nas archetype in her productions of the same species, but which seems\nnot to be fully reached in any individual case. It is by no means the\nwhole _archetype of beauty_ in the race, but only the form constituting\nthe indispensable condition of all beauty, and thus merely\n_correctness_ in the [mental] presentation of the race. It is, like the\ncelebrated _Doryphorus_ of _Polycletus_,[36] the _rule_ (_Myron\u2019s_[37]\nCow might also be used thus for its kind). It can therefore contain\nnothing specifically characteristic, for otherwise it would not be\nthe _normal Idea_ for the race. Its presentation pleases, not by its\nbeauty, but merely because it contradicts no condition, under which\nalone a thing of this kind can be beautiful. The presentation is merely\ncorrect.[38]\nWe must yet distinguish the _normal Idea_ of the beautiful from the\n_Ideal_, which latter, on grounds already alleged, we can only expect\nin the _human_ figure. In this the Ideal consists in the expression\nof the _moral_, without which the object would not please universally\nand thus positively (not merely negatively in a correct presentation).\nThe visible expression of moral Ideas that rule men inwardly, can\nindeed only be got from experience; but to make its connexion with\nall which our Reason unites with the morally good in the Idea of the\nhighest purposiveness,--goodness of heart, purity, strength, peace,\netc.,--visible as it were in bodily manifestation (as the effect of\nthat which is internal), requires a union of pure Ideas of Reason with\ngreat imaginative power, even in him who wishes to judge of it, still\nmore in him who wishes to present it. The correctness of such an Ideal\nof beauty is shown by its permitting no sensible charm to mingle with\nthe satisfaction in the Object and yet allowing us to take a great\ninterest therein. This shows that a judgement in accordance with such\na standard can never be purely aesthetical, and that a judgement in\naccordance with an Ideal of beauty is not a mere judgement of taste.\nEXPLANATION OF THE BEAUTIFUL DERIVED FROM THIS THIRD MOMENT\n_Beauty_ is the form of the _purposiveness_ of an object, so far as\nthis is perceived in it _without any representation of a purpose_.[39]\nFOURTH MOMENT\nOF THE JUDGEMENT OF TASTE, ACCORDING TO THE MODALITY OF THE\nSATISFACTION IN THE OBJECT\n\u00a7 18. _What the modality in a judgement of taste is_\nI can say of every representation that it is at least _possible_\nthat (as a cognition) it should be bound up with a pleasure. Of a\nrepresentation that I call _pleasant_ I say that it _actually_ excites\npleasure in me. But the _beautiful_ we think as having a _necessary_\nreference to satisfaction. Now this necessity is of a peculiar kind.\nIt is not a theoretical objective necessity; in which case it would be\ncognised _a priori_ that every one _will feel_ this satisfaction in\nthe object called beautiful by me. It is not a practical necessity;\nin which case, by concepts of a pure rational will serving as a rule\nfor freely acting beings, the satisfaction is the necessary result of\nan objective law and only indicates that we absolutely (without any\nfurther design) ought to act in a certain way. But the necessity which\nis thought in an aesthetical judgement can only be called _exemplary_;\n_i.e._ a necessity of the assent of _all_ to a judgement which is\nregarded as the example of a universal rule that we cannot state. Since\nan aesthetical judgement is not an objective cognitive judgement, this\nnecessity cannot be derived from definite concepts, and is therefore\nnot apodictic. Still less can it be inferred from the universality of\nexperience (of a complete agreement of judgements as to the beauty\nof a certain object). For not only would experience hardly furnish\nsufficiently numerous vouchers for this; but also, on empirical\njudgements we can base no concept of the necessity of these judgements.\n\u00a7 19. _The subjective necessity, which we ascribe to the judgement of\ntaste, is conditioned_\nThe judgement of taste requires the agreement of every one; and he\nwho describes anything as beautiful claims that every one _ought_\nto give his approval to the object in question and also describe it\nas beautiful. The _ought_ in the aesthetical judgement is therefore\npronounced in accordance with all the data which are required for\njudging and yet is only conditioned. We ask for the agreement of every\none else, because we have for it a ground that is common to all; and we\ncould count on this agreement, provided we were always sure that the\ncase was correctly subsumed under that ground as rule of assent.\n\u00a7 20. _The condition of necessity which a judgement of taste asserts is\nthe Idea of a common sense_\nIf judgements of taste (like cognitive judgements) had a definite\nobjective principle, then the person who lays them down in accordance\nwith this latter would claim an unconditioned necessity for his\njudgement. If they were devoid of all principle, like those of the\nmere taste of sense, we would not allow them in thought any necessity\nwhatever. Hence they must have a subjective principle which determines\nwhat pleases or displeases only by feeling and not by concepts, but\nyet with universal validity. But such a principle could only be\nregarded as a _common sense_, which is essentially different from\ncommon Understanding which people sometimes call common Sense (_sensus\ncommunis_); for the latter does not judge by feeling but always\nby concepts, although ordinarily only as by obscurely represented\nprinciples.\nHence it is only under the presupposition that there is a common sense\n(by which we do not understand an external sense, but the effect\nresulting from the free play of our cognitive powers)--it is only under\nthis presupposition, I say, that the judgement of taste can be laid\ndown.\n\u00a7 21. _Have we ground for presupposing a common sense?_\nCognitions and judgements must, along with the conviction that\naccompanies them, admit of universal communicability; for otherwise\nthere would be no harmony between them and the Object, and they would\nbe collectively a mere subjective play of the representative powers,\nexactly as scepticism would have it. But if cognitions are to admit of\ncommunicability, so must also the state of mind,--_i.e._ the accordance\nof the cognitive powers with a cognition generally, and that proportion\nof them which is suitable for a representation (by which an object is\ngiven to us) in order that a cognition may be made out of it--admit of\nuniversal communicability. For without this as the subjective condition\nof cognition, knowledge as an effect could not arise. This actually\nalways takes place when a given object by means of Sense excites the\nImagination to collect the manifold, and the Imagination in its turn\nexcites the Understanding to bring about a unity of this collective\nprocess in concepts. But this accordance of the cognitive powers has\na different proportion according to the variety of the Objects which\nare given. However, it must be such that this internal relation, by\nwhich one mental faculty is excited by another, shall be generally the\nmost beneficial for both faculties in respect of cognition (of given\nobjects); and this accordance can only be determined by feeling (not\naccording to concepts). Since now this accordance itself must admit\nof universal communicability, and consequently also our feeling of it\n(in a given representation), and since the universal communicability\nof a feeling presupposes a common sense, we have grounds for assuming\nthis latter. And this common sense is assumed without relying on\npsychological observations, but simply as the necessary condition of\nthe universal communicability of our knowledge, which is presupposed in\nevery Logic and in every principle of knowledge that is not sceptical.\n\u00a7 22. _The necessity of the universal agreement that is thought in a\njudgement of taste is a subjective necessity, which is represented as\nobjective under the presupposition of a common sense_\nIn all judgements by which we describe anything as beautiful, we\nallow no one to be of another opinion; without however grounding our\njudgement on concepts but only on our feeling, which we therefore\nplace at its basis not as a private, but as a communal feeling.[40]\nNow this common sense cannot be grounded on experience; for it aims at\njustifying judgements which contain an _ought_. It does not say that\nevery one _will_ agree with my judgement, but that he _ought_. And so\ncommon sense, as an example of whose judgement I here put forward my\njudgement of taste and on account of which I attribute to the latter an\n_exemplary_ validity, is a mere ideal norm, under the supposition of\nwhich I have a right to make into a rule for every one a judgement that\naccords therewith, as well as the satisfaction in an Object expressed\nin such judgement. For the principle, which concerns the agreement of\ndifferent judging persons, although only subjective, is yet assumed as\nsubjectively universal (an Idea necessary for every one); and thus can\nclaim universal assent (as if it were objective) provided we are sure\nthat we have correctly subsumed [the particulars] under it.\nThis indeterminate norm of a common sense is actually presupposed by\nus; as is shown by our claim to lay down judgements of taste. Whether\nthere is in fact such a common sense, as a constitutive principle of\nthe possibility of experience, or whether a yet higher principle of\nReason makes it only into a regulative principle for producing in us\na common sense for higher purposes: whether therefore Taste is an\noriginal and natural faculty, or only the Idea of an artificial one yet\nto be acquired, so that a judgement of taste with its assumption of a\nuniversal assent in fact, is only a requirement of Reason for producing\nsuch harmony of sentiment; whether the \u201cought,\u201d _i.e._ the objective\nnecessity of the confluence of the feeling of any one man with that of\nevery other, only signifies the possibility of arriving at this accord,\nand the judgement of taste only affords an example of the application\nof this principle: these questions we have neither the wish nor the\npower to investigate as yet; we have now only to resolve the faculty of\ntaste into its elements in order to unite them at last in the Idea of\na common sense.\nEXPLANATION OF THE BEAUTIFUL RESULTING FROM THE FOURTH MOMENT\nThe _beautiful_ is that which without any concept is cognised as the\nobject of a _necessary_ satisfaction.\nGENERAL REMARK ON THE FIRST SECTION OF THE ANALYTIC\nIf we seek the result of the preceding analysis we find that everything\nruns up into this concept of Taste, that it is a faculty for judging\nan object in reference to the Imagination\u2019s _free conformity to law_.\nNow if in the judgement of taste the Imagination must be considered in\nits freedom, it is in the first place not regarded as reproductive,\nas it is subject to the laws of association, but as productive and\nspontaneous (as the author of arbitrary forms of possible intuition).\nAnd although in the apprehension of a given object of sense it is\ntied to a definite form of this Object, and so far has no free play\n(such as that of poetry) yet it may readily be conceived that the\nobject can furnish it with such a form containing a collection of\nthe manifold, as the Imagination itself, if it were left free, would\nproject in accordance with the _conformity to law of the Understanding_\nin general. But that the _imaginative power_ should be _free_ and yet\n_of itself conformed to law_, _i.e._ bringing autonomy with it, is a\ncontradiction. The Understanding alone gives the law. If, however,\nthe Imagination is compelled to proceed according to a definite law,\nits product in respect of form is determined by concepts as to what\nit ought to be. But then, as is above shown, the satisfaction is not\nthat in the Beautiful, but in the Good (in perfection, at any rate\nin mere formal perfection); and the judgement is not a judgement of\ntaste. Hence it is a conformity to law without a law; and a subjective\nagreement of the Imagination and Understanding,--without such an\nobjective agreement as there is when the representation is referred\nto a definite concept of an object,--can subsist along with the\nfree conformity to law of the Understanding (which is also called\npurposiveness without purpose) and with the peculiar feature of a\njudgement of taste.\nNow geometrically regular figures, such as a circle, a square, a\ncube, etc., are commonly adduced by critics of taste as the simplest\nand most indisputable examples of beauty; and yet they are called\nregular, because we can only represent them by regarding them as mere\npresentations of a definite concept which prescribes the rule for the\nfigure (according to which alone it is possible). One of these two must\nbe wrong, either that judgement of the critic which ascribes beauty to\nthe said figures, or ours, which regards purposiveness apart from a\nconcept as requisite for beauty.\nHardly any one will say that a man must have taste in order that he\nshould find more satisfaction in a circle than in a scrawled outline,\nin an equilateral and equiangular quadrilateral than in one which is\noblique, irregular, and as it were deformed, for this belongs to the\nordinary Understanding and is not Taste at all. Where, _e.g._ our\ndesign is to judge of the size of an area, or to make intelligible\nthe relation of the parts of it, when divided, to one another and\nto the whole, then regular figures and those of the simplest kind\nare needed, and the satisfaction does not rest immediately on\nthe aspect of the figure, but on its availability for all kinds\nof possible designs. A room whose walls form oblique angles, or a\nparterre of this kind, even every violation of symmetry in the figure\nof animals (_e.g._ being one-eyed), of buildings, or of flower beds,\ndispleases, because it contradicts the purpose of the thing, not only\npractically in respect of a definite use of it, but also when we pass\njudgement on it as regards any possible design. This is not the case\nin the judgement of taste, which when pure combines satisfaction\nor dissatisfaction,--without any reference to its use or to a\npurpose,--with the mere _consideration_ of the object.\nThe regularity which leads to the concept of an object is indeed the\nindispensable condition (_conditio sine qua non_) for grasping the\nobject in a single representation and determining the manifold in its\nform. This determination is a purpose in respect of cognition, and\nin reference to this it is always bound up with satisfaction (which\naccompanies the execution of every, even problematical, design). There\nis here, however, merely the approval of the solution satisfying a\nproblem, and not a free and indefinite purposive entertainment of the\nmental powers with what we call beautiful, where the Understanding is\nat the service of Imagination and not _vice versa_.\nIn a thing that is only possible by means of design,--a building, or\neven an animal,--the regularity consisting in symmetry must express\nthe unity of the intuition that accompanies the concept of purpose,\nand this regularity belongs to cognition. But where only a free play\nof the representative powers (under the condition, however, that the\nUnderstanding is to suffer no shock thereby) is to be kept up, in\npleasure gardens, room decorations, all kinds of tasteful furniture,\netc., regularity that shows constraint is avoided as much as possible.\nThus in the English taste in gardens, or in bizarre taste in furniture,\nthe freedom of the Imagination is pushed almost near to the grotesque,\nand in this separation from every constraint of rule we have the case,\nwhere taste can display its greatest perfection in the enterprises of\nthe Imagination.\nAll stiff regularity (such as approximates to mathematical regularity)\nhas something in it repugnant to taste; for our entertainment in\nthe contemplation of it lasts for no length of time, but it rather,\nin so far as it has not expressly in view cognition or a definite\npractical purpose, produces weariness. On the other hand that with\nwhich Imagination can play in an unstudied and purposive manner\nis always new to us, and one does not get tired of looking at it.\n_Marsden_ in his description of Sumatra makes the remark that the\nfree beauties of nature surround the spectator everywhere and thus\nlose their attraction for him.[41] On the other hand a pepper-garden,\nwhere the stakes on which this plant twines itself form parallel rows,\nhad much attractiveness for him, if he met with it in the middle of a\nforest. And hence he infers that wild beauty, apparently irregular,\nonly pleases as a variation from the regular beauty of which one has\nseen enough. But he need only have made the experiment of spending\none day in a pepper-garden, to have been convinced that, once the\nUnderstanding, by the aid of this regularity, has put itself in accord\nwith the order that it always needs, the object will not entertain for\nlong,--nay rather it will impose a burdensome constraint upon the\nImagination. On the other hand, nature, which there is prodigal in\nits variety even to luxuriance, that is subjected to no constraint of\nartificial rules, can supply constant food for taste.--Even the song\nof birds, which we can bring under no musical rule, seems to have more\nfreedom, and therefore more for taste, than a song of a human being\nwhich is produced in accordance with all the rules of music; for we\nvery much sooner weary of the latter, if it is repeated often and at\nlength. Here, however, we probably confuse our participation in the\nmirth of a little creature that we love, with the beauty of its song;\nfor if this were exactly imitated by man (as sometimes the notes of the\nnightingale are)[42] it would seem to our ear quite devoid of taste.\nAgain, beautiful objects are to be distinguished from beautiful\nviews of objects (which often on account of their distance cannot be\nclearly recognised). In the latter case taste appears not so much in\nwhat the Imagination _apprehends_ in this field, as in the impulse it\nthus gets to _fiction_, _i.e._ in the peculiar fancies with which the\nmind entertains itself, whilst it is continually being aroused by the\nvariety which strikes the eye. An illustration is afforded, _e.g._\nby the sight of the changing shapes of a fire on the hearth or of a\nrippling brook; neither of these has beauty, but they bring with them a\ncharm for the Imagination, because they entertain it in free play.\nSECOND BOOK\nANALYTIC OF THE SUBLIME\n\u00a7 23. _Transition from the faculty which judges of the Beautiful to\nthat which judges of the Sublime_\nThe Beautiful and the Sublime agree in this, that both please in\nthemselves. Further, neither presupposes a judgement of sense nor\na judgement logically determined, but a judgement of reflection.\nConsequently the satisfaction [belonging to them] does not depend\non a sensation, as in the case of the Pleasant, nor on a definite\nconcept, as in the case of the Good; but it is nevertheless referred\nto concepts although indeterminate ones. And so the satisfaction is\nconnected with the mere presentation [of the object] or with the\nfaculty of presentation; so that in the case of a given intuition this\nfaculty or the Imagination is considered as in agreement with the\n_faculty of concepts_ of Understanding or Reason (in its furtherance of\nthese latter). Hence both kinds of judgements are _singular_, and yet\nannounce themselves as universally valid for every subject; although\nthey lay claim merely to the feeling of pleasure and not to any\nknowledge of the object.\nBut there are also remarkable differences between the two. The\nBeautiful in nature is connected with the form of the object, which\nconsists in having boundaries. The Sublime, on the other hand, is to\nbe found in a formless object, so far as in it or by occasion of it\n_boundlessness_ is represented, and yet its totality is also present to\nthought. Thus the Beautiful seems to be regarded as the presentation\nof an indefinite concept of Understanding; the Sublime as that of a\nlike concept of Reason. Therefore the satisfaction in the one case is\nbound up with the representation of _quality_, in the other with that\nof _quantity_. And the latter satisfaction is quite different in kind\nfrom the former, for this [the Beautiful[43]] directly brings with\nit a feeling of the furtherance of life, and thus is compatible with\ncharms and with the play of the Imagination. But the other [the feeling\nof the Sublime[43]] is a pleasure that arises only indirectly; viz.\nit is produced by the feeling of a momentary checking of the vital\npowers and a consequent stronger outflow of them, so that it seems to\nbe regarded as emotion,--not play, but earnest in the exercise of the\nImagination.--Hence it is incompatible with charms; and as the mind\nis not merely attracted by the object but is ever being alternately\nrepelled, the satisfaction in the sublime does not so much involve a\npositive pleasure as admiration or respect, which rather deserves to be\ncalled negative pleasure.\nBut the inner and most important distinction between the Sublime\nand Beautiful is, certainly, as follows. (Here, as we are entitled\nto do, we only bring under consideration in the first instance the\nsublime in natural Objects; for the sublime of Art is always limited\nby the conditions of agreement with Nature.) Natural beauty (which is\nself-subsisting) brings with it a purposiveness in its form by which\nthe object seems to be, as it were, pre-adapted to our Judgement, and\nthus constitutes in itself an object of satisfaction. On the other\nhand, that which excites in us, without any reasoning about it, but in\nthe mere apprehension of it, the feeling of the sublime, may appear as\nregards its form to violate purpose in respect of the Judgement, to be\nunsuited to our presentative faculty, and, as it were, to do violence\nto the Imagination; and yet it is judged to be only the more sublime.\nNow from this we may see that in general we express ourselves\nincorrectly if we call any _object of nature_ sublime, although we can\nquite correctly call many objects of nature beautiful. For how can that\nbe marked by an expression of approval, which is apprehended in itself\nas being a violation of purpose? All that we can say is that the object\nis fit for the presentation of a sublimity which can be found in the\nmind; for no sensible form can contain the sublime properly so-called.\nThis concerns only Ideas of the Reason, which, although no adequate\npresentation is possible for them, by this inadequacy that admits of\nsensible presentation, are aroused and summoned into the mind. Thus the\nwide ocean, agitated by the storm, cannot be called sublime. Its aspect\nis horrible; and the mind must be already filled with manifold Ideas\nif it is to be determined by such an intuition to a feeling itself\nsublime, as it is incited to abandon sensibility and to busy itself\nwith Ideas that involve higher purposiveness.\nSelf-subsisting natural beauty discovers to us a Technic of nature,\nwhich represents it as a system in accordance with laws, the principle\nof which we do not find in the whole of our faculty of Understanding.\nThat principle is the principle of purposiveness, in respect of the use\nof our Judgement in regard to phenomena; [which requires] that these\nmust not be judged as merely belonging to nature in its purposeless\nmechanism, but also as belonging to something analogous to art. It,\ntherefore, actually extends, not indeed our cognition of natural\nObjects, but our concept of nature; [which is now not regarded] as\nmere mechanism but as art. This leads to profound investigations as to\nthe possibility of such a form. But in what we are accustomed to call\nsublime there is nothing at all that leads to particular objective\nprinciples and forms of nature corresponding to them; so far from it\nthat for the most part nature excites the Ideas of the sublime in its\nchaos or in its wildest and most irregular disorder and desolation,\nprovided size and might are perceived. Hence, we see that the concept\nof the Sublime is not nearly so important or rich in consequences\nas the concept of the Beautiful; and that in general it displays\nnothing purposive in nature itself, but only in that possible use of\nour intuitions of it by which there is produced in us a feeling of\na purposiveness quite independent of nature. We must seek a ground\nexternal to ourselves for the Beautiful of nature; but seek it for\nthe Sublime merely in ourselves and in our attitude of thought which\nintroduces sublimity into the representation of nature. This is a\nvery needful preliminary remark, which quite separates the Ideas of\nthe sublime from that of a purposiveness of _nature_, and makes the\ntheory of the sublime a mere appendix to the aesthetical judging of\nthat purposiveness; because by means of it no particular form is\nrepresented in nature, but there is only developed a purposive use\nwhich the Imagination makes of its representation.\n\u00a7 24. _Of the divisions of an investigation into the feeling of the\nsublime_\nAs regards the division of the moments of the aesthetical judging of\nobjects in reference to the feeling of the sublime, the Analytic can\nproceed according to the same principle as was adapted in the analysis\nof judgements of taste. For as an act of the aesthetical reflective\nJudgement, the satisfaction in the Sublime must be represented just as\nin the case of the Beautiful,--according to _quantity_ as universally\nvalid, according to _quality_ as devoid of _interest_, according to\n_relation_ as subjective purposiveness, and according to _modality_ as\nnecessary. And so the method here will not diverge from that of the\npreceding section; unless, indeed, we count it a difference that in\nthe case where the aesthetical Judgement is concerned with the form of\nthe Object we began with the investigation of its quality, but here,\nin view of the formlessness which may belong to what we call sublime,\nwe shall begin with quantity, as the first moment of the aesthetical\njudgement as to the sublime. The reason for this may be seen from the\npreceding paragraph.\nBut the analysis of the Sublime involves a division not needed in the\ncase of the Beautiful, viz. a division into the _mathematically_ and\nthe _dynamically sublime_.\nFor the feeling of the Sublime brings with it as its characteristic\nfeature a _movement_ of the mind bound up with the judging of the\nobject, while in the case of the Beautiful taste presupposes and\nmaintains the mind in _restful_ contemplation. Now this movement\nought to be judged as subjectively purposive (because the sublime\npleases us), and thus it is referred through the Imagination either\nto the _faculty of cognition_ or of _desire_. In either reference\nthe purposiveness of the given representation ought to be judged\nonly in respect of this _faculty_ (without purpose or interest); but\nin the first case it is ascribed to the Object as a _mathematical_\ndetermination of the Imagination, in the second as _dynamical_. And\nhence we have this twofold way of representing the sublime.\nA.--OF THE MATHEMATICALLY SUBLIME\n\u00a7 25. _Explanation of the term \u201csublime\u201d_\nWe call that _sublime_ which is _absolutely great_. But to be great,\nand to be a great something are quite different concepts (_magnitudo_\nand _quantitas_). In like manner to _say simply_ (_simpliciter_)\nthat anything is _great_ is quite different from saying that it is\n_absolutely great_ (_absolute, non comparative magnum_). The latter\nis _what is great beyond all comparison_.--What now is meant by the\nexpression that anything is great or small or of medium size? It is not\na pure concept of Understanding that is thus signified; still less is\nit an intuition of Sense, and just as little is it a concept of Reason,\nbecause it brings with it no principle of cognition. It must therefore\nbe a concept of Judgement or derived from one; and a subjective\npurposiveness of the representation in reference to the Judgement must\nlie at its basis. That anything is a magnitude (_quantum_) may be\ncognised from the thing itself, without any comparison of it with other\nthings; viz. if there is a multiplicity of the homogeneous constituting\none thing. But to cognise _how great_ it is always requires some other\nmagnitude as a measure. But because the judging of magnitude depends\nnot merely on multiplicity (number), but also on the magnitude of the\nunit (the measure), and since, to judge of the magnitude of this latter\nagain requires another as measure with which it may be compared, we\nsee that the determination of the magnitude of phenomena can supply no\nabsolute concept whatever of magnitude, but only a comparative one.\nIf now I say simply that anything is great, it appears that I have no\ncomparison in view, at least none with an objective measure; because\nit is thus not determined at all how great the object is. But although\nthe standard of comparison is merely subjective, yet the judgement none\nthe less claims universal assent; \u201cthis man is beautiful,\u201d and \u201che is\ntall,\u201d are judgements not limited merely to the judging subject, but,\nlike theoretical judgements, demanding the assent of every one.\nIn a judgement by which anything is designated simply as great, it\nis not merely meant that the object has a magnitude, but that this\nmagnitude is superior to that of many other objects of the same kind,\nwithout, however, any exact determination of this superiority. Thus\nthere is always at the basis of our judgement a standard which we\nassume as the same for every one; this, however, is not available for\nany logical (mathematically definite) judging of magnitude, but only\nfor aesthetical judging of the same, because it is a merely subjective\nstandard lying at the basis of the reflective judgement upon\nmagnitude. It may be empirical, as, _e.g._ the average size of the men\nknown to us, of animals of a certain kind, trees, houses, mountains,\netc. Or it may be a standard given _a priori_, which through the\ndefects of the judging subject is limited by the subjective conditions\nof presentation _in concreto_; as, _e.g._ in the practical sphere, the\ngreatness of a certain virtue, or of the public liberty and justice in\na country; or, in the theoretical sphere, the greatness of the accuracy\nor the inaccuracy of an observation or measurement that has been made,\netc.\nHere it is remarkable that, although we have no interest whatever in an\nObject,--_i.e._ its existence is indifferent to us,--yet its mere size,\neven if it is considered as formless, may bring a satisfaction with it\nthat is universally communicable, and that consequently involves the\nconsciousness of a subjective purposiveness in the use of our cognitive\nfaculty. This is not indeed a satisfaction in the Object (because\nit may be formless), as in the case of the Beautiful, in which the\nreflective Judgement finds itself purposively determined in reference\nto cognition in general; but [a satisfaction] in the extension of the\nImagination by itself.\nIf (under the above limitation) we say simply of an object \u201cit is\ngreat,\u201d this is no mathematically definite judgement but a mere\njudgement of reflection upon the representation of it, which is\nsubjectively purposive for a certain use of our cognitive powers in\nthe estimation of magnitude; and we always then bind up with the\nrepresentation a kind of respect, as also a kind of contempt for what\nwe simply call \u201csmall.\u201d Further, the judging of things as great or\nsmall extends to everything, even to all their characteristics; thus\nwe describe beauty as great or small. The reason of this is to be\nsought in the fact that whatever we present in intuition according to\nthe precept of the Judgement (and thus represent aesthetically) is\nalways a phenomenon and thus a quantum.\nBut if we call anything not only great, but absolutely great in every\npoint of view (great beyond all comparison), _i.e._ sublime, we soon\nsee that it is not permissible to seek for an adequate standard of this\noutside itself, but merely in itself. It is a magnitude which is like\nitself alone. It follows hence that the sublime is not to be sought in\nthe things of nature, but only in our Ideas; but in which of them it\nlies must be reserved for the Deduction.\nThe foregoing explanation can be thus expressed: _the sublime is that\nin comparison with which everything else is small_. Here we easily see\nthat nothing can be given in nature, however great it is judged by us\nto be, which could not if considered in another relation be reduced\nto the infinitely small; and conversely there is nothing so small,\nwhich does not admit of extension by our Imagination to the greatness\nof a world, if compared with still smaller standards. Telescopes have\nfurnished us with abundant material for making the first remark,\nmicroscopes for the second. Nothing, therefore, which can be an object\nof the senses, is, considered on this basis, to be called sublime.\nBut because there is in our Imagination a striving towards infinite\nprogress, and in our Reason a claim for absolute totality, regarded as\na real Idea, therefore this very inadequateness for that Idea in our\nfaculty for estimating the magnitude of things of sense, excites in\nus the feeling of a supersensible faculty. And it is not the object\nof sense, but the use which the Judgement naturally makes of certain\nobjects on behalf of this latter feeling, that is absolutely great; and\nin comparison every other use is small. Consequently it is the state\nof mind produced by a certain representation with which the reflective\nJudgement is occupied, and not the Object, that is to be called sublime.\nWe may therefore append to the preceding formulas explaining the\nsublime this other: _the sublime is that, the mere ability to think\nwhich, shows a faculty of the mind surpassing every standard of Sense_.\n\u00a7 26. _Of that estimation of the magnitude of natural things which is\nrequisite for the Idea of the Sublime_\nThe estimation of magnitude by means of concepts of number (or their\nsigns in Algebra) is mathematical; but that in mere intuition (by the\nmeasurement of the eye) is aesthetical. Now we can come by definite\nconcepts of _how great_ a thing is, [only][44] by numbers, of which the\nunit is the measure (at all events by series of numbers progressing\nto infinity); and so far all logical estimation of magnitude is\nmathematical. But since the magnitude of the measure must then be\nassumed known, and this again is only to be estimated mathematically\nby means of numbers,--the unit of which must be another [smaller]\nmeasure,--we can never have a first or fundamental measure, and\ntherefore can never have a definite concept of a given magnitude. So\nthe estimation of the magnitude of the fundamental measure must consist\nin this, that we can immediately apprehend it in intuition and use it\nby the Imagination for the presentation of concepts of number. That\nis, all estimation of the magnitude of the objects of nature is in the\nend aesthetical (_i.e._ subjectively and not objectively determined).\nNow for the mathematical estimation of magnitude there is, indeed, no\nmaximum (for the power of numbers extends to infinity); but for its\naesthetical estimation there is always a maximum, and of this I say\nthat if it is judged as the absolute measure than which no greater is\npossible subjectively (for the judging subject), it brings with it the\nIdea of the sublime and produces that emotion which no mathematical\nestimation of its magnitude by means of numbers can bring about (except\nso far as the aesthetical fundamental measure remains vividly in the\nImagination). For the former only presents relative magnitude by means\nof comparison with others of the same kind; but the latter presents\nmagnitude absolutely, so far as the mind can grasp it in an intuition.\nIn receiving a quantum into the Imagination by intuition, in order\nto be able to use it for a measure or as a unit for the estimation\nof magnitude by means of numbers, there are two operations of\nthe Imagination involved: _apprehension_ (_apprehensio_) and\n_comprehension_ (_comprehensio aesthetica_). As to apprehension there\nis no difficulty, for it can go on _ad infinitum_; but comprehension\nbecomes harder the further apprehension advances, and soon attains to\nits maximum, viz. the aesthetically greatest fundamental measure for\nthe estimation of magnitude. For when apprehension has gone so far that\nthe partial representations of sensuous intuition at first apprehended\nbegin to vanish in the Imagination, whilst this ever proceeds to the\napprehension of others, then it loses as much on the one side as it\ngains on the other; and in comprehension there is a maximum beyond\nwhich it cannot go.\nHence can be explained what _Savary_[45] remarks in his account of\nEgypt, viz. that we must keep from going very near the Pyramids just\nas much as we keep from going too far from them, in order to get the\nfull emotional effect from their size. For if we are too far away,\nthe parts to be apprehended (the stones lying one over the other) are\nonly obscurely represented, and the representation of them produces no\neffect upon the aesthetical judgement of the subject. But if we are\nvery near, the eye requires some time to complete the apprehension of\nthe tiers from the bottom up to the apex; and then the first tiers are\nalways partly forgotten before the Imagination has taken in the last,\nand so the comprehension of them is never complete.--The same thing\nmay sufficiently explain the bewilderment or, as it were, perplexity\nwhich, it is said, seizes the spectator on his first entrance into\nSt. Peter\u2019s at Rome. For there is here a feeling of the inadequacy\nof his Imagination for presenting the Ideas of a whole, wherein the\nImagination reaches its maximum, and, in striving to surpass it, sinks\nback into itself, by which, however, a kind of emotional satisfaction\nis produced.\nI do not wish to speak as yet of the ground of this satisfaction,\nwhich is bound up with a representation from which we should least\nof all expect it, viz. a representation which lets us remark its\ninadequacy and consequently its subjective want of purposiveness for\nthe Judgement in the estimation of magnitude. I only remark that if\nthe aesthetical judgement is pure (i.e. _mingled with no teleological\njudgement_ or judgement of Reason) and is to be given as a completely\nsuitable example of the Critique of the _aesthetical_ Judgement, we\nmust not exhibit the sublime in products of art (_e.g._ buildings,\npillars, etc.) where human purpose determines the form as well as\nthe size; nor yet in things of nature _the concepts of which bring\nwith them a definite purpose_ (_e.g._ animals with a known natural\ndestination); but in rude nature (and in this only in so far as it\ndoes not bring with it any charm or emotion produced by actual danger)\nmerely as containing magnitude. For in this kind of representation\nnature contains nothing monstrous (either magnificent or horrible);\nthe magnitude that is apprehended may be increased as much as you\nwish provided it can be comprehended in a whole by the Imagination.\nAn object is _monstrous_ if by its size it destroys the purpose which\nconstitutes the concept of it. But the mere presentation of a concept\nis called _colossal_, which is almost too great for any presentation\n(bordering on the relatively monstrous); because the purpose of\nthe presentation of a concept is made harder [to realise] by the\nintuition of the object being almost too great for our faculty of\napprehension.--A pure judgement upon the sublime must, however, have\nno purpose of the Object as its determining ground, if it is to be\naesthetical and not mixed up with any judgement of Understanding or\nReason.\n*       *       *       *       *\nBecause everything which is to give disinterested pleasure to the\nmerely reflective Judgement must bring with the representation\nof it, subjective and, as subjective, universally valid\npurposiveness--although no purposiveness of the _form_ of the\nobject lies (as in the case of the Beautiful) at the ground of the\njudgement--the question arises \u201cwhat is this subjective purposiveness?\u201d\nAnd how does it come to be prescribed as the norm by which a ground\nfor universally valid satisfaction is supplied in the mere estimation\nof magnitude, even in that which is forced up to the point where our\nfaculty of Imagination is inadequate for the presentation of the\nconcept of magnitude?\nIn the process of combination requisite for the estimation of\nmagnitude, the Imagination proceeds of itself to infinity without\nanything hindering it; but the Understanding guides it by means\nof concepts of number, for which the Imagination must furnish the\nschema. And in this procedure, as belonging to the logical estimation\nof magnitude, there is indeed something objectively purposive,--in\naccordance with the concept of a purpose (as all measurement is),--but\nnothing purposive and pleasing for the aesthetical Judgement. There is\nalso in this designed purposiveness nothing which would force us to\npush the magnitude of the measure, and consequently the _comprehension_\nof the manifold in an intuition, to the bounds of the faculty of\nImagination, or as far as ever this can reach in its presentations.\nFor in the estimation of magnitude by the Understanding (Arithmetic)\nwe only go to a certain point whether we push the comprehension of\nthe units up to the number 10 (as in the decimal scale) or only up to\n4 (as in the quaternary scale); the further production of magnitude\nproceeds by combination or, if the quantum is given in intuition, by\napprehension, but merely by way of progression (not of comprehension)\nin accordance with an assumed principle of progression. In this\nmathematical estimation of magnitude the Understanding is equally\nserved and contented whether the Imagination chooses for unit a\nmagnitude that we can take in in a glance, _e.g._ a foot or rod, or a\nGerman mile or even the earth\u2019s diameter,--of which the apprehension\nis indeed possible, but not the comprehension in an intuition of the\nImagination (not possible by _comprehensio aesthetica_, although quite\npossible by _comprehensio logica_ in a concept of number). In both\ncases the logical estimation of magnitude goes on without hindrance to\ninfinity.\nBut now the mind listens to the voice of Reason which, for every given\nmagnitude,--even for those that can never be entirely apprehended,\nalthough (in sensible representation) they are judged as entirely\ngiven,--requires totality. Reason consequently desires comprehension in\n_one_ intuition, and so the _presentation_ of all these members of a\nprogressively increasing series. It does not even exempt the infinite\n(space and past time) from this requirement; it rather renders it\nunavoidable to think the infinite (in the judgement of common Reason)\nas _entirely given_ (according to its totality).\nBut the infinite is absolutely (not merely comparatively) great.\nCompared with it everything else (of the same kind of magnitudes) is\nsmall. And what is most important is that to be able only to think it\nas _a whole_ indicates a faculty of mind which surpasses every standard\nof Sense. For [to represent it sensibly] would require a comprehension\nhaving for unit a standard bearing a definite relation, expressible\nin numbers, to the infinite; which is impossible. Nevertheless, _the\nbare capability of thinking_ this infinite without contradiction\nrequires in the human mind a faculty itself supersensible. For it\nis only by means of this faculty and its Idea of a noumenon,--which\nadmits of no intuition, but which yet serves as the substrate for the\nintuition of the world, as a mere phenomenon,--that the infinite of\nthe world of sense, in the pure intellectual estimation of magnitude,\ncan be _completely_ comprehended _under_ a concept, although in the\nmathematical estimation of magnitude by means of _concepts of number_\nit can never be completely thought. The faculty of being able to think\nthe infinite of supersensible intuition as given (in its intelligible\nsubstrate), surpasses every standard of sensibility, and is great\nbeyond all comparison even with the faculty of mathematical estimation;\nnot of course in a theoretical point of view and on behalf of the\ncognitive faculty, but as an extension of the mind which feels itself\nable in another (practical) point of view to go beyond the limit of\nsensibility.\nNature is therefore sublime in those of its phenomena, whose intuition\nbrings with it the Idea of their infinity. This last can only come by\nthe inadequacy of the greatest effort of our Imagination to estimate\nthe magnitude of an object. But now in mathematical estimation of\nmagnitude the Imagination is equal to providing a sufficient measure\nfor every object; because the numerical concepts of the Understanding,\nby means of progression, can make any measure adequate to any given\nmagnitude. Therefore it must be the _aesthetical_ estimation of\nmagnitude in which it is felt that the effort towards comprehension\nsurpasses the power of the Imagination to grasp in a whole of intuition\nthe progressive apprehension; and at the same time is perceived the\ninadequacy of this faculty, unbounded in its progress, for grasping\nand using, for the estimation of magnitude, a fundamental measure\nwhich could be made available by the Understanding with little\ntrouble. Now the proper unchangeable fundamental measure of nature is\nits absolute whole; which, regarding nature as a phenomenon, would\nbe infinity comprehended. But since this fundamental measure is a\nself-contradictory concept (on account of the impossibility of the\nabsolute totality of an endless progress), that magnitude of a natural\nObject, on which the Imagination fruitlessly spends its whole faculty\nof comprehension, must carry our concept of nature to a supersensible\nsubstrate (which lies at its basis and also at the basis of our faculty\nof thought). As this, however, is great beyond all standards of sense,\nit makes us judge as _sublime_, not so much the object, as our own\nstate of mind in the estimation of it.\nTherefore, just as the aesthetical Judgement in judging the Beautiful\nrefers the Imagination in its free play to the _Understanding_, in\norder to harmonise it with the _concepts_ of the latter in general\n(without any determination of them); so does the same faculty when\njudging a thing as Sublime refer itself to the _Reason_ in order that\nit may subjectively be in accordance with its _Ideas_ (no matter what\nthey are):--_i.e._ that it may produce a state of mind conformable\nto them and compatible with that brought about by the influence of\ndefinite (practical) Ideas upon feeling.\nWe hence see also that true sublimity must be sought only in the mind\nof the [subject] judging, not in the natural Object, the judgement upon\nwhich occasions this state. Who would call sublime, _e.g._ shapeless\nmountain masses piled in wild disorder upon each other with their\npyramids of ice, or the gloomy raging sea? But the mind feels itself\nelevated in its own judgement if, while contemplating them without\nany reference to their form, and abandoning itself to the Imagination\nand to the Reason--which although placed in combination with the\nImagination without any definite purpose, merely extends it--it yet\nfinds the whole power of the Imagination inadequate to its Ideas.\nExamples of the mathematically Sublime of nature in mere intuition are\nall the cases in which we are given, not so much a larger numerical\nconcept as a large unit for the measure of the Imagination (for\nshortening the numerical series). A tree, [the height of] which we\nestimate with reference to the height of a man, at all events gives\na standard for a mountain; and if this were a mile high, it would\nserve as unit for the number expressive of the earth\u2019s diameter, so\nthat the latter might be made intuitible. The earth\u2019s diameter [would\nsupply a unit] for the known planetary system; this again for the\nMilky Way; and the immeasurable number of milky way systems called\nnebulae,--which presumably constitute a system of the same kind among\nthemselves--lets us expect no bounds here. Now the Sublime in the\naesthetical judging of an immeasurable whole like this lies not so much\nin the greatness of the number [of units], as in the fact that in our\nprogress we ever arrive at yet greater units. To this the systematic\ndivision of the universe contributes, which represents every magnitude\nin nature as small in its turn; and represents our Imagination with\nits entire freedom from bounds, and with it Nature, as a mere nothing\nin comparison with the Ideas of Reason, if it is sought to furnish a\npresentation which shall be adequate to them.\n\u00a7 27. _Of the quality of the satisfaction in our judgements upon the\nSublime_\nThe feeling of our incapacity to attain to an Idea, _which is a law for\nus_, is RESPECT. Now the Idea of the comprehension of every phenomenon\nthat can be given us in the intuition of a whole, is an Idea prescribed\nto us by a law of Reason, which recognises no other measure, definite,\nvalid for every one, and invariable, than the absolute whole. But\nour Imagination, even in its greatest efforts, in respect of that\ncomprehension, which we expect from it, of a given object in a whole of\nintuition (and thus with reference to the presentation of the Idea of\nReason), exhibits its own limits and inadequacy; although at the same\ntime it shows that its destination is to make itself adequate to this\nIdea regarded as a law. Therefore the feeling of the Sublime in nature\nis respect for our own destination, which by a certain subreption we\nattribute to an Object of nature (conversion of respect for the Idea of\nhumanity in our own subject into respect for the Object). This makes\nintuitively evident the superiority of the rational determination of\nour cognitive faculties to the greatest faculty of our Sensibility.\nThe feeling of the Sublime is therefore a feeling of pain, arising\nfrom the want of accordance between the aesthetical estimation of\nmagnitude formed by the Imagination and the estimation of the same\nformed by Reason. There is at the same time a pleasure thus excited,\narising from the correspondence with rational Ideas of this very\njudgement of the inadequacy of our greatest faculty of Sense; in so\nfar as it is a law for us to strive after these Ideas. In fact it is\nfor us a law (of Reason), and belongs to our destination, to estimate\nas small, in comparison with Ideas of Reason, everything which nature,\nregarded as an object of Sense, contains that is great for us; and\nthat which arouses in us the feeling of this supersensible destination\nagrees with that law. Now the greatest effort of the Imagination in\nthe presentation of the unit for the estimation of magnitude indicates\na reference to something _absolutely great_; and consequently a\nreference to the law of Reason, which bids us take this alone as\nthe supreme measure of magnitude. Therefore the inner perception of\nthe inadequacy of all sensible standards for rational estimation of\nmagnitude indicates a correspondence with rational laws; it involves a\npain, which arouses in us the feeling of our supersensible destination,\naccording to which it is purposive and therefore pleasurable to find\nevery standard of Sensibility inadequate to the Ideas of Understanding.\nThe mind feels itself _moved_ in the representation of the Sublime\nin nature; whilst in aesthetical judgements about the Beautiful it\nis in _restful_ contemplation. This movement may (especially in\nits beginnings) be compared to a vibration, _i.e._ to a quickly\nalternating attraction towards, and repulsion from, the same Object.\nThe transcendent (towards which the Imagination is impelled in its\napprehension of intuition) is for the Imagination like an abyss in\nwhich it fears to lose itself; but for the rational Idea of the\nsupersensible it is not transcendent but in conformity with law to\nbring about such an effort of the Imagination, and consequently here\nthere is the same amount of attraction as there was of repulsion for\nthe mere Sensibility. But the judgement itself always remains in this\ncase only aesthetical, because--without having any determinate concept\nof the Object at its basis--it merely represents the subjective play\nof the mental powers (Imagination and Reason) as harmonious through\ntheir very contrast. For just as Imagination and _Understanding_, in\njudging of the Beautiful, generate a subjective purposiveness of the\nmental powers by means of their harmony, so [here[46]] Imagination and\n_Reason_ do so by means of their conflict. That is, they bring about a\nfeeling that we possess pure self-subsistent Reason, or a faculty for\nthe estimation of magnitude, whose pre-eminence can be made intuitively\nevident only by the inadequacy of that faculty [Imagination] which\nis itself unbounded in the presentation of magnitudes (of sensible\nobjects).\nThe measurement of a space (regarded as apprehension) is at the same\ntime a description of it, and thus an objective movement in the act\nof Imagination and a progress. On the other hand, the comprehension\nof the manifold in the unity,--not of thought but of intuition,--and\nconsequently the comprehension of the successively apprehended\n[elements] in one glance, is a regress, which annihilates the condition\nof time in this progress of the Imagination and makes _coexistence_\nintuitible.[47] It is therefore (since the time-series is a condition\nof the internal sense and of an intuition) a subjective movement of\nthe Imagination, by which it does violence to the internal sense;\nthis must be the more noticeable, the greater the quantum is which the\nImagination comprehends in one intuition. The effort, therefore, to\nreceive in one single intuition a measure for magnitudes that requires\nan appreciable time to apprehend, is a kind of representation, which,\nsubjectively considered, is contrary to purpose: but objectively, as\nrequisite for the estimation of magnitude, it is purposive. Thus that\nvery violence which is done to the subject through the Imagination is\njudged as purposive _in reference to the whole determination_ of the\nmind.\nThe _quality_ of the feeling of the Sublime is that it is a feeling\nof pain in reference to the faculty by which we judge aesthetically\nof an object, which pain, however, is represented at the same time as\npurposive. This is possible through the fact that the very incapacity\nin question discovers the consciousness of an unlimited faculty of\nthe same subject, and that the mind can only judge of the latter\naesthetically by means of the former.\nIn the logical estimation of magnitude the impossibility of ever\narriving at absolute totality, by means of the progress of the\nmeasurement of things of the sensible world in time and space, was\ncognised as objective, _i.e._ as an impossibility of _thinking_ the\ninfinite as entirely given; and not as merely subjective or that there\nwas only an incapacity to _grasp_ it. For there we have not to do with\nthe degree of comprehension in an intuition, regarded as a measure,\nbut everything depends on a concept of number. But in aesthetical\nestimation of magnitude the concept of number must disappear or be\nchanged, and the comprehension of the Imagination in reference to the\nunit of measure (thus avoiding the concepts of a law of the successive\nproduction of concepts of magnitude) is alone purposive for it.--If now\na magnitude almost reaches the limit of our faculty of comprehension\nin an intuition, and yet the Imagination is invited by means of\nnumerical magnitudes (in respect of which we are conscious that our\nfaculty is unbounded) to aesthetical comprehension in a greater unit,\nthen we mentally feel ourselves confined aesthetically within bounds.\nBut nevertheless the pain in regard to the necessary extension of the\nImagination for accordance with that which is unbounded in our faculty\nof Reason, viz. the Idea of the absolute whole, and consequently the\nvery unpurposiveness of the faculty of Imagination for rational Ideas\nand the arousing of them, are represented as purposive. Thus it is that\nthe aesthetical judgement itself is subjectively purposive for the\nReason as the source of Ideas, _i.e._ as the source of an intellectual\ncomprehension for which all aesthetical comprehension is small; and\nthere accompanies the reception of an object as sublime a pleasure,\nwhich is only possible through the medium of a pain.\nB.--OF THE DYNAMICALLY SUBLIME IN NATURE\n\u00a7 28. _Of Nature regarded as Might_\n_Might_ is that which is superior to great hindrances. It is called\n_dominion_ if it is superior to the resistance of that which itself\npossesses might. Nature considered in an aesthetical judgement as might\nthat has no dominion over us, is _dynamically sublime_.\nIf nature is to be judged by us as dynamically sublime, it must be\nrepresented as exciting fear (although it is not true conversely\nthat every object which excites fear is regarded in our aesthetical\njudgement as sublime). For in aesthetical judgements (without the aid\nof concepts) superiority to hindrances can only be judged according\nto the greatness of the resistance. Now that which we are driven to\nresist is an evil, and, if we do not find our faculties a match for it,\nis an object of fear. Hence nature can be regarded by the aesthetical\nJudgement as might, and consequently as dynamically sublime, only so\nfar as it is considered an object of fear.\nBut we can regard an object as _fearful_, without being afraid _of_\nit; viz. if we judge of it in such a way that we merely _think_ a case\nin which we would wish to resist it, and yet in which all resistance\nwould be altogether vain. Thus the virtuous man fears God without being\nafraid of Him; because to wish to resist Him and His commandments, he\nthinks is a case as to which _he_ need not be anxious. But in every\nsuch case that he thinks as not impossible, he cognises Him as fearful.\nHe who fears can form no judgement about the Sublime in nature; just\nas he who is seduced by inclination and appetite can form no judgement\nabout the Beautiful. The former flies from the sight of an object which\ninspires him with awe; and it is impossible to find satisfaction in\na terror that is seriously felt. Hence the pleasurableness arising\nfrom the cessation of an uneasiness is _a state of joy_. But this, on\naccount of the deliverance from danger [which is involved], is a state\nof joy conjoined with the resolve not to expose ourselves to the danger\nagain; we cannot willingly look back upon our sensations [of danger],\nmuch less seek the occasion for them again.\nBold, overhanging, and as it were threatening, rocks; clouds piled up\nin the sky, moving with lightning flashes and thunder peals; volcanoes\nin all their violence of destruction; hurricanes with their track\nof devastation; the boundless ocean in a state of tumult; the lofty\nwaterfall of a mighty river, and such like; these exhibit our faculty\nof resistance as insignificantly small in comparison with their might.\nBut the sight of them is the more attractive, the more fearful it\nis, provided only that we are in security; and we readily call these\nobjects sublime, because they raise the energies of the soul above\ntheir accustomed height, and discover in us a faculty of resistance of\na quite different kind, which gives us courage to measure ourselves\nagainst the apparent almightiness of nature.\nNow, in the immensity of nature, and in the inadequacy of our faculties\nfor adopting a standard proportionate to the aesthetical estimation of\nthe magnitude of its _realm_, we find our own limitation; although at\nthe same time in our rational faculty we find a different, non-sensuous\nstandard, which has that infinity itself under it as a unit, and in\ncomparison with which everything in nature is small. Thus in our mind\nwe find a superiority to nature even in its immensity. And so also\nthe irresistibility of its might, while making us recognise our own\n[physical[48]] impotence, considered as beings of nature, discloses\nto us a faculty of judging independently of, and a superiority over,\nnature; on which is based a kind of self-preservation, entirely\ndifferent from that which can be attacked and brought into danger by\nexternal nature. Thus, humanity in our person remains unhumiliated,\nthough the individual might have to submit to this dominion. In this\nway nature is not judged to be sublime in our aesthetical judgements,\nin so far as it excites fear; but because it calls up that power in\nus (which is not nature) of regarding as small the things about which\nwe are solicitous (goods, health, and life), and of regarding its\nmight (to which we are no doubt subjected in respect of these things),\nas nevertheless without any dominion over us and our personality to\nwhich we must bow where our highest fundamental propositions, and\ntheir assertion or abandonment, are concerned. Therefore nature is\nhere called sublime merely because it elevates the Imagination to a\npresentation of those cases in which the mind can make felt the proper\nsublimity of its destination, in comparison with nature itself.\nThis estimation of ourselves loses nothing through the fact that\nwe must regard ourselves as safe in order to feel this inspiriting\nsatisfaction; and that hence, as there is no seriousness in the\ndanger, there might be also (as might seem to be the case) just as\nlittle seriousness in the sublimity of our spiritual faculty. For\nthe satisfaction here concerns only the _destination_ of our faculty\nwhich discloses itself in such a case, so far as the tendency to this\ndestination lies in our nature, whilst its development and exercise\nremain incumbent and obligatory. And in this there is truth, however\nconscious the man may be of his present actual powerlessness, when he\nstretches his reflection so far.\nNo doubt this principle seems to be too far-fetched and too subtly\nreasoned, and consequently seems to go beyond the scope of an\naesthetical judgement; but observation of men proves the opposite, and\nshows that it may lie at the root of the most ordinary judgements,\nalthough we are not always conscious of it. For what is that which is,\neven to the savage, an object of the greatest admiration? It is a man\nwho shrinks from nothing, who fears nothing, and therefore does not\nyield to danger, but rather goes to face it vigorously with the fullest\ndeliberation. Even in the most highly civilised state this peculiar\nveneration for the soldier remains, though only under the condition\nthat he exhibit all the virtues of peace, gentleness, compassion, and\neven a becoming care for his own person; because even by these it\nis recognised that his mind is unsubdued by danger. Hence whatever\ndisputes there may be about the superiority of the respect which is\nto be accorded them, in the comparison of a statesman and a general,\nthe aesthetical judgement decides for the latter. War itself, if it\nis carried on with order and with a sacred respect for the rights of\ncitizens, has something sublime in it, and makes the disposition of the\npeople who carry it on thus, only the more sublime, the more numerous\nare the dangers to which they are exposed, and in respect of which\nthey behave with courage. On the other hand, a long peace generally\nbrings about a predominant commercial spirit, and along with it, low\nselfishness, cowardice, and effeminacy, and debases the disposition of\nthe people.[49]\nIt appears to conflict with this solution of the concept of the\nsublime, so far as sublimity is ascribed to might, that we are\naccustomed to represent God as presenting Himself in His wrath and\nyet in His sublimity, in the tempest, the storm, the earthquake, etc.;\nand that it would be foolish and criminal to imagine a superiority of\nour minds over these works of His, and, as it seems, even over the\ndesigns of such might. Hence it would appear that no feeling of the\nsublimity of our own nature, but rather subjection, abasement, and a\nfeeling of complete powerlessness, is a fitting state of mind before\nthe manifestation of such an object, and this is generally bound up\nwith the Idea of it during natural phenomena of this kind. Generally in\nreligion, prostration, adoration with bent head, with contrite, anxious\ndemeanour and voice, seems to be the only fitting behaviour in presence\nof the Godhead; and hence most peoples have adopted and still observe\nit. But this state of mind is far from being necessarily bound up with\nthe Idea of the _sublimity_ of a religion and its object. The man who\nis actually afraid, because he finds reasons for fear in himself,\nwhilst conscious by his culpable disposition of offending against a\nMight whose will is irresistible and at the same time just, is not in\nthe frame of mind for admiring the divine greatness. For this a mood of\ncalm contemplation and a quite free judgement are needed. Only if he is\nconscious of an upright disposition pleasing to God do those operations\nof might serve to awaken in him the Idea of the sublimity of this\nBeing, for then he recognises in himself a sublimity of disposition\nconformable to His will; and thus he is raised above the fear of such\noperations of nature, which he no longer regards as outbursts of His\nwrath. Even humility, in the shape of a stern judgement upon his own\nfaults,--which otherwise, with a consciousness of good intentions,\ncould be easily palliated from the frailty of human nature,--is a\nsublime state of mind, consisting in a voluntary subjection of himself\nto the pain of remorse, in order that its causes may be gradually\nremoved. In this way religion is essentially distinguished from\nsuperstition. The latter establishes in the mind, not reverence for the\nSublime, but fear and apprehension of the all-powerful Being to whose\nwill the terrified man sees himself subject, without according Him any\nhigh esteem. From this nothing can arise but a seeking of favour, and\nflattery, instead of a religion which consists in a good life.[50]\nSublimity, therefore, does not reside in anything of nature, but only\nin our mind, in so far as we can become conscious that we are superior\nto nature within, and therefore also to nature without us (so far\nas it influences us). Everything that excites this feeling in us,\n_e.g._ the _might_ of nature which calls forth our forces, is called\nthen (although improperly) sublime. Only by supposing this Idea in\nourselves, and in reference to it, are we capable of attaining to the\nIdea of the sublimity of that Being, which produces respect in us, not\nmerely by the might that it displays in nature, but rather by means\nof the faculty which resides in us of judging it fearlessly and of\nregarding our destination as sublime in respect of it.\n\u00a7 29. _Of the modality of the judgement upon the sublime in nature_\nThere are numberless beautiful things in nature about which we can\nassume and even expect, without being far mistaken, the harmony of\nevery one\u2019s judgement with our own. But in respect of our judgement\nupon the sublime in nature, we cannot promise ourselves so easily\nthe accordance of others. For a far greater culture, as well of the\naesthetical Judgement as of the cognitive faculties which lie at its\nbasis, seems requisite in order to be able to pass judgement on this\npre-eminent quality of natural objects.\nThat the mind be attuned to feel the sublime postulates a\nsusceptibility of the mind for Ideas. For in the very inadequacy of\nnature to these latter, and thus only by presupposing them and by\nstraining the Imagination to use nature as a schema for them, is to\nbe found that which is terrible to sensibility and yet is attractive.\n[It is attractive] because Reason exerts a dominion over sensibility\nin order to extend it in conformity with its own realm (the practical)\nand to make it look out into the Infinite, which is for it an abyss. In\nfact, without development of moral Ideas, that which we, prepared by\nculture, call sublime, presents itself to the uneducated man merely as\nterrible. In the indications of the dominion of nature in destruction,\nand in the great scale of its might, in comparison with which his own\nis a vanishing quantity, he will only see the misery, danger, and\ndistress which surround the man who is exposed to it. So the good,\nand indeed intelligent, Savoyard peasant (as Herr von _Saussure_[51]\nrelates) unhesitatingly called all lovers of snow-mountains fools. And\nwho knows, whether he would have been so completely wrong, if Saussure\nhad undertaken the danger to which he exposed himself merely, as most\ntravellers do, from amateur curiosity, or that he might be able to give\na pathetic account of them? But his design was the instruction of men;\nand this excellent man gave the readers of his Travels, soul-stirring\nsensations such as he himself had, into the bargain.\nBut although the judgement upon the Sublime in nature needs culture\n(more than the judgement upon the Beautiful), it is not therefore\nprimarily produced by culture and introduced in a merely conventional\nway into society. Rather has it root in human nature, even in that\nwhich, alike with common Understanding, we can impute to and expect of\nevery one, viz. in the tendency to the feeling for (practical) Ideas,\n_i.e._ to the moral feeling.\nHereon is based the necessity of that agreement of the judgement of\nothers about the sublime with our own which we include in the latter.\nFor just as we charge with want of _taste_ the man who is indifferent\nwhen passing judgement upon an object of nature that we regard as\nbeautiful; so we say of him who remains unmoved in the presence of that\nwhich we judge to be sublime, he has no _feeling_. But we claim both\nfrom every man, and we presuppose them in him if he has any culture at\nall; only with the difference, that we expect the former directly of\nevery one, because in it the Judgement refers the Imagination merely to\nthe Understanding, the faculty of concepts; but the latter, because\nin it the Imagination is related to the Reason, the faculty of Ideas,\nonly under a subjective presupposition (which, however, we believe we\nare authorised in imputing to every one), viz. the presupposition of\nthe moral feeling [in man.[52]] Thus it is that we ascribe necessity to\nthis aesthetical judgement also.\nIn this modality of aesthetical judgements, viz. in the necessity\nclaimed for them, lies an important moment of the Critique of\nJudgement. For it enables us to recognise in them an _a priori_\nprinciple, and raises them out of empirical psychology, in which\notherwise they would remain buried amongst the feelings of\ngratification and grief (only with the unmeaning addition of being\ncalled _finer_ feelings). Thus it enables us too to place the Judgement\namong those faculties that have _a priori_ principles at their basis,\nand so to bring it into Transcendental Philosophy.\nGENERAL REMARK UPON THE EXPOSITION OF THE AESTHETICAL REFLECTIVE\nJUDGEMENT\nIn reference to the feeling of pleasure an object is to be classified\nas either _pleasant_, or _beautiful_, or _sublime_, or _good_\n(absolutely), (_jucundum_, _pulchrum_, _sublime_, _honestum_).\nThe _pleasant_, as motive of desire, is always of one and the same\nkind, no matter whence it comes and however specifically different\nthe representation (of sense, and sensation objectively considered)\nmay be. Hence in judging its influence on the mind, account is taken\nonly of the number of its charms (simultaneous and successive), and\nso only of the mass, as it were, of the pleasant sensation; and this\ncan be made intelligible only by _quantity_. It has no reference\nto culture, but belongs to mere enjoyment.--On the other hand, the\n_beautiful_ requires the representation of a certain _quality_ of\nthe Object, that can be made intelligible and reduced to concepts\n(although it is not so reduced in an aesthetical judgement); and it\ncultivates us, in that it teaches us to attend to the purposiveness\nin the feeling of pleasure.--The _sublime_ consists merely in the\n_relation_ by which the sensible in the representation of nature is\njudged available for a possible supersensible use.--The _absolutely\ngood_, subjectively judged according to the feeling that it inspires\n(the Object of the moral feeling), as capable of determining the powers\nof the subject through the representation of an _absolutely compelling_\nlaw, is specially distinguished by the _modality_ of a necessity that\nrests _a priori_ upon concepts. This necessity involves not merely\na _claim_, but a _command_ for the assent of every one, and belongs\nin itself to the pure intellectual, rather than to the aesthetical\nJudgement; and is by a determinant and not a mere reflective judgement\nascribed not to Nature but to Freedom. But the _determinability of\nthe subject_ by means of this Idea, and especially of a subject\nthat can feel _hindrances_ in sensibility, and at the same time its\nsuperiority to them by their subjugation involving a _modification of\nits state_--_i.e._ the moral feeling,--is yet so far cognate to the\naesthetical Judgement and its formal conditions that it can serve to\nrepresent the conformity to law of action from duty as aesthetical,\n_i.e._ as sublime or even as beautiful, without losing its purity. This\nwould not be so, if we were to put it in natural combination with the\nfeeling of the pleasant.\nIf we take the result of the foregoing exposition of the two kinds\nof aesthetical judgements, there arise therefrom the following short\nexplanations:\nThe _Beautiful_ is what pleases in the mere judgement (and therefore\nnot by the medium of sensation in accordance with a concept of the\nUnderstanding). It follows at once from this that it must please apart\nfrom all interest.\nThe _Sublime_ is what pleases immediately through its opposition to the\ninterest of sense.\nBoth, as explanations of aesthetical universally valid judging,\nare referred to subjective grounds; in the one case to grounds of\nsensibility, in favour of the contemplative Understanding; in the other\ncase _in opposition to_ sensibility, but on behalf of the purposes\nof practical Reason. Both, however, united in the same subject, are\npurposive in reference to the moral feeling. The Beautiful prepares\nus to love disinterestedly something, even nature itself; the Sublime\nprepares us to esteem something highly even in opposition to our own\n(sensible) interest.\nWe may describe the Sublime thus: it is an object (of nature)\n_the representation of which determines the mind to think the\nunattainability of nature regarded as a presentation of Ideas_.\nLiterally taken and logically considered, Ideas cannot be presented.\nBut if we extend our empirical representative faculty (mathematically\nor dynamically) to the intuition of nature, Reason inevitably\nintervenes, as the faculty expressing the independence of absolute\ntotality,[53] and generates the effort of the mind, vain though it\nbe, to make the representation of the senses adequate to this. This\neffort,--and the feeling of the unattainability of the Idea by means\nof the Imagination,--is itself a presentation of the subjective\npurposiveness of our mind in the employment of the Imagination for\nits supersensible destination; and forces us, subjectively, to\n_think_ nature itself in its totality as a presentation of something\nsupersensible, without being able _objectively_ to arrive at this\npresentation.\nFor we soon see that nature in space and time entirely lacks the\nunconditioned, and, consequently, that absolute magnitude, which yet is\ndesired by the most ordinary Reason. It is by this that we are reminded\nthat we only have to do with nature as phenomenon, and that it must\nbe regarded as the mere presentation of a nature in itself (of which\nReason has the Idea). But this Idea of the supersensible, which we can\nno further determine,--so that we cannot _know_ but only _think_ nature\nas its presentation,--is awakened in us by means of an object, whose\naesthetical appreciation strains the Imagination to its utmost bounds,\nwhether of extension (mathematical) or of its might over the mind\n(dynamical). And this judgement is based upon a feeling of the mind\u2019s\ndestination, which entirely surpasses the realm of the former (_i.e._\nupon the moral feeling), in respect of which the representation of the\nobject is judged as subjectively purposive.\nIn fact, a feeling for the Sublime in nature cannot well be thought\nwithout combining therewith a mental disposition which is akin to the\nMoral. And although the immediate pleasure in the Beautiful of nature\nlikewise presupposes and cultivates a certain _liberality_ in our\nmental attitude, _i.e._ a satisfaction independent of mere sensible\nenjoyment, yet freedom is thus represented as in _play_ rather than\nin that law-directed _occupation_ which is the genuine characteristic\nof human morality, in which Reason must exercise dominion over\nSensibility. But in aesthetical judgements upon the Sublime this\ndominion is represented as exercised by the Imagination, regarded as an\ninstrument of Reason.\nThe satisfaction in the Sublime of nature is then only _negative_\n(whilst that in the Beautiful is _positive_); viz. a feeling that the\nImagination is depriving itself of its freedom, while it is purposively\ndetermined according to a different law from that of its empirical\nemployment. It thus acquires an extension and a might greater than it\nsacrifices,--the ground of which, however, is concealed from itself;\nwhilst yet it _feels_ the sacrifice or the deprivation and, at the\nsame time, the cause to which it is subjected. _Astonishment_, that\nborders upon terror, the dread and the holy awe which seizes the\nobserver at the sight of mountain peaks rearing themselves to heaven,\ndeep chasms and streams raging therein, deep-shadowed solitudes that\ndispose one to melancholy meditations--this, in the safety in which we\nknow ourselves to be, is not actual fear, but only an attempt to feel\nfear by the aid of the Imagination; that we may feel the might of this\nfaculty in combining with the mind\u2019s repose the mental movement thereby\nexcited, and being thus superior to internal nature,--and therefore\nto external,--so far as this can have any influence on our feeling of\nwell-being. For the Imagination by the laws of Association makes our\nstate of contentment dependent on physical [causes]; but it also,\nby the principles of the Schematism of the Judgement (being so far,\ntherefore, ranked under freedom), is the instrument of Reason and its\nIdeas, and, as such, has might to maintain our independence of natural\ninfluences, to regard as small what in reference to them is great, and\nso to place the absolutely great only in the proper destination of the\nsubject. The raising of this reflection of the aesthetical Judgement\nso as to be adequate to Reason (though without a definite concept of\nReason) represents the object as subjectively purposive, even by the\nobjective want of accordance between the Imagination in its greatest\nextension and the Reason (as the faculty of Ideas).\nWe must here, generally, attend to what has been already noted, that\nin the Transcendental Aesthetic of Judgement we must speak solely of\npure aesthetical judgements; consequently our examples are not to be\ntaken from such beautiful or sublime objects of Nature as presuppose\nthe concept of a purpose. For, if so, the purposiveness would be\neither teleological, or would be based on mere sensations of an object\n(gratification or grief); and thus would be in the former case not\naesthetical, in the latter not merely formal. If then we call the sight\nof the starry heaven _sublime_, we must not place at the basis of our\njudgement concepts of worlds inhabited by rational beings, and regard\nthe bright points, with which we see the space above us filled, as\ntheir suns moving in circles purposively fixed with reference to them;\nbut we must regard it, just as we see it, as a distant, all-embracing\nvault. Only under such a representation can we range that sublimity\nwhich a pure aesthetical judgement ascribes to this object. And in\nthe same way, if we are to call the sight of the ocean sublime, we\nmust not _think_ of it as we [ordinarily] do, endowed as we are with\nall kinds of knowledge (not contained, however, in the immediate\nintuition). For example, we sometimes think of the ocean as a vast\nkingdom of aquatic creatures; or as the great source of those vapours\nthat fill the air with clouds for the benefit of the land; or again\nas an element which, though dividing continents from each other, yet\npromotes the greatest communication between them: but these furnish\nmerely teleological judgements. To call the ocean sublime we must\nregard it as poets do, merely by what strikes the eye; if it is at\nrest, as a clear mirror of water only bounded by the heaven; if it is\nrestless, as an abyss threatening to overwhelm everything. The like is\nto be said of the Sublime and Beautiful in the human figure. We must\nnot regard as the determining grounds of our judgement the concepts\nof the purposes which all our limbs serve, and we must not allow this\ncoincidence to _influence_ our aesthetical judgement (for then it would\nno longer be pure); although it is certainly a necessary condition of\naesthetical satisfaction that there should be no conflict between them.\nAesthetical purposiveness is the conformity to law of the Judgement in\nits _freedom_. The satisfaction in the object depends on the relation\nin which we wish to place the Imagination; always provided that it by\nitself entertains the mind in free occupation. If, on the other hand,\nthe judgement be determined by anything else,--whether sensation or\nconcept,--although it may be conformable to law, it cannot be the act\nof a _free_ Judgement.\nIf then we speak of intellectual beauty or sublimity, these expressions\nare, _first_, not quite accurate, because beauty and sublimity are\naesthetical modes of representation, which would not be found in us at\nall if we were pure intelligences (or even regarded ourselves as such\nin thought). _Secondly_, although both, as objects of an intellectual\n(moral) satisfaction, are so far compatible with aesthetical\nsatisfaction that they _rest_ upon no interest, yet they are difficult\nto unite with it, because they are meant to _produce_ an interest.\nThis, if its presentation is to harmonise with the satisfaction in the\naesthetical judgement, could only arise by means of a sensible interest\nthat we combine with it in the presentation; and thus damage would be\ndone to the intellectual purposiveness, and it would lose its purity.\nThe object of a pure and unconditioned intellectual satisfaction is\nthe Moral Law in that might which it exercises in us over all mental\nmotives _that precede it_. This might only makes itself aesthetically\nknown to us through sacrifices (which causing a feeling of deprivation,\nthough on behalf of internal freedom, in return discloses in us an\nunfathomable depth of this supersensible faculty, with consequences\nextending beyond our ken); thus the satisfaction on the aesthetical\nside (in relation to sensibility) is negative, _i.e._ against this\ninterest, but regarded from the intellectual side it is positive and\ncombined with an interest. Hence it follows that the intellectual,\nin itself purposive, (moral) good, aesthetically judged, must be\nrepresented as sublime rather than beautiful, so that it rather awakens\nthe feeling of respect (which disdains charm) than that of love and\nfamiliar inclination; for human nature does not attach itself to this\ngood spontaneously, but only by the authority which Reason exercises\nover Sensibility. Conversely also, that which we call sublime in\nnature, whether external or internal (_e.g._ certain affections), is\nonly represented as a might in the mind to overcome [_certain_][54]\nhindrances of the Sensibility by means of moral fundamental\npropositions, and only thus does it interest.\nI will dwell a moment on this latter point. The Idea of the Good\nconjoined with affection is called _enthusiasm_. This state of mind\nseems to be sublime, to the extent that we commonly assert that\nnothing great could be done without it. Now every affection[55] is\nblind, either in the choice of its purpose, or, if this be supplied\nby Reason, in its accomplishment; for it is a mental movement which\nmakes it impossible to exercise a free deliberation about fundamental\npropositions so as to determine ourselves thereby. It can therefore in\nno way deserve the approval of the Reason. Nevertheless, aesthetically,\nenthusiasm is sublime, because it is a tension of forces produced\nby Ideas, which give an impulse to the mind, that operates far more\npowerfully and lastingly than the impulse arising from sensible\nrepresentations. But (which seems strange) the _absence of affection_\n(_apatheia, phlegma in significatu bono_) in a mind that vigorously\nfollows its unalterable principles is sublime, and in a far preferable\nway, because it has also on its side the satisfaction of pure\nReason.[56] It is only a mental state of this kind that is called\nnoble; and this expression is subsequently applied to things, _e.g._ a\nbuilding, a garment, literary style, bodily presence, etc., when these\ndo not so much arouse _astonishment_ (the affection produced by the\nrepresentation of novelty exceeding our expectations), as _admiration_\n(astonishment that does not cease when the novelty disappears); and\nthis is the case when Ideas agree in their presentation undesignedly\nand artlessly with the aesthetical satisfaction.\nEvery affection of the STRENUOUS kind (viz. that excites the\nconsciousness of our power to overcome every obstacle--_animi strenui_)\nis _aesthetically sublime_, _e.g._ wrath, even despair (_i.e._ the\ndespair of _indignation_, not of _faintheartedness_). But affections of\nthe LANGUID kind (which make the very effort of resistance an object\nof pain--_animum languidum_) have nothing _noble_ in themselves, but\nthey may be reckoned under the sensuously beautiful. _Emotions_,\nwhich may rise to the strength of affections, are very different.\nWe have both _spirited_ and _tender_ emotions. The latter, if they\nrise to the height of affections, are worthless; the propensity to\nthem is called _sentimentality_. A sympathetic grief that will not\nadmit of consolation, or one referring to imaginary evils to which\nwe deliberately surrender ourselves--being deceived by fancy--as if\nthey were actual, indicates and produces a tender,[57] though weak,\nsoul--which shows a beautiful side and which can be called fanciful,\nthough not enthusiastic. Romances, lacrymose plays, shallow moral\nprecepts, which toy with (falsely) so-called moral dispositions, but\nin fact make the heart languid, insensible to the severe precept of\nduty, and incapable of all respect for the worth of humanity in our\nown person, and for the rights of men (a very different thing from\ntheir happiness), and in general incapable of all steady principle;\neven a religious discourse,[58] which recommends a cringing, abject\nseeking of favour and ingratiation of ourselves, which proposes the\nabandonment of all confidence in our own faculties in opposition to\nthe evil within us, instead of a sturdy resolution to endeavour to\novercome our inclinations by means of those powers which with all our\nfrailty yet remain to us; that false humility which sets the only\nway of pleasing the Supreme Being in self-depreciation, in whining\nhypocritical repentance and in a mere passive state of mind--these are\nnot compatible with any frame of mind that can be counted beautiful,\nstill less with one which is to be counted sublime.\nBut even stormy movements of mind which may be connected under the\nname of edification with Ideas of religion, or--as merely belonging\nto culture--with Ideas containing a social interest, can in no way,\nhowever they strain the Imagination, lay claim to the honour of\nbeing _sublime_ presentations, unless they leave after them a mental\nmood which, although only indirectly, has influence upon the mind\u2019s\nconsciousness of its strength, and its resolution in reference to that\nwhich involves pure intellectual purposiveness (the supersensible). For\notherwise all these emotions belong only to _motion_, which one would\nfain enjoy for the sake of health. The pleasant exhaustion, consequent\nupon such disturbance produced by the play of the affections, is an\nenjoyment of our well-being arising from the restored equilibrium of\nthe various vital forces. This in the end amounts to the same thing as\nthat state which Eastern voluptuaries find so delightful, when they\nget their bodies as it were kneaded and all their muscles and joints\nsoftly pressed and bent; only that in this case the motive principle\nis for the most part external, in the other case it is altogether\ninternal. Many a man believes himself to be edified by a sermon, when\nindeed there is no edification at all (no system of good maxims); or\nto be improved by a tragedy, when he is only glad at his ennui being\nhappily dispelled. So the Sublime must always have reference to the\n_disposition_, _i.e._ to the maxims which furnish to the intellectual\n[part] and to the Ideas of Reason a superiority over sensibility.\nWe need not fear that the feeling of the sublime will lose by so\nabstract a mode of presentation,--which is quite negative in respect\nof what is sensible,--for the Imagination, although it finds nothing\nbeyond the sensible to which it can attach itself, yet feels itself\nunbounded by this removal of its limitations; and thus that very\nabstraction is a presentation of the Infinite, which can be nothing\nbut a mere negative presentation, but which yet expands the soul.\nPerhaps there is no sublimer passage in the Jewish Law than the\ncommand, _Thou shalt not make to thyself any graven image, nor the\nlikeness of anything which is in heaven or on the earth or under the\nearth_, etc. This command alone can explain the enthusiasm that the\nJewish people in their moral period felt for their religion, when they\ncompared themselves with other peoples; or explain the pride which\nMahommedanism inspires. The same is true of the moral law and of the\ntendency to morality in us. It is quite erroneous to fear that if we\ndeprive this [tendency] of all that can recommend it to sense it will\nonly involve a cold lifeless assent and no moving force or emotion. It\nis quite the other way, for where the senses see nothing more before\nthem, and the unmistakable and indelible Idea of morality remains,\nit would be rather necessary to moderate the impetus of an unbounded\nImagination, to prevent it from rising to enthusiasm, than through fear\nof the powerlessness of these Ideas to seek aid for them in images and\nchildish ritual. Thus governments have willingly allowed religion to be\nabundantly provided with the latter accessories; and seeking thereby\nto relieve their subjects of trouble, they have also sought to deprive\nthem of the faculty of extending their spiritual powers beyond the\nlimits that are arbitrarily assigned to them, and by means of which\nthey can be the more easily treated as mere passive[59] beings.\nThis pure, elevating, merely negative presentation of morality brings\nwith it, on the other hand, no danger of _fanaticism_, which is _a\ndelusion that we can will ourselves to see something beyond all bounds\nof sensibility_, _i.e._ to dream in accordance with fundamental\npropositions (or to go mad with Reason); and this is so just because\nthis presentation is merely negative. For the _inscrutableness of the\nIdea of Freedom_ quite cuts it off from any positive presentation; but\nthe moral law is in itself sufficiently and originally determinant\nin us, so that it does not permit us to cast a glance at any ground\nof determination external to itself. If enthusiasm is comparable to\n_madness_, fanaticism is comparable to _monomania_; of which the latter\nis least of all compatible with the sublime, because in its detail it\nis ridiculous. In enthusiasm, regarded as an affection, the Imagination\nis without bridle; in fanaticism, regarded as an inveterate, brooding\npassion, it is without rule. The first is a transitory accident which\nsometimes befalls the soundest Understanding; the second is a disease\nwhich unsettles it.\n_Simplicity_ (purposiveness without art) is as it were the style of\nNature in the sublime, and so also of Morality which is a second\n(supersensible) nature; of which we only know the laws without being\nable to reach by intuition that supersensible faculty in ourselves\nwhich contains the ground of the legislation.\nNow the satisfaction in the Beautiful, like that in the Sublime,\nis not alone distinguishable from other aesthetical judgements by\nits universal _communicability_, but also because, through this\nvery property, it acquires an interest in reference to society (in\nwhich this communication is possible). We must, however, remark that\n_separation from all society_ is regarded as sublime, if it rests\nupon Ideas that overlook all sensible interest. To be sufficient for\noneself, and consequently to have no need of society, without at the\nsame time being unsociable, _i.e._ without flying from it, is something\nbordering on the sublime; as is any dispensing with wants. On the other\nhand, to fly from men from _misanthropy_, because we bear ill-will to\nthem, or from _anthropophoby_ (shyness), because we fear them as foes,\nis partly hateful, partly contemptible. There is indeed a misanthropy\n(very improperly so-called), the tendency to which frequently appears\nwith old age in many right-thinking men; which is philanthropic enough\nas far as _goodwill_ to men is concerned, but which through long and\nsad experience is far removed from _satisfaction_ with men. Evidence of\nthis is afforded by the propensity to solitude, the fantastic wish for\na secluded country seat, or (in the case of young persons) by the dream\nof the happiness of passing one\u2019s life with a little family upon some\nisland unknown to the rest of the world; a dream of which story-tellers\nor writers of Robinsonades know how to make good use. Falsehood,\ningratitude, injustice, the childishness of the purposes regarded by\nourselves as important and great, in the pursuit of which men inflict\nupon each other all imaginable evils, are so contradictory to the Idea\nof what men might be if they would, and conflict so with our lively\nwish to see them better, that, in order that we may not hate them\n(since we cannot love them), the renunciation of all social joys seems\nbut a small sacrifice. This sadness--not the sadness (of which sympathy\nis the cause) for the evils which fate brings upon others,--but for\nthose things which men do to one another (which depends upon an\nantipathy in fundamental propositions), is sublime, because it rests\nupon Ideas, whilst the former can only count as beautiful.--The\nbrilliant and thorough _Saussure_,[60] in his account of his Alpine\ntravels, says of one of the Savoy mountains, called _Bonhomme_, \u201cThere\nreigns there a certain _insipid sadness_.\u201d He therefore recognised an\n_interesting_ sadness, that the sight of a solitude might inspire, to\nwhich men might wish to transport themselves that they might neither\nhear nor experience any more of the world; which, however, would not\nbe quite so inhospitable that it would offer only an extremely painful\nretreat.--I make this remark solely with the design of indicating\nagain that even depression (not dejected sadness) may be counted among\nthe _sturdy_ affections, if it has its ground in moral Ideas. But if it\nis grounded on sympathy and, as such, is amiable, it belongs merely to\nthe _languid_ affections. [I make this remark] to call attention to the\nstate of mind which is _sublime_ only in the first case.\n*       *       *       *       *\nWe can now compare the above Transcendental Exposition of aesthetical\njudgements with the Physiological worked out by _Burke_ and by many\nclear-headed men among us, in order to see whither a merely empirical\nexposition of the Sublime and Beautiful leads. _Burke_, who deserves\nto be regarded as the most important author who adopts this mode of\ntreatment, infers by this method \u201cthat the feeling of the Sublime\nrests on the impulse towards self-preservation and on _fear_, _i.e._\non a pain, which not going so far as actually to derange the parts of\nthe body, produces movements which, since they purify the finer or\ngrosser vessels of dangerous or troublesome stoppages, are capable\nof exciting pleasant sensations; not indeed pleasure, but a kind of\nsatisfying horror, a certain tranquillity tinged with terror.\u201d[61] The\nBeautiful, which he founded on love (which he wishes to keep quite\nseparate from desire), he reduces to \u201cthe relaxing, slackening, and\nenervating of the fibres of the body, and a consequent weakening,\nlanguor, and exhaustion, a fainting, dissolving, and melting away for\nenjoyment.\u201d[62] And he confirms this explanation not only by cases in\nwhich the Imagination in combination with the Understanding can excite\nin us the feeling of the Beautiful or of the Sublime, but by cases in\nwhich it is combined with sensation.--As psychological observations,\nthese analyses of the phenomena of our mind are exceedingly beautiful,\nand afford rich material for the favourite investigations of empirical\nanthropology. It is also not to be denied that all representations\nin us, whether, objectively viewed, they are merely sensible or are\nquite intellectual, may yet subjectively be united to gratification\nor grief, however imperceptible either may be; because they all\naffect the feeling of life, and none of them, so far as it is a\nmodification of the subject, can be indifferent. And so, as Epicurus\nmaintained, all _gratification_ or _grief_ may ultimately be corporeal,\nwhether it arises from the representations of the Imagination or the\nUnderstanding; because life without a feeling of bodily organs would be\nmerely a consciousness of existence, without any feeling of well-being\nor the reverse, _i.e._ of the furthering or the checking of the vital\npowers. For the mind is by itself alone life (the principle of life),\nand hindrances or furtherances must be sought outside it and yet in\nthe man, consequently in union with his body.\nIf, however, we place the satisfaction in the object altogether in\nthe fact that it gratifies us by charm or emotion, we must not assume\nthat any _other_ man agrees with the aesthetical judgement which _we_\npass; for as to these each one rightly consults his own individual\nsensibility. But in that case all censorship of taste would disappear,\nexcept indeed the example afforded by the accidental agreement of\nothers in their judgements were regarded as _commanding_ our assent;\nand this principle we should probably resist, and should appeal to the\nnatural right of subjecting the judgement, which rests on the immediate\nfeeling of our own well-being, to our own sense and not to that of any\nother man.\nIf then the judgement of taste is not to be valid merely\n_egoistically_, but according to its inner nature,--_i.e._ on account\nof itself and not on account of the examples that others give of their\ntaste,--to be necessarily valid _pluralistically_, if we regard it\nas a judgement which may exact the adhesion of every one; then there\nmust lie at its basis some _a priori_ principle (whether objective or\nsubjective) to which we can never attain by seeking out the empirical\nlaws of mental changes. For these only enable us to know how we judge,\nbut do not prescribe to us how we ought to judge. They do not supply an\n_unconditioned_ command,[63] such as judgements of taste presuppose,\ninasmuch as they require that the satisfaction be _immediately_\nconnected with the representation. Thus the empirical exposition of\naesthetical judgements may be a beginning of a collection of materials\nfor a higher investigation; but a transcendental discussion of this\nfaculty is also possible, and is an essential part of the Critique of\nTaste. For if it had not _a priori_ principles, it could not possibly\npass sentence on the judgements of others, and it could not approve or\nblame them with any appearance of right.\nThe remaining part of the Analytic of the Aesthetical Judgement\ncontains first the\nDEDUCTION OF [PURE[64]] AESTHETICAL JUDGEMENTS\n\u00a7 30. _The Deduction of aesthetical judgements on the objects of nature\nmust not be directed to what we call Sublime in nature, but only to the\nBeautiful._\nThe claim of an aesthetical judgement to universal validity for every\nsubject requires, as a judgement resting on some _a priori_ principle,\na Deduction (or legitimatising of its pretensions) in addition to its\nExposition; if it is concerned with satisfaction or dissatisfaction\nin the _form of the Object_. Of this kind are judgements of taste\nabout the Beautiful in Nature. For in that case the purposiveness\nhas its ground in the Object and in its figure, although it does not\nindicate the reference of this to other objects according to concepts\n(for a cognitive judgement), but merely has to do in general with the\napprehension of this form, so far as it shows itself conformable in the\nmind to the _faculty_ of concepts and to that of their presentation\n(which is identical with that of apprehension). We can thus, in respect\nof the Beautiful in nature, suggest many questions touching the cause\nof this purposiveness of their forms, _e.g._ to explain why nature has\nscattered abroad beauty with such profusion, even in the depth of the\nocean, where the human eye (for which alone that purposiveness exists)\nbut seldom penetrates.\nBut the Sublime in nature--if we are passing upon it a pure aesthetical\njudgement, not mixed up with any concepts of perfection or objective\npurposiveness, in which case it would be a teleological judgement--may\nbe regarded as quite formless or devoid of figure, and yet as the\nobject of a pure satisfaction; and it may display a subjective\npurposiveness in the given representation. And we ask if, for an\naesthetical judgement of this kind,--over and above the Exposition\nof what is thought in it,--a Deduction also of its claim to any\n(subjective) _a priori_ principle may be demanded?\nTo which we may answer that the Sublime in nature is improperly so\ncalled, and that properly speaking the word should only be applied\nto a state of mind, or rather to its foundation in human nature. The\napprehension of an otherwise formless and unpurposive object gives\nmerely the occasion, through which we become conscious of such a state;\nthe object is thus _employed_ as subjectively purposive, but is not\njudged as such _in itself_ and on account of its form (it is, as it\nwere, a _species finalis accepta, non data_). Hence our Exposition of\njudgements concerning the Sublime in nature was at the same time their\nDeduction. For when we analysed the reflection of the Judgement in such\nacts, we found in them a purposive relation of the cognitive faculties,\nwhich must be ascribed ultimately to the faculty of purposes (the\nwill), and hence is itself purposive _a priori_. This then immediately\ninvolves the Deduction, _i.e._ the justification of the claim of such a\njudgement to universal and necessary validity.\nWe shall therefore only have to seek for the deduction of judgements\nof Taste, _i.e._ of judgements about the Beauty of natural things;\nwe shall thus treat satisfactorily the problem with which the whole\nfaculty of aesthetical Judgement is concerned.\n\u00a7 31. _Of the method of deduction of judgements of Taste_\nA Deduction, _i.e._ the guarantee of the legitimacy of a class\nof judgements, is only obligatory if the judgement lays claim to\nnecessity. This it does, if it demands even subjective universality or\nthe agreement of every one, although it is not a judgement of cognition\nbut only one of pleasure or pain in a given object; _i.e._ it assumes a\nsubjective purposiveness thoroughly valid for every one, which must not\nbe based on any concept of the thing, because the judgement is one of\ntaste.\nWe have before us in the latter case no cognitive judgement--neither a\ntheoretical one based on the concept of a _Nature_ in general formed\nby the Understanding, nor a (pure) practical one based on the Idea of\n_Freedom_, as given _a priori_ by Reason. Therefore we have to justify\n_a priori_ the validity neither of a judgement which represents what\na thing is, nor of one which prescribes that I ought to do something\nin order to produce it. We have merely to prove for the Judgement\ngenerally the _universal validity_ of a singular judgement that\nexpresses the subjective purposiveness of an empirical representation\nof the form of an object; in order to explain how it is possible that\na thing can please in the mere act of judging it (without sensation or\nconcept), and how the satisfaction of one man can be proclaimed as a\nrule for every other; just as the act of judging of an object for the\nsake of a _cognition_ in general has universal rules.\nIf now this universal validity is not to be based on any collecting of\nthe suffrages of others, or on any questioning of them as to the kind\nof sensations they have, but is to rest, as it were, on an autonomy of\nthe judging subject in respect of the feeling of pleasure (in the given\nrepresentation), _i.e._ on his own taste, and yet is not to be derived\nfrom concepts; then a judgement like this--such as the judgement of\ntaste is, in fact--has a twofold logical peculiarity. _First_, there is\nits _a priori_ universal validity, which is not a logical universality\nin accordance with concepts, but the universality of a singular\njudgement. _Secondly_, it has a necessity (which must always rest on\n_a priori_ grounds), which however does not depend on any _a priori_\ngrounds of proof, through the representation of which the assent that\nevery one concedes to the judgement of taste could be exacted.\nThe solution of these logical peculiarities, wherein a judgement\nof taste is different from all cognitive judgements--if we at the\noutset abstract from all content, viz. from the feeling of pleasure,\nand merely compare the aesthetical form with the form of objective\njudgements as logic prescribes it--is sufficient by itself for the\ndeduction of this singular faculty. We shall then represent and\nelucidate by examples these characteristic properties of taste.\n\u00a7 32. _First peculiarity of the judgement of Taste_\nThe judgement of taste determines its object in respect of satisfaction\n(in its beauty) with an accompanying claim for the assent of _every\none_, just as if it were objective.\nTo say that \u201cthis flower is beautiful\u201d is the same as to assert its\nproper claim to satisfy every one. By the pleasantness of its smell\nit has no such claim. A smell which one man enjoys gives another a\nheadache. Now what are we to presume from this except that beauty is\nto be regarded as a property of the flower itself, which does not\naccommodate itself to any diversity of persons or of their sensitive\norgans, but to which these must accommodate themselves if they are to\npass any judgement upon it? And yet this is not so. For a judgement\nof taste consists in calling a thing beautiful just because of that\ncharacteristic in respect of which it accommodates itself to our mode\nof apprehension.\nMoreover, it is required of every judgement which is to prove the\ntaste of the subject, that the subject shall judge by himself, without\nneeding to grope about empirically among the judgements of others, and\nacquaint himself previously as to their satisfaction or dissatisfaction\nwith the same object; thus his judgement should be pronounced _a\npriori_, and not be a mere imitation because the thing actually gives\nuniversal pleasure. One would think, however, that an _a priori_\njudgement must contain a concept of the Object, for the cognition of\nwhich it contains the principle; but the judgement of taste is not\nbased upon concepts at all, and is in general not a cognitive but an\naesthetical judgement.\nThus a young poet does not permit himself to be dissuaded from his\nconviction that his poem is beautiful, by the judgement of the public\nor of his friends; and if he gives ear to them he does so, not because\nhe now judges differently, but because, although (in regard to him)\nthe whole public has false taste, in his desire for applause he finds\nreason for accommodating himself to the common error (even against his\njudgement). It is only at a later time, when his Judgement has been\nsharpened by exercise, that he voluntarily departs from his former\njudgements; just as he proceeds with those of his judgements which rest\nupon Reason. Taste [merely][65] claims autonomy. To make the judgements\nof others the determining grounds of his own would be heteronomy.\nThat we, and rightly, recommend the works of the ancients as models\nand call their authors classical, thus forming among writers a kind\nof noble class who give laws to the people by their example, seems\nto indicate _a posteriori_ sources of taste, and to contradict the\nautonomy of taste in every subject. But we might just as well say\nthat the old mathematicians,--who are regarded up to the present day\nas supplying models not easily to be dispensed with for the supreme\nprofundity and elegance of their synthetical methods,--prove that our\nReason is only imitative, and that we have not the faculty of producing\nfrom it in combination with intuition rigid proofs by means of the\nconstruction of concepts.[66] There is no use of our powers, however\nfree, no use of Reason itself (which must create all its judgements\n_a priori_ from common sources) which would not give rise to faulty\nattempts, if every subject had always to begin anew from the rude basis\nof his natural state, and if others had not preceded him with their\nattempts. Not that these make mere imitators of those who come after\nthem, but rather by their procedure they put others on the track of\nseeking in themselves principles and so of pursuing their own course,\noften a better one. Even in religion--where certainly every one has\nto derive the rule of his conduct from himself, because he remains\nresponsible for it and cannot shift the blame of his transgressions\nupon others, whether his teachers or his predecessors--there is never\nas much accomplished by means of universal precepts, either obtained\nfrom priests or philosophers or got from oneself, as by means of\nan example of virtue or holiness which, exhibited in history, does\nnot dispense with the autonomy of virtue based on the proper and\noriginal Idea of morality (_a priori_), or change it into a mechanical\nimitation. _Following_, involving something precedent, not \u201cimitation,\u201d\nis the right expression for all influence that the products of an\nexemplary author may have upon others. And this only means that we\ndraw from the same sources as our predecessor did, and learn from him\nonly the way to avail ourselves of them. But of all faculties and\ntalents Taste, because its judgement is not determinable by concepts\nand precepts, is just that one which most needs examples of what has\nin the progress of culture received the longest approval; that it may\nnot become again uncivilised and return to the crudeness of its first\nessays.\n\u00a7 33. _Second peculiarity of the judgement of Taste_\nThe judgement of taste is not determinable by grounds of proof, just as\nif it were merely _subjective_.\nIf a man, _in the first place_, does not find a building, a prospect,\nor a poem beautiful, a hundred voices all highly praising it will not\nforce his inmost agreement. He may indeed feign that it pleases him in\norder that he may not be regarded as devoid of taste; he may even begin\nto doubt whether he has formed his taste on a knowledge of a sufficient\nnumber of objects of a certain kind (just as one, who believes that\nhe recognises in the distance as a forest, something which all others\nregard as a town, doubts the judgement of his own sight). But he\nclearly sees that the agreement of others gives no valid proof of the\njudgement about beauty. Others might perhaps see and observe for him;\nand what many have seen in one way, although he believes that he has\nseen it differently, might serve him as an adequate ground of proof\nof a theoretical and consequently logical judgement. But that a thing\nhas pleased others could never serve as the basis of an aesthetical\njudgement. A judgement of others which is unfavourable to ours may\nindeed rightly make us scrutinise our own with care, but it can never\nconvince us of its incorrectness. There is therefore no empirical\n_ground of proof_ which would force a judgement of taste upon any one.\nStill less, _in the second place_, can an _a priori_ proof determine\naccording to definite rules a judgement about beauty. If a man reads\nme a poem of his or brings me to a play, which does not after all suit\nmy taste, he may bring forward in proof of the beauty of his poem\n_Batteux_[67] or _Lessing_ or still more ancient and famous critics\nof taste, and all the rules laid down by them; certain passages which\ndisplease me may agree very well with rules of beauty (as they have\nbeen put forth by these writers and are universally recognised): but\nI stop my ears, I will listen to no arguments and no reasoning; and I\nwill rather assume that these rules of the critics are false, or at\nleast that they do not apply to the case in question, than admit that\nmy judgement should be determined by grounds of proof _a priori_. For\nit is to be a judgement of Taste and not of Understanding or Reason.\nIt seems that this is one of the chief reasons why this aesthetical\nfaculty of judgement has been given the name of Taste. For though a\nman enumerate to me all the ingredients of a dish, and remark that\neach is separately pleasant to me and further extol with justice the\nwholesomeness of this particular food--yet am I deaf to all these\nreasons; I try the dish with _my_ tongue and my palate, and thereafter\n(and not according to universal principles) do I pass my judgement.\nIn fact the judgement of Taste always takes the form of a singular\njudgement about an Object. The Understanding can form a universal\njudgement by comparing the Object in point of the satisfaction it\naffords with the judgement of others upon it: _e.g._ \u201call tulips are\nbeautiful.\u201d But then this is not a judgement of taste but a logical\njudgement, which takes the relation of an Object to taste as the\npredicate of things of a certain species. That judgement, however, in\nwhich I find an individual given tulip beautiful, _i.e._ in which\nI find my satisfaction in it to be universally valid, is alone a\njudgement of taste. Its peculiarity consists in the fact that, although\nit has merely subjective validity, it claims the assent of _all_\nsubjects, exactly as it would do if it were an objective judgement\nresting on grounds of knowledge, that could be established by a proof.\n\u00a7 34. _There is no objective principle of Taste possible_\nBy a principle of taste I mean a principle under the condition of\nwhich we could subsume the concept of an object and thus infer by\nmeans of a syllogism that the object is beautiful. But that is\nabsolutely impossible. For I must feel the pleasure immediately in the\nrepresentation of the object, and of that I can be persuaded by no\ngrounds of proof whatever. Although, as _Hume_ says,[68] all critics\ncan reason more plausibly than cooks, yet the same fate awaits them.\nThey cannot expect the determining ground of their judgement [to be\nderived] from the force of the proofs, but only from the reflection\nof the subject upon its own proper state (of pleasure or pain), all\nprecepts and rules being rejected.\nBut although critics can and ought to pursue their reasonings so that\nour judgements of taste may be corrected and extended, it is not with\na view to set forth the determining ground of this kind of aesthetical\njudgements in a universally applicable formula, which is impossible;\nbut rather to investigate the cognitive faculties and their exercise in\nthese judgements, and to explain by examples the reciprocal subjective\npurposiveness, the form of which, as has been shown above, in a given\nrepresentation, constitutes the beauty of the object. Therefore the\nCritique of Taste is only subjective as regards the representation\nthrough which an Object is given to us; viz. it is the art or science\nof reducing to rules the reciprocal relation between the Understanding\nand the Imagination in the given representation (without reference\nto any preceding sensation or concept). That is, it is the art or\nscience of reducing to rules their accordance or discordance, and of\ndetermining them with regard to their conditions. It is an _art_, if\nit only shows this by examples; it is a _science_ if it derives the\npossibility of such judgements from the nature of these faculties,\nas cognitive faculties in general. We have here, in Transcendental\nCriticism, only to do with the latter. It should develop and justify\nthe subjective principle of taste, as an _a priori_ principle of\nthe Judgement. This Critique, as an art, merely seeks to apply, in\nthe judging of objects, the physiological (here psychological), and\ntherefore empirical rules, according to which taste actually proceeds\n(without taking any account of their possibility); and it criticises\nthe products of beautiful art just as, regarded as a science, it\ncriticises the faculty by which they are judged.\n\u00a7 35. _The principle of Taste is the subjective principle of Judgement\nin general_\nThe judgement of taste is distinguished from a logical judgement in\nthis, that the latter subsumes a representation under the concept\nof the Object, while the former does not subsume it under any\nconcept; because otherwise the necessary universal agreement [in\nthese judgements] would be capable of being enforced by proofs.\nNevertheless it is like the latter in this, that it claims universality\nand necessity, though not according to concepts of the Object, and\nconsequently a merely subjective necessity. Now, because the concepts\nin a judgement constitute its content (what belongs to the cognition\nof the Object), but the judgement of taste is not determinable by\nconcepts, it is based only on the subjective formal condition of a\njudgement in general. The subjective condition of all judgements is\nthe faculty of Judgement itself. This when used with reference to a\nrepresentation by which an object is given, requires the accordance\nof two representative powers: viz. Imagination (for the intuition and\ncomprehension of the manifold) and Understanding (for the concept as\na representation of the unity of this comprehension). Now because no\nconcept of the Object lies here at the basis of the judgement, it can\nonly consist in the subsumption of the Imagination itself (in the case\nof a representation by which an object is given) under the conditions\nthat the Understanding requires to pass from intuition to concepts.\nThat is, because the freedom of the Imagination consists in the fact\nthat it schematises without any concept, the judgement of taste must\nrest on a mere sensation of the reciprocal activity of the Imagination\nin its _freedom_ and the Understanding with its _conformity to law_.\nIt must therefore rest on a feeling, which makes us judge the object\nby the purposiveness of the representation (by which an object is\ngiven) in respect of the furtherance of the cognitive faculty in its\nfree play. Taste, then, as subjective Judgement, contains a principle\nof subsumption, not of intuitions under concepts, but of the _faculty_\nof intuitions or presentations (_i.e._ the Imagination) under the\n_faculty_ of the concepts (_i.e._ the Understanding); so far as the\nformer _in its freedom_ harmonises with the latter _in its conformity\nto law_.\nIn order to discover this ground of legitimacy by a Deduction of the\njudgements of taste we can only take as a clue the formal peculiarities\nof this kind of judgements, and consequently can only consider their\nlogical form.\n\u00a7 36. _Of the problem of a Deduction of judgements of Taste_\nThe concept of an Object in general can immediately be combined with\nthe perception of an object, containing its empirical predicates, so\nas to form a cognitive judgement; and it is thus that a judgement\nof experience is produced.[69] At the basis of this lie _a priori_\nconcepts of the synthetical unity of the manifold of intuition, by\nwhich the manifold is thought as the determination of an Object. These\nconcepts (the Categories) require a Deduction, which is given in the\nCritique of pure Reason; and by it we can get the solution of the\nproblem, how are synthetical _a priori_ cognitive judgements possible?\nThis problem concerns then the _a priori_ principles of the pure\nUnderstanding and its theoretical judgements.\nBut with a perception there can also be combined a feeling of pleasure\n(or pain) and a satisfaction, that accompanies the representation\nof the Object and serves instead of its predicate; thus there can\nresult an aesthetical non-cognitive judgement. At the basis of\nsuch a judgement--if it is not a mere judgement of sensation but a\nformal judgement of reflection, which imputes the same satisfaction\nnecessarily to every one,--must lie some _a priori_ principle; which\nmay be merely subjective (if an objective one should prove impossible\nfor judgements of this kind), but also as such may need a Deduction,\nthat we may thereby comprehend how an aesthetical judgement can lay\nclaim to necessity. On this is founded the problem with which we are\nnow occupied, how are judgements of taste possible? This problem\nthen has to do with the _a priori_ principles of the pure faculty of\nJudgement in _aesthetical_ judgements; _i.e._ judgements in which it\nhas not (as in theoretical ones) merely to subsume under objective\nconcepts of Understanding, and in which it is subject to a law, but in\nwhich it is, itself, subjectively, both object and law.\nThis problem then may be thus represented: how is a judgement possible,\nin which merely from _our own_ feeling of pleasure in an object,\nindependently of its concept, we judge that this pleasure attaches to\nthe representation of the same Object _in every other subject_, and\nthat _a priori_ without waiting for the accordance of others?\nIt is easy to see that judgements of taste are synthetical, because\nthey go beyond the concept and even beyond the intuition of the\nObject, and add to that intuition as predicate something that is not a\ncognition, viz. a feeling of pleasure (or pain). Although the predicate\n(of the _personal_ pleasure bound up with the representation) is\nempirical, nevertheless, as concerns the required assent of _every one_\nthe judgements are _a priori_, or desire to be regarded as such; and\nthis is already involved in the expressions of this claim. Thus this\nproblem of the Critique of Judgement belongs to the general problem of\ntranscendental philosophy, how are synthetical _a priori_ judgements\npossible?\n\u00a7 37. _What is properly asserted a priori of an object in a judgement\nof Taste_\nThat the representation of an object is immediately bound up with\npleasure can only be internally perceived, and if we did not wish to\nindicate anything more than this it would give a merely empirical\njudgement. For I cannot combine a definite feeling (of pleasure or\npain) with any representation except where there is at bottom an _a\npriori_ principle in the Reason determining the Will. In that case the\npleasure (in the moral feeling) is the consequence of the principle,\nbut cannot be compared with the pleasure in taste, because it requires\na definite concept of a law; and the latter pleasure, on the contrary,\nmust be bound up with the mere act of judging, prior to all concepts.\nHence also all judgements of taste are singular judgements, because\nthey do not combine their predicate of satisfaction with a concept,\nbut with a given individual empirical representation.\nAnd so it is not the pleasure, but the _universal validity of this\npleasure_, perceived as mentally bound up with the mere judgement upon\nan object, which is represented _a priori_ in a judgement of taste as\na universal rule for the Judgement and valid for every one. It is an\nempirical judgement [to say] that I perceive and judge an object with\npleasure. But it is an _a priori_ judgement [to say] that I find it\nbeautiful, _i.e._ I attribute this satisfaction necessarily to every\none.\n\u00a7 38. _Deduction of judgements of Taste_\nIf it be admitted that in a pure judgement of taste the satisfaction\nin the object is combined with the mere act of judging its form, it is\nnothing else than its subjective purposiveness for the Judgement which\nwe feel to be mentally combined with the representation of the object.\nThe Judgement, as regards the formal rules of its action, apart from\nall matter (whether sensation or concept), can only be directed to the\nsubjective conditions of its employment in general (it is applied[70]\nneither to a particular mode of sense nor to a particular concept of\nthe Understanding); and consequently to that subjective [element] which\nwe can presuppose in all men (as requisite for possible cognition in\ngeneral). Thus the agreement of a representation with these conditions\nof the Judgement must be capable of being assumed as valid _a priori_\nfor every one. _I.e._ we may rightly impute to every one the pleasure\nor the subjective purposiveness of the representation for the relation\nbetween the cognitive faculties in the act of judging a sensible object\nin general.[71]\n_Remark_\nThis Deduction is thus easy, because it has no need to justify the\nobjective reality of any concept, for Beauty is not a concept of the\nObject and the judgement of taste is not cognitive. It only maintains\nthat we are justified in presupposing universally in every man those\nsubjective conditions of the Judgement which we find in ourselves; and\nfurther, that we have rightly subsumed the given Object under these\nconditions. The latter has indeed unavoidable difficulties which do\nnot beset the logical Judgement. There we subsume under concepts,\nbut in the aesthetical Judgement under a merely sensible relation\nbetween the Imagination and Understanding mutually harmonising in\nthe representation of the form of the Object,--in which case the\nsubsumption may easily be fallacious. Yet the legitimacy of the\nclaim of the Judgement in counting upon universal assent is not thus\nannulled; it reduces itself merely to the correctness of the principle\nof judging validly for every one from subjective grounds. For as to\nthe difficulty or doubt concerning the correctness of the subsumption\nunder that principle, it makes the legitimacy of the claim of an\naesthetical judgement in general to such validity and the principle\nof the same, as little doubtful, as the like faulty (though neither\nso commonly nor readily faulty) subsumption of the logical Judgement\nunder its principle can make the latter, an objective principle,\ndoubtful. But if the question were to be, how is it possible to assume\nnature _a priori_ to be a complex of objects of taste? this problem\nhas reference to Teleology, because it must be regarded as a purpose\nof nature essentially belonging to its concept to exhibit forms that\nare purposive for our Judgement. But the correctness of this latter\nassumption is very doubtful, whereas the efficacy of natural beauties\nis patent to experience.\n\u00a7 39. _Of the communicability of a Sensation_\nIf sensation, as the real in perception, is related to knowledge, it\nis called sensation of the senses; and its specific quality may be\nrepresented as generally communicable in a uniform way, if we assume\nthat every one has senses like our own. But this cannot at all be\npresupposed of any single sensation. To a man who is deficient in the\nsense of smell, this kind of sensation cannot be communicated; and\neven if it is not wholly deficient, we cannot be certain that he gets\nexactly the same sensation from a flower that we have. But even more\nmust we represent men as differing in respect of the _pleasantness_\nor _unpleasantness_ involved in the sensation from the same object of\nsense; and it is absolutely not to be required that every man should\ntake pleasure in the same objects. Pleasure of this kind, because it\ncomes into the mind through the senses, in respect of which therefore\nwe are passive, we may call the pleasure of _enjoyment_.\nSatisfaction in an action because of its moral character is on the\nother hand not the pleasure of enjoyment, but of spontaneity and its\naccordance with the Idea of its destination. But this feeling, called\nmoral, requires concepts, and presents not free purposiveness, but\npurposiveness that is conformable to law; it therefore admits of being\nuniversally communicated only by means of Reason, and, if the pleasure\nis to be homogeneous for every one, by very definite practical concepts\nof Reason.\nPleasure in the Sublime in nature, regarded as a pleasure of rational\ncontemplation, also makes claim to universal participation; but\nit presupposes, besides, a different feeling, viz. that of our\nsupersensible destination, which, however obscurely, has a moral\nfoundation. But that other men will take account of it, and will find\na satisfaction in the consideration of the wild greatness of nature\n(that certainly cannot be ascribed to its aspect, which is rather\nterrifying), I am not absolutely justified in supposing. Nevertheless,\nin consideration of the fact that on every suitable occasion regard\nshould be had to these moral dispositions, I can impute such\nsatisfaction to every man, but only by means of the moral law which on\nits side again is based on concepts of Reason.\nOn the contrary, pleasure in the Beautiful is neither a pleasure\nof enjoyment nor of a law-abiding activity, nor even of rational\ncontemplation in accordance with Ideas, but of mere reflection. Without\nhaving as rule any purpose or fundamental proposition, this pleasure\naccompanies the ordinary apprehension of an object by the Imagination,\nas faculty of intuition, in relation with the Understanding, as faculty\nof concepts, by means of a procedure of the Judgement which it must\nalso exercise on behalf of the commonest experience; only that in\nthe latter case it is in order to perceive an empirical objective\nconcept, in the former case (in aesthetical judgements) merely to\nperceive the accordance of the representation with the harmonious\n(subjectively purposive) activity of both cognitive faculties in their\nfreedom, _i.e._ to feel with pleasure the mental state produced by\nthe representation. This pleasure must necessarily depend for every\none on the same conditions, for they are subjective conditions of the\npossibility of a cognition in general; and the proportion between\nthese cognitive faculties requisite for Taste is also requisite for\nthat ordinary sound Understanding which we have to presuppose in\nevery one. Therefore he who judges with taste (if only he does not go\nastray in this act of consciousness and mistake matter for form or\ncharm for beauty) may impute to every one subjective purposiveness,\n_i.e._ his satisfaction in the Object, and may assume his feeling to be\nuniversally communicable and that without the mediation of concepts.\n\u00a7 40. _Of Taste as a kind of_ sensus communis\nWe often give to the Judgement, if we are considering the result rather\nthan the act of its reflection, the name of a sense, and we speak of\na sense of truth, or of a sense of decorum, of justice, etc. And yet\nwe know, or at least we ought to know, that these concepts cannot\nhave their place in Sense, and further, that Sense has not the least\ncapacity for expressing universal rules; but that no representation\nof truth, fitness, beauty, or justice, and so forth, could come into\nour thoughts if we could not rise beyond Sense to higher faculties\nof cognition. _The common Understanding of men_, which, as the mere\nsound (not yet cultivated) Understanding, we regard as the least to\nbe expected from any one claiming the name of man, has therefore the\ndoubtful honour of being given the name of common sense (_sensus\ncommunis_); and in such a way that by the name _common_ (not merely\nin our language, where the word actually has a double signification,\nbut in many others) we understand _vulgar_, that which is everywhere\nmet with, the possession of which indicates absolutely no merit or\nsuperiority.\nBut under the _sensus communis_ we must include the Idea of a\n_communal_ sense, _i.e._ of a faculty of judgement, which in its\nreflection takes account (_a priori_) of the mode of representation\nof all other men in thought; in order _as it were_ to compare its\njudgement with the collective Reason of humanity, and thus to escape\nthe illusion arising from the private conditions that could be so\neasily taken for objective, which would injuriously affect the\njudgement. This is done by comparing our judgement with the possible\nrather than the actual judgements of others, and by putting ourselves\nin the place of any other man, by abstracting from the limitations\nwhich contingently attach to our own judgement. This, again, is\nbrought about by leaving aside as much as possible the matter of our\nrepresentative state, _i.e._ sensation, and simply having respect to\nthe formal peculiarities of our representation or representative state.\nNow this operation of reflection seems perhaps too artificial to be\nattributed to the faculty called _common_ sense; but it only appears\nso, when expressed in abstract formulae. In itself there is nothing\nmore natural than to abstract from charm or emotion if we are seeking a\njudgement that is to serve as a universal rule.\nThe following Maxims of common human Understanding do not properly\ncome in here, as parts of the Critique of Taste; but yet they may\nserve to elucidate its fundamental propositions. They are: 1\u00b0 to\nthink for oneself; 2\u00b0 to put ourselves in thought in the place of\nevery one else; 3\u00b0 always to think consistently. The first is the\nmaxim of _unprejudiced_ thought; the second of _enlarged_ thought;\nthe third of _consecutive_ thought.[72] The first is the maxim of a\nReason never _passive_. The tendency to such passivity, and therefore\nto heteronomy of the Reason, is called _prejudice_; and the greatest\nprejudice of all is to represent nature as not subject to the rules\nthat the Understanding places at its basis by means of its own\nessential law, _i.e._ is _superstition_. Deliverance from superstition\nis called _enlightenment_;[73] because although this name belongs to\ndeliverance from prejudices in general, yet superstition specially\n(_in sensu eminenti_) deserves to be called a prejudice. For the\nblindness in which superstition places us, which it even imposes on\nus as an obligation, makes the need of being guided by others, and\nthe consequent passive state of our Reason, peculiarly noticeable. As\nregards the second maxim of the mind, we are otherwise wont to call\nhim limited (_born\u00e9_, the opposite of _enlarged_) whose talents attain\nto no great use (especially as regards intensity). But here we are not\nspeaking of the faculty of cognition, but of the _mode of thought_\nwhich makes a purposive use thereof. However small may be the area\nor the degree to which a man\u2019s natural gifts reach, yet it indicates\na man of _enlarged thought_ if he disregards the subjective private\nconditions of his own judgement, by which so many others are confined,\nand reflects upon it from a _universal standpoint_ (which he can only\ndetermine by placing himself at the standpoint of others). The third\nmaxim, viz. that of _consecutive_ thought, is the most difficult to\nattain, and can only be attained by the combination of both the former,\nand after the constant observance of them has grown into a habit. We\nmay say that the first of these maxims is the maxim of Understanding,\nthe second of Judgement, and the third of Reason.\nI take up again the threads interrupted by this digression, and I say\nthat Taste can be called _sensus communis_ with more justice than sound\nUnderstanding can; and that the aesthetical Judgement rather than the\nintellectual may bear the name of a communal sense,[74] if we are\nwilling to use the word \u201csense\u201d of an effect of mere reflection upon\nthe mind: for then we understand by sense the feeling of pleasure. We\ncould even define Taste as the faculty of judging of that which makes\n_universally communicable_, without the mediation of a concept, our\nfeeling in a given representation.\nThe skill that men have in communicating their thoughts requires also\na relation between the Imagination and the Understanding in order to\nassociate intuitions with concepts, and concepts again with those\nconcepts, which then combine in a cognition. But in that case the\nagreement of the two mental powers is _according to law_, under the\nconstraint of definite concepts. Only where the Imagination in its\nfreedom awakens the Understanding, and is put by it into regular play\nwithout the aid of concepts, does the representation communicate itself\nnot as a thought but as an internal feeling of a purposive state of the\nmind.\nTaste is then the faculty of judging _a priori_ of the communicability\nof feelings that are bound up with a given representation (without the\nmediation of a concept).\nIf we could assume that the mere universal communicability of a feeling\nmust carry in itself an interest for us with it (which, however, we are\nnot justified in concluding from the character of a merely reflective\nJudgement), we should be able to explain why the feeling in the\njudgement of taste comes to be imputed to every one, so to speak, as a\nduty.\n\u00a7 41. _Of the empirical interest in the Beautiful_\nThat the judgement of taste by which something is declared beautiful\nmust have no interest _as its determining ground_ has been sufficiently\nestablished above. But it does not follow that after it has been\ngiven as a pure aesthetical judgement, no interest can be combined\nwith it. This combination, however, can only be indirect, _i.e._ taste\nmust first of all be represented as combined with something else, in\norder that we may unite with the satisfaction of mere reflection upon\nan object a _pleasure in its existence_ (as that wherein all interest\nconsists). For here also in aesthetical judgements what we say in\ncognitive judgements (of things in general) is valid; _a posse ad esse\nnon valet consequentia_. This something else may be empirical, viz. an\ninclination proper to human nature, or intellectual, as the property\nof the Will of being capable of _a priori_ determination by Reason.\nBoth these involve a satisfaction in the presence of an Object, and so\ncan lay the foundation for an interest in what has by itself pleased\nwithout reference to any interest whatever.\nEmpirically the Beautiful interests only in _society_. If we admit\nthe impulse to society as natural to man, and his fitness for it, and\nhis propension towards it, _i.e._ _sociability_, as a requisite for\nman as a being destined for society, and so as a property belonging\nto _humanity_, we cannot escape from regarding taste as a faculty for\njudging everything in respect of which we can communicate our _feeling_\nto all other men, and so as a means of furthering that which every\none\u2019s natural inclination desires.\nA man abandoned by himself on a desert island would adorn neither his\nhut nor his person; nor would he seek for flowers, still less would he\nplant them, in order to adorn himself therewith. It is only in society\nthat it occurs to him to be not merely a man, but a refined man after\nhis kind (the beginning of civilisation). For such do we judge him to\nbe who is both inclined and apt to communicate his pleasure to others,\nand who is not contented with an Object if he cannot feel satisfaction\nin it in common with others. Again, every one expects and requires from\nevery one else this reference to universal communication [of pleasure],\nas it were from an original compact dictated by humanity itself. Thus,\ndoubtless, in the beginning only those things which attracted the\nsenses, _e.g._ colours for painting oneself (roucou among the Carabs\nand cinnabar among the Iroquois), flowers, mussel shells, beautiful\nfeathers, etc.,--but in time beautiful forms also (_e.g._ in their\ncanoes, and clothes, etc.), which bring with them no gratification, or\nsatisfaction of enjoyment--were important in society, and were combined\nwith great interest. Until at last civilisation, having reached its\nhighest point, makes out of this almost the main business of refined\ninclination; and sensations are only regarded as of worth in so far as\nthey can be universally communicated. Here, although the pleasure which\nevery one has in such an object is inconsiderable and in itself without\nany marked interest, yet the Idea of its universal communicability\nincreases its worth in an almost infinite degree.\nBut this interest that indirectly attaches to the Beautiful through\nour inclination to society, and consequently is empirical, is of no\nimportance for us here; because we have only to look to what may have\na reference, although only indirectly, to the judgement of taste _a\npriori_. For if even in this form an interest bound up therewith should\ndiscover itself, taste would discover a transition of our judging\nfaculty from sense-enjoyment to moral feeling; and so not only would\nwe be the better guided in employing taste purposively, but there\nwould be thus presented a link in the chain of the human faculties _a\npriori_, on which all legislation must depend. We can only say thus\nmuch about the empirical interest in objects of taste and in taste\nitself. Since it is subservient to inclination, however refined the\nlatter may be, it may easily be confounded with all the inclinations\nand passions, which attain their greatest variety and highest degree in\nsociety; and the interest in the Beautiful, if it is grounded thereon,\ncan only furnish a very ambiguous transition from the Pleasant to the\nGood. But whether this can or cannot be furthered by taste, taken in\nits purity, is what we now have to investigate.\n\u00a7 42. _Of the intellectual interest in the Beautiful_\nWith the best intentions those persons who refer all activities, to\nwhich their inner natural dispositions impel men, to the final purpose\nof humanity, viz. the morally good, have regarded the taking an\ninterest in the Beautiful in general as a mark of good moral character.\nBut it is not without reason that they have been contradicted by others\nwho rely on experience; for this shows that connoisseurs in taste,\nnot only often but generally, are given up to idle, capricious, and\nmischievous passions, and that they could perhaps make less claim than\nothers to any pre-eminent attachment to moral principles. Thus it would\nseem that the feeling for the Beautiful is not only (as actually is\nthe case) specifically different from the Moral feeling; but that the\ninterest which can be bound up with it is hardly compatible with moral\ninterest, and certainly has no inner affinity therewith.\nNow I admit at once that the interest in the _Beautiful of Art_ (under\nwhich I include the artificial use of natural beauties for adornment\nand so for vanity) furnishes no proof whatever of a disposition\nattached to the morally good or even inclined thereto. But on the\nother hand, I maintain that to take an _immediate interest_ in the\nBeauty of Nature (not merely to have taste in judging it) is always\na mark of a good soul; and that when this interest is habitual it at\nleast indicates a frame of mind favourable to the moral feeling, if it\nis voluntarily bound up with the _contemplation of nature_. It is to\nbe remembered, however, that I here speak strictly of the beautiful\n_forms_ of Nature, and I set aside the _charms_, that she is wont to\ncombine so abundantly with them; because, though the interest in the\nlatter is indeed immediate, it is only empirical.\nHe who by himself (and without any design of communicating his\nobservations to others) regards the beautiful figure of a wild flower,\na bird, an insect, etc., with admiration and love--who would not\nwillingly miss it in Nature, although it may bring him some hurt, who\nstill less wants any advantage from it--_he_ takes an immediate and\nalso an intellectual interest in the beauty of Nature. _I.e._ it is not\nmerely the form of the product of nature which pleases him, but its\nvery presence pleases him, the charms of sense having no share in this\npleasure and no purpose whatever being combined with it.\nBut it is noteworthy that if we secretly deceived this lover of the\nbeautiful by planting in the ground artificial flowers (which can be\nmanufactured exactly like natural ones), or by placing artificially\ncarved birds on the boughs of trees, and he discovered the deceit, the\nimmediate interest that he previously took in them would disappear\nat once; though, perhaps, a different interest, viz. the interest of\nvanity in adorning his chamber with them for the eyes of others, would\ntake its place. This thought then must accompany our intuition and\nreflection on beauty, viz. that nature has produced it; and on this\nalone is based the immediate interest that we take in it. Otherwise,\nthere remains a mere judgement of taste, either devoid of all interest,\nor bound up with a mediate interest, viz. in that it has reference to\nsociety; which latter [interest] furnishes no certain indications of a\nmorally good disposition.\nThis superiority of natural to artificial beauty in that it alone\narouses an immediate interest, although as regards form the first\nmay be surpassed by the second, harmonises with the refined and\nwell-grounded habit of thought of all men who have cultivated their\nmoral feeling. If a man who has taste enough to judge of the products\nof beautiful Art with the greatest accuracy and refinement willingly\nleaves a chamber where are to be found those beauties that minister to\nvanity or to any social joys, and turns to the beautiful in Nature in\norder to find, as it were, delight for his spirit in a train of thought\nthat he can never completely evolve, we will regard this choice of his\nwith veneration, and attribute to him a beautiful soul, to which no\nconnoisseur or lover [of Art] can lay claim on account of the interest\nhe takes in his [artistic] objects.--What now is the difference in\nour estimation of these two different kinds of Objects, which in the\njudgement of mere taste it is hard to compare in point of superiority?\nWe have a faculty of mere aesthetical Judgement by which we judge forms\nwithout the aid of concepts, and find a satisfaction in this mere act\nof judgement; this we make into a rule for every one, without this\njudgement either being based on or producing any interest.--On the\nother hand, we have also a faculty of intellectual Judgement which\ndetermines an _a priori_ satisfaction for the mere forms of practical\nmaxims (so far as they are in themselves qualified for universal\nlegislation); this we make into a law for every one, without our\njudgement being based on any interest whatever, _though in this case\nit produces such an interest_. The pleasure or pain in the former\njudgement is called that of taste, in the latter, that of moral feeling.\nBut it also interests Reason that the Ideas (for which in moral feeling\nit arouses an immediate interest) should have objective reality; _i.e._\nthat nature should at least show a trace or give an indication that\nit contains in itself some ground for assuming a regular agreement of\nits products with our entirely disinterested satisfaction (which we\nrecognise _a priori_ as a law for every one, without being able to base\nit upon proofs). Hence Reason must take an interest in every expression\non the part of nature of an agreement of this kind. Consequently, the\nmind cannot ponder upon the beauty of _Nature_ without finding itself\nat the same time interested therein. But this interest is akin to\nmoral, and he who takes such an interest in the beauties of nature\ncan do so only in so far as he previously has firmly established his\ninterest in the morally good. If, therefore, the beauty of Nature\ninterests a man immediately we have reason for attributing to him, at\nleast, a basis for a good moral disposition.\nIt will be said that this account of aesthetical judgements, as akin\nto the moral feeling, seems far too studied to be regarded as the\ntrue interpretation of that cipher through which Nature speaks to us\nfiguratively in her beautiful forms. However, in the first place,\nthis immediate interest in the beautiful is actually not common; but\nis peculiar to those whose mental disposition either has already been\ncultivated in the direction of the good or is eminently susceptible\nof such cultivation. In that case the analogy between the pure\njudgement of taste which, independently of any interest, causes us to\nfeel a satisfaction, and also represents it _a priori_ as suitable\nto humanity in general, and the moral judgement that does the same\nthing from concepts without any clear, subtle, and premeditated\nreflection--this analogy leads to a similar immediate interest in the\nobjects of the former as in those of the latter; only that in the\none case the interest is free, in the other it is based on objective\nlaws. To this is to be added our admiration for Nature, which displays\nitself in its beautiful products as Art, not merely by chance, but\nas it were designedly, in accordance with a regular arrangement, and\nas purposiveness without purpose. This latter, as we never meet with\nit outside ourselves, we naturally seek in ourselves; and, in fact,\nin that which constitutes the ultimate purpose of our being, viz.\nour moral destination. (Of this question as to the ground of the\npossibility of such natural purposiveness we shall first speak in the\nTeleology.)\nIt is easy to explain why the satisfaction in the pure aesthetical\njudgement in the case of beautiful Art is not combined with an\nimmediate interest as it is in the case of beautiful Nature. For the\nformer is either such an imitation of the latter that it reaches the\npoint of deception and then produces the same effect as natural beauty\n(for which it is taken); or it is an art obviously directed designedly\nto our satisfaction. In the latter case the satisfaction in the product\nwould, it is true, be brought about immediately by taste, but it would\nbe only a mediate interest in the cause lying at its root, viz. an art\nthat can only interest by means of its purpose and never in itself.\nIt will, perhaps, be said that this is also the case, if an Object\nof nature interests us by its beauty only so far as it is associated\nwith a moral Idea. But it is not the Object itself which immediately\ninterests us, but its character in virtue of which it is qualified for\nsuch association, which therefore essentially belongs to it.\nThe charms in beautiful Nature, which are so often found, as it\nwere, blended with beautiful forms, may be referred to modifications\neither of light (colours) or of sound (tones). For these are the only\nsensations that imply not merely a sensible feeling but also reflection\nupon the form of these modifications of Sense; and thus they involve\nin themselves as it were a language by which nature speaks to us,\nwhich thus seems to have a higher sense. Thus the white colour of\nlilies seems to determine the mind to Ideas of innocence; and the seven\ncolours in order from the red to the violet seem to suggest the Ideas\nof (1) Sublimity, (2) Intrepidity, (3) Candour, (4) Friendliness, (5)\nModesty, (6) Constancy, (7) Tenderness. The song of birds proclaims\ngladsomeness and contentment with existence. At least so we interpret\nnature, whether it have this design or not. But the interest which\nwe here take in beauty has only to do with the beauty of Nature; it\nvanishes altogether as soon as we notice that we are deceived and\nthat it is only Art--vanishes so completely that taste can no longer\nfind the thing beautiful or sight find it charming. What is more\nhighly praised by poets than the bewitching and beautiful note of the\nnightingale in a lonely copse on a still summer evening by the soft\nlight of the moon? And yet we have instances of a merry host, where no\nsuch songster was to be found, deceiving to their great contentment\nthe guests who were staying with him to enjoy the country air, by\nhiding in a bush a mischievous boy who knew how to produce this sound\nexactly like nature (by means of a reed or a tube in his mouth). But\nas soon as we are aware that it is a cheat, no one will remain long\nlistening to the song which before was counted so charming. And it is\njust the same with the songs of all other birds. It must be Nature or\nbe regarded as Nature, if we are to take an immediate _interest_ in the\nBeautiful as such; and still more is this the case if we can require\nthat others should take an interest in it too. This happens as a matter\nof fact when we regard as coarse and ignoble the mental attitude of\nthose persons who have no _feeling_ for beautiful Nature (for thus we\ndescribe a susceptibility to interest in its contemplation), and who\nconfine themselves to eating and drinking--to the mere enjoyments of\nsense.\n\u00a7 43. _Of Art in general_\n(1). _Art_ is distinguished from Nature, as doing (_facere_) is\ndistinguished from acting or working generally (_agere_), and as the\nproduct or result of the former is distinguished as _work_ (_opus_)\nfrom the working (_effectus_) of the latter.\nBy right we ought only to describe as Art, production through freedom,\n_i.e._ through a will that places Reason at the basis of its actions.\nFor although we like to call the product of bees (regularly built\ncells of wax) a work of art, this is only by way of analogy: as soon\nas we feel that this work of theirs is based on no proper rational\ndeliberation, we say that it is a product of Nature (of instinct), and\nas Art only ascribe it to their Creator.\nIf, as sometimes happens, in searching through a bog we come upon a bit\nof shaped wood, we do not say: this is a product of Nature, but, of\nArt. Its producing cause has conceived a purpose to which the bit of\nwood owes its form. Elsewhere too we should see art in everything which\nis made so that a representation of it in its cause must have preceded\nits actuality (as even in the case of the bees), though the effect\ncould not have been _thought_ by the cause. But if we call anything\nabsolutely a work of art in order to distinguish it from a natural\neffect, we always understand by that a work of man.\n(2). _Art_ regarded as human skill differs from _science_ (as _can_\nfrom _know_) as a practical faculty does from a theoretical, as Technic\ndoes from Theory (as mensuration from geometry). And so what we _can_\ndo, as soon as we merely _know_ what ought to be done and therefore\nare sufficiently cognisant of the desired effect, is not called\nArt. Only that which a man, even if he knows it completely, may not\ntherefore have the skill to accomplish, belongs to Art. _Camper_[75]\ndescribes very exactly how the best shoes must be made, but he\ncertainly could not make one.[76]\n(3). _Art_ also differs from _handicraft_; the first is called _free_,\nthe other may be called mercenary. We regard the first as if it could\nonly prove purposive as play, _i.e._ as occupation that is pleasant in\nitself. But the second is regarded as if it could only be compulsorily\nimposed upon one as work, _i.e._ as occupation which is unpleasant (a\ntrouble) in itself, and which is only attractive on account of its\neffect (_e.g._ the wage). Whether or not in the graded list of the\nprofessions we ought to count watchmakers as artists, but smiths only\nas handicraftsmen, would require another point of view from which to\njudge than that which we are here taking up; viz. [we should have to\nconsider] the proportion of talents which must be assumed requisite in\nthese several occupations. Whether or not, again, under the so-called\nseven free arts some may be included which ought to be classed as\nsciences, and many that are akin rather to handicraft, I shall not\nhere discuss. But it is not inexpedient to recall that in all free\narts there is yet requisite something compulsory, or, as it is called,\n_mechanism_, without which the _spirit_, which must be free in art and\nwhich alone inspires the work, would have no body and would evaporate\naltogether; _e.g._ in poetry there must be an accuracy and wealth of\nlanguage, and also prosody and metre. [It is not inexpedient, I say,\nto recall this], for many modern educators believe that the best way\nto produce a free art is to remove it from all constraint, and thus to\nchange it from work into mere play.\n\u00a7 44. _Of beautiful Art_\nThere is no Science of the Beautiful, but only a Critique of it; and\nthere is no such thing as beautiful Science, but only beautiful Art.\nFor as regards the first point, if it could be decided scientifically,\n_i.e._ by proofs, whether a thing was to be regarded as beautiful or\nnot, the judgement upon beauty would belong to science and would not\nbe a judgement of taste. And as far as the second point is concerned,\na science which should be beautiful as such is a nonentity. For if\nin such a science we were to ask for grounds and proofs, we would be\nput off with tasteful phrases (bon-mots).--The source of the common\nexpression, _beautiful science_, is without doubt nothing else than\nthis, as it has been rightly remarked, that for beautiful art in its\nentire completeness much science is requisite; _e.g._ a knowledge\nof ancient languages, a learned familiarity with classical authors,\nhistory, a knowledge of antiquities, etc. And hence these historical\nsciences, because they form the necessary preparation and basis for\nbeautiful art, and also partly because under them is included the\nknowledge of the products of beautiful art (rhetoric and poetry), have\ncome to be called beautiful sciences by a confusion of words.\nIf art which is adequate to the _cognition_ of a possible object\nperforms the actions requisite therefore merely in order to make it\nactual, it is _mechanical_ art; but if it has for its immediate design\nthe feeling of pleasure, it is called _aesthetical_ art. This is again\neither _pleasant_ or _beautiful_. It is the first, if its purpose is\nthat the pleasure should accompany the representations [of the object]\nregarded as mere _sensations_; it is the second if they are regarded as\n_modes of cognition_.\nPleasant arts are those that are directed merely to enjoyment. Of\nthis class are all those charming arts that can gratify a company at\ntable; _e.g._ the art of telling stories in an entertaining way, of\nstarting the company in frank and lively conversation, of raising them\nby jest and laugh to a certain pitch of merriment;[77] when, as people\nsay, there may be a great deal of gossip at the feast, but no one\nwill be answerable for what he says, because they are only concerned\nwith momentary entertainment, and not with any permanent material\nfor reflection or subsequent discussion. (Among these are also to be\nreckoned the way of arranging the table for enjoyment, and, at great\nfeasts, the management of the music. This latter is a wonderful thing.\nIt is meant to dispose to gaiety the minds of the guests, regarded\nsolely as a pleasant noise, without any one paying the least attention\nto its composition; and it favours the free conversation of each\nwith his neighbour.) Again, to this class belong all games which\nbring with them no further interest than that of making the time pass\nimperceptibly.\nOn the other hand, beautiful art is a mode of representation which is\npurposive for itself, and which, although devoid of [definite] purpose,\nyet furthers the culture of the mental powers in reference to social\ncommunication.\nThe universal communicability of a pleasure carries with it in its very\nconcept that the pleasure is not one of enjoyment, from mere sensation,\nbut must be derived from reflection; and thus aesthetical art, as\nthe art of beauty, has for standard the reflective Judgement and not\nsensation.\n\u00a7 45. _Beautiful Art is an art, in so far as it seems like nature_\nIn a product of beautiful art we must become conscious that it is Art\nand not Nature; but yet the purposiveness in its form must seem to be\nas free from all constraint of arbitrary rules as if it were a product\nof mere nature. On this feeling of freedom in the play of our cognitive\nfaculties, which must at the same time be purposive, rests that\npleasure which alone is universally communicable, without being based\non concepts. Nature is beautiful because it looks like Art; and Art can\nonly be called beautiful if we are conscious of it as Art while yet it\nlooks like Nature.\nFor whether we are dealing with natural or with artificial beauty we\ncan say generally: _That is beautiful which pleases in the mere act of\njudging it_ (not in the sensation of it, or by means of a concept). Now\nart has always a definite design of producing something. But if this\nsomething were bare sensation (something merely subjective), which is\nto be accompanied with pleasure, the product would please in the act\nof judgement only by mediation of sensible feeling. And again, if the\ndesign were directed towards the production of a definite Object, then,\nif this were attained by art, the Object would only please by means of\nconcepts. But in both cases the art would not please _in the mere act\nof judging_; _i.e._ it would not please as beautiful, but as mechanical.\nHence the purposiveness in the product of beautiful art, although it\nis designed, must not seem to be designed; _i.e._ beautiful art must\n_look_ like nature, although we are conscious of it as art. But a\nproduct of art appears like nature when, although its agreement with\nthe rules, according to which alone the product can become what it\nought to be, is _punctiliously_ observed, yet this is not _painfully_\napparent; [the form of the schools does not obtrude itself][78]--it\nshows no trace of the rule having been before the eyes of the artist\nand having fettered his mental powers.\n\u00a7 46. _Beautiful Art is the art of genius_\n_Genius_ is the talent (or natural gift) which gives the rule to Art.\nSince talent, as the innate productive faculty of the artist, belongs\nitself to Nature, we may express the matter thus: _Genius_ is the\ninnate mental disposition (_ingenium_) _through which_ Nature gives the\nrule to Art.\nWhatever may be thought of this definition, whether it is merely\narbitrary or whether it is adequate to the concept that we are\naccustomed to combine with the word _genius_ (which is to be examined\nin the following paragraphs), we can prove already beforehand that\naccording to the signification of the word here adopted, beautiful arts\nmust necessarily be considered as arts of _genius_.\nFor every art presupposes rules by means of which in the first instance\na product, if it is to be called artistic, is represented as possible.\nBut the concept of beautiful art does not permit the judgement upon the\nbeauty of a product to be derived from any rule, which has a _concept_\nas its determining ground, and therefore has at its basis a concept\nof the way in which the product is possible. Therefore, beautiful art\ncannot itself devise the rule according to which it can bring about its\nproduct. But since at the same time a product can never be called Art\nwithout some precedent rule, Nature in the subject must (by the harmony\nof its faculties) give the rule to Art; _i.e._ beautiful Art is only\npossible as a product of Genius.\nWe thus see (1) that genius is a _talent_ for producing that for which\nno definite rule can be given; it is not a mere aptitude for what can\nbe learnt by a rule. Hence _originality_ must be its first property.\n(2) But since it also can produce original nonsense, its products\nmust be models, _i.e._ _exemplary_; and they consequently ought not\nto spring from imitation, but must serve as a standard or rule of\njudgement for others. (3) It cannot describe or indicate scientifically\nhow it brings about its products, but it gives the rule just as nature\ndoes. Hence the author of a product for which he is indebted to his\ngenius does not himself know how he has come by his Ideas; and he has\nnot the power to devise the like at pleasure or in accordance with a\nplan, and to communicate it to others in precepts that will enable them\nto produce similar products. (Hence it is probable that the word genius\nis derived from _genius_, that peculiar guiding and guardian spirit\ngiven to a man at his birth, from whose suggestion these original\nIdeas proceed.) (4) Nature by the medium of genius does not prescribe\nrules to Science, but to Art; and to it only in so far as it is to be\nbeautiful Art.\n\u00a7 47. _Elucidation and confirmation of the above explanation of Genius_\nEvery one is agreed that genius is entirely opposed to the _spirit of\nimitation_. Now since learning is nothing but imitation, it follows\nthat the greatest ability and teachableness (capacity) regarded _qu\u00e2_\nteachableness, cannot avail for genius. Even if a man thinks or invents\nfor himself, and does not merely take in what others have taught,\neven if he discovers many things in art and science, this is not the\nright ground for calling such a (perhaps great) _head_, a genius (as\nopposed to him who because he can only learn and imitate is called a\n_shallow-pate_). For even these things could be learned, they lie in\nthe natural path of him who investigates and reflects according to\nrules; and they do not differ specifically from what can be acquired\nby industry through imitation. Thus we can readily learn all that\n_Newton_ has set forth in his immortal work on the Principles of\nNatural Philosophy, however great a head was required to discover it;\nbut we cannot learn to write spirited poetry, however express may be\nthe precepts of the art and however excellent its models. The reason\nis that _Newton_ could make all his steps, from the first elements\nof geometry to his own great and profound discoveries, intuitively\nplain and definite as regards consequence, not only to himself but\nto every one else. But a _Homer_ or a _Wieland_ cannot show how his\nIdeas, so rich in fancy and yet so full of thought, come together in\nhis head, simply because he does not know and therefore cannot teach\nothers. In Science then the greatest discoverer only differs in degree\nfrom his laborious imitator and pupil; but he differs specifically\nfrom him whom Nature has gifted for beautiful Art. And in this there\nis no depreciation of those great men to whom the human race owes so\nmuch gratitude, as compared with nature\u2019s favourites in respect of\nthe talent for beautiful art. For in the fact that the former talent\nis directed to the ever-advancing greater perfection of knowledge and\nevery advantage depending on it, and at the same time to the imparting\nthis same knowledge to others--in this it has a great superiority\nover [the talent of] those who deserve the honour of being called\ngeniuses. For art stands still at a certain point; a boundary is set to\nit beyond which it cannot go, which presumably has been reached long\nago and cannot be extended further. Again, artistic skill cannot be\ncommunicated; it is imparted to every artist immediately by the hand\nof nature; and so it dies with him, until nature endows another in the\nsame way, so that he only needs an example in order to put in operation\nin a similar fashion the talent of which he is conscious.\nIf now it is a natural gift which must prescribe its rule to art (as\nbeautiful art), of what kind is this rule? It cannot be reduced to\na formula and serve as a precept, for then the judgement upon the\nbeautiful would be determinable according to concepts; but the rule\nmust be abstracted from the fact, _i.e._ from the product, on which\nothers may try their own talent by using it as a model, not to be\n_copied_ but to be _imitated_. How this is possible is hard to explain.\nThe Ideas of the artist excite like Ideas in his pupils if nature has\nendowed them with a like proportion of their mental powers. Hence\nmodels of beautiful art are the only means of handing down these Ideas\nto posterity. This cannot be done by mere descriptions, especially not\nin the case of the arts of speech, and in this latter classical models\nare only to be had in the old dead languages, now preserved only as\n\u201cthe learned languages.\u201d\nAlthough mechanical and beautiful art are very different, the first\nbeing a mere art of industry and learning and the second of genius, yet\nthere is no beautiful art in which there is not a mechanical element\nthat can be comprehended by rules and followed accordingly, and in\nwhich therefore there must be something _scholastic_ as an essential\ncondition. For [in every art] some purpose must be conceived; otherwise\nwe could not ascribe the product to art at all, and it would be a mere\nproduct of chance. But in order to accomplish a purpose, definite rules\nfrom which we cannot dispense ourselves are requisite. Now since the\noriginality of the talent constitutes an essential (though not the\nonly) element in the character of genius, shallow heads believe that\nthey cannot better show themselves to be full-blown geniuses than by\nthrowing off the constraint of all rules; they believe, in effect, that\none could make a braver show on the back of a wild horse than on the\nback of a trained animal. Genius can only furnish rich _material_ for\nproducts of beautiful art; its execution and its _form_ require talent\ncultivated in the schools, in order to make such a use of this material\nas will stand examination by the Judgement. But it is quite ridiculous\nfor a man to speak and decide like a genius in things which require\nthe most careful investigation by Reason. One does not know whether to\nlaugh more at the impostor who spreads such a mist round him that we\ncannot clearly use our Judgement and so use our Imagination the more,\nor at the public which na\u00efvely imagines that his inability to cognise\nclearly and to comprehend the masterpiece before him arises from new\ntruths crowding in on him in such abundance that details (duly weighed\ndefinitions and accurate examination of fundamental propositions) seem\nbut clumsy work.\n\u00a7 48. _Of the relation of Genius to Taste_\nFor _judging_ of beautiful objects as such, _taste_ is requisite;\nbut for beautiful art, _i.e._ for the _production_ of such objects,\n_genius_ is requisite.\nIf we consider genius as the talent for beautiful art (which the\nspecial meaning of the word implies) and in this point of view analyse\nit into the faculties which must concur to constitute such a talent, it\nis necessary in the first instance to determine exactly the difference\nbetween natural beauty, the judging of which requires only Taste, and\nartificial beauty, whose possibility (to which reference must be made\nin judging such an object) requires Genius.\nA natural beauty is a _beautiful thing_; artificial beauty is a\n_beautiful representation_ of a thing.\nIn order to judge of a natural beauty as such I need not have\nbeforehand a concept of what sort of thing the object is to be; _i.e._\nI need not know its material purposiveness (the purpose), but its mere\nform pleases by itself in the act of judging it without any knowledge\nof the purpose. But if the object is given as a product of art, and as\nsuch is to be declared beautiful, then, because art always supposes a\npurpose in the cause (and its causality), there must be at bottom in\nthe first instance a concept of what the thing is to be. And as the\nagreement of the manifold in a thing with its inner destination, its\npurpose, constitutes the perfection of the thing, it follows that in\njudging of artificial beauty the perfection of the thing must be taken\ninto account; but in judging of natural beauty (as _such_) there is no\nquestion at all about this.--It is true that in judging of objects of\nnature, especially objects endowed with life, _e.g._ a man or a horse,\ntheir objective purposiveness also is commonly taken into consideration\nin judging of their beauty; but then the judgement is no longer purely\naesthetical, _i.e._ a mere judgement of taste. Nature is no longer\njudged inasmuch as it appears like art, but in so far as it _is_ actual\n(although superhuman) art; and the teleological judgement serves as the\nbasis and condition of the aesthetical, as a condition to which the\nlatter must have respect. In such a case, _e.g._ if it is said \u201cthat is\na beautiful woman,\u201d we think nothing else than this: nature represents\nin her figure the purposes in view in the shape of a woman\u2019s figure.\nFor we must look beyond the mere form to a concept, if the object\nis to be thought in such a way by means of a logically conditioned\naesthetical judgement.\nBeautiful art shows its superiority in this, that it describes as\nbeautiful things which may be in nature ugly or displeasing.[79]\nThe Furies, diseases, the devastations of war, etc., may [even\nregarded as calamitous],[80] be described as very beautiful, and even\nrepresented in a picture. There is only one kind of ugliness which\ncannot be represented in accordance with nature, without destroying\nall aesthetical satisfaction and consequently artificial beauty;\nviz. that which excites _disgust_. For in this peculiar sensation,\nwhich rests on mere imagination, the object is represented as it\nwere obtruding itself for our enjoyment while we strive against it\nwith all our might. And the artistic representation of the object\nis no longer distinguished from the nature of the object itself in\nour sensation, and thus it is impossible that it can be regarded as\nbeautiful. The art of sculpture again, because in its products art is\nalmost interchangeable with nature, excludes from its creations the\nimmediate representation of ugly objects; _e.g._ it represents death\nby a beautiful genius, the warlike spirit by Mars, and permits [all\nsuch things] to be represented only by an allegory or attribute[81]\nthat has a pleasing effect, and thus only indirectly by the aid of the\ninterpretation of Reason, and not for the mere aesthetical Judgement.\nSo much for the beautiful representation of an object, which is\nproperly only the form of the presentation of a concept, and the means\nby which the latter is communicated universally.--But to give this form\nto the product of beautiful art, mere taste is requisite. By taste,\nafter he has exercised and corrected it by manifold examples from art\nor nature, the artist checks his work; and after many, often toilsome,\nattempts to content taste he finds the form which satisfies him. Hence\nthis form is not, as it were, a thing of inspiration or the result of a\nfree swing of the mental powers, but of a slow and even painful process\nof improvement, by which he seeks to render it adequate to his thought,\nwithout detriment to the freedom of the play of his powers.\nBut taste is merely a judging and not a productive faculty; and what\nis appropriate to it is not therefore a work of beautiful art. It\nmay be only a product belonging to useful and mechanical art or even\nto science, produced according to definite rules that can be learned\nand must be exactly followed. But the pleasing form that is given to\nit is only the vehicle of communication, and a mode, as it were, of\npresenting it, in respect of which we remain free to a certain extent,\nalthough it is combined with a definite purpose. Thus we desire that\ntable appointments, a moral treatise, even a sermon, should have\nin themselves this form of beautiful art, without it seeming to be\n_sought_: but we do not therefore call these things works of beautiful\nart. Under the latter class are reckoned a poem, a piece of music, a\npicture gallery, etc.; and in some would-be works of beautiful art\nwe find genius without taste, while in others we find taste without\ngenius.\n\u00a7 49. _Of the faculties of the mind that constitute Genius_\nWe say of certain products of which we expect that they should at\nleast in part appear as beautiful art, they are without _spirit_[82];\nalthough we find nothing to blame in them on the score of taste. A poem\nmay be very neat and elegant, but without spirit. A history may be\nexact and well arranged, but without spirit. A festal discourse may be\nsolid and at the same time elaborate, but without spirit. Conversation\nis often not devoid of entertainment, but yet without spirit: even of\na woman we say that she is pretty, an agreeable talker, and courteous,\nbut without spirit. What then do we mean by spirit?\n_Spirit_, in an aesthetical sense, is the name given to the animating\nprinciple of the mind. But that whereby this principle animates the\nsoul, the material which it applies to that [purpose], is that which\nputs the mental powers purposively into swing, _i.e._ into such a\nplay as maintains itself and strengthens the [mental] powers in their\nexercise.\nNow I maintain that this principle is no other than the faculty of\npresenting _aesthetical Ideas_. And by an aesthetical Idea I understand\nthat representation of the Imagination which occasions much thought,\nwithout, however, any definite thought, _i.e._ any _concept_, being\ncapable of being adequate to it; it consequently cannot be completely\ncompassed and made intelligible by language.--We easily see that it is\nthe counterpart (pendant) of a _rational Idea_, which conversely is a\nconcept to which no _intuition_ (or representation of the Imagination)\ncan be adequate.\nThe Imagination (as a productive faculty of cognition) is very powerful\nin creating another nature, as it were, out of the material that\nactual nature gives it. We entertain ourselves with it when experience\nproves too commonplace, and by it we remould experience, always indeed\nin accordance with analogical laws, but yet also in accordance with\nprinciples which occupy a higher place in Reason (laws too which are\njust as natural to us as those by which Understanding comprehends\nempirical nature). Thus we feel our freedom from the law of association\n(which attaches to the empirical employment of Imagination), so that\nthe material which we borrow from nature in accordance with this law\ncan be worked up into something different which surpasses nature.\nSuch representations of the Imagination we may call _Ideas_, partly\nbecause they at least strive after something which lies beyond the\nbounds of experience, and so seek to approximate to a presentation of\nconcepts of Reason (intellectual Ideas), thus giving to the latter the\nappearance of objective reality,--but especially because no concept can\nbe fully adequate to them as internal intuitions. The poet ventures to\nrealise to sense, rational Ideas of invisible beings, the kingdom of\nthe blessed, hell, eternity, creation, etc.; or even if he deals with\nthings of which there are examples in experience,--_e.g._ death, envy\nand all vices, also love, fame, and the like,--he tries, by means of\nImagination, which emulates the play of Reason in its quest after a\nmaximum, to go beyond the limits of experience and to present them\nto Sense with a completeness of which there is no example in nature.\nIt is, properly speaking, in the art of the poet, that the faculty\nof aesthetical Ideas can manifest itself in its full measure. But\nthis faculty, considered in itself, is properly only a talent (of the\nImagination).\nIf now we place under a concept a representation of the Imagination\nbelonging to its presentation, but which occasions solely by itself\nmore thought than can ever be comprehended in a definite concept,\nand which therefore enlarges aesthetically the concept itself in an\nunbounded fashion,--the Imagination is here creative, and it brings\nthe faculty of intellectual Ideas (the Reason) into movement; _i.e._ a\nmovement, occasioned by a representation, towards more thought (though\nbelonging, no doubt, to the concept of the object) than can be grasped\nin the representation or made clear.\nThose forms which do not constitute the presentation of a given concept\nitself but only, as approximate representations of the Imagination,\nexpress the consequences bound up with it and its relationship to\nother concepts, are called (aesthetical) _attributes_ of an object,\nwhose concept as a rational Idea cannot be adequately presented.\nThus Jupiter\u2019s eagle with the lightning in its claws is an attribute\nof the mighty king of heaven, as the peacock is of its magnificent\nqueen. They do not, like _logical attributes_, represent what lies in\nour concepts of the sublimity and majesty of creation, but something\ndifferent, which gives occasion to the Imagination to spread itself\nover a number of kindred representations, that arouse more thought\nthan can be expressed in a concept determined by words. They furnish\nan _aesthetical Idea_, which for that rational Idea takes the place\nof logical presentation; and thus as their proper office they enliven\nthe mind by opening out to it the prospect into an illimitable field\nof kindred representations. But beautiful art does this not only in\nthe case of painting or sculpture (in which the term \u201cattribute\u201d is\ncommonly employed): poetry and rhetoric also get the spirit that\nanimates their works simply from the aesthetical attributes of the\nobject, which accompany the logical and stimulate the Imagination, so\nthat it thinks more by their aid, although in an undeveloped way, than\ncould be comprehended in a concept and therefore in a definite form of\nwords.-- For the sake of brevity I must limit myself to a few examples\nonly.\nWhen the great King[83] in one of his poems expresses himself as\nfollows:\n\u201cOui, finissons sans trouble et mourons sans regrets,\nEn laissant l\u2019univers combl\u00e9 de nos bienfaits.\nAinsi l\u2019astre du jour au bout de sa carri\u00e8re,\nR\u00e9pand sur l\u2019horizon une douce lumi\u00e8re;\nEt les derniers rayons qu\u2019il darde dans les airs,\nSont les derniers soupirs qu\u2019il donne \u00e0 l\u2019univers;\u201d\nhe quickens his rational Idea of a cosmopolitan disposition at the end\nof life by an attribute which the Imagination (in remembering all the\npleasures of a beautiful summer day that are recalled at its close\nby a serene evening) associates with that representation, and which\nexcites a number of sensations and secondary representations for which\nno expression is found. On the other hand, an intellectual concept may\nserve conversely as an attribute for a representation of sense and\nso can quicken this latter by means of the Idea of the supersensible;\nbut only by the aesthetical [element], that subjectively attaches to\nthe concept of the latter, being here employed. Thus, for example, a\ncertain poet[84] says, in his description of a beautiful morning:\n\u201cThe sun arose\nAs calm from virtue springs.\u201d\nThe consciousness of virtue, even if one only places oneself in\nthought in the position of a virtuous man, diffuses in the mind a\nmultitude of sublime and restful feelings and a boundless prospect of\na joyful future, to which no expression measured by a definite concept\ncompletely attains.[85]\nIn a word the aesthetical Idea is a representation of the Imagination\nassociated with a given concept, which is bound up with such a\nmultiplicity of partial representations in its free employment, that\nfor it no expression marking a definite concept can be found; and such\na representation, therefore, adds to a concept much ineffable thought,\nthe feeling of which quickens the cognitive faculties, and with\nlanguage, which is the mere letter, binds up spirit also.\nThe mental powers, therefore, whose union (in a certain relation)\nconstitutes _genius_ are Imagination and Understanding. In the\nemployment of the Imagination for cognition it submits to the\nconstraint of the Understanding and is subject to the limitation of\nbeing conformable to the concept of the latter. On the other hand, in\nan aesthetical point of view it is free to furnish unsought, over and\nabove that agreement with a concept, abundance of undeveloped material\nfor the Understanding; to which the Understanding paid no regard in its\nconcept, but which it applies, though not objectively for cognition,\nyet subjectively to quicken the cognitive powers and therefore also\nindirectly to cognitions. Thus genius properly consists in the happy\nrelation [between these faculties], which no science can teach and no\nindustry can learn, by which Ideas are found for a given concept; and\non the other hand, we thus find for these Ideas the _expression_, by\nmeans of which the subjective state of mind brought about by them,\nas an accompaniment of the concept, can be communicated to others.\nThe latter talent is properly speaking what is called spirit; for\nto express the ineffable element in the state of mind implied by a\ncertain representation and to make it universally communicable--whether\nthe expression be in speech or painting or statuary--this requires\na faculty of seizing the quickly passing play of Imagination and of\nunifying it in a concept (which is even on that account original\nand discloses a new rule that could not have been inferred from any\npreceding principles or examples), that can be communicated without any\nconstraint [of rules].[86]\n*       *       *       *       *\nIf after this analysis we look back to the explanation given above\nof what is called _genius_, we find: _first_, that it is a talent for\nArt, not for Science, in which clearly known rules must go beforehand\nand determine the procedure. _Secondly_, as an artistic talent it\npresupposes a definite concept of the product, as the purpose, and\ntherefore Understanding; but it also presupposes a representation\n(although an indeterminate one) of the material, _i.e._ of the\nintuition, for the presentment of this concept; and, therefore, a\nrelation between the Imagination and the Understanding. _Thirdly_, it\nshows itself not so much in the accomplishment of the proposed purpose\nin a presentment of a definite _concept_, as in the enunciation or\nexpression of _aesthetical Ideas_, which contain abundant material for\nthat very design; and consequently it represents the Imagination as\nfree from all guidance of rules and yet as purposive in reference to\nthe presentment of the given concept. Finally, in the _fourth_ place,\nthe unsought undesigned subjective purposiveness in the free accordance\nof the Imagination with the legality of the Understanding presupposes\nsuch a proportion and disposition of these faculties as no following of\nrules, whether of science or of mechanical imitation, can bring about,\nbut which only the nature of the subject can produce.\nIn accordance with these suppositions genius is the exemplary\noriginality of the natural gifts of a subject in the _free_ employment\nof his cognitive faculties. In this way the product of a genius (as\nregards what is to be ascribed to genius and not to possible learning\nor schooling) is an example, not to be imitated (for then that which\nin it is genius and constitutes the spirit of the work would be lost),\nbut to be followed, by another genius; whom it awakens to a feeling of\nhis own originality and whom it stirs so to exercise his art in freedom\nfrom the constraint of rules, that thereby a new rule is gained for\nart, and thus his talent shows itself to be exemplary. But because a\ngenius is a favourite of nature and must be regarded by us as a rare\nphenomenon, his example produces for other good heads a school, _i.e._\na methodical system of teaching according to rules, so far as these can\nbe derived from the peculiarities of the products of his spirit. For\nsuch persons beautiful art is so far imitation, to which nature through\nthe medium of a genius supplied the rule.\nBut this imitation becomes a mere _aping_, if the scholar _copies_\neverything down to the deformities, which the genius must have let\npass only because he could not well remove them without weakening his\nIdea. This mental characteristic is meritorious only in the case of\na genius. A certain _audacity_ in expression--and in general many a\ndeparture from common rules--becomes him well, but it is in no way\nworthy of imitation; it always remains a fault in itself which we\nmust seek to remove, though the genius is as it were privileged to\ncommit it, because the inimitable rush of his spirit would suffer\nfrom over-anxious carefulness. _Mannerism_ is another kind of aping,\nviz. of mere _peculiarity_ (originality) in general; by which a man\nseparates himself as far as possible from imitators, without however\npossessing the talent to be at the same time _exemplary_.--There\nare indeed in general two ways (_modi_) in which such a man may put\ntogether his notions of expressing himself; the one is called a\n_manner_ (_modus aestheticus_), the other a _method_ (_modus logicus_).\nThey differ in this, that the former has no other standard than the\n_feeling_ of unity in the presentment, but the latter follows definite\n_principles_; hence the former alone avails for beautiful art. But an\nartistic product is said to show _mannerism_ only when the exposition\nof the artist\u2019s Idea is _founded_ on its very singularity, and is not\nmade appropriate to the Idea itself. The ostentatious (_pr\u00e9cieux_),\ncontorted, and affected [manner, adopted] to differentiate oneself from\nordinary persons (though devoid of spirit) is like the behaviour of a\nman of whom we say, that he hears himself talk, or who stands and moves\nabout as if he were on a stage in order to be stared at; this always\nbetrays a bungler.\n\u00a7 50. _Of the combination of Taste with Genius in the products of\nbeautiful Art_\nTo ask whether it is more important for the things of beautiful art\nthat Genius or Taste should be displayed, is the same as to ask whether\nin it more depends on Imagination or on Judgement. Now, since in\nrespect of the first an art is rather said to be _full of spirit_, but\nonly deserves to be called a _beautiful_ art on account of the second;\nthis latter is at least, as its indispensable condition (_conditio sine\nqua non_), the most important thing to which one has to look in the\njudging of art as beautiful art. Abundance and originality of Ideas\nare less necessary to beauty than the accordance of the Imagination in\nits freedom with the conformity to law of the Understanding. For all\nthe abundance of the former produces in lawless freedom nothing but\nnonsense; on the other hand, the Judgement is the faculty by which it\nis adjusted to the Understanding.\nTaste, like the Judgement in general, is the discipline (or training)\nof Genius; it clips its wings closely, and makes it cultured and\npolished; but, at the same time, it gives guidance as to where and\nhow far it may extend itself, if it is to remain purposive. And while\nit brings clearness and order into the multitude of the thoughts, it\nmakes the Ideas susceptible of being permanently and, at the same time,\nuniversally assented to, and capable of being followed by others, and\nof an ever-progressive culture. If, then, in the conflict of these two\nproperties in a product something must be sacrificed, it should be\nrather on the side of genius; and the Judgement, which in the things of\nbeautiful art gives its decision from its own proper principles, will\nrather sacrifice the freedom and wealth of the Imagination than permit\nanything prejudicial to the Understanding.\nFor beautiful art, therefore, _Imagination_, _Understanding_, _Spirit_,\nand _Taste_ are requisite.[87]\n\u00a7 51. _Of the division of the beautiful arts_\nWe may describe beauty in general (whether natural or artificial) as\nthe _expression_ of aesthetical Ideas; only that in beautiful Art this\nIdea must be occasioned by a concept of the Object; whilst in beautiful\nNature the mere reflection upon a given intuition, without any concept\nof what the object is to be, is sufficient for the awakening and\ncommunicating of the Idea of which that Object is regarded as the\n_expression_.\nIf, then, we wish to make a division of the beautiful arts, we\ncannot choose a more convenient principle, at least tentatively,\nthan the analogy of art with the mode of expression of which men\navail themselves in speech, in order to communicate to one another\nas perfectly as possible not merely their concepts but also their\nsensations.[88]--This is done by _word_, _deportment_, and _tone_\n(articulation, gesticulation, and modulation). It is only by the\ncombination of these three kinds of expression that communication\nbetween the speaker [and his hearers] can be complete. For thus\nthought, intuition, and sensation are transmitted to others\nsimultaneously and conjointly.\nThere are, therefore, only three kinds of beautiful arts; the arts of\n_speech_, the _formative_ arts, and the art of the _play of sensations_\n(as external sensible impressions). We may also arrange a division by\ndichotomy; thus beautiful art may be divided into the art of expression\nof thoughts and of intuitions; and these further subdivided in\naccordance with their form or their matter (sensation). But this would\nappear to be too abstract, and not so accordant with ordinary concepts.\n(1) The arts of SPEECH are _rhetoric_ and _poetry_. _Rhetoric_ is the\nart of carrying on a serious business of the Understanding as if it\nwere a free play of the Imagination; _poetry_, the art of conducting a\nfree play of the Imagination as if it were a serious business of the\nUnderstanding.\nThe _orator_, then, promises a serious business, and in order to\nentertain his audience conducts it as if it were a mere _play_ with\nIdeas. The _poet_ merely promises an entertaining play with Ideas,\nand yet it has the same effect upon the Understanding as if he had\nonly intended to carry on its business. The combination and harmony of\nboth cognitive faculties, Sensibility and Understanding, which cannot\ndispense with one another, but which yet cannot well be united without\nconstraint and mutual prejudice, must appear to be undesigned and so\nto be brought about by themselves: otherwise it is not _beautiful_\nart. Hence, all that is studied and anxious must be avoided in it, for\nbeautiful art must be free art in a double sense. It is not a work like\nthat of a tradesman, the magnitude of which can be judged, exacted, or\npaid for, according to a definite standard; and again, though the mind\nis occupied, still it feels itself contented and stimulated, without\nlooking to any other purpose (independently of reward.)\nThe orator therefore gives something which he does not promise, viz.\nan entertaining play of the Imagination; but he also fails to supply\nwhat he did promise, which is indeed his announced business, viz. the\npurposive occupation of the Understanding. On the other hand, the poet\npromises little and announces a mere play with Ideas; but he supplies\nsomething which is worth occupying ourselves with, because he provides\nin this play food for the Understanding, and by the aid of Imagination\ngives life to his concepts. [Thus the orator on the whole gives less,\nthe poet more, than he promises.][89]\n(2) The FORMATIVE arts, or those by which expression is found for Ideas\nin _sensible intuition_ (not by representations of mere Imagination\nthat are aroused by words), are either arts of _sensible truth_ or\nof _sensible illusion_. The former is called _Plastic_, the latter\n_Painting_. Both express Ideas by figures in space; the former makes\nfigures cognisable by two senses, sight and touch (although not by\nthe latter as far as beauty is concerned); the latter only by one,\nthe first of these. The aesthetical Idea (the archetype or original\nimage) is fundamental for both in the Imagination, but the figure which\nexpresses this (the ectype or copy) is either given in its bodily\nextension (as the object itself exists), or as it paints itself on the\neye (according to its appearance when projected on a flat surface). In\nthe first case[90] the condition given to reflection may be either the\nreference to an actual purpose or only the semblance of it.\nTo _Plastic_, the first kind of beautiful formative Art, belong\n_Sculpture_ and _Architecture_. The _first_ presents corporeally\nconcepts of things, _as they might have existed in nature_ (though\nas beautiful art it has regard to aesthetical purposiveness). The\n_second_ is the art of presenting concepts of things that are possible\n_only through Art_, and whose form has for its determining ground not\nnature but an arbitrary purpose, with the view of presenting them with\naesthetical purposiveness. In the latter the chief point is a certain\n_use_ of the artistic object, by which condition the aesthetical Ideas\nare limited. In the former the main design is the mere _expression_ of\naesthetical Ideas. Thus statues of men, gods, animals, etc., are of\nthe first kind; but temples, splendid buildings for public assemblies,\neven dwelling-houses, triumphal arches, columns, mausoleums, and the\nlike, erected in honourable remembrance, belong to Architecture. Indeed\nall house furniture (upholsterer\u2019s work and such like things which are\nfor use) may be reckoned under this art; because the suitability of a\nproduct for a certain use is the essential thing in an _architectural\nwork_. On the other hand, a mere _piece of sculpture_, which is simply\nmade for show and which is to please in itself, is as a corporeal\npresentation a mere imitation of nature, though with a reference to\naesthetical Ideas; in it _sensible truth_ is not to be carried so far\nthat the product ceases to look like art and looks like a product of\nthe elective will.\n_Painting_, as the second kind of formative art, which presents a\n_sensible illusion_ artificially combined with Ideas, I would divide\ninto the art of the beautiful _depicting of nature_ and that of the\nbeautiful _arrangement of its products_. The first is _painting\nproper_, the second is the art of _landscape gardening_. The first\ngives only the illusory appearance of corporeal extension; the second\ngives this in accordance with truth, but only the appearance of\nutility and availableness for other purposes than the mere play of\nthe Imagination in the contemplation of its forms.[91] This latter is\nnothing else than the ornamentation of the soil with a variety of\nthose things (grasses, flowers, shrubs, trees, even ponds, hillocks,\nand dells) which nature presents to an observer, only arranged\ndifferently and in conformity with certain Ideas. But, again, the\nbeautiful arrangement of corporeal things is only apparent to the\neye, like painting; the sense of touch cannot supply any intuitive\npresentation of such a form. Under painting in the wide sense I would\nreckon the decoration of rooms by the aid of tapestry, bric-a-brac, and\nall beautiful furniture which is merely available to be _looked_ at;\nand the same may be said of the art of tasteful dressing (with rings,\nsnuff-boxes, etc.). For a bed of various flowers, a room filled with\nvarious ornaments (including under this head even ladies\u2019 finery), make\nat a f\u00eate a kind of picture; which, like pictures properly so-called\n(that are not intended to _teach_ either history or natural science),\nhas in view merely the entertainment of the Imagination in free play\nwith Ideas, and the occupation of the aesthetical Judgement without\nany definite purpose. The detailed work in all this decoration may be\nquite distinct in the different cases and may require very different\nartists; but the judgement of taste upon whatever is beautiful in\nthese various arts is always determined in the same way: viz. it only\njudges the forms (without any reference to a purpose) as they present\nthemselves to the eye either singly or in combination, according to the\neffect they produce upon the Imagination.--But that formative art may\nbe compared (by analogy) with deportment in speech is justified by the\nfact that the spirit of the artist supplies by these figures a bodily\nexpression to his thought and its mode, and makes the thing itself as\nit were speak in mimic language. This is a very common play of our\nfancy, which attributes to lifeless things a spirit suitable to their\nform by which they speak to us.\n(3) The art of the BEAUTIFUL PLAY OF SENSATIONS (externally\nstimulated), which admits at the same time of universal communication,\ncan be concerned with nothing else than the proportion of the\ndifferent degrees of the disposition (tension) of the sense, to which\nthe sensation belongs, _i.e._ with its tone. In this far-reaching\nsignification of the word it may be divided into the artistic play of\nthe sensations of hearing and sight, _i.e._ into _Music_ and the _Art\nof colour_.--It is noteworthy that these two senses, besides their\nsusceptibility for impressions so far as these are needed to gain\nconcepts of external objects, are also capable of a peculiar sensation\nbound up therewith, of which we cannot strictly decide whether it is\nbased on sense or reflection. This susceptibility may sometimes be\nwanting, although in other respects the sense, as regards its use for\nthe cognition of Objects, is not at all deficient but is peculiarly\nfine. That is, we cannot say with certainty whether colours or tones\n(sounds) are merely pleasant sensations or whether they form in\nthemselves a beautiful play of sensations, and as such bring with them\nin aesthetical judgement a satisfaction in their form. If we think\nof the velocity of the vibrations of light, or in the second case\nof the air, which probably far surpasses all our faculty of judging\nimmediately in perception the time interval between them, we must\nbelieve that it is only the _effect_ of these vibrations upon the\nelastic parts of our body that is felt, but that the _time interval_\nbetween them is not remarked or brought into judgement; and thus that\nonly pleasantness and not beauty of composition is bound up with\ncolours and tones. But on the other hand, _first_, we think of the\nmathematical [element] which enables us to pronounce on the proportion\nbetween these oscillations in music and thus to judge of them; and by\nanalogy with which we easily may judge of the distinctions between\ncolours. _Secondly_, we recall instances (although they are rare) of\nmen who with the best sight in the world cannot distinguish colours,\nand with the sharpest hearing cannot distinguish tones; whilst for\nthose who can do this the perception of an altered quality (not merely\nof the degree of sensation) in the different intensities in the scale\nof colours and tones is definite; and further, the very number of these\nis fixed by _intelligible_ differences. Thus we may be compelled to see\nthat both kinds of sensations are to be regarded not as mere sensible\nimpressions, but as the effects of a judgement passed upon the form\nin the play of divers sensations. The difference in our definition,\naccording as we adopt the one or the other opinion in judging of the\ngrounds of Music, would be just this: either, as we have done, we\nmust explain it as the beautiful play of sensations (of hearing), or\nelse as a play of _pleasant_ sensations. According to the former mode\nof explanation music is represented altogether as a _beautiful_ art;\naccording to the latter, as a _pleasant_ art (at least in part).\n\u00a7 52. _Of the combination of beautiful arts in one and the same product_\nRhetoric may be combined with a pictorial presentation of its subjects\nand objects in a _theatrical piece_; poetry may be combined with music\nin a _song_, and this again with pictorial (theatrical) presentation in\nan _opera_; the play of sensations in music may be combined with the\nplay of figures in the _dance_, and so on. Even the presentation of\nthe sublime, so far as it belongs to beautiful art, may combine with\nbeauty in a _tragedy in verse_, in a _didactic poem_, in an _oratorio_;\nand in these combinations beautiful art is yet more artistic. Whether\nit is also more beautiful may in some of these cases be doubted (since\nso many different kinds of satisfaction cross one another). Yet in\nall beautiful art the essential thing is the form, which is purposive\nas regards our observation and judgement, where the pleasure is at\nthe same time cultivation and disposes the spirit to Ideas, and\nconsequently makes it susceptible of still more of such pleasure and\nentertainment. The essential element is not the matter of sensation\n(charm or emotion), which has only to do with enjoyment; this leaves\nbehind nothing in the Idea, and it makes the spirit dull, the object\ngradually distasteful, and the mind, on account of its consciousness of\na disposition that conflicts with purpose in the judgement of Reason,\ndiscontented with itself and peevish.\nIf the beautiful arts are not brought into more or less close\ncombination with moral Ideas, which alone bring with them a\nself-sufficing satisfaction, this latter fate must ultimately be\ntheirs. They then serve only as a distraction, of which we are the\nmore in need the more we avail ourselves of them to disperse the\ndiscontent of the mind with itself; so that we thus render ourselves\never more useless and ever more discontented. The beauties of nature\nare generally of most benefit in this point of view, if we are early\naccustomed to observe, appreciate, and admire them.\n\u00a7 53. _Comparison of the respective aesthetical worth of the beautiful\narts_\nOf all the arts _poetry_ (which owes its origin almost entirely to\ngenius and will least be guided by precept or example) maintains\nthe first rank. It expands the mind by setting the Imagination at\nliberty; and by offering within the limits of a given concept amid\nthe unbounded variety of possible forms accordant therewith, that\nwhich unites the presentment of this concept with a wealth of thought,\nto which no verbal expression is completely adequate; and so rising\naesthetically to Ideas. It strengthens the mind by making it feel its\nfaculty--free, spontaneous and independent of natural determination--of\nconsidering and judging nature as a phenomenon in accordance with\naspects which it does not present in experience either for Sense or\nUnderstanding, and therefore of using it on behalf of, and as a sort\nof schema for, the supersensible. It plays with illusion, which it\nproduces at pleasure, but without deceiving by it; for it declares\nits exercise to be mere play, which however can be purposively used\nby the Understanding.--Rhetoric, in so far as this means the art of\npersuasion, _i.e._ of deceiving by a beautiful show (_ars oratoria_),\nand not mere elegance of speech (eloquence and style), is a Dialectic,\nwhich borrows from poetry only so much as is needful to win minds\nto the side of the orator before they have formed a judgement, and\nto deprive them of their freedom; it cannot therefore be recommended\neither for the law courts or for the pulpit. For if we are dealing\nwith civil law, with the rights of individual persons, or with lasting\ninstruction and determination of people\u2019s minds to an accurate\nknowledge and a conscientious observance of their duty, it is unworthy\nof so important a business to allow a trace of any exuberance of wit\nand imagination to appear, and still less any trace of the art of\ntalking people over and of captivating them for the advantage of any\nchance person. For although this art may sometimes be directed to\nlegitimate and praiseworthy designs, it becomes objectionable, when in\nthis way maxims and dispositions are spoiled in a subjective point of\nview, though the action may objectively be lawful. It is not enough to\ndo what is right; we should practise it solely on the ground that it\nis right. Again, the mere concept of this species of matters of human\nconcern, when clear and combined with a lively presentation of it in\nexamples, without any offence against the rules of euphony of speech\nor propriety of expression, has by itself for Ideas of Reason (which\ncollectively constitute eloquence), sufficient influence upon human\nminds; so that it is not needful to add the machinery of persuasion,\nwhich, since it can be used equally well to beautify or to hide vice\nand error, cannot quite lull the secret suspicion that one is being\nartfully overreached. In poetry everything proceeds with honesty and\ncandour. It declares itself to be a mere entertaining play of the\nImagination, which wishes to proceed as regards form in harmony with\nthe laws of the Understanding; and it does not desire to steal upon\nand ensnare the Understanding by the aid of sensible presentation.[92]\nAfter poetry, _if we are to deal with charm and mental movement_, I\nwould place that art which comes nearest to the art of speech and can\nvery naturally be united with it, viz. _the art of tone_. For although\nit speaks by means of mere sensations without concepts, and so does\nnot, like poetry, leave anything over for reflection, it yet moves\nthe mind in a greater variety of ways and more intensely, although\nonly transitorily. It is, however, rather enjoyment than culture (the\nplay of thought that is incidentally excited by its means is merely\nthe effect of a kind of mechanical association); and in the judgement\nof Reason it has less worth than any other of the beautiful arts.\nHence, like all enjoyment, it desires constant change, and does not\nbear frequent repetition without producing weariness. Its charm, which\nadmits of universal communication, appears to rest on this, that every\nexpression of speech has in its context a tone appropriate to the\nsense. This tone indicates more or less an affection of the speaker,\nand produces it also in the hearer; which affection excites in its\nturn in the hearer the Idea that is expressed in speech by the tone\nin question. Thus as modulation is as it were a universal language of\nsensations intelligible to every man, the art of tone employs it by\nitself alone in its full force, viz. as a language of the affections,\nand thus communicates universally according to the laws of association\nthe aesthetical Ideas naturally combined therewith. Now these\naesthetical Ideas are not concepts or determinate thoughts. Hence the\nform of the composition of these sensations (harmony and melody) only\nserves instead of the form of language, by means of their proportionate\naccordance, to express the aesthetical Idea of a connected whole of an\nunspeakable wealth of thought, corresponding to a certain theme which\nproduces the dominating affection in the piece. This can be brought\nmathematically under certain rules, because it rests in the case of\ntones on the relation between the number of vibrations of the air in\nthe same time, so far as these tones are combined simultaneously or\nsuccessively. To this mathematical form, although not represented by\ndeterminate concepts, alone attaches the satisfaction that unites\nthe mere reflection upon such a number of concomitant or consecutive\nsensations with this their play, as a condition of its beauty valid for\nevery man. It is this alone which permits Taste to claim in advance a\nrightful authority over every one\u2019s judgement.\nBut in the charm and mental movement produced by Music, Mathematic\nhas certainly not the slightest share. It is only the indispensable\ncondition (_conditio sine qua non_) of that proportion of the\nimpressions in their combination and in their alternation by which\nit becomes possible to gather them together and prevent them from\ndestroying one another, and to harmonise them so as to produce a\ncontinual movement and animation of the mind, by means of affections\nconsonant therewith, and thus a delightful personal enjoyment.\nIf, on the other hand, we estimate the worth of the Beautiful Arts\nby the culture they supply to the mind, and take as a standard\nthe expansion of the faculties which must concur in the Judgement\nfor cognition, Music will have the lowest place among them (as\nit has perhaps the highest among those arts which are valued for\ntheir pleasantness), because it merely plays with sensations. The\nformative arts are far before it in this point of view; for in putting\nthe Imagination in a free play, which is also accordant with the\nUnderstanding, they at the same time carry on a serious business.\nThis they do by producing a product that serves for concepts as a\npermanent self-commendatory vehicle for promoting their union with\nsensibility and thus, as it were, the urbanity of the higher cognitive\npowers. These two species of art take quite different courses; the\nfirst proceeds from sensations to indeterminate Ideas, the second\nfrom determinate Ideas to sensations. The latter produce _permanent_,\nthe former only _transitory_ impressions. The Imagination can recall\nthe one and entertain itself pleasantly therewith; but the other\neither vanish entirely, or if they are recalled involuntarily by the\nImagination they are rather wearisome than pleasant.[93] Besides,\nthere attaches to Music a certain want of urbanity from the fact\nthat, chiefly from the character of its instruments, it extends its\ninfluence further than is desired (in the neighbourhood), and so as it\nwere obtrudes itself, and does violence to the freedom of others who\nare not of the musical company. The Arts which appeal to the eyes do\nnot do this; for we need only turn our eyes away, if we wish to avoid\nbeing impressed. The case of music is almost like that of the delight\nderived from a smell that diffuses itself widely. The man who pulls his\nperfumed handkerchief out of his pocket attracts the attention of all\nround him, even against their will, and he forces them, if they are to\nbreathe at all, to enjoy the scent; hence this habit has gone out of\nfashion.[94]\nAmong the formative arts I would give the palm to painting; partly\nbecause as the art of delineation it lies at the root of all the other\nformative arts, and partly because it can penetrate much further\ninto the region of Ideas, and can extend the field of intuition in\nconformity with them further than the others can.\n\u00a7 54. _Remark_\nAs we have often shown, there is an essential difference between _what\nsatisfies simply in the act of judging it_, and that which _gratifies_\n(pleases in sensation). We cannot ascribe the latter to every one,\nas we can the former. Gratification (the causes of which may even\nbe situate in Ideas) appears always to consist in a feeling of the\nfurtherance of the whole life of the man, and consequently, also of his\nbodily well-being, _i.e._ his health; so that _Epicurus_, who gave out\nthat all gratification was at bottom bodily sensation, may, perhaps,\nnot have been wrong, but only misunderstood himself when he reckoned\nintellectual and even practical satisfaction under gratification. If we\nhave this distinction in view we can explain how a gratification may\ndissatisfy the man who sensibly feels it (_e.g._ the joy of a needy but\nwell-meaning man at becoming the heir of an affectionate but penurious\nfather); or how a deep grief may satisfy the person experiencing it\n(the sorrow of a widow at the death of her excellent husband); or how\na gratification can in addition satisfy (as in the sciences that we\npursue); or how a grief (_e.g._ hatred, envy, revenge) can moreover\ndissatisfy. The satisfaction or dissatisfaction here depends on Reason,\nand is the same as _approbation_ or _disapprobation_; but gratification\nand grief can only rest on the feeling or prospect of a possible (on\nwhatever grounds) _well-being_ or _its opposite_.\nAll changing free play of sensations (that have no design at their\nbasis) gratifies, because it promotes the feeling of health. In the\njudgement of Reason we may or may not have any satisfaction in its\nobject or even in this gratification; and this latter may rise to the\nheight of an affection, although we take no interest in the object,\nat least none that is proportionate to the degree of the affection.\nWe may subdivide this free play of sensations into the _play of\nfortune_ [games of chance], the _play of tone_ [music], and the _play\nof thought_ [wit]. The _first_ requires an _interest_, whether of\nvanity or of selfishness; which, however, is not nearly so great as the\ninterest that attaches to the way in which we are striving to procure\nit. The _second_ requires merely the change of _sensations_, all of\nwhich have a relation to affection, though they have not the degree of\naffection, and excite aesthetical Ideas. The _third_ springs merely\nfrom the change of representations in the Judgement; by it, indeed, no\nthought that brings an interest with it is produced, but yet the mind\nis animated thereby.\nHow much gratification games must afford, without any necessity of\nplacing at their basis an interested design, all our evening parties\nshow; for hardly any of them can be carried on without a game. But the\naffections of hope, fear, joy, wrath, scorn, are put in play by them,\nalternating every moment; and they are so vivid that by them, as by\na kind of internal motion, all the vital processes of the body seem\nto be promoted, as is shown by the mental vivacity excited by them,\nalthough nothing is gained or learnt thereby. But as the beautiful does\nnot enter into games of chance, we will here set them aside. On the\nother hand, music and that which excites laughter are two different\nkinds of play with aesthetical Ideas, or with representations of the\nUnderstanding through which ultimately nothing is thought; and yet\nthey can give lively gratification merely by their changes. Thus we\nrecognise pretty clearly that the animation in both cases is merely\nbodily, although it is excited by Ideas of the mind; and that the\nfeeling of health produced by a motion of the intestines corresponding\nto the play in question makes up that whole gratification of a gay\nparty, which is regarded as so refined and so spiritual. It is not the\njudging the harmony in tones or sallies of wit,--which serves only\nin combination with their beauty as a necessary vehicle,--but the\nfurtherance of the vital bodily processes, the affection that moves\nthe intestines and the diaphragm, in a word, the feeling of health\n(which without such inducements one does not feel) that makes up the\ngratification felt by us; so that we can thus reach the body through\nthe soul and use the latter as the physician of the former.\nIn music this play proceeds from bodily sensations to aesthetical Ideas\n(the Objects of our affections), and then from these back again to the\nbody with redoubled force. In the case of jokes (the art of which,\njust like music, should rather be reckoned as pleasant than beautiful)\nthe play begins with the thoughts which together occupy the body, so\nfar as they admit of sensible expression; and as the Understanding\nstops suddenly short at this presentment, in which it does not find\nwhat it expected, we feel the effect of this slackening in the body\nby the oscillation of the organs, which promotes the restoration of\nequilibrium and has a favourable influence upon health.\nIn everything that is to excite a lively convulsive laugh there must\nbe something absurd (in which the Understanding, therefore, can find\nno satisfaction). _Laughter is an affection arising from the sudden\ntransformation of a strained expectation into nothing._[95] This\ntransformation, which is certainly not enjoyable by the Understanding,\nyet indirectly gives it very active enjoyment for a moment. Therefore\nits cause must consist in the influence of the representation upon the\nbody, and the reflex effect of this upon the mind; not, indeed, through\nthe representation being objectively an object of gratification[96]\n(for how could a delusive expectation gratify?), but simply through it\nas a mere play of representations bringing about an equilibrium of the\nvital powers in the body.\nSuppose this story to be told: An Indian at the table of an Englishman\nin Surat, when he saw a bottle of ale opened and all the beer turned\ninto froth and overflowing, testified his great astonishment with many\nexclamations. When the Englishman asked him, \u201cWhat is there in this\nto astonish you so much?\u201d he answered, \u201cI am not at all astonished\nthat it should flow out, but I do wonder how you ever got it in.\u201d At\nthis story we laugh, and it gives us hearty pleasure; not because\nwe deem ourselves cleverer than this ignorant man, or because of\nanything else in it that we note as satisfactory to the Understanding,\nbut because our expectation was strained [for a time] and then was\nsuddenly dissipated into nothing. Again: The heir of a rich relative\nwished to arrange for an imposing funeral, but he lamented that he\ncould not properly succeed; \u201cfor\u201d (said he) \u201cthe more money I give\nmy mourners to look sad, the more cheerful they look!\u201d[97] When we\nhear this story we laugh loud, and the reason is that an expectation\nis suddenly transformed into nothing. We must note well that it\ndoes not transform itself into the positive opposite of an expected\nobject--for then there would still be something, which might even be\na cause of grief--but it must be transformed into nothing. For if a\nman arouses great expectations in us when telling a story, and at the\nend we see its falsehood immediately, it displeases us; _e.g._ the\nstory of the people whose hair in consequence of great grief turned\ngray in one night. But if a wag, to repair the effect of this story,\ndescribes very circumstantially the grief of the merchant returning\nfrom India to Europe with all his wealth in merchandise who was forced\nto throw it overboard in a heavy storm, and who grieved thereat so\nmuch that his _wig_ turned gray the same night--we laugh and it gives\nus gratification. For we treat our own mistake in the case of an\nobject otherwise indifferent to us, or rather the Idea which we are\nfollowing out, as we treat a ball which we knock to and fro for a\ntime, though our only serious intention is to seize it and hold it\nfast. It is not the mere rebuff of a liar or a simpleton that arouses\nour gratification; for the latter story told with assumed seriousness\nwould set a whole company in a roar of laughter, while the former would\nordinarily not be regarded as worth attending to.\nIt is remarkable that in all such cases the jest must contain something\nthat is capable of deceiving for a moment. Hence, when the illusion is\ndissipated, the mind turns back to try it once again, and thus through\na rapidly alternating tension and relaxation it is jerked back and\nput into a state of oscillation. This, because the strain on the cord\nas it were is suddenly (and not gradually) relaxed, must occasion a\nmental movement, and an inner bodily movement harmonising therewith,\nwhich continues involuntarily and fatigues, even while cheering us (the\neffects of a motion conducive to health).\nFor if we admit that with all our thoughts is harmonically combined\na movement in the organs of the body, we shall easily comprehend how\nto this sudden transposition of the mind, now to one now to another\nstandpoint in order to contemplate its object, may correspond an\nalternating tension and relaxation of the elastic portions of our\nintestines, which communicates itself to the diaphragm (like that which\nticklish people feel). In connexion with this the lungs expel the\nair at rapidly succeeding intervals, and thus bring about a movement\nbeneficial to health; which alone, and not what precedes it in the\nmind, is the proper cause of the gratification in a thought that at\nbottom represents nothing.--_Voltaire_ said that heaven had given us\ntwo things to counterbalance the many miseries of life, _hope_ and\n_sleep_.[98] He could have added _laughter_, if the means of exciting\nit in reasonable men were only as easily attainable, and the requisite\nwit or originality of humour were not so rare, as the talent is common\nof imagining things which _break one\u2019s head_, as mystic dreamers do, or\nwhich _break one\u2019s neck_, as your genius does, or which _break one\u2019s\nheart_, as sentimental romance-writers (and even moralists of the same\nkidney) do.\nWe may therefore, as it seems to me, readily concede to _Epicurus_\nthat all gratification, even that which is occasioned through concepts,\nexcited by aesthetical Ideas, is _animal_, _i.e._ bodily sensation;\nwithout the least prejudice to the _spiritual_ feeling of respect for\nmoral Ideas, which is not gratification at all but an esteem for self\n(for humanity in us), that raises us above the need of gratification,\nand even without the slightest prejudice to the less noble [feeling] of\n_taste_.\nWe find a combination of these two last in _naivet\u00e9_, which is the\nbreaking out of the sincerity originally natural to humanity in\nopposition to that art of dissimulation which has become a second\nnature. We laugh at the simplicity that does not understand how\nto dissemble; and yet we are delighted with the simplicity of the\nnature which thwarts that art. We look for the commonplace manner of\nartificial utterance devised with foresight to make a fair show; and\nbehold! it is the unspoiled innocent nature which we do not expect to\nfind, and which he who displays it did not think of disclosing. That\nthe fair but false show which generally has so much influence upon\nour judgement is here suddenly transformed into nothing, so that, as\nit were, the rogue in us is laid bare, produces a movement of the\nmind in two opposite directions, which gives a wholesome shock to the\nbody. But the fact that something infinitely better than all assumed\nmanner, viz. purity of disposition (or at least the tendency thereto),\nis not quite extinguished yet in human nature, blends seriousness and\nhigh esteem with this play of the Judgement. But because it is only\na transitory phenomenon and the veil of dissimulation is soon drawn\nover it again, there is mingled therewith a compassion which is an\nemotion of tenderness; this, as play, readily admits of combination\nwith a good-hearted laugh, and ordinarily is actually so combined, and\nwithal is wont to compensate him who supplies its material for the\nembarrassment which results from not yet being wise after the manner\nof men.--An art that is to be _naive_ is thus a contradiction; but the\nrepresentation of naivet\u00e9 in a fictitious personage is quite possible,\nand is a beautiful though a rare art. Naivet\u00e9 must not be confounded\nwith open-hearted simplicity, which does not artificially spoil nature\nsolely because it does not understand the art of social intercourse.\nThe _humorous_ manner again may be classified as that which, as\nexhilarating us, is near akin to the gratification that proceeds\nfrom laughter; and belongs to the originality of spirit, but not to\nthe talent of beautiful art. _Humour_ in the good sense means the\ntalent of being able voluntarily to put oneself into a certain mental\ndisposition, in which everything is judged quite differently from the\nordinary method (reversed, in fact), and yet in accordance with certain\nrational principles in such a frame of mind. He who is involuntarily\nsubject to such mutations is called _a man of humours_ [launisch]; but\nhe who can assume them voluntarily and purposively (on behalf of a\nlively presentment brought about by the aid of a contrast that excites\na laugh)--he and his manner of speech are called _humorous_ [launigt].\nThis manner, however, belongs rather to pleasant than to beautiful art,\nbecause the object of the latter must always exhibit intrinsic worth,\nand hence requires a certain seriousness in the presentation, as taste\ndoes in the act of judgement.\nSECOND DIVISION\nDIALECTIC OF THE AESTHETICAL JUDGEMENT\n\u00a7 55\nA faculty of Judgement that is to be dialectical must in the\nfirst place be rationalising, _i.e._ its judgements must claim\nuniversality[99] and that _a priori_; for it is in the opposition of\nsuch judgements that Dialectic consists. Hence the incompatibility of\naesthetical judgements of Sense (about the pleasant and the unpleasant)\nis not dialectical. And again, the conflict between judgements of\nTaste, so far as each man depends merely on his own taste, forms no\nDialectic of taste; because no one proposes to make his own judgement a\nuniversal rule. There remains therefore no other concept of a Dialectic\nwhich has to do with taste than that of a Dialectic of the _Critique_\nof taste (not of taste itself) in respect of its _principles_; for\nhere concepts that contradict one another (as to the ground of\nthe possibility of judgements of taste in general) naturally and\nunavoidably present themselves. The transcendental Critique of taste\nwill therefore contain a part which can bear the name of a Dialectic\nof the aesthetical Judgement, only if and so far as there is found an\nantinomy of the principles of this faculty which renders its conformity\nto law, and consequently also its internal possibility, doubtful.\n\u00a7 56. _Representation of the antinomy of Taste_\nThe first commonplace of taste is contained in the proposition, with\nwhich every tasteless person proposes to avoid blame: _every one has\nhis own taste_. That is as much as to say that the determining ground\nof this judgement is merely subjective (gratification or grief), and\nthat the judgement has no right to the necessary assent of others.\nThe second commonplace invoked even by those who admit for judgements\nof taste the right to speak with validity for every one is: _there\nis no disputing about taste_. That is as much as to say that the\ndetermining ground of a judgement of taste may indeed be objective, but\nthat it cannot be reduced to definite concepts, and that consequently\nabout the judgement itself nothing can be _decided_ by proofs, although\nmuch may rightly be _contested_. For _contesting_ [quarrelling] and\n_disputing_ [controversy] are doubtless the same in this, that by means\nof the mutual opposition of judgements they seek to produce their\naccordance; but different in that the latter hopes to bring this about\naccording to definite concepts as determining grounds, and consequently\nassumes _objective concepts_ as grounds of the judgement. But where\nthis is regarded as impracticable, controversy is regarded as alike\nimpracticable.\nWe easily see that between these two commonplaces there is a\nproposition wanting, which, though it has not passed into a proverb,\nis yet familiar to every one, viz. _there may be a quarrel about\ntaste_ (although there can be no controversy). But this proposition\ninvolves the contradictory of the former one. For wherever quarrelling\nis permissible, there must be a hope of mutual reconciliation; and\nconsequently we can count on grounds of our judgement that have not\nmerely private validity, and therefore are not merely subjective. And\nto this the proposition, _every one has his own taste_, is directly\nopposed.\nThere emerges therefore in respect of the principle of taste the\nfollowing Antinomy:--\n(1) _Thesis._ The judgement of taste is not based upon concepts; for\notherwise it would admit of controversy (would be determinable by\nproofs).\n(2) _Antithesis._ The judgement of taste is based on concepts; for\notherwise, despite its diversity, we could not quarrel about it (we\ncould not claim for our judgement the necessary assent of others).\n\u00a7 57. _Solution of the antinomy of Taste_\nThere is no possibility of removing the conflict between these\nprinciples that underlie every judgement of taste (which are nothing\nelse than the two peculiarities of the judgement of taste exhibited\nabove in the Analytic), except by showing that the concept to which we\nrefer the Object in this kind of judgement is not taken in the same\nsense in both maxims of the aesthetical Judgement. This twofold sense\nor twofold point of view is necessary to our transcendental Judgement;\nbut also the illusion which arises from the confusion of one with the\nother is natural and unavoidable.\nThe judgement of taste must refer to some concept; otherwise it could\nmake absolutely no claim to be necessarily valid for every one. But\nit is not therefore capable of being proved _from_ a concept; because\na concept may be either determinable or in itself undetermined and\nundeterminable. The concepts of the Understanding are of the former\nkind; they are determinable through predicates of sensible intuition\nwhich can correspond to them. But the transcendental rational concept\nof the supersensible, which lies at the basis of all sensible\nintuition, is of the latter kind, and therefore cannot be theoretically\ndetermined further.\nNow the judgement of taste is applied to objects of Sense, but not with\na view of determining a _concept_ of them for the Understanding; for\nit is not a cognitive judgement. It is thus only a private judgement,\nin which a singular representation intuitively perceived is referred\nto the feeling of pleasure; and so far would be limited as regards its\nvalidity to the individual judging. The object is _for me_ an object of\nsatisfaction; by others it may be regarded quite differently--every one\nhas his own taste.\nNevertheless there is undoubtedly contained in the judgement of taste\na wider reference of the representation of the Object (as well as of\nthe subject), whereon we base an extension of judgements of this kind\nas necessary for every one. At the basis of this there must necessarily\nbe a concept somewhere; though a concept which cannot be determined\nthrough intuition. But through a concept of this sort we know nothing,\nand consequently it can _supply no proof_ for the judgement of taste.\nSuch a concept is the mere pure rational concept of the supersensible\nwhich underlies the object (and also the subject judging it), regarded\nas an Object of sense and thus as phenomenon.[100] For if we do\nnot admit such a reference, the claim of the judgement of taste to\nuniversal validity would not hold good. If the concept on which it is\nbased were only a mere confused concept of the Understanding, like that\nof perfection, with which we could bring the sensible intuition of the\nBeautiful into correspondence, it would be at least possible in itself\nto base the judgement of taste on proofs; which contradicts the thesis.\nBut all contradiction disappears if I say: the judgement of taste is\nbased on a concept (viz. the concept of the general ground of the\nsubjective purposiveness of nature for the Judgement); from which,\nhowever, nothing can be known and proved in respect of the Object,\nbecause it is in itself undeterminable and useless for knowledge. Yet\nat the same time and on that very account the judgement has validity\nfor every one (though of course for each only as a singular judgement\nimmediately accompanying his intuition); because its determining ground\nlies perhaps in the concept of that which may be regarded as the\nsupersensible substrate of humanity.\nThe solution of an antinomy only depends on the possibility of showing\nthat two apparently contradictory propositions do not contradict\none another in fact, but that they may be consistent; although the\nexplanation of the possibility of their concept may transcend our\ncognitive faculties. That this illusion is natural and unavoidable\nby human Reason, and also why it is so, and remains so, although it\nceases to deceive after the analysis of the apparent contradiction, may\nbe thus explained.\nIn the two contradictory judgements we take the concept, on which the\nuniversal validity of a judgement must be based, in the same sense; and\nyet we apply to it two opposite predicates. In the Thesis we mean that\nthe judgement of taste is not based upon _determinate_ concepts; and\nin the Antithesis that the judgement of taste is based upon a concept,\nbut an _indeterminate_ one (viz. of the supersensible substrate of\nphenomena). Between these two there is no contradiction.\nWe can do nothing more than remove this conflict between the claims and\ncounter-claims of taste. It is absolutely impossible to give a definite\nobjective principle of taste, in accordance with which its judgements\ncould be derived, examined, and established; for then the judgement\nwould not be one of taste at all. The subjective principle, viz. the\nindefinite Idea of the supersensible in us, can only be put forward as\nthe sole key to the puzzle of this faculty whose sources are hidden\nfrom us: it can be made no further intelligible.\nThe proper concept of taste, that is of a merely reflective aesthetical\nJudgement, lies at the basis of the antinomy here exhibited and\nadjusted. Thus the two apparently contradictory principles are\nreconciled--_both can be true_; which is sufficient. If, on the other\nhand, we assume, as some do, _pleasantness_ as the determining ground\nof taste (on account of the singularity of the representation which\nlies at the basis of the judgement of taste), or, as others will\nhave it, the principle of perfection (on account of the universality\nof the same), and settle the definition of taste accordingly; then\nthere arises an antinomy which it is absolutely impossible to adjust\nexcept by showing that _both_ the contrary (though not contradictory)\n_propositions are false_. And this would prove that the concept on\nwhich they are based is self-contradictory. Hence we see that the\nremoval of the antinomy of the aesthetical Judgement takes a course\nsimilar to that pursued by the Critique in the solution of the\nantinomies of pure theoretical Reason. And thus here, as also in the\nCritique of practical Reason, the antinomies force us against our will\nto look beyond the sensible and to seek in the supersensible the point\nof union for all our _a priori_ faculties; because no other expedient\nis left to make our Reason harmonious with itself.\n_Remark I._\nAs we so often find occasion in Transcendental Philosophy for\ndistinguishing Ideas from concepts of the Understanding, it may be of\nuse to introduce technical terms to correspond to this distinction.\nI believe that no one will object if I propose some.--In the most\nuniversal signification of the word, Ideas are representations referred\nto an object, according to a certain (subjective or objective)\nprinciple, but so that they can never become a cognition of it.\nThey are either referred to an intuition, according to a merely\nsubjective principle of the mutual harmony of the cognitive powers\n(the Imagination and the Understanding), and they are then called\n_aesthetical_; or they are referred to a concept according to an\nobjective principle, although they can never furnish a cognition of\nthe object and are called _rational Ideas_. In the latter case the\nconcept is a _transcendent_ one, which is different from a concept of\nthe Understanding, to which an adequately corresponding experience can\nalways be supplied, and which therefore is called _immanent_.\nAn _aesthetical Idea_ cannot become a cognition, because it is an\n_intuition_ (of the Imagination) for which an adequate concept can\nnever be found. A _rational Idea_ can never become a cognition, because\nit involves a concept (of the supersensible), corresponding to which an\nintuition can never be given.\nNow I believe we might call the aesthetical Idea an _inexponible_\nrepresentation of the Imagination, and a rational Idea an\n_indemonstrable_ concept of Reason. It is assumed of both that they are\nnot generated without grounds, but (according to the above explanation\nof an Idea in general) in conformity with certain principles of the\ncognitive faculties to which they belong (subjective principles in the\none case, objective in the other).\n_Concepts of the Understanding_ must, as such, always be demonstrable\n[if by demonstration we understand, as in anatomy, merely\n_presentation_];[101] _i.e._ the object corresponding to them must\nalways be capable of being given in intuition (pure or empirical); for\nthus alone could they become cognitions. The concept of _magnitude_\ncan be given _a priori_ in the intuition of space, _e.g._ of a right\nline, etc.; the concept of _cause_ in impenetrability, in the collision\nof bodies, etc. Consequently both can be authenticated by means of\nan empirical intuition, _i.e._ the thought of them can be proved\n(demonstrated, verified) by an example; and this must be possible,\nfor otherwise we should not be certain that the concept was not empty,\n_i.e._ devoid of any _Object_.\nIn Logic we ordinarily use the expressions demonstrable or\nindemonstrable only in respect of _propositions_, but these might\nbe better designated by the titles respectively of _mediately and\nimmediately certain_ propositions; for pure Philosophy has also\npropositions of both kinds, _i.e._ true propositions, some of which\nare susceptible of proof and others not. It can, as philosophy, prove\nthem on _a priori_ grounds, but it cannot demonstrate them; unless\nwe wish to depart entirely from the proper meaning of this word,\naccording to which _to demonstrate_ (_ostendere_, _exhibere_) is\nequivalent to presenting a concept in intuition (whether in proof or\nmerely in definition). If the intuition is _a priori_ this is called\nconstruction; but if it is empirical, then the Object is displayed by\nmeans of which objective reality is assured to the concept. Thus we say\nof an anatomist that he demonstrates the human eye, if by a dissection\nof this organ he makes intuitively evident the concept which he has\npreviously treated discursively.\nIt hence follows that the rational concept of the supersensible\nsubstrate of all phenomena in general, or even of that which must be\nplaced at the basis of our arbitrary will in respect of the moral law,\nviz. of transcendental freedom, is already, in kind, an indemonstrable\nconcept and a rational Idea; while virtue is so, in degree. For there\ncan be given in experience, as regards its quality, absolutely nothing\ncorresponding to the former; whereas in the latter case no empirical\nproduct attains to the degree of that causality, which the rational\nIdea prescribes as the rule.\nAs in a rational Idea the _Imagination_ with its intuitions does\nnot attain to the given concept, so in an aesthetical Idea the\n_Understanding_ by its concepts never attains completely to that\ninternal intuition which the Imagination binds up with a given\nrepresentation. Since, now, to reduce a representation of the\nImagination to concepts is the same thing as to _expound_ it, the\naesthetical Idea may be called an _inexponible_ representation of the\nImagination (in its free play). I shall have occasion in the sequel to\nsay something more of Ideas of this kind; now I only note that both\nkinds of Ideas, rational and aesthetical, must have their principles;\nand must have them in Reason--the one in the objective, the other in\nthe subjective principles of its employment.\nWe can consequently explain _genius_ as the faculty of _aesthetical\nIdeas_; by which at the same time is shown the reason why in the\nproducts of genius it is the nature (of the subject) and not a\npremeditated purpose that gives the rule to the art (of the production\nof the beautiful). For since the beautiful must not be judged by\nconcepts, but by the purposive attuning of the Imagination to agreement\nwith the faculty of concepts in general, it cannot be rule and precept\nwhich can serve as the subjective standard of that aesthetical but\nunconditioned purposiveness in beautiful art, that can rightly claim\nto please every one. It can only be that in the subject which is\nnature and cannot be brought under rules or concepts, _i.e._ the\nsupersensible substrate of all his faculties (to which no concept of\nthe Understanding extends), and consequently that with respect to which\nit is the final purpose given by the intelligible [part] of our nature\nto harmonise all our cognitive faculties. Thus alone is it possible\nthat there should be _a priori_ at the basis of this purposiveness, for\nwhich we can prescribe no objective principle, a principle subjective\nand yet of universal validity.\n_Remark II._\nThe following important remark occurs here: There are _three kinds of\nAntinomies_ of pure Reason, which, however, all agree in this, that\nthey compel us to give up the otherwise very natural hypothesis that\nobjects of sense are things in themselves, and force us to regard them\nmerely as phenomena, and to supply to them an intelligible substrate\n(something supersensible of which the concept is only an Idea, and\nsupplies no proper knowledge). Without such antinomies Reason could\nnever decide upon accepting a principle narrowing so much the field of\nits speculation, and could never bring itself to sacrifices by which so\nmany otherwise brilliant hopes must disappear. For even now when, by\nway of compensation for these losses, a greater field in a practical\naspect opens out before it, it appears not to be able without grief to\npart from those hopes, and disengage itself from its old attachment.\nThat there are three kinds of antinomies has its ground in this, that\nthere are three cognitive faculties,--Understanding, Judgement, and\nReason; of which each (as a superior cognitive faculty) must have\nits _a priori_ principles. For Reason, in so far as it judges of\nthese principles and their use, inexorably requires, in respect of\nthem all, the unconditioned for the given conditioned; and this can\nnever be found if we consider the sensible as belonging to things\nin themselves, and do not rather supply to it, as mere phenomenon,\nsomething supersensible (the intelligible substrate of nature both\nexternal and internal) as the reality in itself [Sache an sich selbst].\nThere are then: (1) _For the cognitive faculty_ an antinomy of Reason\nin respect of the theoretical employment of the Understanding extended\nto the unconditioned; (2) _for the feeling of pleasure and pain_ an\nantinomy of Reason in respect of the aesthetical employment of the\nJudgement; and (3) _for the faculty of desire_ an antinomy in respect\nof the practical employment of the self-legislative Reason; so far as\nall these faculties have their superior principles _a priori_, and, in\nconformity with an inevitable requirement of Reason, must judge and be\nable to determine their Object, _unconditionally_ according to those\nprinciples.\nAs for the two antinomies of the theoretical and practical employment\nof the superior cognitive faculties, we have already shown their\n_unavoidableness_, if judgements of this kind are not referred to\na supersensible substrate of the given Objects, as phenomena; and\nalso the _possibility of their solution_, as soon as this is done.\nAnd as for the antinomies in the employment of the Judgement, in\nconformity with the requirements of Reason, and their solution which\nis here given, there are only two ways of avoiding them. _Either_:\nwe must deny that any _a priori_ principle lies at the basis of the\naesthetical judgement of taste; we must maintain that all claim to\nnecessary universal agreement is a groundless and vain fancy, and that\na judgement of taste only deserves to be regarded as correct because\n_it happens_ that many people agree about it; and this, not because we\n_assume_ an _a priori_ principle behind this agreement, but because\n(as in the taste of the palate) of the contingent similar organisation\nof the different subjects. _Or_: we must assume that the judgement of\ntaste is really a disguised judgement of Reason upon the perfection\ndiscovered in a thing and the reference of the manifold in it to a\npurpose, and is consequently only called aesthetical on account of the\nconfusion here attaching to our reflection, although it is at bottom\nteleological. In the latter case we could declare the solution of the\nantinomies by means of transcendental Ideas to be needless and without\npoint, and thus could harmonise these laws of taste with Objects of\nsense, not as mere phenomena but as things in themselves. But we have\nshown in several places in the exposition of judgements of taste how\nlittle either of these expedients will satisfy.\nHowever, if it be granted that our deduction at least proceeds by the\nright method, although it be not yet plain enough in all its parts,\nthree Ideas manifest themselves. _First_, there is the Idea of the\nsupersensible in general, without any further determination of it, as\nthe substrate of nature. _Secondly_, there is the Idea of the same\nas the principle of the subjective purposiveness of nature for our\ncognitive faculty. And _thirdly_, there is the Idea of the same as the\nprinciple of the purposes of freedom, and of the agreement of freedom\nwith its purposes in the moral sphere.\n\u00a7 58. _Of the Idealism of the purposiveness of both Nature and Art as\nthe unique principle of the aesthetical Judgement_\nTo begin with, we can either place the principle of taste in the fact\nthat it always judges in accordance with grounds which are empirical\nand therefore are only given _a posteriori_ by sense, or concede that\nit judges on _a priori_ grounds. The former would be the _empiricism_\nof the Critique of Taste; the latter its _rationalism_. According to\nthe _former_ the Object of our satisfaction would not differ from\nthe _pleasant_; according to the latter, if the judgement rests on\ndefinite concepts, it would not differ from the _good_. Thus all\n_beauty_ would be banished from the world, and only a particular name,\nexpressing perhaps a certain mingling of the two above-named kinds of\nsatisfaction, would remain in its place. But we have shown that there\nare also _a priori_ grounds of satisfaction which can subsist along\nwith the principle of rationalism, although they cannot be comprehended\nin _definite concepts_.\nOn the other hand, the rationalism of the principle of taste is either\nthat of the _realism_ of the purposiveness, or of its _idealism_.\nBecause a judgement of taste is not a cognitive judgement, and beauty\nis not a characteristic of the Object, considered in itself, the\nrationalism of the principle of taste can never be placed in the fact\nthat the purposiveness in this judgement is thought as objective,\n_i.e._ that the judgement theoretically, and therefore also logically\n(although only in a confused way), refers to the perfection of the\nObject. It only refers _aesthetically_ to the agreement of the\nrepresentation of the Object in the Imagination with the essential\nprinciples of Judgement in general in the subject. Consequently, even\naccording to the principle of rationalism, the judgement of taste\nand the distinction between its realism and idealism can only be\nsettled thus. Either in the first case, this subjective purposiveness\nis assumed as an actual (designed) _purpose_ of nature (or art)\nharmonising with our Judgement; or, in the second case, as a purposive\nharmony with the needs of Judgement, in respect of nature and its forms\nproduced according to particular laws, which shows itself, without\npurpose, spontaneously, and contingently.\nThe beautiful formations in the kingdom of organised nature speak\nloudly for the realism of the aesthetical purposiveness of nature;\nsince we might assume that behind the production of the beautiful there\nis an Idea of the beautiful in the producing cause, viz. a _purpose_\nin respect of our Imagination. Flowers, blossoms, even the shapes\nof entire plants; the elegance of animal formations of all kinds,\nunneeded for their proper use, but, as it were, selected for our taste;\nespecially the charming variety so satisfying to the eye and the\nharmonious arrangement of colours (in the pheasant, in shell-fish, in\ninsects, even in the commonest flowers), which, as it only concerns the\nsurface and not the figure of these creations (though perhaps requisite\nin regard of their internal purposes), seems to be entirely designed\nfor external inspection; these things give great weight to that mode of\nexplanation which assumes actual purposes of nature for our aesthetical\nJudgement.\nOn the other hand, not only is Reason opposed to this assumption in\nits maxims, which bid us always avoid as far as possible unnecessary\nmultiplication of principles; but nature everywhere shows in its\nfree formations much mechanical tendency to the productions of forms\nwhich seem, as it were, to be made for the aesthetical exercise of\nour Judgement, without affording the least ground for the supposition\nthat there is need of anything more than its mechanism, merely as\nnature, according to which, without any Idea lying at their root,\nthey can be purposive for our judgement. But I understand by _free\nformations_ of nature _those_ whereby from a _fluid at rest_, through\nthe volatilisation or separation of a portion of its constituents\n(sometimes merely of caloric), the remainder in becoming solid\nassumes a definite shape or tissue (figure or texture), which is\ndifferent according to the specific difference of the material, but\nin the same material is constant. Here it is always presupposed that\nwe are speaking of a perfect fluid, _i.e._ that the material in it\nis completely dissolved, and that it is not a mere medley of solid\nparticles in a state of suspension.\nFormation, then, takes place by a _shooting together_, _i.e._ by a\nsudden solidification, not by a gradual transition from the fluid to\nthe solid state, but all at once by a _saltus_; which transition is\nalso called _crystallisation_. The commonest example of this kind of\nformation is the freezing of water, where first icicles are produced,\nwhich combine at angles of 60\u00b0, while others attach themselves to each\nvertex, until it all becomes ice; and so that, while this is going\non, the water does not gradually become viscous, but is as perfectly\nfluid as if its temperature were far higher, although it is absolutely\nice-cold. The matter that disengages itself, which is dissipated\nsuddenly at the moment of solidification, is a considerable quantum\nof caloric, the disappearance of which, as it was only required for\npreserving fluidity, leaves the new ice not in the least colder than\nthe water which shortly before was fluid.\nMany salts, and also rocks, of a crystalline figure, are produced thus\nfrom a species of earth dissolved in water, we do not exactly know\nhow. Thus are formed the glandular configurations of many minerals,\nthe cubical sulphide of lead, the ruby silver ore, etc., in all\nprobability in water and by the shooting together of particles, as they\nbecome forced by some cause to dispense with this vehicle and to unite\nin definite external shapes.\nBut also all kinds of matter, which have been kept in a fluid state\nby heat, and have become solid by cooling, show internally, when\nfractured, a definite texture. This makes us judge that if their own\nweight or the disturbance of the air had not prevented it, they would\nalso have exhibited on the outer surface their specifically peculiar\nshapes. This has been observed in some metals on their inner surface,\nwhich have been hardened externally by fusion but are fluid in the\ninterior, by the drawing off the internal fluid and the consequent\nundisturbed crystallisation of the remainder. Many of these mineral\ncrystallisations, such as spars, hematite, arragonite, etc., often\npresent beautiful shapes, the like of which art can only conceive; and\nthe halo in the cavern of Antiparos[102] is merely produced by water\ntrickling down strata of gypsum.\nThe fluid state is, to all appearance, older than the solid state, and\nplants as well as animal bodies are fashioned out of fluid nutritive\nmatter, so far as this forms itself in a state of rest. This last\nof course primarily combines and forms itself in freedom according\nto a certain original disposition directed towards purposes (which,\nas will be shown in Part II., must not be judged aesthetically but\nteleologically according to the principle of realism), but also perhaps\nin conformity with the universal law of the affinity of materials.\nAgain, the watery fluids dissolved in an atmosphere that is a mixture\nof different gases, if they separate from the latter on account of\ncooling, produce snow figures, which in correspondence with the\ncharacter of the special mixture of gases, often seem very artistic and\nare extremely beautiful. So, without detracting from the teleological\nprinciple by which we judge of organisation, we may well think that\nthe beauty of flowers, of the plumage of birds, or of shell-fish,\nboth in shape and colour, may be ascribed to nature and its faculty\nof producing forms in an aesthetically purposive way, in its freedom,\nwithout particular purposes adapted thereto, according to chemical laws\nby the arrangement of the material requisite for the organisation in\nquestion.\nBut what shows the principle of the _Ideality_ of the purposiveness in\nthe beauty of nature, as that which we always place at the basis of\nan aesthetical judgement, and which allows us to employ, as a ground\nof explanation for our representative faculty, no realism of purpose,\nis the fact that in judging beauty we invariably seek its gauge in\nourselves _a priori_, and that our aesthetical Judgement is itself\nlegislative in respect of the judgement whether anything is beautiful\nor not. This could not be, on the assumption of the Realism of the\npurposiveness of nature; because in that case we must have learned from\nnature what we ought to find beautiful, and the aesthetical judgement\nwould be subjected to empirical principles. For in such an act of\njudging the important point is not, what nature is, or even, as a\npurpose, is in relation to us, but how we take it. There would be an\nobjective purposiveness in nature if it had fashioned its forms for our\nsatisfaction; and not a subjective purposiveness which depended upon\nthe play of the Imagination in its freedom, where it is we who receive\nnature with favour, not nature which shows us favour. The property\nof nature that gives us occasion to perceive the inner purposiveness\nin the relation of our mental faculties in judging certain of its\nproducts--a purposiveness which is to be explained on supersensible\ngrounds as necessary and universal--cannot be a natural purpose or be\njudged by us as such; for otherwise the judgement hereby determined\nwould not be free, and would have at its basis heteronomy, and not, as\nbeseems a judgement of taste, autonomy.\nIn beautiful Art the principle of the Idealism of purposiveness\nis still clearer. As in the case of the beautiful in Nature, an\naesthetical Realism of this purposiveness cannot be perceived by\nsensations (for then the art would be only pleasant, not beautiful).\nBut that the satisfaction produced by aesthetical Ideas must not depend\non the attainment of definite purposes (as in mechanically designed\nart), and that consequently, in the very rationalism of the principle,\nthe ideality of the purposes and not their reality must be fundamental,\nappears from the fact that beautiful Art, as such, must not be\nconsidered as a product of Understanding and Science, but of Genius,\nand therefore must get its rule through _aesthetical_ Ideas, which are\nessentially different from rational Ideas of definite purposes.\nJust as the _ideality_ of the objects of sense as phenomena is the only\nway of explaining the possibility of their forms being susceptible\nof _a priori_ determination, so the _idealism_ of purposiveness, in\njudging the beautiful in nature and art, is the only hypothesis under\nwhich Criticism can explain the possibility of a judgement of taste\nwhich demands _a priori_ validity for every one (without grounding on\nconcepts the purposiveness that is represented in the Object).\n\u00a7 59. _Of Beauty as the symbol of Morality_\nIntuitions are always required to establish the reality of our\nconcepts. If the concepts are empirical, the intuitions are called\n_examples_. If they are pure concepts of Understanding, the intuitions\nare called _schemata_. If we desire to establish the objective reality\nof rational concepts, _i.e._ of Ideas, on behalf of theoretical\ncognition, then we are asking for something impossible, because\nabsolutely no intuition can be given which shall be adequate to them.\nAll _hypotyposis_ (presentation, _subjectio sub adspectum_), or\nsensible illustration, is twofold. It is either _schematical_, when to\na concept comprehended by the Understanding the corresponding intuition\nis given _a priori_; or it is _symbolical_. In the latter case to a\nconcept only thinkable by the Reason, to which no sensible intuition\ncan be adequate, an intuition is supplied with which accords a\nprocedure of the Judgement analogous to what it observes in schematism:\nit accords with it, that is, in respect of the rule of this procedure\nmerely, not of the intuition itself; consequently in respect of the\nform of reflection merely, and not of its content.\nThere is a use of the word _symbolical_ that has been adopted by modern\nlogicians, which is misleading and incorrect, _i.e._ to speak of the\n_symbolical_ mode of representation as if it were opposed to the\n_intuitive_; for the symbolical is only a mode of the intuitive. The\nlatter (the intuitive), that is, may be divided into the _schematical_\nand the _symbolical_ modes of representation. Both are hypotyposes,\n_i.e._ presentations (_exhibitiones_); not mere _characterisations_, or\ndesignations of concepts by accompanying sensible signs which contain\nnothing belonging to the intuition of the Object, and only serve as a\nmeans for reproducing the concepts, according to the law of association\nof the Imagination, and consequently in a subjective point of view.\nThese are either words, or visible (algebraical, even mimetical) signs,\nas mere expressions for concepts.[103]\nAll intuitions, which we supply to concepts _a priori_, are therefore\neither _schemata_ or _symbols_, of which the former contain direct,\nthe latter indirect, presentations of the concept. The former do\nthis demonstratively; the latter by means of an analogy (for which\nwe avail ourselves even of empirical intuitions) in which the\nJudgement exercises a double function; first applying the concept\nto the object of a sensible intuition, and then applying the mere\nrule of the reflection made upon that intuition to a quite different\nobject of which the first is only the symbol. Thus a monarchical\nstate is represented by a living body, if it is governed by national\nlaws, and by a mere machine (like a hand-mill) if governed by an\nindividual absolute will; but in both cases only _symbolically_.\nFor between a despotic state and a hand-mill there is, to be sure,\nno similarity; but there is a similarity in the rules according to\nwhich we reflect upon these two things and their causality. This\nmatter has not been sufficiently analysed hitherto, for it deserves\na deeper investigation; but this is not the place to linger over it.\nOur language [_i.e._ German] is full of indirect presentations of\nthis sort, in which the expression does not contain the proper schema\nfor the concept, but merely a symbol for reflection. Thus the words\n_ground_ (support, basis), _to depend_ (to be held up from above), to\n_flow_ from something (instead of, to follow), _substance_ (as _Locke_\nexpresses it, the support of accidents), and countless others, are not\nschematical but symbolical hypotyposes and expressions for concepts,\nnot by means of a direct intuition, but only by analogy with it,\n_i.e._ by the transference of reflection upon an object of intuition\nto a quite different concept to which perhaps an intuition can never\ndirectly correspond. If we are to give the name of cognition to a mere\nmode of representation (which is quite permissible if the latter is\nnot a principle of the theoretical determination of what an object is\nin itself, but of the practical determination of what the Idea of it\nshould be for us and for its purposive use), then all our knowledge\nof God is merely symbolical; and he who regards it as schematical,\nalong with the properties of Understanding, Will, etc., which only\nestablish their objective reality in beings of this world, falls into\nAnthropomorphism, just as he who gives up every intuitive element\nfalls into Deism, by which nothing at all is cognised, not even in a\npractical point of view.\nNow I say the Beautiful is the symbol of the morally Good, and that it\nis only in this respect (a reference which is natural to every man and\nwhich every man postulates in others as a duty) that it gives pleasure\nwith a claim for the agreement of every one else. By this the mind\nis made conscious of a certain ennoblement and elevation above the\nmere sensibility to pleasure received through sense, and the worth of\nothers is estimated in accordance with a like maxim of their Judgement.\nThat is the _intelligible_, to which, as pointed out in the preceding\nparagraph, Taste looks; with which our higher cognitive faculties are\nin accord; and without which a downright contradiction would arise\nbetween their nature and the claims made by taste. In this faculty the\nJudgement does not see itself, as in empirical judging, subjected to\na heteronomy of empirical laws; it gives the law to itself in respect\nof the objects of so pure a satisfaction, just as the Reason does in\nrespect of the faculty of desire. Hence, both on account of this inner\npossibility in the subject and of the external possibility of a nature\nthat agrees with it, it finds itself to be referred to something within\nthe subject as well as without him, something which is neither nature\nnor freedom, but which yet is connected with the supersensible ground\nof the latter. In this supersensible ground, therefore, the theoretical\nfaculty is bound together in unity with the practical, in a way which\nthough common is yet unknown. We shall indicate some points of this\nanalogy, while at the same time we shall note the differences.\n(1) The beautiful pleases _immediately_ (but only in reflective\nintuition, not, like morality, in its concept). (2) It pleases _apart\nfrom any interest_ (the morally good is indeed necessarily bound up\nwith an interest, though not with one which precedes the judgement upon\nthe satisfaction, but with one which is first of all produced by it).\n(3) The _freedom_ of the Imagination (and therefore of the sensibility\nof our faculty) is represented in judging the beautiful as harmonious\nwith the conformity to law of the Understanding (in the moral judgement\nthe freedom of the will is thought as the harmony of the latter with\nitself according to universal laws of Reason). (4) The subjective\nprinciple in judging the beautiful is represented as _universal_,\n_i.e._ as valid for every man, though not cognisable through any\nuniversal concept. (The objective principle of morality is also\nexpounded as universal, _i.e._ for every subject and for every action\nof the same subject, and thus as cognisable by means of a universal\nconcept). Hence the moral judgement is not only susceptible of definite\nconstitutive principles, but is possible _only_ by grounding its maxims\non these in their universality.\nA reference to this analogy is usual even with the common Understanding\n[of men], and we often describe beautiful objects of nature or art by\nnames that seem to put a moral appreciation at their basis. We call\nbuildings or trees majestic and magnificent, landscapes laughing and\ngay; even colours are called innocent, modest, tender, because they\nexcite sensations which have something analogous to the consciousness\nof the state of mind brought about by moral judgements. Taste makes\npossible the transition, without any violent leap, from the charm of\nSense to habitual moral interest; for it represents the Imagination\nin its freedom as capable of purposive determination for the\nUnderstanding, and so teaches us to find even in objects of sense a\nfree satisfaction apart from any charm of sense.\nAPPENDIX\n\u00a7 60. _Of the method of Taste_\nThe division of a Critique into Elementology and Methodology, as\npreparatory to science, is not applicable to the Critique of taste,\nbecause there neither is nor can be a science of the Beautiful, and\nthe judgement of taste is not determinable by means of principles. As\nfor the scientific element in every art, which regards _truth_ in the\npresentation of its Object, this is indeed the indispensable condition\n(_conditio sine qua non_) of beautiful art, but not beautiful art\nitself. There is therefore for beautiful art only a _manner_ (_modus_),\nnot a _method of teaching_ (_methodus_). The master must show what the\npupil is to do and how he is to do it; and the universal rules, under\nwhich at last he brings his procedure, serve rather for bringing the\nmain points back to his remembrance when occasion requires, than for\nprescribing them to him. Nevertheless regard must be had here to a\ncertain ideal, which art must have before its eyes, although it cannot\nbe completely attained in practice. It is only through exciting the\nImagination of the pupil to accordance with a given concept, by making\nhim note the inadequacy of the expression for the Idea, to which the\nconcept itself does not attain because it is an aesthetical Idea, and\nby severe criticism, that he can be prevented from taking the examples\nset before him as types and models for imitation, to be subjected to\nno higher standard or independent judgement. It is thus that genius,\nand with it the freedom of the Imagination, is stifled by its very\nconformity to law; and without these no beautiful art, and not even an\naccurately judging individual taste, is possible.\nThe propaedeutic to all beautiful art, regarded in the highest degree\nof its perfection, seems to lie, not in precepts, but in the culture\nof the mental powers by means of those elements of knowledge called\n_humaniora_, probably because _humanity_ on the one side indicates\nthe universal _feeling of sympathy_, and on the other the faculty\nof being able to _communicate_ universally our inmost [feelings].\nFor these properties taken together constitute the characteristic\nsocial spirit[104] of humanity by which it is distinguished from the\nlimitations of animal life. The age and peoples, in which the impulse\ntowards a _law-abiding_ social life, by which a people becomes a\npermanent community, contended with the great difficulties presented by\nthe difficult problem of uniting freedom (and therefore equality also)\nwith compulsion (rather of respect and submission from a sense of duty\nthan of fear)--such an age and such a people naturally first found out\nthe art of reciprocal communication of Ideas between the cultivated\nand uncultivated classes and thus discovered how to harmonise the\nlarge-mindedness and refinement of the former with the natural\nsimplicity and originality of the latter. In this way they first found\nthat mean between the higher culture and simple nature which furnishes\nthat true standard for taste as a sense common to all men which no\nuniversal rules can supply.\nWith difficulty will a later age dispense with those models, because\nit will be always farther from nature; and in fine, without having\npermanent examples before it, a concept will hardly be possible, in one\nand the same people, of the happy union of the law-abiding constraint\nof the highest culture with the force and truth of free nature which\nfeels its own proper worth.\nNow taste is at bottom a faculty for judging of the sensible\nillustration of moral Ideas (by means of a certain analogy involved\nin our reflection upon both these); and it is from this faculty also\nand from the greater susceptibility grounded thereon for the feeling\narising from the latter (called moral feeling), that the pleasure is\nderived which taste regards as valid for mankind in general and not\nmerely for the private feeling of each. Hence it appears plain that the\ntrue propaedeutic for the foundation of taste is the development of\nmoral Ideas and the culture of the moral feeling; because it is only\nwhen sensibility is brought into agreement with this that genuine taste\ncan assume a definite invariable form.\nTHE CRITIQUE OF JUDGEMENT\nPART II\nCRITIQUE OF THE TELEOLOGICAL JUDGEMENT\n\u00a7 61. _Of the objective purposiveness of Nature_\nWe have on transcendental principles good ground to assume a subjective\npurposiveness in nature, in its particular laws, in reference to its\ncomprehensibility by human Judgement and to the possibility of the\nconnexion of particular experiences in a system. This may be expected\nas possible in many products of nature, which, as if they were devised\nquite specially for our Judgement, contain a specific form conformable\nthereto; which through their manifoldness and unity serve at once to\nstrengthen and to sustain the mental powers (that come into play in the\nemployment of this faculty); and to which therefore we give the name of\n_beautiful_ forms.\nBut that the things of nature serve one another as means to purposes,\nand that their possibility is only completely intelligible through\nthis kind of causality--for this we have absolutely no ground in the\nuniversal Idea of nature, as the complex of the objects of sense. In\nthe above-mentioned case, the representation of things, because it\nis something in ourselves, can be quite well thought _a priori_ as\nsuitable and useful for the internally purposive determination of our\ncognitive faculties; but that purposes, which neither are our own\nnor belong to nature (for we do not regard nature as an intelligent\nbeing), could or should constitute a particular kind of causality, at\nleast a quite special conformity to law,--this we have absolutely no\n_a priori_ reason for presuming. Yet more, experience itself cannot\nprove to us the actuality of this; there must then have preceded a\nrationalising subtlety which only sportively introduces the concept of\npurpose into the nature of things, but which does not derive it from\nObjects or from their empirical cognition. To this latter it is of\nmore service to make nature comprehensible according to analogy with\nthe subjective ground of the connexion of our representations, than to\ncognise it from objective grounds.\nFurther, objective purposiveness, as a principle of the possibility of\nthings of nature, is so far removed from _necessary_ connexion with\nthe concept of nature, that it is much oftener precisely that upon\nwhich one relies to prove the contingency of nature and of its form.\nWhen, _e.g._ we adduce the structure of a bird, the hollowness of its\nbones, the disposition of its wings for motion and of its tail for\nsteering, _etc._, we say that all this is contingent in the highest\ndegree according to the mere _nexus effectivus_ of nature, without\ncalling in the aid of a particular kind of causality, namely that of\npurpose (_nexus finalis_). In other words, nature, considered as mere\nmechanism, could have produced its forms in a thousand other ways\nwithout stumbling upon the unity which is in accordance with such a\nprinciple. It is not in the concept of nature but quite apart from it\nthat we can hope to find the least ground _a priori_ for this.\nNevertheless the teleological act of judgement is rightly brought to\nbear, at least problematically, upon the investigation of nature;\nbut only in order to bring it under principles of observation and\ninquiry according to the _analogy_ with the causality of purpose,\nwithout any pretence to _explain_ it thereby. It belongs therefore to\nthe reflective and not to the determinant judgement. The concept of\ncombinations and forms of nature in accordance with purposes is then\nat least _one principle more_ for bringing its phenomena under rules\nwhere the laws of simply mechanical causality do not suffice. For we\nbring in a teleological ground, where we attribute causality in respect\nof an Object to the concept of an Object, as if it were to be found in\nnature (not in ourselves); or rather when we represent to ourselves the\npossibility of the Object after the analogy of that causality which\nwe experience in ourselves, and consequently think nature technically\nas through a special faculty. If we did not ascribe to it such a\nmethod of action, its causality would have to be represented as blind\nmechanism. If, on the contrary, we supply to nature causes acting\n_designedly_, and consequently place at its basis teleology, not merely\nas a _regulative_ principle for the mere _judging_ of phenomena, to\nwhich nature can be thought as subject in its particular laws, but as a\n_constitutive_ principle of the _derivation_ of its products from their\ncauses; then would the concept of a natural purpose no longer belong\nto the reflective but to the determinant Judgement. Then, in fact, it\nwould not belong specially to the Judgement (like the concept of beauty\nregarded as formal subjective purposiveness), but as a rational concept\nit would introduce into natural science a new causality, which we only\nborrow from ourselves and ascribe to other beings, without meaning to\nassume them to be of the same kind with ourselves.\nFIRST DIVISION\nANALYTIC OF THE TELEOLOGICAL JUDGEMENT\n\u00a7 62. _Of the objective purposiveness which is merely formal as\ndistinguished from that which is material_\nAll geometrical figures drawn on a principle display a manifold,\noft admired, objective purposiveness; _i.e._ in reference to\ntheir usefulness for the solution of several problems by a single\nprinciple, or of the same problem in an infinite variety of ways. The\npurposiveness is here obviously objective and intellectual, not merely\nsubjective and aesthetical. For it expresses the suitability of the\nfigure for the production of many intended figures, and is cognised\nthrough Reason. But this purposiveness does not make the concept of the\nobject itself possible, _i.e._ it is not regarded as possible merely\nwith reference to this use.\nIn so simple a figure as the circle lies the key to the solution of a\nmultitude of problems, each of which would demand various appliances;\nwhereas the solution results of itself, as it were, as one of the\ninfinite number of elegant properties of this figure. Are we, for\nexample, asked to construct a triangle, being given the base and\nvertical angle? The problem is indeterminate, _i.e._ it can be solved\nin an infinite number of ways. But the circle embraces them altogether\nas the geometrical locus of the vertices of triangles satisfying\nthe given conditions. Again, suppose that two lines are to cut one\nanother so that the rectangle under the segments of the one should be\nequal to the rectangle under the segments of the other; the solution\nof the problem from this point of view presents much difficulty. But\nall chords intersecting inside a circle divide one another in this\n_proportion_. Other curved lines suggest other purposive solutions\nof which nothing was thought in the rule that furnished their\nconstruction. All conic sections in themselves and when compared with\none another are fruitful in principles for the solution of a number of\npossible problems, however simple is the definition which determines\ntheir concept.--It is a true joy to see the zeal with which the old\ngeometers investigated the properties of lines of this class, without\nallowing themselves to be led astray by the questions of narrow-minded\npersons, as to what use this knowledge would be. Thus they worked out\nthe properties of the parabola without knowing the law of gravitation,\nwhich would have suggested to them its application to the trajectory of\nheavy bodies (for the motion of a heavy body can be seen to be parallel\nto the curve of a parabola). Again, they found out the properties\nof an ellipse without surmising that any of the heavenly bodies had\nweight, and without knowing the law of force at different distances\nfrom the point of attraction, which causes it to describe this curve\nin free motion. While they thus unconsciously worked for the science\nof the future, they delighted themselves with a purposiveness in\nthe [essential] being of things which yet they were able to present\ncompletely _a priori_ in its necessity. _Plato_, himself master of\nthis science, hinted at such an original constitution of things in\nthe discovery of which we can dispense with all experience, and at\nthe power of the mind to produce from its supersensible principle the\nharmony of beings (where the properties of number come in, with which\nthe mind plays in music). This [he touches upon] in the inspiration\nthat raised him above the concepts of experience to Ideas, which seem\nto him to be explicable only through an intellectual affinity with the\norigin of all beings. No wonder that he banished from his school the\nman who was ignorant of geometry, since he thought he could derive\nfrom pure intuition, which has its home in the human spirit, that\nwhich _Anaxagoras_ drew from empirical objects and their purposive\ncombination. For in the very necessity of that which is purposive,\nand is constituted just as if it were designedly intended for our\nuse,--but at the same time seems to belong originally to the being\nof things without any reference to our use--lies the ground of our\ngreat admiration of nature, and that not so much external as in our\nown Reason. It is surely excusable that this admiration should through\nmisunderstanding gradually rise to the height of fanaticism.\nBut this intellectual purposiveness, although no doubt objective (not\nsubjective like aesthetical purposiveness), is in reference to its\npossibility merely formal (not real). It can only be conceived as\npurposiveness in general without any [definite] purpose being assumed\nas its basis, and consequently without teleology being needed for it.\nThe figure of a circle is an intuition which is determined by means\nof the Understanding according to a principle. The unity of this\nprinciple which I arbitrarily assume and use as fundamental concept,\napplied to a form of intuition (space) which is met with in myself as\na representation and yet _a priori_, renders intelligible the unity of\nmany rules resulting from the construction of that concept, which are\npurposive for many possible designs. But this purposiveness does not\nimply a _purpose_ or any other ground whatever. It is quite different\nif I meet with order and regularity in complexes of _things_, external\nto myself, enclosed within certain boundaries; as, _e.g._ in a garden,\nthe order and regularity of the trees, flower-beds, and walks. These\nI cannot expect to derive _a priori_ from my bounding of space made\nafter a rule of my own; for this order and regularity are existing\nthings which must be given empirically in order to be known, and not\na mere representation in myself determined _a priori_ according to a\nprinciple. So then the latter (empirical) purposiveness, as _real_, is\ndependent on the concept of a purpose.\nBut the ground of admiration for a perceived purposiveness, although\nit be in the being of things (so far as their concepts can be\nconstructed), may very well be seen, and seen to be legitimate.\nThe manifold rules whose unity (derived from a principle) excites\nadmiration, are all synthetical and do not follow from the _concept_\nof the Object, _e.g._ of a circle; but require this Object to be\ngiven in intuition. Hence this unity gets the appearance of having\nempirically an external basis of rules distinct from our representative\nfaculty; as if therefore the correspondence of the Object to that\nneed of rules which is proper to the Understanding were contingent in\nitself, and therefore only possible by means of a purpose expressly\ndirected thereto. Now because this harmony, notwithstanding all\nthis purposiveness, is not cognised empirically but _a priori_, it\nshould bring us of itself to this point--that space, through whose\ndetermination (by means of the Imagination, in accordance with a\nconcept) the Object is alone possible, is not a characteristic of\nthings external to me, but a mere mode of representation in myself.\nHence, in the figure which I draw _in conformity with a concept_,\n_i.e._ in my own mode of representing that which is given to me\nexternally, whatever it may be in itself, _it is I that introduce\nthe purposiveness_; I get no empirical instruction from the Object\nabout the purposiveness, and so I require in it no particular purpose\nexternal to myself. But because this consideration already calls for\na critical employment of Reason, and consequently cannot be involved\nin the judging of the Object according to its properties; so this\nlatter [judging] suggests to me immediately nothing but the unification\nof heterogeneous rules (even according to their very diversity) in\na principle. This principle, without requiring any particular _a\npriori_ basis external to my concept, or indeed, generally speaking,\nto my representation, is yet cognised _a priori_ by me as true. Now\n_wonder_ is a shock of the mind arising from the incompatibility of a\nrepresentation, and the rule given by its means, with the principles\nalready lying at its basis; which provokes a doubt as to whether\nwe have rightly seen or rightly judged. _Admiration_, however, is\nwonder which ever recurs, despite the disappearance of this doubt.\nConsequently the latter is a quite natural effect of that observed\npurposiveness in the being of things (as phenomena). It cannot\nindeed be censured, whilst the unification of the form of sensible\nintuition (space)--with the faculty of concepts (the Understanding)--is\ninexplicable to us; and that not only on account of the union being\njust of the kind that it is, but because it is enlarging for the mind\nto surmise [the existence of] something lying outside our sensible\nrepresentations in which, although unknown to us, the ultimate\nground of that agreement may be met with. We are, it is true, not\nnecessitated to cognise this if we have only to do _a priori_ with the\nformal purposiveness of our representations; but the fact that we are\ncompelled to look out beyond it inspires at the same time an admiration\nfor the object that impels us thereto.\nWe are accustomed to speak of the above-mentioned properties of\ngeometrical figures or of numbers as _beautiful_, on account of a\ncertain _a priori_ purposiveness they have for all kinds of cognitive\nuses, this purposiveness being quite unexpected on account of the\nsimplicity of the construction. We speak, _e.g._ of this or that\n_beautiful_ property of the circle, which was discovered in this or\nthat way. But there is no aesthetical act of judgement through which we\nfind it purposive, no act of judgement without a concept which renders\nnoticeable a mere _subjective_ purposiveness in the free play of our\ncognitive faculties; but an intellectual act according to concepts\nwhich enables us clearly to cognise an objective purposiveness,\n_i.e._ availableness for all kinds of (infinitely manifold) purposes.\nWe must rather call this _relative perfection_ than a beauty of the\nmathematical figure. To speak thus of an _intellectual beauty_ cannot\nin general be permissible; for otherwise the word beauty would lose\nall determinate significance, or the intellectual satisfaction all\nsuperiority over the sensible. We should rather call a _demonstration_\nof such properties beautiful, because through it the Understanding\nas the faculty of concepts, and the Imagination as the faculty of\npresenting them, feel themselves strengthened _a priori_. (This, when\nviewed in connexion with the precision introduced by Reason, is spoken\nof as elegant.) Here, however, the satisfaction, although it is based\non concepts, is subjective; while perfection brings with itself an\nobjective satisfaction.\n\u00a7 63. _Of the relative, as distinguished from the inner, purposiveness\nof nature_\nExperience leads our Judgement to the concept of an objective and\nmaterial purposiveness, _i.e._ to the concept of a purpose of nature,\nonly when[105] we have to judge of a relation of cause to effect which\nwe find ourselves able to apprehend as legitimate only by presupposing\nthe Idea of the effect of the causality of the cause as the fundamental\ncondition, in the cause, of the possibility of the effect. This can\ntake place in two ways. We may regard the effect directly as an art\nproduct, or only as material for the art of other possible natural\nbeings; in other words, either as a purpose or as a means towards the\npurposive employment of other causes. This latter purposiveness is\ncalled utility (for man) or mere advantage (for other creatures), and\nis merely relative; while the former is an inner purposiveness of the\nnatural being.\nFor example, rivers bring down with them all kinds of earth serviceable\nfor the growth of plants which sometimes is deposited inland, often\nalso at their mouths. The tide brings this mud to many coasts over\nthe land or deposits it on the shore; and so, more especially if men\ngive their aid so that the ebb shall not carry it back again, the\nfruit-bearing land increases in area, and the vegetable kingdom gains\nthe place which formerly was the habitation of fish and shells. In\nthis way has nature itself brought about most of the extensions of the\nland, and still continues to do so, although very slowly.--Now the\nquestion is whether this is to be judged a purpose of nature, because\nit contains utility for men. We cannot put it down to the account of\nthe vegetable kingdom, because just as much is subtracted from sea-life\nas is added to land-life.\nOr, to give an example of the advantageousness of certain natural\nthings as means for other creatures (if we suppose them to be means),\nno soil is more suitable to pine trees than a sandy soil. Now the deep\nsea, before it withdrew from the land, left behind large tracts of sand\nin our northern regions, so that on this soil, so unfavourable for all\ncultivation, widely extended pine forests were enabled to grow, for the\nunreasoning destruction of which we frequently blame our ancestors.\nWe may ask if this original deposit of tracts of sand was a purpose\nof nature for the benefit of the possible pine forests? So much is\nclear, that if we regard this as a purpose of nature, we must also\nregard the sand as a relative purpose, in reference to which the ocean\nstrand and its withdrawal were means: for in the series of the mutually\nsubordinated members of a purposive combination, every member must be\nregarded as a purpose (though not as a final purpose), to which its\nproximate cause is the means. So too if cattle, sheep, horses, etc.,\nare to exist, there must be grass on the earth, but there must also\nbe saline plants in the desert if camels are to thrive; and again\nthese and other herbivorous animals must be met with in numbers if\nthere are to be wolves, tigers, and lions. Consequently the objective\npurposiveness, which is based upon advantage, is not an objective\npurposiveness of things in themselves; as if the sand could not be\nconceived for itself as an effect of a cause, viz. the sea, without\nattributing to the latter a purpose, and regarding the effect, namely,\nthe sand, as a work of art. It is a merely relative purposiveness\ncontingent upon the thing to which it is ascribed; and although in the\nexamples we have cited, the different kinds of grass are to be judged\nas in themselves organised products of nature, and consequently as\nartificial, yet are they to be regarded, in reference to the beasts\nwhich feed upon them, as mere raw material.\nBut above all, though man, through the freedom of his causality, finds\ncertain natural things of advantage for his designs--designs often\nfoolish, such as using the variegated plumage of birds to adorn his\nclothes, or coloured earths and the juices of plants for painting his\nface; often again reasonable as when the horse is used for riding, the\nox or (as in Minorca) the ass or pig for ploughing--yet we cannot even\nhere assume a relative natural purpose. For his Reason knows how to\ngive things a conformity with his own arbitrary fancies for which he\nwas not at all predestined by nature. Only, _if_ we assume that men are\nto live upon the earth, then the means must be there without which they\ncould not exist as animals, and even as rational animals (in however\nlow a degree of rationality); and thereupon those natural things,\nwhich are indispensable in this regard, must be considered as natural\npurposes.\nWe can hence easily see that external purposiveness (advantage of one\nthing in respect of others) can be regarded as an external natural\npurpose only under the condition, that the existence of that [being],\nto which it is immediately or distantly advantageous, is in itself a\npurpose of nature. Since that can never be completely determined by\nmere contemplation of nature, it follows that relative purposiveness,\nalthough it hypothetically gives indications of natural purposes, yet\njustifies no absolute teleological judgement.\nSnow in cold countries protects the crops from the frost; it makes\nhuman intercourse easier (by means of sleighs). The Laplander finds in\nhis country animals by whose aid this intercourse is brought about,\n_i.e._ reindeer, who find sufficient sustenance in a dry moss which\nthey have to scratch out for themselves from under the snow, and who\nare easily tamed and readily permit themselves to be deprived of that\nfreedom in which they could have remained if they chose. For other\npeople in the same frozen regions marine animals afford rich stores;\nin addition to the food and clothing which are thus supplied, and the\nwood which is floated in by the sea to their dwellings, these marine\nanimals provide material for fuel by which their huts are warmed. Here\nis a wonderful concurrence of many references of nature to one purpose;\nand all this applies to the cases of the Greenlander, the Lapp, the\nSamoyede, the inhabitant of Yakutsk, etc. But then we do not see why,\ngenerally, men must live there at all. Therefore to say that vapour\nfalls out of the atmosphere in the form of snow, that the sea has its\ncurrents which float down wood that has grown in warmer lands, and that\nthere are in it great sea monsters filled with oil, _because_ the idea\nof advantage for certain poor creatures is fundamental for the cause\nwhich collects all these natural products, would be a very venturesome\nand arbitrary judgement. For even if there were none of this natural\nutility, we should miss nothing as regards the adequateness of natural\ncauses to nature\u2019s constitution; much more even to desire such a\ntendency in, and to attribute such a purpose to, nature would be the\npart of a presumptuous and inconsiderate fancy. For indeed it might be\nobserved that it could only have been the greatest unsociability among\nmen which thus scattered them into such inhospitable regions.\n\u00a7 64. _Of the peculiar character of things as natural purposes_\nIn order to see that a thing is only possible as a purpose, that is,\nto be forced to seek the causality of its origin not in the mechanism\nof nature but in a cause whose faculty of action is determined through\nconcepts, it is requisite that its form be not possible according to\nmere natural laws, _i.e._ laws which can be cognised by us through the\nUnderstanding alone when applied to objects of Sense; but that even the\nempirical knowledge of it as regards its cause and effect presupposes\nconcepts of Reason. This _contingency_ of its form in all empirical\nnatural laws in reference to Reason affords a ground for regarding its\ncausality as possible only through Reason. For Reason, which must\ncognise the necessity of every form of a natural product in order to\ncomprehend even the conditions of its genesis, cannot assume such\n[natural] necessity in that particular given form. The causality of its\norigin is then referred to the faculty of acting in accordance with\npurposes (a will); and the Object which can only thus be represented as\npossible is represented as a purpose.\nIf in a seemingly uninhabited country a man perceived a geometrical\nfigure, say a regular hexagon, inscribed on the sand, his reflection\nbusied with such a concept would attribute, although obscurely, the\nunity in the principle of its genesis to Reason, and consequently would\nnot regard as a ground of the possibility of such a shape the sand, or\nthe neighbouring sea, or the winds, or beasts with familiar footprints,\nor any other irrational cause. For the chance against meeting with\nsuch a concept, which is only possible through Reason, would seem so\ninfinitely great, that it would be just as if there were no natural\nlaw, no cause in the mere mechanical working of nature capable of\nproducing it; but as if only the concept of such an Object, as a\nconcept which Reason alone can supply and with which it can compare the\nthing, could contain the causality for such an effect. This then would\nbe regarded as a purpose, but as a product of _art_, not as a natural\npurpose (_vestigium hominis video_).[106]\nBut in order to regard a thing cognised as a natural product as a\npurpose also--consequently as a _natural purpose_, if this is not a\ncontradiction--something more is required. I would say provisionally:\na thing exists as a natural purpose, if it is [although in a double\nsense][107] both _cause and effect of itself_. For herein lies a\ncausality the like of which cannot be combined with the mere concept\nof a nature without attributing to it a purpose; it can certainly be\nthought without contradiction, but cannot be comprehended. We shall\nelucidate the determination of this Idea of a natural purpose by an\nexample, before we analyse it completely.\nIn the first place, a tree generates another tree according to a\nknown natural law. But the tree produced is of the same genus; and so\nit produces itself _generically_. On the one hand, as effect it is\ncontinually self-produced; on the other hand, as cause it continually\nproduces itself, and so perpetuates itself generically.\nSecondly, a tree produces itself as an _individual_. This kind of\neffect no doubt we call growth; but it is quite different from any\nincrease according to mechanical laws, and is to be reckoned as\ngeneration, though under another name. The matter that the tree\nincorporates it previously works up into a specifically peculiar\nquality, which natural mechanism external to it cannot supply; and\nthus it develops itself by aid of a material which, as compounded,\nis its own product. No doubt, as regards the constituents got from\nnature without, it must only be regarded as an educt; but yet in\nthe separation and recombination of this raw material we see such\nan originality in the separating and formative faculty of this kind\nof natural being, as is infinitely beyond the reach of art, if the\nattempt is made to reconstruct such vegetable products out of elements\nobtained by their dissection or material supplied by nature for their\nsustenance.\n_Thirdly_, each part of a tree generates itself in such a way that the\nmaintenance of any one part depends reciprocally on the maintenance of\nthe rest. A bud of one tree engrafted on the twig of another produces\nin the alien stock a plant of its own kind, and so also a scion\nengrafted on a foreign stem. Hence we may regard each twig or leaf of\nthe same tree as merely engrafted or inoculated into it, and so as an\nindependent tree attached to another and parasitically nourished by\nit. At the same time, while the leaves are products of the tree they\nalso in turn give support to it; for the repeated defoliation of a tree\nkills it, and its growth thus depends on the action of the leaves upon\nthe stem. The self-help of nature in case of injury in the vegetable\ncreation, when the want of a part that is necessary for the maintenance\nof its neighbours is supplied by the remaining parts; and the abortions\nor malformations in growth, in which certain parts, on account of\ncasual defects or hindrances, form themselves in a new way to maintain\nwhat exists, and so produce an anomalous creature, I shall only mention\nin passing, though they are among the most wonderful properties of\norganised creatures.\n\u00a7 65. _Things regarded as natural purposes are organised beings_\nAccording to the character alleged in the preceding section, a thing,\nwhich, though a natural product, is to be cognised as only possible as\na natural purpose, must bear itself alternately as cause and as effect.\nThis, however, is a somewhat inexact and indeterminate expression\nwhich needs derivation from a determinate concept.\nCausal combination as thought merely by the Understanding is a\nconnexion constituting an ever-progressive series (of causes and\neffects); and things which as effects presuppose others as causes\ncannot be reciprocally at the same time causes of these. This sort\nof causal combination we call that of effective causes (_nexus\neffectivus_). But on the other hand, a causal combination according to\na concept of Reason (of purposes) can also be thought, which regarded\nas a series would lead either forwards or backwards; in this the thing\nthat has been called the effect may with equal propriety be termed the\ncause of that of which it is the effect. In the practical department of\nhuman art we easily find connexions such as this; _e.g._ a house, no\ndoubt, is the cause of the money received for rent, but also conversely\nthe representation of this possible income was the cause of building\nthe house. Such a causal connexion we call that of final causes (_nexus\nfinalis_). We may perhaps suitably name the first the connexion of\nreal causes, the second of those which are ideal; because from this\nnomenclature it is at once comprehended that there can be no more than\nthese two kinds of causality.\nFor a thing to be a natural purpose in the _first_ place it is\nrequisite that its parts (as regards their being and their form) are\nonly possible through their reference to the whole. For the thing\nitself is a purpose and so is comprehended under a concept or an Idea\nwhich must determine _a priori_ all that is to be contained in it.\nBut so far as a thing is only thought as possible in this way, it is\na mere work of art; _i.e._ a product of one rational cause distinct\nfrom the matter (of the parts), whose causality (in the collection and\ncombination of the parts) is determined through its Idea of a whole\npossible by their means (and consequently not through external nature).\nBut if a thing as a natural product is to involve in itself and in its\ninternal possibility a reference to purposes,--_i.e._ to be possible\nonly as a natural purpose, and without the causality of the concepts of\nrational beings external to itself,--then it is requisite _secondly_\nthat its parts should so combine in the unity of a whole that they are\nreciprocally cause and effect of each other\u2019s form. Only in this way\ncan the Idea of the whole conversely (reciprocally) determine the form\nand combination of all the parts; not indeed as cause--for then it\nwould be an artificial product--but as the ground of cognition, for him\nwho is judging it, of the systematic unity and combination of all the\nmanifold contained in the given material.\nFor a body then which is to be judged in itself and its internal\npossibility as a natural purpose, it is requisite that its parts\nmutually depend upon each other both as to their form and their\ncombination, and so produce a whole by their own causality; while\nconversely the concept of the whole may be regarded as its cause\naccording to a principle (in a being possessing a causality according\nto concepts adequate to such a product). In this case then the\nconnexion of _effective causes_ may be judged as an _effect through\nfinal causes_.\nIn such a product of nature every part not only exists _by means\nof_ the other parts, but is thought as existing _for the sake of_\nthe others and the whole, that is as an (organic) instrument. Thus,\nhowever, it might be an artificial instrument, and so might be\nrepresented only as a purpose that is possible in general; but also\nits parts are all organs reciprocally _producing_ each other. This can\nnever be the case with artificial instruments, but only with nature\nwhich supplies all the material for instruments (even for those of\nart). Only a product of such a kind can be called a _natural purpose_,\nand this because it is an _organised_ and _self-organising being_.\nIn a watch one part is the instrument for moving the other parts, but\nthe wheel is not the effective cause of the production of the others;\nno doubt one part is for the sake of the others, but it does not exist\nby their means. In this case the producing cause of the parts and of\ntheir form is not contained in the nature (of the material), but is\nexternal to it in a being which can produce effects according to Ideas\nof a whole possible by means of its causality. Hence a watch wheel\ndoes not produce other wheels, still less does one watch produce other\nwatches, utilising (organising) foreign material for that purpose;\nhence it does not replace of itself parts of which it has been\ndeprived, nor does it make good what is lacking in a first formation by\nthe addition of the missing parts, nor if it has gone out of order does\nit repair itself--all of which, on the contrary, we may expect from\norganised nature.--An organised being is then not a mere machine, for\nthat has merely _moving_ power, but it possesses in itself _formative_\npower of a self-propagating kind which it communicates to its materials\nthough they have it not of themselves; it organises them, in fact, and\nthis cannot be explained by the mere mechanical faculty of motion.\nWe say of nature and its faculty in organised products far too little\nif we describe it as an _analogon of art_; for this suggests an\nartificer (a rational being) external to it. Much rather does it\norganise itself and its organised products in every species, no doubt\nafter one general pattern but yet with suitable deviations, which\nself-preservation demands according to circumstances. We perhaps\napproach nearer to this inscrutable property, if we describe it as\nan _analogon of life_; but then we must either endow matter, as mere\nmatter, with a property which contradicts its very being (hylozoism),\nor associate therewith an alien principle _standing in communion_ with\nit (a soul). But in the latter case we must, if such a product is to be\na natural product, either presuppose organised matter as the instrument\nof that soul, which does not make the soul a whit more comprehensible;\nor regard the soul as artificer of this structure and so remove\nthe product from (corporeal) nature. To speak strictly, then, the\norganisation of nature has in it nothing analogous to any causality we\nknow.[108] Beauty in nature can be rightly described as an analogon of\nart, because it is ascribed to objects only in reference to reflection\nupon their _external_ aspect, and consequently only on account of the\nform of their external surface. But _internal natural perfection_,\nas it belongs to those things which are only possible as _natural\npurposes_, and are therefore called organised beings, is not analogous\nto any physical, _i.e._ natural, faculty known to us; nay even,\nregarding ourselves as, in the widest sense, belonging to nature, it\nis not even thinkable or explicable by means of any exactly fitting\nanalogy to human art.\nThe concept of a thing as in itself a natural purpose is therefore no\nconstitutive concept of Understanding or of Reason, but it can serve\nas a regulative concept for the reflective Judgement, to guide our\ninvestigation about objects of this kind by a distant analogy with our\nown causality according to purposes generally, and in our meditations\nupon their ultimate ground. This latter use, however, is not in\nreference to the knowledge of nature or of its original ground, but\nrather to our own practical faculty of Reason, in analogy with which we\nconsidered the cause of that purposiveness.\nOrganised beings are then the only beings in nature which, considered\nin themselves and apart from any relation to other things, can be\nthought as possible only as purposes of nature. Hence they first\nafford objective reality to the concept of a _purpose of nature_, as\ndistinguished from a practical purpose; and so they give to the science\nof nature the basis for a teleology, _i.e._ a mode of judgement about\nnatural Objects according to a special principle which otherwise we\nshould in no way be justified in introducing (because we cannot see _a\npriori_ the possibility of this kind of causality).\n\u00a7 66. _Of the principle of judging of internal purposiveness in\norganised beings_\nThis principle, which is at the same time a definition, is as follows:\n_An organised product of nature is one in which every part is\nreciprocally purpose, [end] and means._ In it nothing is vain, without\npurpose, or to be ascribed to a blind mechanism of nature.\nThis principle, as regards its occasion, is doubtless derived from\nexperience, viz. from that methodised experience called observation;\nbut on account of the universality and necessity which it ascribes to\nsuch purposiveness it cannot rest solely on empirical grounds, but\nmust have at its basis an _a priori_ principle, although it be merely\nregulative and these purposes lie only in the idea of the judging\n[subject] and not in an effective cause. We may therefore describe\nthe aforesaid principle as a _maxim_ for judging of the internal\npurposiveness of organised beings.\nIt is an acknowledged fact that the dissectors of plants and animals,\nin order to investigate their structure and to find out the reasons,\nwhy and for what end such parts, such a disposition and combination\nof parts, and just such an internal form have been given them, assume\nas indisputably necessary the maxim that nothing in such a creature\nis _vain_; just as they lay down as the fundamental proposition of\nthe universal science of nature, that _nothing_ happens _by chance_.\nIn fact, they can as little free themselves from this teleological\nproposition as from the universal physical proposition; for as without\nthe latter we should have no experience at all, so without the former\nwe should have no guiding thread for the observation of a species of\nnatural things which we have thought teleologically under the concept\nof natural purposes.\nNow this concept brings the Reason into a quite different order of\nthings from that of a mere mechanism of nature, which is no longer\nsatisfying here. An Idea is to be the ground of the possibility\nof the natural product. But because this is an absolute unity of\nrepresentation, instead of the material being a plurality of things\nthat can supply by itself no definite unity of composition,--if that\nunity of the Idea is to serve at all as the _a priori_ ground of\ndetermination of a natural law of the causality of such a form of\ncomposition,--the purpose of nature must be extended to _everything_\nincluded in its product. For if we once refer action of this sort _on\nthe whole_ to any supersensible ground of determination beyond the\nblind mechanism of nature, we must judge of it altogether according to\nthis principle; and we have then no reason to regard the form of such\na thing as partly dependent on mechanism--for by such mixing up of\ndisparate principles no certain rule of judging would be left.\nFor example, it may be that in an animal body many parts can be\nconceived as concretions according to mere mechanical laws (as the\nhide, the bones, the hair). And yet the cause which brings together the\nrequired matter, modifies it, forms it, and puts it in its appropriate\nplace, must always be judged of teleologically; so that here everything\nmust be considered as organised, and everything again in a certain\nrelation to the thing itself is an organ.\n\u00a7 67. _Of the principle of the teleological judging of nature in\ngeneral as a system of purposes_\nWe have already said above that the _external_ purposiveness of natural\nthings affords no sufficient warrant for using them as purposes of\nnature in order to explain their presence, and for regarding their\ncontingently purposive effects as the grounds of their presence\naccording to the principle of final causes. Thus we cannot take\nfor natural purposes, _rivers_ because they promote intercourse\namong inland peoples, _mountains_ because they contain the sources\nof the rivers and for their maintenance in rainless seasons have a\nstore of snow, or the _slope_ of the land which carries away the\nwater and leaves the country dry; because although this shape of the\nearth\u2019s surface be very necessary for the origin and maintenance of\nthe vegetable and animal kingdoms, it has nothing in itself for the\npossibility of which we are forced to assume a causality according to\npurposes. The same is true of plants which man uses for his needs or\nhis pleasures; of beasts, the camel, the ox, the horse, dog, etc.,\nwhich are indispensable to him as well for food as because they are\nused in his service in many different ways. In the case of things\nwhich we have no reason for regarding in themselves as purposes, such\nexternal relation can only be hypothetically judged as purposive.\nTo judge of a thing as a natural purpose on account of its internal\nform is something very different from taking the existence of that\nthing to be a purpose of nature. For the latter assertion we require\nnot merely the concept of a possible purpose, but the knowledge of\nthe final purpose (_scopus_) of nature. But this requires a reference\nof such knowledge to something supersensible far transcending all our\nteleological knowledge of nature, for the purpose of [the existence\nof][109] nature must itself be sought beyond nature. The internal form\nof a mere blade of grass is sufficient to show that for our human\nfaculty of judgement its origin is possible only according to the\nrule of purposes. But if we change our point of view and look to the\nuse which other natural beings make of it, abandon the consideration\nof its internal organisation and only look to its externally purposive\nreferences, we shall arrive at no categorical purpose; all this\npurposive reference rests on an ever more distant condition, which, as\nunconditioned (the presence of a thing as final purpose), lies quite\noutside the physico-teleological view of the world. For example, grass\nis needful for the ox, which again is needful for man as a means of\nexistence, but then we do not see why it is necessary that men should\nexist (a question this, which we shall not find so easy to answer if we\nsometimes cast our thoughts on the New Hollanders or the inhabitants\nof Tierra del Fuego). So conceived, the thing is not even a natural\npurpose, for neither it (nor its whole genus) is to be regarded as a\nnatural product.\nHence it is only so far as matter is organised that it necessarily\ncarries with it the concept of a natural purpose, because this its\nspecific form is at the same time a product of nature. But this concept\nleads necessarily to the Idea of collective nature as a system in\naccordance with the rule of purposes, to which Idea all the mechanism\nof nature must be subordinated according to principles of Reason (at\nleast in order to investigate natural phenomena therein). The principle\nof Reason belongs to it only as a subjective principle or a maxim: viz.\neverything in the World is some way good for something; nothing is vain\nin it. By the example that nature gives us in its organic products we\nare justified, nay called upon, to expect of it and of its laws nothing\nthat is not purposive on the whole.\nIt is plain that this is not a principle for the determinant but\nonly for the reflective Judgement; that it is regulative and not\nconstitutive; and that we derive from it a clue by which we consider\nnatural things in reference to an already given ground of determination\naccording to a new law-abiding order; and extend our natural science\naccording to a different principle, viz. that of final causes, but\nyet without prejudice to the principle of mechanical causality.\nFurthermore, it is in no wise thus decided, whether anything of which\nwe judge by this principle, is a _designed_ purpose of nature; whether\nthe grass is for the ox or the sheep, or whether these and the other\nthings of nature are here for men. It is well also from this side\nto consider the things which are unpleasant to us and are contrary\nto purpose in particular references. Thus, for example, we can say:\nThe vermin that torment men in their clothes, their hair, or their\nbeds, may be, according to a wise appointment of nature, a motive to\ncleanliness which is in itself an important means for the preservation\nof health. Or again the mosquitoes and other stinging insects that\nmake the wildernesses of America so oppressive to the savages, may be\nso many goads to activity for these primitive men, [inducing them] to\ndrain the marshes and bring light into the forests which intercept\nevery breath of air, and in this way, as well as by cultivating the\nsoil, to make their habitations more healthy. The same thing, which\nappears to men contradictory to nature in its inner organisation, if\nviewed in this light gives an entertaining, sometimes an instructive,\noutlook into a teleological order of things, to which, without such\na principle, mere physical observation would not lead us by itself.\nThus some persons regard the tapeworm as given to the men or animals\nin whom it resides, as a kind of set-off for some defect in their\nvital organs; now I would ask if dreams (without which we never sleep,\nthough we seldom remember them) may not be a purposive ordinance of\nnature? For during the relaxation of all the moving powers of the body,\nthey serve to excite internally the vital organs by the medium of the\nImagination and its great activity (which in this state generally rises\nto the height of affection). During sleep the Imagination commonly is\nmore actively at play when the stomach is overloaded, in which case\nthis excitement is the more necessary. Consequently, then, without this\ninternal power of motion and this fatiguing unrest, on account of which\nwe complain about our dreams (though in fact they are rather remedial),\nsleep even in a sound state of health would be a complete extinction of\nlife.\nAlso the beauty of nature, _i.e._ its connexion with the free play of\nour cognitive faculties in apprehending and judging of its appearance,\ncan be regarded as a kind of objective purposiveness of nature in its\nwhole [content] as a system of which man is a member; if once the\nteleological judging of the same by means of the natural purposes which\norganised beings suggest to us, has justified for us the Idea of a\ngreat system of purposes of nature. We can regard it as a favour[110]\nwhich nature has felt for us, that in addition to what is useful it\nhas so profusely dispensed beauty and charm; and we can therefore love\nit, as well as regard it with respect on account of its immensity,\nand feel ourselves ennobled by such regard; just as if nature had\nestablished and adorned its splendid theatre precisely with this view.\nWe shall say only one thing more in this paragraph. If we have once\ndiscovered in nature a faculty of bringing forth products that can\nonly be thought by us in accordance with the concept of final causes,\nwe go further still. We venture to judge that things belong to a\nsystem of purposes, which yet do not (either in themselves or in their\npurposive relations) necessitate our seeking for any principle of\ntheir possibility beyond the mechanism of causes working blindly. For\nthe first Idea, as concerns its ground, already brings us beyond the\nworld of sense; since the unity of the supersensible principle must be\nregarded as valid in this way not merely for certain species of natural\nbeings, but for the whole of nature as a system.\n\u00a7 68. _Of the principle of Teleology as internal principle of natural\nscience_\nThe principles of a science are either internal to it and are then\ncalled domestic (_principia domestica_), or are based on concepts that\ncan only find their place outside it and so are _foreign_ principles\n(_peregrina_). Sciences that contain the latter, place at the basis of\ntheir doctrines auxiliary propositions (_lemmata_), _i.e._ they borrow\nsome concept, and with it a ground of arrangement, from another science.\nEvery science is in itself a system, and it is not enough in it to\nbuild in accordance with principles and thus to employ a technical\nprocedure, but we must go to work with it architectonically, as a\nbuilding subsisting for itself; we must not treat it as an additional\nwing or part of another building, but as a whole in itself, although we\nmay subsequently make a passage from it into that other or conversely.\nIf then we introduce into the context of natural science the concept of\nGod in order to explain the purposiveness in nature, and subsequently\nuse this purposiveness to prove that there is a God, there is no\ninternal consistency in either science [_i.e._ either in natural\nscience or theology]; and a delusive circle brings them both into\nuncertainty, because they have allowed their boundaries to overlap.\nThe expression, a purpose of nature, already sufficiently prevents the\nconfusion of mixing up natural science and the occasion that it gives\nfor judging _teleologically_ of its objects, with the consideration of\nGod, and so of a _theological_ derivation of them. We must not regard\nit as insignificant, if one interchanges this expression with that of\na divine purpose in the ordering of nature, or gives out the latter\nas more suitable and proper for a pious soul, because it must come in\nthe end to deriving these purposive forms in nature from a wise author\nof the world. On the contrary, we must carefully and modestly limit\nourselves to the expression, a purpose of nature, which asserts exactly\nas much as we know. Before we ask after the cause of nature itself, we\nfind in nature, and in the course of its development, products of the\nsame kind which are developed in it according to known empirical laws,\nin accordance with which natural science must judge of its objects,\nand, consequently, must seek in nature their causality according to\nthe rule of purposes. So then it must not transgress its bounds in\norder to introduce into itself as a domestic principle that, to whose\nconcept no experience can be commensurate, upon which we are only\nentitled to venture after the completion of natural science.\nNatural characteristics which demonstrate themselves _a priori_, and\nconsequently admit of insight into their possibility from universal\nprinciples without any admixture of experience, although they carry\nwith them a technical purposiveness, yet cannot, because they are\nabsolutely necessary, be referred to the Teleology of nature, as to a\nmethod belonging to Physic for solving its problems. Arithmetical or\ngeometrical analogies, as well as universal mechanical laws,--however\nstrange and admirable may seem to us the union of different rules,\nquite independent of one another according to all appearance, in a\nsingle principle,--possess on that account no claim to be teleological\ngrounds of explanation in Physic. Even if they deserve to be brought\ninto consideration in the universal theory of the purposiveness\nof things of nature, yet they belong to another [science], _i.e._\nMetaphysic, and constitute no internal principle of natural science;\nas with the empirical laws of natural purposes in organised beings, it\nis not only permissible but unavoidable to use the teleological _mode\nof judging_ as a principle of the doctrine of nature in regard to a\nparticular class of its objects.\nSo to the end that Physic may keep within its own bounds, it\nabstracts itself entirely from the question, whether natural purposes\nare _designed_ or _undesigned_; for that would be to meddle in an\nextraneous business, in Metaphysic. It is enough that there are\nobjects, alone _explicable_ according to natural laws which we\ncan only think by means of the Idea of purposes as principle, and\nalso alone internally _cognisable_ as concerns their internal form,\nin this way. In order, therefore, to remove the suspicion of the\nslightest assumption,--as if we wished to mix with our grounds\nof cognition something not belonging to Physic at all, viz. a\nsupernatural cause,--we speak in Teleology, indeed, of nature as if the\npurposiveness therein were designed, but in such a way that this design\nis ascribed to nature, _i.e._ to matter. Now in this way there can be\nno misunderstanding, because no design in the proper meaning of the\nword can possibly be ascribed to inanimate matter; we thus give notice\nthat this word here only expresses a principle of the reflective not of\nthe determinant Judgement, and so is to introduce no particular ground\nof causality; but only adds for the use of the Reason a different kind\nof investigation from that according to mechanical laws, in order to\nsupplement the inadequacy of the latter even for empirical research\ninto all particular laws of nature. Hence we speak quite correctly\nin Teleology, so far as it is referred to Physic, of the wisdom, the\neconomy, the forethought, the beneficence of Nature, without either\nmaking an intelligent being of it, for that would be preposterous; or\neven without presuming to place another intelligent Being above it as\nits Architect, for that would be presumptuous.[111] But there should\nbe only signified thereby a kind of causality of nature after the\nanalogy of our own in the technical use of Reason, in order to have\nbefore us the rule according to which certain products of nature must\nbe investigated.\nBut now why is it that Teleology usually forms no proper part of\ntheoretical natural science, but is regarded as a propaedeutic or\ntransition to Theology? This is done in order to restrict the study\nof nature, mechanically considered, to that which we can so subject\nto observation or experiment that we are able to produce it ourselves\nas nature does, or at least by similar laws. For we see into a thing\ncompletely only so far as we can make it in accordance with our\nconcepts and bring it to completion. But organisation, as an inner\npurpose of nature, infinitely surpasses all our faculty of presenting\nthe like by means of art. And as concerns the external contrivances\nof nature regarded as purposive (wind, rain, etc.), Physic, indeed,\nconsiders their mechanism, but it cannot at all present their reference\nto purposes, so far as this is a condition necessarily belonging to\ncause; for this necessity of connexion has to do altogether with the\ncombination of our concepts and not with the constitution of things.\nSECOND DIVISION\nDIALECTIC OF THE TELEOLOGICAL JUDGEMENT\n\u00a7 69. _What is an antinomy of the Judgement?_\nThe _determinant_ Judgement has for itself no principles which are\nthe foundation of _concepts of Objects_. It has no autonomy, for it\n_subsumes_ only under given laws or concepts as principles. Hence it\nis exposed to no danger of an antinomy of its own or to a conflict of\nits principles. So [we saw that] the transcendental Judgement which\ncontains the conditions of subsuming under categories was for itself\nnot _nomothetic_, but that it only indicated the conditions of sensuous\nintuition, under which reality (application) can be supplied to a given\nconcept, as law of the Understanding, whereby the Judgement could never\nfall into discord with itself (at least as far as its principles are\nconcerned).\nBut the _reflective_ Judgement must subsume under a law, which is not\nyet given, and is therefore in fact only a principle of reflection\nupon objects, for which we are objectively quite in want of a law or\nof a concept of an Object that would be adequate as a principle for\nthe cases that occur. Since now no use of the cognitive faculties\ncan be permitted without principles, the reflective Judgement must\nin such cases serve as a principle for itself. This, because it is\nnot objective and can supply no ground of cognition of the Object\nadequate for design, must serve as a mere subjective principle, for the\npurposive employment of our cognitive faculties, _i.e._ for reflecting\nupon a class of objects. Therefore in reference to such cases the\nreflective Judgement has its maxims--necessary maxims--on behalf of\nthe cognition of natural laws in experience, in order to attain by\ntheir means to concepts, even concepts of Reason; since it has absolute\nneed of such in order to learn merely to cognise nature according to\nits empirical laws.--Between these necessary maxims of the reflective\nJudgement there may be a conflict and consequently an antinomy, upon\nwhich a Dialectic bases itself. If each of two conflicting maxims has\nits ground in the nature of the cognitive faculties, this may be called\na natural Dialectic, and an unavoidable illusion which we must expose\nand resolve in our Critique, to the end that it may not deceive us.\n\u00a7 70. _Representation of this antinomy_\nSo far as Reason has to do with nature, as the complex of objects\nof external sense, it can base itself partly upon laws which the\nUnderstanding itself prescribes _a priori_ to nature, partly upon\nlaws which it can extend indefinitely by means of the empirical\ndeterminations occurring in experience. To apply the former kind of\nlaws, _i.e._ the _universal_ laws of material nature in general, the\nJudgement needs no special principle of reflection, since it is there\ndeterminant because an objective principle is given to it through\nUnderstanding. But as regards the particular laws that can only be made\nknown to us through experience, there can be under them such great\nmanifoldness and diversity, that the Judgement must serve as its own\nprinciple in order to investigate and search into the phenomena of\nnature in accordance with a law. Such a guiding thread is needed, if\nwe are only to hope for a connected empirical cognition according to\na thoroughgoing conformity of nature to law, even its unity according\nto empirical laws. In this contingent unity of particular laws it may\nvery well happen that the Judgement in its reflection proceeds from\ntwo maxims. One of these is suggested to it _a priori_ by the mere\nUnderstanding; but the other is prompted by particular experiences,\nwhich bring the Reason into play in order to form a judgement upon\ncorporeal nature and its laws in accordance with a particular\nprinciple. Hence it comes about that these two kinds of maxims seem to\nbe incapable of existing together, and consequently a Dialectic arises\nwhich leads the Judgement into error in the principle of its reflection.\nThe _first maxim_ of Judgement is the _proposition_: all production of\nmaterial things and their forms must be judged to be possible according\nto merely mechanical laws.\nThe _second maxim_ is the _counter-proposition_: some products of\nmaterial nature cannot be judged to be possible according to merely\nmechanical laws. (To judge them requires quite a different law of\ncausality, namely, that of final causes.)\nIf these regulative principles of investigation be converted into\nconstitutive principles of the possibility of Objects, they will run\nthus:\n_Proposition_: All production of material things is possible according\nto merely mechanical laws.\n_Counter-proposition_: Some production of material things is not\npossible according to merely mechanical laws.\nIn this latter aspect, as objective principles for the determinant\nJudgement, they would contradict each other; and consequently one of\nthe two propositions must necessarily be false. We shall then, it is\ntrue, have an antinomy, but not of Judgement; there will be a conflict\nin the legislation of Reason. Reason, however, can prove neither the\none nor the other of these fundamental propositions, because we can\nhave _a priori_ no determinant principle of the possibility of things\naccording to mere empirical laws of nature.\nOn the other hand, as regards the first-mentioned maxims of a\nreflective Judgement, they involve no contradiction in fact. For if\nI say, I must _judge_, according to merely mechanical laws, of the\npossibility of all events in material nature, and consequently of all\nforms regarded as its products, I do not therefore say: _They are\npossible in this way alone_ (apart from any other kind of causality).\nAll that is implied is: I _must_ always _reflect_ upon them _according\nto the principle_ of the mere mechanism of nature, and consequently\ninvestigate this as far as I can; because unless this lies at the\nbasis of investigation, there can be no proper knowledge of nature at\nall. But this does not prevent us, if occasion offers, from following\nout the second maxim in the case of certain natural forms (and even\nby occasion of these in the whole of nature), in order to reflect\nupon them according to the principle of final causes, which is quite\na different thing from explaining them according to the mechanism of\nnature. Reflection in accordance with the first maxim is thus not\nabrogated; on the contrary, we are told to follow it as far as we can.\nNor is it said that these forms would not be possible in accordance\nwith the mechanism of nature. It is only asserted that _human Reason_\nin following up this maxim and in this way could never find the least\nground for that which constitutes the specific [character] of a natural\npurpose, although it would increase its knowledge of natural laws.\nThus it is left undecided whether or not in the unknown inner ground\nof nature, physico-mechanical and purposive combination may be united\nin the same things in one principle. We only say that our Reason is\nnot in a position so to unite them; and that therefore the Judgement\n(as _reflective_--from subjective grounds, not as determinant, in\nconsequence of an objective principle of the possibility of things in\nthemselves) is compelled to think a different principle from that of\nnatural mechanism as the ground of the possibility of certain forms in\nnature.\n\u00a7 71. _Preliminary to the solution of the above antinomy_\nWe can in no way prove the impossibility of the production of organised\nnatural products by the mere mechanism of nature, because we cannot\nsee into the first inner ground of the infinite multiplicity of the\nparticular laws of nature, which are contingent for us since they\nare only empirically known; and so we cannot arrive at the inner\nall-sufficient principle of the possibility of a nature (a principle\nwhich lies in the supersensible). Whether therefore the productive\nfaculty of nature is sufficient for that which we judge to be formed\nor combined in accordance with the Idea of purposes, as well as\nfor that which we believe to require merely a mechanical system\n[Maschinenwesen] of nature; or whether there lies at the basis of\nthings which we must necessarily judge as properly natural purposes,\na quite different kind of original causality, which cannot be\ncontained in material nature or in its intelligible substrate, viz. an\narchitectonic Understanding--this is a question to which our Reason,\nvery narrowly limited in respect of the concept of causality if it\nis to be specified _a priori_, can give no answer whatever.--But it\nis just as certain and beyond doubt that, in regard to our cognitive\nfaculties, the mere mechanism of nature can furnish no ground of\nexplanation of the production of organised beings. _For the reflective\nJudgement_ it is therefore a quite correct fundamental proposition,\nthat for that connexion of things according to final causes which is\nso plain, there must be thought a causality distinct from that of\nmechanism, viz. that of an (intelligent) cause of the world acting in\naccordance with purposes; but _for the determinant Judgement_ this\nwould be a hasty and unprovable proposition. In the first case it is a\nmere maxim of the Judgement, wherein the concept of that causality is\na mere Idea, to which we by no means undertake to concede reality, but\nwhich we use as a guide to reflection, which remains thereby always\nopen to all mechanical grounds of explanation and does not withdraw\nout of the world of Sense. In the second case the proposition would be\nan objective principle prescribed by Reason, to which the determinant\nJudgement must subject itself, whereby however it withdraws beyond the\nworld of Sense into the transcendent and perhaps is led into error.\nAll appearance of an antinomy between the maxims of the proper\nphysical (mechanical) and the teleological (technical) methods of\nexplanation rests therefore on this; that we confuse a fundamental\nproposition of the reflective with one of the determinant Judgement,\nand the _autonomy_ of the first (which has mere subjective validity for\nour use of Reason in respect of particular empirical laws) with the\n_heteronomy_ of the second, which must regulate itself according to\nlaws (universal or particular) given to it by the Understanding.\n\u00a7 72. _Of the different systems which deal with the purposiveness of\nnature_\nNo one has ever doubted the correctness of the proposition that\njudgement must be passed upon certain things of nature (organised\nbeings) and their possibility in accordance with the concept of final\ncauses, even if we only desire a _guiding thread_ to learn how to\ncognise their constitution through observation, without aspiring to an\ninvestigation into their first origin. The question therefore can only\nbe: whether this fundamental proposition is merely subjectively valid,\n_i.e._ is a mere maxim of our Judgement; or whether it is an objective\nprinciple of nature, in accordance with which, apart from its mechanism\n(according to the mere laws of motion), quite a different kind of\ncausality attaches to it, viz. that of final causes, under which these\nlaws (of moving forces) stand only as intermediate causes.\nWe could leave this question or problem quite undecided and unsolved\nspeculatively; because if we content ourselves with speculation\nwithin the bounds of mere natural knowledge, we have enough in these\nmaxims for the study of nature and for the tracking out of its hidden\nsecrets, as far as human powers reach. There is then indeed a certain\npresentiment of our Reason or a hint as it were given us by nature,\nthat, by means of this concept of final causes, we go beyond nature,\nand could unite it to the highest point in the series of causes, if we\nwere to abandon or at least to lay aside for a time the investigation\nof nature (although we may not have advanced far in it), and seek\nthenceforth to find out whither this stranger in natural science, viz.\nthe concept of natural purposes, would lead us.\nBut here these undisputed maxims pass over into problems opening out\na wide field for difficulties. Does purposive connexion in nature\n_prove_ a particular kind of causality? Or is it not rather, considered\nin itself and in accordance with objective principles, similar to the\nmechanism of nature, resting on one and the same ground? Only, as\nthis ground in many natural products is often hidden too deep for our\ninvestigation, we make trial of a subjective principle, that of art,\n_i.e._ of causality according to Ideas, and we ascribe it to nature\nby analogy. This expedient succeeds in many cases, but seems in some\nto mislead, and in no case does it justify us in introducing into\nnatural science a particular kind of operation quite distinct from the\ncausality according to the mere mechanical laws of nature. We give\nthe name of _Technic_ to the procedure (the causality) of nature, on\naccount of the appearance of purpose that we find in its products; and\nwe shall divide this into _designed_ (_technica intentionalis_) and\n_undesigned_ (_technica naturalis_). The first is meant to signify\nthat the productive faculty of nature according to final causes must\nbe taken for a particular kind of causality; the second that it is\nat bottom quite similar to the mechanism of nature, and that its\ncontingent agreement with our artistic concepts and their rules should\nbe explained as a mere subjective condition of judging it, and not,\nfalsely, as a particular kind of natural production.\nIf we now speak of systems explanatory of nature in regard of final\ncauses, it must be remarked that they all controvert each other\ndogmatically, _i.e._ as to objective principles of the possibility of\nthings, whether there are causes which act designedly or whether they\nare quite without design. They do not dispute as to the subjective\nmaxims, by which we merely judge of the causes of such purposive\nproducts. In this latter case _disparate_ principles could very well\nbe unified; but in the former, contradictorily opposed laws annul each\nother and cannot subsist together.\nThere are two sorts of systems as to the Technic of nature, _i.e._\nits productive power in accordance with the rule of purposes; viz.\n_Idealism_ or _Realism_ of natural purposes. The first maintains that\nall purposiveness of nature is _undesigned_; the second that some (in\norganised beings) is _designed_. From this latter the hypothetical\nconsequence can be deduced that the Technic of Nature, as concerns\nall its other products in reference to the whole of nature, is also\ndesigned, _i.e._ is a purpose.\n(1) The _Idealism_ of purposiveness (I always understand here by\nthis, objective purposiveness) is either that of the _casuality_ or\nthe _fatality_ of the determination of nature in the purposive form\nof its products. The former principle treats of the reference of\nmatter to the physical basis of its form, viz. the laws of motion;\nthe second, its reference to the _hyperphysical_ basis of itself and\nof the whole of nature. The system of _casuality_ that is ascribed to\n_Epicurus_ or _Democritus_ is, taken literally, so plainly absurd\nthat it need not detain us. Opposed to this is the system of fatality,\nof which _Spinoza_ is taken as the author, although it is much\nolder according to all appearance. This, as it appeals to something\nsupersensible to which our insight does not extend, is not so easy to\ncontrovert; but that is because its concept of the original Being is\nnot possible to understand. But so much is clear, that on this theory\nthe purposive combination in the world must be taken as undesigned;\nfor although derived from an original Being, it is not derived from\nits Understanding or from any design on its part, but rather from\nthe necessity of its nature and of the world-unity which emanates\ntherefrom. Consequently the Fatalism of purposiveness is at the same\ntime an Idealism.\n(2) The _Realism_ of the purposiveness of nature is also either\nphysical or hyperphysical. The _former_ bases the purposes in nature,\nby the analogy of a faculty acting with design, on the _life of matter_\n(either its own or the life of an inner principle in it, a world-soul)\nand is called _Hylozoism_. The _latter_ derives them from the original\nground of the universe, as from an intelligent Being (originally\nliving), who produces them with design, and is _Theism_.[112]\n\u00a7 73. _None of the above systems give what they pretend_\nWhat do all these systems desire? They desire to explain our\nteleological judgements about nature, and they go so to work therewith\nthat some deny their truth and, consequently, explain them as an\nIdealism of Nature (represented as Art); others recognise them as true,\nand promise to establish the possibility of a nature in accordance with\nthe Idea of final causes.\n(1) The systems which defend the Idealism of final causes in nature\ngrant, it is true, on the one hand to their principle a causality in\naccordance with the laws of motion (through which [causality] natural\nthings exist purposively); but they deny to it _intentionality_, _i.e._\nthat it designedly determines itself to this its purposive production;\nin other words, they deny that the cause is a purpose. This is\n_Epicurus\u2019s_ method of explanation, according to which the distinction\nbetween a Technic of nature and mere mechanism is altogether denied.\nBlind chance is taken as the explanatory ground not only of the\nagreement of the developed products with our concepts of the purpose,\nand consequently of [nature\u2019s] Technic; but also of the determination\nof the causes of this production in accordance with the laws of motion,\nand consequently of their mechanism. Thus nothing is explained, not\neven the illusion in our teleological judgements, and consequently, the\nwould-be Idealism of these in no way established.\nOn the other hand, _Spinoza_ wishes to dispense with all inquiries into\nthe ground of the possibility of purposes of nature, and to take away\nall reality from this Idea. He allows their validity in general not as\nproducts but as accidents inhering in an original Being; and to this\nBeing, as substrate of those natural things, he ascribes not causality\nin regard to them but mere subsistence. On account of its unconditioned\nnecessity, and also that of all natural things as accidents inhering\nin it, he secures, it is true, to the forms of nature that unity of\nground which is requisite for all purposiveness; but at the same time\nhe tears away their contingence, without which no _unity of purpose_\ncan be thought, and with it all _design_, inasmuch as he takes away all\nintelligence from the original ground of natural things.\nBut Spinozism does not furnish what it desires. It desires to afford\nan explanatory ground of the purposive connexion (which it does not\ndeny) of the things of nature, and it merely speaks of the unity of the\nsubject in which they all inhere. But even if we concede to it that\nthe beings of the world exist in this way, such ontological unity is\nnot therefore a _unity of purpose_, and does not make this in any way\ncomprehensible. For this latter is a quite particular kind of unity\nwhich does not follow from the connexion of things (the beings of\nthe world) in a subject (the original Being), but implies in itself\nreference to a _cause_ which has Understanding; and even if we unite\nall these things in a simple subject, this never exhibits a purposive\nreference. For we do not think of them, first, as the inner _effects_\nof the substance, as if it were a _cause_; nor, secondly, of this\ncause as a cause producing effects _by means of its Understanding_.\nWithout these formal conditions all unity is mere natural necessity;\nand, if it is ascribed as well to things which we represent as\nexternal to one another, blind necessity. But if we wish to give the\nname of purposiveness of nature to that which the schoolmen call the\ntranscendental perfection of things (in reference to their proper\nbeing), according to which everything has in itself that which is\nrequisite to make it one thing and not another, then we are only like\nchildren playing with words instead of concepts. For if all things\nmust be thought as purposes, then to be a thing is the same as to be a\npurpose, and there is at bottom nothing which specially deserves to be\nrepresented as a purpose.\nWe hence see at once that Spinoza by his reducing our concepts of\nthe purposive in nature to our own consciousness of existing in an\nall-embracing (though simple) Being, and by his seeking that form\nmerely in the unity of this Being, must have intended to maintain not\nthe realism, but the idealism of its purposiveness. Even this he was\nnot able to accomplish, because the mere representation of the unity of\nthe substrate cannot bring about the Idea of a purposiveness, even that\nwhich is only undesigned.\n(2) Those who not only maintain the _Realism_ of natural purposes, but\nalso set about explaining it, believe that they can comprehend, at\nleast as regards its possibility, a practical kind of causality, viz.\nthat of causes working designedly; otherwise they could not undertake\nto supply this explanation. For to authorise even the most daring of\nhypotheses, at least the _possibility_ of what we assume as basis must\nbe _certain_, and we must be able to assure objective reality to its\nconcept.\nBut the possibility of living matter cannot even be thought; its\nconcept involves a contradiction because lifelessness, _inertia_,\nconstitutes the essential character of matter. The possibility of\nmatter endowed with life, and of collective nature regarded as an\nanimal, can only be used in an inadequate way (in the interests of\nthe hypothesis of purposiveness in the whole of nature), so far as it\nis manifested by experience in the organisation of nature on a small\nscale; but in no way can we have insight into its possibility _a\npriori_. There must then be a circle in the explanation, if we wish to\nderive the purposiveness of nature in organised beings from the life\nof matter, and yet only know this life in organised beings, and can\nform no concept of its possibility without experience of this kind.\nHylozoism, therefore, does not furnish what it promises.\nFinally, _Theism_ can just as little establish dogmatically the\npossibility of natural purposes as a key to Teleology; although it\ncertainly is superior to all other grounds of explanation in that,\nthrough the Understanding which it ascribes to the original Being, it\nrescues in the best way the purposiveness of nature from Idealism, and\nintroduces a causality acting with design for its production.\nBut we must first prove satisfactorily to the determinant Judgement the\nimpossibility of the unity of purpose in matter resulting from its mere\nmechanism, before we are justified in placing the ground of this beyond\nnature in a determinate way. We can, however, advance no further than\nthis. In accordance with the constitution and limits of our cognitive\nfaculties (whilst we do not comprehend even the first inner ground\nof this mechanism) we must in no wise seek in matter a principle of\ndeterminate purposive references; but no other way of judging of the\norigination of its products as natural purposes remains to us than\nthat by means of a supreme Understanding as cause of the world. But\nthis is only a ground for the reflective, not for the determinant\nJudgement, and can justify absolutely no objective assertion.\n\u00a7 74. _The reason that we cannot treat the concept of a Technic of\nnature dogmatically is the fact that a natural purpose is inexplicable_\nWe deal with a concept dogmatically (even though it should be\nempirically conditioned) if we consider it as contained under another\nconcept of the Object which constitutes a principle[113] of Reason,\nand determine it in conformity with this. But we deal with it merely\ncritically, if we consider it only in reference to our cognitive\nfaculties and consequently to the subjective conditions of thinking\nit, without undertaking to decide anything about its Object. Dogmatic\nprocedure with a concept is then that which is conformable to law\nfor the determinant Judgement, critical procedure for the reflective\nJudgement.\nNow the concept of a thing as a natural purpose is a concept which\nsubsumes nature under a causality only thinkable through Reason,\nin order to judge in accordance with this principle about that\nwhich is given of the Object in experience. But in order to use it\ndogmatically for the determinant Judgement, we must be assured first\nof the objective reality of this concept, because otherwise we could\nsubsume no natural thing under it. Again, the concept of a thing as\na natural purpose is, no doubt, empirically conditioned, _i.e._ only\npossible under certain conditions given in experience, though not to be\nabstracted therefrom; but it is a concept only possible in accordance\nwith a rational principle in the judgement about the object. Its\nobjective reality, therefore (_i.e._ that an object in conformity with\nit is possible), cannot be comprehended and dogmatically established as\nsuch a principle; and we do not know whether it is merely a sophistical\nand objectively empty concept (_conceptus ratiocinans_), or a rational\nconcept, establishing a cognition and confirmed by Reason (_conceptus\nratiocinatus_).[114] Therefore it cannot be dogmatically treated for\nthe determinant Judgement, _i.e._ it is not only impossible to decide\nwhether or not things of nature considered as natural purposes require\nfor their production a causality of a quite peculiar kind (that acting\non design); but the question cannot even be put, because the concept of\na natural purpose is simply not susceptible of proof through Reason as\nregards its objective reality. That is, it is not constitutive for the\ndeterminant Judgement, but merely regulative for the reflective.\nThat it is not susceptible of proof is clear because (as concept of\na _natural product_) it embraces in itself natural necessity, and at\nthe same time (as purpose) a contingency of the form of the Object (in\nreference to the mere laws of nature) in the very same thing. Hence,\nif there is to be no contradiction here it must contain a ground for\nthe possibility of the thing in nature, and also a ground of the\npossibility of this nature itself and of its reference to something\nwhich, not being empirically cognisable nature (supersensible), is\ntherefore for us not cognisable at all. [This is requisite] if it is\nto be judged according to a different kind of causality from that\nof natural mechanism when we wish to establish its possibility. The\nconcept of a thing, then, as a natural purpose, is transcendent _for\nthe determinant Judgement_, if we consider the Object through Reason\n(although for the reflective Judgement it certainly may be immanent in\nrespect of the objects of experience). Hence for determinant judgements\nobjective reality cannot be supplied to it; and so it is intelligible\nhow all systems that one may project for the dogmatic treatment of\nthe concept of natural purposes and of nature itself [considered]\nas a whole connected together by means of final causes, can decide\nnothing either by objective affirmation or by objective denial. For if\nthings be subsumed under a concept that is merely problematical, its\nsynthetical predicates (_e.g._ in the question whether the purpose of\nnature which we conceive for the production of things is designed or\nundesigned) can furnish only problematical judgements of the Object,\nwhether affirmative or negative; and we do not know whether we are\njudging about something or about nothing. The concept of a causality\nthrough purposes (of art) has at all events objective reality, and\nalso the concept of a causality according to the mechanism of nature.\nBut the concept of a causality of nature according to the rule of\npurposes,--still more of a Being such as cannot be given us in\nexperience, a Being who is the original cause of nature,--though it\ncan be thought without contradiction, yet is of no avail for dogmatic\ndeterminations. For, since it cannot be derived from experience,\nand also is not requisite for the possibility thereof, its objective\nreality can in no way be assured. But even if this could be done, how\ncan I number among the products of nature things which are definitely\naccounted products of divine art, when it is just the incapacity of\nnature to produce such things according to its own laws that made it\nnecessary to invoke a cause different from it?\n\u00a7 75. _The concept of an objective purposiveness of nature is a\ncritical principle of Reason for the reflective Judgement_\nIt is then one thing to say, \u201cthe production of certain things of\nnature or that of collective nature is only possible through a cause\nwhich determines itself to action according to design\u201d; and quite\nanother to say, \u201cI can _according to the peculiar constitution of my\ncognitive faculties_ judge concerning the possibility of these things\nand their production, in no other fashion than by conceiving for this a\ncause working according to design, _i.e._ a Being which is productive\nin a way analogous to the causality of an intelligence.\u201d In the former\ncase I wish to establish something concerning the Object, and am\nbound to establish the objective reality of an assumed concept; in\nthe latter, Reason only determines the use of my cognitive faculties,\nconformably to their peculiarities and to the essential conditions\nof their range and their limits. Thus the former principle is an\nobjective proposition for the determinant Judgement, the latter merely\na subjective proposition for the reflective Judgement, _i.e._ a maxim\nwhich Reason prescribes to it.\nWe are in fact indispensably obliged to ascribe the concept of design\nto nature if we wish to investigate it, though only in its organised\nproducts, by continuous observation; and this concept is therefore an\nabsolutely necessary maxim for the empirical use of our Reason. It\nis plain that once such a guiding thread for the study of nature is\nadmitted and verified, we must at least try the said maxim of Judgement\nin nature as a whole; because thereby many of nature\u2019s laws might\ndiscover themselves, which otherwise, on account of the limitation\nof our insight into its inner mechanism, would remain hidden. But\nthough in regard to this latter employment that maxim of Judgement is\ncertainly useful, it is not indispensable, for nature as a whole is not\ngiven as organised (in the narrow sense of the word above indicated).\nOn the other hand, in regard to those natural products, which must\nbe judged of as designed and not formed otherwise (if we are to have\nempirical knowledge of their inner constitution), this maxim of the\nreflective Judgement is essentially necessary; because the very thought\nof them as organised beings is impossible without combining therewith\nthe thought of their designed production.\nNow the concept of a thing whose existence or form we represent to\nourselves as possible under the condition of a purpose is inseparably\nbound up with the concept of its contingency (according to natural\nlaws). Hence the natural things that we find possible only as purposes\nsupply the best proof of the contingency of the world-whole; to the\ncommon Understanding and to the philosopher alike they are the only\nvalid ground of proof for its dependence on and origin from a Being\nexisting outside the world--a Being who must also be intelligent on\naccount of that purposive form. Teleology then finds the consummation\nof its investigations only in Theology.\nBut what now in the end does the most complete Teleology prove? Does\nit prove that there is such an intelligent Being? No. It only proves\nthat according to the constitution of our cognitive faculties and in\nthe consequent combination of experience with the highest principles of\nReason, we can form absolutely no concept of the possibility of such a\nworld [as this] save by thinking a _designedly-working_ supreme cause\nthereof. Objectively we cannot therefore lay down the proposition,\nthere is an intelligent original Being; but only subjectively, for the\nuse of our Judgement in its reflection upon the purposes in nature,\nwhich can be thought according to no other principle than that of a\ndesigning causality of a highest cause.\nIf we wished to establish on teleological grounds the above proposition\ndogmatically we should be beset with difficulties from which we could\nnot extricate ourselves. For then the proposition must at bottom be\nreduced to the conclusion, that the organised beings in the world\nare no otherwise possible than by a designedly-working cause. And we\nshould unavoidably have to assert that, because we can follow up these\nthings in their causal combination only under the Idea of purposes, and\ncognise them only according to their conformity to law, we are thereby\njustified in assuming this as a condition necessary for every thinking\nand cognising being--a condition consequently attaching to the Object\nand not merely to our subject. But such an assertion we do not succeed\nin sustaining. For, since we do not, properly speaking, _observe_ the\npurposes in nature as designed, but only in our reflection upon its\nproducts _think_ this concept as a guiding thread for our Judgement,\nthey are not given to us through the Object. It is quite impossible for\nus _a priori_ to vindicate, as capable of assumption, such a concept\naccording to its objective reality. It remains therefore a proposition\nabsolutely resting upon subjective conditions alone, viz. of the\nJudgement reflecting in conformity with our cognitive faculties. If\nwe expressed this proposition dogmatically as objectively valid, it\nwould be: \u201cThere is a God.\u201d But for us men there is only permissible\nthe limited formula: \u201cWe cannot otherwise think and make comprehensible\nthe purposiveness which must lie at the bottom of our cognition of\nthe internal possibility of many natural things, than by representing\nit and the world in general as a product of an intelligent cause, [a\nGod].\u201d[115]\nNow if this proposition, based on an inevitably necessary maxim of our\nJudgement, is completely satisfactory from every _human_ point of view\nfor both the speculative and practical use of our Reason, I should like\nto know what we lose by not being able to prove it as also valid for\nhigher beings, from objective grounds (which unfortunately are beyond\nour faculties). It is indeed quite certain that we cannot adequately\ncognise, much less explain, organised beings and their internal\npossibility, according to mere mechanical principles of nature; and we\ncan say boldly it is alike certain that it is absurd for men to make\nany such attempt or to hope that another _Newton_ will arise in the\nfuture, who shall make comprehensible by us the production of a blade\nof grass according to natural laws which no design has ordered.[116]\nWe must absolutely deny this insight to men. But then how do we know\nthat in nature, if we could penetrate to the principle by which it\nspecifies the universal laws known to us, there _cannot_ lie hidden (in\nits mere mechanism) a sufficient ground of the possibility of organised\nbeings without supposing any design in their production? would it\nnot be judged by us presumptuous to say this? Probabilities here are\nof no account when we have to do with judgements of pure Reason.--We\ncannot therefore judge objectively, either affirmatively or negatively,\nconcerning the proposition: \u201cDoes a Being acting according to design\nlie at the basis of what we rightly call natural purposes, as the cause\nof the world (and consequently as its author)?\u201d So much only is sure,\nthat if we are to judge according to what is permitted us to see by\nour own proper nature (the conditions and limitations of our Reason),\nwe can place at the basis of the possibility of these natural purposes\nnothing else than an intelligent Being. This alone is in conformity\nwith the maxim of our reflective Judgement and therefore with a ground\nwhich, though subjective, is inseparably attached to the human race.\n\u00a7 76. _Remark_\nThis consideration, which very well deserves to be worked out in\ndetail in Transcendental Philosophy, can come in here only in passing,\nby way of elucidation (not as a proof of what is here proposed).\nReason is a faculty of principles and proceeds in its extremest advance\nto the unconditioned; on the other hand, the Understanding stands at\nits service always only under a certain condition which must be given.\nBut without concepts of Understanding, to which objective reality\nmust be given, the Reason cannot form any objective (synthetical)\njudgement; and contains in itself, as theoretical Reason, absolutely\nno constitutive but merely regulative principles. We soon see that\nwhere the Understanding cannot follow, the Reason is transcendent, and\nshows itself in Ideas formerly established (as regulative principles),\nbut not in objectively valid concepts. But the Understanding which\ncannot keep pace with Reason but yet is requisite for the validity of\nObjects, limits the validity of these Ideas to the subject, although\n[extending it] generally to all [subjects] of this kind. That is, the\nUnderstanding limits their validity to the condition, that according\nto the nature of our (human) cognitive faculties, or, generally,\naccording to the concept which we _ourselves_ can _make_ of the faculty\nof a finite intelligent being, nothing else can or must be thought;\nthough this is not to assert that the ground of such a judgement lies\nin the Object. We shall adduce some examples which, though they are\ntoo important and difficult to impose them on the reader as proved\npropositions, yet will give him material for thought and may serve to\nelucidate what we are here specially concerned with.\nIt is indispensably necessary for the human Understanding to\ndistinguish between the possibility and the actuality of things. The\nground for this lies in the subject and in the nature of our cognitive\nfaculties. Such a distinction (between the possible and the actual)\nwould not be given were there not requisite for knowledge two quite\ndifferent elements, Understanding for concepts and sensible intuition\nfor Objects corresponding to them. If our Understanding were intuitive\nit would have no objects but those which are actual. Concepts (which\nmerely extend to the possibility of an object) and sensible intuitions\n(which give us something without allowing us to cognise it thus as an\nobject) would both disappear. But now the whole of our distinction\nbetween the merely possible and the actual rests on this, that the\nformer only signifies the positing of the representation of a thing\nin respect of our concept, and, in general, in respect of the faculty\nof thought; while the latter signifies the positing of the thing in\nitself [outside this concept].[117] The distinction, then, of possible\nthings from actual is one which has merely subjective validity for the\nhuman Understanding, because we can always have a thing in our thoughts\nalthough it is [really] nothing, or we can represent a thing as given\nalthough we have no concept of it. The propositions therefore--that\nthings can be possible without being actual, and that consequently no\nconclusion can be drawn as to actuality from mere possibility--are\nquite valid for human Reason, without thereby proving that this\ndistinction lies in things themselves. That this does not follow, and\nthat consequently these propositions, though valid of Objects (in\nso far as our cognitive faculty, as sensuously conditioned, busies\nitself with Objects of sense), do not hold for things in general,\nappears from the irrepressible demand of Reason to assume something\n(the original ground) necessarily existing as unconditioned, in which\npossibility and actuality should no longer be distinguished, and\nfor which Idea our Understanding has absolutely no concept; _i.e._\nit can find no way of representing such a thing and its manner of\nexistence. For if the Understanding _thinks_ such a thing (which it\nmay do at pleasure), the thing is merely represented as possible. If\nit is conscious of it as given in intuition, then is it actual; but\nnothing as to its possibility is thus thought. Hence the concept of\nan absolutely necessary Being is no doubt an indispensable Idea of\nReason, but yet it is a problematical concept unattainable by the human\nUnderstanding. It is indeed valid for the employment of our cognitive\nfaculties in accordance with their peculiar constitution, but not\nvalid of the Object. Nor is it valid for every knowing being, because\nI cannot presuppose in every such being thought and intuition as two\ndistinct conditions of the exercise of its cognitive faculties, and\nconsequently as conditions of the possibility and actuality of things.\nAn Understanding into which this distinction did not enter, might\nsay: All Objects that I know _are_, _i.e._ exist; and the possibility\nof some, which yet do not exist (_i.e._ the contingency or the\ncontrasted necessity of those which do exist), might never come into\nthe representation of such a being at all. But what makes it difficult\nfor our Understanding to treat its concepts here as Reason does, is\nmerely that for it, as human Understanding, that is transcendent\n(_i.e._ impossible for the subjective conditions of its cognition)\nwhich Reason makes into a principle appertaining to the Object.--Here\nthe maxim always holds, that all Objects whose cognition surpasses\nthe faculty of the Understanding are thought by us according to the\nsubjective conditions of the exercise of that faculty which necessarily\nattach to our (human) nature. If judgements laid down in this way (and\nthere is no other alternative in regard to transcendent concepts)\ncannot be constitutive principles determining the Object as it is, they\nwill remain regulative principles adapted to the human point of view,\nimmanent in their exercise and sure.\nJust as Reason in the theoretical consideration of nature must assume\nthe Idea of an unconditioned necessity of its original ground, so also\nit presupposes in the practical [sphere] its own (in respect of nature)\nunconditioned causality, or freedom, in that it is conscious of its\nown moral command. Here the objective necessity of the act, as a duty,\nis opposed to that necessity which it would have as an event, if its\nground lay in nature and not in freedom (_i.e._ in the causality of\nReason). The morally absolutely necessary act is regarded as physically\nquite contingent, since that which _ought_ necessarily to happen often\ndoes not happen. It is clear then that it is owing to the subjective\nconstitution of our practical faculty that the moral laws must be\nrepresented as commands, and the actions conforming to them as duties;\nand that Reason expresses this necessity not by an \u201c_is_\u201d (happens),\nbut by an \u201cought to be.\u201d This would not be the case were Reason\nconsidered as in its causality independent of sensibility (as the\nsubjective condition of its application to objects of nature), and so\nas cause in an intelligible world entirely in agreement with the moral\nlaw. For in such a world there would be no distinction between \u201cought\nto do\u201d and \u201cdoes,\u201d between a practical law of that which is possible\nthrough us, and the theoretical law of that which is actual through\nus. Though, therefore, an intelligible world in which everything would\nbe actual merely because (as something good) it is possible, together\nwith freedom as its formal condition, is for us a transcendent concept,\nnot available as a constitutive principle to determine an Object and\nits objective reality; yet, because of the constitution of our (in\npart sensuous) nature and faculty it is, so far as we can represent\nit in accordance with the constitution of our Reason, for us and for\nall rational beings that have a connexion with the world of sense, a\nuniversal _regulative principle_. This principle does not objectively\ndetermine the constitution of freedom, as a form of causality, but it\nmakes the rule of actions according to that Idea a command for every\none, with no less validity than if it did so determine it.\nIn the same way we may concede thus much as regards the case in hand.\nBetween natural mechanism and the Technic of nature, _i.e._ its\npurposive connexion, we should find no distinction, were it not that\nour Understanding is of the kind that must proceed from the universal\nto the particular. The Judgement then in respect of the particular can\ncognise no purposiveness and, consequently, can form no determinant\njudgements, without having a universal law under which to subsume that\nparticular. Now the particular, as such, contains something contingent\nin respect of the universal, while yet Reason requires unity and\nconformity to law in the combination of particular laws of nature.\nThis conformity of the contingent to law is called purposiveness; and\nthe derivation of particular laws from the universal, as regards their\ncontingent element, is impossible _a priori_ through a determination\nof the concept of the Object. Hence, the concept of the purposiveness\nof nature in its products is necessary for human Judgement in respect\nof nature, but has not to do with the determination of Objects. It is,\ntherefore, a subjective principle of Reason for the Judgement, which\nas regulative (not constitutive) is just as necessarily valid for our\n_human Judgement_ as if it were an objective principle.\n\u00a7 77. _Of the peculiarity of the human Understanding, by means of which\nthe concept of a natural purpose is possible_\nWe have brought forward in the _Remark_ peculiarities of our cognitive\nfaculties (even the higher ones) which we are easily led to transfer as\nobjective predicates to the things themselves. But they concern Ideas,\nno object adequate to which can be given in experience, and they could\nonly serve as regulative principles in the pursuit of experience. This\nis the case with the concept of a natural purpose, which concerns the\ncause of the possibility of such a predicate, which cause can only lie\nin the Idea. But the result corresponding to it (_i.e._ the product)\nis given in nature; and the concept of a causality of nature as of a\nbeing acting according to purposes seems to make the Idea of a natural\npurpose into a constitutive principle, which Idea has thus something\ndifferent from all other Ideas.\nThis difference consists, however, in the fact that the Idea in\nquestion is not a rational principle for the Understanding but\nfor the Judgement. It is, therefore, merely the application of an\nUnderstanding in general to possible objects of experience, in cases\nwhere the judgement can only be reflective, not determinant, and where,\nconsequently, the object, although given in experience, cannot be\n_determinately judged_ in conformity with the Idea (not to say with\ncomplete adequacy), but can only be reflected on.\nThere emerges, therefore, a peculiarity of _our_ (human) Understanding\nin respect of the Judgement in its reflection upon things of nature.\nBut if this be so, the Idea of a possible Understanding different\nfrom the human must be fundamental here. (Just so in the Critique\nof Pure Reason we must have in our thoughts another possible [kind\nof] intuition, if ours is to be regarded as a particular species\nfor which objects are only valid as phenomena.) And so we are able\nto say: Certain natural products, from the special constitution of\nour Understanding, _must be considered by us_, in regard to their\npossibility, as if produced designedly and as purposes. But we\ndo not, therefore, demand that there should be actually given a\nparticular cause which has the representation of a purpose as its\ndetermining ground; and we do not deny that an Understanding, different\nfrom (_i.e._ higher than) the human, might find the ground of the\npossibility of such products of nature in the mechanism of nature,\n_i.e._ in a causal combination for which an Understanding is not\nexplicitly assumed as cause.\nWe have now to do with the relation of _our_ Understanding to the\nJudgement; viz. we seek for a certain contingency in the constitution\nof our Understanding, to which we may point as a peculiarity\ndistinguishing it from other possible Understandings.\nThis contingency is found, naturally enough, in the _particular_,\nwhich the Judgement is to bring under the _universal_ of the concepts\nof Understanding. For the universal of _our_ (human) Understanding does\nnot determine the particular, and it is contingent in how many ways\ndifferent things which agree in a common characteristic may come before\nour perception. Our Understanding is a faculty of concepts, _i.e._ a\ndiscursive Understanding, for which it obviously must be contingent\nof what kind and how very different the particular may be that can be\ngiven to it in nature and brought under its concepts. But now intuition\nalso belongs to knowledge, and a faculty of a _complete spontaneity\nof intuition_ would be a cognitive faculty distinct from sensibility,\nand quite independent of it, in other words, an Understanding in the\nmost general sense. Thus we can think an _intuitive_ Understanding\n[negatively, merely as not discursive[118]], which does not proceed\nfrom the universal to the particular, and so to the individual (through\nconcepts). For it that contingency of the accordance of nature in its\nproducts according to _particular_ laws with the Understanding would\nnot be met with; and it is this contingency that makes it so hard for\nour Understanding to reduce the manifold of nature to the unity of\nknowledge. This reduction our Understanding can only accomplish by\nbringing natural characteristics into a very contingent correspondence\nwith our faculty of concepts, of which an intuitive Understanding would\nhave no need.\nOur Understanding has then this peculiarity as concerns the Judgement,\nthat in cognition by it the particular is not determined by the\nuniversal and cannot therefore be derived from it; but at the same\ntime this particular in the manifold of nature must accord with the\nuniversal (by means of concepts and laws) so that it may be capable\nof being subsumed under it. This accordance under such circumstances\nmust be very contingent and without definite principle as concerns the\nJudgement.\nIn order now to be able at least to think the possibility of such an\naccordance of things of nature with our Judgement (which accordance\nwe represent as contingent and consequently as only possible by means\nof a purpose directed thereto), we must at the same time think of\nanother Understanding, by reference to which and apart from any purpose\nascribed to it, we may represent as _necessary_ that accordance of\nnatural laws with our Judgement, which for our Understanding is only\nthinkable through the medium of purposes.\nIn fact our Understanding has the property of proceeding in\nits cognition, _e.g._ of the cause of a product, from the\n_analytical-universal_ (concepts) to the particular (the given\nempirical intuition). Thus as regards the manifold of the latter it\ndetermines nothing, but must await this determination by the Judgement,\nwhich subsumes the empirical intuition (if the object is a natural\nproduct) under the concept. We can however think an Understanding\nwhich, being, not like ours, discursive, but intuitive, proceeds from\nthe _synthetical-universal_ (the intuition of a whole as such) to the\nparticular, _i.e._ from the whole to the parts. The _contingency_\nof the combination of the parts, in order that a definite form of\nthe whole shall be possible, is not implied by such an Understanding\nand its representation of the whole. Our Understanding requires this\nbecause it must proceed from the parts as universally conceived\ngrounds to different forms possible to be subsumed under them, as\nconsequences. According to the constitution of our Understanding a\nreal whole of nature is regarded only as the effect of the concurrent\nmotive powers of the parts. Suppose then that we wish not to represent\nthe possibility of the whole as dependent on that of the parts (after\nthe manner of our discursive Understanding), but according to the\nstandard of the intuitive (original) Understanding to represent\nthe possibility of the parts (according to their constitution and\ncombination) as dependent on that of the whole. In accordance with the\nabove peculiarity of our Understanding it cannot happen that the whole\nshall contain the ground of the possibility of the connexion of the\nparts (which would be a contradiction in discursive cognition), but\nonly that the _representation_ of a whole may contain the ground of the\npossibility of its form and the connexion of the parts belonging to it.\nNow such a whole would be an effect (_product_) the _representation_ of\nwhich is regarded as the _cause_ of its possibility; but the product\nof a cause whose determining ground is merely the representation of\nits effect is called a purpose. Hence it is merely a consequence of\nthe particular constitution of our Understanding, that it represents\nproducts of nature as possible, according to a different kind of\ncausality from that of the natural laws of matter, namely, that of\npurposes and final causes. Hence also this principle has not to do\nwith the possibility of such things themselves (even when considered\nas phenomena) according to the manner of their production, but merely\nwith the judgement upon them which is possible to our Understanding.\nHere we see at once why it is that in natural science we are not\nlong contented with an explanation of the products of nature by a\ncausality according to purposes. For there we desire to judge of\nnatural production merely in a manner conformable to our faculty of\njudging, _i.e._ to the reflective Judgement, and not in reference to\nthings themselves on behalf of the determinant Judgement. It is here\nnot at all requisite to prove that such an _intellectus archetypus_ is\npossible, but only that we are led to the Idea of it,--which contains\nno contradiction,--in contrast to our discursive Understanding which\nhas need of images (_intellectus ectypus_) and to the contingency of\nits constitution.\nIf we consider a material whole, according to its form, as a product\nof the parts with their powers and faculties of combining with one\nanother (as well as of bringing in foreign materials), we represent to\nourselves a mechanical mode of producing it. But in this way no concept\nemerges of a whole as purpose, whose internal possibility presupposes\nthroughout the Idea of a whole on which depend the constitution and\nmode of action of the parts, as we must represent to ourselves an\norganised body. It does not follow indeed, as has been shown, that\nthe mechanical production of such a body is impossible; for to say so\nwould be to say that it would be impossible (contradictory) for _any\nUnderstanding_ to represent to itself such a unity in the connexion of\nthe manifold, without the Idea of the unity being at the same time its\nproducing cause, _i.e._ without designed production. This, however,\nwould follow in fact if we were justified in regarding material beings\nas things in themselves. For then the unity that constitutes the\nground of the possibility of natural formations would be simply the\nunity of space. But space is no real ground of the products, but only\ntheir formal condition, although it has this similarity to the real\nground which we seek that in it no part can be determined except in\nrelation to the whole (the representation of which therefore lies at\nthe ground of the possibility of the parts). But now it is at least\npossible to consider the material world as mere phenomenon, and to\nthink as its substrate something like a thing in itself (which is\nnot phenomenon), and to attach to this a corresponding intellectual\nintuition (even though it is not ours). Thus there would be, although\nincognisable by us, a supersensible real ground for nature, to which\nwe ourselves belong. In this we consider according to mechanical laws\nwhat is necessary in nature regarded as an object of Sense; but we\nconsider according to teleological laws the agreement and unity of its\nparticular laws and its forms--which in regard to mechanism we must\njudge contingent--regarded as objects of Reason (in fact the whole\nof nature as a system). Thus we should judge nature according to two\ndifferent kinds of principles without the mechanical way of explanation\nbeing shut out by the teleological, as if they contradicted one another.\nFrom this we are enabled to see what otherwise, though we could easily\nsurmise it, could with difficulty be maintained with certainty and\nproved, viz. that the principle of a mechanical derivation of purposive\nnatural products is consistent with the teleological, but in no way\nenables us to dispense with it. In a thing that we must judge as a\nnatural purpose (an organised being) we can no doubt try all the known\nand yet to be discovered laws of mechanical production, and even hope\nto make good progress therewith; but we can never get rid of the call\nfor a quite different ground of production for the possibility of such\na product, viz. causality by means of purposes. Absolutely no human\nReason (in fact no finite Reason like ours in quality, however much it\nmay surpass it in degree) can hope to understand the production of even\na blade of grass by mere mechanical causes. As regards the possibility\nof such an object, the teleological connexion of causes and effects\nis quite indispensable for the Judgement, even for studying it by the\nclue of experience. For external objects as phenomena an adequate\nground related to purposes cannot be met with; this, although it lies\nin nature, must only be sought in the supersensible substrate of\nnature, from all possible insight into which we are cut off. Hence it\nis absolutely impossible for us to produce from nature itself grounds\nof explanation for purposive combinations; and it is necessary by the\nconstitution of the human cognitive faculties to seek the supreme\nground of these purposive combinations in an original Understanding as\nthe cause of the world.\n\u00a7 78. _Of the union of the principle of the universal mechanism of\nmatter with the teleological principle in the Technic of nature_\nIt is infinitely important for Reason not to let slip the mechanism\nof nature in its products, and in their explanation not to pass it\nby, because without it no insight into the nature of things can be\nattained. Suppose it admitted that a supreme Architect immediately\ncreated the forms of nature as they have been from the beginning, or\nthat He predetermined those which in the course of nature continually\nform themselves on the same model. Our knowledge of nature is not thus\nin the least furthered, because we cannot know the mode of action of\nthat Being and the Ideas which are to contain the principles of the\npossibility of natural beings, and we cannot by them explain nature\nas from above downwards (_a priori_). And if, starting from the forms\nof the objects of experience, from below upwards (_a posteriori_),\nwe wish to explain the purposiveness, which we believe is met with\nin experience, by appealing to a cause working in accordance with\npurposes, then is our explanation quite tautological and we are only\nmocking Reason with words. Indeed when we lose ourselves with this way\nof explanation in the transcendent, whither natural knowledge cannot\nfollow, Reason is seduced into poetical extravagance, which it is its\npeculiar destination to avoid.\nOn the other hand, it is just as necessary a maxim of Reason not\nto pass by the principle of purposes in the products of nature.\nFor, although it does not make their mode of origination any more\ncomprehensible, yet it is a heuristic principle for investigating the\nparticular laws of nature; supposing even that we wish to make no use\nof it for explaining nature itself,--in which we still always speak\nonly of natural purposes, although it apparently exhibits a designed\nunity of purpose,--_i.e._ without seeking beyond nature the ground of\nthe possibility of these particular laws. But since we must come in\nthe end to this latter question, it is just as necessary to think for\nnature a particular kind of causality which does not present itself in\nit, as the mechanism of natural causes which does. To the receptivity\nof several forms, different from those of which matter is susceptible\nby mechanism, must be added a spontaneity of a cause (which therefore\ncannot be matter), without which no ground can be assigned for those\nforms. No doubt Reason, before it takes this step, must proceed with\ncaution, and not try to explain teleologically every Technic of nature,\n_i.e._ every productive faculty of nature which displays in itself (as\nin regular bodies) purposiveness of figure to our mere apprehension;\nbut must always regard such as so far mechanically possible. But on\nthat account to wish entirely to exclude the teleological principle,\nand to follow simple mechanism only--in cases where, in the rational\ninvestigation of the possibility of natural forms through their causes,\npurposiveness shows itself quite undeniably as the reference to a\ndifferent kind of causality--to do this must make Reason fantastic, and\nsend it wandering among chimeras of unthinkable natural faculties; just\nas a mere teleological mode of explanation which takes no account of\nnatural mechanism makes it visionary.\nIn the same natural thing both principles cannot be connected as\nfundamental propositions of explanation (deduction) of one by the\nother, _i.e._ they do not unite for the determinant Judgement as\ndogmatical and constitutive principles of insight into nature. If I\nchoose, _e.g._ to regard a maggot as the product of the mere mechanism\nof nature (of the new formation that it produces of itself, when\nits elements are set free by corruption), I cannot derive the same\nproduct from the same matter as from a causality that acts according\nto purposes. Conversely, if I regard the same product as a natural\npurpose, I cannot count on any mechanical mode of its production and\nregard this as the constitutive principle of my judgement upon its\npossibility, and so unite both principles. One method of explanation\nexcludes the other; even supposing that objectively both grounds of\nthe possibility of such a product rested on a single ground, to which\nwe did not pay attention. The principle which should render possible\nthe compatibility of both in judging of nature must be placed in\nthat which lies outside both (and consequently outside the possible\nempirical representation of nature), but yet contains their ground,\n_i.e._ in the supersensible; and each of the two methods of explanation\nmust be referred thereto. Now of this we can have no concept but the\nindeterminate concept of a ground, which makes the judging of nature\nby empirical laws possible, but which we cannot determine more nearly\nby any predicate. Hence the union of both principles cannot rest upon\na ground of _explanation_ of the possibility of a product according to\ngiven laws, for the _determinant_ Judgement, but only upon a ground\nof its _exposition_ for the _reflective_ Judgement.--To explain is to\nderive from a principle, which therefore we must clearly know and of\nwhich we can give an account. No doubt the principle of the mechanism\nof nature and that of its causality in one and the same natural product\nmust coalesce in a single higher principle, which is their common\nsource, because otherwise they could not subsist side by side in the\nobservation of nature. But if this principle, objectively common to\nthe two, which therefore warrants the association of the maxims of\nnatural investigation depending on both, be such that, though it\ncan be pointed to, it cannot be determinately known nor clearly put\nforward for use in cases which arise, then from such a principle we\ncan draw no explanation, _i.e._ no clear and determinate derivation\nof the possibility of a natural product in accordance with those\ntwo heterogeneous principles. But now the principle common to the\nmechanical and teleological derivations is the _supersensible_, which\nwe must place at the basis of nature, regarded as phenomenon. And of\nthis, in a theoretical point of view, we cannot form the smallest\npositive determinate concept. It cannot, therefore, in any way be\nexplained how, according to it as principle, nature (in its particular\nlaws) constitutes for us one system, which can be cognised as possible\neither by the principle of physical development or by that of final\ncauses. If it happens that objects of nature present themselves which\ncannot be thought by us, as regards their possibility, according to\nthe principle of mechanism (which always has a claim on a natural\nbeing), without relying on teleological propositions, we can only make\nan hypothesis. Namely, we suppose that we may hopefully investigate\nnatural laws with reference to both (according as the possibility of\nits product is cognisable by our Understanding by one or the other\nprinciple), without stumbling at the apparent contradiction which comes\ninto view between the principles by which they are judged. For at least\nthe possibility is assured that both may be united objectively in one\nprinciple, since they concern phenomena that presuppose a supersensible\nground.\nMechanism, then, and the teleological (designed) Technic of nature,\nin respect of the same product and its possibility, may stand under\na common supreme principle of nature in particular laws. But since\nthis principle is _transcendent_ we cannot, because of the limitation\nof our Understanding, unite both principles _in the explanation_ of\nthe same production of nature even if the inner possibility of this\nproduct is only _intelligible_ [verst\u00e4ndlich] through a causality\naccording to purposes (as is the case with organised matter). We\nrevert then to the above fundamental proposition of Teleology.\nAccording to the constitution of the human Understanding, no other\nthan designedly-working causes can be assumed for the possibility of\norganised beings in nature; and the mere mechanism of nature cannot\nbe adequate to the explanation of these its products. But we do not\nattempt to decide anything by this fundamental proposition as to the\npossibility of such things themselves.\nThis is only a maxim of the reflective, not of the determinant\nJudgement; consequently only subjectively valid for us, not objectively\nfor the possibility of things themselves of this kind (in which both\nkinds of production may well cohere in one and the same ground).\nFurther, without any concept,--besides the teleologically conceived\nmethod of production,--of a simultaneously presented mechanism of\nnature, no judgement can be passed on this kind of production as a\nnatural product. Hence the above maxim leads to the necessity of\nan unification of both principles in judging of things as natural\npurposes in themselves, but does not lead us to substitute one for\nthe other either altogether or in certain parts. For in the place of\nwhat is thought (at least by us) as possible only by design we cannot\nset mechanism, and in the place of what is cognised as mechanically\nnecessary we cannot set contingency, which would need a purpose as its\ndetermining ground; but we can only subordinate the one (Mechanism)\nto the other (designed Technic), which may quite well be the case\naccording to the transcendental principle of the purposiveness of\nnature.\nFor where purposes are thought as grounds of the possibility of certain\nthings, we must assume also means, whose law of working requires _for\nitself_ nothing presupposing a purpose,--a mechanical law--and yet\ncan be a subordinate cause of designed effects. Thus--in the organic\nproducts of nature, and specially when prompted by their infinite\nnumber, we assume (at least as a permissible hypothesis) design in\nthe combination of natural causes by particular laws as a _universal\nprinciple_ of the reflective Judgement for the whole of nature (the\nworld),--we can think a great and indeed universal combination of\nmechanical with teleological laws in the productions of nature, without\ninterchanging the principles by which they are judged or putting one\nin the place of the other. For, in a teleological judgement, the\nmatter, even if the form that it assumes be judged possible only by\ndesign, can also, conformably to the mechanical laws of its nature,\nbe subordinated as a means to the represented purpose. But, since the\nground of this compatibility lies in that which is neither one nor\nthe other (neither mechanism nor purposive combination), but is the\nsupersensible substrate of nature of which we know nothing, the two\nways of representing the possibility of such Objects are not to be\nblended together by our (human) Reason. However, we cannot judge of\ntheir possibility otherwise than by judging them as ultimately resting\non a supreme Understanding by the connexion of final causes; and thus\nthe teleological method of explanation is not eliminated.\nNow it is quite indeterminate, and for our Understanding always\nindeterminable, how much the mechanism of nature does as a means\ntowards each final design in nature. However, on account of the\nabove-mentioned intelligible principle of the possibility of a nature\nin general, it may be assumed that it is possible throughout according\nto the two kinds of universally accordant laws (the physical and\nthose of final causes), although we cannot see into the way how this\ntakes place. Hence we do not know how far the mechanical method of\nexplanation which is possible for us may extend. So much only is\ncertain that, so far as we can go in this direction, it must always\nbe inadequate for things that we once recognise as natural purposes;\nand therefore we must, by the constitution of our Understanding,\nsubordinate these grounds collectively to a teleological principle.\nHereon is based a privilege, and on account of the importance which the\nstudy of nature by the principle of mechanism has for the theoretical\nuse of our Reason, also an appeal. We should explain all products\nand occurrences in nature, even the most purposive, by mechanism as\nfar as is in our power (the limits of which we cannot specify in\nthis kind of investigation). But at the same time we are not to lose\nsight of the fact that those things which we cannot even state for\ninvestigation except under the concept of a purpose of Reason, must, in\nconformity with the essential constitution of our Reason, mechanical\ncauses notwithstanding, be subordinated by us finally to causality in\naccordance with purposes.\nMETHODOLOGY OF THE TELEOLOGICAL JUDGEMENT.[119]\n\u00a7 79. _Whether teleology must be treated as if it belonged to the\ndoctrine of nature_\nEvery science must have its definite position in the encyclopaedia of\nall the sciences. If it is a philosophical science its position must be\neither in the theoretical or practical part. If again it has its place\nin the former of these, it must be either in the doctrine of nature, so\nfar as it concerns that which can be an object of experience (in the\ndoctrine of bodies, the doctrine of the soul, or the universal science\nof the world), or in the doctrine of God (the original ground of the\nworld as the complex of all objects of experience).\nNow the question is, what place is due to Teleology? Does it belong\nto Natural Science (properly so called) or to Theology? One of the\ntwo it must be; for no science belongs to the transition from one to\nthe other, because this transition only marks the articulation or\norganisation of the system, and not a place in it.\nThat it does not belong to Theology as a part thereof, although it may\nbe made of the most important use therein, is self-evident. For it has\nas its objects, natural productions, and their cause, and although it\nrefers at the same time to the latter as to a ground lying outside of\nand beyond nature (a Divine Author), yet it does not do this for the\ndeterminant but only for the reflective Judgement in the consideration\nof nature (in order to guide our judgement on things in the world by\nmeans of such an Idea as a regulative principle, in conformity with the\nhuman Understanding).\nBut it appears to belong just as little to Natural Science, which needs\ndeterminant and not merely reflective principles in order to supply\nobjective grounds for natural effects. In fact, nothing is gained for\nthe theory of nature or the mechanical explanation of its phenomena\nby means of its effective causes, by considering them as connected\naccording to the relation of purposes. The exhibition of the purposes\nof nature in its products, so far as they constitute a system according\nto teleological concepts, properly belongs only to a description of\nnature which is drawn up in accordance with a particular guiding\nthread. Here Reason, no doubt, accomplishes a noble work, instructive\nand practically purposive in many points of view; but it gives no\ninformation as to the origin and the inner possibility of these\nforms, which is the special business of theoretical Natural Science.\nTeleology, therefore, as science, belongs to no Doctrine, but only to\nCriticism; and to the criticism of a special cognitive faculty, viz.\nJudgement. But so far as it contains principles _a priori_, it can and\nmust furnish the method by which nature must be judged according to the\nprinciple of final causes. Hence its Methodology has at least negative\ninfluence upon the procedure in theoretical Natural Science, and also\nupon the relation which this can have in Metaphysic to Theology as its\npropaedeutic.\n\u00a7 80. _Of the necessary subordination of the mechanical to the\nteleological principle in the explanation of a thing as a natural\npurpose_\nThe _privilege of aiming at_ a merely mechanical method of explanation\nof all natural products is in itself quite unlimited; but the _faculty\nof attaining_ thereto is by the constitution of our Understanding, so\nfar as it has to do with things as natural purposes, not only very much\nlimited but also clearly bounded. For, according to a principle of the\nJudgement, by this process alone nothing can be accomplished towards\nan explanation of these things; and consequently the judgement upon\nsuch products must always be at the same time subordinated by us to a\nteleological principle.\nIt is therefore rational, even meritorious, to pursue natural\nmechanism, in respect of the explanation of natural products, so far\nas can be done with probability; and if we give up the attempt it is\nnot because it is impossible _in itself_ to meet in this path with the\npurposiveness of nature, but only because it is impossible _for us_\nas men. For there would be required for that an intuition other than\nsensuous, and a determinate knowledge of the intelligible substrate\nof nature from which a ground could be assigned for the mechanism of\nphenomena according to particular laws, which quite surpasses our\nfaculties.\nHence if the naturalist would not waste his labour he must in judging\nof things, the concept of any of which is indubitably established\nas a natural purpose (organised beings), always lay down as basis an\noriginal organisation, which uses that very mechanism in order to\nproduce fresh organised forms or to develop the existing ones into new\nshapes (which, however, always result from that purpose and conformably\nto it).\nIt is praiseworthy by the aid of comparative anatomy to go through the\ngreat creation of organised natures, in order to see whether there may\nnot be in it something similar to a system and also in accordance with\nthe principle of production. For otherwise we should have to be content\nwith the mere principle of judgement (which gives no insight into\ntheir production) and, discouraged, to give up all claim to _natural\ninsight_ in this field. The agreement of so many genera of animals\nin a certain common schema, which appears to be fundamental not only\nin the structure of their bones but also in the disposition of their\nremaining parts,--so that with an admirable simplicity of original\noutline, a great variety of species has been produced by the shortening\nof one member and the lengthening of another, the involution of this\npart and the evolution of that,--allows a ray of hope, however faint,\nto penetrate into our minds, that here something may be accomplished\nby the aid of the principle of the mechanism of nature (without\nwhich there can be no natural science in general). This analogy of\nforms, which with all their differences seem to have been produced\naccording to a common original type, strengthens our suspicions of an\nactual relationship between them in their production from a common\nparent, through the gradual approximation of one animal-genus to\nanother--from those in which the principle of purposes seems to be\nbest authenticated, _i.e._ from man, down to the polype, and again from\nthis down to mosses and lichens, and finally to the lowest stage of\nnature noticeable by us, viz. to crude matter. And so the whole Technic\nof nature, which is so incomprehensible to us in organised beings that\nwe believe ourselves compelled to think a different principle for it,\nseems to be derived from matter and its powers according to mechanical\nlaws (like those by which it works in the formation of crystals).\nHere it is permissible for the _archaeologist_ of nature to derive\nfrom the surviving traces of its oldest revolutions, according to all\nits mechanism known or supposed by him, that great family of creatures\n(for so we must represent them if the said thoroughgoing relationship\nis to have any ground). He can suppose the bosom of mother earth, as\nshe passed out of her chaotic state (like a great animal), to have\ngiven birth in the beginning to creatures of less purposive form, that\nthese again gave birth to others which formed themselves with greater\nadaptation to their place of birth and their relations to each other;\nuntil this womb becoming torpid and ossified, limited its births to\ndefinite species not further modifiable, and the manifoldness remained\nas it was at the end of the operation of that fruitful formative\npower.--Only he must still in the end ascribe to this universal mother\nan organisation purposive in respect of all these creatures; otherwise\nit would not be possible to think the possibility of the purposive form\nof the products of the animal and vegetable kingdoms.[120] He has then\nonly pushed further back the ground of explanation and cannot pretend\nto have made the development of those two kingdoms independent of the\ncondition of final causes.\nEven as concerns the variation to which certain individuals of\norganised genera are accidentally subjected, if we find that the\ncharacter so changed is hereditary and is taken up into the generative\npower, then we cannot pertinently judge the variation to be anything\nelse than an occasional development of purposive capacities originally\npresent in the species with a view to the preservation of the race.\nFor in the complete inner purposiveness of an organised being, the\ngeneration of its like is closely bound up with the condition of taking\nnothing up into the generative power which does not belong, in such\na system of purposes, to one of its undeveloped original capacities.\nIndeed, if we depart from this principle, we cannot know with certainty\nwhether several parts of the form which is now apparent in a species\nhave not a contingent and unpurposive origin; and the principle of\nTeleology, to judge nothing in an organised being as unpurposive\nwhich maintains it in its propagation, would be very unreliable in its\napplication and would be valid solely for the original stock (of which\nwe have no further knowledge).\n_Hume_[121] takes exception to those who find it requisite to\nassume for all such natural purposes a teleological principle of\njudgement, _i.e._ an architectonic Understanding. He says that it may\nfairly be asked: how is such an Understanding possible? How can the\nmanifold faculties and properties that constitute the possibility\nof an Understanding, which has at the same time executive force,\nbe found so purposively together in one Being? But this objection\nis without weight. For the whole difficulty which surrounds the\nquestion concerning the first production of a thing containing in\nitself purposes and only comprehensible by means of them, rests on\nthe further question as to the unity of the ground of the combination\nin this product of the various elements [des Mannichfaltigen] which\nare _external to one another_. For if this ground be placed in the\nUnderstanding of a producing cause as simple substance, the question,\nso far as it is teleological, is sufficiently answered; but if the\ncause be sought merely in matter as an aggregate of many substances\nexternal to one another, the unity of the principle is quite\nwanting for the internally purposive form of its formation, and the\n_autocracy_ of matter in productions which can only be conceived by our\nUnderstanding as purposes is a word without meaning.\nHence it comes to pass that those who seek a supreme ground of\npossibility for the objectively-purposive forms of matter, without\nattributing to it Understanding, either make the world-whole into\na single all-embracing substance (Pantheism), or (which is only a\nmore determinate explanation of the former) into a complex of many\ndeterminations inhering in a single _simple substance_ (Spinozism);\nmerely in order to satisfy that condition of all purposiveness--the\n_unity_ of ground. Thus they do justice indeed to _one_ condition of\nthe problem, viz. the unity in the purposive combination, by means\nof the mere ontological concept of a simple substance; but they\nadduce nothing for the _other_ condition, viz. the relation of this\nsubstance to its result as _purpose_, through which relation that\nontological ground is to be more closely determined in respect of\nthe question at issue. Hence they answer _the whole_ question in no\nway. It remains absolutely unanswerable (for our Reason) if we do\nnot represent that original ground of things, as simple _substance_;\nits property which has reference to the specific constitution of the\nforms of nature grounded thereon, viz. its purposive unity, as the\nproperty of an intelligent substance; and the relation of these forms\nto this intelligence (on account of the contingency which we ascribe\nto everything that we think possible only as a purpose) as that of\n_causality_.\n\u00a7 81. _Of the association of mechanism with the teleological principle\nin the explanation of a natural purpose as a natural product_\nAccording to the preceding paragraphs the mechanism of nature alone\ndoes not enable us to think the possibility of an organised being;\nbut (at least according to the constitution of our cognitive faculty)\nit must be originally subordinated to a cause working designedly.\nBut, just as little is the mere teleological ground of such a being\nsufficient for considering it and judging it as a product of nature,\nif the mechanism of the latter be not associated with the former,\nlike the instrument of a cause working designedly, to whose purposes\nnature is subordinated in its mechanical laws. The possibility of such\na unification of two quite different kinds of causality,--of nature\nin its universal conformity to law with an Idea which limits it to a\nparticular form, for which it contains no ground in itself--is not\ncomprehended by our Reason. It lies in the supersensible substrate\nof nature, of which we can determine nothing positively, except that\nit is the being in itself of which we merely know the phenomenon.\nBut the principle, \u201call that we assume as belonging to this nature\n(_phenomenon_) and as its product, must be thought as connected\ntherewith according to mechanical laws,\u201d has none the less force,\nbecause without this kind of causality organised beings (as purposes of\nnature) would not be natural products.\nNow if the teleological principle of the production of these beings\nbe assumed (as is inevitable), we can place at the basis of the\ncause of their internally purposive form either _Occasionalism_ or\n_Pre-established Harmony_. According to the former the Supreme Cause\nof the world would, conformably to its Idea, furnish immediately the\norganic formation on the occasion of every union of intermingling\nmaterials. According to the latter it would, in the original products\nof its wisdom, only have supplied the capacity by means of which\nan organic being produces another of like kind, and the species\nperpetually maintains itself; whilst the loss of individuals is\ncontinually replaced by that nature which at the same time works\ntowards their destruction. If we assume the Occasionalism of the\nproduction of organised beings, all nature is quite lost, and with\nit all employment of Reason in judging of the possibility of such\nproducts; hence we may suppose that no one will adopt this system, who\nhas anything to do with philosophy.\n[The theory of] _Pre-established Harmony_ may proceed in two different\nways. It regards every organised being as generated by one of like\nkind, either as an _educt_ or a _product_. The system which regards\ngenerations as mere educts is called the theory of _individual\npreformation_ or the theory of _evolution_: that which regards them\nas products is entitled the system of _epigenesis_. This latter may\nalso be entitled the system of _generic preformation_, because the\nproductive faculty of the generator and consequently the specific\nform would be _virtually_ performed according to the inner purposive\ncapacities which are part of its stock. In correspondence with this the\nopposite theory of individual preformations would be better entitled\nthe _theory of involution_.\nThe advocates of the _theory of evolution_, who remove every\nindividual from the formative power of nature, in order to make\nit come immediately from the hand of the Creator, would, however,\nnot venture to regard this as happening according to the hypothesis\nof Occasionalism. For according to this the copulation is a mere\nformality, _\u00e0 propos_ of which a supreme intelligent Cause of the\nworld has concluded to form a fruit immediately by his hand, and only\nto leave to the mother its development and nourishment. They declare\nthemselves for preformation; as if it were not all the same, whether\na supernatural origin is assigned to these forms in the beginning\nor in the course of the world. On the contrary, a great number of\nsupernatural arrangements would be spared by occasional creation,\nwhich would be requisite, in order that the embryo formed in the\nbeginning of the world might not be injured throughout the long period\nof its development by the destructive powers of nature, and might keep\nitself unharmed; and there would also be requisite an incalculably\ngreater number of such preformed beings than would ever be developed,\nand with them many creations would be made without need and without\npurpose. They would, however, be willing to leave at least something\nto nature, so as not to fall into a complete Hyperphysic which can\ndispense with all natural explanations. It is true, they hold so\nfast by their Hyperphysic that they find even in abortions (which\nit is quite impossible to take for purposes of nature) an admirable\npurposiveness; though it be only directed to the fact that an anatomist\nwould take exception to it as a purposeless purposiveness, and would\nfeel a disheartened wonder thereat. But the production of hybrids\ncould absolutely not be accommodated with the system of preformation;\nand to the seeds of the male creature, to which they had attributed\nnothing but the mechanical property of serving as the first means of\nnourishment for the embryo, they must attribute in addition a purposive\nformative power, which in the case of the product of two creatures of\nthe same genus they would concede to neither parent.\nOn the other hand, even if we do not recognise the great superiority\nwhich the theory of _Epigenesis_ has over the former as regards the\nempirical grounds of its proof, still prior to proof Reason views this\nway of explanation with peculiar favour. For in respect of the things\nwhich we can only represent as possible originally according to the\ncausality of purposes, at least as concerns their propagation, this\ntheory regards nature as self-producing, not merely as self-evolving:\nand so with the least expenditure of the supernatural leaves to nature\nall that follows after the first beginning (though without determining\nanything about this first beginning by which Physic generally is\nthwarted, however it may essay its explanation by a chain of causes).\nAs regards this theory of Epigenesis, no one has contributed more\neither to its proof or to the establishment of the legitimate\nprinciples of its application,--partly by the limitation of a too\npresumptuous employment of it,--than Herr Hofr. _Blumenbach_.[122]\nIn all physical explanations of these formations he starts from\norganised matter. That crude matter should have originally formed\nitself according to mechanical laws, that life should have sprung from\nthe nature of what is lifeless, that matter should have been able to\ndispose itself into the form of a self-maintaining purposiveness--this\nhe rightly declares to be contradictory to Reason. But at the same\ntime he leaves to natural mechanism under this to us indispensable\n_principle_ of an original _organisation_, an undeterminable but yet\nunmistakeable element, in reference to which the faculty of matter in\nan organised body is called by him a _formative impulse_ (in contrast\nto, and yet standing under the higher guidance and direction of, that\nmerely mechanical _formative power_ universally resident in matter).\n\u00a7 82. _Of the teleological system in the external relations of\norganised beings_\nBy external purposiveness I mean that by which one thing of nature\nserves another as means to a purpose. Now things which have no internal\npurposiveness and which presuppose none for their possibility, _e.g._\nearth, air, water, etc., may at the same time be very purposive\nexternally, _i.e._ in relation to other beings. But these latter\nmust be organised beings, _i.e._ natural purposes, for otherwise the\nformer could not be judged as means to them. Thus water, air, and\nearth cannot be regarded as means to the raising of mountains, because\nmountains contain nothing in themselves that requires a ground of their\npossibility according to purposes, in reference to which therefore\ntheir cause can never be represented under the predicate of a means (as\nuseful therefor).\nExternal purposiveness is a quite different concept from that of\ninternal purposiveness, which is bound up with the possibility of an\nobject irrespective of its actuality being itself a purpose. We can ask\nabout an organised being the question: What is it for? But we cannot\neasily ask this about things in which we recognise merely the working\nof nature\u2019s mechanism. For in the former, as regards their internal\npossibility, we represent a causality according to purposes, a creative\nUnderstanding, and we refer this active faculty to its determining\nground, viz. design. There is only one external purposiveness which\nis connected with the internal purposiveness of organisation, and yet\nserves in the external relation of a means to a purpose, without the\nquestion necessarily arising, as to what end this being so organised\nmust have existed for. This is the organisation of both sexes in their\nmutual relation for the propagation of their kind; since here we can\nalways ask, as in the case of an individual, why must such a pair\nexist? The answer is: This pair first constitutes an _organising_\nwhole, though not an organised whole in a single body.\nIf we now ask, wherefore anything is, the answer is either: Its\npresence and its production have no reference at all to a cause working\naccording to design, and so we always refer its origin to the mechanism\nof nature, or: There is somewhere a designed ground of its presence\n(as a contingent natural being). This thought we can hardly separate\nfrom the concept of an organised thing; for, since we must place at\nthe basis of its internal possibility a causality of final causes and\nan Idea lying at the ground of this, we cannot think the existence\nof this product except as a purpose. For the represented effect, the\nrepresentation of which is at the same time the determining ground\nof the intelligent cause working towards its production, is called a\n_purpose_. In this case therefore we can either say: The purpose of\nthe existence of such a natural being is in itself; _i.e._ it is not\nmerely a purpose but a _final purpose_, or: This is external to it in\nanother natural being, _i.e._ it exists purposively not as a final\npurpose, but necessarily as a means.\nBut if we go through the whole of nature we find in it, as nature,\nno being which could make claim to the eminence of being the final\npurpose of creation; and we can even prove _a priori_ that what might\nbe for nature an _ultimate purpose_, according to all the thinkable\ndeterminations and properties wherewith one could endow it, could yet\nas a natural thing never be a _final purpose_.\nIf we consider the vegetable kingdom we might at first sight, on\naccount of the immeasurable fertility with which it spreads itself\nalmost on every soil, be led to take it for a mere product of that\nmechanism which nature displays in the formations of the mineral\nkingdom. But a more intimate knowledge of its indescribably wise\norganisation does not permit us to hold to this thought, but prompts\nthe question: What are these things created for? If it is answered:\nFor the animal kingdom, which is thereby nourished and has thus been\nable to spread over the earth in genera so various, then the further\nquestion comes: What are these plant-devouring animals for? The answer\nwould be something like this: For beasts of prey, which can only be\nnourished by that which has life. Finally we have the question: What\nare these last, as well as the first-mentioned natural kingdoms, good\nfor? For man, in reference to the manifold use which his Understanding\nteaches him to make of all these creatures. He is the ultimate purpose\nof creation here on earth, because he is the only being upon it who\ncan form a concept of purposes, and who can by his Reason make out of\nan aggregate of purposively formed things a system of purposes.\nWe might also with the chevalier _Linnaeus_[123] go the apparently\nopposite way and say: The herbivorous animals are there to moderate\nthe luxurious growth of the vegetable kingdom, by which many of its\nspecies are choked. The carnivora are to set bounds to the voracity of\nthe herbivora. Finally man, by his pursuit of these and his diminution\nof their numbers, preserves a certain equilibrium between the producing\nand the destructive powers of nature. And so man, although in a certain\nreference he might be esteemed a purpose, yet in another has only the\nrank of a means.\nIf an objective purposiveness in the variety of the genera of creatures\nand their external relations to one another, as purposively constructed\nbeings, be made a principle, then it is conformable to Reason to\nconceive in these relations a certain organisation and a system of all\nnatural kingdoms according to final causes. Only here experience seems\nflatly to contradict the maxims of Reason, especially as concerns an\nultimate purpose of nature, which is indispensable for the possibility\nof such a system and which we can put nowhere else but in man. For\nregarding him as one of the many animal genera, nature has not in the\nleast excepted him from its destructive or its productive powers, but\nhas subjected everything to a mechanism thereof without any purpose.\nThe first thing that must be designedly prepared in an arrangement\nfor a purposive complex of natural beings on the earth would be their\nplace of habitation, the soil and the element on and in which they\nare to thrive. But a more exact knowledge of the constitution of\nthis basis of all organic production indicates no other causes than\nthose working quite undesignedly, causes which rather destroy than\nfavour production, order, and purposes. Land and sea not only contain\nin themselves memorials of ancient mighty desolations which have\nconfounded them and all creatures that are in them; but their whole\nstructure, the strata of the one and the boundaries of the other, have\nquite the appearance of being the product of the wild and violent\nforces of a nature working in a state of chaos. Although the figure,\nthe structure, and the slope of the land might seem to be purposively\nordered for the reception of water from the air, for the welling\nup of streams between strata of different kinds (for many kinds of\nproducts), and for the course of rivers--yet a closer investigation\nshows that they are merely the effects of volcanic eruptions or of\ninundations of the ocean, as regards not only the first production of\nthis figure, but, above all, its subsequent transformation, as well as\nthe disappearance of its first organic productions.[124] Now if the\nplace of habitation of all these creatures, the soil (of the land)\nor the bosom (of the sea), indicates nothing but a quite undesigned\nmechanism of its production, how and with what right can we demand and\nmaintain a different origin for these latter products? The closest\nexamination, indeed (in _Camper\u2019s_[125] judgement), of the remains\nof the aforesaid devastations of nature seems to show that man was\nnot comprehended in these revolutions; but yet he is so dependent on\nthe remaining creatures that, if a universally directing mechanism of\nnature be admitted in the case of the others, he must also be regarded\nas comprehended under it; even though his Understanding (for the most\npart at least) has been able to deliver him from these devastations.\nBut this argument seems to prove more than was intended by it. It seems\nto prove not merely that man cannot be the ultimate purpose of nature,\nand that on the same grounds the aggregate of the organised things of\nnature on the earth cannot be a system of purposes; but also that the\nnatural products formerly held to be natural purposes have no other\norigin than the mechanism of nature.\nBut in the solution given above of the Antinomy of the principles\nof the mechanical and teleological methods of production of organic\nbeings of nature, we have seen that they are merely principles of\nthe reflective Judgement in respect of nature as it produces forms\nin accordance with particular laws (for the systematic connexion of\nwhich we have no key). They do not determine the origin of these\nbeings in themselves; but only say that we, by the constitution of\nour Understanding and our Reason, cannot conceive it in this kind of\nbeing except according to final causes. The greatest possible effort,\neven audacity, in the attempt to explain them mechanically is not only\npermitted, but we are invited to it by Reason; notwithstanding that\nwe know from the subjective grounds of the particular species and\nlimitations of our Understanding (not _e.g._ because the mechanism\nof production would contradict in itself an origin according to\npurposes) that we can never attain thereto. Finally, the compatibility\nof both ways of representing the possibility of nature may lie in\nthe supersensible principle of nature (external to us, as well as in\nus); whilst the method of representation according to final causes\nmay be only a subjective condition of the use of our Reason, when it\nnot merely wishes to form a judgement upon objects as phenomena, but\ndesires to refer these phenomena together with their principles to\ntheir supersensible substrate, in order to find certain laws of their\nunity possible, which it cannot represent to itself except through\npurposes (of which the Reason also has such as are supersensible).\n\u00a7 83. _Of the ultimate purpose of nature as a teleological system_\nWe have shown in the preceding that, though not for the determinant but\nfor the reflective Judgement, we have sufficient cause for judging man\nto be, not merely like all organised beings a _natural purpose_, but\nalso the _ultimate purpose_ of nature here on earth; in reference to\nwhom all other natural things constitute a system of purposes according\nto fundamental propositions of Reason. If now that must be found in\nman himself, which is to be furthered as a purpose by means of his\nconnexion with nature, this purpose must either be of a kind that\ncan be satisfied by nature in its beneficence; or it is the aptitude\nand skill for all kinds of purposes for which nature (external and\ninternal) can be used by him. The first purpose of nature would be\nman\u2019s _happiness_, the second his _culture_.\nThe concept of happiness is not one that man derives by abstraction\nfrom his instincts and so deduces from his animal nature; but it is a\nmere _Idea_ of a state, that he wishes to make adequate to the Idea\nunder merely empirical conditions (which is impossible). This Idea he\nprojects in such different ways on account of the complication of his\nUnderstanding with Imagination and Sense, and changes so often, that\nnature, even if it were entirely subjected to his elective will, could\nreceive absolutely no determinate, universal and fixed law, so as to\nharmonise with this vacillating concept and thus with the purpose which\neach man arbitrarily sets before himself. And even if we reduce this\nto the true natural wants as to which our race is thoroughly agreed,\nor on the other hand, raise ever so high man\u2019s skill to accomplish his\nimagined purposes; yet, even thus, what man understands by happiness,\nand what is in fact his proper, ultimate, natural purpose (not purpose\nof freedom), would never be attained by him. For it is not his nature\nto rest and be contented with the possession and enjoyment of anything\nwhatever. On the other side, too, there is something wanting. Nature\nhas not taken him for her special darling and favoured him with benefit\nabove all animals. Rather, in her destructive operations,--plague,\nhunger, perils of waters, frost, assaults of other animals great and\nsmall, etc.,--in these things has she spared him as little as any other\nanimal. Further, the inconsistency of his own _natural dispositions_\ndrives him into self-devised torments, and also reduces others of his\nown race to misery, by the oppression of lordship, the barbarism of\nwar, and so forth; he, himself, as far as in him lies, works for the\ndestruction of his own race; so that even with the most beneficent\nexternal nature, its purpose, if it were directed to the happiness\nof our species, would not be attained in an earthly system, because\nour nature is not susceptible of it. Man is then always only a link\nin the chain of natural purposes; a principle certainly in respect\nof many purposes, for which nature seems to have destined him in her\ndisposition, and towards which he sets himself, but also a means for\nthe maintenance of purposiveness in the mechanism of the remaining\nlinks. As the only being on earth which has an Understanding and,\nconsequently, a faculty of setting arbitrary purposes before itself, he\nis certainly entitled to be the lord of nature; and if it be regarded\nas a teleological system he is, by his destination, the ultimate\npurpose of nature. But this is subject to the condition of his having\nan Understanding and the Will to give to it and to himself such a\nreference to purposes, as can be self-sufficient independently of\nnature, and, consequently, can be a final purpose; which, however, must\nnot be sought in nature itself.\nBut in order to find out where in man we have to place that _ultimate\npurpose_ of nature, we must seek out what nature can supply to prepare\nhim for what he must do himself in order to be a final purpose, and\nwe must separate it from all those purposes whose possibility depends\nupon things that one can expect only from nature. Of the latter\nkind is earthly happiness, by which is understood the complex of all\nman\u2019s purposes possible through nature, whether external nature or\nman\u2019s nature; _i.e._ the matter of all his earthly purposes, which,\nif he makes it his whole purpose, renders him incapable of positing\nhis own existence as a final purpose, and being in harmony therewith.\nThere remains therefore of all his purposes in nature only the formal\nsubjective condition; viz. the aptitude of setting purposes in\ngeneral before himself, and (independent of nature in his purposive\ndetermination) of using nature, conformably to the maxims of his free\npurposes in general, as a means. This nature can do in regard to the\nfinal purpose that lies outside it, and it therefore may be regarded\nas its ultimate purpose. The production of the aptitude of a rational\nbeing for arbitrary purposes in general (consequently in his freedom)\nis _culture_. Therefore, culture alone can be the ultimate purpose\nwhich we have cause for ascribing to nature in respect to the human\nrace (not man\u2019s earthly happiness or the fact that he is the chief\ninstrument of instituting order and harmony in irrational nature\nexternal to himself).\nBut all culture is not adequate to this ultimate purpose of nature. The\nculture of _skill_ is indeed the chief subjective condition of aptitude\nfor furthering one\u2019s purposes in general; but it is not adequate to\nfurthering the _will_[126] in the determination and choice of purposes,\nwhich yet essentially belongs to the whole extent of an aptitude for\npurposes. The latter condition of aptitude, which we might call the\nculture of training (discipline), is negative, and consists in the\nfreeing of the will from the despotism of desires. By these, tied as\nwe are to certain natural things, we are rendered incapable even of\nchoosing, while we allow those impulses to serve as fetters, which\nNature has given us as guiding threads that we should not neglect or\nviolate the destination of our animal nature--we being all the time\nfree enough to strain or relax, to extend or diminish them, according\nas the purposes of Reason require.\nSkill cannot be developed in the human race except by means of\ninequality among men; for the great majority provide the necessities\nof life, as it were, mechanically, without requiring any art in\nparticular, for the convenience and leisure of others who work at the\nless necessary elements of culture, science and art. In an oppressed\ncondition they have hard work and little enjoyment, although much of\nthe culture of the higher classes gradually spreads to them. Yet with\nthe progress of this culture (the height of which is called luxury,\nreached when the propensity to what can be done without begins to be\ninjurious to what is indispensable), their calamities increase equally\nin two directions, on the one hand through violence from without, on\nthe other hand through internal discontent; but still this splendid\nmisery is bound up with the development of the natural capacities of\nthe human race, and the purpose of nature itself, although not our\npurpose, is thus attained. The formal condition under which nature\ncan alone attain this its final design, is that arrangement of men\u2019s\nrelations to one another, by which lawful authority in a whole,\nwhich we call a _civil community_, is opposed to the abuse of their\nconflicting freedoms; only in this can the greatest development\nof natural capacities take place. For this also there would be\nrequisite,--if men were clever enough to find it out and wise enough\nto submit themselves voluntarily to its constraint,--a _cosmopolitan_\nwhole, _i.e._ a system of all states that are in danger of acting\ninjuriously upon each other.[127] Failing this, and with the obstacles\nwhich ambition, lust of dominion, and avarice, especially in those\nwho have the authority in their hands, oppose even to the possibility\nof such a scheme, there is, inevitably, _war_ (by which sometimes\nstates subdivide and resolve themselves into smaller states, sometimes\na state annexes other smaller states and strives to form a greater\nwhole). Though war is an undesigned enterprise of men (stirred up by\ntheir unbridled passions), yet is it [perhaps][128] a deep-hidden\nand designed enterprise of supreme wisdom for preparing, if not for\nestablishing, conformity to law amid the freedom of states, and with\nthis a unity of a morally grounded system of those states. In spite of\nthe dreadful afflictions with which it visits the human race, and the\nperhaps greater afflictions with which the constant preparation for it\nin time of peace oppresses them, yet is it (although the hope for a\nrestful state of popular happiness is ever further off) a motive for\ndeveloping all talents serviceable for culture, to the highest possible\npitch.[129]\nAs concerns the discipline of the inclinations,--for which our\nnatural capacity in regard of our destination as an animal race is\nquite purposive, but which render the development of humanity very\ndifficult,--there is manifest in respect of this second requirement for\nculture a purposive striving of nature to a cultivation which makes us\nreceptive of higher purposes than nature itself can supply. We cannot\nstrive against the preponderance of evil, which is poured out upon us\nby the refinement of taste pushed to idealisation, and even by the\nluxury of science as affording food for pride, through the insatiable\nnumber of inclinations thus aroused. But yet we cannot mistake the\npurpose of nature--ever aiming to win us away from the rudeness and\nviolence of those inclinations (inclinations to enjoyment) which belong\nrather to our animality, and for the most part are opposed to the\ncultivation of our higher destiny, and to make way for the development\nof our humanity. The beautiful arts and the sciences which, by their\nuniversally-communicable pleasure, and by the polish and refinement\nof society, make man more civilised, if not morally better, win us in\nlarge measure from the tyranny of sense-propensions, and thus prepare\nmen for a lordship, in which Reason alone shall have authority;\nwhilst the evils with which we are visited, partly by nature, partly\nby the intolerant selfishness of men, summon, strengthen, and harden\nthe powers of the soul not to submit to them, and so make us feel an\naptitude for higher purposes, which lies hidden in us.[130]\n\u00a7 84. _Of the final purpose of the existence of a world, i.e. of\ncreation itself_\nA _final purpose_ is that purpose which needs no other as condition of\nits possibility.\nIf the mere mechanism of nature be assumed as the ground of explanation\nof its purposiveness, we cannot ask: what are things in the world\nthere for? For according to such an idealistic system it is only the\nphysical possibility of things (to think which as purposes would be\nmere subtlety without any Object) that is under discussion; whether we\nrefer this form of things to chance or to blind necessity, in either\ncase the question would be vain. If, however, we assume the purposive\ncombination in the world to be real and to be [brought about] by a\nparticular kind of causality, viz. that of a _designedly-working_\ncause, we cannot stop at the question: why have things of the world\n(organised beings) this or that form? why are they placed by nature\nin this or that relation to one another? But once an Understanding\nis thought that must be regarded as the cause of the possibility of\nsuch forms as are actually found in things, it must be also asked\non objective grounds: Who could have determined this productive\nUnderstanding to an operation of this kind? This being is then the\nfinal purpose in reference to which such things are there.\nI have said above that the final purpose is not a purpose which nature\nwould be competent to bring about and to produce in conformity with\nits Idea, because it is unconditioned. For there is nothing in nature\n(regarded as a sensible being) for which the determining ground present\nin itself would not be always conditioned; and this holds not merely of\nexternal (material) nature, but also of internal (thinking) nature--it\nbeing of course understood that I only am considering that in myself\nwhich is nature. But a thing that is to exist necessarily, on account\nof its objective constitution, as the final purpose of an intelligent\ncause, must be of the kind that in the order of purposes it is\ndependent on no further condition than merely its Idea.\nNow we have in the world only one kind of beings whose causality\nis teleological, _i.e._ is directed to purposes and is at the same\ntime so constituted that the law according to which they have to\ndetermine purposes for themselves is represented as unconditioned and\nindependent of natural conditions, and yet as in itself necessary. The\nbeing of this kind is man, but man considered as noumenon; the only\nnatural being in which we can recognise, on the side of its peculiar\nconstitution, a supersensible faculty (_freedom_) and also the law of\ncausality, together with its Object, which this faculty may propose to\nitself as highest purpose (the highest good in the world).\nNow of man (and so of every rational creature in the World) as a moral\nbeing it can no longer be asked: why (_quem in finem_) he exists? His\nexistence involves the highest purpose to which, as far as is in his\npower, he can subject the whole of nature; contrary to which at least\nhe cannot regard himself as subject to any influence of nature.--If now\nthings of the world, as beings dependent in their existence, need a\nsupreme cause acting according to purposes, man is the final purpose of\ncreation; since without him the chain of mutually subordinated purposes\nwould not be complete as regards its ground. Only in man, and only in\nhim as subject of morality, do we meet with unconditioned legislation\nin respect of purposes, which therefore alone renders him capable of\nbeing a final purpose, to which the whole of nature is teleologically\nsubordinated.[131]\n\u00a7 85. _Of Physico-theology_\n_Physico-theology_ is the endeavour of Reason to infer the Supreme\nCause of nature and its properties from the _purposes_ of nature (which\ncan only be empirically known). _Moral theology_ (ethico-theology)\nwould be the endeavour to infer that Cause and its properties from\nthe moral purpose of rational beings in nature (which can be known _a\npriori_).\nThe former naturally precedes the latter. For if we wish to infer a\nWorld Cause _teleologically_ from the things in the world, purposes\nof nature must first be given, for which we afterwards have to seek\na final purpose, and for this the principle of the causality of this\nSupreme Cause.\nMany investigations of nature can and must be conducted according to\nthe teleological principle, without our having cause to inquire into\nthe ground of the possibility of purposive working with which we meet\nin various products of nature. But if we wish to have a concept of this\nwe have absolutely no further insight into it than the maxim of the\nreflective Judgement affords: viz. if only a single organic product of\nnature were given to us, by the constitution of our cognitive faculty\nwe could think no other ground for it than that of a cause of nature\nitself (whether the whole of nature or only this bit of it) which\ncontains the causality for it through Understanding. This principle of\njudging, though it does not bring us any further in the explanation of\nnatural things and their origin, yet discloses to us an outlook over\nnature, by which perhaps we may be able to determine more closely the\nconcept, otherwise so unfruitful, of an Original Being.\nNow I say that Physico-theology, however far it may be pursued, can\ndisclose to us nothing of a _final purpose_ of creation; for it does\nnot even extend to the question as to this. It can, it is true, justify\nthe concept of an intelligent World Cause, as a subjective concept\n(only available for the constitution of our cognitive faculty) of\nthe possibility of things that we can make intelligible to ourselves\naccording to purposes; but it cannot determine this concept further,\neither in a theoretical or a practical point of view. Its endeavour\ndoes not come up to its design of being the basis of a Theology, but\nit always remains only a physical Teleology; because the purposive\nreference therein is and must be always considered only as conditioned\nin nature, and it consequently cannot inquire into the purpose for\nwhich nature itself exists (for which the ground must be sought outside\nnature),--notwithstanding that it is upon the determinate Idea of this\nthat the determinate concept of that Supreme Intelligent World Cause,\nand the consequent possibility of a Theology, depend.\nWhat the things in the world are mutually useful for; what good the\nmanifold in a thing does for the thing; how we have ground to assume\nthat nothing in the world is in vain, but that everything _in nature_\nis good for something,--the condition being granted that certain things\nare to exist (as purposes), whence our Reason has in its power for\nthe Judgement no other principle of the possibility of the Object,\nwhich it inevitably judges teleologically, than that of subordinating\nthe mechanism of nature to the Architectonic of an intelligent Author\nof the world--all this the teleological consideration of the world\nsupplies us with excellently and to our extreme admiration. But\nbecause the data, and so the principles, for _determining_ that concept\nof an intelligent World Cause (as highest artist) are merely empirical,\nthey do not enable us to infer any of its properties beyond those which\nexperience reveals in its effects. Now experience, since it can never\nembrace collective nature as a system, must often (apparently) happen\nupon this concept (and by mutually conflicting grounds of proof); but\nit can never, even if we had the power of surveying empirically the\nwhole system as far as it concerns mere nature, raise us above nature\nto the purpose of its existence, and so to the determinate concept of\nthat supreme Intelligence.\nIf we lessen the problem with the solution of which Physico-theology\nhas to do, its solution appears easy. If we reduce the concept of a\n_Deity_ to that of an intelligent being thought by us, of which there\nmay be one or more, which possesses many and very great properties,\nbut not all the properties which are requisite for the foundation of a\nnature in harmony with the greatest possible purpose; or if we do not\nscruple in a theory to supply by arbitrary additions what is deficient\nin the grounds of proof, and so, where we have only ground for assuming\n_much_ perfection (and what is \u201cmuch\u201d for us?), consider ourselves\nentitled to presuppose _all possible_ perfection; thus indeed physical\nTeleology may make weighty claims to the distinction of being the basis\nof a Theology. But if we are desired to point out what impels and\nmoreover authorises us to add these supplements, then we shall seek in\nvain for a ground of justification in the principles of the theoretical\nuse of Reason, which is ever desirous in the explanation of an Object\nof experience to ascribe to it no more properties than those for which\nempirical data of possibility are to be found. On closer examination\nwe should see that properly speaking an Idea of a Supreme Being, which\nrests on a quite different use of Reason (the practical use), lies in\nus fundamentally _a priori_, impelling us to supplement, by the concept\nof a Deity, the defective representation, supplied by a physical\nTeleology, of the original ground of the purposes in nature; and we\nshould not falsely imagine that we had worked out this Idea, and with\nit a Theology by means of the theoretical use of Reason in the physical\ncognition of the world--much less that we had proved its reality.\nOne cannot blame the ancients much, if they thought of their gods as\ndiffering much from each other both as regards their faculties and as\nregards their designs and volitions, but yet thought of all of them,\nthe Supreme One not excepted, as always limited after human fashion.\nFor if they considered the arrangement and the course of things in\nnature, they certainly found ground enough for assuming something\nmore than mechanism as its cause, and for conjecturing behind the\nmachinery of this world designs of certain higher causes, which they\ncould not think otherwise than superhuman. But because they met with\ngood and evil, the purposive and the unpurposive, mingled together (at\nleast as far as our insight goes), and could not permit themselves\nto assume nevertheless that wise and benevolent purposes of which\nthey saw no proof lay hidden at bottom, on behalf of the arbitrary\nIdea of a supremely perfect original Author, their judgement upon\nthe supreme World Cause could hardly have been other than it was, so\nlong as they proceeded consistently according to maxims of the mere\ntheoretical use of Reason. Others, who wished to be theologians as\nwell as physicists, thought to find contentment for the Reason by\nproviding for the absolute unity of the principle of natural things\nwhich Reason demands, the Idea of a Being of which as sole Substance\nthe things would be all only inherent determinations. This Substance\nwould not be Cause of the World by means of intelligence, but in it all\nthe intelligences of the beings in the world would be comprised. This\nBeing consequently would produce nothing according to purposes; but in\nit all things, on account of the unity of the subject of which they are\nmere determinations, must necessarily relate themselves purposively to\none another, though without purpose and design. Thus they introduced\nthe Idealism of final causes, by changing the unity (so difficult to\nexplain) of a number of purposively combined substances, from being\nthe unity of causal dependence _on one_ Substance to be the unity of\ninherence _in one_. This system--which in the sequel, considered on the\nside of the inherent world beings, becomes _Pantheism_, and (later) on\nthe side of the Subject subsisting by itself as Original Being, becomes\n_Spinozism_,--does not so much resolve as explain away into nothing the\nquestion of the first ground of the purposiveness of nature; because\nthis latter concept, bereft of all reality, must be taken for a mere\nmisinterpretation of a universal ontological concept of a thing in\ngeneral.\nHence the concept of a Deity, which would be adequate for our\nteleological judging of nature, can never be derived from mere\ntheoretical principles of the use of Reason (on which Physico-theology\nalone is based). For as one alternative we may explain all Teleology\nas a mere deception of the Judgement in its judging of the causal\ncombination of things, and fly to the sole principle of a mere\nmechanism of nature, which merely seems to us, on account of the unity\nof the Substance of whose determinations nature is but the manifold,\nto contain a universal reference to purposes. Or if, instead of this\nIdealism of final causes, we wish to remain attached to the principle\nof the Realism of this particular kind of causality, we may set\nbeneath natural purposes many intelligent original beings or only a\nsingle one. But so far as we have for the basis of this concept [of\nRealism] only empirical principles derived from the actual purposive\ncombination in the world, we cannot on the one hand find any remedy for\nthe discordance that nature presents in many examples in respect of\nunity of purpose; and on the other hand, as to the concept of a single\nintelligent Cause, so far as we are authorised by mere experience, we\ncan never draw it therefrom in a manner sufficiently determined for any\nserviceable Theology whatever (whether theoretical or practical).\nPhysical Teleology impels us, it is true, to seek a Theology; but it\ncannot produce one, however far we may investigate nature by means of\nexperience and, in reference to the purposive combination apparent in\nit, call in Ideas of Reason (which must be theoretical for physical\nproblems). What is the use, one might well complain, of placing at the\nbasis of all these arrangements a great Understanding incommensurable\nby us, and supposing it to govern the world according to design, if\nnature does not and cannot tell us anything of the final design? For\nwithout this we cannot refer all these natural purposes to any common\npoint, nor can we form any teleological principle, sufficient either\nfor cognising the purposes collected in a system, or for forming a\nconcept of the Supreme Understanding, as Cause of such a nature, that\ncould serve as a standard for our Judgement reflecting teleologically\nthereon. I should thus have an _artistic Understanding_ for scattered\npurposes, but no _Wisdom_ for a final purpose, in which final purpose\nnevertheless must be contained the determining ground of the said\nUnderstanding. But in the absence of a final purpose which pure Reason\nalone can supply (because all purposes in the world are empirically\nconditioned, and can contain nothing absolutely good but only what is\ngood for this or that regarded as a contingent design), and which alone\nwould teach me what properties, what degree, and what relation of the\nSupreme Cause to nature I have to think in order to judge of nature as\na teleological system; how and with what right do I dare to extend at\npleasure my very limited concept of that original Understanding (which\nI can base on my limited knowledge of the world), of the Might of that\noriginal Being in actualising its Ideas, and of its Will to do so, and\ncomplete this into the Idea of an Allwise, Infinite Being? If this is\nto be done theoretically, it would presuppose omniscience in me, in\norder to see into the purposes of nature in their whole connexion, and\nin addition the power of conceiving all possible plans, in comparison\nwith which the present plan would be judged on [sufficient] grounds\nas the best. For without this complete knowledge of the effect I can\narrive at no determinate concept of the Supreme Cause, which can only\nbe found in the concept of an Intelligence infinite in every respect,\n_i.e._ the concept of a Deity, and so I can supply no foundation for\nTheology.\nHence, with every possible extension of physical Teleology, according\nto the propositions above laid down we may say: By the constitution\nand the principles of our cognitive faculty we can think of nature, in\nits purposive arrangements which have become known to us, in no other\nway than as the product of an Understanding to which it is subject.\nBut the theoretical investigation of nature can never reveal to us\nwhether this Understanding may not also, with the whole of nature and\nits production, have had a final design (which would not lie in the\nnature of the sensible world). On the contrary, with all our knowledge\nof nature it remains undecided whether that Supreme Cause is its\noriginal ground according to a final purpose, or not rather by means\nof an Understanding determined by the mere necessity of its nature to\nproduce certain forms (according to the analogy of what we call the\nart-instinct in animals); without it being necessary to ascribe to\nit even wisdom, much less the highest wisdom combined with all other\nproperties requisite for the perfection of its product.\nHence Physico-theology is a misunderstood physical Teleology, only\nserviceable as a preparation (propaedeutic) for Theology; and it is\nonly adequate to this design by the aid of a foreign principle on which\nit can rely, and not in itself, as its name would intimate.\n\u00a7 86. _Of Ethico-theology_\nThe commonest Understanding, if it thinks over the presence of things\nin the world, and the existence of the world itself, cannot forbear\nfrom the judgement that all the various creatures, no matter how great\nthe art displayed in their arrangement, and how various their purposive\nmutual connexion,--even the complex of their numerous systems (which\nwe incorrectly call worlds),--would be for nothing, if there were not\nalso men (rational beings in general). Without men the whole creation\nwould be a mere waste, in vain, and without final purpose. But it is\nnot in reference to man\u2019s cognitive faculty (theoretical Reason) that\nthe being of everything else in the world gets its worth; he is not\nthere merely that there may be some one to _contemplate_ the world.\nFor if the contemplation of the world only afforded a representation\nof things without any final purpose, no worth could accrue to its\nbeing from the mere fact that it is known; we must presuppose for it\na final purpose, in reference to which its contemplation itself has\nworth. Again it is not in reference to the feeling of pleasure, or to\nthe sum of pleasures, that we think a final purpose of creation as\ngiven; _i.e._ we do not estimate that absolute worth by well-being or\nby enjoyment (whether bodily or mental), or in a word, by happiness.\nFor the fact that man, if he exists, takes this for his final design,\ngives us no concept as to why in general he should exist, and as to\nwhat worth he has in himself to make his existence pleasant. He must,\ntherefore, be supposed to be the final purpose of creation, in order\nto have a rational ground for holding that nature must harmonise with\nhis happiness, if it is considered as an absolute whole according\nto principles of purposes.--Hence there remains only the faculty of\ndesire; not, however, that which makes man dependent (through sensuous\nimpulses) upon nature, nor that in respect of which the worth of his\nbeing depends upon what he receives and enjoys. But the worth which\nhe alone can give to himself, and which consists in what he does, how\nand according to what principles he acts, and that not as a link in\nnature\u2019s chain but in the _freedom_ of his faculty of desire--_i.e._ a\ngood will--is that whereby alone his being can have an absolute worth,\nand in reference to which the being of the world can have a _final\npurpose_.\nThe commonest judgement of healthy human Reason completely accords\nwith this, that it is only as a moral being that man can be a final\npurpose of creation; if we but direct men\u2019s attention to the question\nand incite them to investigate it. What does it avail, one will say,\nthat this man has so much talent, that he is so active therewith, and\nthat he exerts thereby a useful influence over the community, thus\nhaving a great worth both in relation to his own happy condition and\nto the benefit of others, if he does not possess a good will? He is a\ncontemptible Object considered in respect of his inner self; and if the\ncreation is not to be without any final purpose at all, he, who as man\nbelongs to it, must, in a world under moral laws, inasmuch as he is a\nbad man, forfeit his subjective purpose (happiness). This is the only\ncondition under which his existence can accord with the final purpose.\nIf now we meet with purposive arrangements in the world and, as Reason\ninevitably requires, subordinate the purposes that are only conditioned\nto an unconditioned, supreme, _i.e._ final, purpose; then we easily see\nin the first place that we are thus concerned not with a purpose of\nnature (internal to itself), so far as it exists, but with the purpose\nof its existence along with all its ordinances, and, consequently, with\nthe ultimate _purpose of creation_, and specially with the supreme\ncondition under which can be posited a final purpose (_i.e._ the ground\nwhich determines a supreme Understanding to produce the beings of the\nworld).\nSince now it is only as a moral being that we recognise man as the\npurpose of creation, we have in the first place a ground (at least, the\nchief condition) for regarding the world as a whole connected according\nto purposes, and as a _system_ of final causes. And, more especially,\nas regards the reference (necessary for us by the constitution of our\nReason) of natural purposes to an intelligent World Cause, we have _one\nprinciple_ enabling us to think the nature and properties of this First\nCause as supreme ground in the kingdom of purposes, and to determine\nits concept. This physical Teleology could not do; it could only lead\nto indeterminate concepts thereof, unserviceable alike in theoretical\nand in practical use.\nFrom the principle, thus determined, of the causality of the Original\nBeing we must not think Him merely as Intelligence and as legislative\nfor nature, but also as legislating supremely in a moral kingdom of\npurposes. In reference to the _highest good_, alone possible under\nHis sovereignty, viz. the existence of rational beings under moral\nlaws, we shall think this Original Being as _all-knowing_: thus our\ninmost dispositions (which constitute the proper moral worth of the\nactions of rational beings of the world) will not be hid from Him.\nWe shall think Him as _all-mighty_: thus He will be able to make the\nwhole of nature accord with this highest purpose. We shall think Him\nas _all-good_, and at the same time as _just_: because these two\nproperties (which when united constitute _Wisdom_) are the conditions\nof the causality of a supreme Cause of the world, as highest good,\nunder moral laws. So also all the other transcendental properties,\nsuch as _Eternity_, _Omnipresence_, etc. [for goodness and justice are\nmoral properties[132]], which are presupposed in reference to such a\nfinal purpose, must be thought in Him.--In this way _moral Teleology_\nsupplies the deficiency in _physical Teleology_, and first establishes\na _Theology_; because the latter, if it did not borrow from the former\nwithout being observed, but were to proceed consistently, could only\nfound a _Demonology_, which is incapable of any definite concept.\nBut the principle of the reference of the world to a supreme Cause, as\nDeity, on account of the moral purposive destination of certain beings\nin it, does not accomplish this by completing the physico-teleological\nground of proof and so taking this necessarily as its basis. It is\nsufficient _in itself_ and directs attention to the purposes of\nnature and the investigation of that incomprehensible great art lying\nhidden behind its forms, in order to confirm incidentally by means of\nnatural purposes the Ideas that pure practical Reason furnishes. For\nthe concept of beings of the world under moral laws is a principle\n(_a priori_) according to which man must of necessity judge himself.\nFurther, if there is in general a World Cause acting designedly and\ndirected towards a purpose, this moral relation must be just as\nnecessarily the condition of the possibility of a creation, as that\nin accordance with physical laws (if, that is, this intelligent Cause\nhas also a final purpose). This is regarded _a priori_ by Reason as a\nnecessary fundamental proposition for it in its teleological judging\nof the existence of things. It now only comes to this, whether we have\nsufficient ground for Reason (either speculative or practical) to\nascribe to the supreme Cause, acting in accordance with purposes, a\n_final purpose_. For it may _a priori_ be taken by us as certain that\nthis, by the subjective constitution of our Reason and even of the\nReason of other beings as far as we can think it, can be nothing else\nthan _man under moral laws_: since otherwise the purposes of nature in\nthe physical order could not be known _a priori_, especially as it can\nin no way be seen that nature could not exist without such purposes.\n_Remark_\nSuppose the case of a man at the moment when his mind is disposed to a\nmoral sensation. If surrounded by the beauties of nature, he is in a\nstate of restful, serene enjoyment of his being, he feels a want, viz.\nto be grateful for this to some being or other. Or if another time he\nfinds himself in the same state of mind when pressed by duties that he\ncan and will only adequately discharge by a voluntary sacrifice, he\nagain feels in himself a want, viz. to have thus executed a command\nand obeyed a Supreme Lord. Or, again; if he has in some heedless way\ntransgressed his duty, but without becoming answerable to men, his\nsevere self-reproach will speak to him with the voice of a judge to\nwhom he has to give account. In a word, he needs a moral Intelligence,\nin order to have a Being for the purpose of his existence, which may\nbe, conformably to this purpose, the cause of himself and of the\nworld. It is vain to assign motives behind these feelings, for they\nare immediately connected with the purest moral sentiment, because\n_gratitude_, _obedience_, and _humiliation_ (submission to deserved\nchastisement) are mental dispositions that make for duty; and the mind\nwhich is inclined towards a widening of its moral sentiment here only\nvoluntarily conceives an object that is not in the world in order where\npossible to render its duty before such an one. It is therefore at\nleast possible and grounded too in our moral disposition to represent\na pure moral need of the existence of a Being, by which our morality\ngains strength or even (at least according to our representation) more\nscope, viz. a new object for its exercise. That is, [there is a need]\nto assume a morally-legislating Being outside the world, without any\nreference to theoretical proofs, still less to self-interest, from pure\nmoral grounds free from all foreign influence (and consequently only\nsubjective), on the mere recommendation of a pure practical Reason\nlegislating by itself alone. And although such a mental disposition\nmight seldom occur or might not last long, but be transient and without\npermanent effect, or might even pass away without any meditation on the\nobject represented in such shadowy outline, or without care to bring\nit under clear concepts--there is yet here unmistakably the ground why\nour moral capacity, as a subjective principle, should not be contented\nin its contemplation of the world with its purposiveness by means of\nnatural causes, but should ascribe to it a supreme Cause governing\nnature according to moral principles.--In addition, we feel ourselves\nconstrained by the moral law to strive for a universal highest purpose\nwhich yet we, in common with the rest of nature, are incapable of\nattaining; and it is only so far as we strive for it that we can judge\nourselves to be in harmony with the final purpose of an intelligent\nWorld Cause (if such there be). Thus is found a pure moral ground\nof practical Reason for assuming this Cause (since it can be done\nwithout contradiction), in order that we may no more regard that effort\nof Reason as quite idle, and so run the risk of abandoning it from\nweariness.\nWith all this, so much only is to be said, that though _fear_ first\nproduces _gods_ (demons), it is _Reason_ by means of its moral\nprinciples that can first produce the concept of _God_ (even when, as\ncommonly is the case, one is unskilled in the Teleology of nature,\nor is very doubtful on account of the difficulty of adjusting by\na sufficiently established principle its mutually contradictory\nphenomena). Also, the inner _moral_ purposive destination of man\u2019s\nbeing supplies that in which natural knowledge is deficient, by\ndirecting us to think, for the final purpose of the being of all things\n(for which no other principle than an _ethical_ one is satisfactory to\nReason), the supreme Cause [as endowed] with properties, whereby it is\nable to subject the whole of nature to that single design (for which\nnature is merely the instrument),--_i.e._ to think it as a _Deity_.\n\u00a7 87. _Of the moral proof of the Being of God_\nThere is a _physical Teleology_, which gives sufficient ground of\nproof to our theoretical reflective Judgement to assume the being of\nan intelligent World-Cause. But we find also in ourselves and still\nmore in the concept of a rational being in general endowed with freedom\n(of his causality) a _moral Teleology_. However, as the purposive\nreference, together with its law, is determined _a priori_ in ourselves\nand therefore can be cognised as necessary, this internal conformity\nto law requires no intelligent cause external to us; any more than we\nneed look to a highest Understanding as the source of the purposiveness\n(for every possible exercise of art) that we find in the geometrical\nproperties of figures. But this moral Teleology concerns us as beings\nof the world, and therefore as beings bound up with other things in the\nworld; upon which latter, whether as purposes or as objects in respect\nof which we ourselves are final purpose, the same moral laws require\nus to pass judgement. This moral Teleology, then, has to do with the\nreference of our own causality to purposes and even to a final purpose\nthat we must aim at in the world, as well as with the reciprocal\nreference of the world to that moral purpose, and the external\npossibility of its accomplishment (to which no physical Teleology can\nlead us). Hence the question necessarily arises, whether it compels\nour rational judgement to go beyond the world and seek an intelligent\nsupreme principle for that reference of nature to the moral in us; in\norder to represent nature as purposive even in reference to our inner\nmoral legislation and its possible accomplishment. There is therefore\ncertainly a moral Teleology, which is connected on the one hand with\nthe _nomothetic_ of freedom and on the other with that of nature; just\nas necessarily as civil legislation is connected with the question\nwhere the executive authority is to be sought, and in general in every\ncase [with the question] wherein Reason is to furnish a principle\nof the actuality of a certain regular order of things only possible\naccording to Ideas.-- We shall first set forth the progress of Reason\nfrom that moral Teleology and its reference to physical, to _Theology_;\nand then make some observations upon the possibility and the validity\nof this way of reasoning.\nIf we assume the being of certain things (or even only certain forms of\nthings) to be contingent and so to be possible only through something\nelse which is their cause, we may seek for the unconditioned ground of\nthis causality of the supreme (and so of the conditioned) either in\nthe physical or the teleological order (either according to the _nexus\neffectivus_ or the _nexus finalis_). That is, we may either ask, what\nis the supreme productive cause of these things; or what is their\nsupreme (absolutely unconditioned) purpose, _i.e._ the final purpose of\nthat cause in its production of this or all its products generally? In\nthe second case it is plainly presupposed that this cause is capable\nof representing purposes to itself, and consequently is an intelligent\nBeing; at least it must be thought as acting in accordance with the\nlaws of such a being.\nIf we follow the latter order, it is a FUNDAMENTAL PROPOSITION to\nwhich even the commonest human Reason is compelled to give immediate\nassent, that if there is to be in general a _final purpose_ furnished\n_a priori_ by Reason, this can be no other than _man_ (every rational\nbeing of the world) _under moral laws_.[133] For (and so every one\njudges) if the world consisted of mere lifeless, or even in part of\nliving but irrational, beings, its existence would have no worth\nbecause in it there would be no being who would have the least concept\nof what worth is. Again, if there were intelligent beings, whose\nReason were only able to place the worth of the existence of things\nin the relation of nature to themselves (their well-being), but not\nto furnish of itself an original worth (in freedom), then there would\ncertainly be (relative) purposes in the world, but no (absolute) final\npurpose, because the existence of such rational beings would be always\npurposeless. But the moral laws have this peculiar characteristic that\nthey prescribe to Reason something as a purpose without any condition,\nand consequently exactly as the concept of a final purpose requires.\nThe existence of a Reason that can be for itself the supreme law in the\npurposive reference, in other words the existence of rational beings\nunder moral laws, can therefore alone be thought as the final purpose\nof the being of a world. If on the contrary this be not so, there would\nbe either no purpose at all in the cause of its being, or there would\nbe purposes, but no final purpose.\nThe moral law as the formal rational condition of the use of our\nfreedom obliges us by itself alone, without depending on any purpose as\nmaterial condition; but it nevertheless determines for us, and indeed\n_a priori_, a final purpose towards which it obliges us to strive;\nand this purpose is the _highest good in the world_ possible through\nfreedom.\nThe subjective condition under which man (and, according to all our\nconcepts, every rational finite being) can set a final purpose before\nhimself under the above law is happiness. Consequently, the highest\nphysical good possible in the world, to be furthered as a final purpose\nas far as in us lies, is _happiness_, under the objective condition of\nthe harmony of man with the law of _morality_ as worthiness to be happy.\nBut it is impossible for us in accordance with all our rational\nfaculties to represent these two requirements of the final purpose\nproposed to us by the moral law, as _connected_ by merely natural\ncauses, and yet as conformable to the Idea of that final purpose. Hence\nthe concept of the _practical necessity_ of such a purpose through\nthe application of our powers does not harmonise with the theoretical\nconcept of the _physical possibility_ of working it out, if we connect\nwith our freedom no other causality (as a means) than that of nature.\nConsequently, we must assume a moral World-Cause (an Author of the\nworld), in order to set before ourselves a final purpose consistently\nwith the moral law; and in so far as the latter is necessary, so far\n(_i.e._ in the same degree and on the same ground) the former also must\nbe necessarily assumed; _i.e._ we must admit that there is a God.[134]\nThis proof, to which we can easily give the form of logical precision,\ndoes not say: it is as necessary to assume the Being of God as to\nrecognise the validity of the moral law; and consequently he who\ncannot convince himself of the first, can judge himself free from the\nobligations of the second. No! there must in such case only be given\nup the _aiming at_ the final purpose in the world, to be brought about\nby the pursuit of the second (viz. a happiness of rational beings\nin harmony with the pursuit of moral laws, regarded as the highest\ngood). Every rational being would yet have to cognise himself as\nstraitly bound by the precepts of morality, for its laws are formal\nand command unconditionally without respect to purposes (as the matter\nof volition). But the one requisite of the final purpose, as practical\nReason prescribes it to beings of the world, is an irresistible purpose\nimposed on them by their nature (as finite beings), which Reason wishes\nto know as subject only to the moral law as inviolable _condition_, or\neven as universally set up in accordance with it. Thus Reason takes for\nfinal purpose the furthering of happiness in harmony with morality. To\nfurther this so far as is in our power (_i.e._ in respect of happiness)\nis commanded us by the moral law; be the issue of this endeavour what\nit may. The fulfilling of duty consists in the form of the earnest\nwill, not in the intermediate causes of success.\nSuppose then that partly through the weakness of all the speculative\narguments so highly extolled, and partly through many irregularities\nin nature and the world of sense which come before him, a man is\npersuaded of the proposition, There is no God; he would nevertheless be\ncontemptible in his own eyes if on that account he were to imagine the\nlaws of duty as empty, invalid and inobligatory, and wished to resolve\nto transgress them boldly. Such an one, even if he could be convinced\nin the sequel of that which he had doubted at the first, would always\nbe contemptible while having such a disposition, although he should\nfulfil his duty as regards its [external] effect as punctiliously\nas could be desired, for [he would be acting] from fear or from the\naim at recompense, without the sentiment of reverence for duty. If,\nconversely, as a believer [in God] he performs his duty according\nto his conscience, uprightly and disinterestedly, and nevertheless\nbelieves that he is free from all moral obligation so soon as he is\nconvinced that there is no God, this could accord but badly with an\ninner moral disposition.\nWe may then suppose the case of a righteous man [_e.g. Spinoza_],[135]\nwho holds himself firmly persuaded that there is no God, and also\n(because in respect of the Object of morality a similar consequence\nresults) no future life; how is he to judge of his own inner purposive\ndestination, by means of the moral law, which he reveres in practice?\nHe desires no advantage to himself from following it, either in this\nor another world; he wishes, rather, disinterestedly to establish\nthe good to which that holy law directs all his powers. But his\neffort is bounded; and from nature, although he may expect here and\nthere a contingent accordance, he can never expect a regular harmony\nagreeing according to constant rules (such as his maxims are and must\nbe, internally), with the purpose that he yet feels himself obliged\nand impelled to accomplish. Deceit, violence, and envy will always\nsurround him, although he himself be honest, peaceable, and kindly; and\nthe righteous men with whom he meets will, notwithstanding all their\nworthiness of happiness, be yet subjected by nature which regards not\nthis, to all the evils of want, disease, and untimely death, just like\nthe beasts of the earth. So it will be until one wide grave engulfs\nthem together (honest or not, it makes no difference), and throws\nthem back--who were able to believe themselves the final purpose of\ncreation--into the abyss of the purposeless chaos of matter from which\nthey were drawn.-- The purpose, then, which this well-intentioned\nperson had and ought to have before him in his pursuit of moral laws,\nhe must certainly give up as impossible. Or else, if he wishes to\nremain dependent upon the call of his moral internal destination,\nand not to weaken the respect with which the moral law immediately\ninspires him, by assuming the nothingness of the single, ideal, final\npurpose adequate to its high demand (which cannot be brought about\nwithout a violation of moral sentiment), he must, as he well can--since\nthere is at least no contradiction from a practical point of view in\nforming a concept of the possibility of a morally prescribed final\npurpose--assume the being of a _moral_ author of the world, that is, a\nGod.\n\u00a7 88. _Limitation of the validity of the moral proof_\nPure Reason, as a practical faculty, _i.e._ as the faculty of\ndetermining the free use of our causality by Ideas (pure rational\nconcepts), not only comprises in the moral law a regulative principle\nof our actions, but supplies us at the same time with a subjective\nconstitutive principle in the concept of an Object which Reason\nalone can think, and which is to be actualised by our actions in\nthe world according to that law. The Idea of a final purpose in the\nemployment of freedom according to moral laws has therefore subjective\n_practical_ reality. We are _a priori_ determined by Reason to promote\nwith all our powers the _summum bonum_ [Weltbeste] which consists in\nthe combination of the greatest welfare of rational beings with the\nhighest condition of the good in itself, _i.e._ in universal happiness\nconjoined with morality most accordant to law. In this final purpose\nthe possibility of one part, happiness, is empirically conditioned,\n_i.e._ dependent on the constitution of nature (which may or may not\nagree with this purpose) and is in a theoretical aspect problematical;\nwhilst the other part, morality, in respect of which we are free from\nthe effects of nature, stands fast _a priori_ as to its possibility,\nand is dogmatically certain. It is then requisite for the objective\ntheoretical reality of the concept of the final purpose of rational\nbeings, that we should not only have _a priori_ presupposed a final\npurpose for ourselves, but also that the creation, _i.e._ the world\nitself, should have as regards its existence a final purpose, which if\nit could be proved _a priori_ would add objectivity to the subjective\nreality of the final purpose [of rational beings]. For if the creation\nhas on the whole a final purpose, we cannot think it otherwise than as\nharmonising with the moral purpose (which alone makes the concept of a\npurpose possible). Now we find without doubt purposes in the world, and\nphysical Teleology exhibits them in such abundance, that if we judge\nin accordance with Reason, we have ground for assuming as a principle\nin the investigation of nature that nothing in nature is without a\npurpose; but the final purpose of nature we seek there in vain. This\ncan and must therefore, as its Idea only lies in Reason, be sought as\nregards its objective possibility only in rational beings. And the\npractical Reason of these latter not only supplies this final purpose;\nit also determines this concept in respect of the conditions under\nwhich alone a final purpose of creation can be thought by us.\nThe question is now, whether the objective reality of the concept\nof a final purpose of creation cannot be exhibited adequately to the\ntheoretical requirements of pure Reason--if not apodictically for the\ndeterminant Judgement yet adequately for the maxims of the theoretical\nreflective Judgement? This is the least one could expect from\ntheoretical philosophy, which undertakes to combine the moral purpose\nwith natural purposes by means of the Idea of one single purpose; but\nyet this little is far more than it can accomplish.\nAccording to the principle of the theoretical reflective Judgement we\nshould say: if we have ground for assuming for the purposive products\nof nature a supreme Cause of nature--whose causality in respect of the\nactuality of creation is of a different kind from that required for\nthe mechanism of nature, _i.e._ must be thought as the causality of\nan Understanding--we have also sufficient ground for thinking in this\noriginal Being not merely the purposes everywhere in nature but also\na final purpose. This is not indeed a final purpose by which we can\nexplain the presence of such a Being, but one of which we may at least\nconvince ourselves (as was the case in physical Teleology) that we can\nmake the possibility of such a world conceivable, not merely according\nto purposes, but only through the fact that we ascribe to its existence\na final purpose.\nBut a final purpose is merely a concept of our practical Reason,\nand can be inferred from no data of experience for the theoretical\njudging of nature, nor can it be applied to the cognition of nature.\nNo use of this concept is possible except its use for practical Reason\naccording to moral laws; and the final purpose of creation is that\nconstitution of the world which harmonises with that which alone we\ncan put forward definitely according to laws, viz. the final purpose of\nour pure practical Reason, in so far as it is to be practical.-- Now\nwe have in the moral law, which enjoins on us in a practical point of\nview the application of our powers to the accomplishment of this final\npurpose, a ground for assuming its possibility and practicability, and\nconsequently too (because without the concurrence of nature with a\ncondition not in our power, its accomplishment would be impossible) a\nnature of things harmonious with it. Hence we have a moral ground for\nthinking in a world also a final purpose of creation.\nWe have not yet advanced from moral Teleology to a Theology, _i.e._ to\nthe being of a moral Author of the world, but only to a final purpose\nof creation which is determined in this way. But in order to account\nfor this creation, _i.e._ the existence of things, in accordance with\na _final purpose_, we must assume not only first an intelligent Being\n(for the possibility of things of nature which we are compelled to\njudge of as _purposes_), but also a _moral_ Being, as author of the\nworld, _i.e._ a _God_. This second conclusion is of such a character\nthat we see it holds merely for the Judgement according to concepts\nof practical Reason, and as such for the reflective and not the\ndeterminant Judgement. It is true that in us morally practical Reason\nis essentially different in its principles from technically practical\nReason. But we cannot assume that it must be so likewise in the supreme\nWorld-Cause, regarded as Intelligence, and that a peculiar mode of\nits causality is requisite for the final purpose, different from that\nwhich is requisite merely for purposes of nature. We cannot therefore\nassume that in our final purpose we have not merely a _moral ground_\nfor admitting a final purpose of creation (as an effect), but also\nfor admitting a _moral Being_ as the original ground of creation. But\nwe may well say, that, _according to the constitution of our rational\nfaculty_, we cannot comprehend the possibility of such a purposiveness\n_in respect of the moral law_, and its Object, as there is in this\nfinal purpose, apart from an Author and Governor of the world, who is\nat the same time its moral Lawgiver.\nThe actuality of a highest morally-legislating Author is therefore\nsufficiently established merely _for the practical use_ of our Reason,\nwithout determining anything theoretically as regards its being. For\nReason requires, in respect of the possibility of its purpose, which\nis given to us independently by its own legislation, an Idea through\nwhich the inability to follow up this purpose, according to the mere\nnatural concepts of the world, is removed (sufficiently for the\nreflective Judgement). Thus this Idea gains practical reality, although\nall means of creating such for it in a theoretical point of view, for\nthe explanation of nature and determination of the supreme Cause,\nare entirely wanting for speculative cognition. For the theoretical\nreflective Judgement physical Teleology sufficiently proves from the\npurposes of nature an intelligent World-Cause; for the practical\nJudgement moral Teleology establishes it by the concept of a final\npurpose, which it is forced to ascribe to creation in a practical\npoint of view. The objective reality of the Idea of God, as moral\nAuthor of the world, cannot, it is true, be established by physical\npurposes _alone_. But nevertheless, if the cognition of these purposes\nis combined with that of the moral purpose, they are, by virtue of the\nmaxim of pure Reason which bids us seek unity of principles so far as\nis possible, of great importance for the practical reality of that\nIdea, by bringing in the reality which it has for the Judgement in a\ntheoretical point of view.\nTo prevent a misunderstanding which may easily arise, it is in the\nhighest degree needful to remark that, in the first place, we can\n_think_ these properties of the highest Being only according to\nanalogy. How indeed could we explore the nature of that, to which\nexperience can show us nothing similar? Secondly, in this way we only\nthink the supreme Being; we cannot thereby _cognise_ Him and ascribe\nanything theoretically to Him. It would be needful for the determinant\nJudgement in the speculative aspect of our Reason, to consider what\nthe supreme World-Cause is in Himself. But here we are only concerned\nwith the question what concept we can form of Him, according to the\nconstitution of our cognitive faculties; and whether we have to assume\nHis existence in order merely to furnish practical reality to a\npurpose, which pure Reason without any such presupposition enjoins upon\nus _a priori_ to bring about with all our powers, _i.e._ in order to\nbe able to think as possible a designed effect. Although that concept\nmay be transcendent for the speculative Reason, and the properties\nwhich we ascribe to the Being thereby thought may, objectively used,\nconceal an anthropomorphism in themselves; yet the design of its use\nis not to determine the nature of that Being which is unattainable by\nus, but to determine ourselves and our will accordingly. We may call\na cause after the concept which we have of its effect (though only\nin reference to this relation), without thereby meaning to determine\ninternally its inner constitution, by means of the properties which\ncan be made known to us solely by similar causes and must be given in\nexperience. For example, amongst other properties we ascribe to the\nsoul a _vis locomotiva_ because bodily movements actually arise whose\ncause lies in the representation of them; without therefore meaning\nto ascribe to it the only mode [of action] that we know in moving\nforces (viz. by attraction, pressure, impulse, and consequently motion,\nwhich always presuppose an extended being). Just so we must assume\n_something_, which contains the ground of the possibility and practical\nreality, _i.e._ the practicability, of a necessary moral final purpose;\nbut we can think of this, in accordance with the character of the\neffect expected of it, as a wise Being governing the world according\nto moral laws, and, conformably to the constitution of our cognitive\nfaculties, as a cause of things distinct from nature, only in order\nto express the _relation_ of this Being (which transcends all our\ncognitive faculties) to the Objects of _our_ practical Reason. We do\nnot pretend thus to ascribe to it theoretically the only causality of\nthis kind known to us, viz. an Understanding and a Will: we do not\neven pretend to distinguish objectively the causality thought in this\nBeing, as regards what is _for us_ final purpose, from the causality\nthought in it as regards nature (and its purposive determinations in\ngeneral). We can only assume this distinction as subjectively necessary\nby the constitution of our cognitive faculties, and as valid for the\nreflective, not for the objectively determinant Judgement. But if we\ncome to practice, then such a _regulative_ principle (of prudence or\nwisdom) [commanding us] to act conformably to that as purpose, which\nby the constitution of our cognitive faculties can only be thought\nas possible in a certain way, is at the same _constitutive_, _i.e._\npractically determinant. Nevertheless, as a principle for judging\nof the objective possibility of things, it is no way theoretically\ndeterminant (_i.e._ it does not say that the only kind of possibility\nwhich belongs to the Object is that which belongs to our thinking\nfaculty), but is a mere _regulative_ principle for the reflective\nJudgement.\n_Remark_\nThis moral proof is not one newly discovered, although perhaps its\nbasis is newly set forth; since it has lain in man\u2019s rational faculty\nfrom its earliest germ, and is only continually developed with its\nadvancing cultivation. So soon as men begin to reflect upon right and\nwrong--at a time when, quite indifferent as to the purposiveness of\nnature, they avail themselves of it without thinking anything more of\nit than that it is the accustomed course of nature--this judgement is\ninevitable, viz. that the issue cannot be the same, whether a man has\nbehaved candidly or falsely, fairly or violently, even though up to his\nlife\u2019s end, as far as can be seen, he has met with no happiness for\nhis virtues, no punishment for his vices. It is as if they perceived a\nvoice within [saying] that the issue must be different. And so there\nmust lie hidden in them a representation, however obscure, of something\nafter which they feel themselves bound to strive; with which such a\nresult would not agree,--with which, if they looked upon the course of\nthe world as the only order of things, they could not harmonise that\ninner purposive determination of their minds. Now they might represent\nin various rude fashions the way in which such an irregularity could\nbe adjusted (an irregularity which must be far more revolting to the\nhuman mind than the blind chance that we are sometimes willing to use\nas a principle for judging of nature). But they could never think\nany other principle of the possibility of the unification of nature\nwith its inner ethical laws, than a supreme Cause governing the world\naccording to moral laws; because a final purpose in them proposed as\nduty, and a nature without any final purpose beyond them in which that\npurpose might be actualised, would involve a contradiction. As to the\n[inner][136] constitution of that World-Cause they could contrive much\nnonsense. But that moral relation in the government of the world would\nremain always the same, which by the uncultivated Reason, considered\nas practical, is universally comprehensible, but with which the\nspeculative Reason can make far from the like advance.--And in all\nprobability attention would be directed first by this moral interest to\nthe beauty and the purposes in nature, which would serve excellently\nto strengthen this Idea though they could not be the foundation of it.\nStill less could that moral interest be dispensed with, because it is\nonly in reference to the final purpose that the investigation of the\npurposes of nature acquires that immediate interest which displays\nitself in such a great degree in the admiration of them without any\nreference to the advantage to be derived from them.\n\u00a7 89. _Of the use of the moral argument_\nThe limitation of Reason in respect of all our Ideas of the\nsupersensible to the conditions of its practical employment has, as\nfar as the Idea of God is concerned, undeniable uses. For it prevents\n_Theology_ from rising into THEOSOPHY (into transcendent concepts which\nconfound Reason), or from sinking into DEMONOLOGY (an anthropomorphic\nway of representing the highest Being). And it also prevents _Religion_\nfrom turning into _Theurgy_ (a fanatical belief that we can have a\nfeeling of other supersensible beings and can reciprocally influence\nthem), or into _Idolatry_ (a superstitious belief that we can please\nthe Supreme Being by other means than by a moral sentiment).[137]\nFor if we permit the vanity or the presumption of sophistry to\ndetermine the least thing theoretically (in a way that extends our\nknowledge) in respect of what lies beyond the world of sense, or\nif we allow any pretence to be made of insight into the being and\nconstitution of the nature of God, of His Understanding and Will, of\nthe laws of both and of His properties which thus affect the world,\nI should like to know where and at what point we will bound these\nassumptions of Reason. For wherever such insight can be derived, there\nmay yet more be expected (if we only strain our reflection, as we have\na mind to do). Bounds must then be put to such claims according to a\ncertain principle, and not merely because we find that all attempts\nof the sort have hitherto failed, for that proves nothing against the\npossibility of a better result. But here no principle is possible,\nexcept either to assume that in respect of the supersensible absolutely\nnothing can be theoretically determined (except mere negations);\nor else that our Reason contains in itself a yet unused mine of\ncognitions, reaching no one knows how far, stored up for ourselves and\nour posterity.--But as concerns Religion, _i.e._ morals in reference\nto God as legislator, if the theoretical cognition of Him is to come\nfirst, morals must be adjusted in accordance with Theology; and not\nonly is an external arbitrary legislation of a Supreme Being introduced\nin place of an internal necessary legislation of Reason, but also\nwhatever is defective in our insight into the nature of this Being\nmust extend to ethical precepts, and thus make Religion immoral and\nperverted.\nAs regards the hope of a future life, if instead of the final purpose\nwe have to accomplish in conformity with the precept of the moral law,\nwe ask of our theoretical faculty of cognition a clue for the judgement\nof Reason upon our destination (which clue is only considered as\nnecessary or worthy of acceptance in a practical reference), then in\nthis aspect Psychology, like Theology, gives no more than a negative\nconcept of our thinking being. That is, none of its actions or of the\nphenomena of the internal sense can be explained materialistically; and\nhence of its separate nature and of the continuance or non-continuance\nof its personality after death absolutely no ampliative determinant\njudgement is possible on speculative grounds by means of our whole\ntheoretical cognitive faculty. Here then everything is handed over to\nthe teleological judging of our existence in a practically necessary\naspect, and to the assumption of our continuance as a condition\nrequisite for the final purpose absolutely furnished by Reason. And so\nthis advantage (which indeed at first glance seems to be a loss) is\napparent; that, as Theology for us can never be Theosophy, or rational\n_Psychology_ become _Pneumatology_--an ampliative science--so on the\nother hand this latter is assured of never falling into _Materialism_.\nPsychology, rather, is a mere anthropology of the internal sense,\n_i.e._ is the knowledge of our thinking self _in life_; and, as\ntheoretical cognition, remains merely empirical. On the other hand,\nrational Psychology, as far as it is concerned with questions as to\nour eternal existence, is not a theoretical science at all, but rests\non a single conclusion of moral Teleology; as also its whole use is\nnecessary merely on account of the latter, _i.e._ on account of our\npractical destination.\n\u00a7 90. _Of the kind of belief in a teleological proof of the Being of\nGod_\nThe first requisite for every proof, whether it be derived from the\nimmediate empirical presentation (as in the proof from observation of\nthe object or from experiment) of that which is to be proved, or by\nReason _a priori_ from principles, is this. It should not _persuade_,\nbut _convince_,[138] or at least should tend to conviction. _I.e._ the\nground of proof or the conclusion should not be merely a subjective\n(aesthetical) determining ground of assent (mere illusion), but\nobjectively valid and a logical ground of cognition; for otherwise\nthe Understanding is ensnared, but not convinced. Such an illusory\nproof is that which, perhaps with good intent but yet with wilful\nconcealment of its weaknesses, is adduced in Natural Theology. In this\nwe bring in the great number of indications of the origin of natural\nthings according to the principle of purposes, and take advantage\nof the merely subjective basis of human Reason, viz. its special\npropensity to think only one principle instead of several, whenever\nthis can be done without contradiction; and, when in this principle\nonly one or more requisites for determining a concept are furnished, to\nadd in our thought these additional [features] so as to complete the\nconcept of the thing by arbitrarily supplementing it. For, in truth,\nwhen we meet with so many products in nature which are to us marks of\nan intelligent cause, why should we not think One cause rather than\nmany; and in this One, not merely great intelligence, power, etc.,\nbut rather Omniscience, and Omnipotence--in a word, think it as a\nCause that contains the sufficient ground of such properties in all\npossible things? Further, why should we not ascribe to this unique,\nall-powerful, original Being not only intelligence for natural laws\nand products, but also, as to a moral Cause of the world, supreme,\nethical, practical Reason? For by this completion of the concept a\nsufficient principle is furnished both for insight into nature and\nfor moral wisdom; and no objection grounded in any way can be made\nagainst the possibility of such an Idea. If now at the same time\nthe moral motives of the mind are aroused, and a lively interest in\nthe latter is added by the force of eloquence (of which they are\nindeed very worthy), then there arises therefrom a persuasion of the\nobjective adequacy of the proof; and also (in most cases of its use)\na wholesome illusion which quite dispenses with all examination of\nits logical strictness, and even on the contrary regards this with\nabhorrence and dislike as if an impious doubt lay at its basis.--Now\nagainst this there is indeed nothing to say, so long as we only have\nregard to its popular usefulness. But then the division of the proof\ninto the two dissimilar parts involved in the argument--belonging to\nphysical and moral Teleology respectively--cannot and must not be\nprevented. For the blending of these makes it impossible to discern\nwhere the proper force of the proof lies, and in what part and how it\nmust be elaborated in order that its validity may be able to stand the\nstrictest examination (even if we should be compelled to admit in one\npart the weakness of our rational insight). Thus it is the duty of\nthe philosopher (supposing even that he counts as nothing the claims\nof sincerity) to expose the above illusion, however wholesome it is,\nwhich such a confusion can produce; and to distinguish what merely\nbelongs to persuasion from that which leads to conviction (for these\nare determinations of assent which differ not merely in degree but in\nkind), in order to present plainly the state of the mind in this proof\nin its whole clearness, and to be able to subject it frankly to the\nclosest examination.\nBut a proof which is intended to convince, can again be of two kinds;\neither deciding what the object is _in itself_, or what it is _for us_\n(for men in general) according to our necessary rational principles of\njudgement (proof \u03ba\u03b1\u03c4\u2019 \u1f00\u03bb\u03ae\u03b8\u03b5\u03b9\u03b1\u03bd or \u03ba\u03b1\u03c4\u2019 \u1f04\u03bd\u03b8\u03c1\u03c9\u03c0\u03bf\u03bd, the last word being\ntaken in its universal signification of man in general). In the first\ncase it is based on adequate principles for the determinant Judgement,\nin the second for the reflective Judgement. In the latter case it\ncan never, when resting on merely theoretical principles, tend to\nconviction; but if a practical principle of Reason (which is therefore\nuniversally and necessarily valid) lies at its basis, it may certainly\nlay claim to conviction adequate in a pure practical point of view,\n_i.e._ to moral conviction. But a proof _tends to conviction_, though\nwithout convincing, if it is [merely][139] brought on the way thereto;\n_i.e._ if it contains in itself only objective grounds, which although\nnot attaining to certainty are yet of such a kind that they do not\nserve merely for persuasion as subjective grounds of the judgement.[140]\nAll theoretical grounds of proof resolve themselves either into: (1)\nProofs by logically strict _Syllogisms of Reason_; or where this is not\nthe case, (2) _Conclusions_ according to _analogy_; or where this also\nhas no place, (3) _Probable opinion_; or finally, which has the least\nweight, (4) Assumption of a merely possible ground of explanation,\n_i.e._ _Hypothesis_.--Now I say that all grounds of proof in general,\nwhich aim at theoretical conviction, can bring about no belief of this\nkind from the highest to the lowest degree, if there is to be proved\nthe proposition of the _existence_ of an original Being, as a God, in\nthe signification adequate to the whole content of this concept; viz. a\n_moral_ Author of the world, by whom the final purpose of creation is\nat the same time supplied.\n(1.) As to the _logically accurate_ proof proceeding from universal\nto particular, we have sufficiently established in the Critique\nthe following: Since no intuition possible for us corresponds to\nthe concept of a Being that is to be sought beyond nature--whose\nconcept therefore, so far as it is to be theoretically determined by\nsynthetical predicates, remains always problematical for us--there\nis absolutely no cognition of it to be had (by which the extent of\nour theoretical knowledge is in the least enlarged). The particular\nconcept of a supersensible Being cannot be subsumed under the universal\nprinciples of the nature of things, in order to conclude from them to\nit, because those principles are valid simply for nature, as an object\nof sense.\n(2.) We can indeed _think_ one of two dissimilar things, even in\nthe very point of their dissimilarity, in accordance with the\n_analogy_[141] of the other; but we cannot, from that wherein they are\ndissimilar, _conclude_ from the one to the other by analogy, _i.e._\ntransfer from the one to the other this sign of specific distinction.\nThus I can, according to the analogy of the law of the equality of\naction and reaction in the mutual attraction and repulsion of bodies,\nalso conceive of the association of the members of a commonwealth\naccording to rules of right; but I cannot transfer to it those specific\ndeterminations (material attraction or repulsion), and ascribe them\nto the citizens in order to constitute a system called a state.--Just\nso we can indeed conceive of the causality of the original Being in\nrespect of the things of the world, as natural purposes, according to\nthe analogy of an Understanding, as ground of the forms of certain\nproducts which we call works of art (for this only takes place on\nbehalf of the theoretical or practical use that we have to make by our\ncognitive faculty of this concept in respect of the natural things\nin the world according to a certain principle). But we can in no way\nconclude according to analogy, because in the case of beings of the\nworld Understanding must be ascribed to the cause of an effect which\nis judged artificial, that in respect of nature the same causality\nwhich we perceive in men attaches also to the Being which is quite\ndistinct from nature. For this concerns the very point of dissimilarity\nwhich is thought between a cause sensibly conditioned in respect of its\neffects and the supersensible original Being itself in our concept of\nit, and which therefore cannot be transferred from one to the other.--\nIn the very fact that I must conceive the divine causality only\naccording to the analogy of an Understanding (which faculty we know in\nno other being than in sensibly-conditioned man) lies the prohibition\nto ascribe to it this Understanding in its peculiar signification.[142]\n(3.) _Opinion_ finds in _a priori_ judgements no place whatever, for\nby them we either cognise something as quite certain or else cognise\nnothing at all. But if the given grounds of proof from which we start\n(as here from the purposes in the world) are empirical, then we cannot\neven with their aid form any opinion as to anything beyond the world of\nsense, nor can we concede to such venturesome judgements the smallest\nclaim to probability. For probability is part of a certainty possible\nin a certain series of grounds (its grounds compare with the sufficient\nground as parts with a whole), the insufficient ground of which must\nbe susceptible of completion. But since, as determining grounds of one\nand the same judgement, they must be of the same kind, for otherwise\nthey would not together constitute a whole (such as certainty is), one\npart of them cannot lie within the bounds of possible experience and\nanother outside all possible experience. Consequently, since merely\nempirical grounds of proof lead to nothing supersensible, and since\nwhat is lacking in the series of them cannot in any way be completed,\nwe do not approach in the least nearer in our attempt to attain by\ntheir means to the supersensible and to a cognition thereof. Thus in\nany judgement about the latter by means of arguments derived from\nexperience, probability has no place.\n(4.) If an _hypothesis_ is to serve for the explanation of the\npossibility of a given phenomenon, at least its possibility must\nbe completely certain.[143] It is sufficient that in an hypothesis\nI disclaim any cognition of actuality (which is claimed in an\nopinion given out as probable); more than this I cannot give up. The\npossibility of that which I place at the basis of my explanation,\nmust at least be exposed to no doubt; otherwise there would be no end\nof empty chimeras. But to assume the possibility of a supersensible\nBeing determined according to certain concepts would be a completely\ngroundless supposition. For here none of the conditions requisite\nfor cognition, as regards that in it which rests upon intuition, is\ngiven, and so the sole criterion of possibility remaining is the mere\nprinciple of Contradiction (which can only prove the possibility of the\nthought, not of the object thought).\nThe result then is this. For the existence [Dasein] of the original\nBeing, as a Godhead, or of the soul as an immortal spirit, absolutely\nno proof in a theoretical point of view is possible for the human\nReason, which can bring about even the least degree of belief. The\nground of this is quite easy to comprehend. For determining our\nIdeas of the supersensible we have no material whatever, and we\nmust derive this latter from things in the world of sense, which is\nabsolutely inadequate for such an Object. Thus, in the absence of all\ndetermination of it, nothing remains but the concept of a non-sensible\nsomething which contains the ultimate ground of the world of sense, but\nwhich does not furnish any knowledge (any amplification of the concept)\nof its inner constitution.\n\u00a7 91. _Of the kind of belief produced by a practical faith_\nIf we look merely to the way in which anything can be _for us_\n(according to the subjective constitution of our representative powers)\nan Object of knowledge (_res cognoscibilis_), then our concepts will\nnot cohere with Objects, but merely with our cognitive faculties and\nthe use which they can make of a given representation (in a theoretical\nor practical point of view). Thus the question whether anything is or\nis not a cognisable being is not a question concerning the possibility\nof things but of our knowledge of them.\n_Cognisable_ things are of three kinds: _things of opinion_\n(_opinabile_); _things of fact_ (_scibile_); and _things of faith_\n(_mere credibile_).\n(1.) Objects of mere rational Ideas, which for theoretical knowledge\ncannot be presented in any possible experience, are so far not\n_cognisable_ things, and consequently in respect of them we can form\nno _opinion_; for to form an opinion _a priori_ is absurd in itself\nand the straight road to mere chimeras. Either then our proposition\nis certain _a priori_ or it contains nothing for belief. Therefore\n_things of opinion_ are always Objects of an empirical cognition at\nleast possible in itself (objects of the world of sense); but, which,\non account merely of the [low] degree of this faculty that we possess,\nis _for us_ impossible. Thus the ether of the new physicists,[144]\nan elastic fluid pervading all other matter (mingled intimately with\nit) is a mere thing of opinion, yet is such that, if our external\nsenses were sharpened to the highest degree, it could be perceived;\nthough it can never be presented in any observation or experiment.\nTo assume [the existence of] rational inhabitants of other planets\nis a thing of opinion; for if we could come closer to them, which is\nin itself possible, we should decide by experience whether they did\nor did not exist; but as we shall never come so near, it remains in\nthe region of opinion. But to hold the opinion that there are in the\nmaterial universe pure thinking spirits without bodies (viz. if we\ndismiss as unworthy of our notice certain phenomena which have been\npublished as actual[145]) is to be called poetic fiction. This is no\nthing of opinion, but a mere Idea which remains over, when we remove\nfrom a thinking being everything material, and only leave thought\nto it. Whether then the latter (which we know only in man, that is,\nin combination with a body) does survive, we cannot decide. Such a\nthing is a _sophistical being_ (_ens rationis ratiocinantis_), not a\n_rational being_ (_ens rationis ratiocinatae_)[146]; of which latter it\nis possible to show conclusively, the objective reality of its concept;\nat least for the practical use of Reason, because this which has its\npeculiar and apodictically certain principles _a priori_, demands\n(postulates) it.\n(2.) Objects for concepts, whose objective reality can be proved\n(whether through pure Reason or through experience, and, in the first\ncase, from its theoretical or practical data, in all cases by means of\na corresponding intuition) are _things of fact_ (_res facti_).[147] Of\nthis kind are the mathematical properties of magnitudes (in geometry),\nbecause they are susceptible of a _presentation a priori_ for the\ntheoretical use of Reason. Further, things or their characteristics,\nwhich can be exhibited in experience (either our own or that of others\nthrough the medium of testimony) are likewise things of fact.--And,\nwhat is very remarkable, there is one rational Idea (susceptible in\nitself of no presentation in intuition, and consequently, of no\ntheoretical proof of its possibility) which also comes under things of\nfact. This is the Idea of _freedom_, whose reality, regarded as that\nof a particular kind of causality (of which the concept, theoretically\nconsidered, would be transcendent), may be exhibited by means of\npractical laws of pure Reason, and conformably to this, in actual\nactions, and, consequently, in experience.--This is the only one of all\nthe Ideas of pure Reason, whose object is a thing of fact, and to be\nreckoned under the _scibilia_.\n(3.) Objects, which in reference to the use of pure practical Reason\nthat is in conformity with duty must be thought _a priori_ (whether\nas consequences or as grounds), but which are transcendent for its\ntheoretical use, are mere _things of faith_. Of this kind is the\n_highest good_ in the world, to be brought about by freedom.[148]\nThe concept of this cannot be established as regards its objective\nreality in any experience possible for us and thus adequately for\nthe theoretical use of Reason; but its use is commanded by practical\npure Reason [in reference to the best possible working out of that\npurpose],[149] and it consequently must be assumed possible. This\ncommanded effect, _together with the only conditions of its possibility\nthinkable by us_, viz. the Being of God and the immortality of the\nsoul, are _things of faith_ (_res fidei_), and of all objects are the\nonly ones which can be so called.[150] For though what we learn by\n_testimony_ from the experience of others must be believed by us, yet\nit is not therefore a thing of faith; for it was the proper experience\nof some _one_ witness and so a thing of fact, or is presupposed as\nsuch. Again it must be possible by this path (that of historical faith)\nto arrive at knowledge; and the Objects of history and geography,\nlike everything in general which it is at least possible to know by\nthe constitution of our cognitive faculties, belong not to things of\nfaith but to things of fact. It is only objects of pure Reason which\ncan be things of faith at all, though not as objects of the mere pure\nspeculative Reason: for then they could not be reckoned with certainty\namong things, _i.e._ Objects of that cognition which is possible for\nus. They are Ideas, _i.e._ concepts of the objective reality of which\nwe cannot theoretically be certain. On the other hand, the highest\nfinal purpose to be worked out by us, by which alone we can become\nworthy of being ourselves the final purpose of creation, is an Idea\nwhich has in a practical reference objective reality for us, and is\nalso a thing. But because we cannot furnish such reality to this\nconcept in a theoretical point of view, it is a mere thing of faith\nof the pure Reason, along with God and Immortality, as the conditions\nunder which alone we, in accordance with the constitution of our\n(human) Reason, can conceive the possibility of that effect of the use\nof our freedom in conformity with law. But belief in things of faith is\na belief in a pure practical point of view, _i.e._ a moral faith, which\nproves nothing for theoretical pure rational cognition, but only for\nthat which is practical and directed to the fulfilment of its duties;\nit in no way extends speculation or the practical rules of prudence in\naccordance with the principle of self-love. If the supreme principle\nof all moral laws is a postulate, so is also the possibility of its\nhighest Object; and consequently, too, the condition under which we\ncan think this possibility is postulated along with it and by it.\nThus the cognition of the latter is neither knowledge nor opinion of\nthe being and character of these conditions, regarded as theoretical\ncognition; but is a mere assumption in a reference which is practical\nand commanded for the moral use of our Reason.\nIf we were able also plausibly to base upon the purposes of nature,\nwhich physical Teleology presents to us in such rich abundance, a\n_determinate_ concept of an intelligent World-Cause, then the existence\n[Dasein] of this Being would not be a thing of faith. For since this\nwould not be assumed on behalf of the performance of my duty, but\nonly in reference to the explanation of nature, it would be merely\nthe opinion and hypothesis most conformable to our Reason. Now such\nTeleology leads in no way to a determinate concept of God; on the\ncontrary, this can only be found in the concept of a moral Author of\nthe World, because this alone furnishes the final purpose to which\nwe can only reckon ourselves [as attached] if we behave conformably\nto what the moral law prescribes as final purpose and consequently\nobliges us [to do]. Hence it is only by its reference to the Object of\nour duty, as the condition of the possibility of attaining the final\npurpose of the same, that the concept of God attains the privilege\nof counting as a thing of faith, in our belief; but on the other\nhand, this same concept cannot make its Object valid as a thing of\nfact. For, although the necessity of duty is very plain for practical\nReason, yet the attainment of its final purpose, so far as it is not\naltogether in our own power, is only assumed on behalf of the practical\nuse of Reason, and therefore is not so practically necessary as duty\nitself.[151]\n_Faith_ (as _habitus_, not as _actus_) is the moral attitude of Reason\nas to belief in that which is unattainable by theoretical cognition.\nIt is therefore the constant principle of the mind, to assume as true,\non account of the obligation in reference to it, that which it is\nnecessary to presuppose as condition of the possibility of the highest\nmoral final purpose[152]; although its possibility or impossibility\nbe alike impossible for us to see into. Faith (absolutely so called)\nis trust in the attainment of a design, the promotion of which is a\nduty, but the possibility of the fulfilment of which (and consequently\nalso that of the only conditions of it thinkable by us) is not to be\n_comprehended_ by us. Faith, then, that refers to particular objects,\nwhich are not objects of possible knowledge or opinion (in which latter\ncase it ought to be called, especially in historical matters, credulity\nand not faith), is quite moral. It is a free belief, not in that for\nwhich dogmatical proofs for the theoretically determinant Judgement\nare to be found, or in that to which we hold ourselves bound, but in\nthat which we assume on behalf of a design in accordance with laws of\nfreedom. This, however, is not, like opinion, without any adequate\nground; but, is grounded as in Reason (although only in respect of its\npractical employment), and _adequately for its design_. For without\nthis, the moral attitude of thought in its repudiation of the claim of\nthe theoretical Reason for proofs (of the possibility of the Objects\nof morality) has no permanence; but wavers between practical commands\nand theoretical doubts. To be _incredulous_ means to cling to maxims,\nand not to believe testimony in general; but he is _unbelieving_,\nwho denies all validity to rational Ideas, because there is wanting\na _theoretical_ ground of their reality.[154] He judges therefore\ndogmatically. A dogmatical _unbelief_ cannot subsist together with a\nmoral maxim dominant in the mental attitude (for Reason cannot command\none to follow a purpose, which is cognised as nothing more than a\nchimera); but a _doubtful faith_ can. To this the absence of conviction\nby grounds of speculative Reason is only a hindrance, the influence of\nwhich upon conduct a critical insight into the limits of this faculty\ncan remove, while it substitutes by way of compensation a paramount\npractical belief.\n*       *       *       *       *\nIf, in place of certain mistaken attempts, we wish to introduce a\ndifferent principle into philosophy and to promote its influence, it\nmakes us highly contented to see how and why those attempts must have\ndisappointed us.\n_God_, _freedom_, and _immortality_, are the problems at the solution\nof which all the equipments of Metaphysic aim, as their ultimate and\nunique purpose. Now it was believed that the doctrine of freedom is\nneeded for practical philosophy only as its negative condition; but\nthat on the other hand the doctrine of God and of the constitution of\nthe soul, as belonging to theoretical philosophy, must be established\nfor themselves and separately, in order afterwards to unite both\nwith that which the moral law (possible only under the condition of\nfreedom) commands, and so to constitute a religion. But we can easily\nsee that these attempts must fail. For from mere ontological concepts\nof things in general, or of the existence of a necessary Being, it\nis possible to form absolutely no determinate concept of an original\nBeing by means of predicates which can be given in experience and can\ntherefore serve for cognition. Again a concept based on experience of\nthe physical purposiveness of nature could furnish no adequate proof\nfor morality, or consequently for cognition of a Deity. Just as little\ncould the cognition of the soul by means of experience (which we only\napply in this life) supply us with a concept of its spiritual immortal\nnature, a concept which would be adequate for morality. _Theology_ and\n_Pneumatology_, regarded as problems of the sciences of a speculative\nReason, can be established by no empirical data and predicates,\nbecause the concept of them is transcendent for our whole cognitive\nfaculty.--The determination of both concepts, God and the soul (in\nrespect of its immortality) alike, can only take place by means of\npredicates, which, although they are only possible from a supersensible\nground, must yet prove their reality in experience; for thus alone can\nthey make possible a cognition of a quite supersensible Being.--The\nonly concept of this kind to be met with in human Reason is that of the\nfreedom of men under moral laws, along with the final purpose which\nReason prescribes by these laws. Of these two [the moral laws and the\nfinal purpose] the first are useful for ascribing to the Author of\nNature, the second for ascribing to man, those properties which contain\nthe necessary condition of the possibility of both [God and the soul];\nso that from this Idea a conclusion can be drawn as to the existence\nand constitution of these beings which are otherwise quite hidden from\nus.\nThus the ground of the failure of the attempt to prove God and\nimmortality by the merely theoretical path lies in this, that no\ncognition whatever is possible of the supersensible in this way (of\nnatural concepts). The ground of its success by the moral way (of the\nconcept of freedom) is as follows. Here the supersensible (freedom),\nwhich in this case is fundamental, by a determinate law of causality\nthat springs from it, not only supplies material for cognition of other\nsupersensibles (the moral final purpose and the conditions of its\nattainability), but also establishes its reality in actions as a fact;\nthough at the same time it can furnish a valid ground of proof in no\nother than a practical point of view (the only one, however, of which\nReligion has need).\nIt is thus very remarkable that of the three pure rational Ideas,\n_God_, _freedom_, and _immortality_, that of freedom is the only\nconcept of the supersensible which (by means of the causality that is\nthought in it) proves its objective reality in nature by means of the\neffects it can produce there; and thus renders possible the connexion\nof both the others with nature, and of all three together with\nReligion. We have therefore in us a principle capable of determining\nthe Idea of the supersensible within us, and thus also that of the\nsupersensible without us, for knowledge, although only in a practical\npoint of view; a principle this of which mere speculative philosophy\n(which could give a merely negative concept of freedom) must despair.\nConsequently the concept of freedom (as fundamental concept of all\nunconditioned practical laws) can extend Reason beyond those bounds,\nwithin which every natural (theoretical) concept must remain hopelessly\nlimited.\n_General remark on Teleology_\nIf the question is, what rank the moral argument, which proves the\nBeing of God only as a thing of faith for the practical pure Reason,\nmaintains among the other arguments in philosophy, it is easy to set\naside the whole achievement of this last; by which it appears that\nthere is no choice, but that our theoretical faculty must give up all\nits pretensions before an impartial criticism.\nAll belief must in the first place be grounded upon facts, if it is\nnot to be completely groundless; and therefore the only distinction\nin proofs that there can be is that belief in the consequence derived\ntherefrom can either be grounded on this fact as _knowledge_ for\ntheoretical cognition, or merely as _faith_ for practical. All facts\nbelong either to the _natural concept_ which proves its reality in the\nobjects of sense, given (or which may possibly be given) before all\nnatural concepts; or to the _concept of freedom_, which sufficiently\nestablishes its reality through the causality of Reason in regard of\ncertain effects in the world of sense, possible through it, which it\nincontrovertibly postulates in the moral law. The natural concept\n(merely belonging to theoretical cognition) is now either metaphysical\nand thinkable completely _a priori_, or physical, _i.e._ thinkable\n_a posteriori_ and as necessary only through determinate experience.\nThe metaphysical natural concept (which presupposes no determinate\nexperience) is therefore ontological.\nThe _ontological_ proof of the being of God from the concept of an\noriginal Being is either that which from ontological predicates,\nby which alone it can be thought as completely determined, infers\nabsolutely necessary being; or that which, from the absolute necessity\nof the being somewhere of some thing, whatever it be, infers the\npredicates of the original Being. For there belongs to the concept of\nan original Being, inasmuch as it is not derived from anything, the\nunconditioned necessity of its presence, and (in order to represent\nthis) its complete determination by its [mere][155] concept. It was\nbelieved that both requirements were found in the concept of the\nontological Idea of a _Being the most real of all_; and thus two\nmetaphysical proofs originated.\nThe proof (properly called ontological) resting upon a merely\nmetaphysical natural concept concludes from the concept of the\nBeing the most real of all, its absolutely necessary existence;\nfor (it is said), if it did not exist, a reality would be wanting\nto it, viz. existence.--The other (which is also called the\nmetaphysico-_cosmological_ proof) concludes from the necessity of the\nexistence somewhere of a thing (which must be conceded, for a being\nis given to us in self-consciousness), its complete determination as\nthat of a Being the most real of all; for everything existing must be\ncompletely determined, but the absolutely necessary (_i.e._ that which\n_we_ ought to cognise as such and consequently _a priori_) must be\ncompletely determined _by means of its own concept_. But this is only\nthe case with the concept of a thing the most real of all. It is not\nneedful to expose here the sophistry in both arguments, which has been\nalready done elsewhere;[156] it is only needful to remark that neither\nproof, even if they could be defended by all manner of dialectical\nsubtlety, could ever pass from the schools into the world, or have the\nslightest influence on the mere sound Understanding.\nThe proof, which rests on a natural concept that can only be empirical\nand yet is to lead us beyond the bounds of nature regarded as the\ncomplex of the objects of sense, can be no other than that derived from\nthe _purposes_ of nature. The concept of these cannot, it is true,\nbe given _a priori_ but only through experience; but yet it promises\nsuch a concept of the original ground of nature as alone, among all\nthose which we can conceive, is suited to the supersensible, viz. that\nof a highest Understanding as Cause of the world. This, in fact, it\ncompletely performs in accordance with principles of the reflective\nJudgement, _i.e._ in accordance with the constitution of our (human)\nfaculty of cognition.--But whether or not it is in a position to supply\nfrom the same data this concept of a _supreme_, _i.e._ independent\nintelligent Being, in short of a God or Author of a world under moral\nlaws, and consequently as sufficiently determined for the Idea of a\nfinal purpose of the being of the world--this is the question upon\nwhich everything depends, whether we desire a theoretically adequate\nconcept of the Original Being on behalf of our whole knowledge of\nnature, or a practical concept for religion.\nThis argument derived from physical Teleology is worthy of respect. It\nproduces a similar effect in the way of conviction upon the common\nUnderstanding as upon the subtlest thinker; and a _Reimarus_[157] has\nacquired immortal honour in his work (not yet superseded), in which he\nabundantly develops this ground of proof with his peculiar thoroughness\nand lucidity.--But how does this proof acquire such mighty influence\nupon the mind? How does a judgement by cold reason (for we might\nrefer to persuasion the emotion and elevation of reason produced by\nthe wonders of nature) issue thus in a calm and unreserved assent? It\nis not the physical purposes, which all indicate in the World Cause\nan unfathomable intelligence; these are inadequate thereto, because\nthey do not satisfy the need of the inquiring Reason. For, wherefore\n(it asks) are all those natural things that exhibit art? Wherefore is\nman himself, whom we must regard as the ultimate purpose of nature\nthinkable by us? Wherefore is this collective Nature here, and what\nis the final purpose of such great and manifold art? Reason cannot\nbe contented with enjoyment or with contemplation, observation, and\nadmiration (which, if it stops there, is only enjoyment of a particular\nkind) as the ultimate final purpose for the creation of the world and\nof man himself; for this presupposes a personal worth, which man alone\ncan give himself, as the condition under which alone he and his being\ncan be the final purpose. Failing this (which alone is susceptible\nof a definite concept), the purposes of nature do not satisfactorily\nanswer our questions; especially because they cannot furnish any\n_determinate_ concept of the highest Being as an all-sufficient (and\ntherefore unique and so properly called _highest_) being, and of the\nlaws according to which an Understanding is Cause of the world.\nHence that the physico-teleological proof convinces, just as if it were\na theological proof, does not arise from our availing ourselves of the\nIdeas of purposes of nature as so many empirical grounds of proof of\na _highest_ Understanding. But it mingles itself unnoticed with that\nmoral ground of proof, which dwells in every man and influences him\nsecretly, in the conclusion by which we ascribe to the Being, which\nmanifests itself with such incomprehensible art in the purposes of\nnature, a final purpose and consequently wisdom (without however being\njustified in doing so by the perception of the former); and by which\ntherefore we arbitrarily fill up the lacunas of the [design] argument.\nIn fact it is only the moral ground of proof which produces conviction,\nand that only in a moral reference with which every man feels inwardly\nhis agreement. But the physico-teleological proof has only the merit\nof leading the mind, in its consideration of the world, by the way of\npurposes and through them to an _intelligent_ Author of the world. The\nmoral reference to purposes and the Idea of a moral legislator and\nAuthor of the world, as a theological concept, seem to be developed of\nthemselves out of that ground of proof, although they are in truth pure\nadditions.\nHenceforward we may allow the customary statement to stand. For it\nis generally difficult (if the distinction requires much reflection)\nfor ordinary sound Understanding to distinguish from one another as\nheterogeneous the different principles which it confuses, and from\none of which alone it actually draws conclusions with correctness. The\nmoral ground of proof of the Being of God, properly speaking, does\nnot merely _complete_ and render perfect the physico-teleological\nproof; but it is a special proof that _supplies_ the conviction which\nis wanting in the latter. This latter in fact can do nothing more\nthan guide Reason, in its judgements upon the ground of nature and\nthat contingent but admirable order of nature only known to us by\nexperience, to the causality of a Cause containing the ground of the\nsame in accordance with purposes (which we by the constitution of our\ncognitive faculties must think as an intelligent cause); and thus by\narresting the attention of Reason it makes it more susceptible of\nthe moral proof. For what is requisite to the latter concept is so\nessentially different from everything which natural concepts contain\nand can teach, that there is need of a particular ground of proof\nquite independent of the former, in order to supply the concept of the\noriginal Being adequately for Theology and to infer its existence.--The\nmoral proof (which it is true only proves the Being of God in a\npractical though indispensable aspect of Reason) would preserve all\nits force, if we found in the world no material, or only that which\nis doubtful, for physical Teleology. It is possible to conceive\nrational beings surrounded by a nature which displayed no clear trace\nof organisation but only the effects of a mere mechanism of crude\nmatter; on behalf of which and amid the changeability of some merely\ncontingent purposive forms and relations there would appear to be no\nground for inferring an intelligent Author. In such case there would\nbe no occasion for a physical Teleology; and yet Reason, which here\ngets no guidance from natural concepts, would find in the concept of\nfreedom and in the moral Ideas founded thereon a practically sufficient\nground for postulating the concept of the original Being in conformity\nwith these, _i.e._ as a Deity, and for postulating nature (even the\nnature of our own being) as a final purpose in accordance with freedom\nand its laws--and all this in reference to the indispensable command of\npractical Reason.--However the fact that there is in the actual world\nfor the rational beings in it abundant material for physical Teleology\n(even though this is not necessary) serves as a desirable confirmation\nof the moral argument, as far as nature can exhibit anything analogous\nto the (moral) rational Ideas. For the concept of a supreme Cause\npossessing intelligence (though not reaching far enough for a Theology)\nthus acquires sufficient reality for the reflective Judgement, but it\nis not required as the basis of the moral proof; nor does this latter\nserve to complete as a proof the former, which does not by itself point\nto morality at all, by means of an argument developed according to\na single principle. Two such heterogeneous principles as nature and\nfreedom can only furnish two different kinds of proof; and the attempt\nto derive one from the other is found unavailing as regards that which\nis to be proved.\nIf the physico-teleological ground of proof sufficed for the proof\nwhich is sought, it would be very satisfactory for the speculative\nReason; for it would furnish the hope of founding a Theosophy (for\nso we must call the theoretical cognition of the divine nature and\nits existence which would suffice at once for the explanation of the\nconstitution of the world and for the determination of moral laws).\nIn the same way if Psychology enabled us to arrive at a cognition\nof the immortality of the soul it would make Pneumatology possible,\nwhich would be just as welcome to the speculative Reason. But neither,\nagreeable as they would be to the arrogance of our curiosity, would\nsatisfy the wish of Reason in respect of a theory which must be based\non a cognition of the nature of things. Whether the first, as Theology,\nand the second, as Anthropology, when founded on the moral principle,\n_i.e._ the principle of freedom, and consequently in accordance with\nthe practical use [of Reason] do not better fulfil their objective\nfinal design, is another question which we need not here pursue.\nThe physico-teleological ground of proof does not reach to Theology,\nbecause it does not and cannot give any determinate concept, sufficient\nfor this design, of the original Being; but we must derive this from\nquite another quarter, or must supply its lacuna by an arbitrary\naddition. You infer, from the great purposiveness of natural forms and\ntheir relations, a world-cause endowed with Understanding; but what is\nthe degree of this Understanding? Without doubt you cannot assume that\nit is the highest possible Understanding; because for that it would be\nrequisite that you should see that a greater Understanding than that\nof which you perceive proofs in the world, is not thinkable; and this\nwould be to ascribe Omniscience to yourself.[158] In the same way,\nif you infer from the magnitude of the world the very great might of\nits Author, you must be content with this having only a comparative\nsignificance for your faculty of comprehension; for since you do not\nknow all that is possible, so as to compare it with the magnitude of\nthe world as far as you know it, you cannot infer the Almightiness\nof its Author from so small a standard, and so on. Now you arrive in\nthis way at no definite concept of an original Being available for a\nTheology; for this can only be found in the concept of the totality of\nperfections compatible with intelligence, and you cannot help yourself\nto this by merely _empirical_ data. But without such a definite concept\nyou cannot infer a _unique_ intelligent original Being; you can only\nassume it (with whatever motive).--Now it may certainly be conceded\nthat you should arbitrarily add (for Reason has nothing fundamental to\nsay to the contrary): Where so much perfection is found, we may well\nassume that all perfection is united in a unique Cause of the world,\nbecause Reason succeeds better both theoretically and practically with\na principle thus definite. But then you cannot regard this concept\nof the original Being as proved by you, for you have only assumed it\non behalf of a better employment of Reason. Hence all lamentation or\nimpotent anger on account of the alleged mischief of rendering doubtful\nthe coherency of your chain of reasoning, is vain pretentiousness,\nwhich would fain have us believe that the doubt here freely expressed\nas to your argument is a doubting of sacred truth, in order that under\nthis cover the shallowness of your argument may pass unnoticed.\nMoral Teleology, on the other hand, which is not less firmly based\nthan physical,--which, indeed, rather deserves the preference because\nit rests _a priori_ on principles inseparable from our Reason--leads\nto that which is requisite for the possibility of a Theology, viz. to\na determinate _concept_ of the supreme Cause, as Cause of the world\naccording to moral laws, and, consequently, to the concept of such a\ncause as satisfies our moral final purpose. For this are required, as\nnatural properties belonging to it, nothing less than Omniscience,\nOmnipotence, Omnipresence, and the like, which must be thought as\nbound up with the moral final purpose which is infinite and thus as\nadequate to it. Hence moral Teleology alone can furnish the concept of\na _unique_ Author of the world, which is available for a Theology.\nIn this way Theology leads immediately to _Religion_, _i.e._ _the\nrecognition of our duties as divine commands_[159]; because it is only\nthe recognition of our duty and of the final purpose enjoined upon us\nby Reason which brings out with definiteness the concept of God. This\nconcept, therefore, is inseparable in its origin from obligation to\nthat Being. On the other hand, even if the concept of the original\nBeing could be also found determinately by the merely theoretical path\n(viz. the concept of it as mere Cause of nature), it would afterwards\nbe very difficult--perhaps impossible without arbitrary interpolation\n[of elements]--to ascribe to this Being by well-grounded proofs a\ncausality in accordance with moral laws; and yet without this that\nquasi-theological concept could furnish no foundation for religion.\nEven if a religion could be established by this theoretical path, it\nwould actually, as regards sentiment (wherein its essence lies) be\ndifferent from that in which the concept of God and the (practical)\nconviction of His Being originate from the fundamental Ideas of\nmorality. For if we must suppose the Omnipotence, Omniscience, etc., of\nan Author of the world as concepts given to us from another quarter,\nin order afterwards only to apply our concepts of duties to our\nrelation to Him, then these latter concepts must bear very markedly\nthe appearance of compulsion and forced submission. If, instead of\nthis, the respect for the moral law, quite freely, in virtue of the\nprecept of our own Reason, represents to us the final purpose of our\ndestination, we admit among our moral views a Cause harmonising with\nthis and with its accomplishment, with the sincerest reverence, which\nis quite distinct from pathological fear; and we willingly submit\nourselves thereto.[160]\nIf it be asked why it is incumbent upon us to have any Theology at all,\nit appears clear that it is not needed for the extension or correction\nof our cognition of nature or in general for any theory, but simply\nin a subjective point of view for Religion, _i.e._ the practical or\nmoral use of our Reason. If it is found that the only argument which\nleads to a definite concept of the object of Theology is itself moral,\nit is not only not strange, but we miss nothing in respect of its\nfinal purpose as regards the sufficiency of belief from this ground\nof proof, provided that it be admitted that such an argument only\nestablishes the Being of God sufficiently for our moral destination,\n_i.e._ in a practical point of view, and that here speculation neither\nshows its strength in any way, nor extends by means of it the sphere\nof its domain. Our surprise and the alleged contradiction between the\npossibility of a Theology asserted here and that which the Critique\nof speculative Reason said of the Categories--viz. that they can only\nproduce knowledge when applied to objects of sense, but in no way when\napplied to the supersensible--vanish, if we see that they are here\nused for a cognition of God not in a theoretical point of view (in\naccordance with what His own nature, inscrutable to us, may be) but\nsimply in a practical.--In order then at this opportunity to make an\nend of the misinterpretation of that very necessary doctrine of the\nCritique, which, to the chagrin of the blind dogmatist, refers Reason\nto its bounds, I add here the following elucidation.\nIf I ascribe to a body _motive force_ and thus think it by means of\nthe category of _causality_, then I at the same time _cognise_ it\nby that [category]; _i.e._ I determine the concept of it, as of an\nObject in general, by means of what belongs to it by itself (as the\ncondition of the possibility of that relation) as an object of sense.\nIf the motive force ascribed to it is repulsive, then there belongs to\nit (although I do not place near it any other body upon which it may\nexert force) a place in space, and moreover extension, _i.e._ space\nin itself, besides the filling up of this by means of the repulsive\nforces of its parts. In addition there is the law of this filling up\n(that the ground of the repulsion of the parts must decrease in the\nsame proportion as the extension of the body increases, and as the\nspace, which it fills with the same parts by means of this force, is\naugmented).--On the contrary, if I think a supersensible Being as the\nfirst _mover_, and thus by the category of causality as regards its\ndetermination of the world (motion of matter), I must not think it as\nexisting in any place in space nor as extended; I must not even think\nit as existing in time or simultaneously with other beings. Hence I\nhave no determinations whatever, which could make intelligible to me\nthe condition of the possibility of motion by means of this Being as\nits ground. Consequently, I do not in the very least cognise it by\nmeans of the predicate of Cause (as first mover), for itself; but I\nhave only the representation of a something containing the ground\nof the motions in the world; and the relation of the latter to it\nas their cause, since it does not besides furnish me with anything\nbelonging to the constitution of the thing which is cause, leaves its\nconcept quite empty. The reason of this is, that by predicates which\nonly find their Object in the world of sense I can indeed proceed\nto the being of something which must contain their ground, but not\nto the determination of its concept as a supersensible being, which\nexcludes all these predicates. By the category of causality, then,\nif I determine it by the concept of a _first mover_, I do not in the\nvery least cognise what God is. Perhaps, however, I shall have better\nsuccess if I start from the order of the world, not merely to _think_\nits causality as that of a supreme _Understanding_, but to _cognise_\nit by means of this determination of the said concept; because here\nthe troublesome condition of space and of extension disappears.--At\nall events the great purposiveness in the world compels us to _think_\na supreme cause of it, and to _think_ its causality as that of an\nUnderstanding; but we are not therefore entitled to _ascribe_ this to\nit. (_E.g._ we think of the eternity of God as presence in all time,\nbecause we can form no other concept of mere being as a quantum, _i.e._\nas duration; or we think of the divine Omnipresence as presence in\nall places in order to make comprehensible to ourselves His immediate\npresence in things which are external to one another; without daring\nto ascribe to God any of these determinations, as something cognised\nin Him.) If I determine the causality of a man, in respect of certain\nproducts which are only explicable by designed purposiveness, by\nthinking it as that of Understanding, I need not stop here, but I can\nascribe to him this predicate as a well-known property and cognise him\naccordingly. For I know that intuitions are given to the senses of men\nand are brought by the Understanding under a concept and thus under a\nrule; that this concept only contains the common characteristic (with\nomission of the particular ones) and is thus discursive; and that the\nrules for bringing given representations under a consciousness in\ngeneral are given by Understanding before those intuitions, etc. I\ntherefore ascribe this property to man as a property by means of which\nI _cognise_ him. However, if I wish to _think_ a supersensible Being\n(God) as an intelligence, this is not only permissible in a certain\naspect of my employment of Reason--it is unavoidable; but to ascribe\nto Him Understanding and to flatter ourselves that we can _cognise_\nHim by means of it as a property of His, is in no way permissible.\nFor I must omit all those conditions under which alone I know an\nUnderstanding, and thus the predicate which only serves for determining\nman cannot be applied at all to a supersensible Object; and therefore\nby a causality thus determined, I cannot cognise what God is. And so it\nis with all Categories, which can have no significance for cognition in\na theoretical aspect, if they are not applied to objects of possible\nexperience.--However, according to the analogy of an Understanding I\ncan in a certain other aspect think a supersensible being, without at\nthe same time meaning thereby to cognise it theoretically; viz. if this\ndetermination of its causality concerns an effect in the world, which\ncontains a design morally necessary but unattainable by a sensible\nbeing. For then a cognition of God and of His Being (Theology) is\npossible by means of properties and determinations of His causality\nmerely thought in Him according to analogy, which has all requisite\nreality in a practical reference though _only in respect of this_\n(as moral).--An Ethical Theology is therefore possible; for though\nmorality can subsist without theology as regards its rule, it cannot\ndo so as regards the final design which this proposes, unless Reason\nin respect of it is to be renounced. But a Theological Ethic (of pure\nReason) is impossible; for laws which Reason itself does not give and\nwhose observance it does not bring about as a pure practical faculty,\ncan not be moral. In the same way a Theological Physic would be a\nnonentity, for it would propose no laws of nature but ordinances of a\nHighest Will; while on the other hand a physical (properly speaking a\nphysico-teleological) Theology can serve at least as a propaedeutic\nto Theology proper, by giving occasion for the Idea of a final purpose\nwhich nature cannot present by the observation of natural purposes of\nwhich it offers abundant material. It thus makes felt the need of a\nTheology which shall determine the concept of God adequately for the\nhighest practical use of Reason, but it cannot develop this and base it\nsatisfactorily on its proofs.\nTHE END\n_Printed by_ R. & R.

Objection has been brought against a similar\nprocedure of mine (cf. the Preface to the Critique of Practical Reason,\n_Abbott\u2019s Translation_, p. 94), and my definition of the faculty\nof desire has been found fault with, viz. that it is [the being\u2019s]\n_faculty of becoming by means of its representations the cause of the\nactuality of the objects of these representations_; for the desires\nmight be mere _cravings_, and by means of these alone every one is\nconvinced the Object cannot be produced.--But this proves nothing more\nthan that there are desires in man, by which he is in contradiction\nwith himself. For here he strives for the production of the Object\nby means of the representation _alone_, from which he can expect no\nresult, because he is conscious that his mechanical powers (if I may\nso call those which are not psychological) which must be determined\nby that representation to bring about the Object (mediately) are\neither not competent, or even tend towards what is impossible; e.g.\nto reverse the past (_O mihi praeteritos_ ... etc.), or to annihilate\nin the impatience of expectation the interval before the wished for\nmoment.--Although in such fantastic desires we are conscious of the\ninadequacy (or even the unsuitability) of our representations for\nbeing _causes_ of their objects, yet their reference as causes, and\nconsequently the representation of their _causality_, is contained in\nevery _wish_; and this is specially evident if the wish is an affection\nor _longing_. For these [longings] by their dilatation and contraction\nof the heart and consequent exhaustion of its powers, prove that these\npowers are continually kept on the stretch by representations, but that\nthey perpetually let the mind, having regard to the impossibility [of\nthe desire], fall back in exhaustion. Even prayers for the aversion\nof great and (as far as one can see) unavoidable evils, and many\nsuperstitious means for attaining in a natural way impossible purposes,\npoint to the causal reference of representations to their Objects; a\nreference which cannot at all be checked by the consciousness of the\ninadequacy of the effort to produce the effect.--As to why there should\nbe in our nature this propensity to desires which are consciously vain,\nthat is an anthropologico-teleological problem. It seems that if we\nwere not determined to the application of our powers before we were\nassured of the adequacy of our faculties to produce an Object, these\npowers would remain in great part unused. For we commonly learn to\nknow our powers only by first making trial of them. This deception in\nthe case of vain wishes is then only the consequence of a benevolent\nordinance in our nature. [This note was added by Kant in the Second\nEdition.]\n[10] One of the various pretended contradictions in this whole\ndistinction of the causality of nature from that of freedom is\nthis. It is objected that if I speak of _obstacles_ which nature\nopposes to causality according to (moral) laws of freedom or of the\n_assistance_ it affords, I am admitting an _influence_ of the former\nupon the latter. But if we try to understand what has been said, this\nmisinterpretation is very easy to avoid. The opposition or assistance\nis not between nature and freedom, but between the former as phenomenon\nand the _effects_ of the latter as phenomena in the world of sense.\nThe causality of freedom itself (of pure and practical Reason) is\nthe causality of a natural cause subordinated to freedom (_i.e._\nof the subject considered as man and therefore as phenomenon). The\nintelligible, which is thought under freedom, contains the ground of\nthe _determination_ of this [natural cause] in a way not explicable\nany further (just as that intelligible does which constitutes the\nsupersensible substrate of nature).\n[11] It has been thought a doubtful point that my divisions in pure\nPhilosophy should always be threefold. But that lies in the nature of\nthe thing. If there is to be an _a priori_ division it must be either\n_analytical_, according to the law of contradiction, which is always\ntwofold (_quodlibet ens est aut A aut non A_); or it is _synthetical_.\nAnd if in this latter case it is to be derived from _a priori concepts_\n(not as in Mathematic from the intuition corresponding to the concept),\nthe division must necessarily be trichotomy. For according to what\nis requisite for synthetical unity in general there must be (1) a\ncondition, (2) a conditioned, and (3) the concept which arises from the\nunion of the conditioned with its condition.\n[12] The definition of taste which is laid down here is that it is the\nfaculty of judging of the beautiful. But the analysis of judgements of\ntaste must show what is required in order to call an object beautiful.\nThe moments, to which this Judgement has regard in its reflection, I\nhave sought in accordance with the guidance of the logical functions of\njudgement (for in a judgement of taste a reference to the Understanding\nis always involved). I have considered the moment of quality first,\nbecause the aesthetical judgement upon the beautiful first pays\nattention to it.\n[13] A judgement upon an object of satisfaction may be quite\n_disinterested_, but yet very _interesting_, _i.e._ not based upon an\ninterest, but bringing an interest with it; of this kind are all pure\nmoral judgements. Judgements of taste, however, do not in themselves\nestablish any interest. Only in society is it _interesting_ to have\ntaste: the reason of this will be shown in the sequel.\n[14] [Second Edition.]\n[15] An obligation to enjoyment is a manifest absurdity. Thus the\nobligation to all actions which have merely enjoyment for their aim can\nonly be a pretended one; however spiritually it may be conceived (or\ndecked out), even if it is a mystical, or so-called heavenly, enjoyment.\n[16] [Second Edition.]\n[17] [Second Edition.]\n[18] [Ueberweg points out (_Hist. of Phil._, ii. 528, Eng.

It is sometimes\nunderstood as a concept belonging to Transcendental Philosophy; viz.\nthe concept of the _totality_ of the manifold, which, taken together,\nconstitutes a Thing; sometimes, again, it is understood as belonging to\n_Teleology_, so that it signifies the agreement of the characteristics\nof a thing with a _purpose_.

The second, because learned\nlanguages have a grammar which is subject to no wanton change of\nfashion, but the rules of which are preserved unchanged.\n[35] [This distinction between an _Idea_ and an _Ideal_, as also\nthe further contrast between Ideals of the Reason and Ideals of the\nImagination, had already been given by Kant in the _Critique of Pure\nReason_, Dialectic, bk. ii. c. iii. \u00a7 1.]\n[36] [Polycletus of Argos flourished about 430 B.C. His statue of the\n_Spearbearer_ (_Doryphorus_), afterwards became known as the _Canon_;\nbecause in it the artist was supposed to have embodied a perfect\nrepresentation of the ideal of the human figure.]\n[37] [This was a celebrated statue executed by Myron, a Greek sculptor,\ncontemporary with Polycletus. It is frequently mentioned in the Greek\nAnthology.]\n[38] It will be found that a perfectly regular countenance, such\nas a painter might wish to have for a model, ordinarily tells us\nnothing; because it contains nothing characteristic, and therefore\nrather expresses the Idea of the race than the specific [traits] of\na person. The exaggeration of a characteristic of this kind, _i.e._\nsuch as does violence to the normal Idea (the purposiveness of the\nrace) is called _caricature_. Experience also shows that these quite\nregular countenances commonly indicate internally only a mediocre man;\npresumably (if it may be assumed that external nature expresses the\nproportions of internal) because, if no mental disposition exceeds that\nproportion which is requisite in order to constitute a man free from\nfaults, nothing can be expected of what is called _genius_, in which\nnature seems to depart from the ordinary relations of the mental powers\non behalf of some special one.\n[39] It might be objected to this explanation that there are things, in\nwhich we see a purposive form without cognising any [definite] purpose\nin them, like the stone implements often got from old sepulchral\ntumuli with a hole in them as if for a handle. These, although they\nplainly indicate by their shape a purposiveness of which we do not\nknow the purpose, are nevertheless not described as beautiful. But if\nwe regard a thing as a work of art, that is enough to make us admit\nthat its shape has reference to some design and definite purpose. And\nhence there is no immediate satisfaction in the contemplation of it.\nOn the other hand a flower, _e.g._ a tulip, is regarded as beautiful;\nbecause in perceiving it we find a certain purposiveness which, in our\njudgement, is referred to no purpose at all.\n[40] [Cp. p. 170, _infra_.]\n[41] [See _The History of Sumatra_, by W.

The\nformer are related merely to feeling; the latter belong to the faculty\nof desire, and are inclinations which render difficult or impossible\nall determination of the [elective] will by principles. The former are\nstormy and unpremeditated; the latter are steady and deliberate; thus\nindignation in the form of wrath is an affection, but in the form of\nhatred (revenge) is a passion. The latter can never and in no reference\nbe called sublime; because while in an affection the freedom of the\nmind is _hindered_, in a passion it is abolished. [Cf.

This\nmust be true, because otherwise men would not be able to communicate\ntheir representations or even their knowledge. (2) The judgement must\nmerely have reference to this relation (consequently to the _formal\ncondition_ of the Judgement) and be pure, _i.e._ not mingled either\nwith concepts of the Object or with sensations, as determining grounds.\nIf there has been any mistake as regards this latter condition, then\nthere is only an inaccurate application of the privilege, which a law\ngives us, to a particular case; but that does not destroy the privilege\nitself in general.\n[72] [Kant lays down these three maxims in his _Introduction to Logic_,\n\u00a7 vii., as \u201cgeneral rules and conditions of the avoidance of error.\u201d]\n[73] We soon see that although enlightenment is easy _in thesi_, yet\n_in hypothesi_ it is difficult and slow of accomplishment. For not to\nbe passive as regards Reason, but to be always self-legislative, is\nindeed quite easy for the man who wishes only to be in accordance with\nhis essential purpose, and does not desire to know what is beyond his\nUnderstanding. But since we can hardly avoid seeking this, and there\nare never wanting others who promise with much confidence that they\nare able to satisfy our curiosity, it must be very hard to maintain in\nor restore to the mind (especially the mind of the public) that bare\nnegative which properly constitutes enlightenment.\n[74] We may designate Taste as _sensus communis aestheticus_, common\nUnderstanding as _sensus communis logicus_.\n[75] [Peter Camper (1722-1789), a celebrated naturalist and comparative\nanatomist; for some years professor at Groningen.]\n[76] In my country a common man, if you propose to him such a problem\nas that of Columbus with his egg, says, _that is not art, it is only\nscience_. _I.e._ if we _know_ how, we can _do_ it; and he says the same\nof all the pretended arts of jugglers.

But since it actually takes its forms from nature (trees,\nshrubs, grasses, and flowers from forest and field--at least in the\nfirst instance), and so far is not an art like Plastic; and since it\nalso has no concept of the object and its purpose (as in Architecture)\nconditioning its arrangements, but involves merely the free play of the\nImagination in contemplation, it so far agrees with mere aesthetical\npainting which has no definite theme (which arranges sky, land, and\nwater, so as to entertain us by means of light and shade only).--In\ngeneral the reader is only to judge of this as an attempt to combine\nthe beautiful arts under one principle, viz. that of the expression\nof aesthetical Ideas (according to the analogy of speech), and not to\nregard it as a definitive analysis of them.\n[92] I must admit that a beautiful poem has always given me a pure\ngratification; whilst the reading of the best discourse, whether of a\nRoman orator or of a modern parliamentary speaker or of a preacher, has\nalways been mingled with an unpleasant feeling of disapprobation of\na treacherous art, which means to move men in important matters like\nmachines to a judgement that must lose all weight for them on quiet\nreflection. Readiness and accuracy in speaking (which taken together\nconstitute Rhetoric) belong to beautiful art; but the art of the orator\n(_ars oratoria_), the art of availing oneself of the weaknesses of men\nfor one\u2019s own designs (whether these be well meant or even actually\ngood does not matter) is worthy of no _respect_. Again, this art only\nreached its highest point, both at Athens and at Rome, at a time when\nthe state was hastening to its ruin and true patriotic sentiment had\ndisappeared. The man who along with a clear insight into things has in\nhis power a wealth of pure speech, and who with a fruitful Imagination\ncapable of presenting his Ideas unites a lively sympathy with what is\ntruly good, is the _vir bonus discendi peritus_, the orator without\nart but of great impressiveness, as _Cicero_ has it; though he may not\nalways remain true to this ideal.\n[93] [From this to the end of the paragraph, and the next note, were\nadded in the Second Edition.]\n[94] Those who recommend the singing of spiritual songs at family\nprayers do not consider that they inflict a great hardship upon\nthe public by such _noisy_ (and therefore in general pharisaical)\ndevotions; for they force the neighbours either to sing with them\nor to abandon their meditations.

On the other hand, we\ncan only speak of a judgement as rational (_judicium ratiocinatum_)\nwhich is thought as the conclusion of a syllogism, and consequently as\ngrounded _a priori_.\n[100] [Cf. p. 241, _infra_.]\n[101] [Second Edition.]\n[102] [Antiparos is a small island in the Cyclades, remarkable for a\nsplendid stalactite cavern near the southern coast.]\n[103] The intuitive in cognition must be opposed to the discursive\n(not to the symbolical). The former is either _schematical_, by\n_demonstration_; or _symbolical_ as a representation in accordance with\na mere _analogy_.\n[104] [I read _Geselligkeit_ with Rosenkranz and Windelband;\nHartenstein and Kirchmann have _Gl\u00fcckseligkeit_.]\n[105] As in pure mathematics we can never talk of the existence, but\nonly of the possibility of things, viz. of an intuition corresponding\nto a concept, and so never of cause and effect, it follows that all\npurposiveness observed there must be considered merely as formal and\nnever as a natural purpose.\n[106] [The allusion is to _Vitruvius de Architectura_, Bk. vi.\nPraef. \u201cAristippus philosophus Socraticus, naufragio cum eiectus ad\nRhodiensium litus animadvertisset geometrica schemata descripta,\nexclamavisse ad comites ita dicitur, Bene speremus, hominum enim\nvestigia video.\u201d]\n[107] [Second Edition.]\n[108] We can conversely throw light upon a certain combination, much\nmore often met with in Idea than in actuality, by means of an analogy\nto the so-called immediate natural purposes. In a recent complete\ntransformation of a great people into a state the word _organisation_\nfor the regulation of magistracies, etc., and even of the whole\nbody politic, has often been fitly used. For in such a whole every\nmember should surely be purpose as well as means, and, whilst all\nwork together towards the possibility of the whole, each should be\ndetermined as regards place and function by means of the Idea of the\nwhole. [Kant probably alludes here to the organisation of the United\nStates of America.]\n[109] [These words are inserted by Rosenkranz and Windelband, but\nomitted by Hartenstein and Kirchmann.]\n[110] In the aesthetical part [\u00a7 58, p. 247] it was said: _We\nview beautiful nature with favour_, whilst we have a quite free\n(disinterested) satisfaction in its form. For in this mere judgement of\ntaste no consideration is given to the purpose for which these natural\nbeauties exist; whether to excite pleasure in us, or as purposes\nwithout any reference to us at all. But in a teleological judgement we\npay attention to this reference, and here we can _regard it as a favour\nof nature_ that it has been willing to minister to our culture by the\nexhibition of so many beautiful figures.\n[111] The German word _vermessen_ is a good word and full of meaning.\nA judgement in which we forget to consider the extent of our powers\n(our Understanding) may sometimes sound very humble, and yet make great\npretensions, and so be very presumptuous. Of this kind are most of\nthose by which we pretend to extol the divine wisdom by ascribing to\nit designs in the works of creation and preservation which are really\nmeant to do honour to the private wisdom of the reasoner.\n[112] We thus see that in most speculative things of pure Reason, as\nregards dogmatic assertions, the philosophical schools have commonly\ntried all possible solutions of a given question. To explain the\npurposiveness of nature men have tried either _lifeless matter_ or\na _lifeless God_, or again, _living matter_ or a _living God_. It\nonly remains for us, if the need should arise, to abandon all these\nobjective _assertions_ and to examine critically our judgement merely\nin reference to our cognitive faculties, in order to supply to their\nprinciple a validity which, if not dogmatic, shall at least be that of\na maxim sufficient for the sure employment of Reason.\n[113] [That is, the wider concept serves as a universal, under which\nthe particular may be brought; cognition from principles, in Kant\u2019s\nphrase, is the process of knowing the particular in the universal by\nmeans of concepts.]\n[114] [This distinction will be familiar to the student of the\n_Critique of Pure Reason_. See Dialectic, bk. i., _Of the Concepts of\nPure Reason_.]\n[115] [Second Edition.]\n[116] [This principle, that for our intellect, the conception of an\norganised body is impossible except by the aid of the Idea of design,\nis frequently insisted on by Kant. Professor Wallace points out\n(_Kant_, p. 110) that as far back as 1755, in his _General Physiogony\nand Theory of the Heavens_, Kant classed the origin of animals and\nplants with the secrets of Providence and the mystical number 666 \u201cas\none of the topics on which ingenuity and thought are occasionally\nwasted.\u201d]\n[117] [Second Edition.]\n[118] [Second Edition.]\n[119] [This is marked as an _Appendix_ in the Second Edition.]\n[120] We may call a hypothesis of this kind a daring venture of reason,\nand there may be few even of the most acute naturalists through whose\nhead it has not sometimes passed. For it is not absurd, like that\n_generatio aequivoca_ by which is understood the production of an\norganised being through the mechanics of crude unorganised matter.\nIt would always remain _generatio univoca_ in the most universal\nsense of the word, for it only considers one organic being as derived\nfrom another organic being, although from one which is specifically\ndifferent; _e.g._ certain water-animals transform themselves gradually\ninto marsh-animals and from these, after some generations, into\nland-animals. _A priori_, in the judgement of Reason alone, there is no\ncontradiction here. Only experience gives no example of it; according\nto experience all generation that we know is _generatio homonyma_.\nThis is not merely _univoca_ in contrast to the generation out of\nunorganised material, but in the organisation the product is of like\nkind to that which produced it; and _generation heteronyma_, so far as\nour empirical knowledge of nature extends, is nowhere found.\n[121] [It is probable that Kant alludes here to Hume\u2019s Essay _On a\nProvidence and a Future State_, \u00a7 xi of the _Inquiry_. Hume argues that\nthough the inference from an effect to an intelligent cause may be\nvalid in the case of human contrivance, it is not legitimate to rise by\na like argument to Supreme Intelligence. \u201cIn human nature there is a\ncertain experienced coherence of designs and inclinations; so that when\nfrom any fact we have discovered one intention of any man, it may often\nbe reasonable from experience to infer another, and draw a long chain\nof conclusions concerning his past or future conduct. But this method\nof reasoning can never have place with regard to a being so remote and\nincomprehensible, who bears much less analogy to any other being in the\nuniverse than the sun to a waxen taper, and who discovers himself only\nby some faint traces or outlines, beyond which we have no authority to\nascribe to him any attribute or perfection.\u201d]\n[122] [J. F. Blumenbach (1752-1840), a German naturalist and professor\nat G\u00f6ttingen; the author of _Institutiones Physiologicae_ (1787) and\nother works.

As sculptured stones, etc., belong to the province of art,\nso petrefactions belong to the archaeology of nature. And since work\nis actually being done in this [science] (under the name of the Theory\nof the Earth), constantly, although of course slowly, this name is not\ngiven to a merely imaginary investigation of nature, but to one to\nwhich nature itself leads and invites us.\n[125] [See p. 184 above.]\n[126] [First Edition has _freedom_.]\n[127] [These views are set forth by Kant more fully in the essay _Zum\newigen Frieden_ (1795).]\n[128] [Second Edition.]\n[129] [Cf. _The Philosophical Theory of Religion_, Part i., _On the bad\nprinciple in Human Nature_, III., where Kant remarks that although war\n\u201cis not so incurably bad as the deadness of a universal monarchy ...\nyet, as an ancient observed, it makes more bad men than it takes away.\u201d]\n[130] The value of life for us, if it is estimated by that _which we\nenjoy_ (by the natural purpose of the sum of all inclinations, _i.e._\nhappiness), is easy to decide. It sinks below zero; for who would be\nwilling to enter upon life anew under the same conditions? who would do\nso even according to a new, self-chosen plan (yet in conformity with\nthe course of nature), if it were merely directed to enjoyment? We\nhave shown above what value life has in virtue of what it contains in\nitself, when lived in accordance with the purpose that nature has along\nwith us, and which consists in what we do (not merely what we enjoy),\nin which, however, we are always but means towards an undetermined\nfinal purpose. There remains then nothing but the value which we\nourselves give our life, through what we can not only do, but do\npurposively in such independence of nature that the existence of nature\nitself can only be a purpose under this condition.\n[131] It would be possible that the happiness of rational beings in\nthe world should be a purpose of nature, and then also this would be\nits _ultimate_ purpose. At least we cannot see _a priori_ why nature\nshould not be so ordered, because by means of its mechanism this\neffect would be certainly possible, at least so far as we see. But\nmorality, with a causality according to purposes subordinated thereto,\nis absolutely impossible by means of natural causes; for the principle\nby which it determines to action is supersensible, and is therefore\nthe only possible principle in the order of purposes that in respect\nof nature is absolutely unconditioned. Its subject consequently alone\nis qualified to be the _final purpose_ of creation to which the whole\nof nature is subordinated.--_Happiness_, on the contrary, as has been\nshown in the preceding paragraphs by the testimony of experience, is\nnot even a _purpose of nature_ in respect of man in preference to\nother creatures; much less a _final purpose of creation_. Men may of\ncourse make it their ultimate subjective purpose. But if I ask, in\nreference to the final purpose of creation, why must men exist? then\nwe are speaking of an objective supreme purpose, such as the highest\nReason would require for creation. If we answer: These beings exist\nto afford objects for the benevolence of that Supreme Cause; then we\ncontradict the condition to which the Reason of man subjects even his\ninmost wish for happiness (viz. the harmony with his own internal moral\nlegislation). This proves that happiness can only be a conditioned\npurpose, and that it is only as a moral being that man can be the final\npurpose of creation; but that as concerns his state happiness is only\nconnected with it as a consequence, according to the measure of his\nharmony with that purpose regarded as the purpose of his being.\n[132] [Second Edition.]\n[133] I say deliberately under moral laws. It is not man _in accordance\nwith_ moral laws, _i.e._ a being who behaves himself in conformity\nwith them, who is the final purpose of creation. For by using the\nlatter expression we should be asserting more than we know; viz. that\nit is in the power of an Author of the world to cause man always to\nbehave himself in accordance with moral laws. But this presupposes a\nconcept of freedom and of nature (of which latter we can only think an\nexternal author), which would imply an insight into the supersensible\nsubstrate of nature and its identity with that which causality through\nfreedom makes possible in the world. And this far surpasses the\ninsight of our Reason. Only of _man under moral laws_ can we say,\nwithout transgressing the limits of our insight: his being constitutes\nthe final purpose of the world. This harmonises completely with the\njudgement of human Reason reflecting morally upon the course of the\nworld. We believe that we perceive in the case of the wicked the traces\nof a wise purposive reference, if we only see that the wanton criminal\ndoes not die before he has undergone the deserved punishment of his\nmisdeeds. According to our concepts of free causality, our good or bad\nbehaviour depends on ourselves; we regard it the highest wisdom in the\ngovernment of the world to ordain for the first, opportunity, and for\nboth, their consequence, in accordance with moral laws. In the latter\nproperly consists the glory of God, which is hence not unsuitably\ndescribed by theologians as the ultimate purpose of creation.-- It\nis further to be remarked that when we use the word creation, we\nunderstand nothing more than we have said here, viz. the cause of the\n_being_ of the world or of the things in it (substances). This is\nwhat the concept properly belonging to this word involves (_actuatio\nsubstantiae est creatio_); and consequently there is not implied in it\nthe supposition of a freely working, and therefore intelligent, cause\n(whose being we first of all want to prove).\n[134] [Note added in Second Edition.] This moral argument does not\nsupply any _objectively-valid_ proof of the Being of God; it does\nnot prove to the sceptic that there is a God, but proves that if he\nwishes to think in a way consonant with morality, he must admit the\n_assumption_ of this proposition under the maxims of his practical\nReason.-- We should therefore not say: it is necessary _for morals_\n[Sittlichkeit], to assume the happiness of all rational beings of the\nworld in proportion to their morality [Moralit\u00e4t]; but rather, this\nis necessitated _by_ morality. Accordingly, this is a _subjective_\nargument sufficient for moral beings.\n[135] [Second Edition.]\n[136] [Second Edition.]\n[137] In a practical sense that religion is always idolatry which\nconceives the Supreme Being with properties, according to which\nsomething else besides morality can be a fit condition for that which\nman can do being in accordance with His Will. For however pure and\nfree from sensible images the concept that we have formed may be in a\ntheoretical point of view, yet it will be in a practical point of view\nstill represented as an _idol_, _i.e._ in regard to the character of\nHis Will, anthropomorphically.\n[138] [Cf. _Introd. to Logic_, ix. p. 63, \u201cConviction is opposed to\nPersuasion, which is a belief from inadequate reasons, of which we do\nnot know whether they are only subjective or are also objective.\u201d]\n[139] [Second Edition.]\n[140] [_I.e._ _Urtheils_. First Edition had _Urtheilens_, the judging\nsubject.]\n[141] _Analogy_ (in a qualitative signification) is the identity of\nthe relation between reasons and consequences (causes and effects), so\nfar as it is to be found, notwithstanding the specific difference of\nthe things or those properties in them which contain the reason for\nlike consequences (_i.e._ considered apart from this relation). Thus we\nconceive of the artificial constructions of beasts by comparing them\nwith those of men; by comparing the ground of those effects brought\nabout by the former, which we do not know, with the ground of similar\neffects brought about by men (reason), which we do know; _i.e._ we\nregard the ground of the former as an analogon of reason. We then try\nat the same time to show that the ground of the artisan faculty of\nbeasts, which we call instinct, specifically different as it is in fact\nfrom reason, has yet a similar relation to its effect (the buildings of\nthe beaver as compared with those of men).--But then I cannot therefore\nconclude that because man uses _reason_ for his building, the beaver\nmust have the like, and call this a _conclusion_ according to analogy.\nBut from the similarity of the mode of operation of beasts (of which\nwe cannot immediately perceive the ground) to that of men (of which we\nare immediately conscious), we can quite rightly conclude _according\nto analogy_, that beasts too act in accordance with _representations_\n(not as _Descartes_ has it, that they are machines), and that despite\ntheir specific distinction they are yet (as living beings) of the same\ngenus as man. The principle of our right so to conclude consists in\nthe sameness of the ground for reckoning beasts in respect of the said\ndetermination in the same genus with men, regarded as men, so far as we\ncan externally compare them with one another in accordance with their\nactions. There is _par ratio_. Just so I can conceive, according to the\nanalogy of an Understanding, the causality of the supreme World-Cause,\nby comparing its purposive products in the world with the artificial\nworks of men; but I cannot conclude according to analogy to those\nproperties in it [which are in man], because here the principle of the\npossibility of such a method of reasoning entirely fails, viz. the\n_paritas rationis_ for counting the Supreme Being in one and the same\ngenus with man (in respect of the causality of both). The causality\nof the beings of the world, which is always sensibly conditioned (as\nis causality through Understanding) cannot be transferred to a Being\nwhich has in common with them no generic concept save that of Thing in\ngeneral.\n[142] We thus miss nothing in the representation of the relations of\nthis Being to the world, as far as the consequences, theoretical or\npractical, of this concept are concerned. To wish to investigate what\nit is in itself, is a curiosity as purposeless as it is vain.\n[143] [Cf. _Introd. to Logic_, p. 76, where the conditions of a\nlegitimate hypothesis are laid down. See also _Critique of Pure\nReason_, Methodology, c. i. \u00a7 3.]\n[144] [This illustration is also given in the _Logic_ (p. 57);\nwhere the three _modi_ of belief, Opinion, Faith, and Knowledge,\nare distinguished from each other. Cf. _Critique of Pure Reason_,\nMethodology, c. ii. \u00a7 3.]\n[145] [The speculations of Swedenborg seem to have always had a strange\nfascination for Kant. He says of two reported cases of Swedenborg\u2019s\nclairvoyance that he knows not how to disprove them (Rosenkranz vii.\n5); but in his _Anthropology_ \u00a7\u00a7 35, 37, he attacks Swedenborgianism\nas folly. So in an early essay, _Dreams of a Visionary explained\nby Dreams of Metaphysics_, he avows his scepticism as to the value\nof the information which \u201cpsychical research\u201d can supply about the\nspirit-world, though he is careful not to commit himself to any\ndogmatic statement on the subject of ghosts. In the _Critique of Pure\nReason_ (when discussing the Postulates of Empirical Thought) he\ngives, as an instance of a concept inconsistent with the canons of\npossibility, \u201ca power of being in a community of thought with other\nmen, however distant from us.\u201d]\n[146] [Cf. _supra_, p. 229.]\n[147] I here extend, correctly as it seems to me, the concept of a\nthing of fact beyond the usual signification of this word. For it is\nnot needful, not even feasible, to limit this expression merely to\nactual experience, if we are talking of the relation of things to\nour cognitive faculties; for an experience merely possible is quite\nsufficient in order that we may speak of them merely as objects of a\ndefinite kind of cognition.\n[148] [Cf. _introduction to Logic_, p. 59 note.]\n[149] [Second Edition.]\n[150] Things of faith are not therefore _articles of faith_; if we\nunderstand by the latter things of faith to the _confession_ of which\n(internal or external) we can be bound. Natural theology contains\nnothing like this. For since they, as things of faith (like things of\nfact) cannot be based on theoretical proofs, [they are accepted by]\na belief which is free and which only as such is compatible with the\nmorality of the subject.\n[151] The final purpose which the moral law enjoins upon us to further,\nis not the ground of duty; since this lies in the moral law, which,\nas formal practical principle, leads categorically, independently\nof the Objects of the faculty of desire (the material of the will)\nand consequently of any purpose whatever. This formal characteristic\nof my actions (their subordination under the principle of universal\nvalidity), wherein alone consists their inner moral worth, is quite\nin our power; and I can quite well abstract from the possibility or\nthe unattainableness of purposes which I am obliged to promote in\nconformity with that law (because in them consists only the external\nworth of my actions) as something which is never completely in my\npower, in order only to look to that which is of my doing. But then\nthe design of promoting the final purpose of all rational beings\n(happiness so far as it is possible for it to be accordant with duty)\nis even yet prescribed by the law of duty. The speculative Reason,\nhowever, does not see at all the attainableness of this (neither on\nthe side of our own physical faculty nor on that of the co-operation\nof nature). It must rather, so far as we can judge in a rational way,\nhold the derivation, by the aid of such causes, of such a consequence\nof our good conduct from mere nature (internal and external) without\nGod and immortality, to be an ungrounded and vain, though well-meant,\nexpectation; and if it could have complete certainty of this judgement,\nit would regard the moral law itself as the mere deception of our\nReason in a practical aspect. But since the speculative Reason fully\nconvinces itself that the latter can never take place, but that on the\nother hand those Ideas whose object lies outside nature can be thought\nwithout contradiction, it must for its own practical law and the\nproblem prescribed thereby, and therefore in a moral aspect, recognise\nthose Ideas as real in order not to come into contradiction with itself.\n[152] It is a trust in the promise of the moral law; [not however such\nas is contained in it, but such as I put into it and that on morally\nadequate grounds.[153] For a final purpose cannot be commanded by any\nlaw of Reason without this latter at the same time promising, however\nuncertainly, its attainableness; and thus justifying our belief in\nthe special conditions under which alone our Reason can think it as\nattainable. The word _fides_ expresses this; and it can only appear\ndoubtful, how this expression and this particular Idea came into moral\nphilosophy, since it first was introduced with Christianity, and the\nadoption of it perhaps might seem to be only a flattering imitation\nof Christian terminology. But this is not the only case in which this\nwonderful religion with its great simplicity of statement has enriched\nphilosophy with far more definite and purer concepts of morality, than\nit had been able to furnish before; but which, once they are there, are\n_freely_ assented to by Reason and are assumed as concepts to which\nit could well have come of itself and which it could and should have\nintroduced.]\n[153] [Second Edition.]\n[154] [Cf. _Introd. to Logic_, ix. p. 60, \u201cThat man is morally\n_unbelieving_ who does not accept that which though _impossible_ to\nknow is _morally necessary_ to suppose.\u201d]\n[155] [First Edition.]\n[156] [In the _Critique of Pure Reason_, Dialectic, bk.

{"text": "Of the Idea of a Critique of Practical Reason.\nThe theoretical use of reason was concerned with objects of the\ncognitive faculty only, and a critical examination of it with\nreference to this use applied properly only to the pure faculty of\ncognition; because this raised the suspicion, which was afterwards\nconfirmed, that it might easily pass beyond its limits, and be lost\namong unattainable objects, or even contradictory notions. It is quite\ndifferent with the practical use of reason. In this, reason is\nconcerned with the grounds of determination of the will, which is a\nfaculty either to produce objects corresponding to ideas, or to\ndetermine ourselves to the effecting of such objects (whether the\nphysical power is sufficient or not); that is, to determine our\ncausality. For here, reason can at least attain so far as to determine\nthe will, and has always objective reality in so far as it is the\nvolition only that is in question. The first question here then is\nwhether pure reason of itself alone suffices to determine the will, or\nwhether it can be a ground of determination only as dependent on\nempirical conditions. Now, here there comes in a notion of causality\njustified by the critique of the pure reason, although not capable\nof being presented empirically, viz., that of freedom; and if we can\nnow discover means of proving that this property does in fact belong\nto the human will (and so to the will of all rational beings), then it\nwill not only be shown that pure reason can be practical, but that\nit alone, and not reason empirically limited, is indubitably\npractical; consequently, we shall have to make a critical examination,\nnot of pure practical reason, but only of practical reason\ngenerally. For when once pure reason is shown to exist, it needs no\ncritical examination. For reason itself contains the standard for\nthe critical examination of every use of it. The critique, then, of\npractical reason generally is bound to prevent the empirically\nconditioned reason from claiming exclusively to furnish the ground\nof determination of the will. If it is proved that there is a\n[practical] reason, its employment is alone immanent; the\nempirically conditioned use, which claims supremacy, is on the\ncontrary transcendent and expresses itself in demands and precepts\nwhich go quite beyond its sphere. This is just the opposite of what\nmight be said of pure reason in its speculative employment.\nHowever, as it is still pure reason, the knowledge of which is\nhere the foundation of its practical employment, the general outline\nof the classification of a critique of practical reason must be\narranged in accordance with that of the speculative. We must, then,\nhave the Elements and the Methodology of it; and in the former an\nAnalytic as the rule of truth, and a Dialectic as the exposition and\ndissolution of the illusion in the judgements of practical reason. But\nthe order in the subdivision of the Analytic will be the reverse of\nthat in the critique of the pure speculative reason. For, in the\npresent case, we shall commence with the principles and proceed to the\nconcepts, and only then, if possible, to the senses; whereas in the\ncase of the speculative reason we began with the senses and had to end\nwith the principles. The reason of this lies again in this: that now\nwe have to do with a will, and have to consider reason, not in its\nrelation to objects, but to this will and its causality. We must,\nthen, begin with the principles of a causality not empirically\nconditioned, after which the attempt can be made to establish our\nnotions of the determining grounds of such a will, of their\napplication to objects, and finally to the subject and its sense\nfaculty. We necessarily begin with the law of causality from\nfreedom, that is, with a pure practical principle, and this determines\nthe objects to which alone it can be applied.\nBOOK_1|CHAPTER_1\nFIRST PART.\nELEMENTS OF PURE PRACTICAL REASON.\nBOOK I. The Analytic of Pure Practical Reason.\nCHAPTER I. Of the Principles of Pure Practical Reason.\n{BOOK_1|CHAPTER_1 ^paragraph 5}\nI. DEFINITION.\nPractical principles are propositions which contain a general\ndetermination of the will, having under it several practical rules.\nThey are subjective, or maxims, when the condition is regarded by\nthe subject as valid only for his own will, but are objective, or\npractical laws, when the condition is recognized as objective, that\nis, valid for the will of every rational being.\n{BOOK_1|CHAPTER_1 ^paragraph 10}\nREMARK.\nSupposing that pure reason contains in itself a practical motive,\nthat is, one adequate to determine the will, then there are\npractical laws; otherwise all practical principles will be mere\nmaxims. In case the will of a rational being is pathologically\naffected, there may occur a conflict of the maxims with the\npractical laws recognized by itself. For example, one may make it\nhis maxim to let no injury pass unrevenged, and yet he may see that\nthis is not a practical law, but only his own maxim; that, on the\ncontrary, regarded as being in one and the same maxim a rule for the\nwill of every rational being, it must contradict itself. In natural\nphilosophy the principles of what happens, (e.g., the principle of\nequality of action and reaction in the communication of motion) are at\nthe same time laws of nature; for the use of reason there is\ntheoretical and determined by the nature of the object. In practical\nphilosophy, i.e., that which has to do only with the grounds of\ndetermination of the will, the principles which a man makes for\nhimself are not laws by which one is inevitably bound; because\nreason in practical matters has to do with the subject, namely, with\nthe faculty of desire, the special character of which may occasion\nvariety in the rule. The practical rule is always a product of reason,\nbecause it prescribes action as a means to the effect. But in the case\nof a being with whom reason does not of itself determine the will,\nthis rule is an imperative, i.e., a rule characterized by \"shall,\"\nwhich expresses the objective necessitation of the action and\nsignifies that, if reason completely determined the will, the action\nwould inevitably take place according to this rule. Imperatives,\ntherefore, are objectively valid, and are quite distinct from\nmaxims, which are subjective principles. The former either determine\nthe conditions of the causality of the rational being as an\nefficient cause, i.e., merely in reference to the effect and the means\nof attaining it; or they determine the will only, whether it is\nadequate to the effect or not. The former would be hypothetical\nimperatives, and contain mere precepts of skill; the latter, on the\ncontrary, would be categorical, and would alone be practical laws.\nThus maxims are principles, but not imperatives. Imperatives\nthemselves, however, when they are conditional (i.e., do not determine\nthe will simply as will, but only in respect to a desired effect, that\nis, when they are hypothetical imperatives), are practical precepts\nbut not laws. Laws must be sufficient to determine the will as will,\neven before I ask whether I have power sufficient for a desired\neffect, or the means necessary to produce it; hence they are\ncategorical: otherwise they are not laws at all, because the necessity\nis wanting, which, if it is to be practical, must be independent of\nconditions which are pathological and are therefore only\ncontingently connected with the will. Tell a man, for example, that he\nmust be industrious and thrifty in youth, in order that he may not\nwant in old age; this is a correct and important practical precept\nof the will. But it is easy to see that in this case the will is\ndirected to something else which it is presupposed that it desires;\nand as to this desire, we must leave it to the actor himself whether\nhe looks forward to other resources than those of his own acquisition,\nor does not expect to be old, or thinks that in case of future\nnecessity he will be able to make shift with little. Reason, from\nwhich alone can spring a rule involving necessity, does, indeed,\ngive necessity to this precept (else it would not be an imperative),\nbut this is a necessity dependent on subjective conditions, and cannot\nbe supposed in the same degree in all subjects. But that reason may\ngive laws it is necessary that it should only need to presuppose\nitself, because rules are objectively and universally valid only\nwhen they hold without any contingent subjective conditions, which\ndistinguish one rational being from another. Now tell a man that he\nshould never make a deceitful promise, this is a rule which only\nconcerns his will, whether the purposes he may have can be attained\nthereby or not; it is the volition only which is to be determined a\npriori by that rule. If now it is found that this rule is\npractically right, then it is a law, because it is a categorical\nimperative. Thus, practical laws refer to the will only, without\nconsidering what is attained by its causality, and we may disregard\nthis latter (as belonging to the world of sense) in order to have them\nquite pure.\nII. THEOREM I.\n{BOOK_1|CHAPTER_1 ^paragraph 15}\nAll practical principles which presuppose an object (matter) of\nthe faculty of desire as the ground of determination of the will are\nempirical and can furnish no practical laws.\nBy the matter of the faculty of desire I mean an object the\nrealization of which is desired. Now, if the desire for this object\nprecedes the practical rule and is the condition of our making it a\nprinciple, then I say (in the first place) this principle is in that\ncase wholly empirical, for then what determines the choice is the idea\nof an object and that relation of this idea to the subject by which\nits faculty of desire is determined to its realization. Such a\nrelation to the subject is called the pleasure in the realization of\nan object. This, then, must be presupposed as a condition of the\npossibility of determination of the will. But it is impossible to know\na priori of any idea of an object whether it will be connected with\npleasure or pain, or be indifferent. In such cases, therefore, the\ndetermining principle of the choice must be empirical and,\ntherefore, also the practical material principle which presupposes\nit as a condition.\nIn the second place, since susceptibility to a pleasure or pain\ncan be known only empirically and cannot hold in the same degree for\nall rational beings, a principle which is based on this subjective\ncondition may serve indeed as a maxim for the subject which\npossesses this susceptibility, but not as a law even to him (because\nit is wanting in objective necessity, which must be recognized a\npriori); it follows, therefore, that such a principle can never\nfurnish a practical law.\n{BOOK_1|CHAPTER_1 ^paragraph 20}\nIII. THEOREM II.\nAll material practical principles as such are of one and the same\nkind and come under the general principle of self-love or private\nhappiness.\nPleasure arising from the idea of the idea of the existence of a\nthing, in so far as it is to determine the desire of this thing, is\nfounded on the susceptibility of the subject, since it depends on\nthe presence of an object; hence it belongs to sense (feeling), and\nnot to understanding, which expresses a relation of the idea to an\nobject according to concepts, not to the subject according to\nfeelings. It is, then, practical only in so far as the faculty of\ndesire is determined by the sensation of agreeableness which the\nsubject expects from the actual existence of the object. Now, a\nrational being's consciousness of the pleasantness of life\nuninterruptedly accompanying his whole existence is happiness; and the\nprinciple which makes this the supreme ground of determination of\nthe will is the principle of self-love. All material principles, then,\nwhich place the determining ground of the will in the pleasure or pain\nto be received from the existence of any object are all of the same\nkind, inasmuch as they all belong to the principle of self-love or\nprivate happiness.\n{BOOK_1|CHAPTER_1 ^paragraph 25}\nCOROLLARY.\nAll material practical rules place the determining principle of\nthe will in the lower desires; and if there were no purely formal laws\nof the will adequate to determine it, then we could not admit any\nhigher desire at all.\nREMARK I.\n{BOOK_1|CHAPTER_1 ^paragraph 30}\nIt is surprising that men, otherwise acute, can think it possible to\ndistinguish between higher and lower desires, according as the ideas\nwhich are connected with the feeling of pleasure have their origin\nin the senses or in the understanding; for when we inquire what are\nthe determining grounds of desire, and place them in some expected\npleasantness, it is of no consequence whence the idea of this pleasing\nobject is derived, but only how much it pleases. Whether an idea has\nits seat and source in the understanding or not, if it can only\ndetermine the choice by presupposing a feeling of pleasure in the\nsubject, it follows that its capability of determining the choice\ndepends altogether on the nature of the inner sense, namely, that this\ncan be agreeably affected by it. However dissimilar ideas of objects\nmay be, though they be ideas of the understanding, or even of the\nreason in contrast to ideas of sense, yet the feeling of pleasure,\nby means of which they constitute the determining principle of the\nwill (the expected satisfaction which impels the activity to the\nproduction of the object), is of one and the same kind, not only\ninasmuch as it can only be known empirically, but also inasmuch as\nit affects one and the same vital force which manifests itself in\nthe faculty of desire, and in this respect can only differ in degree\nfrom every other ground of determination. Otherwise, how could we\ncompare in respect of magnitude two principles of determination, the\nideas of which depend upon different faculties, so as to prefer that\nwhich affects the faculty of desire in the highest degree. The same\nman may return unread an instructive book which he cannot again\nobtain, in order not to miss a hunt; he may depart in the midst of a\nfine speech, in order not to be late for dinner; he may leave a\nrational conversation, such as he otherwise values highly, to take his\nplace at the gaming-table; he may even repulse a poor man whom he at\nother times takes pleasure in benefiting, because he has only just\nenough money in his pocket to pay for his admission to the theatre. If\nthe determination of his will rests on the feeling of the\nagreeableness or disagreeableness that he expects from any cause, it\nis all the same to him by what sort of ideas he will be affected.\nThe only thing that concerns him, in order to decide his choice, is,\nhow great, how long continued, how easily obtained, and how often\nrepeated, this agreeableness is. Just as to the man who wants money to\nspend, it is all the same whether the gold was dug out of the mountain\nor washed out of the sand, provided it is everywhere accepted at the\nsame value; so the man who cares only for the enjoyment of life does\nnot ask whether the ideas are of the understanding or the senses,\nbut only how much and how great pleasure they will give for the\nlongest time. It is only those that would gladly deny to pure reason\nthe power of determining the will, without the presupposition of any\nfeeling, who could deviate so far from their own exposition as to\ndescribe as quite heterogeneous what they have themselves previously\nbrought under one and the same principle. Thus, for example, it is\nobserved that we can find pleasure in the mere exercise of power, in\nthe consciousness of our strength of mind in overcoming obstacles\nwhich are opposed to our designs, in the culture of our mental\ntalents, etc.; and we justly call these more refined pleasures and\nenjoyments, because they are more in our power than others; they do\nnot wear out, but rather increase the capacity for further enjoyment\nof them, and while they delight they at the same time cultivate. But\nto say on this account that they determine the will in a different way\nand not through sense, whereas the possibility of the pleasure\npresupposes a feeling for it implanted in us, which is the first\ncondition of this satisfaction; this is just as when ignorant\npersons that like to dabble in metaphysics imagine matter so subtle,\nso supersubtle that they almost make themselves giddy with it, and\nthen think that in this way they have conceived it as a spiritual\nand yet extended being. If with Epicurus we make virtue determine\nthe will only by means of the pleasure it promises, we cannot\nafterwards blame him for holding that this pleasure is of the same\nkind as those of the coarsest senses. For we have no reason whatever\nto charge him with holding that the ideas by which this feeling is\nexcited in us belong merely to the bodily senses. As far as can be\nconjectured, he sought the source of many of them in the use of the\nhigher cognitive faculty, but this did not prevent him, and could\nnot prevent him, from holding on the principle above stated, that\nthe pleasure itself which those intellectual ideas give us, and by\nwhich alone they can determine the will, is just of the same kind.\nConsistency is the highest obligation of a philosopher, and yet the\nmost rarely found. The ancient Greek schools give us more examples\nof it than we find in our syncretistic age, in which a certain shallow\nand dishonest system of compromise of contradictory principles is\ndevised, because it commends itself better to a public which is\ncontent to know something of everything and nothing thoroughly, so\nas to please every party.\nThe principle of private happiness, however much understanding and\nreason may be used in it, cannot contain any other determining\nprinciples for the will than those which belong to the lower\ndesires; and either there are no [higher] desires at all, or pure\nreason must of itself alone be practical; that is, it must be able\nto determine the will by the mere form of the practical rule without\nsupposing any feeling, and consequently without any idea of the\npleasant or unpleasant, which is the matter of the desire, and which\nis always an empirical condition of the principles. Then only, when\nreason of itself determines the will (not as the servant of the\ninclination), it is really a higher desire to which that which is\npathologically determined is subordinate, and is really, and even\nspecifically, distinct from the latter, so that even the slightest\nadmixture of the motives of the latter impairs its strength and\nsuperiority; just as in a mathematical demonstration the least\nempirical condition would degrade and destroy its force and value.\nReason, with its practical law, determines the will immediately, not\nby means of an intervening feeling of pleasure or pain, not even of\npleasure in the law itself, and it is only because it can, as pure\nreason, be practical, that it is possible for it to be legislative.\nREMARK II.\n{BOOK_1|CHAPTER_1 ^paragraph 35}\nTo be happy is necessarily the wish of every finite rational\nbeing, and this, therefore, is inevitably a determining principle of\nits faculty of desire. For we are not in possession originally of\nsatisfaction with our whole existence- a bliss which would imply a\nconsciousness of our own independent self-sufficiency this is a\nproblem imposed upon us by our own finite nature, because we have\nwants and these wants regard the matter of our desires, that is,\nsomething that is relative to a subjective feeling of pleasure or\npain, which determines what we need in order to be satisfied with\nour condition. But just because this material principle of\ndetermination can only be empirically known by the subject, it is\nimpossible to regard this problem as a law; for a law being\nobjective must contain the very same principle of determination of the\nwill in all cases and for all rational beings. For, although the\nnotion of happiness is in every case the foundation of practical\nrelation of the objects to the desires, yet it is only a general\nname for the subjective determining principles, and determines nothing\nspecifically; whereas this is what alone we are concerned with in this\npractical problem, which cannot be solved at all without such specific\ndetermination. For it is every man's own special feeling of pleasure\nand pain that decides in what he is to place his happiness, and even\nin the same subject this will vary with the difference of his wants\naccording as this feeling changes, and thus a law which is\nsubjectively necessary (as a law of nature) is objectively a very\ncontingent practical principle, which can and must be very different\nin different subjects and therefore can never furnish a law; since, in\nthe desire for happiness it is not the form (of conformity to law)\nthat is decisive, but simply the matter, namely, whether I am to\nexpect pleasure in following the law, and how much. Principles of\nself-love may, indeed, contain universal precepts of skill (how to\nfind means to accomplish one's purpose), but in that case they are\nmerely theoretical principles; * as, for example, how he who would\nlike to eat bread should contrive a mill; but practical precepts\nfounded on them can never be universal, for the determining principle\nof the desire is based on the feeling pleasure and pain, which can\nnever be supposed to be universally directed to the same objects.\n* Propositions which in mathematics or physics are called practical\nought properly to be called technical. For they have nothing to do\nwith the determination of the will; they only point out how a certain\neffect is to be produced and are, therefore, just as theoretical as\nany propositions which express the connection of a cause with an\neffect. Now whoever chooses the effect must also choose the cause.\n{BOOK_1|CHAPTER_1 ^paragraph 40}\nEven supposing, however, that all finite rational beings were\nthoroughly agreed as to what were the objects of their feelings of\npleasure and pain, and also as to the means which they must employ\nto attain the one and avoid the other; still, they could by no means\nset up the principle of self-love as a practical law, for this\nunanimity itself would be only contingent. The principle of\ndetermination would still be only subjectively valid and merely\nempirical, and would not possess the necessity which is conceived in\nevery law, namely, an objective necessity arising from a priori\ngrounds; unless, indeed, we hold this necessity to be not at all\npractical, but merely physical, viz., that our action is as inevitably\ndetermined by our inclination, as yawning when we see others yawn.\nIt would be better to maintain that there are no practical laws at\nall, but only counsels for the service of our desires, than to raise\nmerely subjective principles to the rank of practical laws, which have\nobjective necessity, and not merely subjective, and which must be\nknown by reason a priori, not by experience (however empirically\nuniversal this may be). Even the rules of corresponding phenomena\nare only called laws of nature (e.g., the mechanical laws), when we\neither know them really a priori, or (as in the case of chemical laws)\nsuppose that they would be known a priori from objective grounds if\nour insight reached further. But in the case of merely subjective\npractical principles, it is expressly made a condition that they rest,\nnot on objective, but on subjective conditions of choice, and hence\nthat they must always be represented as mere maxims, never as\npractical laws. This second remark seems at first sight to be mere\nverbal refinement, but it defines the terms of the most important\ndistinction which can come into consideration in practical\ninvestigations.\nIV. THEOREM II.\nA rational being cannot regard his maxims as practical universal\nlaws, unless he conceives them as principles which determine the will,\nnot by their matter, but by their form only.\n{BOOK_1|CHAPTER_1 ^paragraph 45}\nBy the matter of a practical principle I mean the object of the\nwill. This object is either the determining ground of the will or it\nis not. In the former case the rule of the will is subjected to an\nempirical condition (viz., the relation of the determining idea to the\nfeeling of pleasure and pain), consequently it can not be a\npractical law. Now, when we abstract from a law all matter, i.e.,\nevery object of the will (as a determining principle), nothing is left\nbut the mere form of a universal legislation. Therefore, either a\nrational being cannot conceive his subjective practical principles,\nthat is, his maxims, as being at the same time universal laws, or he\nmust suppose that their mere form, by which they are fitted for\nuniversal legislation, is alone what makes them practical laws.\nREMARK.\nThe commonest understanding can distinguish without instruction what\nform of maxim is adapted for universal legislation, and what is not.\nSuppose, for example, that I have made it my maxim to increase my\nfortune by every safe means. Now, I have a deposit in my hands, the\nowner of which is dead and has left no writing about it. This is\njust the case for my maxim. I desire then to know whether that maxim\ncan also bold good as a universal practical law. I apply it,\ntherefore, to the present case, and ask whether it could take the form\nof a law, and consequently whether I can by my maxim at the same\ntime give such a law as this, that everyone may deny a deposit of\nwhich no one can produce a proof. I at once become aware that such a\nprinciple, viewed as a law, would annihilate itself, because the\nresult would be that there would be no deposits. A practical law which\nI recognise as such must be qualified for universal legislation;\nthis is an identical proposition and, therefore, self-evident. Now, if\nI say that my will is subject to a practical law, I cannot adduce my\ninclination (e.g., in the present case my avarice) as a principle of\ndetermination fitted to be a universal practical law; for this is so\nfar from being fitted for a universal legislation that, if put in\nthe form of a universal law, it would destroy itself.\n{BOOK_1|CHAPTER_1 ^paragraph 50}\nIt is, therefore, surprising that intelligent men could have thought\nof calling the desire of happiness a universal practical law on the\nground that the desire is universal, and, therefore, also the maxim by\nwhich everyone makes this desire determine his will. For whereas in\nother cases a universal law of nature makes everything harmonious;\nhere, on the contrary, if we attribute to the maxim the universality\nof a law, the extreme opposite of harmony will follow, the greatest\nopposition and the complete destruction of the maxim itself and its\npurpose. For, in that case, the will of all has not one and the same\nobject, but everyone has his own (his private welfare), which may\naccidentally accord with the purposes of others which are equally\nselfish, but it is far from sufficing for a law; because the\noccasional exceptions which one is permitted to make are endless,\nand cannot be definitely embraced in one universal rule. In this\nmanner, then, results a harmony like that which a certain satirical\npoem depicts as existing between a married couple bent on going to\nruin, \"O, marvellous harmony, what he wishes, she wishes also\"; or\nlike what is said of the pledge of Francis I to the Emperor Charles V,\n\"What my brother Charles wishes that I wish also\" (viz., Milan).\nEmpirical principles of determination are not fit for any universal\nexternal legislation, but just as little for internal; for each man\nmakes his own subject the foundation of his inclination, and in the\nsame subject sometimes one inclination, sometimes another, has the\npreponderance. To discover a law which would govern them all under\nthis condition, namely, bringing them all into harmony, is quite\nimpossible.\nV. PROBLEM I.\nSupposing that the mere legislative form of maxims is alone the\nsufficient determining principle of a will, to find the nature of\nthe will which can be determined by it alone.\n{BOOK_1|CHAPTER_1 ^paragraph 55}\nSince the bare form of the law can only be conceived by reason, and\nis, therefore, not an object of the senses, and consequently does\nnot belong to the class of phenomena, it follows that the idea of\nit, which determines the will, is distinct from all the principles\nthat determine events in nature according to the law of causality,\nbecause in their case the determining principles must themselves be\nphenomena. Now, if no other determining principle can serve as a law\nfor the will except that universal legislative form, such a will\nmust be conceived as quite independent of the natural law of phenomena\nin their mutual relation, namely, the law of causality; such\nindependence is called freedom in the strictest, that is, in the\ntranscendental, sense; consequently, a will which can have its law\nin nothing but the mere legislative form of the maxim is a free will.\nVI. PROBLEM II.\nSupposing that a will is free, to find the law which alone is\ncompetent to determine it necessarily.\n{BOOK_1|CHAPTER_1 ^paragraph 60}\nSince the matter of the practical law, i.e., an object of the maxim,\ncan never be given otherwise than empirically, and the free will is\nindependent on empirical conditions (that is, conditions belonging\nto the world of sense) and yet is determinable, consequently a free\nwill must find its principle of determination in the law, and yet\nindependently of the matter of the law. But, besides the matter of the\nlaw, nothing is contained in it except the legislative form. It is the\nlegislative form, then, contained in the maxim, which can alone\nconstitute a principle of determination of the [free] will.\nREMARK.\nThus freedom and an unconditional practical law reciprocally imply\neach other. Now I do not ask here whether they are in fact distinct,\nor whether an unconditioned law is not rather merely the consciousness\nof a pure practical reason and the latter identical with the\npositive concept of freedom; I only ask, whence begins our knowledge\nof the unconditionally practical, whether it is from freedom or from\nthe practical law? Now it cannot begin from freedom, for of this we\ncannot be immediately conscious, since the first concept of it is\nnegative; nor can we infer it from experience, for experience gives us\nthe knowledge only of the law of phenomena, and hence of the mechanism\nof nature, the direct opposite of freedom. It is therefore the moral\nlaw, of which we become directly conscious (as soon as we trace for\nourselves maxims of the will), that first presents itself to us, and\nleads directly to the concept of freedom, inasmuch as reason\npresents it as a principle of determination not to be outweighed by\nany sensible conditions, nay, wholly independent of them. But how is\nthe consciousness, of that moral law possible? We can become conscious\nof pure practical laws just as we are conscious of pure theoretical\nprinciples, by attending to the necessity with which reason prescribes\nthem and to the elimination of all empirical conditions, which it\ndirects. The concept of a pure will arises out of the former, as\nthat of a pure understanding arises out of the latter. That this is\nthe true subordination of our concepts, and that it is morality that\nfirst discovers to us the notion of freedom, hence that it is\npractical reason which, with this concept, first proposes to\nspeculative reason the most insoluble problem, thereby placing it in\nthe greatest perplexity, is evident from the following\nconsideration: Since nothing in phenomena can be explained by the\nconcept of freedom, but the mechanism of nature must constitute the\nonly clue; moreover, when pure reason tries to ascend in the series of\ncauses to the unconditioned, it falls into an antinomy which is\nentangled in incomprehensibilities on the one side as much as the\nother; whilst the latter (namely, mechanism) is at least useful in the\nexplanation of phenomena, therefore no one would ever have been so\nrash as to introduce freedom into science, had not the moral law,\nand with it practical reason, come in and forced this notion upon\nus. Experience, however, confirms this order of notions. Suppose\nsome one asserts of his lustful appetite that, when the desired object\nand the opportunity are present, it is quite irresistible. [Ask\nhim]- if a gallows were erected before the house where he finds this\nopportunity, in order that he should be hanged thereon immediately\nafter the gratification of his lust, whether he could not then control\nhis passion; we need not be long in doubt what he would reply. Ask\nhim, however- if his sovereign ordered him, on pain of the same\nimmediate execution, to bear false witness against an honourable\nman, whom the prince might wish to destroy under a plausible\npretext, would he consider it possible in that case to overcome his\nlove of life, however great it may be. He would perhaps not venture to\naffirm whether he would do so or not, but he must unhesitatingly admit\nthat it is possible to do so. He judges, therefore, that he can do a\ncertain thing because he is conscious that he ought, and he recognizes\nthat he is free- a fact which but for the moral law he would never\nhave known.\n{BOOK_1|CHAPTER_1 ^paragraph 65}\nVII. FUNDAMENTAL LAW OF THE PURE PRACTICAL REASON.\nAct so that the maxim of thy will can always at the same time hold\ngood as a principle of universal legislation.\n{BOOK_1|CHAPTER_1 ^paragraph 70}\nREMARK.\nPure geometry has postulates which are practical propositions, but\ncontain nothing further than the assumption that we can do something\nif it is required that we should do it, and these are the only\ngeometrical propositions that concern actual existence. They are,\nthen, practical rules under a problematical condition of the will; but\nhere the rule says: We absolutely must proceed in a certain manner.\nThe practical rule is, therefore, unconditional, and hence it is\nconceived a priori as a categorically practical proposition by which\nthe will is objectively determined absolutely and immediately (by\nthe practical rule itself, which thus is in this case a law); for pure\nreason practical of itself is here directly legislative. The will is\nthought as independent on empirical conditions, and, therefore, as\npure will determined by the mere form of the law, and this principle\nof determination is regarded as the supreme condition of all maxims.\nThe thing is strange enough, and has no parallel in all the rest of\nour practical knowledge. For the a priori thought of a possible\nuniversal legislation which is therefore merely problematical, is\nunconditionally commanded as a law without borrowing anything from\nexperience or from any external will. This, however, is not a\nprecept to do something by which some desired effect can be attained\n(for then the will would depend on physical conditions), but a rule\nthat determines the will a priori only so far as regards the forms\nof its maxims; and thus it is at least not impossible to conceive that\na law, which only applies to the subjective form of principles, yet\nserves as a principle of determination by means of the objective\nform of law in general. We may call the consciousness of this\nfundamental law a fact of reason, because we cannot reason it out from\nantecedent data of reason, e.g., the consciousness of freedom (for\nthis is not antecedently given), but it forces itself on us as a\nsynthetic a priori proposition, which is not based on any intuition,\neither pure or empirical. It would, indeed, be analytical if the\nfreedom of the will were presupposed, but to presuppose freedom as a\npositive concept would require an intellectual intuition, which cannot\nhere be assumed; however, when we regard this law as given, it must be\nobserved, in order not to fall into any misconception, that it is\nnot an empirical fact, but the sole fact of the pure reason, which\nthereby announces itself as originally legislative (sic volo, sic\njubeo).\nCOROLLARY.\n{BOOK_1|CHAPTER_1 ^paragraph 75}\nPure reason is practical of itself alone and gives (to man) a\nuniversal law which we call the moral law.\nREMARK.\n{BOOK_1|CHAPTER_1 ^paragraph 80}\nThe fact just mentioned is undeniable. It is only necessary to\nanalyse the judgement that men pass on the lawfulness of their\nactions, in order to find that, whatever inclination may say to the\ncontrary, reason, incorruptible and self-constrained, always\nconfronts the maxim of the will in any action with the pure will, that\nis, with itself, considering itself as a priori practical. Now this\nprinciple of morality, just on account of the universality of the\nlegislation which makes it the formal supreme determining principle of\nthe will, without regard to any subjective differences, is declared by\nthe reason to be a law for all rational beings, in so far as they have\na will, that is, a power to determine their causality by the\nconception of rules; and, therefore, so far as they are capable of\nacting according to principles, and consequently also according to\npractical a priori principles (for these alone have the necessity that\nreason requires in a principle). It is, therefore, not limited to\nmen only, but applies to all finite beings that possess reason and\nwill; nay, it even includes the Infinite Being as the supreme\nintelligence. In the former case, however, the law has the form of\nan imperative, because in them, as rational beings, we can suppose a\npure will, but being creatures affected with wants and physical\nmotives, not a holy will, that is, one which would be incapable of any\nmaxim conflicting with the moral law. In their case, therefore, the\nmoral law is an imperative, which commands categorically, because\nthe law is unconditioned; the relation of such a will to this law is\ndependence under the name of obligation, which implies a constraint to\nan action, though only by reason and its objective law; and this\naction is called duty, because an elective will, subject to\npathological affections (though not determined by them, and,\ntherefore, still free), implies a wish that arises from subjective\ncauses and, therefore, may often be opposed to the pure objective\ndetermining principle; whence it requires the moral constraint of a\nresistance of the practical reason, which may be called an internal,\nbut intellectual, compulsion. In the supreme intelligence the elective\nwill is rightly conceived as incapable of any maxim which could not at\nthe same time be objectively a law; and the notion of holiness,\nwhich on that account belongs to it, places it, not indeed above all\npractical laws, but above all practically restrictive laws, and\nconsequently above obligation and duty. This holiness of will is,\nhowever, a practical idea, which must necessarily serve as a type to\nwhich finite rational beings can only approximate indefinitely, and\nwhich the pure moral law, which is itself on this account called holy,\nconstantly and rightly holds before their eyes. The utmost that finite\npractical reason can effect is to be certain of this indefinite\nprogress of one's maxims and of their steady disposition to advance.\nThis is virtue, and virtue, at least as a naturally acquired\nfaculty, can never be perfect, because assurance in such a case\nnever becomes apodeictic certainty and, when it only amounts to\npersuasion, is very dangerous.\nVIII. THEOREM IV.\nThe autonomy of the will is the sole principle of all moral laws and\nof all duties which conform to them; on the other hand, heteronomy\nof the elective will not only cannot be the basis of any obligation,\nbut is, on the contrary, opposed to the principle thereof and to the\nmorality of the will.\n{BOOK_1|CHAPTER_1 ^paragraph 85}\nIn fact the sole principle of morality consists in the\nindependence on all matter of the law (namely, a desired object),\nand in the determination of the elective will by the mere universal\nlegislative form of which its maxim must be capable. Now this\nindependence is freedom in the negative sense, and this\nself-legislation of the pure, and therefore practical, reason is\nfreedom in the positive sense. Thus the moral law expresses nothing\nelse than the autonomy of the pure practical reason; that is, freedom;\nand this is itself the formal condition of all maxims, and on this\ncondition only can they agree with the supreme practical law. If\ntherefore the matter of the volition, which can be nothing else than\nthe object of a desire that is connected with the law, enters into the\npractical law, as the condition of its possibility, there results\nheteronomy of the elective will, namely, dependence on the physical\nlaw that we should follow some impulse or inclination. In that case\nthe will does not give itself the law, but only the precept how\nrationally to follow pathological law; and the maxim which, in such\na case, never contains the universally legislative form, not only\nproduces no obligation, but is itself opposed to the principle of a\npure practical reason and, therefore, also to the moral disposition,\neven though the resulting action may be conformable to the law.\nREMARK.\nHence a practical precept, which contains a material (and\ntherefore empirical) condition, must never be reckoned a practical\nlaw. For the law of the pure will, which is free, brings the will into\na sphere quite different from the empirical; and as the necessity\ninvolved in the law is not a physical necessity, it can only consist\nin the formal conditions of the possibility of a law in general. All\nthe matter of practical rules rests on subjective conditions, which\ngive them only a conditional universality (in case I desire this or\nthat, what I must do in order to obtain it), and they all turn on\nthe principle of private happiness. Now, it is indeed undeniable\nthat every volition must have an object, and therefore a matter; but\nit does not follow that this is the determining principle and the\ncondition of the maxim; for, if it is so, then this cannot be\nexhibited in a universally legislative form, since in that case the\nexpectation of the existence of the object would be the determining\ncause of the choice, and the volition must presuppose the dependence\nof the faculty of desire on the existence of something; but this\ndependence can only be sought in empirical conditions and,\ntherefore, can never furnish a foundation for a necessary and\nuniversal rule. Thus, the happiness of others may be the object of the\nwill of a rational being. But if it were the determining principle\nof the maxim, we must assume that we find not only a rational\nsatisfaction in the welfare of others, but also a want such as the\nsympathetic disposition in some men occasions. But I cannot assume the\nexistence of this want in every rational being (not at all in God).\nThe matter, then, of the maxim may remain, but it must not be the\ncondition of it, else the maxim could not be fit for a law. Hence, the\nmere form of law, which limits the matter, must also be a reason for\nadding this matter to the will, not for presupposing it. For\nexample, let the matter be my own happiness. This (rule), if I\nattribute it to everyone (as, in fact, I may, in the case of every\nfinite being), can become an objective practical law only if I include\nthe happiness of others. Therefore, the law that we should promote the\nhappiness of others does not arise from the assumption that this is an\nobject of everyone's choice, but merely from this, that the form of\nuniversality which reason requires as the condition of giving to a\nmaxim of self-love the objective validity of a law is the principle\nthat determines the will. Therefore it was not the object (the\nhappiness of others) that determined the pure will, but it was the\nform of law only, by which I restricted my maxim, founded on\ninclination, so as to give it the universality of a law, and thus to\nadapt it to the practical reason; and it is this restriction alone,\nand not the addition of an external spring, that can give rise to\nthe notion of the obligation to extend the maxim of my self-love to\nthe happiness of others.\n{BOOK_1|CHAPTER_1 ^paragraph 90}\nREMARK II.\nThe direct opposite of the principle of morality is, when the\nprinciple of private happiness is made the determining principle of\nthe will, and with this is to be reckoned, as I have shown above,\neverything that places the determining principle which is to serve\nas a law, anywhere but in the legislative form of the maxim. This\ncontradiction, however, is not merely logical, like that which would\narise between rules empirically conditioned, if they were raised to\nthe rank of necessary principles of cognition, but is practical, and\nwould ruin morality altogether were not the voice of reason in\nreference to the will so clear, so irrepressible, so distinctly\naudible, even to the commonest men. It can only, indeed, be maintained\nin the perplexing speculations of the schools, which are bold enough\nto shut their ears against that heavenly voice, in order to support\na theory that costs no trouble.\nSuppose that an acquaintance whom you otherwise liked were to\nattempt to justify himself to you for having borne false witness,\nfirst by alleging the, in his view, sacred duty of consulting his\nown happiness; then by enumerating the advantages which he had\ngained thereby, pointing out the prudence he had shown in securing\nhimself against detection, even by yourself, to whom he now reveals\nthe secret, only in order that he may be able to deny it at any\ntime; and suppose he were then to affirm, in all seriousness, that\nhe has fulfilled a true human duty; you would either laugh in his\nface, or shrink back from him with disgust; and yet, if a man has\nregulated his principles of action solely with a view to his own\nadvantage, you would have nothing whatever to object against this mode\nof proceeding. Or suppose some one recommends you a man as steward, as\na man to whom you can blindly trust all your affairs; and, in order to\ninspire you with confidence, extols him as a prudent man who\nthoroughly understands his own interest, and is so indefatigably\nactive that he lets slip no opportunity of advancing it; lastly,\nlest you should be afraid of finding a vulgar selfishness in him,\npraises the good taste with which he lives; not seeking his pleasure\nin money-making, or in coarse wantonness, but in the enlargement of\nhis knowledge, in instructive intercourse with a select circle, and\neven in relieving the needy; while as to the means (which, of\ncourse, derive all their value from the end), he is not particular,\nand is ready to use other people's money for the purpose as if it were\nhis own, provided only he knows that he can do so safely, and\nwithout discovery; you would either believe that the recommender was\nmocking you, or that he had lost his senses. So sharply and clearly\nmarked are the boundaries of morality and self-love that even the\ncommonest eye cannot fail to distinguish whether a thing belongs to\nthe one or the other. The few remarks that follow may appear\nsuperfluous where the truth is so plain, but at least they may serve\nto give a little more distinctness to the judgement of common sense.\n{BOOK_1|CHAPTER_1 ^paragraph 95}\nThe principle of happiness may, indeed, furnish maxims, but never\nsuch as would be competent to be laws of the will, even if universal\nhappiness were made the object. For since the knowledge of this\nrests on mere empirical data, since every man's judgement on it\ndepends very much on his particular point of view, which is itself\nmoreover very variable, it can supply only general rules, not\nuniversal; that is, it can give rules which on the average will most\nfrequently fit, but not rules which must hold good always and\nnecessarily; hence, no practical laws can be founded on it. Just\nbecause in this case an object of choice is the foundation of the rule\nand must therefore precede it, the rule can refer to nothing but\nwhat is [felt], and therefore it refers to experience and is founded\non it, and then the variety of judgement must be endless. This\nprinciple, therefore, does not prescribe the same practical rules to\nall rational beings, although the rules are all included under a\ncommon title, namely, that of happiness. The moral law, however, is\nconceived as objectively necessary, only because it holds for everyone\nthat has reason and will.\nThe maxim of self-love (prudence) only advises; the law of\nmorality commands. Now there is a great difference between that\nwhich we are advised to do and that to which we are obliged.\nThe commonest intelligence can easily and without hesitation see\nwhat, on the principle of autonomy of the will, requires to be done;\nbut on supposition of heteronomy of the will, it is hard and\nrequires knowledge of the world to see what is to be done. That is\nto say, what duty is, is plain of itself to everyone; but what is to\nbring true durable advantage, such as will extend to the whole of\none's existence, is always veiled in impenetrable obscurity; and\nmuch prudence is required to adapt the practical rule founded on it to\nthe ends of life, even tolerably, by making proper exceptions. But the\nmoral law commands the most punctual obedience from everyone; it must,\ntherefore, not be so difficult to judge what it requires to be done,\nthat the commonest unpractised understanding, even without worldly\nprudence, should fail to apply it rightly.\nIt is always in everyone's power to satisfy the categorical\ncommand of morality; whereas it is seldom possible, and by no means so\nto everyone, to satisfy the empirically conditioned precept of\nhappiness, even with regard to a single purpose. The reason is that in\nthe former case there is question only of the maxim, which must be\ngenuine and pure; but in the latter case there is question also of\none's capacity and physical power to realize a desired object. A\ncommand that everyone should try to make himself happy would be\nfoolish, for one never commands anyone to do what he of himself\ninfallibly wishes to do. We must only command the means, or rather\nsupply them, since he cannot do everything that he wishes. But to\ncommand morality under the name of duty is quite rational; for, in the\nfirst place, not everyone is willing to obey its precepts if they\noppose his inclinations; and as to the means of obeying this law,\nthese need not in this case be taught, for in this respect whatever he\nwishes to do he can do.\nHe who has lost at play may be vexed at himself and his folly, but\nif he is conscious of having cheated at play (although he has gained\nthereby), he must despise himself as soon as he compares himself\nwith the moral law. This must, therefore, be something different\nfrom the principle of private happiness. For a man must have a\ndifferent criterion when he is compelled to say to himself: \"I am a\nworthless fellow, though I have filled my purse\"; and when he approves\nhimself, and says: \"I am a prudent man, for I have enriched my\ntreasure.\"\n{BOOK_1|CHAPTER_1 ^paragraph 100}\nFinally, there is something further in the idea of our practical\nreason, which accompanies the transgression of a moral law- namely,\nits ill desert. Now the notion of punishment, as such, cannot be\nunited with that of becoming a partaker of happiness; for although\nhe who inflicts the punishment may at the same time have the\nbenevolent purpose of directing this punishment to this end, yet it\nmust first be justified in itself as punishment, i.e., as mere harm,\nso that if it stopped there, and the person punished could get no\nglimpse of kindness hidden behind this harshness, he must yet admit\nthat justice was done him, and that his reward was perfectly\nsuitable to his conduct. In every punishment, as such, there must\nfirst be justice, and this constitutes the essence of the notion.\nBenevolence may, indeed, be united with it, but the man who has\ndeserved punishment has not the least reason to reckon upon this.\nPunishment, then, is a physical evil, which, though it be not\nconnected with moral evil as a natural consequence, ought to be\nconnected with it as a consequence by the principles of a moral\nlegislation. Now, if every crime, even without regarding the\nphysical consequence with respect to the actor, is in itself\npunishable, that is, forfeits happiness (at least partially), it is\nobviously absurd to say that the crime consisted just in this, that he\nhas drawn punishment on himself, thereby injuring his private\nhappiness (which, on the principle of self-love, must be the proper\nnotion of all crime). According to this view, the punishment would\nbe the reason for calling anything a crime, and justice would, on\nthe contrary, consist in omitting all punishment, and even\npreventing that which naturally follows; for, if this were done, there\nwould no longer be any evil in the action, since the harm which\notherwise followed it, and on account of which alone the action was\ncalled evil, would now be prevented. To look, however, on all\nrewards and punishments as merely the machinery in the hand of a\nhigher power, which is to serve only to set rational creatures\nstriving after their final end (happiness), this is to reduce the will\nto a mechanism destructive of freedom; this is so evident that it need\nnot detain us.\nMore refined, though equally false, is the theory of those who\nsuppose a certain special moral sense, which sense and not reason\ndetermines the moral law, and in consequence of which the\nconsciousness of virtue is supposed to be directly connected with\ncontentment and pleasure; that of vice, with mental dissatisfaction\nand pain; thus reducing the whole to the desire of private\nhappiness. Without repeating what has been said above, I will here\nonly remark the fallacy they fall into. In order to imagine the\nvicious man as tormented with mental dissatisfaction by the\nconsciousness of his transgressions, they must first represent him\nas in the main basis of his character, at least in some degree,\nmorally good; just as he who is pleased with the consciousness of\nright conduct must be conceived as already virtuous. The notion of\nmorality and duty must, therefore, have preceded any regard to this\nsatisfaction, and cannot be derived from it. A man must first\nappreciate the importance of what we call duty, the authority of the\nmoral law, and the immediate dignity which the following of it gives\nto the person in his own eyes, in order to feel that satisfaction in\nthe consciousness of his conformity to it and the bitter remorse\nthat accompanies the consciousness of its transgression. It is,\ntherefore, impossible to feel this satisfaction or dissatisfaction\nprior to the knowledge of obligation, or to make it the basis of the\nlatter. A man must be at least half honest in order even to be able to\nform a conception of these feelings. I do not deny that as the human\nwill is, by virtue of liberty, capable of being immediately determined\nby the moral law, so frequent practice in accordance with this\nprinciple of determination can, at least, produce subjectively a\nfeeling of satisfaction; on the contrary, it is a duty to establish\nand to cultivate this, which alone deserves to be called properly\nthe moral feeling; but the notion of duty cannot be derived from it,\nelse we should have to suppose a feeling for the law as such, and thus\nmake that an object of sensation which can only be thought by the\nreason; and this, if it is not to be a flat contradiction, would\ndestroy all notion of duty and put in its place a mere mechanical play\nof refined inclinations sometimes contending with the coarser.\nIf now we compare our formal supreme principle of pure practical\nreason (that of autonomy of the will) with all previous material\nprinciples of morality, we can exhibit them all in a table in which\nall possible cases are exhausted, except the one formal principle; and\nthus we can show visibly that it is vain to look for any other\nprinciple than that now proposed. In fact all possible principles of\ndetermination of the will are either merely subjective, and\ntherefore empirical, or are also objective and rational; and both\nare either external or internal.\nPractical Material Principles of Determination taken as the\nFoundation of Morality, are:\n{BOOK_1|CHAPTER_1 ^paragraph 105}\nSUBJECTIVE.\nEXTERNAL                 INTERNAL\nEducation                Physical feeling\n{BOOK_1|CHAPTER_1 ^paragraph 110}\n(Montaigne)              (Epicurus)\nThe civil                Moral feeling\nConstitution             (Hutcheson)\n(Mandeville)\n{BOOK_1|CHAPTER_1 ^paragraph 115}\nOBJECTIVE.\nINTERNAL                  EXTERNAL\nPerfection                Will of God\n(Wolf and the             (Crusius and other\n{BOOK_1|CHAPTER_1 ^paragraph 120}\nStoics)                   theological Moralists)\nThose of the upper table are all empirical and evidently incapable\nof furnishing the universal principle of morality; but those in the\nlower table are based on reason (for perfection as a quality of\nthings, and the highest perfection conceived as substance, that is,\nGod, can only be thought by means of rational concepts). But the\nformer notion, namely, that of perfection, may either be taken in a\ntheoretic signification, and then it means nothing but the\ncompleteness of each thing in its own kind (transcendental), or that\nof a thing merely as a thing (metaphysical); and with that we are\nnot concerned here. But the notion of perfection in a practical\nsense is the fitness or sufficiency of a thing for all sorts of\npurposes. This perfection, as a quality of man and consequently\ninternal, is nothing but talent and, what strengthens or completes\nthis, skill. Supreme perfection conceived as substance, that is God,\nand consequently external (considered practically), is the sufficiency\nof this being for all ends. Ends then must first be given,\nrelatively to which only can the notion of perfection (whether\ninternal in ourselves or external in God) be the determining principle\nof the will. But an end- being an object which must precede the\ndetermination of the will by a practical rule and contain the ground\nof the possibility of this determination, and therefore contain also\nthe matter of the will, taken as its determining principle- such an\nend is always empirical and, therefore, may serve for the Epicurean\nprinciple of the happiness theory, but not for the pure rational\nprinciple of morality and duty. Thus, talents and the improvement of\nthem, because they contribute to the advantages of life; or the will\nof God, if agreement with it be taken as the object of the will,\nwithout any antecedent independent practical principle, can be motives\nonly by reason of the happiness expected therefrom. Hence it\nfollows, first, that all the principles here stated are material;\nsecondly, that they include all possible material principles; and,\nfinally, the conclusion, that since material principles are quite\nincapable of furnishing the supreme moral law (as has been shown), the\nformal practical principle of the pure reason (according to which the\nmere form of a universal legislation must constitute the supreme and\nimmediate determining principle of the will) is the only one\npossible which is adequate to furnish categorical imperatives, that\nis, practical laws (which make actions a duty), and in general to\nserve as the principle of morality, both in criticizing conduct and\nalso in its application to the human will to determine it.\nI. Of the Deduction of the Fundamental Principles of Pure\nPractical Reason.\n{BOOK_1|CHAPTER_1 ^paragraph 125}\nThis Analytic shows that pure reason can be practical, that is,\ncan of itself determine the will independently of anything\nempirical; and this it proves by a fact in which pure reason in us\nproves itself actually practical, namely, the autonomy shown in the\nfundamental principle of morality, by which reason determines the will\nto action.\nIt shows at the same time that this fact is inseparably connected\nwith the consciousness of freedom of the will, nay, is identical\nwith it; and by this the will of a rational being, although as\nbelonging to the world of sense it recognizes itself as necessarily\nsubject to the laws of causality like other efficient causes; yet,\nat the same time, on another side, namely, as a being in itself, is\nconscious of existing in and being determined by an intelligible order\nof things; conscious not by virtue of a special intuition of itself,\nbut by virtue of certain dynamical laws which determine its\ncausality in the sensible world; for it has been elsewhere proved that\nif freedom is predicated of us, it transports us into an\nintelligible order of things.\nNow, if we compare with this the analytical part of the critique\nof pure speculative reason, we shall see a remarkable contrast.\nThere it was not fundamental principles, but pure, sensible\nintuition (space and time), that was the first datum that made a\npriori knowledge possible, though only of objects of the senses.\nSynthetical principles could not be derived from mere concepts without\nintuition; on the contrary, they could only exist with reference to\nthis intuition, and therefore to objects of possible experience, since\nit is the concepts of the understanding, united with this intuition,\nwhich alone make that knowledge possible which we call experience.\nBeyond objects of experience, and therefore with regard to things as\nnoumena, all positive knowledge was rightly disclaimed for speculative\nreason. This reason, however, went so far as to establish with\ncertainty the concept of noumena; that is, the possibility, nay, the\nnecessity, of thinking them; for example, it showed against all\nobjections that the supposition of freedom, negatively considered, was\nquite consistent with those principles and limitations of pure\ntheoretic reason. But it could not give us any definite enlargement of\nour knowledge with respect to such objects, but, on the contrary,\ncut off all view of them altogether.\nOn the other hand, the moral law, although it gives no view, yet\ngives us a fact absolutely inexplicable from any data of the\nsensible world, and the whole compass of our theoretical use of\nreason, a fact which points to a pure world of the understanding, nay,\neven defines it positively and enables us to know something of it,\nnamely, a law.\n{BOOK_1|CHAPTER_1 ^paragraph 130}\nThis law (as far as rational beings are concerned) gives to the\nworld of sense, which is a sensible system of nature, the form of a\nworld of the understanding, that is, of a supersensible system of\nnature, without interfering with its mechanism. Now, a system of\nnature, in the most general sense, is the existence of things under\nlaws. The sensible nature of rational beings in general is their\nexistence under laws empirically conditioned, which, from the point of\nview of reason, is heteronomy. The supersensible nature of the same\nbeings, on the other hand, is their existence according to laws\nwhich are independent of every empirical condition and, therefore,\nbelong to the autonomy of pure reason. And, since the laws by which\nthe existence of things depends on cognition are practical,\nsupersensible nature, so far as we can form any notion of it, is\nnothing else than a system of nature under the autonomy of pure\npractical reason. Now, the law of this autonomy is the moral law,\nwhich, therefore, is the fundamental law of a supersensible nature,\nand of a pure world of understanding, whose counterpart must exist\nin the world of sense, but without interfering with its laws. We might\ncall the former the archetypal world (natura archetypa), which we only\nknow in the reason; and the latter the ectypal world (natura\nectypa), because it contains the possible effect of the idea of the\nformer which is the determining principle of the will. For the moral\nlaw, in fact, transfers us ideally into a system in which pure reason,\nif it were accompanied with adequate physical power, would produce the\nsummum bonum, and it determines our will to give the sensible world\nthe form of a system of rational beings.\nThe least attention to oneself proves that this idea really serves\nas the model for the determinations of our will.\nWhen the maxim which I am disposed to follow in giving testimony\nis tested by the practical reason, I always consider what it would\nbe if it were to hold as a universal law of nature. It is manifest\nthat in this view it would oblige everyone to speak the truth. For\nit cannot hold as a universal law of nature that statements should\nbe allowed to have the force of proof and yet to be purposely\nuntrue. Similarly, the maxim which I adopt with respect to disposing\nfreely of my life is at once determined, when I ask myself what it\nshould be, in order that a system, of which it is the law, should\nmaintain itself. It is obvious that in such a system no one could\narbitrarily put an end to his own life, for such an arrangement\nwould not be a permanent order of things. And so in all similar cases.\nNow, in nature, as it actually is an object of experience, the free\nwill is not of itself determined to maxims which could of themselves\nbe the foundation of a natural system of universal laws, or which\ncould even be adapted to a system so constituted; on the contrary, its\nmaxims are private inclinations which constitute, indeed, a natural\nwhole in conformity with pathological (physical) laws, but could not\nform part of a system of nature, which would only be possible\nthrough our will acting in accordance with pure practical laws. Yet we\nare, through reason, conscious of a law to which all our maxims are\nsubject, as though a natural order must be originated from our will.\nThis law, therefore, must be the idea of a natural system not given in\nexperience, and yet possible through freedom; a system, therefore,\nwhich is supersensible, and to which we give objective reality, at\nleast in a practical point of view, since we look on it as an object\nof our will as pure rational beings.\nHence the distinction between the laws of a natural system to\nwhich the will is subject, and of a natural system which is subject to\na will (as far as its relation to its free actions is concerned),\nrests on this, that in the former the objects must be causes of the\nideas which determine the will; whereas in the latter the will is\nthe cause of the objects; so that its causality has its determining\nprinciple solely in the pure faculty of reason, which may therefore be\ncalled a pure practical reason.\nThere are therefore two very distinct problems: how, on the one\nside, pure reason can cognise objects a priori, and how on the other\nside it can be an immediate determining principle of the will, that\nis, of the causality of the rational being with respect to the reality\nof objects (through the mere thought of the universal validity of\nits own maxims as laws).\n{BOOK_1|CHAPTER_1 ^paragraph 135}\nThe former, which belongs to the critique of the pure speculative\nreason, requires a previous explanation, how intuitions without\nwhich no object can be given, and, therefore, none known\nsynthetically, are possible a priori; and its solution turns out to be\nthat these are all only sensible and, therefore, do not render\npossible any speculative knowledge which goes further than possible\nexperience reaches; and that therefore all the principles of that pure\nspeculative reason avail only to make experience possible; either\nexperience of given objects or of those that may be given ad\ninfinitum, but never are completely given.\nThe latter, which belongs to the critique of practical reason,\nrequires no explanation how the objects of the faculty of desire are\npossible, for that being a problem of the theoretical knowledge of\nnature is left to the critique of the speculative reason, but only how\nreason can determine the maxims of the will; whether this takes\nplace only by means of empirical ideas as principles of determination,\nor whether pure reason can be practical and be the law of a possible\norder of nature, which is not empirically knowable. The possibility of\nsuch a supersensible system of nature, the conception of which can\nalso be the ground of its reality through our own free will, does\nnot require any a priori intuition (of an intelligible world) which,\nbeing in this case supersensible, would be impossible for us. For\nthe question is only as to the determining principle of volition in\nits maxims, namely, whether it is empirical, or is a conception of the\npure reason (having the legal character belonging to it in general),\nand how it can be the latter. It is left to the theoretic principles\nof reason to decide whether the causality of the will suffices for the\nrealization of the objects or not, this being an inquiry into the\npossibility of the objects of the volition. Intuition of these objects\nis therefore of no importance to the practical problem. We are here\nconcerned only with the determination of the will and the\ndetermining principles of its maxims as a free will, not at all with\nthe result. For, provided only that the will conforms to the law of\npure reason, then let its power in execution be what it may, whether\naccording to these maxims of legislation of a possible system of\nnature any such system really results or not, this is no concern of\nthe critique, which only inquires whether, and in what way, pure\nreason can be practical, that is directly determine the will.\nIn this inquiry criticism may and must begin with pure practical\nlaws and their reality. But instead of intuition it takes as their\nfoundation the conception of their existence in the intelligible\nworld, namely, the concept of freedom. For this concept has no other\nmeaning, and these laws are only possible in relation to freedom of\nthe will; but freedom being supposed, they are necessary; or\nconversely freedom is necessary because those laws are necessary,\nbeing practical postulates. It cannot be further explained how this\nconsciousness of the moral law, or, what is the same thing, of\nfreedom, is possible; but that it is admissible is well established in\nthe theoretical critique.\nThe exposition of the supreme principle of practical reason is now\nfinished; that is to say, it has been shown first, what it\ncontains, that it subsists for itself quite a priori and independent\nof empirical principles; and next in what it is distinguished from all\nother practical principles. With the deduction, that is, the\njustification of its objective and universal validity, and the\ndiscernment of the possibility of such a synthetical proposition a\npriori, we cannot expect to succeed so well as in the case of the\nprinciples of pure theoretical reason. For these referred to objects\nof possible experience, namely, to phenomena, and we could prove\nthat these phenomena could be known as objects of experience only by\nbeing brought under the categories in accordance with these laws;\nand consequently that all possible experience must conform to these\nlaws. But I could not proceed in this way with the deduction of the\nmoral law. For this does not concern the knowledge of the properties\nof objects, which may be given to the reason from some other source;\nbut a knowledge which can itself be the ground of the existence of the\nobjects, and by which reason in a rational being has causality,\ni.e., pure reason, which can be regarded as a faculty immediately\ndetermining the will.\nNow all our human insight is at an end as soon as we have arrived at\nfundamental powers or faculties, for the possibility of these cannot\nbe understood by any means, and just as little should it be\narbitrarily invented and assumed. Therefore, in the theoretic use of\nreason, it is experience alone that can justify us in assuming them.\nBut this expedient of adducing empirical proofs, instead of a\ndeduction from a priori sources of knowledge, is denied us here in\nrespect to the pure practical faculty of reason. For whatever requires\nto draw the proof of its reality from experience must depend for the\ngrounds of its possibility on principles of experience; and pure,\nyet practical, reason by its very notion cannot be regarded as such.\nFurther, the moral law is given as a fact of pure reason of which we\nare a priori conscious, and which is apodeictically certain, though it\nbe granted that in experience no example of its exact fulfilment can\nbe found. Hence, the objective reality of the moral law cannot be\nproved by any deduction by any efforts of theoretical reason,\nwhether speculative or empirically supported, and therefore, even if\nwe renounced its apodeictic certainty, it could not be proved a\nposteriori by experience, and yet it is firmly established of itself.\n{BOOK_1|CHAPTER_1 ^paragraph 140}\nBut instead of this vainly sought deduction of the moral\nprinciple, something else is found which was quite unexpected, namely,\nthat this moral principle serves conversely as the principle of the\ndeduction of an inscrutable faculty which no experience could prove,\nbut of which speculative reason was compelled at least to assume the\npossibility (in order to find amongst its cosmological ideas the\nunconditioned in the chain of causality, so as not to contradict\nitself)- I mean the faculty of freedom. The moral law, which itself\ndoes not require a justification, proves not merely the possibility of\nfreedom, but that it really belongs to beings who recognize this law\nas binding on themselves. The moral law is in fact a law of the\ncausality of free agents and, therefore, of the possibility of a\nsupersensible system of nature, just as the metaphysical law of events\nin the world of sense was a law of causality of the sensible system of\nnature; and it therefore determines what speculative philosophy was\ncompelled to leave undetermined, namely, the law for a causality,\nthe concept of which in the latter was only negative; and therefore\nfor the first time gives this concept objective reality.\nThis sort of credential of the moral law, viz., that it is set forth\nas a principle of the deduction of freedom, which is a causality of\npure reason, is a sufficient substitute for all a priori\njustification, since theoretic reason was compelled to assume at least\nthe possibility of freedom, in order to satisfy a want of its own. For\nthe moral law proves its reality, so as even to satisfy the critique\nof the speculative reason, by the fact that it adds a positive\ndefinition to a causality previously conceived only negatively, the\npossibility of which was incomprehensible to speculative reason, which\nyet was compelled to suppose it. For it adds the notion of a reason\nthat directly determines the will (by imposing on its maxims the\ncondition of a universal legislative form); and thus it is able for\nthe first time to give objective, though only practical, reality to\nreason, which always became transcendent when it sought to proceed\nspeculatively with its ideas. It thus changes the transcendent use\nof reason into an immanent use (so that reason is itself, by means\nof ideas, an efficient cause in the field of experience).\nThe determination of the causality of beings in the world of\nsense, as such, can never be unconditioned; and yet for every series\nof conditions there must be something unconditioned, and therefore\nthere must be a causality which is determined wholly by itself. Hence,\nthe idea of freedom as a faculty of absolute spontaneity was not found\nto be a want but, as far as its possibility is concerned, an\nanalytic principle of pure speculative reason. But as it is absolutely\nimpossible to find in experience any example in accordance with this\nidea, because amongst the causes of things as phenomena it would be\nimpossible to meet with any absolutely unconditioned determination\nof causality, we were only able to defend our supposition that a\nfreely acting cause might be a being in the world of sense, in so\nfar as it is considered in the other point of view as a noumenon,\nshowing that there is no contradiction in regarding all its actions as\nsubject to physical conditions so far as they are phenomena, and yet\nregarding its causality as physically unconditioned, in so far as\nthe acting being belongs to the world of understanding, and in thus\nmaking the concept of freedom the regulative principle of reason. By\nthis principle I do not indeed learn what the object is to which\nthat sort of causality is attributed; but I remove the difficulty,\nfor, on the one side, in the explanation of events in the world, and\nconsequently also of the actions of rational beings, I leave to the\nmechanism of physical necessity the right of ascending from\nconditioned to condition ad infinitum, while on the other side I\nkeep open for speculative reason the place which for it is vacant,\nnamely, the intelligible, in order to transfer the unconditioned\nthither. But I was not able to verify this supposition; that is, to\nchange it into the knowledge of a being so acting, not even into the\nknowledge of the possibility of such a being. This vacant place is now\nfilled by pure practical reason with a definite law of causality in an\nintelligible world (causality with freedom), namely, the moral law.\nSpeculative reason does not hereby gain anything as regards its\ninsight, but only as regards the certainty of its problematical notion\nof freedom, which here obtains objective reality, which, though only\npractical, is nevertheless undoubted. Even the notion of causality-\nthe application, and consequently the signification, of which holds\nproperly only in relation to phenomena, so as to connect them into\nexperiences (as is shown by the Critique of Pure Reason)- is not so\nenlarged as to extend its use beyond these limits. For if reason\nsought to do this, it would have to show how the logical relation of\nprinciple and consequence can be used synthetically in a different\nsort of intuition from the sensible; that is how a causa noumenon is\npossible. This it can never do; and, as practical reason, it does\nnot even concern itself with it, since it only places the\ndetermining principle of causality of man as a sensible creature\n(which is given) in pure reason (which is therefore called practical);\nand therefore it employs the notion of cause, not in order to know\nobjects, but to determine causality in relation to objects in general.\nIt can abstract altogether from the application of this notion to\nobjects with a view to theoretical knowledge (since this concept is\nalways found a priori in the understanding even independently of any\nintuition). Reason, then, employs it only for a practical purpose, and\nhence we can transfer the determining principle of the will into the\nintelligible order of things, admitting, at the same time, that we\ncannot understand how the notion of cause can determine the\nknowledge of these things. But reason must cognise causality with\nrespect to the actions of the will in the sensible world in a definite\nmanner; otherwise, practical reason could not really produce any\naction. But as to the notion which it forms of its own causality as\nnoumenon, it need not determine it theoretically with a view to the\ncognition of its supersensible existence, so as to give it\nsignificance in this way. For it acquires significance apart from\nthis, though only for practical use, namely, through the moral law.\nTheoretically viewed, it remains always a pure a priori concept of the\nunderstanding, which can be applied to objects whether they have\nbeen given sensibly or not, although in the latter case it has no\ndefinite theoretical significance or application, but is only a\nformal, though essential, conception of the understanding relating\nto an object in general. The significance which reason gives it\nthrough the moral law is merely practical, inasmuch as the idea of\nthe law of causality (of the will) has self causality, or is\nits determining principle.\nII. Of the Right that Pure Reason in its Practical use has to an\nExtension which is not possible to it in its Speculative Use.\n{BOOK_1|CHAPTER_1 ^paragraph 145}\nWe have in the moral principle set forth a law of causality, the\ndetermining principle of which is set above all the conditions of\nthe sensible world; we have it conceived how the will, as belonging\nto the intelligible world, is determinable, and therefore have\nits subject (man) not merely conceived as belonging to a world of\npure understanding, and in this respect unknown (which the critique of\nspeculative reason enabled us to do), but also defined as regards\nhis causality by means of a law which cannot be reduced to any\nphysical law of the sensible world; and therefore our knowledge is\nextended beyond the limits of that world, a pretension which the\nCritique of Pure Reason declared to be futile in all speculation. Now,\nhow is the practical use of pure reason here to be reconciled with the\ntheoretical, as to the determination of the limits of its faculty?\nDavid Hume, of whom we may say that he commenced the assault on\nthe claims of pure reason, which made a thorough investigation of it\nnecessary, argued thus: The notion of cause is a notion that\ninvolves the necessity of the connexion of the existence of\ndifferent things (and that, in so far as they are different), so that,\ngiven A, I know that something quite distinct there from, namely B,\nmust necessarily also exist. Now necessity can be attributed to a\nconnection, only in so far as it is known a priori, for experience\nwould only enable us to know of such a connection that it exists,\nnot that it necessarily exists. Now, it is impossible, says he, to\nknow a priori and as necessary the connection between one thing and\nanother (or between one attribute and another quite distinct) when\nthey have not been given in experience. Therefore the notion of a\ncause is fictitious and delusive and, to speak in the mildest way,\nis an illusion, only excusable inasmuch as the custom (a subjective\nnecessity) of perceiving certain things, or their attributes as\noften associated in existence along with or in succession to one\nanother, is insensibly taken for an objective necessity of supposing\nsuch a connection in the objects themselves; and thus the notion of\na cause has been acquired surreptitiously and not legitimately; nay,\nit can never be so acquired or authenticated, since it demands a\nconnection in itself vain, chimerical, and untenable in presence of\nreason, and to which no object can ever correspond. In this way was\nempiricism first introduced as the sole source of principles, as far\nas all knowledge of the existence of things is concerned\n(mathematics therefore remaining excepted); and with empiricism the\nmost thorough scepticism, even with regard to the whole science of\nnature( as philosophy). For on such principles we can never conclude\nfrom given attributes of things as existing to a consequence (for this\nwould require the notion of cause, which involves the necessity of\nsuch a connection); we can only, guided by imagination, expect similar\ncases- an expectation which is never certain, however often it has\nbeen fulfilled. Of no event could we say: a certain thing must have\npreceded it, on which it necessarily followed; that is, it must have a\ncause; and therefore, however frequent the cases we have known in\nwhich there was such an antecedent, so that a rule could be derived\nfrom them, yet we never could suppose it as always and necessarily\nso happening; we should, therefore, be obliged to leave its share to\nblind chance, with which all use of reason comes to an end; and this\nfirmly establishes scepticism in reference to arguments ascending from\neffects to causes and makes it impregnable.\nMathematics escaped well, so far, because Hume thought that its\npropositions were analytical; that is, proceeded from one property\nto another, by virtue of identity and, consequently, according to\nthe principle of contradiction. This, however, is not the case, since,\non the contrary, they are synthetical; and although geometry, for\nexample, has not to do with the existence of things, but only with\ntheir a priori properties in a possible intuition, yet it proceeds\njust as in the case of the causal notion, from one property (A) to\nanother wholly distinct (B), as necessarily connected with the former.\nNevertheless, mathematical science, so highly vaunted for its\napodeictic certainty, must at last fall under this empiricism for\nthe same reason for which Hume put custom in the place of objective\nnecessity in the notion of cause and, in spite of all its pride,\nmust consent to lower its bold pretension of claiming assent a\npriori and depend for assent to the universality of its propositions\non the kindness of observers, who, when called as witnesses, would\nsurely not hesitate to admit that what the geometer propounds as a\ntheorem they have always perceived to be the fact, and,\nconsequently, although it be not necessarily true, yet they would\npermit us to expect it to be true in the future. In this manner Hume's\nempiricism leads inevitably to scepticism, even with regard to\nmathematics, and consequently in every scientific theoretical use of\nreason (for this belongs either to philosophy or mathematics). Whether\nwith such a terrible overthrow of the chief branches of knowledge,\ncommon reason will escape better, and will not rather become\nirrecoverably involved in this destruction of all knowledge, so that\nfrom the same principles a universal scepticism should follow\n(affecting, indeed, only the learned), this I will leave everyone to\njudge for himself.\nAs regards my own labours in the critical examination of pure\nreason, which were occasioned by Hume's sceptical teaching, but went\nmuch further and embraced the whole field of pure theoretical reason\nin its synthetic use and, consequently, the field of what is called\nmetaphysics in general; I proceeded in the following manner with\nrespect to the doubts raised by the Scottish philosopher touching\nthe notion of causality. If Hume took the objects of experience for\nthings in themselves (as is almost always done), he was quite right in\ndeclaring the notion of cause to be a deception and false illusion;\nfor as to things in themselves, and their attributes as such, it is\nimpossible to see why because A is given, B, which is different,\nmust necessarily be also given, and therefore he could by no means\nadmit such an a priori knowledge of things in themselves. Still less\ncould this acute writer allow an empirical origin of this concept,\nsince this is directly contradictory to the necessity of connection\nwhich constitutes the essence of the notion of causality, hence the\nnotion was proscribed, and in its place was put custom in the\nobservation of the course of perceptions.\n{BOOK_1|CHAPTER_1 ^paragraph 150}\nIt resulted, however, from my inquiries, that the objects with which\nwe have to do in experience are by no means things in themselves,\nbut merely phenomena; and that although in the case of things in\nthemselves it is impossible to see how, if A is supposed, it should be\ncontradictory that B, which is quite different from A, should not also\nbe supposed (i.e., to see the necessity of the connection between A as\ncause and B as effect); yet it can very well be conceived that, as\nphenomena, they may be necessarily connected in one experience in a\ncertain way (e.g., with regard to time-relations); so that they\ncould not be separated without contradicting that connection, by means\nof which this experience is possible in which they are objects and\nin which alone they are cognisable by us. And so it was found to be in\nfact; so that I was able not only to prove the objective reality of\nthe concept of cause in regard to objects of experience, but also to\ndeduce it as an a priori concept by reason of the necessity of the\nconnection it implied; that is, to show the possibility of its\norigin from pure understanding without any empirical sources; and\nthus, after removing the source of empiricism, I was able also to\noverthrow the inevitable consequence of this, namely, scepticism,\nfirst with regard to physical science, and then with regard to\nmathematics (in which empiricism has just the same grounds), both\nbeing sciences which have reference to objects of possible experience;\nherewith overthrowing the thorough doubt of whatever theoretic\nreason professes to discern.\nBut how is it with the application of this category of causality\n(and all the others; for without them there can be no knowledge of\nanything existing) to things which are not objects of possible\nexperience, but lie beyond its bounds? For I was able to deduce the\nobjective reality of these concepts only with regard to objects of\npossible experience. But even this very fact, that I have saved\nthem, only in case I have proved that objects may by means of them\nbe thought, though not determined a priori; this it is that gives them\na place in the pure understanding, by which they are referred to\nobjects in general (sensible or not sensible). If anything is still\nwanting, it is that which is the condition of the application of these\ncategories, and especially that of causality, to objects, namely,\nintuition; for where this is not given, the application with a view to\ntheoretic knowledge of the object, as a noumenon, is impossible and,\ntherefore, if anyone ventures on it, is (as in the Critique of Pure\nReason) absolutely forbidden. Still, the objective reality of the\nconcept (of causality) remains, and it can be used even of noumena,\nbut without our being able in the least to define the concept\ntheoretically so as to produce knowledge. For that this concept,\neven in reference to an object, contains nothing impossible, was shown\nby this, that, even while applied to objects of sense, its seat was\ncertainly fixed in the pure understanding; and although, when referred\nto things in themselves (which cannot be objects of experience), it is\nnot capable of being determined so as to represent a definite object\nfor the purpose of theoretic knowledge; yet for any other purpose (for\ninstance, a practical) it might be capable of being determined so as\nto have such application. This could not be the case if, as Hume\nmaintained, this concept of causality contained something absolutely\nimpossible to be thought.\nIn order now to discover this condition of the application of the\nsaid concept to noumena, we need only recall why we are not content\nwith its application to objects of experience, but desire also to\napply it to things in themselves. It will appear, then, that it is not\na theoretic but a practical purpose that makes this a necessity. In\nspeculation, even if we were successful in it, we should not really\ngain anything in the knowledge of nature, or generally with regard\nto such objects as are given, but we should make a wide step from\nthe sensibly conditioned (in which we have already enough to do to\nmaintain ourselves, and to follow carefully the chain of causes) to\nthe supersensible, in order to complete our knowledge of principles\nand to fix its limits; whereas there always remains an infinite\nchasm unfilled between those limits and what we know; and we should\nhave hearkened to a vain curiosity rather than a solid-desire of\nknowledge.\nBut, besides the relation in which the understanding stands to\nobjects (in theoretical knowledge), it has also a relation to the\nfaculty of desire, which is therefore called the will, and the pure\nwill, inasmuch as pure understanding (in this case called reason) is\npractical through the mere conception of a law. The objective\nreality of a pure will, or, what is the same thing, of a pure\npractical reason, is given in the moral law a priori, as it were, by a\nfact, for so we may name a determination of the will which is\ninevitable, although it does not rest on empirical principles. Now, in\nthe notion of a will the notion of causality is already contained, and\nhence the notion of a pure will contains that of a causality\naccompanied with freedom, that is, one which is not determinable by\nphysical laws, and consequently is not capable of any empirical\nintuition in proof of its reality, but, nevertheless, completely\njustifies its objective reality a priori in the pure practical law;\nnot, indeed (as is easily seen) for the purposes of the theoretical,\nbut of the practical use of reason. Now the notion of a being that has\nfree will is the notion of a causa noumenon, and that this notion\ninvolves no contradiction, we are already assured by the fact- that\ninasmuch as the concept of cause has arisen wholly from pure\nunderstanding, and has its objective reality assured by the deduction,\nas it is moreover in its origin independent of any sensible\nconditions, it is, therefore, not restricted to phenomena (unless we\nwanted to make a definite theoretic use of it), but can be applied\nequally to things that are objects of the pure understanding. But,\nsince this application cannot rest on any intuition (for intuition can\nonly be sensible), therefore, causa noumenon, as regards the theoretic\nuse of reason, although a possible and thinkable, is yet an empty\nnotion. Now, I do not desire by means of this to understand\ntheoretically the nature of a being, in so far as it has a pure\nwill; it is enough for me to have thereby designated it as such, and\nhence to combine the notion of causality with that of freedom (and\nwhat is inseparable from it, the moral law, as its determining\nprinciple). Now, this right I certainly have by virtue of the pure,\nnot-empirical origin of the notion of cause, since I do not consider\nmyself entitled to make any use of it except in reference to the moral\nlaw which determines its reality, that is, only a practical use.\nIf, with Hume, I had denied to the notion of causality all objective\nreality in its [theoretic] use, not merely with regard to things in\nthemselves (the supersensible), but also with regard to the objects of\nthe senses, it would have lost all significance, and being a\ntheoretically impossible notion would have been declared to be quite\nuseless; and since what is nothing cannot be made any use of, the\npractical use of a concept theoretically null would have been\nabsurd. But, as it is, the concept of a causality free from\nempirical conditions, although empty, i.e., without any appropriate\nintuition), is yet theoretically possible, and refers to an\nindeterminate object; but in compensation significance is given to\nit in the moral law and consequently in a practical sense. I have,\nindeed, no intuition which should determine its objective theoretic\nreality, but not the less it has a real application, which is\nexhibited in concreto in intentions or maxims; that is, it has a\npractical reality which can be specified, and this is sufficient to\njustify it even with a view to noumena.\n{BOOK_1|CHAPTER_1 ^paragraph 155}\nNow, this objective reality of a pure concept of the understanding\nin the sphere of the supersensible, once brought in, gives an\nobjective reality also to all the other categories, although only so\nfar as they stand in necessary connexion with the determining\nprinciple of the will (the moral law); a reality only of practical\napplication, which has not the least effect in enlarging our\ntheoretical knowledge of these objects, or the discernment of their\nnature by pure reason. So we shall find also in the sequel that\nthese categories refer only to beings as intelligences, and in them\nonly to the relation of reason to the will; consequently, always\nonly to the practical, and beyond this cannot pretend to any knowledge\nof these beings; and whatever other properties belonging to the\ntheoretical representation of supersensible things may be brought into\nconnexion with these categories, this is not to be reckoned as\nknowledge, but only as a right (in a practical point of view, however,\nit is a necessity) to admit and assume such beings, even in the case\nwhere we [conceive] supersensible beings (e.g., God) according to\nanalogy, that is, a purely rational relation, of which we make a\npractical use with reference to what is sensible; and thus the\napplication to the supersensible solely in a practical point of view\ndoes not give pure theoretic reason the least encouragement to run\nriot into the transcendent.\nBOOK_1|CHAPTER_2\nCHAPTER II. Of the Concept of an Object of Pure Practical Reason.\nBy a concept of the practical reason I understand the idea of an\nobject as an effect possible to be produced through freedom. To be\nan object of practical knowledge, as such, signifies, therefore,\nonly the relation of the will to the action by which the object or its\nopposite would be realized; and to decide whether something is an\nobject of pure practical reason or not is only to discern the\npossibility or impossibility of willing the action by which, if we had\nthe required power (about which experience must decide), a certain\nobject would be realized. If the object be taken as the determining\nprinciple of our desire, it must first be known whether it is\nphysically possible by the free use of our powers, before we decide\nwhether it is an object of practical reason or not. On the other hand,\nif the law can be considered a priori as the determining principle\nof the action, and the latter therefore as determined by pure\npractical reason, the judgement whether a thing is an object of pure\npractical reason or not does not depend at all on the comparison\nwith our physical power; and the question is only whether we should\nwill an action that is directed to the existence of an object, if\nthe object were in our power; hence the previous question is only as\nthe moral possibility of the action, for in this case it is not the\nobject, but the law of the will, that is the determining principle\nof the action. The only objects of practical reason are therefore\nthose of good and evil. For by the former is meant an object\nnecessarily desired according to a principle of reason; by the\nlatter one necessarily shunned, also according to a principle of\nreason.\nIf the notion of good is not to be derived from an antecedent\npractical law, but, on the contrary, is to serve as its foundation, it\ncan only be the notion of something whose existence promises pleasure,\nand thus determines the causality of the subject to produce it, that\nis to say, determines the faculty of desire. Now, since it is\nimpossible to discern a priori what idea will be accompanied with\npleasure and what with pain, it will depend on experience alone to\nfind out what is primarily good or evil. The property of the\nsubject, with reference to which alone this experiment can be made, is\nthe feeling of pleasure and pain, a receptivity belonging to the\ninternal sense; thus that only would be primarily good with which\nthe sensation of pleasure is immediately connected, and that simply\nevil which immediately excites pain. Since, however, this is opposed\neven to the usage of language, which distinguishes the pleasant from\nthe good, the unpleasant from the evil, and requires that good and\nevil shall always be judged by reason, and, therefore, by concepts\nwhich can be communicated to everyone, and not by mere sensation,\nwhich is limited to individual [subjects] and their susceptibility;\nand, since nevertheless, pleasure or pain cannot be connected with any\nidea of an object a priori, the philosopher who thought himself\nobliged to make a feeling of pleasure the foundation of his\npractical judgements would call that good which is a means to the\npleasant, and evil, what is a cause of unpleasantness and pain; for\nthe judgement on the relation of means to ends certainly belongs to\nreason. But, although reason is alone capable of discerning the\nconnexion of means with their ends (so that the will might even be\ndefined as the faculty of ends, since these are always determining\nprinciples of the desires), yet the practical maxims which would\nfollow from the aforesaid principle of the good being merely a\nmeans, would never contain as the object of the will anything good\nin itself, but only something good for something; the good would\nalways be merely the useful, and that for which it is useful must\nalways lie outside the will, in sensation. Now if this as a pleasant\nsensation were to be distinguished from the notion of good, then there\nwould be nothing primarily good at all, but the good would have to\nbe sought only in the means to something else, namely, some\npleasantness.\nIt is an old formula of the schools: Nihil appetimus nisi sub\nratione boni; Nihil aversamur nisi sub ratione mali, and it is used\noften correctly, but often also in a manner injurious to philosophy,\nbecause the expressions boni and mali are ambiguous, owing to the\npoverty of language, in consequence of which they admit a double\nsense, and, therefore, inevitably bring the practical laws into\nambiguity; and philosophy, which in employing them becomes aware of\nthe different meanings in the same word, but can find no special\nexpressions for them, is driven to subtile distinctions about which\nthere is subsequently no unanimity, because the distinction could\nnot be directly marked by any suitable expression. *\n* Besides this, the expression sub ratione boni is also ambiguous.\nFor it may mean: \"We represent something to ourselves as good, when\nand because we desire (will) it\"; or \"We desire something because we\nrepresent it to ourselves as good,\" so that either the desire\ndetermines the notion of the object as a good, or the notion of good\ndetermines the desire (the will); so that in the first case sub\nratione boni would mean, \"We will something under the idea of the\ngood\"; in the second, \"In consequence of this idea,\" which, as\ndetermining the volition, must precede it.\n{BOOK_1|CHAPTER_2 ^paragraph 5}\nThe German language has the good fortune to possess expressions\nwhich do not allow this difference to be overlooked. It possesses\ntwo very distinct concepts and especially distinct expressions for\nthat which the Latins express by a single word, bonum. For bonum it\nhas das Gute [good], and das Wohl [well, weal], for malum das Bose\n[evil], and das Ubel [ill, bad], or das Well [woe]. So that we express\ntwo quite distinct judgements when we consider in an action the good\nand evil of it, or our weal and woe (ill). Hence it already follows\nthat the above quoted psychological proposition is at least very\ndoubtful if it is translated: \"We desire nothing except with a view to\nour weal or woe\"; on the other hand, if we render it thus: \"Under\nthe direction of reason we desire nothing except so far as we esteem\nit good or evil,\" it is indubitably certain and at the same time quite\nclearly expressed.\nWell or ill always implies only a reference to our condition, as\npleasant or unpleasant, as one of pleasure or pain, and if we desire\nor avoid an object on this account, it is only so far as it is\nreferred to our sensibility and to the feeling of pleasure or pain\nthat it produces. But good or evil always implies a reference to the\nwill, as determined by the law of reason, to make something its\nobject; for it is never determined directly by the object and the idea\nof it, but is a faculty of taking a rule of reason for or motive of an\naction (by which an object may be realized). Good and evil therefore\nare properly referred to actions, not to the sensations of the person,\nand if anything is to be good or evil absolutely (i.e., in every\nrespect and without any further condition), or is to be so esteemed,\nit can only be the manner of acting, the maxim of the will, and\nconsequently the acting person himself as a good or evil man that\ncan be so called, and not a thing.\nHowever, then, men may laugh at the Stoic, who in the severest\nparoxysms of gout cried out: \"Pain, however thou tormentest me, I will\nnever admit that thou art an evil (kakov, malum)\": he was right. A bad\nthing it certainly was, and his cry betrayed that; but that any evil\nattached to him thereby, this he had no reason whatever to admit,\nfor pain did not in the least diminish the worth of his person, but\nonly that of his condition. If he had been conscious of a single\nlie, it would have lowered his pride, but pain served only to raise\nit, when he was conscious that he had not deserved it by any\nunrighteous action by which he had rendered himself worthy of\npunishment.\nWhat we call good must be an object of desire in the judgement of\nevery rational man, and evil an object of aversion in the eyes of\neveryone; therefore, in addition to sense, this judgement requires\nreason. So it is with truthfulness, as opposed to lying; so with\njustice, as opposed to violence, &c. But we may call a thing a bad [or\nill] thing, which yet everyone must at the same time acknowledge to be\ngood, sometimes directly, sometimes indirectly. The man who submits to\na surgical operation feels it no doubt as a bad thing, but by their\nreason he and everyone acknowledge it to be good. If a man who\ndelights in annoying and vexing peaceable people at last receives a\nright good beating, this is no doubt a bad thing; but everyone\napproves it and regards it as a good thing, even though nothing else\nresulted from it; nay, even the man who receives it must in his reason\nacknowledge that he has met justice, because he sees the proportion\nbetween good conduct and good fortune, which reason inevitably\nplaces before him, here put into practice.\n{BOOK_1|CHAPTER_2 ^paragraph 10}\nNo doubt our weal and woe are of very great importance in the\nestimation of our practical reason, and as far as our nature as\nsensible beings is concerned, our happiness is the only thing of\nconsequence, provided it is estimated as reason especially requires,\nnot by the transitory sensation, but by the influence that this has on\nour whole existence, and on our satisfaction therewith; but it is\nnot absolutely the only thing of consequence. Man is a being who, as\nbelonging to the world of sense, has wants, and so far his reason\nhas an office which it cannot refuse, namely, to attend to the\ninterest of his sensible nature, and to form practical maxims, even\nwith a view to the happiness of this life, and if possible even to\nthat of a future. But he is not so completely an animal as to be\nindifferent to what reason says on its own account, and to use it\nmerely as an instrument for the satisfaction of his wants as a\nsensible being. For the possession of reason would not raise his worth\nabove that of the brutes, if it is to serve him only for the same\npurpose that instinct serves in them; it would in that case be only\na particular method which nature had employed to equip man for the\nsame ends for which it has qualified brutes, without qualifying him\nfor any higher purpose. No doubt once this arrangement of nature has\nbeen made for him he requires reason in order to take into\nconsideration his weal and woe, but besides this he possesses it for a\nhigher purpose also, namely, not only to take into consideration\nwhat is good or evil in itself, about which only pure reason,\nuninfluenced by any sensible interest, can judge, but also to\ndistinguish this estimate thoroughly from the former and to make it\nthe supreme condition thereof.\nIn estimating what is good or evil in itself, as distinguished\nfrom what can be so called only relatively, the following points are\nto be considered. Either a rational principle is already conceived, as\nof itself the determining principle of the will, without regard to\npossible objects of desire (and therefore by the more legislative form\nof the maxim), and in that case that principle is a practical a priori\nlaw, and pure reason is supposed to be practical of itself. The law in\nthat case determines the will directly; the action conformed to it\nis good in itself; a will whose maxim always conforms to this law is\ngood absolutely in every respect and is the supreme condition of all\ngood. Or the maxim of the will is consequent on a determining\nprinciple of desire which presupposes an object of pleasure or pain,\nsomething therefore that pleases or displeases, and the maxim of\nreason that we should pursue the former and avoid the latter\ndetermines our actions as good relatively to our inclination, that is,\ngood indirectly, (i.e., relatively to a different end to which they are\nmeans), and in that case these maxims can never be called laws, but\nmay be called rational practical precepts. The end itself, the\npleasure that we seek, is in the latter case not a good but a welfare;\nnot a concept of reason, but an empirical concept of an object of\nsensation; but the use of the means thereto, that is, the action, is\nnevertheless called good (because rational deliberation is required\nfor it), not however, good absolutely, but only relatively to our\nsensuous nature, with regard to its feelings of pleasure and\ndispleasure; but the will whose maxim is affected thereby is not a\npure will; this is directed only to that in which pure reason by\nitself can be practical.\nThis is the proper place to explain the paradox of method in a\ncritique of practical reason, namely, that the concept of good and\nevil must not be determined before the moral law (of which it seems as\nif it must be the foundation), but only after it and by means of it.\nIn fact, even if we did not know that the principle of morality is a\npure a priori law determining the will, yet, that we may not assume\nprinciples quite gratuitously, we must, at least at first, leave it\nundecided, whether the will has merely empirical principles of\ndetermination, or whether it has not also pure a priori principles;\nfor it is contrary to all rules of philosophical method to assume as\ndecided that which is the very point in question. Supposing that we\nwished to begin with the concept of good, in order to deduce from it\nthe laws of the will, then this concept of an object (as a good) would\nat the same time assign to us this object as the sole determining\nprinciple of the will. Now, since this concept had not any practical a\npriori law for its standard, the criterion of good or evil could not\nbe placed in anything but the agreement of the object with our feeling\nof pleasure or pain; and the use of reason could only consist in\ndetermining in the first place this pleasure or pain in connexion with\nall the sensations of my existence, and in the second place the\nmeans of securing to myself the object of the pleasure. Now, as\nexperience alone can decide what conforms to the feeling of\npleasure, and by hypothesis the practical law is to be based on this\nas a condition, it follows that the possibility of a priori\npractical laws would be at once excluded, because it was imagined to\nbe necessary first of all to find an object the concept of which, as a\ngood, should constitute the universal though empirical principle of\ndetermination of the will. But what it was necessary to inquire\nfirst of all was whether there is not an a priori determining\nprinciple of the will (and this could never be found anywhere but in a\npure practical law, in so far as this law prescribes to maxims\nmerely their form without regard to an object). Since, however, we\nlaid the foundation of all practical law in an object determined by\nour conceptions of good and evil, whereas without a previous law\nthat object could not be conceived by empirical concepts, we have\ndeprived ourselves beforehand of the possibility of even conceiving\na pure practical law. On the other hand, if we had first\ninvestigated the latter analytically, we should have found that it\nis not the concept of good as an object that determines the moral\nlaw and makes it possible, but that, on the contrary, it is the\nmoral law that first determines the concept of good and makes it\npossible, so far as it deserves the name of good absolutely.\nThis remark, which only concerns the method of ultimate ethical\ninquiries, is of importance. It explains at once the occasion of all\nthe mistakes of philosophers with respect to the supreme principle\nof morals. For they sought for an object of the will which they\ncould make the matter and principle of a law (which consequently could\nnot determine the will directly, but by means of that object\nreferred to the feeling of pleasure or pain; whereas they ought\nfirst to have searched for a law that would determine the will a\npriori and directly, and afterwards determine the object in accordance\nwith the will). Now, whether they placed this object of pleasure,\nwhich was to supply the supreme conception of goodness, in\nhappiness, in perfection, in moral [feeling], or in the will of God,\ntheir principle in every case implied heteronomy, and they must\ninevitably come upon empirical conditions of a moral law, since\ntheir object, which was to be the immediate principle of the will,\ncould not be called good or bad except in its immediate relation to\nfeeling, which is always empirical. It is only a formal law- that\nis, one which prescribes to reason nothing more than the form of its\nuniversal legislation as the supreme condition of its maxims- that can\nbe a priori a determining principle of practical reason. The\nancients avowed this error without concealment by directing all\ntheir moral inquiries to the determination of the notion of the summum\nbonum, which they intended afterwards to make the determining\nprinciple of the will in the moral law; whereas it is only far\nlater, when the moral law has been first established for itself, and\nshown to be the direct determining principle of the will, that this\nobject can be presented to the will, whose form is now determined a\npriori; and this we shall undertake in the Dialectic of the pure\npractical reason. The moderns, with whom the question of the summum\nbonum has gone out of fashion, or at least seems to have become a\nsecondary matter, hide the same error under vague (expressions as in\nmany other cases). It shows itself, nevertheless, in their systems, as\nit always produces heteronomy of practical reason; and from this can\nnever be derived a moral law giving universal commands.\nNow, since the notions of good and evil, as consequences of the a\npriori determination of the will, imply also a pure practical\nprinciple, and therefore a causality of pure reason; hence they do not\noriginally refer to objects (so as to be, for instance, special\nmodes of the synthetic unity of the manifold of given intuitions in\none consciousness) like the pure concepts of the understanding or\ncategories of reason in its theoretic employment; on the contrary,\nthey presuppose that objects are given; but they are all modes\n(modi) of a single category, namely, that of causality, the\ndetermining principle of which consists in the rational conception\nof a law, which as a law of freedom reason gives to itself, thereby\na priori proving itself practical. However, as the actions on the\none side come under a law which is not a physical law, but a law of\nfreedom, and consequently belong to the conduct of beings in the world\nof intelligence, yet on the other side as events in the world of sense\nthey belong to phenomena; hence the determinations of a practical\nreason are only possible in reference to the latter and, therefore, in\naccordance with the categories of the understanding; not indeed with a\nview to any theoretic employment of it, i.e., so as to bring the\nmanifold of (sensible) intuition under one consciousness a priori; but\nonly to subject the manifold of desires to the unity of\nconsciousness of a practical reason, giving it commands in the moral\nlaw, i.e., to a pure will a priori.\n{BOOK_1|CHAPTER_2 ^paragraph 15}\nThese categories of freedom- for so we choose to call them in\ncontrast to those theoretic categories which are categories of\nphysical nature- have an obvious advantage over the latter, inasmuch\nas the latter are only forms of thought which designate objects in\nan indefinite manner by means of universal concept of every possible\nintuition; the former, on the contrary, refer to the determination\nof a free elective will (to which indeed no exactly corresponding\nintuition can be assigned, but which has as its foundation a pure\npractical a priori law, which is not the case with any concepts\nbelonging to the theoretic use of our cognitive faculties); hence,\ninstead of the form of intuition (space and time), which does not\nlie in reason itself, but has to be drawn from another source, namely,\nthe sensibility, these being elementary practical concepts have as\ntheir foundation the form of a pure will, which is given in reason\nand, therefore, in the thinking faculty itself. From this it happens\nthat as all precepts of pure practical reason have to do only with the\ndetermination of the will, not with the physical conditions (of\npractical ability) of the execution of one's purpose, the practical\na priori principles in relation to the supreme principle of freedom\nare at once cognitions, and have not to wait for intuitions in order\nto acquire significance, and that for this remarkable reason,\nbecause they themselves produce the reality of that to which they\nrefer (the intention of the will), which is not the case with\ntheoretical concepts. Only we must be careful to observe that these\ncategories only apply to the practical reason; and thus they proceed\nin order from those which are as yet subject to sensible conditions\nand morally indeterminate to those which are free from sensible\nconditions and determined merely by the moral law.\nTable of the Categories of Freedom relatively to the Notions of Good\nand Evil.\nI.

These can be established dogmatically only\nby the moral law.\nI add nothing further here in explanation of the present table,\nsince it is intelligible enough of itself. A division of this kind\nbased on principles is very useful in any science, both for the sake\nof thoroughness and intelligibility. Thus, for instance, we know\nfrom the preceding table and its first number what we must begin\nfrom in practical inquiries; namely, from the maxims which every one\nfounds on his own inclinations; the precepts which hold for a\nspecies of rational beings so far as they agree in certain\ninclinations; and finally the law which holds for all without regard\nto their inclinations, etc. In this way we survey the whole plan of\nwhat has to be done, every question of practical philosophy that has\nto be answered, and also the order that is to be followed.\nOf the Typic of the Pure Practical Judgement.\n{BOOK_1|CHAPTER_2 ^paragraph 45}\nIt is the notions of good and evil that first determine an object of\nthe will. They themselves, however, are subject to a practical rule of\nreason which, if it is pure reason, determines the will a priori\nrelatively to its object. Now, whether an action which is possible\nto us in the world of sense, comes under the rule or not, is a\nquestion to be decided by the practical judgement, by which what is\nsaid in the rule universally (in abstracto) is applied to an action in\nconcreto. But since a practical rule of pure reason in the first place\nas practical concerns the existence of an object, and in the second\nplace as a practical rule of pure reason implies necessity as\nregards the existence of the action and, therefore, is a practical\nlaw, not a physical law depending on empirical principles of\ndetermination, but a law of freedom by which the will is to be\ndetermined independently on anything empirical (merely by the\nconception of a law and its form), whereas all instances that can\noccur of possible actions can only be empirical, that is, belong to\nthe experience of physical nature; hence, it seems absurd to expect to\nfind in the world of sense a case which, while as such it depends only\non the law of nature, yet admits of the application to it of a law\nof freedom, and to which we can apply the supersensible idea of the\nmorally good which is to be exhibited in it in concreto. Thus, the\njudgement of the pure practical reason is subject to the same\ndifficulties as that of the pure theoretical reason. The latter,\nhowever, had means at hand of escaping from these difficulties,\nbecause, in regard to the theoretical employment, intuitions were\nrequired to which pure concepts of the understanding could be applied,\nand such intuitions (though only of objects of the senses) can be\ngiven a priori and, therefore, as far as regards the union of the\nmanifold in them, conforming to the pure a priori concepts of the\nunderstanding as schemata. On the other hand, the morally good is\nsomething whose object is supersensible; for which, therefore, nothing\ncorresponding can be found in any sensible intuition. Judgement\ndepending on laws of pure practical reason seems, therefore, to be\nsubject to special difficulties arising from this, that a law of\nfreedom is to be applied to actions, which are events taking place\nin the world of sense, and which, so far, belong to physical nature.\nBut here again is opened a favourable prospect for the pure\npractical judgement. When I subsume under a pure practical law an\naction possible to me in the world of sense, I am not concerned with\nthe possibility of the action as an event in the world of sense.\nThis is a matter that belongs to the decision of reason in its\ntheoretic use according to the law of causality, which is a pure\nconcept of the understanding, for which reason has a schema in the\nsensible intuition. Physical causality, or the condition under which\nit takes place, belongs to the physical concepts, the schema of\nwhich is sketched by transcendental imagination. Here, however, we\nhave to do, not with the schema of a case that occurs according to\nlaws, but with the schema of a law itself (if the word is allowable\nhere), since the fact that the will (not the action relatively to\nits effect) is determined by the law alone without any other\nprinciple, connects the notion of causality with quite different\nconditions from those which constitute physical connection.\nThe physical law being a law to which the objects of sensible\nintuition, as such, are subject, must have a schema corresponding to\nit- that is, a general procedure of the imagination (by which it\nexhibits a priori to the senses the pure concept of the\nunderstanding which the law determines). But the law of freedom\n(that is, of a causality not subject to sensible conditions), and\nconsequently the concept of the unconditionally good, cannot have\nany intuition, nor consequently any schema supplied to it for the\npurpose of its application in concreto. Consequently the moral law has\nno faculty but the understanding to aid its application to physical\nobjects (not the imagination); and the understanding for the\npurposes of the judgement can provide for an idea of the reason, not a\nschema of the sensibility, but a law, though only as to its form as\nlaw; such a law, however, as can be exhibited in concreto in objects\nof the senses, and therefore a law of nature. We can therefore call\nthis law the type of the moral law.\nThe rule of the judgement according to laws of pure practical reason\nis this: ask yourself whether, if the action you propose were to\ntake place by a law of the system of nature of which you were yourself\na part, you could regard it as possible by your own will. Everyone\ndoes, in fact, decide by this rule whether actions are morally good or\nevil. Thus, people say: \"If everyone permitted himself to deceive,\nwhen he thought it to his advantage; or thought himself justified in\nshortening his life as soon as he was thoroughly weary of it; or\nlooked with perfect indifference on the necessity of others; and if\nyou belonged to such an order of things, would you do so with the\nassent of your own will?\" Now everyone knows well that if he\nsecretly allows himself to deceive, it does not follow that everyone\nelse does so; or if, unobserved, he is destitute of compassion, others\nwould not necessarily be so to him; hence, this comparison of the\nmaxim of his actions with a universal law of nature is not the\ndetermining principle of his will. Such a law is, nevertheless, a type\nof the estimation of the maxim on moral principles. If the maxim of\nthe action is not such as to stand the test of the form of a universal\nlaw of nature, then it is morally impossible. This is the judgement\neven of common sense; for its ordinary judgements, even those of\nexperience, are always based on the law of nature. It has it therefore\nalways at hand, only that in cases where causality from freedom is\nto be criticised, it makes that law of nature only the type of a law\nof freedom, because, without something which it could use as an\nexample in a case of experience, it could not give the law of a pure\npractical reason its proper use in practice.\nIt is therefore allowable to use the system of the world of sense as\nthe type of a supersensible system of things, provided I do not\ntransfer to the latter the intuitions, and what depends on them, but\nmerely apply to it the form of law in general (the notion of which\noccurs even in the commonest use of reason, but cannot be definitely\nknown a priori for any other purpose than the pure practical use of\nreason); for laws, as such, are so far identical, no matter from\nwhat they derive their determining principles.\n{BOOK_1|CHAPTER_2 ^paragraph 50}\nFurther, since of all the supersensible absolutely nothing [is\nknown] except freedom (through the moral law), and this only so far as\nit is inseparably implied in that law, and moreover all\nsupersensible objects to which reason might lead us, following the\nguidance of that law, have still no reality for us, except for the\npurpose of that law, and for the use of mere practical reason; and\nas reason is authorized and even compelled to use physical nature\n(in its pure form as an object of the understanding) as the type of\nthe judgement; hence, the present remark will serve to guard against\nreckoning amongst concepts themselves that which belongs only to the\ntypic of concepts. This, namely, as a typic of the judgement, guards\nagainst the empiricism of practical reason, which founds the practical\nnotions of good and evil merely on experienced consequences (so-called\nhappiness). No doubt happiness and the infinite advantages which would\nresult from a will determined by self-love, if this will at the same\ntime erected itself into a universal law of nature, may certainly\nserve as a perfectly suitable type of the morally good, but it is\nnot identical with it. The same typic guards also against the\nmysticism of practical reason, which turns what served only as a\nsymbol into a schema, that is, proposes to provide for the moral\nconcepts actual intuitions, which, however, are not sensible\n(intuitions of an invisible Kingdom of God), and thus plunges into the\ntranscendent. What is befitting the use of the moral concepts is\nonly the rationalism of the judgement, which takes from the sensible\nsystem of nature only what pure reason can also conceive of itself,\nthat is, conformity to law, and transfers into the supersensible\nnothing but what can conversely be actually exhibited by actions in\nthe world of sense according to the formal rule of a law of nature.\nHowever, the caution against empiricism of practical reason is much\nmore important; for mysticism is quite reconcilable with the purity\nand sublimity of the moral law, and, besides, it is not very natural\nor agreeable to common habits of thought to strain one's imagination\nto supersensible intuitions; and hence the danger on this side is\nnot so general. Empiricism, on the contrary, cuts up at the roots\nthe morality of intentions (in which, and not in actions only,\nconsists the high worth that men can and ought to give to themselves),\nand substitutes for duty something quite different, namely, an\nempirical interest, with which the inclinations generally are secretly\nleagued; and empiricism, moreover, being on this account allied with\nall the inclinations which (no matter what fashion they put on)\ndegrade humanity when they are raised to the dignity of a supreme\npractical principle; and as these, nevertheless, are so favourable\nto everyone's feelings, it is for that reason much more dangerous than\nmysticism, which can never constitute a lasting condition of any great\nnumber of persons.\nBOOK_1|CHAPTER_3\nCHAPTER III. Of the Motives of Pure Practical Reason.\nWhat is essential in the moral worth of actions is that the moral\nlaw should directly determine the will. If the determination of the\nwill takes place in conformity indeed to the moral law, but only by\nmeans of a feeling, no matter of what kind, which has to be\npresupposed in order that the law may be sufficient to determine the\nwill, and therefore not for the sake of the law, then the action\nwill possess legality, but not morality. Now, if we understand by\nmotive (elater animi) the subjective ground of determination of the\nwill of a being whose reason does not necessarily conform to the\nobjective law, by virtue of its own nature, then it will follow,\nfirst, that no motives can be attributed to the Divine will, and that\nthe motives of the human will (as well as that of every created\nrational being) can never be anything else than the moral law, and\nconsequently that the objective principle of determination must always\nand alone be also the subjectively sufficient determining principle of\nthe action, if this is not merely to fulfil the letter of the law,\nwithout containing its spirit. *\n* We may say of every action that conforms to the law, but is not\ndone for the sake of the law, that it is morally good in the letter,\nnot in the spirit (the intention).\nSince, then, for the purpose of giving the moral law influence\nover the will, we must not seek for any other motives that might\nenable us to dispense with the motive of the law itself, because\nthat would produce mere hypocrisy, without consistency; and it is even\ndangerous to allow other motives (for instance, that of interest) even\nto co-operate along with the moral law; hence nothing is left us but\nto determine carefully in what way the moral law becomes a motive, and\nwhat effect this has upon the faculty of desire. For as to the\nquestion how a law can be directly and of itself a determining\nprinciple of the will (which is the essence of morality), this is, for\nhuman reason, an insoluble problem and identical with the question:\nhow a free will is possible. Therefore what we have to show a priori\nis not why the moral law in itself supplies a motive, but what\neffect it, as such, produces (or, more correctly speaking, must\nproduce) on the mind.\n{BOOK_1|CHAPTER_3 ^paragraph 5}\nThe essential point in every determination of the will by the\nmoral law is that being a free will it is determined simply by the\nmoral law, not only without the co-operation of sensible impulses, but\neven to the rejection of all such, and to the checking of all\ninclinations so far as they might be opposed to that law. So far,\nthen, the effect of the moral law as a motive is only negative, and\nthis motive can be known a priori to be such. For all inclination\nand every sensible impulse is founded on feeling, and the negative\neffect produced on feeling (by the check on the inclinations) is\nitself feeling; consequently, we can see a priori that the moral\nlaw, as a determining principle of the will, must by thwarting all our\ninclinations produce a feeling which may be called pain; and in this\nwe have the first, perhaps the only, instance in which we are able\nfrom a priori considerations to determine the relation of a\ncognition (in this case of pure practical reason) to the feeling of\npleasure or displeasure. All the inclinations together (which can be\nreduced to a tolerable system, in which case their satisfaction is\ncalled happiness) constitute self-regard (solipsismus). This is either\nthe self-love that consists in an excessive fondness for oneself\n(philautia), or satisfaction with oneself (arrogantia). The former\nis called particularly selfishness; the latter self-conceit. Pure\npractical reason only checks selfishness, looking on it as natural and\nactive in us even prior to the moral law, so far as to limit it to the\ncondition of agreement with this law, and then it is called rational\nself-love. But self-conceit reason strikes down altogether, since\nall claims to self-esteem which precede agreement with the moral law\nare vain and unjustifiable, for the certainty of a state of mind\nthat coincides with this law is the first condition of personal\nworth (as we shall presently show more clearly), and prior to this\nconformity any pretension to worth is false and unlawful. Now the\npropensity to self-esteem is one of the inclinations which the moral\nlaw checks, inasmuch as that esteem rests only on morality.\nTherefore the moral law breaks down self-conceit. But as this law is\nsomething positive in itself, namely, the form of an intellectual\ncausality, that is, of freedom, it must be an object of respect;\nfor, by opposing the subjective antagonism of the inclinations, it\nweakens self-conceit; and since it even breaks down, that is,\nhumiliates, this conceit, it is an object of the highest respect\nand, consequently, is the foundation of a positive feeling which is\nnot of empirical origin, but is known a priori. Therefore respect\nfor the moral law is a feeling which is produced by an intellectual\ncause, and this feeling is the only one that we know quite a priori\nand the necessity of which we can perceive.\nIn the preceding chapter we have seen that everything that\npresents itself as an object of the will prior to the moral law is\nby that law itself, which is the supreme condition of practical\nreason, excluded from the determining principles of the will which\nwe have called the unconditionally good; and that the mere practical\nform which consists in the adaptation of the maxims to universal\nlegislation first determines what is good in itself and absolutely,\nand is the basis of the maxims of a pure will, which alone is good\nin every respect. However, we find that our nature as sensible\nbeings is such that the matter of desire (objects of inclination,\nwhether of hope or fear) first presents itself to us; and our\npathologically affected self, although it is in its maxims quite unfit\nfor universal legislation; yet, just as if it constituted our entire\nself, strives to put its pretensions forward first, and to have them\nacknowledged as the first and original. This propensity to make\nourselves in the subjective determining principles of our choice serve\nas the objective determining principle of the will generally may be\ncalled self-love; and if this pretends to be legislative as an\nunconditional practical principle it may be called self-conceit. Now\nthe moral law, which alone is truly objective (namely, in every\nrespect), entirely excludes the influence of self-love on the\nsupreme practical principle, and indefinitely checks the\nself-conceit that prescribes the subjective conditions of the former\nas laws. Now whatever checks our self-conceit in our own judgement\nhumiliates; therefore the moral law inevitably humbles every man\nwhen he compares with it the physical propensities of his nature.\nThat, the idea of which as a determining principle of our will humbles\nus in our self-consciousness, awakes respect for itself, so far as\nit is itself positive and a determining principle. Therefore the moral\nlaw is even subjectively a cause of respect. Now since everything that\nenters into self-love belongs to inclination, and all inclination\nrests on feelings, and consequently whatever checks all the feelings\ntogether in self-love has necessarily, by this very circumstance, an\ninfluence on feeling; hence we comprehend how it is possible to\nperceive a priori that the moral law can produce an effect on feeling,\nin that it excludes the inclinations and the propensity to make them\nthe supreme practical condition, i.e., self-love, from all\nparticipation in the supreme legislation. This effect is on one side\nmerely negative, but on the other side, relatively to the\nrestricting principle of pure practical reason, it is positive. No\nspecial kind of feeling need be assumed for this under the name of a\npractical or moral feeling as antecedent to the moral law and\nserving as its foundation.\nThe negative effect on feeling (unpleasantness) is pathological,\nlike every influence on feeling and like every feeling generally.\nBut as an effect of the consciousness of the moral law, and\nconsequently in relation to a supersensible cause, namely, the subject\nof pure practical reason which is the supreme lawgiver, this feeling\nof a rational being affected by inclinations is called humiliation\n(intellectual self-depreciation); but with reference to the positive\nsource of this humiliation, the law, it is respect for it. There is\nindeed no feeling for this law; but inasmuch as it removes the\nresistance out of the way, this removal of an obstacle is, in the\njudgement of reason, esteemed equivalent to a positive help to its\ncausality. Therefore this feeling may also be called a feeling of\nrespect for the moral law, and for both reasons together a moral\nfeeling.\nWhile the moral law, therefore, is a formal determining principle of\naction by practical pure reason, and is moreover a material though\nonly objective determining principle of the objects of action as\ncalled good and evil, it is also a subjective determining principle,\nthat is, a motive to this action, inasmuch as it has influence on\nthe morality of the subject and produces a feeling conducive to the\ninfluence of the law on the will. There is here in the subject no\nantecedent feeling tending to morality. For this is impossible,\nsince every feeling is sensible, and the motive of moral intention\nmust be free from all sensible conditions. On the contrary, while\nthe sensible feeling which is at the bottom of all our inclinations is\nthe condition of that impression which we call respect, the cause that\ndetermines it lies in the pure practical reason; and this impression\ntherefore, on account of its origin, must be called, not a\npathological but a practical effect. For by the fact that the\nconception of the moral law deprives self-love of its influence, and\nself-conceit of its illusion, it lessens the obstacle to pure\npractical reason and produces the conception of the superiority of its\nobjective law to the impulses of the sensibility; and thus, by\nremoving the counterpoise, it gives relatively greater weight to the\nlaw in the judgement of reason (in the case of a will affected by\nthe aforesaid impulses). Thus the respect for the law is not a\nmotive to morality, but is morality itself subjectively considered\nas a motive, inasmuch as pure practical reason, by rejecting all the\nrival pretensions of self-love, gives authority to the law, which now\nalone has influence. Now it is to be observed that as respect is an\neffect on feeling, and therefore on the sensibility, of a rational\nbeing, it presupposes this sensibility, and therefore also the\nfiniteness of such beings on whom the moral law imposes respect; and\nthat respect for the law cannot be attributed to a supreme being, or\nto any being free from all sensibility, in whom, therefore, this\nsensibility cannot be an obstacle to practical reason.\nThis feeling (which we call the moral feeling) is therefore produced\nsimply by reason. It does not serve for the estimation of actions\nnor for the foundation of the objective moral law itself, but merely\nas a motive to make this of itself a maxim. But what name could we\nmore suitably apply to this singular feeling which cannot be\ncompared to any pathological feeling? It is of such a peculiar kind\nthat it seems to be at the disposal of reason only, and that pure\npractical reason.\n{BOOK_1|CHAPTER_3 ^paragraph 10}\nRespect applies always to persons only- not to things. The latter\nmay arouse inclination, and if they are animals (e.g., horses, dogs,\netc.), even love or fear, like the sea, a volcano, a beast of prey;\nbut never respect. Something that comes nearer to this feeling is\nadmiration, and this, as an affection, astonishment, can apply to\nthings also, e.g., lofty mountains, the magnitude, number, and\ndistance of the heavenly bodies, the strength and swiftness of many\nanimals, etc. But all this is not respect. A man also may be an object\nto me of love, fear, or admiration, even to astonishment, and yet\nnot be an object of respect. His jocose humour, his courage and\nstrength, his power from the rank he has amongst others, may inspire\nme with sentiments of this kind, but still inner respect for him is\nwanting. Fontenelle says, \"I bow before a great man, but my mind\ndoes not bow.\" I would add, before an humble plain man, in whom I\nperceive uprightness of character in a higher degree than I am\nconscious of in myself,- my mind bows whether I choose it or not,\nand though I bear my head never so high that he may not forget my\nsuperior rank. Why is this? Because his example exhibits to me a law\nthat humbles my self-conceit when I compare it with my conduct: a law,\nthe practicability of obedience to which I see proved by fact before\nmy eyes. Now, I may even be conscious of a like degree of uprightness,\nand yet the respect remains. For since in man all good is defective,\nthe law made visible by an example still humbles my pride, my standard\nbeing furnished by a man whose imperfections, whatever they may be,\nare not known to me as my own are, and who therefore appears to me\nin a more favourable light. Respect is a tribute which we cannot\nrefuse to merit, whether we will or not; we may indeed outwardly\nwithhold it, but we cannot help feeling it inwardly.\nRespect is so far from being a feeling of pleasure that we only\nreluctantly give way to it as regards a man. We try to find\nout something that may lighten the burden of it, some fault\nto compensate us for the humiliation which such an example\ncauses. Even the dead are not always secure from this criticism,\nespecially if their example appears inimitable. Even the moral law\nitself in its solemn majesty is exposed to this endeavour to save\noneself from yielding it respect. Can it be thought that it is for any\nother reason that we are so ready to reduce it to the level of our\nfamiliar inclination, or that it is for any other reason that we all\ntake such trouble to make it out to be the chosen precept of our own\ninterest well understood, but that we want to be free from the\ndeterrent respect which shows us our own unworthiness with such\nseverity? Nevertheless, on the other hand, so little is there pain\nin it that if once one has laid aside self-conceit and allowed\npractical influence to that respect, he can never be satisfied with\ncontemplating the majesty of this law, and the soul believes itself\nelevated in proportion as it sees the holy law elevated above it and\nits frail nature. No doubt great talents and activity proportioned\nto them may also occasion respect or an analogous feeling. It is\nvery proper to yield it to them, and then it appears as if this\nsentiment were the same thing as admiration. But if we look closer\nwe shall observe that it is always uncertain how much of the ability\nis due to native talent, and how much to diligence in cultivating\nit. Reason represents it to us as probably the fruit of cultivation,\nand therefore as meritorious, and this notably reduces our\nself-conceit, and either casts a reproach on us or urges us to\nfollow such an example in the way that is suitable to us. This\nrespect, then, which we show to such a person (properly speaking, to\nthe law that his example exhibits) is not mere admiration; and this is\nconfirmed also by the fact that when the common run of admirers\nthink they have learned from any source the badness of such a man's\ncharacter (for instance Voltaire's) they give up all respect for\nhim; whereas the true scholar still feels it at least with regard to\nhis talents, because he is himself engaged in a business and a\nvocation which make imitation of such a man in some degree a law.\nRespect for the moral law is, therefore, the only and the\nundoubted moral motive, and this feeling is directed to no object,\nexcept on the ground of this law. The moral law first determines the\nwill objectively and directly in the judgement of reason; and freedom,\nwhose causality can be determined only by the law, consists just in\nthis, that it restricts all inclinations, and consequently\nself-esteem, by the condition of obedience to its pure law. This\nrestriction now has an effect on feeling, and produces the\nimpression of displeasure which can be known a priori from the moral\nlaw. Since it is so far only a negative effect which, arising from the\ninfluence of pure practical reason, checks the activity of the\nsubject, so far as it is determined by inclinations, and hence\nchecks the opinion of his personal worth (which, in the absence of\nagreement with the moral law, is reduced to nothing); hence, the\neffect of this law on feeling is merely humiliation. We can,\ntherefore, perceive this a priori, but cannot know by it the force\nof the pure practical law as a motive, but only the resistance to\nmotives of the sensibility. But since the same law is objectively,\nthat is, in the conception of pure reason, an immediate principle of\ndetermination of the will, and consequently this humiliation takes\nplace only relatively to the purity of the law; hence, the lowering of\nthe pretensions of moral self-esteem, that is, humiliation on the\nsensible side, is an elevation of the moral, i.e., practical, esteem\nfor the law itself on the intellectual side; in a word, it is\nrespect for the law, and therefore, as its cause is intellectual, a\npositive feeling which can be known a priori. For whatever\ndiminishes the obstacles to an activity furthers this activity itself.\nNow the recognition of the moral law is the consciousness of an\nactivity of practical reason from objective principles, which only\nfails to reveal its effect in actions because subjective\n(pathological) causes hinder it. Respect for the moral law then must\nbe regarded as a positive, though indirect, effect of it on feeling,\ninasmuch as this respect weakens the impeding influence of\ninclinations by humiliating self-esteem; and hence also as a subjective\nprinciple of activity, that is, as a motive to obedience to the law,\nand as a principle of the maxims of a life conformable to it. From the\nnotion of a motive arises that of an interest, which can never be\nattributed to any being unless it possesses reason, and which\nsignifies a motive of the will in so far as it is conceived by the\nreason. Since in a morally good will the law itself must be the\nmotive, the moral interest is a pure interest of practical reason\nalone, independent of sense. On the notion of an interest is based\nthat of a maxim. This, therefore, is morally good only in case it\nrests simply on the interest taken in obedience to the law. All\nthree notions, however, that of a motive, of an interest, and of a\nmaxim, can be applied only to finite beings. For they all suppose a\nlimitation of the nature of the being, in that the subjective\ncharacter of his choice does not of itself agree with the objective\nlaw of a practical reason; they suppose that the being requires to\nbe impelled to action by something, because an internal obstacle\nopposes itself. Therefore they cannot be applied to the Divine will.\nThere is something so singular in the unbounded esteem for the\npure moral law, apart from all advantage, as it is presented for our\nobedience by practical reason, the voice of which makes even the\nboldest sinner tremble and compels him to hide himself from it, that\nwe cannot wonder if we find this influence of a mere intellectual idea\non the feelings quite incomprehensible to speculative reason and\nhave to be satisfied with seeing so much of this a priori that such\na feeling is inseparably connected with the conception of the moral\nlaw in every finite rational being. If this feeling of respect were\npathological, and therefore were a feeling of pleasure based on the\ninner sense, it would be in vain to try to discover a connection of it\nwith any idea a priori. But [it] is a feeling that applies merely to\nwhat is practical, and depends on the conception of a law, simply as\nto its form, not on account of any object, and therefore cannot be\nreckoned either as pleasure or pain, and yet produces an interest in\nobedience to the law, which we call the moral interest, just as the\ncapacity of taking such an interest in the law (or respect for the\nmoral law itself) is properly the moral feeling.\nThe consciousness of a free submission of the will to the law, yet\ncombined with an inevitable constraint put upon all inclinations,\nthough only by our own reason, is respect for the law. The law that\ndemands this respect and inspires it is clearly no other than the\nmoral (for no other precludes all inclinations from exercising any\ndirect influence on the will). An action which is objectively\npractical according to this law, to the exclusion of every determining\nprinciple of inclination, is duty, and this by reason of that\nexclusion includes in its concept practical obligation, that is, a\ndetermination to actions, however reluctantly they may be done. The\nfeeling that arises from the consciousness of this obligation is not\npathological, as would be a feeling produced by an object of the\nsenses, but practical only, that is, it is made possible by a\npreceding (objective) determination of the will and a causality of the\nreason. As submission to the law, therefore, that is, as a command\n(announcing constraint for the sensibly affected subject), it contains\nin it no pleasure, but on the contrary, so far, pain in the action. On\nthe other hand, however, as this constraint is exercised merely by the\nlegislation of our own reason, it also contains something elevating,\nand this subjective effect on feeling, inasmuch as pure practical\nreason is the sole cause of it, may be called in this respect\nself-approbation, since we recognize ourselves as determined thereto\nsolely by the law without any interest, and are now conscious of a\nquite different interest subjectively produced thereby, and which is\npurely practical and free; and our taking this interest in an action\nof duty is not suggested by any inclination, but is commanded and\nactually brought about by reason through the practical law; whence\nthis feeling obtains a special name, that of respect.\n{BOOK_1|CHAPTER_3 ^paragraph 15}\nThe notion of duty, therefore, requires in the action,\nobjectively, agreement with the law, and, subjectively in its maxim,\nthat respect for the law shall be the sole mode in which the will is\ndetermined thereby. And on this rests the distinction between the\nconsciousness of having acted according to duty and from duty, that\nis, from respect for the law. The former (legality) is possible even\nif inclinations have been the determining principles of the will;\nbut the latter (morality), moral worth, can be placed only in this,\nthat the action is done from duty, that is, simply for the sake of the\nlaw. *\n* If we examine accurately the notion of respect for persons as it\nhas been already laid down, we shall perceive that it always rests\non the consciousness of a duty which an example shows us, and that\nrespect, therefore, can never have any but a moral ground, and that it\nis very good and even, in a psychological point of view, very useful\nfor the knowledge of mankind, that whenever we use this expression\nwe should attend to this secret and marvellous, yet often recurring,\nregard which men in their judgement pay to the moral law.\nIt is of the greatest importance to attend with the utmost exactness\nin all moral judgements to the subjective principle of all maxims,\nthat all the morality of actions may be placed in the necessity of\nacting from duty and from respect for the law, not from love and\ninclination for that which the actions are to produce. For men and all\ncreated rational beings moral necessity is constraint, that is\nobligation, and every action based on it is to be conceived as a duty,\nnot as a proceeding previously pleasing, or likely to be pleasing to\nus of our own accord. As if indeed we could ever bring it about that\nwithout respect for the law, which implies fear, or at least\napprehension of transgression, we of ourselves, like the independent\nDeity, could ever come into possession of holiness of will by the\ncoincidence of our will with the pure moral law becoming as it were\npart of our nature, never to be shaken (in which case the law would\ncease to be a command for us, as we could never be tempted to be\nuntrue to it).\n{BOOK_1|CHAPTER_3 ^paragraph 20}\nThe moral law is in fact for the will of a perfect being a law of\nholiness, but for the will of every finite rational being a law of\nduty, of moral constraint, and of the determination of its actions\nby respect for this law and reverence for its duty. No other\nsubjective principle must be assumed as a motive, else while the\naction might chance to be such as the law prescribes, yet, as does not\nproceed from duty, the intention, which is the thing properly in\nquestion in this legislation, is not moral.\nIt is a very beautiful thing to do good to men from love to them and\nfrom sympathetic good will, or to be just from love of order; but this\nis not yet the true moral maxim of our conduct which is suitable to\nour position amongst rational beings as men, when we pretend with\nfanciful pride to set ourselves above the thought of duty, like\nvolunteers, and, as if we were independent on the command, to want\nto do of our own good pleasure what we think we need no command to do.\nWe stand under a discipline of reason and in all our maxims must not\nforget our subjection to it, nor withdraw anything therefrom, or by an\negotistic presumption diminish aught of the authority of the law\n(although our own reason gives it) so as to set the determining\nprinciple of our will, even though the law be conformed to, anywhere\nelse but in the law itself and in respect for this law. Duty and\nobligation are the only names that we must give to our relation to the\nmoral law. We are indeed legislative members of a moral kingdom\nrendered possible by freedom, and presented to us by reason as an\nobject of respect; but yet we are subjects in it, not the sovereign,\nand to mistake our inferior position as creatures, and\npresumptuously to reject the authority of the moral law, is already to\nrevolt from it in spirit, even though the letter of it is fulfilled.\nWith this agrees very well the possibility of such a command as:\nLove God above everything, and thy neighbour as thyself. * For as a\ncommand it requires respect for a law which commands love and does not\nleave it to our own arbitrary choice to make this our principle.\nLove to God, however, considered as an inclination (pathological\nlove), is impossible, for He is not an object of the senses. The\nsame affection towards men is possible no doubt, but cannot be\ncommanded, for it is not in the power of any man to love anyone at\ncommand; therefore it is only practical love that is meant in that\npith of all laws. To love God means, in this sense, to like to do\nHis commandments; to love one's neighbour means to like to practise\nall duties towards him. But the command that makes this a rule\ncannot command us to have this disposition in actions conformed to\nduty, but only to endeavour after it. For a command to like to do a\nthing is in itself contradictory, because if we already know of\nourselves what we are bound to do, and if further we are conscious\nof liking to do it, a command would be quite needless; and if we do it\nnot willingly, but only out of respect for the law, a command that\nmakes this respect the motive of our maxim would directly counteract\nthe disposition commanded. That law of all laws, therefore, like all\nthe moral precepts of the Gospel, exhibits the moral disposition in\nall its perfection, in which, viewed as an ideal of holiness, it is\nnot attainable by any creature, but yet is the pattern which we should\nstrive to approach, and in an uninterrupted but infinite progress\nbecome like to. In fact, if a rational creature could ever reach\nthis point, that he thoroughly likes to do all moral laws, this\nwould mean that there does not exist in him even the possibility of\na desire that would tempt him to deviate from them; for to overcome\nsuch a desire always costs the subject some sacrifice and therefore\nrequires self-compulsion, that is, inward constraint to something that\none does not quite like to do; and no creature can ever reach this\nstage of moral disposition. For, being a creature, and therefore\nalways dependent with respect to what he requires for complete\nsatisfaction, he can never be quite free from desires and\ninclinations, and as these rest on physical causes, they can never\nof themselves coincide with the moral law, the sources of which are\nquite different; and therefore they make it necessary to found the\nmental disposition of one's maxims on moral obligation, not on ready\ninclination, but on respect, which demands obedience to the law,\neven though one may not like it; not on love, which apprehends no\ninward reluctance of the will towards the law. Nevertheless, this\nlatter, namely, love to the law (which would then cease to be a\ncommand, and then morality, which would have passed subjectively\ninto holiness, would cease to be virtue) must be the constant though\nunattainable goal of his endeavours. For in the case of what we highly\nesteem, but yet (on account of the consciousness of our weakness)\ndread, the increased facility of satisfying it changes the most\nreverential awe into inclination, and respect into love; at least this\nwould be the perfection of a disposition devoted to the law, if it\nwere possible for a creature to attain it.\n* This law is in striking contrast with the principle of private\nhappiness which some make the supreme principle of morality. This\nwould be expressed thus: Love thyself above everything, and God and\nthy neighbour for thine own sake.\n{BOOK_1|CHAPTER_3 ^paragraph 25}\nThis reflection is intended not so much to clear up the\nevangelical command just cited, in order to prevent religious\nfanaticism in regard to love of God, but to define accurately the\nmoral disposition with regard directly to our duties towards men,\nand to check, or if possible prevent, a merely moral fanaticism\nwhich infects many persons. The stage of morality on which man (and,\nas far as we can see, every rational creature) stands is respect for\nthe moral law. The disposition that he ought to have in obeying this\nis to obey it from duty, not from spontaneous inclination, or from\nan endeavour taken up from liking and unbidden; and this proper\nmoral condition in which he can always be is virtue, that is, moral\ndisposition militant, and not holiness in the fancied possession of\na perfect purity of the disposition of the will. It is nothing but\nmoral fanaticism and exaggerated self-conceit that is infused into the\nmind by exhortation to actions as noble, sublime, and magnanimous,\nby which men are led into the delusion that it is not duty, that is,\nrespect for the law, whose yoke (an easy yoke indeed, because reason\nitself imposes it on us) they must bear, whether they like it or\nnot, that constitutes the determining principle of their actions,\nand which always humbles them while they obey it; fancying that\nthose actions are expected from them, not from duty, but as pure\nmerit. For not only would they, in imitating such deeds from such a\nprinciple, not have fulfilled the spirit of the law in the least,\nwhich consists not in the legality of the action (without regard to\nprinciple), but in the subjection of the mind to the law; not only\ndo they make the motives pathological (seated in sympathy or\nself-love), not moral (in the law), but they produce in this way a\nvain, high-flying, fantastic way of thinking, flattering themselves\nwith a spontaneous goodness of heart that needs neither spur nor\nbridle, for which no command is needed, and thereby forgetting their\nobligation, which they ought to think of rather than merit. Indeed\nactions of others which are done with great sacrifice, and merely\nfor the sake of duty, may be praised as noble and sublime, but only so\nfar as there are traces which suggest that they were done wholly out\nof respect for duty and not from excited feelings. If these,\nhowever, are set before anyone as examples to be imitated, respect for\nduty (which is the only true moral feeling) must be employed as the\nmotive- this severe holy precept which never allows our vain self-love\nto dally with pathological impulses (however analogous they may be\nto morality), and to take a pride in meritorious worth. Now if we\nsearch we shall find for all actions that are worthy of praise a law\nof duty which commands, and does not leave us to choose what may be\nagreeable to our inclinations. This is the only way of representing\nthings that can give a moral training to the soul, because it alone is\ncapable of solid and accurately defined principles.\nIf fanaticism in its most general sense is a deliberate over\nstepping of the limits of human reason, then moral fanaticism is\nsuch an over stepping of the bounds that practical pure reason sets to\nmankind, in that it forbids us to place the subjective determining\nprinciple of correct actions, that is, their moral motive, in anything\nbut the law itself, or to place the disposition which is thereby\nbrought into the maxims in anything but respect for this law, and\nhence commands us to take as the supreme vital principle of all\nmorality in men the thought of duty, which strikes down all\narrogance as well as vain self-love.\nIf this is so, it is not only writers of romance or sentimental\neducators (although they may be zealous opponents of\nsentimentalism), but sometimes even philosophers, nay, even the\nseverest of all, the Stoics, that have brought in moral fanaticism\ninstead of a sober but wise moral discipline, although the\nfanaticism of the latter was more heroic, that of the former of an\ninsipid, effeminate character; and we may, without hypocrisy, say of\nthe moral teaching of the Gospel, that it first, by the purity of\nits moral principle, and at the same time by its suitability to the\nlimitations of finite beings, brought all the good conduct of men\nunder the discipline of a duty plainly set before their eyes, which\ndoes not permit them to indulge in dreams of imaginary moral\nperfections; and that it also set the bounds of humility (that is,\nself-knowledge) to self-conceit as well as to self-love, both which\nare ready to mistake their limits.\nDuty! Thou sublime and mighty name that dost embrace nothing\ncharming or insinuating, but requirest submission, and yet seekest not\nto move the will by threatening aught that would arouse natural\naversion or terror, but merely holdest forth a law which of itself\nfinds entrance into the mind, and yet gains reluctant reverence\n(though not always obedience), a law before which all inclinations are\ndumb, even though they secretly counter-work it; what origin is\nthere worthy of thee, and where is to be found the root of thy noble\ndescent which proudly rejects all kindred with the inclinations; a\nroot to be derived from which is the indispensable condition of the\nonly worth which men can give themselves?\n{BOOK_1|CHAPTER_3 ^paragraph 30}\nIt can be nothing less than a power which elevates man above himself\n(as a part of the world of sense), a power which connects him with\nan order of things that only the understanding can conceive, with a\nworld which at the same time commands the whole sensible world, and\nwith it the empirically determinable existence of man in time, as well\nas the sum total of all ends (which totality alone suits such\nunconditional practical laws as the moral). This power is nothing\nbut personality, that is, freedom and independence on the mechanism of\nnature, yet, regarded also as a faculty of a being which is subject to\nspecial laws, namely, pure practical laws given by its own reason;\nso that the person as belonging to the sensible world is subject to\nhis own personality as belonging to the intelligible [supersensible]\nworld. It is then not to be wondered at that man, as belonging to both\nworlds, must regard his own nature in reference to its second and\nhighest characteristic only with reverence, and its laws with the\nhighest respect.\nOn this origin are founded many expressions which designate the\nworth of objects according to moral ideas. The moral law is holy\n(inviolable). Man is indeed unholy enough, but he must regard humanity\nin his own person as holy. In all creation every thing one chooses and\nover which one has any power, may be used merely as means; man\nalone, and with him every rational creature, is an end in himself.\nBy virtue of the autonomy of his freedom he is the subject of the\nmoral law, which is holy. Just for this reason every will, even\nevery person's own individual will, in relation to itself, is\nrestricted to the condition of agreement with the autonomy of the\nrational being, that is to say, that it is not to be subject to any\npurpose which cannot accord with a law which might arise from the will\nof the passive subject himself; the latter is, therefore, never to\nbe employed merely as means, but as itself also, concurrently, an end.\nWe justly attribute this condition even to the Divine will, with\nregard to the rational beings in the world, which are His creatures,\nsince it rests on their personality, by which alone they are ends in\nthemselves.\nThis respect-inspiring idea of personality which sets before our\neyes the sublimity of our nature (in its higher aspect), while at\nthe same time it shows us the want of accord of our conduct with it\nand thereby strikes down self-conceit, is even natural to the\ncommonest reason and easily observed. Has not every even moderately\nhonourable man sometimes found that, where by an otherwise inoffensive\nlie he might either have withdrawn himself from an unpleasant\nbusiness, or even have procured some advantages for a loved and\nwell-deserving friend, he has avoided it solely lest he should despise\nhimself secretly in his own eyes? When an upright man is in the\ngreatest distress, which he might have avoided if he could only have\ndisregarded duty, is he not sustained by the consciousness that he has\nmaintained humanity in its proper dignity in his own person and\nhonoured it, that he has no reason to be ashamed of himself in his own\nsight, or to dread the inward glance of self-examination? This\nconsolation is not happiness, it is not even the smallest part of\nit, for no one would wish to have occasion for it, or would,\nperhaps, even desire a life in such circumstances. But he lives, and\nhe cannot endure that he should be in his own eyes unworthy of life.\nThis inward peace is therefore merely negative as regards what can\nmake life pleasant; it is, in fact, only the escaping the danger of\nsinking in personal worth, after everything else that is valuable\nhas been lost. It is the effect of a respect for something quite\ndifferent from life, something in comparison and contrast with which\nlife with all its enjoyment has no value. He still lives only\nbecause it is his duty, not because he finds anything pleasant in\nlife.\nSuch is the nature of the true motive of pure practical reason; it\nis no other than the pure moral law itself, inasmuch as it makes us\nconscious of the sublimity of our own supersensible existence and\nsubjectively produces respect for their higher nature in men who are\nalso conscious of their sensible existence and of the consequent\ndependence of their pathologically very susceptible nature. Now with\nthis motive may be combined so many charms and satisfactions of life\nthat even on this account alone the most prudent choice of a\nrational Epicurean reflecting on the greatest advantage of life\nwould declare itself on the side of moral conduct, and it may even\nbe advisable to join this prospect of a cheerful enjoyment of life\nwith that supreme motive which is already sufficient of itself; but\nonly as a counterpoise to the attractions which vice does not fail\nto exhibit on the opposite side, and not so as, even in the smallest\ndegree, to place in this the proper moving power when duty is in\nquestion. For that would be just the same as to wish to taint the\npurity of the moral disposition in its source. The majesty of duty has\nnothing to do with enjoyment of life; it has its special law and its\nspecial tribunal, and though the two should be never so well shaken\ntogether to be given well mixed, like medicine, to the sick soul,\nyet they will soon separate of themselves; and if they do not, the\nformer will not act; and although physical life might gain somewhat in\nforce, the moral life would fade away irrecoverably.\n{BOOK_1|CHAPTER_3 ^paragraph 35}\nCritical Examination of the Analytic of Pure Practical Reason.\nBy the critical examination of a science, or of a portion of it,\nwhich constitutes a system by itself, I understand the inquiry and\nproof why it must have this and no other systematic form, when we\ncompare it with another system which is based on a similar faculty\nof knowledge. Now practical and speculative reason are based on the\nsame faculty, so far as both are pure reason. Therefore the difference\nin their systematic form must be determined by the comparison of both,\nand the ground of this must be assigned.\nThe Analytic of pure theoretic reason had to do with the knowledge\nof such objects as may have been given to the understanding, and was\nobliged therefore to begin from intuition and consequently (as this is\nalways sensible) from sensibility; and only after that could advance\nto concepts (of the objects of this intuition), and could only end\nwith principles after both these had preceded. On the contrary,\nsince practical reason has not to do with objects so as to know\nthem, but with its own faculty of realizing them (in accordance with\nthe knowledge of them), that is, with a will which is a causality,\ninasmuch as reason contains its determining principle; since,\nconsequently, it has not to furnish an object of intuition, but as\npractical reason has to furnish only a law (because the notion of\ncausality always implies the reference to a law which determines the\nexistence of the many in relation to one another); hence a critical\nexamination of the Analytic of reason, if this is to be practical\nreason (and this is properly the problem), must begin with the\npossibility of practical principles a priori. Only after that can it\nproceed to concepts of the objects of a practical reason, namely,\nthose of absolute good and evil, in order to assign them in accordance\nwith those principles (for prior to those principles they cannot\npossibly be given as good and evil by any faculty of knowledge), and\nonly then could the section be concluded with the last chapter,\nthat, namely, which treats of the relation of the pure practical\nreason to the sensibility and of its necessary influence thereon,\nwhich is a priori cognisable, that is, of the moral sentiment. Thus\nthe Analytic of the practical pure reason has the whole extent of\nthe conditions of its use in common with the theoretical, but in\nreverse order. The Analytic of pure theoretic reason was divided\ninto transcendental Aesthetic and transcendental Logic, that of the\npractical reversely into Logic and Aesthetic of pure practical\nreason (if I may, for the sake of analogy merely, use these\ndesignations, which are not quite suitable). This logic again was\nthere divided into the Analytic of concepts and that of principles:\nhere into that of principles and concepts. The Aesthetic also had in\nthe former case two parts, on account of the two kinds of sensible\nintuition; here the sensibility is not considered as a capacity of\nintuition at all, but merely as feeling (which can be a subjective\nground of desire), and in regard to it pure practical reason admits no\nfurther division.\nIt is also easy to see the reason why this division into two parts\nwith its subdivision was not actually adopted here (as one might\nhave been induced to attempt by the example of the former critique).\nFor since it is pure reason that is here considered in its practical\nuse, and consequently as proceeding from a priori principles, and\nnot from empirical principles of determination, hence the division\nof the analytic of pure practical reason must resemble that of a\nsyllogism; namely, proceeding from the universal in the major\npremiss (the moral principle), through a minor premiss containing a\nsubsumption of possible actions (as good or evil) under the former, to\nthe conclusion, namely, the subjective determination of the will (an\ninterest in the possible practical good, and in the maxim founded on\nit). He who has been able to convince himself of the truth of the\npositions occurring in the Analytic will take pleasure in such\ncomparisons; for they justly suggest the expectation that we may\nperhaps some day be able to discern the unity of the whole faculty\nof reason (theoretical as well as practical) and be able to derive all\nfrom one principle, which, is what human reason inevitably demands, as\nit finds complete satisfaction only in a perfectly systematic unity of\nits knowledge.\n{BOOK_1|CHAPTER_3 ^paragraph 40}\nIf now we consider also the contents of the knowledge that we can\nhave of a pure practical reason, and by means of it, as shown by the\nAnalytic, we find, along with a remarkable analogy between it and\nthe theoretical, no less remarkable differences. As regards the\ntheoretical, the faculty of a pure rational cognition a priori could\nbe easily and evidently proved by examples from sciences (in which, as\nthey put their principles to the test in so many ways by methodical\nuse, there is not so much reason as in common knowledge to fear a\nsecret mixture of empirical principles of cognition). But, that pure\nreason without the admixture of any empirical principle is practical\nof itself, this could only be shown from the commonest practical use\nof reason, by verifying the fact, that every man's natural reason\nacknowledges the supreme practical principle as the supreme law of his\nwill- a law completely a priori and not depending on any sensible\ndata. It was necessary first to establish and verify the purity of its\norigin, even in the judgement of this common reason, before science\ncould take it in hand to make use of it, as a fact, that is, prior\nto all disputation about its possibility, and all the consequences\nthat may be drawn from it. But this circumstance may be readily\nexplained from what has just been said; because practical pure\nreason must necessarily begin with principles, which therefore must be\nthe first data, the foundation of all science, and cannot be derived\nfrom it. It was possible to effect this verification of moral\nprinciples as principles of a pure reason quite well, and with\nsufficient certainty, by a single appeal to the judgement of common\nsense, for this reason, that anything empirical which might slip\ninto our maxims as a determining principle of the will can be detected\nat once by the feeling of pleasure or pain which necessarily\nattaches to it as exciting desire; whereas pure practical reason\npositively refuses to admit this feeling into its principle as a\ncondition. The heterogeneity of the determining principles (the\nempirical and rational) is clearly detected by this resistance of a\npractically legislating reason against every admixture of inclination,\nand by a peculiar kind of sentiment, which, however, does not\nprecede the legislation of the practical reason, but, on the contrary,\nis produced by this as a constraint, namely, by the feeling of a\nrespect such as no man has for inclinations of whatever kind but for\nthe law only; and it is detected in so marked and prominent a manner\nthat even the most uninstructed cannot fail to see at once in an\nexample presented to him, that empirical principles of volition may\nindeed urge him to follow their attractions, but that he can never\nbe expected to obey anything but the pure practical law of reason\nalone.\nThe distinction between the doctrine of happiness and the doctrine\nof morality, in the former of which empirical principles constitute\nthe entire foundation, while in the second they do not form the\nsmallest part of it, is the first and most important office of the\nAnalytic of pure practical reason; and it must proceed in it with as\nmuch exactness and, so to speak, scrupulousness, as any geometer in\nhis work. The philosopher, however, has greater difficulties to\ncontend with here (as always in rational cognition by means of\nconcepts merely without construction), because he cannot take any\nintuition as a foundation (for a pure noumenon). He has, however, this\nadvantage that, like the chemist, he can at any time make an\nexperiment with every man's practical reason for the purpose of\ndistinguishing the moral (pure) principle of determination from the\nempirical; namely, by adding the moral law (as a determining\nprinciple) to the empirically affected will (e.g., that of the man who\nwould be ready to lie because he can gain something thereby). It is as\nif the analyst added alkali to a solution of lime in hydrochloric\nacid, the acid at once forsakes the lime, combines with the alkali,\nand the lime is precipitated. Just in the same way, if to a man who is\notherwise honest (or who for this occasion places himself only in\nthought in the position of an honest man), we present the moral law by\nwhich he recognises the worthlessness of the liar, his practical\nreason (in forming a judgement of what ought to be done) at once\nforsakes the advantage, combines with that which maintains in him\nrespect for his own person (truthfulness), and the advantage after\nit has been separated and washed from every particle of reason\n(which is altogether on the side of duty) is easily weighed by\neveryone, so that it can enter into combination with reason in other\ncases, only not where it could be opposed to the moral law, which\nreason never forsakes, but most closely unites itself with.\nBut it does not follow that this distinction between the principle\nof happiness and that of morality is an opposition between them, and\npure practical reason does not require that we should renounce all\nclaim to happiness, but only that the moment duty is in question we\nshould take no account of happiness. It may even in certain respects\nbe a duty to provide for happiness; partly, because (including\nskill, wealth, riches) it contains means for the fulfilment of our\nduty; partly, because the absence of it (e.g., poverty) implies\ntemptations to transgress our duty. But it can never be an immediate\nduty to promote our happiness, still less can it be the principle of\nall duty. Now, as all determining principles of the will, except the\nlaw of pure practical reason alone (the moral law), are all\nempirical and, therefore, as such, belong to the principle of\nhappiness, they must all be kept apart from the supreme principle of\nmorality and never be incorporated with it as a condition; since\nthis would be to destroy all moral worth just as much as any empirical\nadmixture with geometrical principles would destroy the certainty of\nmathematical evidence, which in Plato's opinion is the most\nexcellent thing in mathematics, even surpassing their utility.\nInstead, however, of the deduction of the supreme principle of\npure practical reason, that is, the explanation of the possibility\nof such a knowledge a priori, the utmost we were able to do was to\nshow that if we saw the possibility of the freedom of an efficient\ncause, we should also see not merely the possibility, but even the\nnecessity, of the moral law as the supreme practical law of rational\nbeings, to whom we attribute freedom of causality of their will;\nbecause both concepts are so inseparably united that we might define\npractical freedom as independence of the will on anything but the\nmoral law. But we cannot perceive the possibility of the freedom of an\nefficient cause, especially in the world of sense; we are fortunate if\nonly we can be sufficiently assured that there is no proof of its\nimpossibility, and are now, by the moral law which postulates it,\ncompelled and therefore authorized to assume it. However, there are\nstill many who think that they can explain this freedom on empirical\nprinciples, like any other physical faculty, and treat it as a\npsychological property, the explanation of which only requires a\nmore exact study of the nature of the soul and of the motives of the\nwill, and not as a transcendental predicate of the causality of a\nbeing that belongs to the world of sense (which is really the\npoint). They thus deprive us of the grand revelation which we obtain\nthrough practical reason by means of the moral law, the revelation,\nnamely, of a supersensible world by the realization of the otherwise\ntranscendent concept of freedom, and by this deprive us also of the\nmoral law itself, which admits no empirical principle of\ndetermination. Therefore it will be necessary to add something here as\na protection against this delusion and to exhibit empiricism in its\nnaked superficiality.\nThe notion of causality as physical necessity, in opposition to\nthe same notion as freedom, concerns only the existence of things so\nfar as it is determinable in time, and, consequently, as phenomena, in\nopposition to their causality as things in themselves. Now if we\ntake the attributes of existence of things in time for attributes of\nthings in themselves (which is the common view), then it is impossible\nto reconcile the necessity of the causal relation with freedom; they\nare contradictory. For from the former it follows that every event,\nand consequently every action that takes place at a certain point of\ntime, is a necessary result of what existed in time preceding. Now\nas time past is no longer in my power, hence every action that I\nperform must be the necessary result of certain determining grounds\nwhich are not in my power, that is, at the moment in which I am acting\nI am never free. Nay, even if I assume that my whole existence is\nindependent on any foreign cause (for instance, God), so that the\ndetermining principles of my causality, and even of my whole\nexistence, were not outside myself, yet this would not in the least\ntransform that physical necessity into freedom. For at every moment of\ntime I am still under the necessity of being determined to action by\nthat which is not in my power, and the series of events infinite a\nparte priori, which I only continue according to a pre-determined\norder and could never begin of myself, would be a continuous\nphysical chain, and therefore my causality would never be freedom.\n{BOOK_1|CHAPTER_3 ^paragraph 45}\nIf, then, we would attribute freedom to a being whose existence is\ndetermined in time, we cannot except him from the law of necessity\nas to all events in his existence and, consequently, as to his actions\nalso; for that would be to hand him over to blind chance. Now as\nthis law inevitably applies to all the causality of things, so far\nas their existence is determinable in time, it follows that if this\nwere the mode in which we had also to conceive the existence of\nthese things in themselves, freedom must be rejected as a vain and\nimpossible conception. Consequently, if we would still save it, no\nother way remains but to consider that the existence of a thing, so\nfar as it is determinable in time, and therefore its causality,\naccording to the law of physical necessity, belong to appearance,\nand to attribute freedom to the same being as a thing in itself.\nThis is certainly inevitable, if we would retain both these\ncontradictory concepts together; but in application, when we try to\nexplain their combination in one and the same action, great\ndifficulties present themselves which seem to render such a\ncombination impracticable.\nWhen I say of a man who commits a theft that, by the law of\ncausality, this deed is a necessary result of the determining causes\nin preceding time, then it was impossible that it could not have\nhappened; how then can the judgement, according to the moral law, make\nany change, and suppose that it could have been omitted, because the\nlaw says that it ought to have been omitted; that is, how can a man be\ncalled quite free at the same moment, and with respect to the same\naction in which he is subject to an inevitable physical necessity?\nSome try to evade this by saying that the causes that determine his\ncausality are of such a kind as to agree with a comparative notion\nof freedom. According to this, that is sometimes called a free effect,\nthe determining physical cause of which lies within the acting thing\nitself, e.g., that which a projectile performs when it is in free\nmotion, in which case we use the word freedom, because while it is\nin flight it is not urged by anything external; or as we call the\nmotion of a clock a free motion, because it moves its hands itself,\nwhich therefore do not require to be pushed by external force; so\nalthough the actions of man are necessarily determined by causes which\nprecede in time, we yet call them free, because these causes are ideas\nproduced by our own faculties, whereby desires are evoked on\noccasion of circumstances, and hence actions are wrought according\nto our own pleasure. This is a wretched subterfuge with which some\npersons still let themselves be put off, and so think they have\nsolved, with a petty word- jugglery, that difficult problem, at the\nsolution of which centuries have laboured in vain, and which can\ntherefore scarcely be found so completely on the surface. In fact,\nin the question about the freedom which must be the foundation of\nall moral laws and the consequent responsibility, it does not matter\nwhether the principles which necessarily determine causality by a\nphysical law reside within the subject or without him, or in the\nformer case whether these principles are instinctive or are\nconceived by reason, if, as is admitted by these men themselves, these\ndetermining ideas have the ground of their existence in time and in\nthe antecedent state, and this again in an antecedent, etc. Then it\nmatters not that these are internal; it matters not that they have a\npsychological and not a mechanical causality, that is, produce actions\nby means of ideas and not by bodily movements; they are still\ndetermining principles of the causality of a being whose existence\nis determinable in time, and therefore under the necessitation of\nconditions of past time, which therefore, when the subject has to act,\nare no longer in his power. This may imply psychological freedom (if\nwe choose to apply this term to a merely internal chain of ideas in\nthe mind), but it involves physical necessity and, therefore, leaves\nno room for transcendental freedom, which must be conceived as\nindependence on everything empirical, and, consequently, on nature\ngenerally, whether it is an object of the internal sense considered in\ntime only, or of the external in time and space. Without this\nfreedom (in the latter and true sense), which alone is practical a\npriori, no moral law and no moral imputation are possible. Just for\nthis reason the necessity of events in time, according to the physical\nlaw of causality, may be called the mechanism of nature, although we\ndo not mean by this that things which are subject to it must be really\nmaterial machines. We look here only to the necessity of the\nconnection of events in a time-series as it is developed according\nto the physical law, whether the subject in which this development\ntakes place is called automaton materiale when the mechanical being is\nmoved by matter, or with Leibnitz spirituale when it is impelled by\nideas; and if the freedom of our will were no other than the latter\n(say the psychological and comparative, not also transcendental,\nthat is, absolute), then it would at bottom be nothing better than the\nfreedom of a turnspit, which, when once it is wound up, accomplishes\nits motions of itself.\nNow, in order to remove in the supposed case the apparent\ncontradiction between freedom and the mechanism of nature in one and\nthe same action, we must remember what was said in the Critique of\nPure Reason, or what follows therefrom; viz., that the necessity of\nnature, which cannot co-exist with the freedom of the subject,\nappertains only to the attributes of the thing that is subject to\ntime-conditions, consequently only to those of the acting subject as a\nphenomenon; that therefore in this respect the determining\nprinciples of every action of the same reside in what belongs to\npast time and is no longer in his power (in which must be included his\nown past actions and the character that these may determine for him in\nhis own eyes as a phenomenon). But the very same subject, being on the\nother side conscious of himself as a thing in himself, considers his\nexistence also in so far as it is not subject to time-conditions,\nand regards himself as only determinable by laws which he gives\nhimself through reason; and in this his existence nothing is\nantecedent to the determination of his will, but every action, and\nin general every modification of his existence, varying according to\nhis internal sense, even the whole series of his existence as a\nsensible being is in the consciousness of his supersensible\nexistence nothing but the result, and never to be regarded as the\ndetermining principle, of his causality as a noumenon. In this view\nnow the rational being can justly say of every unlawful action that he\nperforms, that he could very well have left it undone; although as\nappearance it is sufficiently determined in the past, and in this\nrespect is absolutely necessary; for it, with all the past which\ndetermines it, belongs to the one single phenomenon of his character\nwhich he makes for himself, in consequence of which he imputes the\ncausality of those appearances to himself as a cause independent on\nsensibility.\nWith this agree perfectly the judicial sentences of that wonderful\nfaculty in us which we call conscience. A man may use as much art as\nhe likes in order to paint to himself an unlawful act, that he\nremembers, as an unintentional error, a mere oversight, such as one\ncan never altogether avoid, and therefore as something in which he was\ncarried away by the stream of physical necessity, and thus to make\nhimself out innocent, yet he finds that the advocate who speaks in his\nfavour can by no means silence the accuser within, if only he is\nconscious that at the time when he did this wrong he was in his\nsenses, that is, in possession of his freedom; and, nevertheless, he\naccounts for his error from some bad habits, which by gradual\nneglect of attention he has allowed to grow upon him to such a\ndegree that he can regard his error as its natural consequence,\nalthough this cannot protect him from the blame and reproach which\nhe casts upon himself. This is also the ground of repentance for a\nlong past action at every recollection of it; a painful feeling\nproduced by the moral sentiment, and which is practically void in so\nfar as it cannot serve to undo what has been done. (Hence Priestley,\nas a true and consistent fatalist, declares it absurd, and he deserves\nto be commended for this candour more than those who, while they\nmaintain the mechanism of the will in fact, and its freedom in words\nonly, yet wish it to be thought that they include it in their system\nof compromise, although they do not explain the possibility of such\nmoral imputation.) But the pain is quite legitimate, because when\nthe law of our intelligible [supersensible] existence (the moral\nlaw) is in question, reason recognizes no distinction of time, and\nonly asks whether the event belongs to me, as my act, and then\nalways morally connects the same feeling with it, whether it has\nhappened just now or long ago. For in reference to the supersensible\nconsciousness of its existence (i.e., freedom) the life of sense is\nbut a single phenomenon, which, inasmuch as it contains merely\nmanifestations of the mental disposition with regard to the moral\nlaw (i.e., of the character), must be judged not according to the\nphysical necessity that belongs to it as phenomenon, but according\nto the absolute spontaneity of freedom. It may therefore be admitted\nthat, if it were possible to have so profound an insight into a\nman's mental character as shown by internal as well as external\nactions as to know all its motives, even the smallest, and likewise\nall the external occasions that can influence them, we could calculate\na man's conduct for the future with as great certainty as a lunar or\nsolar eclipse; and nevertheless we may maintain that the man is\nfree. In fact, if we were capable of a further glance, namely, an\nintellectual intuition of the same subject (which indeed is not\ngranted to us, and instead of it we have only the rational concept),\nthen we should perceive that this whole chain of appearances in regard\nto all that concerns the moral laws depends on the spontaneity of\nthe subject as a thing in itself, of the determination of which no\nphysical explanation can be given. In default of this intuition, the\nmoral law assures us of this distinction between the relation of our\nactions as appearance to our sensible nature, and the relation of this\nsensible nature to the supersensible substratum in us. In this view,\nwhich is natural to our reason, though inexplicable, we can also\njustify some judgements which we passed with all conscientiousness,\nand which yet at first sight seem quite opposed to all equity. There\nare cases in which men, even with the same education which has been\nprofitable to others, yet show such early depravity, and so continue\nto progress in it to years of manhood, that they are thought to be\nborn villains, and their character altogether incapable of\nimprovement; and nevertheless they are judged for what they do or\nleave undone, they are reproached for their faults as guilty; nay,\nthey themselves (the children) regard these reproaches as well\nfounded, exactly as if in spite of the hopeless natural quality of\nmind ascribed to them, they remained just as responsible as any\nother man. This could not happen if we did not suppose that whatever\nsprings from a man's choice (as every action intentionally performed\nundoubtedly does) has as its foundation a free causality, which from\nearly youth expresses its character in its manifestations (i.e.,\nactions). These, on account of the uniformity of conduct, exhibit a\nnatural connection, which however does not make the vicious quality of\nthe will necessary, but on the contrary, is the consequence of the\nevil principles voluntarily adopted and unchangeable, which only\nmake it so much the more culpable and deserving of punishment. There\nstill remains a difficulty in the combination of freedom with the\nmechanism of nature in a being belonging to the world of sense; a\ndifficulty which, even after all the foregoing is admitted,\nthreatens freedom with complete destruction. But with this danger\nthere is also a circumstance that offers hope of an issue still\nfavourable to freedom; namely, that the same difficulty presses much\nmore strongly (in fact as we shall presently see, presses only) on the\nsystem that holds the existence determinable in time and space to be\nthe existence of things in themselves; it does not therefore oblige us\nto give up our capital supposition of the ideality of time as a mere\nform of sensible intuition, and consequently as a mere manner of\nrepresentation which is proper to the subject as belonging to the\nworld of sense; and therefore it only requires that this view be\nreconciled with this idea.\nThe difficulty is as follows: Even if it is admitted that the\nsupersensible subject can be free with respect to a given action,\nalthough, as a subject also belonging to the world of sense, he is\nunder mechanical conditions with respect to the same action, still, as\nsoon as we allow that God as universal first cause is also the cause\nof the existence of substance (a proposition which can never be\ngiven up without at the same time giving up the notion of God as the\nBeing of all beings, and therewith giving up his all sufficiency, on\nwhich everything in theology depends), it seems as if we must admit\nthat a man's actions have their determining principle in something\nwhich is wholly out of his power- namely, in the causality of a\nSupreme Being distinct from himself and on whom his own existence\nand the whole determination of his causality are absolutely dependent.\nIn point of fact, if a man's actions as belonging to his modifications\nin time were not merely modifications of him as appearance, but as a\nthing in itself, freedom could not be saved. Man would be a marionette\nor an automaton, like Vaucanson's, prepared and wound up by the\nSupreme Artist. Self-consciousness would indeed make him a thinking\nautomaton; but the consciousness of his own spontaneity would be\nmere delusion if this were mistaken for freedom, and it would\ndeserve this name only in a comparative sense, since, although the\nproximate determining causes of its motion and a long series of\ntheir determining causes are internal, yet the last and highest is\nfound in a foreign hand. Therefore I do not see how those who still\ninsist on regarding time and space as attributes belonging to the\nexistence of things in themselves, can avoid admitting the fatality of\nactions; or if (like the otherwise acute Mendelssohn) they allow\nthem to be conditions necessarily belonging to the existence of finite\nand derived beings, but not to that of the infinite Supreme Being, I\ndo not see on what ground they can justify such a distinction, or,\nindeed, how they can avoid the contradiction that meets them, when\nthey hold that existence in time is an attribute necessarily belonging\nto finite things in themselves, whereas God is the cause of this\nexistence, but cannot be the cause of time (or space) itself (since\nthis must be presupposed as a necessary a priori condition of the\nexistence of things); and consequently as regards the existence of\nthese things. His causality must be subject to conditions and even\nto the condition of time; and this would inevitably bring in\neverything contradictory to the notions of His infinity and\nindependence. On the other hand, it is quite easy for us to draw the\ndistinction between the attribute of the divine existence of being\nindependent on all time-conditions, and that of a being of the world\nof sense, the distinction being that between the existence of a\nbeing in itself and that of a thing in appearance. Hence, if this\nideality of time and space is not adopted, nothing remains but\nSpinozism, in which space and time are essential attributes of the\nSupreme Being Himself, and the things dependent on Him (ourselves,\ntherefore, included) are not substances, but merely accidents inhering\nin Him; since, if these things as His effects exist in time only, this\nbeing the condition of their existence in themselves, then the actions\nof these beings must be simply His actions which He performs in some\nplace and time. Thus, Spinozism, in spite of the absurdity of its\nfundamental idea, argues more consistently than the creation theory\ncan, when beings assumed to be substances, and beings in themselves\nexisting in time, are regarded as effects of a Supreme Cause, and\nyet as not [belonging] to Him and His action, but as separate\nsubstances.\n{BOOK_1|CHAPTER_3 ^paragraph 50}\nThe above-mentioned difficulty is resolved briefly and clearly as\nfollows: If existence in time is a mere sensible mode of\nrepresentation belonging to thinking beings in the world and\nconsequently does not apply to them as things in themselves, then\nthe creation of these beings is a creation of things in themselves,\nsince the notion of creation does not belong to the sensible form of\nrepresentation of existence or to causality, but can only be\nreferred to noumena. Consequently, when I say of beings in the world\nof sense that they are created, I so far regard them as noumena. As it\nwould be a contradiction, therefore, to say that God is a creator of\nappearances, so also it is a contradiction to say that as creator He\nis the cause of actions in the world of sense, and therefore as\nappearances, although He is the cause of the existence of the acting\nbeings (which are noumena). If now it is possible to affirm freedom in\nspite of the natural mechanism of actions as appearances (by regarding\nexistence in time as something that belongs only to appearances, not\nto things in themselves), then the circumstance that the acting beings\nare creatures cannot make the slightest difference, since creation\nconcerns their supersensible and not their sensible existence, and,\ntherefore, cannot be regarded as the determining principle of the\nappearances. It would be quite different if the beings in the world as\nthings in themselves existed in time, since in that case the creator\nof substance would be at the same time the author of the whole\nmechanism of this substance.\nOf so great importance is the separation of time (as well as\nspace) from the existence of things in themselves which was effected\nin the Critique of the Pure Speculative Reason.\nIt may be said that the solution here proposed involves great\ndifficulty in itself and is scarcely susceptible of a lucid\nexposition. But is any other solution that has been attempted, or that\nmay be attempted, easier and more intelligible? Rather might we say\nthat the dogmatic teachers of metaphysics have shown more shrewdness\nthan candour in keeping this difficult point out of sight as much as\npossible, in the hope that if they said nothing about it, probably\nno one would think of it. If science is to be advanced, all\ndifficulties must be laid open, and we must even search for those that\nare hidden, for every difficulty calls forth a remedy, which cannot be\ndiscovered without science gaining either in extent or in exactness;\nand thus even obstacles become means of increasing the thoroughness of\nscience. On the other hand, if the difficulties are intentionally\nconcealed, or merely removed by palliatives, then sooner or later they\nburst out into incurable mischiefs, which bring science to ruin in\nan absolute scepticism.\nSince it is, properly speaking, the notion of freedom alone amongst all\nthe ideas of pure speculative reason that so greatly enlarges our\nknowledge in the sphere of the supersensible, though only of our\npractical knowledge, I ask myself why it exclusively possesses so great\nfertility, whereas the others only designate the vacant space for\npossible beings of the pure understanding, but are unable by any means\nto define the concept of them. I presently find that as I cannot think\nanything without a category, I must first look for a category for the\nrational idea of freedom with which I am now concerned; and this is the\ncategory of causality; and although freedom, a concept of the reason,\nbeing a transcendent concept, cannot have any intuition corresponding to\nit, yet the concept of the understanding- for the synthesis of which the\nformer demands the unconditioned- (namely, the concept of causality)\nmust have a sensible intuition given, by which first its objective\nreality is assured. Now, the categories are all divided into two\nclasses- the mathematical, which concern the unity of synthesis in the\nconception of objects, and the dynamical, which refer to the unity of\nsynthesis in the conception of the existence of objects. The former\n(those of magnitude and quality) always contain a synthesis of the\nhomogeneous, and it is not possible to find in this the unconditioned\nantecedent to what is given in sensible intuition as conditioned in\nspace and time, as this would itself have to belong to space and time,\nand therefore be again still conditioned. Whence it resulted in the\nDialectic of Pure Theoretic Reason that the opposite methods of\nattaining the unconditioned and the totality of the conditions were both\nwrong. The categories of the second class (those of causality and of the\nnecessity of a thing) did not require this homogeneity (of the\nconditioned and the condition in synthesis), since here what we have to\nexplain is not how the intuition is compounded from a manifold in it,\nbut only how the existence of the conditioned object corresponding to it\nis added to the existence of the condition (added, namely, in the\nunderstanding as connected therewith); and in that case it was allowable\nto suppose in the supersensible world the unconditioned antecedent to\nthe altogether conditioned in the world of sense (both as regards the\ncausal connection and the contingent existence of things themselves),\nalthough this unconditioned remained indeterminate, and to make the\nsynthesis transcendent. Hence, it was found in the Dialectic of the Pure\nSpeculative Reason that the two apparently opposite methods of obtaining\nfor the conditioned the unconditioned were not really contradictory,\ne.g., in the synthesis of causality to conceive for the conditioned in\nthe series of causes and effects of the sensible world, a causality\nwhich has no sensible condition, and that the same action which, as\nbelonging to the world of sense, is always sensibly conditioned, that\nis, mechanically necessary, yet at the same time may be derived from a\ncausality not sensibly conditioned- being the causality of the acting\nbeing as belonging to the supersensible world- and may consequently be\nconceived as free. Now, the only point in question was to change this\nmay be into is; that is, that we should be able to show in an actual\ncase, as it were by a fact, that certain actions imply such a causality\n(namely, the intellectual, sensibly unconditioned), whether they are\nactual or only commanded, that is, objectively necessary in a practical\nsense. We could not hope to find this connexion in actions actually\ngiven in experience as events of the sensible world, since causality\nwith freedom must always be sought outside the world of sense in the\nworld of intelligence. But things of sense are the only things offered\nto our perception and observation. Hence, nothing remained but to find\nan incontestable objective principle of causality which excludes all\nsensible conditions: that is, a principle in which reason does not\nappeal further to something else as a determining ground of its\ncausality, but contains this determining ground itself by means of that\nprinciple, and in which therefore it is itself as pure reason practical.\nNow, this principle had not to be searched for or discovered; it had\nlong been in the reason of all men, and incorporated in their nature,\nand is the principle of morality. Therefore, that unconditioned\ncausality, with the faculty of it, namely, freedom, is no longer merely\nindefinitely and problematically thought (this speculative reason could\nprove to be feasible), but is even as regards the law of its causality\ndefinitely and assertorially known; and with it the fact that a being (I\nmyself), belonging to the world of sense, belongs also to the\nsupersensible world, this is also positively known, and thus the reality\nof the supersensible world is established and in practical respects\ndefinitely given, and this definiteness, which for theoretical purposes\nwould be transcendent, is for practical purposes immanent. We could not,\nhowever, make a similar step as regards the second dynamical idea,\nnamely, that of a necessary being. We could not rise to it from the\nsensible world without the aid of the first dynamical idea. For if we\nattempted to do so, we should have ventured to leave at a bound all that\nis given to us, and to leap to that of which nothing is given us that\ncan help us to effect the connection of such a supersensible being with\nthe world of sense (since the necessary being would have to be known as\ngiven outside ourselves). On the other hand, it is now obvious that this\nconnection is quite possible in relation to our own subject, inasmuch as\nI know myself to be on the one side as an intelligible [supersensible]\nbeing determined by the moral law (by means of freedom), and on the\nother side as acting in the world of sense. It is the concept of freedom\nalone that enables us to find the unconditioned and intelligible for the\nconditioned and sensible without going out of ourselves. For it is our\nown reason that by means of the supreme and unconditional practical law\nknows that itself and the being that is conscious of this law (our own\nperson) belong to the pure world of understanding, and moreover defines\nthe manner in which, as such, it can be active. In this way it can be\nunderstood why in the whole faculty of reason it is the practical reason\nonly that can help us to pass beyond the world of sense and give us\nknowledge of a supersensible order and connection, which, however, for\nthis very reason cannot be extended further than is necessary for pure\npractical purposes.\nLet me be permitted on this occasion to make one more remark,\nnamely, that every step that we make with pure reason, even in the\npractical sphere where no attention is paid to subtle speculation,\nnevertheless accords with all the material points of the Critique of\nthe Theoretical Reason as closely and directly as if each step had\nbeen thought out with deliberate purpose to establish this\nconfirmation. Such a thorough agreement, wholly unsought for and quite\nobvious (as anyone can convince himself, if he will only carry moral\ninquiries up to their principles), between the most important\nproposition of practical reason and the often seemingly too subtle and\nneedless remarks of the Critique of the Speculative Reason,\noccasions surprise and astonishment, and confirms the maxim already\nrecognized and praised by others, namely, that in every scientific\ninquiry we should pursue our way steadily with all possible\nexactness and frankness, without caring for any objections that may be\nraised from outside its sphere, but, as far as we can, to carry out\nour inquiry truthfully and completely by itself. Frequent\nobservation has convinced me that, when such researches are concluded,\nthat which in one part of them appeared to me very questionable,\nconsidered in relation to other extraneous doctrines, when I left this\ndoubtfulness out of sight for a time and only attended to the business\nin hand until it was completed, at last was unexpectedly found to\nagree perfectly with what had been discovered separately without the\nleast regard to those doctrines, and without any partiality or\nprejudice for them. Authors would save themselves many errors and much\nlabour lost (because spent on a delusion) if they could only resolve\nto go to work with more frankness.\nBOOK_2|CHAPTER_1\nBOOK II. Dialectic of Pure Practical Reason.\nCHAPTER I. Of a Dialectic of Pure Practical Reason Generally.\nPure reason always has its dialetic, whether it is considered in its\nspeculative or its practical employment; for it requires the\nabsolute totality of the 'conditions of what is given conditioned, and\nthis can only be found in things in themselves. But as all conceptions\nof things in themselves must be referred to intuitions, and with us\nmen these can never be other than sensible and hence can never\nenable us to know objects as things in themselves but only as\nappearances, and since the unconditioned can never be found in this\nchain of appearances which consists only of conditioned and\nconditions; thus from applying this rational idea of the totality of\nthe conditions (in other words of the unconditioned) to appearances,\nthere arises an inevitable illusion, as if these latter were things in\nthemselves (for in the absence of a warning critique they are always\nregarded as such). This illusion would never be noticed as delusive if\nit did not betray itself by a conflict of reason with itself, when\nit applies to appearances its fundamental principle of presupposing\nthe unconditioned to everything conditioned. By this, however,\nreason is compelled to trace this illusion to its source, and search\nhow it can be removed, and this can only be done by a complete\ncritical examination of the whole pure faculty of reason; so that\nthe antinomy of the pure reason which is manifest in its dialectic\nis in fact the most beneficial error into which human reason could\never have fallen, since it at last drives us to search for the key\nto escape from this labyrinth; and when this key is found, it\nfurther discovers that which we did not seek but yet had need of,\nnamely, a view into a higher and an immutable order of things, in\nwhich we even now are, and in which we are thereby enabled by definite\nprecepts to continue to live according to the highest dictates of\nreason.\nIt may be seen in detail in the Critique of Pure Reason how in its\nspeculative employment this natural dialectic is to be solved, and how\nthe error which arises from a very natural illusion may be guarded\nagainst. But reason in its practical use is not a whit better off.\nAs pure practical reason, it likewise seeks to find the\nunconditioned for the practically conditioned (which rests on\ninclinations and natural wants), and this is not as the determining\nprinciple of the will, but even when this is given (in the moral\nlaw) it seeks the unconditioned totality of the object of pure\npractical reason under the name of the summum bonum.\nTo define this idea practically, i.e., sufficiently for the maxims\nof our rational conduct, is the business of practical wisdom, and this\nagain as a science is philosophy, in the sense in which the word was\nunderstood by the ancients, with whom it meant instruction in the\nconception in which the summum bonum was to be placed, and the conduct\nby which it was to be obtained. It would be well to leave this word in\nits ancient signification as a doctrine of the summum bonum, so far as\nreason endeavours to make this into a science. For on the one hand the\nrestriction annexed would suit the Greek expression (which signifies\nthe love of wisdom), and yet at the same time would be sufficient to\nembrace under the name of philosophy the love of science: that is to\nsay, of all speculative rational knowledge, so far as it is\nserviceable to reason, both for that conception and also for the\npractical principle determining our conduct, without letting out of\nsight the main end, on account of which alone it can be called a\ndoctrine of practical wisdom. On the other hand, it would be no harm\nto deter the self-conceit of one who ventures to claim the title of\nphilosopher by holding before him in the very definition a standard of\nself-estimation which would very much lower his pretensions. For a\nteacher of wisdom would mean something more than a scholar who has not\ncome so far as to guide himself, much less to guide others, with\ncertain expectation of attaining so high an end: it would mean a\nmaster in the knowledge of wisdom, which implies more than a modest\nman would claim for himself. Thus philosophy as well as wisdom would\nalways remain an ideal, which objectively is presented complete in\nreason alone, while subjectively for the person it is only the goal of\nhis unceasing endeavours; and no one would be justified in\nprofessing to be in possession of it so as to assume the name of\nphilosopher who could not also show its infallible effects in his\nown person as an example (in his self-mastery and the unquestioned\ninterest that he takes pre-eminently in the general good), and this\nthe ancients also required as a condition of deserving that honourable\ntitle.\n{BOOK_2|CHAPTER_1 ^paragraph 5}\nWe have another preliminary remark to make respecting the\ndialectic of the pure practical reason, on the point of the definition\nof the summum bonum (a successful solution of which dialectic would\nlead us to expect, as in case of that of the theoretical reason, the\nmost beneficial effects, inasmuch as the self-contradictions of pure\npractical reason honestly stated, and not concealed, force us to\nundertake a complete critique of this faculty).\nThe moral law is the sole determining principle of a pure will.\nBut since this is merely formal (viz., as prescribing only the form of\nthe maxim as universally legislative), it abstracts as a determining\nprinciple from all matter that is to say, from every object of\nvolition. Hence, though the summum bonum may be the whole object of\na pure practical reason, i.e., a pure will, yet it is not on that\naccount to be regarded as its determining principle; and the moral law\nalone must be regarded as the principle on which that and its\nrealization or promotion are aimed at. This remark is important in\nso delicate a case as the determination of moral principles, where the\nslightest misinterpretation perverts men's minds. For it will have\nbeen seen from the Analytic that, if we assume any object under the\nname of a good as a determining principle of the will prior to the\nmoral law and then deduce from it the supreme practical principle,\nthis would always introduce heteronomy and crush out the moral\nprinciple.\nIt is, however, evident that if the notion of the summum bonum\nincludes that of the moral law as its supreme condition, then the\nsummum bonum would not merely be an object, but the notion of it and\nthe conception of its existence as possible by our own practical\nreason would likewise be the determining principle of the will,\nsince in that case the will is in fact determined by the moral law\nwhich is already included in this conception, and by no other\nobject, as the principle of autonomy requires. This order of the\nconceptions of determination of the will must not be lost sight of, as\notherwise we should misunderstand ourselves and think we had fallen\ninto a contradiction, while everything remains in perfect harmony.\nBOOK_2|CHAPTER_2\nCHAPTER II. Of the Dialectic of Pure Reason in defining the\nConception of the \"Summum Bonum\".\nThe conception of the summum itself contains an ambiguity which\nmight occasion needless disputes if we did not attend to it. The\nsummum may mean either the supreme (supremum) or the perfect\n(consummatum). The former is that condition which is itself\nunconditioned, i.e., is not subordinate to any other (originarium);\nthe second is that whole which is not a part of a greater whole of the\nsame kind (perfectissimum). It has been shown in the Analytic that\nvirtue (as worthiness to be happy) is the supreme condition of all\nthat can appear to us desirable, and consequently of all our pursuit\nof happiness, and is therefore the supreme good. But it does not\nfollow that it is the whole and perfect good as the object of the\ndesires of rational finite beings; for this requires happiness also,\nand that not merely in the partial eyes of the person who makes\nhimself an end, but even in the judgement of an impartial reason,\nwhich regards persons in general as ends in themselves. For to need\nhappiness, to deserve it, and yet at the same time not to\nparticipate in it, cannot be consistent with the perfect volition of a\nrational being possessed at the same time of all power, if, for the\nsake of experiment, we conceive such a being. Now inasmuch as virtue\nand happiness together constitute the possession of the summum bonum\nin a person, and the distribution of happiness in exact proportion\nto morality (which is the worth of the person, and his worthiness to\nbe happy) constitutes the summum bonum of a possible world; hence this\nsummum bonum expresses the whole, the perfect good, in which, however,\nvirtue as the condition is always the supreme good, since it has no\ncondition above it; whereas happiness, while it is pleasant to the\npossessor of it, is not of itself absolutely and in all respects good,\nbut always presupposes morally right behaviour as its condition.\nWhen two elements are necessarily united in one concept, they must\nbe connected as reason and consequence, and this either so that\ntheir unity is considered as analytical (logical connection), or as\nsynthetical (real connection) the former following the law of\nidentity, the latter that of causality. The connection of virtue and\nhappiness may therefore be understood in two ways: either the\nendeavour to be virtuous and the rational pursuit of happiness are not\ntwo distinct actions, but absolutely identical, in which case no maxim\nneed be made the principle of the former, other than what serves for\nthe latter; or the connection consists in this, that virtue produces\nhappiness as something distinct from the consciousness of virtue, as a\ncause produces an effect.\nThe ancient Greek schools were, properly speaking, only two, and\nin determining the conception of the summum bonum these followed in\nfact one and the same method, inasmuch as they did not allow virtue\nand happiness to be regarded as two distinct elements of the summum\nbonum, and consequently sought the unity of the principle by the\nrule of identity; but they differed as to which of the two was to be\ntaken as the fundamental notion. The Epicurean said: \"To be\nconscious that one's maxims lead to happiness is virtue\"; the Stoic\nsaid: \"To be conscious of one's virtue is happiness.\" With the former,\nPrudence was equivalent to morality; with the latter, who chose a\nhigher designation for virtue, morality alone was true wisdom.\nWhile we must admire the men who in such early times tried all\nimaginable ways of extending the domain of philosophy, we must at\nthe same time lament that their acuteness was unfortunately misapplied\nin trying to trace out identity between two extremely heterogeneous\nnotions, those of happiness and virtue. But it agrees with the\ndialectical spirit of their times (and subtle minds are even now\nsometimes misled in the same way) to get rid of irreconcilable\ndifferences in principle by seeking to change them into a mere contest\nabout words, and thus apparently working out the identity of the\nnotion under different names, and this usually occurs in cases where\nthe combination of heterogeneous principles lies so deep or so high,\nor would require so complete a transformation of the doctrines assumed\nin the rest of the philosophical system, that men are afraid to\npenetrate deeply into the real difference and prefer treating it as\na difference in questions of form.\n{BOOK_2|CHAPTER_2 ^paragraph 5}\nWhile both schools sought to trace out the identity of the practical\nprinciples of virtue and happiness, they were not agreed as to the way\nin which they tried to force this identity, but were separated\ninfinitely from one another, the one placing its principle on the side\nof sense, the other on that of reason; the one in the consciousness of\nsensible wants, the other in the independence of practical reason on\nall sensible grounds of determination. According to the Epicurean, the\nnotion of virtue was already involved in the maxim: \"To promote\none's own happiness\"; according to the Stoics, on the other hand,\nthe feeling of happiness was already contained in the consciousness of\nvirtue. Now whatever is contained in another notion is identical\nwith part of the containing notion, but not with the whole, and\nmoreover two wholes may be specifically distinct, although they\nconsist of the same parts; namely if the parts are united into a whole\nin totally different ways. The Stoic maintained that the virtue was\nthe whole summum bonum, and happiness only the consciousness of\npossessing it, as making part of the state of the subject. The\nEpicurean maintained that happiness was the whole summum bonum, and\nvirtue only the form of the maxim for its pursuit; viz., the\nrational use of the means for attaining it.\nNow it is clear from the Analytic that the maxims of virtue and\nthose of private happiness are quite heterogeneous as to their supreme\npractical principle, and, although they belong to one summum bonum\nwhich together they make possible, yet they are so far from coinciding\nthat they restrict and check one another very much in the same\nsubject. Thus the question: \"How is the summum bonum practically\npossible?\" still remains an unsolved problem, notwithstanding all\nthe attempts at coalition that have hitherto been made. The Analytic\nhas, however, shown what it is that makes the problem difficult to\nsolve; namely, that happiness and morality are two specifically\ndistinct elements of the summum bonum and, therefore, their\ncombination cannot be analytically cognised (as if the man that\nseeks his own happiness should find by mere analysis of his conception\nthat in so acting he is virtuous, or as if the man that follows virtue\nshould in the consciousness of such conduct find that he is already\nhappy ipso facto), but must be a synthesis of concepts. Now since this\ncombination is recognised as a priori, and therefore as practically\nnecessary, and consequently not as derived from experience, so that\nthe possibility of the summum bonum does not rest on any empirical\nprinciple, it follows that the deduction [legitimation] of this\nconcept must be transcendental. It is a priori (morally) necessary\nto produce the summum bonum by freedom of will: therefore the\ncondition of its possibility must rest solely on a priori principles\nof cognition.\nI. The Antinomy of Practical Reason.\n{BOOK_2|CHAPTER_2 ^paragraph 10}\nIn the summum bonum which is practical for us, i.e., to be\nrealized by our will, virtue and happiness are thought as\nnecessarily combined, so that the one cannot be assumed by pure\npractical reason without the other also being attached to it. Now this\ncombination (like every other) is either analytical or synthetical. It\nhas been shown that it cannot be analytical; it must then be\nsynthetical and, more particularly, must be conceived as the\nconnection of cause and effect, since it concerns a practical good,\ni.e., one that is possible by means of action; consequently either the\ndesire of happiness must be the motive to maxims of virtue, or the\nmaxim of virtue must be the efficient cause of happiness. The first is\nabsolutely impossible, because (as was proved in the Analytic)\nmaxims which place the determining principle of the will in the desire\nof personal happiness are not moral at all, and no virtue can be\nfounded on them. But the second is also impossible, because the\npractical connection of causes and effects in the world, as the result\nof the determination of the will, does not depend upon the moral\ndispositions of the will, but on the knowledge of the laws of nature\nand the physical power to use them for one's purposes; consequently we\ncannot expect in the world by the most punctilious observance of the\nmoral laws any necessary connection of happiness with virtue\nadequate to the summum bonum. Now, as the promotion of this summum\nbonum, the conception of which contains this connection, is a priori a\nnecessary object of our will and inseparably attached to the moral\nlaw, the impossibility of the former must prove the falsity of the\nlatter. If then the supreme good is not possible by practical rules,\nthen the moral law also which commands us to promote it is directed to\nvain imaginary ends and must consequently be false.\nII. Critical Solution of the Antinomy of Practical Reason.\nThe antinomy of pure speculative reason exhibits a similar\nconflict between freedom and physical necessity in the causality of\nevents in the world. It was solved by showing that there is no real\ncontradiction when the events and even the world in which they occur\nare regarded (as they ought to be) merely as appearances; since one\nand the same acting being, as an appearance (even to his own inner\nsense), has a causality in the world of sense that always conforms\nto the mechanism of nature, but with respect to the same events, so\nfar as the acting person regards himself at the same time as a\nnoumenon (as pure intelligence in an existence not dependent on the\ncondition of time), he can contain a principle by which that causality\nacting according to laws of nature is determined, but which is\nitself free from all laws of nature.\n{BOOK_2|CHAPTER_2 ^paragraph 15}\nIt is just the same with the foregoing antinomy of pure practical\nreason. The first of the two propositions, \"That the endeavour after\nhappiness produces a virtuous mind,\" is absolutely false; but the\nsecond, \"That a virtuous mind necessarily produces happiness,\" is\nnot absolutely false, but only in so far as virtue is considered as\na form of causality in the sensible world, and consequently only if\nI suppose existence in it to be the only sort of existence of a\nrational being; it is then only conditionally false. But as I am not\nonly justified in thinking that I exist also as a noumenon in a\nworld of the understanding, but even have in the moral law a purely\nintellectual determining principle of my causality (in the sensible\nworld), it is not impossible that morality of mind should have a\nconnection as cause with happiness (as an effect in the sensible\nworld) if not immediate yet mediate (viz., through an intelligent\nauthor of nature), and moreover necessary; while in a system of nature\nwhich is merely an object of the senses, this combination could\nnever occur except contingently and, therefore, could not suffice\nfor the summum bonum.\nThus, notwithstanding this seeming conflict of practical reason with\nitself, the summum bonum, which is the necessary supreme end of a will\nmorally determined, is a true object thereof; for it is practically\npossible, and the maxims of the will which as regards their matter\nrefer to it have objective reality, which at first was threatened by\nthe antinomy that appeared in the connection of morality with\nhappiness by a general law; but this was merely from a\nmisconception, because the relation between appearances was taken\nfor a relation of the things in themselves to these appearances.\nWhen we find ourselves obliged to go so far, namely, to the\nconnection with an intelligible world, to find the possibility of\nthe summum bonum, which reason points out to all rational beings as\nthe goal of all their moral wishes, it must seem strange that,\nnevertheless, the philosophers both of ancient and modern times have\nbeen able to find happiness in accurate proportion to virtue even in\nthis life (in the sensible world), or have persuaded themselves that\nthey were conscious thereof. For Epicurus as well as the Stoics\nextolled above everything the happiness that springs from the\nconsciousness of living virtuously; and the former was not so base\nin his practical precepts as one might infer from the principles of\nhis theory, which he used for explanation and not for action, or as\nthey were interpreted by many who were misled by his using the term\npleasure for contentment; on the contrary, he reckoned the most\ndisinterested practice of good amongst the ways of enjoying the most\nintimate delight, and his scheme of pleasure (by which he meant\nconstant cheerfulness of mind) included the moderation and control\nof the inclinations, such as the strictest moral philosopher might\nrequire. He differed from the Stoics chiefly in making this pleasure\nthe motive, which they very rightly refused to do. For, on the one\nhand, the virtuous Epicurus, like many well-intentioned men of this\nday who do not reflect deeply enough on their principles, fell into\nthe error of presupposing the virtuous disposition in the persons\nfor whom he wished to provide the springs to virtue (and indeed the\nupright man cannot be happy if he is not first conscious of his\nuprightness; since with such a character the reproach that his habit\nof thought would oblige him to make against himself in case of\ntransgression and his moral self-condemnation would rob him of all\nenjoyment of the pleasantness which his condition might otherwise\ncontain). But the question is: How is such a disposition possible in\nthe first instance, and such a habit of thought in estimating the\nworth of one's existence, since prior to it there can be in the\nsubject no feeling at all for moral worth? If a man is virtuous\nwithout being conscious of his integrity in every action, he will\ncertainly not enjoy life, however favourable fortune may be to him\nin its physical circumstances; but can we make him virtuous in the\nfirst instance, in other words, before he esteems the moral worth of\nhis existence so highly, by praising to him the peace of mind that\nwould result from the consciousness of an integrity for which he has\nno sense?\nOn the other hand, however, there is here an occasion of a vitium\nsubreptionis, and as it were of an optical illusion, in the\nself-consciousness of what one does as distinguished from what one\nfeels- an illusion which even the most experienced cannot altogether\navoid. The moral disposition of mind is necessarily combined with a\nconsciousness that the will is determined directly by the law. Now the\nconsciousness of a determination of the faculty of desire is always\nthe source of a satisfaction in the resulting action; but this\npleasure, this satisfaction in oneself, is not the determining\nprinciple of the action; on the contrary, the determination of the\nwill directly by reason is the source of the feeling of pleasure,\nand this remains a pure practical not sensible determination of the\nfaculty of desire. Now as this determination has exactly the same\neffect within in impelling to activity, that a feeling of the pleasure\nto be expected from the desired action would have had, we easily\nlook on what we ourselves do as something which we merely passively\nfeel, and take the moral spring for a sensible impulse, just as it\nhappens in the so-called illusion of the senses (in this case the\ninner sense). It is a sublime thing in human nature to be determined\nto actions immediately by a purely rational law; sublime even is the\nillusion that regards the subjective side of this capacity of\nintellectual determination as something sensible and the effect of a\nspecial sensible feeling (for an intellectual feeling would be a\ncontradiction). It is also of great importance to attend to this\nproperty of our personality and as much as possible to cultivate the\neffect of reason on this feeling. But we must beware lest by falsely\nextolling this moral determining principle as a spring, making its\nsource lie in particular feelings of pleasure (which are in fact\nonly results), we degrade and disfigure the true genuine spring, the\nlaw itself, by putting as it were a false foil upon it. Respect, not\npleasure or enjoyment of happiness, is something for which it is not\npossible that reason should have any antecedent feeling as its\nfoundation (for this would always be sensible and pathological); and\nconsciousness of immediate obligation of the will by the law is by\nno means analogous to the feeling of pleasure, although in relation to\nthe faculty of desire it produces the same effect, but from\ndifferent sources: it is only by this mode of conception, however,\nthat we can attain what we are seeking, namely, that actions be done\nnot merely in accordance with duty (as a result of pleasant feelings),\nbut from duty, which must be the true end of all moral cultivation.\nHave we not, however, a word which does not express enjoyment, as\nhappiness does, but indicates a satisfaction in one's existence, an\nanalogue of the happiness which must necessarily accompany the\nconsciousness of virtue? Yes this word is self-contentment which in\nits proper signification always designates only a negative\nsatisfaction in one's existence, in which one is conscious of\nneeding nothing. Freedom and the consciousness of it as a faculty of\nfollowing the moral law with unyielding resolution is independence\nof inclinations, at least as motives determining (though not as\naffecting) our desire, and so far as I am conscious of this freedom in\nfollowing my moral maxims, it is the only source of an unaltered\ncontentment which is necessarily connected with it and rests on no\nspecial feeling. This may be called intellectual contentment. The\nsensible contentment (improperly so-called) which rests on the\nsatisfaction of the inclinations, however delicate they may be\nimagined to be, can never be adequate to the conception of it. For the\ninclinations change, they grow with the indulgence shown them, and\nalways leave behind a still greater void than we had thought to\nfill. Hence they are always burdensome to a rational being, and,\nalthough he cannot lay them aside, they wrest from him the wish to\nbe rid of them. Even an inclination to what is right (e.g., to\nbeneficence), though it may much facilitate the efficacy of the\nmoral maxims, cannot produce any. For in these all must be directed to\nthe conception of the law as a determining principle, if the action is\nto contain morality and not merely legality. Inclination is blind\nand slavish, whether it be of a good sort or not, and, when morality\nis in question, reason must not play the part merely of guardian to\ninclination, but disregarding it altogether must attend simply to\nits own interest as pure practical reason. This very feeling of\ncompassion and tender sympathy, if it precedes the deliberation on the\nquestion of duty and becomes a determining principle, is even annoying\nto right thinking persons, brings their deliberate maxims into\nconfusion, and makes them wish to be delivered from it and to be\nsubject to lawgiving reason alone.\n{BOOK_2|CHAPTER_2 ^paragraph 20}\nFrom this we can understand how the consciousness of this faculty of\na pure practical reason produces by action (virtue) a consciousness of\nmastery over one's inclinations, and therefore of independence of\nthem, and consequently also of the discontent that always\naccompanies them, and thus a negative satisfaction with one's state,\ni.e., contentment, which is primarily contentment with one's own\nperson. Freedom itself becomes in this way (namely, indirectly)\ncapable of an enjoyment which cannot be called happiness, because it\ndoes not depend on the positive concurrence of a feeling, nor is it,\nstrictly speaking, bliss, since it does not include complete\nindependence of inclinations and wants, but it resembles bliss in so\nfar as the determination of one's will at least can hold itself free\nfrom their influence; and thus, at least in its origin, this enjoyment\nis analogous to the self-sufficiency which we can ascribe only to\nthe Supreme Being.\nFrom this solution of the antinomy of practical pure reason, it\nfollows that in practical principles we may at least conceive as\npossible a natural and necessary connection between the\nconsciousness of morality and the expectation of a proportionate\nhappiness as its result, though it does not follow that we can know or\nperceive this connection; that, on the other hand, principles of the\npursuit of happiness cannot possibly produce morality; that,\ntherefore, morality is the supreme good (as the first condition of the\nsummum bonum), while happiness constitutes its second element, but\nonly in such a way that it is the morally conditioned, but necessary\nconsequence of the former. Only with this subordination is the\nsummum bonum the whole object of pure practical reason, which must\nnecessarily conceive it as possible, since it commands us to\ncontribute to the utmost of our power to its realization. But since\nthe possibility of such connection of the conditioned with its\ncondition belongs wholly to the supersensual relation of things and\ncannot be given according to the laws of the world of sense,\nalthough the practical consequences of the idea belong to the world of\nsense, namely, the actions that aim at realizing the summum bonum;\nwe will therefore endeavour to set forth the grounds of that\npossibility, first, in respect of what is immediately in our power,\nand then, secondly, in that which is not in our power, but which\nreason presents to us as the supplement of our impotence, for the\nrealization of the summum bonum (which by practical principles is\nnecessary).\nIII. Of the Primacy of Pure Practical Reason in its\nUnion with the Speculative Reason.\n{BOOK_2|CHAPTER_2 ^paragraph 25}\nBy primacy between two or more things connected by reason, I\nunderstand the prerogative, belonging to one, of being the first\ndetermining principle in the connection with all the rest. In a\nnarrower practical sense it means the prerogative of the interest of\none in so far as the interest of the other is subordinated to it,\nwhile it is not postponed to any other. To every faculty of the mind\nwe can attribute an interest, that is, a principle, that contains\nthe condition on which alone the former is called into exercise.\nReason, as the faculty of principles, determines the interest of all\nthe powers of the mind and is determined by its own. The interest of\nits speculative employment consists in the cognition of the object\npushed to the highest a priori principles: that of its practical\nemployment, in the determination of the will in respect of the final\nand complete end. As to what is necessary for the possibility of any\nemployment of reason at all, namely, that its principles and\naffirmations should not contradict one another, this constitutes no\npart of its interest, but is the condition of having reason at all; it\nis only its development, not mere consistency with itself, that is\nreckoned as its interest.\nIf practical reason could not assume or think as given anything\nfurther than what speculative reason of itself could offer it from its\nown insight, the latter would have the primacy. But supposing that\nit had of itself original a priori principles with which certain\ntheoretical positions were inseparably connected, while these were\nwithdrawn from any possible insight of speculative reason (which,\nhowever, they must not contradict); then the question is: Which\ninterest is the superior (not which must give way, for they are not\nnecessarily conflicting), whether speculative reason, which knows\nnothing of all that the practical offers for its acceptance, should\ntake up these propositions and (although they transcend it) try to\nunite them with its own concepts as a foreign possession handed over\nto it, or whether it is justified in obstinately following its own\nseparate interest and, according to the canonic of Epicurus, rejecting\nas vain subtlety everything that cannot accredit its objective reality\nby manifest examples to be shown in experience, even though it\nshould be never so much interwoven with the interest of the\npractical (pure) use of reason, and in itself not contradictory to the\ntheoretical, merely because it infringes on the interest of the\nspeculative reason to this extent, that it removes the bounds which\nthis latter had set to itself, and gives it up to every nonsense or\ndelusion of imagination?\nIn fact, so far as practical reason is taken as dependent on\npathological conditions, that is, as merely regulating the\ninclinations under the sensible principle of happiness, we could not\nrequire speculative reason to take its principles from such a\nsource. Mohammed's paradise, or the absorption into the Deity of the\ntheosophists and mystics would press their monstrosities on the reason\naccording to the taste of each, and one might as well have no reason\nas surrender it in such fashion to all sorts of dreams. But if pure\nreason of itself can be practical and is actually so, as the\nconsciousness of the moral law proves, then it is still only one and\nthe same reason which, whether in a theoretical or a practical point\nof view, judges according to a priori principles; and then it is clear\nthat although it is in the first point of view incompetent to\nestablish certain propositions positively, which, however, do not\ncontradict it, then, as soon as these propositions are inseparably\nattached to the practical interest of pure reason, it must accept\nthem, though it be as something offered to it from a foreign source,\nsomething that has not grown on its own ground, but yet is\nsufficiently authenticated; and it must try to compare and connect\nthem with everything that it has in its power as speculative reason.\nIt must remember, however, that these are not additions to its\ninsight, but yet are extensions of its employment in another,\nnamely, a practical aspect; and this is not in the least opposed to\nits interest, which consists in the restriction of wild speculation.\nThus, when pure speculative and pure practical reason are combined\nin one cognition, the latter has the primacy, provided, namely, that\nthis combination is not contingent and arbitrary, but founded a priori\non reason itself and therefore necessary. For without this\nsubordination there would arise a conflict of reason with itself;\nsince, if they were merely co-ordinate, the former would close its\nboundaries strictly and admit nothing from the latter into its domain,\nwhile the latter would extend its bounds over everything and when\nits needs required would seek to embrace the former within them. Nor\ncould we reverse the order and require pure practical reason to be\nsubordinate to the speculative, since all interest is ultimately\npractical, and even that of speculative reason is conditional, and\nit is only in the practical employment of reason that it is complete.\n{BOOK_2|CHAPTER_2 ^paragraph 30}\nIV. The Immortality of the Soul as a Postulate of\nPure Practical Reason.\nThe realization of the summum bonum in the world is the necessary\nobject of a will determinable by the moral law. But in this will the\nperfect accordance of the mind with the moral law is the supreme\ncondition of the summum bonum. This then must be possible, as well\nas its object, since it is contained in the command to promote the\nlatter. Now, the perfect accordance of the will with the moral law\nis holiness, a perfection of which no rational being of the sensible\nworld is capable at any moment of his existence. Since,\nnevertheless, it is required as practically necessary, it can only\nbe found in a progress in infinitum towards that perfect accordance,\nand on the principles of pure practical reason it is necessary to\nassume such a practical progress as the real object of our will.\n{BOOK_2|CHAPTER_2 ^paragraph 35}\nNow, this endless progress is only possible on the supposition of an\nendless duration of the existence and personality of the same rational\nbeing (which is called the immortality of the soul). The summum bonum,\nthen, practically is only possible on the supposition of the\nimmortality of the soul; consequently this immortality, being\ninseparably connected with the moral law, is a postulate of pure\npractical reason (by which I mean a theoretical proposition, not\ndemonstrable as such, but which is an inseparable result of an\nunconditional a priori practical law.\nThis principle of the moral destination of our nature, namely,\nthat it is only in an endless progress that we can attain perfect\naccordance with the moral law, is of the greatest use, not merely\nfor the present purpose of supplementing the impotence of\nspeculative reason, but also with respect to religion. In default of\nit, either the moral law is quite degraded from its holiness, being\nmade out to be indulgent and conformable to our convenience, or else\nmen strain their notions of their vocation and their expectation to an\nunattainable goal, hoping to acquire complete holiness of will, and so\nthey lose themselves in fanatical theosophic dreams, which wholly\ncontradict self-knowledge. In both cases the unceasing effort to\nobey punctually and thoroughly a strict and inflexible command of\nreason, which yet is not ideal but real, is only hindered. For a\nrational but finite being, the only thing possible is an endless\nprogress from the lower to higher degrees of moral perfection. The\nInfinite Being, to whom the condition of time is nothing, sees in this\nto us endless succession a whole of accordance with the moral law; and\nthe holiness which his command inexorably requires, in order to be\ntrue to his justice in the share which He assigns to each in the\nsummum bonum, is to be found in a single intellectual intuition of the\nwhole existence of rational beings. All that can be expected of the\ncreature in respect of the hope of this participation would be the\nconsciousness of his tried character, by which from the progress he\nhas hitherto made from the worse to the morally better, and the\nimmutability of purpose which has thus become known to him, he may\nhope for a further unbroken continuance of the same, however long\nhis existence may last, even beyond this life, * and thus he may\nhope, not indeed here, nor in any imaginable point of his future\nexistence, but only in the endlessness of his duration (which God\nalone can survey) to be perfectly adequate to his will (without\nindulgence or excuse, which do not harmonize with justice).\n* It seems, nevertheless, impossible for a creature to have the\nconviction of his unwavering firmness of mind in the progress\ntowards goodness. On this account the Christian religion makes it come\nonly from the same Spirit that works sanctification, that is, this\nfirm purpose, and with it the consciousness of steadfastness in the\nmoral progress. But naturally one who is conscious that he has\npersevered through a long portion of his life up to the end in the\nprogress to the better, and this genuine moral motives, may well\nhave the comforting hope, though not the certainty, that even in an\nexistence prolonged beyond this life he will continue in these\nprinciples; and although he is never justified here in his own eyes,\nnor can ever hope to be so in the increased perfection of his\nnature, to which he looks forward, together with an increase of\nduties, nevertheless in this progress which, though it is directed\nto a goal infinitely remote, yet is in God's sight regarded as\nequivalent to possession, he may have a prospect of a blessed\nfuture; for this is the word that reason employs to designate\nperfect well-being independent of all contingent causes of the\nworld, and which, like holiness, is an idea that can be contained only\nin an endless progress and its totality, and consequently is never\nfully attained by a creature.\n{BOOK_2|CHAPTER_2 ^paragraph 40}\nV. The Existence of God as a Postulate of Pure Practical Reason.\nIn the foregoing analysis the moral law led to a practical problem\nwhich is prescribed by pure reason alone, without the aid of any\nsensible motives, namely, that of the necessary completeness of the\nfirst and principle element of the summum bonum, viz., morality;\nand, as this can be perfectly solved only in eternity, to the\npostulate of immortality. The same law must also lead us to affirm the\npossibility of the second element of the summum bonum, viz., happiness\nproportioned to that morality, and this on grounds as disinterested as\nbefore, and solely from impartial reason; that is, it must lead to the\nsupposition of the existence of a cause adequate to this effect; in\nother words, it must postulate the existence of God, as the\nnecessary condition of the possibility of the summum bonum (an\nobject of the will which is necessarily connected with the moral\nlegislation of pure reason). We proceed to exhibit this connection\nin a convincing manner.\nHappiness is the condition of a rational being in the world with\nwhom everything goes according to his wish and will; it rests,\ntherefore, on the harmony of physical nature with his whole end and\nlikewise with the essential determining principle of his will. Now the\nmoral law as a law of freedom commands by determining principles,\nwhich ought to be quite independent of nature and of its harmony\nwith our faculty of desire (as springs). But the acting rational being\nin the world is not the cause of the world and of nature itself. There\nis not the least ground, therefore, in the moral law for a necessary\nconnection between morality and proportionate happiness in a being\nthat belongs to the world as part of it, and therefore dependent on\nit, and which for that reason cannot by his will be a cause of this\nnature, nor by his own power make it thoroughly harmonize, as far as\nhis happiness is concerned, with his practical principles.\nNevertheless, in the practical problem of pure reason, i.e., the\nnecessary pursuit of the summum bonum, such a connection is postulated\nas necessary: we ought to endeavour to promote the summum bonum,\nwhich, therefore, must be possible. Accordingly, the existence of a\ncause of all nature, distinct from nature itself and containing the\nprinciple of this connection, namely, of the exact harmony of\nhappiness with morality, is also postulated. Now this supreme cause\nmust contain the principle of the harmony of nature, not merely with a\nlaw of the will of rational beings, but with the conception of this\nlaw, in so far as they make it the supreme determining principle of\nthe will, and consequently not merely with the form of morals, but\nwith their morality as their motive, that is, with their moral\ncharacter. Therefore, the summum bonum is possible in the world only\non the supposition of a Supreme Being having a causality corresponding\nto moral character. Now a being that is capable of acting on the\nconception of laws is an intelligence (a rational being), and the\ncausality of such a being according to this conception of laws is\nhis will; therefore the supreme cause of nature, which must be\npresupposed as a condition of the summum bonum is a being which is the\ncause of nature by intelligence and will, consequently its author,\nthat is God. It follows that the postulate of the possibility of the\nhighest derived good (the best world) is likewise the postulate of the\nreality of a highest original good, that is to say, of the existence\nof God. Now it was seen to be a duty for us to promote the summum\nbonum; consequently it is not merely allowable, but it is a\nnecessity connected with duty as a requisite, that we should\npresuppose the possibility of this summum bonum; and as this is\npossible only on condition of the existence of God, it inseparably\nconnects the supposition of this with duty; that is, it is morally\nnecessary to assume the existence of God.\nIt must be remarked here that this moral necessity is subjective,\nthat is, it is a want, and not objective, that is, itself a duty,\nfor there cannot be a duty to suppose the existence of anything (since\nthis concerns only the theoretical employment of reason). Moreover, it\nis not meant by this that it is necessary to suppose the existence\nof God as a basis of all obligation in general (for this rests, as has\nbeen sufficiently proved, simply on the autonomy of reason itself).\nWhat belongs to duty here is only the endeavour to realize and promote\nthe summum bonum in the world, the possibility of which can\ntherefore be postulated; and as our reason finds it not conceivable\nexcept on the supposition of a supreme intelligence, the admission\nof this existence is therefore connected with the consciousness of our\nduty, although the admission itself belongs to the domain of\nspeculative reason. Considered in respect of this alone, as a\nprinciple of explanation, it may be called a hypothesis, but in\nreference to the intelligibility of an object given us by the moral\nlaw (the summum bonum), and consequently of a requirement for\npractical purposes, it may be called faith, that is to say a pure\nrational faith, since pure reason (both in its theoretical and\npractical use) is the sole source from which it springs.\n{BOOK_2|CHAPTER_2 ^paragraph 45}\nFrom this deduction it is now intelligible why the Greek schools\ncould never attain the solution of their problem of the practical\npossibility of the summum bonum, because they made the rule of the use\nwhich the will of man makes of his freedom the sole and sufficient\nground of this possibility, thinking that they had no need for that\npurpose of the existence of God. No doubt they were so far right\nthat they established the principle of morals of itself\nindependently of this postulate, from the relation of reason only to\nthe will, and consequently made it the supreme practical condition\nof the summum bonum; but it was not therefore the whole condition of\nits possibility. The Epicureans had indeed assumed as the supreme\nprinciple of morality a wholly false one, namely that of happiness,\nand had substituted for a law a maxim of arbitrary choice according to\nevery man's inclination; they proceeded, however, consistently\nenough in this, that they degraded their summum bonum likewise, just\nin proportion to the meanness of their fundamental principle, and\nlooked for no greater happiness than can be attained by human prudence\n(including temperance and moderation of the inclinations), and this as\nwe know would be scanty enough and would be very different according\nto circumstances; not to mention the exceptions that their maxims must\nperpetually admit and which make them incapable of being laws. The\nStoics, on the contrary, had chosen their supreme practical\nprinciple quite rightly, making virtue the condition of the summum\nbonum; but when they represented the degree of virtue required by\nits pure law as fully attainable in this life, they not only\nstrained the moral powers of the man whom they called the wise\nbeyond all the limits of his nature, and assumed a thing that\ncontradicts all our knowledge of men, but also and principally they\nwould not allow the second element of the summum bonum, namely,\nhappiness, to be properly a special object of human desire, but made\ntheir wise man, like a divinity in his consciousness of the excellence\nof his person, wholly independent of nature (as regards his own\ncontentment); they exposed him indeed to the evils of life, but made\nhim not subject to them (at the same time representing him also as\nfree from moral evil). They thus, in fact, left out the second element\nof the summum bonum namely, personal happiness, placing it solely in\naction and satisfaction with one's own personal worth, thus\nincluding it in the consciousness of being morally minded, in which\nthey Might have been sufficiently refuted by the voice of their own\nnature.\nThe doctrine of Christianity, * even if we do not yet consider it\nas a religious doctrine, gives, touching this point, a conception of\nthe summum bonum (the kingdom of God), which alone satisfies the\nstrictest demand of practical reason. The moral law is holy\n(unyielding) and demands holiness of morals, although all the moral\nperfection to which man can attain is still only virtue, that is, a\nrightful disposition arising from respect for the law, implying\nconsciousness of a constant propensity to transgression, or at least a\nwant of purity, that is, a mixture of many spurious (not moral)\nmotives of obedience to the law, consequently a self-esteem combined\nwith humility. In respect, then, of the holiness which the Christian\nlaw requires, this leaves the creature nothing but a progress in\ninfinitum, but for that very reason it justifies him in hoping for\nan endless duration of his existence. The worth of a character\nperfectly accordant with the moral law is infinite, since the only\nrestriction on all possible happiness in the judgement of a wise and\nall powerful distributor of it is the absence of conformity of\nrational beings to their duty. But the moral law of itself does not\npromise any happiness, for according to our conceptions of an order of\nnature in general, this is not necessarily connected with obedience to\nthe law. Now Christian morality supplies this defect (of the second\nindispensable element of the summum bonum) by representing the world\nin which rational beings devote themselves with all their soul to\nthe moral law, as a kingdom of God, in which nature and morality are\nbrought into a harmony foreign to each of itself, by a holy Author who\nmakes the derived summum bonum possible. Holiness of life is\nprescribed to them as a rule even in this life, while the welfare\nproportioned to it, namely, bliss, is represented as attainable only\nin an eternity; because the former must always be the pattern of their\nconduct in every state, and progress towards it is already possible\nand necessary in this life; while the latter, under the name of\nhappiness, cannot be attained at all in this world (so far as our\nown power is concerned), and therefore is made simply an object of\nhope. Nevertheless, the Christian principle of morality itself is\nnot theological (so as to be heteronomy), but is autonomy of pure\npractical reason, since it does not make the knowledge of God and\nHis will the foundation of these laws, but only of the attainment of\nthe summum bonum, on condition of following these laws, and it does\nnot even place the proper spring of this obedience in the desired\nresults, but solely in the conception of duty, as that of which the\nfaithful observance alone constitutes the worthiness to obtain those\nhappy consequences.\n* It is commonly held that the Christian precept of morality has no\nadvantage in respect of purity over the moral conceptions of the\nStoics; the distinction between them is, however, very obvious. The\nStoic system made the consciousness of strength of mind the pivot on\nwhich all moral dispositions should turn; and although its disciples\nspoke of duties and even defined them very well, yet they placed the\nspring and proper determining principle of the will in an elevation of\nthe mind above the lower springs of the senses, which owe their\npower only to weakness of mind. With them therefore, virtue was a sort\nof heroism in the wise man raising himself above the animal nature\nof man, is sufficient for Himself, and, while he prescribes duties\nto others, is himself raised above them, and is not subject to any\ntemptation to transgress the moral law. All this, however, they\ncould not have done if they had conceived this law in all its purity\nand strictness, as the precept of the Gospel does. When I give the\nname idea to a perfection to which nothing adequate can be given in\nexperience, it does not follow that the moral ideas are thing\ntranscendent, that is something of which we could not even determine\nthe concept adequately, or of which it is uncertain whether there is\nany object corresponding to it at all, as is the case with the ideas\nof speculative reason; on the contrary, being types of practical\nperfection, they serve as the indispensable rule of conduct and\nlikewise as the standard of comparison. Now if I consider Christian\nmorals on their philosophical side, then compared with the ideas of\nthe Greek schools, they would appear as follows: the ideas of the\nCynics, the Epicureans, the Stoics, and the Christians are: simplicity\nof nature, prudence, wisdom, and holiness. In respect of the way of\nattaining them, the Greek schools were distinguished from one\nanother thus that the Cynics only required common sense, the others\nthe path of science, but both found the mere use of natural powers\nsufficient for the purpose. Christian morality, because its precept is\nframed (as a moral precept must be) so pure and unyielding, takes from\nman all confidence that he can be fully adequate to it, at least in\nthis life, but again sets it up by enabling us to hope that if we\nact as well as it is in our power to do, then what is not in our power\nwill come in to our aid from another source, whether we know how\nthis may be or not. Aristotle and Plato differed only as to the origin\nof our moral conceptions.\n{BOOK_2|CHAPTER_2 ^paragraph 50}\nIn this manner, the moral laws lead through the conception of the\nsummum bonum as the object and final end of pure practical reason to\nreligion, that is, to the recognition of all duties as divine\ncommands, not as sanctions, that is to say, arbitrary ordinances of\na foreign and contingent in themselves, but as essential laws of every\nfree will in itself, which, nevertheless, must be regarded as commands\nof the Supreme Being, because it is only from a morally perfect\n(holy and good) and at the same time all-powerful will, and\nconsequently only through harmony with this will, that we can hope\nto attain the summum bonum which the moral law makes it our duty to\ntake as the object of our endeavours. Here again, then, all remains\ndisinterested and founded merely on duty; neither fear nor hope\nbeing made the fundamental springs, which if taken as principles would\ndestroy the whole moral worth of actions. The moral law commands me to\nmake the highest possible good in a world the ultimate object of all\nmy conduct. But I cannot hope to effect this otherwise than by the\nharmony of my will with that of a holy and good Author of the world;\nand although the conception of the summum bonum as a whole, in which\nthe greatest happiness is conceived as combined in the most exact\nproportion with the highest degree of moral perfection (possible in\ncreatures), includes my own happiness, yet it is not this that is\nthe determining principle of the will which is enjoined to promote the\nsummum bonum, but the moral law, which, on the contrary, limits by\nstrict conditions my unbounded desire of happiness.\nHence also morality is not properly the doctrine how we should\nmake ourselves happy, but how we should become worthy of happiness. It\nis only when religion is added that there also comes in the hope of\nparticipating some day in happiness in proportion as we have\nendeavoured to be not unworthy of it.\nA man is worthy to possess a thing or a state when his possession of\nit is in harmony with the summum bonum. We can now easily see that all\nworthiness depends on moral conduct, since in the conception of the\nsummum bonum this constitutes the condition of the rest (which belongs\nto one's state), namely, the participation of happiness. Now it\nfollows from this that morality should never be treated as a\ndoctrine of happiness, that is, an instruction how to become happy;\nfor it has to do simply with the rational condition (conditio sine qua\nnon) of happiness, not with the means of attaining it. But when\nmorality has been completely expounded (which merely imposes duties\ninstead of providing rules for selfish desires), then first, after the\nmoral desire to promote the summum bonum (to bring the kingdom of\nGod to us) has been awakened, a desire founded on a law, and which\ncould not previously arise in any selfish mind, and when for the\nbehoof of this desire the step to religion has been taken, then this\nethical doctrine may be also called a doctrine of happiness because\nthe hope of happiness first begins with religion only.\nWe can also see from this that, when we ask what is God's ultimate\nend in creating the world, we must not name the happiness of the\nrational beings in it, but the summum bonum, which adds a further\ncondition to that wish of such beings, namely, the condition of\nbeing worthy of happiness, that is, the morality of these same\nrational beings, a condition which alone contains the rule by which\nonly they can hope to share in the former at the hand of a wise\nAuthor. For as wisdom, theoretically considered, signifies the\nknowledge of the summum bonum and, practically, the accordance of\nthe will with the summum bonum, we cannot attribute to a supreme\nindependent wisdom an end based merely on goodness. For we cannot\nconceive the action of this goodness (in respect of the happiness of\nrational beings) as suitable to the highest original good, except\nunder the restrictive conditions of harmony with the holiness * of\nhis will. Therefore, those who placed the end of creation in the glory\nof God (provided that this is not conceived anthropomorphically as a\ndesire to be praised) have perhaps hit upon the best expression. For\nnothing glorifies God more than that which is the most estimable thing\nin the world, respect for his command, the observance of the holy duty\nthat his law imposes on us, when there is added thereto his glorious\nplan of crowning such a beautiful order of things with corresponding\nhappiness. If the latter (to speak humanly) makes Him worthy of\nlove, by the former He is an object of adoration. Even men can never\nacquire respect by benevolence alone, though they may gain love, so\nthat the greatest beneficence only procures them honour when it is\nregulated by worthiness.\n{BOOK_2|CHAPTER_2 ^paragraph 55}\n* In order to make these characteristics of these conceptions\nclear, I add the remark that whilst we ascribe to God various\nattributes, the quality of which we also find applicable to creatures,\nonly that in Him they are raised to the highest degree, e.g., power,\nknowledge, presence, goodness, etc., under the designations of\nomnipotence, omniscience, omnipresence, etc., there are three that are\nascribed to God exclusively, and yet without the addition of\ngreatness, and which are all moral He is the only holy, the only\nblessed, the only wise, because these conceptions already imply the\nabsence of limitation. In the order of these attributes He is also the\nholy lawgiver (and creator), the good governor (and preserver) and the\njust judge, three attributes which include everything by which God\nis the object of religion, and in conformity with which the\nmetaphysical perfections are added of themselves in the reason.\nThat in the order of ends, man (and with him every rational being)\nis an end in himself, that is, that he can never be used merely as a\nmeans by any (not even by God) without being at the same time an end\nalso himself, that therefore humanity in our person must be holy to\nourselves, this follows now of itself because he is the subject of the\nmoral law, in other words, of that which is holy in itself, and on\naccount of which and in agreement with which alone can anything be\ntermed holy. For this moral law is founded on the autonomy of his\nwill, as a free will which by its universal laws must necessarily be\nable to agree with that to which it is to submit itself.\nVI. Of the Postulates of Pure Practical Reason Generally.\n{BOOK_2|CHAPTER_2 ^paragraph 60}\nThey all proceed from the principle of morality, which is not a\npostulate but a law, by which reason determines the will directly,\nwhich will, because it is so determined as a pure will, requires these\nnecessary conditions of obedience to its precept. These postulates are\nnot theoretical dogmas but, suppositions practically necessary;\nwhile then they do [not] extend our speculative knowledge, they give\nobjective reality to the ideas of speculative reason in general (by\nmeans of their reference to what is practical), and give it a right to\nconcepts, the possibility even of which it could not otherwise venture\nto affirm.\nThese postulates are those of immortality, freedom positively\nconsidered (as the causality of a being so far as he belongs to the\nintelligible world), and the existence of God. The first results\nfrom the practically necessary condition of a duration adequate to the\ncomplete fulfilment of the moral law; the second from the necessary\nsupposition of independence of the sensible world, and of the\nfaculty of determining one's will according to the law of an\nintelligible world, that is, of freedom; the third from the\nnecessary condition of the existence of the summum bonum in such an\nintelligible world, by the supposition of the supreme independent\ngood, that is, the existence of God.\nThus the fact that respect for the moral law necessarily makes the\nsummum bonum an object of our endeavours, and the supposition thence\nresulting of its objective reality, lead through the postulates of\npractical reason to conceptions which speculative reason might\nindeed present as problems, but could never solve. Thus it leads: 1.\nTo that one in the solution of which the latter could do nothing but\ncommit paralogisms (namely, that of immortality), because it could not\nlay hold of the character of permanence, by which to complete the\npsychological conception of an ultimate subject necessarily ascribed\nto the soul in self-consciousness, so as to make it the real\nconception of a substance, a character which practical reason\nfurnishes by the postulate of a duration required for accordance\nwith the moral law in the summum bonum, which is the whole end of\npractical reason. 2. It leads to that of which speculative reason\ncontained nothing but antinomy, the solution of which it could only\nfound on a notion problematically conceivable indeed, but whose\nobjective reality it could not prove or determine, namely, the\ncosmological idea of an intelligible world and the consciousness of\nour existence in it, by means of the postulate of freedom (the reality\nof which it lays down by virtue of the moral law), and with it\nlikewise the law of an intelligible world, to which speculative reason\ncould only point, but could not define its conception. 3. What\nspeculative reason was able to think, but was obliged to leave\nundetermined as a mere transcendental ideal, viz., the theological\nconception of the first Being, to this it gives significance (in a\npractical view, that is, as a condition of the possibility of the\nobject of a will determined by that law), namely, as the supreme\nprinciple of the summum bonum in an intelligible world, by means of\nmoral legislation in it invested with sovereign power.\nIs our knowledge, however, actually extended in this way by pure\npractical reason, and is that immanent in practical reason which for\nthe speculative was only transcendent? Certainly, but only in a\npractical point of view. For we do not thereby take knowledge of the\nnature of our souls, nor of the intelligible world, nor of the Supreme\nBeing, with respect to what they are in themselves, but we have merely\ncombined the conceptions of them in the practical concept of the\nsummum bonum as the object of our will, and this altogether a\npriori, but only by means of the moral law, and merely in reference to\nit, in respect of the object which it commands. But how freedom is\npossible, and how we are to conceive this kind of causality\ntheoretically and positively, is not thereby discovered; but only that\nthere is such a causality is postulated by the moral law and in its\nbehoof. It is the same with the remaining ideas, the possibility of\nwhich no human intelligence will ever fathom, but the truth of\nwhich, on the other hand, no sophistry will ever wrest from the\nconviction even of the commonest man.\n{BOOK_2|CHAPTER_2 ^paragraph 65}\nVII. How is it possible to conceive an Extension of Pure\nReason in a Practical point of view, without its\nKnowledge as Speculative being enlarged at\nthe same time?\n{BOOK_2|CHAPTER_2 ^paragraph 70}\nIn order not to be too abstract, we will answer this question at\nonce in its application to the present case. In order to extend a pure\ncognition practically, there must be an a priori purpose given, that\nis, an end as object (of the will), which independently of all\ntheological principle is presented as practically necessary by an\nimperative which determines the will directly (a categorical\nimperative), and in this case that is the summum bonum. This, however,\nis not possible without presupposing three theoretical conceptions\n(for which, because they are mere conceptions of pure reason, no\ncorresponding intuition can be found, nor consequently by the path\nof theory any objective reality); namely, freedom, immortality, and\nGod. Thus by the practical law which commands the existence of the\nhighest good possible in a world, the possibility of those objects\nof pure speculative reason is postulated, and the objective reality\nwhich the latter could not assure them. By this the theoretical\nknowledge of pure reason does indeed obtain an accession; but it\nconsists only in this, that those concepts which otherwise it had to\nlook upon as problematical (merely thinkable) concepts, are now\nshown assertorially to be such as actually have objects; because\npractical reason indispensably requires their existence for the\npossibility of its object, the summum bonum, which practically is\nabsolutely necessary, and this justifies theoretical reason in\nassuming them. But this extension of theoretical reason is no\nextension of speculative, that is, we cannot make any positive use\nof it in a theoretical point of view. For as nothing is accomplished\nin this by practical reason, further than that these concepts are real\nand actually have their (possible) objects, and nothing in the way\nof intuition of them is given thereby (which indeed could not be\ndemanded), hence the admission of this reality does not render any\nsynthetical proposition possible. Consequently, this discovery does\nnot in the least help us to extend this knowledge of ours in a\nspeculative point of view, although it does in respect of the\npractical employment of pure reason. The above three ideas of\nspeculative reason are still in themselves not cognitions; they are\nhowever (transcendent) thoughts, in which there is nothing impossible.\nNow, by help of an apodeictic practical law, being necessary\nconditions of that which it commands to be made an object, they\nacquire objective reality; that is, we learn from it that they have\nobjects, without being able to point out how the conception of them is\nrelated to an object, and this, too, is still not a cognition of these\nobjects; for we cannot thereby form any synthetical judgement about\nthem, nor determine their application theoretically; consequently,\nwe can make no theoretical rational use of them at all, in which use\nall speculative knowledge of reason consists. Nevertheless, the\ntheoretical knowledge, not indeed of these objects, but of reason\ngenerally, is so far enlarged by this, that by the practical\npostulates objects were given to those ideas, a merely problematical\nthought having by this means first acquired objective reality. There\nis therefore no extension of the knowledge of given supersensible\nobjects, but an extension of theoretical reason and of its knowledge\nin respect of the supersensible generally; inasmuch as it is compelled\nto admit that there are such objects, although it is not able to\ndefine them more closely, so as itself to extend this knowledge of the\nobjects (which have now been given it on practical grounds, and only\nfor practical use). For this accession, then, pure theoretical reason,\nfor which all those ideas are transcendent and without object, has\nsimply to thank its practical faculty. In this they become immanent\nand constitutive, being the source of the possibility of realizing the\nnecessary object of pure practical reason (the summum bonum);\nwhereas apart from this they are transcendent, and merely regulative\nprinciples of speculative reason, which do not require it to assume\na new object beyond experience, but only to bring its use in\nexperience nearer to completeness. But when once reason is in\npossession of this accession, it will go to work with these ideas as\nspeculative reason (properly only to assure the certainty of its\npractical use) in a negative manner: that is, not extending but\nclearing up its knowledge so as on one side to keep off\nanthropomorphism, as the source of superstition, or seeming\nextension of these conceptions by supposed experience; and on the\nother side fanaticism, which promises the same by means of\nsupersensible intuition or feelings of the like kind. All these are\nhindrances to the practical use of pure reason, so that the removal of\nthem may certainly be considered an extension of our knowledge in a\npractical point of view, without contradicting the admission that\nfor speculative purposes reason has not in the least gained by this.\nEvery employment of reason in respect of an object requires pure\nconcepts of the understanding (categories), without which no object\ncan be conceived. These can be applied to the theoretical employment\nof reason, i.e., to that kind of knowledge, only in case an\nintuition (which is always sensible) is taken as a basis, and\ntherefore merely in order to conceive by means of- them an object of\npossible experience. Now here what have to be thought by means of\nthe categories in order to be known are ideas of reason, which\ncannot be given in any experience. Only we are not here concerned with\nthe theoretical knowledge of the objects of these ideas, but only with\nthis, whether they have objects at all. This reality is supplied by\npure practical reason, and theoretical reason has nothing further to\ndo in this but to think those objects by means of categories. This, as\nwe have elsewhere clearly shown, can be done well enough without\nneeding any intuition (either sensible or supersensible) because the\ncategories have their seat and origin in the pure understanding,\nsimply as the faculty of thought, before and independently of any\nintuition, and they always only signify an object in general, no\nmatter in what way it may be given to us. Now when the categories\nare to be applied to these ideas, it is not possible to give them\nany object in intuition; but that such an object actually exists,\nand consequently that the category as a mere form of thought is here\nnot empty but has significance, this is sufficiently assured them by\nan object which practical reason presents beyond doubt in the\nconcept of the summum bonum, the reality of the conceptions which\nare required for the possibility of the summum bonum; without,\nhowever, effecting by this accession the least extension of our\nknowledge on theoretical principles.\nWhen these ideas of God, of an intelligible world (the kingdom of\nGod), and of immortality are further determined by predicates taken\nfrom our own nature, we must not regard this determination as a\nsensualizing of those pure rational ideas (anthropomorphism), nor as a\ntranscendent knowledge of supersensible objects; for these\npredicates are no others than understanding and will, considered too\nin the relation to each other in which they must be conceived in the\nmoral law, and therefore, only so far as a pure practical use is\nmade of them. As to all the rest that belongs to these conceptions\npsychologically, that is, so far as we observe these faculties of ours\nempirically in their exercise (e.g., that the understanding of man\nis discursive, and its notions therefore not intuitions but\nthoughts, that these follow one another in time, that his will has its\nsatisfaction always dependent on the existence of its object, etc.,\nwhich cannot be the case in the Supreme Being), from all this we\nabstract in that case, and then there remains of the notions by\nwhich we conceive a pure intelligence nothing more than just what is\nrequired for the possibility of conceiving a moral law. There is\nthen a knowledge of God indeed, but only for practical purposes,\nand, if we attempt to extend it to a theoretical knowledge, we find an\nunderstanding that has intuitions, not thoughts, a will that is\ndirected to objects on the existence of which its satisfaction does\nnot in the least depend (not to mention the transcendental predicates,\nas, for example, a magnitude of existence, that is duration, which,\nhowever, is not in time, the only possible means we have of conceiving\nexistence as magnitude). Now these are all attributes of which we\ncan form no conception that would help to the knowledge of the object,\nand we learn from this that they can never be used for a theory of\nsupersensible beings, so that on this side they are quite incapable of\nbeing the foundation of a speculative knowledge, and their use is\nlimited simply to the practice of the moral law.\n{BOOK_2|CHAPTER_2 ^paragraph 75}\nThis last is so obvious, and can be proved so clearly by fact,\nthat we may confidently challenge all pretended natural theologians (a\nsingular name) * to specify (over and above the merely ontological\npredicates) one single attribute, whether of the understanding or of\nthe will, determining this object of theirs, of which we could not\nshow incontrovertibly that, if we abstract from it everything\nanthropomorphic, nothing would remain to us but the mere word, without\nour being able to connect with it the smallest notion by which we\ncould hope for an extension of theoretical knowledge. But as to the\npractical, there still remains to us of the attributes of\nunderstanding and will the conception of a relation to which objective\nreality is given by the practical law (which determines a priori\nprecisely this relation of the understanding to the will). When once\nthis is done, then reality is given to the conception of the object of\na will morally determined (the conception of the summum bonum), and\nwith it to the conditions of its possibility, the ideas of God,\nfreedom, and immortality, but always only relatively to the practice\nof the moral law (and not for any speculative purpose).\n* Learning is properly only the whole content of the historical\nsciences. Consequently it is only the teacher of revealed theology\nthat can be called a learned theologian. If, however, we choose to\ncall a man learned who is in possession of the rational sciences\n(mathematics and philosophy), although even this would be contrary\nto the signification of the word (which always counts as learning only\nthat which one must be \"learned\" and which, therefore, he cannot\ndiscover of himself by reason), even in that case the philosopher\nwould make too poor a figure with his knowledge of God as a positive\nscience to let himself be called on that account a learned man.\nAccording to these remarks it is now easy to find the answer to\nthe weighty question whether the notion of God is one belonging to\nphysics (and therefore also to metaphysics, which contains the pure\na priori principles of the former in their universal import) or to\nmorals. If we have recourse to God as the Author of all things, in\norder to explain the arrangements of nature or its changes, this is at\nleast not a physical explanation, and is a complete confession that\nour philosophy has come to an end, since we are obliged to assume\nsomething of which in itself we have otherwise no conception, in order\nto be able to frame a conception of the possibility of what we see\nbefore our eyes. Metaphysics, however, cannot enable us to attain by\ncertain inference from the knowledge of this world to the conception\nof God and to the proof of His existence, for this reason, that in\norder to say that this world could be produced only by a God\n(according to the conception implied by this word) we should know this\nworld as the most perfect whole possible; and for this purpose\nshould also know all possible worlds (in order to be able to compare\nthem with this); in other words, we should be omniscient. It is\nabsolutely impossible, however, to know the existence of this Being\nfrom mere concepts, because every existential proposition, that is,\nevery proposition that affirms the existence of a being of which I\nframe a concept, is a synthetic proposition, that is, one by which I\ngo beyond that conception and affirm of it more than was thought in\nthe conception itself; namely, that this concept in the\nunderstanding has an object corresponding to it outside the\nunderstanding, and this it is obviously impossible to elicit by any\nreasoning. There remains, therefore, only one single process\npossible for reason to attain this knowledge, namely, to start from\nthe supreme principle of its pure practical use (which in every case\nis directed simply to the existence of something as a consequence of\nreason) and thus determine its object. Then its inevitable problem,\nnamely, the necessary direction of the will to the summum bonum,\ndiscovers to us not only the necessity of assuming such a First\nBeing in reference to the possibility of this good in the world,\nbut, what is most remarkable, something which reason in its progress\non the path of physical nature altogether failed to find, namely, an\naccurately defined conception of this First Being. As we can know only\na small part of this world, and can still less compare it with all\npossible worlds, we may indeed from its order, design, and\ngreatness, infer a wise, good, powerful, etc., Author of it, but not\nthat He is all-wise, all-good, all-powerful, etc. It may indeed very\nwell be granted that we should be justified in supplying this\ninevitable defect by a legitimate and reasonable hypothesis; namely,\nthat when wisdom, goodness, etc, are displayed in all the parts that\noffer themselves to our nearer knowledge, it is just the same in all\nthe rest, and that it would therefore be reasonable to ascribe all\npossible perfections to the Author of the world, but these are not\nstrict logical inferences in which we can pride ourselves on our\ninsight, but only permitted conclusions in which we may be indulged\nand which require further recommendation before we can make use of\nthem. On the path of empirical inquiry then (physics), the\nconception of God remains always a conception of the perfection of the\nFirst Being not accurately enough determined to be held adequate to\nthe conception of Deity. (With metaphysic in its transcendental part\nnothing whatever can be accomplished.)\n{BOOK_2|CHAPTER_2 ^paragraph 80}\nWhen I now try to test this conception by reference to the object of\npractical reason, I find that the moral principle admits as possible\nonly the conception of an Author of the world possessed of the highest\nperfection. He must be omniscient, in order to know my conduct up to\nthe inmost root of my mental state in all possible cases and into\nall future time; omnipotent, in order to allot to it its fitting\nconsequences; similarly He must be omnipresent, eternal, etc. Thus the\nmoral law, by means of the conception of the summum bonum as the\nobject of a pure practical reason, determines the concept of the First\nBeing as the Supreme Being; a thing which the physical (and in its\nhigher development the metaphysical), in other words, the whole\nspeculative course of reason, was unable to effect. The conception\nof God, then, is one that belongs originally not to physics, i.e.,\nto speculative reason, but to morals. The same may be said of the\nother conceptions of reason of which we have treated above as\npostulates of it in its practical use.\nIn the history of Grecian philosophy we find no distinct traces of a\npure rational theology earlier than Anaxagoras; but this is not\nbecause the older philosophers had not intelligence or penetration\nenough to raise themselves to it by the path of speculation, at\nleast with the aid of a thoroughly reasonable hypothesis. What could\nhave been easier, what more natural, than the thought which of\nitself occurs to everyone, to assume instead of several causes of\nthe world, instead of an indeterminate degree of perfection, a\nsingle rational cause having all perfection? But the evils in the\nworld seemed to them to be much too serious objections to allow them\nto feel themselves justified in such a hypothesis. They showed\nintelligence and penetration then in this very point, that they did\nnot allow themselves to adopt it, but on the contrary looked about\namongst natural causes to see if they could not find in them the\nqualities and power required for a First Being. But when this acute\npeople had advanced so far in their investigations of nature as to\ntreat even moral questions philosophically, on which other nations had\nnever done anything but talk, then first they found a new and\npractical want, which did not fail to give definiteness to their\nconception of the First Being: and in this the speculative reason\nplayed the part of spectator, or at best had the merit of embellishing\na conception that had not grown on its own ground, and of applying a\nseries of confirmations from the study of nature now brought forward\nfor the first time, not indeed to strengthen the authority of this\nconception (which was already established), but rather to make a\nshow with a supposed discovery of theoretical reason.\nFrom these remarks, the reader of the Critique of Pure Speculative\nReason will be thoroughly convinced how highly necessary that\nlaborious deduction of the categories was, and how fruitful for\ntheology and morals. For if, on the one hand, we place them in pure\nunderstanding, it is by this deduction alone that we can be\nprevented from regarding them, with Plato, as innate, and founding\non them extravagant pretensions to theories of the supersensible, to\nwhich we can see no end, and by which we should make theology a\nmagic lantern of chimeras; on the other hand, if we regard them as\nacquired, this deduction saves us from restricting, with Epicurus, all\nand every use of them, even for practical purposes, to the objects and\nmotives of the senses. But now that the Critique has shown by that\ndeduction, first, that they are not of empirical origin, but have\ntheir seat and source a priori in the pure understanding; secondly,\nthat as they refer to objects in general independently of the\nintuition of them, hence, although they cannot effect theoretical\nknowledge, except in application to empirical objects, yet when\napplied to an object given by pure practical reason they enable us\nto conceive the supersensible definitely, only so far, however, as\nit is defined by such predicates as are necessarily connected with the\npure practical purpose given a priori and with its possibility. The\nspeculative restriction of pure reason and its practical extension\nbring it into that relation of equality in which reason in general can\nbe employed suitably to its end, and this example proves better than\nany other that the path to wisdom, if it is to be made sure and not to\nbe impassable or misleading, must with us men inevitably pass\nthrough science; but it is not till this is complete that we can be\nconvinced that it leads to this goal.\n{BOOK_2|CHAPTER_2 ^paragraph 85}\nVIII. Of Belief from a Requirement of Pure Reason.\nA want or requirement of pure reason in its speculative use leads\nonly to a hypothesis; that of pure practical reason to a postulate;\nfor in the former case I ascend from the result as high as I please in\nthe series of causes, not in order to give objective reality to the\nresult (e.g., the causal connection of things and changes in the\nworld), but in order thoroughly to satisfy my inquiring reason in\nrespect of it. Thus I see before me order and design in nature, and\nneed not resort to speculation to assure myself of their reality,\nbut to explain them I have to presuppose a Deity as their cause; and\nthen since the inference from an effect to a definite cause is\nalways uncertain and doubtful, especially to a cause so precise and so\nperfectly defined as we have to conceive in God, hence the highest\ndegree of certainty to which this pre-supposition can be brought is\nthat it is the most rational opinion for us men. * On the other hand,\na requirement of pure practical reason is based on a duty, that of\nmaking something (the summum bonum) the object of my will so as to\npromote it with all my powers; in which case I must suppose its\npossibility and, consequently, also the conditions necessary\nthereto, namely, God, freedom, and immortality; since I cannot prove\nthese by my speculative reason, although neither can I refute them.\nThis duty is founded on something that is indeed quite independent\nof these suppositions and is of itself apodeictically certain, namely,\nthe moral law; and so far it needs no further support by theoretical\nviews as to the inner constitution of things, the secret final aim\nof the order of the world, or a presiding ruler thereof, in order to\nbind me in the most perfect manner to act in unconditional\nconformity to the law. But the subjective effect of this law,\nnamely, the mental disposition conformed to it and made necessary by\nit, to promote the practically possible summum bonum, this\npre-supposes at least that the latter is possible, for it would be\npractically impossible to strive after the object of a conception\nwhich at bottom was empty and had no object. Now the above-mentioned\npostulates concern only the physical or metaphysical conditions of the\npossibility of the summum bonum; in a word, those which lie in the\nnature of things; not, however, for the sake of an arbitrary\nspeculative purpose, but of a practically necessary end of a pure\nrational will, which in this case does not choose, but obeys an\ninexorable command of reason, the foundation of which is objective, in\nthe constitution of things as they must be universally judged by\npure reason, and is not based on inclination; for we are in nowise\njustified in assuming, on account of what we wish on merely subjective\ngrounds, that the means thereto are possible or that its object is\nreal. This, then, is an absolutely necessary requirement, and what\nit pre-supposes is not merely justified as an allowable hypothesis,\nbut as a postulate in a practical point of view; and admitting that\nthe pure moral law inexorably binds every man as a command (not as a\nrule of prudence), the righteous man may say: \"I will that there be\na God, that my existence in this world be also an existence outside\nthe chain of physical causes and in a pure world of the understanding,\nand lastly, that my duration be endless; I firmly abide by this, and\nwill not let this faith be taken from me; for in this instance alone\nmy interest, because I must not relax anything of it, inevitably\ndetermines my judgement, without regarding sophistries, however unable\nI may be to answer them or to oppose them with others more\nplausible. *(2)\n* But even here we should not be able to allege a requirement of\nreason, if we had not before our eyes a problematical, but yet\ninevitable, conception of reason, namely, that of an absolutely\nnecessary being. This conception now seeks to be defined, and this, in\naddition to the tendency to extend itself, is the objective ground\nof a requirement of speculative reason, namely, to have a more precise\ndefinition of the conception of a necessary being which is to serve as\nthe first cause of other beings, so as to make these latter knowable\nby some means. Without such antecedent necessary problems there are no\nrequirements- at least not of pure reason- the rest are requirements\nof inclination.\n{BOOK_2|CHAPTER_2 ^paragraph 90}\n*(2) In the Deutsches Museum, February, 1787, there is a\ndissertation by a very subtle and clear-headed man, the late\nWizenmann, whose early death is to be lamented, in which he disputes\nthe right to argue from a want to the objective reality of its object,\nand illustrates the point by the example of a man in love, who\nhaving fooled himself into an idea of beauty, which is merely a\nchimera of his own brain, would fain conclude that such an object\nreally exists somewhere. I quite agree with him in this, in all\ncases where the want is founded on inclination, which cannot\nnecessarily postulate the existence of its object even for the man\nthat is affected by it, much less can it contain a demand valid for\neveryone, and therefore it is merely a subjective ground of the\nwish. But in the present case we have a want of reason springing\nfrom an objective determining principle of the will, namely, the moral\nlaw, which necessarily binds every rational being, and therefore\njustifies him in assuming a priori in nature the conditions proper for\nit, and makes the latter inseparable from the complete practical use\nof reason. It is a duty to realize the summum bonum to the utmost of\nour power, therefore it must be possible, consequently it is\nunavoidable for every rational being in the world to assume what is\nnecessary for its objective possibility. The assumption is as\nnecessary as the moral law, in connection with which alone it is\nvalid.\nIn order to prevent misconception in the use of a notion as yet so\nunusual as that of a faith of pure practical reason, let me be\npermitted to add one more remark. It might almost seem as if this\nrational faith were here announced as itself a command, namely, that\nwe should assume the summum bonum as possible. But a faith that is\ncommanded is nonsense. Let the preceding analysis, however, be\nremembered of what is required to be supposed in the conception of the\nsummum bonum, and it will be seen that it cannot be commanded to\nassume this possibility, and no practical disposition of mind is\nrequired to admit it; but that speculative reason must concede it\nwithout being asked, for no one can affirm that it is impossible in\nitself that rational beings in the world should at the same time be\nworthy of happiness in conformity with the moral law and also\npossess this happiness proportionately. Now in respect of the first\nelement of the summum bonum, namely, that which concerns morality, the\nmoral law gives merely a command, and to doubt the possibility of that\nelement would be the same as to call in question the moral law itself.\nBut as regards the second element of that object, namely, happiness\nperfectly proportioned to that worthiness, it is true that there is no\nneed of a command to admit its possibility in general, for theoretical\nreason has nothing to say against it; but the manner in which we\nhave to conceive this harmony of the laws of nature with those of\nfreedom has in it something in respect of which we have a choice,\nbecause theoretical reason decides nothing with apodeictic certainty\nabout it, and in respect of this there may be a moral interest which\nturns the scale.\nI had said above that in a mere course of nature in the world an\naccurate correspondence between happiness and moral worth is not to be\nexpected and must be regarded as impossible, and that therefore the\npossibility of the summum bonum cannot be admitted from this side\nexcept on the supposition of a moral Author of the world. I\npurposely reserved the restriction of this judgement to the subjective\nconditions of our reason, in order not to make use of it until the\nmanner of this belief should be defined more precisely. The fact is\nthat the impossibility referred to is merely subjective, that is,\nour reason finds it impossible for it to render conceivable in the way\nof a mere course of nature a connection so exactly proportioned and so\nthoroughly adapted to an end, between two sets of events happening\naccording to such distinct laws; although, as with everything else\nin nature that is adapted to an end, it cannot prove, that is, show by\nsufficient objective reason, that it is not possible by universal laws\nof nature.\nNow, however, a deciding principle of a different kind comes into\nplay to turn the scale in this uncertainty of speculative reason.\nThe command to promote the summum bonum is established on an objective\nbasis (in practical reason); the possibility of the same in general is\nlikewise established on an objective basis (in theoretical reason,\nwhich has nothing to say against it). But reason cannot decide\nobjectively in what way we are to conceive this possibility; whether\nby universal laws of nature without a wise Author presiding over\nnature, or only on supposition of such an Author. Now here there comes\nin a subjective condition of reason, the only way theoretically\npossible for it, of conceiving the exact harmony of the kingdom of\nnature with the kingdom of morals, which is the condition of the\npossibility of the summum bonum; and at the same time the only one\nconducive to morality (which depends on an objective law of reason).\nNow since the promotion of this summum bonum, and therefore the\nsupposition of its possibility, are objectively necessary (though only\nas a result of practical reason), while at the same time the manner in\nwhich we would conceive it rests with our own choice, and in this\nchoice a free interest of pure practical reason decides for the\nassumption of a wise Author of the world; it is clear that the\nprinciple that herein determines our judgement, though as a want it is\nsubjective, yet at the same time being the means of promoting what\nis objectively (practically) necessary, is the foundation of a maxim\nof belief in a moral point of view, that is, a faith of pure practical\nreason. This, then, is not commanded, but being a voluntary\ndetermination of our judgement, conducive to the moral (commanded)\npurpose, and moreover harmonizing with the theoretical requirement\nof reason, to assume that existence and to make it the foundation of\nour further employment of reason, it has itself sprung from the\nmoral disposition of mind; it may therefore at times waver even in the\nwell-disposed, but can never be reduced to unbelief.\n{BOOK_2|CHAPTER_2 ^paragraph 95}\nIX. Of the Wise Adaptation of Man's Cognitive Faculties\nto his Practical Destination.\nIf human nature is destined to endeavour after the summum bonum,\nwe must suppose also that the measure of its cognitive faculties,\nand particularly their relation to one another, is suitable to this\nend. Now the Critique of Pure Speculative Reason proves that this is\nincapable of solving satisfactorily the most weighty problems that are\nproposed to it, although it does not ignore the natural and\nimportant hints received from the same reason, nor the great steps\nthat it can make to approach to this great goal that is set before it,\nwhich, however, it can never reach of itself, even with the help of\nthe greatest knowledge of nature. Nature then seems here to have\nprovided us only in a step-motherly fashion with the faculty required\nfor our end.\n{BOOK_2|CHAPTER_2 ^paragraph 100}\nSuppose, now, that in this matter nature had conformed to our wish\nand had given us that capacity of discernment or that enlightenment\nwhich we would gladly possess, or which some imagine they actually\npossess, what would in all probability be the consequence? Unless\nour whole nature were at the same time changed, our inclinations,\nwhich always have the first word, would first of all demand their\nown satisfaction, and, joined with rational reflection, the greatest\npossible and most lasting satisfaction, under the name of happiness;\nthe moral law would afterwards speak, in order to keep them within\ntheir proper bounds, and even to subject them all to a higher end,\nwhich has no regard to inclination. But instead of the conflict that\nthe moral disposition has now to carry on with the inclinations, in\nwhich, though after some defeats, moral strength of mind may be\ngradually acquired, God and eternity with their awful majesty would\nstand unceasingly before our eyes (for what we can prove perfectly\nis to us as certain as that of which we are assured by the sight of\nour eyes). Transgression of the law, would, no doubt, be avoided; what\nis commanded would be done; but the mental disposition, from which\nactions ought to proceed, cannot be infused by any command, and in\nthis case the spur of action is ever active and external, so that\nreason has no need to exert itself in order to gather strength to\nresist the inclinations by a lively representation of the dignity of\nthe law: hence most of the actions that conformed to the law would\nbe done from fear, a few only from hope, and none at all from duty,\nand the moral worth of actions, on which alone in the eyes of\nsupreme wisdom the worth of the person and even that of the world\ndepends, would cease to exist. As long as the nature of man remains\nwhat it is, his conduct would thus be changed into mere mechanism,\nin which, as in a puppet-show, everything would gesticulate well,\nbut there would be no life in the figures. Now, when it is quite\notherwise with us, when with all the effort of our reason we have only\na very obscure and doubtful view into the future, when the Governor of\nthe world allows us only to conjecture his existence and his\nmajesty, not to behold them or prove them clearly; and on the other\nhand, the moral law within us, without promising or threatening\nanything with certainty, demands of us disinterested respect; and only\nwhen this respect has become active and dominant, does it allow us\nby means of it a prospect into the world of the supersensible, and\nthen only with weak glances: all this being so, there is room for true\nmoral disposition, immediately devoted to the law, and a rational\ncreature can become worthy of sharing in the summum bonum that\ncorresponds to the worth of his person and not merely to his\nactions. Thus what the study of nature and of man teaches us\nsufficiently elsewhere may well be true here also; that the\nunsearchable wisdom by which we exist is not less worthy of admiration\nin what it has denied than in what it has granted.\nPART_2|METHODOLOGY\nSECOND PART.\nMethodology of Pure Practical Reason.\nBy the methodology of pure practical reason we are not to understand\nthe mode of proceeding with pure practical principles (whether in\nstudy or in exposition), with a view to a scientific knowledge of\nthem, which alone is what is properly called method elsewhere in\ntheoretical philosophy (for popular knowledge requires a manner,\nscience a method, i.e., a process according to principles of reason by\nwhich alone the manifold of any branch of knowledge can become a\nsystem). On the contrary, by this methodology is understood the mode\nin which we can give the laws of pure practical reason access to the\nhuman mind and influence on its maxims, that is, by which we can\nmake the objectively practical reason subjectively practical also.\nNow it is clear enough that those determining principles of the will\nwhich alone make maxims properly moral and give them a moral worth,\nnamely, the direct conception of the law and the objective necessity\nof obeying it as our duty, must be regarded as the proper springs of\nactions, since otherwise legality of actions might be produced, but\nnot morality of character. But it is not so clear; on the contrary, it\nmust at first sight seem to every one very improbable that even\nsubjectively that exhibition of pure virtue can have more power over\nthe human mind, and supply a far stronger spring even for effecting\nthat legality of actions, and can produce more powerful resolutions to\nprefer the law, from pure respect for it, to every other\nconsideration, than all the deceptive allurements of pleasure or of\nall that may be reckoned as happiness, or even than all threatenings\nof pain and misfortune. Nevertheless, this is actually the case, and\nif human nature were not so constituted, no mode of presenting the law\nby roundabout ways and indirect recommendations would ever produce\nmorality of character. All would be simple hypocrisy; the law would be\nhated, or at least despised, while it was followed for the sake of\none's own advantage. The letter of the law (legality) would be found\nin our actions, but not the spirit of it in our minds (morality);\nand as with all our efforts we could not quite free ourselves from\nreason in our judgement, we must inevitably appear in our own eyes\nworthless, depraved men, even though we should seek to compensate\nourselves for this mortification before the inner tribunal, by\nenjoying the pleasure that a supposed natural or divine law might be\nimagined to have connected with it a sort of police machinery,\nregulating its operations by what was done without troubling itself\nabout the motives for doing it.\nIt cannot indeed be denied that in order to bring an uncultivated or\ndegraded mind into the track of moral goodness some preparatory\nguidance is necessary, to attract it by a view of its own advantage,\nor to alarm it by fear of loss; but as soon as this mechanical work,\nthese leading-strings have produced some effect, then we must bring\nbefore the mind the pure moral motive, which, not only because it is\nthe only one that can be the foundation of a character (a\npractically consistent habit of mind with unchangeable maxims), but\nalso because it teaches a man to feel his own dignity, gives the\nmind a power unexpected even by himself, to tear himself from all\nsensible attachments so far as they would fain have the rule, and to\nfind a rich compensation for the sacrifice he offers, in the\nindependence of his rational nature and the greatness of soul to which\nhe sees that he is destined. We will therefore show, by such\nobservations as every one can make, that this property of our minds,\nthis receptivity for a pure moral interest, and consequently the\nmoving force of the pure conception of virtue, when it is properly\napplied to the human heart, is the most powerful spring and, when a\ncontinued and punctual observance of moral maxims is in question,\nthe only spring of good conduct. It must, however, be remembered\nthat if these observations only prove the reality of such a feeling,\nbut do not show any moral improvement brought about by it, this is\nno argument against the only method that exists of making the\nobjectively practical laws of pure reason subjectively practical,\nthrough the mere force of the conception of duty; nor does it prove\nthat this method is a vain delusion. For as it has never yet come into\nvogue, experience can say nothing of its results; one can only ask for\nproofs of the receptivity for such springs, and these I will now\nbriefly present, and then sketch the method of founding and\ncultivating genuine moral dispositions.\n{PART_2|METHODOLOGY ^paragraph 5}\nWhen we attend to the course of conversation in mixed companies,\nconsisting not merely of learned persons and subtle reasoners, but\nalso of men of business or of women, we observe that, besides\nstory-telling and jesting, another kind of entertainment finds a place\nin them, namely, argument; for stories, if they are to have novelty\nand interest, are soon exhausted, and jesting is likely to become\ninsipid. Now of all argument there is none in which persons are more\nready to join who find any other subtle discussion tedious, none\nthat brings more liveliness into the company, than that which concerns\nthe moral worth of this or that action by which the character of\nsome person is to be made out. Persons, to whom in other cases\nanything subtle and speculative in theoretical questions is dry and\nirksome, presently join in when the question is to make out the\nmoral import of a good or bad action that has been related, and they\ndisplay an exactness, a refinement, a subtlety, in excogitating\neverything that can lessen the purity of purpose, and consequently the\ndegree of virtue in it, which we do not expect from them in any\nother kind of speculation. In these criticisms, persons who are\npassing judgement on others often reveal their own character: some, in\nexercising their judicial office, especially upon the dead, seem\ninclined chiefly to defend the goodness that is related of this or\nthat deed against all injurious charges of insincerity, and ultimately\nto defend the whole moral worth of the person against the reproach\nof dissimulation and secret wickedness; others, on the contrary,\nturn their thoughts more upon attacking this worth by accusation and\nfault finding. We cannot always, however, attribute to these latter\nthe intention of arguing away virtue altogether out of all human\nexamples in order to make it an empty name; often, on the contrary, it\nis only well-meant strictness in determining the true moral import\nof actions according to an uncompromising law. Comparison with such\na law, instead of with examples, lowers self-conceit in moral\nmatters very much, and not merely teaches humility, but makes every\none feel it when he examines himself closely. Nevertheless, we can for\nthe most part observe, in those who defend the purity of purpose in\ngiving examples that where there is the presumption of uprightness\nthey are anxious to remove even the least spot, lest, if all\nexamples had their truthfulness disputed, and if the purity of all\nhuman virtue were denied, it might in the end be regarded as a mere\nphantom, and so all effort to attain it be made light of as vain\naffectation and delusive conceit.\nI do not know why the educators of youth have not long since made\nuse of this propensity of reason to enter with pleasure upon the\nmost subtle examination of the practical questions that are thrown up;\nand why they have not, after first laying the foundation of a purely\nmoral catechism, searched through the biographies of ancient and\nmodern times with the view of having at hand instances of the duties\nlaid down, in which, especially by comparison of similar actions under\ndifferent circumstances, they might exercise the critical judgement of\ntheir scholars in remarking their greater or less moral\nsignificance. This is a thing in which they would find that even early\nyouth, which is still unripe for speculation of other kinds, would\nsoon Become very acute and not a little interested, because it feels\nthe progress of its faculty of judgement; and, what is most important,\nthey could hope with confidence that the frequent practice of\nknowing and approving good conduct in all its purity, and on the other\nhand of remarking with regret or contempt the least deviation from it,\nalthough it may be pursued only as a sport in which children may\ncompete with one another, yet will leave a lasting impression of\nesteem on the one hand and disgust on the other; and so, by the mere\nhabit of looking on such actions as deserving approval or blame, a\ngood foundation would be laid for uprightness in the future course\nof life. Only I wish they would spare them the example of so-called\nnoble (super-meritorious) actions, in which our sentimental books so\nmuch abound, and would refer all to duty merely, and to the worth that\na man can and must give himself in his own eyes by the consciousness\nof not having transgressed it, since whatever runs up into empty\nwishes and longings after inaccessible perfection produces mere heroes\nof romance, who, while they pique themselves on their feeling for\ntranscendent greatness, release themselves in return from the\nobservance of common and every-day obligations, which then seem to\nthem petty and insignificant. *\n* It is quite proper to extol actions that display a great,\nunselfish, sympathizing mind or humanity. But, in this case, we must\nfix attention not so much on the elevation of soul, which is very\nfleeting and transitory, as on the subjection of the heart to duty,\nfrom which a more enduring impression may be expected, because this\nimplies principle (whereas the former only implies ebullitions). One\nneed only reflect a little and he will always find a debt that he\nhas by some means incurred towards the human race (even if it were\nonly this, by the inequality of men in the civil constitution,\nenjoys advantages on account of which others must be the more in\nwant), which will prevent the thought of duty from being repressed\nby the self-complacent imagination of merit.\n{PART_2|METHODOLOGY ^paragraph 10}\nBut if it is asked: \"What, then, is really pure morality, by which\nas a touchstone we must test the moral significance of every\naction,\" then I must admit that it is only philosophers that can\nmake the decision of this question doubtful, for to common sense it\nhas been decided long ago, not indeed by abstract general formulae,\nbut by habitual use, like the distinction between the right and left\nhand. We will then point out the criterion of pure virtue in an\nexample first, and, imagining that it is set before a boy, of say\nten years old, for his judgement, we will see whether he would\nnecessarily judge so of himself without being guided by his teacher.\nTell him the history of an honest man whom men want to persuade to\njoin the calumniators of an innocent and powerless person (say Anne\nBoleyn, accused by Henry VIII of England). He is offered advantages,\ngreat gifts, or high rank; he rejects them. This will excite mere\napprobation and applause in the mind of the hearer. Now begins the\nthreatening of loss. Amongst these traducers are his best friends, who\nnow renounce his friendship; near kinsfolk, who threaten to disinherit\nhim (he being without fortune); powerful persons, who can persecute\nand harass him in all places and circumstances; a prince, who\nthreatens him with loss of freedom, yea, loss of life. Then to fill\nthe measure of suffering, and that he may feel the pain that only\nthe morally good heart can feel very deeply, let us conceive his\nfamily threatened with extreme distress and want, entreating him to\nyield; conceive himself, though upright, yet with feelings not hard or\ninsensible either to compassion or to his own distress; conceive\nhim, I say, at the moment when he wishes that he had never lived to\nsee the day that exposed him to such unutterable anguish, yet\nremaining true to his uprightness of purpose, without wavering or even\ndoubting; then will my youthful hearer be raised gradually from mere\napproval to admiration, from that to amazement, and finally to the\ngreatest veneration, and a lively wish that he himself could be such a\nman (though certainly not in such circumstances). Yet virtue is here\nworth so much only because it costs so much, not because it brings any\nprofit. All the admiration, and even the endeavour to resemble this\ncharacter, rest wholly on the purity of the moral principle, which can\nonly be strikingly shown by removing from the springs of action\neverything that men may regard as part of happiness. Morality, then,\nmust have the more power over the human heart the more purely it is\nexhibited. Whence it follows that, if the law of morality and the\nimage of holiness and virtue are to exercise any influence at all on\nour souls, they can do so only so far as they are laid to heart in\ntheir purity as motives, unmixed with any view to prosperity, for it\nis in suffering that they display themselves most nobly. Now that\nwhose removal strengthens the effect of a moving force must have\nbeen a hindrance, consequently every admixture of motives taken from\nour own happiness is a hindrance to the influence of the moral law\non the heart. I affirm further that even in that admired action, if\nthe motive from which it was done was a high regard for duty, then\nit is just this respect for the law that has the greatest influence on\nthe mind of the spectator, not any pretension to a supposed inward\ngreatness of mind or noble meritorious sentiments; consequently\nduty, not merit, must have not only the most definite, but, when it is\nrepresented in the true light of its inviolability, the most\npenetrating, influence on the mind.\nIt is more necessary than ever to direct attention to this method in\nour times, when men hope to produce more effect on the mind with soft,\ntender feelings, or high-flown, puffing-up pretensions, which rather\nwither the heart than strengthen it, than by a plain and earnest\nrepresentation of duty, which is more suited to human imperfection and\nto progress in goodness. To set before children, as a pattern, actions\nthat are called noble, magnanimous, meritorious, with the notion of\ncaptivating them by infusing enthusiasm for such actions, is to defeat\nour end. For as they are still so backward in the observance of the\ncommonest duty, and even in the correct estimation of it, this means\nsimply to make them fantastical romancers betimes. But, even with\nthe instructed and experienced part of mankind, this supposed spring\nhas, if not an injurious, at least no genuine, moral effect on the\nheart, which, however, is what it was desired to produce.\nAll feelings, especially those that are to produce unwonted\nexertions, must accomplish their effect at the moment they are at\ntheir height and before the calm down; otherwise they effect\nnothing; for as there was nothing to strengthen the heart, but only to\nexcite it, it naturally returns to its normal moderate tone and, thus,\nfalls back into its previous languor. Principles must be built on\nconceptions; on any other basis there can only be paroxysms, which can\ngive the person no moral worth, nay, not even confidence in himself,\nwithout which the highest good in man, consciousness of the morality\nof his mind and character, cannot exist. Now if these conceptions\nare to become subjectively practical, we must not rest satisfied\nwith admiring the objective law of morality, and esteeming it highly\nin reference to humanity, but we must consider the conception of it in\nrelation to man as an individual, and then this law appears in a\nform indeed that is highly deserving of respect, but not so pleasant\nas if it belonged to the element to which he is naturally\naccustomed; but on the contrary as often compelling him to quit this\nelement, not without self-denial, and to betake himself to a higher,\nin which he can only maintain himself with trouble and with\nunceasing apprehension of a relapse. In a word, the moral law\ndemands obedience, from duty not from predilection, which cannot and\nought not to be presupposed at all.\nLet us now see, in an example, whether the conception of an\naction, as a noble and magnanimous one, has more subjective moving\npower than if the action is conceived merely as duty in relation to\nthe solemn law of morality. The action by which a man endeavours at\nthe greatest peril of life to rescue people from shipwreck, at last\nlosing his life in the attempt, is reckoned on one side as duty, but\non the other and for the most part as a meritorious action, but our\nesteem for it is much weakened by the notion of duty to himself\nwhich seems in this case to be somewhat infringed. More decisive is\nthe magnanimous sacrifice of life for the safety of one's country; and\nyet there still remains some scruple whether it is a perfect duty to\ndevote one's self to this purpose spontaneously and unbidden, and\nthe action has not in itself the full force of a pattern and impulse\nto imitation. But if an indispensable duty be in question, the\ntransgression of which violates the moral law itself, and without\nregard to the welfare of mankind, and as it were tramples on its\nholiness (such as are usually called duties to God, because in Him\nwe conceive the ideal of holiness in substance), then we give our most\nperfect esteem to the pursuit of it at the sacrifice of all that can\nhave any value for the dearest inclinations, and we find our soul\nstrengthened and elevated by such an example, when we convince\nourselves by contemplation of it that human nature is capable of so\ngreat an elevation above every motive that nature can oppose to it.\nJuvenal describes such an example in a climax which makes the reader\nfeel vividly the force of the spring that is contained in the pure law\nof duty, as duty:\n{PART_2|METHODOLOGY ^paragraph 15}\nEsto bonus miles, tutor bonus, arbiter idem\nInteger; ambiguae si quando citabere testis\nIncertaeque rei, Phalaris licet imperet ut sis\nFalsus, et admoto dictet periuria tauro,\nSummum crede nefas animam praeferre pudori,\n{PART_2|METHODOLOGY ^paragraph 20}\nEt propter vitam vivendi perdere causas. *\n* [Juvenal, Satirae, \"Be you a good soldier, a faithful tutor, an\nuncorrupted umpire also; if you are summoned as a witness in a\ndoubtful and uncertain thing, though Phalaris should command that\nyou should be false, and should dictate perjuries with the bull\nbrought to you, believe it the highest impiety to prefer life to\nreputation, and for the sake of life, to lose the causes of living.\"]\nWhen we can bring any flattering thought of merit into our action,\nthen the motive is already somewhat alloyed with self-love and has\ntherefore some assistance from the side of the sensibility. But to\npostpone everything to the holiness of duty alone, and to be conscious\nthat we can because our own reason recognises this as its command\nand says that we ought to do it, this is, as it were, to raise\nourselves altogether above the world of sense, and there is\ninseparably involved in the same a consciousness of the law, as a\nspring of a faculty that controls the sensibility; and although this\nis not always attended with effect, yet frequent engagement with\nthis spring, and the at first minor attempts at using it, give hope\nthat this effect may be wrought, and that by degrees the greatest, and\nthat a purely moral interest in it may be produced in us.\n{PART_2|METHODOLOGY ^paragraph 25}\nThe method then takes the following course. At first we are only\nconcerned to make the judging of actions by moral laws a natural\nemployment accompanying all our own free actions, as well as the\nobservation of those of others, and to make it as it were a habit, and\nto sharpen this judgement, asking first whether the action conforms\nobjectively to the moral law, and to what law; and we distinguish\nthe law that merely furnishes a principle of obligation from that\nwhich is really obligatory (leges obligandi a legibus obligantibus);\nas, for instance, the law of what men's wants require from me, as\ncontrasted with that which their rights demand, the latter of which\nprescribes essential, the former only non-essential duties; and thus\nwe teach how to distinguish different kinds of duties which meet in\nthe same action. The other point to which attention must be directed\nis the question whether the action was also (subjectively) done for\nthe sake of the moral law, so that it not only is morally correct as a\ndeed, but also, by the maxim from which it is done, has moral worth as\na disposition. Now there is no doubt that this practice, and the\nresulting culture of our reason in judging merely of the practical,\nmust gradually produce a certain interest even in the law of reason,\nand consequently in morally good actions. For we ultimately take a\nliking for a thing, the contemplation of which makes us feel that\nthe use of our cognitive faculties is extended; and this extension\nis especially furthered by that in which we find moral correctness,\nsince it is only in such an order of things that reason, with its\nfaculty of determining a priori on principle what ought to be done,\ncan find satisfaction. An observer of nature takes liking at last to\nobjects that at first offended his senses, when he discovers in them\nthe great adaptation of their organization to design, so that his\nreason finds food in its contemplation. So Leibnitz spared an insect\nthat he had carefully examined with the microscope, and replaced it on\nits leaf, because he had found himself instructed by the view of it\nand had, as it were, received a benefit from it.\nBut this employment of the faculty of judgement, which makes us feel\nour own cognitive powers, is not yet the interest in actions and in\ntheir morality itself. It merely causes us to take pleasure in\nengaging in such criticism, and it gives to virtue or the\ndisposition that conforms to moral laws a form of beauty, which is\nadmired, but not on that account sought after (laudatur et alget);\nas everything the contemplation of which produces a consciousness of\nthe harmony of our powers of conception, and in which we feel the\nwhole of our faculty of knowledge (understanding and imagination)\nstrengthened, produces a satisfaction, which may also be\ncommunicated to others, while nevertheless the existence of the object\nremains indifferent to us, being only regarded as the occasion of\nour becoming aware of the capacities in us which are elevated above\nmere animal nature. Now, however, the second exercise comes in, the\nliving exhibition of morality of character by examples, in which\nattention is directed to purity of will, first only as a negative\nperfection, in so far as in an action done from duty no motives of\ninclination have any influence in determining it. By this the\npupil's attention is fixed upon the consciousness of his freedom,\nand although this renunciation at first excites a feeling of pain,\nnevertheless, by its withdrawing the pupil from the constraint of even\nreal wants, there is proclaimed to him at the same time a\ndeliverance from the manifold dissatisfaction in which all these wants\nentangle him, and the mind is made capable of receiving the\nsensation of satisfaction from other sources. The heart is freed and\nlightened of a burden that always secretly presses on it, when\ninstances of pure moral resolutions reveal to the man an inner faculty\nof which otherwise he has no right knowledge, the inward freedom to\nrelease himself from the boisterous importunity of inclinations, to\nsuch a degree that none of them, not even the dearest, shall have\nany influence on a resolution, for which we are now to employ our\nreason. Suppose a case where I alone know that the wrong is on my\nside, and although a free confession of it and the offer of\nsatisfaction are so strongly opposed by vanity, selfishness, and\neven an otherwise not illegitimate antipathy to the man whose rights\nare impaired by me, I am nevertheless able to discard all these\nconsiderations; in this there is implied a consciousness of\nindependence on inclinations and circumstances, and of the possibility\nof being sufficient for myself, which is salutary to me in general for\nother purposes also. And now the law of duty, in consequence of the\npositive worth which obedience to it makes us feel, finds easier\naccess through the respect for ourselves in the consciousness of our\nfreedom. When this is well established, when a man dreads nothing more\nthan to find himself, on self-examination, worthless and\ncontemptible in his own eyes, then every good moral disposition can be\ngrafted on it, because this is the best, nay, the only guard that\ncan keep off from the mind the pressure of ignoble and corrupting\nmotives.\nI have only intended to point out the most general maxims of the\nmethodology of moral cultivation and exercise. As the manifold variety\nof duties requires special rules for each kind, and this would be a\nprolix affair, I shall be readily excused if in a work like this,\nwhich is only preliminary, I content myself with these outlines.\nPART_2|CONCLUSION\nCONCLUSION.\nTwo things fill the mind with ever new and increasing admiration and\nawe, the oftener and the more steadily we reflect on them: the\nstarry heavens above and the moral law within. I have not to search\nfor them and conjecture them as though they were veiled in darkness or\nwere in the transcendent region beyond my horizon; I see them before\nme and connect them directly with the consciousness of my existence.\nThe former begins from the place I occupy in the external world of\nsense, and enlarges my connection therein to an unbounded extent\nwith worlds upon worlds and systems of systems, and moreover into\nlimitless times of their periodic motion, its beginning and\ncontinuance. The second begins from my invisible self, my personality,\nand exhibits me in a world which has true infinity, but which is\ntraceable only by the understanding, and with which I discern that I\nam not in a merely contingent but in a universal and necessary\nconnection, as I am also thereby with all those visible worlds. The\nformer view of a countless multitude of worlds annihilates as it\nwere my importance as an animal creature, which after it has been\nfor a short time provided with vital power, one knows not how, must\nagain give back the matter of which it was formed to the planet it\ninhabits (a mere speck in the universe). The second, on the\ncontrary, infinitely elevates my worth as an intelligence by my\npersonality, in which the moral law reveals to me a life independent\nof animality and even of the whole sensible world, at least so far\nas may be inferred from the destination assigned to my existence by\nthis law, a destination not restricted to conditions and limits of\nthis life, but reaching into the infinite.\nBut though admiration and respect may excite to inquiry, they cannot\nsupply the want of it. What, then, is to be done in order to enter\non this in a useful manner and one adapted to the loftiness of the\nsubject? Examples may serve in this as a warning and also for\nimitation. The contemplation of the world began from the noblest\nspectacle that the human senses present to us, and that our\nunderstanding can bear to follow in their vast reach; and it ended- in\nastrology. Morality began with the noblest attribute of human\nnature, the development and cultivation of which give a prospect of\ninfinite utility; and ended- in fanaticism or superstition. So it is\nwith all crude attempts where the principal part of the business\ndepends on the use of reason, a use which does not come of itself,\nlike the use of the feet, by frequent exercise, especially when\nattributes are in question which cannot be directly exhibited in\ncommon experience. But after the maxim had come into vogue, though\nlate, to examine carefully beforehand all the steps that reason\npurposes to take, and not to let it proceed otherwise than in the\ntrack of a previously well considered method, then the study of the\nstructure of the universe took quite a different direction, and\nthereby attained an incomparably happier result. The fall of a\nstone, the motion of a sling, resolved into their elements and the\nforces that are manifested in them, and treated mathematically,\nproduced at last that clear and henceforward unchangeable insight into\nthe system of the world which, as observation is continued, may hope\nalways to extend itself, but need never fear to be compelled to\nretreat.\nThis example may suggest to us to enter on the same path in treating\nof the moral capacities of our nature, and may give us hope of a\nlike good result. We have at hand the instances of the moral judgement\nof reason. By analysing these into their elementary conceptions, and\nin default of mathematics adopting a process similar to that of\nchemistry, the separation of the empirical from the rational\nelements that may be found in them, by repeated experiments on\ncommon sense, we may exhibit both pure, and learn with certainty\nwhat each part can accomplish of itself, so as to prevent on the one\nhand the errors of a still crude untrained judgement, and on the other\nhand (what is far more necessary) the extravagances of genius, by\nwhich, as by the adepts of the philosopher's stone, without any\nmethodical study or knowledge of nature, visionary treasures are\npromised and the true are thrown away. In one word, science\n(critically undertaken and methodically directed) is the narrow gate\nthat leads to the true doctrine of practical wisdom, if we\nunderstand by this not merely what one ought to do, but what ought\nto serve teachers as a guide to construct well and clearly the road to\nwisdom which everyone should travel, and to secure others from going\nastray. Philosophy must always continue to be the guardian of this\nscience; and although the public does not take any interest in its\nsubtle investigations, it must take an interest in the resulting\ndoctrines, which such an examination first puts in a clear light.\nTHE END\nEnd of Project Gutenberg's The Critique of Practical Reason, by Immanuel Kant\n***", "source": "critique_of_practical_reason.txt"}

The History of Pure Reason.\nPREFACE TO THE FIRST EDITION 1781\nHuman reason, in one sphere of its cognition, is called upon to\nconsider questions, which it cannot decline, as they are presented by\nits own nature, but which it cannot answer, as they transcend every\nfaculty of the mind.\nIt falls into this difficulty without any fault of its own. It begins\nwith principles, which cannot be dispensed with in the field of\nexperience, and the truth and sufficiency of which are, at the same\ntime, insured by experience. With these principles it rises, in\nobedience to the laws of its own nature, to ever higher and more remote\nconditions. But it quickly discovers that, in this way, its labours\nmust remain ever incomplete, because new questions never cease to\npresent themselves; and thus it finds itself compelled to have recourse\nto principles which transcend the region of experience, while they are\nregarded by common sense without distrust. It thus falls into confusion\nand contradictions, from which it conjectures the presence of latent\nerrors, which, however, it is unable to discover, because the\nprinciples it employs, transcending the limits of experience, cannot be\ntested by that criterion. The arena of these endless contests is called\n_Metaphysic_.\nTime was, when she was the _queen_ of all the sciences; and, if we take\nthe will for the deed, she certainly deserves, so far as regards the\nhigh importance of her object-matter, this title of honour. Now, it is\nthe fashion of the time to heap contempt and scorn upon her; and the\nmatron mourns, forlorn and forsaken, like Hecuba:\nModo maxima rerum,\nTot generis, natisque potens...\nNunc trahor exul, inops.\n\u2014Ovid, Metamorphoses. xiii\nAt first, her government, under the administration of the _dogmatists_,\nwas an absolute _despotism_. But, as the legislative continued to show\ntraces of the ancient barbaric rule, her empire gradually broke up, and\nintestine wars introduced the reign of _anarchy;_ while the _sceptics_,\nlike nomadic tribes, who hate a permanent habitation and settled mode\nof living, attacked from time to time those who had organized\nthemselves into civil communities. But their number was, very happily,\nsmall; and thus they could not entirely put a stop to the exertions of\nthose who persisted in raising new edifices, although on no settled or\nuniform plan. In recent times the hope dawned upon us of seeing those\ndisputes settled, and the legitimacy of her claims established by a\nkind of _physiology_ of the human understanding\u2014that of the celebrated\nLocke. But it was found that\u2014although it was affirmed that this\nso-called queen could not refer her descent to any higher source than\nthat of common experience, a circumstance which necessarily brought\nsuspicion on her claims\u2014as this _genealogy_ was incorrect, she\npersisted in the advancement of her claims to sovereignty. Thus\nmetaphysics necessarily fell back into the antiquated and rotten\nconstitution of _dogmatism_, and again became obnoxious to the contempt\nfrom which efforts had been made to save it. At present, as all\nmethods, according to the general persuasion, have been tried in vain,\nthere reigns nought but weariness and complete _indifferentism_\u2014the\nmother of chaos and night in the scientific world, but at the same time\nthe source of, or at least the prelude to, the re-creation and\nreinstallation of a science, when it has fallen into confusion,\nobscurity, and disuse from ill directed effort.\nFor it is in reality vain to profess _indifference_ in regard to such\ninquiries, the object of which cannot be indifferent to humanity.\nBesides, these pretended _indifferentists_, however much they may try\nto disguise themselves by the assumption of a popular style and by\nchanges on the language of the schools, unavoidably fall into\nmetaphysical declarations and propositions, which they profess to\nregard with so much contempt. At the same time, this indifference,\nwhich has arisen in the world of science, and which relates to that\nkind of knowledge which we should wish to see destroyed the last, is a\nphenomenon that well deserves our attention and reflection. It is\nplainly not the effect of the levity, but of the matured _judgement_[1]\nof the age, which refuses to be any longer entertained with illusory\nknowledge, It is, in fact, a call to reason, again to undertake the\nmost laborious of all tasks\u2014that of self-examination, and to establish\na tribunal, which may secure it in its well-grounded claims, while it\npronounces against all baseless assumptions and pretensions, not in an\narbitrary manner, but according to its own eternal and unchangeable\nlaws. This tribunal is nothing less than the _Critical Investigation of\nPure Reason_.\n[1] We very often hear complaints of the shallowness of the present\nage, and of the decay of profound science. But I do not think that\nthose which rest upon a secure foundation, such as mathematics,\nphysical science, etc., in the least deserve this reproach, but that\nthey rather maintain their ancient fame, and in the latter case,\nindeed, far surpass it. The same would be the case with the other\nkinds of cognition, if their principles were but firmly established.\nIn the absence of this security, indifference, doubt, and finally,\nsevere criticism are rather signs of a profound habit of thought. Our\nage is the age of criticism, to which everything must be subjected.\nThe sacredness of religion, and the authority of legislation, are by\nmany regarded as grounds of exemption from the examination of this\ntribunal. But, if they are exempted, they become the subjects of just\nsuspicion, and cannot lay claim to sincere respect, which reason\naccords only to that which has stood the test of a free and public\nexamination.\nI do not mean by this a criticism of books and systems, but a critical\ninquiry into the faculty of reason, with reference to the cognitions to\nwhich it strives to attain _without the aid of experience;_ in other\nwords, the solution of the question regarding the possibility or\nimpossibility of metaphysics, and the determination of the origin, as\nwell as of the extent and limits of this science. All this must be done\non the basis of principles.\nThis path\u2014the only one now remaining\u2014has been entered upon by me; and I\nflatter myself that I have, in this way, discovered the cause of\u2014and\nconsequently the mode of removing\u2014all the errors which have hitherto\nset reason at variance with itself, in the sphere of non-empirical\nthought. I have not returned an evasive answer to the questions of\nreason, by alleging the inability and limitation of the faculties of\nthe mind; I have, on the contrary, examined them completely in the\nlight of principles, and, after having discovered the cause of the\ndoubts and contradictions into which reason fell, have solved them to\nits perfect satisfaction. It is true, these questions have not been\nsolved as dogmatism, in its vain fancies and desires, had expected; for\nit can only be satisfied by the exercise of magical arts, and of these\nI have no knowledge. But neither do these come within the compass of\nour mental powers; and it was the duty of philosophy to destroy the\nillusions which had their origin in misconceptions, whatever darling\nhopes and valued expectations may be ruined by its explanations. My\nchief aim in this work has been thoroughness; and I make bold to say\nthat there is not a single metaphysical problem that does not find its\nsolution, or at least the key to its solution, here. Pure reason is a\nperfect unity; and therefore, if the principle presented by it prove to\nbe insufficient for the solution of even a single one of those\nquestions to which the very nature of reason gives birth, we must\nreject it, as we could not be perfectly certain of its sufficiency in\nthe case of the others.\nWhile I say this, I think I see upon the countenance of the reader\nsigns of dissatisfaction mingled with contempt, when he hears\ndeclarations which sound so boastful and extravagant; and yet they are\nbeyond comparison more moderate than those advanced by the commonest\nauthor of the commonest philosophical programme, in which the dogmatist\nprofesses to demonstrate the simple nature of the soul, or the\nnecessity of a primal being. Such a dogmatist promises to extend human\nknowledge beyond the limits of possible experience; while I humbly\nconfess that this is completely beyond my power. Instead of any such\nattempt, I confine myself to the examination of reason alone and its\npure thought; and I do not need to seek far for the sum-total of its\ncognition, because it has its seat in my own mind. Besides, common\nlogic presents me with a complete and systematic catalogue of all the\nsimple operations of reason; and it is my task to answer the question\nhow far reason can go, without the material presented and the aid\nfurnished by experience.\nSo much for the completeness and thoroughness necessary in the\nexecution of the present task. The aims set before us are not\narbitrarily proposed, but are imposed upon us by the nature of\ncognition itself.\nThe above remarks relate to the _matter_ of our critical inquiry. As\nregards the _form_, there are two indispensable conditions, which any\none who undertakes so difficult a task as that of a critique of pure\nreason, is bound to fulfil. These conditions are _certitude_ and\n_clearness_.\nAs regards _certitude_, I have fully convinced myself that, in this\nsphere of thought, _opinion_ is perfectly inadmissible, and that\neverything which bears the least semblance of an hypothesis must be\nexcluded, as of no value in such discussions. For it is a necessary\ncondition of every cognition that is to be established upon _\u00e0 priori_\ngrounds that it shall be held to be absolutely necessary; much more is\nthis the case with an attempt to determine all pure _\u00e0 priori_\ncognition, and to furnish the standard\u2014and consequently an example\u2014of\nall apodeictic (philosophical) certitude. Whether I have succeeded in\nwhat I professed to do, it is for the reader to determine; it is the\nauthor\u2019s business merely to adduce grounds and reasons, without\ndetermining what influence these ought to have on the mind of his\njudges. But, lest anything he may have said may become the innocent\ncause of doubt in their minds, or tend to weaken the effect which his\narguments might otherwise produce\u2014he may be allowed to point out those\npassages which may occasion mistrust or difficulty, although these do\nnot concern the main purpose of the present work. He does this solely\nwith the view of removing from the mind of the reader any doubts which\nmight affect his judgement of the work as a whole, and in regard to its\nultimate aim.\nI know no investigations more necessary for a full insight into the\nnature of the faculty which we call _understanding_, and at the same\ntime for the determination of the rules and limits of its use, than\nthose undertaken in the second chapter of the \u201cTranscendental\nAnalytic,\u201d under the title of _Deduction of the Pure Conceptions of the\nUnderstanding;_ and they have also cost me by far the greatest\nlabour\u2014labour which, I hope, will not remain uncompensated. The view\nthere taken, which goes somewhat deeply into the subject, has two\nsides. The one relates to the objects of the pure understanding, and is\nintended to demonstrate and to render comprehensible the objective\nvalidity of its _\u00e0 priori_ conceptions; and it forms for this reason an\nessential part of the Critique. The other considers the pure\nunderstanding itself, its possibility and its powers of cognition\u2014that\nis, from a subjective point of view; and, although this exposition is\nof great importance, it does not belong essentially to the main purpose\nof the work, because the grand question is what and how much can reason\nand understanding, apart from experience, cognize, and not, how is the\n_faculty of thought_ itself possible? As the latter is an inquiry into\nthe cause of a given effect, and has thus in it some semblance of an\nhypothesis (although, as I shall show on another occasion, this is\nreally not the fact), it would seem that, in the present instance, I\nhad allowed myself to enounce a mere _opinion_, and that the reader\nmust therefore be at liberty to hold a different _opinion_. But I beg\nto remind him that, if my subjective deduction does not produce in his\nmind the conviction of its certitude at which I aimed, the objective\ndeduction, with which alone the present work is properly concerned, is\nin every respect satisfactory.\nAs regards _clearness_, the reader has a right to demand, in the first\nplace, _discursive_ or logical clearness, that is, on the basis of\nconceptions, and, secondly, _intuitive_ or \u00e6sthetic clearness, by means\nof intuitions, that is, by examples or other modes of illustration _in\nconcreto_. I have done what I could for the first kind of\nintelligibility. This was essential to my purpose; and it thus became\nthe accidental cause of my inability to do complete justice to the\nsecond requirement. I have been almost always at a loss, during the\nprogress of this work, how to settle this question. Examples and\nillustrations always appeared to me necessary, and, in the first sketch\nof the Critique, naturally fell into their proper places. But I very\nsoon became aware of the magnitude of my task, and the numerous\nproblems with which I should be engaged; and, as I perceived that this\ncritical investigation would, even if delivered in the driest\n_scholastic_ manner, be far from being brief, I found it unadvisable to\nenlarge it still more with examples and explanations, which are\nnecessary only from a _popular_ point of view. I was induced to take\nthis course from the consideration also that the present work is not\nintended for popular use, that those devoted to science do not require\nsuch helps, although they are always acceptable, and that they would\nhave materially interfered with my present purpose. Abb\u00e9 Terrasson\nremarks with great justice that, if we estimate the size of a work, not\nfrom the number of its pages, but from the time which we require to\nmake ourselves master of it, it may be said of many a book\u2014_that it\nwould be much shorter, if it were not so short_. On the other hand, as\nregards the comprehensibility of a system of speculative cognition,\nconnected under a single principle, we may say with equal justice: many\na book would have been much clearer, if it had not been intended to be\nso very clear. For explanations and examples, and other helps to\nintelligibility, aid us in the comprehension of _parts_, but they\ndistract the attention, dissipate the mental power of the reader, and\nstand in the way of his forming a clear conception of the _whole;_ as\nhe cannot attain soon enough to a survey of the system, and the\ncolouring and embellishments bestowed upon it prevent his observing its\narticulation or organization\u2014which is the most important consideration\nwith him, when he comes to judge of its unity and stability.\nThe reader must naturally have a strong inducement to co-operate with\nthe present author, if he has formed the intention of erecting a\ncomplete and solid edifice of metaphysical science, according to the\nplan now laid before him. Metaphysics, as here represented, is the only\nscience which admits of completion\u2014and with little labour, if it is\nunited, in a short time; so that nothing will be left to future\ngenerations except the task of illustrating and applying it\n_didactically_. For this science is nothing more than the inventory of\nall that is given us by _pure reason_, systematically arranged. Nothing\ncan escape our notice; for what reason produces from itself cannot lie\nconcealed, but must be brought to the light by reason itself, so soon\nas we have discovered the common principle of the ideas we seek. The\nperfect unity of this kind of cognitions, which are based upon pure\nconceptions, and uninfluenced by any empirical element, or any peculiar\nintuition leading to determinate experience, renders this completeness\nnot only practicable, but also necessary.\nTecum habita, et n\u00f4ris quam sit tibi curta supellex.\n\u2014Persius. Satirae iv. 52.\nSuch a system of pure speculative reason I hope to be able to publish\nunder the title of _Metaphysic of Nature_[2]. The content of this work\n(which will not be half so long) will be very much richer than that of\nthe present Critique, which has to discover the sources of this\ncognition and expose the conditions of its possibility, and at the same\ntime to clear and level a fit foundation for the scientific edifice. In\nthe present work, I look for the patient hearing and the impartiality\nof a _judge;_ in the other, for the good-will and assistance of a\n_co-labourer_. For, however complete the list of _principles_ for this\nsystem may be in the Critique, the correctness of the system requires\nthat no _deduced_ conceptions should be absent. These cannot be\npresented _\u00e0 priori_, but must be gradually discovered; and, while the\n_synthesis_ of conceptions has been fully exhausted in the Critique, it\nis necessary that, in the proposed work, the same should be the case\nwith their _analysis_. But this will be rather an amusement than a\nlabour.\n[2] In contradistinction to the Metaphysic of Ethics. This work was\nnever published.\nPREFACE TO THE SECOND EDITION 1787\nWhether the treatment of that portion of our knowledge which lies\nwithin the province of pure reason advances with that undeviating\ncertainty which characterizes the progress of _science_, we shall be at\nno loss to determine. If we find those who are engaged in metaphysical\npursuits, unable to come to an understanding as to the method which\nthey ought to follow; if we find them, after the most elaborate\npreparations, invariably brought to a stand before the goal is reached,\nand compelled to retrace their steps and strike into fresh paths, we\nmay then feel quite sure that they are far from having attained to the\ncertainty of scientific progress and may rather be said to be merely\ngroping about in the dark. In these circumstances we shall render an\nimportant service to reason if we succeed in simply indicating the path\nalong which it must travel, in order to arrive at any results\u2014even if\nit should be found necessary to abandon many of those aims which,\nwithout reflection, have been proposed for its attainment.\nThat _Logic_ has advanced in this sure course, even from the earliest\ntimes, is apparent from the fact that, since Aristotle, it has been\nunable to advance a step and, thus, to all appearance has reached its\ncompletion. For, if some of the moderns have thought to enlarge its\ndomain by introducing _psychological_ discussions on the mental\nfaculties, such as imagination and wit, _metaphysical_, discussions on\nthe origin of knowledge and the different kinds of certitude, according\nto the difference of the objects (idealism, scepticism, and so on), or\n_anthropological_ discussions on prejudices, their causes and remedies:\nthis attempt, on the part of these authors, only shows their ignorance\nof the peculiar nature of logical science. We do not enlarge but\ndisfigure the sciences when we lose sight of their respective limits\nand allow them to run into one another. Now logic is enclosed within\nlimits which admit of perfectly clear definition; it is a science which\nhas for its object nothing but the exposition and proof of the _formal_\nlaws of all thought, whether it be _\u00e0 priori_ or empirical, whatever be\nits origin or its object, and whatever the difficulties\u2014natural or\naccidental\u2014which it encounters in the human mind.\nThe early success of logic must be attributed exclusively to the\nnarrowness of its field, in which abstraction may, or rather must, be\nmade of all the objects of cognition with their characteristic\ndistinctions, and in which the understanding has only to deal with\nitself and with its own forms. It is, obviously, a much more difficult\ntask for reason to strike into the sure path of science, where it has\nto deal not simply with itself, but with objects external to itself.\nHence, logic is properly only a _prop\u00e6deutic_\u2014forms, as it were, the\nvestibule of the sciences; and while it is necessary to enable us to\nform a correct judgement with regard to the various branches of\nknowledge, still the acquisition of real, substantive knowledge is to\nbe sought only in the sciences properly so called, that is, in the\nobjective sciences.\nNow these sciences, if they can be termed rational at all, must contain\nelements of _\u00e0 priori_ cognition, and this cognition may stand in a\ntwofold relation to its object. Either it may have to _determine_ the\nconception of the object\u2014which must be supplied extraneously, or it may\nhave to _establish its reality_. The former is _theoretical_, the\nlatter _practical_, rational cognition. In both, the _pure_ or _\u00e0\npriori_ element must be treated first, and must be carefully\ndistinguished from that which is supplied from other sources. Any other\nmethod can only lead to irremediable confusion.\n_Mathematics_ and _physics_ are the two theoretical sciences which have\nto determine their objects _\u00e0 priori_. The former is purely _\u00e0 priori_,\nthe latter is partially so, but is also dependent on other sources of\ncognition.\nIn the earliest times of which history affords us any record,\n_mathematics_ had already entered on the sure course of science, among\nthat wonderful nation, the Greeks. Still it is not to be supposed that\nit was as easy for this science to strike into, or rather to construct\nfor itself, that royal road, as it was for logic, in which reason has\nonly to deal with itself. On the contrary, I believe that it must have\nremained long\u2014chiefly among the Egyptians\u2014in the stage of blind groping\nafter its true aims and destination, and that it was revolutionized by\nthe happy idea of one man, who struck out and determined for all time\nthe path which this science must follow, and which admits of an\nindefinite advancement. The history of this intellectual\nrevolution\u2014much more important in its results than the discovery of the\npassage round the celebrated Cape of Good Hope\u2014and of its author, has\nnot been preserved. But Diogenes Laertius, in naming the supposed\ndiscoverer of some of the simplest elements of geometrical\ndemonstration\u2014elements which, according to the ordinary opinion, do not\neven require to be proved\u2014makes it apparent that the change introduced\nby the first indication of this new path, must have seemed of the\nutmost importance to the mathematicians of that age, and it has thus\nbeen secured against the chance of oblivion. A new light must have\nflashed on the mind of the first man (_Thales_, or whatever may have\nbeen his name) who demonstrated the properties of the _isosceles_\ntriangle. For he found that it was not sufficient to meditate on the\nfigure, as it lay before his eyes, or the conception of it, as it\nexisted in his mind, and thus endeavour to get at the knowledge of its\nproperties, but that it was necessary to produce these properties, as\nit were, by a positive _\u00e0 priori construction;_ and that, in order to\narrive with certainty at _\u00e0 priori_ cognition, he must not attribute to\nthe object any other properties than those which necessarily followed\nfrom that which he had himself, in accordance with his conception,\nplaced in the object.\nA much longer period elapsed before _Physics_ entered on the highway of\nscience. For it is only about a century and a half since the wise BACON\ngave a new direction to physical studies, or rather\u2014as others were\nalready on the right track\u2014imparted fresh vigour to the pursuit of this\nnew direction. Here, too, as in the case of mathematics, we find\nevidence of a rapid intellectual revolution. In the remarks which\nfollow I shall confine myself to the _empirical_ side of natural\nscience.\nWhen GALILEI experimented with balls of a definite weight on the\ninclined plane, when TORRICELLI caused the air to sustain a weight\nwhich he had calculated beforehand to be equal to that of a definite\ncolumn of water, or when STAHL, at a later period, converted metals\ninto lime, and reconverted lime into metal, by the addition and\nsubtraction of certain elements;[3] a light broke upon all natural\nphilosophers. They learned that reason only perceives that which it\nproduces after its own design; that it must not be content to follow,\nas it were, in the leading-strings of nature, but must proceed in\nadvance with principles of judgement according to unvarying laws, and\ncompel nature to reply its questions. For accidental observations, made\naccording to no preconceived plan, cannot be united under a necessary\nlaw. But it is this that reason seeks for and requires. It is only the\nprinciples of reason which can give to concordant phenomena the\nvalidity of laws, and it is only when experiment is directed by these\nrational principles that it can have any real utility. Reason must\napproach nature with the view, indeed, of receiving information from\nit, not, however, in the character of a pupil, who listens to all that\nhis master chooses to tell him, but in that of a judge, who compels the\nwitnesses to reply to those questions which he himself thinks fit to\npropose. To this single idea must the revolution be ascribed, by which,\nafter groping in the dark for so many centuries, natural science was at\nlength conducted into the path of certain progress.\n[3] I do not here follow with exactness the history of the\nexperimental method, of which, indeed, the first steps are involved in\nsome obscurity.\nWe come now to _metaphysics_, a purely speculative science, which\noccupies a completely isolated position and is entirely independent of\nthe teachings of experience. It deals with mere conceptions\u2014not, like\nmathematics, with conceptions applied to intuition\u2014and in it, reason is\nthe pupil of itself alone. It is the oldest of the sciences, and would\nstill survive, even if all the rest were swallowed up in the abyss of\nan all-destroying barbarism. But it has not yet had the good fortune to\nattain to the sure scientific method. This will be apparent; if we\napply the tests which we proposed at the outset. We find that reason\nperpetually comes to a stand, when it attempts to gain _\u00e0 priori_ the\nperception even of those laws which the most common experience\nconfirms. We find it compelled to retrace its steps in innumerable\ninstances, and to abandon the path on which it had entered, because\nthis does not lead to the desired result. We find, too, that those who\nare engaged in metaphysical pursuits are far from being able to agree\namong themselves, but that, on the contrary, this science appears to\nfurnish an arena specially adapted for the display of skill or the\nexercise of strength in mock-contests\u2014a field in which no combatant\never yet succeeded in gaining an inch of ground, in which, at least, no\nvictory was ever yet crowned with permanent possession.\nThis leads us to inquire why it is that, in metaphysics, the sure path\nof science has not hitherto been found. Shall we suppose that it is\nimpossible to discover it? Why then should nature have visited our\nreason with restless aspirations after it, as if it were one of our\nweightiest concerns? Nay, more, how little cause should we have to\nplace confidence in our reason, if it abandons us in a matter about\nwhich, most of all, we desire to know the truth\u2014and not only so, but\neven allures us to the pursuit of vain phantoms, only to betray us in\nthe end? Or, if the path has only hitherto been missed, what\nindications do we possess to guide us in a renewed investigation, and\nto enable us to hope for greater success than has fallen to the lot of\nour predecessors?\nIt appears to me that the examples of mathematics and natural\nphilosophy, which, as we have seen, were brought into their present\ncondition by a sudden revolution, are sufficiently remarkable to fix\nour attention on the essential circumstances of the change which has\nproved so advantageous to them, and to induce us to make the experiment\nof imitating them, so far as the analogy which, as rational sciences,\nthey bear to metaphysics may permit. It has hitherto been assumed that\nour cognition must conform to the objects; but all attempts to\nascertain anything about these objects _\u00e0 priori_, by means of\nconceptions, and thus to extend the range of our knowledge, have been\nrendered abortive by this assumption. Let us then make the experiment\nwhether we may not be more successful in metaphysics, if we assume that\nthe objects must conform to our cognition. This appears, at all events,\nto accord better with the _possibility_ of our gaining the end we have\nin view, that is to say, of arriving at the cognition of objects _\u00e0\npriori_, of determining something with respect to these objects, before\nthey are given to us. We here propose to do just what COPERNICUS did in\nattempting to explain the celestial movements. When he found that he\ncould make no progress by assuming that all the heavenly bodies\nrevolved round the spectator, he reversed the process, and tried the\nexperiment of assuming that the spectator revolved, while the stars\nremained at rest. We may make the same experiment with regard to the\nintuition of objects. If the intuition must conform to the nature of\nthe objects, I do not see how we can know anything of them _\u00e0 priori_.\nIf, on the other hand, the object conforms to the nature of our faculty\nof intuition, I can then easily conceive the possibility of such an _\u00e0\npriori_ knowledge. Now as I cannot rest in the mere intuitions, but\u2014if\nthey are to become cognitions\u2014must refer them, as _representations_, to\nsomething, as _object_, and must determine the latter by means of the\nformer, here again there are two courses open to me. _Either_, first, I\nmay assume that the conceptions, by which I effect this determination,\nconform to the object\u2014and in this case I am reduced to the same\nperplexity as before; _or_ secondly, I may assume that the objects, or,\nwhich is the same thing, that _experience_, in which alone as given\nobjects they are cognized, conform to my conceptions\u2014and then I am at\nno loss how to proceed. For experience itself is a mode of cognition\nwhich requires understanding. Before objects, are given to me, that is,\n_\u00e0 priori_, I must presuppose in myself laws of the understanding which\nare expressed in conceptions _\u00e0 priori_. To these conceptions, then,\nall the objects of experience must necessarily conform. Now there are\nobjects which reason _thinks_, and that necessarily, but which cannot\nbe given in experience, or, at least, cannot be given _so_ as reason\nthinks them. The attempt to think these objects will hereafter furnish\nan excellent test of the new method of thought which we have adopted,\nand which is based on the principle that we only cognize in things _\u00e0\npriori_ that which we ourselves place in them.[4]\n[4] This method, accordingly, which we have borrowed from the natural\nphilosopher, consists in seeking for the elements of pure reason in\nthat _which admits of confirmation or refutation by experiment_. Now\nthe propositions of pure reason, especially when they transcend the\nlimits of possible experience, do not admit of our making any\nexperiment with their _objects_, as in natural science. Hence, with\nregard to those _conceptions_ and _principles_ which we assume _\u00e0\npriori_, our only course will be to view them from two different\nsides. We must regard one and the same conception, _on the one hand_,\nin relation to experience as an object of the senses and of the\nunderstanding, _on the other hand_, in relation to reason, isolated\nand transcending the limits of experience, as an object of mere\nthought. Now if we find that, when we regard things from this double\npoint of view, the result is in harmony with the principle of pure\nreason, but that, when we regard them from a single point of view,\nreason is involved in self-contradiction, then the experiment will\nestablish the correctness of this distinction.\nThis attempt succeeds as well as we could desire, and promises to\nmetaphysics, in its first part\u2014that is, where it is occupied with\nconceptions _\u00e0 priori_, of which the corresponding objects may be given\nin experience\u2014the certain course of science. For by this new method we\nare enabled perfectly to explain the possibility of _\u00e0 priori_\ncognition, and, what is more, to demonstrate satisfactorily the laws\nwhich lie _\u00e0 priori_ at the foundation of nature, as the sum of the\nobjects of experience\u2014neither of which was possible according to the\nprocedure hitherto followed. But from this deduction of the faculty of\n_\u00e0 priori_ cognition in the first part of metaphysics, we derive a\nsurprising result, and one which, to all appearance, militates against\nthe great end of metaphysics, as treated in the second part. For we\ncome to the conclusion that our faculty of cognition is unable to\ntranscend the limits of possible experience; and yet this is precisely\nthe most essential object of this science. The estimate of our rational\ncognition _\u00e0 priori_ at which we arrive is that it has only to do with\nphenomena, and that things in themselves, while possessing a real\nexistence, lie beyond its sphere. Here we are enabled to put the\njustice of this estimate to the test. For that which of necessity\nimpels us to transcend the limits of experience and of all phenomena is\nthe _unconditioned_, which reason absolutely requires in things as they\nare in themselves, in order to complete the series of conditions. Now,\nif it appears that when, on the one hand, we assume that our cognition\nconforms to its objects as things in themselves, _the unconditioned\ncannot be thought without contradiction_, and that when, on the other\nhand, we assume that our representation of things as they are given to\nus, does not conform to these things as they are in themselves, but\nthat these objects, as phenomena, conform to our mode of\nrepresentation, _the contradiction disappears:_ we shall then be\nconvinced of the truth of that which we began by assuming for the sake\nof experiment; we may look upon it as established that the\nunconditioned does not lie in things as we know them, or as they are\ngiven to us, but in things as they are in themselves, beyond the range\nof our cognition.[5]\n[5] This experiment of pure reason has a great similarity to that of\nthe _Chemists_, which they term the experiment of _reduction_, or,\nmore usually, the _synthetic_ process. The _analysis_ of the\nmetaphysician separates pure cognition _\u00e0 priori_ into two\nheterogeneous elements, viz., the cognition of things as phenomena,\nand of things in themselves. _Dialectic_ combines these again into\nharmony with the necessary rational idea of the unconditioned, and\nfinds that this harmony never results except through the above\ndistinction, which is, therefore, concluded to be just.\nBut, after we have thus denied the power of speculative reason to make\nany progress in the sphere of the supersensible, it still remains for\nour consideration whether data do not exist in _practical_ cognition\nwhich may enable us to determine the transcendent conception of the\nunconditioned, to rise beyond the limits of all possible experience\nfrom a _practical_ point of view, and thus to satisfy the great ends of\nmetaphysics. Speculative reason has thus, at least, made room for such\nan extension of our knowledge: and, if it must leave this space vacant,\nstill it does not rob us of the liberty to fill it up, if we can, by\nmeans of practical data\u2014nay, it even challenges us to make the\nattempt.[6]\n[6] So the central laws of the movements of the heavenly bodies\nestablished the truth of that which Copernicus, first, assumed only as\na hypothesis, and, at the same time, brought to light that invisible\nforce (Newtonian attraction) which holds the universe together. The\nlatter would have remained forever undiscovered, if Copernicus had not\nventured on the experiment\u2014contrary to the senses but still just\u2014of\nlooking for the observed movements not in the heavenly bodies, but in\nthe spectator. In this Preface I treat the new metaphysical method as\na hypothesis with the view of rendering apparent the first attempts at\nsuch a change of method, which are always hypothetical. But in the\nCritique itself it will be demonstrated, not hypothetically, but\napodeictically, from the nature of our representations of space and\ntime, and from the elementary conceptions of the understanding.\nThis attempt to introduce a complete revolution in the procedure of\nmetaphysics, after the _example_ of the geometricians and natural\nphilosophers, constitutes the aim of the Critique of Pure Speculative\nReason. It is a treatise on the method to be followed, not a system of\nthe science itself. But, at the same time, it marks out and defines\nboth the external boundaries and the internal structure of this\nscience. For pure speculative reason has this peculiarity, that, in\nchoosing the various objects of thought, it is able to define the\nlimits of its own faculties, and even to give a complete enumeration of\nthe possible modes of proposing problems to itself, and thus to sketch\nout the entire system of metaphysics. For, on the one hand, in\ncognition _\u00e0 priori_, nothing must be attributed to the objects but\nwhat the thinking subject derives from itself; and, on the other hand,\nreason is, in regard to the principles of cognition, a perfectly\ndistinct, independent unity, in which, as in an organized body, every\nmember exists for the sake of the others, and all for the sake of each,\nso that no principle can be viewed, with safety, in one relationship,\nunless it is, at the same time, viewed in relation to the total use of\npure reason. Hence, too, metaphysics has this singular advantage\u2014an\nadvantage which falls to the lot of no other science which has to do\nwith _objects_\u2014that, if once it is conducted into the sure path of\nscience, by means of this criticism, it can then take in the whole\nsphere of its cognitions, and can thus complete its work, and leave it\nfor the use of posterity, as a capital which can never receive fresh\naccessions. For metaphysics has to deal only with principles and with\nthe limitations of its own employment as determined by these\nprinciples. To this perfection it is, therefore, bound, as the\nfundamental science, to attain, and to it the maxim may justly be\napplied:\nNil actum reputans, si quid superesset agendum.\nBut, it will be asked, what kind of a treasure is this that we propose\nto bequeath to posterity? What is the real value of this system of\nmetaphysics, purified by criticism, and thereby reduced to a permanent\ncondition? A cursory view of the present work will lead to the\nsupposition that its use is merely _negative_, that it only serves to\nwarn us against venturing, with speculative reason, beyond the limits\nof experience. This is, in fact, its primary use. But this, at once,\nassumes a _positive_ value, when we observe that the principles with\nwhich speculative reason endeavours to transcend its limits lead\ninevitably, not to the _extension_, but to the _contraction_ of the use\nof reason, inasmuch as they threaten to extend the limits of\nsensibility, which is their proper sphere, over the entire realm of\nthought and, thus, to supplant the pure (practical) use of reason. So\nfar, then, as this criticism is occupied in confining speculative\nreason within its proper bounds, it is only negative; but, inasmuch as\nit thereby, at the same time, removes an obstacle which impedes and\neven threatens to destroy the use of practical reason, it possesses a\npositive and very important value. In order to admit this, we have only\nto be convinced that there is an absolutely necessary use of pure\nreason\u2014the moral use\u2014in which it inevitably transcends the limits of\nsensibility, without the aid of speculation, requiring only to be\ninsured against the effects of a speculation which would involve it in\ncontradiction with itself. To deny the positive advantage of the\nservice which this criticism renders us would be as absurd as to\nmaintain that the system of police is productive of no positive\nbenefit, since its main business is to prevent the violence which\ncitizen has to apprehend from citizen, that so each may pursue his\nvocation in peace and security. That space and time are only forms of\nsensible intuition, and hence are only conditions of the existence of\nthings as phenomena; that, moreover, we have no conceptions of the\nunderstanding, and, consequently, no elements for the cognition of\nthings, except in so far as a corresponding intuition can be given to\nthese conceptions; that, accordingly, we can have no cognition of an\nobject, as a thing in itself, but only as an object of sensible\nintuition, that is, as phenomenon\u2014all this is proved in the analytical\npart of the Critique; and from this the limitation of all possible\nspeculative cognition to the mere objects of _experience_, follows as a\nnecessary result. At the same time, it must be carefully borne in mind\nthat, while we surrender the power of _cognizing_, we still reserve the\npower of _thinking_ objects, as things in themselves.[7] For,\notherwise, we should require to affirm the existence of an appearance,\nwithout something that appears\u2014which would be absurd. Now let us\nsuppose, for a moment, that we had not undertaken this criticism and,\naccordingly, had not drawn the necessary distinction between things as\nobjects of experience and things as they are in themselves. The\nprinciple of causality, and, by consequence, the mechanism of nature as\ndetermined by causality, would then have absolute validity in relation\nto all things as efficient causes. I should then be unable to assert,\nwith regard to one and the same being, e.g., the human soul, that its\nwill is _free_, and yet, at the same time, subject to natural\nnecessity, that is, _not free_, without falling into a palpable\ncontradiction, for in both propositions I should take the soul in _the\nsame signification_, as a thing in general, as a thing in itself\u2014as,\nwithout previous criticism, I could not but take it. Suppose now, on\nthe other hand, that we _have_ undertaken this criticism, and have\nlearnt that an object may be taken in _two senses_, first, as a\nphenomenon, secondly, as a thing in itself; and that, according to the\ndeduction of the conceptions of the understanding, the principle of\ncausality has reference only to things in the first sense. We then see\nhow it does not involve any contradiction to assert, on the one hand,\nthat the will, in the phenomenal sphere\u2014in visible action\u2014is\nnecessarily obedient to the law of nature, and, in so far, _not free;_\nand, on the other hand, that, as belonging to a thing in itself, it is\nnot subject to that law, and, accordingly, is _free_. Now, it is true\nthat I cannot, by means of speculative reason, and still less by\nempirical observation, _cognize_ my soul as a thing in itself and\nconsequently, cannot cognize liberty as the property of a being to\nwhich I ascribe effects in the world of sense. For, to do so, I must\ncognize this being as existing, and yet not in time, which\u2014since I\ncannot support my conception by any intuition\u2014is impossible. At the\nsame time, while I cannot _cognize_, I can quite well _think_ freedom,\nthat is to say, my representation of it involves at least no\ncontradiction, if we bear in mind the critical distinction of the two\nmodes of representation (the sensible and the intellectual) and the\nconsequent limitation of the conceptions of the pure understanding and\nof the principles which flow from them. Suppose now that morality\nnecessarily presupposed liberty, in the strictest sense, as a property\nof our will; suppose that reason contained certain practical, original\nprinciples _\u00e0 priori_, which were absolutely impossible without this\npresupposition; and suppose, at the same time, that speculative reason\nhad proved that liberty was incapable of being thought at all. It would\nthen follow that the moral presupposition must give way to the\nspeculative affirmation, the opposite of which involves an obvious\ncontradiction, and that _liberty_ and, with it, morality must yield to\nthe _mechanism of nature;_ for the negation of morality involves no\ncontradiction, except on the presupposition of liberty. Now morality\ndoes not require the speculative cognition of liberty; it is enough\nthat I can think it, that its conception involves no contradiction,\nthat it does not interfere with the mechanism of nature. But even this\nrequirement we could not satisfy, if we had not learnt the twofold\nsense in which things may be taken; and it is only in this way that the\ndoctrine of morality and the doctrine of nature are confined within\ntheir proper limits. For this result, then, we are indebted to a\ncriticism which warns us of our unavoidable ignorance with regard to\nthings in themselves, and establishes the necessary limitation of our\ntheoretical _cognition_ to mere phenomena.\n[7] In order to _cognize_ an object, I must be able to prove its\npossibility, either from its reality as attested by experience, or _\u00e0\npriori_, by means of reason. But I can _think_ what I please, provided\nonly I do not contradict myself; that is, provided my conception is a\npossible thought, though I may be unable to answer for the existence\nof a corresponding object in the sum of possibilities. But something\nmore is required before I can attribute to such a conception objective\nvalidity, that is real possibility\u2014the other possibility being merely\nlogical. We are not, however, confined to theoretical sources of\ncognition for the means of satisfying this additional requirement, but\nmay derive them from practical sources.\nThe positive value of the critical principles of pure reason in\nrelation to the conception of _God_ and of the _simple nature_ of the\n_soul_, admits of a similar exemplification; but on this point I shall\nnot dwell. I cannot even make the assumption\u2014as the practical interests\nof morality require\u2014of God, freedom, and immortality, if I do not\ndeprive speculative reason of its pretensions to transcendent insight.\nFor to arrive at these, it must make use of principles which, in fact,\nextend only to the objects of possible experience, and which cannot be\napplied to objects beyond this sphere without converting them into\nphenomena, and thus rendering the _practical extension_ of pure reason\nimpossible. I must, therefore, abolish _knowledge_, to make room for\n_belief_. The dogmatism of metaphysics, that is, the presumption that\nit is possible to advance in metaphysics without previous criticism, is\nthe true source of the unbelief (always dogmatic) which militates\nagainst morality.\nThus, while it may be no very difficult task to bequeath a legacy to\nposterity, in the shape of a system of metaphysics constructed in\naccordance with the Critique of Pure Reason, still the value of such a\nbequest is not to be depreciated. It will render an important service\nto reason, by substituting the certainty of scientific method for that\nrandom groping after results without the guidance of principles, which\nhas hitherto characterized the pursuit of metaphysical studies. It will\nrender an important service to the inquiring mind of youth, by leading\nthe student to apply his powers to the cultivation of genuine science,\ninstead of wasting them, as at present, on speculations which can never\nlead to any result, or on the idle attempt to invent new ideas and\nopinions. But, above all, it will confer an inestimable benefit on\nmorality and religion, by showing that all the objections urged against\nthem may be silenced for ever by the _Socratic_ method, that is to say,\nby proving the ignorance of the objector. For, as the world has never\nbeen, and, no doubt, never will be without a system of metaphysics of\none kind or another, it is the highest and weightiest concern of\nphilosophy to render it powerless for harm, by closing up the sources\nof error.\nThis important change in the field of the sciences, this loss of its\nfancied possessions, to which speculative reason must submit, does not\nprove in any way detrimental to the general interests of humanity. The\nadvantages which the world has derived from the teachings of pure\nreason are not at all impaired. The loss falls, in its whole extent, on\nthe _monopoly of the schools_, but does not in the slightest degree\ntouch the _interests of mankind_. I appeal to the most obstinate\ndogmatist, whether the proof of the continued existence of the soul\nafter death, derived from the simplicity of its substance; of the\nfreedom of the will in opposition to the general mechanism of nature,\ndrawn from the subtle but impotent distinction of subjective and\nobjective practical necessity; or of the existence of God, deduced from\nthe conception of an _ens realissimum_\u2014the contingency of the\nchangeable, and the necessity of a prime mover, has ever been able to\npass beyond the limits of the schools, to penetrate the public mind, or\nto exercise the slightest influence on its convictions. It must be\nadmitted that this has not been the case and that, owing to the\nunfitness of the common understanding for such subtle speculations, it\ncan never be expected to take place. On the contrary, it is plain that\n_the hope of a future life_ arises from the feeling, which exists in\nthe breast of every man, that the temporal is inadequate to meet and\nsatisfy the demands of his nature. In like manner, it cannot be doubted\nthat the clear exhibition of duties in opposition to all the claims of\ninclination, gives rise to the consciousness of _freedom_, and that the\nglorious order, beauty, and providential care, everywhere displayed in\nnature, give rise to the belief in a wise and great Author of the\nUniverse. Such is the genesis of these general convictions of mankind,\nso far as they depend on rational grounds; and this public property not\nonly remains undisturbed, but is even raised to greater importance, by\nthe doctrine that the schools have no right to arrogate to themselves a\nmore profound insight into a matter of general human concernment than\nthat to which the great mass of men, ever held by us in the highest\nestimation, can without difficulty attain, and that the schools should,\ntherefore, confine themselves to the elaboration of these universally\ncomprehensible and, from a moral point of view, amply satisfactory\nproofs. The change, therefore, affects only the arrogant pretensions of\nthe schools, which would gladly retain, in their own exclusive\npossession, the key to the truths which they impart to the public.\nQuod mecum nescit, solus vult scire videri.\nAt the same time it does not deprive the speculative philosopher of his\njust title to be the sole depositor of a science which benefits the\npublic without its knowledge\u2014I mean, the Critique of Pure Reason. This\ncan never become popular and, indeed, has no occasion to be so; for\nfinespun arguments in favour of useful truths make just as little\nimpression on the public mind as the equally subtle objections brought\nagainst these truths. On the other hand, since both inevitably force\nthemselves on every man who rises to the height of speculation, it\nbecomes the manifest duty of the schools to enter upon a thorough\ninvestigation of the rights of speculative reason and, thus, to prevent\nthe scandal which metaphysical controversies are sure, sooner or later,\nto cause even to the masses. It is only by criticism that\nmetaphysicians (and, as such, theologians too) can be saved from these\ncontroversies and from the consequent perversion of their doctrines.\nCriticism alone can strike a blow at the root of materialism, fatalism,\natheism, free-thinking, fanaticism, and superstition, which are\nuniversally injurious\u2014as well as of idealism and scepticism, which are\ndangerous to the schools, but can scarcely pass over to the public. If\ngovernments think proper to interfere with the affairs of the learned,\nit would be more consistent with a wise regard for the interests of\nscience, as well as for those of society, to favour a criticism of this\nkind, by which alone the labours of reason can be established on a firm\nbasis, than to support the ridiculous despotism of the schools, which\nraise a loud cry of danger to the public over the destruction of\ncobwebs, of which the public has never taken any notice, and the loss\nof which, therefore, it can never feel.\nThis critical science is not opposed to the _dogmatic procedure_ of\nreason in pure cognition; for pure cognition must always be dogmatic,\nthat is, must rest on strict demonstration from sure principles _\u00e0\npriori_\u2014but to _dogmatism_, that is, to the presumption that it is\npossible to make any progress with a pure cognition, derived from\n(philosophical) conceptions, according to the principles which reason\nhas long been in the habit of employing\u2014without first inquiring in what\nway and by what right reason has come into the possession of these\nprinciples. Dogmatism is thus the dogmatic procedure of pure reason\n_without previous criticism of its own powers_, and in opposing this\nprocedure, we must not be supposed to lend any countenance to that\nloquacious shallowness which arrogates to itself the name of\npopularity, nor yet to scepticism, which makes short work with the\nwhole science of metaphysics. On the contrary, our criticism is the\nnecessary preparation for a thoroughly scientific system of metaphysics\nwhich must perform its task entirely _\u00e0 priori_, to the complete\nsatisfaction of speculative reason, and must, therefore, be treated,\nnot popularly, but scholastically. In carrying out the plan which the\nCritique prescribes, that is, in the future system of metaphysics, we\nmust have recourse to the strict method of the celebrated WOLF, the\ngreatest of all dogmatic philosophers. He was the first to point out\nthe necessity of establishing fixed principles, of clearly defining our\nconceptions, and of subjecting our demonstrations to the most severe\nscrutiny, instead of rashly jumping at conclusions. The example which\nhe set served to awaken that spirit of profound and thorough\ninvestigation which is not yet extinct in Germany. He would have been\npeculiarly well fitted to give a truly scientific character to\nmetaphysical studies, had it occurred to him to prepare the field by a\ncriticism of the _organum_, that is, of pure reason itself. That he\nfailed to perceive the necessity of such a procedure must be ascribed\nto the dogmatic mode of thought which characterized his age, and on\nthis point the philosophers of his time, as well as of all previous\ntimes, have nothing to reproach each other with. Those who reject at\nonce the method of Wolf, and of the Critique of Pure Reason, can have\nno other aim but to shake off the fetters of _science_, to change\nlabour into sport, certainty into opinion, and philosophy into\nphilodoxy.\nIn this _second edition_, I have endeavoured, as far as possible, to\nremove the difficulties and obscurity which, without fault of mine\nperhaps, have given rise to many misconceptions even among acute\nthinkers. In the propositions themselves, and in the demonstrations by\nwhich they are supported, as well as in the form and the entire plan of\nthe work, I have found nothing to alter; which must be attributed\npartly to the long examination to which I had subjected the whole\nbefore offering it to the public and partly to the nature of the case.\nFor pure speculative reason is an organic structure in which there is\nnothing isolated or independent, but every Single part is essential to\nall the rest; and hence, the slightest imperfection, whether defect or\npositive error, could not fail to betray itself in use. I venture,\nfurther, to hope, that this system will maintain the same unalterable\ncharacter for the future. I am led to entertain this confidence, not by\nvanity, but by the evidence which the equality of the result affords,\nwhen we proceed, first, from the simplest elements up to the complete\nwhole of pure reason and, and then, backwards from the whole to each\npart. We find that the attempt to make the slightest alteration, in any\npart, leads inevitably to contradictions, not merely in this system,\nbut in human reason itself. At the same time, there is still much room\nfor improvement in the _exposition_ of the doctrines contained in this\nwork. In the present edition, I have endeavoured to remove\nmisapprehensions of the \u00e6sthetical part, especially with regard to the\nconception of time; to clear away the obscurity which has been found in\nthe deduction of the conceptions of the understanding; to supply the\nsupposed want of sufficient evidence in the demonstration of the\nprinciples of the pure understanding; and, lastly, to obviate the\nmisunderstanding of the paralogisms which immediately precede the\nRational Psychology. Beyond this point\u2014the end of the second main\ndivision of the \u201cTranscendental Dialectic\u201d\u2014I have not extended my\nalterations,[8] partly from want of time, and partly because I am not\naware that any portion of the remainder has given rise to\nmisconceptions among intelligent and impartial critics, whom I do not\nhere mention with that praise which is their due, but who will find\nthat their suggestions have been attended to in the work itself.\n[8] The only addition, properly so called\u2014and that only in the method\nof proof\u2014which I have made in the present edition, consists of a new\nrefutation of psychological _Idealism_, and a strict demonstration\u2014the\nonly one possible, as I believe\u2014of the objective reality of external\nintuition. However harmless idealism may be considered\u2014although in\nreality it is not so\u2014in regard to the essential ends of metaphysics,\nit must still remain a scandal to philosophy and to the general human\nreason to be obliged to assume, as an article of mere belief, the\nexistence of things external to ourselves (from which, yet, we derive\nthe whole material of cognition for the internal sense), and not to be\nable to oppose a satisfactory proof to any one who may call it in\nquestion. As there is some obscurity of expression in the\ndemonstration as it stands in the text, I propose to alter the passage\nin question as follows: \u201cBut this permanent cannot be an intuition in\nme. For all the determining grounds of my existence which can be found\nin me are representations and, as such, do themselves require a\npermanent, distinct from them, which may determine my existence in\nrelation to their changes, that is, my existence in time, wherein they\nchange.\u201d It may, probably, be urged in opposition to this proof that,\nafter all, I am only conscious immediately of that which is in me,\nthat is, of my _representation_ of external things, and that,\nconsequently, it must always remain uncertain whether anything\ncorresponding to this representation does or does not exist externally\nto me. But I am conscious, through internal _experience_, of my\n_existence in time_ (consequently, also, of the determinability of the\nformer in the latter), and that is more than the simple consciousness\nof my representation. It is, in fact, the same as the _empirical\nconsciousness of my existence_, which can only be determined in\nrelation to something, which, while connected with my existence, is\n_external to me_. This consciousness of my existence in time is,\ntherefore, identical with the consciousness of a relation to something\nexternal to me, and it is, therefore, experience, not fiction, sense,\nnot imagination, which inseparably connects the external with my\ninternal sense. For the external sense is, in itself, the relation of\nintuition to something real, external to me; and the reality of this\nsomething, as opposed to the mere imagination of it, rests solely on\nits inseparable connection with internal experience as the condition\nof its possibility. If with the _intellectual consciousness_ of my\nexistence, in the representation: _I am_, which accompanies all my\njudgements, and all the operations of my understanding, I could, at\nthe same time, connect a determination of my existence by\n_intellectual intuition_, then the consciousness of a relation to\nsomething external to me would not be necessary. But the internal\nintuition in which alone my existence can be determined, though\npreceded by that purely intellectual consciousness, is itself sensible\nand attached to the condition of time. Hence this determination of my\nexistence, and consequently my internal experience itself, must depend\non something permanent which is not in me, which can be, therefore,\nonly in something external to me, to which I must look upon myself as\nbeing related. Thus the reality of the external sense is necessarily\nconnected with that of the internal, in order to the possibility of\nexperience in general; that is, I am just as certainly conscious that\nthere are things external to me related to my sense as I am that I\nmyself exist as determined in time. But in order to ascertain to what\ngiven intuitions objects, external me, really correspond, in other\nwords, what intuitions belong to the external sense and not to\nimagination, I must have recourse, in every particular case, to those\nrules according to which experience in general (even internal\nexperience) is distinguished from imagination, and which are always\nbased on the proposition that there really is an external\nexperience.\u2014We may add the remark that the representation of something\n_permanent_ in existence, is not the same thing as the _permanent\nrepresentation;_ for a representation may be very variable and\nchanging\u2014as all our representations, even that of matter, are\u2014and yet\nrefer to something permanent, which must, therefore, be distinct from\nall my representations and external to me, the existence of which is\nnecessarily included in the determination of my own existence, and\nwith it constitutes _one_ experience\u2014an experience which would not\neven be possible internally, if it were not also at the same time, in\npart, external. To the question _How?_ we are no more able to reply,\nthan we are, in general, to think the stationary in time, the\ncoexistence of which with the variable, produces the conception of\nchange.\nIn attempting to render the exposition of my views as intelligible as\npossible, I have been compelled to leave out or abridge various\npassages which were not essential to the completeness of the work, but\nwhich many readers might consider useful in other respects, and might\nbe unwilling to miss. This trifling loss, which could not be avoided\nwithout swelling the book beyond due limits, may be supplied, at the\npleasure of the reader, by a comparison with the first edition, and\nwill, I hope, be more than compensated for by the greater clearness of\nthe exposition as it now stands.\nI have observed, with pleasure and thankfulness, in the pages of\nvarious reviews and treatises, that the spirit of profound and thorough\ninvestigation is not extinct in Germany, though it may have been\noverborne and silenced for a time by the fashionable tone of a licence\nin thinking, which gives itself the airs of genius, and that the\ndifficulties which beset the paths of criticism have not prevented\nenergetic and acute thinkers from making themselves masters of the\nscience of pure reason to which these paths conduct\u2014a science which is\nnot popular, but scholastic in its character, and which alone can hope\nfor a lasting existence or possess an abiding value. To these deserving\nmen, who so happily combine profundity of view with a talent for lucid\nexposition\u2014a talent which I myself am not conscious of possessing\u2014I\nleave the task of removing any obscurity which may still adhere to the\nstatement of my doctrines. For, in this case, the danger is not that of\nbeing refuted, but of being misunderstood. For my own part, I must\nhenceforward abstain from controversy, although I shall carefully\nattend to all suggestions, whether from friends or adversaries, which\nmay be of use in the future elaboration of the system of this\nProp\u00e6deutic. As, during these labours, I have advanced pretty far in\nyears this month I reach my sixty-fourth year\u2014it will be necessary for\nme to economize time, if I am to carry out my plan of elaborating the\nmetaphysics of nature as well as of morals, in confirmation of the\ncorrectness of the principles established in this Critique of Pure\nReason, both speculative and practical; and I must, therefore, leave\nthe task of clearing up the obscurities of the present work\u2014inevitable,\nperhaps, at the outset\u2014as well as, the defence of the whole, to those\ndeserving men, who have made my system their own. A philosophical\nsystem cannot come forward armed at all points like a mathematical\ntreatise, and hence it may be quite possible to take objection to\nparticular passages, while the organic structure of the system,\nconsidered as a unity, has no danger to apprehend. But few possess the\nability, and still fewer the inclination, to take a comprehensive view\nof a new system. By confining the view to particular passages, taking\nthese out of their connection and comparing them with one another, it\nis easy to pick out apparent contradictions, especially in a work\nwritten with any freedom of style. These contradictions place the work\nin an unfavourable light in the eyes of those who rely on the judgement\nof others, but are easily reconciled by those who have mastered the\nidea of the whole. If a theory possesses stability in itself, the\naction and reaction which seemed at first to threaten its existence\nserve only, in the course of time, to smooth down any superficial\nroughness or inequality, and\u2014if men of insight, impartiality, and truly\npopular gifts, turn their attention to it\u2014to secure to it, in a short\ntime, the requisite elegance also.\nK\u00d6NIGSBERG, _April_ 1787.\nIntroduction\nI. Of the difference between Pure and Empirical Knowledge\nThat all our knowledge begins with experience there can be no doubt.\nFor how is it possible that the faculty of cognition should be awakened\ninto exercise otherwise than by means of objects which affect our\nsenses, and partly of themselves produce representations, partly rouse\nour powers of understanding into activity, to compare to connect, or to\nseparate these, and so to convert the raw material of our sensuous\nimpressions into a knowledge of objects, which is called experience? In\nrespect of time, therefore, no knowledge of ours is antecedent to\nexperience, but begins with it.\nBut, though all our knowledge begins with experience, it by no means\nfollows that all arises out of experience. For, on the contrary, it is\nquite possible that our empirical knowledge is a compound of that which\nwe receive through impressions, and that which the faculty of cognition\nsupplies from itself (sensuous impressions giving merely the occasion),\nan addition which we cannot distinguish from the original element given\nby sense, till long practice has made us attentive to, and skilful in\nseparating it. It is, therefore, a question which requires close\ninvestigation, and not to be answered at first sight, whether there\nexists a knowledge altogether independent of experience, and even of\nall sensuous impressions? Knowledge of this kind is called \u00e0 priori, in\ncontradistinction to empirical knowledge, which has its sources \u00e0\nposteriori, that is, in experience.\nBut the expression, \u201c\u00e0 priori,\u201d is not as yet definite enough\nadequately to indicate the whole meaning of the question above started.\nFor, in speaking of knowledge which has its sources in experience, we\nare wont to say, that this or that may be known \u00e0 priori, because we do\nnot derive this knowledge immediately from experience, but from a\ngeneral rule, which, however, we have itself borrowed from experience.\nThus, if a man undermined his house, we say, \u201che might know \u00e0 priori\nthat it would have fallen;\u201d that is, he needed not to have waited for\nthe experience that it did actually fall. But still, \u00e0 priori, he could\nnot know even this much. For, that bodies are heavy, and, consequently,\nthat they fall when their supports are taken away, must have been known\nto him previously, by means of experience.\nBy the term \u201cknowledge \u00e0 priori,\u201d therefore, we shall in the sequel\nunderstand, not such as is independent of this or that kind of\nexperience, but such as is absolutely so of all experience. Opposed to\nthis is empirical knowledge, or that which is possible only \u00e0\nposteriori, that is, through experience. Knowledge \u00e0 priori is either\npure or impure. Pure knowledge \u00e0 priori is that with which no empirical\nelement is mixed up. For example, the proposition, \u201cEvery change has a\ncause,\u201d is a proposition \u00e0 priori, but impure, because change is a\nconception which can only be derived from experience.\nII. The Human Intellect, even in an Unphilosophical State, is in\nPossession of Certain Cognitions \u201c\u00e0 priori\u201d.\nThe question now is as to a criterion, by which we may securely\ndistinguish a pure from an empirical cognition. Experience no doubt\nteaches us that this or that object is constituted in such and such a\nmanner, but not that it could not possibly exist otherwise. Now, in the\nfirst place, if we have a proposition which contains the idea of\nnecessity in its very conception, it is priori. If, moreover, it is not\nderived from any other proposition, unless from one equally involving\nthe idea of necessity, it is absolutely priori. Secondly, an empirical\njudgement never exhibits strict and absolute, but only assumed and\ncomparative universality (by induction); therefore, the most we can say\nis\u2014so far as we have hitherto observed, there is no exception to this\nor that rule. If, on the other hand, a judgement carries with it strict\nand absolute universality, that is, admits of no possible exception, it\nis not derived from experience, but is valid absolutely \u00e0 priori.\nEmpirical universality is, therefore, only an arbitrary extension of\nvalidity, from that which may be predicated of a proposition valid in\nmost cases, to that which is asserted of a proposition which holds good\nin all; as, for example, in the affirmation, \u201cAll bodies are heavy.\u201d\nWhen, on the contrary, strict universality characterizes a judgement,\nit necessarily indicates another peculiar source of knowledge, namely,\na faculty of cognition \u00e0 priori. Necessity and strict universality,\ntherefore, are infallible tests for distinguishing pure from empirical\nknowledge, and are inseparably connected with each other. But as in the\nuse of these criteria the empirical limitation is sometimes more easily\ndetected than the contingency of the judgement, or the unlimited\nuniversality which we attach to a judgement is often a more convincing\nproof than its necessity, it may be advisable to use the criteria\nseparately, each being by itself infallible.\nNow, that in the sphere of human cognition we have judgements which are\nnecessary, and in the strictest sense universal, consequently pure \u00e0\npriori, it will be an easy matter to show. If we desire an example from\nthe sciences, we need only take any proposition in mathematics. If we\ncast our eyes upon the commonest operations of the understanding, the\nproposition, \u201cEvery change must have a cause,\u201d will amply serve our\npurpose. In the latter case, indeed, the conception of a cause so\nplainly involves the conception of a necessity of connection with an\neffect, and of a strict universality of the law, that the very notion\nof a cause would entirely disappear, were we to derive it, like Hume,\nfrom a frequent association of what happens with that which precedes;\nand the habit thence originating of connecting representations\u2014the\nnecessity inherent in the judgement being therefore merely subjective.\nBesides, without seeking for such examples of principles existing \u00e0\npriori in cognition, we might easily show that such principles are the\nindispensable basis of the possibility of experience itself, and\nconsequently prove their existence \u00e0 priori. For whence could our\nexperience itself acquire certainty, if all the rules on which it\ndepends were themselves empirical, and consequently fortuitous? No one,\ntherefore, can admit the validity of the use of such rules as first\nprinciples. But, for the present, we may content ourselves with having\nestablished the fact, that we do possess and exercise a faculty of pure\n\u00e0 priori cognition; and, secondly, with having pointed out the proper\ntests of such cognition, namely, universality and necessity.\nNot only in judgements, however, but even in conceptions, is an \u00e0\npriori origin manifest. For example, if we take away by degrees from\nour conceptions of a body all that can be referred to mere sensuous\nexperience\u2014colour, hardness or softness, weight, even\nimpenetrability\u2014the body will then vanish; but the space which it\noccupied still remains, and this it is utterly impossible to annihilate\nin thought. Again, if we take away, in like manner, from our empirical\nconception of any object, corporeal or incorporeal, all properties\nwhich mere experience has taught us to connect with it, still we cannot\nthink away those through which we cogitate it as substance, or adhering\nto substance, although our conception of substance is more determined\nthan that of an object. Compelled, therefore, by that necessity with\nwhich the conception of substance forces itself upon us, we must\nconfess that it has its seat in our faculty of cognition \u00e0 priori.\nIII. Philosophy stands in need of a Science which shall Determine the\nPossibility, Principles, and Extent of Human Knowledge \u201c\u00e0 priori\u201d\nOf far more importance than all that has been above said, is the\nconsideration that certain of our cognitions rise completely above the\nsphere of all possible experience, and by means of conceptions, to\nwhich there exists in the whole extent of experience no corresponding\nobject, seem to extend the range of our judgements beyond its bounds.\nAnd just in this transcendental or supersensible sphere, where\nexperience affords us neither instruction nor guidance, lie the\ninvestigations of reason, which, on account of their importance, we\nconsider far preferable to, and as having a far more elevated aim than,\nall that the understanding can achieve within the sphere of sensuous\nphenomena. So high a value do we set upon these investigations, that\neven at the risk of error, we persist in following them out, and permit\nneither doubt nor disregard nor indifference to restrain us from the\npursuit. These unavoidable problems of mere pure reason are God,\nfreedom (of will), and immortality. The science which, with all its\npreliminaries, has for its especial object the solution of these\nproblems is named metaphysics\u2014a science which is at the very outset\ndogmatical, that is, it confidently takes upon itself the execution of\nthis task without any previous investigation of the ability or\ninability of reason for such an undertaking.\nNow the safe ground of experience being thus abandoned, it seems\nnevertheless natural that we should hesitate to erect a building with\nthe cognitions we possess, without knowing whence they come, and on the\nstrength of principles, the origin of which is undiscovered. Instead of\nthus trying to build without a foundation, it is rather to be expected\nthat we should long ago have put the question, how the understanding\ncan arrive at these \u00e0 priori cognitions, and what is the extent,\nvalidity, and worth which they may possess? We say, \u201cThis is natural\nenough,\u201d meaning by the word natural, that which is consistent with a\njust and reasonable way of thinking; but if we understand by the term,\nthat which usually happens, nothing indeed could be more natural and\nmore comprehensible than that this investigation should be left long\nunattempted. For one part of our pure knowledge, the science of\nmathematics, has been long firmly established, and thus leads us to\nform flattering expectations with regard to others, though these may be\nof quite a different nature. Besides, when we get beyond the bounds of\nexperience, we are of course safe from opposition in that quarter; and\nthe charm of widening the range of our knowledge is so great that,\nunless we are brought to a standstill by some evident contradiction, we\nhurry on undoubtingly in our course. This, however, may be avoided, if\nwe are sufficiently cautious in the construction of our fictions, which\nare not the less fictions on that account.\nMathematical science affords us a brilliant example, how far,\nindependently of all experience, we may carry our \u00e0 priori knowledge.\nIt is true that the mathematician occupies himself with objects and\ncognitions only in so far as they can be represented by means of\nintuition. But this circumstance is easily overlooked, because the said\nintuition can itself be given \u00e0 priori, and therefore is hardly to be\ndistinguished from a mere pure conception. Deceived by such a proof of\nthe power of reason, we can perceive no limits to the extension of our\nknowledge. The light dove cleaving in free flight the thin air, whose\nresistance it feels, might imagine that her movements would be far more\nfree and rapid in airless space. Just in the same way did Plato,\nabandoning the world of sense because of the narrow limits it sets to\nthe understanding, venture upon the wings of ideas beyond it, into the\nvoid space of pure intellect. He did not reflect that he made no real\nprogress by all his efforts; for he met with no resistance which might\nserve him for a support, as it were, whereon to rest, and on which he\nmight apply his powers, in order to let the intellect acquire momentum\nfor its progress. It is, indeed, the common fate of human reason in\nspeculation, to finish the imposing edifice of thought as rapidly as\npossible, and then for the first time to begin to examine whether the\nfoundation is a solid one or no. Arrived at this point, all sorts of\nexcuses are sought after, in order to console us for its want of\nstability, or rather, indeed, to enable Us to dispense altogether with\nso late and dangerous an investigation. But what frees us during the\nprocess of building from all apprehension or suspicion, and flatters us\ninto the belief of its solidity, is this. A great part, perhaps the\ngreatest part, of the business of our reason consists in the\nanalysation of the conceptions which we already possess of objects. By\nthis means we gain a multitude of cognitions, which although really\nnothing more than elucidations or explanations of that which (though in\na confused manner) was already thought in our conceptions, are, at\nleast in respect of their form, prized as new introspections; whilst,\nso far as regards their matter or content, we have really made no\naddition to our conceptions, but only disinvolved them. But as this\nprocess does furnish a real priori knowledge, which has a sure progress\nand useful results, reason, deceived by this, slips in, without being\nitself aware of it, assertions of a quite different kind; in which, to\ngiven conceptions it adds others, \u00e0 priori indeed, but entirely foreign\nto them, without our knowing how it arrives at these, and, indeed,\nwithout such a question ever suggesting itself. I shall therefore at\nonce proceed to examine the difference between these two modes of\nknowledge.\nIV. Of the Difference Between Analytical and Synthetical Judgements.\nIn all judgements wherein the relation of a subject to the predicate is\ncogitated (I mention affirmative judgements only here; the application\nto negative will be very easy), this relation is possible in two\ndifferent ways. Either the predicate B belongs to the subject A, as\nsomewhat which is contained (though covertly) in the conception A; or\nthe predicate B lies completely out of the conception A, although it\nstands in connection with it. In the first instance, I term the\njudgement analytical, in the second, synthetical. Analytical judgements\n(affirmative) are therefore those in which the connection of the\npredicate with the subject is cogitated through identity; those in\nwhich this connection is cogitated without identity, are called\nsynthetical judgements. The former may be called explicative, the\nlatter augmentative judgements; because the former add in the predicate\nnothing to the conception of the subject, but only analyse it into its\nconstituent conceptions, which were thought already in the subject,\nalthough in a confused manner; the latter add to our conceptions of the\nsubject a predicate which was not contained in it, and which no\nanalysis could ever have discovered therein. For example, when I say,\n\u201cAll bodies are extended,\u201d this is an analytical judgement. For I need\nnot go beyond the conception of body in order to find extension\nconnected with it, but merely analyse the conception, that is, become\nconscious of the manifold properties which I think in that conception,\nin order to discover this predicate in it: it is therefore an\nanalytical judgement. On the other hand, when I say, \u201cAll bodies are\nheavy,\u201d the predicate is something totally different from that which I\nthink in the mere conception of a body. By the addition of such a\npredicate, therefore, it becomes a synthetical judgement.\nJudgements of experience, as such, are always synthetical. For it would\nbe absurd to think of grounding an analytical judgement on experience,\nbecause in forming such a judgement I need not go out of the sphere of\nmy conceptions, and therefore recourse to the testimony of experience\nis quite unnecessary. That \u201cbodies are extended\u201d is not an empirical\njudgement, but a proposition which stands firm \u00e0 priori. For before\naddressing myself to experience, I already have in my conception all\nthe requisite conditions for the judgement, and I have only to extract\nthe predicate from the conception, according to the principle of\ncontradiction, and thereby at the same time become conscious of the\nnecessity of the judgement, a necessity which I could never learn from\nexperience. On the other hand, though at first I do not at all include\nthe predicate of weight in my conception of body in general, that\nconception still indicates an object of experience, a part of the\ntotality of experience, to which I can still add other parts; and this\nI do when I recognize by observation that bodies are heavy. I can\ncognize beforehand by analysis the conception of body through the\ncharacteristics of extension, impenetrability, shape, etc., all which\nare cogitated in this conception. But now I extend my knowledge, and\nlooking back on experience from which I had derived this conception of\nbody, I find weight at all times connected with the above\ncharacteristics, and therefore I synthetically add to my conceptions\nthis as a predicate, and say, \u201cAll bodies are heavy.\u201d Thus it is\nexperience upon which rests the possibility of the synthesis of the\npredicate of weight with the conception of body, because both\nconceptions, although the one is not contained in the other, still\nbelong to one another (only contingently, however), as parts of a\nwhole, namely, of experience, which is itself a synthesis of\nintuitions.\nBut to synthetical judgements \u00e0 priori, such aid is entirely wanting.\nIf I go out of and beyond the conception A, in order to recognize\nanother B as connected with it, what foundation have I to rest on,\nwhereby to render the synthesis possible? I have here no longer the\nadvantage of looking out in the sphere of experience for what I want.\nLet us take, for example, the proposition, \u201cEverything that happens has\na cause.\u201d In the conception of \u201csomething that happens,\u201d I indeed think\nan existence which a certain time antecedes, and from this I can derive\nanalytical judgements. But the conception of a cause lies quite out of\nthe above conception, and indicates something entirely different from\n\u201cthat which happens,\u201d and is consequently not contained in that\nconception. How then am I able to assert concerning the general\nconception\u2014\u201cthat which happens\u201d\u2014something entirely different from that\nconception, and to recognize the conception of cause although not\ncontained in it, yet as belonging to it, and even necessarily? what is\nhere the unknown = X, upon which the understanding rests when it\nbelieves it has found, out of the conception A a foreign predicate B,\nwhich it nevertheless considers to be connected with it? It cannot be\nexperience, because the principle adduced annexes the two\nrepresentations, cause and effect, to the representation existence, not\nonly with universality, which experience cannot give, but also with the\nexpression of necessity, therefore completely \u00e0 priori and from pure\nconceptions. Upon such synthetical, that is augmentative propositions,\ndepends the whole aim of our speculative knowledge \u00e0 priori; for\nalthough analytical judgements are indeed highly important and\nnecessary, they are so, only to arrive at that clearness of conceptions\nwhich is requisite for a sure and extended synthesis, and this alone is\na real acquisition.\nV. In all Theoretical Sciences of Reason, Synthetical Judgements \u201c\u00e0\npriori\u201d are contained as Principles.\n1. Mathematical judgements are always synthetical. Hitherto this fact,\nthough incontestably true and very important in its consequences, seems\nto have escaped the analysts of the human mind, nay, to be in complete\nopposition to all their conjectures. For as it was found that\nmathematical conclusions all proceed according to the principle of\ncontradiction (which the nature of every apodeictic certainty\nrequires), people became persuaded that the fundamental principles of\nthe science also were recognized and admitted in the same way. But the\nnotion is fallacious; for although a synthetical proposition can\ncertainly be discerned by means of the principle of contradiction, this\nis possible only when another synthetical proposition precedes, from\nwhich the latter is deduced, but never of itself.\nBefore all, be it observed, that proper mathematical propositions are\nalways judgements \u00e0 priori, and not empirical, because they carry along\nwith them the conception of necessity, which cannot be given by\nexperience. If this be demurred to, it matters not; I will then limit\nmy assertion to pure mathematics, the very conception of which implies\nthat it consists of knowledge altogether non-empirical and \u00e0 priori.\nWe might, indeed at first suppose that the proposition 7 + 5 = 12 is a\nmerely analytical proposition, following (according to the principle of\ncontradiction) from the conception of a sum of seven and five. But if\nwe regard it more narrowly, we find that our conception of the sum of\nseven and five contains nothing more than the uniting of both sums into\none, whereby it cannot at all be cogitated what this single number is\nwhich embraces both. The conception of twelve is by no means obtained\nby merely cogitating the union of seven and five; and we may analyse\nour conception of such a possible sum as long as we will, still we\nshall never discover in it the notion of twelve. We must go beyond\nthese conceptions, and have recourse to an intuition which corresponds\nto one of the two\u2014our five fingers, for example, or like Segner in his\nArithmetic five points, and so by degrees, add the units contained in\nthe five given in the intuition, to the conception of seven. For I\nfirst take the number 7, and, for the conception of 5 calling in the\naid of the fingers of my hand as objects of intuition, I add the units,\nwhich I before took together to make up the number 5, gradually now by\nmeans of the material image my hand, to the number 7, and by this\nprocess, I at length see the number 12 arise. That 7 should be added to\n5, I have certainly cogitated in my conception of a sum = 7 + 5, but\nnot that this sum was equal to 12. Arithmetical propositions are\ntherefore always synthetical, of which we may become more clearly\nconvinced by trying large numbers. For it will thus become quite\nevident that, turn and twist our conceptions as we may, it is\nimpossible, without having recourse to intuition, to arrive at the sum\ntotal or product by means of the mere analysis of our conceptions. Just\nas little is any principle of pure geometry analytical. \u201cA straight\nline between two points is the shortest,\u201d is a synthetical proposition.\nFor my conception of straight contains no notion of quantity, but is\nmerely qualitative. The conception of the shortest is therefore fore\nwholly an addition, and by no analysis can it be extracted from our\nconception of a straight line. Intuition must therefore here lend its\naid, by means of which, and thus only, our synthesis is possible.\nSome few principles preposited by geometricians are, indeed, really\nanalytical, and depend on the principle of contradiction. They serve,\nhowever, like identical propositions, as links in the chain of method,\nnot as principles\u2014for example, a = a, the whole is equal to itself, or\n(a+b) \u2014> a, the whole is greater than its part. And yet even these\nprinciples themselves, though they derive their validity from pure\nconceptions, are only admitted in mathematics because they can be\npresented in intuition. What causes us here commonly to believe that\nthe predicate of such apodeictic judgements is already contained in our\nconception, and that the judgement is therefore analytical, is merely\nthe equivocal nature of the expression. We must join in thought a\ncertain predicate to a given conception, and this necessity cleaves\nalready to the conception. But the question is, not what we must join\nin thought to the given conception, but what we really think therein,\nthough only obscurely, and then it becomes manifest that the predicate\npertains to these conceptions, necessarily indeed, yet not as thought\nin the conception itself, but by virtue of an intuition, which must be\nadded to the conception.\n2. The science of natural philosophy (physics) contains in itself\nsynthetical judgements \u00e0 priori, as principles. I shall adduce two\npropositions. For instance, the proposition, \u201cIn all changes of the\nmaterial world, the quantity of matter remains unchanged\u201d; or, that,\n\u201cIn all communication of motion, action and reaction must always be\nequal.\u201d In both of these, not only is the necessity, and therefore\ntheir origin \u00e0 priori clear, but also that they are synthetical\npropositions. For in the conception of matter, I do not cogitate its\npermanency, but merely its presence in space, which it fills. I\ntherefore really go out of and beyond the conception of matter, in\norder to think on to it something \u00e0 priori, which I did not think in\nit. The proposition is therefore not analytical, but synthetical, and\nnevertheless conceived \u00e0 priori; and so it is with regard to the other\npropositions of the pure part of natural philosophy.\n3. As to metaphysics, even if we look upon it merely as an attempted\nscience, yet, from the nature of human reason, an indispensable one, we\nfind that it must contain synthetical propositions \u00e0 priori. It is not\nmerely the duty of metaphysics to dissect, and thereby analytically to\nillustrate the conceptions which we form \u00e0 priori of things; but we\nseek to widen the range of our \u00e0 priori knowledge. For this purpose, we\nmust avail ourselves of such principles as add something to the\noriginal conception\u2014something not identical with, nor contained in it,\nand by means of synthetical judgements \u00e0 priori, leave far behind us\nthe limits of experience; for example, in the proposition, \u201cthe world\nmust have a beginning,\u201d and such like. Thus metaphysics, according to\nthe proper aim of the science, consists merely of synthetical\npropositions \u00e0 priori.\nVI. The Universal Problem of Pure Reason.\nIt is extremely advantageous to be able to bring a number of\ninvestigations under the formula of a single problem. For in this\nmanner, we not only facilitate our own labour, inasmuch as we define it\nclearly to ourselves, but also render it more easy for others to decide\nwhether we have done justice to our undertaking. The proper problem of\npure reason, then, is contained in the question: \u201cHow are synthetical\njudgements \u00e0 priori possible?\u201d\nThat metaphysical science has hitherto remained in so vacillating a\nstate of uncertainty and contradiction, is only to be attributed to the\nfact that this great problem, and perhaps even the difference between\nanalytical and synthetical judgements, did not sooner suggest itself to\nphilosophers. Upon the solution of this problem, or upon sufficient\nproof of the impossibility of synthetical knowledge \u00e0 priori, depends\nthe existence or downfall of the science of metaphysics. Among\nphilosophers, David Hume came the nearest of all to this problem; yet\nit never acquired in his mind sufficient precision, nor did he regard\nthe question in its universality. On the contrary, he stopped short at\nthe synthetical proposition of the connection of an effect with its\ncause (principium causalitatis), insisting that such proposition \u00e0\npriori was impossible. According to his conclusions, then, all that we\nterm metaphysical science is a mere delusion, arising from the fancied\ninsight of reason into that which is in truth borrowed from experience,\nand to which habit has given the appearance of necessity. Against this\nassertion, destructive to all pure philosophy, he would have been\nguarded, had he had our problem before his eyes in its universality.\nFor he would then have perceived that, according to his own argument,\nthere likewise could not be any pure mathematical science, which\nassuredly cannot exist without synthetical propositions \u00e0 priori\u2014an\nabsurdity from which his good understanding must have saved him.\nIn the solution of the above problem is at the same time comprehended\nthe possibility of the use of pure reason in the foundation and\nconstruction of all sciences which contain theoretical knowledge \u00e0\npriori of objects, that is to say, the answer to the following\nquestions:\nHow is pure mathematical science possible?\nHow is pure natural science possible?\nRespecting these sciences, as they do certainly exist, it may with\npropriety be asked, how they are possible?\u2014for that they must be\npossible is shown by the fact of their really existing.[9] But as to\nmetaphysics, the miserable progress it has hitherto made, and the fact\nthat of no one system yet brought forward, far as regards its true aim,\ncan it be said that this science really exists, leaves any one at\nliberty to doubt with reason the very possibility of its existence.\n[9] As to the existence of pure natural science, or physics, perhaps\nmany may still express doubts. But we have only to look at the\ndifferent propositions which are commonly treated of at the\ncommencement of proper (empirical) physical science\u2014those, for\nexample, relating to the permanence of the same quantity of matter,\nthe vis inertiae, the equality of action and reaction, etc.\u2014to be soon\nconvinced that they form a science of pure physics (physica pura, or\nrationalis), which well deserves to be separately exposed as a special\nscience, in its whole extent, whether that be great or confined.\nYet, in a certain sense, this kind of knowledge must unquestionably be\nlooked upon as given; in other words, metaphysics must be considered as\nreally existing, if not as a science, nevertheless as a natural\ndisposition of the human mind (metaphysica naturalis). For human\nreason, without any instigations imputable to the mere vanity of great\nknowledge, unceasingly progresses, urged on by its own feeling of need,\ntowards such questions as cannot be answered by any empirical\napplication of reason, or principles derived therefrom; and so there\nhas ever really existed in every man some system of metaphysics. It\nwill always exist, so soon as reason awakes to the exercise of its\npower of speculation. And now the question arises: \u201cHow is metaphysics,\nas a natural disposition, possible?\u201d In other words, how, from the\nnature of universal human reason, do those questions arise which pure\nreason proposes to itself, and which it is impelled by its own feeling\nof need to answer as well as it can?\nBut as in all the attempts hitherto made to answer the questions which\nreason is prompted by its very nature to propose to itself, for\nexample, whether the world had a beginning, or has existed from\neternity, it has always met with unavoidable contradictions, we must\nnot rest satisfied with the mere natural disposition of the mind to\nmetaphysics, that is, with the existence of the faculty of pure reason,\nwhence, indeed, some sort of metaphysical system always arises; but it\nmust be possible to arrive at certainty in regard to the question\nwhether we know or do not know the things of which metaphysics treats.\nWe must be able to arrive at a decision on the subjects of its\nquestions, or on the ability or inability of reason to form any\njudgement respecting them; and therefore either to extend with\nconfidence the bounds of our pure reason, or to set strictly defined\nand safe limits to its action. This last question, which arises out of\nthe above universal problem, would properly run thus: \u201cHow is\nmetaphysics possible as a science?\u201d\nThus, the critique of reason leads at last, naturally and necessarily,\nto science; and, on the other hand, the dogmatical use of reason\nwithout criticism leads to groundless assertions, against which others\nequally specious can always be set, thus ending unavoidably in\nscepticism.\nBesides, this science cannot be of great and formidable prolixity,\nbecause it has not to do with objects of reason, the variety of which\nis inexhaustible, but merely with Reason herself and her problems;\nproblems which arise out of her own bosom, and are not proposed to her\nby the nature of outward things, but by her own nature. And when once\nReason has previously become able completely to understand her own\npower in regard to objects which she meets with in experience, it will\nbe easy to determine securely the extent and limits of her attempted\napplication to objects beyond the confines of experience.\nWe may and must, therefore, regard the attempts hitherto made to\nestablish metaphysical science dogmatically as non-existent. For what\nof analysis, that is, mere dissection of conceptions, is contained in\none or other, is not the aim of, but only a preparation for metaphysics\nproper, which has for its object the extension, by means of synthesis,\nof our \u00e0 priori knowledge. And for this purpose, mere analysis is of\ncourse useless, because it only shows what is contained in these\nconceptions, but not how we arrive, \u00e0 priori, at them; and this it is\nher duty to show, in order to be able afterwards to determine their\nvalid use in regard to all objects of experience, to all knowledge in\ngeneral. But little self-denial, indeed, is needed to give up these\npretensions, seeing the undeniable, and in the dogmatic mode of\nprocedure, inevitable contradictions of Reason with herself, have long\nsince ruined the reputation of every system of metaphysics that has\nappeared up to this time. It will require more firmness to remain\nundeterred by difficulty from within, and opposition from without, from\nendeavouring, by a method quite opposed to all those hitherto followed,\nto further the growth and fruitfulness of a science indispensable to\nhuman reason\u2014a science from which every branch it has borne may be cut\naway, but whose roots remain indestructible.\nVII. Idea and Division of a Particular Science, under the Name of a\nCritique of Pure Reason.\nFrom all that has been said, there results the idea of a particular\nscience, which may be called the Critique of Pure Reason. For reason is\nthe faculty which furnishes us with the principles of knowledge \u00e0\npriori. Hence, pure reason is the faculty which contains the principles\nof cognizing anything absolutely \u00e0 priori. An organon of pure reason\nwould be a compendium of those principles according to which alone all\npure cognitions \u00e0 priori can be obtained. The completely extended\napplication of such an organon would afford us a system of pure reason.\nAs this, however, is demanding a great deal, and it is yet doubtful\nwhether any extension of our knowledge be here possible, or, if so, in\nwhat cases; we can regard a science of the mere criticism of pure\nreason, its sources and limits, as the prop\u00e6deutic to a system of pure\nreason. Such a science must not be called a doctrine, but only a\ncritique of pure reason; and its use, in regard to speculation, would\nbe only negative, not to enlarge the bounds of, but to purify, our\nreason, and to shield it against error\u2014which alone is no little gain. I\napply the term transcendental to all knowledge which is not so much\noccupied with objects as with the mode of our cognition of these\nobjects, so far as this mode of cognition is possible \u00e0 priori. A\nsystem of such conceptions would be called transcendental philosophy.\nBut this, again, is still beyond the bounds of our present essay. For\nas such a science must contain a complete exposition not only of our\nsynthetical \u00e0 priori, but of our analytical \u00e0 priori knowledge, it is\nof too wide a range for our present purpose, because we do not require\nto carry our analysis any farther than is necessary to understand, in\ntheir full extent, the principles of synthesis \u00e0 priori, with which\nalone we have to do. This investigation, which we cannot properly call\na doctrine, but only a transcendental critique, because it aims not at\nthe enlargement, but at the correction and guidance, of our knowledge,\nand is to serve as a touchstone of the worth or worthlessness of all\nknowledge \u00e0 priori, is the sole object of our present essay. Such a\ncritique is consequently, as far as possible, a preparation for an\norganon; and if this new organon should be found to fail, at least for\na canon of pure reason, according to which the complete system of the\nphilosophy of pure reason, whether it extend or limit the bounds of\nthat reason, might one day be set forth both analytically and\nsynthetically. For that this is possible, nay, that such a system is\nnot of so great extent as to preclude the hope of its ever being\ncompleted, is evident. For we have not here to do with the nature of\noutward objects, which is infinite, but solely with the mind, which\njudges of the nature of objects, and, again, with the mind only in\nrespect of its cognition \u00e0 priori. And the object of our\ninvestigations, as it is not to be sought without, but, altogether\nwithin, ourselves, cannot remain concealed, and in all probability is\nlimited enough to be completely surveyed and fairly estimated,\naccording to its worth or worthlessness. Still less let the reader here\nexpect a critique of books and systems of pure reason; our present\nobject is exclusively a critique of the faculty of pure reason itself.\nOnly when we make this critique our foundation, do we possess a pure\ntouchstone for estimating the philosophical value of ancient and modern\nwritings on this subject; and without this criterion, the incompetent\nhistorian or judge decides upon and corrects the groundless assertions\nof others with his own, which have themselves just as little\nfoundation.\nTranscendental philosophy is the idea of a science, for which the\nCritique of Pure Reason must sketch the whole plan architectonically,\nthat is, from principles, with a full guarantee for the validity and\nstability of all the parts which enter into the building. It is the\nsystem of all the principles of pure reason. If this Critique itself\ndoes not assume the title of transcendental philosophy, it is only\nbecause, to be a complete system, it ought to contain a full analysis\nof all human knowledge \u00e0 priori. Our critique must, indeed, lay before\nus a complete enumeration of all the radical conceptions which\nconstitute the said pure knowledge. But from the complete analysis of\nthese conceptions themselves, as also from a complete investigation of\nthose derived from them, it abstains with reason; partly because it\nwould be deviating from the end in view to occupy itself with this\nanalysis, since this process is not attended with the difficulty and\ninsecurity to be found in the synthesis, to which our critique is\nentirely devoted, and partly because it would be inconsistent with the\nunity of our plan to burden this essay with the vindication of the\ncompleteness of such an analysis and deduction, with which, after all,\nwe have at present nothing to do. This completeness of the analysis of\nthese radical conceptions, as well as of the deduction from the\nconceptions \u00e0 priori which may be given by the analysis, we can,\nhowever, easily attain, provided only that we are in possession of all\nthese radical conceptions, which are to serve as principles of the\nsynthesis, and that in respect of this main purpose nothing is wanting.\nTo the Critique of Pure Reason, therefore, belongs all that constitutes\ntranscendental philosophy; and it is the complete idea of\ntranscendental philosophy, but still not the science itself; because it\nonly proceeds so far with the analysis as is necessary to the power of\njudging completely of our synthetical knowledge \u00e0 priori.\nThe principal thing we must attend to, in the division of the parts of\na science like this, is that no conceptions must enter it which contain\naught empirical; in other words, that the knowledge \u00e0 priori must be\ncompletely pure. Hence, although the highest principles and fundamental\nconceptions of morality are certainly cognitions \u00e0 priori, yet they do\nnot belong to transcendental philosophy; because, though they certainly\ndo not lay the conceptions of pain, pleasure, desires, inclinations,\netc. (which are all of empirical origin), at the foundation of its\nprecepts, yet still into the conception of duty\u2014as an obstacle to be\novercome, or as an incitement which should not be made into a\nmotive\u2014these empirical conceptions must necessarily enter, in the\nconstruction of a system of pure morality. Transcendental philosophy is\nconsequently a philosophy of the pure and merely speculative reason.\nFor all that is practical, so far as it contains motives, relates to\nfeelings, and these belong to empirical sources of cognition.\nIf we wish to divide this science from the universal point of view of a\nscience in general, it ought to comprehend, first, a Doctrine of the\nElements, and, secondly, a Doctrine of the Method of pure reason. Each\nof these main divisions will have its subdivisions, the separate\nreasons for which we cannot here particularize. Only so much seems\nnecessary, by way of introduction of premonition, that there are two\nsources of human knowledge (which probably spring from a common, but to\nus unknown root), namely, sense and understanding. By the former,\nobjects are given to us; by the latter, thought. So far as the faculty\nof sense may contain representations \u00e0 priori, which form the\nconditions under which objects are given, in so far it belongs to\ntranscendental philosophy. The transcendental doctrine of sense must\nform the first part of our science of elements, because the conditions\nunder which alone the objects of human knowledge are given must precede\nthose under which they are thought.\nI. TRANSCENDENTAL DOCTRINE OF ELEMENTS.\nFIRST PART. TRANSCENDENTAL \u00c6STHETIC.\n\u00a7 I. Introductory.\nIn whatsoever mode, or by whatsoever means, our knowledge may relate to\nobjects, it is at least quite clear that the only manner in which it\nimmediately relates to them is by means of an intuition. To this as the\nindispensable groundwork, all thought points. But an intuition can take\nplace only in so far as the object is given to us. This, again, is only\npossible, to man at least, on condition that the object affect the mind\nin a certain manner. The capacity for receiving representations\n(receptivity) through the mode in which we are affected by objects,\nobjects, is called sensibility. By means of sensibility, therefore,\nobjects are given to us, and it alone furnishes us with intuitions; by\nthe understanding they are thought, and from it arise conceptions. But\nan thought must directly, or indirectly, by means of certain signs,\nrelate ultimately to intuitions; consequently, with us, to sensibility,\nbecause in no other way can an object be given to us.\nThe effect of an object upon the faculty of representation, so far as\nwe are affected by the said object, is sensation. That sort of\nintuition which relates to an object by means of sensation is called an\nempirical intuition. The undetermined object of an empirical intuition\nis called phenomenon. That which in the phenomenon corresponds to the\nsensation, I term its matter; but that which effects that the content\nof the phenomenon can be arranged under certain relations, I call its\nform. But that in which our sensations are merely arranged, and by\nwhich they are susceptible of assuming a certain form, cannot be itself\nsensation. It is, then, the matter of all phenomena that is given to us\n\u00e0 posteriori; the form must lie ready \u00e0 priori for them in the mind,\nand consequently can be regarded separately from all sensation.\nI call all representations pure, in the transcendental meaning of the\nword, wherein nothing is met with that belongs to sensation. And\naccordingly we find existing in the mind \u00e0 priori, the pure form of\nsensuous intuitions in general, in which all the manifold content of\nthe phenomenal world is arranged and viewed under certain relations.\nThis pure form of sensibility I shall call pure intuition. Thus, if I\ntake away from our representation of a body all that the understanding\nthinks as belonging to it, as substance, force, divisibility, etc., and\nalso whatever belongs to sensation, as impenetrability, hardness,\ncolour, etc.; yet there is still something left us from this empirical\nintuition, namely, extension and shape. These belong to pure intuition,\nwhich exists \u00e0 priori in the mind, as a mere form of sensibility, and\nwithout any real object of the senses or any sensation.\nThe science of all the principles of sensibility \u00e0 priori, I call\ntranscendental \u00e6sthetic.[10] There must, then, be such a science\nforming the first part of the transcendental doctrine of elements, in\ncontradistinction to that part which contains the principles of pure\nthought, and which is called transcendental logic.\n[10] The Germans are the only people who at present use this word to\nindicate what others call the critique of taste. At the foundation of\nthis term lies the disappointed hope, which the eminent analyst,\nBaumgarten, conceived, of subjecting the criticism of the beautiful to\nprinciples of reason, and so of elevating its rules into a science.\nBut his endeavours were vain. For the said rules or criteria are, in\nrespect to their chief sources, merely empirical, consequently never\ncan serve as determinate laws \u00e0 priori, by which our judgement in\nmatters of taste is to be directed. It is rather our judgement which\nforms the proper test as to the correctness of the principles. On this\naccount it is advisable to give up the use of the term as designating\nthe critique of taste, and to apply it solely to that doctrine, which\nis true science\u2014the science of the laws of sensibility\u2014and thus come\nnearer to the language and the sense of the ancients in their\nwell-known division of the objects of cognition into aiotheta kai\nnoeta, or to share it with speculative philosophy, and employ it\npartly in a transcendental, partly in a psychological signification.\nIn the science of transcendental \u00e6sthetic accordingly, we shall first\nisolate sensibility or the sensuous faculty, by separating from it all\nthat is annexed to its perceptions by the conceptions of understanding,\nso that nothing be left but empirical intuition. In the next place we\nshall take away from this intuition all that belongs to sensation, so\nthat nothing may remain but pure intuition, and the mere form of\nphenomena, which is all that the sensibility can afford \u00e0 priori. From\nthis investigation it will be found that there are two pure forms of\nsensuous intuition, as principles of knowledge \u00e0 priori, namely, space\nand time. To the consideration of these we shall now proceed.\nSECTION I. Of Space.\n\u00a7 2. Metaphysical Exposition of this Conception.\nBy means of the external sense (a property of the mind), we represent\nto ourselves objects as without us, and these all in space. Herein\nalone are their shape, dimensions, and relations to each other\ndetermined or determinable. The internal sense, by means of which the\nmind contemplates itself or its internal state, gives, indeed, no\nintuition of the soul as an object; yet there is nevertheless a\ndeterminate form, under which alone the contemplation of our internal\nstate is possible, so that all which relates to the inward\ndeterminations of the mind is represented in relations of time. Of time\nwe cannot have any external intuition, any more than we can have an\ninternal intuition of space. What then are time and space? Are they\nreal existences? Or, are they merely relations or determinations of\nthings, such, however, as would equally belong to these things in\nthemselves, though they should never become objects of intuition; or,\nare they such as belong only to the form of intuition, and consequently\nto the subjective constitution of the mind, without which these\npredicates of time and space could not be attached to any object? In\norder to become informed on these points, we shall first give an\nexposition of the conception of space. By exposition, I mean the clear,\nthough not detailed, representation of that which belongs to a\nconception; and an exposition is metaphysical when it contains that\nwhich represents the conception as given \u00e0 priori.\n1. Space is not a conception which has been derived from outward\nexperiences. For, in order that certain sensations may relate to\nsomething without me (that is, to something which occupies a different\npart of space from that in which I am); in like manner, in order that I\nmay represent them not merely as without, of, and near to each other,\nbut also in separate places, the representation of space must already\nexist as a foundation. Consequently, the representation of space cannot\nbe borrowed from the relations of external phenomena through\nexperience; but, on the contrary, this external experience is itself\nonly possible through the said antecedent representation.\n2. Space then is a necessary representation \u00e0 priori, which serves for\nthe foundation of all external intuitions. We never can imagine or make\na representation to ourselves of the non-existence of space, though we\nmay easily enough think that no objects are found in it. It must,\ntherefore, be considered as the condition of the possibility of\nphenomena, and by no means as a determination dependent on them, and is\na representation \u00e0 priori, which necessarily supplies the basis for\nexternal phenomena.\n3. Space is no discursive, or as we say, general conception of the\nrelations of things, but a pure intuition. For, in the first place, we\ncan only represent to ourselves one space, and, when we talk of divers\nspaces, we mean only parts of one and the same space. Moreover, these\nparts cannot antecede this one all-embracing space, as the component\nparts from which the aggregate can be made up, but can be cogitated\nonly as existing in it. Space is essentially one, and multiplicity in\nit, consequently the general notion of spaces, of this or that space,\ndepends solely upon limitations. Hence it follows that an \u00e0 priori\nintuition (which is not empirical) lies at the root of all our\nconceptions of space. Thus, moreover, the principles of geometry\u2014for\nexample, that \u201cin a triangle, two sides together are greater than the\nthird,\u201d are never deduced from general conceptions of line and\ntriangle, but from intuition, and this \u00e0 priori, with apodeictic\ncertainty.\n4. Space is represented as an infinite given quantity. Now every\nconception must indeed be considered as a representation which is\ncontained in an infinite multitude of different possible\nrepresentations, which, therefore, comprises these under itself; but no\nconception, as such, can be so conceived, as if it contained within\nitself an infinite multitude of representations. Nevertheless, space is\nso conceived of, for all parts of space are equally capable of being\nproduced to infinity. Consequently, the original representation of\nspace is an intuition \u00e0 priori, and not a conception.\n\u00a7 3. Transcendental Exposition of the Conception of Space.\nBy a transcendental exposition, I mean the explanation of a conception,\nas a principle, whence can be discerned the possibility of other\nsynthetical \u00e0 priori cognitions. For this purpose, it is requisite,\nfirstly, that such cognitions do really flow from the given conception;\nand, secondly, that the said cognitions are only possible under the\npresupposition of a given mode of explaining this conception.\nGeometry is a science which determines the properties of space\nsynthetically, and yet \u00e0 priori. What, then, must be our representation\nof space, in order that such a cognition of it may be possible? It must\nbe originally intuition, for from a mere conception, no propositions\ncan be deduced which go out beyond the conception, and yet this happens\nin geometry. (Introd. V.) But this intuition must be found in the mind\n\u00e0 priori, that is, before any perception of objects, consequently must\nbe pure, not empirical, intuition. For geometrical principles are\nalways apodeictic, that is, united with the consciousness of their\nnecessity, as: \u201cSpace has only three dimensions.\u201d But propositions of\nthis kind cannot be empirical judgements, nor conclusions from them.\n(Introd. II.) Now, how can an external intuition anterior to objects\nthemselves, and in which our conception of objects can be determined \u00e0\npriori, exist in the human mind? Obviously not otherwise than in so far\nas it has its seat in the subject only, as the formal capacity of the\nsubject\u2019s being affected by objects, and thereby of obtaining immediate\nrepresentation, that is, intuition; consequently, only as the form of\nthe external sense in general.\nThus it is only by means of our explanation that the possibility of\ngeometry, as a synthetical science \u00e0 priori, becomes comprehensible.\nEvery mode of explanation which does not show us this possibility,\nalthough in appearance it may be similar to ours, can with the utmost\ncertainty be distinguished from it by these marks.\n\u00a7 4. Conclusions from the foregoing Conceptions.\n(a) Space does not represent any property of objects as things in\nthemselves, nor does it represent them in their relations to each\nother; in other words, space does not represent to us any determination\nof objects such as attaches to the objects themselves, and would\nremain, even though all subjective conditions of the intuition were\nabstracted. For neither absolute nor relative determinations of objects\ncan be intuited prior to the existence of the things to which they\nbelong, and therefore not \u00e0 priori.\n(b) Space is nothing else than the form of all phenomena of the\nexternal sense, that is, the subjective condition of the sensibility,\nunder which alone external intuition is possible. Now, because the\nreceptivity or capacity of the subject to be affected by objects\nnecessarily antecedes all intuitions of these objects, it is easily\nunderstood how the form of all phenomena can be given in the mind\nprevious to all actual perceptions, therefore \u00e0 priori, and how it, as\na pure intuition, in which all objects must be determined, can contain\nprinciples of the relations of these objects prior to all experience.\nIt is therefore from the human point of view only that we can speak of\nspace, extended objects, etc. If we depart from the subjective\ncondition, under which alone we can obtain external intuition, or, in\nother words, by means of which we are affected by objects, the\nrepresentation of space has no meaning whatsoever. This predicate is\nonly applicable to things in so far as they appear to us, that is, are\nobjects of sensibility. The constant form of this receptivity, which we\ncall sensibility, is a necessary condition of all relations in which\nobjects can be intuited as existing without us, and when abstraction of\nthese objects is made, is a pure intuition, to which we give the name\nof space. It is clear that we cannot make the special conditions of\nsensibility into conditions of the possibility of things, but only of\nthe possibility of their existence as far as they are phenomena. And so\nwe may correctly say that space contains all which can appear to us\nexternally, but not all things considered as things in themselves, be\nthey intuited or not, or by whatsoever subject one will. As to the\nintuitions of other thinking beings, we cannot judge whether they are\nor are not bound by the same conditions which limit our own intuition,\nand which for us are universally valid. If we join the limitation of a\njudgement to the conception of the subject, then the judgement will\npossess unconditioned validity. For example, the proposition, \u201cAll\nobjects are beside each other in space,\u201d is valid only under the\nlimitation that these things are taken as objects of our sensuous\nintuition. But if I join the condition to the conception and say, \u201cAll\nthings, as external phenomena, are beside each other in space,\u201d then\nthe rule is valid universally, and without any limitation. Our\nexpositions, consequently, teach the reality (i.e., the objective\nvalidity) of space in regard of all which can be presented to us\nexternally as object, and at the same time also the ideality of space\nin regard to objects when they are considered by means of reason as\nthings in themselves, that is, without reference to the constitution of\nour sensibility. We maintain, therefore, the empirical reality of space\nin regard to all possible external experience, although we must admit\nits transcendental ideality; in other words, that it is nothing, so\nsoon as we withdraw the condition upon which the possibility of all\nexperience depends and look upon space as something that belongs to\nthings in themselves.\nBut, with the exception of space, there is no representation,\nsubjective and referring to something external to us, which could be\ncalled objective \u00e0 priori. For there are no other subjective\nrepresentations from which we can deduce synthetical propositions \u00e0\npriori, as we can from the intuition of space. (See \u00a7 3.) Therefore, to\nspeak accurately, no ideality whatever belongs to these, although they\nagree in this respect with the representation of space, that they\nbelong merely to the subjective nature of the mode of sensuous\nperception; such a mode, for example, as that of sight, of hearing, and\nof feeling, by means of the sensations of colour, sound, and heat, but\nwhich, because they are only sensations and not intuitions, do not of\nthemselves give us the cognition of any object, least of all, an \u00e0\npriori cognition. My purpose, in the above remark, is merely this: to\nguard any one against illustrating the asserted ideality of space by\nexamples quite insufficient, for example, by colour, taste, etc.; for\nthese must be contemplated not as properties of things, but only as\nchanges in the subject, changes which may be different in different\nmen. For, in such a case, that which is originally a mere phenomenon, a\nrose, for example, is taken by the empirical understanding for a thing\nin itself, though to every different eye, in respect of its colour, it\nmay appear different. On the contrary, the transcendental conception of\nphenomena in space is a critical admonition, that, in general, nothing\nwhich is intuited in space is a thing in itself, and that space is not\na form which belongs as a property to things; but that objects are\nquite unknown to us in themselves, and what we call outward objects,\nare nothing else but mere representations of our sensibility, whose\nform is space, but whose real correlate, the thing in itself, is not\nknown by means of these representations, nor ever can be, but\nrespecting which, in experience, no inquiry is ever made.\nSECTION II. Of Time.\n\u00a7 5. Metaphysical Exposition of this Conception.\n1. Time is not an empirical conception. For neither coexistence nor\nsuccession would be perceived by us, if the representation of time did\nnot exist as a foundation \u00e0 priori. Without this presupposition we\ncould not represent to ourselves that things exist together at one and\nthe same time, or at different times, that is, contemporaneously, or in\nsuccession.\n2. Time is a necessary representation, lying at the foundation of all\nour intuitions. With regard to phenomena in general, we cannot think\naway time from them, and represent them to ourselves as out of and\nunconnected with time, but we can quite well represent to ourselves\ntime void of phenomena. Time is therefore given \u00e0 priori. In it alone\nis all reality of phenomena possible. These may all be annihilated in\nthought, but time itself, as the universal condition of their\npossibility, cannot be so annulled.\n3. On this necessity \u00e0 priori is also founded the possibility of\napodeictic principles of the relations of time, or axioms of time in\ngeneral, such as: \u201cTime has only one dimension,\u201d \u201cDifferent times are\nnot coexistent but successive\u201d (as different spaces are not successive\nbut coexistent). These principles cannot be derived from experience,\nfor it would give neither strict universality, nor apodeictic\ncertainty. We should only be able to say, \u201cso common experience teaches\nus,\u201d but not \u201cit must be so.\u201d They are valid as rules, through which,\nin general, experience is possible; and they instruct us respecting\nexperience, and not by means of it.\n4. Time is not a discursive, or as it is called, general conception,\nbut a pure form of the sensuous intuition. Different times are merely\nparts of one and the same time. But the representation which can only\nbe given by a single object is an intuition. Besides, the proposition\nthat different times cannot be coexistent could not be derived from a\ngeneral conception. For this proposition is synthetical, and therefore\ncannot spring out of conceptions alone. It is therefore contained\nimmediately in the intuition and representation of time.\n5. The infinity of time signifies nothing more than that every\ndetermined quantity of time is possible only through limitations of one\ntime lying at the foundation. Consequently, the original\nrepresentation, time, must be given as unlimited. But as the\ndeterminate representation of the parts of time and of every quantity\nof an object can only be obtained by limitation, the complete\nrepresentation of time must not be furnished by means of conceptions,\nfor these contain only partial representations. Conceptions, on the\ncontrary, must have immediate intuition for their basis.\n\u00a7 6 Transcendental Exposition of the Conception of Time.\nI may here refer to what is said above (\u00a7 5, 3), where, for or sake of\nbrevity, I have placed under the head of metaphysical exposition, that\nwhich is properly transcendental. Here I shall add that the conception\nof change, and with it the conception of motion, as change of place, is\npossible only through and in the representation of time; that if this\nrepresentation were not an intuition (internal) \u00e0 priori, no\nconception, of whatever kind, could render comprehensible the\npossibility of change, in other words, of a conjunction of\ncontradictorily opposed predicates in one and the same object, for\nexample, the presence of a thing in a place and the non-presence of the\nsame thing in the same place. It is only in time that it is possible to\nmeet with two contradictorily opposed determinations in one thing, that\nis, after each other. Thus our conception of time explains the\npossibility of so much synthetical knowledge \u00e0 priori, as is exhibited\nin the general doctrine of motion, which is not a little fruitful.\n\u00a7 7. Conclusions from the above Conceptions.\n(a) Time is not something which subsists of itself, or which inheres in\nthings as an objective determination, and therefore remains, when\nabstraction is made of the subjective conditions of the intuition of\nthings. For in the former case, it would be something real, yet without\npresenting to any power of perception any real object. In the latter\ncase, as an order or determination inherent in things themselves, it\ncould not be antecedent to things, as their condition, nor discerned or\nintuited by means of synthetical propositions \u00e0 priori. But all this is\nquite possible when we regard time as merely the subjective condition\nunder which all our intuitions take place. For in that case, this form\nof the inward intuition can be represented prior to the objects, and\nconsequently \u00e0 priori.\n(b) Time is nothing else than the form of the internal sense, that is,\nof the intuitions of self and of our internal state. For time cannot be\nany determination of outward phenomena. It has to do neither with shape\nnor position; on the contrary, it determines the relation of\nrepresentations in our internal state. And precisely because this\ninternal intuition presents to us no shape or form, we endeavour to\nsupply this want by analogies, and represent the course of time by a\nline progressing to infinity, the content of which constitutes a series\nwhich is only of one dimension; and we conclude from the properties of\nthis line as to all the properties of time, with this single exception,\nthat the parts of the line are coexistent, whilst those of time are\nsuccessive. From this it is clear also that the representation of time\nis itself an intuition, because all its relations can be expressed in\nan external intuition.\n(c) Time is the formal condition \u00e0 priori of all phenomena whatsoever.\nSpace, as the pure form of external intuition, is limited as a\ncondition \u00e0 priori to external phenomena alone. On the other hand,\nbecause all representations, whether they have or have not external\nthings for their objects, still in themselves, as determinations of the\nmind, belong to our internal state; and because this internal state is\nsubject to the formal condition of the internal intuition, that is, to\ntime\u2014time is a condition \u00e0 priori of all phenomena whatsoever\u2014the\nimmediate condition of all internal, and thereby the mediate condition\nof all external phenomena. If I can say \u00e0 priori, \u201cAll outward\nphenomena are in space, and determined \u00e0 priori according to the\nrelations of space,\u201d I can also, from the principle of the internal\nsense, affirm universally, \u201cAll phenomena in general, that is, all\nobjects of the senses, are in time and stand necessarily in relations\nof time.\u201d\nIf we abstract our internal intuition of ourselves and all external\nintuitions, possible only by virtue of this internal intuition and\npresented to us by our faculty of representation, and consequently take\nobjects as they are in themselves, then time is nothing. It is only of\nobjective validity in regard to phenomena, because these are things\nwhich we regard as objects of our senses. It no longer objective we,\nmake abstraction of the sensuousness of our intuition, in other words,\nof that mode of representation which is peculiar to us, and speak of\nthings in general. Time is therefore merely a subjective condition of\nour (human) intuition (which is always sensuous, that is, so far as we\nare affected by objects), and in itself, independently of the mind or\nsubject, is nothing. Nevertheless, in respect of all phenomena,\nconsequently of all things which come within the sphere of our\nexperience, it is necessarily objective. We cannot say, \u201cAll things are\nin time,\u201d because in this conception of things in general, we abstract\nand make no mention of any sort of intuition of things. But this is the\nproper condition under which time belongs to our representation of\nobjects. If we add the condition to the conception, and say, \u201cAll\nthings, as phenomena, that is, objects of sensuous intuition, are in\ntime,\u201d then the proposition has its sound objective validity and\nuniversality \u00e0 priori.\nWhat we have now set forth teaches, therefore, the empirical reality of\ntime; that is, its objective validity in reference to all objects which\ncan ever be presented to our senses. And as our intuition is always\nsensuous, no object ever can be presented to us in experience, which\ndoes not come under the conditions of time. On the other hand, we deny\nto time all claim to absolute reality; that is, we deny that it,\nwithout having regard to the form of our sensuous intuition, absolutely\ninheres in things as a condition or property. Such properties as belong\nto objects as things in themselves never can be presented to us through\nthe medium of the senses. Herein consists, therefore, the\ntranscendental ideality of time, according to which, if we abstract the\nsubjective conditions of sensuous intuition, it is nothing, and cannot\nbe reckoned as subsisting or inhering in objects as things in\nthemselves, independently of its relation to our intuition. This\nideality, like that of space, is not to be proved or illustrated by\nfallacious analogies with sensations, for this reason\u2014that in such\narguments or illustrations, we make the presupposition that the\nphenomenon, in which such and such predicates inhere, has objective\nreality, while in this case we can only find such an objective reality\nas is itself empirical, that is, regards the object as a mere\nphenomenon. In reference to this subject, see the remark in Section I\n(\u00a7 4)\n\u00a7 8. Elucidation.\nAgainst this theory, which grants empirical reality to time, but denies\nto it absolute and transcendental reality, I have heard from\nintelligent men an objection so unanimously urged that I conclude that\nit must naturally present itself to every reader to whom these\nconsiderations are novel. It runs thus: \u201cChanges are real\u201d (this the\ncontinual change in our own representations demonstrates, even though\nthe existence of all external phenomena, together with their changes,\nis denied). Now, changes are only possible in time, and therefore time\nmust be something real. But there is no difficulty in answering this. I\ngrant the whole argument. Time, no doubt, is something real, that is,\nit is the real form of our internal intuition. It therefore has\nsubjective reality, in reference to our internal experience, that is, I\nhave really the representation of time and of my determinations\ntherein. Time, therefore, is not to be regarded as an object, but as\nthe mode of representation of myself as an object. But if I could\nintuite myself, or be intuited by another being, without this condition\nof sensibility, then those very determinations which we now represent\nto ourselves as changes, would present to us a knowledge in which the\nrepresentation of time, and consequently of change, would not appear.\nThe empirical reality of time, therefore, remains, as the condition of\nall our experience. But absolute reality, according to what has been\nsaid above, cannot be granted it. Time is nothing but the form of our\ninternal intuition.[11] If we take away from it the special condition\nof our sensibility, the conception of time also vanishes; and it\ninheres not in the objects themselves, but solely in the subject (or\nmind) which intuites them.\n[11] I can indeed say \u201cmy representations follow one another, or are\nsuccessive\u201d; but this means only that we are conscious of them as in a\nsuccession, that is, according to the form of the internal sense.\nTime, therefore, is not a thing in itself, nor is it any objective\ndetermination pertaining to, or inherent in things.\nBut the reason why this objection is so unanimously brought against our\ndoctrine of time, and that too by disputants who cannot start any\nintelligible arguments against the doctrine of the ideality of space,\nis this\u2014they have no hope of demonstrating apodeictically the absolute\nreality of space, because the doctrine of idealism is against them,\naccording to which the reality of external objects is not capable of\nany strict proof. On the other hand, the reality of the object of our\ninternal sense (that is, myself and my internal state) is clear\nimmediately through consciousness. The former\u2014external objects in\nspace\u2014might be a mere delusion, but the latter\u2014the object of my\ninternal perception\u2014is undeniably real. They do not, however, reflect\nthat both, without question of their reality as representations, belong\nonly to the genus phenomenon, which has always two aspects, the one,\nthe object considered as a thing in itself, without regard to the mode\nof intuiting it, and the nature of which remains for this very reason\nproblematical, the other, the form of our intuition of the object,\nwhich must be sought not in the object as a thing in itself, but in the\nsubject to which it appears\u2014which form of intuition nevertheless\nbelongs really and necessarily to the phenomenal object.\nTime and space are, therefore, two sources of knowledge, from which, \u00e0\npriori, various synthetical cognitions can be drawn. Of this we find a\nstriking example in the cognitions of space and its relations, which\nform the foundation of pure mathematics. They are the two pure forms of\nall intuitions, and thereby make synthetical propositions \u00e0 priori\npossible. But these sources of knowledge being merely conditions of our\nsensibility, do therefore, and as such, strictly determine their own\nrange and purpose, in that they do not and cannot present objects as\nthings in themselves, but are applicable to them solely in so far as\nthey are considered as sensuous phenomena. The sphere of phenomena is\nthe only sphere of their validity, and if we venture out of this, no\nfurther objective use can be made of them. For the rest, this formal\nreality of time and space leaves the validity of our empirical\nknowledge unshaken; for our certainty in that respect is equally firm,\nwhether these forms necessarily inhere in the things themselves, or\nonly in our intuitions of them. On the other hand, those who maintain\nthe absolute reality of time and space, whether as essentially\nsubsisting, or only inhering, as modifications, in things, must find\nthemselves at utter variance with the principles of experience itself.\nFor, if they decide for the first view, and make space and time into\nsubstances, this being the side taken by mathematical natural\nphilosophers, they must admit two self-subsisting nonentities, infinite\nand eternal, which exist (yet without there being anything real) for\nthe purpose of containing in themselves everything that is real. If\nthey adopt the second view of inherence, which is preferred by some\nmetaphysical natural philosophers, and regard space and time as\nrelations (contiguity in space or succession in time), abstracted from\nexperience, though represented confusedly in this state of separation,\nthey find themselves in that case necessitated to deny the validity of\nmathematical doctrines \u00e0 priori in reference to real things (for\nexample, in space)\u2014at all events their apodeictic certainty. For such\ncertainty cannot be found in an \u00e0 posteriori proposition; and the\nconceptions \u00e0 priori of space and time are, according to this opinion,\nmere creations of the imagination, having their source really in\nexperience, inasmuch as, out of relations abstracted from experience,\nimagination has made up something which contains, indeed, general\nstatements of these relations, yet of which no application can be made\nwithout the restrictions attached thereto by nature. The former of\nthese parties gains this advantage, that they keep the sphere of\nphenomena free for mathematical science. On the other hand, these very\nconditions (space and time) embarrass them greatly, when the\nunderstanding endeavours to pass the limits of that sphere. The latter\nhas, indeed, this advantage, that the representations of space and time\ndo not come in their way when they wish to judge of objects, not as\nphenomena, but merely in their relation to the understanding. Devoid,\nhowever, of a true and objectively valid \u00e0 priori intuition, they can\nneither furnish any basis for the possibility of mathematical\ncognitions \u00e0 priori, nor bring the propositions of experience into\nnecessary accordance with those of mathematics. In our theory of the\ntrue nature of these two original forms of the sensibility, both\ndifficulties are surmounted.\nIn conclusion, that transcendental \u00e6sthetic cannot contain any more\nthan these two elements\u2014space and time, is sufficiently obvious from\nthe fact that all other conceptions appertaining to sensibility, even\nthat of motion, which unites in itself both elements, presuppose\nsomething empirical. Motion, for example, presupposes the perception of\nsomething movable. But space considered in itself contains nothing\nmovable, consequently motion must be something which is found in space\nonly through experience\u2014in other words, an empirical datum. In like\nmanner, transcendental \u00e6sthetic cannot number the conception of change\namong its data \u00e0 priori; for time itself does not change, but only\nsomething which is in time. To acquire the conception of change,\ntherefore, the perception of some existing object and of the succession\nof its determinations, in one word, experience, is necessary.\n\u00a7 9. General Remarks on Transcendental \u00c6sthetic.\nI. In order to prevent any misunderstanding, it will be requisite, in\nthe first place, to recapitulate, as clearly as possible, what our\nopinion is with respect to the fundamental nature of our sensuous\ncognition in general. We have intended, then, to say that all our\nintuition is nothing but the representation of phenomena; that the\nthings which we intuite, are not in themselves the same as our\nrepresentations of them in intuition, nor are their relations in\nthemselves so constituted as they appear to us; and that if we take\naway the subject, or even only the subjective constitution of our\nsenses in general, then not only the nature and relations of objects in\nspace and time, but even space and time themselves disappear; and that\nthese, as phenomena, cannot exist in themselves, but only in us. What\nmay be the nature of objects considered as things in themselves and\nwithout reference to the receptivity of our sensibility is quite\nunknown to us. We know nothing more than our mode of perceiving them,\nwhich is peculiar to us, and which, though not of necessity pertaining\nto every animated being, is so to the whole human race. With this alone\nwe have to do. Space and time are the pure forms thereof; sensation the\nmatter. The former alone can we cognize \u00e0 priori, that is, antecedent\nto all actual perception; and for this reason such cognition is called\npure intuition. The latter is that in our cognition which is called\ncognition \u00e0 posteriori, that is, empirical intuition. The former\nappertain absolutely and necessarily to our sensibility, of whatsoever\nkind our sensations may be; the latter may be of very diversified\ncharacter. Supposing that we should carry our empirical intuition even\nto the very highest degree of clearness, we should not thereby advance\none step nearer to a knowledge of the constitution of objects as things\nin themselves. For we could only, at best, arrive at a complete\ncognition of our own mode of intuition, that is of our sensibility, and\nthis always under the conditions originally attaching to the subject,\nnamely, the conditions of space and time; while the question: \u201cWhat are\nobjects considered as things in themselves?\u201d remains unanswerable even\nafter the most thorough examination of the phenomenal world.\nTo say, then, that all our sensibility is nothing but the confused\nrepresentation of things containing exclusively that which belongs to\nthem as things in themselves, and this under an accumulation of\ncharacteristic marks and partial representations which we cannot\ndistinguish in consciousness, is a falsification of the conception of\nsensibility and phenomenization, which renders our whole doctrine\nthereof empty and useless. The difference between a confused and a\nclear representation is merely logical and has nothing to do with\ncontent. No doubt the conception of right, as employed by a sound\nunderstanding, contains all that the most subtle investigation could\nunfold from it, although, in the ordinary practical use of the word, we\nare not conscious of the manifold representations comprised in the\nconception. But we cannot for this reason assert that the ordinary\nconception is a sensuous one, containing a mere phenomenon, for right\ncannot appear as a phenomenon; but the conception of it lies in the\nunderstanding, and represents a property (the moral property) of\nactions, which belongs to them in themselves. On the other hand, the\nrepresentation in intuition of a body contains nothing which could\nbelong to an object considered as a thing in itself, but merely the\nphenomenon or appearance of something, and the mode in which we are\naffected by that appearance; and this receptivity of our faculty of\ncognition is called sensibility, and remains toto caelo different from\nthe cognition of an object in itself, even though we should examine the\ncontent of the phenomenon to the very bottom.\nIt must be admitted that the Leibnitz-Wolfian philosophy has assigned\nan entirely erroneous point of view to all investigations into the\nnature and origin of our cognitions, inasmuch as it regards the\ndistinction between the sensuous and the intellectual as merely\nlogical, whereas it is plainly transcendental, and concerns not merely\nthe clearness or obscurity, but the content and origin of both. For the\nfaculty of sensibility not only does not present us with an indistinct\nand confused cognition of objects as things in themselves, but, in\nfact, gives us no knowledge of these at all. On the contrary, so soon\nas we abstract in thought our own subjective nature, the object\nrepresented, with the properties ascribed to it by sensuous intuition,\nentirely disappears, because it was only this subjective nature that\ndetermined the form of the object as a phenomenon.\nIn phenomena, we commonly, indeed, distinguish that which essentially\nbelongs to the intuition of them, and is valid for the sensuous faculty\nof every human being, from that which belongs to the same intuition\naccidentally, as valid not for the sensuous faculty in general, but for\na particular state or organization of this or that sense. Accordingly,\nwe are accustomed to say that the former is a cognition which\nrepresents the object itself, whilst the latter presents only a\nparticular appearance or phenomenon thereof. This distinction, however,\nis only empirical. If we stop here (as is usual), and do not regard the\nempirical intuition as itself a mere phenomenon (as we ought to do), in\nwhich nothing that can appertain to a thing in itself is to be found,\nour transcendental distinction is lost, and we believe that we cognize\nobjects as things in themselves, although in the whole range of the\nsensuous world, investigate the nature of its objects as profoundly as\nwe may, we have to do with nothing but phenomena. Thus, we call the\nrainbow a mere appearance of phenomenon in a sunny shower, and the\nrain, the reality or thing in itself; and this is right enough, if we\nunderstand the latter conception in a merely physical sense, that is,\nas that which in universal experience, and under whatever conditions of\nsensuous perception, is known in intuition to be so and so determined,\nand not otherwise. But if we consider this empirical datum generally,\nand inquire, without reference to its accordance with all our senses,\nwhether there can be discovered in it aught which represents an object\nas a thing in itself (the raindrops of course are not such, for they\nare, as phenomena, empirical objects), the question of the relation of\nthe representation to the object is transcendental; and not only are\nthe raindrops mere phenomena, but even their circular form, nay, the\nspace itself through which they fall, is nothing in itself, but both\nare mere modifications or fundamental dispositions of our sensuous\nintuition, whilst the transcendental object remains for us utterly\nunknown.\nThe second important concern of our \u00e6sthetic is that it does not obtain\nfavour merely as a plausible hypothesis, but possess as undoubted a\ncharacter of certainty as can be demanded of any theory which is to\nserve for an organon. In order fully to convince the reader of this\ncertainty, we shall select a case which will serve to make its validity\napparent, and also to illustrate what has been said in \u00a7 3.\nSuppose, then, that space and time are in themselves objective, and\nconditions of the\u2014possibility of objects as things in themselves. In\nthe first place, it is evident that both present us, with very many\napodeictic and synthetic propositions \u00e0 priori, but especially\nspace\u2014and for this reason we shall prefer it for investigation at\npresent. As the propositions of geometry are cognized synthetically \u00e0\npriori, and with apodeictic certainty, I inquire: Whence do you obtain\npropositions of this kind, and on what basis does the understanding\nrest, in order to arrive at such absolutely necessary and universally\nvalid truths?\nThere is no other way than through intuitions or conceptions, as such;\nand these are given either \u00e0 priori or \u00e0 posteriori. The latter,\nnamely, empirical conceptions, together with the empirical intuition on\nwhich they are founded, cannot afford any synthetical proposition,\nexcept such as is itself also empirical, that is, a proposition of\nexperience. But an empirical proposition cannot possess the qualities\nof necessity and absolute universality, which, nevertheless, are the\ncharacteristics of all geometrical propositions. As to the first and\nonly means to arrive at such cognitions, namely, through mere\nconceptions or intuitions \u00e0 priori, it is quite clear that from mere\nconceptions no synthetical cognitions, but only analytical ones, can be\nobtained. Take, for example, the proposition: \u201cTwo straight lines\ncannot enclose a space, and with these alone no figure is possible,\u201d\nand try to deduce it from the conception of a straight line and the\nnumber two; or take the proposition: \u201cIt is possible to construct a\nfigure with three straight lines,\u201d and endeavour, in like manner, to\ndeduce it from the mere conception of a straight line and the number\nthree. All your endeavours are in vain, and you find yourself forced to\nhave recourse to intuition, as, in fact, geometry always does. You\ntherefore give yourself an object in intuition. But of what kind is\nthis intuition? Is it a pure \u00e0 priori, or is it an empirical intuition?\nIf the latter, then neither an universally valid, much less an\napodeictic proposition can arise from it, for experience never can give\nus any such proposition. You must, therefore, give yourself an object \u00e0\npriori in intuition, and upon that ground your synthetical proposition.\nNow if there did not exist within you a faculty of intuition \u00e0 priori;\nif this subjective condition were not in respect to its form also the\nuniversal condition \u00e0 priori under which alone the object of this\nexternal intuition is itself possible; if the object (that is, the\ntriangle) were something in itself, without relation to you the\nsubject; how could you affirm that that which lies necessarily in your\nsubjective conditions in order to construct a triangle, must also\nnecessarily belong to the triangle in itself? For to your conceptions\nof three lines, you could not add anything new (that is, the figure);\nwhich, therefore, must necessarily be found in the object, because the\nobject is given before your cognition, and not by means of it. If,\ntherefore, space (and time also) were not a mere form of your\nintuition, which contains conditions \u00e0 priori, under which alone things\ncan become external objects for you, and without which subjective\nconditions the objects are in themselves nothing, you could not\nconstruct any synthetical proposition whatsoever regarding external\nobjects. It is therefore not merely possible or probable, but\nindubitably certain, that space and time, as the necessary conditions\nof all our external and internal experience, are merely subjective\nconditions of all our intuitions, in relation to which all objects are\ntherefore mere phenomena, and not things in themselves, presented to us\nin this particular manner. And for this reason, in respect to the form\nof phenomena, much may be said \u00e0 priori, whilst of the thing in itself,\nwhich may lie at the foundation of these phenomena, it is impossible to\nsay anything.\nII. In confirmation of this theory of the ideality of the external as\nwell as internal sense, consequently of all objects of sense, as mere\nphenomena, we may especially remark that all in our cognition that\nbelongs to intuition contains nothing more than mere relations. (The\nfeelings of pain and pleasure, and the will, which are not cognitions,\nare excepted.) The relations, to wit, of place in an intuition\n(extension), change of place (motion), and laws according to which this\nchange is determined (moving forces). That, however, which is present\nin this or that place, or any operation going on, or result taking\nplace in the things themselves, with the exception of change of place,\nis not given to us by intuition. Now by means of mere relations, a\nthing cannot be known in itself; and it may therefore be fairly\nconcluded, that, as through the external sense nothing but mere\nrepresentations of relations are given us, the said external sense in\nits representation can contain only the relation of the object to the\nsubject, but not the essential nature of the object as a thing in\nitself.\nThe same is the case with the internal intuition, not only because, in\nthe internal intuition, the representation of the external senses\nconstitutes the material with which the mind is occupied; but because\ntime, in which we place, and which itself antecedes the consciousness\nof, these representations in experience, and which, as the formal\ncondition of the mode according to which objects are placed in the\nmind, lies at the foundation of them, contains relations of the\nsuccessive, the coexistent, and of that which always must be coexistent\nwith succession, the permanent. Now that which, as representation, can\nantecede every exercise of thought (of an object), is intuition; and\nwhen it contains nothing but relations, it is the form of the\nintuition, which, as it presents us with no representation, except in\nso far as something is placed in the mind, can be nothing else than the\nmode in which the mind is affected by its own activity, to wit\u2014its\npresenting to itself representations, consequently the mode in which\nthe mind is affected by itself; that is, it can be nothing but an\ninternal sense in respect to its form. Everything that is represented\nthrough the medium of sense is so far phenomenal; consequently, we must\neither refuse altogether to admit an internal sense, or the subject,\nwhich is the object of that sense, could only be represented by it as\nphenomenon, and not as it would judge of itself, if its intuition were\npure spontaneous activity, that is, were intellectual. The difficulty\nhere lies wholly in the question: How can the subject have an internal\nintuition of itself? But this difficulty is common to every theory. The\nconsciousness of self (apperception) is the simple representation of\nthe \u201cego\u201d; and if by means of that representation alone, all the\nmanifold representations in the subject were spontaneously given, then\nour internal intuition would be intellectual. This consciousness in man\nrequires an internal perception of the manifold representations which\nare previously given in the subject; and the manner in which these\nrepresentations are given in the mind without spontaneity, must, on\naccount of this difference (the want of spontaneity), be called\nsensibility. If the faculty of self-consciousness is to apprehend what\nlies in the mind, it must all act that and can in this way alone\nproduce an intuition of self. But the form of this intuition, which\nlies in the original constitution of the mind, determines, in the\nrepresentation of time, the manner in which the manifold\nrepresentations are to combine themselves in the mind; since the\nsubject intuites itself, not as it would represent itself immediately\nand spontaneously, but according to the manner in which the mind is\ninternally affected, consequently, as it appears, and not as it is.\nIII. When we say that the intuition of external objects, and also the\nself-intuition of the subject, represent both, objects and subject, in\nspace and time, as they affect our senses, that is, as they appear\u2014this\nis by no means equivalent to asserting that these objects are mere\nillusory appearances. For when we speak of things as phenomena, the\nobjects, nay, even the properties which we ascribe to them, are looked\nupon as really given; only that, in so far as this or that property\ndepends upon the mode of intuition of the subject, in the relation of\nthe given object to the subject, the object as phenomenon is to be\ndistinguished from the object as a thing in itself. Thus I do not say\nthat bodies seem or appear to be external to me, or that my soul seems\nmerely to be given in my self-consciousness, although I maintain that\nthe properties of space and time, in conformity to which I set both, as\nthe condition of their existence, abide in my mode of intuition, and\nnot in the objects in themselves. It would be my own fault, if out of\nthat which I should reckon as phenomenon, I made mere illusory\nappearance.[12] But this will not happen, because of our principle of\nthe ideality of all sensuous intuitions. On the contrary, if we ascribe\nobjective reality to these forms of representation, it becomes\nimpossible to avoid changing everything into mere appearance. For if we\nregard space and time as properties, which must be found in objects as\nthings in themselves, as sine quibus non of the possibility of their\nexistence, and reflect on the absurdities in which we then find\nourselves involved, inasmuch as we are compelled to admit the existence\nof two infinite things, which are nevertheless not substances, nor\nanything really inhering in substances, nay, to admit that they are the\nnecessary conditions of the existence of all things, and moreover, that\nthey must continue to exist, although all existing things were\nannihilated\u2014we cannot blame the good Berkeley for degrading bodies to\nmere illusory appearances. Nay, even our own existence, which would in\nthis case depend upon the self-existent reality of such a mere\nnonentity as time, would necessarily be changed with it into mere\nappearance\u2014an absurdity which no one has as yet been guilty of.\n[12] The predicates of the phenomenon can be affixed to the object\nitself in relation to our sensuous faculty; for example, the red\ncolour or the perfume to the rose. But (illusory) appearance never can\nbe attributed as a predicate to an object, for this very reason, that\nit attributes to this object in itself that which belongs to it only\nin relation to our sensuous faculty, or to the subject in general,\ne.g., the two handles which were formerly ascribed to Saturn. That\nwhich is never to be found in the object itself, but always in the\nrelation of the object to the subject, and which moreover is\ninseparable from our representation of the object, we denominate\nphenomenon. Thus the predicates of space and time are rightly\nattributed to objects of the senses as such, and in this there is no\nillusion. On the contrary, if I ascribe redness of the rose as a thing\nin itself, or to Saturn his handles, or extension to all external\nobjects, considered as things in themselves, without regarding the\ndeterminate relation of these objects to the subject, and without\nlimiting my judgement to that relation\u2014then, and then only, arises\nillusion.\nIV. In natural theology, where we think of an object\u2014God\u2014which never\ncan be an object of intuition to us, and even to himself can never be\nan object of sensuous intuition, we carefully avoid attributing to his\nintuition the conditions of space and time\u2014and intuition all his\ncognition must be, and not thought, which always includes limitation.\nBut with what right can we do this if we make them forms of objects as\nthings in themselves, and such, moreover, as would continue to exist as\n\u00e0 priori conditions of the existence of things, even though the things\nthemselves were annihilated? For as conditions of all existence in\ngeneral, space and time must be conditions of the existence of the\nSupreme Being also. But if we do not thus make them objective forms of\nall things, there is no other way left than to make them subjective\nforms of our mode of intuition\u2014external and internal; which is called\nsensuous, because it is not primitive, that is, is not such as gives in\nitself the existence of the object of the intuition (a mode of\nintuition which, so far as we can judge, can belong only to the\nCreator), but is dependent on the existence of the object, is possible,\ntherefore, only on condition that the representative faculty of the\nsubject is affected by the object.\nIt is, moreover, not necessary that we should limit the mode of\nintuition in space and time to the sensuous faculty of man. It may well\nbe that all finite thinking beings must necessarily in this respect\nagree with man (though as to this we cannot decide), but sensibility\ndoes not on account of this universality cease to be sensibility, for\nthis very reason, that it is a deduced (intuitus derivativus), and not\nan original (intuitus originarius), consequently not an intellectual\nintuition, and this intuition, as such, for reasons above mentioned,\nseems to belong solely to the Supreme Being, but never to a being\ndependent, quoad its existence, as well as its intuition (which its\nexistence determines and limits relatively to given objects). This\nlatter remark, however, must be taken only as an illustration, and not\nas any proof of the truth of our \u00e6sthetical theory.\n\u00a7 10. Conclusion of the Transcendental \u00c6sthetic.\nWe have now completely before us one part of the solution of the grand\ngeneral problem of transcendental philosophy, namely, the question:\n\u201cHow are synthetical propositions \u00e0 priori possible?\u201d That is to say,\nwe have shown that we are in possession of pure \u00e0 priori intuitions,\nnamely, space and time, in which we find, when in a judgement \u00e0 priori\nwe pass out beyond the given conception, something which is not\ndiscoverable in that conception, but is certainly found \u00e0 priori in the\nintuition which corresponds to the conception, and can be united\nsynthetically with it. But the judgements which these pure intuitions\nenable us to make, never reach farther than to objects of the senses,\nand are valid only for objects of possible experience.\nSecond Part\u2014TRANSCENDENTAL LOGIC\nINTRODUCTION. Idea of a Transcendental Logic.\nI. Of Logic in General.\nOur knowledge springs from two main sources in the mind, first of which\nis the faculty or power of receiving representations (receptivity for\nimpressions); the second is the power of cognizing by means of these\nrepresentations (spontaneity in the production of conceptions). Through\nthe first an object is given to us; through the second, it is, in\nrelation to the representation (which is a mere determination of the\nmind), thought. Intuition and conceptions constitute, therefore, the\nelements of all our knowledge, so that neither conceptions without an\nintuition in some way corresponding to them, nor intuition without\nconceptions, can afford us a cognition. Both are either pure or\nempirical. They are empirical, when sensation (which presupposes the\nactual presence of the object) is contained in them; and pure, when no\nsensation is mixed with the representation. Sensations we may call the\nmatter of sensuous cognition. Pure intuition consequently contains\nmerely the form under which something is intuited, and pure conception\nonly the form of the thought of an object. Only pure intuitions and\npure conceptions are possible \u00e0 priori; the empirical only \u00e0\nposteriori.\nWe apply the term sensibility to the receptivity of the mind for\nimpressions, in so far as it is in some way affected; and, on the other\nhand, we call the faculty of spontaneously producing representations,\nor the spontaneity of cognition, understanding. Our nature is so\nconstituted that intuition with us never can be other than sensuous,\nthat is, it contains only the mode in which we are affected by objects.\nOn the other hand, the faculty of thinking the object of sensuous\nintuition is the understanding. Neither of these faculties has a\npreference over the other. Without the sensuous faculty no object would\nbe given to us, and without the understanding no object would be\nthought. Thoughts without content are void; intuitions without\nconceptions, blind. Hence it is as necessary for the mind to make its\nconceptions sensuous (that is, to join to them the object in\nintuition), as to make its intuitions intelligible (that is, to bring\nthem under conceptions). Neither of these faculties can exchange its\nproper function. Understanding cannot intuite, and the sensuous faculty\ncannot think. In no other way than from the united operation of both,\ncan knowledge arise. But no one ought, on this account, to overlook the\ndifference of the elements contributed by each; we have rather great\nreason carefully to separate and distinguish them. We therefore\ndistinguish the science of the laws of sensibility, that is, \u00e6sthetic,\nfrom the science of the laws of the understanding, that is, logic.\nNow, logic in its turn may be considered as twofold\u2014namely, as logic of\nthe general, or of the particular use of the understanding. The first\ncontains the absolutely necessary laws of thought, without which no use\nwhatsoever of the understanding is possible, and gives laws therefore\nto the understanding, without regard to the difference of objects on\nwhich it may be employed. The logic of the particular use of the\nunderstanding contains the laws of correct thinking upon a particular\nclass of objects. The former may be called elemental logic\u2014the latter,\nthe organon of this or that particular science. The latter is for the\nmost part employed in the schools, as a prop\u00e6deutic to the sciences,\nalthough, indeed, according to the course of human reason, it is the\nlast thing we arrive at, when the science has been already matured, and\nneeds only the finishing touches towards its correction and completion;\nfor our knowledge of the objects of our attempted science must be\ntolerably extensive and complete before we can indicate the laws by\nwhich a science of these objects can be established.\nGeneral logic is again either pure or applied. In the former, we\nabstract all the empirical conditions under which the understanding is\nexercised; for example, the influence of the senses, the play of the\nfantasy or imagination, the laws of the memory, the force of habit, of\ninclination, etc., consequently also, the sources of prejudice\u2014in a\nword, we abstract all causes from which particular cognitions arise,\nbecause these causes regard the understanding under certain\ncircumstances of its application, and, to the knowledge of them\nexperience is required. Pure general logic has to do, therefore, merely\nwith pure \u00e0 priori principles, and is a canon of understanding and\nreason, but only in respect of the formal part of their use, be the\ncontent what it may, empirical or transcendental. General logic is\ncalled applied, when it is directed to the laws of the use of the\nunderstanding, under the subjective empirical conditions which\npsychology teaches us. It has therefore empirical principles, although,\nat the same time, it is in so far general, that it applies to the\nexercise of the understanding, without regard to the difference of\nobjects. On this account, moreover, it is neither a canon of the\nunderstanding in general, nor an organon of a particular science, but\nmerely a cathartic of the human understanding.\nIn general logic, therefore, that part which constitutes pure logic\nmust be carefully distinguished from that which constitutes applied\n(though still general) logic. The former alone is properly science,\nalthough short and dry, as the methodical exposition of an elemental\ndoctrine of the understanding ought to be. In this, therefore,\nlogicians must always bear in mind two rules:\n1. As general logic, it makes abstraction of all content of the\ncognition of the understanding, and of the difference of objects, and\nhas to do with nothing but the mere form of thought.\n2. As pure logic, it has no empirical principles, and consequently\ndraws nothing (contrary to the common persuasion) from psychology,\nwhich therefore has no influence on the canon of the understanding. It\nis a demonstrated doctrine, and everything in it must be certain\ncompletely \u00e0 priori.\nWhat I called applied logic (contrary to the common acceptation of this\nterm, according to which it should contain certain exercises for the\nscholar, for which pure logic gives the rules), is a representation of\nthe understanding, and of the rules of its necessary employment in\nconcreto, that is to say, under the accidental conditions of the\nsubject, which may either hinder or promote this employment, and which\nare all given only empirically. Thus applied logic treats of attention,\nits impediments and consequences, of the origin of error, of the state\nof doubt, hesitation, conviction, etc., and to it is related pure\ngeneral logic in the same way that pure morality, which contains only\nthe necessary moral laws of a free will, is related to practical\nethics, which considers these laws under all the impediments of\nfeelings, inclinations, and passions to which men are more or less\nsubjected, and which never can furnish us with a true and demonstrated\nscience, because it, as well as applied logic, requires empirical and\npsychological principles.\nII. Of Transcendental Logic.\nGeneral logic, as we have seen, makes abstraction of all content of\ncognition, that is, of all relation of cognition to its object, and\nregards only the logical form in the relation of cognitions to each\nother, that is, the form of thought in general. But as we have both\npure and empirical intuitions (as transcendental \u00e6sthetic proves), in\nlike manner a distinction might be drawn between pure and empirical\nthought (of objects). In this case, there would exist a kind of logic,\nin which we should not make abstraction of all content of cognition;\nfor or logic which should comprise merely the laws of pure thought (of\nan object), would of course exclude all those cognitions which were of\nempirical content. This kind of logic would also examine the origin of\nour cognitions of objects, so far as that origin cannot be ascribed to\nthe objects themselves; while, on the contrary, general logic has\nnothing to do with the origin of our cognitions, but contemplates our\nrepresentations, be they given primitively \u00e0 priori in ourselves, or be\nthey only of empirical origin, solely according to the laws which the\nunderstanding observes in employing them in the process of thought, in\nrelation to each other. Consequently, general logic treats of the form\nof the understanding only, which can be applied to representations,\nfrom whatever source they may have arisen.\nAnd here I shall make a remark, which the reader must bear well in mind\nin the course of the following considerations, to wit, that not every\ncognition \u00e0 priori, but only those through which we cognize that and\nhow certain representations (intuitions or conceptions) are applied or\nare possible only \u00e0 priori; that is to say, the \u00e0 priori possibility of\ncognition and the \u00e0 priori use of it are transcendental. Therefore\nneither is space, nor any \u00e0 priori geometrical determination of space,\na transcendental Representation, but only the knowledge that such a\nrepresentation is not of empirical origin, and the possibility of its\nrelating to objects of experience, although itself \u00e0 priori, can be\ncalled transcendental. So also, the application of space to objects in\ngeneral would be transcendental; but if it be limited to objects of\nsense it is empirical. Thus, the distinction of the transcendental and\nempirical belongs only to the critique of cognitions, and does not\nconcern the relation of these to their object.\nAccordingly, in the expectation that there may perhaps be conceptions\nwhich relate \u00e0 priori to objects, not as pure or sensuous intuitions,\nbut merely as acts of pure thought (which are therefore conceptions,\nbut neither of empirical nor \u00e6sthetical origin)\u2014in this expectation, I\nsay, we form to ourselves, by anticipation, the idea of a science of\npure understanding and rational cognition, by means of which we may\ncogitate objects entirely \u00e0 priori. A science of this kind, which\nshould determine the origin, the extent, and the objective validity of\nsuch cognitions, must be called transcendental logic, because it has\nnot, like general logic, to do with the laws of understanding and\nreason in relation to empirical as well as pure rational cognitions\nwithout distinction, but concerns itself with these only in an \u00e0 priori\nrelation to objects.\nIII. Of the Division of General Logic into Analytic and Dialectic.\nThe old question with which people sought to push logicians into a\ncorner, so that they must either have recourse to pitiful sophisms or\nconfess their ignorance, and consequently the vanity of their whole\nart, is this: \u201cWhat is truth?\u201d The definition of the word truth, to\nwit, \u201cthe accordance of the cognition with its object,\u201d is presupposed\nin the question; but we desire to be told, in the answer to it, what is\nthe universal and secure criterion of the truth of every cognition.\nTo know what questions we may reasonably propose is in itself a strong\nevidence of sagacity and intelligence. For if a question be in itself\nabsurd and unsusceptible of a rational answer, it is attended with the\ndanger\u2014not to mention the shame that falls upon the person who proposes\nit\u2014of seducing the unguarded listener into making absurd answers, and\nwe are presented with the ridiculous spectacle of one (as the ancients\nsaid) \u201cmilking the he-goat, and the other holding a sieve.\u201d\nIf truth consists in the accordance of a cognition with its object,\nthis object must be, ipso facto, distinguished from all others; for a\ncognition is false if it does not accord with the object to which it\nrelates, although it contains something which may be affirmed of other\nobjects. Now an universal criterion of truth would be that which is\nvalid for all cognitions, without distinction of their objects. But it\nis evident that since, in the case of such a criterion, we make\nabstraction of all the content of a cognition (that is, of all relation\nto its object), and truth relates precisely to this content, it must be\nutterly absurd to ask for a mark of the truth of this content of\ncognition; and that, accordingly, a sufficient, and at the same time\nuniversal, test of truth cannot possibly be found. As we have already\ntermed the content of a cognition its matter, we shall say: \u201cOf the\ntruth of our cognitions in respect of their matter, no universal test\ncan be demanded, because such a demand is self-contradictory.\u201d\nOn the other hand, with regard to our cognition in respect of its mere\nform (excluding all content), it is equally manifest that logic, in so\nfar as it exhibits the universal and necessary laws of the\nunderstanding, must in these very laws present us with criteria of\ntruth. Whatever contradicts these rules is false, because thereby the\nunderstanding is made to contradict its own universal laws of thought;\nthat is, to contradict itself. These criteria, however, apply solely to\nthe form of truth, that is, of thought in general, and in so far they\nare perfectly accurate, yet not sufficient. For although a cognition\nmay be perfectly accurate as to logical form, that is, not\nself-contradictory, it is notwithstanding quite possible that it may\nnot stand in agreement with its object. Consequently, the merely\nlogical criterion of truth, namely, the accordance of a cognition with\nthe universal and formal laws of understanding and reason, is nothing\nmore than the conditio sine qua non, or negative condition of all\ntruth. Farther than this logic cannot go, and the error which depends\nnot on the form, but on the content of the cognition, it has no test to\ndiscover.\nGeneral logic, then, resolves the whole formal business of\nunderstanding and reason into its elements, and exhibits them as\nprinciples of all logical judging of our cognitions. This part of logic\nmay, therefore, be called analytic, and is at least the negative test\nof truth, because all cognitions must first of an be estimated and\ntried according to these laws before we proceed to investigate them in\nrespect of their content, in order to discover whether they contain\npositive truth in regard to their object. Because, however, the mere\nform of a cognition, accurately as it may accord with logical laws, is\ninsufficient to supply us with material (objective) truth, no one, by\nmeans of logic alone, can venture to predicate anything of or decide\nconcerning objects, unless he has obtained, independently of logic,\nwell-grounded information about them, in order afterwards to examine,\naccording to logical laws, into the use and connection, in a cohering\nwhole, of that information, or, what is still better, merely to test it\nby them. Notwithstanding, there lies so seductive a charm in the\npossession of a specious art like this\u2014an art which gives to all our\ncognitions the form of the understanding, although with respect to the\ncontent thereof we may be sadly deficient\u2014that general logic, which is\nmerely a canon of judgement, has been employed as an organon for the\nactual production, or rather for the semblance of production, of\nobjective assertions, and has thus been grossly misapplied. Now general\nlogic, in its assumed character of organon, is called dialectic.\nDifferent as are the significations in which the ancients used this\nterm for a science or an art, we may safely infer, from their actual\nemployment of it, that with them it was nothing else than a logic of\nillusion\u2014a sophistical art for giving ignorance, nay, even intentional\nsophistries, the colouring of truth, in which the thoroughness of\nprocedure which logic requires was imitated, and their topic employed\nto cloak the empty pretensions. Now it may be taken as a safe and\nuseful warning, that general logic, considered as an organon, must\nalways be a logic of illusion, that is, be dialectical, for, as it\nteaches us nothing whatever respecting the content of our cognitions,\nbut merely the formal conditions of their accordance with the\nunderstanding, which do not relate to and are quite indifferent in\nrespect of objects, any attempt to employ it as an instrument (organon)\nin order to extend and enlarge the range of our knowledge must end in\nmere prating; any one being able to maintain or oppose, with some\nappearance of truth, any single assertion whatever.\nSuch instruction is quite unbecoming the dignity of philosophy. For\nthese reasons we have chosen to denominate this part of logic\ndialectic, in the sense of a critique of dialectical illusion, and we\nwish the term to be so understood in this place.\nIV. Of the Division of Transcendental Logic into Transcendental\nAnalytic and Dialectic.\nIn transcendental logic we isolate the understanding (as in\ntranscendental \u00e6sthetic the sensibility) and select from our cognition\nmerely that part of thought which has its origin in the understanding\nalone. The exercise of this pure cognition, however, depends upon this\nas its condition, that objects to which it may be applied be given to\nus in intuition, for without intuition the whole of our cognition is\nwithout objects, and is therefore quite void. That part of\ntranscendental logic, then, which treats of the elements of pure\ncognition of the understanding, and of the principles without which no\nobject at all can be thought, is transcendental analytic, and at the\nsame time a logic of truth. For no cognition can contradict it, without\nlosing at the same time all content, that is, losing all reference to\nan object, and therefore all truth. But because we are very easily\nseduced into employing these pure cognitions and principles of the\nunderstanding by themselves, and that even beyond the boundaries of\nexperience, which yet is the only source whence we can obtain matter\n(objects) on which those pure conceptions may be employed\u2014understanding\nruns the risk of making, by means of empty sophisms, a material and\nobjective use of the mere formal principles of the pure understanding,\nand of passing judgements on objects without distinction\u2014objects which\nare not given to us, nay, perhaps cannot be given to us in any way.\nNow, as it ought properly to be only a canon for judging of the\nempirical use of the understanding, this kind of logic is misused when\nwe seek to employ it as an organon of the universal and unlimited\nexercise of the understanding, and attempt with the pure understanding\nalone to judge synthetically, affirm, and determine respecting objects\nin general. In this case the exercise of the pure understanding becomes\ndialectical. The second part of our transcendental logic must therefore\nbe a critique of dialectical illusion, and this critique we shall term\ntranscendental dialectic\u2014not meaning it as an art of producing\ndogmatically such illusion (an art which is unfortunately too current\namong the practitioners of metaphysical juggling), but as a critique of\nunderstanding and reason in regard to their hyperphysical use. This\ncritique will expose the groundless nature of the pretensions of these\ntwo faculties, and invalidate their claims to the discovery and\nenlargement of our cognitions merely by means of transcendental\nprinciples, and show that the proper employment of these faculties is\nto test the judgements made by the pure understanding, and to guard it\nfrom sophistical delusion.\nFIRST DIVISION. TRANSCENDENTAL LOGIC. TRANSCENDENTAL ANALYTIC. \u00a7 1\nTranscendental analytic is the dissection of the whole of our \u00e0 priori\nknowledge into the elements of the pure cognition of the understanding.\nIn order to effect our purpose, it is necessary: (1) That the\nconceptions be pure and not empirical; (2) That they belong not to\nintuition and sensibility, but to thought and understanding; (3) That\nthey be elementary conceptions, and as such, quite different from\ndeduced or compound conceptions; (4) That our table of these elementary\nconceptions be complete, and fill up the whole sphere of the pure\nunderstanding. Now this completeness of a science cannot be accepted\nwith confidence on the guarantee of a mere estimate of its existence in\nan aggregate formed only by means of repeated experiments and attempts.\nThe completeness which we require is possible only by means of an idea\nof the totality of the \u00e0 priori cognition of the understanding, and\nthrough the thereby determined division of the conceptions which form\nthe said whole; consequently, only by means of their connection in a\nsystem. Pure understanding distinguishes itself not merely from\neverything empirical, but also completely from all sensibility. It is a\nunity self-subsistent, self-sufficient, and not to be enlarged by any\nadditions from without. Hence the sum of its cognition constitutes a\nsystem to be determined by and comprised under an idea; and the\ncompleteness and articulation of this system can at the same time serve\nas a test of the correctness and genuineness of all the parts of\ncognition that belong to it. The whole of this part of transcendental\nlogic consists of two books, of which the one contains the conceptions,\nand the other the principles of pure understanding.\nBOOK I. Analytic of Conceptions. \u00a7 2\nBy the term Analytic of Conceptions, I do not understand the analysis\nof these, or the usual process in philosophical investigations of\ndissecting the conceptions which present themselves, according to their\ncontent, and so making them clear; but I mean the hitherto little\nattempted dissection of the faculty of understanding itself, in order\nto investigate the possibility of conceptions \u00e0 priori, by looking for\nthem in the understanding alone, as their birthplace, and analysing the\npure use of this faculty. For this is the proper duty of a\ntranscendental philosophy; what remains is the logical treatment of the\nconceptions in philosophy in general. We shall therefore follow up the\npure conceptions even to their germs and beginnings in the human\nunderstanding, in which they lie, until they are developed on occasions\npresented by experience, and, freed by the same understanding from the\nempirical conditions attaching to them, are set forth in their\nunalloyed purity.\nChapter I. Of the Transcendental Clue to the Discovery of all Pure\nConceptions of the Understanding\nIntroductory \u00a7 3\nWhen we call into play a faculty of cognition, different conceptions\nmanifest themselves according to the different circumstances, and make\nknown this faculty, and assemble themselves into a more or less\nextensive collection, according to the time or penetration that has\nbeen applied to the consideration of them. Where this process,\nconducted as it is mechanically, so to speak, will end, cannot be\ndetermined with certainty. Besides, the conceptions which we discover\nin this haphazard manner present themselves by no means in order and\nsystematic unity, but are at last coupled together only according to\nresemblances to each other, and arranged in series, according to the\nquantity of their content, from the simpler to the more complex\u2014series\nwhich are anything but systematic, though not altogether without a\ncertain kind of method in their construction.\nTranscendental philosophy has the advantage, and moreover the duty, of\nsearching for its conceptions according to a principle; because these\nconceptions spring pure and unmixed out of the understanding as an\nabsolute unity, and therefore must be connected with each other\naccording to one conception or idea. A connection of this kind,\nhowever, furnishes us with a ready prepared rule, by which its proper\nplace may be assigned to every pure conception of the understanding,\nand the completeness of the system of all be determined \u00e0 priori\u2014both\nwhich would otherwise have been dependent on mere choice or chance.\nSection I. Of the Logical Use of the Understanding in General \u00a7 4\nThe understanding was defined above only negatively, as a non-sensuous\nfaculty of cognition. Now, independently of sensibility, we cannot\npossibly have any intuition; consequently, the understanding is no\nfaculty of intuition. But besides intuition there is no other mode of\ncognition, except through conceptions; consequently, the cognition of\nevery, at least of every human, understanding is a cognition through\nconceptions\u2014not intuitive, but discursive. All intuitions, as sensuous,\ndepend on affections; conceptions, therefore, upon functions. By the\nword function I understand the unity of the act of arranging diverse\nrepresentations under one common representation. Conceptions, then, are\nbased on the spontaneity of thought, as sensuous intuitions are on the\nreceptivity of impressions. Now, the understanding cannot make any\nother use of these conceptions than to judge by means of them. As no\nrepresentation, except an intuition, relates immediately to its object,\na conception never relates immediately to an object, but only to some\nother representation thereof, be that an intuition or itself a\nconception. A judgement, therefore, is the mediate cognition of an\nobject, consequently the representation of a representation of it. In\nevery judgement there is a conception which applies to, and is valid\nfor many other conceptions, and which among these comprehends also a\ngiven representation, this last being immediately connected with an\nobject. For example, in the judgement\u2014\u201cAll bodies are divisible,\u201d our\nconception of divisible applies to various other conceptions; among\nthese, however, it is here particularly applied to the conception of\nbody, and this conception of body relates to certain phenomena which\noccur to us. These objects, therefore, are mediately represented by the\nconception of divisibility. All judgements, accordingly, are functions\nof unity in our representations, inasmuch as, instead of an immediate,\na higher representation, which comprises this and various others, is\nused for our cognition of the object, and thereby many possible\ncognitions are collected into one. But we can reduce all acts of the\nunderstanding to judgements, so that understanding may be represented\nas the faculty of judging. For it is, according to what has been said\nabove, a faculty of thought. Now thought is cognition by means of\nconceptions. But conceptions, as predicates of possible judgements,\nrelate to some representation of a yet undetermined object. Thus the\nconception of body indicates something\u2014for example, metal\u2014which can be\ncognized by means of that conception. It is therefore a conception, for\nthe reason alone that other representations are contained under it, by\nmeans of which it can relate to objects. It is therefore the predicate\nto a possible judgement; for example: \u201cEvery metal is a body.\u201d All the\nfunctions of the understanding therefore can be discovered, when we can\ncompletely exhibit the functions of unity in judgements. And that this\nmay be effected very easily, the following section will show.\nSection II. Of the Logical Function of the Understanding in Judgements\n\u00a7 5\nIf we abstract all the content of a judgement, and consider only the\nintellectual form thereof, we find that the function of thought in a\njudgement can be brought under four heads, of which each contains three\nmomenta. These may be conveniently represented in the following table:\n1\n_Quantity of judgements_\nUniversal\nParticular\nSingular\n2                           3\n_Quality                   Relation_\nAffirmative                Categorical\nNegative                   Hypothetical\nInfinite                   Disjunctive\n4\n_Modality_\nProblematical\nAssertorical\nApodeictical\nAs this division appears to differ in some, though not essential\npoints, from the usual technique of logicians, the following\nobservations, for the prevention of otherwise possible\nmisunderstanding, will not be without their use.\n1. Logicians say, with justice, that in the use of judgements in\nsyllogisms, singular judgements may be treated like universal ones.\nFor, precisely because a singular judgement has no extent at all, its\npredicate cannot refer to a part of that which is contained in the\nconception of the subject and be excluded from the rest. The predicate\nis valid for the whole conception just as if it were a general\nconception, and had extent, to the whole of which the predicate\napplied. On the other hand, let us compare a singular with a general\njudgement, merely as a cognition, in regard to quantity. The singular\njudgement relates to the general one, as unity to infinity, and is\ntherefore in itself essentially different. Thus, if we estimate a\nsingular judgement (_judicium singulare_) not merely according to its\nintrinsic validity as a judgement, but also as a cognition generally,\naccording to its quantity in comparison with that of other cognitions,\nit is then entirely different from a general judgement (_judicium\ncommune_), and in a complete table of the momenta of thought deserves a\nseparate place\u2014though, indeed, this would not be necessary in a logic\nlimited merely to the consideration of the use of judgements in\nreference to each other.\n2. In like manner, in transcendental logic, infinite must be\ndistinguished from affirmative judgements, although in general logic\nthey are rightly enough classed under affirmative. General logic\nabstracts all content of the predicate (though it be negative), and\nonly considers whether the said predicate be affirmed or denied of the\nsubject. But transcendental logic considers also the worth or content\nof this logical affirmation\u2014an affirmation by means of a merely\nnegative predicate, and inquires how much the sum total of our\ncognition gains by this affirmation. For example, if I say of the soul,\n\u201cIt is not mortal\u201d\u2014by this negative judgement I should at least ward\noff error. Now, by the proposition, \u201cThe soul is not mortal,\u201d I have,\nin respect of the logical form, really affirmed, inasmuch as I thereby\nplace the soul in the unlimited sphere of immortal beings. Now, because\nof the whole sphere of possible existences, the mortal occupies one\npart, and the immortal the other, neither more nor less is affirmed by\nthe proposition than that the soul is one among the infinite multitude\nof things which remain over, when I take away the whole mortal part.\nBut by this proceeding we accomplish only this much, that the infinite\nsphere of all possible existences is in so far limited that the mortal\nis excluded from it, and the soul is placed in the remaining part of\nthe extent of this sphere. But this part remains, notwithstanding this\nexception, infinite, and more and more parts may be taken away from the\nwhole sphere, without in the slightest degree thereby augmenting or\naffirmatively determining our conception of the soul. These judgements,\ntherefore, infinite in respect of their logical extent, are, in respect\nof the content of their cognition, merely limitative; and are\nconsequently entitled to a place in our transcendental table of all the\nmomenta of thought in judgements, because the function of the\nunderstanding exercised by them may perhaps be of importance in the\nfield of its pure \u00e0 priori cognition.\n3. All relations of thought in judgements are those (a) of the\npredicate to the subject; (b) of the principle to its consequence; (c)\nof the divided cognition and all the members of the division to each\nother. In the first of these three classes, we consider only two\nconceptions; in the second, two judgements; in the third, several\njudgements in relation to each other. The hypothetical proposition, \u201cIf\nperfect justice exists, the obstinately wicked are punished,\u201d contains\nproperly the relation to each other of two propositions, namely,\n\u201cPerfect justice exists,\u201d and \u201cThe obstinately wicked are punished.\u201d\nWhether these propositions are in themselves true is a question not\nhere decided. Nothing is cogitated by means of this judgement except a\ncertain consequence. Finally, the disjunctive judgement contains a\nrelation of two or more propositions to each other\u2014a relation not of\nconsequence, but of logical opposition, in so far as the sphere of the\none proposition excludes that of the other. But it contains at the same\ntime a relation of community, in so far as all the propositions taken\ntogether fill up the sphere of the cognition. The disjunctive judgement\ncontains, therefore, the relation of the parts of the whole sphere of a\ncognition, since the sphere of each part is a complemental part of the\nsphere of the other, each contributing to form the sum total of the\ndivided cognition. Take, for example, the proposition, \u201cThe world\nexists either through blind chance, or through internal necessity, or\nthrough an external cause.\u201d Each of these propositions embraces a part\nof the sphere of our possible cognition as to the existence of a world;\nall of them taken together, the whole sphere. To take the cognition out\nof one of these spheres, is equivalent to placing it in one of the\nothers; and, on the other hand, to place it in one sphere is equivalent\nto taking it out of the rest. There is, therefore, in a disjunctive\njudgement a certain community of cognitions, which consists in this,\nthat they mutually exclude each other, yet thereby determine, as a\nwhole, the true cognition, inasmuch as, taken together, they make up\nthe complete content of a particular given cognition. And this is all\nthat I find necessary, for the sake of what follows, to remark in this\nplace.\n4. The modality of judgements is a quite peculiar function, with this\ndistinguishing characteristic, that it contributes nothing to the\ncontent of a judgement (for besides quantity, quality, and relation,\nthere is nothing more that constitutes the content of a judgement), but\nconcerns itself only with the value of the copula in relation to\nthought in general. Problematical judgements are those in which the\naffirmation or negation is accepted as merely possible (ad libitum). In\nthe assertorical, we regard the proposition as real (true); in the\napodeictical, we look on it as necessary.[13] Thus the two judgements\n(antecedens et consequens), the relation of which constitutes a\nhypothetical judgement, likewise those (the members of the division) in\nwhose reciprocity the disjunctive consists, are only problematical. In\nthe example above given the proposition, \u201cThere exists perfect\njustice,\u201d is not stated assertorically, but as an ad libitum judgement,\nwhich someone may choose to adopt, and the consequence alone is\nassertorical. Hence such judgements may be obviously false, and yet,\ntaken problematically, be conditions of our cognition of the truth.\nThus the proposition, \u201cThe world exists only by blind chance,\u201d is in\nthe disjunctive judgement of problematical import only: that is to say,\none may accept it for the moment, and it helps us (like the indication\nof the wrong road among all the roads that one can take) to find out\nthe true proposition. The problematical proposition is, therefore, that\nwhich expresses only logical possibility (which is not objective); that\nis, it expresses a free choice to admit the validity of such a\nproposition\u2014a merely arbitrary reception of it into the understanding.\nThe assertorical speaks of logical reality or truth; as, for example,\nin a hypothetical syllogism, the antecedens presents itself in a\nproblematical form in the major, in an assertorical form in the minor,\nand it shows that the proposition is in harmony with the laws of the\nunderstanding. The apodeictical proposition cogitates the assertorical\nas determined by these very laws of the understanding, consequently as\naffirming \u00e0 priori, and in this manner it expresses logical necessity.\nNow because all is here gradually incorporated with the\nunderstanding\u2014inasmuch as in the first place we judge problematically;\nthen accept assertorically our judgement as true; lastly, affirm it as\ninseparably united with the understanding, that is, as necessary and\napodeictical\u2014we may safely reckon these three functions of modality as\nso many momenta of thought.\n[13] Just as if thought were in the first instance a function of the\nunderstanding; in the second, of judgement; in the third, of reason. A\nremark which will be explained in the sequel.\nSection III. Of the Pure Conceptions of the Understanding, or\nCategories \u00a7 6\nGeneral logic, as has been repeatedly said, makes abstraction of all\ncontent of cognition, and expects to receive representations from some\nother quarter, in order, by means of analysis, to convert them into\nconceptions. On the contrary, transcendental logic has lying before it\nthe manifold content of \u00e0 priori sensibility, which transcendental\n\u00e6sthetic presents to it in order to give matter to the pure conceptions\nof the understanding, without which transcendental logic would have no\ncontent, and be therefore utterly void. Now space and time contain an\ninfinite diversity of determinations of pure \u00e0 priori intuition, but\nare nevertheless the condition of the mind\u2019s receptivity, under which\nalone it can obtain representations of objects, and which,\nconsequently, must always affect the conception of these objects. But\nthe spontaneity of thought requires that this diversity be examined\nafter a certain manner, received into the mind, and connected, in order\nafterwards to form a cognition out of it. This Process I call\nsynthesis.\nBy the word synthesis, in its most general signification, I understand\nthe process of joining different representations to each other and of\ncomprehending their diversity in one cognition. This synthesis is pure\nwhen the diversity is not given empirically but \u00e0 priori (as that in\nspace and time). Our representations must be given previously to any\nanalysis of them; and no conceptions can arise, quoad their content,\nanalytically. But the synthesis of a diversity (be it given \u00e0 priori or\nempirically) is the first requisite for the production of a cognition,\nwhich in its beginning, indeed, may be crude and confused, and\ntherefore in need of analysis\u2014still, synthesis is that by which alone\nthe elements of our cognitions are collected and united into a certain\ncontent, consequently it is the first thing on which we must fix our\nattention, if we wish to investigate the origin of our knowledge.\nSynthesis, generally speaking, is, as we shall afterwards see, the mere\noperation of the imagination\u2014a blind but indispensable function of the\nsoul, without which we should have no cognition whatever, but of the\nworking of which we are seldom even conscious. But to reduce this\nsynthesis to conceptions is a function of the understanding, by means\nof which we attain to cognition, in the proper meaning of the term.\nPure synthesis, represented generally, gives us the pure conception of\nthe understanding. But by this pure synthesis, I mean that which rests\nupon a basis of \u00e0 priori synthetical unity. Thus, our numeration (and\nthis is more observable in large numbers) is a synthesis according to\nconceptions, because it takes place according to a common basis of\nunity (for example, the decade). By means of this conception,\ntherefore, the unity in the synthesis of the manifold becomes\nnecessary.\nBy means of analysis different representations are brought under one\nconception\u2014an operation of which general logic treats. On the other\nhand, the duty of transcendental logic is to reduce to conceptions, not\nrepresentations, but the pure synthesis of representations. The first\nthing which must be given to us for the sake of the \u00e0 priori cognition\nof all objects, is the diversity of the pure intuition; the synthesis\nof this diversity by means of the imagination is the second; but this\ngives, as yet, no cognition. The conceptions which give unity to this\npure synthesis, and which consist solely in the representation of this\nnecessary synthetical unity, furnish the third requisite for the\ncognition of an object, and these conceptions are given by the\nunderstanding.\nThe same function which gives unity to the different representation in\na judgement, gives also unity to the mere synthesis of different\nrepresentations in an intuition; and this unity we call the pure\nconception of the understanding. Thus, the same understanding, and by\nthe same operations, whereby in conceptions, by means of analytical\nunity, it produced the logical form of a judgement, introduces, by\nmeans of the synthetical unity of the manifold in intuition, a\ntranscendental content into its representations, on which account they\nare called pure conceptions of the understanding, and they apply \u00e0\npriori to objects, a result not within the power of general logic.\nIn this manner, there arise exactly so many pure conceptions of the\nunderstanding, applying \u00e0 priori to objects of intuition in general, as\nthere are logical functions in all possible judgements. For there is no\nother function or faculty existing in the understanding besides those\nenumerated in that table. These conceptions we shall, with Aristotle,\ncall categories, our purpose being originally identical with his,\nnotwithstanding the great difference in the execution.\nTABLE OF THE CATEGORIES\n1                         2\n_Of Quantity                Of Quality_\nUnity                      Reality\nPlurality                  Negation\nTotality                   Limitation\n3\n_Of Relation_\nOf Inherence and Subsistence (substantia et accidens)\nOf Causality and Dependence (cause and effect)\nOf Community (reciprocity between the agent and patient)\n4\n_Of Modality_\nPossibility&mdash;Impossibility\nExistence&mdash;Non-existence\nNecessity&mdash;Contingence\nThis, then, is a catalogue of all the originally pure conceptions of\nthe synthesis which the understanding contains \u00e0 priori, and these\nconceptions alone entitle it to be called a pure understanding;\ninasmuch as only by them it can render the manifold of intuition\nconceivable, in other words, think an object of intuition. This\ndivision is made systematically from a common principle, namely the\nfaculty of judgement (which is just the same as the power of thought),\nand has not arisen rhapsodically from a search at haphazard after pure\nconceptions, respecting the full number of which we never could be\ncertain, inasmuch as we employ induction alone in our search, without\nconsidering that in this way we can never understand wherefore\nprecisely these conceptions, and none others, abide in the pure\nunderstanding. It was a design worthy of an acute thinker like\nAristotle, to search for these fundamental conceptions. Destitute,\nhowever, of any guiding principle, he picked them up just as they\noccurred to him, and at first hunted out ten, which he called\ncategories (predicaments). Afterwards be believed that he had\ndiscovered five others, which were added under the name of post\npredicaments. But his catalogue still remained defective. Besides,\nthere are to be found among them some of the modes of pure sensibility\n(quando, ubi, situs, also prius, simul), and likewise an empirical\nconception (motus)\u2014which can by no means belong to this genealogical\nregister of the pure understanding. Moreover, there are deduced\nconceptions (actio, passio) enumerated among the original conceptions,\nand, of the latter, some are entirely wanting.\nWith regard to these, it is to be remarked, that the categories, as the\ntrue primitive conceptions of the pure understanding, have also their\npure deduced conceptions, which, in a complete system of transcendental\nphilosophy, must by no means be passed over; though in a merely\ncritical essay we must be contented with the simple mention of the\nfact.\nLet it be allowed me to call these pure, but deduced conceptions of the\nunderstanding, the predicables of the pure understanding, in\ncontradistinction to predicaments. If we are in possession of the\noriginal and primitive, the deduced and subsidiary conceptions can\neasily be added, and the genealogical tree of the understanding\ncompletely delineated. As my present aim is not to set forth a complete\nsystem, but merely the principles of one, I reserve this task for\nanother time. It may be easily executed by any one who will refer to\nthe ontological manuals, and subordinate to the category of causality,\nfor example, the predicables of force, action, passion; to that of\ncommunity, those of presence and resistance; to the categories of\nmodality, those of origination, extinction, change; and so with the\nrest. The categories combined with the modes of pure sensibility, or\nwith one another, afford a great number of deduced \u00e0 priori\nconceptions; a complete enumeration of which would be a useful and not\nunpleasant, but in this place a perfectly dispensable, occupation.\nI purposely omit the definitions of the categories in this treatise. I\nshall analyse these conceptions only so far as is necessary for the\ndoctrine of method, which is to form a part of this critique. In a\nsystem of pure reason, definitions of them would be with justice\ndemanded of me, but to give them here would only bide from our view the\nmain aim of our investigation, at the same time raising doubts and\nobjections, the consideration of which, without injustice to our main\npurpose, may be very well postponed till another opportunity.\nMeanwhile, it ought to be sufficiently clear, from the little we have\nalready said on this subject, that the formation of a complete\nvocabulary of pure conceptions, accompanied by all the requisite\nexplanations, is not only a possible, but an easy undertaking. The\ncompartments already exist; it is only necessary to fill them up; and a\nsystematic topic like the present, indicates with perfect precision the\nproper place to which each conception belongs, while it readily points\nout any that have not yet been filled up.\n\u00a7 7\nOur table of the categories suggests considerations of some importance,\nwhich may perhaps have significant results in regard to the scientific\nform of all rational cognitions. For, that this table is useful in the\ntheoretical part of philosophy, nay, indispensable for the sketching of\nthe complete plan of a science, so far as that science rests upon\nconceptions \u00e0 priori, and for dividing it mathematically, according to\nfixed principles, is most manifest from the fact that it contains all\nthe elementary conceptions of the understanding, nay, even the form of\na system of these in the understanding itself, and consequently\nindicates all the momenta, and also the internal arrangement of a\nprojected speculative science, as I have elsewhere shown.[14] Here\nfollow some of these observations.\n[14] In the \u201cMetaphysical Principles of Natural Science.\u201d\nI. This table, which contains four classes of conceptions of the\nunderstanding, may, in the first instance, be divided into two classes,\nthe first of which relates to objects of intuition\u2014pure as well as\nempirical; the second, to the existence of these objects, either in\nrelation to one another, or to the understanding.\nThe former of these classes of categories I would entitle the\nmathematical, and the latter the dynamical categories. The former, as\nwe see, has no correlates; these are only to be found in the second\nclass. This difference must have a ground in the nature of the human\nunderstanding.\nII. The number of the categories in each class is always the same,\nnamely, three\u2014a fact which also demands some consideration, because in\nall other cases division \u00e0 priori through conceptions is necessarily\ndichotomy. It is to be added, that the third category in each triad\nalways arises from the combination of the second with the first.\nThus totality is nothing else but plurality contemplated as unity;\nlimitation is merely reality conjoined with negation; community is the\ncausality of a substance, reciprocally determining, and determined by\nother substances; and finally, necessity is nothing but existence,\nwhich is given through the possibility itself. Let it not be supposed,\nhowever, that the third category is merely a deduced, and not a\nprimitive conception of the pure understanding. For the conjunction of\nthe first and second, in order to produce the third conception,\nrequires a particular function of the understanding, which is by no\nmeans identical with those which are exercised in the first and second.\nThus, the conception of a number (which belongs to the category of\ntotality) is not always possible, where the conceptions of multitude\nand unity exist (for example, in the representation of the infinite).\nOr, if I conjoin the conception of a cause with that of a substance, it\ndoes not follow that the conception of influence, that is, how one\nsubstance can be the cause of something in another substance, will be\nunderstood from that. Thus it is evident that a particular act of the\nunderstanding is here necessary; and so in the other instances.\nIII. With respect to one category, namely, that of community, which is\nfound in the third class, it is not so easy as with the others to\ndetect its accordance with the form of the disjunctive judgement which\ncorresponds to it in the table of the logical functions.\nIn order to assure ourselves of this accordance, we must observe that\nin every disjunctive judgement, the sphere of the judgement (that is,\nthe complex of all that is contained in it) is represented as a whole\ndivided into parts; and, since one part cannot be contained in the\nother, they are cogitated as co-ordinated with, not subordinated to\neach other, so that they do not determine each other unilaterally, as\nin a linear series, but reciprocally, as in an aggregate\u2014(if one member\nof the division is posited, all the rest are excluded; and conversely).\nNow a like connection is cogitated in a whole of things; for one thing\nis not subordinated, as effect, to another as cause of its existence,\nbut, on the contrary, is co-ordinated contemporaneously and\nreciprocally, as a cause in relation to the determination of the others\n(for example, in a body\u2014the parts of which mutually attract and repel\neach other). And this is an entirely different kind of connection from\nthat which we find in the mere relation of the cause to the effect (the\nprinciple to the consequence), for in such a connection the consequence\ndoes not in its turn determine the principle, and therefore does not\nconstitute, with the latter, a whole\u2014just as the Creator does not with\nthe world make up a whole. The process of understanding by which it\nrepresents to itself the sphere of a divided conception, is employed\nalso when we think of a thing as divisible; and in the same manner as\nthe members of the division in the former exclude one another, and yet\nare connected in one sphere, so the understanding represents to itself\nthe parts of the latter, as having\u2014each of them\u2014an existence (as\nsubstances), independently of the others, and yet as united in one\nwhole.\n\u00a7 8\nIn the transcendental philosophy of the ancients there exists one more\nleading division, which contains pure conceptions of the understanding,\nand which, although not numbered among the categories, ought, according\nto them, as conceptions \u00e0 priori, to be valid of objects. But in this\ncase they would augment the number of the categories; which cannot be.\nThese are set forth in the proposition, so renowned among the\nschoolmen\u2014\u2018_Quodlibet ens est UNUM, VERUM, BONUM_.\u2019 Now, though the\ninferences from this principle were mere tautological propositions, and\nthough it is allowed only by courtesy to retain a place in modern\nmetaphysics, yet a thought which maintained itself for such a length of\ntime, however empty it seems to be, deserves an investigation of its\norigin, and justifies the conjecture that it must be grounded in some\nlaw of the understanding, which, as is often the case, has only been\nerroneously interpreted. These pretended transcendental predicates are,\nin fact, nothing but logical requisites and criteria of all cognition\nof objects, and they employ, as the basis for this cognition, the\ncategories of quantity, namely, unity, plurality, and totality. But\nthese, which must be taken as material conditions, that is, as\nbelonging to the possibility of things themselves, they employed merely\nin a formal signification, as belonging to the logical requisites of\nall cognition, and yet most unguardedly changed these criteria of\nthought into properties of objects, as things in themselves. Now, in\nevery cognition of an object, there is unity of conception, which may\nbe called qualitative unity, so far as by this term we understand only\nthe unity in our connection of the manifold; for example, unity of the\ntheme in a play, an oration, or a story. Secondly, there is truth in\nrespect of the deductions from it. The more true deductions we have\nfrom a given conception, the more criteria of its objective reality.\nThis we might call the qualitative plurality of characteristic marks,\nwhich belong to a conception as to a common foundation, but are not\ncogitated as a quantity in it. Thirdly, there is perfection\u2014which\nconsists in this, that the plurality falls back upon the unity of the\nconception, and accords completely with that conception and with no\nother. This we may denominate qualitative completeness. Hence it is\nevident that these logical criteria of the possibility of cognition are\nmerely the three categories of quantity modified and transformed to\nsuit an unauthorized manner of applying them. That is to say, the three\ncategories, in which the unity in the production of the quantum must be\nhomogeneous throughout, are transformed solely with a view to the\nconnection of heterogeneous parts of cognition in one act of\nconsciousness, by means of the quality of the cognition, which is the\nprinciple of that connection. Thus the criterion of the possibility of\na conception (not of its object) is the definition of it, in which the\nunity of the conception, the truth of all that may be immediately\ndeduced from it, and finally, the completeness of what has been thus\ndeduced, constitute the requisites for the reproduction of the whole\nconception. Thus also, the criterion or test of an hypothesis is the\nintelligibility of the received principle of explanation, or its unity\n(without help from any subsidiary hypothesis)\u2014the truth of our\ndeductions from it (consistency with each other and with\nexperience)\u2014and lastly, the completeness of the principle of the\nexplanation of these deductions, which refer to neither more nor less\nthan what was admitted in the hypothesis, restoring analytically and \u00e0\nposteriori, what was cogitated synthetically and \u00e0 priori. By the\nconceptions, therefore, of unity, truth, and perfection, we have made\nno addition to the transcendental table of the categories, which is\ncomplete without them. We have, on the contrary, merely employed the\nthree categories of quantity, setting aside their application to\nobjects of experience, as general logical laws of the consistency of\ncognition with itself.\nChapter II. Of the Deduction of the Pure Conceptions of the\nUnderstanding\nSection I. Of the Principles of a Transcendental Deduction in general \u00a7\n9\nTeachers of jurisprudence, when speaking of rights and claims,\ndistinguish in a cause the question of right (quid juris) from the\nquestion of fact (quid facti), and while they demand proof of both,\nthey give to the proof of the former, which goes to establish right or\nclaim in law, the name of deduction. Now we make use of a great number\nof empirical conceptions, without opposition from any one; and consider\nourselves, even without any attempt at deduction, justified in\nattaching to them a sense, and a supposititious signification, because\nwe have always experience at hand to demonstrate their objective\nreality. There exist also, however, usurped conceptions, such as\nfortune, fate, which circulate with almost universal indulgence, and\nyet are occasionally challenged by the question, \u201cquid juris?\u201d In such\ncases, we have great difficulty in discovering any deduction for these\nterms, inasmuch as we cannot produce any manifest ground of right,\neither from experience or from reason, on which the claim to employ\nthem can be founded.\nAmong the many conceptions, which make up the very variegated web of\nhuman cognition, some are destined for pure use \u00e0 priori, independent\nof all experience; and their title to be so employed always requires a\ndeduction, inasmuch as, to justify such use of them, proofs from\nexperience are not sufficient; but it is necessary to know how these\nconceptions can apply to objects without being derived from experience.\nI term, therefore, an examination of the manner in which conceptions\ncan apply \u00e0 priori to objects, the transcendental deduction of\nconceptions, and I distinguish it from the empirical deduction, which\nindicates the mode in which conception is obtained through experience\nand reflection thereon; consequently, does not concern itself with the\nright, but only with the fact of our obtaining conceptions in such and\nsuch a manner. We have already seen that we are in possession of two\nperfectly different kinds of conceptions, which nevertheless agree with\neach other in this, that they both apply to objects completely \u00e0\npriori. These are the conceptions of space and time as forms of\nsensibility, and the categories as pure conceptions of the\nunderstanding. To attempt an empirical deduction of either of these\nclasses would be labour in vain, because the distinguishing\ncharacteristic of their nature consists in this, that they apply to\ntheir objects, without having borrowed anything from experience towards\nthe representation of them. Consequently, if a deduction of these\nconceptions is necessary, it must always be transcendental.\nMeanwhile, with respect to these conceptions, as with respect to all\nour cognition, we certainly may discover in experience, if not the\nprinciple of their possibility, yet the occasioning causes of their\nproduction. It will be found that the impressions of sense give the\nfirst occasion for bringing into action the whole faculty of cognition,\nand for the production of experience, which contains two very\ndissimilar elements, namely, a matter for cognition, given by the\nsenses, and a certain form for the arrangement of this matter, arising\nout of the inner fountain of pure intuition and thought; and these, on\noccasion given by sensuous impressions, are called into exercise and\nproduce conceptions. Such an investigation into the first efforts of\nour faculty of cognition to mount from particular perceptions to\ngeneral conceptions is undoubtedly of great utility; and we have to\nthank the celebrated Locke for having first opened the way for this\ninquiry. But a deduction of the pure \u00e0 priori conceptions of course\nnever can be made in this way, seeing that, in regard to their future\nemployment, which must be entirely independent of experience, they must\nhave a far different certificate of birth to show from that of a\ndescent from experience. This attempted physiological derivation, which\ncannot properly be called deduction, because it relates merely to a\nquaestio facti, I shall entitle an explanation of the possession of a\npure cognition. It is therefore manifest that there can only be a\ntranscendental deduction of these conceptions and by no means an\nempirical one; also, that all attempts at an empirical deduction, in\nregard to pure \u00e0 priori conceptions, are vain, and can only be made by\none who does not understand the altogether peculiar nature of these\ncognitions.\nBut although it is admitted that the only possible deduction of pure \u00e0\npriori cognition is a transcendental deduction, it is not, for that\nreason, perfectly manifest that such a deduction is absolutely\nnecessary. We have already traced to their sources the conceptions of\nspace and time, by means of a transcendental deduction, and we have\nexplained and determined their objective validity \u00e0 priori. Geometry,\nnevertheless, advances steadily and securely in the province of pure \u00e0\npriori cognitions, without needing to ask from philosophy any\ncertificate as to the pure and legitimate origin of its fundamental\nconception of space. But the use of the conception in this science\nextends only to the external world of sense, the pure form of the\nintuition of which is space; and in this world, therefore, all\ngeometrical cognition, because it is founded upon \u00e0 priori intuition,\npossesses immediate evidence, and the objects of this cognition are\ngiven \u00e0 priori (as regards their form) in intuition by and through the\ncognition itself. With the pure conceptions of understanding, on the\ncontrary, commences the absolute necessity of seeking a transcendental\ndeduction, not only of these conceptions themselves, but likewise of\nspace, because, inasmuch as they make affirmations concerning objects\nnot by means of the predicates of intuition and sensibility, but of\npure thought \u00e0 priori, they apply to objects without any of the\nconditions of sensibility. Besides, not being founded on experience,\nthey are not presented with any object in \u00e0 priori intuition upon\nwhich, antecedently to experience, they might base their synthesis.\nHence results, not only doubt as to the objective validity and proper\nlimits of their use, but that even our conception of space is rendered\nequivocal; inasmuch as we are very ready with the aid of the\ncategories, to carry the use of this conception beyond the conditions\nof sensuous intuition\u2014and, for this reason, we have already found a\ntranscendental deduction of it needful. The reader, then, must be quite\nconvinced of the absolute necessity of a transcendental deduction,\nbefore taking a single step in the field of pure reason; because\notherwise he goes to work blindly, and after he has wondered about in\nall directions, returns to the state of utter ignorance from which he\nstarted. He ought, moreover, clearly to recognize beforehand the\nunavoidable difficulties in his undertaking, so that he may not\nafterwards complain of the obscurity in which the subject itself is\ndeeply involved, or become too soon impatient of the obstacles in his\npath; because we have a choice of only two things\u2014either at once to\ngive up all pretensions to knowledge beyond the limits of possible\nexperience, or to bring this critical investigation to completion.\nWe have been able, with very little trouble, to make it comprehensible\nhow the conceptions of space and time, although \u00e0 priori cognitions,\nmust necessarily apply to external objects, and render a synthetical\ncognition of these possible, independently of all experience. For\ninasmuch as only by means of such pure form of sensibility an object\ncan appear to us, that is, be an object of empirical intuition, space\nand time are pure intuitions, which contain \u00e0 priori the condition of\nthe possibility of objects as phenomena, and an \u00e0 priori synthesis in\nthese intuitions possesses objective validity.\nOn the other hand, the categories of the understanding do not represent\nthe conditions under which objects are given to us in intuition;\nobjects can consequently appear to us without necessarily connecting\nthemselves with these, and consequently without any necessity binding\non the understanding to contain \u00e0 priori the conditions of these\nobjects. Thus we find ourselves involved in a difficulty which did not\npresent itself in the sphere of sensibility, that is to say, we cannot\ndiscover how the subjective conditions of thought can have objective\nvalidity, in other words, can become conditions of the possibility of\nall cognition of objects; for phenomena may certainly be given to us in\nintuition without any help from the functions of the understanding. Let\nus take, for example, the conception of cause, which indicates a\npeculiar kind of synthesis, namely, that with something, A, something\nentirely different, B, is connected according to a law. It is not \u00e0\npriori manifest why phenomena should contain anything of this kind (we\nare of course debarred from appealing for proof to experience, for the\nobjective validity of this conception must be demonstrated \u00e0 priori),\nand it hence remains doubtful \u00e0 priori, whether such a conception be\nnot quite void and without any corresponding object among phenomena.\nFor that objects of sensuous intuition must correspond to the formal\nconditions of sensibility existing \u00e0 priori in the mind is quite\nevident, from the fact that without these they could not be objects for\nus; but that they must also correspond to the conditions which\nunderstanding requires for the synthetical unity of thought is an\nassertion, the grounds for which are not so easily to be discovered.\nFor phenomena might be so constituted as not to correspond to the\nconditions of the unity of thought; and all things might lie in such\nconfusion that, for example, nothing could be met with in the sphere of\nphenomena to suggest a law of synthesis, and so correspond to the\nconception of cause and effect; so that this conception would be quite\nvoid, null, and without significance. Phenomena would nevertheless\ncontinue to present objects to our intuition; for mere intuition does\nnot in any respect stand in need of the functions of thought.\nIf we thought to free ourselves from the labour of these investigations\nby saying: \u201cExperience is constantly offering us examples of the\nrelation of cause and effect in phenomena, and presents us with\nabundant opportunity of abstracting the conception of cause, and so at\nthe same time of corroborating the objective validity of this\nconception\u201d; we should in this case be overlooking the fact, that the\nconception of cause cannot arise in this way at all; that, on the\ncontrary, it must either have an \u00e0 priori basis in the understanding,\nor be rejected as a mere chimera. For this conception demands that\nsomething, A, should be of such a nature that something else, B, should\nfollow from it necessarily, and according to an absolutely universal\nlaw. We may certainly collect from phenomena a law, according to which\nthis or that usually happens, but the element of necessity is not to be\nfound in it. Hence it is evident that to the synthesis of cause and\neffect belongs a dignity, which is utterly wanting in any empirical\nsynthesis; for it is no mere mechanical synthesis, by means of\naddition, but a dynamical one; that is to say, the effect is not to be\ncogitated as merely annexed to the cause, but as posited by and through\nthe cause, and resulting from it. The strict universality of this law\nnever can be a characteristic of empirical laws, which obtain through\ninduction only a comparative universality, that is, an extended range\nof practical application. But the pure conceptions of the understanding\nwould entirely lose all their peculiar character, if we treated them\nmerely as the productions of experience.\nTransition to the Transcendental Deduction of the Categories \u00a7 10\nThere are only two possible ways in which synthetical representation\nand its objects can coincide with and relate necessarily to each other,\nand, as it were, meet together. Either the object alone makes the\nrepresentation possible, or the representation alone makes the object\npossible. In the former case, the relation between them is only\nempirical, and an \u00e0 priori representation is impossible. And this is\nthe case with phenomena, as regards that in them which is referable to\nmere sensation. In the latter case\u2014although representation alone (for\nof its causality, by means of the will, we do not here speak) does not\nproduce the object as to its existence, it must nevertheless be \u00e0\npriori determinative in regard to the object, if it is only by means of\nthe representation that we can cognize anything as an object. Now there\nare only two conditions of the possibility of a cognition of objects;\nfirstly, intuition, by means of which the object, though only as\nphenomenon, is given; secondly, conception, by means of which the\nobject which corresponds to this intuition is thought. But it is\nevident from what has been said on \u00e6sthetic that the first condition,\nunder which alone objects can be intuited, must in fact exist, as a\nformal basis for them, \u00e0 priori in the mind. With this formal condition\nof sensibility, therefore, all phenomena necessarily correspond,\nbecause it is only through it that they can be phenomena at all; that\nis, can be empirically intuited and given. Now the question is whether\nthere do not exist, \u00e0 priori in the mind, conceptions of understanding\nalso, as conditions under which alone something, if not intuited, is\nyet thought as object. If this question be answered in the affirmative,\nit follows that all empirical cognition of objects is necessarily\nconformable to such conceptions, since, if they are not presupposed, it\nis impossible that anything can be an object of experience. Now all\nexperience contains, besides the intuition of the senses through which\nan object is given, a conception also of an object that is given in\nintuition. Accordingly, conceptions of objects in general must lie as \u00e0\npriori conditions at the foundation of all empirical cognition; and\nconsequently, the objective validity of the categories, as \u00e0 priori\nconceptions, will rest upon this, that experience (as far as regards\nthe form of thought) is possible only by their means. For in that case\nthey apply necessarily and \u00e0 priori to objects of experience, because\nonly through them can an object of experience be thought.\nThe whole aim of the transcendental deduction of all \u00e0 priori\nconceptions is to show that these conceptions are \u00e0 priori conditions\nof the possibility of all experience. Conceptions which afford us the\nobjective foundation of the possibility of experience are for that very\nreason necessary. But the analysis of the experiences in which they are\nmet with is not deduction, but only an illustration of them, because\nfrom experience they could never derive the attribute of necessity.\nWithout their original applicability and relation to all possible\nexperience, in which all objects of cognition present themselves, the\nrelation of the categories to objects, of whatever nature, would be\nquite incomprehensible.\nThe celebrated Locke, for want of due reflection on these points, and\nbecause he met with pure conceptions of the understanding in\nexperience, sought also to deduce them from experience, and yet\nproceeded so inconsequently as to attempt, with their aid, to arrive it\ncognitions which lie far beyond the limits of all experience. David\nHume perceived that, to render this possible, it was necessary that the\nconceptions should have an \u00e0 priori origin. But as he could not explain\nhow it was possible that conceptions which are not connected with each\nother in the understanding must nevertheless be thought as necessarily\nconnected in the object\u2014and it never occurred to him that the\nunderstanding itself might, perhaps, by means of these conceptions, be\nthe author of the experience in which its objects were presented to\nit\u2014he was forced to drive these conceptions from experience, that is,\nfrom a subjective necessity arising from repeated association of\nexperiences erroneously considered to be objective\u2014in one word, from\nhabit. But he proceeded with perfect consequence and declared it to be\nimpossible, with such conceptions and the principles arising from them,\nto overstep the limits of experience. The empirical derivation,\nhowever, which both of these philosophers attributed to these\nconceptions, cannot possibly be reconciled with the fact that we do\npossess scientific \u00e0 priori cognitions, namely, those of pure\nmathematics and general physics.\nThe former of these two celebrated men opened a wide door to\nextravagance\u2014(for if reason has once undoubted right on its side, it\nwill not allow itself to be confined to set limits, by vague\nrecommendations of moderation); the latter gave himself up entirely to\nscepticism\u2014a natural consequence, after having discovered, as he\nthought, that the faculty of cognition was not trustworthy. We now\nintend to make a trial whether it be not possible safely to conduct\nreason between these two rocks, to assign her determinate limits, and\nyet leave open for her the entire sphere of her legitimate activity.\nI shall merely premise an explanation of what the categories are. They\nare conceptions of an object in general, by means of which its\nintuition is contemplated as determined in relation to one of the\nlogical functions of judgement. The following will make this plain. The\nfunction of the categorical judgement is that of the relation of\nsubject to predicate; for example, in the proposition: \u201cAll bodies are\ndivisible.\u201d But in regard to the merely logical use of the\nunderstanding, it still remains undetermined to which Of these two\nconceptions belongs the function Of subject and to which that of\npredicate. For we could also say: \u201cSome divisible is a body.\u201d But the\ncategory of substance, when the conception of a body is brought under\nit, determines that; and its empirical intuition in experience must be\ncontemplated always as subject and never as mere predicate. And so with\nall the other categories.\nSection II Transcendental Deduction of the pure Conceptions of the\nUnderstanding\nOf the Possibility of a Conjunction of the manifold representations\ngiven by Sense \u00a7 11.\nThe manifold content in our representations can be given in an\nintuition which is merely sensuous\u2014in other words, is nothing but\nsusceptibility; and the form of this intuition can exist \u00e0 priori in\nour faculty of representation, without being anything else but the mode\nin which the subject is affected. But the conjunction (conjunctio) of a\nmanifold in intuition never can be given us by the senses; it cannot\ntherefore be contained in the pure form of sensuous intuition, for it\nis a spontaneous act of the faculty of representation. And as we must,\nto distinguish it from sensibility, entitle this faculty understanding;\nso all conjunction whether conscious or unconscious, be it of the\nmanifold in intuition, sensuous or non-sensuous, or of several\nconceptions\u2014is an act of the understanding. To this act we shall give\nthe general appellation of synthesis, thereby to indicate, at the same\ntime, that we cannot represent anything as conjoined in the object\nwithout having previously conjoined it ourselves. Of all mental\nnotions, that of conjunction is the only one which cannot be given\nthrough objects, but can be originated only by the subject itself,\nbecause it is an act of its purely spontaneous activity. The reader\nwill easily enough perceive that the possibility of conjunction must be\ngrounded in the very nature of this act, and that it must be equally\nvalid for all conjunction, and that analysis, which appears to be its\ncontrary, must, nevertheless, always presuppose it; for where the\nunderstanding has not previously conjoined, it cannot dissect or\nanalyse, because only as conjoined by it, must that which is to be\nanalysed have been given to our faculty of representation.\nBut the conception of conjunction includes, besides the conception of\nthe manifold and of the synthesis of it, that of the unity of it also.\nConjunction is the representation of the synthetical unity of the\nmanifold.[15] This idea of unity, therefore, cannot arise out of that\nof conjunction; much rather does that idea, by combining itself with\nthe representation of the manifold, render the conception of\nconjunction possible. This unity, which \u00e0 priori precedes all\nconceptions of conjunction, is not the category of unity (\u00a7 6); for all\nthe categories are based upon logical functions of judgement, and in\nthese functions we already have conjunction, and consequently unity of\ngiven conceptions. It is therefore evident that the category of unity\npresupposes conjunction. We must therefore look still higher for this\nunity (as qualitative, \u00a7 8), in that, namely, which contains the ground\nof the unity of diverse conceptions in judgements, the ground,\nconsequently, of the possibility of the existence of the understanding,\neven in regard to its logical use.\n[15] Whether the representations are in themselves identical, and\nconsequently whether one can be thought analytically by means of and\nthrough the other, is a question which we need not at present\nconsider. Our Consciousness of the one, when we speak of the manifold,\nis always distinguishable from our consciousness of the other; and it\nis only respecting the synthesis of this (possible) consciousness that\nwe here treat.\nOf the Originally Synthetical Unity of Apperception \u00a7 12\nThe \u201cI think\u201d must accompany all my representations, for otherwise\nsomething would be represented in me which could not be thought; in\nother words, the representation would either be impossible, or at least\nbe, in relation to me, nothing. That representation which can be given\npreviously to all thought is called intuition. All the diversity or\nmanifold content of intuition, has, therefore, a necessary relation to\nthe \u201cI think,\u201d in the subject in which this diversity is found. But\nthis representation, \u201cI think,\u201d is an act of spontaneity; that is to\nsay, it cannot be regarded as belonging to mere sensibility. I call it\npure apperception, in order to distinguish it from empirical; or\nprimitive apperception, because it is self-consciousness which, whilst\nit gives birth to the representation \u201cI think,\u201d must necessarily be\ncapable of accompanying all our representations. It is in all acts of\nconsciousness one and the same, and unaccompanied by it, no\nrepresentation can exist for me. The unity of this apperception I call\nthe transcendental unity of self-consciousness, in order to indicate\nthe possibility of \u00e0 priori cognition arising from it. For the manifold\nrepresentations which are given in an intuition would not all of them\nbe my representations, if they did not all belong to one\nself-consciousness, that is, as my representations (even although I am\nnot conscious of them as such), they must conform to the condition\nunder which alone they can exist together in a common\nself-consciousness, because otherwise they would not all without\nexception belong to me. From this primitive conjunction follow many\nimportant results.\nFor example, this universal identity of the apperception of the\nmanifold given in intuition contains a synthesis of representations and\nis possible only by means of the consciousness of this synthesis. For\nthe empirical consciousness which accompanies different representations\nis in itself fragmentary and disunited, and without relation to the\nidentity of the subject. This relation, then, does not exist because I\naccompany every representation with consciousness, but because I join\none representation to another, and am conscious of the synthesis of\nthem. Consequently, only because I can connect a variety of given\nrepresentations in one consciousness, is it possible that I can\nrepresent to myself the identity of consciousness in these\nrepresentations; in other words, the analytical unity of apperception\nis possible only under the presupposition of a synthetical unity.[16]\nThe thought, \u201cThese representations given in intuition belong all of\nthem to me,\u201d is accordingly just the same as, \u201cI unite them in one\nself-consciousness, or can at least so unite them\u201d; and although this\nthought is not itself the consciousness of the synthesis of\nrepresentations, it presupposes the possibility of it; that is to say,\nfor the reason alone that I can comprehend the variety of my\nrepresentations in one consciousness, do I call them my\nrepresentations, for otherwise I must have as many-coloured and various\na self as are the representations of which I am conscious. Synthetical\nunity of the manifold in intuitions, as given \u00e0 priori, is therefore\nthe foundation of the identity of apperception itself, which antecedes\n\u00e0 priori all determinate thought. But the conjunction of\nrepresentations into a conception is not to be found in objects\nthemselves, nor can it be, as it were, borrowed from them and taken up\ninto the understanding by perception, but it is on the contrary an\noperation of the understanding itself, which is nothing more than the\nfaculty of conjoining \u00e0 priori and of bringing the variety of given\nrepresentations under the unity of apperception. This principle is the\nhighest in all human cognition.\n[16] All general conceptions\u2014as such\u2014depend, for their existence, on\nthe analytical unity of consciousness. For example, when I think of\nred in general, I thereby think to myself a property which (as a\ncharacteristic mark) can be discovered somewhere, or can be united\nwith other representations; consequently, it is only by means of a\nforethought possible synthetical unity that I can think to myself the\nanalytical. A representation which is cogitated as common to different\nrepresentations, is regarded as belonging to such as, besides this\ncommon representation, contain something different; consequently it\nmust be previously thought in synthetical unity with other although\nonly possible representations, before I can think in it the analytical\nunity of consciousness which makes it a conceptas communis. And thus\nthe synthetical unity of apperception is the highest point with which\nwe must connect every operation of the understanding, even the whole\nof logic, and after it our transcendental philosophy; indeed, this\nfaculty is the understanding itself.\nThis fundamental principle of the necessary unity of apperception is\nindeed an identical, and therefore analytical, proposition; but it\nnevertheless explains the necessity for a synthesis of the manifold\ngiven in an intuition, without which the identity of self-consciousness\nwould be incogitable. For the ego, as a simple representation, presents\nus with no manifold content; only in intuition, which is quite\ndifferent from the representation ego, can it be given us, and by means\nof conjunction it is cogitated in one self-consciousness. An\nunderstanding, in which all the manifold should be given by means of\nconsciousness itself, would be intuitive; our understanding can only\nthink and must look for its intuition to sense. I am, therefore,\nconscious of my identical self, in relation to all the variety of\nrepresentations given to me in an intuition, because I call all of them\nmy representations. In other words, I am conscious myself of a\nnecessary \u00e0 priori synthesis of my representations, which is called the\noriginal synthetical unity of apperception, under which rank all the\nrepresentations presented to me, but that only by means of a synthesis.\nThe Principle of the Synthetical Unity of Apperception is the highest\nPrinciple of all exercise of the Understanding \u00a7 13\nThe supreme principle of the possibility of all intuition in relation\nto sensibility was, according to our transcendental \u00e6sthetic, that all\nthe manifold in intuition be subject to the formal conditions of space\nand time. The supreme principle of the possibility of it in relation to\nthe understanding is that all the manifold in it be subject to\nconditions of the originally synthetical unity or apperception.[17] To\nthe former of these two principles are subject all the various\nrepresentations of intuition, in so far as they are given to us; to the\nlatter, in so far as they must be capable of conjunction in one\nconsciousness; for without this nothing can be thought or cognized,\nbecause the given representations would not have in common the act Of\nthe apperception \u201cI think\u201d and therefore could not be connected in one\nself-consciousness.\n[17] Space and time, and all portions thereof, are intuitions;\nconsequently are, with a manifold for their content, single\nrepresentations. (See the Transcendental \u00c6sthetic.) Consequently, they\nare not pure conceptions, by means of which the same consciousness is\nfound in a great number of representations; but, on the contrary, they\nare many representations contained in one, the consciousness of which\nis, so to speak, compounded. The unity of consciousness is\nnevertheless synthetical and, therefore, primitive. From this peculiar\ncharacter of consciousness follow many important consequences. (See \u00a7\n21.)\nUnderstanding is, to speak generally, the faculty Of cognitions. These\nconsist in the determined relation of given representation to an\nobject. But an object is that, in the conception of which the manifold\nin a given intuition is united. Now all union of representations\nrequires unity of consciousness in the synthesis of them. Consequently,\nit is the unity of consciousness alone that constitutes the possibility\nof representations relating to an object, and therefore of their\nobjective validity, and of their becoming cognitions, and consequently,\nthe possibility of the existence of the understanding itself.\nThe first pure cognition of understanding, then, upon which is founded\nall its other exercise, and which is at the same time perfectly\nindependent of all conditions of mere sensuous intuition, is the\nprinciple of the original synthetical unity of apperception. Thus the\nmere form of external sensuous intuition, namely, space, affords us,\nper se, no cognition; it merely contributes the manifold in \u00e0 priori\nintuition to a possible cognition. But, in order to cognize something\nin space (for example, a line), I must draw it, and thus produce\nsynthetically a determined conjunction of the given manifold, so that\nthe unity of this act is at the same time the unity of consciousness\n(in the conception of a line), and by this means alone is an object (a\ndeterminate space) cognized. The synthetical unity of consciousness is,\ntherefore, an objective condition of all cognition, which I do not\nmerely require in order to cognize an object, but to which every\nintuition must necessarily be subject, in order to become an object for\nme; because in any other way, and without this synthesis, the manifold\nin intuition could not be united in one consciousness.\nThis proposition is, as already said, itself analytical, although it\nconstitutes the synthetical unity, the condition of all thought; for it\nstates nothing more than that all my representations in any given\nintuition must be subject to the condition which alone enables me to\nconnect them, as my representation with the identical self, and so to\nunite them synthetically in one apperception, by means of the general\nexpression, \u201cI think.\u201d\nBut this principle is not to be regarded as a principle for every\npossible understanding, but only for the understanding by means of\nwhose pure apperception in the thought I am, no manifold content is\ngiven. The understanding or mind which contained the manifold in\nintuition, in and through the act itself of its own self-consciousness,\nin other words, an understanding by and in the representation of which\nthe objects of the representation should at the same time exist, would\nnot require a special act of synthesis of the manifold as the condition\nof the unity of its consciousness, an act of which the human\nunderstanding, which thinks only and cannot intuite, has absolute need.\nBut this principle is the first principle of all the operations of our\nunderstanding, so that we cannot form the least conception of any other\npossible understanding, either of one such as should be itself\nintuition, or possess a sensuous intuition, but with forms different\nfrom those of space and time.\nWhat Objective Unity of Self-consciousness is \u00a7 14\nIt is by means of the transcendental unity of apperception that all the\nmanifold, given in an intuition is united into a conception of the\nobject. On this account it is called objective, and must be\ndistinguished from the subjective unity of consciousness, which is a\ndetermination of the internal sense, by means of which the said\nmanifold in intuition is given empirically to be so united. Whether I\ncan be empirically conscious of the manifold as coexistent or as\nsuccessive, depends upon circumstances, or empirical conditions. Hence\nthe empirical unity of consciousness by means of association of\nrepresentations, itself relates to a phenomenal world and is wholly\ncontingent. On the contrary, the pure form of intuition in time, merely\nas an intuition, which contains a given manifold, is subject to the\noriginal unity of consciousness, and that solely by means of the\nnecessary relation of the manifold in intuition to the \u201cI think,\u201d\nconsequently by means of the pure synthesis of the understanding, which\nlies \u00e0 priori at the foundation of all empirical synthesis. The\ntranscendental unity of apperception is alone objectively valid; the\nempirical which we do not consider in this essay, and which is merely a\nunity deduced from the former under given conditions in concreto,\npossesses only subjective validity. One person connects the notion\nconveyed in a word with one thing, another with another thing; and the\nunity of consciousness in that which is empirical, is, in relation to\nthat which is given by experience, not necessarily and universally\nvalid.\nThe Logical Form of all Judgements consists in the Objective Unity of\nApperception of the Conceptions contained therein \u00a7 15\nI could never satisfy myself with the definition which logicians give\nof a judgement. It is, according to them, the representation of a\nrelation between two conceptions. I shall not dwell here on the\nfaultiness of this definition, in that it suits only for categorical\nand not for hypothetical or disjunctive judgements, these latter\ncontaining a relation not of conceptions but of judgements themselves\u2014a\nblunder from which many evil results have followed.[18] It is more\nimportant for our present purpose to observe, that this definition does\nnot determine in what the said relation consists.\n[18] The tedious doctrine of the four syllogistic figures concerns\nonly categorical syllogisms; and although it is nothing more than\nan artifice by surreptitiously introducing immediate conclusions\n(consequentiae immediatae) among the premises of a pure syllogism,\nto give rise to an appearance of more modes of drawing a conclusion\nthan that in the first figure, the artifice would not have had much\nsuccess, had not its authors succeeded in bringing categorical\njudgements into exclusive respect, as those to which all others must\nbe referred\u2014a doctrine, however, which, according to \u00a7 5, is utterly\nfalse.\nBut if I investigate more closely the relation of given cognitions in\nevery judgement, and distinguish it, as belonging to the understanding,\nfrom the relation which is produced according to laws of the\nreproductive imagination (which has only subjective validity), I find\nthat judgement is nothing but the mode of bringing given cognitions\nunder the objective unit of apperception. This is plain from our use of\nthe term of relation is in judgements, in order to distinguish the\nobjective unity of given representations from the subjective unity. For\nthis term indicates the relation of these representations to the\noriginal apperception, and also their necessary unity, even although\nthe judgement is empirical, therefore contingent, as in the judgement:\n\u201cAll bodies are heavy.\u201d I do not mean by this, that these\nrepresentations do necessarily belong to each other in empirical\nintuition, but that by means of the necessary unity of appreciation\nthey belong to each other in the synthesis of intuitions, that is to\nsay, they belong to each other according to principles of the objective\ndetermination of all our representations, in so far as cognition can\narise from them, these principles being all deduced from the main\nprinciple of the transcendental unity of apperception. In this way\nalone can there arise from this relation a judgement, that is, a\nrelation which has objective validity, and is perfectly distinct from\nthat relation of the very same representations which has only\nsubjective validity\u2014a relation, to wit, which is produced according to\nlaws of association. According to these laws, I could only say: \u201cWhen I\nhold in my hand or carry a body, I feel an impression of weight\u201d; but I\ncould not say: \u201cIt, the body, is heavy\u201d; for this is tantamount to\nsaying both these representations are conjoined in the object, that is,\nwithout distinction as to the condition of the subject, and do not\nmerely stand together in my perception, however frequently the\nperceptive act may be repeated.\nAll Sensuous Intuitions are subject to the Categories, as Conditions\nunder which alone the manifold Content of them can be united in one\nConsciousness \u00a7 16\nThe manifold content given in a sensuous intuition comes necessarily\nunder the original synthetical unity of apperception, because thereby\nalone is the unity of intuition possible (\u00a7 13). But that act of the\nunderstanding, by which the manifold content of given representations\n(whether intuitions or conceptions) is brought under one apperception,\nis the logical function of judgements (\u00a7 15). All the manifold,\ntherefore, in so far as it is given in one empirical intuition, is\ndetermined in relation to one of the logical functions of judgement, by\nmeans of which it is brought into union in one consciousness. Now the\ncategories are nothing else than these functions of judgement so far as\nthe manifold in a given intuition is determined in relation to them (\u00a7\n9). Consequently, the manifold in a given intuition is necessarily\nsubject to the categories of the understanding.\nObservation \u00a7 17\nThe manifold in an intuition, which I call mine, is represented by\nmeans of the synthesis of the understanding, as belonging to the\nnecessary unity of self-consciousness, and this takes place by means of\nthe category.[19] The category indicates accordingly that the empirical\nconsciousness of a given manifold in an intuition is subject to a pure\nself-consciousness \u00e0 priori, in the same manner as an empirical\nintuition is subject to a pure sensuous intuition, which is also \u00e0\npriori. In the above proposition, then, lies the beginning of a\ndeduction of the pure conceptions of the understanding. Now, as the\ncategories have their origin in the understanding alone, independently\nof sensibility, I must in my deduction make abstraction of the mode in\nwhich the manifold of an empirical intuition is given, in order to fix\nmy attention exclusively on the unity which is brought by the\nunderstanding into the intuition by means of the category. In what\nfollows (\u00a7 22), it will be shown, from the mode in which the empirical\nintuition is given in the faculty of sensibility, that the unity which\nbelongs to it is no other than that which the category (according to \u00a7\n16) imposes on the manifold in a given intuition, and thus, its \u00e0\npriori validity in regard to all objects of sense being established,\nthe purpose of our deduction will be fully attained.\n[19] The proof of this rests on the represented unity of intuition, by\nmeans of which an object is given, and which always includes in itself\na synthesis of the manifold to be intuited, and also the relation of\nthis latter to unity of apperception.\nBut there is one thing in the above demonstration of which I could not\nmake abstraction, namely, that the manifold to be intuited must be\ngiven previously to the synthesis of the understanding, and\nindependently of it. How this takes place remains here undetermined.\nFor if I cogitate an understanding which was itself intuitive (as, for\nexample, a divine understanding which should not represent given\nobjects, but by whose representation the objects themselves should be\ngiven or produced), the categories would possess no significance in\nrelation to such a faculty of cognition. They are merely rules for an\nunderstanding, whose whole power consists in thought, that is, in the\nact of submitting the synthesis of the manifold which is presented to\nit in intuition from a very different quarter, to the unity of\napperception; a faculty, therefore, which cognizes nothing per se, but\nonly connects and arranges the material of cognition, the intuition,\nnamely, which must be presented to it by means of the object. But to\nshow reasons for this peculiar character of our understandings, that it\nproduces unity of apperception \u00e0 priori only by means of categories,\nand a certain kind and number thereof, is as impossible as to explain\nwhy we are endowed with precisely so many functions of judgement and no\nmore, or why time and space are the only forms of our intuition.\nIn Cognition, its Application to Objects of Experience is the only\nlegitimate use of the Category \u00a7 18\nTo think an object and to cognize an object are by no means the same\nthing. In cognition there are two elements: firstly, the conception,\nwhereby an object is cogitated (the category); and, secondly, the\nintuition, whereby the object is given. For supposing that to the\nconception a corresponding intuition could not be given, it would still\nbe a thought as regards its form, but without any object, and no\ncognition of anything would be possible by means of it, inasmuch as, so\nfar as I knew, there existed and could exist nothing to which my\nthought could be applied. Now all intuition possible to us is sensuous;\nconsequently, our thought of an object by means of a pure conception of\nthe understanding, can become cognition for us only in so far as this\nconception is applied to objects of the senses. Sensuous intuition is\neither pure intuition (space and time) or empirical intuition\u2014of that\nwhich is immediately represented in space and time by means of\nsensation as real. Through the determination of pure intuition we\nobtain \u00e0 priori cognitions of objects, as in mathematics, but only as\nregards their form as phenomena; whether there can exist things which\nmust be intuited in this form is not thereby established. All\nmathematical conceptions, therefore, are not per se cognition, except\nin so far as we presuppose that there exist things which can only be\nrepresented conformably to the form of our pure sensuous intuition. But\nthings in space and time are given only in so far as they are\nperceptions (representations accompanied with sensation), therefore\nonly by empirical representation. Consequently the pure conceptions of\nthe understanding, even when they are applied to intuitions \u00e0 priori\n(as in mathematics), produce cognition only in so far as these (and\ntherefore the conceptions of the understanding by means of them) can be\napplied to empirical intuitions. Consequently the categories do not,\neven by means of pure intuition afford us any cognition of things; they\ncan only do so in so far as they can be applied to empirical intuition.\nThat is to say, the categories serve only to render empirical cognition\npossible. But this is what we call experience. Consequently, in\ncognition, their application to objects of experience is the only\nlegitimate use of the categories.\n\u00a7 19\nThe foregoing proposition is of the utmost importance, for it\ndetermines the limits of the exercise of the pure conceptions of the\nunderstanding in regard to objects, just as transcendental \u00e6sthetic\ndetermined the limits of the exercise of the pure form of our sensuous\nintuition. Space and time, as conditions of the possibility of the\npresentation of objects to us, are valid no further than for objects of\nsense, consequently, only for experience. Beyond these limits they\nrepresent to us nothing, for they belong only to sense, and have no\nreality apart from it. The pure conceptions of the understanding are\nfree from this limitation, and extend to objects of intuition in\ngeneral, be the intuition like or unlike to ours, provided only it be\nsensuous, and not intellectual. But this extension of conceptions\nbeyond the range of our intuition is of no advantage; for they are then\nmere empty conceptions of objects, as to the possibility or\nimpossibility of the existence of which they furnish us with no means\nof discovery. They are mere forms of thought, without objective\nreality, because we have no intuition to which the synthetical unity of\napperception, which alone the categories contain, could be applied, for\nthe purpose of determining an object. Our sensuous and empirical\nintuition can alone give them significance and meaning.\nIf, then, we suppose an object of a non-sensuous intuition to be given\nwe can in that case represent it by all those predicates which are\nimplied in the presupposition that nothing appertaining to sensuous\nintuition belongs to it; for example, that it is not extended, or in\nspace; that its duration is not time; that in it no change (the effect\nof the determinations in time) is to be met with, and so on. But it is\nno proper knowledge if I merely indicate what the intuition of the\nobject is not, without being able to say what is contained in it, for I\nhave not shown the possibility of an object to which my pure conception\nof understanding could be applicable, because I have not been able to\nfurnish any intuition corresponding to it, but am only able to say that\nour intuition is not valid for it. But the most important point is\nthis, that to a something of this kind not one category can be found\napplicable. Take, for example, the conception of substance, that is,\nsomething that can exist as subject, but never as mere predicate; in\nregard to this conception I am quite ignorant whether there can really\nbe anything to correspond to such a determination of thought, if\nempirical intuition did not afford me the occasion for its application.\nBut of this more in the sequel.\nOf the Application of the Categories to Objects of the Senses in\ngeneral \u00a7 20\nThe pure conceptions of the understanding apply to objects of intuition\nin general, through the understanding alone, whether the intuition be\nour own or some other, provided only it be sensuous, but are, for this\nvery reason, mere forms of thought, by means of which alone no\ndetermined object can be cognized. The synthesis or conjunction of the\nmanifold in these conceptions relates, we have said, only to the unity\nof apperception, and is for this reason the ground of the possibility\nof \u00e0 priori cognition, in so far as this cognition is dependent on the\nunderstanding. This synthesis is, therefore, not merely transcendental,\nbut also purely intellectual. But because a certain form of sensuous\nintuition exists in the mind \u00e0 priori which rests on the receptivity of\nthe representative faculty (sensibility), the understanding, as a\nspontaneity, is able to determine the internal sense by means of the\ndiversity of given representations, conformably to the synthetical\nunity of apperception, and thus to cogitate the synthetical unity of\nthe apperception of the manifold of sensuous intuition \u00e0 priori, as the\ncondition to which must necessarily be submitted all objects of human\nintuition. And in this manner the categories as mere forms of thought\nreceive objective reality, that is, application to objects which are\ngiven to us in intuition, but that only as phenomena, for it is only of\nphenomena that we are capable of \u00e0 priori intuition.\nThis synthesis of the manifold of sensuous intuition, which is possible\nand necessary \u00e0 priori, may be called figurative (synthesis speciosa),\nin contradistinction to that which is cogitated in the mere category in\nregard to the manifold of an intuition in general, and is called\nconnection or conjunction of the understanding (synthesis\nintellectualis). Both are transcendental, not merely because they\nthemselves precede \u00e0 priori all experience, but also because they form\nthe basis for the possibility of other cognition \u00e0 priori.\nBut the figurative synthesis, when it has relation only to the\noriginally synthetical unity of apperception, that is to the\ntranscendental unity cogitated in the categories, must, to be\ndistinguished from the purely intellectual conjunction, be entitled the\ntranscendental synthesis of imagination. Imagination is the faculty of\nrepresenting an object even without its presence in intuition. Now, as\nall our intuition is sensuous, imagination, by reason of the subjective\ncondition under which alone it can give a corresponding intuition to\nthe conceptions of the understanding, belongs to sensibility. But in so\nfar as the synthesis of the imagination is an act of spontaneity, which\nis determinative, and not, like sense, merely determinable, and which\nis consequently able to determine sense \u00e0 priori, according to its\nform, conformably to the unity of apperception, in so far is the\nimagination a faculty of determining sensibility \u00e0 priori, and its\nsynthesis of intuitions according to the categories must be the\ntranscendental synthesis of the imagination. It is an operation of the\nunderstanding on sensibility, and the first application of the\nunderstanding to objects of possible intuition, and at the same time\nthe basis for the exercise of the other functions of that faculty. As\nfigurative, it is distinguished from the merely intellectual synthesis,\nwhich is produced by the understanding alone, without the aid of\nimagination. Now, in so far as imagination is spontaneity, I sometimes\ncall it also the productive imagination, and distinguish it from the\nreproductive, the synthesis of which is subject entirely to empirical\nlaws, those of association, namely, and which, therefore, contributes\nnothing to the explanation of the possibility of \u00e0 priori cognition,\nand for this reason belongs not to transcendental philosophy, but to\npsychology.\nWe have now arrived at the proper place for explaining the paradox\nwhich must have struck every one in our exposition of the internal\nsense (\u00a7 6), namely\u2014how this sense represents us to our own\nconsciousness, only as we appear to ourselves, not as we are in\nourselves, because, to wit, we intuite ourselves only as we are\ninwardly affected. Now this appears to be contradictory, inasmuch as we\nthus stand in a passive relation to ourselves; and therefore in the\nsystems of psychology, the internal sense is commonly held to be one\nwith the faculty of apperception, while we, on the contrary, carefully\ndistinguish them.\nThat which determines the internal sense is the understanding, and its\noriginal power of conjoining the manifold of intuition, that is, of\nbringing this under an apperception (upon which rests the possibility\nof the understanding itself). Now, as the human understanding is not in\nitself a faculty of intuition, and is unable to exercise such a power,\nin order to conjoin, as it were, the manifold of its own intuition, the\nsynthesis of understanding is, considered per se, nothing but the unity\nof action, of which, as such, it is self-conscious, even apart from\nsensibility, by which, moreover, it is able to determine our internal\nsense in respect of the manifold which may be presented to it according\nto the form of sensuous intuition. Thus, under the name of a\ntranscendental synthesis of imagination, the understanding exercises an\nactivity upon the passive subject, whose faculty it is; and so we are\nright in saying that the internal sense is affected thereby.\nApperception and its synthetical unity are by no means one and the same\nwith the internal sense. The former, as the source of all our\nsynthetical conjunction, applies, under the name of the categories, to\nthe manifold of intuition in general, prior to all sensuous intuition\nof objects. The internal sense, on the contrary, contains merely the\nform of intuition, but without any synthetical conjunction of the\nmanifold therein, and consequently does not contain any determined\nintuition, which is possible only through consciousness of the\ndetermination of the manifold by the transcendental act of the\nimagination (synthetical influence of the understanding on the internal\nsense), which I have named figurative synthesis.\nThis we can indeed always perceive in ourselves. We cannot cogitate a\ngeometrical line without drawing it in thought, nor a circle without\ndescribing it, nor represent the three dimensions of space without\ndrawing three lines from the same point perpendicular to one another.\nWe cannot even cogitate time, unless, in drawing a straight line (which\nis to serve as the external figurative representation of time), we fix\nour attention on the act of the synthesis of the manifold, whereby we\ndetermine successively the internal sense, and thus attend also to the\nsuccession of this determination. Motion as an act of the subject (not\nas a determination of an object),[20] consequently the synthesis of the\nmanifold in space, if we make abstraction of space and attend merely to\nthe act by which we determine the internal sense according to its form,\nis that which produces the conception of succession. The understanding,\ntherefore, does by no means find in the internal sense any such\nsynthesis of the manifold, but produces it, in that it affects this\nsense. At the same time, how \u201cI who think\u201d is distinct from the \u201ci\u201d\nwhich intuites itself (other modes of intuition being cogitable as at\nleast possible), and yet one and the same with this latter as the same\nsubject; how, therefore, I am able to say: \u201cI, as an intelligence and\nthinking subject, cognize myself as an object thought, so far as I am,\nmoreover, given to myself in intuition\u2014only, like other phenomena, not\nas I am in myself, and as considered by the understanding, but merely\nas I appear\u201d\u2014is a question that has in it neither more nor less\ndifficulty than the question\u2014\u201cHow can I be an object to myself?\u201d or\nthis\u2014\u201cHow I can be an object of my own intuition and internal\nperceptions?\u201d But that such must be the fact, if we admit that space is\nmerely a pure form of the phenomena of external sense, can be clearly\nproved by the consideration that we cannot represent time, which is not\nan object of external intuition, in any other way than under the image\nof a line, which we draw in thought, a mode of representation without\nwhich we could not cognize the unity of its dimension, and also that we\nare necessitated to take our determination of periods of time, or of\npoints of time, for all our internal perceptions from the changes which\nwe perceive in outward things. It follows that we must arrange the\ndeterminations of the internal sense, as phenomena in time, exactly in\nthe same manner as we arrange those of the external senses in space.\nAnd consequently, if we grant, respecting this latter, that by means of\nthem we know objects only in so far as we are affected externally, we\nmust also confess, with regard to the internal sense, that by means of\nit we intuite ourselves only as we are internally affected by\nourselves; in other words, as regards internal intuition, we cognize\nour own subject only as phenomenon, and not as it is in itself.[21]\n[20] Motion of an object in space does not belong to a pure science,\nconsequently not to geometry; because, that a thing is movable cannot\nbe known \u00e0 priori, but only from experience. But motion, considered as\nthe description of a space, is a pure act of the successive synthesis\nof the manifold in external intuition by means of productive\nimagination, and belongs not only to geometry, but even to\ntranscendental philosophy.\n[21] I do not see why so much difficulty should be found in admitting\nthat our internal sense is affected by ourselves. Every act of\nattention exemplifies it. In such an act the understanding determines\nthe internal sense by the synthetical conjunction which it cogitates,\nconformably to the internal intuition which corresponds to the\nmanifold in the synthesis of the understanding. How much the mind is\nusually affected thereby every one will be able to perceive in\nhimself.\n\u00a7 21\nOn the other hand, in the transcendental synthesis of the manifold\ncontent of representations, consequently in the synthetical unity of\napperception, I am conscious of myself, not as I appear to myself, nor\nas I am in myself, but only that \u201cI am.\u201d This representation is a\nthought, not an intuition. Now, as in order to cognize ourselves, in\naddition to the act of thinking, which subjects the manifold of every\npossible intuition to the unity of apperception, there is necessary a\ndeterminate mode of intuition, whereby this manifold is given; although\nmy own existence is certainly not mere phenomenon (much less mere\nillusion), the determination of my existence[22] Can only take place\nconformably to the form of the internal sense, according to the\nparticular mode in which the manifold which I conjoin is given in\ninternal intuition, and I have therefore no knowledge of myself as I\nam, but merely as I appear to myself. The consciousness of self is thus\nvery far from a knowledge of self, in which I do not use the\ncategories, whereby I cogitate an object, by means of the conjunction\nof the manifold in one apperception. In the same way as I require, for\nthe sake of the cognition of an object distinct from myself, not only\nthe thought of an object in general (in the category), but also an\nintuition by which to determine that general conception, in the same\nway do I require, in order to the cognition of myself, not only the\nconsciousness of myself or the thought that I think myself, but in\naddition an intuition of the manifold in myself, by which to determine\nthis thought. It is true that I exist as an intelligence which is\nconscious only of its faculty of conjunction or synthesis, but\nsubjected in relation to the manifold which this intelligence has to\nconjoin to a limitative conjunction called the internal sense. My\nintelligence (that is, I) can render that conjunction or synthesis\nperceptible only according to the relations of time, which are quite\nbeyond the proper sphere of the conceptions of the understanding and\nconsequently cognize itself in respect to an intuition (which cannot\npossibly be intellectual, nor given by the understanding), only as it\nappears to itself, and not as it would cognize itself, if its intuition\nwere intellectual.\n[22] The \u201cI think\u201d expresses the act of determining my own existence.\nMy existence is thus already given by the act of consciousness; but\nthe mode in which I must determine my existence, that is, the mode in\nwhich I must place the manifold belonging to my existence, is not\nthereby given. For this purpose intuition of self is required, and\nthis intuition possesses a form given \u00e0 priori, namely, time, which is\nsensuous, and belongs to our receptivity of the determinable. Now, as\nI do not possess another intuition of self which gives the determining\nin me (of the spontaneity of which I am conscious), prior to the act\nof determination, in the same manner as time gives the determinable,\nit is clear that I am unable to determine my own existence as that of\na spontaneous being, but I am only able to represent to myself the\nspontaneity of my thought, that is, of my determination, and my\nexistence remains ever determinable in a purely sensuous manner, that\nis to say, like the existence of a phenomenon. But it is because of\nthis spontaneity that I call myself an intelligence.\nTranscendental Deduction of the universally possible employment in\nexperience of the Pure Conceptions of the Understanding \u00a7 22\nIn the metaphysical deduction, the \u00e0 priori origin of categories was\nproved by their complete accordance with the general logical of\nthought; in the transcendental deduction was exhibited the possibility\nof the categories as \u00e0 priori cognitions of objects of an intuition in\ngeneral (\u00a7 16 and 17).At present we are about to explain the\npossibility of cognizing, \u00e0 priori, by means of the categories, all\nobjects which can possibly be presented to our senses, not, indeed,\naccording to the form of their intuition, but according to the laws of\ntheir conjunction or synthesis, and thus, as it were, of prescribing\nlaws to nature and even of rendering nature possible. For if the\ncategories were inadequate to this task, it would not be evident to us\nwhy everything that is presented to our senses must be subject to those\nlaws which have an \u00e0 priori origin in the understanding itself.\nI premise that by the term synthesis of apprehension I understand the\ncombination of the manifold in an empirical intuition, whereby\nperception, that is, empirical consciousness of the intuition (as\nphenomenon), is possible.\nWe have \u00e0 priori forms of the external and internal sensuous intuition\nin the representations of space and time, and to these must the\nsynthesis of apprehension of the manifold in a phenomenon be always\ncomformable, because the synthesis itself can only take place according\nto these forms. But space and time are not merely forms of sensuous\nintuition, but intuitions themselves (which contain a manifold), and\ntherefore contain \u00e0 priori the determination of the unity of this\nmanifold.[23] (See the Transcendent \u00c6sthetic.) Therefore is unity of\nthe synthesis of the manifold without or within us, consequently also a\nconjunction to which all that is to be represented as determined in\nspace or time must correspond, given \u00e0 priori along with (not in) these\nintuitions, as the condition of the synthesis of all apprehension of\nthem. But this synthetical unity can be no other than that of the\nconjunction of the manifold of a given intuition in general, in a\nprimitive act of consciousness, according to the categories, but\napplied to our sensuous intuition. Consequently all synthesis, whereby\nalone is even perception possible, is subject to the categories. And,\nas experience is cognition by means of conjoined perceptions, the\ncategories are conditions of the possibility of experience and are\ntherefore valid \u00e0 priori for all objects of experience.\n[23] Space represented as an object (as geometry really requires it to\nbe) contains more than the mere form of the intuition; namely, a\ncombination of the manifold given according to the form of sensibility\ninto a representation that can be intuited; so that the form of the\nintuition gives us merely the manifold, but the formal intuition gives\nunity of representation. In the \u00e6sthetic, I regarded this unity as\nbelonging entirely to sensibility, for the purpose of indicating that\nit antecedes all conceptions, although it presupposes a synthesis\nwhich does not belong to sense, through which alone, however, all our\nconceptions of space and time are possible. For as by means of this\nunity alone (the understanding determining the sensibility) space and\ntime are given as intuitions, it follows that the unity of this\nintuition \u00e0 priori belongs to space and time, and not to the\nconception of the understanding (\u00a7 20).\nWhen, then, for example, I make the empirical intuition of a house by\napprehension of the manifold contained therein into a perception, the\nnecessary unity of space and of my external sensuous intuition lies at\nthe foundation of this act, and I, as it were, draw the form of the\nhouse conformably to this synthetical unity of the manifold in space.\nBut this very synthetical unity remains, even when I abstract the form\nof space, and has its seat in the understanding, and is in fact the\ncategory of the synthesis of the homogeneous in an intuition; that is\nto say, the category of quantity, to which the aforesaid synthesis of\napprehension, that is, the perception, must be completely\nconformable.[24]\n[24] In this manner it is proved, that the synthesis of apprehension,\nwhich is empirical, must necessarily be conformable to the synthesis\nof apperception, which is intellectual, and contained \u00e0 priori in the\ncategory. It is one and the same spontaneity which at one time, under\nthe name of imagination, at another under that of understanding,\nproduces conjunction in the manifold of intuition.\nTo take another example, when I perceive the freezing of water, I\napprehend two states (fluidity and solidity), which, as such, stand\ntoward each other mutually in a relation of time. But in the time,\nwhich I place as an internal intuition, at the foundation of this\nphenomenon, I represent to myself synthetical unity of the manifold,\nwithout which the aforesaid relation could not be given in an intuition\nas determined (in regard to the succession of time). Now this\nsynthetical unity, as the \u00e0 priori condition under which I conjoin the\nmanifold of an intuition, is, if I make abstraction of the permanent\nform of my internal intuition (that is to say, of time), the category\nof cause, by means of which, when applied to my sensibility, I\ndetermine everything that occurs according to relations of time.\nConsequently apprehension in such an event, and the event itself, as\nfar as regards the possibility of its perception, stands under the\nconception of the relation of cause and effect: and so in all other\ncases.\nCategories are conceptions which prescribe laws \u00e0 priori to phenomena,\nconsequently to nature as the complex of all phenomena (natura\nmaterialiter spectata). And now the question arises\u2014inasmuch as these\ncategories are not derived from nature, and do not regulate themselves\naccording to her as their model (for in that case they would be\nempirical)\u2014how it is conceivable that nature must regulate herself\naccording to them, in other words, how the categories can determine \u00e0\npriori the synthesis of the manifold of nature, and yet not derive\ntheir origin from her. The following is the solution of this enigma.\nIt is not in the least more difficult to conceive how the laws of the\nphenomena of nature must harmonize with the understanding and with its\n\u00e0 priori form\u2014that is, its faculty of conjoining the manifold\u2014than it\nis to understand how the phenomena themselves must correspond with the\n\u00e0 priori form of our sensuous intuition. For laws do not exist in the\nphenomena any more than the phenomena exist as things in themselves.\nLaws do not exist except by relation to the subject in which the\nphenomena inhere, in so far as it possesses understanding, just as\nphenomena have no existence except by relation to the same existing\nsubject in so far as it has senses. To things as things in themselves,\nconformability to law must necessarily belong independently of an\nunderstanding to cognize them. But phenomena are only representations\nof things which are utterly unknown in respect to what they are in\nthemselves. But as mere representations, they stand under no law of\nconjunction except that which the conjoining faculty prescribes. Now\nthat which conjoins the manifold of sensuous intuition is imagination,\na mental act to which understanding contributes unity of intellectual\nsynthesis, and sensibility, manifoldness of apprehension. Now as all\npossible perception depends on the synthesis of apprehension, and this\nempirical synthesis itself on the transcendental, consequently on the\ncategories, it is evident that all possible perceptions, and therefore\neverything that can attain to empirical consciousness, that is, all\nphenomena of nature, must, as regards their conjunction, be subject to\nthe categories. And nature (considered merely as nature in general) is\ndependent on them, as the original ground of her necessary\nconformability to law (as natura formaliter spectata). But the pure\nfaculty (of the understanding) of prescribing laws \u00e0 priori to\nphenomena by means of mere categories, is not competent to enounce\nother or more laws than those on which a nature in general, as a\nconformability to law of phenomena of space and time, depends.\nParticular laws, inasmuch as they concern empirically determined\nphenomena, cannot be entirely deduced from pure laws, although they all\nstand under them. Experience must be superadded in order to know these\nparticular laws; but in regard to experience in general, and everything\nthat can be cognized as an object thereof, these \u00e0 priori laws are our\nonly rule and guide.\nResult of this Deduction of the Conceptions of the Understanding \u00a7 23\nWe cannot think any object except by means of the categories; we cannot\ncognize any thought except by means of intuitions corresponding to\nthese conceptions. Now all our intuitions are sensuous, and our\ncognition, in so far as the object of it is given, is empirical. But\nempirical cognition is experience; consequently no \u00e0 priori cognition\nis possible for us, except of objects of possible experience.[25]\n[25] Lest my readers should stumble at this assertion, and the\nconclusions that may be too rashly drawn from it, I must remind them\nthat the categories in the act of thought are by no means limited by\nthe conditions of our sensuous intuition, but have an unbounded sphere\nof action. It is only the cognition of the object of thought, the\ndetermining of the object, which requires intuition. In the absence of\nintuition, our thought of an object may still have true and useful\nconsequences in regard to the exercise of reason by the subject. But\nas this exercise of reason is not always directed on the determination\nof the object, in other words, on cognition thereof, but also on the\ndetermination of the subject and its volition, I do not intend to\ntreat of it in this place.\nBut this cognition, which is limited to objects of experience, is not\nfor that reason derived entirely, from, experience, but\u2014and this is\nasserted of the pure intuitions and the pure conceptions of the\nunderstanding\u2014there are, unquestionably, elements of cognition, which\nexist in the mind \u00e0 priori. Now there are only two ways in which a\nnecessary harmony of experience with the conceptions of its objects can\nbe cogitated. Either experience makes these conceptions possible, or\nthe conceptions make experience possible. The former of these\nstatements will not hold good with respect to the categories (nor in\nregard to pure sensuous intuition), for they are \u00e0 priori conceptions,\nand therefore independent of experience. The assertion of an empirical\norigin would attribute to them a sort of generatio aequivoca.\nConsequently, nothing remains but to adopt the second alternative\n(which presents us with a system, as it were, of the epigenesis of pure\nreason), namely, that on the part of the understanding the categories\ndo contain the grounds of the possibility of all experience. But with\nrespect to the questions how they make experience possible, and what\nare the principles of the possibility thereof with which they present\nus in their application to phenomena, the following section on the\ntranscendental exercise of the faculty of judgement will inform the\nreader.\nIt is quite possible that someone may propose a species of\npreformation-system of pure reason\u2014a middle way between the two\u2014to wit,\nthat the categories are neither innate and first \u00e0 priori principles of\ncognition, nor derived from experience, but are merely subjective\naptitudes for thought implanted in us contemporaneously with our\nexistence, which were so ordered and disposed by our Creator, that\ntheir exercise perfectly harmonizes with the laws of nature which\nregulate experience. Now, not to mention that with such an hypothesis\nit is impossible to say at what point we must stop in the employment of\npredetermined aptitudes, the fact that the categories would in this\ncase entirely lose that character of necessity which is essentially\ninvolved in the very conception of them, is a conclusive objection to\nit. The conception of cause, for example, which expresses the necessity\nof an effect under a presupposed condition, would be false, if it\nrested only upon such an arbitrary subjective necessity of uniting\ncertain empirical representations according to such a rule of relation.\nI could not then say\u2014\u201cThe effect is connected with its cause in the\nobject (that is, necessarily),\u201d but only, \u201cI am so constituted that I\ncan think this representation as so connected, and not otherwise.\u201d Now\nthis is just what the sceptic wants. For in this case, all our\nknowledge, depending on the supposed objective validity of our\njudgement, is nothing but mere illusion; nor would there be wanting\npeople who would deny any such subjective necessity in respect to\nthemselves, though they must feel it. At all events, we could not\ndispute with any one on that which merely depends on the manner in\nwhich his subject is organized.\nShort view of the above Deduction.\nThe foregoing deduction is an exposition of the pure conceptions of the\nunderstanding (and with them of all theoretical \u00e0 priori cognition), as\nprinciples of the possibility of experience, but of experience as the\ndetermination of all phenomena in space and time in general\u2014of\nexperience, finally, from the principle of the original synthetical\nunity of apperception, as the form of the understanding in relation to\ntime and space as original forms of sensibility.\nI consider the division by paragraphs to be necessary only up to this\npoint, because we had to treat of the elementary conceptions. As we now\nproceed to the exposition of the employment of these, I shall not\ndesignate the chapters in this manner any further.\nBOOK II. Analytic of Principles\nGeneral logic is constructed upon a plan which coincides exactly with\nthe division of the higher faculties of cognition. These are,\nunderstanding, judgement, and reason. This science, accordingly, treats\nin its analytic of conceptions, judgements, and conclusions in exact\ncorrespondence with the functions and order of those mental powers\nwhich we include generally under the generic denomination of\nunderstanding.\nAs this merely formal logic makes abstraction of all content of\ncognition, whether pure or empirical, and occupies itself with the mere\nform of thought (discursive cognition), it must contain in its analytic\na canon for reason. For the form of reason has its law, which, without\ntaking into consideration the particular nature of the cognition about\nwhich it is employed, can be discovered \u00e0 priori, by the simple\nanalysis of the action of reason into its momenta.\nTranscendental logic, limited as it is to a determinate content, that\nof pure \u00e0 priori cognitions, to wit, cannot imitate general logic in\nthis division. For it is evident that the transcendental employment of\nreason is not objectively valid, and therefore does not belong to the\nlogic of truth (that is, to analytic), but as a logic of illusion,\noccupies a particular department in the scholastic system under the\nname of transcendental dialectic.\nUnderstanding and judgement accordingly possess in transcendental logic\na canon of objectively valid, and therefore true exercise, and are\ncomprehended in the analytical department of that logic. But reason, in\nher endeavours to arrive by \u00e0 priori means at some true statement\nconcerning objects and to extend cognition beyond the bounds of\npossible experience, is altogether dialectic, and her illusory\nassertions cannot be constructed into a canon such as an analytic ought\nto contain.\nAccordingly, the analytic of principles will be merely a canon for the\nfaculty of judgement, for the instruction of this faculty in its\napplication to phenomena of the pure conceptions of the understanding,\nwhich contain the necessary condition for the establishment of \u00e0 priori\nlaws. On this account, although the subject of the following chapters\nis the especial principles of understanding, I shall make use of the\nterm Doctrine of the faculty of judgement, in order to define more\nparticularly my present purpose.\nINTRODUCTION. Of the Transcendental Faculty of judgement in General\nIf understanding in general be defined as the faculty of laws or rules,\nthe faculty of judgement may be termed the faculty of subsumption under\nthese rules; that is, of distinguishing whether this or that does or\ndoes not stand under a given rule (casus datae legis). General logic\ncontains no directions or precepts for the faculty of judgement, nor\ncan it contain any such. For as it makes abstraction of all content of\ncognition, no duty is left for it, except that of exposing analytically\nthe mere form of cognition in conceptions, judgements, and conclusions,\nand of thereby establishing formal rules for all exercise of the\nunderstanding. Now if this logic wished to give some general direction\nhow we should subsume under these rules, that is, how we should\ndistinguish whether this or that did or did not stand under them, this\nagain could not be done otherwise than by means of a rule. But this\nrule, precisely because it is a rule, requires for itself direction\nfrom the faculty of judgement. Thus, it is evident that the\nunderstanding is capable of being instructed by rules, but that the\njudgement is a peculiar talent, which does not, and cannot require\ntuition, but only exercise. This faculty is therefore the specific\nquality of the so-called mother wit, the want of which no scholastic\ndiscipline can compensate.\nFor although education may furnish, and, as it were, engraft upon a\nlimited understanding rules borrowed from other minds, yet the power of\nemploying these rules correctly must belong to the pupil himself; and\nno rule which we can prescribe to him with this purpose is, in the\nabsence or deficiency of this gift of nature, secure from misuse.[26] A\nphysician therefore, a judge or a statesman, may have in his head many\nadmirable pathological, juridical, or political rules, in a degree that\nmay enable him to be a profound teacher in his particular science, and\nyet in the application of these rules he may very possibly\nblunder\u2014either because he is wanting in natural judgement (though not\nin understanding) and, whilst he can comprehend the general in\nabstracto, cannot distinguish whether a particular case in concreto\nought to rank under the former; or because his faculty of judgement has\nnot been sufficiently exercised by examples and real practice. Indeed,\nthe grand and only use of examples, is to sharpen the judgement. For as\nregards the correctness and precision of the insight of the\nunderstanding, examples are commonly injurious rather than otherwise,\nbecause, as casus in terminis they seldom adequately fulfil the\nconditions of the rule. Besides, they often weaken the power of our\nunderstanding to apprehend rules or laws in their universality,\nindependently of particular circumstances of experience; and hence,\naccustom us to employ them more as formulae than as principles.\nExamples are thus the go-cart of the judgement, which he who is\nnaturally deficient in that faculty cannot afford to dispense with.\n[26] Deficiency in judgement is properly that which is called\nstupidity; and for such a failing we know no remedy. A dull or\nnarrow-minded person, to whom nothing is wanting but a proper degree\nof understanding, may be improved by tuition, even so far as to\ndeserve the epithet of learned. But as such persons frequently labour\nunder a deficiency in the faculty of judgement, it is not uncommon to\nfind men extremely learned who in the application of their science\nbetray a lamentable degree this irremediable want.\nBut although general logic cannot give directions to the faculty of\njudgement, the case is very different as regards transcendental logic,\ninsomuch that it appears to be the especial duty of the latter to\nsecure and direct, by means of determinate rules, the faculty of\njudgement in the employment of the pure understanding. For, as a\ndoctrine, that is, as an endeavour to enlarge the sphere of the\nunderstanding in regard to pure \u00e0 priori cognitions, philosophy is\nworse than useless, since from all the attempts hitherto made, little\nor no ground has been gained. But, as a critique, in order to guard\nagainst the mistakes of the faculty of judgement (lapsus judicii) in\nthe employment of the few pure conceptions of the understanding which\nwe possess, although its use is in this case purely negative,\nphilosophy is called upon to apply all its acuteness and penetration.\nBut transcendental philosophy has this peculiarity, that besides\nindicating the rule, or rather the general condition for rules, which\nis given in the pure conception of the understanding, it can, at the\nsame time, indicate \u00e0 priori the case to which the rule must be\napplied. The cause of the superiority which, in this respect,\ntranscendental philosophy possesses above all other sciences except\nmathematics, lies in this: it treats of conceptions which must relate \u00e0\npriori to their objects, whose objective validity consequently cannot\nbe demonstrated \u00e0 posteriori, and is, at the same time, under the\nobligation of presenting in general but sufficient tests, the\nconditions under which objects can be given in harmony with those\nconceptions; otherwise they would be mere logical forms, without\ncontent, and not pure conceptions of the understanding.\nOur transcendental doctrine of the faculty of judgement will contain\ntwo chapters. The first will treat of the sensuous condition under\nwhich alone pure conceptions of the understanding can be employed\u2014that\nis, of the schematism of the pure understanding. The second will treat\nof those synthetical judgements which are derived \u00e0 priori from pure\nconceptions of the understanding under those conditions, and which lie\n\u00e0 priori at the foundation of all other cognitions, that is to say, it\nwill treat of the principles of the pure understanding.\nTRANSCENDENTAL DOCTRINE OF THE FACULTY OF JUDGEMENT OR, ANALYTIC OF\nPRINCIPLES\nChapter I. Of the Schematism at of the Pure Conceptions of the\nUnderstanding\nIn all subsumptions of an object under a conception, the representation\nof the object must be homogeneous with the conception; in other words,\nthe conception must contain that which is represented in the object to\nbe subsumed under it. For this is the meaning of the expression: \u201cAn\nobject is contained under a conception.\u201d Thus the empirical conception\nof a plate is homogeneous with the pure geometrical conception of a\ncircle, inasmuch as the roundness which is cogitated in the former is\nintuited in the latter.\nBut pure conceptions of the understanding, when compared with empirical\nintuitions, or even with sensuous intuitions in general, are quite\nheterogeneous, and never can be discovered in any intuition. How then\nis the subsumption of the latter under the former, and consequently the\napplication of the categories to phenomena, possible?\u2014For it is\nimpossible to say, for example: \u201cCausality can be intuited through the\nsenses and is contained in the phenomenon.\u201d\u2014This natural and important\nquestion forms the real cause of the necessity of a transcendental\ndoctrine of the faculty of judgement, with the purpose, to wit, of\nshowing how pure conceptions of the understanding can be applied to\nphenomena. In all other sciences, where the conceptions by which the\nobject is thought in the general are not so different and heterogeneous\nfrom those which represent the object in concreto\u2014as it is given, it is\nquite unnecessary to institute any special inquiries concerning the\napplication of the former to the latter.\nNow it is quite clear that there must be some third thing, which on the\none side is homogeneous with the category, and with the phenomenon on\nthe other, and so makes the application of the former to the latter\npossible. This mediating representation must be pure (without any\nempirical content), and yet must on the one side be intellectual, on\nthe other sensuous. Such a representation is the transcendental schema.\nThe conception of the understanding contains pure synthetical unity of\nthe manifold in general. Time, as the formal condition of the manifold\nof the internal sense, consequently of the conjunction of all\nrepresentations, contains \u00e0 priori a manifold in the pure intuition.\nNow a transcendental determination of time is so far homogeneous with\nthe category, which constitutes the unity thereof, that it is universal\nand rests upon a rule \u00e0 priori. On the other hand, it is so far\nhomogeneous with the phenomenon, inasmuch as time is contained in every\nempirical representation of the manifold. Thus an application of the\ncategory to phenomena becomes possible, by means of the transcendental\ndetermination of time, which, as the schema of the conceptions of the\nunderstanding, mediates the subsumption of the latter under the former.\nAfter what has been proved in our deduction of the categories, no one,\nit is to be hoped, can hesitate as to the proper decision of the\nquestion, whether the employment of these pure conceptions of the\nunderstanding ought to be merely empirical or also transcendental; in\nother words, whether the categories, as conditions of a possible\nexperience, relate \u00e0 priori solely to phenomena, or whether, as\nconditions of the possibility of things in general, their application\ncan be extended to objects as things in themselves. For we have there\nseen that conceptions are quite impossible, and utterly without\nsignification, unless either to them, or at least to the elements of\nwhich they consist, an object be given; and that, consequently, they\ncannot possibly apply to objects as things in themselves without regard\nto the question whether and how these may be given to us; and, further,\nthat the only manner in which objects can be given to us is by means of\nthe modification of our sensibility; and, finally, that pure \u00e0 priori\nconceptions, in addition to the function of the understanding in the\ncategory, must contain \u00e0 priori formal conditions of sensibility (of\nthe internal sense, namely), which again contain the general condition\nunder which alone the category can be applied to any object. This\nformal and pure condition of sensibility, to which the conception of\nthe understanding is restricted in its employment, we shall name the\nschema of the conception of the understanding, and the procedure of the\nunderstanding with these schemata we shall call the schematism of the\npure understanding.\nThe schema is, in itself, always a mere product of the imagination.\nBut, as the synthesis of imagination has for its aim no single\nintuition, but merely unity in the determination of sensibility, the\nschema is clearly distinguishable from the image. Thus, if I place five\npoints one after another.... this is an image of the number five. On\nthe other hand, if I only think a number in general, which may be\neither five or a hundred, this thought is rather the representation of\na method of representing in an image a sum (e.g., a thousand) in\nconformity with a conception, than the image itself, an image which I\nshould find some little difficulty in reviewing, and comparing with the\nconception. Now this representation of a general procedure of the\nimagination to present its image to a conception, I call the schema of\nthis conception.\nIn truth, it is not images of objects, but schemata, which lie at the\nfoundation of our pure sensuous conceptions. No image could ever be\nadequate to our conception of a triangle in general. For the\ngeneralness of the conception it never could attain to, as this\nincludes under itself all triangles, whether right-angled,\nacute-angled, etc., whilst the image would always be limited to a\nsingle part of this sphere. The schema of the triangle can exist\nnowhere else than in thought, and it indicates a rule of the synthesis\nof the imagination in regard to pure figures in space. Still less is an\nobject of experience, or an image of the object, ever to the empirical\nconception. On the contrary, the conception always relates immediately\nto the schema of the imagination, as a rule for the determination of\nour intuition, in conformity with a certain general conception. The\nconception of a dog indicates a rule, according to which my imagination\ncan delineate the figure of a four-footed animal in general, without\nbeing limited to any particular individual form which experience\npresents to me, or indeed to any possible image that I can represent to\nmyself in concreto. This schematism of our understanding in regard to\nphenomena and their mere form, is an art, hidden in the depths of the\nhuman soul, whose true modes of action we shall only with difficulty\ndiscover and unveil. Thus much only can we say: \u201cThe image is a product\nof the empirical faculty of the productive imagination\u2014the schema of\nsensuous conceptions (of figures in space, for example) is a product,\nand, as it were, a monogram of the pure imagination \u00e0 priori, whereby\nand according to which images first become possible, which, however,\ncan be connected with the conception only mediately by means of the\nschema which they indicate, and are in themselves never fully adequate\nto it.\u201d On the other hand, the schema of a pure conception of the\nunderstanding is something that cannot be reduced into any image\u2014it is\nnothing else than the pure synthesis expressed by the category,\nconformably, to a rule of unity according to conceptions. It is a\ntranscendental product of the imagination, a product which concerns the\ndetermination of the internal sense, according to conditions of its\nform (time) in respect to all representations, in so far as these\nrepresentations must be conjoined \u00e0 priori in one conception,\nconformably to the unity of apperception.\nWithout entering upon a dry and tedious analysis of the essential\nrequisites of transcendental schemata of the pure conceptions of the\nunderstanding, we shall rather proceed at once to give an explanation\nof them according to the order of the categories, and in connection\ntherewith.\nFor the external sense the pure image of all quantities (quantorum) is\nspace; the pure image of all objects of sense in general, is time. But\nthe pure schema of quantity (quantitatis) as a conception of the\nunderstanding, is number, a representation which comprehends the\nsuccessive addition of one to one (homogeneous quantities). Thus,\nnumber is nothing else than the unity of the synthesis of the manifold\nin a homogeneous intuition, by means of my generating time itself in my\napprehension of the intuition.\nReality, in the pure conception of the understanding, is that which\ncorresponds to a sensation in general; that, consequently, the\nconception of which indicates a being (in time). Negation is that the\nconception of which represents a not-being (in time). The opposition of\nthese two consists therefore in the difference of one and the same\ntime, as a time filled or a time empty. Now as time is only the form of\nintuition, consequently of objects as phenomena, that which in objects\ncorresponds to sensation is the transcendental matter of all objects as\nthings in themselves (Sachheit, reality). Now every sensation has a\ndegree or quantity by which it can fill time, that is to say, the\ninternal sense in respect of the representation of an object, more or\nless, until it vanishes into nothing (= 0 = negatio). Thus there is a\nrelation and connection between reality and negation, or rather a\ntransition from the former to the latter, which makes every reality\nrepresentable to us as a quantum; and the schema of a reality as the\nquantity of something in so far as it fills time, is exactly this\ncontinuous and uniform generation of the reality in time, as we descend\nin time from the sensation which has a certain degree, down to the\nvanishing thereof, or gradually ascend from negation to the quantity\nthereof.\nThe schema of substance is the permanence of the real in time; that is,\nthe representation of it as a substratum of the empirical determination\nof time; a substratum which therefore remains, whilst all else changes.\n(Time passes not, but in it passes the existence of the changeable. To\ntime, therefore, which is itself unchangeable and permanent,\ncorresponds that which in the phenomenon is unchangeable in existence,\nthat is, substance, and it is only by it that the succession and\ncoexistence of phenomena can be determined in regard to time.)\nThe schema of cause and of the causality of a thing is the real which,\nwhen posited, is always followed by something else. It consists,\ntherefore, in the succession of the manifold, in so far as that\nsuccession is subjected to a rule.\nThe schema of community (reciprocity of action and reaction), or the\nreciprocal causality of substances in respect of their accidents, is\nthe coexistence of the determinations of the one with those of the\nother, according to a general rule.\nThe schema of possibility is the accordance of the synthesis of\ndifferent representations with the conditions of time in general (as,\nfor example, opposites cannot exist together at the same time in the\nsame thing, but only after each other), and is therefore the\ndetermination of the representation of a thing at any time.\nThe schema of reality is existence in a determined time.\nThe schema of necessity is the existence of an object in all time.\nIt is clear, from all this, that the schema of the category of quantity\ncontains and represents the generation (synthesis) of time itself, in\nthe successive apprehension of an object; the schema of quality the\nsynthesis of sensation with the representation of time, or the filling\nup of time; the schema of relation the relation of perceptions to each\nother in all time (that is, according to a rule of the determination of\ntime): and finally, the schema of modality and its categories, time\nitself, as the correlative of the determination of an object\u2014whether it\ndoes belong to time, and how. The schemata, therefore, are nothing but\n\u00e0 priori determinations of time according to rules, and these, in\nregard to all possible objects, following the arrangement of the\ncategories, relate to the series in time, the content in time, the\norder in time, and finally, to the complex or totality in time.\nHence it is apparent that the schematism of the understanding, by means\nof the transcendental synthesis of the imagination, amounts to nothing\nelse than the unity of the manifold of intuition in the internal sense,\nand thus indirectly to the unity of apperception, as a function\ncorresponding to the internal sense (a receptivity). Thus, the schemata\nof the pure conceptions of the understanding are the true and only\nconditions whereby our understanding receives an application to\nobjects, and consequently significance. Finally, therefore, the\ncategories are only capable of empirical use, inasmuch as they serve\nmerely to subject phenomena to the universal rules of synthesis, by\nmeans of an \u00e0 priori necessary unity (on account of the necessary union\nof all consciousness in one original apperception); and so to render\nthem susceptible of a complete connection in one experience. But within\nthis whole of possible experience lie all our cognitions, and in the\nuniversal relation to this experience consists transcendental truth,\nwhich antecedes all empirical truth, and renders the latter possible.\nIt is, however, evident at first sight, that although the schemata of\nsensibility are the sole agents in realizing the categories, they do,\nnevertheless, also restrict them, that is, they limit the categories by\nconditions which lie beyond the sphere of understanding\u2014namely, in\nsensibility. Hence the schema is properly only the phenomenon, or the\nsensuous conception of an object in harmony with the category. (Numerus\nest quantitas phaenomenon\u2014sensatio realitas phaenomenon; constans et\nperdurabile rerum substantia phaenomenon\u2014aeternitas, necessitas,\nphaenomena, etc.) Now, if we remove a restrictive condition, we thereby\namplify, it appears, the formerly limited conception. In this way, the\ncategories in their pure signification, free from all conditions of\nsensibility, ought to be valid of things as they are, and not, as the\nschemata represent them, merely as they appear; and consequently the\ncategories must have a significance far more extended, and wholly\nindependent of all schemata. In truth, there does always remain to the\npure conceptions of the understanding, after abstracting every sensuous\ncondition, a value and significance, which is, however, merely logical.\nBut in this case, no object is given them, and therefore they have no\nmeaning sufficient to afford us a conception of an object. The notion\nof substance, for example, if we leave out the sensuous determination\nof permanence, would mean nothing more than a something which can be\ncogitated as subject, without the possibility of becoming a predicate\nto anything else. Of this representation I can make nothing, inasmuch\nas it does not indicate to me what determinations the thing possesses\nwhich must thus be valid as premier subject. Consequently, the\ncategories, without schemata are merely functions of the understanding\nfor the production of conceptions, but do not represent any object.\nThis significance they derive from sensibility, which at the same time\nrealizes the understanding and restricts it.\nChapter II. System of all Principles of the Pure Understanding\nIn the foregoing chapter we have merely considered the general\nconditions under which alone the transcendental faculty of judgement is\njustified in using the pure conceptions of the understanding for\nsynthetical judgements. Our duty at present is to exhibit in systematic\nconnection those judgements which the understanding really produces \u00e0\npriori. For this purpose, our table of the categories will certainly\nafford us the natural and safe guidance. For it is precisely the\ncategories whose application to possible experience must constitute all\npure \u00e0 priori cognition of the understanding; and the relation of which\nto sensibility will, on that very account, present us with a complete\nand systematic catalogue of all the transcendental principles of the\nuse of the understanding.\nPrinciples \u00e0 priori are so called, not merely because they contain in\nthemselves the grounds of other judgements, but also because they\nthemselves are not grounded in higher and more general cognitions. This\npeculiarity, however, does not raise them altogether above the need of\na proof. For although there could be found no higher cognition, and\ntherefore no objective proof, and although such a principle rather\nserves as the foundation for all cognition of the object, this by no\nmeans hinders us from drawing a proof from the subjective sources of\nthe possibility of the cognition of an object. Such a proof is\nnecessary, moreover, because without it the principle might be liable\nto the imputation of being a mere gratuitous assertion.\nIn the second place, we shall limit our investigations to those\nprinciples which relate to the categories. For as to the principles of\ntranscendental \u00e6sthetic, according to which space and time are the\nconditions of the possibility of things as phenomena, as also the\nrestriction of these principles, namely, that they cannot be applied to\nobjects as things in themselves\u2014these, of course, do not fall within\nthe scope of our present inquiry. In like manner, the principles of\nmathematical science form no part of this system, because they are all\ndrawn from intuition, and not from the pure conception of the\nunderstanding. The possibility of these principles, however, will\nnecessarily be considered here, inasmuch as they are synthetical\njudgements \u00e0 priori, not indeed for the purpose of proving their\naccuracy and apodeictic certainty, which is unnecessary, but merely to\nrender conceivable and deduce the possibility of such evident \u00e0 priori\ncognitions.\nBut we shall have also to speak of the principle of analytical\njudgements, in opposition to synthetical judgements, which is the\nproper subject of our inquiries, because this very opposition will free\nthe theory of the latter from all ambiguity, and place it clearly\nbefore our eyes in its true nature.\nSYSTEM OF THE PRINCIPLES OF THE PURE UNDERSTANDING\nSection I. Of the Supreme Principle of all Analytical Judgements\nWhatever may be the content of our cognition, and in whatever manner\nour cognition may be related to its object, the universal, although\nonly negative conditions of all our judgements is that they do not\ncontradict themselves; otherwise these judgements are in themselves\n(even without respect to the object) nothing. But although there may\nexist no contradiction in our judgement, it may nevertheless connect\nconceptions in such a manner that they do not correspond to the object,\nor without any grounds either \u00e0 priori or \u00e0 posteriori for arriving at\nsuch a judgement, and thus, without being self-contradictory, a\njudgement may nevertheless be either false or groundless.\nNow, the proposition: \u201cNo subject can have a predicate that contradicts\nit,\u201d is called the principle of contradiction, and is a universal but\npurely negative criterion of all truth. But it belongs to logic alone,\nbecause it is valid of cognitions, merely as cognitions and without\nrespect to their content, and declares that the contradiction entirely\nnullifies them. We can also, however, make a positive use of this\nprinciple, that is, not merely to banish falsehood and error (in so far\nas it rests upon contradiction), but also for the cognition of truth.\nFor if the judgement is analytical, be it affirmative or negative, its\ntruth must always be recognizable by means of the principle of\ncontradiction. For the contrary of that which lies and is cogitated as\nconception in the cognition of the object will be always properly\nnegatived, but the conception itself must always be affirmed of the\nobject, inasmuch as the contrary thereof would be in contradiction to\nthe object.\nWe must therefore hold the principle of contradiction to be the\nuniversal and fully sufficient Principle of all analytical cognition.\nBut as a sufficient criterion of truth, it has no further utility or\nauthority. For the fact that no cognition can be at variance with this\nprinciple without nullifying itself, constitutes this principle the\nsine qua non, but not the determining ground of the truth of our\ncognition. As our business at present is properly with the synthetical\npart of our knowledge only, we shall always be on our guard not to\ntransgress this inviolable principle; but at the same time not to\nexpect from it any direct assistance in the establishment of the truth\nof any synthetical proposition.\nThere exists, however, a formula of this celebrated principle\u2014a\nprinciple merely formal and entirely without content\u2014which contains a\nsynthesis that has been inadvertently and quite unnecessarily mixed up\nwith it. It is this: \u201cIt is impossible for a thing to be and not to be\nat the same time.\u201d Not to mention the superfluousness of the addition\nof the word impossible to indicate the apodeictic certainty, which\nought to be self-evident from the proposition itself, the proposition\nis affected by the condition of time, and as it were says: \u201cA thing =\nA, which is something = B, cannot at the same time be non-B.\u201d But both,\nB as well as non-B, may quite well exist in succession. For example, a\nman who is young cannot at the same time be old; but the same man can\nvery well be at one time young, and at another not young, that is, old.\nNow the principle of contradiction as a merely logical proposition must\nnot by any means limit its application merely to relations of time, and\nconsequently a formula like the preceding is quite foreign to its true\npurpose. The misunderstanding arises in this way. We first of all\nseparate a predicate of a thing from the conception of the thing, and\nafterwards connect with this predicate its opposite, and hence do not\nestablish any contradiction with the subject, but only with its\npredicate, which has been conjoined with the subject synthetically\u2014a\ncontradiction, moreover, which obtains only when the first and second\npredicate are affirmed in the same time. If I say: \u201cA man who is\nignorant is not learned,\u201d the condition \u201cat the same time\u201d must be\nadded, for he who is at one time ignorant, may at another be learned.\nBut if I say: \u201cNo ignorant man is a learned man,\u201d the proposition is\nanalytical, because the characteristic ignorance is now a constituent\npart of the conception of the subject; and in this case the negative\nproposition is evident immediately from the proposition of\ncontradiction, without the necessity of adding the condition \u201cthe same\ntime.\u201d This is the reason why I have altered the formula of this\nprinciple\u2014an alteration which shows very clearly the nature of an\nanalytical proposition.\nSection II. Of the Supreme Principle of all Synthetical Judgements\nThe explanation of the possibility of synthetical judgements is a task\nwith which general logic has nothing to do; indeed she needs not even\nbe acquainted with its name. But in transcendental logic it is the most\nimportant matter to be dealt with\u2014indeed the only one, if the question\nis of the possibility of synthetical judgements \u00e0 priori, the\nconditions and extent of their validity. For when this question is\nfully decided, it can reach its aim with perfect ease, the\ndetermination, to wit, of the extent and limits of the pure\nunderstanding.\nIn an analytical judgement I do not go beyond the given conception, in\norder to arrive at some decision respecting it. If the judgement is\naffirmative, I predicate of the conception only that which was already\ncogitated in it; if negative, I merely exclude from the conception its\ncontrary. But in synthetical judgements, I must go beyond the given\nconception, in order to cogitate, in relation with it, something quite\ndifferent from that which was cogitated in it, a relation which is\nconsequently never one either of identity or contradiction, and by\nmeans of which the truth or error of the judgement cannot be discerned\nmerely from the judgement itself.\nGranted, then, that we must go out beyond a given conception, in order\nto compare it synthetically with another, a third thing is necessary,\nin which alone the synthesis of two conceptions can originate. Now what\nis this tertium quid that is to be the medium of all synthetical\njudgements? It is only a complex in which all our representations are\ncontained, the internal sense to wit, and its form \u00e0 priori, time.\nThe synthesis of our representations rests upon the imagination; their\nsynthetical unity (which is requisite to a judgement), upon the unity\nof apperception. In this, therefore, is to be sought the possibility of\nsynthetical judgements, and as all three contain the sources of \u00e0\npriori representations, the possibility of pure synthetical judgements\nalso; nay, they are necessary upon these grounds, if we are to possess\na knowledge of objects, which rests solely upon the synthesis of\nrepresentations.\nIf a cognition is to have objective reality, that is, to relate to an\nobject, and possess sense and meaning in respect to it, it is necessary\nthat the object be given in some way or another. Without this, our\nconceptions are empty, and we may indeed have thought by means of them,\nbut by such thinking we have not, in fact, cognized anything, we have\nmerely played with representation. To give an object, if this\nexpression be understood in the sense of \u201cto present\u201d the object, not\nmediately but immediately in intuition, means nothing else than to\napply the representation of it to experience, be that experience real\nor only possible. Space and time themselves, pure as these conceptions\nare from all that is empirical, and certain as it is that they are\nrepresented fully \u00e0 priori in the mind, would be completely without\nobjective validity, and without sense and significance, if their\nnecessary use in the objects of experience were not shown. Nay, the\nrepresentation of them is a mere schema, that always relates to the\nreproductive imagination, which calls up the objects of experience,\nwithout which they have no meaning. And so it is with all conceptions\nwithout distinction.\nThe possibility of experience is, then, that which gives objective\nreality to all our \u00e0 priori cognitions. Now experience depends upon the\nsynthetical unity of phenomena, that is, upon a synthesis according to\nconceptions of the object of phenomena in general, a synthesis without\nwhich experience never could become knowledge, but would be merely a\nrhapsody of perceptions, never fitting together into any connected\ntext, according to rules of a thoroughly united (possible)\nconsciousness, and therefore never subjected to the transcendental and\nnecessary unity of apperception. Experience has therefore for a\nfoundation, \u00e0 priori principles of its form, that is to say, general\nrules of unity in the synthesis of phenomena, the objective reality of\nwhich rules, as necessary conditions even of the possibility of\nexperience can which rules, as necessary conditions\u2014even of the\npossibility of experience\u2014can always be shown in experience. But apart\nfrom this relation, \u00e0 priori synthetical propositions are absolutely\nimpossible, because they have no third term, that is, no pure object,\nin which the synthetical unity can exhibit the objective reality of its\nconceptions.\nAlthough, then, respecting space, or the forms which productive\nimagination describes therein, we do cognize much \u00e0 priori in\nsynthetical judgements, and are really in no need of experience for\nthis purpose, such knowledge would nevertheless amount to nothing but a\nbusy trifling with a mere chimera, were not space to be considered as\nthe condition of the phenomena which constitute the material of\nexternal experience. Hence those pure synthetical judgements do relate,\nthough but mediately, to possible experience, or rather to the\npossibility of experience, and upon that alone is founded the objective\nvalidity of their synthesis.\nWhile then, on the one hand, experience, as empirical synthesis, is the\nonly possible mode of cognition which gives reality to all other\nsynthesis; on the other hand, this latter synthesis, as cognition \u00e0\npriori, possesses truth, that is, accordance with its object, only in\nso far as it contains nothing more than what is necessary to the\nsynthetical unity of experience.\nAccordingly, the supreme principle of all synthetical judgements is:\n\u201cEvery object is subject to the necessary conditions of the synthetical\nunity of the manifold of intuition in a possible experience.\u201d\n\u00c0 priori synthetical judgements are possible when we apply the formal\nconditions of the \u00e0 priori intuition, the synthesis of the imagination,\nand the necessary unity of that synthesis in a transcendental\napperception, to a possible cognition of experience, and say: \u201cThe\nconditions of the possibility of experience in general are at the same\ntime conditions of the possibility of the objects of experience, and\nhave, for that reason, objective validity in an \u00e0 priori synthetical\njudgement.\u201d\nSection III. Systematic Representation of all Synthetical Principles of\nthe Pure Understanding\nThat principles exist at all is to be ascribed solely to the pure\nunderstanding, which is not only the faculty of rules in regard to that\nwhich happens, but is even the source of principles according to which\neverything that can be presented to us as an object is necessarily\nsubject to rules, because without such rules we never could attain to\ncognition of an object. Even the laws of nature, if they are\ncontemplated as principles of the empirical use of the understanding,\npossess also a characteristic of necessity, and we may therefore at\nleast expect them to be determined upon grounds which are valid \u00e0\npriori and antecedent to all experience. But all laws of nature,\nwithout distinction, are subject to higher principles of the\nunderstanding, inasmuch as the former are merely applications of the\nlatter to particular cases of experience. These higher principles alone\ntherefore give the conception, which contains the necessary condition,\nand, as it were, the exponent of a rule; experience, on the other hand,\ngives the case which comes under the rule.\nThere is no danger of our mistaking merely empirical principles for\nprinciples of the pure understanding, or conversely; for the character\nof necessity, according to conceptions which distinguish the latter,\nand the absence of this in every empirical proposition, how extensively\nvalid soever it may be, is a perfect safeguard against confounding\nthem. There are, however, pure principles \u00e0 priori, which nevertheless\nI should not ascribe to the pure understanding\u2014for this reason, that\nthey are not derived from pure conceptions, but (although by the\nmediation of the understanding) from pure intuitions. But understanding\nis the faculty of conceptions. Such principles mathematical science\npossesses, but their application to experience, consequently their\nobjective validity, nay the possibility of such \u00e0 priori synthetical\ncognitions (the deduction thereof) rests entirely upon the pure\nunderstanding.\nOn this account, I shall not reckon among my principles those of\nmathematics; though I shall include those upon the possibility and\nobjective validity \u00e0 priori, of principles of the mathematical science,\nwhich, consequently, are to be looked upon as the principle of these,\nand which proceed from conceptions to intuition, and not from intuition\nto conceptions.\nIn the application of the pure conceptions of the understanding to\npossible experience, the employment of their synthesis is either\nmathematical or dynamical, for it is directed partly on the intuition\nalone, partly on the existence of a phenomenon. But the \u00e0 priori\nconditions of intuition are in relation to a possible experience\nabsolutely necessary, those of the existence of objects of a possible\nempirical intuition are in themselves contingent. Hence the principles\nof the mathematical use of the categories will possess a character of\nabsolute necessity, that is, will be apodeictic; those, on the other\nhand, of the dynamical use, the character of an \u00e0 priori necessity\nindeed, but only under the condition of empirical thought in an\nexperience, therefore only mediately and indirectly. Consequently they\nwill not possess that immediate evidence which is peculiar to the\nformer, although their application to experience does not, for that\nreason, lose its truth and certitude. But of this point we shall be\nbetter able to judge at the conclusion of this system of principles.\nThe table of the categories is naturally our guide to the table of\nprinciples, because these are nothing else than rules for the objective\nemployment of the former. Accordingly, all principles of the pure\nunderstanding are:\n1\nAxioms\nof Intuition\n2                                    3\nAnticipations                          Analogies\nof Perception                        of Experience\n4\nPostulates of\nEmpirical Thought\nin general\nThese appellations I have chosen advisedly, in order that we might not\nlose sight of the distinctions in respect of the evidence and the\nemployment of these principles. It will, however, soon appear that\u2014a\nfact which concerns both the evidence of these principles, and the \u00e0\npriori determination of phenomena\u2014according to the categories of\nquantity and quality (if we attend merely to the form of these), the\nprinciples of these categories are distinguishable from those of the\ntwo others, in as much as the former are possessed of an intuitive, but\nthe latter of a merely discursive, though in both instances a complete,\ncertitude. I shall therefore call the former mathematical, and the\nlatter dynamical principles.[27] It must be observed, however, that by\nthese terms I mean just as little in the one case the principles of\nmathematics as those of general (physical) dynamics in the other. I\nhave here in view merely the principles of the pure understanding, in\ntheir application to the internal sense (without distinction of the\nrepresentations given therein), by means of which the sciences of\nmathematics and dynamics become possible. Accordingly, I have named\nthese principles rather with reference to their application than their\ncontent; and I shall now proceed to consider them in the order in which\nthey stand in the table.\n[27] All combination (conjunctio) is either composition (compositio)\nor connection (nexus). The former is the synthesis of a manifold, the\nparts of which do not necessarily belong to each other. For example,\nthe two triangles into which a square is divided by a diagonal, do not\nnecessarily belong to each other, and of this kind is the synthesis of\nthe homogeneous in everything that can be mathematically considered.\nThis synthesis can be divided into those of aggregation and coalition,\nthe former of which is applied to extensive, the latter to intensive\nquantities. The second sort of combination (nexus) is the synthesis of\na manifold, in so far as its parts do belong necessarily to each\nother; for example, the accident to a substance, or the effect to the\ncause. Consequently it is a synthesis of that which though\nheterogeneous, is represented as connected \u00e0 priori. This\ncombination\u2014not an arbitrary one\u2014I entitle dynamical because it\nconcerns the connection of the existence of the manifold. This, again,\nmay be divided into the physical synthesis, of the phenomena divided\namong each other, and the metaphysical synthesis, or the connection of\nphenomena \u00e0 priori in the faculty of cognition.\n1. AXIOMS OF INTUITION.\nThe principle of these is: All Intuitions are Extensive Quantities.\nPROOF.\nAll phenomena contain, as regards their form, an intuition in space and\ntime, which lies \u00e0 priori at the foundation of all without exception.\nPhenomena, therefore, cannot be apprehended, that is, received into\nempirical consciousness otherwise than through the synthesis of a\nmanifold, through which the representations of a determinate space or\ntime are generated; that is to say, through the composition of the\nhomogeneous and the consciousness of the synthetical unity of this\nmanifold (homogeneous). Now the consciousness of a homogeneous manifold\nin intuition, in so far as thereby the representation of an object is\nrendered possible, is the conception of a quantity (quanti).\nConsequently, even the perception of an object as phenomenon is\npossible only through the same synthetical unity of the manifold of the\ngiven sensuous intuition, through which the unity of the composition of\nthe homogeneous manifold in the conception of a quantity is cogitated;\nthat is to say, all phenomena are quantities, and extensive quantities,\nbecause as intuitions in space or time they must be represented by\nmeans of the same synthesis through which space and time themselves are\ndetermined.\nAn extensive quantity I call that wherein the representation of the\nparts renders possible (and therefore necessarily antecedes) the\nrepresentation of the whole. I cannot represent to myself any line,\nhowever small, without drawing it in thought, that is, without\ngenerating from a point all its parts one after another, and in this\nway alone producing this intuition. Precisely the same is the case with\nevery, even the smallest, portion of time. I cogitate therein only the\nsuccessive progress from one moment to another, and hence, by means of\nthe different portions of time and the addition of them, a determinate\nquantity of time is produced. As the pure intuition in all phenomena is\neither time or space, so is every phenomenon in its character of\nintuition an extensive quantity, inasmuch as it can only be cognized in\nour apprehension by successive synthesis (from part to part). All\nphenomena are, accordingly, to be considered as aggregates, that is, as\na collection of previously given parts; which is not the case with\nevery sort of quantities, but only with those which are represented and\napprehended by us as extensive.\nOn this successive synthesis of the productive imagination, in the\ngeneration of figures, is founded the mathematics of extension, or\ngeometry, with its axioms, which express the conditions of sensuous\nintuition \u00e0 priori, under which alone the schema of a pure conception\nof external intuition can exist; for example, \u201cbe tween two points only\none straight line is possible,\u201d \u201ctwo straight lines cannot enclose a\nspace,\u201d etc. These are the axioms which properly relate only to\nquantities (quanta) as such.\nBut, as regards the quantity of a thing (quantitas), that is to say,\nthe answer to the question: \u201cHow large is this or that object?\u201d\nalthough, in respect to this question, we have various propositions\nsynthetical and immediately certain (indemonstrabilia); we have, in the\nproper sense of the term, no axioms. For example, the propositions: \u201cIf\nequals be added to equals, the wholes are equal\u201d; \u201cIf equals be taken\nfrom equals, the remainders are equal\u201d; are analytical, because I am\nimmediately conscious of the identity of the production of the one\nquantity with the production of the other; whereas axioms must be \u00e0\npriori synthetical propositions. On the other hand, the self-evident\npropositions as to the relation of numbers, are certainly synthetical\nbut not universal, like those of geometry, and for this reason cannot\nbe called axioms, but numerical formulae. That 7 + 5 = 12 is not an\nanalytical proposition. For neither in the representation of seven, nor\nof five, nor of the composition of the two numbers, do I cogitate the\nnumber twelve. (Whether I cogitate the number in the addition of both,\nis not at present the question; for in the case of an analytical\nproposition, the only point is whether I really cogitate the predicate\nin the representation of the subject.) But although the proposition is\nsynthetical, it is nevertheless only a singular proposition. In so far\nas regard is here had merely to the synthesis of the homogeneous (the\nunits), it cannot take place except in one manner, although our use of\nthese numbers is afterwards general. If I say: \u201cA triangle can be\nconstructed with three lines, any two of which taken together are\ngreater than the third,\u201d I exercise merely the pure function of the\nproductive imagination, which may draw the lines longer or shorter and\nconstruct the angles at its pleasure. On the contrary, the number seven\nis possible only in one manner, and so is likewise the number twelve,\nwhich results from the synthesis of seven and five. Such propositions,\nthen, cannot be termed axioms (for in that case we should have an\ninfinity of these), but numerical formulae.\nThis transcendental principle of the mathematics of phenomena greatly\nenlarges our \u00e0 priori cognition. For it is by this principle alone that\npure mathematics is rendered applicable in all its precision to objects\nof experience, and without it the validity of this application would\nnot be so self-evident; on the contrary, contradictions and confusions\nhave often arisen on this very point. Phenomena are not things in\nthemselves. Empirical intuition is possible only through pure intuition\n(of space and time); consequently, what geometry affirms of the latter,\nis indisputably valid of the former. All evasions, such as the\nstatement that objects of sense do not conform to the rules of\nconstruction in space (for example, to the rule of the infinite\ndivisibility of lines or angles), must fall to the ground. For, if\nthese objections hold good, we deny to space, and with it to all\nmathematics, objective validity, and no longer know wherefore, and how\nfar, mathematics can be applied to phenomena. The synthesis of spaces\nand times as the essential form of all intuition, is that which renders\npossible the apprehension of a phenomenon, and therefore every external\nexperience, consequently all cognition of the objects of experience;\nand whatever mathematics in its pure use proves of the former, must\nnecessarily hold good of the latter. All objections are but the\nchicaneries of an ill-instructed reason, which erroneously thinks to\nliberate the objects of sense from the formal conditions of our\nsensibility, and represents these, although mere phenomena, as things\nin themselves, presented as such to our understanding. But in this\ncase, no \u00e0 priori synthetical cognition of them could be possible,\nconsequently not through pure conceptions of space and the science\nwhich determines these conceptions, that is to say, geometry, would\nitself be impossible.\n2. ANTICIPATIONS OF PERCEPTION.\nThe principle of these is: In all phenomena the Real, that which is an\nobject of sensation, has Intensive Quantity, that is, has a Degree.\nPROOF.\nPerception is empirical consciousness, that is to say, a consciousness\nwhich contains an element of sensation. Phenomena as objects of\nperception are not pure, that is, merely formal intuitions, like space\nand time, for they cannot be perceived in themselves.[28] They contain,\nthen, over and above the intuition, the materials for an object\n(through which is represented something existing in space or time),\nthat is to say, they contain the real of sensation, as a representation\nmerely subjective, which gives us merely the consciousness that the\nsubject is affected, and which we refer to some external object. Now, a\ngradual transition from empirical consciousness to pure consciousness\nis possible, inasmuch as the real in this consciousness entirely\nvanishes, and there remains a merely formal consciousness (\u00e0 priori) of\nthe manifold in time and space; consequently there is possible a\nsynthesis also of the production of the quantity of a sensation from\nits commencement, that is, from the pure intuition = 0 onwards up to a\ncertain quantity of the sensation. Now as sensation in itself is not an\nobjective representation, and in it is to be found neither the\nintuition of space nor of time, it cannot possess any extensive\nquantity, and yet there does belong to it a quantity (and that by means\nof its apprehension, in which empirical consciousness can within a\ncertain time rise from nothing = 0 up to its given amount),\nconsequently an intensive quantity. And thus we must ascribe intensive\nquantity, that is, a degree of influence on sense to all objects of\nperception, in so far as this perception contains sensation.\n[28] They can be perceived only as phenomena, and some part of them\nmust always belong to the non-ego; whereas pure intuitions are\nentirely the products of the mind itself, and as such are cognized _in\nthemselves.\u2014Tr_\nAll cognition, by means of which I am enabled to cognize and determine\n\u00e0 priori what belongs to empirical cognition, may be called an\nanticipation; and without doubt this is the sense in which Epicurus\nemployed his expression prholepsis. But as there is in phenomena\nsomething which is never cognized \u00e0 priori, which on this account\nconstitutes the proper difference between pure and empirical cognition,\nthat is to say, sensation (as the matter of perception), it follows,\nthat sensation is just that element in cognition which cannot be at all\nanticipated. On the other hand, we might very well term the pure\ndeterminations in space and time, as well in regard to figure as to\nquantity, anticipations of phenomena, because they represent \u00e0 priori\nthat which may always be given \u00e0 posteriori in experience. But suppose\nthat in every sensation, as sensation in general, without any\nparticular sensation being thought of, there existed something which\ncould be cognized \u00e0 priori, this would deserve to be called\nanticipation in a special sense\u2014special, because it may seem surprising\nto forestall experience, in that which concerns the matter of\nexperience, and which we can only derive from itself. Yet such really\nis the case here.\nApprehension[29], by means of sensation alone, fills only one moment,\nthat is, if I do not take into consideration a succession of many\nsensations. As that in the phenomenon, the apprehension of which is not\na successive synthesis advancing from parts to an entire\nrepresentation, sensation has therefore no extensive quantity; the want\nof sensation in a moment of time would represent it as empty,\nconsequently = 0. That which in the empirical intuition corresponds to\nsensation is reality (realitas phaenomenon); that which corresponds to\nthe absence of it, negation = 0. Now every sensation is capable of a\ndiminution, so that it can decrease, and thus gradually disappear.\nTherefore, between reality in a phenomenon and negation, there exists a\ncontinuous concatenation of many possible intermediate sensations, the\ndifference of which from each other is always smaller than that between\nthe given sensation and zero, or complete negation. That is to say, the\nreal in a phenomenon has always a quantity, which however is not\ndiscoverable in apprehension, inasmuch as apprehension take place by\nmeans of mere sensation in one instant, and not by the successive\nsynthesis of many sensations, and therefore does not progress from\nparts to the whole. Consequently, it has a quantity, but not an\nextensive quantity.\n[29] Apprehension is the Kantian word for preception, in the largest\nsense in which we employ that term. It is the genus which includes\nunder i, as species, perception proper and sensation proper\u2014Tr\nNow that quantity which is apprehended only as unity, and in which\nplurality can be represented only by approximation to negation = 0, I\nterm intensive quantity. Consequently, reality in a phenomenon has\nintensive quantity, that is, a degree. If we consider this reality as\ncause (be it of sensation or of another reality in the phenomenon, for\nexample, a change), we call the degree of reality in its character of\ncause a momentum, for example, the momentum of weight; and for this\nreason, that the degree only indicates that quantity the apprehension\nof which is not successive, but instantaneous. This, however, I touch\nupon only in passing, for with causality I have at present nothing to\ndo.\nAccordingly, every sensation, consequently every reality in phenomena,\nhowever small it may be, has a degree, that is, an intensive quantity,\nwhich may always be lessened, and between reality and negation there\nexists a continuous connection of possible realities, and possible\nsmaller perceptions. Every colour\u2014for example, red\u2014has a degree, which,\nbe it ever so small, is never the smallest, and so is it always with\nheat, the momentum of weight, etc.\nThis property of quantities, according to which no part of them is the\nsmallest possible (no part simple), is called their continuity. Space\nand time are quanta continua, because no part of them can be given,\nwithout enclosing it within boundaries (points and moments),\nconsequently, this given part is itself a space or a time. Space,\ntherefore, consists only of spaces, and time of times. Points and\nmoments are only boundaries, that is, the mere places or positions of\ntheir limitation. But places always presuppose intuitions which are to\nlimit or determine them; and we cannot conceive either space or time\ncomposed of constituent parts which are given before space or time.\nSuch quantities may also be called flowing, because synthesis (of the\nproductive imagination) in the production of these quantities is a\nprogression in time, the continuity of which we are accustomed to\nindicate by the expression flowing.\nAll phenomena, then, are continuous quantities, in respect both to\nintuition and mere perception (sensation, and with it reality). In the\nformer case they are extensive quantities; in the latter, intensive.\nWhen the synthesis of the manifold of a phenomenon is interrupted,\nthere results merely an aggregate of several phenomena, and not\nproperly a phenomenon as a quantity, which is not produced by the mere\ncontinuation of the productive synthesis of a certain kind, but by the\nrepetition of a synthesis always ceasing. For example, if I call\nthirteen dollars a sum or quantity of money, I employ the term quite\ncorrectly, inasmuch as I understand by thirteen dollars the value of a\nmark in standard silver, which is, to be sure, a continuous quantity,\nin which no part is the smallest, but every part might constitute a\npiece of money, which would contain material for still smaller pieces.\nIf, however, by the words thirteen dollars I understand so many coins\n(be their value in silver what it may), it would be quite erroneous to\nuse the expression a quantity of dollars; on the contrary, I must call\nthem aggregate, that is, a number of coins. And as in every number we\nmust have unity as the foundation, so a phenomenon taken as unity is a\nquantity, and as such always a continuous quantity (quantum continuum).\nNow, seeing all phenomena, whether considered as extensive or\nintensive, are continuous quantities, the proposition: \u201cAll change\n(transition of a thing from one state into another) is continuous,\u201d\nmight be proved here easily, and with mathematical evidence, were it\nnot that the causality of a change lies, entirely beyond the bounds of\na transcendental philosophy, and presupposes empirical principles. For\nof the possibility of a cause which changes the condition of things,\nthat is, which determines them to the contrary to a certain given\nstate, the understanding gives us \u00e0 priori no knowledge; not merely\nbecause it has no insight into the possibility of it (for such insight\nis absent in several \u00e0 priori cognitions), but because the notion of\nchange concerns only certain determinations of phenomena, which\nexperience alone can acquaint us with, while their cause lies in the\nunchangeable. But seeing that we have nothing which we could here\nemploy but the pure fundamental conceptions of all possible experience,\namong which of course nothing empirical can be admitted, we dare not,\nwithout injuring the unity of our system, anticipate general physical\nscience, which is built upon certain fundamental experiences.\nNevertheless, we are in no want of proofs of the great influence which\nthe principle above developed exercises in the anticipation of\nperceptions, and even in supplying the want of them, so far as to\nshield us against the false conclusions which otherwise we might rashly\ndraw.\nIf all reality in perception has a degree, between which and negation\nthere is an endless sequence of ever smaller degrees, and if,\nnevertheless, every sense must have a determinate degree of receptivity\nfor sensations; no perception, and consequently no experience is\npossible, which can prove, either immediately or mediately, an entire\nabsence of all reality in a phenomenon; in other words, it is\nimpossible ever to draw from experience a proof of the existence of\nempty space or of empty time. For in the first place, an entire absence\nof reality in a sensuous intuition cannot of course be an object of\nperception; secondly, such absence cannot be deduced from the\ncontemplation of any single phenomenon, and the difference of the\ndegrees in its reality; nor ought it ever to be admitted in explanation\nof any phenomenon. For if even the complete intuition of a determinate\nspace or time is thoroughly real, that is, if no part thereof is empty,\nyet because every reality has its degree, which, with the extensive\nquantity of the phenomenon unchanged, can diminish through endless\ngradations down to nothing (the void), there must be infinitely\ngraduated degrees, with which space or time is filled, and the\nintensive quantity in different phenomena may be smaller or greater,\nalthough the extensive quantity of the intuition remains equal and\nunaltered.\nWe shall give an example of this. Almost all natural philosophers,\nremarking a great difference in the quantity of the matter of different\nkinds in bodies with the same volume (partly on account of the momentum\nof gravity or weight, partly on account of the momentum of resistance\nto other bodies in motion), conclude unanimously that this volume\n(extensive quantity of the phenomenon) must be void in all bodies,\nalthough in different proportion. But who would suspect that these for\nthe most part mathematical and mechanical inquirers into nature should\nground this conclusion solely on a metaphysical hypothesis\u2014a sort of\nhypothesis which they profess to disparage and avoid? Yet this they do,\nin assuming that the real in space (I must not here call it\nimpenetrability or weight, because these are empirical conceptions) is\nalways identical, and can only be distinguished according to its\nextensive quantity, that is, multiplicity. Now to this presupposition,\nfor which they can have no ground in experience, and which consequently\nis merely metaphysical, I oppose a transcendental demonstration, which\nit is true will not explain the difference in the filling up of spaces,\nbut which nevertheless completely does away with the supposed necessity\nof the above-mentioned presupposition that we cannot explain the said\ndifference otherwise than by the hypothesis of empty spaces. This\ndemonstration, moreover, has the merit of setting the understanding at\nliberty to conceive this distinction in a different manner, if the\nexplanation of the fact requires any such hypothesis. For we perceive\nthat although two equal spaces may be completely filled by matters\naltogether different, so that in neither of them is there left a single\npoint wherein matter is not present, nevertheless, every reality has\nits degree (of resistance or of weight), which, without diminution of\nthe extensive quantity, can become less and less ad infinitum, before\nit passes into nothingness and disappears. Thus an expansion which\nfills a space\u2014for example, caloric, or any other reality in the\nphenomenal world\u2014can decrease in its degrees to infinity, yet without\nleaving the smallest part of the space empty; on the contrary, filling\nit with those lesser degrees as completely as another phenomenon could\nwith greater. My intention here is by no means to maintain that this is\nreally the case with the difference of matters, in regard to their\nspecific gravity; I wish only to prove, from a principle of the pure\nunderstanding, that the nature of our perceptions makes such a mode of\nexplanation possible, and that it is erroneous to regard the real in a\nphenomenon as equal quoad its degree, and different only quoad its\naggregation and extensive quantity, and this, too, on the pretended\nauthority of an \u00e0 priori principle of the understanding.\nNevertheless, this principle of the anticipation of perception must\nsomewhat startle an inquirer whom initiation into transcendental\nphilosophy has rendered cautious. We must naturally entertain some\ndoubt whether or not the understanding can enounce any such synthetical\nproposition as that respecting the degree of all reality in phenomena,\nand consequently the possibility of the internal difference of\nsensation itself\u2014abstraction being made of its empirical quality. Thus\nit is a question not unworthy of solution: \u201cHow the understanding can\npronounce synthetically and \u00e0 priori respecting phenomena, and thus\nanticipate these, even in that which is peculiarly and merely\nempirical, that, namely, which concerns sensation itself?\u201d\nThe quality of sensation is in all cases merely empirical, and cannot\nbe represented \u00e0 priori (for example, colours, taste, etc.). But the\nreal\u2014that which corresponds to sensation\u2014in opposition to negation = 0,\nonly represents something the conception of which in itself contains a\nbeing (ein seyn), and signifies nothing but the synthesis in an\nempirical consciousness. That is to say, the empirical consciousness in\nthe internal sense can be raised from 0 to every higher degree, so that\nthe very same extensive quantity of intuition, an illuminated surface,\nfor example, excites as great a sensation as an aggregate of many other\nsurfaces less illuminated. We can therefore make complete abstraction\nof the extensive quantity of a phenomenon, and represent to ourselves\nin the mere sensation in a certain momentum, a synthesis of homogeneous\nascension from 0 up to the given empirical consciousness, All\nsensations therefore as such are given only \u00e0 posteriori, but this\nproperty thereof, namely, that they have a degree, can be known \u00e0\npriori. It is worthy of remark, that in respect to quantities in\ngeneral, we can cognize \u00e0 priori only a single quality, namely,\ncontinuity; but in respect to all quality (the real in phenomena), we\ncannot cognize \u00e0 priori anything more than the intensive quantity\nthereof, namely, that they have a degree. All else is left to\nexperience.\n3. ANALOGIES OF EXPERIENCE.\nThe principle of these is: Experience is possible only through the\nrepresentation of a necessary connection of Perceptions.\nPROOF.\nExperience is an empirical cognition; that is to say, a cognition which\ndetermines an object by means of perceptions. It is therefore a\nsynthesis of perceptions, a synthesis which is not itself contained in\nperception, but which contains the synthetical unity of the manifold of\nperception in a consciousness; and this unity constitutes the essential\nof our cognition of objects of the senses, that is, of experience (not\nmerely of intuition or sensation). Now in experience our perceptions\ncome together contingently, so that no character of necessity in their\nconnection appears, or can appear from the perceptions themselves,\nbecause apprehension is only a placing together of the manifold of\nempirical intuition, and no representation of a necessity in the\nconnected existence of the phenomena which apprehension brings\ntogether, is to be discovered therein. But as experience is a cognition\nof objects by means of perceptions, it follows that the relation of the\nexistence of the existence of the manifold must be represented in\nexperience not as it is put together in time, but as it is objectively\nin time. And as time itself cannot be perceived, the determination of\nthe existence of objects in time can only take place by means of their\nconnection in time in general, consequently only by means of \u00e0 priori\nconnecting conceptions. Now as these conceptions always possess the\ncharacter of necessity, experience is possible only by means of a\nrepresentation of the necessary connection of perception.\nThe three modi of time are permanence, succession, and coexistence.\nAccordingly, there are three rules of all relations of time in\nphenomena, according to which the existence of every phenomenon is\ndetermined in respect of the unity of all time, and these antecede all\nexperience and render it possible.\nThe general principle of all three analogies rests on the necessary\nunity of apperception in relation to all possible empirical\nconsciousness (perception) at every time, consequently, as this unity\nlies \u00e0 priori at the foundation of all mental operations, the principle\nrests on the synthetical unity of all phenomena according to their\nrelation in time. For the original apperception relates to our internal\nsense (the complex of all representations), and indeed relates \u00e0 priori\nto its form, that is to say, the relation of the manifold empirical\nconsciousness in time. Now this manifold must be combined in original\napperception according to relations of time\u2014a necessity imposed by the\n\u00e0 priori transcendental unity of apperception, to which is subjected\nall that can belong to my (i.e., my own) cognition, and therefore all\nthat can become an object for me. This synthetical and \u00e0 priori\ndetermined unity in relation of perceptions in time is therefore the\nrule: \u201cAll empirical determinations of time must be subject to rules of\nthe general determination of time\u201d; and the analogies of experience, of\nwhich we are now about to treat, must be rules of this nature.\nThese principles have this peculiarity, that they do not concern\nphenomena, and the synthesis of the empirical intuition thereof, but\nmerely the existence of phenomena and their relation to each other in\nregard to this existence. Now the mode in which we apprehend a thing in\na phenomenon can be determined \u00e0 priori in such a manner that the rule\nof its synthesis can give, that is to say, can produce this \u00e0 priori\nintuition in every empirical example. But the existence of phenomena\ncannot be known \u00e0 priori, and although we could arrive by this path at\na conclusion of the fact of some existence, we could not cognize that\nexistence determinately, that is to say, we should be incapable of\nanticipating in what respect the empirical intuition of it would be\ndistinguishable from that of others.\nThe two principles above mentioned, which I called mathematical, in\nconsideration of the fact of their authorizing the application of\nmathematic phenomena, relate to these phenomena only in regard to their\npossibility, and instruct us how phenomena, as far as regards their\nintuition or the real in their perception, can be generated according\nto the rules of a mathematical synthesis. Consequently, numerical\nquantities, and with them the determination of a phenomenon as a\nquantity, can be employed in the one case as well as in the other.\nThus, for example, out of 200,000 illuminations by the moon, I might\ncompose and give \u00e0 priori, that is construct, the degree of our\nsensations of the sun-light.[30] We may therefore entitle these two\nprinciples constitutive.\n[30] Kant\u2019s meaning is: The two principles enunciated under the heads\nof \u201cAxioms of Intuition,\u201d and \u201cAnticipations of Perception,\u201d authorize\nthe application to phenomena of determinations of size and number,\nthat is of mathematic. For example, I may compute the light of the\nsun, and say that its quantity is a certain number of times greater\nthan that of the moon. In the same way, heat is measured by the\ncomparison of its different effects on water, &c., and on mercury in a\nthermometer.\u2014Tr\nThe case is very different with those principles whose province it is\nto subject the existence of phenomena to rules \u00e0 priori. For as\nexistence does not admit of being constructed, it is clear that they\nmust only concern the relations of existence and be merely regulative\nprinciples. In this case, therefore, neither axioms nor anticipations\nare to be thought of. Thus, if a perception is given us, in a certain\nrelation of time to other (although undetermined) perceptions, we\ncannot then say \u00e0 priori, what and how great (in quantity) the other\nperception necessarily connected with the former is, but only how it is\nconnected, quoad its existence, in this given modus of time. Analogies\nin philosophy mean something very different from that which they\nrepresent in mathematics. In the latter they are formulae, which\nenounce the equality of two relations of quantity, and are always\nconstitutive, so that if two terms of the proportion are given, the\nthird is also given, that is, can be constructed by the aid of these\nformulae. But in philosophy, analogy is not the equality of two\nquantitative but of two qualitative relations. In this case, from three\ngiven terms, I can give \u00e0 priori and cognize the relation to a fourth\nmember, but not this fourth term itself, although I certainly possess a\nrule to guide me in the search for this fourth term in experience, and\na mark to assist me in discovering it. An analogy of experience is\ntherefore only a rule according to which unity of experience must arise\nout of perceptions in respect to objects (phenomena) not as a\nconstitutive, but merely as a regulative principle. The same holds good\nalso of the postulates of empirical thought in general, which relate to\nthe synthesis of mere intuition (which concerns the form of phenomena),\nthe synthesis of perception (which concerns the matter of phenomena),\nand the synthesis of experience (which concerns the relation of these\nperceptions). For they are only regulative principles, and clearly\ndistinguishable from the mathematical, which are constitutive, not\nindeed in regard to the certainty which both possess \u00e0 priori, but in\nthe mode of evidence thereof, consequently also in the manner of\ndemonstration.\nBut what has been observed of all synthetical propositions, and must be\nparticularly remarked in this place, is this, that these analogies\npossess significance and validity, not as principles of the\ntranscendental, but only as principles of the empirical use of the\nunderstanding, and their truth can therefore be proved only as such,\nand that consequently the phenomena must not be subjoined directly\nunder the categories, but only under their schemata. For if the objects\nto which those principles must be applied were things in themselves, it\nwould be quite impossible to cognize aught concerning them\nsynthetically \u00e0 priori. But they are nothing but phenomena; a complete\nknowledge of which\u2014a knowledge to which all principles \u00e0 priori must at\nlast relate\u2014is the only possible experience. It follows that these\nprinciples can have nothing else for their aim than the conditions of\nthe empirical cognition in the unity of synthesis of phenomena. But\nthis synthesis is cogitated only in the schema of the pure conception\nof the understanding, of whose unity, as that of a synthesis in\ngeneral, the category contains the function unrestricted by any\nsensuous condition. These principles will therefore authorize us to\nconnect phenomena according to an analogy, with the logical and\nuniversal unity of conceptions, and consequently to employ the\ncategories in the principles themselves; but in the application of them\nto experience, we shall use only their schemata, as the key to their\nproper application, instead of the categories, or rather the latter as\nrestricting conditions, under the title of \u201cformulae\u201d of the former.\nA. FIRST ANALOGY.\nPrinciple of the Permanence of Substance.\nIn all changes of phenomena, substance is permanent, and the quantum\nthereof in nature is neither increased nor diminished.\nPROOF.\nAll phenomena exist in time, wherein alone as substratum, that is, as\nthe permanent form of the internal intuition, coexistence and\nsuccession can be represented. Consequently time, in which all changes\nof phenomena must be cogitated, remains and changes not, because it is\nthat in which succession and coexistence can be represented only as\ndeterminations thereof. Now, time in itself cannot be an object of\nperception. It follows that in objects of perception, that is, in\nphenomena, there must be found a substratum which represents time in\ngeneral, and in which all change or coexistence can be perceived by\nmeans of the relation of phenomena to it. But the substratum of all\nreality, that is, of all that pertains to the existence of things, is\nsubstance; all that pertains to existence can be cogitated only as a\ndetermination of substance. Consequently, the permanent, in relation to\nwhich alone can all relations of time in phenomena be determined, is\nsubstance in the world of phenomena, that is, the real in phenomena,\nthat which, as the substratum of all change, remains ever the same.\nAccordingly, as this cannot change in existence, its quantity in nature\ncan neither be increased nor diminished.\nOur apprehension of the manifold in a phenomenon is always successive,\nis Consequently always changing. By it alone we could, therefore, never\ndetermine whether this manifold, as an object of experience, is\ncoexistent or successive, unless it had for a foundation something\nfixed and permanent, of the existence of which all succession and\ncoexistence are nothing but so many modes (modi of time). Only in the\npermanent, then, are relations of time possible (for simultaneity and\nsuccession are the only relations in time); that is to say, the\npermanent is the substratum of our empirical representation of time\nitself, in which alone all determination of time is possible.\nPermanence is, in fact, just another expression for time, as the\nabiding correlate of all existence of phenomena, and of all change, and\nof all coexistence. For change does not affect time itself, but only\nthe phenomena in time (just as coexistence cannot be regarded as a\nmodus of time itself, seeing that in time no parts are coexistent, but\nall successive). If we were to attribute succession to time itself, we\nshould be obliged to cogitate another time, in which this succession\nwould be possible. It is only by means of the permanent that existence\nin different parts of the successive series of time receives a\nquantity, which we entitle duration. For in mere succession, existence\nis perpetually vanishing and recommencing, and therefore never has even\nthe least quantity. Without the permanent, then, no relation in time is\npossible. Now, time in itself is not an object of perception;\nconsequently the permanent in phenomena must be regarded as the\nsubstratum of all determination of time, and consequently also as the\ncondition of the possibility of all synthetical unity of perceptions,\nthat is, of experience; and all existence and all change in time can\nonly be regarded as a mode in the existence of that which abides\nunchangeably. Therefore, in all phenomena, the permanent is the object\nin itself, that is, the substance (phenomenon); but all that changes or\ncan change belongs only to the mode of the existence of this substance\nor substances, consequently to its determinations.\nI find that in all ages not only the philosopher, but even the common\nunderstanding, has preposited this permanence as a substratum of all\nchange in phenomena; indeed, I am compelled to believe that they will\nalways accept this as an indubitable fact. Only the philosopher\nexpresses himself in a more precise and definite manner, when he says:\n\u201cIn all changes in the world, the substance remains, and the accidents\nalone are changeable.\u201d But of this decidedly synthetical proposition, I\nnowhere meet with even an attempt at proof; nay, it very rarely has the\ngood fortune to stand, as it deserves to do, at the head of the pure\nand entirely \u00e0 priori laws of nature. In truth, the statement that\nsubstance is permanent, is tautological. For this very permanence is\nthe ground on which we apply the category of substance to the\nphenomenon; and we should have been obliged to prove that in all\nphenomena there is something permanent, of the existence of which the\nchangeable is nothing but a determination. But because a proof of this\nnature cannot be dogmatical, that is, cannot be drawn from conceptions,\ninasmuch as it concerns a synthetical proposition \u00e0 priori, and as\nphilosophers never reflected that such propositions are valid only in\nrelation to possible experience, and therefore cannot be proved except\nby means of a deduction of the possibility of experience, it is no\nwonder that while it has served as the foundation of all experience\n(for we feel the need of it in empirical cognition), it has never been\nsupported by proof.\nA philosopher was asked: \u201cWhat is the weight of smoke?\u201d He answered:\n\u201cSubtract from the weight of the burnt wood the weight of the remaining\nashes, and you will have the weight of the smoke.\u201d Thus he presumed it\nto be incontrovertible that even in fire the matter (substance) does\nnot perish, but that only the form of it undergoes a change. In like\nmanner was the saying: \u201cFrom nothing comes nothing,\u201d only another\ninference from the principle or permanence, or rather of the\never-abiding existence of the true subject in phenomena. For if that in\nthe phenomenon which we call substance is to be the proper substratum\nof all determination of time, it follows that all existence in past as\nwell as in future time, must be determinable by means of it alone.\nHence we are entitled to apply the term substance to a phenomenon, only\nbecause we suppose its existence in all time, a notion which the word\npermanence does not fully express, as it seems rather to be referable\nto future time. However, the internal necessity perpetually to be, is\ninseparably connected with the necessity always to have been, and so\nthe expression may stand as it is. \u201cGigni de nihilo nihil; in nihilum\nnil posse reverti,\u201d[31] are two propositions which the ancients never\nparted, and which people nowadays sometimes mistakenly disjoin, because\nthey imagine that the propositions apply to objects as things in\nthemselves, and that the former might be inimical to the dependence\n(even in respect of its substance also) of the world upon a supreme\ncause. But this apprehension is entirely needless, for the question in\nthis case is only of phenomena in the sphere of experience, the unity\nof which never could be possible, if we admitted the possibility that\nnew things (in respect of their substance) should arise. For in that\ncase, we should lose altogether that which alone can represent the\nunity of time, to wit, the identity of the substratum, as that through\nwhich alone all change possesses complete and thorough unity. This\npermanence is, however, nothing but the manner in which we represent to\nourselves the existence of things in the phenomenal world.\n[31] Persius, Satirae, iii.83-84.\nThe determinations of a substance, which are only particular modes of\nits existence, are called accidents. They are always real, because they\nconcern the existence of substance (negations are only determinations,\nwhich express the non-existence of something in the substance). Now, if\nto this real in the substance we ascribe a particular existence (for\nexample, to motion as an accident of matter), this existence is called\ninherence, in contradistinction to the existence of substance, which we\ncall subsistence. But hence arise many misconceptions, and it would be\na more accurate and just mode of expression to designate the accident\nonly as the mode in which the existence of a substance is positively\ndetermined. Meanwhile, by reason of the conditions of the logical\nexercise of our understanding, it is impossible to avoid separating, as\nit were, that which in the existence of a substance is subject to\nchange, whilst the substance remains, and regarding it in relation to\nthat which is properly permanent and radical. On this account, this\ncategory of substance stands under the title of relation, rather\nbecause it is the condition thereof than because it contains in itself\nany relation.\nNow, upon this notion of permanence rests the proper notion of the\nconception change. Origin and extinction are not changes of that which\noriginates or becomes extinct. Change is but a mode of existence, which\nfollows on another mode of existence of the same object; hence all that\nchanges is permanent, and only the condition thereof changes. Now since\nthis mutation affects only determinations, which can have a beginning\nor an end, we may say, employing an expression which seems somewhat\nparadoxical: \u201cOnly the permanent (substance) is subject to change; the\nmutable suffers no change, but rather alternation, that is, when\ncertain determinations cease, others begin.\u201d\nChange, when, cannot be perceived by us except in substances, and\norigin or extinction in an absolute sense, that does not concern merely\na determination of the permanent, cannot be a possible perception, for\nit is this very notion of the permanent which renders possible the\nrepresentation of a transition from one state into another, and from\nnon-being to being, which, consequently, can be empirically cognized\nonly as alternating determinations of that which is permanent. Grant\nthat a thing absolutely begins to be; we must then have a point of time\nin which it was not. But how and by what can we fix and determine this\npoint of time, unless by that which already exists? For a void\ntime\u2014preceding\u2014is not an object of perception; but if we connect this\nbeginning with objects which existed previously, and which continue to\nexist till the object in question in question begins to be, then the\nlatter can only be a determination of the former as the permanent. The\nsame holds good of the notion of extinction, for this presupposes the\nempirical representation of a time, in which a phenomenon no longer\nexists.\nSubstances (in the world of phenomena) are the substratum of all\ndeterminations of time. The beginning of some, and the ceasing to be of\nother substances, would utterly do away with the only condition of the\nempirical unity of time; and in that case phenomena would relate to two\ndifferent times, in which, side by side, existence would pass; which is\nabsurd. For there is only one time in which all different times must be\nplaced, not as coexistent, but as successive.\nAccordingly, permanence is a necessary condition under which alone\nphenomena, as things or objects, are determinable in a possible\nexperience. But as regards the empirical criterion of this necessary\npermanence, and with it of the substantiality of phenomena, we shall\nfind sufficient opportunity to speak in the sequel.\nB. SECOND ANALOGY.\nPrinciple of the Succession of Time According to the Law of Causality.\nAll changes take place according to the law of the connection of Cause\nand Effect.\nPROOF.\n(That all phenomena in the succession of time are only changes, that\nis, a successive being and non-being of the determinations of\nsubstance, which is permanent; consequently that a being of substance\nitself which follows on the non-being thereof, or a non-being of\nsubstance which follows on the being thereof, in other words, that the\norigin or extinction of substance itself, is impossible\u2014all this has\nbeen fully established in treating of the foregoing principle. This\nprinciple might have been expressed as follows: \u201cAll alteration\n(succession) of phenomena is merely change\u201d; for the changes of\nsubstance are not origin or extinction, because the conception of\nchange presupposes the same subject as existing with two opposite\ndeterminations, and consequently as permanent. After this premonition,\nwe shall proceed to the proof.)\nI perceive that phenomena succeed one another, that is to say, a state\nof things exists at one time, the opposite of which existed in a former\nstate. In this case, then, I really connect together two perceptions in\ntime. Now connection is not an operation of mere sense and intuition,\nbut is the product of a synthetical faculty of imagination, which\ndetermines the internal sense in respect of a relation of time. But\nimagination can connect these two states in two ways, so that either\nthe one or the other may antecede in time; for time in itself cannot be\nan object of perception, and what in an object precedes and what\nfollows cannot be empirically determined in relation to it. I am only\nconscious, then, that my imagination places one state before and the\nother after; not that the one state antecedes the other in the object.\nIn other words, the objective relation of the successive phenomena\nremains quite undetermined by means of mere perception. Now in order\nthat this relation may be cognized as determined, the relation between\nthe two states must be so cogitated that it is thereby determined as\nnecessary, which of them must be placed before and which after, and not\nconversely. But the conception which carries with it a necessity of\nsynthetical unity, can be none other than a pure conception of the\nunderstanding which does not lie in mere perception; and in this case\nit is the conception of \u201cthe relation of cause and effect,\u201d the former\nof which determines the latter in time, as its necessary consequence,\nand not as something which might possibly antecede (or which might in\nsome cases not be perceived to follow). It follows that it is only\nbecause we subject the sequence of phenomena, and consequently all\nchange, to the law of causality, that experience itself, that is,\nempirical cognition of phenomena, becomes possible; and consequently,\nthat phenomena themselves, as objects of experience, are possible only\nby virtue of this law.\nOur apprehension of the manifold of phenomena is always successive. The\nrepresentations of parts succeed one another. Whether they succeed one\nanother in the object also, is a second point for reflection, which was\nnot contained in the former. Now we may certainly give the name of\nobject to everything, even to every representation, so far as we are\nconscious thereof; but what this word may mean in the case of\nphenomena, not merely in so far as they (as representations) are\nobjects, but only in so far as they indicate an object, is a question\nrequiring deeper consideration. In so far as they, regarded merely as\nrepresentations, are at the same time objects of consciousness, they\nare not to be distinguished from apprehension, that is, reception into\nthe synthesis of imagination, and we must therefore say: \u201cThe manifold\nof phenomena is always produced successively in the mind.\u201d If phenomena\nwere things in themselves, no man would be able to conjecture from the\nsuccession of our representations how this manifold is connected in the\nobject; for we have to do only with our representations. How things may\nbe in themselves, without regard to the representations through which\nthey affect us, is utterly beyond the sphere of our cognition. Now\nalthough phenomena are not things in themselves, and are nevertheless\nthe only thing given to us to be cognized, it is my duty to show what\nsort of connection in time belongs to the manifold in phenomena\nthemselves, while the representation of this manifold in apprehension\nis always successive. For example, the apprehension of the manifold in\nthe phenomenon of a house which stands before me, is successive. Now\ncomes the question whether the manifold of this house is in itself\nsuccessive\u2014which no one will be at all willing to grant. But, so soon\nas I raise my conception of an object to the transcendental\nsignification thereof, I find that the house is not a thing in itself,\nbut only a phenomenon, that is, a representation, the transcendental\nobject of which remains utterly unknown. What then am I to understand\nby the question: \u201cHow can the manifold be connected in the phenomenon\nitself\u2014not considered as a thing in itself, but merely as a\nphenomenon?\u201d Here that which lies in my successive apprehension is\nregarded as representation, whilst the phenomenon which is given me,\nnotwithstanding that it is nothing more than a complex of these\nrepresentations, is regarded as the object thereof, with which my\nconception, drawn from the representations of apprehension, must\nharmonize. It is very soon seen that, as accordance of the cognition\nwith its object constitutes truth, the question now before us can only\nrelate to the formal conditions of empirical truth; and that the\nphenomenon, in opposition to the representations of apprehension, can\nonly be distinguished therefrom as the object of them, if it is subject\nto a rule which distinguishes it from every other apprehension, and\nwhich renders necessary a mode of connection of the manifold. That in\nthe phenomenon which contains the condition of this necessary rule of\napprehension, is the object.\nLet us now proceed to our task. That something happens, that is to say,\nthat something or some state exists which before was not, cannot be\nempirically perceived, unless a phenomenon precedes, which does not\ncontain in itself this state. For a reality which should follow upon a\nvoid time, in other words, a beginning, which no state of things\nprecedes, can just as little be apprehended as the void time itself.\nEvery apprehension of an event is therefore a perception which follows\nupon another perception. But as this is the case with all synthesis of\napprehension, as I have shown above in the example of a house, my\napprehension of an event is not yet sufficiently distinguished from\nother apprehensions. But I remark also that if in a phenomenon which\ncontains an occurrence, I call the antecedent state of my perception,\nA, and the following state, B, the perception B can only follow A in\napprehension, and the perception A cannot follow B, but only precede\nit. For example, I see a ship float down the stream of a river. My\nperception of its place lower down follows upon my perception of its\nplace higher up the course of the river, and it is impossible that, in\nthe apprehension of this phenomenon, the vessel should be perceived\nfirst below and afterwards higher up the stream. Here, therefore, the\norder in the sequence of perceptions in apprehension is determined; and\nby this order apprehension is regulated. In the former example, my\nperceptions in the apprehension of a house might begin at the roof and\nend at the foundation, or vice versa; or I might apprehend the manifold\nin this empirical intuition, by going from left to right, and from\nright to left. Accordingly, in the series of these perceptions, there\nwas no determined order, which necessitated my beginning at a certain\npoint, in order empirically to connect the manifold. But this rule is\nalways to be met with in the perception of that which happens, and it\nmakes the order of the successive perceptions in the apprehension of\nsuch a phenomenon necessary.\nI must, therefore, in the present case, deduce the subjective sequence\nof apprehension from the objective sequence of phenomena, for otherwise\nthe former is quite undetermined, and one phenomenon is not\ndistinguishable from another. The former alone proves nothing as to the\nconnection of the manifold in an object, for it is quite arbitrary. The\nlatter must consist in the order of the manifold in a phenomenon,\naccording to which order the apprehension of one thing (that which\nhappens) follows that of another thing (which precedes), in conformity\nwith a rule. In this way alone can I be authorized to say of the\nphenomenon itself, and not merely of my own apprehension, that a\ncertain order or sequence is to be found therein. That is, in other\nwords, I cannot arrange my apprehension otherwise than in this order.\nIn conformity with this rule, then, it is necessary that in that which\nantecedes an event there be found the condition of a rule, according to\nwhich in this event follows always and necessarily; but I cannot\nreverse this and go back from the event, and determine (by\napprehension) that which antecedes it. For no phenomenon goes back from\nthe succeeding point of time to the preceding point, although it does\ncertainly relate to a preceding point of time; from a given time, on\nthe other hand, there is always a necessary progression to the\ndetermined succeeding time. Therefore, because there certainly is\nsomething that follows, I must of necessity connect it with something\nelse, which antecedes, and upon which it follows, in conformity with a\nrule, that is necessarily, so that the event, as conditioned, affords\ncertain indication of a condition, and this condition determines the\nevent.\nLet us suppose that nothing precedes an event, upon which this event\nmust follow in conformity with a rule. All sequence of perception would\nthen exist only in apprehension, that is to say, would be merely\nsubjective, and it could not thereby be objectively determined what\nthing ought to precede, and what ought to follow in perception. In such\na case, we should have nothing but a play of representations, which\nwould possess no application to any object. That is to say, it would\nnot be possible through perception to distinguish one phenomenon from\nanother, as regards relations of time; because the succession in the\nact of apprehension would always be of the same sort, and therefore\nthere would be nothing in the phenomenon to determine the succession,\nand to render a certain sequence objectively necessary. And, in this\ncase, I cannot say that two states in a phenomenon follow one upon the\nother, but only that one apprehension follows upon another. But this is\nmerely subjective, and does not determine an object, and consequently\ncannot be held to be cognition of an object\u2014not even in the phenomenal\nworld.\nAccordingly, when we know in experience that something happens, we\nalways presuppose that something precedes, whereupon it follows in\nconformity with a rule. For otherwise I could not say of the object\nthat it follows; because the mere succession in my apprehension, if it\nbe not determined by a rule in relation to something preceding, does\nnot authorize succession in the object. Only, therefore, in reference\nto a rule, according to which phenomena are determined in their\nsequence, that is, as they happen, by the preceding state, can I make\nmy subjective synthesis (of apprehension) objective, and it is only\nunder this presupposition that even the experience of an event is\npossible.\nNo doubt it appears as if this were in thorough contradiction to all\nthe notions which people have hitherto entertained in regard to the\nprocedure of the human understanding. According to these opinions, it\nis by means of the perception and comparison of similar consequences\nfollowing upon certain antecedent phenomena that the understanding is\nled to the discovery of a rule, according to which certain events\nalways follow certain phenomena, and it is only by this process that we\nattain to the conception of cause. Upon such a basis, it is clear that\nthis conception must be merely empirical, and the rule which it\nfurnishes us with\u2014\u201cEverything that happens must have a cause\u201d\u2014would be\njust as contingent as experience itself. The universality and necessity\nof the rule or law would be perfectly spurious attributes of it.\nIndeed, it could not possess universal validity, inasmuch as it would\nnot in this case be \u00e0 priori, but founded on deduction. But the same is\nthe case with this law as with other pure \u00e0 priori representations\n(e.g., space and time), which we can draw in perfect clearness and\ncompleteness from experience, only because we had already placed them\ntherein, and by that means, and by that alone, had rendered experience\npossible. Indeed, the logical clearness of this representation of a\nrule, determining the series of events, is possible only when we have\nmade use thereof in experience. Nevertheless, the recognition of this\nrule, as a condition of the synthetical unity of phenomena in time, was\nthe ground of experience itself and consequently preceded it \u00e0 priori.\nIt is now our duty to show by an example that we never, even in\nexperience, attribute to an object the notion of succession or effect\n(of an event\u2014that is, the happening of something that did not exist\nbefore), and distinguish it from the subjective succession of\napprehension, unless when a rule lies at the foundation, which compels\nus to observe this order of perception in preference to any other, and\nthat, indeed, it is this necessity which first renders possible the\nrepresentation of a succession in the object.\nWe have representations within us, of which also we can be conscious.\nBut, however widely extended, however accurate and thoroughgoing this\nconsciousness may be, these representations are still nothing more than\nrepresentations, that is, internal determinations of the mind in this\nor that relation of time. Now how happens it that to these\nrepresentations we should set an object, or that, in addition to their\nsubjective reality, as modifications, we should still further attribute\nto them a certain unknown objective reality? It is clear that objective\nsignificancy cannot consist in a relation to another representation (of\nthat which we desire to term object), for in that case the question\nagain arises: \u201cHow does this other representation go out of itself, and\nobtain objective significancy over and above the subjective, which is\nproper to it, as a determination of a state of mind?\u201d If we try to\ndiscover what sort of new property the relation to an object gives to\nour subjective representations, and what new importance they thereby\nreceive, we shall find that this relation has no other effect than that\nof rendering necessary the connection of our representations in a\ncertain manner, and of subjecting them to a rule; and that conversely,\nit is only because a certain order is necessary in the relations of\ntime of our representations, that objective significancy is ascribed to\nthem.\nIn the synthesis of phenomena, the manifold of our representations is\nalways successive. Now hereby is not represented an object, for by\nmeans of this succession, which is common to all apprehension, no one\nthing is distinguished from another. But so soon as I perceive or\nassume that in this succession there is a relation to a state\nantecedent, from which the representation follows in accordance with a\nrule, so soon do I represent something as an event, or as a thing that\nhappens; in other words, I cognize an object to which I must assign a\ncertain determinate position in time, which cannot be altered, because\nof the preceding state in the object. When, therefore, I perceive that\nsomething happens, there is contained in this representation, in the\nfirst place, the fact, that something antecedes; because, it is only in\nrelation to this that the phenomenon obtains its proper relation of\ntime, in other words, exists after an antecedent time, in which it did\nnot exist. But it can receive its determined place in time only by the\npresupposition that something existed in the foregoing state, upon\nwhich it follows inevitably and always, that is, in conformity with a\nrule. From all this it is evident that, in the first place, I cannot\nreverse the order of succession, and make that which happens precede\nthat upon which it follows; and that, in the second place, if the\nantecedent state be posited, a certain determinate event inevitably and\nnecessarily follows. Hence it follows that there exists a certain order\nin our representations, whereby the present gives a sure indication of\nsome previously existing state, as a correlate, though still\nundetermined, of the existing event which is given\u2014a correlate which\nitself relates to the event as its consequence, conditions it, and\nconnects it necessarily with itself in the series of time.\nIf then it be admitted as a necessary law of sensibility, and\nconsequently a formal condition of all perception, that the preceding\nnecessarily determines the succeeding time (inasmuch as I cannot arrive\nat the succeeding except through the preceding), it must likewise be an\nindispensable law of empirical representation of the series of time\nthat the phenomena of the past determine all phenomena in the\nsucceeding time, and that the latter, as events, cannot take place,\nexcept in so far as the former determine their existence in time, that\nis to say, establish it according to a rule. For it is of course only\nin phenomena that we can empirically cognize this continuity in the\nconnection of times.\nFor all experience and for the possibility of experience, understanding\nis indispensable, and the first step which it takes in this sphere is\nnot to render the representation of objects clear, but to render the\nrepresentation of an object in general, possible. It does this by\napplying the order of time to phenomena, and their existence. In other\nwords, it assigns to each phenomenon, as a consequence, a place in\nrelation to preceding phenomena, determined \u00e0 priori in time, without\nwhich it could not harmonize with time itself, which determines a place\n\u00e0 priori to all its parts. This determination of place cannot be\nderived from the relation of phenomena to absolute time (for it is not\nan object of perception); but, on the contrary, phenomena must\nreciprocally determine the places in time of one another, and render\nthese necessary in the order of time. In other words, whatever follows\nor happens, must follow in conformity with a universal rule upon that\nwhich was contained in the foregoing state. Hence arises a series of\nphenomena, which, by means of the understanding, produces and renders\nnecessary exactly the same order and continuous connection in the\nseries of our possible perceptions, as is found \u00e0 priori in the form of\ninternal intuition (time), in which all our perceptions must have\nplace.\nThat something happens, then, is a perception which belongs to a\npossible experience, which becomes real only because I look upon the\nphenomenon as determined in regard to its place in time, consequently\nas an object, which can always be found by means of a rule in the\nconnected series of my perceptions. But this rule of the determination\nof a thing according to succession in time is as follows: \u201cIn what\nprecedes may be found the condition, under which an event always (that\nis, necessarily) follows.\u201d From all this it is obvious that the\nprinciple of cause and effect is the principle of possible experience,\nthat is, of objective cognition of phenomena, in regard to their\nrelations in the succession of time.\nThe proof of this fundamental proposition rests entirely on the\nfollowing momenta of argument. To all empirical cognition belongs the\nsynthesis of the manifold by the imagination, a synthesis which is\nalways successive, that is, in which the representations therein always\nfollow one another. But the order of succession in imagination is not\ndetermined, and the series of successive representations may be taken\nretrogressively as well as progressively. But if this synthesis is a\nsynthesis of apprehension (of the manifold of a given phenomenon), then\nthe order is determined in the object, or to speak more accurately,\nthere is therein an order of successive synthesis which determines an\nobject, and according to which something necessarily precedes, and when\nthis is posited, something else necessarily follows. If, then, my\nperception is to contain the cognition of an event, that is, of\nsomething which really happens, it must be an empirical judgement,\nwherein we think that the succession is determined; that is, it\npresupposes another phenomenon, upon which this event follows\nnecessarily, or in conformity with a rule. If, on the contrary, when I\nposited the antecedent, the event did not necessarily follow, I should\nbe obliged to consider it merely as a subjective play of my\nimagination, and if in this I represented to myself anything as\nobjective, I must look upon it as a mere dream. Thus, the relation of\nphenomena (as possible perceptions), according to which that which\nhappens is, as to its existence, necessarily determined in time by\nsomething which antecedes, in conformity with a rule\u2014in other words,\nthe relation of cause and effect\u2014is the condition of the objective\nvalidity of our empirical judgements in regard to the sequence of\nperceptions, consequently of their empirical truth, and therefore of\nexperience. The principle of the relation of causality in the\nsuccession of phenomena is therefore valid for all objects of\nexperience, because it is itself the ground of the possibility of\nexperience.\nHere, however, a difficulty arises, which must be resolved. The\nprinciple of the connection of causality among phenomena is limited in\nour formula to the succession thereof, although in practice we find\nthat the principle applies also when the phenomena exist together in\nthe same time, and that cause and effect may be simultaneous. For\nexample, there is heat in a room, which does not exist in the open air.\nI look about for the cause, and find it to be the fire, Now the fire as\nthe cause is simultaneous with its effect, the heat of the room. In\nthis case, then, there is no succession as regards time, between cause\nand effect, but they are simultaneous; and still the law holds good.\nThe greater part of operating causes in nature are simultaneous with\ntheir effects, and the succession in time of the latter is produced\nonly because the cause cannot achieve the total of its effect in one\nmoment. But at the moment when the effect first arises, it is always\nsimultaneous with the causality of its cause, because, if the cause had\nbut a moment before ceased to be, the effect could not have arisen.\nHere it must be specially remembered that we must consider the order of\ntime and not the lapse thereof. The relation remains, even though no\ntime has elapsed. The time between the causality of the cause and its\nimmediate effect may entirely vanish, and the cause and effect be thus\nsimultaneous, but the relation of the one to the other remains always\ndeterminable according to time. If, for example, I consider a leaden\nball, which lies upon a cushion and makes a hollow in it, as a cause,\nthen it is simultaneous with the effect. But I distinguish the two\nthrough the relation of time of the dynamical connection of both. For\nif I lay the ball upon the cushion, then the hollow follows upon the\nbefore smooth surface; but supposing the cushion has, from some cause\nor another, a hollow, there does not thereupon follow a leaden ball.\nThus, the law of succession of time is in all instances the only\nempirical criterion of effect in relation to the causality of the\nantecedent cause. The glass is the cause of the rising of the water\nabove its horizontal surface, although the two phenomena are\ncontemporaneous. For, as soon as I draw some water with the glass from\na larger vessel, an effect follows thereupon, namely, the change of the\nhorizontal state which the water had in the large vessel into a\nconcave, which it assumes in the glass.\nThis conception of causality leads us to the conception of action; that\nof action, to the conception of force; and through it, to the\nconception of substance. As I do not wish this critical essay, the sole\npurpose of which is to treat of the sources of our synthetical\ncognition \u00e0 priori, to be crowded with analyses which merely explain,\nbut do not enlarge the sphere of our conceptions, I reserve the\ndetailed explanation of the above conceptions for a future system of\npure reason. Such an analysis, indeed, executed with great\nparticularity, may already be found in well-known works on this\nsubject. But I cannot at present refrain from making a few remarks on\nthe empirical criterion of a substance, in so far as it seems to be\nmore evident and more easily recognized through the conception of\naction than through that of the permanence of a phenomenon.\nWhere action (consequently activity and force) exists, substance also\nmust exist, and in it alone must be sought the seat of that fruitful\nsource of phenomena. Very well. But if we are called upon to explain\nwhat we mean by substance, and wish to avoid the vice of reasoning in a\ncircle, the answer is by no means so easy. How shall we conclude\nimmediately from the action to the permanence of that which acts, this\nbeing nevertheless an essential and peculiar criterion of substance\n(phenomenon)? But after what has been said above, the solution of this\nquestion becomes easy enough, although by the common mode of\nprocedure\u2014merely analysing our conceptions\u2014it would be quite\nimpossible. The conception of action indicates the relation of the\nsubject of causality to the effect. Now because all effect consists in\nthat which happens, therefore in the changeable, the last subject\nthereof is the permanent, as the substratum of all that changes, that\nis, substance. For according to the principle of causality, actions are\nalways the first ground of all change in phenomena and, consequently,\ncannot be a property of a subject which itself changes, because if this\nwere the case, other actions and another subject would be necessary to\ndetermine this change. From all this it results that action alone, as\nan empirical criterion, is a sufficient proof of the presence of\nsubstantiality, without any necessity on my part of endeavouring to\ndiscover the permanence of substance by a comparison. Besides, by this\nmode of induction we could not attain to the completeness which the\nmagnitude and strict universality of the conception requires. For that\nthe primary subject of the causality of all arising and passing away,\nall origin and extinction, cannot itself (in the sphere of phenomena)\narise and pass away, is a sound and safe conclusion, a conclusion which\nleads us to the conception of empirical necessity and permanence in\nexistence, and consequently to the conception of a substance as\nphenomenon.\nWhen something happens, the mere fact of the occurrence, without regard\nto that which occurs, is an object requiring investigation. The\ntransition from the non-being of a state into the existence of it,\nsupposing that this state contains no quality which previously existed\nin the phenomenon, is a fact of itself demanding inquiry. Such an\nevent, as has been shown in No. A, does not concern substance (for\nsubstance does not thus originate), but its condition or state. It is\ntherefore only change, and not origin from nothing. If this origin be\nregarded as the effect of a foreign cause, it is termed creation, which\ncannot be admitted as an event among phenomena, because the very\npossibility of it would annihilate the unity of experience. If,\nhowever, I regard all things not as phenomena, but as things in\nthemselves and objects of understanding alone, they, although\nsubstances, may be considered as dependent, in respect of their\nexistence, on a foreign cause. But this would require a very different\nmeaning in the words, a meaning which could not apply to phenomena as\nobjects of possible experience.\nHow a thing can be changed, how it is possible that upon one state\nexisting in one point of time, an opposite state should follow in\nanother point of time\u2014of this we have not the smallest conception \u00e0\npriori. There is requisite for this the knowledge of real powers, which\ncan only be given empirically; for example, knowledge of moving forces,\nor, in other words, of certain successive phenomena (as movements)\nwhich indicate the presence of such forces. But the form of every\nchange, the condition under which alone it can take place as the coming\ninto existence of another state (be the content of the change, that is,\nthe state which is changed, what it may), and consequently the\nsuccession of the states themselves can very well be considered \u00e0\npriori, in relation to the law of causality and the conditions of\ntime.[32]\n[32] It must be remarked that I do not speak of the change of certain\nrelations, but of the change of the state. Thus, when a body moves in\na uniform manner, it does not change its state (of motion); but only\nwhen all motion increases or decreases.\nWhen a substance passes from one state, a, into another state, b, the\npoint of time in which the latter exists is different from, and\nsubsequent to that in which the former existed. In like manner, the\nsecond state, as reality (in the phenomenon), differs from the first,\nin which the reality of the second did not exist, as b from zero. That\nis to say, if the state, b, differs from the state, a, only in respect\nto quantity, the change is a coming into existence of b -a, which in\nthe former state did not exist, and in relation to which that state is\n= O.\nNow the question arises how a thing passes from one state = a, into\nanother state = b. Between two moments there is always a certain time,\nand between two states existing in these moments there is always a\ndifference having a certain quantity (for all parts of phenomena are\nin their turn quantities). Consequently, every transition from one\nstate into another, is always effected in a time contained between\ntwo moments, of which the first determines the state which the thing\nleaves, and the second determines the state into which the thing\npasses. Both moments, then, are limitations of the time of a change,\nconsequently of the intermediate state between both, and as such they\nbelong to the total of the change. Now every change has a cause, which\nevidences its causality in the whole time during which the charge takes\nplace. The cause, therefore, does not produce the change all at once or\nin one moment, but in a time, so that, as the time gradually increases\nfrom the commencing instant, a, to its completion at b, in like manner\nalso, the quantity of the reality (b - a) is generated through the\nlesser degrees which are contained between the first and last. All\nchange is therefore possible only through a continuous action of the\ncausality, which, in so far as it is uniform, we call a momentum. The\nchange does not consist of these momenta, but is generated or produced\nby them as their effect.\nSuch is the law of the continuity of all change, the ground of which is\nthat neither time itself nor any phenomenon in time consists of parts\nwhich are the smallest possible, but that, notwithstanding, the state\nof a thing passes in the process of a change through all these parts,\nas elements, to its second state. There is no smallest degree of\nreality in a phenomenon, just as there is no smallest degree in the\nquantity of time; and so the new state of reality grows up out of the\nformer state, through all the infinite degrees thereof, the differences\nof which one from another, taken all together, are less than the\ndifference between 0 and a.\nIt is not our business to inquire here into the utility of this\nprinciple in the investigation of nature. But how such a proposition,\nwhich appears so greatly to extend our knowledge of nature, is possible\ncompletely \u00e0 priori, is indeed a question which deserves investigation,\nalthough the first view seems to demonstrate the truth and reality of\nthe principle, and the question, how it is possible, may be considered\nsuperfluous. For there are so many groundless pretensions to the\nenlargement of our knowledge by pure reason that we must take it as a\ngeneral rule to be mistrustful of all such, and without a thoroughgoing\nand radical deduction, to believe nothing of the sort even on the\nclearest dogmatical evidence.\nEvery addition to our empirical knowledge, and every advance made in\nthe exercise of our perception, is nothing more than an extension of\nthe determination of the internal sense, that is to say, a progression\nin time, be objects themselves what they may, phenomena, or pure\nintuitions. This progression in time determines everything, and is\nitself determined by nothing else. That is to say, the parts of the\nprogression exist only in time, and by means of the synthesis thereof,\nand are not given antecedently to it. For this reason, every transition\nin perception to anything which follows upon another in time, is a\ndetermination of time by means of the production of this perception.\nAnd as this determination of time is, always and in all its parts, a\nquantity, the perception produced is to be considered as a quantity\nwhich proceeds through all its degrees\u2014no one of which is the smallest\npossible\u2014from zero up to its determined degree. From this we perceive\nthe possibility of cognizing \u00e0 priori a law of changes\u2014a law, however,\nwhich concerns their form merely. We merely anticipate our own\napprehension, the formal condition of which, inasmuch as it is itself\nto be found in the mind antecedently to all given phenomena, must\ncertainly be capable of being cognized \u00e0 priori.\nThus, as time contains the sensuous condition \u00e0 priori of the\npossibility of a continuous progression of that which exists to that\nwhich follows it, the understanding, by virtue of the unity of\napperception, contains the condition \u00e0 priori of the possibility of a\ncontinuous determination of the position in time of all phenomena, and\nthis by means of the series of causes and effects, the former of which\nnecessitate the sequence of the latter, and thereby render universally\nand for all time, and by consequence, objectively, valid the empirical\ncognition of the relations of time.\nC. THIRD ANALOGY.\nPrinciple of Coexistence, According to the Law of Reciprocity or\nCommunity.\nAll substances, in so far as they can be perceived in space at the same\ntime, exist in a state of complete reciprocity of action.\nPROOF.\nThings are coexistent, when in empirical intuition the perception of\nthe one can follow upon the perception of the other, and vice\nversa\u2014which cannot occur in the succession of phenomena, as we have\nshown in the explanation of the second principle. Thus I can perceive\nthe moon and then the earth, or conversely, first the earth and then\nthe moon; and for the reason that my perceptions of these objects can\nreciprocally follow each other, I say, they exist contemporaneously.\nNow coexistence is the existence of the manifold in the same time. But\ntime itself is not an object of perception; and therefore we cannot\nconclude from the fact that things are placed in the same time, the\nother fact, that the perception of these things can follow each other\nreciprocally. The synthesis of the imagination in apprehension would\nonly present to us each of these perceptions as present in the subject\nwhen the other is not present, and contrariwise; but would not show\nthat the objects are coexistent, that is to say, that, if the one\nexists, the other also exists in the same time, and that this is\nnecessarily so, in order that the perceptions may be capable of\nfollowing each other reciprocally. It follows that a conception of the\nunderstanding or category of the reciprocal sequence of the\ndeterminations of phenomena (existing, as they do, apart from each\nother, and yet contemporaneously), is requisite to justify us in saying\nthat the reciprocal succession of perceptions has its foundation in the\nobject, and to enable us to represent coexistence as objective. But\nthat relation of substances in which the one contains determinations\nthe ground of which is in the other substance, is the relation of\ninfluence. And, when this influence is reciprocal, it is the relation\nof community or reciprocity. Consequently the coexistence of substances\nin space cannot be cognized in experience otherwise than under the\nprecondition of their reciprocal action. This is therefore the\ncondition of the possibility of things themselves as objects of\nexperience.\nThings are coexistent, in so far as they exist in one and the same\ntime. But how can we know that they exist in one and the same time?\nOnly by observing that the order in the synthesis of apprehension of\nthe manifold is arbitrary and a matter of indifference, that is to say,\nthat it can proceed from A, through B, C, D, to E, or contrariwise from\nE to A. For if they were successive in time (and in the order, let us\nsuppose, which begins with A), it is quite impossible for the\napprehension in perception to begin with E and go backwards to A,\ninasmuch as A belongs to past time and, therefore, cannot be an object\nof apprehension.\nLet us assume that in a number of substances considered as phenomena\neach is completely isolated, that is, that no one acts upon another.\nThen I say that the coexistence of these cannot be an object of\npossible perception and that the existence of one cannot, by any mode\nof empirical synthesis, lead us to the existence of another. For we\nimagine them in this case to be separated by a completely void space,\nand thus perception, which proceeds from the one to the other in time,\nwould indeed determine their existence by means of a following\nperception, but would be quite unable to distinguish whether the one\nphenomenon follows objectively upon the first, or is coexistent with\nit.\nBesides the mere fact of existence, then, there must be something by\nmeans of which A determines the position of B in time and, conversely,\nB the position of A; because only under this condition can substances\nbe empirically represented as existing contemporaneously. Now that\nalone determines the position of another thing in time which is the\ncause of it or of its determinations. Consequently every substance\n(inasmuch as it can have succession predicated of it only in respect of\nits determinations) must contain the causality of certain\ndeterminations in another substance, and at the same time the effects\nof the causality of the other in itself. That is to say, substances\nmust stand (mediately or immediately) in dynamical community with each\nother, if coexistence is to be cognized in any possible experience.\nBut, in regard to objects of experience, that is absolutely necessary\nwithout which the experience of these objects would itself be\nimpossible. Consequently it is absolutely necessary that all substances\nin the world of phenomena, in so far as they are coexistent, stand in a\nrelation of complete community of reciprocal action to each other.\nThe word community has in our language[33] two meanings, and contains\nthe two notions conveyed in the Latin communio and commercium. We\nemploy it in this place in the latter sense\u2014that of a dynamical\ncommunity, without which even the community of place (communio spatii)\ncould not be empirically cognized. In our experiences it is easy to\nobserve that it is only the continuous influences in all parts of space\nthat can conduct our senses from one object to another; that the light\nwhich plays between our eyes and the heavenly bodies produces a\nmediating community between them and us, and thereby evidences their\ncoexistence with us; that we cannot empirically change our position\n(perceive this change), unless the existence of matter throughout the\nwhole of space rendered possible the perception of the positions we\noccupy; and that this perception can prove the contemporaneous\nexistence of these places only through their reciprocal influence, and\nthereby also the coexistence of even the most remote objects\u2014although\nin this case the proof is only mediate. Without community, every\nperception (of a phenomenon in space) is separated from every other and\nisolated, and the chain of empirical representations, that is, of\nexperience, must, with the appearance of a new object, begin entirely\nde novo, without the least connection with preceding representations,\nand without standing towards these even in the relation of time. My\nintention here is by no means to combat the notion of empty space; for\nit may exist where our perceptions cannot exist, inasmuch as they\ncannot reach thereto, and where, therefore, no empirical perception of\ncoexistence takes place. But in this case it is not an object of\npossible experience.\n[33] German\nThe following remarks may be useful in the way of explanation. In the\nmind, all phenomena, as contents of a possible experience, must exist\nin community (communio) of apperception or consciousness, and in so far\nas it is requisite that objects be represented as coexistent and\nconnected, in so far must they reciprocally determine the position in\ntime of each other and thereby constitute a whole. If this subjective\ncommunity is to rest upon an objective basis, or to be applied to\nsubstances as phenomena, the perception of one substance must render\npossible the perception of another, and conversely. For otherwise\nsuccession, which is always found in perceptions as apprehensions,\nwould be predicated of external objects, and their representation of\ntheir coexistence be thus impossible. But this is a reciprocal\ninfluence, that is to say, a real community (commercium) of substances,\nwithout which therefore the empirical relation of coexistence would be\na notion beyond the reach of our minds. By virtue of this commercium,\nphenomena, in so far as they are apart from, and nevertheless in\nconnection with each other, constitute a compositum reale. Such\ncomposita are possible in many different ways. The three dynamical\nrelations then, from which all others spring, are those of inherence,\nconsequence, and composition.\nThese, then, are the three analogies of experience. They are nothing\nmore than principles of the determination of the existence of phenomena\nin time, according to the three modi of this determination; to wit, the\nrelation to time itself as a quantity (the quantity of existence, that\nis, duration), the relation in time as a series or succession, finally,\nthe relation in time as the complex of all existence (simultaneity).\nThis unity of determination in regard to time is thoroughly dynamical;\nthat is to say, time is not considered as that in which experience\ndetermines immediately to every existence its position; for this is\nimpossible, inasmuch as absolute time is not an object of perception,\nby means of which phenomena can be connected with each other. On the\ncontrary, the rule of the understanding, through which alone the\nexistence of phenomena can receive synthetical unity as regards\nrelations of time, determines for every phenomenon its position in\ntime, and consequently \u00e0 priori, and with validity for all and every\ntime.\nBy nature, in the empirical sense of the word, we understand the\ntotality of phenomena connected, in respect of their existence,\naccording to necessary rules, that is, laws. There are therefore\ncertain laws (which are moreover \u00e0 priori) which make nature possible;\nand all empirical laws can exist only by means of experience, and by\nvirtue of those primitive laws through which experience itself becomes\npossible. The purpose of the analogies is therefore to represent to us\nthe unity of nature in the connection of all phenomena under certain\nexponents, the only business of which is to express the relation of\ntime (in so far as it contains all existence in itself) to the unity of\napperception, which can exist in synthesis only according to rules. The\ncombined expression of all is this: \u201cAll phenomena exist in one nature,\nand must so exist, inasmuch as without this \u00e0 priori unity, no unity of\nexperience, and consequently no determination of objects in experience,\nis possible.\u201d\nAs regards the mode of proof which we have employed in treating of\nthese transcendental laws of nature, and the peculiar character of\nit we must make one remark, which will at the same time be important\nas a guide in every other attempt to demonstrate the truth of\nintellectual and likewise synthetical propositions \u00e0 priori. Had we\nendeavoured to prove these analogies dogmatically, that is, from\nconceptions; that is to say, had we employed this method in attempting\nto show that everything which exists, exists only in that which is\npermanent\u2014that every thing or event presupposes the existence of\nsomething in a preceding state, upon which it follows in conformity\nwith a rule\u2014lastly, that in the manifold, which is coexistent, the\nstates coexist in connection with each other according to a rule, all\nour labour would have been utterly in vain. For mere conceptions of\nthings, analyse them as we may, cannot enable us to conclude from the\nexistence of one object to the existence of another. What other course\nwas left for us to pursue? This only, to demonstrate the possibility\nof experience as a cognition in which at last all objects must be\ncapable of being presented to us, if the representation of them is\nto possess any objective reality. Now in this third, this mediating\nterm, the essential form of which consists in the synthetical unity\nof the apperception of all phenomena, we found \u00e0 priori conditions\nof the universal and necessary determination as to time of all\nexistences in the world of phenomena, without which the empirical\ndetermination thereof as to time would itself be impossible, and we\nalso discovered rules of synthetical unity \u00e0 priori, by means of\nwhich we could anticipate experience. For want of this method, and\nfrom the fancy that it was possible to discover a dogmatical proof\nof the synthetical propositions which are requisite in the empirical\nemployment of the understanding, has it happened that a proof of the\nprinciple of sufficient reason has been so often attempted, and always\nin vain. The other two analogies nobody has ever thought of, although\nthey have always been silently employed by the mind,[34] because the\nguiding thread furnished by the categories was wanting, the guide which\nalone can enable us to discover every hiatus, both in the system of\nconceptions and of principles.\n[34] The unity of the universe, in which all phenomena to be\nconnected, is evidently a mere consequence of the admitted principle\nof the community of all substances which are coexistent. For were\nsubstances isolated, they could not as parts constitute a whole, and\nwere their connection (reciprocal action of the manifold) not\nnecessary from the very fact of coexistence, we could not conclude\nfrom the fact of the latter as a merely ideal relation to the former\nas a real one. We have, however, shown in its place that community is\nthe proper ground of the possibility of an empirical cognition of\ncoexistence, and that we may therefore properly reason from the latter\nto the former as its condition.\n4. THE POSTULATES OF EMPIRICAL THOUGHT.\n1. That which agrees with the formal conditions (intuition and\nconception) of experience, is possible.\n2. That which coheres with the material conditions of experience\n(sensation), is real.\n3. That whose coherence with the real is determined according to\nuniversal conditions of experience is (exists) necessary.\nExplanation.\nThe categories of modality possess this peculiarity, that they do not\nin the least determine the object, or enlarge the conception to which\nthey are annexed as predicates, but only express its relation to the\nfaculty of cognition. Though my conception of a thing is in itself\ncomplete, I am still entitled to ask whether the object of it is merely\npossible, or whether it is also real, or, if the latter, whether it is\nalso necessary. But hereby the object itself is not more definitely\ndetermined in thought, but the question is only in what relation it,\nincluding all its determinations, stands to the understanding and its\nemployment in experience, to the empirical faculty of judgement, and to\nthe reason of its application to experience.\nFor this very reason, too, the categories of modality are nothing more\nthan explanations of the conceptions of possibility, reality, and\nnecessity, as employed in experience, and at the same time,\nrestrictions of all the categories to empirical use alone, not\nauthorizing the transcendental employment of them. For if they are to\nhave something more than a merely logical significance, and to be\nsomething more than a mere analytical expression of the form of\nthought, and to have a relation to things and their possibility,\nreality, or necessity, they must concern possible experience and its\nsynthetical unity, in which alone objects of cognition can be given.\nThe postulate of the possibility of things requires also, that the\nconception of the things agree with the formal conditions of our\nexperience in general. But this, that is to say, the objective form of\nexperience, contains all the kinds of synthesis which are requisite for\nthe cognition of objects. A conception which contains a synthesis must\nbe regarded as empty and, without reference to an object, if its\nsynthesis does not belong to experience\u2014either as borrowed from it, and\nin this case it is called an empirical conception, or such as is the\nground and \u00e0 priori condition of experience (its form), and in this\ncase it is a pure conception, a conception which nevertheless belongs\nto experience, inasmuch as its object can be found in this alone. For\nwhere shall we find the criterion or character of the possibility of an\nobject which is cogitated by means of an \u00e0 priori synthetical\nconception, if not in the synthesis which constitutes the form of\nempirical cognition of objects? That in such a conception no\ncontradiction exists is indeed a necessary logical condition, but very\nfar from being sufficient to establish the objective reality of the\nconception, that is, the possibility of such an object as is thought in\nthe conception. Thus, in the conception of a figure which is contained\nwithin two straight lines, there is no contradiction, for the\nconceptions of two straight lines and of their junction contain no\nnegation of a figure. The impossibility in such a case does not rest\nupon the conception in itself, but upon the construction of it in\nspace, that is to say, upon the conditions of space and its\ndeterminations. But these have themselves objective reality, that is,\nthey apply to possible things, because they contain \u00e0 priori the form\nof experience in general.\nAnd now we shall proceed to point out the extensive utility and\ninfluence of this postulate of possibility. When I represent to myself\na thing that is permanent, so that everything in it which changes\nbelongs merely to its state or condition, from such a conception alone\nI never can cognize that such a thing is possible. Or, if I represent\nto myself something which is so constituted that, when it is posited,\nsomething else follows always and infallibly, my thought contains no\nself-contradiction; but whether such a property as causality is to be\nfound in any possible thing, my thought alone affords no means of\njudging. Finally, I can represent to myself different things\n(substances) which are so constituted that the state or condition of\none causes a change in the state of the other, and reciprocally; but\nwhether such a relation is a property of things cannot be perceived\nfrom these conceptions, which contain a merely arbitrary synthesis.\nOnly from the fact, therefore, that these conceptions express \u00e0 priori\nthe relations of perceptions in every experience, do we know that they\npossess objective reality, that is, transcendental truth; and that\nindependent of experience, though not independent of all relation to\nform of an experience in general and its synthetical unity, in which\nalone objects can be empirically cognized.\nBut when we fashion to ourselves new conceptions of substances, forces,\naction, and reaction, from the material presented to us by perception,\nwithout following the example of experience in their connection, we\ncreate mere chimeras, of the possibility of which we cannot discover\nany criterion, because we have not taken experience for our\ninstructress, though we have borrowed the conceptions from her. Such\nfictitious conceptions derive their character of possibility not, like\nthe categories, \u00e0 priori, as conceptions on which all experience\ndepends, but only, \u00e0 posteriori, as conceptions given by means of\nexperience itself, and their possibility must either be cognized \u00e0\nposteriori and empirically, or it cannot be cognized at all. A\nsubstance which is permanently present in space, yet without filling it\n(like that tertium quid between matter and the thinking subject which\nsome have tried to introduce into metaphysics), or a peculiar\nfundamental power of the mind of intuiting the future by anticipation\n(instead of merely inferring from past and present events), or,\nfinally, a power of the mind to place itself in community of thought\nwith other men, however distant they may be\u2014these are conceptions the\npossibility of which has no ground to rest upon. For they are not based\nupon experience and its known laws; and, without experience, they are a\nmerely arbitrary conjunction of thoughts, which, though containing no\ninternal contradiction, has no claim to objective reality, neither,\nconsequently, to the possibility of such an object as is thought in\nthese conceptions. As far as concerns reality, it is self-evident that\nwe cannot cogitate such a possibility in concreto without the aid of\nexperience; because reality is concerned only with sensation, as the\nmatter of experience, and not with the form of thought, with which we\ncan no doubt indulge in shaping fancies.\nBut I pass by everything which derives its possibility from reality in\nexperience, and I purpose treating here merely of the possibility of\nthings by means of \u00e0 priori conceptions. I maintain, then, that the\npossibility of things is not derived from such conceptions per se, but\nonly when considered as formal and objective conditions of an\nexperience in general.\nIt seems, indeed, as if the possibility of a triangle could be cognized\nfrom the conception of it alone (which is certainly independent of\nexperience); for we can certainly give to the conception a\ncorresponding object completely \u00e0 priori, that is to say, we can\nconstruct it. But as a triangle is only the form of an object, it must\nremain a mere product of the imagination, and the possibility of the\nexistence of an object corresponding to it must remain doubtful, unless\nwe can discover some other ground, unless we know that the figure can\nbe cogitated under the conditions upon which all objects of experience\nrest. Now, the facts that space is a formal condition \u00e0 priori of\nexternal experience, that the formative synthesis, by which we\nconstruct a triangle in imagination, is the very same as that we employ\nin the apprehension of a phenomenon for the purpose of making an\nempirical conception of it, are what alone connect the notion of the\npossibility of such a thing, with the conception of it. In the same\nmanner, the possibility of continuous quantities, indeed of quantities\nin general, for the conceptions of them are without exception\nsynthetical, is never evident from the conceptions in themselves, but\nonly when they are considered as the formal conditions of the\ndetermination of objects in experience. And where, indeed, should we\nlook for objects to correspond to our conceptions, if not in\nexperience, by which alone objects are presented to us? It is, however,\ntrue that without antecedent experience we can cognize and characterize\nthe possibility of things, relatively to the formal conditions, under\nwhich something is determined in experience as an object, consequently,\ncompletely \u00e0 priori. But still this is possible only in relation to\nexperience and within its limits.\nThe postulate concerning the cognition of the reality of things\nrequires perception, consequently conscious sensation, not indeed\nimmediately, that is, of the object itself, whose existence is to be\ncognized, but still that the object have some connection with a real\nperception, in accordance with the analogies of experience, which\nexhibit all kinds of real connection in experience.\nFrom the mere conception of a thing it is impossible to conclude its\nexistence. For, let the conception be ever so complete, and containing\na statement of all the determinations of the thing, the existence of it\nhas nothing to do with all this, but only with the question whether\nsuch a thing is given, so that the perception of it can in every case\nprecede the conception. For the fact that the conception of it precedes\nthe perception, merely indicates the possibility of its existence; it\nis perception which presents matter to the conception, that is the sole\ncriterion of reality. Prior to the perception of the thing, however,\nand therefore comparatively \u00e0 priori, we are able to cognize its\nexistence, provided it stands in connection with some perceptions\naccording to the principles of the empirical conjunction of these, that\nis, in conformity with the analogies of perception. For, in this case,\nthe existence of the supposed thing is connected with our perception in\na possible experience, and we are able, with the guidance of these\nanalogies, to reason in the series of possible perceptions from a thing\nwhich we do really perceive to the thing we do not perceive. Thus, we\ncognize the existence of a magnetic matter penetrating all bodies from\nthe perception of the attraction of the steel-filings by the magnet,\nalthough the constitution of our organs renders an immediate perception\nof this matter impossible for us. For, according to the laws of\nsensibility and the connected context of our perceptions, we should in\nan experience come also on an immediate empirical intuition of this\nmatter, if our senses were more acute\u2014but this obtuseness has no\ninfluence upon and cannot alter the form of possible experience in\ngeneral. Our knowledge of the existence of things reaches as far as our\nperceptions, and what may be inferred from them according to empirical\nlaws, extend. If we do not set out from experience, or do not proceed\naccording to the laws of the empirical connection of phenomena, our\npretensions to discover the existence of a thing which we do not\nimmediately perceive are vain. Idealism, however, brings forward\npowerful objections to these rules for proving existence mediately.\nThis is, therefore, the proper place for its refutation.\nREFUTATION OF IDEALISM.\nIdealism\u2014I mean material idealism\u2014is the theory which declares the\nexistence of objects in space without us to be either () doubtful and\nindemonstrable, or (2) false and impossible. The first is the\nproblematical idealism of Descartes, who admits the undoubted certainty\nof only one empirical assertion (assertio), to wit, \u201cI am.\u201d The second\nis the dogmatical idealism of Berkeley, who maintains that space,\ntogether with all the objects of which it is the inseparable condition,\nis a thing which is in itself impossible, and that consequently the\nobjects in space are mere products of the imagination. The dogmatical\ntheory of idealism is unavoidable, if we regard space as a property of\nthings in themselves; for in that case it is, with all to which it\nserves as condition, a nonentity. But the foundation for this kind of\nidealism we have already destroyed in the transcendental \u00e6sthetic.\nProblematical idealism, which makes no such assertion, but only alleges\nour incapacity to prove the existence of anything besides ourselves by\nmeans of immediate experience, is a theory rational and evidencing a\nthorough and philosophical mode of thinking, for it observes the rule\nnot to form a decisive judgement before sufficient proof be shown. The\ndesired proof must therefore demonstrate that we have experience of\nexternal things, and not mere fancies. For this purpose, we must prove,\nthat our internal and, to Descartes, indubitable experience is itself\npossible only under the previous assumption of external experience.\nTHEOREM.\nThe simple but empirically determined consciousness of my own existence\nproves the existence of external objects in space.\nPROOF\nI am conscious of my own existence as determined in time. All\ndetermination in regard to time presupposes the existence of something\npermanent in perception. But this permanent something cannot be\nsomething in me, for the very reason that my existence in time is\nitself determined by this permanent something. It follows that the\nperception of this permanent existence is possible only through a thing\nwithout me and not through the mere representation of a thing without\nme. Consequently, the determination of my existence in time is possible\nonly through the existence of real things external to me. Now,\nconsciousness in time is necessarily connected with the consciousness\nof the possibility of this determination in time. Hence it follows that\nconsciousness in time is necessarily connected also with the existence\nof things without me, inasmuch as the existence of these things is the\ncondition of determination in time. That is to say, the consciousness\nof my own existence is at the same time an immediate consciousness of\nthe existence of other things without me.\nRemark I. The reader will observe, that in the foregoing proof the game\nwhich idealism plays is retorted upon itself, and with more justice. It\nassumed that the only immediate experience is internal and that from\nthis we can only infer the existence of external things. But, as always\nhappens, when we reason from given effects to determined causes,\nidealism has reasoned with too much haste and uncertainty, for it is\nquite possible that the cause of our representations may lie in\nourselves, and that we ascribe it falsely to external things. But our\nproof shows that external experience is properly immediate,[35] that\nonly by virtue of it\u2014not, indeed, the consciousness of our own\nexistence, but certainly the determination of our existence in time,\nthat is, internal experience\u2014is possible. It is true, that the\nrepresentation \u201cI am,\u201d which is the expression of the consciousness\nwhich can accompany all my thoughts, is that which immediately includes\nthe existence of a subject. But in this representation we cannot find\nany knowledge of the subject, and therefore also no empirical\nknowledge, that is, experience. For experience contains, in addition to\nthe thought of something existing, intuition, and in this case it must\nbe internal intuition, that is, time, in relation to which the subject\nmust be determined. But the existence of external things is absolutely\nrequisite for this purpose, so that it follows that internal experience\nis itself possible only mediately and through external experience.\n[35] The immediate consciousness of the existence of external things\nis, in the preceding theorem, not presupposed, but proved, by the\npossibility of this consciousness understood by us or not. The\nquestion as to the possibility of it would stand thus: \u201cHave we an\ninternal sense, but no external sense, and is our belief in external\nperception a mere delusion?\u201d But it is evident that, in order merely\nto fancy to ourselves anything as external, that is, to present it to\nthe sense in intuition we must already possess an external sense, and\nmust thereby distinguish immediately the mere receptivity of an\nexternal intuition from the spontaneity which characterizes every act\nof imagination. For merely to imagine also an external sense, would\nannihilate the faculty of intuition itself which is to be determined\nby the imagination.\nRemark II. Now with this view all empirical use of our faculty of\ncognition in the determination of time is in perfect accordance. Its\ntruth is supported by the fact that it is possible to perceive a\ndetermination of time only by means of a change in external relations\n(motion) to the permanent in space (for example, we become aware of the\nsun\u2019s motion by observing the changes of his relation to the objects of\nthis earth). But this is not all. We find that we possess nothing\npermanent that can correspond and be submitted to the conception of a\nsubstance as intuition, except matter. This idea of permanence is not\nitself derived from external experience, but is an \u00e0 priori necessary\ncondition of all determination of time, consequently also of the\ninternal sense in reference to our own existence, and that through the\nexistence of external things. In the representation \u201cI,\u201d the\nconsciousness of myself is not an intuition, but a merely intellectual\nrepresentation produced by the spontaneous activity of a thinking\nsubject. It follows, that this \u201ci\u201d has not any predicate of intuition,\nwhich, in its character of permanence, could serve as correlate to the\ndetermination of time in the internal sense\u2014in the same way as\nimpenetrability is the correlate of matter as an empirical intuition.\nRemark III. From the fact that the existence of external things is a\nnecessary condition of the possibility of a determined consciousness of\nourselves, it does not follow that every intuitive representation of\nexternal things involves the existence of these things, for their\nrepresentations may very well be the mere products of the imagination\n(in dreams as well as in madness); though, indeed, these are themselves\ncreated by the reproduction of previous external perceptions, which, as\nhas been shown, are possible only through the reality of external\nobjects. The sole aim of our remarks has, however, been to prove that\ninternal experience in general is possible only through external\nexperience in general. Whether this or that supposed experience be\npurely imaginary must be discovered from its particular determinations\nand by comparing these with the criteria of all real experience.\nFinally, as regards the third postulate, it applies to material\nnecessity in existence, and not to merely formal and logical necessity\nin the connection of conceptions. Now as we cannot cognize completely \u00e0\npriori the existence of any object of sense, though we can do so\ncomparatively \u00e0 priori, that is, relatively to some other previously\ngiven existence\u2014a cognition, however, which can only be of such an\nexistence as must be contained in the complex of experience, of which\nthe previously given perception is a part\u2014the necessity of existence\ncan never be cognized from conceptions, but always, on the contrary,\nfrom its connection with that which is an object of perception. But the\nonly existence cognized, under the condition of other given phenomena,\nas necessary, is the existence of effects from given causes in\nconformity with the laws of causality. It is consequently not the\nnecessity of the existence of things (as substances), but the necessity\nof the state of things that we cognize, and that not immediately, but\nby means of the existence of other states given in perception,\naccording to empirical laws of causality. Hence it follows that the\ncriterion of necessity is to be found only in the law of possible\nexperience\u2014that everything which happens is determined \u00e0 priori in the\nphenomenon by its cause. Thus we cognize only the necessity of effects\nin nature, the causes of which are given us. Moreover, the criterion of\nnecessity in existence possesses no application beyond the field of\npossible experience, and even in this it is not valid of the existence\nof things as substances, because these can never be considered as\nempirical effects, or as something that happens and has a beginning.\nNecessity, therefore, regards only the relations of phenomena according\nto the dynamical law of causality, and the possibility grounded\nthereon, of reasoning from some given existence (of a cause) \u00e0 priori\nto another existence (of an effect). \u201cEverything that happens is\nhypothetically necessary,\u201d is a principle which subjects the changes\nthat take place in the world to a law, that is, to a rule of necessary\nexistence, without which nature herself could not possibly exist. Hence\nthe proposition, \u201cNothing happens by blind chance (in mundo non datur\ncasus),\u201d is an \u00e0 priori law of nature. The case is the same with the\nproposition, \u201cNecessity in nature is not blind,\u201d that is, it is\nconditioned, consequently intelligible necessity (non datur fatum).\nBoth laws subject the play of change to \u201ca nature of things (as\nphenomena),\u201d or, which is the same thing, to the unity of the\nunderstanding, and through the understanding alone can changes belong\nto an experience, as the synthetical unity of phenomena. Both belong to\nthe class of dynamical principles. The former is properly a consequence\nof the principle of causality\u2014one of the analogies of experience. The\nlatter belongs to the principles of modality, which to the\ndetermination of causality adds the conception of necessity, which is\nitself, however, subject to a rule of the understanding. The principle\nof continuity forbids any leap in the series of phenomena regarded as\nchanges (in mundo non datur saltus); and likewise, in the complex of\nall empirical intuitions in space, any break or hiatus between two\nphenomena (non datur hiatus)\u2014for we can so express the principle, that\nexperience can admit nothing which proves the existence of a vacuum, or\nwhich even admits it as a part of an empirical synthesis. For, as\nregards a vacuum or void, which we may cogitate as out and beyond the\nfield of possible experience (the world), such a question cannot come\nbefore the tribunal of mere understanding, which decides only upon\nquestions that concern the employment of given phenomena for the\nconstruction of empirical cognition. It is rather a problem for ideal\nreason, which passes beyond the sphere of a possible experience and\naims at forming a judgement of that which surrounds and circumscribes\nit, and the proper place for the consideration of it is the\ntranscendental dialectic. These four propositions, \u201cIn mundo non datur\nhiatus, non datur saltus, non datur casus, non datur fatum,\u201d as well as\nall principles of transcendental origin, we could very easily exhibit\nin their proper order, that is, in conformity with the order of the\ncategories, and assign to each its proper place. But the already\npractised reader will do this for himself, or discover the clue to such\nan arrangement. But the combined result of all is simply this, to admit\ninto the empirical synthesis nothing which might cause a break in or be\nforeign to the understanding and the continuous connection of all\nphenomena, that is, the unity of the conceptions of the understanding.\nFor in the understanding alone is the unity of experience, in which all\nperceptions must have their assigned place, possible.\nWhether the field of possibility be greater than that of reality, and\nwhether the field of the latter be itself greater than that of\nnecessity, are interesting enough questions, and quite capable of\nsynthetic solution, questions, however, which come under the\njurisdiction of reason alone. For they are tantamount to asking whether\nall things as phenomena do without exception belong to the complex and\nconnected whole of a single experience, of which every given perception\nis a part which therefore cannot be conjoined with any other\nphenomena\u2014or, whether my perceptions can belong to more than one\npossible experience? The understanding gives to experience, according\nto the subjective and formal conditions, of sensibility as well as of\napperception, the rules which alone make this experience possible.\nOther forms of intuition besides those of space and time, other forms\nof understanding besides the discursive forms of thought, or of\ncognition by means of conceptions, we can neither imagine nor make\nintelligible to ourselves; and even if we could, they would still not\nbelong to experience, which is the only mode of cognition by which\nobjects are presented to us. Whether other perceptions besides those\nwhich belong to the total of our possible experience, and consequently\nwhether some other sphere of matter exists, the understanding has no\npower to decide, its proper occupation being with the synthesis of that\nwhich is given. Moreover, the poverty of the usual arguments which go\nto prove the existence of a vast sphere of possibility, of which all\nthat is real (every object of experience) is but a small part, is very\nremarkable. \u201cAll real is possible\u201d; from this follows naturally,\naccording to the logical laws of conversion, the particular\nproposition: \u201cSome possible is real.\u201d Now this seems to be equivalent\nto: \u201cMuch is possible that is not real.\u201d No doubt it does seem as if we\nought to consider the sum of the possible to be greater than that of\nthe real, from the fact that something must be added to the former to\nconstitute the latter. But this notion of adding to the possible is\nabsurd. For that which is not in the sum of the possible, and\nconsequently requires to be added to it, is manifestly impossible. In\naddition to accordance with the formal conditions of experience, the\nunderstanding requires a connection with some perception; but that\nwhich is connected with this perception is real, even although it is\nnot immediately perceived. But that another series of phenomena, in\ncomplete coherence with that which is given in perception, consequently\nmore than one all-embracing experience is possible, is an inference\nwhich cannot be concluded from the data given us by experience, and\nstill less without any data at all. That which is possible only under\nconditions which are themselves merely possible, is not possible in any\nrespect. And yet we can find no more certain ground on which to base\nthe discussion of the question whether the sphere of possibility is\nwider than that of experience.\nI have merely mentioned these questions, that in treating of the\nconception of the understanding, there might be no omission of anything\nthat, in the common opinion, belongs to them. In reality, however, the\nnotion of absolute possibility (possibility which is valid in every\nrespect) is not a mere conception of the understanding, which can be\nemployed empirically, but belongs to reason alone, which passes the\nbounds of all empirical use of the understanding. We have, therefore,\ncontented ourselves with a merely critical remark, leaving the subject\nto be explained in the sequel.\nBefore concluding this fourth section, and at the same time the system\nof all principles of the pure understanding, it seems proper to mention\nthe reasons which induced me to term the principles of modality\npostulates. This expression I do not here use in the sense which some\nmore recent philosophers, contrary to its meaning with mathematicians,\nto whom the word properly belongs, attach to it\u2014that of a proposition,\nnamely, immediately certain, requiring neither deduction nor proof. For\nif, in the case of synthetical propositions, however evident they may\nbe, we accord to them without deduction, and merely on the strength of\ntheir own pretensions, unqualified belief, all critique of the\nunderstanding is entirely lost; and, as there is no want of bold\npretensions, which the common belief (though for the philosopher this\nis no credential) does not reject, the understanding lies exposed to\nevery delusion and conceit, without the power of refusing its assent to\nthose assertions, which, though illegitimate, demand acceptance as\nveritable axioms. When, therefore, to the conception of a thing an \u00e0\npriori determination is synthetically added, such a proposition must\nobtain, if not a proof, at least a deduction of the legitimacy of its\nassertion.\nThe principles of modality are, however, not objectively synthetical,\nfor the predicates of possibility, reality, and necessity do not in the\nleast augment the conception of that of which they are affirmed,\ninasmuch as they contribute nothing to the representation of the\nobject. But as they are, nevertheless, always synthetical, they are so\nmerely subjectively. That is to say, they have a reflective power, and\napply to the conception of a thing, of which, in other respects, they\naffirm nothing, the faculty of cognition in which the conception\noriginates and has its seat. So that if the conception merely agree\nwith the formal conditions of experience, its object is called\npossible; if it is in connection with perception, and determined\nthereby, the object is real; if it is determined according to\nconceptions by means of the connection of perceptions, the object is\ncalled necessary. The principles of modality therefore predicate of a\nconception nothing more than the procedure of the faculty of cognition\nwhich generated it. Now a postulate in mathematics is a practical\nproposition which contains nothing but the synthesis by which we\npresent an object to ourselves, and produce the conception of it, for\nexample\u2014\u201cWith a given line, to describe a circle upon a plane, from a\ngiven point\u201d; and such a proposition does not admit of proof, because\nthe procedure, which it requires, is exactly that by which alone it is\npossible to generate the conception of such a figure. With the same\nright, accordingly, can we postulate the principles of modality,\nbecause they do not augment[36] the conception of a thing but merely\nindicate the manner in which it is connected with the faculty of\ncognition.\n[36] When I think the reality of a thing, I do really think more than\nthe possibility, but not in the thing; for that can never contain more\nin reality than was contained in its complete possibility. But while\nthe notion of possibility is merely the notion of a position of thing\nin relation to the understanding (its empirical use), reality is the\nconjunction of the thing with perception.\nGENERAL REMARK ON THE SYSTEM OF PRINCIPLES.\nIt is very remarkable that we cannot perceive the possibility of a\nthing from the category alone, but must always have an intuition, by\nwhich to make evident the objective reality of the pure conception of\nthe understanding. Take, for example, the categories of relation. How\n(1) a thing can exist only as a subject, and not as a mere\ndetermination of other things, that is, can be substance; or how (2),\nbecause something exists, some other thing must exist, consequently how\na thing can be a cause; or how (3), when several things exist, from the\nfact that one of these things exists, some consequence to the others\nfollows, and reciprocally, and in this way a community of substances\ncan be possible\u2014are questions whose solution cannot be obtained from\nmere conceptions. The very same is the case with the other categories;\nfor example, how a thing can be of the same sort with many others, that\nis, can be a quantity, and so on. So long as we have not intuition we\ncannot know whether we do really think an object by the categories, and\nwhere an object can anywhere be found to cohere with them, and thus the\ntruth is established, that the categories are not in themselves\ncognitions, but mere forms of thought for the construction of\ncognitions from given intuitions. For the same reason is it true that\nfrom categories alone no synthetical proposition can be made. For\nexample: \u201cIn every existence there is substance,\u201d that is, something\nthat can exist only as a subject and not as mere predicate; or,\n\u201cEverything is a quantity\u201d\u2014to construct propositions such as these, we\nrequire something to enable us to go out beyond the given conception\nand connect another with it. For the same reason the attempt to prove a\nsynthetical proposition by means of mere conceptions, for example:\n\u201cEverything that exists contingently has a cause,\u201d has never succeeded.\nWe could never get further than proving that, without this relation to\nconceptions, we could not conceive the existence of the contingent,\nthat is, could not \u00e0 priori through the understanding cognize the\nexistence of such a thing; but it does not hence follow that this is\nalso the condition of the possibility of the thing itself that is said\nto be contingent. If, accordingly; we look back to our proof of the\nprinciple of causality, we shall find that we were able to prove it as\nvalid only of objects of possible experience, and, indeed, only as\nitself the principle of the possibility of experience, Consequently of\nthe cognition of an object given in empirical intuition, and not from\nmere conceptions. That, however, the proposition: \u201cEverything that is\ncontingent must have a cause,\u201d is evident to every one merely from\nconceptions, is not to be denied. But in this case the conception of\nthe contingent is cogitated as involving not the category of modality\n(as that the non-existence of which can be conceived) but that of\nrelation (as that which can exist only as the consequence of something\nelse), and so it is really an identical proposition: \u201cThat which can\nexist only as a consequence, has a cause.\u201d In fact, when we have to\ngive examples of contingent existence, we always refer to changes, and\nnot merely to the possibility of conceiving the opposite.[37] But\nchange is an event, which, as such, is possible only through a cause,\nand considered per se its non-existence is therefore possible, and we\nbecome cognizant of its contingency from the fact that it can exist\nonly as the effect of a cause. Hence, if a thing is assumed to be\ncontingent, it is an analytical proposition to say, it has a cause.\n[37] We can easily conceive the non-existence of matter; but the\nancients did not thence infer its contingency. But even the\nalternation of the existence and non-existence of a given state in a\nthing, in which all change consists, by no means proves the\ncontingency of that state\u2014the ground of proof being the reality of its\nopposite. For example, a body is in a state of rest after motion, but\nwe cannot infer the contingency of the motion from the fact that the\nformer is the opposite of the latter. For this opposite is merely a\nlogical and not a real opposite to the other. If we wish to\ndemonstrate the contingency of the motion, what we ought to prove is\nthat, instead of the motion which took place in the preceding point of\ntime, it was possible for the body to have been then in rest, not,\nthat it is afterwards in rest; for in this case, both opposites are\nperfectly consistent with each other.\nBut it is still more remarkable that, to understand the possibility of\nthings according to the categories and thus to demonstrate the\nobjective reality of the latter, we require not merely intuitions, but\nexternal intuitions. If, for example, we take the pure conceptions of\nrelation, we find that (1) for the purpose of presenting to the\nconception of substance something permanent in intuition corresponding\nthereto and thus of demonstrating the objective reality of this\nconception, we require an intuition (of matter) in space, because space\nalone is permanent and determines things as such, while time, and with\nit all that is in the internal sense, is in a state of continual flow;\n(2) in order to represent change as the intuition corresponding to the\nconception of causality, we require the representation of motion as\nchange in space; in fact, it is through it alone that changes, the\npossibility of which no pure understanding can perceive, are capable of\nbeing intuited. Change is the connection of determinations\ncontradictorily opposed to each other in the existence of one and the\nsame thing. Now, how it is possible that out of a given state one quite\nopposite to it in the same thing should follow, reason without an\nexample can not only not conceive, but cannot even make intelligible\nwithout intuition; and this intuition is the motion of a point in\nspace; the existence of which in different spaces (as a consequence of\nopposite determinations) alone makes the intuition of change possible.\nFor, in order to make even internal change cognitable, we require to\nrepresent time, as the form of the internal sense, figuratively by a\nline, and the internal change by the drawing of that line (motion), and\nconsequently are obliged to employ external intuition to be able to\nrepresent the successive existence of ourselves in different states.\nThe proper ground of this fact is that all change to be perceived as\nchange presupposes something permanent in intuition, while in the\ninternal sense no permanent intuition is to be found. Lastly, the\nobjective possibility of the category of community cannot be conceived\nby mere reason, and consequently its objective reality cannot be\ndemonstrated without an intuition, and that external in space. For how\ncan we conceive the possibility of community, that is, when several\nsubstances exist, that some effect on the existence of the one follows\nfrom the existence of the other, and reciprocally, and therefore that,\nbecause something exists in the latter, something else must exist in\nthe former, which could not be understood from its own existence alone?\nFor this is the very essence of community\u2014which is inconceivable as a\nproperty of things which are perfectly isolated. Hence, Leibnitz, in\nattributing to the substances of the world\u2014as cogitated by the\nunderstanding alone\u2014a community, required the mediating aid of a\ndivinity; for, from their existence, such a property seemed to him with\njustice inconceivable. But we can very easily conceive the possibility\nof community (of substances as phenomena) if we represent them to\nourselves as in space, consequently in external intuition. For external\nintuition contains in itself \u00e0 priori formal external relations, as the\nconditions of the possibility of the real relations of action and\nreaction, and therefore of the possibility of community. With the same\nease can it be demonstrated, that the possibility of things as\nquantities, and consequently the objective reality of the category of\nquantity, can be grounded only in external intuition, and that by its\nmeans alone is the notion of quantity appropriated by the internal\nsense. But I must avoid prolixity, and leave the task of illustrating\nthis by examples to the reader\u2019s own reflection.\nThe above remarks are of the greatest importance, not only for the\nconfirmation of our previous confutation of idealism, but still more\nwhen the subject of self-cognition by mere internal consciousness and\nthe determination of our own nature without the aid of external\nempirical intuitions is under discussion, for the indication of the\ngrounds of the possibility of such a cognition.\nThe result of the whole of this part of the analytic of principles is,\ntherefore: \u201cAll principles of the pure understanding are nothing more\nthan \u00e0 priori principles of the possibility of experience, and to\nexperience alone do all \u00e0 priori synthetical propositions apply and\nrelate\u201d; indeed, their possibility itself rests entirely on this\nrelation.\nChapter III Of the Ground of the Division of all Objects into Phenomena\nand Noumena\nWe have now not only traversed the region of the pure understanding and\ncarefully surveyed every part of it, but we have also measured it, and\nassigned to everything therein its proper place. But this land is an\nisland, and enclosed by nature herself within unchangeable limits. It\nis the land of truth (an attractive word), surrounded by a wide and\nstormy ocean, the region of illusion, where many a fog-bank, many an\niceberg, seems to the mariner, on his voyage of discovery, a new\ncountry, and, while constantly deluding him with vain hopes, engages\nhim in dangerous adventures, from which he never can desist, and which\nyet he never can bring to a termination. But before venturing upon this\nsea, in order to explore it in its whole extent, and to arrive at a\ncertainty whether anything is to be discovered there, it will not be\nwithout advantage if we cast our eyes upon the chart of the land that\nwe are about to leave, and to ask ourselves, firstly, whether we cannot\nrest perfectly contented with what it contains, or whether we must not\nof necessity be contented with it, if we can find nowhere else a solid\nfoundation to build upon; and, secondly, by what title we possess this\nland itself, and how we hold it secure against all hostile claims?\nAlthough, in the course of our analytic, we have already given\nsufficient answers to these questions, yet a summary recapitulation of\nthese solutions may be useful in strengthening our conviction, by\nuniting in one point the momenta of the arguments.\nWe have seen that everything which the understanding draws from itself,\nwithout borrowing from experience, it nevertheless possesses only for\nthe behoof and use of experience. The principles of the pure\nunderstanding, whether constitutive \u00e0 priori (as the mathematical\nprinciples), or merely regulative (as the dynamical), contain nothing\nbut the pure schema, as it were, of possible experience. For experience\npossesses its unity from the synthetical unity which the understanding,\noriginally and from itself, imparts to the synthesis of the imagination\nin relation to apperception, and in \u00e0 priori relation to and agreement\nwith which phenomena, as data for a possible cognition, must stand. But\nalthough these rules of the understanding are not only \u00e0 priori true,\nbut the very source of all truth, that is, of the accordance of our\ncognition with objects, and on this ground, that they contain the basis\nof the possibility of experience, as the ensemble of all cognition, it\nseems to us not enough to propound what is true\u2014we desire also to be\ntold what we want to know. If, then, we learn nothing more by this\ncritical examination than what we should have practised in the merely\nempirical use of the understanding, without any such subtle inquiry,\nthe presumption is that the advantage we reap from it is not worth the\nlabour bestowed upon it. It may certainly be answered that no rash\ncuriosity is more prejudicial to the enlargement of our knowledge than\nthat which must know beforehand the utility of this or that piece of\ninformation which we seek, before we have entered on the needful\ninvestigations, and before one could form the least conception of its\nutility, even though it were placed before our eyes. But there is one\nadvantage in such transcendental inquiries which can be made\ncomprehensible to the dullest and most reluctant learner\u2014this, namely,\nthat the understanding which is occupied merely with empirical\nexercise, and does not reflect on the sources of its own cognition, may\nexercise its functions very well and very successfully, but is quite\nunable to do one thing, and that of very great importance, to\ndetermine, namely, the bounds that limit its employment, and to know\nwhat lies within or without its own sphere. This purpose can be\nobtained only by such profound investigations as we have instituted.\nBut if it cannot distinguish whether certain questions lie within its\nhorizon or not, it can never be sure either as to its claims or\npossessions, but must lay its account with many humiliating\ncorrections, when it transgresses, as it unavoidably will, the limits\nof its own territory, and loses itself in fanciful opinions and\nblinding illusions.\nThat the understanding, therefore, cannot make of its \u00e0 priori\nprinciples, or even of its conceptions, other than an empirical use, is\na proposition which leads to the most important results. A\ntranscendental use is made of a conception in a fundamental proposition\nor principle, when it is referred to things in general and considered\nas things in themselves; an empirical use, when it is referred merely\nto phenomena, that is, to objects of a possible experience. That the\nlatter use of a conception is the only admissible one is evident from\nthe reasons following. For every conception are requisite, firstly, the\nlogical form of a conception (of thought) general; and, secondly, the\npossibility of presenting to this an object to which it may apply.\nFailing this latter, it has no sense, and utterly void of content,\nalthough it may contain the logical function for constructing a\nconception from certain data. Now, object cannot be given to a\nconception otherwise than by intuition, and, even if a pure intuition\nantecedent to the object is \u00e0 priori possible, this pure intuition can\nitself obtain objective validity only from empirical intuition, of\nwhich it is itself but the form. All conceptions, therefore, and with\nthem all principles, however high the degree of their \u00e0 priori\npossibility, relate to empirical intuitions, that is, to data towards a\npossible experience. Without this they possess no objective validity,\nbut are mere play of imagination or of understanding with images or\nnotions. Let us take, for example, the conceptions of mathematics, and\nfirst in its pure intuitions. \u201cSpace has three dimensions\u201d\u2014\u201cBetween two\npoints there can be only one straight line,\u201d etc. Although all these\nprinciples, and the representation of the object with which this\nscience occupies itself, are generated in the mind entirely \u00e0 priori,\nthey would nevertheless have no significance if we were not always able\nto exhibit their significance in and by means of phenomena (empirical\nobjects). Hence it is requisite that an abstract conception be made\nsensuous, that is, that an object corresponding to it in intuition be\nforthcoming, otherwise the conception remains, as we say, without\nsense, that is, without meaning. Mathematics fulfils this requirement\nby the construction of the figure, which is a phenomenon evident to the\nsenses. The same science finds support and significance in number; this\nin its turn finds it in the fingers, or in counters, or in lines and\npoints. The conception itself is always produced \u00e0 priori, together\nwith the synthetical principles or formulas from such conceptions; but\nthe proper employment of them, and their application to objects, can\nexist nowhere but in experience, the possibility of which, as regards\nits form, they contain \u00e0 priori.\nThat this is also the case with all of the categories and the\nprinciples based upon them is evident from the fact that we cannot\nrender intelligible the possibility of an object corresponding to them\nwithout having recourse to the conditions of sensibility, consequently,\nto the form of phenomena, to which, as their only proper objects, their\nuse must therefore be confined, inasmuch as, if this condition is\nremoved, all significance, that is, all relation to an object,\ndisappears, and no example can be found to make it comprehensible what\nsort of things we ought to think under such conceptions.\nThe conception of quantity cannot be explained except by saying that it\nis the determination of a thing whereby it can be cogitated how many\ntimes one is placed in it. But this \u201chow many times\u201d is based upon\nsuccessive repetition, consequently upon time and the synthesis of the\nhomogeneous therein. Reality, in contradistinction to negation, can be\nexplained only by cogitating a time which is either filled therewith or\nis void. If I leave out the notion of permanence (which is existence in\nall time), there remains in the conception of substance nothing but the\nlogical notion of subject, a notion of which I endeavour to realize by\nrepresenting to myself something that can exist only as a subject. But\nnot only am I perfectly ignorant of any conditions under which this\nlogical prerogative can belong to a thing, I can make nothing out of\nthe notion, and draw no inference from it, because no object to which\nto apply the conception is determined, and we consequently do not know\nwhether it has any meaning at all. In like manner, if I leave out the\nnotion of time, in which something follows upon some other thing in\nconformity with a rule, I can find nothing in the pure category, except\nthat there is a something of such a sort that from it a conclusion may\nbe drawn as to the existence of some other thing. But in this case it\nwould not only be impossible to distinguish between a cause and an\neffect, but, as this power to draw conclusions requires conditions of\nwhich I am quite ignorant, the conception is not determined as to the\nmode in which it ought to apply to an object. The so-called principle:\n\u201cEverything that is contingent has a cause,\u201d comes with a gravity and\nself-assumed authority that seems to require no support from without.\nBut, I ask, what is meant by contingent? The answer is that the\nnon-existence of which is possible. But I should like very well to know\nby what means this possibility of non-existence is to be cognized, if\nwe do not represent to ourselves a succession in the series of\nphenomena, and in this succession an existence which follows a\nnon-existence, or conversely, consequently, change. For to say, that\nthe non-existence of a thing is not self-contradictory is a lame appeal\nto a logical condition, which is no doubt a necessary condition of the\nexistence of the conception, but is far from being sufficient for the\nreal objective possibility of non-existence. I can annihilate in\nthought every existing substance without self-contradiction, but I\ncannot infer from this their objective contingency in existence, that\nis to say, the possibility of their non-existence in itself. As regards\nthe category of community, it may easily be inferred that, as the pure\ncategories of substance and causality are incapable of a definition and\nexplanation sufficient to determine their object without the aid of\nintuition, the category of reciprocal causality in the relation of\nsubstances to each other (commercium) is just as little susceptible\nthereof. Possibility, existence, and necessity nobody has ever yet been\nable to explain without being guilty of manifest tautology, when the\ndefinition has been drawn entirely from the pure understanding. For the\nsubstitution of the logical possibility of the conception\u2014the condition\nof which is that it be not self-contradictory, for the transcendental\npossibility of things\u2014the condition of which is that there be an object\ncorresponding to the conception, is a trick which can only deceive the\ninexperienced.[38]\n[38] In one word, to none of these conceptions belongs a corresponding\nobject, and consequently their real possibility cannot be\ndemonstrated, if we take away sensuous intuition\u2014the only intuition\nwhich we possess\u2014and there then remains nothing but the logical\npossibility, that is, the fact that the conception or thought is\npossible\u2014which, however, is not the question; what we want to know\nbeing, whether it relates to an object and thus possesses any meaning.\nIt follows incontestably, that the pure conceptions of the\nunderstanding are incapable of transcendental, and must always be of\nempirical use alone, and that the principles of the pure understanding\nrelate only to the general conditions of a possible experience, to\nobjects of the senses, and never to things in general, apart from the\nmode in which we intuite them.\nTranscendental analytic has accordingly this important result, to wit,\nthat the understanding is competent effect nothing \u00e0 priori, except the\nanticipation of the form of a possible experience in general, and that,\nas that which is not phenomenon cannot be an object of experience, it\ncan never overstep the limits of sensibility, within which alone\nobjects are presented to us. Its principles are merely principles of\nthe exposition of phenomena, and the proud name of an ontology, which\nprofesses to present synthetical cognitions \u00e0 priori of things in\ngeneral in a systematic doctrine, must give place to the modest title\nof analytic of the pure understanding.\nThought is the act of referring a given intuition to an object. If the\nmode of this intuition is unknown to us, the object is merely\ntranscendental, and the conception of the understanding is employed\nonly transcendentally, that is, to produce unity in the thought of a\nmanifold in general. Now a pure category, in which all conditions of\nsensuous intuition\u2014as the only intuition we possess\u2014are abstracted,\ndoes not determine an object, but merely expresses the thought of an\nobject in general, according to different modes. Now, to employ a\nconception, the function of judgement is required, by which an object\nis subsumed under the conception, consequently the at least formal\ncondition, under which something can be given in intuition. Failing\nthis condition of judgement (schema), subsumption is impossible; for\nthere is in such a case nothing given, which may be subsumed under the\nconception. The merely transcendental use of the categories is\ntherefore, in fact, no use at all and has no determined, or even, as\nregards its form, determinable object. Hence it follows that the pure\ncategory is incompetent to establish a synthetical \u00e0 priori principle,\nand that the principles of the pure understanding are only of empirical\nand never of transcendental use, and that beyond the sphere of possible\nexperience no synthetical \u00e0 priori principles are possible.\nIt may be advisable, therefore, to express ourselves thus. The pure\ncategories, apart from the formal conditions of sensibility, have a\nmerely transcendental meaning, but are nevertheless not of\ntranscendental use, because this is in itself impossible, inasmuch as\nall the conditions of any employment or use of them (in judgements) are\nabsent, to wit, the formal conditions of the subsumption of an object\nunder these conceptions. As, therefore, in the character of pure\ncategories, they must be employed empirically, and cannot be employed\ntranscendentally, they are of no use at all, when separated from\nsensibility, that is, they cannot be applied to an object. They are\nmerely the pure form of the employment of the understanding in respect\nof objects in general and of thought, without its being at the same\ntime possible to think or to determine any object by their means. But\nthere lurks at the foundation of this subject an illusion which it is\nvery difficult to avoid. The categories are not based, as regards their\norigin, upon sensibility, like the forms of intuition, space, and time;\nthey seem, therefore, to be capable of an application beyond the sphere\nof sensuous objects. But this is not the case. They are nothing but\nmere forms of thought, which contain only the logical faculty of\nuniting \u00e0 priori in consciousness the manifold given in intuition.\nApart, then, from the only intuition possible for us, they have still\nless meaning than the pure sensuous forms, space and time, for through\nthem an object is at least given, while a mode of connection of the\nmanifold, when the intuition which alone gives the manifold is wanting,\nhas no meaning at all. At the same time, when we designate certain\nobjects as phenomena or sensuous existences, thus distinguishing our\nmode of intuiting them from their own nature as things in themselves,\nit is evident that by this very distinction we as it were place the\nlatter, considered in this their own nature, although we do not so\nintuite them, in opposition to the former, or, on the other hand, we do\nso place other possible things, which are not objects of our senses,\nbut are cogitated by the understanding alone, and call them\nintelligible existences (noumena). Now the question arises whether the\npure conceptions of our understanding do possess significance in\nrespect of these latter, and may possibly be a mode of cognizing them.\nBut we are met at the very commencement with an ambiguity, which may\neasily occasion great misapprehension. The understanding, when it terms\nan object in a certain relation phenomenon, at the same time forms out\nof this relation a representation or notion of an object in itself, and\nhence believes that it can form also conceptions of such objects. Now\nas the understanding possesses no other fundamental conceptions besides\nthe categories, it takes for granted that an object considered as a\nthing in itself must be capable of being thought by means of these pure\nconceptions, and is thereby led to hold the perfectly undetermined\nconception of an intelligible existence, a something out of the sphere\nof our sensibility, for a determinate conception of an existence which\nwe can cognize in some way or other by means of the understanding.\nIf, by the term noumenon, we understand a thing so far as it is not an\nobject of our sensuous intuition, thus making abstraction of our mode\nof intuiting it, this is a noumenon in the negative sense of the word.\nBut if we understand by it an object of a non-sensuous intuition, we in\nthis case assume a peculiar mode of intuition, an intellectual\nintuition, to wit, which does not, however, belong to us, of the very\npossibility of which we have no notion\u2014and this is a noumenon in the\npositive sense.\nThe doctrine of sensibility is also the doctrine of noumena in the\nnegative sense, that is, of things which the understanding is obliged\nto cogitate apart from any relation to our mode of intuition,\nconsequently not as mere phenomena, but as things in themselves. But\nthe understanding at the same time comprehends that it cannot employ\nits categories for the consideration of things in themselves, because\nthese possess significance only in relation to the unity of intuitions\nin space and time, and that they are competent to determine this unity\nby means of general \u00e0 priori connecting conceptions only on account of\nthe pure ideality of space and time. Where this unity of time is not to\nbe met with, as is the case with noumena, the whole use, indeed the\nwhole meaning of the categories is entirely lost, for even the\npossibility of things to correspond to the categories is in this case\nincomprehensible. On this point, I need only refer the reader to what I\nhave said at the commencement of the General Remark appended to the\nforegoing chapter. Now, the possibility of a thing can never be proved\nfrom the fact that the conception of it is not self-contradictory, but\nonly by means of an intuition corresponding to the conception. If,\ntherefore, we wish to apply the categories to objects which cannot be\nregarded as phenomena, we must have an intuition different from the\nsensuous, and in this case the objects would be a noumena in the\npositive sense of the word. Now, as such an intuition, that is, an\nintellectual intuition, is no part of our faculty of cognition, it is\nabsolutely impossible for the categories to possess any application\nbeyond the limits of experience. It may be true that there are\nintelligible existences to which our faculty of sensuous intuition has\nno relation, and cannot be applied, but our conceptions of the\nunderstanding, as mere forms of thought for our sensuous intuition, do\nnot extend to these. What, therefore, we call noumenon must be\nunderstood by us as such in a negative sense.\nIf I take away from an empirical intuition all thought (by means of the\ncategories), there remains no cognition of any object; for by means of\nmere intuition nothing is cogitated, and, from the existence of such or\nsuch an affection of sensibility in me, it does not follow that this\naffection or representation has any relation to an object without me.\nBut if I take away all intuition, there still remains the form of\nthought, that is, the mode of determining an object for the manifold of\na possible intuition. Thus the categories do in some measure really\nextend further than sensuous intuition, inasmuch as they think objects\nin general, without regard to the mode (of sensibility) in which these\nobjects are given. But they do not for this reason apply to and\ndetermine a wider sphere of objects, because we cannot assume that such\ncan be given, without presupposing the possibility of another than the\nsensuous mode of intuition, a supposition we are not justified in\nmaking.\nI call a conception problematical which contains in itself no\ncontradiction, and which is connected with other cognitions as a\nlimitation of given conceptions, but whose objective reality cannot be\ncognized in any manner. The conception of a noumenon, that is, of a\nthing which must be cogitated not as an object of sense, but as a thing\nin itself (solely through the pure understanding), is not\nself-contradictory, for we are not entitled to maintain that\nsensibility is the only possible mode of intuition. Nay, further, this\nconception is necessary to restrain sensuous intuition within the\nbounds of phenomena, and thus to limit the objective validity of\nsensuous cognition; for things in themselves, which lie beyond its\nprovince, are called noumena for the very purpose of indicating that\nthis cognition does not extend its application to all that the\nunderstanding thinks. But, after all, the possibility of such noumena\nis quite incomprehensible, and beyond the sphere of phenomena, all is\nfor us a mere void; that is to say, we possess an understanding whose\nprovince does problematically extend beyond this sphere, but we do not\npossess an intuition, indeed, not even the conception of a possible\nintuition, by means of which objects beyond the region of sensibility\ncould be given us, and in reference to which the understanding might be\nemployed assertorically. The conception of a noumenon is therefore\nmerely a limitative conception and therefore only of negative use. But\nit is not an arbitrary or fictitious notion, but is connected with the\nlimitation of sensibility, without, however, being capable of\npresenting us with any positive datum beyond this sphere.\nThe division of objects into phenomena and noumena, and of the world\ninto a mundus sensibilis and intelligibilis is therefore quite\ninadmissible in a positive sense, although conceptions do certainly\nadmit of such a division; for the class of noumena have no determinate\nobject corresponding to them, and cannot therefore possess objective\nvalidity. If we abandon the senses, how can it be made conceivable that\nthe categories (which are the only conceptions that could serve as\nconceptions for noumena) have any sense or meaning at all, inasmuch as\nsomething more than the mere unity of thought, namely, a possible\nintuition, is requisite for their application to an object? The\nconception of a noumenon, considered as merely problematical, is,\nhowever, not only admissible, but, as a limitative conception of\nsensibility, absolutely necessary. But, in this case, a noumenon is not\na particular intelligible object for our understanding; on the\ncontrary, the kind of understanding to which it could belong is itself\na problem, for we cannot form the most distant conception of the\npossibility of an understanding which should cognize an object, not\ndiscursively by means of categories, but intuitively in a non-sensuous\nintuition. Our understanding attains in this way a sort of negative\nextension. That is to say, it is not limited by, but rather limits,\nsensibility, by giving the name of noumena to things, not considered as\nphenomena, but as things in themselves. But it at the same time\nprescribes limits to itself, for it confesses itself unable to cognize\nthese by means of the categories, and hence is compelled to cogitate\nthem merely as an unknown something.\nI find, however, in the writings of modern authors, an entirely\ndifferent use of the expressions, mundus sensibilis and intelligibilis,\nwhich quite departs from the meaning of the ancients\u2014an acceptation in\nwhich, indeed, there is to be found no difficulty, but which at the\nsame time depends on mere verbal quibbling. According to this meaning,\nsome have chosen to call the complex of phenomena, in so far as it is\nintuited, mundus sensibilis, but in so far as the connection thereof is\ncogitated according to general laws of thought, mundus intelligibilis.\nAstronomy, in so far as we mean by the word the mere observation of the\nstarry heaven, may represent the former; a system of astronomy, such as\nthe Copernican or Newtonian, the latter. But such twisting of words is\na mere sophistical subterfuge, to avoid a difficult question, by\nmodifying its meaning to suit our own convenience. To be sure,\nunderstanding and reason are employed in the cognition of phenomena;\nbut the question is, whether these can be applied when the object is\nnot a phenomenon and in this sense we regard it if it is cogitated as\ngiven to the understanding alone, and not to the senses. The question\ntherefore is whether, over and above the empirical use of the\nunderstanding, a transcendental use is possible, which applies to the\nnoumenon as an object. This question we have answered in the negative.\nWhen therefore we say, the senses represent objects as they appear, the\nunderstanding as they are, the latter statement must not be understood\nin a transcendental, but only in an empirical signification, that is,\nas they must be represented in the complete connection of phenomena,\nand not according to what they may be, apart from their relation to\npossible experience, consequently not as objects of the pure\nunderstanding. For this must ever remain unknown to us. Nay, it is also\nquite unknown to us whether any such transcendental or extraordinary\ncognition is possible under any circumstances, at least, whether it is\npossible by means of our categories. Understanding and sensibility,\nwith us, can determine objects only in conjunction. If we separate\nthem, we have intuitions without conceptions, or conceptions without\nintuitions; in both cases, representations, which we cannot apply to\nany determinate object.\nIf, after all our inquiries and explanations, any one still hesitates\nto abandon the mere transcendental use of the categories, let him\nattempt to construct with them a synthetical proposition. It would, of\ncourse, be unnecessary for this purpose to construct an analytical\nproposition, for that does not extend the sphere of the understanding,\nbut, being concerned only about what is cogitated in the conception\nitself, it leaves it quite undecided whether the conception has any\nrelation to objects, or merely indicates the unity of thought\u2014complete\nabstraction being made of the modi in which an object may be given: in\nsuch a proposition, it is sufficient for the understanding to know what\nlies in the conception\u2014to what it applies is to it indifferent. The\nattempt must therefore be made with a synthetical and so-called\ntranscendental principle, for example: \u201cEverything that exists, exists\nas substance,\u201d or, \u201cEverything that is contingent exists as an effect\nof some other thing, viz., of its cause.\u201d Now I ask, whence can the\nunderstanding draw these synthetical propositions, when the conceptions\ncontained therein do not relate to possible experience but to things in\nthemselves (noumena)? Where is to be found the third term, which is\nalways requisite PURE site in a synthetical proposition, which may\nconnect in the same proposition conceptions which have no logical\n(analytical) connection with each other? The proposition never will be\ndemonstrated, nay, more, the possibility of any such pure assertion\nnever can be shown, without making reference to the empirical use of\nthe understanding, and thus, ipso facto, completely renouncing pure and\nnon-sensuous judgement. Thus the conception of pure and merely\nintelligible objects is completely void of all principles of its\napplication, because we cannot imagine any mode in which they might be\ngiven, and the problematical thought which leaves a place open for them\nserves only, like a void space, to limit the use of empirical\nprinciples, without containing at the same time any other object of\ncognition beyond their sphere.\nAPPENDIX\nOf the Equivocal Nature or Amphiboly of the Conceptions of Reflection\nfrom the Confusion of the Transcendental with the Empirical use of the\nUnderstanding.\nReflection (reflexio) is not occupied about objects themselves, for the\npurpose of directly obtaining conceptions of them, but is that state of\nthe mind in which we set ourselves to discover the subjective\nconditions under which we obtain conceptions. It is the consciousness\nof the relation of given representations to the different sources or\nfaculties of cognition, by which alone their relation to each other can\nbe rightly determined. The first question which occurs in considering\nour representations is to what faculty of cognition do they belong? To\nthe understanding or to the senses? Many judgements are admitted to be\ntrue from mere habit or inclination; but, because reflection neither\nprecedes nor follows, it is held to be a judgement that has its origin\nin the understanding. All judgements do not require examination, that\nis, investigation into the grounds of their truth. For, when they are\nimmediately certain (for example: \u201cBetween two points there can be only\none straight line\u201d), no better or less mediate test of their truth can\nbe found than that which they themselves contain and express. But all\njudgement, nay, all comparisons require reflection, that is, a\ndistinction of the faculty of cognition to which the given conceptions\nbelong. The act whereby I compare my representations with the faculty\nof cognition which originates them, and whereby I distinguish whether\nthey are compared with each other as belonging to the pure\nunderstanding or to sensuous intuition, I term transcendental\nreflection. Now, the relations in which conceptions can stand to each\nother are those of identity and difference, agreement and opposition,\nof the internal and external, finally, of the determinable and the\ndetermining (matter and form). The proper determination of these\nrelations rests on the question, to what faculty of cognition they\nsubjectively belong, whether to sensibility or understanding? For, on\nthe manner in which we solve this question depends the manner in which\nwe must cogitate these relations.\nBefore constructing any objective judgement, we compare the conceptions\nthat are to be placed in the judgement, and observe whether there\nexists identity (of many representations in one conception), if a\ngeneral judgement is to be constructed, or difference, if a particular;\nwhether there is agreement when affirmative; and opposition when\nnegative judgements are to be constructed, and so on. For this reason\nwe ought to call these conceptions, conceptions of comparison\n(conceptus comparationis). But as, when the question is not as to the\nlogical form, but as to the content of conceptions, that is to say,\nwhether the things themselves are identical or different, in agreement\nor opposition, and so on, the things can have a twofold relation to our\nfaculty of cognition, to wit, a relation either to sensibility or to\nthe understanding, and as on this relation depends their relation to\neach other, transcendental reflection, that is, the relation of given\nrepresentations to one or the other faculty of cognition, can alone\ndetermine this latter relation. Thus we shall not be able to discover\nwhether the things are identical or different, in agreement or\nopposition, etc., from the mere conception of the things by means of\ncomparison (comparatio), but only by distinguishing the mode of\ncognition to which they belong, in other words, by means of\ntranscendental reflection. We may, therefore, with justice say, that\nlogical reflection is mere comparison, for in it no account is taken of\nthe faculty of cognition to which the given conceptions belong, and\nthey are consequently, as far as regards their origin, to be treated as\nhomogeneous; while transcendental reflection (which applies to the\nobjects themselves) contains the ground of the possibility of objective\ncomparison of representations with each other, and is therefore very\ndifferent from the former, because the faculties of cognition to which\nthey belong are not even the same. Transcendental reflection is a duty\nwhich no one can neglect who wishes to establish an \u00e0 priori judgement\nupon things. We shall now proceed to fulfil this duty, and thereby\nthrow not a little light on the question as to the determination of the\nproper business of the understanding.\n1. Identity and Difference. When an object is presented to us several\ntimes, but always with the same internal determinations (qualitas et\nquantitas), it, if an object of pure understanding, is always the same,\nnot several things, but only one thing (numerica identitas); but if a\nphenomenon, we do not concern ourselves with comparing the conception\nof the thing with the conception of some other, but, although they may\nbe in this respect perfectly the same, the difference of place at the\nsame time is a sufficient ground for asserting the numerical difference\nof these objects (of sense). Thus, in the case of two drops of water,\nwe may make complete abstraction of all internal difference (quality\nand quantity), and, the fact that they are intuited at the same time in\ndifferent places, is sufficient to justify us in holding them to be\nnumerically different. Leibnitz regarded phenomena as things in\nthemselves, consequently as intelligibilia, that is, objects of pure\nunderstanding (although, on account of the confused nature of their\nrepresentations, he gave them the name of phenomena), and in this case\nhis principle of the indiscernible (principium identatis\nindiscernibilium) is not to be impugned. But, as phenomena are objects\nof sensibility, and, as the understanding, in respect of them, must be\nemployed empirically and not purely or transcendentally, plurality and\nnumerical difference are given by space itself as the condition of\nexternal phenomena. For one part of space, although it may be perfectly\nsimilar and equal to another part, is still without it, and for this\nreason alone is different from the latter, which is added to it in\norder to make up a greater space. It follows that this must hold good\nof all things that are in the different parts of space at the same\ntime, however similar and equal one may be to another.\n2. Agreement and Opposition. When reality is represented by the pure\nunderstanding (realitas noumenon), opposition between realities is\nincogitable\u2014such a relation, that is, that when these realities are\nconnected in one subject, they annihilate the effects of each other and\nmay be represented in the formula 3 -3 = 0. On the other hand, the real\nin a phenomenon (realitas phaenomenon) may very well be in mutual\nopposition, and, when united in the same subject, the one may\ncompletely or in part annihilate the effect or consequence of the\nother; as in the case of two moving forces in the same straight line\ndrawing or impelling a point in opposite directions, or in the case of\na pleasure counterbalancing a certain amount of pain.\n3. The Internal and External. In an object of the pure understanding,\nonly that is internal which has no relation (as regards its existence)\nto anything different from itself. On the other hand, the internal\ndeterminations of a substantia phaenomenon in space are nothing but\nrelations, and it is itself nothing more than a complex of mere\nrelations. Substance in space we are cognizant of only through forces\noperative in it, either drawing others towards itself (attraction), or\npreventing others from forcing into itself (repulsion and\nimpenetrability). We know no other properties that make up the\nconception of substance phenomenal in space, and which we term matter.\nOn the other hand, as an object of the pure understanding, every\nsubstance must have internal determination and forces. But what other\ninternal attributes of such an object can I think than those which my\ninternal sense presents to me? That, to wit, which in either itself\nthought, or something analogous to it. Hence Leibnitz, who looked upon\nthings as noumena, after denying them everything like external\nrelation, and therefore also composition or combination, declared that\nall substances, even the component parts of matter, were simple\nsubstances with powers of representation, in one word, monads.\n4. Matter and Form. These two conceptions lie at the foundation of all\nother reflection, so inseparably are they connected with every mode of\nexercising the understanding. The former denotes the determinable in\ngeneral, the second its determination, both in a transcendental sense,\nabstraction being made of every difference in that which is given, and\nof the mode in which it is determined. Logicians formerly termed the\nuniversal, matter, the specific difference of this or that part of the\nuniversal, form. In a judgement one may call the given conceptions\nlogical matter (for the judgement), the relation of these to each other\n(by means of the copula), the form of the judgement. In an object, the\ncomposite parts thereof (essentialia) are the matter; the mode in which\nthey are connected in the object, the form. In respect to things in\ngeneral, unlimited reality was regarded as the matter of all\npossibility, the limitation thereof (negation) as the form, by which\none thing is distinguished from another according to transcendental\nconceptions. The understanding demands that something be given (at\nleast in the conception), in order to be able to determine it in a\ncertain manner. Hence, in a conception of the pure understanding, the\nmatter precedes the form, and for this reason Leibnitz first assumed\nthe existence of things (monads) and of an internal power of\nrepresentation in them, in order to found upon this their external\nrelation and the community their state (that is, of their\nrepresentations). Hence, with him, space and time were possible\u2014the\nformer through the relation of substances, the latter through the\nconnection of their determinations with each other, as causes and\neffects. And so would it really be, if the pure understanding were\ncapable of an immediate application to objects, and if space and time\nwere determinations of things in themselves. But being merely sensuous\nintuitions, in which we determine all objects solely as phenomena, the\nform of intuition (as a subjective property of sensibility) must\nantecede all matter (sensations), consequently space and time must\nantecede all phenomena and all data of experience, and rather make\nexperience itself possible. But the intellectual philosopher could not\nendure that the form should precede the things themselves and determine\ntheir possibility; an objection perfectly correct, if we assume that we\nintuite things as they are, although with confused representation. But\nas sensuous intuition is a peculiar subjective condition, which is \u00e0\npriori at the foundation of all perception, and the form of which is\nprimitive, the form must be given per se, and so far from matter (or\nthe things themselves which appear) lying at the foundation of\nexperience (as we must conclude, if we judge by mere conceptions), the\nvery possibility of itself presupposes, on the contrary, a given formal\nintuition (space and time).\nREMARK ON THE AMPHIBOLY OF THE CONCEPTIONS OF REFLECTION.\nLet me be allowed to term the position which we assign to a conception\neither in the sensibility or in the pure understanding, the\ntranscendental place. In this manner, the appointment of the position\nwhich must be taken by each conception according to the difference in\nits use, and the directions for determining this place to all\nconceptions according to rules, would be a transcendental topic, a\ndoctrine which would thoroughly shield us from the surreptitious\ndevices of the pure understanding and the delusions which thence arise,\nas it would always distinguish to what faculty of cognition each\nconception properly belonged. Every conception, every title, under\nwhich many cognitions rank together, may be called a logical place.\nUpon this is based the logical topic of Aristotle, of which teachers\nand rhetoricians could avail themselves, in order, under certain titles\nof thought, to observe what would best suit the matter they had to\ntreat, and thus enable themselves to quibble and talk with fluency and\nan appearance of profundity.\nTranscendental topic, on the contrary, contains nothing more than the\nabove-mentioned four titles of all comparison and distinction, which\ndiffer from categories in this respect, that they do not represent the\nobject according to that which constitutes its conception (quantity,\nreality), but set forth merely the comparison of representations, which\nprecedes our conceptions of things. But this comparison requires a\nprevious reflection, that is, a determination of the place to which the\nrepresentations of the things which are compared belong, whether, to\nwit, they are cogitated by the pure understanding, or given by\nsensibility.\nConceptions may be logically compared without the trouble of inquiring\nto what faculty their objects belong, whether as noumena, to the\nunderstanding, or as phenomena, to sensibility. If, however, we wish to\nemploy these conceptions in respect of objects, previous transcendental\nreflection is necessary. Without this reflection I should make a very\nunsafe use of these conceptions, and construct pretended synthetical\npropositions which critical reason cannot acknowledge and which are\nbased solely upon a transcendental amphiboly, that is, upon a\nsubstitution of an object of pure understanding for a phenomenon.\nFor want of this doctrine of transcendental topic, and consequently\ndeceived by the amphiboly of the conceptions of reflection, the\ncelebrated Leibnitz constructed an intellectual system of the world, or\nrather, believed himself competent to cognize the internal nature of\nthings, by comparing all objects merely with the understanding and the\nabstract formal conceptions of thought. Our table of the conceptions of\nreflection gives us the unexpected advantage of being able to exhibit\nthe distinctive peculiarities of his system in all its parts, and at\nthe same time of exposing the fundamental principle of this peculiar\nmode of thought, which rested upon naught but a misconception. He\ncompared all things with each other merely by means of conceptions, and\nnaturally found no other differences than those by which the\nunderstanding distinguishes its pure conceptions one from another. The\nconditions of sensuous intuition, which contain in themselves their own\nmeans of distinction, he did not look upon as primitive, because\nsensibility was to him but a confused mode of representation and not\nany particular source of representations. A phenomenon was for him the\nrepresentation of the thing in itself, although distinguished from\ncognition by the understanding only in respect of the logical form\u2014the\nformer with its usual want of analysis containing, according to him, a\ncertain mixture of collateral representations in its conception of a\nthing, which it is the duty of the understanding to separate and\ndistinguish. In one word, Leibnitz intellectualized phenomena, just as\nLocke, in his system of noogony (if I may be allowed to make use of\nsuch expressions), sensualized the conceptions of the understanding,\nthat is to say, declared them to be nothing more than empirical or\nabstract conceptions of reflection. Instead of seeking in the\nunderstanding and sensibility two different sources of representations,\nwhich, however, can present us with objective judgements of things only\nin conjunction, each of these great men recognized but one of these\nfaculties, which, in their opinion, applied immediately to things in\nthemselves, the other having no duty but that of confusing or arranging\nthe representations of the former.\nAccordingly, the objects of sense were compared by Leibnitz as things\nin general merely in the understanding.\n1st. He compares them in regard to their identity or difference\u2014as\njudged by the understanding. As, therefore, he considered merely the\nconceptions of objects, and not their position in intuition, in which\nalone objects can be given, and left quite out of sight the\ntranscendental locale of these conceptions\u2014whether, that is, their\nobject ought to be classed among phenomena, or among things in\nthemselves, it was to be expected that he should extend the application\nof the principle of indiscernibles, which is valid solely of\nconceptions of things in general, to objects of sense (mundus\nphaenomenon), and that he should believe that he had thereby\ncontributed in no small degree to extend our knowledge of nature. In\ntruth, if I cognize in all its inner determinations a drop of water as\na thing in itself, I cannot look upon one drop as different from\nanother, if the conception of the one is completely identical with that\nof the other. But if it is a phenomenon in space, it has a place not\nmerely in the understanding (among conceptions), but also in sensuous\nexternal intuition (in space), and in this case, the physical locale is\na matter of indifference in regard to the internal determinations of\nthings, and one place, B, may contain a thing which is perfectly\nsimilar and equal to another in a place, A, just as well as if the two\nthings were in every respect different from each other. Difference of\nplace without any other conditions, makes the plurality and distinction\nof objects as phenomena, not only possible in itself, but even\nnecessary. Consequently, the above so-called law is not a law of\nnature. It is merely an analytical rule for the comparison of things by\nmeans of mere conceptions.\n2nd. The principle: \u201cRealities (as simple affirmations) never logically\ncontradict each other,\u201d is a proposition perfectly true respecting the\nrelation of conceptions, but, whether as regards nature, or things in\nthemselves (of which we have not the slightest conception), is without\nany the least meaning. For real opposition, in which A -B is = 0,\nexists everywhere, an opposition, that is, in which one reality united\nwith another in the same subject annihilates the effects of the other\u2014a\nfact which is constantly brought before our eyes by the different\nantagonistic actions and operations in nature, which, nevertheless, as\ndepending on real forces, must be called realitates phaenomena. General\nmechanics can even present us with the empirical condition of this\nopposition in an \u00e0 priori rule, as it directs its attention to the\nopposition in the direction of forces\u2014a condition of which the\ntranscendental conception of reality can tell us nothing. Although M.\nLeibnitz did not announce this proposition with precisely the pomp of a\nnew principle, he yet employed it for the establishment of new\npropositions, and his followers introduced it into their\nLeibnitzio-Wolfian system of philosophy. According to this principle,\nfor example, all evils are but consequences of the limited nature of\ncreated beings, that is, negations, because these are the only opposite\nof reality. (In the mere conception of a thing in general this is\nreally the case, but not in things as phenomena.) In like manner, the\nupholders of this system deem it not only possible, but natural also,\nto connect and unite all reality in one being, because they acknowledge\nno other sort of opposition than that of contradiction (by which the\nconception itself of a thing is annihilated), and find themselves\nunable to conceive an opposition of reciprocal destruction, so to\nspeak, in which one real cause destroys the effect of another, and the\nconditions of whose representation we meet with only in sensibility.\n3rd. The Leibnitzian monadology has really no better foundation than on\nthis philosopher\u2019s mode of falsely representing the difference of the\ninternal and external solely in relation to the understanding.\nSubstances, in general, must have something inward, which is therefore\nfree from external relations, consequently from that of composition\nalso. The simple\u2014that which can be represented by a unit\u2014is therefore\nthe foundation of that which is internal in things in themselves. The\ninternal state of substances cannot therefore consist in place, shape,\ncontact, or motion, determinations which are all external relations,\nand we can ascribe to them no other than that whereby we internally\ndetermine our faculty of sense itself, that is to say, the state of\nrepresentation. Thus, then, were constructed the monads, which were to\nform the elements of the universe, the active force of which consists\nin representation, the effects of this force being thus entirely\nconfined to themselves.\nFor the same reason, his view of the possible community of substances\ncould not represent it but as a predetermined harmony, and by no means\nas a physical influence. For inasmuch as everything is occupied only\ninternally, that is, with its own representations, the state of the\nrepresentations of one substance could not stand in active and living\nconnection with that of another, but some third cause operating on all\nwithout exception was necessary to make the different states correspond\nwith one another. And this did not happen by means of assistance\napplied in each particular case (systema assistentiae), but through the\nunity of the idea of a cause occupied and connected with all\nsubstances, in which they necessarily receive, according to the\nLeibnitzian school, their existence and permanence, consequently also\nreciprocal correspondence, according to universal laws.\n4th. This philosopher\u2019s celebrated doctrine of space and time, in which\nhe intellectualized these forms of sensibility, originated in the same\ndelusion of transcendental reflection. If I attempt to represent by the\nmere understanding, the external relations of things, I can do so only\nby employing the conception of their reciprocal action, and if I wish\nto connect one state of the same thing with another state, I must avail\nmyself of the notion of the order of cause and effect. And thus\nLeibnitz regarded space as a certain order in the community of\nsubstances, and time as the dynamical sequence of their states. That\nwhich space and time possess proper to themselves and independent of\nthings, he ascribed to a necessary confusion in our conceptions of\nthem, whereby that which is a mere form of dynamical relations is held\nto be a self-existent intuition, antecedent even to things themselves.\nThus space and time were the intelligible form of the connection of\nthings (substances and their states) in themselves. But things were\nintelligible substances (substantiae noumena). At the same time, he\nmade these conceptions valid of phenomena, because he did not allow to\nsensibility a peculiar mode of intuition, but sought all, even the\nempirical representation of objects, in the understanding, and left to\nsense naught but the despicable task of confusing and disarranging the\nrepresentations of the former.\nBut even if we could frame any synthetical proposition concerning\nthings in themselves by means of the pure understanding (which is\nimpossible), it could not apply to phenomena, which do not represent\nthings in themselves. In such a case I should be obliged in\ntranscendental reflection to compare my conceptions only under the\nconditions of sensibility, and so space and time would not be\ndeterminations of things in themselves, but of phenomena. What things\nmay be in themselves, I know not and need not know, because a thing is\nnever presented to me otherwise than as a phenomenon.\nI must adopt the same mode of procedure with the other conceptions of\nreflection. Matter is substantia phaenomenon. That in it which is\ninternal I seek to discover in all parts of space which it occupies,\nand in all the functions and operations it performs, and which are\nindeed never anything but phenomena of the external sense. I cannot\ntherefore find anything that is absolutely, but only what is\ncomparatively internal, and which itself consists of external\nrelations. The absolutely internal in matter, and as it should be\naccording to the pure understanding, is a mere chimera, for matter is\nnot an object for the pure understanding. But the transcendental\nobject, which is the foundation of the phenomenon which we call matter,\nis a mere nescio quid, the nature of which we could not understand,\neven though someone were found able to tell us. For we can understand\nnothing that does not bring with it something in intuition\ncorresponding to the expressions employed. If, by the complaint of\nbeing unable to perceive the internal nature of things, it is meant\nthat we do not comprehend by the pure understanding what the things\nwhich appear to us may be in themselves, it is a silly and unreasonable\ncomplaint; for those who talk thus really desire that we should be able\nto cognize, consequently to intuite, things without senses, and\ntherefore wish that we possessed a faculty of cognition perfectly\ndifferent from the human faculty, not merely in degree, but even as\nregards intuition and the mode thereof, so that thus we should not be\nmen, but belong to a class of beings, the possibility of whose\nexistence, much less their nature and constitution, we have no means of\ncognizing. By observation and analysis of phenomena we penetrate into\nthe interior of nature, and no one can say what progress this knowledge\nmay make in time. But those transcendental questions which pass beyond\nthe limits of nature, we could never answer, even although all nature\nwere laid open to us, because we have not the power of observing our\nown mind with any other intuition than that of our internal sense. For\nherein lies the mystery of the origin and source of our faculty of\nsensibility. Its application to an object, and the transcendental\nground of this unity of subjective and objective, lie too deeply\nconcealed for us, who cognize ourselves only through the internal\nsense, consequently as phenomena, to be able to discover in our\nexistence anything but phenomena, the non-sensuous cause of which we at\nthe same time earnestly desire to penetrate to.\nThe great utility of this critique of conclusions arrived at by the\nprocesses of mere reflection consists in its clear demonstration of the\nnullity of all conclusions respecting objects which are compared with\neach other in the understanding alone, while it at the same time\nconfirms what we particularly insisted on, namely, that, although\nphenomena are not included as things in themselves among the objects of\nthe pure understanding, they are nevertheless the only things by which\nour cognition can possess objective reality, that is to say, which give\nus intuitions to correspond with our conceptions.\nWhen we reflect in a purely logical manner, we do nothing more than\ncompare conceptions in our understanding, to discover whether both have\nthe same content, whether they are self-contradictory or not, whether\nanything is contained in either conception, which of the two is given,\nand which is merely a mode of thinking that given. But if I apply these\nconceptions to an object in general (in the transcendental sense),\nwithout first determining whether it is an object of sensuous or\nintellectual intuition, certain limitations present themselves, which\nforbid us to pass beyond the conceptions and render all empirical use\nof them impossible. And thus these limitations prove that the\nrepresentation of an object as a thing in general is not only\ninsufficient, but, without sensuous determination and independently of\nempirical conditions, self-contradictory; that we must therefore make\nabstraction of all objects, as in logic, or, admitting them, must think\nthem under conditions of sensuous intuition; that, consequently, the\nintelligible requires an altogether peculiar intuition, which we do not\npossess, and in the absence of which it is for us nothing; while, on\nthe other hand phenomena cannot be objects in themselves. For, when I\nmerely think things in general, the difference in their external\nrelations cannot constitute a difference in the things themselves; on\nthe contrary, the former presupposes the latter, and if the conception\nof one of two things is not internally different from that of the\nother, I am merely thinking the same thing in different relations.\nFurther, by the addition of one affirmation (reality) to the other, the\npositive therein is really augmented, and nothing is abstracted or\nwithdrawn from it; hence the real in things cannot be in contradiction\nwith or opposition to itself\u2014and so on.\nThe true use of the conceptions of reflection in the employment of the\nunderstanding has, as we have shown, been so misconceived by Leibnitz,\none of the most acute philosophers of either ancient or modern times,\nthat he has been misled into the construction of a baseless system of\nintellectual cognition, which professes to determine its objects\nwithout the intervention of the senses. For this reason, the exposition\nof the cause of the amphiboly of these conceptions, as the origin of\nthese false principles, is of great utility in determining with\ncertainty the proper limits of the understanding.\nIt is right to say whatever is affirmed or denied of the whole of a\nconception can be affirmed or denied of any part of it (dictum de omni\net nullo); but it would be absurd so to alter this logical proposition\nas to say whatever is not contained in a general conception is likewise\nnot contained in the particular conceptions which rank under it; for\nthe latter are particular conceptions, for the very reason that their\ncontent is greater than that which is cogitated in the general\nconception. And yet the whole intellectual system of Leibnitz is based\nupon this false principle, and with it must necessarily fall to the\nground, together with all the ambiguous principles in reference to the\nemployment of the understanding which have thence originated.\nLeibnitz\u2019s principle of the identity of indiscernibles or\nindistinguishables is really based on the presupposition that, if in\nthe conception of a thing a certain distinction is not to be found, it\nis also not to be met with in things themselves; that, consequently,\nall things are completely identical (numero eadem) which are not\ndistinguishable from each other (as to quality or quantity) in our\nconceptions of them. But, as in the mere conception of anything\nabstraction has been made of many necessary conditions of intuition,\nthat of which abstraction has been made is rashly held to be\nnon-existent, and nothing is attributed to the thing but what is\ncontained in its conception.\nThe conception of a cubic foot of space, however I may think it,\nis in itself completely identical. But two cubic feet in space are\nnevertheless distinct from each other from the sole fact of their\nbeing in different places (they are numero diversa); and these places\nare conditions of intuition, wherein the object of this conception is\ngiven, and which do not belong to the conception, but to the faculty\nof sensibility. In like manner, there is in the conception of a thing\nno contradiction when a negative is not connected with an affirmative;\nand merely affirmative conceptions cannot, in conjunction, produce any\nnegation. But in sensuous intuition, wherein reality (take for example,\nmotion) is given, we find conditions (opposite directions)\u2014of which\nabstraction has been made in the conception of motion in general\u2014which\nrender possible a contradiction or opposition (not indeed of a logical\nkind)\u2014and which from pure positives produce zero = 0. We are therefore\nnot justified in saying that all reality is in perfect agreement\nand harmony, because no contradiction is discoverable among its\nconceptions.[39] According to mere conceptions, that which is internal\nis the substratum of all relations or external determinations. When,\ntherefore, I abstract all conditions of intuition, and confine myself\nsolely to the conception of a thing in general, I can make abstraction\nof all external relations, and there must nevertheless remain a\nconception of that which indicates no relation, but merely internal\ndeterminations. Now it seems to follow that in everything (substance)\nthere is something which is absolutely internal and which antecedes\nall external determinations, inasmuch as it renders them possible; and\nthat therefore this substratum is something which does not contain any\nexternal relations and is consequently simple (for corporeal things\nare never anything but relations, at least of their parts external to\neach other); and, inasmuch as we know of no other absolutely internal\ndeterminations than those of the internal sense, this substratum is not\nonly simple, but also, analogously with our internal sense, determined\nthrough representations, that is to say, all things are properly\nmonads, or simple beings endowed with the power of representation. Now\nall this would be perfectly correct, if the conception of a thing were\nthe only necessary condition of the presentation of objects of external\nintuition. It is, on the contrary, manifest that a permanent phenomenon\nin space (impenetrable extension) can contain mere relations, and\nnothing that is absolutely internal, and yet be the primary substratum\nof all external perception. By mere conceptions I cannot think anything\nexternal, without, at the same time, thinking something internal, for\nthe reason that conceptions of relations presuppose given things,\nand without these are impossible. But, as an intuition there is\nsomething (that is, space, which, with all it contains, consists of\npurely formal, or, indeed, real relations) which is not found in the\nmere conception of a thing in general, and this presents to us the\nsubstratum which could not be cognized through conceptions alone, I\ncannot say: because a thing cannot be represented by mere conceptions\nwithout something absolutely internal, there is also, in the things\nthemselves which are contained under these conceptions, and in their\nintuition nothing external to which something absolutely internal does\nnot serve as the foundation. For, when we have made abstraction of\nall the conditions of intuition, there certainly remains in the mere\nconception nothing but the internal in general, through which alone\nthe external is possible. But this necessity, which is grounded upon\nabstraction alone, does not obtain in the case of things themselves,\nin so far as they are given in intuition with such determinations as\nexpress mere relations, without having anything internal as their\nfoundation; for they are not things in themselves, but only phenomena.\nWhat we cognize in matter is nothing but relations (what we call its\ninternal determinations are but comparatively internal). But there are\nsome self-subsistent and permanent, through which a determined object\nis given. That I, when abstraction is made of these relations, have\nnothing more to think, does not destroy the conception of a thing as\nphenomenon, nor the conception of an object in abstracto, but it does\naway with the possibility of an object that is determinable according\nto mere conceptions, that is, of a noumenon. It is certainly startling\nto hear that a thing consists solely of relations; but this thing is\nsimply a phenomenon, and cannot be cogitated by means of the mere\ncategories: it does itself consist in the mere relation of something in\ngeneral to the senses. In the same way, we cannot cogitate relations\nof things in abstracto, if we commence with conceptions alone, in any\nother manner than that one is the cause of determinations in the other;\nfor that is itself the conception of the understanding or category of\nrelation. But, as in this case we make abstraction of all intuition, we\nlose altogether the mode in which the manifold determines to each of\nits parts its place, that is, the form of sensibility (space); and yet\nthis mode antecedes all empirical causality.\n[39] If any one wishes here to have recourse to the usual subterfuge,\nand to say, that at least realitates noumena cannot be in opposition\nto each other, it will be requisite for him to adduce an example of\nthis pure and non-sensuous reality, that it may be understood whether\nthe notion represents something or nothing. But an example cannot be\nfound except in experience, which never presents to us anything more\nthan phenomena; and thus the proposition means nothing more than that\nthe conception which contains only affirmatives does not contain\nanything negative\u2014a proposition nobody ever doubted.\nIf by intelligible objects we understand things which can be thought\nby means of the pure categories, without the need of the schemata of\nsensibility, such objects are impossible. For the condition of the\nobjective use of all our conceptions of understanding is the mode of\nour sensuous intuition, whereby objects are given; and, if we make\nabstraction of the latter, the former can have no relation to an\nobject. And even if we should suppose a different kind of intuition\nfrom our own, still our functions of thought would have no use or\nsignification in respect thereof. But if we understand by the term,\nobjects of a non-sensuous intuition, in respect of which our categories\nare not valid, and of which we can accordingly have no knowledge\n(neither intuition nor conception), in this merely negative sense\nnoumena must be admitted. For this is no more than saying that our\nmode of intuition is not applicable to all things, but only to objects\nof our senses, that consequently its objective validity is limited,\nand that room is therefore left for another kind of intuition, and\nthus also for things that may be objects of it. But in this sense the\nconception of a noumenon is problematical, that is to say, it is the\nnotion of a thing of which we can neither say that it is possible,\nnor that it is impossible, inasmuch as we do not know of any mode of\nintuition besides the sensuous, or of any other sort of conceptions\nthan the categories\u2014a mode of intuition and a kind of conception\nneither of which is applicable to a non-sensuous object. We are on this\naccount incompetent to extend the sphere of our objects of thought\nbeyond the conditions of our sensibility, and to assume the existence\nof objects of pure thought, that is, of noumena, inasmuch as these\nhave no true positive signification. For it must be confessed of the\ncategories that they are not of themselves sufficient for the cognition\nof things in themselves and, without the data of sensibility, are\nmere subjective forms of the unity of the understanding. Thought is\ncertainly not a product of the senses, and in so far is not limited\nby them, but it does not therefore follow that it may be employed\npurely and without the intervention of sensibility, for it would then\nbe without reference to an object. And we cannot call a noumenon\nan object of pure thought; for the representation thereof is but\nthe problematical conception of an object for a perfectly different\nintuition and a perfectly different understanding from ours, both of\nwhich are consequently themselves problematical. The conception of a\nnoumenon is therefore not the conception of an object, but merely a\nproblematical conception inseparably connected with the limitation\nof our sensibility. That is to say, this conception contains the\nanswer to the question: \u201cAre there objects quite unconnected with,\nand independent of, our intuition?\u201d\u2014a question to which only an\nindeterminate answer can be given. That answer is: \u201cInasmuch as\nsensuous intuition does not apply to all things without distinction,\nthere remains room for other and different objects.\u201d The existence of\nthese problematical objects is therefore not absolutely denied, in the\nabsence of a determinate conception of them, but, as no category is\nvalid in respect of them, neither must they be admitted as objects for\nour understanding.\nUnderstanding accordingly limits sensibility, without at the same time\nenlarging its own field. While, moreover, it forbids sensibility to\napply its forms and modes to things in themselves and restricts it to\nthe sphere of phenomena, it cogitates an object in itself, only,\nhowever, as a transcendental object, which is the cause of a phenomenon\n(consequently not itself a phenomenon), and which cannot be thought\neither as a quantity or as reality, or as substance (because these\nconceptions always require sensuous forms in which to determine an\nobject)\u2014an object, therefore, of which we are quite unable to say\nwhether it can be met with in ourselves or out of us, whether it would\nbe annihilated together with sensibility, or, if this were taken away,\nwould continue to exist. If we wish to call this object a noumenon,\nbecause the representation of it is non-sensuous, we are at liberty to\ndo so. But as we can apply to it none of the conceptions of our\nunderstanding, the representation is for us quite void, and is\navailable only for the indication of the limits of our sensuous\nintuition, thereby leaving at the same time an empty space, which we\nare competent to fill by the aid neither of possible experience, nor of\nthe pure understanding.\nThe critique of the pure understanding, accordingly, does not permit us\nto create for ourselves a new field of objects beyond those which are\npresented to us as phenomena, and to stray into intelligible worlds;\nnay, it does not even allow us to endeavour to form so much as a\nconception of them. The specious error which leads to this\u2014and which is\na perfectly excusable one\u2014lies in the fact that the employment of the\nunderstanding, contrary to its proper purpose and destination, is made\ntranscendental, and objects, that is, possible intuitions, are made to\nregulate themselves according to conceptions, instead of the\nconceptions arranging themselves according to the intuitions, on which\nalone their own objective validity rests. Now the reason of this again\nis that apperception, and with it thought, antecedes all possible\ndeterminate arrangement of representations. Accordingly we think\nsomething in general and determine it on the one hand sensuously, but,\non the other, distinguish the general and in abstracto represented\nobject from this particular mode of intuiting it. In this case there\nremains a mode of determining the object by mere thought, which is\nreally but a logical form without content, which, however, seems to us\nto be a mode of the existence of the object in itself (noumenon),\nwithout regard to intuition which is limited to our senses.\nBefore ending this transcendental analytic, we must make an addition,\nwhich, although in itself of no particular importance, seems to be\nnecessary to the completeness of the system. The highest conception,\nwith which a transcendental philosophy commonly begins, is the division\ninto possible and impossible. But as all division presupposes a divided\nconception, a still higher one must exist, and this is the conception\nof an object in general\u2014problematically understood and without its\nbeing decided whether it is something or nothing. As the categories are\nthe only conceptions which apply to objects in general, the\ndistinguishing of an object, whether it is something or nothing, must\nproceed according to the order and direction of the categories.\n1. To the categories of quantity, that is, the conceptions of all,\nmany, and one, the conception which annihilates all, that is, the\nconception of none, is opposed. And thus the object of a conception, to\nwhich no intuition can be found to correspond, is = nothing. That is,\nit is a conception without an object (ens rationis), like noumena,\nwhich cannot be considered possible in the sphere of reality, though\nthey must not therefore be held to be impossible\u2014or like certain new\nfundamental forces in matter, the existence of which is cogitable\nwithout contradiction, though, as examples from experience are not\nforthcoming, they must not be regarded as possible.\n2. Reality is something; negation is nothing, that is, a conception of\nthe absence of an object, as cold, a shadow (nihil privativum).\n3. The mere form of intuition, without substance, is in itself no\nobject, but the merely formal condition of an object (as phenomenon),\nas pure space and pure time. These are certainly something, as forms of\nintuition, but are not themselves objects which are intuited (ens\nimaginarium).\n4. The object of a conception which is self-contradictory, is nothing,\nbecause the conception is nothing\u2014is impossible, as a figure composed\nof two straight lines (nihil negativum).\nThe table of this division of the conception of nothing (the\ncorresponding division of the conception of something does not require\nspecial description) must therefore be arranged as follows:\nNOTHING\nAS\n1\nAs Empty Conception\nwithout object,\n_ens rationis_\n2                               3\nEmpty object of               Empty intuition\na conception,                without object,\n_nihil privativum_            _ens imaginarium_\n4\nEmpty object\nwithout conception,\n_nihil negativum_\nWe see that the ens rationis is distinguished from the nihil negativum\nor pure nothing by the consideration that the former must not be\nreckoned among possibilities, because it is a mere fiction\u2014though not\nself-contradictory, while the latter is completely opposed to all\npossibility, inasmuch as the conception annihilates itself. Both,\nhowever, are empty conceptions. On the other hand, the nihil privativum\nand ens imaginarium are empty data for conceptions. If light be not\ngiven to the senses, we cannot represent to ourselves darkness, and if\nextended objects are not perceived, we cannot represent space. Neither\nthe negation, nor the mere form of intuition can, without something\nreal, be an object.\nSECOND DIVISION\u2014TRANSCENDENTAL LOGIC\nTRANSCENDENTAL DIALECTIC.\nINTRODUCTION.\nI. Of Transcendental Illusory Appearance\nWe termed dialectic in general a logic of appearance. This does not\nsignify a doctrine of probability; for probability is truth, only\ncognized upon insufficient grounds, and though the information it\ngives us is imperfect, it is not therefore deceitful. Hence it must\nnot be separated from the analytical part of logic. Still less must\nphenomenon and appearance be held to be identical. For truth or\nillusory appearance does not reside in the object, in so far as it\nis intuited, but in the judgement upon the object, in so far as it\nis thought. It is, therefore, quite correct to say that the senses\ndo not err, not because they always judge correctly, but because\nthey do not judge at all. Hence truth and error, consequently also,\nillusory appearance as the cause of error, are only to be found in a\njudgement, that is, in the relation of an object to our understanding.\nIn a cognition which completely harmonizes with the laws of the\nunderstanding, no error can exist. In a representation of the senses\u2014as\nnot containing any judgement\u2014there is also no error. But no power of\nnature can of itself deviate from its own laws. Hence neither the\nunderstanding per se (without the influence of another cause), nor the\nsenses per se, would fall into error; the former could not, because,\nif it acts only according to its own laws, the effect (the judgement)\nmust necessarily accord with these laws. But in accordance with the\nlaws of the understanding consists the formal element in all truth. In\nthe senses there is no judgement\u2014neither a true nor a false one. But,\nas we have no source of cognition besides these two, it follows that\nerror is caused solely by the unobserved influence of the sensibility\nupon the understanding. And thus it happens that the subjective grounds\nof a judgement blend and are confounded with the objective, and cause\nthem to deviate from their proper determination,[40] just as a body\nin motion would always of itself proceed in a straight line, but if\nanother impetus gives to it a different direction, it will then start\noff into a curvilinear line of motion. To distinguish the peculiar\naction of the understanding from the power which mingles with it,\nit is necessary to consider an erroneous judgement as the diagonal\nbetween two forces, that determine the judgement in two different\ndirections, which, as it were, form an angle, and to resolve this\ncomposite operation into the simple ones of the understanding and the\nsensibility. In pure \u00e0 priori judgements this must be done by means of\ntranscendental reflection, whereby, as has been already shown, each\nrepresentation has its place appointed in the corresponding faculty of\ncognition, and consequently the influence of the one faculty upon the\nother is made apparent.\n[40] Sensibility, subjected to the understanding, as the object upon\nwhich the understanding employs its functions, is the source of real\ncognitions. But, in so far as it exercises an influence upon the\naction of the understanding and determines it to judgement,\nsensibility is itself the cause of error.\nIt is not at present our business to treat of empirical illusory\nappearance (for example, optical illusion), which occurs in the\nempirical application of otherwise correct rules of the understanding,\nand in which the judgement is misled by the influence of imagination.\nOur purpose is to speak of transcendental illusory appearance, which\ninfluences principles\u2014that are not even applied to experience, for in\nthis case we should possess a sure test of their correctness\u2014but which\nleads us, in disregard of all the warnings of criticism, completely\nbeyond the empirical employment of the categories and deludes us with\nthe chimera of an extension of the sphere of the pure understanding. We\nshall term those principles the application of which is confined\nentirely within the limits of possible experience, immanent; those, on\nthe other hand, which transgress these limits, we shall call\ntranscendent principles. But by these latter I do not understand\nprinciples of the transcendental use or misuse of the categories, which\nis in reality a mere fault of the judgement when not under due\nrestraint from criticism, and therefore not paying sufficient attention\nto the limits of the sphere in which the pure understanding is allowed\nto exercise its functions; but real principles which exhort us to break\ndown all those barriers, and to lay claim to a perfectly new field of\ncognition, which recognizes no line of demarcation. Thus transcendental\nand transcendent are not identical terms. The principles of the pure\nunderstanding, which we have already propounded, ought to be of\nempirical and not of transcendental use, that is, they are not\napplicable to any object beyond the sphere of experience. A principle\nwhich removes these limits, nay, which authorizes us to overstep them,\nis called transcendent. If our criticism can succeed in exposing the\nillusion in these pretended principles, those which are limited in\ntheir employment to the sphere of experience may be called, in\nopposition to the others, immanent principles of the pure\nunderstanding.\nLogical illusion, which consists merely in the imitation of the form of\nreason (the illusion in sophistical syllogisms), arises entirely from a\nwant of due attention to logical rules. So soon as the attention is\nawakened to the case before us, this illusion totally disappears.\nTranscendental illusion, on the contrary, does not cease to exist, even\nafter it has been exposed, and its nothingness clearly perceived by\nmeans of transcendental criticism. Take, for example, the illusion in\nthe proposition: \u201cThe world must have a beginning in time.\u201d The cause\nof this is as follows. In our reason, subjectively considered as a\nfaculty of human cognition, there exist fundamental rules and maxims of\nits exercise, which have completely the appearance of objective\nprinciples. Now from this cause it happens that the subjective\nnecessity of a certain connection of our conceptions, is regarded as an\nobjective necessity of the determination of things in themselves. This\nillusion it is impossible to avoid, just as we cannot avoid perceiving\nthat the sea appears to be higher at a distance than it is near the\nshore, because we see the former by means of higher rays than the\nlatter, or, which is a still stronger case, as even the astronomer\ncannot prevent himself from seeing the moon larger at its rising than\nsome time afterwards, although he is not deceived by this illusion.\nTranscendental dialectic will therefore content itself with exposing\nthe illusory appearance in transcendental judgements, and guarding us\nagainst it; but to make it, as in the case of logical illusion,\nentirely disappear and cease to be illusion is utterly beyond its\npower. For we have here to do with a natural and unavoidable illusion,\nwhich rests upon subjective principles and imposes these upon us as\nobjective, while logical dialectic, in the detection of sophisms, has\nto do merely with an error in the logical consequence of the\npropositions, or with an artificially constructed illusion, in\nimitation of the natural error. There is, therefore, a natural and\nunavoidable dialectic of pure reason\u2014not that in which the bungler,\nfrom want of the requisite knowledge, involves himself, nor that which\nthe sophist devises for the purpose of misleading, but that which is an\ninseparable adjunct of human reason, and which, even after its\nillusions have been exposed, does not cease to deceive, and continually\nto lead reason into momentary errors, which it becomes necessary\ncontinually to remove.\nII. Of Pure Reason as the Seat of Transcendental Illusory Appearance\nA. OF REASON IN GENERAL.\nAll our knowledge begins with sense, proceeds thence to understanding,\nand ends with reason, beyond which nothing higher can be discovered in\nthe human mind for elaborating the matter of intuition and subjecting\nit to the highest unity of thought. At this stage of our inquiry it is\nmy duty to give an explanation of this, the highest faculty of\ncognition, and I confess I find myself here in some difficulty. Of\nreason, as of the understanding, there is a merely formal, that is,\nlogical use, in which it makes abstraction of all content of cognition;\nbut there is also a real use, inasmuch as it contains in itself the\nsource of certain conceptions and principles, which it does not borrow\neither from the senses or the understanding. The former faculty has\nbeen long defined by logicians as the faculty of mediate conclusion in\ncontradistinction to immediate conclusions (consequentiae immediatae);\nbut the nature of the latter, which itself generates conceptions, is\nnot to be understood from this definition. Now as a division of reason\ninto a logical and a transcendental faculty presents itself here, it\nbecomes necessary to seek for a higher conception of this source of\ncognition which shall comprehend both conceptions. In this we may\nexpect, according to the analogy of the conceptions of the\nunderstanding, that the logical conception will give us the key to the\ntranscendental, and that the table of the functions of the former will\npresent us with the clue to the conceptions of reason.\nIn the former part of our transcendental logic, we defined the\nunderstanding to be the faculty of rules; reason may be distinguished\nfrom understanding as the faculty of principles.\nThe term principle is ambiguous, and commonly signifies merely a\ncognition that may be employed as a principle, although it is not in\nitself, and as regards its proper origin, entitled to the distinction.\nEvery general proposition, even if derived from experience by the\nprocess of induction, may serve as the major in a syllogism; but it is\nnot for that reason a principle. Mathematical axioms (for example,\nthere can be only one straight line between two points) are general \u00e0\npriori cognitions, and are therefore rightly denominated principles,\nrelatively to the cases which can be subsumed under them. But I cannot\nfor this reason say that I cognize this property of a straight line\nfrom principles\u2014I cognize it only in pure intuition.\nCognition from principles, then, is that cognition in which I cognize\nthe particular in the general by means of conceptions. Thus every\nsyllogism is a form of the deduction of a cognition from a principle.\nFor the major always gives a conception, through which everything that\nis subsumed under the condition thereof is cognized according to a\nprinciple. Now as every general cognition may serve as the major in a\nsyllogism, and the understanding presents us with such general \u00e0 priori\npropositions, they may be termed principles, in respect of their\npossible use.\nBut if we consider these principles of the pure understanding in\nrelation to their origin, we shall find them to be anything rather than\ncognitions from conceptions. For they would not even be possible \u00e0\npriori, if we could not rely on the assistance of pure intuition (in\nmathematics), or on that of the conditions of a possible experience.\nThat everything that happens has a cause, cannot be concluded from the\ngeneral conception of that which happens; on the contrary the principle\nof causality instructs us as to the mode of obtaining from that which\nhappens a determinate empirical conception.\nSynthetical cognitions from conceptions the understanding cannot\nsupply, and they alone are entitled to be called principles. At the\nsame time, all general propositions may be termed comparative\nprinciples.\nIt has been a long-cherished wish\u2014that (who knows how late), may one\nday, be happily accomplished\u2014that the principles of the endless variety\nof civil laws should be investigated and exposed; for in this way alone\ncan we find the secret of simplifying legislation. But in this case,\nlaws are nothing more than limitations of our freedom upon conditions\nunder which it subsists in perfect harmony with itself; they\nconsequently have for their object that which is completely our own\nwork, and of which we ourselves may be the cause by means of these\nconceptions. But how objects as things in themselves\u2014how the nature of\nthings is subordinated to principles and is to be determined, according\nto conceptions, is a question which it seems well nigh impossible to\nanswer. Be this, however, as it may\u2014for on this point our investigation\nis yet to be made\u2014it is at least manifest from what we have said that\ncognition from principles is something very different from cognition by\nmeans of the understanding, which may indeed precede other cognitions\nin the form of a principle, but in itself\u2014in so far as it is\nsynthetical\u2014is neither based upon mere thought, nor contains a general\nproposition drawn from conceptions alone.\nThe understanding may be a faculty for the production of unity of\nphenomena by virtue of rules; the reason is a faculty for the\nproduction of unity of rules (of the understanding) under principles.\nReason, therefore, never applies directly to experience, or to any\nsensuous object; its object is, on the contrary, the understanding, to\nthe manifold cognition of which it gives a unity \u00e0 priori by means of\nconceptions\u2014a unity which may be called rational unity, and which is of\na nature very different from that of the unity produced by the\nunderstanding.\nThe above is the general conception of the faculty of reason, in so far\nas it has been possible to make it comprehensible in the absence of\nexamples. These will be given in the sequel.\nB. OF THE LOGICAL USE OF REASON.\nA distinction is commonly made between that which is immediately\ncognized and that which is inferred or concluded. That in a figure\nwhich is bounded by three straight lines there are three angles, is an\nimmediate cognition; but that these angles are together equal to two\nright angles, is an inference or conclusion. Now, as we are constantly\nemploying this mode of thought and have thus become quite accustomed to\nit, we no longer remark the above distinction, and, as in the case of\nthe so-called deceptions of sense, consider as immediately perceived,\nwhat has really been inferred. In every reasoning or syllogism, there\nis a fundamental proposition, afterwards a second drawn from it, and\nfinally the conclusion, which connects the truth in the first with the\ntruth in the second\u2014and that infallibly. If the judgement concluded is\nso contained in the first proposition that it can be deduced from it\nwithout the meditation of a third notion, the conclusion is called\nimmediate (consequentia immediata); I prefer the term conclusion of the\nunderstanding. But if, in addition to the fundamental cognition, a\nsecond judgement is necessary for the production of the conclusion, it\nis called a conclusion of the reason. In the proposition: All men are\nmortal, are contained the propositions: Some men are mortal, Nothing\nthat is not mortal is a man, and these are therefore immediate\nconclusions from the first. On the other hand, the proposition: all the\nlearned are mortal, is not contained in the main proposition (for the\nconception of a learned man does not occur in it), and it can be\ndeduced from the main proposition only by means of a mediating\njudgement.\nIn every syllogism I first cogitate a rule (the major) by means of the\nunderstanding. In the next place I subsume a cognition under the\ncondition of the rule (and this is the minor) by means of the\njudgement. And finally I determine my cognition by means of the\npredicate of the rule (this is the conclusio), consequently, I\ndetermine it \u00e0 priori by means of the reason. The relations, therefore,\nwhich the major proposition, as the rule, represents between a\ncognition and its condition, constitute the different kinds of\nsyllogisms. These are just threefold\u2014analogously with all judgements,\nin so far as they differ in the mode of expressing the relation of a\ncognition in the understanding\u2014namely, categorical, hypothetical, and\ndisjunctive.\nWhen as often happens, the conclusion is a judgement which may follow\nfrom other given judgements, through which a perfectly different object\nis cogitated, I endeavour to discover in the understanding whether the\nassertion in this conclusion does not stand under certain conditions\naccording to a general rule. If I find such a condition, and if the\nobject mentioned in the conclusion can be subsumed under the given\ncondition, then this conclusion follows from a rule which is also valid\nfor other objects of cognition. From this we see that reason endeavours\nto subject the great variety of the cognitions of the understanding to\nthe smallest possible number of principles (general conditions), and\nthus to produce in it the highest unity.\nC. OF THE PURE USE OF REASON.\nCan we isolate reason, and, if so, is it in this case a peculiar source\nof conceptions and judgements which spring from it alone, and through\nwhich it can be applied to objects; or is it merely a subordinate\nfaculty, whose duty it is to give a certain form to given cognitions\u2014a\nform which is called logical, and through which the cognitions of the\nunderstanding are subordinated to each other, and lower rules to higher\n(those, to wit, whose condition comprises in its sphere the condition\nof the others), in so far as this can be done by comparison? This is\nthe question which we have at present to answer. Manifold variety of\nrules and unity of principles is a requirement of reason, for the\npurpose of bringing the understanding into complete accordance with\nitself, just as understanding subjects the manifold content of\nintuition to conceptions, and thereby introduces connection into it.\nBut this principle prescribes no law to objects, and does not contain\nany ground of the possibility of cognizing or of determining them as\nsuch, but is merely a subjective law for the proper arrangement of the\ncontent of the understanding. The purpose of this law is, by a\ncomparison of the conceptions of the understanding, to reduce them to\nthe smallest possible number, although, at the same time, it does not\njustify us in demanding from objects themselves such a uniformity as\nmight contribute to the convenience and the enlargement of the sphere\nof the understanding, or in expecting that it will itself thus receive\nfrom them objective validity. In one word, the question is: \u201cdoes\nreason in itself, that is, does pure reason contain \u00e0 priori\nsynthetical principles and rules, and what are those principles?\u201d\nThe formal and logical procedure of reason in syllogisms gives us\nsufficient information in regard to the ground on which the\ntranscendental principle of reason in its pure synthetical cognition\nwill rest.\n1. Reason, as observed in the syllogistic process, is not applicable to\nintuitions, for the purpose of subjecting them to rules\u2014for this is the\nprovince of the understanding with its categories\u2014but to conceptions\nand judgements. If pure reason does apply to objects and the intuition\nof them, it does so not immediately, but mediately\u2014through the\nunderstanding and its judgements, which have a direct relation to the\nsenses and their intuition, for the purpose of determining their\nobjects. The unity of reason is therefore not the unity of a possible\nexperience, but is essentially different from this unity, which is that\nof the understanding. That everything which happens has a cause, is not\na principle cognized and prescribed by reason. This principle makes the\nunity of experience possible and borrows nothing from reason, which,\nwithout a reference to possible experience, could never have produced\nby means of mere conceptions any such synthetical unity.\n2. Reason, in its logical use, endeavours to discover the general\ncondition of its judgement (the conclusion), and a syllogism is itself\nnothing but a judgement by means of the subsumption of its condition\nunder a general rule (the major). Now as this rule may itself be\nsubjected to the same process of reason, and thus the condition of the\ncondition be sought (by means of a prosyllogism) as long as the process\ncan be continued, it is very manifest that the peculiar principle of\nreason in its logical use is to find for the conditioned cognition of\nthe understanding the unconditioned whereby the unity of the former is\ncompleted.\nBut this logical maxim cannot be a principle of pure reason, unless we\nadmit that, if the conditioned is given, the whole series of conditions\nsubordinated to one another\u2014a series which is consequently itself\nunconditioned\u2014is also given, that is, contained in the object and its\nconnection.\nBut this principle of pure reason is evidently synthetical; for,\nanalytically, the conditioned certainly relates to some condition, but\nnot to the unconditioned. From this principle also there must originate\ndifferent synthetical propositions, of which the pure understanding is\nperfectly ignorant, for it has to do only with objects of a possible\nexperience, the cognition and synthesis of which is always conditioned.\nThe unconditioned, if it does really exist, must be especially\nconsidered in regard to the determinations which distinguish it from\nwhatever is conditioned, and will thus afford us material for many \u00e0\npriori synthetical propositions.\nThe principles resulting from this highest principle of pure reason\nwill, however, be transcendent in relation to phenomena, that is to\nsay, it will be impossible to make any adequate empirical use of this\nprinciple. It is therefore completely different from all principles of\nthe understanding, the use made of which is entirely immanent, their\nobject and purpose being merely the possibility of experience. Now our\nduty in the transcendental dialectic is as follows. To discover whether\nthe principle that the series of conditions (in the synthesis of\nphenomena, or of thought in general) extends to the unconditioned is\nobjectively true, or not; what consequences result therefrom affecting\nthe empirical use of the understanding, or rather whether there exists\nany such objectively valid proposition of reason, and whether it is\nnot, on the contrary, a merely logical precept which directs us to\nascend perpetually to still higher conditions, to approach completeness\nin the series of them, and thus to introduce into our cognition the\nhighest possible unity of reason. We must ascertain, I say, whether\nthis requirement of reason has not been regarded, by a\nmisunderstanding, as a transcendental principle of pure reason, which\npostulates a thorough completeness in the series of conditions in\nobjects themselves. We must show, moreover, the misconceptions and\nillusions that intrude into syllogisms, the major proposition of which\npure reason has supplied\u2014a proposition which has perhaps more of the\ncharacter of a petitio than of a postulatum\u2014and that proceed from\nexperience upwards to its conditions. The solution of these problems is\nour task in transcendental dialectic, which we are about to expose even\nat its source, that lies deep in human reason. We shall divide it into\ntwo parts, the first of which will treat of the transcendent\nconceptions of pure reason, the second of transcendent and dialectical\nsyllogisms.\nTRANSCENDENTAL DIALECTIC\u2014BOOK I\u2014OF THE CONCEPTIONS OF PURE REASON.\nThe conceptions of pure reason\u2014we do not here speak of the possibility\nof them\u2014are not obtained by reflection, but by inference or conclusion.\nThe conceptions of understanding are also cogitated \u00e0 priori\nantecedently to experience, and render it possible; but they contain\nnothing but the unity of reflection upon phenomena, in so far as these\nmust necessarily belong to a possible empirical consciousness. Through\nthem alone are cognition and the determination of an object possible.\nIt is from them, accordingly, that we receive material for reasoning,\nand antecedently to them we possess no \u00e0 priori conceptions of objects\nfrom which they might be deduced, On the other hand, the sole basis of\ntheir objective reality consists in the necessity imposed on them, as\ncontaining the intellectual form of all experience, of restricting\ntheir application and influence to the sphere of experience.\nBut the term, conception of reason, or rational conception, itself\nindicates that it does not confine itself within the limits of\nexperience, because its object-matter is a cognition, of which every\nempirical cognition is but a part\u2014nay, the whole of possible experience\nmay be itself but a part of it\u2014a cognition to which no actual\nexperience ever fully attains, although it does always pertain to it.\nThe aim of rational conceptions is the comprehension, as that of the\nconceptions of understanding is the understanding of perceptions. If\nthey contain the unconditioned, they relate to that to which all\nexperience is subordinate, but which is never itself an object of\nexperience\u2014that towards which reason tends in all its conclusions from\nexperience, and by the standard of which it estimates the degree of\ntheir empirical use, but which is never itself an element in an\nempirical synthesis. If, notwithstanding, such conceptions possess\nobjective validity, they may be called conceptus ratiocinati\n(conceptions legitimately concluded); in cases where they do not, they\nhave been admitted on account of having the appearance of being\ncorrectly concluded, and may be called conceptus ratiocinantes\n(sophistical conceptions). But as this can only be sufficiently\ndemonstrated in that part of our treatise which relates to the\ndialectical conclusions of reason, we shall omit any consideration of\nit in this place. As we called the pure conceptions of the\nunderstanding categories, we shall also distinguish those of pure\nreason by a new name and call them transcendental ideas. These terms,\nhowever, we must in the first place explain and justify.\nSection I\u2014Of Ideas in General\nDespite the great wealth of words which European languages possess, the\nthinker finds himself often at a loss for an expression exactly suited\nto his conception, for want of which he is unable to make himself\nintelligible either to others or to himself. To coin new words is a\npretension to legislation in language which is seldom successful; and,\nbefore recourse is taken to so desperate an expedient, it is advisable\nto examine the dead and learned languages, with the hope and the\nprobability that we may there meet with some adequate expression of the\nnotion we have in our minds. In this case, even if the original meaning\nof the word has become somewhat uncertain, from carelessness or want of\ncaution on the part of the authors of it, it is always better to adhere\nto and confirm its proper meaning\u2014even although it may be doubtful\nwhether it was formerly used in exactly this sense\u2014than to make our\nlabour vain by want of sufficient care to render ourselves\nintelligible.\nFor this reason, when it happens that there exists only a single word\nto express a certain conception, and this word, in its usual\nacceptation, is thoroughly adequate to the conception, the accurate\ndistinction of which from related conceptions is of great importance,\nwe ought not to employ the expression improvidently, or, for the sake\nof variety and elegance of style, use it as a synonym for other cognate\nwords. It is our duty, on the contrary, carefully to preserve its\npeculiar signification, as otherwise it easily happens that when the\nattention of the reader is no longer particularly attracted to the\nexpression, and it is lost amid the multitude of other words of very\ndifferent import, the thought which it conveyed, and which it alone\nconveyed, is lost with it.\nPlato employed the expression idea in a way that plainly showed he\nmeant by it something which is never derived from the senses, but which\nfar transcends even the conceptions of the understanding (with which\nAristotle occupied himself), inasmuch as in experience nothing\nperfectly corresponding to them could be found. Ideas are, according to\nhim, archetypes of things themselves, and not merely keys to possible\nexperiences, like the categories. In his view they flow from the\nhighest reason, by which they have been imparted to human reason,\nwhich, however, exists no longer in its original state, but is obliged\nwith great labour to recall by reminiscence\u2014which is called\nphilosophy\u2014the old but now sadly obscured ideas. I will not here enter\nupon any literary investigation of the sense which this sublime\nphilosopher attached to this expression. I shall content myself with\nremarking that it is nothing unusual, in common conversation as well as\nin written works, by comparing the thoughts which an author has\ndelivered upon a subject, to understand him better than he understood\nhimself inasmuch as he may not have sufficiently determined his\nconception, and thus have sometimes spoken, nay even thought, in\nopposition to his own opinions.\nPlato perceived very clearly that our faculty of cognition has the\nfeeling of a much higher vocation than that of merely spelling out\nphenomena according to synthetical unity, for the purpose of being able\nto read them as experience, and that our reason naturally raises itself\nto cognitions far too elevated to admit of the possibility of an object\ngiven by experience corresponding to them\u2014cognitions which are\nnevertheless real, and are not mere phantoms of the brain.\nThis philosopher found his ideas especially in all that is\npractical,[41] that is, which rests upon freedom, which in its turn\nranks under cognitions that are the peculiar product of reason. He who\nwould derive from experience the conceptions of virtue, who would make\n(as many have really done) that, which at best can but serve as an\nimperfectly illustrative example, a model for or the formation of a\nperfectly adequate idea on the subject, would in fact transform virtue\ninto a nonentity changeable according to time and circumstance and\nutterly incapable of being employed as a rule. On the contrary, every\none is conscious that, when any one is held up to him as a model of\nvirtue, he compares this so-called model with the true original which\nhe possesses in his own mind and values him according to this standard.\nBut this standard is the idea of virtue, in relation to which all\npossible objects of experience are indeed serviceable as\nexamples\u2014proofs of the practicability in a certain degree of that which\nthe conception of virtue demands\u2014but certainly not as archetypes. That\nthe actions of man will never be in perfect accordance with all the\nrequirements of the pure ideas of reason, does not prove the thought to\nbe chimerical. For only through this idea are all judgements as to\nmoral merit or demerit possible; it consequently lies at the foundation\nof every approach to moral perfection, however far removed from it the\nobstacles in human nature\u2014indeterminable as to degree\u2014may keep us.\n[41] He certainly extended the application of his conception to\nspeculative cognitions also, provided they were given pure and\ncompletely \u00e0 priori, nay, even to mathematics, although this science\ncannot possess an object otherwhere than in Possible experience. I\ncannot follow him in this, and as little can I follow him in his\nmystical deduction of these ideas, or in his hypostatization of them;\nalthough, in truth, the elevated and exaggerated language which he\nemployed in describing them is quite capable of an interpretation more\nsubdued and more in accordance with fact and the nature of things.\nThe Platonic Republic has become proverbial as an example\u2014and a\nstriking one\u2014of imaginary perfection, such as can exist only in the\nbrain of the idle thinker; and Brucker ridicules the philosopher for\nmaintaining that a prince can never govern well, unless he is\nparticipant in the ideas. But we should do better to follow up this\nthought and, where this admirable thinker leaves us without assistance,\nemploy new efforts to place it in clearer light, rather than carelessly\nfling it aside as useless, under the very miserable and pernicious\npretext of impracticability. A constitution of the greatest possible\nhuman freedom according to laws, by which the liberty of every\nindividual can consist with the liberty of every other (not of the\ngreatest possible happiness, for this follows necessarily from the\nformer), is, to say the least, a necessary idea, which must be placed\nat the foundation not only of the first plan of the constitution of a\nstate, but of all its laws. And, in this, it not necessary at the\noutset to take account of the obstacles which lie in our way\u2014obstacles\nwhich perhaps do not necessarily arise from the character of human\nnature, but rather from the previous neglect of true ideas in\nlegislation. For there is nothing more pernicious and more unworthy of\na philosopher, than the vulgar appeal to a so-called adverse\nexperience, which indeed would not have existed, if those institutions\nhad been established at the proper time and in accordance with ideas;\nwhile, instead of this, conceptions, crude for the very reason that\nthey have been drawn from experience, have marred and frustrated all\nour better views and intentions. The more legislation and government\nare in harmony with this idea, the more rare do punishments become and\nthus it is quite reasonable to maintain, as Plato did, that in a\nperfect state no punishments at all would be necessary. Now although a\nperfect state may never exist, the idea is not on that account the less\njust, which holds up this maximum as the archetype or standard of a\nconstitution, in order to bring legislative government always nearer\nand nearer to the greatest possible perfection. For at what precise\ndegree human nature must stop in its progress, and how wide must be the\nchasm which must necessarily exist between the idea and its\nrealization, are problems which no one can or ought to determine\u2014and\nfor this reason, that it is the destination of freedom to overstep all\nassigned limits between itself and the idea.\nBut not only in that wherein human reason is a real causal agent and\nwhere ideas are operative causes (of actions and their objects), that\nis to say, in the region of ethics, but also in regard to nature\nherself, Plato saw clear proofs of an origin from ideas. A plant, and\nanimal, the regular order of nature\u2014probably also the disposition of\nthe whole universe\u2014give manifest evidence that they are possible only\nby means of and according to ideas; that, indeed, no one creature,\nunder the individual conditions of its existence, perfectly harmonizes\nwith the idea of the most perfect of its kind\u2014just as little as man\nwith the idea of humanity, which nevertheless he bears in his soul as\nthe archetypal standard of his actions; that, notwithstanding, these\nideas are in the highest sense individually, unchangeably, and\ncompletely determined, and are the original causes of things; and that\nthe totality of connected objects in the universe is alone fully\nadequate to that idea. Setting aside the exaggerations of expression in\nthe writings of this philosopher, the mental power exhibited in this\nascent from the ectypal mode of regarding the physical world to the\narchitectonic connection thereof according to ends, that is, ideas, is\nan effort which deserves imitation and claims respect. But as regards\nthe principles of ethics, of legislation, and of religion, spheres in\nwhich ideas alone render experience possible, although they never\nattain to full expression therein, he has vindicated for himself a\nposition of peculiar merit, which is not appreciated only because it is\njudged by the very empirical rules, the validity of which as principles\nis destroyed by ideas. For as regards nature, experience presents us\nwith rules and is the source of truth, but in relation to ethical laws\nexperience is the parent of illusion, and it is in the highest degree\nreprehensible to limit or to deduce the laws which dictate what I ought\nto do, from what is done.\nWe must, however, omit the consideration of these important subjects,\nthe development of which is in reality the peculiar duty and dignity of\nphilosophy, and confine ourselves for the present to the more humble\nbut not less useful task of preparing a firm foundation for those\nmajestic edifices of moral science. For this foundation has been\nhitherto insecure from the many subterranean passages which reason in\nits confident but vain search for treasures has made in all directions.\nOur present duty is to make ourselves perfectly acquainted with the\ntranscendental use made of pure reason, its principles and ideas, that\nwe may be able properly to determine and value its influence and real\nworth. But before bringing these introductory remarks to a close, I beg\nthose who really have philosophy at heart\u2014and their number is but\nsmall\u2014if they shall find themselves convinced by the considerations\nfollowing as well as by those above, to exert themselves to preserve to\nthe expression idea its original signification, and to take care that\nit be not lost among those other expressions by which all sorts of\nrepresentations are loosely designated\u2014that the interests of science\nmay not thereby suffer. We are in no want of words to denominate\nadequately every mode of representation, without the necessity of\nencroaching upon terms which are proper to others. The following is a\ngraduated list of them. The genus is representation in general\n(representatio). Under it stands representation with consciousness\n(perceptio). A perception which relates solely to the subject as a\nmodification of its state, is a sensation (sensatio), an objective\nperception is a cognition (cognitio). A cognition is either an\nintuition or a conception (intuitus vel conceptus). The former has an\nimmediate relation to the object and is singular and individual; the\nlatter has but a mediate relation, by means of a characteristic mark\nwhich may be common to several things. A conception is either empirical\nor pure. A pure conception, in so far as it has its origin in the\nunderstanding alone, and is not the conception of a pure sensuous\nimage, is called notio. A conception formed from notions, which\ntranscends the possibility of experience, is an idea, or a conception\nof reason. To one who has accustomed himself to these distinctions, it\nmust be quite intolerable to hear the representation of the colour red\ncalled an idea. It ought not even to be called a notion or conception\nof understanding.\nSection II. Of Transcendental Ideas\nTranscendental analytic showed us how the mere logical form of our\ncognition can contain the origin of pure conceptions \u00e0 priori,\nconceptions which represent objects antecedently to all experience, or\nrather, indicate the synthetical unity which alone renders possible an\nempirical cognition of objects. The form of judgements\u2014converted into a\nconception of the synthesis of intuitions\u2014produced the categories which\ndirect the employment of the understanding in experience. This\nconsideration warrants us to expect that the form of syllogisms, when\napplied to synthetical unity of intuitions, following the rule of the\ncategories, will contain the origin of particular \u00e0 priori conceptions,\nwhich we may call pure conceptions of reason or transcendental ideas,\nand which will determine the use of the understanding in the totality\nof experience according to principles.\nThe function of reason in arguments consists in the universality of a\ncognition according to conceptions, and the syllogism itself is a\njudgement which is determined \u00e0 priori in the whole extent of its\ncondition. The proposition: \u201cCaius is mortal,\u201d is one which may be\nobtained from experience by the aid of the understanding alone; but my\nwish is to find a conception which contains the condition under which\nthe predicate of this judgement is given\u2014in this case, the conception\nof man\u2014and after subsuming under this condition, taken in its whole\nextent (all men are mortal), I determine according to it the cognition\nof the object thought, and say: \u201cCaius is mortal.\u201d\nHence, in the conclusion of a syllogism we restrict a predicate to a\ncertain object, after having thought it in the major in its whole\nextent under a certain condition. This complete quantity of the extent\nin relation to such a condition is called universality (universalitas).\nTo this corresponds totality (universitas) of conditions in the\nsynthesis of intuitions. The transcendental conception of reason is\ntherefore nothing else than the conception of the totality of the\nconditions of a given conditioned. Now as the unconditioned alone\nrenders possible totality of conditions, and, conversely, the totality\nof conditions is itself always unconditioned; a pure rational\nconception in general can be defined and explained by means of the\nconception of the unconditioned, in so far as it contains a basis for\nthe synthesis of the conditioned.\nTo the number of modes of relation which the understanding cogitates by\nmeans of the categories, the number of pure rational conceptions will\ncorrespond. We must therefore seek for, first, an unconditioned of the\ncategorical synthesis in a subject; secondly, of the hypothetical\nsynthesis of the members of a series; thirdly, of the disjunctive\nsynthesis of parts in a system.\nThere are exactly the same number of modes of syllogisms, each of which\nproceeds through prosyllogisms to the unconditioned\u2014one to the subject\nwhich cannot be employed as predicate, another to the presupposition\nwhich supposes nothing higher than itself, and the third to an\naggregate of the members of the complete division of a conception.\nHence the pure rational conceptions of totality in the synthesis of\nconditions have a necessary foundation in the nature of human reason\u2014at\nleast as modes of elevating the unity of the understanding to the\nunconditioned. They may have no valid application, corresponding to\ntheir transcendental employment, in concreto, and be thus of no greater\nutility than to direct the understanding how, while extending them as\nwidely as possible, to maintain its exercise and application in perfect\nconsistence and harmony.\nBut, while speaking here of the totality of conditions and of the\nunconditioned as the common title of all conceptions of reason, we\nagain light upon an expression which we find it impossible to dispense\nwith, and which nevertheless, owing to the ambiguity attaching to it\nfrom long abuse, we cannot employ with safety. The word absolute is one\nof the few words which, in its original signification, was perfectly\nadequate to the conception it was intended to convey\u2014a conception which\nno other word in the same language exactly suits, and the loss\u2014or,\nwhich is the same thing, the incautious and loose employment\u2014of which\nmust be followed by the loss of the conception itself. And, as it is a\nconception which occupies much of the attention of reason, its loss\nwould be greatly to the detriment of all transcendental philosophy. The\nword absolute is at present frequently used to denote that something\ncan be predicated of a thing considered in itself and intrinsically. In\nthis sense absolutely possible would signify that which is possible in\nitself (interne)\u2014which is, in fact, the least that one can predicate of\nan object. On the other hand, it is sometimes employed to indicate that\na thing is valid in all respects\u2014for example, absolute sovereignty.\nAbsolutely possible would in this sense signify that which is possible\nin all relations and in every respect; and this is the most that can be\npredicated of the possibility of a thing. Now these significations do\nin truth frequently coincide. Thus, for example, that which is\nintrinsically impossible, is also impossible in all relations, that is,\nabsolutely impossible. But in most cases they differ from each other\ntoto caelo, and I can by no means conclude that, because a thing is in\nitself possible, it is also possible in all relations, and therefore\nabsolutely. Nay, more, I shall in the sequel show that absolute\nnecessity does not by any means depend on internal necessity, and that,\ntherefore, it must not be considered as synonymous with it. Of an\nopposite which is intrinsically impossible, we may affirm that it is in\nall respects impossible, and that, consequently, the thing itself, of\nwhich this is the opposite, is absolutely necessary; but I cannot\nreason conversely and say, the opposite of that which is absolutely\nnecessary is intrinsically impossible, that is, that the absolute\nnecessity of things is an internal necessity. For this internal\nnecessity is in certain cases a mere empty word with which the least\nconception cannot be connected, while the conception of the necessity\nof a thing in all relations possesses very peculiar determinations. Now\nas the loss of a conception of great utility in speculative science\ncannot be a matter of indifference to the philosopher, I trust that the\nproper determination and careful preservation of the expression on\nwhich the conception depends will likewise be not indifferent to him.\nIn this enlarged signification, then, shall I employ the word absolute,\nin opposition to that which is valid only in some particular respect;\nfor the latter is restricted by conditions, the former is valid without\nany restriction whatever.\nNow the transcendental conception of reason has for its object nothing\nelse than absolute totality in the synthesis of conditions and does not\nrest satisfied till it has attained to the absolutely, that is, in all\nrespects and relations, unconditioned. For pure reason leaves to the\nunderstanding everything that immediately relates to the object of\nintuition or rather to their synthesis in imagination. The former\nrestricts itself to the absolute totality in the employment of the\nconceptions of the understanding and aims at carrying out the\nsynthetical unity which is cogitated in the category, even to the\nunconditioned. This unity may hence be called the rational unity of\nphenomena, as the other, which the category expresses, may be termed\nthe unity of the understanding. Reason, therefore, has an immediate\nrelation to the use of the understanding, not indeed in so far as the\nlatter contains the ground of possible experience (for the conception\nof the absolute totality of conditions is not a conception that can be\nemployed in experience, because no experience is unconditioned), but\nsolely for the purpose of directing it to a certain unity, of which the\nunderstanding has no conception, and the aim of which is to collect\ninto an absolute whole all acts of the understanding. Hence the\nobjective employment of the pure conceptions of reason is always\ntranscendent, while that of the pure conceptions of the understanding\nmust, according to their nature, be always immanent, inasmuch as they\nare limited to possible experience.\nI understand by idea a necessary conception of reason, to which no\ncorresponding object can be discovered in the world of sense.\nAccordingly, the pure conceptions of reason at present under\nconsideration are transcendental ideas. They are conceptions of pure\nreason, for they regard all empirical cognition as determined by means\nof an absolute totality of conditions. They are not mere fictions, but\nnatural and necessary products of reason, and have hence a necessary\nrelation to the whole sphere of the exercise of the understanding. And,\nfinally, they are transcendent, and overstep the limits of all\nexperiences, in which, consequently, no object can ever be presented\nthat would be perfectly adequate to a transcendental idea. When we use\nthe word idea, we say, as regards its object (an object of the pure\nunderstanding), a great deal, but as regards its subject (that is, in\nrespect of its reality under conditions of experience), exceedingly\nlittle, because the idea, as the conception of a maximum, can never be\ncompletely and adequately presented in concreto. Now, as in the merely\nspeculative employment of reason the latter is properly the sole aim,\nand as in this case the approximation to a conception, which is never\nattained in practice, is the same thing as if the conception were\nnon-existent\u2014it is commonly said of the conception of this kind, \u201cit is\nonly an idea.\u201d So we might very well say, \u201cthe absolute totality of all\nphenomena is only an idea,\u201d for, as we never can present an adequate\nrepresentation of it, it remains for us a problem incapable of\nsolution. On the other hand, as in the practical use of the\nunderstanding we have only to do with action and practice according to\nrules, an idea of pure reason can always be given really in concreto,\nalthough only partially, nay, it is the indispensable condition of all\npractical employment of reason. The practice or execution of the idea\nis always limited and defective, but nevertheless within indeterminable\nboundaries, consequently always under the influence of the conception\nof an absolute perfection. And thus the practical idea is always in the\nhighest degree fruitful, and in relation to real actions indispensably\nnecessary. In the idea, pure reason possesses even causality and the\npower of producing that which its conception contains. Hence we cannot\nsay of wisdom, in a disparaging way, \u201cit is only an idea.\u201d For, for the\nvery reason that it is the idea of the necessary unity of all possible\naims, it must be for all practical exertions and endeavours the\nprimitive condition and rule\u2014a rule which, if not constitutive, is at\nleast limitative.\nNow, although we must say of the transcendental conceptions of reason,\n\u201cthey are only ideas,\u201d we must not, on this account, look upon them as\nsuperfluous and nugatory. For, although no object can be determined by\nthem, they can be of great utility, unobserved and at the basis of the\nedifice of the understanding, as the canon for its extended and\nself-consistent exercise\u2014a canon which, indeed, does not enable it to\ncognize more in an object than it would cognize by the help of its own\nconceptions, but which guides it more securely in its cognition. Not to\nmention that they perhaps render possible a transition from our\nconceptions of nature and the non-ego to the practical conceptions, and\nthus produce for even ethical ideas keeping, so to speak, and\nconnection with the speculative cognitions of reason. The explication\nof all this must be looked for in the sequel.\nBut setting aside, in conformity with our original purpose, the\nconsideration of the practical ideas, we proceed to contemplate reason\nin its speculative use alone, nay, in a still more restricted sphere,\nto wit, in the transcendental use; and here must strike into the same\npath which we followed in our deduction of the categories. That is to\nsay, we shall consider the logical form of the cognition of reason,\nthat we may see whether reason may not be thereby a source of\nconceptions which enables us to regard objects in themselves as\ndetermined synthetically \u00e0 priori, in relation to one or other of the\nfunctions of reason.\nReason, considered as the faculty of a certain logical form of\ncognition, is the faculty of conclusion, that is, of mediate\njudgement\u2014by means of the subsumption of the condition of a possible\njudgement under the condition of a given judgement. The given judgement\nis the general rule (major). The subsumption of the condition of\nanother possible judgement under the condition of the rule is the\nminor. The actual judgement, which enounces the assertion of the rule\nin the subsumed case, is the conclusion (conclusio). The rule\npredicates something generally under a certain condition. The condition\nof the rule is satisfied in some particular case. It follows that what\nwas valid in general under that condition must also be considered as\nvalid in the particular case which satisfies this condition. It is very\nplain that reason attains to a cognition, by means of acts of the\nunderstanding which constitute a series of conditions. When I arrive at\nthe proposition, \u201cAll bodies are changeable,\u201d by beginning with the\nmore remote cognition (in which the conception of body does not appear,\nbut which nevertheless contains the condition of that conception), \u201cAll\ncompound is changeable,\u201d by proceeding from this to a less remote\ncognition, which stands under the condition of the former, \u201cBodies are\ncompound,\u201d and hence to a third, which at length connects for me the\nremote cognition (changeable) with the one before me, \u201cConsequently,\nbodies are changeable\u201d\u2014I have arrived at a cognition (conclusion)\nthrough a series of conditions (premisses). Now every series, whose\nexponent (of the categorical or hypothetical judgement) is given, can\nbe continued; consequently the same procedure of reason conducts us to\nthe ratiocinatio polysyllogistica, which is a series of syllogisms,\nthat can be continued either on the side of the conditions (per\nprosyllogismos) or of the conditioned (per episyllogismos) to an\nindefinite extent.\nBut we very soon perceive that the chain or series of prosyllogisms,\nthat is, of deduced cognitions on the side of the grounds or conditions\nof a given cognition, in other words, the ascending series of\nsyllogisms must have a very different relation to the faculty of reason\nfrom that of the descending series, that is, the progressive procedure\nof reason on the side of the conditioned by means of episyllogisms.\nFor, as in the former case the cognition (conclusio) is given only as\nconditioned, reason can attain to this cognition only under the\npresupposition that all the members of the series on the side of the\nconditions are given (totality in the series of premisses), because\nonly under this supposition is the judgement we may be considering\npossible \u00e0 priori; while on the side of the conditioned or the\ninferences, only an incomplete and becoming, and not a presupposed or\ngiven series, consequently only a potential progression, is cogitated.\nHence, when a cognition is contemplated as conditioned, reason is\ncompelled to consider the series of conditions in an ascending line as\ncompleted and given in their totality. But if the very same condition\nis considered at the same time as the condition of other cognitions,\nwhich together constitute a series of inferences or consequences in a\ndescending line, reason may preserve a perfect indifference, as to how\nfar this progression may extend _a parte posteriori_, and whether the\ntotality of this series is possible, because it stands in no need of\nsuch a series for the purpose of arriving at the conclusion before it,\ninasmuch as this conclusion is sufficiently guaranteed and determined\non grounds a parte priori. It may be the case, that upon the side of\nthe conditions the series of premisses has a first or highest\ncondition, or it may not possess this, and so be a parte priori\nunlimited; but it must, nevertheless, contain totality of conditions,\neven admitting that we never could succeed in completely apprehending\nit; and the whole series must be unconditionally true, if the\nconditioned, which is considered as an inference resulting from it, is\nto be held as true. This is a requirement of reason, which announces\nits cognition as determined \u00e0 priori and as necessary, either in\nitself\u2014and in this case it needs no grounds to rest upon\u2014or, if it is\ndeduced, as a member of a series of grounds, which is itself\nunconditionally true.\nSection III. System of Transcendental Ideas\nWe are not at present engaged with a logical dialectic, which makes\ncomplete abstraction of the content of cognition and aims only at\nunveiling the illusory appearance in the form of syllogisms. Our\nsubject is transcendental dialectic, which must contain, completely \u00e0\npriori, the origin of certain cognitions drawn from pure reason, and\nthe origin of certain deduced conceptions, the object of which cannot\nbe given empirically and which therefore lie beyond the sphere of the\nfaculty of understanding. We have observed, from the natural relation\nwhich the transcendental use of our cognition, in syllogisms as well as\nin judgements, must have to the logical, that there are three kinds of\ndialectical arguments, corresponding to the three modes of conclusion,\nby which reason attains to cognitions on principles; and that in all it\nis the business of reason to ascend from the conditioned synthesis,\nbeyond which the understanding never proceeds, to the unconditioned\nwhich the understanding never can reach.\nNow the most general relations which can exist in our representations\nare: 1st, the relation to the subject; 2nd, the relation to objects,\neither as phenomena, or as objects of thought in general. If we connect\nthis subdivision with the main division, all the relations of our\nrepresentations, of which we can form either a conception or an idea,\nare threefold: 1. The relation to the subject; 2. The relation to the\nmanifold of the object as a phenomenon; 3. The relation to all things\nin general.\nNow all pure conceptions have to do in general with the synthetical\nunity of representations; conceptions of pure reason (transcendental\nideas), on the other hand, with the unconditional synthetical unity of\nall conditions. It follows that all transcendental ideas arrange\nthemselves in three classes, the first of which contains the absolute\n(unconditioned) unity of the thinking subject, the second the absolute\nunity of the series of the conditions of a phenomenon, the third the\nabsolute unity of the condition of all objects of thought in general.\nThe thinking subject is the object-matter of Psychology; the sum total\nof all phenomena (the world) is the object-matter of Cosmology; and the\nthing which contains the highest condition of the possibility of all\nthat is cogitable (the being of all beings) is the object-matter of all\nTheology. Thus pure reason presents us with the idea of a\ntranscendental doctrine of the soul (psychologia rationalis), of a\ntranscendental science of the world (cosmologia rationalis), and\nfinally of a transcendental doctrine of God (theologia\ntranscendentalis). Understanding cannot originate even the outline of\nany of these sciences, even when connected with the highest logical use\nof reason, that is, all cogitable syllogisms\u2014for the purpose of\nproceeding from one object (phenomenon) to all others, even to the\nutmost limits of the empirical synthesis. They are, on the contrary,\npure and genuine products, or problems, of pure reason.\nWhat modi of the pure conceptions of reason these transcendental ideas\nare will be fully exposed in the following chapter. They follow the\nguiding thread of the categories. For pure reason never relates\nimmediately to objects, but to the conceptions of these contained in\nthe understanding. In like manner, it will be made manifest in the\ndetailed explanation of these ideas\u2014how reason, merely through the\nsynthetical use of the same function which it employs in a categorical\nsyllogism, necessarily attains to the conception of the absolute unity\nof the thinking subject\u2014how the logical procedure in hypothetical ideas\nnecessarily produces the idea of the absolutely unconditioned in a\nseries of given conditions, and finally\u2014how the mere form of the\ndisjunctive syllogism involves the highest conception of a being of all\nbeings: a thought which at first sight seems in the highest degree\nparadoxical.\nAn objective deduction, such as we were able to present in the case of\nthe categories, is impossible as regards these transcendental ideas.\nFor they have, in truth, no relation to any object, in experience, for\nthe very reason that they are only ideas. But a subjective deduction of\nthem from the nature of our reason is possible, and has been given in\nthe present chapter.\nIt is easy to perceive that the sole aim of pure reason is the absolute\ntotality of the synthesis on the side of the conditions, and that it\ndoes not concern itself with the absolute completeness on the Part of\nthe conditioned. For of the former alone does she stand in need, in\norder to preposit the whole series of conditions, and thus present them\nto the understanding \u00e0 priori. But if we once have a completely (and\nunconditionally) given condition, there is no further necessity, in\nproceeding with the series, for a conception of reason; for the\nunderstanding takes of itself every step downward, from the condition\nto the conditioned. Thus the transcendental ideas are available only\nfor ascending in the series of conditions, till we reach the\nunconditioned, that is, principles. As regards descending to the\nconditioned, on the other hand, we find that there is a widely\nextensive logical use which reason makes of the laws of the\nunderstanding, but that a transcendental use thereof is impossible; and\nthat when we form an idea of the absolute totality of such a synthesis,\nfor example, of the whole series of all future changes in the world,\nthis idea is a mere ens rationis, an arbitrary fiction of thought, and\nnot a necessary presupposition of reason. For the possibility of the\nconditioned presupposes the totality of its conditions, but not of its\nconsequences. Consequently, this conception is not a transcendental\nidea\u2014and it is with these alone that we are at present occupied.\nFinally, it is obvious that there exists among the transcendental ideas\na certain connection and unity, and that pure reason, by means of them,\ncollects all its cognitions into one system. From the cognition of self\nto the cognition of the world, and through these to the supreme being,\nthe progression is so natural, that it seems to resemble the logical\nmarch of reason from the premisses to the conclusion.[42] Now whether\nthere lies unobserved at the foundation of these ideas an analogy of\nthe same kind as exists between the logical and transcendental\nprocedure of reason, is another of those questions, the answer to which\nwe must not expect till we arrive at a more advanced stage in our\ninquiries. In this cursory and preliminary view, we have, meanwhile,\nreached our aim. For we have dispelled the ambiguity which attached to\nthe transcendental conceptions of reason, from their being commonly\nmixed up with other conceptions in the systems of philosophers, and not\nproperly distinguished from the conceptions of the understanding; we\nhave exposed their origin and, thereby, at the same time their\ndeterminate number, and presented them in a systematic connection, and\nhave thus marked out and enclosed a definite sphere for pure reason.\n[42] The science of Metaphysics has for the proper object of its\ninquiries only three grand ideas: GOD, FREEDOM, and IMMORTALITY, and\nit aims at showing, that the second conception, conjoined with the\nfirst, must lead to the third, as a necessary conclusion. All the\nother subjects with which it occupies itself, are merely means for the\nattainment and realization of these ideas. It does not require these\nideas for the construction of a science of nature, but, on the\ncontrary, for the purpose of passing beyond the sphere of nature. A\ncomplete insight into and comprehension of them would render Theology,\nEthics, and, through the conjunction of both, Religion, solely\ndependent on the speculative faculty of reason. In a systematic\nrepresentation of these ideas the above-mentioned arrangement\u2014the\nsynthetical one\u2014would be the most suitable; but in the investigation\nwhich must necessarily precede it, the analytical, which reverses this\narrangement, would be better adapted to our purpose, as in it we\nshould proceed from that which experience immediately presents to\nus\u2014psychology, to cosmology, and thence to theology.\nTRANSCENDENTAL DIALECTIC\u2014BOOK II\u2014OF THE DIALECTICAL PROCEDURE OF PURE\nREASON\nIt may be said that the object of a merely transcendental idea is\nsomething of which we have no conception, although the idea may be a\nnecessary product of reason according to its original laws. For, in\nfact, a conception of an object that is adequate to the idea given by\nreason, is impossible. For such an object must be capable of being\npresented and intuited in a Possible experience. But we should express\nour meaning better, and with less risk of being misunderstood, if we\nsaid that we can have no knowledge of an object, which perfectly\ncorresponds to an idea, although we may possess a problematical\nconception thereof.\nNow the transcendental (subjective) reality at least of the pure\nconceptions of reason rests upon the fact that we are led to such ideas\nby a necessary procedure of reason. There must therefore be syllogisms\nwhich contain no empirical premisses, and by means of which we conclude\nfrom something that we do know, to something of which we do not even\npossess a conception, to which we, nevertheless, by an unavoidable\nillusion, ascribe objective reality. Such arguments are, as regards\ntheir result, rather to be termed sophisms than syllogisms, although\nindeed, as regards their origin, they are very well entitled to the\nlatter name, inasmuch as they are not fictions or accidental products\nof reason, but are necessitated by its very nature. They are sophisms,\nnot of men, but of pure reason herself, from which the Wisest cannot\nfree himself. After long labour he may be able to guard against the\nerror, but he can never be thoroughly rid of the illusion which\ncontinually mocks and misleads him.\nOf these dialectical arguments there are three kinds, corresponding\nto the number of the ideas which their conclusions present. In the\nargument or syllogism of the first class, I conclude, from the\ntranscendental conception of the subject which contains no manifold,\nthe absolute unity of the subject itself, of which I cannot in this\nmanner attain to a conception. This dialectical argument I shall\ncall the transcendental paralogism. The second class of sophistical\narguments is occupied with the transcendental conception of the\nabsolute totality of the series of conditions for a given phenomenon,\nand I conclude, from the fact that I have always a self-contradictory\nconception of the unconditioned synthetical unity of the series upon\none side, the truth of the opposite unity, of which I have nevertheless\nno conception. The condition of reason in these dialectical arguments,\nI shall term the antinomy of pure reason. Finally, according to the\nthird kind of sophistical argument, I conclude, from the totality of\nthe conditions of thinking objects in general, in so far as they can\nbe given, the absolute synthetical unity of all conditions of the\npossibility of things in general; that is, from things which I do not\nknow in their mere transcendental conception, I conclude a being of all\nbeings which I know still less by means of a transcendental conception,\nand of whose unconditioned necessity I can form no conception whatever.\nThis dialectical argument I shall call the ideal of pure reason.\nChapter I. Of the Paralogisms of Pure Reason\nThe logical paralogism consists in the falsity of an argument in\nrespect of its form, be the content what it may. But a transcendental\nparalogism has a transcendental foundation, and concludes falsely,\nwhile the form is correct and unexceptionable. In this manner the\nparalogism has its foundation in the nature of human reason, and is the\nparent of an unavoidable, though not insoluble, mental illusion.\nWe now come to a conception which was not inserted in the general list\nof transcendental conceptions, and yet must be reckoned with them, but\nat the same time without in the least altering, or indicating a\ndeficiency in that table. This is the conception, or, if the term is\npreferred, the judgement, \u201cI think.\u201d But it is readily perceived that\nthis thought is as it were the vehicle of all conceptions in general,\nand consequently of transcendental conceptions also, and that it is\ntherefore regarded as a transcendental conception, although it can have\nno peculiar claim to be so ranked, inasmuch as its only use is to\nindicate that all thought is accompanied by consciousness. At the same\ntime, pure as this conception is from empirical content (impressions of\nthe senses), it enables us to distinguish two different kinds of\nobjects. \u201cI,\u201d as thinking, am an object of the internal sense, and am\ncalled soul. That which is an object of the external senses is called\nbody. Thus the expression, \u201cI,\u201d as a thinking being, designates the\nobject-matter of psychology, which may be called \u201cthe rational doctrine\nof the soul,\u201d inasmuch as in this science I desire to know nothing of\nthe soul but what, independently of all experience (which determines me\nin concreto), may be concluded from this conception \u201cI,\u201d in so far as\nit appears in all thought.\nNow, the rational doctrine of the soul is really an undertaking of this\nkind. For if the smallest empirical element of thought, if any\nparticular perception of my internal state, were to be introduced among\nthe grounds of cognition of this science, it would not be a rational,\nbut an empirical doctrine of the soul. We have thus before us a\npretended science, raised upon the single proposition, \u201cI think,\u201d whose\nfoundation or want of foundation we may very properly, and agreeably\nwith the nature of a transcendental philosophy, here examine. It ought\nnot to be objected that in this proposition, which expresses the\nperception of one\u2019s self, an internal experience is asserted, and that\nconsequently the rational doctrine of the soul which is founded upon\nit, is not pure, but partly founded upon an empirical principle. For\nthis internal perception is nothing more than the mere apperception, \u201cI\nthink,\u201d which in fact renders all transcendental conceptions possible,\nin which we say, \u201cI think substance, cause, etc.\u201d For internal\nexperience in general and its possibility, or perception in general,\nand its relation to other perceptions, unless some particular\ndistinction or determination thereof is empirically given, cannot be\nregarded as empirical cognition, but as cognition of the empirical, and\nbelongs to the investigation of the possibility of every experience,\nwhich is certainly transcendental. The smallest object of experience\n(for example, only pleasure or pain), that should be included in the\ngeneral representation of self-consciousness, would immediately change\nthe rational into an empirical psychology.\n\u201cI think\u201d is therefore the only text of rational psychology, from which\nit must develop its whole system. It is manifest that this thought,\nwhen applied to an object (myself), can contain nothing but\ntranscendental predicates thereof; because the least empirical\npredicate would destroy the purity of the science and its independence\nof all experience.\nBut we shall have to follow here the guidance of the categories\u2014only,\nas in the present case a thing, \u201cI,\u201d as thinking being, is at first\ngiven, we shall\u2014not indeed change the order of the categories as it\nstands in the table\u2014but begin at the category of substance, by which at\nthe a thing in itself is represented and proceeds backwards through the\nseries. The topic of the rational doctrine of the soul, from which\neverything else it may contain must be deduced, is accordingly as\nfollows:\n1                          2\nThe Soul is SUBSTANCE       As regards its quality\nit is SIMPLE\n3\nAs regards the different\ntimes in which it exists,\nit is numerically identical,\nthat is UNITY, not Plurality.\n4\nIt is in relation to possible objects in space[43]\n[43] The reader, who may not so easily perceive the psychological\nsense of these expressions, taken here in their transcendental\nabstraction, and cannot guess why the latter attribute of the soul\nbelongs to the category of existence, will find the expressions\nsufficiently explained and justified in the sequel. I have, moreover,\nto apologize for the Latin terms which have been employed, instead of\ntheir German synonyms, contrary to the rules of correct writing. But I\njudged it better to sacrifice elegance to perspicuity.\nFrom these elements originate all the conceptions of pure psychology,\nby combination alone, without the aid of any other principle. This\nsubstance, merely as an object of the internal sense, gives the\nconception of Immateriality; as simple substance, that of\nIncorruptibility; its identity, as intellectual substance, gives the\nconception of Personality; all these three together, Spirituality. Its\nrelation to objects in space gives us the conception of connection\n(commercium) with bodies. Thus it represents thinking substance as the\nprinciple of life in matter, that is, as a soul (anima), and as the\nground of Animality; and this, limited and determined by the conception\nof spirituality, gives us that of Immortality.\nNow to these conceptions relate four paralogisms of a transcendental\npsychology, which is falsely held to be a science of pure reason,\ntouching the nature of our thinking being. We can, however, lay at the\nfoundation of this science nothing but the simple and in itself\nperfectly contentless representation \u201ci\u201d which cannot even be called a\nconception, but merely a consciousness which accompanies all\nconceptions. By this \u201cI,\u201d or \u201cHe,\u201d or \u201cIt,\u201d who or which thinks,\nnothing more is represented than a transcendental subject of thought =\nx, which is cognized only by means of the thoughts that are its\npredicates, and of which, apart from these, we cannot form the least\nconception. Hence in a perpetual circle, inasmuch as we must always\nemploy it, in order to frame any judgement respecting it. And this\ninconvenience we find it impossible to rid ourselves of, because\nconsciousness in itself is not so much a representation distinguishing\na particular object, as a form of representation in general, in so far\nas it may be termed cognition; for in and by cognition alone do I think\nanything.\nIt must, however, appear extraordinary at first sight that the\ncondition under which I think, and which is consequently a property of\nmy subject, should be held to be likewise valid for every existence\nwhich thinks, and that we can presume to base upon a seemingly\nempirical proposition a judgement which is apodeictic and universal, to\nwit, that everything which thinks is constituted as the voice of my\nconsciousness declares it to be, that is, as a self-conscious being.\nThe cause of this belief is to be found in the fact that we necessarily\nattribute to things \u00e0 priori all the properties which constitute\nconditions under which alone we can cogitate them. Now I cannot obtain\nthe least representation of a thinking being by means of external\nexperience, but solely through self-consciousness. Such objects are\nconsequently nothing more than the transference of this consciousness\nof mine to other things which can only thus be represented as thinking\nbeings. The proposition, \u201cI think,\u201d is, in the present case, understood\nin a problematical sense, not in so far as it contains a perception of\nan existence (like the Cartesian \u201cCogito, ergo sum\u201d), but in regard to\nits mere possibility\u2014for the purpose of discovering what properties may\nbe inferred from so simple a proposition and predicated of the subject\nof it.\nIf at the foundation of our pure rational cognition of thinking beings\nthere lay more than the mere Cogito\u2014if we could likewise call in aid\nobservations on the play of our thoughts, and the thence derived\nnatural laws of the thinking self, there would arise an empirical\npsychology which would be a kind of physiology of the internal sense\nand might possibly be capable of explaining the phenomena of that\nsense. But it could never be available for discovering those properties\nwhich do not belong to possible experience (such as the quality of\nsimplicity), nor could it make any apodeictic enunciation on the nature\nof thinking beings: it would therefore not be a rational psychology.\nNow, as the proposition \u201cI think\u201d (in the problematical sense) contains\nthe form of every judgement in general and is the constant\naccompaniment of all the categories, it is manifest that conclusions\nare drawn from it only by a transcendental employment of the\nunderstanding. This use of the understanding excludes all empirical\nelements; and we cannot, as has been shown above, have any favourable\nconception beforehand of its procedure. We shall therefore follow with\na critical eye this proposition through all the predicaments of pure\npsychology; but we shall, for brevity\u2019s sake, allow this examination to\nproceed in an uninterrupted connection.\nBefore entering on this task, however, the following general remark may\nhelp to quicken our attention to this mode of argument. It is not\nmerely through my thinking that I cognize an object, but only through\nmy determining a given intuition in relation to the unity of\nconsciousness in which all thinking consists. It follows that I cognize\nmyself, not through my being conscious of myself as thinking, but only\nwhen I am conscious of the intuition of myself as determined in\nrelation to the function of thought. All the modi of self-consciousness\nin thought are hence not conceptions of objects (conceptions of the\nunderstanding\u2014categories); they are mere logical functions, which do\nnot present to thought an object to be cognized, and cannot therefore\npresent my Self as an object. Not the consciousness of the determining,\nbut only that of the determinable self, that is, of my internal\nintuition (in so far as the manifold contained in it can be connected\nconformably with the general condition of the unity of apperception in\nthought), is the object.\n1. In all judgements I am the determining subject of that relation\nwhich constitutes a judgement. But that the I which thinks, must be\nconsidered as in thought always a subject, and as a thing which cannot\nbe a predicate to thought, is an apodeictic and identical proposition.\nBut this proposition does not signify that I, as an object, am, for\nmyself, a self-subsistent being or substance. This latter statement\u2014an\nambitious one\u2014requires to be supported by data which are not to be\ndiscovered in thought; and are perhaps (in so far as I consider the\nthinking self merely as such) not to be discovered in the thinking self\nat all.\n2. That the I or Ego of apperception, and consequently in all thought,\nis singular or simple, and cannot be resolved into a plurality of\nsubjects, and therefore indicates a logically simple subject\u2014this is\nself-evident from the very conception of an Ego, and is consequently an\nanalytical proposition. But this is not tantamount to declaring that\nthe thinking Ego is a simple substance\u2014for this would be a synthetical\nproposition. The conception of substance always relates to intuitions,\nwhich with me cannot be other than sensuous, and which consequently lie\ncompletely out of the sphere of the understanding and its thought: but\nto this sphere belongs the affirmation that the Ego is simple in\nthought. It would indeed be surprising, if the conception of\n\u201csubstance,\u201d which in other cases requires so much labour to\ndistinguish from the other elements presented by intuition\u2014so much\ntrouble, too, to discover whether it can be simple (as in the case of\nthe parts of matter)\u2014should be presented immediately to me, as if by\nrevelation, in the poorest mental representation of all.\n3. The proposition of the identity of my Self amidst all the manifold\nrepresentations of which I am conscious, is likewise a proposition\nlying in the conceptions themselves, and is consequently analytical.\nBut this identity of the subject, of which I am conscious in all its\nrepresentations, does not relate to or concern the intuition of the\nsubject, by which it is given as an object. This proposition cannot\ntherefore enounce the identity of the person, by which is understood\nthe consciousness of the identity of its own substance as a thinking\nbeing in all change and variation of circumstances. To prove this, we\nshould require not a mere analysis of the proposition, but synthetical\njudgements based upon a given intuition.\n4. I distinguish my own existence, as that of a thinking being, from\nthat of other things external to me\u2014among which my body also is\nreckoned. This is also an analytical proposition, for other things are\nexactly those which I think as different or distinguished from myself.\nBut whether this consciousness of myself is possible without things\nexternal to me; and whether therefore I can exist merely as a thinking\nbeing (without being man)\u2014cannot be known or inferred from this\nproposition.\nThus we have gained nothing as regards the cognition of myself as\nobject, by the analysis of the consciousness of my Self in thought. The\nlogical exposition of thought in general is mistaken for a metaphysical\ndetermination of the object.\nOur Critique would be an investigation utterly superfluous, if there\nexisted a possibility of proving \u00e0 priori, that all thinking beings are\nin themselves simple substances, as such, therefore, possess the\ninseparable attribute of personality, and are conscious of their\nexistence apart from and unconnected with matter. For we should thus\nhave taken a step beyond the world of sense, and have penetrated into\nthe sphere of noumena; and in this case the right could not be denied\nus of extending our knowledge in this sphere, of establishing\nourselves, and, under a favouring star, appropriating to ourselves\npossessions in it. For the proposition: \u201cEvery thinking being, as such,\nis simple substance,\u201d is an \u00e0 priori synthetical proposition; because\nin the first place it goes beyond the conception which is the subject\nof it, and adds to the mere notion of a thinking being the mode of its\nexistence, and in the second place annexes a predicate (that of\nsimplicity) to the latter conception\u2014a predicate which it could not\nhave discovered in the sphere of experience. It would follow that \u00e0\npriori synthetical propositions are possible and legitimate, not only,\nas we have maintained, in relation to objects of possible experience,\nand as principles of the possibility of this experience itself, but are\napplicable to things in themselves\u2014an inference which makes an end of\nthe whole of this Critique, and obliges us to fall back on the old mode\nof metaphysical procedure. But indeed the danger is not so great, if we\nlook a little closer into the question.\nThere lurks in the procedure of rational Psychology a paralogism, which\nis represented in the following syllogism:\nThat which cannot be cogitated otherwise than as subject, does not\nexist otherwise than as subject, and is therefore substance.\nA thinking being, considered merely as such, cannot be cogitated\notherwise than as subject.\nTherefore it exists also as such, that is, as substance.\nIn the major we speak of a being that can be cogitated generally and in\nevery relation, consequently as it may be given in intuition. But in\nthe minor we speak of the same being only in so far as it regards\nitself as subject, relatively to thought and the unity of\nconsciousness, but not in relation to intuition, by which it is\npresented as an object to thought. Thus the conclusion is here arrived\nat by a Sophisma figurae dictionis.[44]\n[44] Thought is taken in the two premisses in two totally different\nsenses. In the major it is considered as relating and applying to\nobjects in general, consequently to objects of intuition also. In the\nminor, we understand it as relating merely to self-consciousness. In\nthis sense, we do not cogitate an object, but merely the relation to\nthe self-consciousness of the subject, as the form of thought. In the\nformer premiss we speak of things which cannot be cogitated otherwise\nthan as subjects. In the second, we do not speak of things, but of\nthought (all objects being abstracted), in which the Ego is always the\nsubject of consciousness. Hence the conclusion cannot be, \u201cI cannot\nexist otherwise than as subject\u201d; but only \u201cI can, in cogitating my\nexistence, employ my Ego only as the subject of the judgement.\u201d But\nthis is an identical proposition, and throws no light on the mode of\nmy existence.\nThat this famous argument is a mere paralogism, will be plain to any\none who will consider the general remark which precedes our exposition\nof the principles of the pure understanding, and the section on\nnoumena. For it was there proved that the conception of a thing, which\ncan exist per se\u2014only as a subject and never as a predicate, possesses\nno objective reality; that is to say, we can never know whether there\nexists any object to correspond to the conception; consequently, the\nconception is nothing more than a conception, and from it we derive no\nproper knowledge. If this conception is to indicate by the term\nsubstance, an object that can be given, if it is to become a cognition,\nwe must have at the foundation of the cognition a permanent intuition,\nas the indispensable condition of its objective reality. For through\nintuition alone can an object be given. But in internal intuition there\nis nothing permanent, for the Ego is but the consciousness of my\nthought. If then, we appeal merely to thought, we cannot discover the\nnecessary condition of the application of the conception of\nsubstance\u2014that is, of a subject existing per se\u2014to the subject as a\nthinking being. And thus the conception of the simple nature of\nsubstance, which is connected with the objective reality of this\nconception, is shown to be also invalid, and to be, in fact, nothing\nmore than the logical qualitative unity of self-consciousness in\nthought; whilst we remain perfectly ignorant whether the subject is\ncomposite or not.\nRefutation of the Argument of Mendelssohn for the Substantiality or\nPermanence of the Soul.\nThis acute philosopher easily perceived the insufficiency of the common\nargument which attempts to prove that the soul\u2014it being granted that it\nis a simple being\u2014cannot perish by dissolution or decomposition; he saw\nit is not impossible for it to cease to be by extinction, or\ndisappearance. He endeavoured to prove in his Phaedo, that the soul\ncannot be annihilated, by showing that a simple being cannot cease to\nexist. Inasmuch as, he said, a simple existence cannot diminish, nor\ngradually lose portions of its being, and thus be by degrees reduced to\nnothing (for it possesses no parts, and therefore no multiplicity),\nbetween the moment in which it is, and the moment in which it is not,\nno time can be discovered\u2014which is impossible. But this philosopher did\nnot consider that, granting the soul to possess this simple nature,\nwhich contains no parts external to each other and consequently no\nextensive quantity, we cannot refuse to it any less than to any other\nbeing, intensive quantity, that is, a degree of reality in regard to\nall its faculties, nay, to all that constitutes its existence. But this\ndegree of reality can become less and less through an infinite series\nof smaller degrees. It follows, therefore, that this supposed\nsubstance\u2014this thing, the permanence of which is not assured in any\nother way, may, if not by decomposition, by gradual loss (remissio) of\nits powers (consequently by elanguescence, if I may employ this\nexpression), be changed into nothing. For consciousness itself has\nalways a degree, which may be lessened.[45] Consequently the faculty of\nbeing conscious may be diminished; and so with all other faculties. The\npermanence of the soul, therefore, as an object of the internal sense,\nremains undemonstrated, nay, even indemonstrable. Its permanence in\nlife is evident, per se, inasmuch as the thinking being (as man) is to\nitself, at the same time, an object of the external senses. But this\ndoes not authorize the rational psychologist to affirm, from mere\nconceptions, its permanence beyond life.[46]\n[45] Clearness is not, as logicians maintain, the consciousness of a\nrepresentation. For a certain degree of consciousness, which may not,\nhowever, be sufficient for recollection, is to be met with in many dim\nrepresentations. For without any consciousness at all, we should not\nbe able to recognize any difference in the obscure representations we\nconnect; as we really can do with many conceptions, such as those of\nright and justice, and those of the musician, who strikes at once\nseveral notes in improvising a piece of music. But a representation is\nclear, in which our consciousness is sufficient for the consciousness\nof the difference of this representation from others. If we are only\nconscious that there is a difference, but are not conscious of the\ndifference\u2014that is, what the difference is\u2014the representation must be\ntermed obscure. There is, consequently, an infinite series of degrees\nof consciousness down to its entire disappearance.\n[46] There are some who think they have done enough to establish a new\npossibility in the mode of the existence of souls, when they have\nshown that there is no contradiction in their hypotheses on this\nsubject. Such are those who affirm the possibility of thought\u2014of which\nthey have no other knowledge than what they derive from its use in\nconnecting empirical intuitions presented in this our human life\u2014after\nthis life has ceased. But it is very easy to embarrass them by the\nintroduction of counter-possibilities, which rest upon quite as good a\nfoundation. Such, for example, is the possibility of the division of a\nsimple substance into several substances; and conversely, of the\ncoalition of several into one simple substance. For, although\ndivisibility presupposes composition, it does not necessarily require\na composition of substances, but only of the degrees (of the several\nfaculties) of one and the same substance. Now we can cogitate all the\npowers and faculties of the soul\u2014even that of consciousness\u2014as\ndiminished by one half, the substance still remaining. In the same way\nwe can represent to ourselves without contradiction, this obliterated\nhalf as preserved, not in the soul, but without it; and we can believe\nthat, as in this case every thing that is real in the soul, and has a\ndegree\u2014consequently its entire existence\u2014has been halved, a particular\nsubstance would arise out of the soul. For the multiplicity, which has\nbeen divided, formerly existed, but not as a multiplicity of\nsubstances, but of every reality as the quantum of existence in it;\nand the unity of substance was merely a mode of existence, which by\nthis division alone has been transformed into a plurality of\nsubsistence. In the same manner several simple substances might\ncoalesce into one, without anything being lost except the plurality of\nsubsistence, inasmuch as the one substance would contain the degree of\nreality of all the former substances. Perhaps, indeed, the simple\nsubstances, which appear under the form of matter, might (not indeed\nby a mechanical or chemical influence upon each other, but by an\nunknown influence, of which the former would be but the phenomenal\nappearance), by means of such a dynamical division of the\nparent-souls, as intensive quantities, produce other souls, while the\nformer repaired the loss thus sustained with new matter of the same\nsort. I am far from allowing any value to such chimeras; and the\nprinciples of our analytic have clearly proved that no other than an\nempirical use of the categories\u2014that of substance, for example\u2014is\npossible. But if the rationalist is bold enough to construct, on the\nmere authority of the faculty of thought\u2014without any intuition,\nwhereby an object is given\u2014a self-subsistent being, merely because the\nunity of apperception in thought cannot allow him to believe it a\ncomposite being, instead of declaring, as he ought to do, that he is\nunable to explain the possibility of a thinking nature; what ought to\nhinder the materialist, with as complete an independence of\nexperience, to employ the principle of the rationalist in a directly\nopposite manner\u2014still preserving the formal unity required by his\nopponent?\nIf, now, we take the above propositions\u2014as they must be accepted as\nvalid for all thinking beings in the system of rational psychology\u2014in\nsynthetical connection, and proceed, from the category of relation,\nwith the proposition: \u201cAll thinking beings are, as such, substances,\u201d\nbackwards through the series, till the circle is completed; we come at\nlast to their existence, of which, in this system of rational\npsychology, substances are held to be conscious, independently of\nexternal things; nay, it is asserted that, in relation to the\npermanence which is a necessary characteristic of substance, they can\nof themselves determine external things. It follows that idealism\u2014at\nleast problematical idealism, is perfectly unavoidable in this\nrationalistic system. And, if the existence of outward things is not\nheld to be requisite to the determination of the existence of a\nsubstance in time, the existence of these outward things at all, is a\ngratuitous assumption which remains without the possibility of a proof.\nBut if we proceed analytically\u2014the \u201cI think\u201d as a proposition\ncontaining in itself an existence as given, consequently modality being\nthe principle\u2014and dissect this proposition, in order to ascertain its\ncontent, and discover whether and how this Ego determines its existence\nin time and space without the aid of anything external; the\npropositions of rationalistic psychology would not begin with the\nconception of a thinking being, but with a reality, and the properties\nof a thinking being in general would be deduced from the mode in which\nthis reality is cogitated, after everything empirical had been\nabstracted; as is shown in the following table:\n1\nI think,\n2                             3\nas Subject,              as simple Subject,\n4\nas identical Subject,\nin every state of my thought.\nNow, inasmuch as it is not determined in this second proposition,\nwhether I can exist and be cogitated only as subject, and not also as a\npredicate of another being, the conception of a subject is here taken\nin a merely logical sense; and it remains undetermined, whether\nsubstance is to be cogitated under the conception or not. But in the\nthird proposition, the absolute unity of apperception\u2014the simple Ego in\nthe representation to which all connection and separation, which\nconstitute thought, relate, is of itself important; even although it\npresents us with no information about the constitution or subsistence\nof the subject. Apperception is something real, and the simplicity of\nits nature is given in the very fact of its possibility. Now in space\nthere is nothing real that is at the same time simple; for points,\nwhich are the only simple things in space, are merely limits, but not\nconstituent parts of space. From this follows the impossibility of a\ndefinition on the basis of materialism of the constitution of my Ego as\na merely thinking subject. But, because my existence is considered in\nthe first proposition as given, for it does not mean, \u201cEvery thinking\nbeing exists\u201d (for this would be predicating of them absolute\nnecessity), but only, \u201cI exist thinking\u201d; the proposition is quite\nempirical, and contains the determinability of my existence merely in\nrelation to my representations in time. But as I require for this\npurpose something that is permanent, such as is not given in internal\nintuition; the mode of my existence, whether as substance or as\naccident, cannot be determined by means of this simple\nself-consciousness. Thus, if materialism is inadequate to explain the\nmode in which I exist, spiritualism is likewise as insufficient; and\nthe conclusion is that we are utterly unable to attain to any knowledge\nof the constitution of the soul, in so far as relates to the\npossibility of its existence apart from external objects.\nAnd, indeed, how should it be possible, merely by the aid of the unity\nof consciousness\u2014which we cognize only for the reason that it is\nindispensable to the possibility of experience\u2014to pass the bounds of\nexperience (our existence in this life); and to extend our cognition to\nthe nature of all thinking beings by means of the empirical\u2014but in\nrelation to every sort of intuition, perfectly\nundetermined\u2014proposition, \u201cI think\u201d?\nThere does not then exist any rational psychology as a doctrine\nfurnishing any addition to our knowledge of ourselves. It is nothing\nmore than a discipline, which sets impassable limits to speculative\nreason in this region of thought, to prevent it, on the one hand, from\nthrowing itself into the arms of a soulless materialism, and, on the\nother, from losing itself in the mazes of a baseless spiritualism. It\nteaches us to consider this refusal of our reason to give any\nsatisfactory answer to questions which reach beyond the limits of this\nour human life, as a hint to abandon fruitless speculation; and to\ndirect, to a practical use, our knowledge of ourselves\u2014which, although\napplicable only to objects of experience, receives its principles from\na higher source, and regulates its procedure as if our destiny reached\nfar beyond the boundaries of experience and life.\nFrom all this it is evident that rational psychology has its origin in\na mere misunderstanding. The unity of consciousness, which lies at the\nbasis of the categories, is considered to be an intuition of the\nsubject as an object; and the category of substance is applied to the\nintuition. But this unity is nothing more than the unity in thought, by\nwhich no object is given; to which therefore the category of\nsubstance\u2014which always presupposes a given intuition\u2014cannot be applied.\nConsequently, the subject cannot be cognized. The subject of the\ncategories cannot, therefore, for the very reason that it cogitates\nthese, frame any conception of itself as an object of the categories;\nfor, to cogitate these, it must lay at the foundation its own pure\nself-consciousness\u2014the very thing that it wishes to explain and\ndescribe. In like manner, the subject, in which the representation of\ntime has its basis, cannot determine, for this very reason, its own\nexistence in time. Now, if the latter is impossible, the former, as an\nattempt to determine itself by means of the categories as a thinking\nbeing in general, is no less so.[47]\n[47] The \u201cI think\u201d is, as has been already stated, an empirical\nproposition, and contains the proposition, \u201cI exist.\u201d But I cannot\nsay, \u201cEverything, which thinks, exists\u201d; for in this case the property\nof thought would constitute all beings possessing it, necessary\nbeings. Hence my existence cannot be considered as an inference from\nthe proposition, \u201cI think,\u201d as Descartes maintained\u2014because in this\ncase the major premiss, \u201cEverything, which thinks, exists,\u201d must\nprecede\u2014but the two propositions are identical. The proposition, \u201cI\nthink,\u201d expresses an undetermined empirical intuition, that perception\n(proving consequently that sensation, which must belong to\nsensibility, lies at the foundation of this proposition); but it\nprecedes experience, whose province it is to determine an object of\nperception by means of the categories in relation to time; and\nexistence in this proposition is not a category, as it does not apply\nto an undetermined given object, but only to one of which we have a\nconception, and about which we wish to know whether it does or does\nnot exist, out of, and apart from this conception. An undetermined\nperception signifies here merely something real that has been given,\nonly, however, to thought in general\u2014but not as a phenomenon, nor as a\nthing in itself (noumenon), but only as something that really exists,\nand is designated as such in the proposition, \u201cI think.\u201d For it must\nbe remarked that, when I call the proposition, \u201cI think,\u201d an empirical\nproposition, I do not thereby mean that the Ego in the proposition is\nan empirical representation; on the contrary, it is purely\nintellectual, because it belongs to thought in general. But without\nsome empirical representation, which presents to the mind material for\nthought, the mental act, \u201cI think,\u201d would not take place; and the\nempirical is only the condition of the application or employment of\nthe pure intellectual faculty.\nThus, then, appears the vanity of the hope of establishing a cognition\nwhich is to extend its rule beyond the limits of experience\u2014a cognition\nwhich is one of the highest interests of humanity; and thus is proved\nthe futility of the attempt of speculative philosophy in this region of\nthought. But, in this interest of thought, the severity of criticism\nhas rendered to reason a not unimportant service, by the demonstration\nof the impossibility of making any dogmatical affirmation concerning an\nobject of experience beyond the boundaries of experience. She has thus\nfortified reason against all affirmations of the contrary. Now, this\ncan be accomplished in only two ways. Either our proposition must be\nproved apodeictically; or, if this is unsuccessful, the sources of this\ninability must be sought for, and, if these are discovered to exist in\nthe natural and necessary limitation of our reason, our opponents must\nsubmit to the same law of renunciation and refrain from advancing\nclaims to dogmatic assertion.\nBut the right, say rather the necessity to admit a future life, upon\nprinciples of the practical conjoined with the speculative use of\nreason, has lost nothing by this renunciation; for the merely\nspeculative proof has never had any influence upon the common reason of\nmen. It stands upon the point of a hair, so that even the schools have\nbeen able to preserve it from falling only by incessantly discussing it\nand spinning it like a top; and even in their eyes it has never been\nable to present any safe foundation for the erection of a theory. The\nproofs which have been current among men, preserve their value\nundiminished; nay, rather gain in clearness and unsophisticated power,\nby the rejection of the dogmatical assumptions of speculative reason.\nFor reason is thus confined within her own peculiar province\u2014the\narrangement of ends or aims, which is at the same time the arrangement\nof nature; and, as a practical faculty, without limiting itself to the\nlatter, it is justified in extending the former, and with it our own\nexistence, beyond the boundaries of experience and life. If we turn our\nattention to the analogy of the nature of living beings in this world,\nin the consideration of which reason is obliged to accept as a\nprinciple that no organ, no faculty, no appetite is useless, and that\nnothing is superfluous, nothing disproportionate to its use, nothing\nunsuited to its end; but that, on the contrary, everything is perfectly\nconformed to its destination in life\u2014we shall find that man, who alone\nis the final end and aim of this order, is still the only animal that\nseems to be excepted from it. For his natural gifts\u2014not merely as\nregards the talents and motives that may incite him to employ them, but\nespecially the moral law in him\u2014stretch so far beyond all mere earthly\nutility and advantage, that he feels himself bound to prize the mere\nconsciousness of probity, apart from all advantageous consequences\u2014even\nthe shadowy gift of posthumous fame\u2014above everything; and he is\nconscious of an inward call to constitute himself, by his conduct in\nthis world\u2014without regard to mere sublunary interests\u2014the citizen of a\nbetter. This mighty, irresistible proof\u2014accompanied by an\never-increasing knowledge of the conformability to a purpose in\neverything we see around us, by the conviction of the boundless\nimmensity of creation, by the consciousness of a certain\nillimitableness in the possible extension of our knowledge, and by a\ndesire commensurate therewith\u2014remains to humanity, even after the\ntheoretical cognition of ourselves has failed to establish the\nnecessity of an existence after death.\nConclusion of the Solution of the Psychological Paralogism.\nThe dialectical illusion in rational psychology arises from our\nconfounding an idea of reason (of a pure intelligence) with the\nconception\u2014in every respect undetermined\u2014of a thinking being in\ngeneral. I cogitate myself in behalf of a possible experience, at the\nsame time making abstraction of all actual experience; and infer\ntherefrom that I can be conscious of myself apart from experience and\nits empirical conditions. I consequently confound the possible\nabstraction of my empirically determined existence with the supposed\nconsciousness of a possible separate existence of my thinking self; and\nI believe that I cognize what is substantial in myself as a\ntranscendental subject, when I have nothing more in thought than the\nunity of consciousness, which lies at the basis of all determination of\ncognition.\nThe task of explaining the community of the soul with the body does not\nproperly belong to the psychology of which we are here speaking;\nbecause it proposes to prove the personality of the soul apart from\nthis communion (after death), and is therefore transcendent in the\nproper sense of the word, although occupying itself with an object of\nexperience\u2014only in so far, however, as it ceases to be an object of\nexperience. But a sufficient answer may be found to the question in our\nsystem. The difficulty which lies in the execution of this task\nconsists, as is well known, in the presupposed heterogeneity of the\nobject of the internal sense (the soul) and the objects of the external\nsenses; inasmuch as the formal condition of the intuition of the one is\ntime, and of that of the other space also. But if we consider that both\nkinds of objects do not differ internally, but only in so far as the\none appears externally to the other\u2014consequently, that what lies at the\nbasis of phenomena, as a thing in itself, may not be heterogeneous;\nthis difficulty disappears. There then remains no other difficulty than\nis to be found in the question\u2014how a community of substances is\npossible; a question which lies out of the region of psychology, and\nwhich the reader, after what in our analytic has been said of primitive\nforces and faculties, will easily judge to be also beyond the region of\nhuman cognition.\nGENERAL REMARK\nOn the Transition from Rational Psychology to Cosmology.\nThe proposition, \u201cI think,\u201d or, \u201cI exist thinking,\u201d is an empirical\nproposition. But such a proposition must be based on empirical\nintuition, and the object cogitated as a phenomenon; and thus our\ntheory appears to maintain that the soul, even in thought, is merely a\nphenomenon; and in this way our consciousness itself, in fact, abuts\nupon nothing.\nThought, per se, is merely the purely spontaneous logical function\nwhich operates to connect the manifold of a possible intuition; and it\ndoes not represent the subject of consciousness as a phenomenon\u2014for\nthis reason alone, that it pays no attention to the question whether\nthe mode of intuiting it is sensuous or intellectual. I therefore do\nnot represent myself in thought either as I am, or as I appear to\nmyself; I merely cogitate myself as an object in general, of the mode\nof intuiting which I make abstraction. When I represent myself as the\nsubject of thought, or as the ground of thought, these modes of\nrepresentation are not related to the categories of substance or of\ncause; for these are functions of thought applicable only to our\nsensuous intuition. The application of these categories to the Ego\nwould, however, be necessary, if I wished to make myself an object of\nknowledge. But I wish to be conscious of myself only as thinking; in\nwhat mode my Self is given in intuition, I do not consider, and it may\nbe that I, who think, am a phenomenon\u2014although not in so far as I am a\nthinking being; but in the consciousness of myself in mere thought I am\na being, though this consciousness does not present to me any property\nof this being as material for thought.\nBut the proposition, \u201cI think,\u201d in so far as it declares, \u201cI exist\nthinking,\u201d is not the mere representation of a logical function. It\ndetermines the subject (which is in this case an object also) in\nrelation to existence; and it cannot be given without the aid of the\ninternal sense, whose intuition presents to us an object, not as a\nthing in itself, but always as a phenomenon. In this proposition there\nis therefore something more to be found than the mere spontaneity of\nthought; there is also the receptivity of intuition, that is, my\nthought of myself applied to the empirical intuition of myself. Now, in\nthis intuition the thinking self must seek the conditions of the\nemployment of its logical functions as categories of substance, cause,\nand so forth; not merely for the purpose of distinguishing itself as an\nobject in itself by means of the representation \u201cI,\u201d but also for the\npurpose of determining the mode of its existence, that is, of cognizing\nitself as noumenon. But this is impossible, for the internal empirical\nintuition is sensuous, and presents us with nothing but phenomenal\ndata, which do not assist the object of pure consciousness in its\nattempt to cognize itself as a separate existence, but are useful only\nas contributions to experience.\nBut, let it be granted that we could discover, not in experience, but\nin certain firmly-established \u00e0 priori laws of the use of pure\nreason\u2014laws relating to our existence, authority to consider ourselves\nas legislating \u00e0 priori in relation to our own existence and as\ndetermining this existence; we should, on this supposition, find\nourselves possessed of a spontaneity, by which our actual existence\nwould be determinable, without the aid of the conditions of empirical\nintuition. We should also become aware that in the consciousness of our\nexistence there was an \u00e0 priori content, which would serve to determine\nour own existence\u2014an existence only sensuously determinable\u2014relatively,\nhowever, to a certain internal faculty in relation to an intelligible\nworld.\nBut this would not give the least help to the attempts of rational\npsychology. For this wonderful faculty, which the consciousness of the\nmoral law in me reveals, would present me with a principle of the\ndetermination of my own existence which is purely intellectual\u2014but by\nwhat predicates? By none other than those which are given in sensuous\nintuition. Thus I should find myself in the same position in rational\npsychology which I formerly occupied, that is to say, I should find\nmyself still in need of sensuous intuitions, in order to give\nsignificance to my conceptions of substance and cause, by means of\nwhich alone I can possess a knowledge of myself: but these intuitions\ncan never raise me above the sphere of experience. I should be\njustified, however, in applying these conceptions, in regard to their\npractical use, which is always directed to objects of experience\u2014in\nconformity with their analogical significance when employed\ntheoretically\u2014to freedom and its subject. At the same time, I should\nunderstand by them merely the logical functions of subject and\npredicate, of principle and consequence, in conformity with which all\nactions are so determined, that they are capable of being explained\nalong with the laws of nature, conformably to the categories of\nsubstance and cause, although they originate from a very different\nprinciple. We have made these observations for the purpose of guarding\nagainst misunderstanding, to which the doctrine of our intuition of\nself as a phenomenon is exposed. We shall have occasion to perceive\ntheir utility in the sequel.\nChapter II. The Antinomy of Pure Reason\nWe showed in the introduction to this part of our work, that all\ntranscendental illusion of pure reason arose from dialectical\narguments, the schema of which logic gives us in its three formal\nspecies of syllogisms\u2014just as the categories find their logical schema\nin the four functions of all judgements. The first kind of these\nsophistical arguments related to the unconditioned unity of the\nsubjective conditions of all representations in general (of the subject\nor soul), in correspondence with the categorical syllogisms, the major\nof which, as the principle, enounces the relation of a predicate to a\nsubject. The second kind of dialectical argument will therefore be\nconcerned, following the analogy with hypothetical syllogisms, with the\nunconditioned unity of the objective conditions in the phenomenon; and,\nin this way, the theme of the third kind to be treated of in the\nfollowing chapter will be the unconditioned unity of the objective\nconditions of the possibility of objects in general.\nBut it is worthy of remark that the transcendental paralogism produced\nin the mind only a one-third illusion, in regard to the idea of the\nsubject of our thought; and the conceptions of reason gave no ground to\nmaintain the contrary proposition. The advantage is completely on the\nside of Pneumatism; although this theory itself passes into naught, in\nthe crucible of pure reason.\nVery different is the case when we apply reason to the objective\nsynthesis of phenomena. Here, certainly, reason establishes, with much\nplausibility, its principle of unconditioned unity; but it very soon\nfalls into such contradictions that it is compelled, in relation to\ncosmology, to renounce its pretensions.\nFor here a new phenomenon of human reason meets us\u2014a perfectly natural\nantithetic, which does not require to be sought for by subtle\nsophistry, but into which reason of itself unavoidably falls. It is\nthereby preserved, to be sure, from the slumber of a fancied\nconviction\u2014which a merely one-sided illusion produces; but it is at the\nsame time compelled, either, on the one hand, to abandon itself to a\ndespairing scepticism, or, on the other, to assume a dogmatical\nconfidence and obstinate persistence in certain assertions, without\ngranting a fair hearing to the other side of the question. Either is\nthe death of a sound philosophy, although the former might perhaps\ndeserve the title of the euthanasia of pure reason.\nBefore entering this region of discord and confusion, which the\nconflict of the laws of pure reason (antinomy) produces, we shall\npresent the reader with some considerations, in explanation and\njustification of the method we intend to follow in our treatment of\nthis subject. I term all transcendental ideas, in so far as they relate\nto the absolute totality in the synthesis of phenomena, cosmical\nconceptions; partly on account of this unconditioned totality, on which\nthe conception of the world-whole is based\u2014a conception, which is\nitself an idea\u2014partly because they relate solely to the synthesis of\nphenomena\u2014the empirical synthesis; while, on the other hand, the\nabsolute totality in the synthesis of the conditions of all possible\nthings gives rise to an ideal of pure reason, which is quite distinct\nfrom the cosmical conception, although it stands in relation with it.\nHence, as the paralogisms of pure reason laid the foundation for a\ndialectical psychology, the antinomy of pure reason will present us\nwith the transcendental principles of a pretended pure (rational)\ncosmology\u2014not, however, to declare it valid and to appropriate it,\nbut\u2014as the very term of a conflict of reason sufficiently indicates, to\npresent it as an idea which cannot be reconciled with phenomena and\nexperience.\nSection I. System of Cosmological Ideas\nThat we may be able to enumerate with systematic precision these ideas\naccording to a principle, we must remark, in the first place, that it\nis from the understanding alone that pure and transcendental\nconceptions take their origin; that the reason does not properly give\nbirth to any conception, but only frees the conception of the\nunderstanding from the unavoidable limitation of a possible experience,\nand thus endeavours to raise it above the empirical, though it must\nstill be in connection with it. This happens from the fact that, for a\ngiven conditioned, reason demands absolute totality on the side of the\nconditions (to which the understanding submits all phenomena), and thus\nmakes of the category a transcendental idea. This it does that it may\nbe able to give absolute completeness to the empirical synthesis, by\ncontinuing it to the unconditioned (which is not to be found in\nexperience, but only in the idea). Reason requires this according to\nthe principle: If the conditioned is given the whole of the conditions,\nand consequently the absolutely unconditioned, is also given, whereby\nalone the former was possible. First, then, the transcendental ideas\nare properly nothing but categories elevated to the unconditioned; and\nthey may be arranged in a table according to the titles of the latter.\nBut, secondly, all the categories are not available for this purpose,\nbut only those in which the synthesis constitutes a series\u2014of\nconditions subordinated to, not co-ordinated with, each other. Absolute\ntotality is required of reason only in so far as concerns the ascending\nseries of the conditions of a conditioned; not, consequently, when the\nquestion relates to the descending series of consequences, or to the\naggregate of the co-ordinated conditions of these consequences. For, in\nrelation to a given conditioned, conditions are presupposed and\nconsidered to be given along with it. On the other hand, as the\nconsequences do not render possible their conditions, but rather\npresuppose them\u2014in the consideration of the procession of consequences\n(or in the descent from the given condition to the conditioned), we may\nbe quite unconcerned whether the series ceases or not; and their\ntotality is not a necessary demand of reason.\nThus we cogitate\u2014and necessarily\u2014a given time completely elapsed up to\na given moment, although that time is not determinable by us. But as\nregards time future, which is not the condition of arriving at the\npresent, in order to conceive it; it is quite indifferent whether we\nconsider future time as ceasing at some point, or as prolonging itself\nto infinity. Take, for example, the series m, n, o, in which n is given\nas conditioned in relation to m, but at the same time as the condition\nof o, and let the series proceed upwards from the conditioned n to m\n(l, k, i, etc.), and also downwards from the condition n to the\nconditioned o (p, q, r, etc.)\u2014I must presuppose the former series, to\nbe able to consider n as given, and n is according to reason (the\ntotality of conditions) possible only by means of that series. But its\npossibility does not rest on the following series o, p, q, r, which for\nthis reason cannot be regarded as given, but only as capable of being\ngiven (dabilis).\nI shall term the synthesis of the series on the side of the\nconditions\u2014from that nearest to the given phenomenon up to the more\nremote\u2014regressive; that which proceeds on the side of the conditioned,\nfrom the immediate consequence to the more remote, I shall call the\nprogressive synthesis. The former proceeds in antecedentia, the latter\nin consequentia. The cosmological ideas are therefore occupied with the\ntotality of the regressive synthesis, and proceed in antecedentia, not\nin consequentia. When the latter takes place, it is an arbitrary and\nnot a necessary problem of pure reason; for we require, for the\ncomplete understanding of what is given in a phenomenon, not the\nconsequences which succeed, but the grounds or principles which\nprecede.\nIn order to construct the table of ideas in correspondence with the\ntable of categories, we take first the two primitive quanta of all our\nintuitions, time and space. Time is in itself a series (and the formal\ncondition of all series), and hence, in relation to a given present, we\nmust distinguish \u00e0 priori in it the antecedentia as conditions (time\npast) from the consequentia (time future). Consequently, the\ntranscendental idea of the absolute totality of the series of the\nconditions of a given conditioned, relates merely to all past time.\nAccording to the idea of reason, the whole past time, as the condition\nof the given moment, is necessarily cogitated as given. But, as regards\nspace, there exists in it no distinction between progressus and\nregressus; for it is an aggregate and not a series\u2014its parts existing\ntogether at the same time. I can consider a given point of time in\nrelation to past time only as conditioned, because this given moment\ncomes into existence only through the past time rather through the\npassing of the preceding time. But as the parts of space are not\nsubordinated, but co-ordinated to each other, one part cannot be the\ncondition of the possibility of the other; and space is not in itself,\nlike time, a series. But the synthesis of the manifold parts of\nspace\u2014(the syntheses whereby we apprehend space)\u2014is nevertheless\nsuccessive; it takes place, therefore, in time, and contains a series.\nAnd as in this series of aggregated spaces (for example, the feet in a\nrood), beginning with a given portion of space, those which continue to\nbe annexed form the condition of the limits of the former\u2014the\nmeasurement of a space must also be regarded as a synthesis of the\nseries of the conditions of a given conditioned. It differs, however,\nin this respect from that of time, that the side of the conditioned is\nnot in itself distinguishable from the side of the condition; and,\nconsequently, regressus and progressus in space seem to be identical.\nBut, inasmuch as one part of space is not given, but only limited, by\nand through another, we must also consider every limited space as\nconditioned, in so far as it presupposes some other space as the\ncondition of its limitation, and so on. As regards limitation,\ntherefore, our procedure in space is also a regressus, and the\ntranscendental idea of the absolute totality of the synthesis in a\nseries of conditions applies to space also; and I am entitled to demand\nthe absolute totality of the phenomenal synthesis in space as well as\nin time. Whether my demand can be satisfied is a question to be\nanswered in the sequel.\nSecondly, the real in space\u2014that is, matter\u2014is conditioned. Its\ninternal conditions are its parts, and the parts of parts its remote\nconditions; so that in this case we find a regressive synthesis, the\nabsolute totality of which is a demand of reason. But this cannot be\nobtained otherwise than by a complete division of parts, whereby the\nreal in matter becomes either nothing or that which is not matter, that\nis to say, the simple. Consequently we find here also a series of\nconditions and a progress to the unconditioned.\nThirdly, as regards the categories of a real relation between\nphenomena, the category of substance and its accidents is not suitable\nfor the formation of a transcendental idea; that is to say, reason has\nno ground, in regard to it, to proceed regressively with conditions.\nFor accidents (in so far as they inhere in a substance) are\nco-ordinated with each other, and do not constitute a series. And, in\nrelation to substance, they are not properly subordinated to it, but\nare the mode of existence of the substance itself. The conception of\nthe substantial might nevertheless seem to be an idea of the\ntranscendental reason. But, as this signifies nothing more than the\nconception of an object in general, which subsists in so far as we\ncogitate in it merely a transcendental subject without any predicates;\nand as the question here is of an unconditioned in the series of\nphenomena\u2014it is clear that the substantial can form no member thereof.\nThe same holds good of substances in community, which are mere\naggregates and do not form a series. For they are not subordinated to\neach other as conditions of the possibility of each other; which,\nhowever, may be affirmed of spaces, the limits of which are never\ndetermined in themselves, but always by some other space. It is,\ntherefore, only in the category of causality that we can find a series\nof causes to a given effect, and in which we ascend from the latter, as\nthe conditioned, to the former as the conditions, and thus answer the\nquestion of reason.\nFourthly, the conceptions of the possible, the actual, and the\nnecessary do not conduct us to any series\u2014excepting only in so far as\nthe contingent in existence must always be regarded as conditioned, and\nas indicating, according to a law of the understanding, a condition,\nunder which it is necessary to rise to a higher, till in the totality\nof the series, reason arrives at unconditioned necessity.\nThere are, accordingly, only four cosmological ideas, corresponding\nwith the four titles of the categories. For we can select only such as\nnecessarily furnish us with a series in the synthesis of the manifold.\n1\nThe absolute Completeness\nof the\nCOMPOSITION\nof the given totality of all phenomena.\n2\nThe absolute Completeness\nof the\nDIVISION\nof given totality in a phenomenon.\n3\nThe absolute Completeness\nof the\nORIGINATION\nof a phenomenon.\n4\nThe absolute Completeness\nof the DEPENDENCE of the EXISTENCE\nof what is changeable in a phenomenon.\nWe must here remark, in the first place, that the idea of absolute\ntotality relates to nothing but the exposition of phenomena, and\ntherefore not to the pure conception of a totality of things. Phenomena\nare here, therefore, regarded as given, and reason requires the\nabsolute completeness of the conditions of their possibility, in so far\nas these conditions constitute a series\u2014consequently an absolutely\n(that is, in every respect) complete synthesis, whereby a phenomenon\ncan be explained according to the laws of the understanding.\nSecondly, it is properly the unconditioned alone that reason seeks in\nthis serially and regressively conducted synthesis of conditions. It\nwishes, to speak in another way, to attain to completeness in the\nseries of premisses, so as to render it unnecessary to presuppose\nothers. This unconditioned is always contained in the absolute totality\nof the series, when we endeavour to form a representation of it in\nthought. But this absolutely complete synthesis is itself but an idea;\nfor it is impossible, at least before hand, to know whether any such\nsynthesis is possible in the case of phenomena. When we represent all\nexistence in thought by means of pure conceptions of the understanding,\nwithout any conditions of sensuous intuition, we may say with justice\nthat for a given conditioned the whole series of conditions\nsubordinated to each other is also given; for the former is only given\nthrough the latter. But we find in the case of phenomena a particular\nlimitation of the mode in which conditions are given, that is, through\nthe successive synthesis of the manifold of intuition, which must be\ncomplete in the regress. Now whether this completeness is sensuously\npossible, is a problem. But the idea of it lies in the reason\u2014be it\npossible or impossible to connect with the idea adequate empirical\nconceptions. Therefore, as in the absolute totality of the regressive\nsynthesis of the manifold in a phenomenon (following the guidance of\nthe categories, which represent it as a series of conditions to a given\nconditioned) the unconditioned is necessarily contained\u2014it being still\nleft unascertained whether and how this totality exists; reason sets\nout from the idea of totality, although its proper and final aim is the\nunconditioned\u2014of the whole series, or of a part thereof.\nThis unconditioned may be cogitated\u2014either as existing only in the\nentire series, all the members of which therefore would be without\nexception conditioned and only the totality absolutely\nunconditioned\u2014and in this case the regressus is called infinite; or the\nabsolutely unconditioned is only a part of the series, to which the\nother members are subordinated, but which Is not itself submitted to\nany other condition.[48] In the former case the series is a parte\npriori unlimited (without beginning), that is, infinite, and\nnevertheless completely given. But the regress in it is never\ncompleted, and can only be called potentially infinite. In the second\ncase there exists a first in the series. This first is called, in\nrelation to past time, the beginning of the world; in relation to\nspace, the limit of the world; in relation to the parts of a given\nlimited whole, the simple; in relation to causes, absolute spontaneity\n(liberty); and in relation to the existence of changeable things,\nabsolute physical necessity.\n[48] The absolute totality of the series of conditions to a given\nconditioned is always unconditioned; because beyond it there exist no\nother conditions, on which it might depend. But the absolute totality\nof such a series is only an idea, or rather a problematical\nconception, the possibility of which must be investigated\u2014particularly\nin relation to the mode in which the unconditioned, as the\ntranscendental idea which is the real subject of inquiry, may be\ncontained therein.\nWe possess two expressions, world and nature, which are generally\ninterchanged. The first denotes the mathematical total of all phenomena\nand the totality of their synthesis\u2014in its progress by means of\ncomposition, as well as by division. And the world is termed\nnature,[49] when it is regarded as a dynamical whole\u2014when our attention\nis not directed to the aggregation in space and time, for the purpose\nof cogitating it as a quantity, but to the unity in the existence of\nphenomena. In this case the condition of that which happens is called a\ncause; the unconditioned causality of the cause in a phenomenon is\ntermed liberty; the conditioned cause is called in a more limited sense\na natural cause. The conditioned in existence is termed contingent, and\nthe unconditioned necessary. The unconditioned necessity of phenomena\nmay be called natural necessity.\n[49] Nature, understood adjective (formaliter), signifies the complex\nof the determinations of a thing, connected according to an internal\nprinciple of causality. On the other hand, we understand by nature,\nsubstantive (materialiter), the sum total of phenomena, in so far as\nthey, by virtue of an internal principle of causality, are connected\nwith each other throughout. In the former sense we speak of the nature\nof liquid matter, of fire, etc., and employ the word only adjective;\nwhile, if speaking of the objects of nature, we have in our minds the\nidea of a subsisting whole.\nThe ideas which we are at present engaged in discussing I have called\ncosmological ideas; partly because by the term world is understood the\nentire content of all phenomena, and our ideas are directed solely to\nthe unconditioned among phenomena; partly also, because world, in the\ntranscendental sense, signifies the absolute totality of the content of\nexisting things, and we are directing our attention only to the\ncompleteness of the synthesis\u2014although, properly, only in regression.\nIn regard to the fact that these ideas are all transcendent, and,\nalthough they do not transcend phenomena as regards their mode, but are\nconcerned solely with the world of sense (and not with noumena),\nnevertheless carry their synthesis to a degree far above all possible\nexperience\u2014it still seems to me that we can, with perfect propriety,\ndesignate them cosmical conceptions. As regards the distinction between\nthe mathematically and the dynamically unconditioned which is the aim\nof the regression of the synthesis, I should call the two former, in a\nmore limited signification, cosmical conceptions, the remaining two\ntranscendent physical conceptions. This distinction does not at present\nseem to be of particular importance, but we shall afterwards find it to\nbe of some value.\nSection II. Antithetic of Pure Reason\nThetic is the term applied to every collection of dogmatical\npropositions. By antithetic I do not understand dogmatical assertions\nof the opposite, but the self-contradiction of seemingly dogmatical\ncognitions (thesis cum antithesis), in none of which we can discover\nany decided superiority. Antithetic is not, therefore, occupied with\none-sided statements, but is engaged in considering the contradictory\nnature of the general cognitions of reason and its causes.\nTranscendental antithetic is an investigation into the antinomy of pure\nreason, its causes and result. If we employ our reason not merely in\nthe application of the principles of the understanding to objects of\nexperience, but venture with it beyond these boundaries, there arise\ncertain sophistical propositions or theorems. These assertions have the\nfollowing peculiarities: They can find neither confirmation nor\nconfutation in experience; and each is in itself not only\nself-consistent, but possesses conditions of its necessity in the very\nnature of reason\u2014only that, unluckily, there exist just as valid and\nnecessary grounds for maintaining the contrary proposition.\nThe questions which naturally arise in the consideration of this\ndialectic of pure reason, are therefore: 1st. In what propositions is\npure reason unavoidably subject to an antinomy? 2nd. What are the\ncauses of this antinomy? 3rd. Whether and in what way can reason free\nitself from this self-contradiction?\nA dialectical proposition or theorem of pure reason must, according to\nwhat has been said, be distinguishable from all sophistical\npropositions, by the fact that it is not an answer to an arbitrary\nquestion, which may be raised at the mere pleasure of any person, but\nto one which human reason must necessarily encounter in its progress.\nIn the second place, a dialectical proposition, with its opposite, does\nnot carry the appearance of a merely artificial illusion, which\ndisappears as soon as it is investigated, but a natural and unavoidable\nillusion, which, even when we are no longer deceived by it, continues\nto mock us and, although rendered harmless, can never be completely\nremoved.\nThis dialectical doctrine will not relate to the unity of understanding\nin empirical conceptions, but to the unity of reason in pure ideas. The\nconditions of this doctrine are\u2014inasmuch as it must, as a synthesis\naccording to rules, be conformable to the understanding, and at the\nsame time as the absolute unity of the synthesis, to the reason\u2014that,\nif it is adequate to the unity of reason, it is too great for the\nunderstanding, if according with the understanding, it is too small for\nthe reason. Hence arises a mutual opposition, which cannot be avoided,\ndo what we will.\nThese sophistical assertions of dialectic open, as it were, a\nbattle-field, where that side obtains the victory which has been\npermitted to make the attack, and he is compelled to yield who has been\nunfortunately obliged to stand on the defensive. And hence, champions\nof ability, whether on the right or on the wrong side, are certain to\ncarry away the crown of victory, if they only take care to have the\nright to make the last attack, and are not obliged to sustain another\nonset from their opponent. We can easily believe that this arena has\nbeen often trampled by the feet of combatants, that many victories have\nbeen obtained on both sides, but that the last victory, decisive of the\naffair between the contending parties, was won by him who fought for\nthe right, only if his adversary was forbidden to continue the tourney.\nAs impartial umpires, we must lay aside entirely the consideration\nwhether the combatants are fighting for the right or for the wrong\nside, for the true or for the false, and allow the combat to be first\ndecided. Perhaps, after they have wearied more than injured each other,\nthey will discover the nothingness of their cause of quarrel and part\ngood friends.\nThis method of watching, or rather of originating, a conflict of\nassertions, not for the purpose of finally deciding in favour of either\nside, but to discover whether the object of the struggle is not a mere\nillusion, which each strives in vain to reach, but which would be no\ngain even when reached\u2014this procedure, I say, may be termed the\nsceptical method. It is thoroughly distinct from scepticism\u2014the\nprinciple of a technical and scientific ignorance, which undermines the\nfoundations of all knowledge, in order, if possible, to destroy our\nbelief and confidence therein. For the sceptical method aims at\ncertainty, by endeavouring to discover in a conflict of this kind,\nconducted honestly and intelligently on both sides, the point of\nmisunderstanding; just as wise legislators derive, from the\nembarrassment of judges in lawsuits, information in regard to the\ndefective and ill-defined parts of their statutes. The antinomy which\nreveals itself in the application of laws, is for our limited wisdom\nthe best criterion of legislation. For the attention of reason, which\nin abstract speculation does not easily become conscious of its errors,\nis thus roused to the momenta in the determination of its principles.\nBut this sceptical method is essentially peculiar to transcendental\nphilosophy, and can perhaps be dispensed with in every other field of\ninvestigation. In mathematics its use would be absurd; because in it no\nfalse assertions can long remain hidden, inasmuch as its demonstrations\nmust always proceed under the guidance of pure intuition, and by means\nof an always evident synthesis. In experimental philosophy, doubt and\ndelay may be very useful; but no misunderstanding is possible, which\ncannot be easily removed; and in experience means of solving the\ndifficulty and putting an end to the dissension must at last be found,\nwhether sooner or later. Moral philosophy can always exhibit its\nprinciples, with their practical consequences, in concreto\u2014at least in\npossible experiences, and thus escape the mistakes and ambiguities of\nabstraction. But transcendental propositions, which lay claim to\ninsight beyond the region of possible experience, cannot, on the one\nhand, exhibit their abstract synthesis in any \u00e0 priori intuition, nor,\non the other, expose a lurking error by the help of experience.\nTranscendental reason, therefore, presents us with no other criterion\nthan that of an attempt to reconcile such assertions, and for this\npurpose to permit a free and unrestrained conflict between them. And\nthis we now proceed to arrange.[50]\n[50] The antinomies stand in the order of the four transcendental\nideas above detailed.\nFIRST CONFLICT OF THE TRANSCENDENTAL IDEAS. THESIS.\nThe world has a beginning in time, and is also limited in regard to\nspace.\nPROOF.\nGranted that the world has no beginning in time; up to every given\nmoment of time, an eternity must have elapsed, and therewith passed\naway an infinite series of successive conditions or states of things in\nthe world. Now the infinity of a series consists in the fact that it\nnever can be completed by means of a successive synthesis. It follows\nthat an infinite series already elapsed is impossible and that,\nconsequently, a beginning of the world is a necessary condition of its\nexistence. And this was the first thing to be proved.\nAs regards the second, let us take the opposite for granted. In this\ncase, the world must be an infinite given total of coexistent things.\nNow we cannot cogitate the dimensions of a quantity, which is not given\nwithin certain limits of an intuition,[51] in any other way than by\nmeans of the synthesis of its parts, and the total of such a quantity\nonly by means of a completed synthesis, or the repeated addition of\nunity to itself. Accordingly, to cogitate the world, which fills all\nspaces, as a whole, the successive synthesis of the parts of an\ninfinite world must be looked upon as completed, that is to say, an\ninfinite time must be regarded as having elapsed in the enumeration of\nall co-existing things; which is impossible. For this reason an\ninfinite aggregate of actual things cannot be considered as a given\nwhole, consequently, not as a contemporaneously given whole. The world\nis consequently, as regards extension in space, not infinite, but\nenclosed in limits. And this was the second thing to be proved.\n[51] We may consider an undetermined quantity as a whole, when it is\nenclosed within limits, although we cannot construct or ascertain its\ntotality by measurement, that is, by the successive synthesis of its\nparts. For its limits of themselves determine its completeness as a\nwhole.\nANTITHESIS.\nThe world has no beginning, and no limits in space, but is, in relation\nboth to time and space, infinite.\nPROOF.\nFor let it be granted that it has a beginning. A beginning is an\nexistence which is preceded by a time in which the thing does not\nexist. On the above supposition, it follows that there must have been a\ntime in which the world did not exist, that is, a void time. But in a\nvoid time the origination of a thing is impossible; because no part of\nany such time contains a distinctive condition of being, in preference\nto that of non-being (whether the supposed thing originate of itself,\nor by means of some other cause). Consequently, many series of things\nmay have a beginning in the world, but the world itself cannot have a\nbeginning, and is, therefore, in relation to past time, infinite.\nAs regards the second statement, let us first take the opposite for\ngranted\u2014that the world is finite and limited in space; it follows that\nit must exist in a void space, which is not limited. We should\ntherefore meet not only with a relation of things in space, but also a\nrelation of things to space. Now, as the world is an absolute whole,\nout of and beyond which no object of intuition, and consequently no\ncorrelate to which can be discovered, this relation of the world to a\nvoid space is merely a relation to no object. But such a relation, and\nconsequently the limitation of the world by void space, is nothing.\nConsequently, the world, as regards space, is not limited, that is, it\nis infinite in regard to extension.[52]\n[52] Space is merely the form of external intuition (formal\nintuition), and not a real object which can be externally perceived.\nSpace, prior to all things which determine it (fill or limit it), or,\nrather, which present an empirical intuition conformable to it, is,\nunder the title of absolute space, nothing but the mere possibility of\nexternal phenomena, in so far as they either exist in themselves, or\ncan annex themselves to given intuitions. Empirical intuition is\ntherefore not a composition of phenomena and space (of perception and\nempty intuition). The one is not the correlate of the other in a\nsynthesis, but they are vitally connected in the same empirical\nintuition, as matter and form. If we wish to set one of these two\napart from the other\u2014space from phenomena\u2014there arise all sorts of\nempty determinations of external intuition, which are very far from\nbeing possible perceptions. For example, motion or rest of the world\nin an infinite empty space, or a determination of the mutual relation\nof both, cannot possibly be perceived, and is therefore merely the\npredicate of a notional entity.\nOBSERVATIONS ON THE FIRST ANTINOMY. ON THE THESIS.\nIn bringing forward these conflicting arguments, I have not been on the\nsearch for sophisms, for the purpose of availing myself of special\npleading, which takes advantage of the carelessness of the opposite\nparty, appeals to a misunderstood statute, and erects its unrighteous\nclaims upon an unfair interpretation. Both proofs originate fairly from\nthe nature of the case, and the advantage presented by the mistakes of\nthe dogmatists of both parties has been completely set aside.\nThe thesis might also have been unfairly demonstrated, by the\nintroduction of an erroneous conception of the infinity of a given\nquantity. A quantity is infinite, if a greater than itself cannot\npossibly exist. The quantity is measured by the number of given\nunits\u2014which are taken as a standard\u2014contained in it. Now no number can\nbe the greatest, because one or more units can always be added. It\nfollows that an infinite given quantity, consequently an infinite world\n(both as regards time and extension) is impossible. It is, therefore,\nlimited in both respects. In this manner I might have conducted my\nproof; but the conception given in it does not agree with the true\nconception of an infinite whole. In this there is no representation of\nits quantity, it is not said how large it is; consequently its\nconception is not the conception of a maximum. We cogitate in it merely\nits relation to an arbitrarily assumed unit, in relation to which it is\ngreater than any number. Now, just as the unit which is taken is\ngreater or smaller, the infinite will be greater or smaller; but the\ninfinity, which consists merely in the relation to this given unit,\nmust remain always the same, although the absolute quantity of the\nwhole is not thereby cognized.\nThe true (transcendental) conception of infinity is: that the\nsuccessive synthesis of unity in the measurement of a given quantum can\nnever be completed.[53] Hence it follows, without possibility of\nmistake, that an eternity of actual successive states up to a given\n(the present) moment cannot have elapsed, and that the world must\ntherefore have a beginning.\n[53] The quantum in this sense contains a congeries of given units,\nwhich is greater than any number\u2014and this is the mathematical\nconception of the infinite.\nIn regard to the second part of the thesis, the difficulty as to an\ninfinite and yet elapsed series disappears; for the manifold of a world\ninfinite in extension is contemporaneously given. But, in order to\ncogitate the total of this manifold, as we cannot have the aid of\nlimits constituting by themselves this total in intuition, we are\nobliged to give some account of our conception, which in this case\ncannot proceed from the whole to the determined quantity of the parts,\nbut must demonstrate the possibility of a whole by means of a\nsuccessive synthesis of the parts. But as this synthesis must\nconstitute a series that cannot be completed, it is impossible for us\nto cogitate prior to it, and consequently not by means of it, a\ntotality. For the conception of totality itself is in the present case\nthe representation of a completed synthesis of the parts; and this\ncompletion, and consequently its conception, is impossible.\nON THE ANTITHESIS.\nThe proof in favour of the infinity of the cosmical succession and the\ncosmical content is based upon the consideration that, in the opposite\ncase, a void time and a void space must constitute the limits of the\nworld. Now I am not unaware, that there are some ways of escaping this\nconclusion. It may, for example, be alleged, that a limit to the world,\nas regards both space and time, is quite possible, without at the same\ntime holding the existence of an absolute time before the beginning of\nthe world, or an absolute space extending beyond the actual world\u2014which\nis impossible. I am quite well satisfied with the latter part of this\nopinion of the philosophers of the Leibnitzian school. Space is merely\nthe form of external intuition, but not a real object which can itself\nbe externally intuited; it is not a correlate of phenomena, it is the\nform of phenomena itself. Space, therefore, cannot be regarded as\nabsolutely and in itself something determinative of the existence of\nthings, because it is not itself an object, but only the form of\npossible objects. Consequently, things, as phenomena, determine space;\nthat is to say, they render it possible that, of all the possible\npredicates of space (size and relation), certain may belong to reality.\nBut we cannot affirm the converse, that space, as something\nself-subsistent, can determine real things in regard to size or shape,\nfor it is in itself not a real thing. Space (filled or void)[54] may\ntherefore be limited by phenomena, but phenomena cannot be limited by\nan empty space without them. This is true of time also. All this being\ngranted, it is nevertheless indisputable, that we must assume these two\nnonentities, void space without and void time before the world, if we\nassume the existence of cosmical limits, relatively to space or time.\n[54] It is evident that what is meant here is, that empty space, in so\nfar as it is limited by phenomena\u2014space, that is, within the\nworld\u2014does not at least contradict transcendental principles, and may\ntherefore, as regards them, be admitted, although its possibility\ncannot on that account be affirmed.\nFor, as regards the subterfuge adopted by those who endeavour to evade\nthe consequence\u2014that, if the world is limited as to space and time, the\ninfinite void must determine the existence of actual things in regard\nto their dimensions\u2014it arises solely from the fact that instead of a\nsensuous world, an intelligible world\u2014of which nothing is known\u2014is\ncogitated; instead of a real beginning (an existence, which is preceded\nby a period in which nothing exists), an existence which presupposes no\nother condition than that of time; and, instead of limits of extension,\nboundaries of the universe. But the question relates to the mundus\nphaenomenon, and its quantity; and in this case we cannot make\nabstraction of the conditions of sensibility, without doing away with\nthe essential reality of this world itself. The world of sense, if it\nis limited, must necessarily lie in the infinite void. If this, and\nwith it space as the \u00e0 priori condition of the possibility of\nphenomena, is left out of view, the whole world of sense disappears. In\nour problem is this alone considered as given. The mundus\nintelligibilis is nothing but the general conception of a world, in\nwhich abstraction has been made of all conditions of intuition, and in\nrelation to which no synthetical proposition\u2014either affirmative or\nnegative\u2014is possible.\nSECOND CONFLICT OF TRANSCENDENTAL IDEAS. THESIS.\nEvery composite substance in the world consists of simple parts; and\nthere exists nothing that is not either itself simple, or composed of\nsimple parts.\nPROOF.\nFor, grant that composite substances do not consist of simple parts; in\nthis case, if all combination or composition were annihilated in\nthought, no composite part, and (as, by the supposition, there do not\nexist simple parts) no simple part would exist. Consequently, no\nsubstance; consequently, nothing would exist. Either, then, it is\nimpossible to annihilate composition in thought; or, after such\nannihilation, there must remain something that subsists without\ncomposition, that is, something that is simple. But in the former case\nthe composite could not itself consist of substances, because with\nsubstances composition is merely a contingent relation, apart from\nwhich they must still exist as self-subsistent beings. Now, as this\ncase contradicts the supposition, the second must contain the\ntruth\u2014that the substantial composite in the world consists of simple\nparts.\nIt follows, as an immediate inference, that the things in the world are\nall, without exception, simple beings\u2014that composition is merely an\nexternal condition pertaining to them\u2014and that, although we never can\nseparate and isolate the elementary substances from the state of\ncomposition, reason must cogitate these as the primary subjects of all\ncomposition, and consequently, as prior thereto\u2014and as simple\nsubstances.\nANTITHESIS.\nNo composite thing in the world consists of simple parts; and there\ndoes not exist in the world any simple substance.\nPROOF.\nLet it be supposed that a composite thing (as substance) consists of\nsimple parts. Inasmuch as all external relation, consequently all\ncomposition of substances, is possible only in space; the space,\noccupied by that which is composite, must consist of the same number of\nparts as is contained in the composite. But space does not consist of\nsimple parts, but of spaces. Therefore, every part of the composite\nmust occupy a space. But the absolutely primary parts of what is\ncomposite are simple. It follows that what is simple occupies a space.\nNow, as everything real that occupies a space, contains a manifold the\nparts of which are external to each other, and is consequently\ncomposite\u2014and a real composite, not of accidents (for these cannot\nexist external to each other apart from substance), but of\nsubstances\u2014it follows that the simple must be a substantial composite,\nwhich is self-contradictory.\nThe second proposition of the antithesis\u2014that there exists in the world\nnothing that is simple\u2014is here equivalent to the following: The\nexistence of the absolutely simple cannot be demonstrated from any\nexperience or perception either external or internal; and the\nabsolutely simple is a mere idea, the objective reality of which cannot\nbe demonstrated in any possible experience; it is consequently, in the\nexposition of phenomena, without application and object. For, let us\ntake for granted that an object may be found in experience for this\ntranscendental idea; the empirical intuition of such an object must\nthen be recognized to contain absolutely no manifold with its parts\nexternal to each other, and connected into unity. Now, as we cannot\nreason from the non-consciousness of such a manifold to the\nimpossibility of its existence in the intuition of an object, and as\nthe proof of this impossibility is necessary for the establishment and\nproof of absolute simplicity; it follows that this simplicity cannot be\ninferred from any perception whatever. As, therefore, an absolutely\nsimple object cannot be given in any experience, and the world of sense\nmust be considered as the sum total of all possible experiences:\nnothing simple exists in the world.\nThis second proposition in the antithesis has a more extended aim than\nthe first. The first merely banishes the simple from the intuition of\nthe composite; while the second drives it entirely out of nature. Hence\nwe were unable to demonstrate it from the conception of a given object\nof external intuition (of the composite), but we were obliged to prove\nit from the relation of a given object to a possible experience in\ngeneral.\nOBSERVATIONS ON THE SECOND ANTINOMY. THESIS.\nWhen I speak of a whole, which necessarily consists of simple parts, I\nunderstand thereby only a substantial whole, as the true composite;\nthat is to say, I understand that contingent unity of the manifold\nwhich is given as perfectly isolated (at least in thought), placed in\nreciprocal connection, and thus constituted a unity. Space ought not to\nbe called a compositum but a totum, for its parts are possible in the\nwhole, and not the whole by means of the parts. It might perhaps be\ncalled a compositum ideale, but not a compositum reale. But this is of\nno importance. As space is not a composite of substances (and not even\nof real accidents), if I abstract all composition therein\u2014nothing, not\neven a point, remains; for a point is possible only as the limit of a\nspace\u2014consequently of a composite. Space and time, therefore, do not\nconsist of simple parts. That which belongs only to the condition or\nstate of a substance, even although it possesses a quantity (motion or\nchange, for example), likewise does not consist of simple parts. That\nis to say, a certain degree of change does not originate from the\naddition of many simple changes. Our inference of the simple from the\ncomposite is valid only of self-subsisting things. But the accidents of\na state are not self-subsistent. The proof, then, for the necessity of\nthe simple, as the component part of all that is substantial and\ncomposite, may prove a failure, and the whole case of this thesis be\nlost, if we carry the proposition too far, and wish to make it valid of\neverything that is composite without distinction\u2014as indeed has really\nnow and then happened. Besides, I am here speaking only of the simple,\nin so far as it is necessarily given in the composite\u2014the latter being\ncapable of solution into the former as its component parts. The proper\nsignification of the word monas (as employed by Leibnitz) ought to\nrelate to the simple, given immediately as simple substance (for\nexample, in consciousness), and not as an element of the composite. As\nan element, the term atomus would be more appropriate. And as I wish to\nprove the existence of simple substances, only in relation to, and as\nthe elements of, the composite, I might term the antithesis of the\nsecond Antinomy, transcendental Atomistic. But as this word has long\nbeen employed to designate a particular theory of corporeal phenomena\n(moleculae), and thus presupposes a basis of empirical conceptions, I\nprefer calling it the dialectical principle of Monadology.\nANTITHESIS.\nAgainst the assertion of the infinite subdivisibility of matter whose\nground of proof is purely mathematical, objections have been alleged by\nthe Monadists. These objections lay themselves open, at first sight, to\nsuspicion, from the fact that they do not recognize the clearest\nmathematical proofs as propositions relating to the constitution of\nspace, in so far as it is really the formal condition of the\npossibility of all matter, but regard them merely as inferences from\nabstract but arbitrary conceptions, which cannot have any application\nto real things. Just as if it were possible to imagine another mode of\nintuition than that given in the primitive intuition of space; and just\nas if its \u00e0 priori determinations did not apply to everything, the\nexistence of which is possible, from the fact alone of its filling\nspace. If we listen to them, we shall find ourselves required to\ncogitate, in addition to the mathematical point, which is simple\u2014not,\nhowever, a part, but a mere limit of space\u2014physical points, which are\nindeed likewise simple, but possess the peculiar property, as parts of\nspace, of filling it merely by their aggregation. I shall not repeat\nhere the common and clear refutations of this absurdity, which are to\nbe found everywhere in numbers: every one knows that it is impossible\nto undermine the evidence of mathematics by mere discursive\nconceptions; I shall only remark that, if in this case philosophy\nendeavours to gain an advantage over mathematics by sophistical\nartifices, it is because it forgets that the discussion relates solely\nto Phenomena and their conditions. It is not sufficient to find the\nconception of the simple for the pure conception of the composite, but\nwe must discover for the intuition of the composite (matter), the\nintuition of the simple. Now this, according to the laws of\nsensibility, and consequently in the case of objects of sense, is\nutterly impossible. In the case of a whole composed of substances,\nwhich is cogitated solely by the pure understanding, it may be\nnecessary to be in possession of the simple before composition is\npossible. But this does not hold good of the Totum substantiale\nphaenomenon, which, as an empirical intuition in space, possesses the\nnecessary property of containing no simple part, for the very reason\nthat no part of space is simple. Meanwhile, the Monadists have been\nsubtle enough to escape from this difficulty, by presupposing intuition\nand the dynamical relation of substances as the condition of the\npossibility of space, instead of regarding space as the condition of\nthe possibility of the objects of external intuition, that is, of\nbodies. Now we have a conception of bodies only as phenomena, and, as\nsuch, they necessarily presuppose space as the condition of all\nexternal phenomena. The evasion is therefore in vain; as, indeed, we\nhave sufficiently shown in our \u00c6sthetic. If bodies were things in\nthemselves, the proof of the Monadists would be unexceptionable.\nThe second dialectical assertion possesses the peculiarity of having\nopposed to it a dogmatical proposition, which, among all such\nsophistical statements, is the only one that undertakes to prove in the\ncase of an object of experience, that which is properly a\ntranscendental idea\u2014the absolute simplicity of substance. The\nproposition is that the object of the internal sense, the thinking Ego,\nis an absolute simple substance. Without at present entering upon this\nsubject\u2014as it has been considered at length in a former chapter\u2014I shall\nmerely remark that, if something is cogitated merely as an object,\nwithout the addition of any synthetical determination of its\nintuition\u2014as happens in the case of the bare representation, _I_\u2014it is\ncertain that no manifold and no composition can be perceived in such a\nrepresentation. As, moreover, the predicates whereby I cogitate this\nobject are merely intuitions of the internal sense, there cannot be\ndiscovered in them anything to prove the existence of a manifold whose\nparts are external to each other, and, consequently, nothing to prove\nthe existence of real composition. Consciousness, therefore, is so\nconstituted that, inasmuch as the thinking subject is at the same time\nits own object, it cannot divide itself\u2014although it can divide its\ninhering determinations. For every object in relation to itself is\nabsolute unity. Nevertheless, if the subject is regarded externally, as\nan object of intuition, it must, in its character of phenomenon,\npossess the property of composition. And it must always be regarded in\nthis manner, if we wish to know whether there is or is not contained in\nit a manifold whose parts are external to each other.\nTHIRD CONFLICT OF THE TRANSCENDENTAL IDEAS. THESIS.\nCausality according to the laws of nature, is not the only causality\noperating to originate the phenomena of the world. A causality of\nfreedom is also necessary to account fully for these phenomena.\nPROOF.\nLet it be supposed, that there is no other kind of causality than that\naccording to the laws of nature. Consequently, everything that happens\npresupposes a previous condition, which it follows with absolute\ncertainty, in conformity with a rule. But this previous condition must\nitself be something that has happened (that has arisen in time, as it\ndid not exist before), for, if it has always been in existence, its\nconsequence or effect would not thus originate for the first time, but\nwould likewise have always existed. The causality, therefore, of a\ncause, whereby something happens, is itself a thing that has happened.\nNow this again presupposes, in conformity with the law of nature, a\nprevious condition and its causality, and this another anterior to the\nformer, and so on. If, then, everything happens solely in accordance\nwith the laws of nature, there cannot be any real first beginning of\nthings, but only a subaltern or comparative beginning. There cannot,\ntherefore, be a completeness of series on the side of the causes which\noriginate the one from the other. But the law of nature is that nothing\ncan happen without a sufficient \u00e0 priori determined cause. The\nproposition therefore\u2014if all causality is possible only in accordance\nwith the laws of nature\u2014is, when stated in this unlimited and general\nmanner, self-contradictory. It follows that this cannot be the only\nkind of causality.\nFrom what has been said, it follows that a causality must be admitted,\nby means of which something happens, without its cause being determined\naccording to necessary laws by some other cause preceding. That is to\nsay, there must exist an absolute spontaneity of cause, which of itself\noriginates a series of phenomena which proceeds according to natural\nlaws\u2014consequently transcendental freedom, without which even in the\ncourse of nature the succession of phenomena on the side of causes is\nnever complete.\nANTITHESIS.\nThere is no such thing as freedom, but everything in the world happens\nsolely according to the laws of nature.\nPROOF.\nGranted, that there does exist freedom in the transcendental sense, as\na peculiar kind of causality, operating to produce events in the\nworld\u2014a faculty, that is to say, of originating a state, and\nconsequently a series of consequences from that state. In this case,\nnot only the series originated by this spontaneity, but the\ndetermination of this spontaneity itself to the production of the\nseries, that is to say, the causality itself must have an absolute\ncommencement, such that nothing can precede to determine this action\naccording to unvarying laws. But every beginning of action presupposes\nin the acting cause a state of inaction; and a dynamically primal\nbeginning of action presupposes a state, which has no connection\u2014as\nregards causality\u2014with the preceding state of the cause\u2014which does not,\nthat is, in any wise result from it. Transcendental freedom is\ntherefore opposed to the natural law of cause and effect, and such a\nconjunction of successive states in effective causes is destructive of\nthe possibility of unity in experience and for that reason not to be\nfound in experience\u2014is consequently a mere fiction of thought.\nWe have, therefore, nothing but nature to which we must look for\nconnection and order in cosmical events. Freedom\u2014independence of the\nlaws of nature\u2014is certainly a deliverance from restraint, but it is\nalso a relinquishing of the guidance of law and rule. For it cannot be\nalleged that, instead of the laws of nature, laws of freedom may be\nintroduced into the causality of the course of nature. For, if freedom\nwere determined according to laws, it would be no longer freedom, but\nmerely nature. Nature, therefore, and transcendental freedom are\ndistinguishable as conformity to law and lawlessness. The former\nimposes upon understanding the difficulty of seeking the origin of\nevents ever higher and higher in the series of causes, inasmuch as\ncausality is always conditioned thereby; while it compensates this\nlabour by the guarantee of a unity complete and in conformity with law.\nThe latter, on the contrary, holds out to the understanding the promise\nof a point of rest in the chain of causes, by conducting it to an\nunconditioned causality, which professes to have the power of\nspontaneous origination, but which, in its own utter blindness,\ndeprives it of the guidance of rules, by which alone a completely\nconnected experience is possible.\nOBSERVATIONS ON THE THIRD ANTINOMY. ON THE THESIS.\nThe transcendental idea of freedom is far from constituting the entire\ncontent of the psychological conception so termed, which is for the\nmost part empirical. It merely presents us with the conception of\nspontaneity of action, as the proper ground for imputing freedom to the\ncause of a certain class of objects. It is, however, the true\nstumbling-stone to philosophy, which meets with unconquerable\ndifficulties in the way of its admitting this kind of unconditioned\ncausality. That element in the question of the freedom of the will,\nwhich has for so long a time placed speculative reason in such\nperplexity, is properly only transcendental, and concerns the question,\nwhether there must be held to exist a faculty of spontaneous\norigination of a series of successive things or states. How such a\nfaculty is possible is not a necessary inquiry; for in the case of\nnatural causality itself, we are obliged to content ourselves with the\n\u00e0 priori knowledge that such a causality must be presupposed, although\nwe are quite incapable of comprehending how the being of one thing is\npossible through the being of another, but must for this information\nlook entirely to experience. Now we have demonstrated this necessity of\na free first beginning of a series of phenomena, only in so far as it\nis required for the comprehension of an origin of the world, all\nfollowing states being regarded as a succession according to laws of\nnature alone. But, as there has thus been proved the existence of a\nfaculty which can of itself originate a series in time\u2014although we are\nunable to explain how it can exist\u2014we feel ourselves authorized to\nadmit, even in the midst of the natural course of events, a beginning,\nas regards causality, of different successions of phenomena, and at the\nsame time to attribute to all substances a faculty of free action. But\nwe ought in this case not to allow ourselves to fall into a common\nmisunderstanding, and to suppose that, because a successive series in\nthe world can only have a comparatively first beginning\u2014another state\nor condition of things always preceding\u2014an absolutely first beginning\nof a series in the course of nature is impossible. For we are not\nspeaking here of an absolutely first beginning in relation to time, but\nas regards causality alone. When, for example, I, completely of my own\nfree will, and independently of the necessarily determinative influence\nof natural causes, rise from my chair, there commences with this event,\nincluding its material consequences in infinitum, an absolutely new\nseries; although, in relation to time, this event is merely the\ncontinuation of a preceding series. For this resolution and act of mine\ndo not form part of the succession of effects in nature, and are not\nmere continuations of it; on the contrary, the determining causes of\nnature cease to operate in reference to this event, which certainly\nsucceeds the acts of nature, but does not proceed from them. For these\nreasons, the action of a free agent must be termed, in regard to\ncausality, if not in relation to time, an absolutely primal beginning\nof a series of phenomena.\nThe justification of this need of reason to rest upon a free act as the\nfirst beginning of the series of natural causes is evident from the\nfact, that all philosophers of antiquity (with the exception of the\nEpicurean school) felt themselves obliged, when constructing a theory\nof the motions of the universe, to accept a prime mover, that is, a\nfreely acting cause, which spontaneously and prior to all other causes\nevolved this series of states. They always felt the need of going\nbeyond mere nature, for the purpose of making a first beginning\ncomprehensible.\nON THE ANTITHESIS.\nThe assertor of the all-sufficiency of nature in regard to causality\n(transcendental Physiocracy), in opposition to the doctrine of freedom,\nwould defend his view of the question somewhat in the following manner.\nHe would say, in answer to the sophistical arguments of the opposite\nparty: If you do not accept a mathematical first, in relation to time,\nyou have no need to seek a dynamical first, in regard to causality. Who\ncompelled you to imagine an absolutely primal condition of the world,\nand therewith an absolute beginning of the gradually progressing\nsuccessions of phenomena\u2014and, as some foundation for this fancy of\nyours, to set bounds to unlimited nature? Inasmuch as the substances in\nthe world have always existed\u2014at least the unity of experience renders\nsuch a supposition quite necessary\u2014there is no difficulty in believing\nalso, that the changes in the conditions of these substances have\nalways existed; and, consequently, that a first beginning, mathematical\nor dynamical, is by no means required. The possibility of such an\ninfinite derivation, without any initial member from which all the\nothers result, is certainly quite incomprehensible. But, if you are\nrash enough to deny the enigmatical secrets of nature for this reason,\nyou will find yourselves obliged to deny also the existence of many\nfundamental properties of natural objects (such as fundamental forces),\nwhich you can just as little comprehend; and even the possibility of so\nsimple a conception as that of change must present to you insuperable\ndifficulties. For if experience did not teach you that it was real, you\nnever could conceive \u00e0 priori the possibility of this ceaseless\nsequence of being and non-being.\nBut if the existence of a transcendental faculty of freedom is\ngranted\u2014a faculty of originating changes in the world\u2014this faculty must\nat least exist out of and apart from the world; although it is\ncertainly a bold assumption, that, over and above the complete content\nof all possible intuitions, there still exists an object which cannot\nbe presented in any possible perception. But, to attribute to\nsubstances in the world itself such a faculty, is quite inadmissible;\nfor, in this case; the connection of phenomena reciprocally determining\nand determined according to general laws, which is termed nature, and\nalong with it the criteria of empirical truth, which enable us to\ndistinguish experience from mere visionary dreaming, would almost\nentirely disappear. In proximity with such a lawless faculty of\nfreedom, a system of nature is hardly cogitable; for the laws of the\nlatter would be continually subject to the intrusive influences of the\nformer, and the course of phenomena, which would otherwise proceed\nregularly and uniformly, would become thereby confused and\ndisconnected.\nFOURTH CONFLICT OF THE TRANSCENDENTAL IDEAS. THESIS.\nThere exists either in, or in connection with the world\u2014either as a\npart of it, or as the cause of it\u2014an absolutely necessary being.\nPROOF.\nThe world of sense, as the sum total of all phenomena, contains a\nseries of changes. For, without such a series, the mental\nrepresentation of the series of time itself, as the condition of the\npossibility of the sensuous world, could not be presented to us.[55]\nBut every change stands under its condition, which precedes it in time\nand renders it necessary. Now the existence of a given condition\npresupposes a complete series of conditions up to the absolutely\nunconditioned, which alone is absolutely necessary. It follows that\nsomething that is absolutely necessary must exist, if change exists as\nits consequence. But this necessary thing itself belongs to the\nsensuous world. For suppose it to exist out of and apart from it, the\nseries of cosmical changes would receive from it a beginning, and yet\nthis necessary cause would not itself belong to the world of sense. But\nthis is impossible. For, as the beginning of a series in time is\ndetermined only by that which precedes it in time, the supreme\ncondition of the beginning of a series of changes must exist in the\ntime in which this series itself did not exist; for a beginning\nsupposes a time preceding, in which the thing that begins to be was not\nin existence. The causality of the necessary cause of changes, and\nconsequently the cause itself, must for these reasons belong to\ntime\u2014and to phenomena, time being possible only as the form of\nphenomena. Consequently, it cannot be cogitated as separated from the\nworld of sense\u2014the sum total of all phenomena. There is, therefore,\ncontained in the world, something that is absolutely necessary\u2014whether\nit be the whole cosmical series itself, or only a part of it.\n[55] Objectively, time, as the formal condition of the possibility of\nchange, precedes all changes; but subjectively, and in consciousness,\nthe representation of time, like every other, is given solely by\noccasion of perception.\nANTITHESIS.\nAn absolutely necessary being does not exist, either in the world, or\nout of it\u2014as its cause.\nPROOF.\nGrant that either the world itself is necessary, or that there is\ncontained in it a necessary existence. Two cases are possible. First,\nthere must either be in the series of cosmical changes a beginning,\nwhich is unconditionally necessary, and therefore uncaused\u2014which is at\nvariance with the dynamical law of the determination of all phenomena\nin time; or, secondly, the series itself is without beginning, and,\nalthough contingent and conditioned in all its parts, is nevertheless\nabsolutely necessary and unconditioned as a whole\u2014which is\nself-contradictory. For the existence of an aggregate cannot be\nnecessary, if no single part of it possesses necessary existence.\nGrant, on the other hand, that an absolutely necessary cause exists out\nof and apart from the world. This cause, as the highest member in the\nseries of the causes of cosmical changes, must originate or begin[56]\nthe existence of the latter and their series. In this case it must also\nbegin to act, and its causality would therefore belong to time, and\nconsequently to the sum total of phenomena, that is, to the world. It\nfollows that the cause cannot be out of the world; which is\ncontradictory to the hypothesis. Therefore, neither in the world, nor\nout of it (but in causal connection with it), does there exist any\nabsolutely necessary being.\n[56] The word begin is taken in two senses. The first is active\u2014the\ncause being regarded as beginning a series of conditions as its effect\n(infit). The second is passive\u2014the causality in the cause itself\nbeginning to operate (fit). I reason here from the first to the\nsecond.\nOBSERVATIONS ON THE FOURTH ANTINOMY. ON THE THESIS.\nTo demonstrate the existence of a necessary being, I cannot be\npermitted in this place to employ any other than the cosmological\nargument, which ascends from the conditioned in phenomena to the\nunconditioned in conception\u2014the unconditioned being considered the\nnecessary condition of the absolute totality of the series. The proof,\nfrom the mere idea of a supreme being, belongs to another principle of\nreason and requires separate discussion.\nThe pure cosmological proof demonstrates the existence of a necessary\nbeing, but at the same time leaves it quite unsettled, whether this\nbeing is the world itself, or quite distinct from it. To establish the\ntruth of the latter view, principles are requisite, which are not\ncosmological and do not proceed in the series of phenomena. We should\nrequire to introduce into our proof conceptions of contingent\nbeings\u2014regarded merely as objects of the understanding, and also a\nprinciple which enables us to connect these, by means of mere\nconceptions, with a necessary being. But the proper place for all such\narguments is a transcendent philosophy, which has unhappily not yet\nbeen established.\nBut, if we begin our proof cosmologically, by laying at the foundation\nof it the series of phenomena, and the regress in it according to\nempirical laws of causality, we are not at liberty to break off from\nthis mode of demonstration and to pass over to something which is not\nitself a member of the series. The condition must be taken in exactly\nthe same signification as the relation of the conditioned to its\ncondition in the series has been taken, for the series must conduct us\nin an unbroken regress to this supreme condition. But if this relation\nis sensuous, and belongs to the possible empirical employment of\nunderstanding, the supreme condition or cause must close the regressive\nseries according to the laws of sensibility and consequently, must\nbelong to the series of time. It follows that this necessary existence\nmust be regarded as the highest member of the cosmical series.\nCertain philosophers have, nevertheless, allowed themselves the liberty\nof making such a saltus (metabasis eis allo gonos). From the changes in\nthe world they have concluded their empirical contingency, that is,\ntheir dependence on empirically-determined causes, and they thus\nadmitted an ascending series of empirical conditions: and in this they\nare quite right. But as they could not find in this series any primal\nbeginning or any highest member, they passed suddenly from the\nempirical conception of contingency to the pure category, which\npresents us with a series\u2014not sensuous, but intellectual\u2014whose\ncompleteness does certainly rest upon the existence of an absolutely\nnecessary cause. Nay, more, this intellectual series is not tied to any\nsensuous conditions; and is therefore free from the condition of time,\nwhich requires it spontaneously to begin its causality in time. But\nsuch a procedure is perfectly inadmissible, as will be made plain from\nwhat follows.\nIn the pure sense of the categories, that is contingent the\ncontradictory opposite of which is possible. Now we cannot reason from\nempirical contingency to intellectual. The opposite of that which is\nchanged\u2014the opposite of its state\u2014is actual at another time, and is\ntherefore possible. Consequently, it is not the contradictory opposite\nof the former state. To be that, it is necessary that, in the same time\nin which the preceding state existed, its opposite could have existed\nin its place; but such a cognition is not given us in the mere\nphenomenon of change. A body that was in motion = A, comes into a state\nof rest = non-A. Now it cannot be concluded from the fact that a state\nopposite to the state A follows it, that the contradictory opposite of\nA is possible; and that A is therefore contingent. To prove this, we\nshould require to know that the state of rest could have existed in the\nvery same time in which the motion took place. Now we know nothing more\nthan that the state of rest was actual in the time that followed the\nstate of motion; consequently, that it was also possible. But motion at\none time, and rest at another time, are not contradictorily opposed to\neach other. It follows from what has been said that the succession of\nopposite determinations, that is, change, does not demonstrate the fact\nof contingency as represented in the conceptions of the pure\nunderstanding; and that it cannot, therefore, conduct us to the fact of\nthe existence of a necessary being. Change proves merely empirical\ncontingency, that is to say, that the new state could not have existed\nwithout a cause, which belongs to the preceding time. This cause\u2014even\nalthough it is regarded as absolutely necessary\u2014must be presented to us\nin time, and must belong to the series of phenomena.\nON THE ANTITHESIS.\nThe difficulties which meet us, in our attempt to rise through the\nseries of phenomena to the existence of an absolutely necessary supreme\ncause, must not originate from our inability to establish the truth of\nour mere conceptions of the necessary existence of a thing. That is to\nsay, our objections not be ontological, but must be directed against\nthe causal connection with a series of phenomena of a condition which\nis itself unconditioned. In one word, they must be cosmological and\nrelate to empirical laws. We must show that the regress in the series\nof causes (in the world of sense) cannot conclude with an empirically\nunconditioned condition, and that the cosmological argument from the\ncontingency of the cosmical state\u2014a contingency alleged to arise from\nchange\u2014does not justify us in accepting a first cause, that is, a prime\noriginator of the cosmical series.\nThe reader will observe in this antinomy a very remarkable contrast.\nThe very same grounds of proof which established in the thesis the\nexistence of a supreme being, demonstrated in the antithesis\u2014and with\nequal strictness\u2014the non-existence of such a being. We found, first,\nthat a necessary being exists, because the whole time past contains the\nseries of all conditions, and with it, therefore, the unconditioned\n(the necessary); secondly, that there does not exist any necessary\nbeing, for the same reason, that the whole time past contains the\nseries of all conditions\u2014which are themselves, therefore, in the\naggregate, conditioned. The cause of this seeming incongruity is as\nfollows. We attend, in the first argument, solely to the absolute\ntotality of the series of conditions, the one of which determines the\nother in time, and thus arrive at a necessary unconditioned. In the\nsecond, we consider, on the contrary, the contingency of everything\nthat is determined in the series of time\u2014for every event is preceded by\na time, in which the condition itself must be determined as\nconditioned\u2014and thus everything that is unconditioned or absolutely\nnecessary disappears. In both, the mode of proof is quite in accordance\nwith the common procedure of human reason, which often falls into\ndiscord with itself, from considering an object from two different\npoints of view. Herr von Mairan regarded the controversy between two\ncelebrated astronomers, which arose from a similar difficulty as to the\nchoice of a proper standpoint, as a phenomenon of sufficient importance\nto warrant a separate treatise on the subject. The one concluded: the\nmoon revolves on its own axis, because it constantly presents the same\nside to the earth; the other declared that the moon does not revolve on\nits own axis, for the same reason. Both conclusions were perfectly\ncorrect, according to the point of view from which the motions of the\nmoon were considered.\nSection III. Of the Interest of Reason in these Self-contradictions\nWe have thus completely before us the dialectical procedure of the\ncosmological ideas. No possible experience can present us with an\nobject adequate to them in extent. Nay, more, reason itself cannot\ncogitate them as according with the general laws of experience. And yet\nthey are not arbitrary fictions of thought. On the contrary, reason, in\nits uninterrupted progress in the empirical synthesis, is necessarily\nconducted to them, when it endeavours to free from all conditions and\nto comprehend in its unconditioned totality that which can only be\ndetermined conditionally in accordance with the laws of experience.\nThese dialectical propositions are so many attempts to solve four\nnatural and unavoidable problems of reason. There are neither more, nor\ncan there be less, than this number, because there are no other series\nof synthetical hypotheses, limiting \u00e0 priori the empirical synthesis.\nThe brilliant claims of reason striving to extend its dominion beyond\nthe limits of experience, have been represented above only in dry\nformulae, which contain merely the grounds of its pretensions. They\nhave, besides, in conformity with the character of a transcendental\nphilosophy, been freed from every empirical element; although the full\nsplendour of the promises they hold out, and the anticipations they\nexcite, manifests itself only when in connection with empirical\ncognitions. In the application of them, however, and in the advancing\nenlargement of the employment of reason, while struggling to rise from\nthe region of experience and to soar to those sublime ideas, philosophy\ndiscovers a value and a dignity, which, if it could but make good its\nassertions, would raise it far above all other departments of human\nknowledge\u2014professing, as it does, to present a sure foundation for our\nhighest hopes and the ultimate aims of all the exertions of reason. The\nquestions: whether the world has a beginning and a limit to its\nextension in space; whether there exists anywhere, or perhaps, in my\nown thinking Self, an indivisible and indestructible unity\u2014or whether\nnothing but what is divisible and transitory exists; whether I am a\nfree agent, or, like other beings, am bound in the chains of nature and\nfate; whether, finally, there is a supreme cause of the world, or all\nour thought and speculation must end with nature and the order of\nexternal things\u2014are questions for the solution of which the\nmathematician would willingly exchange his whole science; for in it\nthere is no satisfaction for the highest aspirations and most ardent\ndesires of humanity. Nay, it may even be said that the true value of\nmathematics\u2014that pride of human reason\u2014consists in this: that she\nguides reason to the knowledge of nature\u2014in her greater as well as in\nher less manifestations\u2014in her beautiful order and regularity\u2014guides\nher, moreover, to an insight into the wonderful unity of the moving\nforces in the operations of nature, far beyond the expectations of a\nphilosophy building only on experience; and that she thus encourages\nphilosophy to extend the province of reason beyond all experience, and\nat the same time provides it with the most excellent materials for\nsupporting its investigations, in so far as their nature admits, by\nadequate and accordant intuitions.\nUnfortunately for speculation\u2014but perhaps fortunately for the practical\ninterests of humanity\u2014reason, in the midst of her highest\nanticipations, finds herself hemmed in by a press of opposite and\ncontradictory conclusions, from which neither her honour nor her safety\nwill permit her to draw back. Nor can she regard these conflicting\ntrains of reasoning with indifference as mere passages at arms, still\nless can she command peace; for in the subject of the conflict she has\na deep interest. There is no other course left open to her than to\nreflect with herself upon the origin of this disunion in reason\u2014whether\nit may not arise from a mere misunderstanding. After such an inquiry,\narrogant claims would have to be given up on both sides; but the\nsovereignty of reason over understanding and sense would be based upon\na sure foundation.\nWe shall at present defer this radical inquiry and, in the meantime,\nconsider for a little what side in the controversy we should most\nwillingly take, if we were obliged to become partisans at all. As, in\nthis case, we leave out of sight altogether the logical criterion of\ntruth, and merely consult our own interest in reference to the\nquestion, these considerations, although inadequate to settle the\nquestion of right in either party, will enable us to comprehend how\nthose who have taken part in the struggle, adopt the one view rather\nthan the other\u2014no special insight into the subject, however, having\ninfluenced their choice. They will, at the same time, explain to us\nmany other things by the way\u2014for example, the fiery zeal on the one\nside and the cold maintenance of their cause on the other; why the one\nparty has met with the warmest approbations, and the other has always\nbeen repulsed by irreconcilable prejudices.\nThere is one thing, however, that determines the proper point of view,\nfrom which alone this preliminary inquiry can be instituted and carried\non with the proper completeness\u2014and that is the comparison of the\nprinciples from which both sides, thesis and antithesis, proceed. My\nreaders would remark in the propositions of the antithesis a complete\nuniformity in the mode of thought and a perfect unity of principle. Its\nprinciple was that of pure empiricism, not only in the explication of\nthe phenomena in the world, but also in the solution of the\ntranscendental ideas, even of that of the universe itself. The\naffirmations of the thesis, on the contrary, were based, in addition to\nthe empirical mode of explanation employed in the series of phenomena,\non intellectual propositions; and its principles were in so far not\nsimple. I shall term the thesis, in view of its essential\ncharacteristic, the dogmatism of pure reason.\nOn the side of Dogmatism, or of the thesis, therefore, in the\ndetermination of the cosmological ideas, we find:\n1. A practical interest, which must be very dear to every\nright-thinking man. That the word has a beginning\u2014that the nature of my\nthinking self is simple, and therefore indestructible\u2014that I am a free\nagent, and raised above the compulsion of nature and her laws\u2014and,\nfinally, that the entire order of things, which form the world, is\ndependent upon a Supreme Being, from whom the whole receives unity and\nconnection\u2014these are so many foundation-stones of morality and\nreligion. The antithesis deprives us of all these supports\u2014or, at\nleast, seems so to deprive us.\n2. A speculative interest of reason manifests itself on this side. For,\nif we take the transcendental ideas and employ them in the manner which\nthe thesis directs, we can exhibit completely \u00e0 priori the entire chain\nof conditions, and understand the derivation of the\nconditioned\u2014beginning from the unconditioned. This the antithesis does\nnot do; and for this reason does not meet with so welcome a reception.\nFor it can give no answer to our question respecting the conditions of\nits synthesis\u2014except such as must be supplemented by another question,\nand so on to infinity. According to it, we must rise from a given\nbeginning to one still higher; every part conducts us to a still\nsmaller one; every event is preceded by another event which is its\ncause; and the conditions of existence rest always upon other and still\nhigher conditions, and find neither end nor basis in some\nself-subsistent thing as the primal being.\n3. This side has also the advantage of popularity; and this constitutes\nno small part of its claim to favour. The common understanding does not\nfind the least difficulty in the idea of the unconditioned beginning of\nall synthesis\u2014accustomed, as it is, rather to follow our consequences\nthan to seek for a proper basis for cognition. In the conception of an\nabsolute first, moreover\u2014the possibility of which it does not inquire\ninto\u2014it is highly gratified to find a firmly-established point of\ndeparture for its attempts at theory; while in the restless and\ncontinuous ascent from the conditioned to the condition, always with\none foot in the air, it can find no satisfaction.\nOn the side of the antithesis, or Empiricism, in the determination of\nthe cosmological ideas:\n1. We cannot discover any such practical interest arising from pure\nprinciples of reason as morality and religion present. On the contrary,\npure empiricism seems to empty them of all their power and influence.\nIf there does not exist a Supreme Being distinct from the world\u2014if the\nworld is without beginning, consequently without a Creator\u2014if our wills\nare not free, and the soul is divisible and subject to corruption just\nlike matter\u2014the ideas and principles of morality lose all validity and\nfall with the transcendental ideas which constituted their theoretical\nsupport.\n2. But empiricism, in compensation, holds out to reason, in its\nspeculative interests, certain important advantages, far exceeding any\nthat the dogmatist can promise us. For, when employed by the\nempiricist, understanding is always upon its proper ground of\ninvestigation\u2014the field of possible experience, the laws of which it\ncan explore, and thus extend its cognition securely and with clear\nintelligence without being stopped by limits in any direction. Here can\nit and ought it to find and present to intuition its proper object\u2014not\nonly in itself, but in all its relations; or, if it employ conceptions,\nupon this ground it can always present the corresponding images in\nclear and unmistakable intuitions. It is quite unnecessary for it to\nrenounce the guidance of nature, to attach itself to ideas, the objects\nof which it cannot know; because, as mere intellectual entities, they\ncannot be presented in any intuition. On the contrary, it is not even\npermitted to abandon its proper occupation, under the pretence that it\nhas been brought to a conclusion (for it never can be), and to pass\ninto the region of idealizing reason and transcendent conceptions,\nwhich it is not required to observe and explore the laws of nature, but\nmerely to think and to imagine\u2014secure from being contradicted by facts,\nbecause they have not been called as witnesses, but passed by, or\nperhaps subordinated to the so-called higher interests and\nconsiderations of pure reason.\nHence the empiricist will never allow himself to accept any epoch of\nnature for the first\u2014the absolutely primal state; he will not believe\nthat there can be limits to his outlook into her wide domains, nor pass\nfrom the objects of nature, which he can satisfactorily explain by\nmeans of observation and mathematical thought\u2014which he can determine\nsynthetically in intuition, to those which neither sense nor\nimagination can ever present in concreto; he will not concede the\nexistence of a faculty in nature, operating independently of the laws\nof nature\u2014a concession which would introduce uncertainty into the\nprocedure of the understanding, which is guided by necessary laws to\nthe observation of phenomena; nor, finally, will he permit himself to\nseek a cause beyond nature, inasmuch as we know nothing but it, and\nfrom it alone receive an objective basis for all our conceptions and\ninstruction in the unvarying laws of things.\nIn truth, if the empirical philosopher had no other purpose in the\nestablishment of his antithesis than to check the presumption of a\nreason which mistakes its true destination, which boasts of its insight\nand its knowledge, just where all insight and knowledge cease to exist,\nand regards that which is valid only in relation to a practical\ninterest, as an advancement of the speculative interests of the mind\n(in order, when it is convenient for itself, to break the thread of our\nphysical investigations, and, under pretence of extending our\ncognition, connect them with transcendental ideas, by means of which we\nreally know only that we know nothing)\u2014if, I say, the empiricist rested\nsatisfied with this benefit, the principle advanced by him would be a\nmaxim recommending moderation in the pretensions of reason and modesty\nin its affirmations, and at the same time would direct us to the right\nmode of extending the province of the understanding, by the help of the\nonly true teacher, experience. In obedience to this advice,\nintellectual hypotheses and faith would not be called in aid of our\npractical interests; nor should we introduce them under the pompous\ntitles of science and insight. For speculative cognition cannot find an\nobjective basis any other where than in experience; and, when we\noverstep its limits our synthesis, which requires ever new cognitions\nindependent of experience, has no substratum of intuition upon which to\nbuild.\nBut if\u2014as often happens\u2014empiricism, in relation to ideas, becomes\nitself dogmatic and boldly denies that which is above the sphere of its\nphenomenal cognition, it falls itself into the error of intemperance\u2014an\nerror which is here all the more reprehensible, as thereby the\npractical interest of reason receives an irreparable injury.\nAnd this constitutes the opposition between Epicureanism[57] and\nPlatonism.\n[57] It is, however, still a matter of doubt whether Epicurus ever\npropounded these principles as directions for the objective employment\nof the understanding. If, indeed, they were nothing more than maxims\nfor the speculative exercise of reason, he gives evidence therein a\nmore genuine philosophic spirit than any of the philosophers of\nantiquity. That, in the explanation of phenomena, we must proceed as\nif the field of inquiry had neither limits in space nor commencement\nin time; that we must be satisfied with the teaching of experience in\nreference to the material of which the world is posed; that we must\nnot look for any other mode of the origination of events than that\nwhich is determined by the unalterable laws of nature; and finally,\nthat we not employ the hypothesis of a cause distinct from the world\nto account for a phenomenon or for the world itself\u2014are principles for\nthe extension of speculative philosophy, and the discovery of the true\nsources of the principles of morals, which, however little conformed\nto in the present day, are undoubtedly correct. At the same time, any\none desirous of ignoring, in mere speculation, these dogmatical\npropositions, need not for that reason be accused of denying them.\nBoth Epicurus and Plato assert more in their systems than they know.\nThe former encourages and advances science\u2014although to the prejudice of\nthe practical; the latter presents us with excellent principles for the\ninvestigation of the practical, but, in relation to everything\nregarding which we can attain to speculative cognition, permits reason\nto append idealistic explanations of natural phenomena, to the great\ninjury of physical investigation.\n3. In regard to the third motive for the preliminary choice of a party\nin this war of assertions, it seems very extraordinary that empiricism\nshould be utterly unpopular. We should be inclined to believe that the\ncommon understanding would receive it with pleasure\u2014promising as it\ndoes to satisfy it without passing the bounds of experience and its\nconnected order; while transcendental dogmatism obliges it to rise to\nconceptions which far surpass the intelligence and ability of the most\npractised thinkers. But in this, in truth, is to be found its real\nmotive. For the common understanding thus finds itself in a situation\nwhere not even the most learned can have the advantage of it. If it\nunderstands little or nothing about these transcendental conceptions,\nno one can boast of understanding any more; and although it may not\nexpress itself in so scholastically correct a manner as others, it can\nbusy itself with reasoning and arguments without end, wandering among\nmere ideas, about which one can always be very eloquent, because we\nknow nothing about them; while, in the observation and investigation of\nnature, it would be forced to remain dumb and to confess its utter\nignorance. Thus indolence and vanity form of themselves strong\nrecommendations of these principles. Besides, although it is a hard\nthing for a philosopher to assume a principle, of which he can give to\nhimself no reasonable account, and still more to employ conceptions,\nthe objective reality of which cannot be established, nothing is more\nusual with the common understanding. It wants something which will\nallow it to go to work with confidence. The difficulty of even\ncomprehending a supposition does not disquiet it, because\u2014not knowing\nwhat comprehending means\u2014it never even thinks of the supposition it may\nbe adopting as a principle; and regards as known that with which it has\nbecome familiar from constant use. And, at last, all speculative\ninterests disappear before the practical interests which it holds dear;\nand it fancies that it understands and knows what its necessities and\nhopes incite it to assume or to believe. Thus the empiricism of\ntranscendentally idealizing reason is robbed of all popularity; and,\nhowever prejudicial it may be to the highest practical principles,\nthere is no fear that it will ever pass the limits of the schools, or\nacquire any favour or influence in society or with the multitude.\nHuman reason is by nature architectonic. That is to say, it regards all\ncognitions as parts of a possible system, and hence accepts only such\nprinciples as at least do not incapacitate a cognition to which we may\nhave attained from being placed along with others in a general system.\nBut the propositions of the antithesis are of a character which renders\nthe completion of an edifice of cognitions impossible. According to\nthese, beyond one state or epoch of the world there is always to be\nfound one more ancient; in every part always other parts themselves\ndivisible; preceding every event another, the origin of which must\nitself be sought still higher; and everything in existence is\nconditioned, and still not dependent on an unconditioned and primal\nexistence. As, therefore, the antithesis will not concede the existence\nof a first beginning which might be available as a foundation, a\ncomplete edifice of cognition, in the presence of such hypothesis, is\nutterly impossible. Thus the architectonic interest of reason, which\nrequires a unity\u2014not empirical, but \u00e0 priori and rational\u2014forms a\nnatural recommendation for the assertions of the thesis in our\nantinomy.\nBut if any one could free himself entirely from all considerations of\ninterest, and weigh without partiality the assertions of reason,\nattending only to their content, irrespective of the consequences which\nfollow from them; such a person, on the supposition that he knew no\nother way out of the confusion than to settle the truth of one or other\nof the conflicting doctrines, would live in a state of continual\nhesitation. Today, he would feel convinced that the human will is free;\nto-morrow, considering the indissoluble chain of nature, he would look\non freedom as a mere illusion and declare nature to be all-in-all. But,\nif he were called to action, the play of the merely speculative reason\nwould disappear like the shapes of a dream, and practical interest\nwould dictate his choice of principles. But, as it well befits a\nreflective and inquiring being to devote certain periods of time to the\nexamination of its own reason\u2014to divest itself of all partiality, and\nfrankly to communicate its observations for the judgement and opinion\nof others; so no one can be blamed for, much less prevented from,\nplacing both parties on their trial, with permission to end themselves,\nfree from intimidation, before intimidation, before a sworn jury of\nequal condition with themselves\u2014the condition of weak and fallible men.\nSection IV. Of the necessity imposed upon Pure Reason of presenting a\nSolution of its Transcendental Problems\nTo avow an ability to solve all problems and to answer all questions\nwould be a profession certain to convict any philosopher of extravagant\nboasting and self-conceit, and at once to destroy the confidence that\nmight otherwise have been reposed in him. There are, however, sciences\nso constituted that every question arising within their sphere must\nnecessarily be capable of receiving an answer from the knowledge\nalready possessed, for the answer must be received from the same\nsources whence the question arose. In such sciences it is not allowable\nto excuse ourselves on the plea of necessary and unavoidable ignorance;\na solution is absolutely requisite. The rule of right and wrong must\nhelp us to the knowledge of what is right or wrong in all possible\ncases; otherwise, the idea of obligation or duty would be utterly null,\nfor we cannot have any obligation to that which we cannot know. On the\nother hand, in our investigations of the phenomena of nature, much must\nremain uncertain, and many questions continue insoluble; because what\nwe know of nature is far from being sufficient to explain all the\nphenomena that are presented to our observation. Now the question is:\nWhether there is in transcendental philosophy any question, relating to\nan object presented to pure reason, which is unanswerable by this\nreason; and whether we must regard the subject of the question as quite\nuncertain, so far as our knowledge extends, and must give it a place\namong those subjects, of which we have just so much conception as is\nsufficient to enable us to raise a question\u2014faculty or materials\nfailing us, however, when we attempt an answer.\nNow I maintain that, among all speculative cognition, the peculiarity\nof transcendental philosophy is that there is no question, relating to\nan object presented to pure reason, which is insoluble by this reason;\nand that the profession of unavoidable ignorance\u2014the problem being\nalleged to be beyond the reach of our faculties\u2014cannot free us from the\nobligation to present a complete and satisfactory answer. For the very\nconception which enables us to raise the question must give us the\npower of answering it; inasmuch as the object, as in the case of right\nand wrong, is not to be discovered out of the conception.\nBut, in transcendental philosophy, it is only the cosmological\nquestions to which we can demand a satisfactory answer in relation to\nthe constitution of their object; and the philosopher is not permitted\nto avail himself of the pretext of necessary ignorance and impenetrable\nobscurity. These questions relate solely to the cosmological ideas. For\nthe object must be given in experience, and the question relates to the\nadequateness of the object to an idea. If the object is transcendental\nand therefore itself unknown; if the question, for example, is whether\nthe object\u2014the something, the phenomenon of which (internal\u2014in\nourselves) is thought\u2014that is to say, the soul, is in itself a simple\nbeing; or whether there is a cause of all things, which is absolutely\nnecessary\u2014in such cases we are seeking for our idea an object, of which\nwe may confess that it is unknown to us, though we must not on that\naccount assert that it is impossible.[58] The cosmological ideas alone\nposses the peculiarity that we can presuppose the object of them and\nthe empirical synthesis requisite for the conception of that object to\nbe given; and the question, which arises from these ideas, relates\nmerely to the progress of this synthesis, in so far as it must contain\nabsolute totality\u2014which, however, is not empirical, as it cannot be\ngiven in any experience. Now, as the question here is solely in regard\nto a thing as the object of a possible experience and not as a thing in\nitself, the answer to the transcendental cosmological question need not\nbe sought out of the idea, for the question does not regard an object\nin itself. The question in relation to a possible experience is not,\n\u201cWhat can be given in an experience in concreto\u201d but \u201cwhat is contained\nin the idea, to which the empirical synthesis must approximate.\u201d The\nquestion must therefore be capable of solution from the idea alone. For\nthe idea is a creation of reason itself, which therefore cannot\ndisclaim the obligation to answer or refer us to the unknown object.\n[58] The question, \u201cWhat is the constitution of a transcendental\nobject?\u201d is unanswerable\u2014we are unable to say what it is; but we can\nperceive that the question itself is nothing; because it does not\nrelate to any object that can be presented to us. For this reason, we\nmust consider all the questions raised in transcendental psychology as\nanswerable and as really answered; for they relate to the\ntranscendental subject of all internal phenomena, which is not itself\nphenomenon and consequently not given as an object, in which,\nmoreover, none of the categories\u2014and it is to them that the question\nis properly directed\u2014find any conditions of its application. Here,\ntherefore, is a case where no answer is the only proper answer. For a\nquestion regarding the constitution of a something which cannot be\ncogitated by any determined predicate, being completely beyond the\nsphere of objects and experience, is perfectly null and void.\nIt is not so extraordinary, as it at first sight appears, that a\nscience should demand and expect satisfactory answers to all the\nquestions that may arise within its own sphere (questiones domesticae),\nalthough, up to a certain time, these answers may not have been\ndiscovered. There are, in addition to transcendental philosophy, only\ntwo pure sciences of reason; the one with a speculative, the other with\na practical content\u2014pure mathematics and pure ethics. Has any one ever\nheard it alleged that, from our complete and necessary ignorance of the\nconditions, it is uncertain what exact relation the diameter of a\ncircle bears to the circle in rational or irrational numbers? By the\nformer the sum cannot be given exactly, by the latter only\napproximately; and therefore we decide that the impossibility of a\nsolution of the question is evident. Lambert presented us with a\ndemonstration of this. In the general principles of morals there can be\nnothing uncertain, for the propositions are either utterly without\nmeaning, or must originate solely in our rational conceptions. On the\nother hand, there must be in physical science an infinite number of\nconjectures, which can never become certainties; because the phenomena\nof nature are not given as objects dependent on our conceptions. The\nkey to the solution of such questions cannot, therefore, be found in\nour conceptions, or in pure thought, but must lie without us and for\nthat reason is in many cases not to be discovered; and consequently a\nsatisfactory explanation cannot be expected. The questions of\ntranscendental analytic, which relate to the deduction of our pure\ncognition, are not to be regarded as of the same kind as those\nmentioned above; for we are not at present treating of the certainty of\njudgements in relation to the origin of our conceptions, but only of\nthat certainty in relation to objects.\nWe cannot, therefore, escape the responsibility of at least a critical\nsolution of the questions of reason, by complaints of the limited\nnature of our faculties, and the seemingly humble confession that it is\nbeyond the power of our reason to decide, whether the world has existed\nfrom all eternity or had a beginning\u2014whether it is infinitely extended,\nor enclosed within certain limits\u2014whether anything in the world is\nsimple, or whether everything must be capable of infinite\ndivisibility\u2014whether freedom can originate phenomena, or whether\neverything is absolutely dependent on the laws and order of nature\u2014and,\nfinally, whether there exists a being that is completely unconditioned\nand necessary, or whether the existence of everything is conditioned\nand consequently dependent on something external to itself, and\ntherefore in its own nature contingent. For all these questions relate\nto an object, which can be given nowhere else than in thought. This\nobject is the absolutely unconditioned totality of the synthesis of\nphenomena. If the conceptions in our minds do not assist us to some\ncertain result in regard to these problems, we must not defend\nourselves on the plea that the object itself remains hidden from and\nunknown to us. For no such thing or object can be given\u2014it is not to be\nfound out of the idea in our minds. We must seek the cause of our\nfailure in our idea itself, which is an insoluble problem and in regard\nto which we obstinately assume that there exists a real object\ncorresponding and adequate to it. A clear explanation of the dialectic\nwhich lies in our conception, will very soon enable us to come to a\nsatisfactory decision in regard to such a question.\nThe pretext that we are unable to arrive at certainty in regard to\nthese problems may be met with this question, which requires at least a\nplain answer: \u201cFrom what source do the ideas originate, the solution of\nwhich involves you in such difficulties? Are you seeking for an\nexplanation of certain phenomena; and do you expect these ideas to give\nyou the principles or the rules of this explanation?\u201d Let it be\ngranted, that all nature was laid open before you; that nothing was hid\nfrom your senses and your consciousness. Still, you could not cognize\nin concreto the object of your ideas in any experience. For what is\ndemanded is not only this full and complete intuition, but also a\ncomplete synthesis and the consciousness of its absolute totality; and\nthis is not possible by means of any empirical cognition. It follows\nthat your question\u2014your idea\u2014is by no means necessary for the\nexplanation of any phenomenon; and the idea cannot have been in any\nsense given by the object itself. For such an object can never be\npresented to us, because it cannot be given by any possible experience.\nWhatever perceptions you may attain to, you are still surrounded by\nconditions\u2014in space, or in time\u2014and you cannot discover anything\nunconditioned; nor can you decide whether this unconditioned is to be\nplaced in an absolute beginning of the synthesis, or in an absolute\ntotality of the series without beginning. A whole, in the empirical\nsignification of the term, is always merely comparative. The absolute\nwhole of quantity (the universe), of division, of derivation, of the\ncondition of existence, with the question\u2014whether it is to be produced\nby finite or infinite synthesis, no possible experience can instruct us\nconcerning. You will not, for example, be able to explain the phenomena\nof a body in the least degree better, whether you believe it to consist\nof simple, or of composite parts; for a simple phenomenon\u2014and just as\nlittle an infinite series of composition\u2014can never be presented to your\nperception. Phenomena require and admit of explanation, only in so far\nas the conditions of that explanation are given in perception; but the\nsum total of that which is given in phenomena, considered as an\nabsolute whole, is itself a perception\u2014and we cannot therefore seek for\nexplanations of this whole beyond itself, in other perceptions. The\nexplanation of this whole is the proper object of the transcendental\nproblems of pure reason.\nAlthough, therefore, the solution of these problems is unattainable\nthrough experience, we must not permit ourselves to say that it is\nuncertain how the object of our inquiries is constituted. For the\nobject is in our own mind and cannot be discovered in experience; and\nwe have only to take care that our thoughts are consistent with each\nother, and to avoid falling into the amphiboly of regarding our idea as\na representation of an object empirically given, and therefore to be\ncognized according to the laws of experience. A dogmatical solution is\ntherefore not only unsatisfactory but impossible. The critical\nsolution, which may be a perfectly certain one, does not consider the\nquestion objectively, but proceeds by inquiring into the basis of the\ncognition upon which the question rests.\nSection V. Sceptical Exposition of the Cosmological Problems presented\nin the four Transcendental Ideas\nWe should be quite willing to desist from the demand of a dogmatical\nanswer to our questions, if we understood beforehand that, be the\nanswer what it may, it would only serve to increase our ignorance, to\nthrow us from one incomprehensibility into another, from one obscurity\ninto another still greater, and perhaps lead us into irreconcilable\ncontradictions. If a dogmatical affirmative or negative answer is\ndemanded, is it at all prudent to set aside the probable grounds of a\nsolution which lie before us and to take into consideration what\nadvantage we shall gain, if the answer is to favour the one side or the\nother? If it happens that in both cases the answer is mere nonsense, we\nhave in this an irresistible summons to institute a critical\ninvestigation of the question, for the purpose of discovering whether\nit is based on a groundless presupposition and relates to an idea, the\nfalsity of which would be more easily exposed in its application and\nconsequences than in the mere representation of its content. This is\nthe great utility of the sceptical mode of treating the questions\naddressed by pure reason to itself. By this method we easily rid\nourselves of the confusions of dogmatism, and establish in its place a\ntemperate criticism, which, as a genuine cathartic, will successfully\nremove the presumptuous notions of philosophy and their consequence\u2014the\nvain pretension to universal science.\nIf, then, I could understand the nature of a cosmological idea and\nperceive, before I entered on the discussion of the subject at all,\nthat, whatever side of the question regarding the unconditioned of the\nregressive synthesis of phenomena it favoured\u2014it must either be too\ngreat or too small for every conception of the understanding\u2014I would be\nable to comprehend how the idea, which relates to an object of\nexperience\u2014an experience which must be adequate to and in accordance\nwith a possible conception of the understanding\u2014must be completely void\nand without significance, inasmuch as its object is inadequate,\nconsider it as we may. And this is actually the case with all\ncosmological conceptions, which, for the reason above mentioned,\ninvolve reason, so long as it remains attached to them, in an\nunavoidable antinomy. For suppose:\nFirst, that the world has no beginning\u2014in this case it is too large for\nour conception; for this conception, which consists in a successive\nregress, cannot overtake the whole eternity that has elapsed. Grant\nthat it has a beginning, it is then too small for the conception of the\nunderstanding. For, as a beginning presupposes a time preceding, it\ncannot be unconditioned; and the law of the empirical employment of the\nunderstanding imposes the necessity of looking for a higher condition\nof time; and the world is, therefore, evidently too small for this law.\nThe same is the case with the double answer to the question regarding\nthe extent, in space, of the world. For, if it is infinite and\nunlimited, it must be too large for every possible empirical\nconception. If it is finite and limited, we have a right to ask: \u201cWhat\ndetermines these limits?\u201d Void space is not a self-subsistent correlate\nof things, and cannot be a final condition\u2014and still less an empirical\ncondition, forming a part of a possible experience. For how can we have\nany experience or perception of an absolute void? But the absolute\ntotality of the empirical synthesis requires that the unconditioned be\nan empirical conception. Consequently, a finite world is too small for\nour conception.\nSecondly, if every phenomenon (matter) in space consists of an infinite\nnumber of parts, the regress of the division is always too great for\nour conception; and if the division of space must cease with some\nmember of the division (the simple), it is too small for the idea of\nthe unconditioned. For the member at which we have discontinued our\ndivision still admits a regress to many more parts contained in the\nobject.\nThirdly, suppose that every event in the world happens in accordance\nwith the laws of nature; the causality of a cause must itself be an\nevent and necessitates a regress to a still higher cause, and\nconsequently the unceasing prolongation of the series of conditions a\nparte priori. Operative nature is therefore too large for every\nconception we can form in the synthesis of cosmical events.\nIf we admit the existence of spontaneously produced events, that is, of\nfree agency, we are driven, in our search for sufficient reasons, on an\nunavoidable law of nature and are compelled to appeal to the empirical\nlaw of causality, and we find that any such totality of connection in\nour synthesis is too small for our necessary empirical conception.\nFourthly, if we assume the existence of an absolutely necessary\nbeing\u2014whether it be the world or something in the world, or the cause\nof the world\u2014we must place it in a time at an infinite distance from\nany given moment; for, otherwise, it must be dependent on some other\nand higher existence. Such an existence is, in this case, too large for\nour empirical conception, and unattainable by the continued regress of\nany synthesis.\nBut if we believe that everything in the world\u2014be it condition or\nconditioned\u2014is contingent; every given existence is too small for our\nconception. For in this case we are compelled to seek for some other\nexistence upon which the former depends.\nWe have said that in all these cases the cosmological idea is either\ntoo great or too small for the empirical regress in a synthesis, and\nconsequently for every possible conception of the understanding. Why\ndid we not express ourselves in a manner exactly the reverse of this\nand, instead of accusing the cosmological idea of over stepping or of\nfalling short of its true aim, possible experience, say that, in the\nfirst case, the empirical conception is always too small for the idea,\nand in the second too great, and thus attach the blame of these\ncontradictions to the empirical regress? The reason is this. Possible\nexperience can alone give reality to our conceptions; without it a\nconception is merely an idea, without truth or relation to an object.\nHence a possible empirical conception must be the standard by which we\nare to judge whether an idea is anything more than an idea and fiction\nof thought, or whether it relates to an object in the world. If we say\nof a thing that in relation to some other thing it is too large or too\nsmall, the former is considered as existing for the sake of the latter,\nand requiring to be adapted to it. Among the trivial subjects of\ndiscussion in the old schools of dialectics was this question: \u201cIf a\nball cannot pass through a hole, shall we say that the ball is too\nlarge or the hole too small?\u201d In this case it is indifferent what\nexpression we employ; for we do not know which exists for the sake of\nthe other. On the other hand, we cannot say: \u201cThe man is too long for\nhis coat\u201d; but: \u201cThe coat is too short for the man.\u201d\nWe are thus led to the well-founded suspicion that the cosmological\nideas, and all the conflicting sophistical assertions connected with\nthem, are based upon a false and fictitious conception of the mode in\nwhich the object of these ideas is presented to us; and this suspicion\nwill probably direct us how to expose the illusion that has so long led\nus astray from the truth.\nSection VI. Transcendental Idealism as the Key to the Solution of Pure\nCosmological Dialectic\nIn the transcendental \u00e6sthetic we proved that everything intuited in\nspace and time, all objects of a possible experience, are nothing but\nphenomena, that is, mere representations; and that these, as presented\nto us\u2014as extended bodies, or as series of changes\u2014have no\nself-subsistent existence apart from human thought. This doctrine I\ncall Transcendental Idealism.[59] The realist in the transcendental\nsense regards these modifications of our sensibility, these mere\nrepresentations, as things subsisting in themselves.\n[59] I have elsewhere termed this theory formal idealism, to\ndistinguish it from material idealism, which doubts or denies the\nexistence of external things. To avoid ambiguity, it seems advisable\nin many cases to employ this term instead of that mentioned in the\ntext.\nIt would be unjust to accuse us of holding the long-decried theory of\nempirical idealism, which, while admitting the reality of space,\ndenies, or at least doubts, the existence of bodies extended in it, and\nthus leaves us without a sufficient criterion of reality and illusion.\nThe supporters of this theory find no difficulty in admitting the\nreality of the phenomena of the internal sense in time; nay, they go\nthe length of maintaining that this internal experience is of itself a\nsufficient proof of the real existence of its object as a thing in\nitself.\nTranscendental idealism allows that the objects of external\nintuition\u2014as intuited in space, and all changes in time\u2014as represented\nby the internal sense, are real. For, as space is the form of that\nintuition which we call external, and, without objects in space, no\nempirical representation could be given us, we can and ought to regard\nextended bodies in it as real. The case is the same with\nrepresentations in time. But time and space, with all phenomena\ntherein, are not in themselves things. They are nothing but\nrepresentations and cannot exist out of and apart from the mind. Nay,\nthe sensuous internal intuition of the mind (as the object of\nconsciousness), the determination of which is represented by the\nsuccession of different states in time, is not the real, proper self,\nas it exists in itself\u2014not the transcendental subject\u2014but only a\nphenomenon, which is presented to the sensibility of this, to us,\nunknown being. This internal phenomenon cannot be admitted to be a\nself-subsisting thing; for its condition is time, and time cannot be\nthe condition of a thing in itself. But the empirical truth of\nphenomena in space and time is guaranteed beyond the possibility of\ndoubt, and sufficiently distinguished from the illusion of dreams or\nfancy\u2014although both have a proper and thorough connection in an\nexperience according to empirical laws. The objects of experience then\nare not things in themselves, but are given only in experience, and\nhave no existence apart from and independently of experience. That\nthere may be inhabitants in the moon, although no one has ever observed\nthem, must certainly be admitted; but this assertion means only, that\nwe may in the possible progress of experience discover them at some\nfuture time. For that which stands in connection with a perception\naccording to the laws of the progress of experience is real. They are\ntherefore really existent, if they stand in empirical connection with\nmy actual or real consciousness, although they are not in themselves\nreal, that is, apart from the progress of experience.\nThere is nothing actually given\u2014we can be conscious of nothing as real,\nexcept a perception and the empirical progression from it to other\npossible perceptions. For phenomena, as mere representations, are real\nonly in perception; and perception is, in fact, nothing but the reality\nof an empirical representation, that is, a phenomenon. To call a\nphenomenon a real thing prior to perception means either that we must\nmeet with this phenomenon in the progress of experience, or it means\nnothing at all. For I can say only of a thing in itself that it exists\nwithout relation to the senses and experience. But we are speaking here\nmerely of phenomena in space and time, both of which are determinations\nof sensibility, and not of things in themselves. It follows that\nphenomena are not things in themselves, but are mere representations,\nwhich if not given in us\u2014in perception\u2014are non-existent.\nThe faculty of sensuous intuition is properly a receptivity\u2014a capacity\nof being affected in a certain manner by representations, the relation\nof which to each other is a pure intuition of space and time\u2014the pure\nforms of sensibility. These representations, in so far as they are\nconnected and determinable in this relation (in space and time)\naccording to laws of the unity of experience, are called objects. The\nnon-sensuous cause of these representations is completely unknown to us\nand hence cannot be intuited as an object. For such an object could not\nbe represented either in space or in time; and without these conditions\nintuition or representation is impossible. We may, at the same time,\nterm the non-sensuous cause of phenomena the transcendental object\u2014but\nmerely as a mental correlate to sensibility, considered as a\nreceptivity. To this transcendental object we may attribute the whole\nconnection and extent of our possible perceptions, and say that it is\ngiven and exists in itself prior to all experience. But the phenomena,\ncorresponding to it, are not given as things in themselves, but in\nexperience alone. For they are mere representations, receiving from\nperceptions alone significance and relation to a real object, under the\ncondition that this or that perception\u2014indicating an object\u2014is in\ncomplete connection with all others in accordance with the rules of the\nunity of experience. Thus we can say: \u201cThe things that really existed\nin past time are given in the transcendental object of experience.\u201d But\nthese are to me real objects, only in so far as I can represent to my\nown mind, that a regressive series of possible perceptions\u2014following\nthe indications of history, or the footsteps of cause and effect\u2014in\naccordance with empirical laws\u2014that, in one word, the course of the\nworld conducts us to an elapsed series of time as the condition of the\npresent time. This series in past time is represented as real, not in\nitself, but only in connection with a possible experience. Thus, when I\nsay that certain events occurred in past time, I merely assert the\npossibility of prolonging the chain of experience, from the present\nperception, upwards to the conditions that determine it according to\ntime.\nIf I represent to myself all objects existing in all space and time, I\ndo not thereby place these in space and time prior to all experience;\non the contrary, such a representation is nothing more than the notion\nof a possible experience, in its absolute completeness. In experience\nalone are those objects, which are nothing but representations, given.\nBut, when I say they existed prior to my experience, this means only\nthat I must begin with the perception present to me and follow the\ntrack indicated until I discover them in some part or region of\nexperience. The cause of the empirical condition of this\nprogression\u2014and consequently at what member therein I must stop, and at\nwhat point in the regress I am to find this member\u2014is transcendental,\nand hence necessarily incognizable. But with this we have not to do;\nour concern is only with the law of progression in experience, in which\nobjects, that is, phenomena, are given. It is a matter of indifference,\nwhether I say, \u201cI may in the progress of experience discover stars, at\na hundred times greater distance than the most distant of those now\nvisible,\u201d or, \u201cStars at this distance may be met in space, although no\none has, or ever will discover them.\u201d For, if they are given as things\nin themselves, without any relation to possible experience, they are\nfor me non-existent, consequently, are not objects, for they are not\ncontained in the regressive series of experience. But, if these\nphenomena must be employed in the construction or support of the\ncosmological idea of an absolute whole, and when we are discussing a\nquestion that oversteps the limits of possible experience, the proper\ndistinction of the different theories of the reality of sensuous\nobjects is of great importance, in order to avoid the illusion which\nmust necessarily arise from the misinterpretation of our empirical\nconceptions.\nSection VII. Critical Solution of the Cosmological Problem\nThe antinomy of pure reason is based upon the following dialectical\nargument: \u201cIf that which is conditioned is given, the whole series of\nits conditions is also given; but sensuous objects are given as\nconditioned; consequently...\u201d This syllogism, the major of which seems\nso natural and evident, introduces as many cosmological ideas as there\nare different kinds of conditions in the synthesis of phenomena, in so\nfar as these conditions constitute a series. These ideas require\nabsolute totality in the series, and thus place reason in inextricable\nembarrassment. Before proceeding to expose the fallacy in this\ndialectical argument, it will be necessary to have a correct\nunderstanding of certain conceptions that appear in it.\nIn the first place, the following proposition is evident, and\nindubitably certain: \u201cIf the conditioned is given, a regress in the\nseries of all its conditions is thereby imperatively required.\u201d For the\nvery conception of a conditioned is a conception of something related\nto a condition, and, if this condition is itself conditioned, to\nanother condition\u2014and so on through all the members of the series. This\nproposition is, therefore, analytical and has nothing to fear from\ntranscendental criticism. It is a logical postulate of reason: to\npursue, as far as possible, the connection of a conception with its\nconditions.\nIf, in the second place, both the conditioned and the condition are\nthings in themselves, and if the former is given, not only is the\nregress to the latter requisite, but the latter is really given with\nthe former. Now, as this is true of all the members of the series, the\nentire series of conditions, and with them the unconditioned, is at the\nsame time given in the very fact of the conditioned, the existence of\nwhich is possible only in and through that series, being given. In this\ncase, the synthesis of the conditioned with its condition, is a\nsynthesis of the understanding merely, which represents things as they\nare, without regarding whether and how we can cognize them. But if I\nhave to do with phenomena, which, in their character of mere\nrepresentations, are not given, if I do not attain to a cognition of\nthem (in other words, to themselves, for they are nothing more than\nempirical cognitions), I am not entitled to say: \u201cIf the conditioned is\ngiven, all its conditions (as phenomena) are also given.\u201d I cannot,\ntherefore, from the fact of a conditioned being given, infer the\nabsolute totality of the series of its conditions. For phenomena are\nnothing but an empirical synthesis in apprehension or perception, and\nare therefore given only in it. Now, in speaking of phenomena it does\nnot follow that, if the conditioned is given, the synthesis which\nconstitutes its empirical condition is also thereby given and\npresupposed; such a synthesis can be established only by an actual\nregress in the series of conditions. But we are entitled to say in this\ncase that a regress to the conditions of a conditioned, in other words,\nthat a continuous empirical synthesis is enjoined; that, if the\nconditions are not given, they are at least required; and that we are\ncertain to discover the conditions in this regress.\nWe can now see that the major, in the above cosmological syllogism,\ntakes the conditioned in the transcendental signification which it has\nin the pure category, while the minor speaks of it in the empirical\nsignification which it has in the category as applied to phenomena.\nThere is, therefore, a dialectical fallacy in the syllogism\u2014a sophisma\nfigurae dictionis. But this fallacy is not a consciously devised one,\nbut a perfectly natural illusion of the common reason of man. For, when\na thing is given as conditioned, we presuppose in the major its\nconditions and their series, unperceived, as it were, and unseen;\nbecause this is nothing more than the logical requirement of complete\nand satisfactory premisses for a given conclusion. In this case, time\nis altogether left out in the connection of the conditioned with the\ncondition; they are supposed to be given in themselves, and\ncontemporaneously. It is, moreover, just as natural to regard phenomena\n(in the minor) as things in themselves and as objects presented to the\npure understanding, as in the major, in which complete abstraction was\nmade of all conditions of intuition. But it is under these conditions\nalone that objects are given. Now we overlooked a remarkable\ndistinction between the conceptions. The synthesis of the conditioned\nwith its condition, and the complete series of the latter (in the\nmajor) are not limited by time, and do not contain the conception of\nsuccession. On the contrary, the empirical synthesis and the series of\nconditions in the phenomenal world\u2014subsumed in the minor\u2014are\nnecessarily successive and given in time alone. It follows that I\ncannot presuppose in the minor, as I did in the major, the absolute\ntotality of the synthesis and of the series therein represented; for in\nthe major all the members of the series are given as things in\nthemselves\u2014without any limitations or conditions of time, while in the\nminor they are possible only in and through a successive regress, which\ncannot exist, except it be actually carried into execution in the world\nof phenomena.\nAfter this proof of the viciousness of the argument commonly employed\nin maintaining cosmological assertions, both parties may now be justly\ndismissed, as advancing claims without grounds or title. But the\nprocess has not been ended by convincing them that one or both were in\nthe wrong and had maintained an assertion which was without valid\ngrounds of proof. Nothing seems to be clearer than that, if one\nmaintains: \u201cThe world has a beginning,\u201d and another: \u201cThe world has no\nbeginning,\u201d one of the two must be right. But it is likewise clear\nthat, if the evidence on both sides is equal, it is impossible to\ndiscover on what side the truth lies; and the controversy continues,\nalthough the parties have been recommended to peace before the tribunal\nof reason. There remains, then, no other means of settling the question\nthan to convince the parties, who refute each other with such\nconclusiveness and ability, that they are disputing about nothing, and\nthat a transcendental illusion has been mocking them with visions of\nreality where there is none. The mode of adjusting a dispute which\ncannot be decided upon its own merits, we shall now proceed to lay\nbefore our readers.\nZeno of Elea, a subtle dialectician, was severely reprimanded by Plato\nas a sophist, who, merely from the base motive of exhibiting his skill\nin discussion, maintained and subverted the same proposition by\narguments as powerful and convincing on the one side as on the other.\nHe maintained, for example, that God (who was probably nothing more, in\nhis view, than the world) is neither finite nor infinite, neither in\nmotion nor in rest, neither similar nor dissimilar to any other thing.\nIt seemed to those philosophers who criticized his mode of discussion\nthat his purpose was to deny completely both of two self-contradictory\npropositions\u2014which is absurd. But I cannot believe that there is any\njustice in this accusation. The first of these propositions I shall\npresently consider in a more detailed manner. With regard to the\nothers, if by the word of God he understood merely the Universe, his\nmeaning must have been\u2014that it cannot be permanently present in one\nplace\u2014that is, at rest\u2014nor be capable of changing its place\u2014that is, of\nmoving\u2014because all places are in the universe, and the universe itself\nis, therefore, in no place. Again, if the universe contains in itself\neverything that exists, it cannot be similar or dissimilar to any other\nthing, because there is, in fact, no other thing with which it can be\ncompared. If two opposite judgements presuppose a contingent\nimpossible, or arbitrary condition, both\u2014in spite of their opposition\n(which is, however, not properly or really a contradiction)\u2014fall away;\nbecause the condition, which ensured the validity of both, has itself\ndisappeared.\nIf we say: \u201cEverybody has either a good or a bad smell,\u201d we have\nomitted a third possible judgement\u2014it has no smell at all; and thus\nboth conflicting statements may be false. If we say: \u201cIt is either\ngood-smelling or not good-smelling (vel suaveolens vel\nnon-suaveolens),\u201d both judgements are contradictorily opposed; and the\ncontradictory opposite of the former judgement\u2014some bodies are not\ngood-smelling\u2014embraces also those bodies which have no smell at all. In\nthe preceding pair of opposed judgements (per disparata), the\ncontingent condition of the conception of body (smell) attached to both\nconflicting statements, instead of having been omitted in the latter,\nwhich is consequently not the contradictory opposite of the former.\nIf, accordingly, we say: \u201cThe world is either infinite in extension, or\nit is not infinite (non est infinitus)\u201d; and if the former proposition\nis false, its contradictory opposite\u2014the world is not infinite\u2014must be\ntrue. And thus I should deny the existence of an infinite, without,\nhowever affirming the existence of a finite world. But if we construct\nour proposition thus: \u201cThe world is either infinite or finite\n(non-infinite),\u201d both statements may be false. For, in this case, we\nconsider the world as per se determined in regard to quantity, and\nwhile, in the one judgement, we deny its infinite and consequently,\nperhaps, its independent existence; in the other, we append to the\nworld, regarded as a thing in itself, a certain determination\u2014that of\nfinitude; and the latter may be false as well as the former, if the\nworld is not given as a thing in itself, and thus neither as finite nor\nas infinite in quantity. This kind of opposition I may be allowed to\nterm dialectical; that of contradictories may be called analytical\nopposition. Thus then, of two dialectically opposed judgements both may\nbe false, from the fact, that the one is not a mere contradictory of\nthe other, but actually enounces more than is requisite for a full and\ncomplete contradiction.\nWhen we regard the two propositions\u2014\u201cThe world is infinite in\nquantity,\u201d and, \u201cThe world is finite in quantity,\u201d as contradictory\nopposites, we are assuming that the world\u2014the complete series of\nphenomena\u2014is a thing in itself. For it remains as a permanent quantity,\nwhether I deny the infinite or the finite regress in the series of its\nphenomena. But if we dismiss this assumption\u2014this transcendental\nillusion\u2014and deny that it is a thing in itself, the contradictory\nopposition is metamorphosed into a merely dialectical one; and the\nworld, as not existing in itself\u2014independently of the regressive series\nof my representations\u2014exists in like manner neither as a whole which is\ninfinite nor as a whole which is finite in itself. The universe exists\nfor me only in the empirical regress of the series of phenomena and not\nper se. If, then, it is always conditioned, it is never completely or\nas a whole; and it is, therefore, not an unconditioned whole and does\nnot exist as such, either with an infinite, or with a finite quantity.\nWhat we have here said of the first cosmological idea\u2014that of the\nabsolute totality of quantity in phenomena\u2014applies also to the others.\nThe series of conditions is discoverable only in the regressive\nsynthesis itself, and not in the phenomenon considered as a thing in\nitself\u2014given prior to all regress. Hence I am compelled to say: \u201cThe\naggregate of parts in a given phenomenon is in itself neither finite\nnor infinite; and these parts are given only in the regressive\nsynthesis of decomposition\u2014a synthesis which is never given in absolute\ncompleteness, either as finite, or as infinite.\u201d The same is the case\nwith the series of subordinated causes, or of the conditioned up to the\nunconditioned and necessary existence, which can never be regarded as\nin itself, and in its totality, either as finite or as infinite;\nbecause, as a series of subordinate representations, it subsists only\nin the dynamical regress and cannot be regarded as existing previously\nto this regress, or as a self-subsistent series of things.\nThus the antinomy of pure reason in its cosmological ideas disappears.\nFor the above demonstration has established the fact that it is merely\nthe product of a dialectical and illusory opposition, which arises from\nthe application of the idea of absolute totality\u2014admissible only as a\ncondition of things in themselves\u2014to phenomena, which exist only in our\nrepresentations, and\u2014when constituting a series\u2014in a successive\nregress. This antinomy of reason may, however, be really profitable to\nour speculative interests, not in the way of contributing any\ndogmatical addition, but as presenting to us another material support\nin our critical investigations. For it furnishes us with an indirect\nproof of the transcendental ideality of phenomena, if our minds were\nnot completely satisfied with the direct proof set forth in the\nTrancendental \u00c6sthetic. The proof would proceed in the following\ndilemma. If the world is a whole existing in itself, it must be either\nfinite or infinite. But it is neither finite nor infinite\u2014as has been\nshown, on the one side, by the thesis, on the other, by the antithesis.\nTherefore the world\u2014the content of all phenomena\u2014is not a whole\nexisting in itself. It follows that phenomena are nothing, apart from\nour representations. And this is what we mean by transcendental\nideality.\nThis remark is of some importance. It enables us to see that the proofs\nof the fourfold antinomy are not mere sophistries\u2014are not fallacious,\nbut grounded on the nature of reason, and valid\u2014under the supposition\nthat phenomena are things in themselves. The opposition of the\njudgements which follow makes it evident that a fallacy lay in the\ninitial supposition, and thus helps us to discover the true\nconstitution of objects of sense. This transcendental dialectic does\nnot favour scepticism, although it presents us with a triumphant\ndemonstration of the advantages of the sceptical method, the great\nutility of which is apparent in the antinomy, where the arguments of\nreason were allowed to confront each other in undiminished force. And\nalthough the result of these conflicts of reason is not what we\nexpected\u2014although we have obtained no positive dogmatical addition to\nmetaphysical science\u2014we have still reaped a great advantage in the\ncorrection of our judgements on these subjects of thought.\nSection VIII. Regulative Principle of Pure Reason in relation to the\nCosmological Ideas\nThe cosmological principle of totality could not give us any certain\nknowledge in regard to the maximum in the series of conditions in the\nworld of sense, considered as a thing in itself. The actual regress in\nthe series is the only means of approaching this maximum. This\nprinciple of pure reason, therefore, may still be considered as\nvalid\u2014not as an axiom enabling us to cogitate totality in the object as\nactual, but as a problem for the understanding, which requires it to\ninstitute and to continue, in conformity with the idea of totality in\nthe mind, the regress in the series of the conditions of a given\nconditioned. For in the world of sense, that is, in space and time,\nevery condition which we discover in our investigation of phenomena is\nitself conditioned; because sensuous objects are not things in\nthemselves (in which case an absolutely unconditioned might be reached\nin the progress of cognition), but are merely empirical representations\nthe conditions of which must always be found in intuition. The\nprinciple of reason is therefore properly a mere rule\u2014prescribing a\nregress in the series of conditions for given phenomena, and\nprohibiting any pause or rest on an absolutely unconditioned. It is,\ntherefore, not a principle of the possibility of experience or of the\nempirical cognition of sensuous objects\u2014consequently not a principle of\nthe understanding; for every experience is confined within certain\nproper limits determined by the given intuition. Still less is it a\nconstitutive principle of reason authorizing us to extend our\nconception of the sensuous world beyond all possible experience. It is\nmerely a principle for the enlargement and extension of experience as\nfar as is possible for human faculties. It forbids us to consider any\nempirical limits as absolute. It is, hence, a principle of reason,\nwhich, as a rule, dictates how we ought to proceed in our empirical\nregress, but is unable to anticipate or indicate prior to the empirical\nregress what is given in the object itself. I have termed it for this\nreason a regulative principle of reason; while the principle of the\nabsolute totality of the series of conditions, as existing in itself\nand given in the object, is a constitutive cosmological principle. This\ndistinction will at once demonstrate the falsehood of the constitutive\nprinciple, and prevent us from attributing (by a transcendental\nsubreptio) objective reality to an idea, which is valid only as a rule.\nIn order to understand the proper meaning of this rule of pure reason,\nwe must notice first that it cannot tell us what the object is, but\nonly how the empirical regress is to be proceeded with in order to\nattain to the complete conception of the object. If it gave us any\ninformation in respect to the former statement, it would be a\nconstitutive principle\u2014a principle impossible from the nature of pure\nreason. It will not therefore enable us to establish any such\nconclusions as: \u201cThe series of conditions for a given conditioned is in\nitself finite,\u201d or, \u201cIt is infinite.\u201d For, in this case, we should be\ncogitating in the mere idea of absolute totality, an object which is\nnot and cannot be given in experience; inasmuch as we should be\nattributing a reality objective and independent of the empirical\nsynthesis, to a series of phenomena. This idea of reason cannot then be\nregarded as valid\u2014except as a rule for the regressive synthesis in the\nseries of conditions, according to which we must proceed from the\nconditioned, through all intermediate and subordinate conditions, up to\nthe unconditioned; although this goal is unattained and unattainable.\nFor the absolutely unconditioned cannot be discovered in the sphere of\nexperience.\nWe now proceed to determine clearly our notion of a synthesis which can\nnever be complete. There are two terms commonly employed for this\npurpose. These terms are regarded as expressions of different and\ndistinguishable notions, although the ground of the distinction has\nnever been clearly exposed. The term employed by the mathematicians is\nprogressus in infinitum. The philosophers prefer the expression\nprogressus in indefinitum. Without detaining the reader with an\nexamination of the reasons for such a distinction, or with remarks on\nthe right or wrong use of the terms, I shall endeavour clearly to\ndetermine these conceptions, so far as is necessary for the purpose in\nthis Critique.\nWe may, with propriety, say of a straight line, that it may be produced\nto infinity. In this case the distinction between a progressus in\ninfinitum and a progressus in indefinitum is a mere piece of subtlety.\nFor, although when we say, \u201cProduce a straight line,\u201d it is more\ncorrect to say in indefinitum than in infinitum; because the former\nmeans, \u201cProduce it as far as you please,\u201d the second, \u201cYou must not\ncease to produce it\u201d; the expression in infinitum is, when we are\nspeaking of the power to do it, perfectly correct, for we can always\nmake it longer if we please\u2014on to infinity. And this remark holds good\nin all cases, when we speak of a progressus, that is, an advancement\nfrom the condition to the conditioned; this possible advancement always\nproceeds to infinity. We may proceed from a given pair in the\ndescending line of generation from father to son, and cogitate a\nnever-ending line of descendants from it. For in such a case reason\ndoes not demand absolute totality in the series, because it does not\npresuppose it as a condition and as given (datum), but merely as\nconditioned, and as capable of being given (dabile).\nVery different is the case with the problem: \u201cHow far the regress,\nwhich ascends from the given conditioned to the conditions, must\nextend\u201d; whether I can say: \u201cIt is a regress in infinitum,\u201d or only \u201cin\nindefinitum\u201d; and whether, for example, setting out from the human\nbeings at present alive in the world, I may ascend in the series of\ntheir ancestors, in infinitum\u2014or whether all that can be said is, that\nso far as I have proceeded, I have discovered no empirical ground for\nconsidering the series limited, so that I am justified, and indeed,\ncompelled to search for ancestors still further back, although I am not\nobliged by the idea of reason to presuppose them.\nMy answer to this question is: \u201cIf the series is given in empirical\nintuition as a whole, the regress in the series of its internal\nconditions proceeds in infinitum; but, if only one member of the series\nis given, from which the regress is to proceed to absolute totality,\nthe regress is possible only in indefinitum.\u201d For example, the division\nof a portion of matter given within certain limits\u2014of a body, that\nis\u2014proceeds in infinitum. For, as the condition of this whole is its\npart, and the condition of the part a part of the part, and so on, and\nas in this regress of decomposition an unconditioned indivisible member\nof the series of conditions is not to be found; there are no reasons or\ngrounds in experience for stopping in the division, but, on the\ncontrary, the more remote members of the division are actually and\nempirically given prior to this division. That is to say, the division\nproceeds to infinity. On the other hand, the series of ancestors of any\ngiven human being is not given, in its absolute totality, in any\nexperience, and yet the regress proceeds from every genealogical member\nof this series to one still higher, and does not meet with any\nempirical limit presenting an absolutely unconditioned member of the\nseries. But as the members of such a series are not contained in the\nempirical intuition of the whole, prior to the regress, this regress\ndoes not proceed to infinity, but only in indefinitum, that is, we are\ncalled upon to discover other and higher members, which are themselves\nalways conditioned.\nIn neither case\u2014the regressus in infinitum, nor the regressus\nin indefinitum, is the series of conditions to be considered as\nactually infinite in the object itself. This might be true of things\nin themselves, but it cannot be asserted of phenomena, which, as\nconditions of each other, are only given in the empirical regress\nitself. Hence, the question no longer is, \u201cWhat is the quantity of\nthis series of conditions in itself\u2014is it finite or infinite?\u201d for\nit is nothing in itself; but, \u201cHow is the empirical regress to be\ncommenced, and how far ought we to proceed with it?\u201d And here a signal\ndistinction in the application of this rule becomes apparent. If the\nwhole is given empirically, it is possible to recede in the series of\nits internal conditions to infinity. But if the whole is not given, and\ncan only be given by and through the empirical regress, I can only say:\n\u201cIt is possible to infinity, to proceed to still higher conditions in\nthe series.\u201d In the first case, I am justified in asserting that more\nmembers are empirically given in the object than I attain to in the\nregress (of decomposition). In the second case, I am justified only\nin saying, that I can always proceed further in the regress, because\nno member of the series is given as absolutely conditioned, and thus\na higher member is possible, and an inquiry with regard to it is\nnecessary. In the one case it is necessary to find other members of the\nseries, in the other it is necessary to inquire for others, inasmuch as\nexperience presents no absolute limitation of the regress. For, either\nyou do not possess a perception which absolutely limits your empirical\nregress, and in this case the regress cannot be regarded as complete;\nor, you do possess such a limitative perception, in which case it is\nnot a part of your series (for that which limits must be distinct from\nthat which is limited by it), and it is incumbent on you to continue\nyour regress up to this condition, and so on.\nThese remarks will be placed in their proper light by their application\nin the following section.\nSection IX. Of the Empirical Use of the Regulative Principle of Reason\nwith regard to the Cosmological Ideas\nWe have shown that no transcendental use can be made either of the\nconceptions of reason or of understanding. We have shown, likewise,\nthat the demand of absolute totality in the series of conditions in the\nworld of sense arises from a transcendental employment of reason,\nresting on the opinion that phenomena are to be regarded as things in\nthemselves. It follows that we are not required to answer the question\nrespecting the absolute quantity of a series\u2014whether it is in itself\nlimited or unlimited. We are only called upon to determine how far we\nmust proceed in the empirical regress from condition to condition, in\norder to discover, in conformity with the rule of reason, a full and\ncorrect answer to the questions proposed by reason itself.\nThis principle of reason is hence valid only as a rule for the\nextension of a possible experience\u2014its invalidity as a principle\nconstitutive of phenomena in themselves having been sufficiently\ndemonstrated. And thus, too, the antinomial conflict of reason with\nitself is completely put an end to; inasmuch as we have not only\npresented a critical solution of the fallacy lurking in the opposite\nstatements of reason, but have shown the true meaning of the ideas\nwhich gave rise to these statements. The dialectical principle of\nreason has, therefore, been changed into a doctrinal principle. But in\nfact, if this principle, in the subjective signification which we have\nshown to be its only true sense, may be guaranteed as a principle of\nthe unceasing extension of the employment of our understanding, its\ninfluence and value are just as great as if it were an axiom for the \u00e0\npriori determination of objects. For such an axiom could not exert a\nstronger influence on the extension and rectification of our knowledge,\notherwise than by procuring for the principles of the understanding the\nmost widely expanded employment in the field of experience.\nI. Solution of the Cosmological Idea of the Totality of the Composition\nof Phenomena in the Universe\nHere, as well as in the case of the other cosmological problems, the\nground of the regulative principle of reason is the proposition that in\nour empirical regress no experience of an absolute limit, and\nconsequently no experience of a condition, which is itself absolutely\nunconditioned, is discoverable. And the truth of this proposition\nitself rests upon the consideration that such an experience must\nrepresent to us phenomena as limited by nothing or the mere void, on\nwhich our continued regress by means of perception must abut\u2014which is\nimpossible.\nNow this proposition, which declares that every condition attained in\nthe empirical regress must itself be considered empirically\nconditioned, contains the rule in terminis, which requires me, to\nwhatever extent I may have proceeded in the ascending series, always to\nlook for some higher member in the series\u2014whether this member is to\nbecome known to me through experience, or not.\nNothing further is necessary, then, for the solution of the first\ncosmological problem, than to decide, whether, in the regress to the\nunconditioned quantity of the universe (as regards space and time),\nthis never limited ascent ought to be called a regressus in infinitum\nor indefinitum.\nThe general representation which we form in our minds of the series of\nall past states or conditions of the world, or of all the things which\nat present exist in it, is itself nothing more than a possible\nempirical regress, which is cogitated\u2014although in an undetermined\nmanner\u2014in the mind, and which gives rise to the conception of a series\nof conditions for a given object.[60] Now I have a conception of the\nuniverse, but not an intuition\u2014that is, not an intuition of it as a\nwhole. Thus I cannot infer the magnitude of the regress from the\nquantity or magnitude of the world, and determine the former by means\nof the latter; on the contrary, I must first of all form a conception\nof the quantity or magnitude of the world from the magnitude of the\nempirical regress. But of this regress I know nothing more than that I\nought to proceed from every given member of the series of conditions to\none still higher. But the quantity of the universe is not thereby\ndetermined, and we cannot affirm that this regress proceeds in\ninfinitum. Such an affirmation would anticipate the members of the\nseries which have not yet been reached, and represent the number of\nthem as beyond the grasp of any empirical synthesis; it would\nconsequently determine the cosmical quantity prior to the regress\n(although only in a negative manner)\u2014which is impossible. For the world\nis not given in its totality in any intuition: consequently, its\nquantity cannot be given prior to the regress. It follows that we are\nunable to make any declaration respecting the cosmical quantity in\nitself\u2014not even that the regress in it is a regress in infinitum; we\nmust only endeavour to attain to a conception of the quantity of the\nuniverse, in conformity with the rule which determines the empirical\nregress in it. But this rule merely requires us never to admit an\nabsolute limit to our series\u2014how far soever we may have proceeded in\nit, but always, on the contrary, to subordinate every phenomenon to\nsome other as its condition, and consequently to proceed to this higher\nphenomenon. Such a regress is, therefore, the regressus in indefinitum,\nwhich, as not determining a quantity in the object, is clearly\ndistinguishable from the regressus in infinitum.\n[60] The cosmical series can neither be greater nor smaller than the\npossible empirical regress, upon which its conception is based. And as\nthis regress cannot be a determinate infinite regress, still less a\ndeterminate finite (absolutely limited), it is evident that we cannot\nregard the world as either finite or infinite, because the regress,\nwhich gives us the representation of the world, is neither finite nor\ninfinite.\nIt follows from what we have said that we are not justified in\ndeclaring the world to be infinite in space, or as regards past time.\nFor this conception of an infinite given quantity is empirical; but we\ncannot apply the conception of an infinite quantity to the world as an\nobject of the senses. I cannot say, \u201cThe regress from a given\nperception to everything limited either in space or time, proceeds in\ninfinitum,\u201d for this presupposes an infinite cosmical quantity; neither\ncan I say, \u201cIt is finite,\u201d for an absolute limit is likewise impossible\nin experience. It follows that I am not entitled to make any assertion\nat all respecting the whole object of experience\u2014the world of sense; I\nmust limit my declarations to the rule according to which experience or\nempirical knowledge is to be attained.\nTo the question, therefore, respecting the cosmical quantity, the first\nand negative answer is: \u201cThe world has no beginning in time, and no\nabsolute limit in space.\u201d\nFor, in the contrary case, it would be limited by a void time on the\none hand, and by a void space on the other. Now, since the world, as a\nphenomenon, cannot be thus limited in itself for a phenomenon is not a\nthing in itself; it must be possible for us to have a perception of\nthis limitation by a void time and a void space. But such a\nperception\u2014such an experience is impossible; because it has no content.\nConsequently, an absolute cosmical limit is empirically, and therefore\nabsolutely, impossible.[61]\n[61] The reader will remark that the proof presented above is very\ndifferent from the dogmatical demonstration given in the antithesis of\nthe first antinomy. In that demonstration, it was taken for granted\nthat the world is a thing in itself\u2014given in its totality prior to all\nregress, and a determined position in space and time was denied to\nit\u2014if it was not considered as occupying all time and all space. Hence\nour conclusion differed from that given above; for we inferred in the\nantithesis the actual infinity of the world.\nFrom this follows the affirmative answer: \u201cThe regress in the series of\nphenomena\u2014as a determination of the cosmical quantity, proceeds in\nindefinitum.\u201d This is equivalent to saying: \u201cThe world of sense has no\nabsolute quantity, but the empirical regress (through which alone the\nworld of sense is presented to us on the side of its conditions) rests\nupon a rule, which requires it to proceed from every member of the\nseries, as conditioned, to one still more remote (whether through\npersonal experience, or by means of history, or the chain of cause and\neffect), and not to cease at any point in this extension of the\npossible empirical employment of the understanding.\u201d And this is the\nproper and only use which reason can make of its principles.\nThe above rule does not prescribe an unceasing regress in one kind of\nphenomena. It does not, for example, forbid us, in our ascent from an\nindividual human being through the line of his ancestors, to expect\nthat we shall discover at some point of the regress a primeval pair, or\nto admit, in the series of heavenly bodies, a sun at the farthest\npossible distance from some centre. All that it demands is a perpetual\nprogress from phenomena to phenomena, even although an actual\nperception is not presented by them (as in the case of our perceptions\nbeing so weak as that we are unable to become conscious of them), since\nthey, nevertheless, belong to possible experience.\nEvery beginning is in time, and all limits to extension are in space.\nBut space and time are in the world of sense. Consequently phenomena in\nthe world are conditionally limited, but the world itself is not\nlimited, either conditionally or unconditionally.\nFor this reason, and because neither the world nor the cosmical series\nof conditions to a given conditioned can be completely given, our\nconception of the cosmical quantity is given only in and through the\nregress and not prior to it\u2014in a collective intuition. But the regress\nitself is really nothing more than the determining of the cosmical\nquantity, and cannot therefore give us any determined conception of\nit\u2014still less a conception of a quantity which is, in relation to a\ncertain standard, infinite. The regress does not, therefore, proceed to\ninfinity (an infinity given), but only to an indefinite extent, for or\nthe of presenting to us a quantity\u2014realized only in and through the\nregress itself.\nII. Solution of the Cosmological Idea of the Totality of the Division\nof a Whole given in Intuition\nWhen I divide a whole which is given in intuition, I proceed from a\nconditioned to its conditions. The division of the parts of the whole\n(subdivisio or decompositio) is a regress in the series of these\nconditions. The absolute totality of this series would be actually\nattained and given to the mind, if the regress could arrive at simple\nparts. But if all the parts in a continuous decomposition are\nthemselves divisible, the division, that is to say, the regress,\nproceeds from the conditioned to its conditions in infinitum; because\nthe conditions (the parts) are themselves contained in the conditioned,\nand, as the latter is given in a limited intuition, the former are all\ngiven along with it. This regress cannot, therefore, be called a\nregressus in indefinitum, as happened in the case of the preceding\ncosmological idea, the regress in which proceeded from the conditioned\nto the conditions not given contemporaneously and along with it, but\ndiscoverable only through the empirical regress. We are not, however,\nentitled to affirm of a whole of this kind, which is divisible in\ninfinitum, that it consists of an infinite number of parts. For,\nalthough all the parts are contained in the intuition of the whole, the\nwhole division is not contained therein. The division is contained only\nin the progressing decomposition\u2014in the regress itself, which is the\ncondition of the possibility and actuality of the series. Now, as this\nregress is infinite, all the members (parts) to which it attains must\nbe contained in the given whole as an aggregate. But the complete\nseries of division is not contained therein. For this series, being\ninfinite in succession and always incomplete, cannot represent an\ninfinite number of members, and still less a composition of these\nmembers into a whole.\nTo apply this remark to space. Every limited part of space presented to\nintuition is a whole, the parts of which are always spaces\u2014to whatever\nextent subdivided. Every limited space is hence divisible to infinity.\nLet us again apply the remark to an external phenomenon enclosed in\nlimits, that is, a body. The divisibility of a body rests upon the\ndivisibility of space, which is the condition of the possibility of the\nbody as an extended whole. A body is consequently divisible to\ninfinity, though it does not, for that reason, consist of an infinite\nnumber of parts.\nIt certainly seems that, as a body must be cogitated as substance in\nspace, the law of divisibility would not be applicable to it as\nsubstance. For we may and ought to grant, in the case of space, that\ndivision or decomposition, to any extent, never can utterly annihilate\ncomposition (that is to say, the smallest part of space must still\nconsist of spaces); otherwise space would entirely cease to exist\u2014which\nis impossible. But, the assertion on the other hand that when all\ncomposition in matter is annihilated in thought, nothing remains, does\nnot seem to harmonize with the conception of substance, which must be\nproperly the subject of all composition and must remain, even after the\nconjunction of its attributes in space\u2014which constituted a body\u2014is\nannihilated in thought. But this is not the case with substance in the\nphenomenal world, which is not a thing in itself cogitated by the pure\ncategory. Phenomenal substance is not an absolute subject; it is merely\na permanent sensuous image, and nothing more than an intuition, in\nwhich the unconditioned is not to be found.\nBut, although this rule of progress to infinity is legitimate and\napplicable to the subdivision of a phenomenon, as a mere occupation or\nfilling of space, it is not applicable to a whole consisting of a\nnumber of distinct parts and constituting a quantum discretum\u2014that is\nto say, an organized body. It cannot be admitted that every part in an\norganized whole is itself organized, and that, in analysing it to\ninfinity, we must always meet with organized parts; although we may\nallow that the parts of the matter which we decompose in infinitum, may\nbe organized. For the infinity of the division of a phenomenon in space\nrests altogether on the fact that the divisibility of a phenomenon is\ngiven only in and through this infinity, that is, an undetermined\nnumber of parts is given, while the parts themselves are given and\ndetermined only in and through the subdivision; in a word, the infinity\nof the division necessarily presupposes that the whole is not already\ndivided in se. Hence our division determines a number of parts in the\nwhole\u2014a number which extends just as far as the actual regress in the\ndivision; while, on the other hand, the very notion of a body organized\nto infinity represents the whole as already and in itself divided. We\nexpect, therefore, to find in it a determinate, but at the same time,\ninfinite, number of parts\u2014which is self-contradictory. For we should\nthus have a whole containing a series of members which could not be\ncompleted in any regress\u2014which is infinite, and at the same time\ncomplete in an organized composite. Infinite divisibility is applicable\nonly to a quantum continuum, and is based entirely on the infinite\ndivisibility of space, But in a quantum discretum the multitude of\nparts or units is always determined, and hence always equal to some\nnumber. To what extent a body may be organized, experience alone can\ninform us; and although, so far as our experience of this or that body\nhas extended, we may not have discovered any inorganic part, such parts\nmust exist in possible experience. But how far the transcendental\ndivision of a phenomenon must extend, we cannot know from experience\u2014it\nis a question which experience cannot answer; it is answered only by\nthe principle of reason which forbids us to consider the empirical\nregress, in the analysis of extended body, as ever absolutely complete.\nConcluding Remark on the Solution of the Transcendental Mathematical\nIdeas\u2014and Introductory to the Solution of the Dynamical Ideas.\nWe presented the antinomy of pure reason in a tabular form, and we\nendeavoured to show the ground of this self-contradiction on the part\nof reason, and the only means of bringing it to a conclusion\u2014namely, by\ndeclaring both contradictory statements to be false. We represented in\nthese antinomies the conditions of phenomena as belonging to the\nconditioned according to relations of space and time\u2014which is the usual\nsupposition of the common understanding. In this respect, all\ndialectical representations of totality, in the series of conditions to\na given conditioned, were perfectly homogeneous. The condition was\nalways a member of the series along with the conditioned, and thus the\nhomogeneity of the whole series was assured. In this case the regress\ncould never be cogitated as complete; or, if this was the case, a\nmember really conditioned was falsely regarded as a primal member,\nconsequently as unconditioned. In such an antinomy, therefore, we did\nnot consider the object, that is, the conditioned, but the series of\nconditions belonging to the object, and the magnitude of that series.\nAnd thus arose the difficulty\u2014a difficulty not to be settled by any\ndecision regarding the claims of the two parties, but simply by cutting\nthe knot\u2014by declaring the series proposed by reason to be either too\nlong or too short for the understanding, which could in neither case\nmake its conceptions adequate with the ideas.\nBut we have overlooked, up to this point, an essential difference\nexisting between the conceptions of the understanding which reason\nendeavours to raise to the rank of ideas\u2014two of these indicating a\nmathematical, and two a dynamical synthesis of phenomena. Hitherto, it\nwas necessary to signalize this distinction; for, just as in our\ngeneral representation of all transcendental ideas, we considered them\nunder phenomenal conditions, so, in the two mathematical ideas, our\ndiscussion is concerned solely with an object in the world of\nphenomena. But as we are now about to proceed to the consideration of\nthe dynamical conceptions of the understanding, and their adequateness\nwith ideas, we must not lose sight of this distinction. We shall find\nthat it opens up to us an entirely new view of the conflict in which\nreason is involved. For, while in the first two antinomies, both\nparties were dismissed, on the ground of having advanced statements\nbased upon false hypothesis; in the present case the hope appears of\ndiscovering a hypothesis which may be consistent with the demands of\nreason, and, the judge completing the statement of the grounds of\nclaim, which both parties had left in an unsatisfactory state, the\nquestion may be settled on its own merits, not by dismissing the\nclaimants, but by a comparison of the arguments on both sides. If we\nconsider merely their extension, and whether they are adequate with\nideas, the series of conditions may be regarded as all homogeneous. But\nthe conception of the understanding which lies at the basis of these\nideas, contains either a synthesis of the homogeneous (presupposed in\nevery quantity\u2014in its composition as well as in its division) or of the\nheterogeneous, which is the case in the dynamical synthesis of cause\nand effect, as well as of the necessary and the contingent.\nThus it happens that in the mathematical series of phenomena no other\nthan a sensuous condition is admissible\u2014a condition which is itself a\nmember of the series; while the dynamical series of sensuous conditions\nadmits a heterogeneous condition, which is not a member of the series,\nbut, as purely intelligible, lies out of and beyond it. And thus reason\nis satisfied, and an unconditioned placed at the head of the series of\nphenomena, without introducing confusion into or discontinuing it,\ncontrary to the principles of the understanding.\nNow, from the fact that the dynamical ideas admit a condition of\nphenomena which does not form a part of the series of phenomena, arises\na result which we should not have expected from an antinomy. In former\ncases, the result was that both contradictory dialectical statements\nwere declared to be false. In the present case, we find the conditioned\nin the dynamical series connected with an empirically unconditioned,\nbut non-sensuous condition; and thus satisfaction is done to the\nunderstanding on the one hand and to the reason on the other.[62]\nWhile, moreover, the dialectical arguments for unconditioned totality\nin mere phenomena fall to the ground, both propositions of reason may\nbe shown to be true in their proper signification. This could not\nhappen in the case of the cosmological ideas which demanded a\nmathematically unconditioned unity; for no condition could be placed at\nthe head of the series of phenomena, except one which was itself a\nphenomenon and consequently a member of the series.\n[62] For the understanding cannot admit among phenomena a condition\nwhich is itself empirically unconditioned. But if it is possible to\ncogitate an intelligible condition\u2014one which is not a member of the\nseries of phenomena\u2014for a conditioned phenomenon, without breaking the\nseries of empirical conditions, such a condition may be admissible as\nempirically unconditioned, and the empirical regress continue regular,\nunceasing, and intact.\nIII. Solution of the Cosmological Idea of the Totality of the Deduction\nof Cosmical Events from their Causes\nThere are only two modes of causality cogitable\u2014the causality of nature\nor of freedom. The first is the conjunction of a particular state with\nanother preceding it in the world of sense, the former following the\nlatter by virtue of a law. Now, as the causality of phenomena is\nsubject to conditions of time, and the preceding state, if it had\nalways existed, could not have produced an effect which would make its\nfirst appearance at a particular time, the causality of a cause must\nitself be an effect\u2014must itself have begun to be, and therefore,\naccording to the principle of the understanding, itself requires a\ncause.\nWe must understand, on the contrary, by the term freedom, in the\ncosmological sense, a faculty of the spontaneous origination of a\nstate; the causality of which, therefore, is not subordinated to\nanother cause determining it in time. Freedom is in this sense a pure\ntranscendental idea, which, in the first place, contains no empirical\nelement; the object of which, in the second place, cannot be given or\ndetermined in any experience, because it is a universal law of the very\npossibility of experience, that everything which happens must have a\ncause, that consequently the causality of a cause, being itself\nsomething that has happened, must also have a cause. In this view of\nthe case, the whole field of experience, how far soever it may extend,\ncontains nothing that is not subject to the laws of nature. But, as we\ncannot by this means attain to an absolute totality of conditions in\nreference to the series of causes and effects, reason creates the idea\nof a spontaneity, which can begin to act of itself, and without any\nexternal cause determining it to action, according to the natural law\nof causality.\nIt is especially remarkable that the practical conception of freedom is\nbased upon the transcendental idea, and that the question of the\npossibility of the former is difficult only as it involves the\nconsideration of the truth of the latter. Freedom, in the practical\nsense, is the independence of the will of coercion by sensuous\nimpulses. A will is sensuous, in so far as it is pathologically\naffected (by sensuous impulses); it is termed animal (arbitrium\nbrutum), when it is pathologically necessitated. The human will is\ncertainly an arbitrium sensitivum, not brutum, but liberum; because\nsensuousness does not necessitate its action, a faculty existing in man\nof self-determination, independently of all sensuous coercion.\nIt is plain that, if all causality in the world of sense were\nnatural\u2014and natural only\u2014every event would be determined by another\naccording to necessary laws, and that, consequently, phenomena, in so\nfar as they determine the will, must necessitate every action as a\nnatural effect from themselves; and thus all practical freedom would\nfall to the ground with the transcendental idea. For the latter\npresupposes that although a certain thing has not happened, it ought to\nhave happened, and that, consequently, its phenomenal cause was not so\npowerful and determinative as to exclude the causality of our will\u2014a\ncausality capable of producing effects independently of and even in\nopposition to the power of natural causes, and capable, consequently,\nof spontaneously originating a series of events.\nHere, too, we find it to be the case, as we generally found in the\nself-contradictions and perplexities of a reason which strives to pass\nthe bounds of possible experience, that the problem is properly not\nphysiological, but transcendental. The question of the possibility of\nfreedom does indeed concern psychology; but, as it rests upon\ndialectical arguments of pure reason, its solution must engage the\nattention of transcendental philosophy. Before attempting this\nsolution, a task which transcendental philosophy cannot decline, it\nwill be advisable to make a remark with regard to its procedure in the\nsettlement of the question.\nIf phenomena were things in themselves, and time and space forms of the\nexistence of things, condition and conditioned would always be members\nof the same series; and thus would arise in the present case the\nantinomy common to all transcendental ideas\u2014that their series is either\ntoo great or too small for the understanding. The dynamical ideas,\nwhich we are about to discuss in this and the following section,\npossess the peculiarity of relating to an object, not considered as a\nquantity, but as an existence; and thus, in the discussion of the\npresent question, we may make abstraction of the quantity of the series\nof conditions, and consider merely the dynamical relation of the\ncondition to the conditioned. The question, then, suggests itself,\nwhether freedom is possible; and, if it is, whether it can consist with\nthe universality of the natural law of causality; and, consequently,\nwhether we enounce a proper disjunctive proposition when we say: \u201cEvery\neffect must have its origin either in nature or in freedom,\u201d or whether\nboth cannot exist together in the same event in different relations.\nThe principle of an unbroken connection between all events in the\nphenomenal world, in accordance with the unchangeable laws of nature,\nis a well-established principle of transcendental analytic which admits\nof no exception. The question, therefore, is: \u201cWhether an effect,\ndetermined according to the laws of nature, can at the same time be\nproduced by a free agent, or whether freedom and nature mutually\nexclude each other?\u201d And here, the common but fallacious hypothesis of\nthe absolute reality of phenomena manifests its injurious influence in\nembarrassing the procedure of reason. For if phenomena are things in\nthemselves, freedom is impossible. In this case, nature is the complete\nand all-sufficient cause of every event; and condition and conditioned,\ncause and effect are contained in the same series, and necessitated by\nthe same law. If, on the contrary, phenomena are held to be, as they\nare in fact, nothing more than mere representations, connected with\neach other in accordance with empirical laws, they must have a ground\nwhich is not phenomenal. But the causality of such an intelligible\ncause is not determined or determinable by phenomena; although its\neffects, as phenomena, must be determined by other phenomenal\nexistences. This cause and its causality exist therefore out of and\napart from the series of phenomena; while its effects do exist and are\ndiscoverable in the series of empirical conditions. Such an effect may\ntherefore be considered to be free in relation to its intelligible\ncause, and necessary in relation to the phenomena from which it is a\nnecessary consequence\u2014a distinction which, stated in this perfectly\ngeneral and abstract manner, must appear in the highest degree subtle\nand obscure. The sequel will explain. It is sufficient, at present, to\nremark that, as the complete and unbroken connection of phenomena is an\nunalterable law of nature, freedom is impossible\u2014on the supposition\nthat phenomena are absolutely real. Hence those philosophers who adhere\nto the common opinion on this subject can never succeed in reconciling\nthe ideas of nature and freedom.\n_Possibility of Freedom in Harmony with the Universal Law of Natural\nNecessity._\nThat element in a sensuous object which is not itself sensuous, I may\nbe allowed to term intelligible. If, accordingly, an object which must\nbe regarded as a sensuous phenomenon possesses a faculty which is not\nan object of sensuous intuition, but by means of which it is capable of\nbeing the cause of phenomena, the causality of an object or existence\nof this kind may be regarded from two different points of view. It may\nbe considered to be intelligible, as regards its action\u2014the action of a\nthing which is a thing in itself, and sensuous, as regards its\neffects\u2014the effects of a phenomenon belonging to the sensuous world. We\nshould accordingly, have to form both an empirical and an intellectual\nconception of the causality of such a faculty or power\u2014both, however,\nhaving reference to the same effect. This twofold manner of cogitating\na power residing in a sensuous object does not run counter to any of\nthe conceptions which we ought to form of the world of phenomena or of\na possible experience. Phenomena\u2014not being things in themselves\u2014must\nhave a transcendental object as a foundation, which determines them as\nmere representations; and there seems to be no reason why we should not\nascribe to this transcendental object, in addition to the property of\nself-phenomenization, a causality whose effects are to be met with in\nthe world of phenomena, although it is not itself a phenomenon. But\nevery effective cause must possess a character, that is to say, a law\nof its causality, without which it would cease to be a cause. In the\nabove case, then, every sensuous object would possess an empirical\ncharacter, which guaranteed that its actions, as phenomena, stand in\ncomplete and harmonious connection, conformably to unvarying natural\nlaws, with all other phenomena, and can be deduced from these, as\nconditions, and that they do thus, in connection with these, constitute\na series in the order of nature. This sensuous object must, in the\nsecond place, possess an intelligible character, which guarantees it to\nbe the cause of those actions, as phenomena, although it is not itself\na phenomenon nor subordinate to the conditions of the world of sense.\nThe former may be termed the character of the thing as a phenomenon,\nthe latter the character of the thing as a thing in itself.\nNow this active subject would, in its character of intelligible\nsubject, be subordinate to no conditions of time, for time is only a\ncondition of phenomena, and not of things in themselves. No action\nwould begin or cease to be in this subject; it would consequently be\nfree from the law of all determination of time\u2014the law of change,\nnamely, that everything which happens must have a cause in the\nphenomena of a preceding state. In one word, the causality of the\nsubject, in so far as it is intelligible, would not form part of the\nseries of empirical conditions which determine and necessitate an event\nin the world of sense. Again, this intelligible character of a thing\ncannot be immediately cognized, because we can perceive nothing but\nphenomena, but it must be capable of being cogitated in harmony with\nthe empirical character; for we always find ourselves compelled to\nplace, in thought, a transcendental object at the basis of phenomena\nalthough we can never know what this object is in itself.\nIn virtue of its empirical character, this subject would at the same\ntime be subordinate to all the empirical laws of causality, and, as a\nphenomenon and member of the sensuous world, its effects would have to\nbe accounted for by a reference to preceding phenomena. Eternal\nphenomena must be capable of influencing it; and its actions, in\naccordance with natural laws, must explain to us how its empirical\ncharacter, that is, the law of its causality, is to be cognized in and\nby means of experience. In a word, all requisites for a complete and\nnecessary determination of these actions must be presented to us by\nexperience.\nIn virtue of its intelligible character, on the other hand (although we\npossess only a general conception of this character), the subject must\nbe regarded as free from all sensuous influences, and from all\nphenomenal determination. Moreover, as nothing happens in this\nsubject\u2014for it is a noumenon, and there does not consequently exist in\nit any change, demanding the dynamical determination of time, and for\nthe same reason no connection with phenomena as causes\u2014this active\nexistence must in its actions be free from and independent of natural\nnecessity, for this necessity exists only in the world of phenomena. It\nwould be quite correct to say that it originates or begins its effects\nin the world of sense from itself, although the action productive of\nthese effects does not begin in itself. We should not be in this case\naffirming that these sensuous effects began to exist of themselves,\nbecause they are always determined by prior empirical conditions\u2014by\nvirtue of the empirical character, which is the phenomenon of the\nintelligible character\u2014and are possible only as constituting a\ncontinuation of the series of natural causes. And thus nature and\nfreedom, each in the complete and absolute signification of these\nterms, can exist, without contradiction or disagreement, in the same\naction.\n_Exposition of the Cosmological Idea of Freedom in Harmony with the\nUniversal Law of Natural Necessity._\nI have thought it advisable to lay before the reader at first merely a\nsketch of the solution of this transcendental problem, in order to\nenable him to form with greater ease a clear conception of the course\nwhich reason must adopt in the solution. I shall now proceed to exhibit\nthe several momenta of this solution, and to consider them in their\norder.\nThe natural law that everything which happens must have a cause, that\nthe causality of this cause, that is, the action of the cause (which\ncannot always have existed, but must be itself an event, for it\nprecedes in time some effect which it has originated), must have itself\na phenomenal cause, by which it is determined and, and, consequently,\nall events are empirically determined in an order of nature\u2014this law, I\nsay, which lies at the foundation of the possibility of experience, and\nof a connected system of phenomena or nature is a law of the\nunderstanding, from which no departure, and to which no exception, can\nbe admitted. For to except even a single phenomenon from its operation\nis to exclude it from the sphere of possible experience and thus to\nadmit it to be a mere fiction of thought or phantom of the brain.\nThus we are obliged to acknowledge the existence of a chain of causes,\nin which, however, absolute totality cannot be found. But we need not\ndetain ourselves with this question, for it has already been\nsufficiently answered in our discussion of the antinomies into which\nreason falls, when it attempts to reach the unconditioned in the series\nof phenomena. If we permit ourselves to be deceived by the illusion of\ntranscendental idealism, we shall find that neither nature nor freedom\nexists. Now the question is: \u201cWhether, admitting the existence of\nnatural necessity in the world of phenomena, it is possible to consider\nan effect as at the same time an effect of nature and an effect of\nfreedom\u2014or, whether these two modes of causality are contradictory and\nincompatible?\u201d\nNo phenomenal cause can absolutely and of itself begin a series. Every\naction, in so far as it is productive of an event, is itself an event\nor occurrence, and presupposes another preceding state, in which its\ncause existed. Thus everything that happens is but a continuation of a\nseries, and an absolute beginning is impossible in the sensuous world.\nThe actions of natural causes are, accordingly, themselves effects, and\npresuppose causes preceding them in time. A primal action which forms\nan absolute beginning, is beyond the causal power of phenomena.\nNow, is it absolutely necessary that, granting that all effects are\nphenomena, the causality of the cause of these effects must also be a\nphenomenon and belong to the empirical world? Is it not rather possible\nthat, although every effect in the phenomenal world must be connected\nwith an empirical cause, according to the universal law of nature, this\nempirical causality may be itself the effect of a non-empirical and\nintelligible causality\u2014its connection with natural causes remaining\nnevertheless intact? Such a causality would be considered, in reference\nto phenomena, as the primal action of a cause, which is in so far,\ntherefore, not phenomenal, but, by reason of this faculty or power,\nintelligible; although it must, at the same time, as a link in the\nchain of nature, be regarded as belonging to the sensuous world.\nA belief in the reciprocal causality of phenomena is necessary, if we\nare required to look for and to present the natural conditions of\nnatural events, that is to say, their causes. This being admitted as\nunexceptionably valid, the requirements of the understanding, which\nrecognizes nothing but nature in the region of phenomena, are\nsatisfied, and our physical explanations of physical phenomena may\nproceed in their regular course, without hindrance and without\nopposition. But it is no stumbling-block in the way, even assuming the\nidea to be a pure fiction, to admit that there are some natural causes\nin the possession of a faculty which is not empirical, but\nintelligible, inasmuch as it is not determined to action by empirical\nconditions, but purely and solely upon grounds brought forward by the\nunderstanding\u2014this action being still, when the cause is phenomenized,\nin perfect accordance with the laws of empirical causality. Thus the\nacting subject, as a causal phenomenon, would continue to preserve a\ncomplete connection with nature and natural conditions; and the\nphenomenon only of the subject (with all its phenomenal causality)\nwould contain certain conditions, which, if we ascend from the\nempirical to the transcendental object, must necessarily be regarded as\nintelligible. For, if we attend, in our inquiries with regard to causes\nin the world of phenomena, to the directions of nature alone, we need\nnot trouble ourselves about the relation in which the transcendental\nsubject, which is completely unknown to us, stands to these phenomena\nand their connection in nature. The intelligible ground of phenomena in\nthis subject does not concern empirical questions. It has to do only\nwith pure thought; and, although the effects of this thought and action\nof the pure understanding are discoverable in phenomena, these\nphenomena must nevertheless be capable of a full and complete\nexplanation, upon purely physical grounds and in accordance with\nnatural laws. And in this case we attend solely to their empirical and\nomit all consideration of their intelligible character (which is the\ntranscendental cause of the former) as completely unknown, except in so\nfar as it is exhibited by the latter as its empirical symbol. Now let\nus apply this to experience. Man is a phenomenon of the sensuous world\nand, at the same time, therefore, a natural cause, the causality of\nwhich must be regulated by empirical laws. As such, he must possess an\nempirical character, like all other natural phenomena. We remark this\nempirical character in his actions, which reveal the presence of\ncertain powers and faculties. If we consider inanimate or merely animal\nnature, we can discover no reason for ascribing to ourselves any other\nthan a faculty which is determined in a purely sensuous manner. But\nman, to whom nature reveals herself only through sense, cognizes\nhimself not only by his senses, but also through pure apperception; and\nthis in actions and internal determinations, which he cannot regard as\nsensuous impressions. He is thus to himself, on the one hand, a\nphenomenon, but on the other hand, in respect of certain faculties, a\npurely intelligible object\u2014intelligible, because its action cannot be\nascribed to sensuous receptivity. These faculties are understanding and\nreason. The latter, especially, is in a peculiar manner distinct from\nall empirically-conditioned faculties, for it employs ideas alone in\nthe consideration of its objects, and by means of these determines the\nunderstanding, which then proceeds to make an empirical use of its own\nconceptions, which, like the ideas of reason, are pure and\nnon-empirical.\nThat reason possesses the faculty of causality, or that at least we are\ncompelled so to represent it, is evident from the imperatives, which in\nthe sphere of the practical we impose on many of our executive powers.\nThe words I ought express a species of necessity, and imply a\nconnection with grounds which nature does not and cannot present to the\nmind of man. Understanding knows nothing in nature but that which is,\nor has been, or will be. It would be absurd to say that anything in\nnature ought to be other than it is in the relations of time in which\nit stands; indeed, the ought, when we consider merely the course of\nnature, has neither application nor meaning. The question, \u201cWhat ought\nto happen in the sphere of nature?\u201d is just as absurd as the question,\n\u201cWhat ought to be the properties of a circle?\u201d All that we are entitled\nto ask is, \u201cWhat takes place in nature?\u201d or, in the latter case, \u201cWhat\nare the properties of a circle?\u201d\nBut the idea of an ought or of duty indicates a possible action, the\nground of which is a pure conception; while the ground of a merely\nnatural action is, on the contrary, always a phenomenon. This action\nmust certainly be possible under physical conditions, if it is\nprescribed by the moral imperative ought; but these physical or natural\nconditions do not concern the determination of the will itself, they\nrelate to its effects alone, and the consequences of the effect in the\nworld of phenomena. Whatever number of motives nature may present to my\nwill, whatever sensuous impulses\u2014the moral ought it is beyond their\npower to produce. They may produce a volition, which, so far from being\nnecessary, is always conditioned\u2014a volition to which the ought\nenunciated by reason, sets an aim and a standard, gives permission or\nprohibition. Be the object what it may, purely sensuous\u2014as pleasure, or\npresented by pure reason\u2014as good, reason will not yield to grounds\nwhich have an empirical origin. Reason will not follow the order of\nthings presented by experience, but, with perfect spontaneity,\nrearranges them according to ideas, with which it compels empirical\nconditions to agree. It declares, in the name of these ideas, certain\nactions to be necessary which nevertheless have not taken place and\nwhich perhaps never will take place; and yet presupposes that it\npossesses the faculty of causality in relation to these actions. For,\nin the absence of this supposition, it could not expect its ideas to\nproduce certain effects in the world of experience.\nNow, let us stop here and admit it to be at least possible that reason\ndoes stand in a really causal relation to phenomena. In this case it\nmust\u2014pure reason as it is\u2014exhibit an empirical character. For every\ncause supposes a rule, according to which certain phenomena follow as\neffects from the cause, and every rule requires uniformity in these\neffects; and this is the proper ground of the conception of a cause\u2014as\na faculty or power. Now this conception (of a cause) may be termed the\nempirical character of reason; and this character is a permanent one,\nwhile the effects produced appear, in conformity with the various\nconditions which accompany and partly limit them, in various forms.\nThus the volition of every man has an empirical character, which is\nnothing more than the causality of his reason, in so far as its effects\nin the phenomenal world manifest the presence of a rule, according to\nwhich we are enabled to examine, in their several kinds and degrees,\nthe actions of this causality and the rational grounds for these\nactions, and in this way to decide upon the subjective principles of\nthe volition. Now we learn what this empirical character is only from\nphenomenal effects, and from the rule of these which is presented by\nexperience; and for this reason all the actions of man in the world of\nphenomena are determined by his empirical character, and the\nco-operative causes of nature. If, then, we could investigate all the\nphenomena of human volition to their lowest foundation in the mind,\nthere would be no action which we could not anticipate with certainty,\nand recognize to be absolutely necessary from its preceding conditions.\nSo far as relates to this empirical character, therefore, there can be\nno freedom; and it is only in the light of this character that we can\nconsider the human will, when we confine ourselves to simple\nobservation and, as is the case in anthropology, institute a\nphysiological investigation of the motive causes of human actions.\nBut when we consider the same actions in relation to reason\u2014not for the\npurpose of explaining their origin, that is, in relation to speculative\nreason, but to practical reason, as the producing cause of these\nactions\u2014we shall discover a rule and an order very different from those\nof nature and experience. For the declaration of this mental faculty\nmay be that what has and could not but take place in the course of\nnature, ought not to have taken place. Sometimes, too, we discover, or\nbelieve that we discover, that the ideas of reason did actually stand\nin a causal relation to certain actions of man; and that these actions\nhave taken place because they were determined, not by empirical causes,\nbut by the act of the will upon grounds of reason.\nNow, granting that reason stands in a causal relation to phenomena; can\nan action of reason be called free, when we know that, sensuously, in\nits empirical character, it is completely determined and absolutely\nnecessary? But this empirical character is itself determined by the\nintelligible character. The latter we cannot cognize; we can only\nindicate it by means of phenomena, which enable us to have an immediate\ncognition only of the empirical character.[63] An action, then, in so\nfar as it is to be ascribed to an intelligible cause, does not result\nfrom it in accordance with empirical laws. That is to say, not the\nconditions of pure reason, but only their effects in the internal\nsense, precede the act. Pure reason, as a purely intelligible faculty,\nis not subject to the conditions of time. The causality of reason in\nits intelligible character does not begin to be; it does not make its\nappearance at a certain time, for the purpose of producing an effect.\nIf this were not the case, the causality of reason would be subservient\nto the natural law of phenomena, which determines them according to\ntime, and as a series of causes and effects in time; it would\nconsequently cease to be freedom and become a part of nature. We are\ntherefore justified in saying: \u201cIf reason stands in a causal relation\nto phenomena, it is a faculty which originates the sensuous condition\nof an empirical series of effects.\u201d For the condition, which resides in\nthe reason, is non-sensuous, and therefore cannot be originated, or\nbegin to be. And thus we find\u2014what we could not discover in any\nempirical series\u2014a condition of a successive series of events itself\nempirically unconditioned. For, in the present case, the condition\nstands out of and beyond the series of phenomena\u2014it is intelligible,\nand it consequently cannot be subjected to any sensuous condition, or\nto any time-determination by a preceding cause.\n[63] The real morality of actions\u2014their merit or demerit, and even\nthat of our own conduct, is completely unknown to us. Our estimates\ncan relate only to their empirical character. How much is the result\nof the action of free will, how much is to be ascribed to nature and\nto blameless error, or to a happy constitution of temperament (merito\nfortunae), no one can discover, nor, for this reason, determine with\nperfect justice.\nBut, in another respect, the same cause belongs also to the series of\nphenomena. Man is himself a phenomenon. His will has an empirical\ncharacter, which is the empirical cause of all his actions. There is no\ncondition\u2014determining man and his volition in conformity with this\ncharacter\u2014which does not itself form part of the series of effects in\nnature, and is subject to their law\u2014the law according to which an\nempirically undetermined cause of an event in time cannot exist. For\nthis reason no given action can have an absolute and spontaneous\norigination, all actions being phenomena, and belonging to the world of\nexperience. But it cannot be said of reason, that the state in which it\ndetermines the will is always preceded by some other state determining\nit. For reason is not a phenomenon, and therefore not subject to\nsensuous conditions; and, consequently, even in relation to its\ncausality, the sequence or conditions of time do not influence reason,\nnor can the dynamical law of nature, which determines the sequence of\ntime according to certain rules, be applied to it.\nReason is consequently the permanent condition of all actions of the\nhuman will. Each of these is determined in the empirical character of\nthe man, even before it has taken place. The intelligible character, of\nwhich the former is but the sensuous schema, knows no before or after;\nand every action, irrespective of the time-relation in which it stands\nwith other phenomena, is the immediate effect of the intelligible\ncharacter of pure reason, which, consequently, enjoys freedom of\naction, and is not dynamically determined either by internal or\nexternal preceding conditions. This freedom must not be described, in a\nmerely negative manner, as independence of empirical conditions, for in\nthis case the faculty of reason would cease to be a cause of phenomena;\nbut it must be regarded, positively, as a faculty which can\nspontaneously originate a series of events. At the same time, it must\nnot be supposed that any beginning can take place in reason; on the\ncontrary, reason, as the unconditioned condition of all action of the\nwill, admits of no time-conditions, although its effect does really\nbegin in a series of phenomena\u2014a beginning which is not, however,\nabsolutely primal.\nI shall illustrate this regulative principle of reason by an example,\nfrom its employment in the world of experience; proved it cannot be by\nany amount of experience, or by any number of facts, for such arguments\ncannot establish the truth of transcendental propositions. Let us take\na voluntary action\u2014for example, a falsehood\u2014by means of which a man has\nintroduced a certain degree of confusion into the social life of\nhumanity, which is judged according to the motives from which it\noriginated, and the blame of which and of the evil consequences arising\nfrom it, is imputed to the offender. We at first proceed to examine the\nempirical character of the offence, and for this purpose we endeavour\nto penetrate to the sources of that character, such as a defective\neducation, bad company, a shameless and wicked disposition, frivolity,\nand want of reflection\u2014not forgetting also the occasioning causes which\nprevailed at the moment of the transgression. In this the procedure is\nexactly the same as that pursued in the investigation of the series of\ncauses which determine a given physical effect. Now, although we\nbelieve the action to have been determined by all these circumstances,\nwe do not the less blame the offender. We do not blame him for his\nunhappy disposition, nor for the circumstances which influenced him,\nnay, not even for his former course of life; for we presuppose that all\nthese considerations may be set aside, that the series of preceding\nconditions may be regarded as having never existed, and that the action\nmay be considered as completely unconditioned in relation to any state\npreceding, just as if the agent commenced with it an entirely new\nseries of effects. Our blame of the offender is grounded upon a law of\nreason, which requires us to regard this faculty as a cause, which\ncould have and ought to have otherwise determined the behaviour of the\nculprit, independently of all empirical conditions. This causality of\nreason we do not regard as a co-operating agency, but as complete in\nitself. It matters not whether the sensuous impulses favoured or\nopposed the action of this causality, the offence is estimated\naccording to its intelligible character\u2014the offender is decidedly\nworthy of blame, the moment he utters a falsehood. It follows that we\nregard reason, in spite of the empirical conditions of the act, as\ncompletely free, and therefore, as in the present case,\nculpable.\nThe above judgement is complete evidence that we are accustomed to\nthink that reason is not affected by sensuous conditions, that in it no\nchange takes place\u2014although its phenomena, in other words, the mode in\nwhich it appears in its effects, are subject to change\u2014that in it no\npreceding state determines the following, and, consequently, that it\ndoes not form a member of the series of sensuous conditions which\nnecessitate phenomena according to natural laws. Reason is present and\nthe same in all human actions and at all times; but it does not itself\nexist in time, and therefore does not enter upon any state in which it\ndid not formerly exist. It is, relatively to new states or conditions,\ndetermining, but not determinable. Hence we cannot ask: \u201cWhy did not\nreason determine itself in a different manner?\u201d The question ought to\nbe thus stated: \u201cWhy did not reason employ its power of causality to\ndetermine certain phenomena in a different manner?\u201d But this is a\nquestion which admits of no answer. For a different intelligible\ncharacter would have exhibited a different empirical character; and,\nwhen we say that, in spite of the course which his whole former life\nhas taken, the offender could have refrained from uttering the\nfalsehood, this means merely that the act was subject to the power and\nauthority\u2014permissive or prohibitive\u2014of reason. Now, reason is not\nsubject in its causality to any conditions of phenomena or of time; and\na difference in time may produce a difference in the relation of\nphenomena to each other\u2014for these are not things and therefore not\ncauses in themselves\u2014but it cannot produce any difference in the\nrelation in which the action stands to the faculty of reason.\nThus, then, in our investigation into free actions and the causal power\nwhich produced them, we arrive at an intelligible cause, beyond which,\nhowever, we cannot go; although we can recognize that it is free, that\nis, independent of all sensuous conditions, and that, in this way, it\nmay be the sensuously unconditioned condition of phenomena. But for\nwhat reason the intelligible character generates such and such\nphenomena and exhibits such and such an empirical character under\ncertain circumstances, it is beyond the power of our reason to decide.\nThe question is as much above the power and the sphere of reason as the\nfollowing would be: \u201cWhy does the transcendental object of our external\nsensuous intuition allow of no other form than that of intuition in\nspace?\u201d But the problem, which we were called upon to solve, does not\nrequire us to entertain any such questions. The problem was merely\nthis\u2014whether freedom and natural necessity can exist without opposition\nin the same action. To this question we have given a sufficient answer;\nfor we have shown that, as the former stands in a relation to a\ndifferent kind of condition from those of the latter, the law of the\none does not affect the law of the other and that, consequently, both\ncan exist together in independence of and without interference with\neach other.\nThe reader must be careful to remark that my intention in the above\nremarks has not been to prove the actual existence of freedom, as a\nfaculty in which resides the cause of certain sensuous phenomena. For,\nnot to mention that such an argument would not have a transcendental\ncharacter, nor have been limited to the discussion of pure\nconceptions\u2014all attempts at inferring from experience what cannot be\ncogitated in accordance with its laws, must ever be unsuccessful. Nay,\nmore, I have not even aimed at demonstrating the possibility of\nfreedom; for this too would have been a vain endeavour, inasmuch as it\nis beyond the power of the mind to cognize the possibility of a reality\nor of a causal power by the aid of mere \u00e0 priori conceptions. Freedom\nhas been considered in the foregoing remarks only as a transcendental\nidea, by means of which reason aims at originating a series of\nconditions in the world of phenomena with the help of that which is\nsensuously unconditioned, involving itself, however, in an antinomy\nwith the laws which itself prescribes for the conduct of the\nunderstanding. That this antinomy is based upon a mere illusion, and\nthat nature and freedom are at least not opposed\u2014this was the only\nthing in our power to prove, and the question which it was our task to\nsolve.\nIV. Solution of the Cosmological Idea of the Totality of the Dependence\nof Phenomenal Existences\nIn the preceding remarks, we considered the changes in the world of\nsense as constituting a dynamical series, in which each member is\nsubordinated to another\u2014as its cause. Our present purpose is to avail\nourselves of this series of states or conditions as a guide to an\nexistence which may be the highest condition of all changeable\nphenomena, that is, to a necessary being. Our endeavour to reach, not\nthe unconditioned causality, but the unconditioned existence, of\nsubstance. The series before us is therefore a series of conceptions,\nand not of intuitions (in which the one intuition is the condition of\nthe other).\nBut it is evident that, as all phenomena are subject to change and\nconditioned in their existence, the series of dependent existences\ncannot embrace an unconditioned member, the existence of which would be\nabsolutely necessary. It follows that, if phenomena were things in\nthemselves, and\u2014as an immediate consequence from this\nsupposition\u2014condition and conditioned belonged to the same series of\nphenomena, the existence of a necessary being, as the condition of the\nexistence of sensuous phenomena, would be perfectly impossible.\nAn important distinction, however, exists between the dynamical and the\nmathematical regress. The latter is engaged solely with the combination\nof parts into a whole, or with the division of a whole into its parts;\nand therefore are the conditions of its series parts of the series, and\nto be consequently regarded as homogeneous, and for this reason, as\nconsisting, without exception, of phenomena. If the former regress, on\nthe contrary, the aim of which is not to establish the possibility of\nan unconditioned whole consisting of given parts, or of an\nunconditioned part of a given whole, but to demonstrate the possibility\nof the deduction of a certain state from its cause, or of the\ncontingent existence of substance from that which exists necessarily,\nit is not requisite that the condition should form part of an empirical\nseries along with the conditioned.\nIn the case of the apparent antinomy with which we are at present\ndealing, there exists a way of escape from the difficulty; for it is\nnot impossible that both of the contradictory statements may be true in\ndifferent relations. All sensuous phenomena may be contingent, and\nconsequently possess only an empirically conditioned existence, and yet\nthere may also exist a non-empirical condition of the whole series, or,\nin other words, a necessary being. For this necessary being, as an\nintelligible condition, would not form a member\u2014not even the highest\nmember\u2014of the series; the whole world of sense would be left in its\nempirically determined existence uninterfered with and uninfluenced.\nThis would also form a ground of distinction between the modes of\nsolution employed for the third and fourth antinomies. For, while in\nthe consideration of freedom in the former antinomy, the thing\nitself\u2014the cause (substantia phaenomenon)\u2014was regarded as belonging to\nthe series of conditions, and only its causality to the intelligible\nworld\u2014we are obliged in the present case to cogitate this necessary\nbeing as purely intelligible and as existing entirely apart from the\nworld of sense (as an ens extramundanum); for otherwise it would be\nsubject to the phenomenal law of contingency and dependence.\nIn relation to the present problem, therefore, the regulative principle\nof reason is that everything in the sensuous world possesses an\nempirically conditioned existence\u2014that no property of the sensuous\nworld possesses unconditioned necessity\u2014that we are bound to expect,\nand, so far as is possible, to seek for the empirical condition of\nevery member in the series of conditions\u2014and that there is no\nsufficient reason to justify us in deducing any existence from a\ncondition which lies out of and beyond the empirical series, or in\nregarding any existence as independent and self-subsistent; although\nthis should not prevent us from recognizing the possibility of the\nwhole series being based upon a being which is intelligible, and for\nthis reason free from all empirical conditions.\nBut it has been far from my intention, in these remarks, to prove the\nexistence of this unconditioned and necessary being, or even to\nevidence the possibility of a purely intelligible condition of the\nexistence of all sensuous phenomena. As bounds were set to reason, to\nprevent it from leaving the guiding thread of empirical conditions and\nlosing itself in transcendent theories which are incapable of concrete\npresentation; so it was my purpose, on the other hand, to set bounds to\nthe law of the purely empirical understanding, and to protest against\nany attempts on its part at deciding on the possibility of things, or\ndeclaring the existence of the intelligible to be impossible, merely on\nthe ground that it is not available for the explanation and exposition\nof phenomena. It has been shown, at the same time, that the contingency\nof all the phenomena of nature and their empirical conditions is quite\nconsistent with the arbitrary hypothesis of a necessary, although\npurely intelligible condition, that no real contradiction exists\nbetween them and that, consequently, both may be true. The existence of\nsuch an absolutely necessary being may be impossible; but this can\nnever be demonstrated from the universal contingency and dependence of\nsensuous phenomena, nor from the principle which forbids us to\ndiscontinue the series at some member of it, or to seek for its cause\nin some sphere of existence beyond the world of nature. Reason goes its\nway in the empirical world, and follows, too, its peculiar path in the\nsphere of the transcendental.\nThe sensuous world contains nothing but phenomena, which are mere\nrepresentations, and always sensuously conditioned; things in\nthemselves are not, and cannot be, objects to us. It is not to be\nwondered at, therefore, that we are not justified in leaping from some\nmember of an empirical series beyond the world of sense, as if\nempirical representations were things in themselves, existing apart\nfrom their transcendental ground in the human mind, and the cause of\nwhose existence may be sought out of the empirical series. This would\ncertainly be the case with contingent things; but it cannot be with\nmere representations of things, the contingency of which is itself\nmerely a phenomenon and can relate to no other regress than that which\ndetermines phenomena, that is, the empirical. But to cogitate an\nintelligible ground of phenomena, as free, moreover, from the\ncontingency of the latter, conflicts neither with the unlimited nature\nof the empirical regress, nor with the complete contingency of\nphenomena. And the demonstration of this was the only thing necessary\nfor the solution of this apparent antinomy. For if the condition of\nevery conditioned\u2014as regards its existence\u2014is sensuous, and for this\nreason a part of the same series, it must be itself conditioned, as was\nshown in the antithesis of the fourth antinomy. The embarrassments into\nwhich a reason, which postulates the unconditioned, necessarily falls,\nmust, therefore, continue to exist; or the unconditioned must be placed\nin the sphere of the intelligible. In this way, its necessity does not\nrequire, nor does it even permit, the presence of an empirical\ncondition: and it is, consequently, unconditionally necessary.\nThe empirical employment of reason is not affected by the assumption of\na purely intelligible being; it continues its operations on the\nprinciple of the contingency of all phenomena, proceeding from\nempirical conditions to still higher and higher conditions, themselves\nempirical. Just as little does this regulative principle exclude the\nassumption of an intelligible cause, when the question regards merely\nthe pure employment of reason\u2014in relation to ends or aims. For, in this\ncase, an intelligible cause signifies merely the transcendental and to\nus unknown ground of the possibility of sensuous phenomena, and its\nexistence, necessary and independent of all sensuous conditions, is not\ninconsistent with the contingency of phenomena, or with the unlimited\npossibility of regress which exists in the series of empirical\nconditions.\nConcluding Remarks on the Antinomy of Pure Reason.\nSo long as the object of our rational conceptions is the totality of\nconditions in the world of phenomena, and the satisfaction, from this\nsource, of the requirements of reason, so long are our ideas\ntranscendental and cosmological. But when we set the\nunconditioned\u2014which is the aim of all our inquiries\u2014in a sphere which\nlies out of the world of sense and possible experience, our ideas\nbecome transcendent. They are then not merely serviceable towards the\ncompletion of the exercise of reason (which remains an idea, never\nexecuted, but always to be pursued); they detach themselves completely\nfrom experience and construct for themselves objects, the material of\nwhich has not been presented by experience, and the objective reality\nof which is not based upon the completion of the empirical series, but\nupon pure \u00e0 priori conceptions. The intelligible object of these\ntranscendent ideas may be conceded, as a transcendental object. But we\ncannot cogitate it as a thing determinable by certain distinct\npredicates relating to its internal nature, for it has no connection\nwith empirical conceptions; nor are we justified in affirming the\nexistence of any such object. It is, consequently, a mere product of\nthe mind alone. Of all the cosmological ideas, however, it is that\noccasioning the fourth antinomy which compels us to venture upon this\nstep. For the existence of phenomena, always conditioned and never\nself-subsistent, requires us to look for an object different from\nphenomena\u2014an intelligible object, with which all contingency must\ncease. But, as we have allowed ourselves to assume the existence of a\nself-subsistent reality out of the field of experience, and are\ntherefore obliged to regard phenomena as merely a contingent mode of\nrepresenting intelligible objects employed by beings which are\nthemselves intelligences\u2014no other course remains for us than to follow\nanalogy and employ the same mode in forming some conception of\nintelligible things, of which we have not the least knowledge, which\nnature taught us to use in the formation of empirical conceptions.\nExperience made us acquainted with the contingent. But we are at\npresent engaged in the discussion of things which are not objects of\nexperience; and must, therefore, deduce our knowledge of them from that\nwhich is necessary absolutely and in itself, that is, from pure\nconceptions. Hence the first step which we take out of the world of\nsense obliges us to begin our system of new cognition with the\ninvestigation of a necessary being, and to deduce from our conceptions\nof it all our conceptions of intelligible things. This we propose to\nattempt in the following chapter.\nChapter III. The Ideal of Pure Reason\nSection I. Of the Ideal in General\nWe have seen that pure conceptions do not present objects to the mind,\nexcept under sensuous conditions; because the conditions of objective\nreality do not exist in these conceptions, which contain, in fact,\nnothing but the mere form of thought. They may, however, when applied\nto phenomena, be presented in concreto; for it is phenomena that\npresent to them the materials for the formation of empirical\nconceptions, which are nothing more than concrete forms of the\nconceptions of the understanding. But ideas are still further removed\nfrom objective reality than categories; for no phenomenon can ever\npresent them to the human mind in concreto. They contain a certain\nperfection, attainable by no possible empirical cognition; and they\ngive to reason a systematic unity, to which the unity of experience\nattempts to approximate, but can never completely attain.\nBut still further removed than the idea from objective reality is the\nIdeal, by which term I understand the idea, not in concreto, but in\nindividuo\u2014as an individual thing, determinable or determined by the\nidea alone. The idea of humanity in its complete perfection supposes\nnot only the advancement of all the powers and faculties, which\nconstitute our conception of human nature, to a complete attainment of\ntheir final aims, but also everything which is requisite for the\ncomplete determination of the idea; for of all contradictory\npredicates, only one can conform with the idea of the perfect man. What\nI have termed an ideal was in Plato\u2019s philosophy an idea of the divine\nmind\u2014an individual object present to its pure intuition, the most\nperfect of every kind of possible beings, and the archetype of all\nphenomenal existences.\nWithout rising to these speculative heights, we are bound to confess\nthat human reason contains not only ideas, but ideals, which possess,\nnot, like those of Plato, creative, but certainly practical power\u2014as\nregulative principles, and form the basis of the perfectibility of\ncertain actions. Moral conceptions are not perfectly pure conceptions\nof reason, because an empirical element\u2014of pleasure or pain\u2014lies at the\nfoundation of them. In relation, however, to the principle, whereby\nreason sets bounds to a freedom which is in itself without law, and\nconsequently when we attend merely to their form, they may be\nconsidered as pure conceptions of reason. Virtue and wisdom in their\nperfect purity are ideas. But the wise man of the Stoics is an ideal,\nthat is to say, a human being existing only in thought and in complete\nconformity with the idea of wisdom. As the idea provides a rule, so the\nideal serves as an archetype for the perfect and complete determination\nof the copy. Thus the conduct of this wise and divine man serves us as\na standard of action, with which we may compare and judge ourselves,\nwhich may help us to reform ourselves, although the perfection it\ndemands can never be attained by us. Although we cannot concede\nobjective reality to these ideals, they are not to be considered as\nchimeras; on the contrary, they provide reason with a standard, which\nenables it to estimate, by comparison, the degree of incompleteness in\nthe objects presented to it. But to aim at realizing the ideal in an\nexample in the world of experience\u2014to describe, for instance, the\ncharacter of the perfectly wise man in a romance\u2014is impracticable. Nay\nmore, there is something absurd in the attempt; and the result must be\nlittle edifying, as the natural limitations, which are continually\nbreaking in upon the perfection and completeness of the idea, destroy\nthe illusion in the story and throw an air of suspicion even on what is\ngood in the idea, which hence appears fictitious and unreal.\nSuch is the constitution of the ideal of reason, which is always based\nupon determinate conceptions, and serves as a rule and a model for\nlimitation or of criticism. Very different is the nature of the ideals\nof the imagination. Of these it is impossible to present an\nintelligible conception; they are a kind of monogram, drawn according\nto no determinate rule, and forming rather a vague picture\u2014the\nproduction of many diverse experiences\u2014than a determinate image. Such\nare the ideals which painters and physiognomists profess to have in\ntheir minds, and which can serve neither as a model for production nor\nas a standard for appreciation. They may be termed, though improperly,\nsensuous ideals, as they are declared to be models of certain possible\nempirical intuitions. They cannot, however, furnish rules or standards\nfor explanation or examination.\nIn its ideals, reason aims at complete and perfect determination\naccording to \u00e0 priori rules; and hence it cogitates an object, which\nmust be completely determinable in conformity with principles, although\nall empirical conditions are absent, and the conception of the object\nis on this account transcendent.\nSection II. Of the Transcendental Ideal (Prototypon Trancendentale)\nEvery conception is, in relation to that which is not contained in it,\nundetermined and subject to the principle of determinability. This\nprinciple is that, of every two contradictorily opposed predicates,\nonly one can belong to a conception. It is a purely logical principle,\nitself based upon the principle of contradiction; inasmuch as it makes\ncomplete abstraction of the content and attends merely to the logical\nform of the cognition.\nBut again, everything, as regards its possibility, is also subject to\nthe principle of complete determination, according to which one of all\nthe possible contradictory predicates of things must belong to it. This\nprinciple is not based merely upon that of contradiction; for, in\naddition to the relation between two contradictory predicates, it\nregards everything as standing in a relation to the sum of\npossibilities, as the sum total of all predicates of things, and, while\npresupposing this sum as an \u00e0 priori condition, presents to the mind\neverything as receiving the possibility of its individual existence\nfrom the relation it bears to, and the share it possesses in, the\naforesaid sum of possibilities.[64] The principle of complete\ndetermination relates the content and not to the logical form. It is\nthe principle of the synthesis of all the predicates which are required\nto constitute the complete conception of a thing, and not a mere\nprinciple analytical representation, which enounces that one of two\ncontradictory predicates must belong to a conception. It contains,\nmoreover, a transcendental presupposition\u2014that, namely, of the material\nfor all possibility, which must contain \u00e0 priori the data for this or\nthat particular possibility.\n[64] Thus this principle declares everything to possess a relation to\na common correlate\u2014the sum-total of possibility, which, if discovered\nto exist in the idea of one individual thing, would establish the\naffinity of all possible things, from the identity of the ground of\ntheir complete determination. The determinability of every conception\nis subordinate to the universality (Allgemeinheit, universalitas) of\nthe principle of excluded middle; the determination of a thing to the\ntotality (Allheit, universitas) of all possible predicates.\nThe proposition, everything which exists is completely determined,\nmeans not only that one of every pair of given contradictory\nattributes, but that one of all possible attributes, is always\npredicable of the thing; in it the predicates are not merely compared\nlogically with each other, but the thing itself is transcendentally\ncompared with the sum-total of all possible predicates. The proposition\nis equivalent to saying: \u201cTo attain to a complete knowledge of a thing,\nit is necessary to possess a knowledge of everything that is possible,\nand to determine it thereby in a positive or negative manner.\u201d The\nconception of complete determination is consequently a conception which\ncannot be presented in its totality in concreto, and is therefore based\nupon an idea, which has its seat in the reason\u2014the faculty which\nprescribes to the understanding the laws of its harmonious and perfect\nexercise.\nNow, although this idea of the sum-total of all possibility, in so far\nas it forms the condition of the complete determination of everything,\nis itself undetermined in relation to the predicates which may\nconstitute this sum-total, and we cogitate in it merely the sum-total\nof all possible predicates\u2014we nevertheless find, upon closer\nexamination, that this idea, as a primitive conception of the mind,\nexcludes a large number of predicates\u2014those deduced and those\nirreconcilable with others, and that it is evolved as a conception\ncompletely determined \u00e0 priori. Thus it becomes the conception of an\nindividual object, which is completely determined by and through the\nmere idea, and must consequently be termed an ideal of pure reason.\nWhen we consider all possible predicates, not merely logically, but\ntranscendentally, that is to say, with reference to the content which\nmay be cogitated as existing in them \u00e0 priori, we shall find that some\nindicate a being, others merely a non-being. The logical negation\nexpressed in the word not does not properly belong to a conception, but\nonly to the relation of one conception to another in a judgement, and\nis consequently quite insufficient to present to the mind the content\nof a conception. The expression not mortal does not indicate that a\nnon-being is cogitated in the object; it does not concern the content\nat all. A transcendental negation, on the contrary, indicates non-being\nin itself, and is opposed to transcendental affirmation, the conception\nof which of itself expresses a being. Hence this affirmation indicates\na reality, because in and through it objects are considered to be\nsomething\u2014to be things; while the opposite negation, on the other hand,\nindicates a mere want, or privation, or absence, and, where such\nnegations alone are attached to a representation, the non-existence of\nanything corresponding to the representation.\nNow a negation cannot be cogitated as determined, without cogitating at\nthe same time the opposite affirmation. The man born blind has not the\nleast notion of darkness, because he has none of light; the vagabond\nknows nothing of poverty, because he has never known what it is to be\nin comfort;[65] the ignorant man has no conception of his ignorance,\nbecause he has no conception of knowledge. All conceptions of negatives\nare accordingly derived or deduced conceptions; and realities contain\nthe data, and, so to speak, the material or transcendental content of\nthe possibility and complete determination of all things.\n[65] The investigations and calculations of astronomers have taught us\nmuch that is wonderful; but the most important lesson we have received\nfrom them is the discovery of the abyss of our ignorance in relation\nto the universe\u2014an ignorance the magnitude of which reason, without\nthe information thus derived, could never have conceived. This\ndiscovery of our deficiencies must produce a great change in the\ndetermination of the aims of human reason.\nIf, therefore, a transcendental substratum lies at the foundation of\nthe complete determination of things\u2014a substratum which is to form the\nfund from which all possible predicates of things are to be supplied,\nthis substratum cannot be anything else than the idea of a sum-total of\nreality (omnitudo realitatis). In this view, negations are nothing but\nlimitations\u2014a term which could not, with propriety, be applied to them,\nif the unlimited (the all) did not form the true basis of our\nconception.\nThis conception of a sum-total of reality is the conception of a thing\nin itself, regarded as completely determined; and the conception of an\nens realissimum is the conception of an individual being, inasmuch as\nit is determined by that predicate of all possible contradictory\npredicates, which indicates and belongs to being. It is, therefore, a\ntranscendental ideal which forms the basis of the complete\ndetermination of everything that exists, and is the highest material\ncondition of its possibility\u2014a condition on which must rest the\ncogitation of all objects with respect to their content. Nay, more,\nthis ideal is the only proper ideal of which the human mind is capable;\nbecause in this case alone a general conception of a thing is\ncompletely determined by and through itself, and cognized as the\nrepresentation of an individuum.\nThe logical determination of a conception is based upon a disjunctive\nsyllogism, the major of which contains the logical division of the\nextent of a general conception, the minor limits this extent to a\ncertain part, while the conclusion determines the conception by this\npart. The general conception of a reality cannot be divided \u00e0 priori,\nbecause, without the aid of experience, we cannot know any determinate\nkinds of reality, standing under the former as the genus. The\ntranscendental principle of the complete determination of all things is\ntherefore merely the representation of the sum-total of all reality; it\nis not a conception which is the genus of all predicates under itself,\nbut one which comprehends them all within itself. The complete\ndetermination of a thing is consequently based upon the limitation of\nthis total of reality, so much being predicated of the thing, while all\nthat remains over is excluded\u2014a procedure which is in exact agreement\nwith that of the disjunctive syllogism and the determination of the\nobjects in the conclusion by one of the members of the division. It\nfollows that reason, in laying the transcendental ideal at the\nfoundation of its determination of all possible things, takes a course\nin exact analogy with that which it pursues in disjunctive syllogisms\u2014a\nproposition which formed the basis of the systematic division of all\ntranscendental ideas, according to which they are produced in complete\nparallelism with the three modes of syllogistic reasoning employed by\nthe human mind.\nIt is self-evident that reason, in cogitating the necessary complete\ndetermination of things, does not presuppose the existence of a being\ncorresponding to its ideal, but merely the idea of the ideal\u2014for the\npurpose of deducing from the unconditional totality of complete\ndetermination, The ideal is therefore the prototype of all things,\nwhich, as defective copies (ectypa), receive from it the material of\ntheir possibility, and approximate to it more or less, though it is\nimpossible that they can ever attain to its perfection.\nThe possibility of things must therefore be regarded as derived\u2014except\nthat of the thing which contains in itself all reality, which must be\nconsidered to be primitive and original. For all negations\u2014and they are\nthe only predicates by means of which all other things can be\ndistinguished from the ens realissimum\u2014are mere limitations of a\ngreater and a higher\u2014nay, the highest reality; and they consequently\npresuppose this reality, and are, as regards their content, derived\nfrom it. The manifold nature of things is only an infinitely various\nmode of limiting the conception of the highest reality, which is their\ncommon substratum; just as all figures are possible only as different\nmodes of limiting infinite space. The object of the ideal of reason\u2014an\nobject existing only in reason itself\u2014is also termed the primal being\n(ens originarium); as having no existence superior to him, the supreme\nbeing (ens summum); and as being the condition of all other beings,\nwhich rank under it, the being of all beings (ens entium). But none of\nthese terms indicate the objective relation of an actually existing\nobject to other things, but merely that of an idea to conceptions; and\nall our investigations into this subject still leave us in perfect\nuncertainty with regard to the existence of this being.\nA primal being cannot be said to consist of many other beings with an\nexistence which is derivative, for the latter presuppose the former,\nand therefore cannot be constitutive parts of it. It follows that the\nideal of the primal being must be cogitated as simple.\nThe deduction of the possibility of all other things from this primal\nbeing cannot, strictly speaking, be considered as a limitation, or as a\nkind of division of its reality; for this would be regarding the primal\nbeing as a mere aggregate\u2014which has been shown to be impossible,\nalthough it was so represented in our first rough sketch. The highest\nreality must be regarded rather as the ground than as the sum-total of\nthe possibility of all things, and the manifold nature of things be\nbased, not upon the limitation of the primal being itself, but upon the\ncomplete series of effects which flow from it. And thus all our powers\nof sense, as well as all phenomenal reality, may be with propriety\nregarded as belonging to this series of effects, while they could not\nhave formed parts of the idea, considered as an aggregate. Pursuing\nthis track, and hypostatizing this idea, we shall find ourselves\nauthorized to determine our notion of the Supreme Being by means of the\nmere conception of a highest reality, as one, simple, all-sufficient,\neternal, and so on\u2014in one word, to determine it in its unconditioned\ncompleteness by the aid of every possible predicate. The conception of\nsuch a being is the conception of God in its transcendental sense, and\nthus the ideal of pure reason is the object-matter of a transcendental\ntheology.\nBut, by such an employment of the transcendental idea, we should be\nover stepping the limits of its validity and purpose. For reason placed\nit, as the conception of all reality, at the basis of the complete\ndetermination of things, without requiring that this conception be\nregarded as the conception of an objective existence. Such an existence\nwould be purely fictitious, and the hypostatizing of the content of the\nidea into an ideal, as an individual being, is a step perfectly\nunauthorized. Nay, more, we are not even called upon to assume the\npossibility of such an hypothesis, as none of the deductions drawn from\nsuch an ideal would affect the complete determination of things in\ngeneral\u2014for the sake of which alone is the idea necessary.\nIt is not sufficient to circumscribe the procedure and the dialectic of\nreason; we must also endeavour to discover the sources of this\ndialectic, that we may have it in our power to give a rational\nexplanation of this illusion, as a phenomenon of the human mind. For\nthe ideal, of which we are at present speaking, is based, not upon an\narbitrary, but upon a natural, idea. The question hence arises: How\nhappens it that reason regards the possibility of all things as deduced\nfrom a single possibility, that, to wit, of the highest reality, and\npresupposes this as existing in an individual and primal being?\nThe answer is ready; it is at once presented by the procedure of\ntranscendental analytic. The possibility of sensuous objects is a\nrelation of these objects to thought, in which something (the empirical\nform) may be cogitated \u00e0 priori; while that which constitutes the\nmatter\u2014the reality of the phenomenon (that element which corresponds to\nsensation)\u2014must be given from without, as otherwise it could not even\nbe cogitated by, nor could its possibility be presentable to the mind.\nNow, a sensuous object is completely determined, when it has been\ncompared with all phenomenal predicates, and represented by means of\nthese either positively or negatively. But, as that which constitutes\nthe thing itself\u2014the real in a phenomenon, must be given, and that, in\nwhich the real of all phenomena is given, is experience, one, sole, and\nall-embracing\u2014the material of the possibility of all sensuous objects\nmust be presupposed as given in a whole, and it is upon the limitation\nof this whole that the possibility of all empirical objects, their\ndistinction from each other and their complete determination, are\nbased. Now, no other objects are presented to us besides sensuous\nobjects, and these can be given only in connection with a possible\nexperience; it follows that a thing is not an object to us, unless it\npresupposes the whole or sum-total of empirical reality as the\ncondition of its possibility. Now, a natural illusion leads us to\nconsider this principle, which is valid only of sensuous objects, as\nvalid with regard to things in general. And thus we are induced to hold\nthe empirical principle of our conceptions of the possibility of\nthings, as phenomena, by leaving out this limitative condition, to be a\ntranscendental principle of the possibility of things in general.\nWe proceed afterwards to hypostatize this idea of the sum-total of all\nreality, by changing the distributive unity of the empirical exercise\nof the understanding into the collective unity of an empirical whole\u2014a\ndialectical illusion, and by cogitating this whole or sum of experience\nas an individual thing, containing in itself all empirical reality.\nThis individual thing or being is then, by means of the above-mentioned\ntranscendental subreption, substituted for our notion of a thing which\nstands at the head of the possibility of all things, the real\nconditions of whose complete determination it presents.[66]\n[66] This ideal of the ens realissimum\u2014although merely a mental\nrepresentation\u2014is first objectivized, that is, has an objective\nexistence attributed to it, then hypostatized, and finally, by the\nnatural progress of reason to the completion of unity, personified, as\nwe shall show presently. For the regulative unity of experience is not\nbased upon phenomena themselves, but upon the connection of the\nvariety of phenomena by the understanding in a consciousness, and thus\nthe unity of the supreme reality and the complete determinability of\nall things, seem to reside in a supreme understanding, and,\nconsequently, in a conscious intelligence.\nSection III. Of the Arguments employed by Speculative Reason in Proof\nof the Existence of a Supreme Being\nNotwithstanding the pressing necessity which reason feels, to form some\npresupposition that shall serve the understanding as a proper basis for\nthe complete determination of its conceptions, the idealistic and\nfactitious nature of such a presupposition is too evident to allow\nreason for a moment to persuade itself into a belief of the objective\nexistence of a mere creation of its own thought. But there are other\nconsiderations which compel reason to seek out some resting place in\nthe regress from the conditioned to the unconditioned, which is not\ngiven as an actual existence from the mere conception of it, although\nit alone can give completeness to the series of conditions. And this is\nthe natural course of every human reason, even of the most uneducated,\nalthough the path at first entered it does not always continue to\nfollow. It does not begin from conceptions, but from common experience,\nand requires a basis in actual existence. But this basis is insecure,\nunless it rests upon the immovable rock of the absolutely necessary.\nAnd this foundation is itself unworthy of trust, if it leave under and\nabove it empty space, if it do not fill all, and leave no room for a\nwhy or a wherefore, if it be not, in one word, infinite in its reality.\nIf we admit the existence of some one thing, whatever it may be, we\nmust also admit that there is something which exists necessarily. For\nwhat is contingent exists only under the condition of some other thing,\nwhich is its cause; and from this we must go on to conclude the\nexistence of a cause which is not contingent, and which consequently\nexists necessarily and unconditionally. Such is the argument by which\nreason justifies its advances towards a primal being.\nNow reason looks round for the conception of a being that may be\nadmitted, without inconsistency, to be worthy of the attribute of\nabsolute necessity, not for the purpose of inferring \u00e0 priori, from the\nconception of such a being, its objective existence (for if reason\nallowed itself to take this course, it would not require a basis in\ngiven and actual existence, but merely the support of pure\nconceptions), but for the purpose of discovering, among all our\nconceptions of possible things, that conception which possesses no\nelement inconsistent with the idea of absolute necessity. For that\nthere must be some absolutely necessary existence, it regards as a\ntruth already established. Now, if it can remove every existence\nincapable of supporting the attribute of absolute necessity, excepting\none\u2014this must be the absolutely necessary being, whether its necessity\nis comprehensible by us, that is, deducible from the conception of it\nalone, or not.\nNow that, the conception of which contains a therefore to every\nwherefore, which is not defective in any respect whatever, which is\nall-sufficient as a condition, seems to be the being of which we can\njustly predicate absolute necessity\u2014for this reason, that, possessing\nthe conditions of all that is possible, it does not and cannot itself\nrequire any condition. And thus it satisfies, in one respect at least,\nthe requirements of the conception of absolute necessity. In this view,\nit is superior to all other conceptions, which, as deficient and\nincomplete, do not possess the characteristic of independence of all\nhigher conditions. It is true that we cannot infer from this that what\ndoes not contain in itself the supreme and complete condition\u2014the\ncondition of all other things\u2014must possess only a conditioned\nexistence; but as little can we assert the contrary, for this supposed\nbeing does not possess the only characteristic which can enable reason\nto cognize by means of an \u00e0 priori conception the unconditioned and\nnecessary nature of its existence.\nThe conception of an ens realissimum is that which best agrees with the\nconception of an unconditioned and necessary being. The former\nconception does not satisfy all the requirements of the latter; but we\nhave no choice, we are obliged to adhere to it, for we find that we\ncannot do without the existence of a necessary being; and even although\nwe admit it, we find it out of our power to discover in the whole\nsphere of possibility any being that can advance well-grounded claims\nto such a distinction.\nThe following is, therefore, the natural course of human reason. It\nbegins by persuading itself of the existence of some necessary being.\nIn this being it recognizes the characteristics of unconditioned\nexistence. It then seeks the conception of that which is independent of\nall conditions, and finds it in that which is itself the sufficient\ncondition of all other things\u2014in other words, in that which contains\nall reality. But the unlimited all is an absolute unity, and is\nconceived by the mind as a being one and supreme; and thus reason\nconcludes that the Supreme Being, as the primal basis of all things,\npossesses an existence which is absolutely necessary.\nThis conception must be regarded as in some degree satisfactory, if we\nadmit the existence of a necessary being, and consider that there\nexists a necessity for a definite and final answer to these questions.\nIn such a case, we cannot make a better choice, or rather we have no\nchoice at all, but feel ourselves obliged to declare in favour of the\nabsolute unity of complete reality, as the highest source of the\npossibility of things. But if there exists no motive for coming to a\ndefinite conclusion, and we may leave the question unanswered till we\nhave fully weighed both sides\u2014in other words, when we are merely called\nupon to decide how much we happen to know about the question, and how\nmuch we merely flatter ourselves that we know\u2014the above conclusion does\nnot appear to be so great advantage, but, on the contrary, seems\ndefective in the grounds upon which it is supported.\nFor, admitting the truth of all that has been said, that, namely, the\ninference from a given existence (my own, for example) to the existence\nof an unconditioned and necessary being is valid and unassailable;\nthat, in the second place, we must consider a being which contains all\nreality, and consequently all the conditions of other things, to be\nabsolutely unconditioned; and admitting too, that we have thus\ndiscovered the conception of a thing to which may be attributed,\nwithout inconsistency, absolute necessity\u2014it does not follow from all\nthis that the conception of a limited being, in which the supreme\nreality does not reside, is therefore incompatible with the idea of\nabsolute necessity. For, although I do not discover the element of the\nunconditioned in the conception of such a being\u2014an element which is\nmanifestly existent in the sum-total of all conditions\u2014I am not\nentitled to conclude that its existence is therefore conditioned; just\nas I am not entitled to affirm, in a hypothetical syllogism, that where\na certain condition does not exist (in the present, completeness, as\nfar as pure conceptions are concerned), the conditioned does not exist\neither. On the contrary, we are free to consider all limited beings as\nlikewise unconditionally necessary, although we are unable to infer\nthis from the general conception which we have of them. Thus conducted,\nthis argument is incapable of giving us the least notion of the\nproperties of a necessary being, and must be in every respect without\nresult.\nThis argument continues, however, to possess a weight and an authority,\nwhich, in spite of its objective insufficiency, it has never been\ndivested of. For, granting that certain responsibilities lie upon us,\nwhich, as based on the ideas of reason, deserve to be respected and\nsubmitted to, although they are incapable of a real or practical\napplication to our nature, or, in other words, would be\nresponsibilities without motives, except upon the supposition of a\nSupreme Being to give effect and influence to the practical laws: in\nsuch a case we should be bound to obey our conceptions, which, although\nobjectively insufficient, do, according to the standard of reason,\npreponderate over and are superior to any claims that may be advanced\nfrom any other quarter. The equilibrium of doubt would in this case be\ndestroyed by a practical addition; indeed, Reason would be compelled to\ncondemn herself, if she refused to comply with the demands of the\njudgement, no superior to which we know\u2014however defective her\nunderstanding of the grounds of these demands might be.\nThis argument, although in fact transcendental, inasmuch as it rests\nupon the intrinsic insufficiency of the contingent, is so simple and\nnatural, that the commonest understanding can appreciate its value. We\nsee things around us change, arise, and pass away; they, or their\ncondition, must therefore have a cause. The same demand must again be\nmade of the cause itself\u2014as a datum of experience. Now it is natural\nthat we should place the highest causality just where we place supreme\ncausality, in that being, which contains the conditions of all possible\neffects, and the conception of which is so simple as that of an\nall-embracing reality. This highest cause, then, we regard as\nabsolutely necessary, because we find it absolutely necessary to rise\nto it, and do not discover any reason for proceeding beyond it. Thus,\namong all nations, through the darkest polytheism glimmer some faint\nsparks of monotheism, to which these idolaters have been led, not from\nreflection and profound thought, but by the study and natural progress\nof the common understanding.\nThere are only three modes of proving the existence of a Deity, on the\ngrounds of speculative reason.\nAll the paths conducting to this end begin either from determinate\nexperience and the peculiar constitution of the world of sense, and\nrise, according to the laws of causality, from it to the highest cause\nexisting apart from the world\u2014or from a purely indeterminate\nexperience, that is, some empirical existence\u2014or abstraction is made of\nall experience, and the existence of a supreme cause is concluded from\n\u00e0 priori conceptions alone. The first is the physico-theological\nargument, the second the cosmological, the third the ontological. More\nthere are not, and more there cannot be.\nI shall show it is as unsuccessful on the one path\u2014the empirical\u2014as on\nthe other\u2014the transcendental, and that it stretches its wings in vain,\nto soar beyond the world of sense by the mere might of speculative\nthought. As regards the order in which we must discuss those arguments,\nit will be exactly the reverse of that in which reason, in the progress\nof its development, attains to them\u2014the order in which they are placed\nabove. For it will be made manifest to the reader that, although\nexperience presents the occasion and the starting-point, it is the\ntranscendental idea of reason which guides it in its pilgrimage and is\nthe goal of all its struggles. I shall therefore begin with an\nexamination of the transcendental argument, and afterwards inquire what\nadditional strength has accrued to this mode of proof from the addition\nof the empirical element.\nSection IV. Of the Impossibility of an Ontological Proof of the\nExistence of God\nIt is evident from what has been said that the conception of an\nabsolutely necessary being is a mere idea, the objective reality of\nwhich is far from being established by the mere fact that it is a need\nof reason. On the contrary, this idea serves merely to indicate a\ncertain unattainable perfection, and rather limits the operations than,\nby the presentation of new objects, extends the sphere of the\nunderstanding. But a strange anomaly meets us at the very threshold;\nfor the inference from a given existence in general to an absolutely\nnecessary existence seems to be correct and unavoidable, while the\nconditions of the understanding refuse to aid us in forming any\nconception of such a being.\nPhilosophers have always talked of an absolutely necessary being, and\nhave nevertheless declined to take the trouble of conceiving\nwhether\u2014and how\u2014a being of this nature is even cogitable, not to\nmention that its existence is actually demonstrable. A verbal\ndefinition of the conception is certainly easy enough: it is something\nthe non-existence of which is impossible. But does this definition\nthrow any light upon the conditions which render it impossible to\ncogitate the non-existence of a thing\u2014conditions which we wish to\nascertain, that we may discover whether we think anything in the\nconception of such a being or not? For the mere fact that I throw away,\nby means of the word unconditioned, all the conditions which the\nunderstanding habitually requires in order to regard anything as\nnecessary, is very far from making clear whether by means of the\nconception of the unconditionally necessary I think of something, or\nreally of nothing at all.\nNay, more, this chance-conception, now become so current, many have\nendeavoured to explain by examples which seemed to render any inquiries\nregarding its intelligibility quite needless. Every geometrical\nproposition\u2014a triangle has three angles\u2014it was said, is absolutely\nnecessary; and thus people talked of an object which lay out of the\nsphere of our understanding as if it were perfectly plain what the\nconception of such a being meant.\nAll the examples adduced have been drawn, without exception, from\njudgements, and not from things. But the unconditioned necessity of a\njudgement does not form the absolute necessity of a thing. On the\ncontrary, the absolute necessity of a judgement is only a conditioned\nnecessity of a thing, or of the predicate in a judgement. The\nproposition above-mentioned does not enounce that three angles\nnecessarily exist, but, upon condition that a triangle exists, three\nangles must necessarily exist\u2014in it. And thus this logical necessity\nhas been the source of the greatest delusions. Having formed an \u00e0\npriori conception of a thing, the content of which was made to embrace\nexistence, we believed ourselves safe in concluding that, because\nexistence belongs necessarily to the object of the conception (that is,\nunder the condition of my positing this thing as given), the existence\nof the thing is also posited necessarily, and that it is therefore\nabsolutely necessary\u2014merely because its existence has been cogitated in\nthe conception.\nIf, in an identical judgement, I annihilate the predicate in thought,\nand retain the subject, a contradiction is the result; and hence I say,\nthe former belongs necessarily to the latter. But if I suppress both\nsubject and predicate in thought, no contradiction arises; for there is\nnothing at all, and therefore no means of forming a contradiction. To\nsuppose the existence of a triangle and not that of its three angles,\nis self-contradictory; but to suppose the non-existence of both\ntriangle and angles is perfectly admissible. And so is it with the\nconception of an absolutely necessary being. Annihilate its existence\nin thought, and you annihilate the thing itself with all its\npredicates; how then can there be any room for contradiction?\nExternally, there is nothing to give rise to a contradiction, for a\nthing cannot be necessary externally; nor internally, for, by the\nannihilation or suppression of the thing itself, its internal\nproperties are also annihilated. God is omnipotent\u2014that is a necessary\njudgement. His omnipotence cannot be denied, if the existence of a\nDeity is posited\u2014the existence, that is, of an infinite being, the two\nconceptions being identical. But when you say, God does not exist,\nneither omnipotence nor any other predicate is affirmed; they must all\ndisappear with the subject, and in this judgement there cannot exist\nthe least self-contradiction.\nYou have thus seen that when the predicate of a judgement is\nannihilated in thought along with the subject, no internal\ncontradiction can arise, be the predicate what it may. There is no\npossibility of evading the conclusion\u2014you find yourselves compelled to\ndeclare: There are certain subjects which cannot be annihilated in\nthought. But this is nothing more than saying: There exist subjects\nwhich are absolutely necessary\u2014the very hypothesis which you are called\nupon to establish. For I find myself unable to form the slightest\nconception of a thing which when annihilated in thought with all its\npredicates, leaves behind a contradiction; and contradiction is the\nonly criterion of impossibility in the sphere of pure \u00e0 priori\nconceptions.\nAgainst these general considerations, the justice of which no one can\ndispute, one argument is adduced, which is regarded as furnishing a\nsatisfactory demonstration from the fact. It is affirmed that there is\none and only one conception, in which the non-being or annihilation of\nthe object is self-contradictory, and this is the conception of an ens\nrealissimum. It possesses, you say, all reality, and you feel\nyourselves justified in admitting the possibility of such a being.\n(This I am willing to grant for the present, although the existence of\na conception which is not self-contradictory is far from being\nsufficient to prove the possibility of an object.)[67] Now the notion\nof all reality embraces in it that of existence; the notion of\nexistence lies, therefore, in the conception of this possible thing. If\nthis thing is annihilated in thought, the internal possibility of the\nthing is also annihilated, which is self-contradictory.\n[67] A conception is always possible, if it is not self-contradictory.\nThis is the logical criterion of possibility, distinguishing the\nobject of such a conception from the nihil negativum. But it may be,\nnotwithstanding, an empty conception, unless the objective reality of\nthis synthesis, but which it is generated, is demonstrated; and a\nproof of this kind must be based upon principles of possible\nexperience, and not upon the principle of analysis or contradiction.\nThis remark may be serviceable as a warning against concluding, from\nthe possibility of a conception\u2014which is logical\u2014the possibility of a\nthing\u2014which is real.\nI answer: It is absurd to introduce\u2014under whatever term disguised\u2014into\nthe conception of a thing, which is to be cogitated solely in reference\nto its possibility, the conception of its existence. If this is\nadmitted, you will have apparently gained the day, but in reality have\nenounced nothing but a mere tautology. I ask, is the proposition, this\nor that thing (which I am admitting to be possible) exists, an\nanalytical or a synthetical proposition? If the former, there is no\naddition made to the subject of your thought by the affirmation of its\nexistence; but then the conception in your minds is identical with the\nthing itself, or you have supposed the existence of a thing to be\npossible, and then inferred its existence from its internal\npossibility\u2014which is but a miserable tautology. The word reality in the\nconception of the thing, and the word existence in the conception of\nthe predicate, will not help you out of the difficulty. For, supposing\nyou were to term all positing of a thing reality, you have thereby\nposited the thing with all its predicates in the conception of the\nsubject and assumed its actual existence, and this you merely repeat in\nthe predicate. But if you confess, as every reasonable person must,\nthat every existential proposition is synthetical, how can it be\nmaintained that the predicate of existence cannot be denied without\ncontradiction?\u2014a property which is the characteristic of analytical\npropositions, alone.\nI should have a reasonable hope of putting an end for ever to this\nsophistical mode of argumentation, by a strict definition of the\nconception of existence, did not my own experience teach me that the\nillusion arising from our confounding a logical with a real predicate\n(a predicate which aids in the determination of a thing) resists almost\nall the endeavours of explanation and illustration. A logical predicate\nmay be what you please, even the subject may be predicated of itself;\nfor logic pays no regard to the content of a judgement. But the\ndetermination of a conception is a predicate, which adds to and\nenlarges the conception. It must not, therefore, be contained in the\nconception.\nBeing is evidently not a real predicate, that is, a conception of\nsomething which is added to the conception of some other thing. It is\nmerely the positing of a thing, or of certain determinations in it.\nLogically, it is merely the copula of a judgement. The proposition, God\nis omnipotent, contains two conceptions, which have a certain object or\ncontent; the word is, is no additional predicate\u2014it merely indicates\nthe relation of the predicate to the subject. Now, if I take the\nsubject (God) with all its predicates (omnipotence being one), and say:\nGod is, or, There is a God, I add no new predicate to the conception of\nGod, I merely posit or affirm the existence of the subject with all its\npredicates\u2014I posit the object in relation to my conception. The content\nof both is the same; and there is no addition made to the conception,\nwhich expresses merely the possibility of the object, by my cogitating\nthe object\u2014in the expression, it is\u2014as absolutely given or existing.\nThus the real contains no more than the possible. A hundred real\ndollars contain no more than a hundred possible dollars. For, as the\nlatter indicate the conception, and the former the object, on the\nsupposition that the content of the former was greater than that of the\nlatter, my conception would not be an expression of the whole object,\nand would consequently be an inadequate conception of it. But in\nreckoning my wealth there may be said to be more in a hundred real\ndollars than in a hundred possible dollars\u2014that is, in the mere\nconception of them. For the real object\u2014the dollars\u2014is not analytically\ncontained in my conception, but forms a synthetical addition to my\nconception (which is merely a determination of my mental state),\nalthough this objective reality\u2014this existence\u2014apart from my\nconceptions, does not in the least degree increase the aforesaid\nhundred dollars.\nBy whatever and by whatever number of predicates\u2014even to the complete\ndetermination of it\u2014I may cogitate a thing, I do not in the least\naugment the object of my conception by the addition of the statement:\nThis thing exists. Otherwise, not exactly the same, but something more\nthan what was cogitated in my conception, would exist, and I could not\naffirm that the exact object of my conception had real existence. If I\ncogitate a thing as containing all modes of reality except one, the\nmode of reality which is absent is not added to the conception of the\nthing by the affirmation that the thing exists; on the contrary, the\nthing exists\u2014if it exist at all\u2014with the same defect as that cogitated\nin its conception; otherwise not that which was cogitated, but\nsomething different, exists. Now, if I cogitate a being as the highest\nreality, without defect or imperfection, the question still\nremains\u2014whether this being exists or not? For, although no element is\nwanting in the possible real content of my conception, there is a\ndefect in its relation to my mental state, that is, I am ignorant\nwhether the cognition of the object indicated by the conception is\npossible \u00e0 posteriori. And here the cause of the present difficulty\nbecomes apparent. If the question regarded an object of sense merely,\nit would be impossible for me to confound the conception with the\nexistence of a thing. For the conception merely enables me to cogitate\nan object as according with the general conditions of experience; while\nthe existence of the object permits me to cogitate it as contained in\nthe sphere of actual experience. At the same time, this connection with\nthe world of experience does not in the least augment the conception,\nalthough a possible perception has been added to the experience of the\nmind. But if we cogitate existence by the pure category alone, it is\nnot to be wondered at, that we should find ourselves unable to present\nany criterion sufficient to distinguish it from mere possibility.\nWhatever be the content of our conception of an object, it is necessary\nto go beyond it, if we wish to predicate existence of the object. In\nthe case of sensuous objects, this is attained by their connection\naccording to empirical laws with some one of my perceptions; but there\nis no means of cognizing the existence of objects of pure thought,\nbecause it must be cognized completely \u00e0 priori. But all our knowledge\nof existence (be it immediately by perception, or by inferences\nconnecting some object with a perception) belongs entirely to the\nsphere of experience\u2014which is in perfect unity with itself; and\nalthough an existence out of this sphere cannot be absolutely declared\nto be impossible, it is a hypothesis the truth of which we have no\nmeans of ascertaining.\nThe notion of a Supreme Being is in many respects a highly useful idea;\nbut for the very reason that it is an idea, it is incapable of\nenlarging our cognition with regard to the existence of things. It is\nnot even sufficient to instruct us as to the possibility of a being\nwhich we do not know to exist. The analytical criterion of possibility,\nwhich consists in the absence of contradiction in propositions, cannot\nbe denied it. But the connection of real properties in a thing is a\nsynthesis of the possibility of which an \u00e0 priori judgement cannot be\nformed, because these realities are not presented to us specifically;\nand even if this were to happen, a judgement would still be impossible,\nbecause the criterion of the possibility of synthetical cognitions must\nbe sought for in the world of experience, to which the object of an\nidea cannot belong. And thus the celebrated Leibnitz has utterly failed\nin his attempt to establish upon \u00e0 priori grounds the possibility of\nthis sublime ideal being.\nThe celebrated ontological or Cartesian argument for the existence of a\nSupreme Being is therefore insufficient; and we may as well hope to\nincrease our stock of knowledge by the aid of mere ideas, as the\nmerchant to augment his wealth by the addition of noughts to his cash\naccount.\nSection V. Of the Impossibility of a Cosmological Proof of the\nExistence of God\nIt was by no means a natural course of proceeding, but, on the\ncontrary, an invention entirely due to the subtlety of the schools, to\nattempt to draw from a mere idea a proof of the existence of an object\ncorresponding to it. Such a course would never have been pursued, were\nit not for that need of reason which requires it to suppose the\nexistence of a necessary being as a basis for the empirical regress,\nand that, as this necessity must be unconditioned and \u00e0 priori, reason\nis bound to discover a conception which shall satisfy, if possible,\nthis requirement, and enable us to attain to the \u00e0 priori cognition of\nsuch a being. This conception was thought to be found in the idea of an\nens realissimum, and thus this idea was employed for the attainment of\na better defined knowledge of a necessary being, of the existence of\nwhich we were convinced, or persuaded, on other grounds. Thus reason\nwas seduced from her natural courage; and, instead of concluding with\nthe conception of an ens realissimum, an attempt was made to begin with\nit, for the purpose of inferring from it that idea of a necessary\nexistence which it was in fact called in to complete. Thus arose that\nunfortunate ontological argument, which neither satisfies the healthy\ncommon sense of humanity, nor sustains the scientific examination of\nthe philosopher.\nThe cosmological proof, which we are about to examine, retains the\nconnection between absolute necessity and the highest reality; but,\ninstead of reasoning from this highest reality to a necessary\nexistence, like the preceding argument, it concludes from the given\nunconditioned necessity of some being its unlimited reality. The track\nit pursues, whether rational or sophistical, is at least natural, and\nnot only goes far to persuade the common understanding, but shows\nitself deserving of respect from the speculative intellect; while it\ncontains, at the same time, the outlines of all the arguments employed\nin natural theology\u2014arguments which always have been, and still will\nbe, in use and authority. These, however adorned, and hid under\nwhatever embellishments of rhetoric and sentiment, are at bottom\nidentical with the arguments we are at present to discuss. This proof,\ntermed by Leibnitz the argumentum a contingentia mundi, I shall now lay\nbefore the reader, and subject to a strict examination.\nIt is framed in the following manner: If something exists, an\nabsolutely necessary being must likewise exist. Now I, at least, exist.\nConsequently, there exists an absolutely necessary being. The minor\ncontains an experience, the major reasons from a general experience to\nthe existence of a necessary being.[68] Thus this argument really\nbegins at experience, and is not completely \u00e0 priori, or ontological.\nThe object of all possible experience being the world, it is called the\ncosmological proof. It contains no reference to any peculiar property\nof sensuous objects, by which this world of sense might be\ndistinguished from other possible worlds; and in this respect it\ndiffers from the physico-theological proof, which is based upon the\nconsideration of the peculiar constitution of our sensuous world.\n[68] This inference is too well known to require more detailed\ndiscussion. It is based upon the spurious transcendental law of\ncausality, that everything which is contingent has a cause, which, if\nitself contingent, must also have a cause; and so on, till the series\nof subordinated causes must end with an absolutely necessary cause,\nwithout which it would not possess completeness.\nThe proof proceeds thus: A necessary being can be determined only in\none way, that is, it can be determined by only one of all possible\nopposed predicates; consequently, it must be completely determined in\nand by its conception. But there is only a single conception of a thing\npossible, which completely determines the thing \u00e0 priori: that is, the\nconception of the ens realissimum. It follows that the conception of\nthe ens realissimum is the only conception by and in which we can\ncogitate a necessary being. Consequently, a Supreme Being necessarily\nexists.\nIn this cosmological argument are assembled so many sophistical\npropositions that speculative reason seems to have exerted in it all\nher dialectical skill to produce a transcendental illusion of the most\nextreme character. We shall postpone an investigation of this argument\nfor the present, and confine ourselves to exposing the stratagem by\nwhich it imposes upon us an old argument in a new dress, and appeals to\nthe agreement of two witnesses, the one with the credentials of pure\nreason, and the other with those of empiricism; while, in fact, it is\nonly the former who has changed his dress and voice, for the purpose of\npassing himself off for an additional witness. That it may possess a\nsecure foundation, it bases its conclusions upon experience, and thus\nappears to be completely distinct from the ontological argument, which\nplaces its confidence entirely in pure \u00e0 priori conceptions. But this\nexperience merely aids reason in making one step\u2014to the existence of a\nnecessary being. What the properties of this being are cannot be\nlearned from experience; and therefore reason abandons it altogether,\nand pursues its inquiries in the sphere of pure conception, for the\npurpose of discovering what the properties of an absolutely necessary\nbeing ought to be, that is, what among all possible things contain the\nconditions (requisita) of absolute necessity. Reason believes that it\nhas discovered these requisites in the conception of an ens\nrealissimum\u2014and in it alone, and hence concludes: The ens realissimum\nis an absolutely necessary being. But it is evident that reason has\nhere presupposed that the conception of an ens realissimum is perfectly\nadequate to the conception of a being of absolute necessity, that is,\nthat we may infer the existence of the latter from that of the former\u2014a\nproposition which formed the basis of the ontological argument, and\nwhich is now employed in the support of the cosmological argument,\ncontrary to the wish and professions of its inventors. For the\nexistence of an absolutely necessary being is given in conceptions\nalone. But if I say: \u201cThe conception of the ens realissimum is a\nconception of this kind, and in fact the only conception which is\nadequate to our idea of a necessary being,\u201d I am obliged to admit, that\nthe latter may be inferred from the former. Thus it is properly the\nontological argument which figures in the cosmological, and constitutes\nthe whole strength of the latter; while the spurious basis of\nexperience has been of no further use than to conduct us to the\nconception of absolute necessity, being utterly insufficient to\ndemonstrate the presence of this attribute in any determinate existence\nor thing. For when we propose to ourselves an aim of this character, we\nmust abandon the sphere of experience, and rise to that of pure\nconceptions, which we examine with the purpose of discovering whether\nany one contains the conditions of the possibility of an absolutely\nnecessary being. But if the possibility of such a being is thus\ndemonstrated, its existence is also proved; for we may then assert\nthat, of all possible beings there is one which possesses the attribute\nof necessity\u2014in other words, this being possesses an absolutely\nnecessary existence.\nAll illusions in an argument are more easily detected when they are\npresented in the formal manner employed by the schools, which we now\nproceed to do.\nIf the proposition: \u201cEvery absolutely necessary being is likewise an\nens realissimum,\u201d is correct (and it is this which constitutes the\nnervus probandi of the cosmological argument), it must, like all\naffirmative judgements, be capable of conversion\u2014the conversio per\naccidens, at least. It follows, then, that some entia realissima are\nabsolutely necessary beings. But no ens realissimum is in any respect\ndifferent from another, and what is valid of some is valid of all. In\nthis present case, therefore, I may employ simple conversion, and say:\n\u201cEvery ens realissimum is a necessary being.\u201d But as this proposition\nis determined \u00e0 priori by the conceptions contained in it, the mere\nconception of an ens realissimum must possess the additional attribute\nof absolute necessity. But this is exactly what was maintained in the\nontological argument, and not recognized by the cosmological, although\nit formed the real ground of its disguised and illusory reasoning.\nThus the second mode employed by speculative reason of demonstrating\nthe existence of a Supreme Being, is not only, like the first, illusory\nand inadequate, but possesses the additional blemish of an ignoratio\nelenchi\u2014professing to conduct us by a new road to the desired goal, but\nbringing us back, after a short circuit, to the old path which we had\ndeserted at its call.\nI mentioned above that this cosmological argument contains a perfect\nnest of dialectical assumptions, which transcendental criticism does\nnot find it difficult to expose and to dissipate. I shall merely\nenumerate these, leaving it to the reader, who must by this time be\nwell practised in such matters, to investigate the fallacies residing\ntherein.\nThe following fallacies, for example, are discoverable in this mode of\nproof: 1. The transcendental principle: \u201cEverything that is contingent\nmust have a cause\u201d\u2014a principle without significance, except in the\nsensuous world. For the purely intellectual conception of the\ncontingent cannot produce any synthetical proposition, like that of\ncausality, which is itself without significance or distinguishing\ncharacteristic except in the phenomenal world. But in the present case\nit is employed to help us beyond the limits of its sphere. 2. \u201cFrom the\nimpossibility of an infinite ascending series of causes in the world of\nsense a first cause is inferred\u201d; a conclusion which the principles of\nthe employment of reason do not justify even in the sphere of\nexperience, and still less when an attempt is made to pass the limits\nof this sphere. 3. Reason allows itself to be satisfied upon\ninsufficient grounds, with regard to the completion of this series. It\nremoves all conditions (without which, however, no conception of\nNecessity can take place); and, as after this it is beyond our power to\nform any other conceptions, it accepts this as a completion of the\nconception it wishes to form of the series. 4. The logical possibility\nof a conception of the total of reality (the criterion of this\npossibility being the absence of contradiction) is confounded with the\ntranscendental, which requires a principle of the practicability of\nsuch a synthesis\u2014a principle which again refers us to the world of\nexperience. And so on.\nThe aim of the cosmological argument is to avoid the necessity of\nproving the existence of a necessary being priori from mere\nconceptions\u2014a proof which must be ontological, and of which we feel\nourselves quite incapable. With this purpose, we reason from an actual\nexistence\u2014an experience in general, to an absolutely necessary\ncondition of that existence. It is in this case unnecessary to\ndemonstrate its possibility. For after having proved that it exists,\nthe question regarding its possibility is superfluous. Now, when we\nwish to define more strictly the nature of this necessary being, we do\nnot look out for some being the conception of which would enable us to\ncomprehend the necessity of its being\u2014for if we could do this, an\nempirical presupposition would be unnecessary; no, we try to discover\nmerely the negative condition (conditio sine qua non), without which a\nbeing would not be absolutely necessary. Now this would be perfectly\nadmissible in every sort of reasoning, from a consequence to its\nprinciple; but in the present case it unfortunately happens that the\ncondition of absolute necessity can be discovered in but a single\nbeing, the conception of which must consequently contain all that is\nrequisite for demonstrating the presence of absolute necessity, and\nthus entitle me to infer this absolute necessity \u00e0 priori. That is, it\nmust be possible to reason conversely, and say: The thing, to which the\nconception of the highest reality belongs, is absolutely necessary. But\nif I cannot reason thus\u2014and I cannot, unless I believe in the\nsufficiency of the ontological argument\u2014I find insurmountable obstacles\nin my new path, and am really no farther than the point from which I\nset out. The conception of a Supreme Being satisfies all questions \u00e0\npriori regarding the internal determinations of a thing, and is for\nthis reason an ideal without equal or parallel, the general conception\nof it indicating it as at the same time an ens individuum among all\npossible things. But the conception does not satisfy the question\nregarding its existence\u2014which was the purpose of all our inquiries;\nand, although the existence of a necessary being were admitted, we\nshould find it impossible to answer the question: What of all things in\nthe world must be regarded as such?\nIt is certainly allowable to admit the existence of an all-sufficient\nbeing\u2014a cause of all possible effects\u2014for the purpose of enabling\nreason to introduce unity into its mode and grounds of explanation with\nregard to phenomena. But to assert that such a being necessarily\nexists, is no longer the modest enunciation of an admissible\nhypothesis, but the boldest declaration of an apodeictic certainty; for\nthe cognition of that which is absolutely necessary must itself possess\nthat character.\nThe aim of the transcendental ideal formed by the mind is either to\ndiscover a conception which shall harmonize with the idea of absolute\nnecessity, or a conception which shall contain that idea. If the one is\npossible, so is the other; for reason recognizes that alone as\nabsolutely necessary which is necessary from its conception. But both\nattempts are equally beyond our power\u2014we find it impossible to satisfy\nthe understanding upon this point, and as impossible to induce it to\nremain at rest in relation to this incapacity.\nUnconditioned necessity, which, as the ultimate support and stay of all\nexisting things, is an indispensable requirement of the mind, is an\nabyss on the verge of which human reason trembles in dismay. Even the\nidea of eternity, terrible and sublime as it is, as depicted by Haller,\ndoes not produce upon the mental vision such a feeling of awe and\nterror; for, although it measures the duration of things, it does not\nsupport them. We cannot bear, nor can we rid ourselves of the thought\nthat a being, which we regard as the greatest of all possible\nexistences, should say to himself: I am from eternity to eternity;\nbeside me there is nothing, except that which exists by my will; whence\nthen am I? Here all sinks away from under us; and the greatest, as the\nsmallest, perfection, hovers without stay or footing in presence of the\nspeculative reason, which finds it as easy to part with the one as with\nthe other.\nMany physical powers, which evidence their existence by their effects,\nare perfectly inscrutable in their nature; they elude all our powers of\nobservation. The transcendental object which forms the basis of\nphenomena, and, in connection with it, the reason why our sensibility\npossesses this rather than that particular kind of conditions, are and\nmust ever remain hidden from our mental vision; the fact is there, the\nreason of the fact we cannot see. But an ideal of pure reason cannot be\ntermed mysterious or inscrutable, because the only credential of its\nreality is the need of it felt by reason, for the purpose of giving\ncompleteness to the world of synthetical unity. An ideal is not even\ngiven as a cogitable object, and therefore cannot be inscrutable; on\nthe contrary, it must, as a mere idea, be based on the constitution of\nreason itself, and on this account must be capable of explanation and\nsolution. For the very essence of reason consists in its ability to\ngive an account, of all our conceptions, opinions, and assertions\u2014upon\nobjective, or, when they happen to be illusory and fallacious, upon\nsubjective grounds.\nDetection and Explanation of the Dialectical Illusion in all\nTranscendental Arguments for the Existence of a Necessary Being.\nBoth of the above arguments are transcendental; in other words, they do\nnot proceed upon empirical principles. For, although the cosmological\nargument professed to lay a basis of experience for its edifice of\nreasoning, it did not ground its procedure upon the peculiar\nconstitution of experience, but upon pure principles of reason\u2014in\nrelation to an existence given by empirical consciousness; utterly\nabandoning its guidance, however, for the purpose of supporting its\nassertions entirely upon pure conceptions. Now what is the cause, in\nthese transcendental arguments, of the dialectical, but natural,\nillusion, which connects the conceptions of necessity and supreme\nreality, and hypostatizes that which cannot be anything but an idea?\nWhat is the cause of this unavoidable step on the part of reason, of\nadmitting that some one among all existing things must be necessary,\nwhile it falls back from the assertion of the existence of such a being\nas from an abyss? And how does reason proceed to explain this anomaly\nto itself, and from the wavering condition of a timid and reluctant\napprobation\u2014always again withdrawn\u2014arrive at a calm and settled insight\ninto its cause?\nIt is something very remarkable that, on the supposition that something\nexists, I cannot avoid the inference that something exists necessarily.\nUpon this perfectly natural\u2014but not on that account reliable\u2014inference\ndoes the cosmological argument rest. But, let me form any conception\nwhatever of a thing, I find that I cannot cogitate the existence of the\nthing as absolutely necessary, and that nothing prevents me\u2014be the\nthing or being what it may\u2014from cogitating its non-existence. I may\nthus be obliged to admit that all existing things have a necessary\nbasis, while I cannot cogitate any single or individual thing as\nnecessary. In other words, I can never complete the regress through the\nconditions of existence, without admitting the existence of a necessary\nbeing; but, on the other hand, I cannot make a commencement from this\nbeing.\nIf I must cogitate something as existing necessarily as the basis of\nexisting things, and yet am not permitted to cogitate any individual\nthing as in itself necessary, the inevitable inference is that\nnecessity and contingency are not properties of things\nthemselves\u2014otherwise an internal contradiction would result; that\nconsequently neither of these principles are objective, but merely\nsubjective principles of reason\u2014the one requiring us to seek for a\nnecessary ground for everything that exists, that is, to be satisfied\nwith no other explanation than that which is complete \u00e0 priori, the\nother forbidding us ever to hope for the attainment of this\ncompleteness, that is, to regard no member of the empirical world as\nunconditioned. In this mode of viewing them, both principles, in their\npurely heuristic and regulative character, and as concerning merely the\nformal interest of reason, are quite consistent with each other. The\none says: \u201cYou must philosophize upon nature,\u201d as if there existed a\nnecessary primal basis of all existing things, solely for the purpose\nof introducing systematic unity into your knowledge, by pursuing an\nidea of this character\u2014a foundation which is arbitrarily admitted to be\nultimate; while the other warns you to consider no individual\ndetermination, concerning the existence of things, as such an ultimate\nfoundation, that is, as absolutely necessary, but to keep the way\nalways open for further progress in the deduction, and to treat every\ndetermination as determined by some other. But if all that we perceive\nmust be regarded as conditionally necessary, it is impossible that\nanything which is empirically given should be absolutely necessary.\nIt follows from this that you must accept the absolutely necessary as\nout of and beyond the world, inasmuch as it is useful only as a\nprinciple of the highest possible unity in experience, and you cannot\ndiscover any such necessary existence in the would, the second rule\nrequiring you to regard all empirical causes of unity as themselves\ndeduced.\nThe philosophers of antiquity regarded all the forms of nature as\ncontingent; while matter was considered by them, in accordance with the\njudgement of the common reason of mankind, as primal and necessary. But\nif they had regarded matter, not relatively\u2014as the substratum of\nphenomena, but absolutely and in itself\u2014as an independent existence,\nthis idea of absolute necessity would have immediately disappeared. For\nthere is nothing absolutely connecting reason with such an existence;\non the contrary, it can annihilate it in thought, always and without\nself-contradiction. But in thought alone lay the idea of absolute\nnecessity. A regulative principle must, therefore, have been at the\nfoundation of this opinion. In fact, extension and\nimpenetrability\u2014which together constitute our conception of matter\u2014form\nthe supreme empirical principle of the unity of phenomena, and this\nprinciple, in so far as it is empirically unconditioned, possesses the\nproperty of a regulative principle. But, as every determination of\nmatter which constitutes what is real in it\u2014and consequently\nimpenetrability\u2014is an effect, which must have a cause, and is for this\nreason always derived, the notion of matter cannot harmonize with the\nidea of a necessary being, in its character of the principle of all\nderived unity. For every one of its real properties, being derived,\nmust be only conditionally necessary, and can therefore be annihilated\nin thought; and thus the whole existence of matter can be so\nannihilated or suppressed. If this were not the case, we should have\nfound in the world of phenomena the highest ground or condition of\nunity\u2014which is impossible, according to the second regulative\nprinciple. It follows that matter, and, in general, all that forms part\nof the world of sense, cannot be a necessary primal being, nor even a\nprinciple of empirical unity, but that this being or principle must\nhave its place assigned without the world. And, in this way, we can\nproceed in perfect confidence to deduce the phenomena of the world and\ntheir existence from other phenomena, just as if there existed no\nnecessary being; and we can at the same time, strive without ceasing\ntowards the attainment of completeness for our deduction, just as if\nsuch a being\u2014the supreme condition of all existences\u2014were presupposed\nby the mind.\nThese remarks will have made it evident to the reader that the ideal of\nthe Supreme Being, far from being an enouncement of the existence of a\nbeing in itself necessary, is nothing more than a regulative principle\nof reason, requiring us to regard all connection existing between\nphenomena as if it had its origin from an all-sufficient necessary\ncause, and basing upon this the rule of a systematic and necessary\nunity in the explanation of phenomena. We cannot, at the same time,\navoid regarding, by a transcendental subreptio, this formal principle\nas constitutive, and hypostatizing this unity. Precisely similar is the\ncase with our notion of space. Space is the primal condition of all\nforms, which are properly just so many different limitations of it; and\nthus, although it is merely a principle of sensibility, we cannot help\nregarding it as an absolutely necessary and self-subsistent thing\u2014as an\nobject given \u00e0 priori in itself. In the same way, it is quite natural\nthat, as the systematic unity of nature cannot be established as a\nprinciple for the empirical employment of reason, unless it is based\nupon the idea of an ens realissimum, as the supreme cause, we should\nregard this idea as a real object, and this object, in its character of\nsupreme condition, as absolutely necessary, and that in this way a\nregulative should be transformed into a constitutive principle. This\ninterchange becomes evident when I regard this supreme being, which,\nrelatively to the world, was absolutely (unconditionally) necessary, as\na thing per se. In this case, I find it impossible to represent this\nnecessity in or by any conception, and it exists merely in my own mind,\nas the formal condition of thought, but not as a material and\nhypostatic condition of existence.\nSection VI. Of the Impossibility of a Physico-Theological Proof\nIf, then, neither a pure conception nor the general experience of an\nexisting being can provide a sufficient basis for the proof of the\nexistence of the Deity, we can make the attempt by the only other\nmode\u2014that of grounding our argument upon a determinate experience of\nthe phenomena of the present world, their constitution and disposition,\nand discover whether we can thus attain to a sound conviction of the\nexistence of a Supreme Being. This argument we shall term the\nphysico-theological argument. If it is shown to be insufficient,\nspeculative reason cannot present us with any satisfactory proof of the\nexistence of a being corresponding to our transcendental idea.\nIt is evident from the remarks that have been made in the preceding\nsections, that an answer to this question will be far from being\ndifficult or unconvincing. For how can any experience be adequate with\nan idea? The very essence of an idea consists in the fact that no\nexperience can ever be discovered congruent or adequate with it. The\ntranscendental idea of a necessary and all-sufficient being is so\nimmeasurably great, so high above all that is empirical, which is\nalways conditioned, that we hope in vain to find materials in the\nsphere of experience sufficiently ample for our conception, and in vain\nseek the unconditioned among things that are conditioned, while\nexamples, nay, even guidance is denied us by the laws of empirical\nsynthesis.\nIf the Supreme Being forms a link in the chain of empirical conditions,\nit must be a member of the empirical series, and, like the lower\nmembers which it precedes, have its origin in some higher member of the\nseries. If, on the other hand, we disengage it from the chain, and\ncogitate it as an intelligible being, apart from the series of natural\ncauses\u2014how shall reason bridge the abyss that separates the latter from\nthe former? All laws respecting the regress from effects to causes, all\nsynthetical additions to our knowledge relate solely to possible\nexperience and the objects of the sensuous world, and, apart from them,\nare without significance.\nThe world around us opens before our view so magnificent a spectacle of\norder, variety, beauty, and conformity to ends, that whether we pursue\nour observations into the infinity of space in the one direction, or\ninto its illimitable divisions in the other, whether we regard the\nworld in its greatest or its least manifestations\u2014even after we have\nattained to the highest summit of knowledge which our weak minds can\nreach, we find that language in the presence of wonders so\ninconceivable has lost its force, and number its power to reckon, nay,\neven thought fails to conceive adequately, and our conception of the\nwhole dissolves into an astonishment without power of expression\u2014all\nthe more eloquent that it is dumb. Everywhere around us we observe a\nchain of causes and effects, of means and ends, of death and birth;\nand, as nothing has entered of itself into the condition in which we\nfind it, we are constantly referred to some other thing, which itself\nsuggests the same inquiry regarding its cause, and thus the universe\nmust sink into the abyss of nothingness, unless we admit that, besides\nthis infinite chain of contingencies, there exists something that is\nprimal and self-subsistent\u2014something which, as the cause of this\nphenomenal world, secures its continuance and preservation.\nThis highest cause\u2014what magnitude shall we attribute to it? Of the\ncontent of the world we are ignorant; still less can we estimate its\nmagnitude by comparison with the sphere of the possible. But this\nsupreme cause being a necessity of the human mind, what is there to\nprevent us from attributing to it such a degree of perfection as to\nplace it above the sphere of all that is possible? This we can easily\ndo, although only by the aid of the faint outline of an abstract\nconception, by representing this being to ourselves as containing in\nitself, as an individual substance, all possible perfection\u2014a\nconception which satisfies that requirement of reason which demands\nparsimony in principles, which is free from self-contradiction, which\neven contributes to the extension of the employment of reason in\nexperience, by means of the guidance afforded by this idea to order and\nsystem, and which in no respect conflicts with any law of experience.\nThis argument always deserves to be mentioned with respect. It is the\noldest, the clearest, and that most in conformity with the common\nreason of humanity. It animates the study of nature, as it itself\nderives its existence and draws ever new strength from that source. It\nintroduces aims and ends into a sphere in which our observation could\nnot of itself have discovered them, and extends our knowledge of\nnature, by directing our attention to a unity, the principle of which\nlies beyond nature. This knowledge of nature again reacts upon this\nidea\u2014its cause; and thus our belief in a divine author of the universe\nrises to the power of an irresistible conviction.\nFor these reasons it would be utterly hopeless to attempt to rob this\nargument of the authority it has always enjoyed. The mind, unceasingly\nelevated by these considerations, which, although empirical, are so\nremarkably powerful, and continually adding to their force, will not\nsuffer itself to be depressed by the doubts suggested by subtle\nspeculation; it tears itself out of this state of uncertainty, the\nmoment it casts a look upon the wondrous forms of nature and the\nmajesty of the universe, and rises from height to height, from\ncondition to condition, till it has elevated itself to the supreme and\nunconditioned author of all.\nBut although we have nothing to object to the reasonableness and\nutility of this procedure, but have rather to commend and encourage it,\nwe cannot approve of the claims which this argument advances to\ndemonstrative certainty and to a reception upon its own merits, apart\nfrom favour or support by other arguments. Nor can it injure the cause\nof morality to endeavour to lower the tone of the arrogant sophist, and\nto teach him that modesty and moderation which are the properties of a\nbelief that brings calm and content into the mind, without prescribing\nto it an unworthy subjection. I maintain, then, that the\nphysico-theological argument is insufficient of itself to prove the\nexistence of a Supreme Being, that it must entrust this to the\nontological argument\u2014to which it serves merely as an introduction, and\nthat, consequently, this argument contains the only possible ground of\nproof (possessed by speculative reason) for the existence of this\nbeing.\nThe chief momenta in the physico-theological argument are as follow: 1.\nWe observe in the world manifest signs of an arrangement full of\npurpose, executed with great wisdom, and argument in whole of a content\nindescribably various, and of an extent without limits. 2. This\narrangement of means and ends is entirely foreign to the things\nexisting in the world\u2014it belongs to them merely as a contingent\nattribute; in other words, the nature of different things could not of\nitself, whatever means were employed, harmoniously tend towards certain\npurposes, were they not chosen and directed for these purposes by a\nrational and disposing principle, in accordance with certain\nfundamental ideas. 3. There exists, therefore, a sublime and wise cause\n(or several), which is not merely a blind, all-powerful nature,\nproducing the beings and events which fill the world in unconscious\nfecundity, but a free and intelligent cause of the world. 4. The unity\nof this cause may be inferred from the unity of the reciprocal relation\nexisting between the parts of the world, as portions of an artistic\nedifice\u2014an inference which all our observation favours, and all\nprinciples of analogy support.\nIn the above argument, it is inferred from the analogy of certain\nproducts of nature with those of human art, when it compels Nature to\nbend herself to its purposes, as in the case of a house, a ship, or a\nwatch, that the same kind of causality\u2014namely, understanding and\nwill\u2014resides in nature. It is also declared that the internal\npossibility of this freely-acting nature (which is the source of all\nart, and perhaps also of human reason) is derivable from another and\nsuperhuman art\u2014a conclusion which would perhaps be found incapable of\nstanding the test of subtle transcendental criticism. But to neither of\nthese opinions shall we at present object. We shall only remark that it\nmust be confessed that, if we are to discuss the subject of cause at\nall, we cannot proceed more securely than with the guidance of the\nanalogy subsisting between nature and such products of design\u2014these\nbeing the only products whose causes and modes of organization are\ncompletely known to us. Reason would be unable to satisfy her own\nrequirements, if she passed from a causality which she does know, to\nobscure and indemonstrable principles of explanation which she does not\nknow.\nAccording to the physico-theological argument, the connection and\nharmony existing in the world evidence the contingency of the form\nmerely, but not of the matter, that is, of the substance of the world.\nTo establish the truth of the latter opinion, it would be necessary to\nprove that all things would be in themselves incapable of this harmony\nand order, unless they were, even as regards their substance, the\nproduct of a supreme wisdom. But this would require very different\ngrounds of proof from those presented by the analogy with human art.\nThis proof can at most, therefore, demonstrate the existence of an\narchitect of the world, whose efforts are limited by the capabilities\nof the material with which he works, but not of a creator of the world,\nto whom all things are subject. Thus this argument is utterly\ninsufficient for the task before us\u2014a demonstration of the existence of\nan all-sufficient being. If we wish to prove the contingency of matter,\nwe must have recourse to a transcendental argument, which the\nphysico-theological was constructed expressly to avoid.\nWe infer, from the order and design visible in the universe, as a\ndisposition of a thoroughly contingent character, the existence of a\ncause proportionate thereto. The conception of this cause must contain\ncertain determinate qualities, and it must therefore be regarded as the\nconception of a being which possesses all power, wisdom, and so on, in\none word, all perfection\u2014the conception, that is, of an all-sufficient\nbeing. For the predicates of very great, astonishing, or immeasurable\npower and excellence, give us no determinate conception of the thing,\nnor do they inform us what the thing may be in itself. They merely\nindicate the relation existing between the magnitude of the object and\nthe observer, who compares it with himself and with his own power of\ncomprehension, and are mere expressions of praise and reverence, by\nwhich the object is either magnified, or the observing subject\ndepreciated in relation to the object. Where we have to do with the\nmagnitude (of the perfection) of a thing, we can discover no\ndeterminate conception, except that which comprehends all possible\nperfection or completeness, and it is only the total (omnitudo) of\nreality which is completely determined in and through its conception\nalone.\nNow it cannot be expected that any one will be bold enough to declare\nthat he has a perfect insight into the relation which the magnitude of\nthe world he contemplates bears (in its extent as well as in its\ncontent) to omnipotence, into that of the order and design in the world\nto the highest wisdom, and that of the unity of the world to the\nabsolute unity of a Supreme Being. Physico-theology is therefore\nincapable of presenting a determinate conception of a supreme cause of\nthe world, and is therefore insufficient as a principle of theology\u2014a\ntheology which is itself to be the basis of religion.\nThe attainment of absolute totality is completely impossible on the\npath of empiricism. And yet this is the path pursued in the\nphysico-theological argument. What means shall we employ to bridge the\nabyss?\nAfter elevating ourselves to admiration of the magnitude of the power,\nwisdom, and other attributes of the author of the world, and finding we\ncan advance no further, we leave the argument on empirical grounds, and\nproceed to infer the contingency of the world from the order and\nconformity to aims that are observable in it. From this contingency we\ninfer, by the help of transcendental conceptions alone, the existence\nof something absolutely necessary; and, still advancing, proceed from\nthe conception of the absolute necessity of the first cause to the\ncompletely determined or determining conception thereof\u2014the conception\nof an all-embracing reality. Thus the physico-theological, failing in\nits undertaking, recurs in its embarrassment to the cosmological\nargument; and, as this is merely the ontological argument in disguise,\nit executes its design solely by the aid of pure reason, although it at\nfirst professed to have no connection with this faculty and to base its\nentire procedure upon experience alone.\nThe physico-theologians have therefore no reason to regard with such\ncontempt the transcendental mode of argument, and to look down upon it,\nwith the conceit of clear-sighted observers of nature, as the\nbrain-cobweb of obscure speculatists. For, if they reflect upon and\nexamine their own arguments, they will find that, after following for\nsome time the path of nature and experience, and discovering themselves\nno nearer their object, they suddenly leave this path and pass into the\nregion of pure possibility, where they hope to reach upon the wings of\nideas what had eluded all their empirical investigations. Gaining, as\nthey think, a firm footing after this immense leap, they extend their\ndeterminate conception\u2014into the possession of which they have come,\nthey know not how\u2014over the whole sphere of creation, and explain their\nideal, which is entirely a product of pure reason, by illustrations\ndrawn from experience\u2014though in a degree miserably unworthy of the\ngrandeur of the object, while they refuse to acknowledge that they have\narrived at this cognition or hypothesis by a very different road from\nthat of experience.\nThus the physico-theological is based upon the cosmological, and this\nupon the ontological proof of the existence of a Supreme Being; and as\nbesides these three there is no other path open to speculative reason,\nthe ontological proof, on the ground of pure conceptions of reason, is\nthe only possible one, if any proof of a proposition so far\ntranscending the empirical exercise of the understanding is possible at\nall.\nSection VII. Critique of all Theology based upon Speculative Principles\nof Reason\nIf by the term theology I understand the cognition of a primal being,\nthat cognition is based either upon reason alone (theologia rationalis)\nor upon revelation (theologia revelata). The former cogitates its\nobject either by means of pure transcendental conceptions, as an ens\noriginarium, realissimum, ens entium, and is termed transcendental\ntheology; or, by means of a conception derived from the nature of our\nown mind, as a supreme intelligence, and must then be entitled natural\ntheology. The person who believes in a transcendental theology alone,\nis termed a deist; he who acknowledges the possibility of a natural\ntheology also, a theist. The former admits that we can cognize by pure\nreason alone the existence of a Supreme Being, but at the same time\nmaintains that our conception of this being is purely transcendental,\nand that all we can say of it is that it possesses all reality, without\nbeing able to define it more closely. The second asserts that reason is\ncapable of presenting us, from the analogy with nature, with a more\ndefinite conception of this being, and that its operations, as the\ncause of all things, are the results of intelligence and free will. The\nformer regards the Supreme Being as the cause of the world\u2014whether by\nthe necessity of his nature, or as a free agent, is left undetermined;\nthe latter considers this being as the author of the world.\nTranscendental theology aims either at inferring the existence of a\nSupreme Being from a general experience, without any closer reference\nto the world to which this experience belongs, and in this case it is\ncalled cosmotheology; or it endeavours to cognize the existence of such\na being, through mere conceptions, without the aid of experience, and\nis then termed ontotheology.\nNatural theology infers the attributes and the existence of an author\nof the world, from the constitution of, the order and unity observable\nin, the world, in which two modes of causality must be admitted to\nexist\u2014those of nature and freedom. Thus it rises from this world to a\nsupreme intelligence, either as the principle of all natural, or of all\nmoral order and perfection. In the former case it is termed\nphysico-theology, in the latter, ethical or moral-theology.[69]\n[69] Not theological ethics; for this science contains ethical laws,\nwhich presuppose the existence of a Supreme Governor of the world;\nwhile moral-theology, on the contrary, is the expression of a\nconviction of the existence of a Supreme Being, founded upon ethical\nlaws.\nAs we are wont to understand by the term God not merely an eternal\nnature, the operations of which are insensate and blind, but a Supreme\nBeing, who is the free and intelligent author of all things, and as it\nis this latter view alone that can be of interest to humanity, we\nmight, in strict rigour, deny to the deist any belief in God at all,\nand regard him merely as a maintainer of the existence of a primal\nbeing or thing\u2014the supreme cause of all other things. But, as no one\nought to be blamed, merely because he does not feel himself justified\nin maintaining a certain opinion, as if he altogether denied its truth\nand asserted the opposite, it is more correct\u2014as it is less harsh\u2014to\nsay, the deist believes in a God, the theist in a living God (summa\nintelligentia). We shall now proceed to investigate the sources of all\nthese attempts of reason to establish the existence of a Supreme Being.\nIt may be sufficient in this place to define theoretical knowledge or\ncognition as knowledge of that which is, and practical knowledge as\nknowledge of that which ought to be. In this view, the theoretical\nemployment of reason is that by which I cognize \u00e0 priori (as necessary)\nthat something is, while the practical is that by which I cognize \u00e0\npriori what ought to happen. Now, if it is an indubitably certain,\nthough at the same time an entirely conditioned truth, that something\nis, or ought to happen, either a certain determinate condition of this\ntruth is absolutely necessary, or such a condition may be arbitrarily\npresupposed. In the former case the condition is postulated (per\nthesin), in the latter supposed (per hypothesin). There are certain\npractical laws\u2014those of morality\u2014which are absolutely necessary. Now,\nif these laws necessarily presuppose the existence of some being, as\nthe condition of the possibility of their obligatory power, this being\nmust be postulated, because the conditioned, from which we reason to\nthis determinate condition, is itself cognized \u00e0 priori as absolutely\nnecessary. We shall at some future time show that the moral laws not\nmerely presuppose the existence of a Supreme Being, but also, as\nthemselves absolutely necessary in a different relation, demand or\npostulate it\u2014although only from a practical point of view. The\ndiscussion of this argument we postpone for the present.\nWhen the question relates merely to that which is, not to that which\nought to be, the conditioned which is presented in experience is always\ncogitated as contingent. For this reason its condition cannot be\nregarded as absolutely necessary, but merely as relatively necessary,\nor rather as needful; the condition is in itself and \u00e0 priori a mere\narbitrary presupposition in aid of the cognition, by reason, of the\nconditioned. If, then, we are to possess a theoretical cognition of the\nabsolute necessity of a thing, we cannot attain to this cognition\notherwise than \u00e0 priori by means of conceptions; while it is impossible\nin this way to cognize the existence of a cause which bears any\nrelation to an existence given in experience.\nTheoretical cognition is speculative when it relates to an object or\ncertain conceptions of an object which is not given and cannot be\ndiscovered by means of experience. It is opposed to the cognition of\nnature, which concerns only those objects or predicates which can be\npresented in a possible experience.\nThe principle that everything which happens (the empirically\ncontingent) must have a cause, is a principle of the cognition of\nnature, but not of speculative cognition. For, if we change it into an\nabstract principle, and deprive it of its reference to experience and\nthe empirical, we shall find that it cannot with justice be regarded\nany longer as a synthetical proposition, and that it is impossible to\ndiscover any mode of transition from that which exists to something\nentirely different\u2014termed cause. Nay, more, the conception of a cause\nlikewise that of the contingent\u2014loses, in this speculative mode of\nemploying it, all significance, for its objective reality and meaning\nare comprehensible from experience alone.\nWhen from the existence of the universe and the things in it the\nexistence of a cause of the universe is inferred, reason is proceeding\nnot in the natural, but in the speculative method. For the principle of\nthe former enounces, not that things themselves or substances, but only\nthat which happens or their states\u2014as empirically contingent, have a\ncause: the assertion that the existence of substance itself is\ncontingent is not justified by experience, it is the assertion of a\nreason employing its principles in a speculative manner. If, again, I\ninfer from the form of the universe, from the way in which all things\nare connected and act and react upon each other, the existence of a\ncause entirely distinct from the universe\u2014this would again be a\njudgement of purely speculative reason; because the object in this\ncase\u2014the cause\u2014can never be an object of possible experience. In both\nthese cases the principle of causality, which is valid only in the\nfield of experience\u2014useless and even meaningless beyond this region,\nwould be diverted from its proper destination.\nNow I maintain that all attempts of reason to establish a theology by\nthe aid of speculation alone are fruitless, that the principles of\nreason as applied to nature do not conduct us to any theological\ntruths, and, consequently, that a rational theology can have no\nexistence, unless it is founded upon the laws of morality. For all\nsynthetical principles of the understanding are valid only as immanent\nin experience; while the cognition of a Supreme Being necessitates\ntheir being employed transcendentally, and of this the understanding is\nquite incapable. If the empirical law of causality is to conduct us to\na Supreme Being, this being must belong to the chain of empirical\nobjects\u2014in which case it would be, like all phenomena, itself\nconditioned. If the possibility of passing the limits of experience be\nadmitted, by means of the dynamical law of the relation of an effect to\nits cause, what kind of conception shall we obtain by this procedure?\nCertainly not the conception of a Supreme Being, because experience\nnever presents us with the greatest of all possible effects, and it is\nonly an effect of this character that could witness to the existence of\na corresponding cause. If, for the purpose of fully satisfying the\nrequirements of Reason, we recognize her right to assert the existence\nof a perfect and absolutely necessary being, this can be admitted only\nfrom favour, and cannot be regarded as the result of irresistible\ndemonstration. The physico-theological proof may add weight to\nothers\u2014if other proofs there are\u2014by connecting speculation with\nexperience; but in itself it rather prepares the mind for theological\ncognition, and gives it a right and natural direction, than establishes\na sure foundation for theology.\nIt is now perfectly evident that transcendental questions admit only of\ntranscendental answers\u2014those presented \u00e0 priori by pure conceptions\nwithout the least empirical admixture. But the question in the present\ncase is evidently synthetical\u2014it aims at the extension of our cognition\nbeyond the bounds of experience\u2014it requires an assurance respecting the\nexistence of a being corresponding with the idea in our minds, to which\nno experience can ever be adequate. Now it has been abundantly proved\nthat all \u00e0 priori synthetical cognition is possible only as the\nexpression of the formal conditions of a possible experience; and that\nthe validity of all principles depends upon their immanence in the\nfield of experience, that is, their relation to objects of empirical\ncognition or phenomena. Thus all transcendental procedure in reference\nto speculative theology is without result.\nIf any one prefers doubting the conclusiveness of the proofs of our\nanalytic to losing the persuasion of the validity of these old and time\nhonoured arguments, he at least cannot decline answering the\nquestion\u2014how he can pass the limits of all possible experience by the\nhelp of mere ideas. If he talks of new arguments, or of improvements\nupon old arguments, I request him to spare me. There is certainly no\ngreat choice in this sphere of discussion, as all speculative arguments\nmust at last look for support to the ontological, and I have,\ntherefore, very little to fear from the argumentative fecundity of the\ndogmatical defenders of a non-sensuous reason. Without looking upon\nmyself as a remarkably combative person, I shall not decline the\nchallenge to detect the fallacy and destroy the pretensions of every\nattempt of speculative theology. And yet the hope of better fortune\nnever deserts those who are accustomed to the dogmatical mode of\nprocedure. I shall, therefore, restrict myself to the simple and\nequitable demand that such reasoners will demonstrate, from the nature\nof the human mind as well as from that of the other sources of\nknowledge, how we are to proceed to extend our cognition completely \u00e0\npriori, and to carry it to that point where experience abandons us, and\nno means exist of guaranteeing the objective reality of our\nconceptions. In whatever way the understanding may have attained to a\nconception, the existence of the object of the conception cannot be\ndiscovered in it by analysis, because the cognition of the existence of\nthe object depends upon the object\u2019s being posited and given in itself\napart from the conception. But it is utterly impossible to go beyond\nour conception, without the aid of experience\u2014which presents to the\nmind nothing but phenomena, or to attain by the help of mere\nconceptions to a conviction of the existence of new kinds of objects or\nsupernatural beings.\nBut although pure speculative reason is far from sufficient to\ndemonstrate the existence of a Supreme Being, it is of the highest\nutility in correcting our conception of this being\u2014on the supposition\nthat we can attain to the cognition of it by some other means\u2014in making\nit consistent with itself and with all other conceptions of\nintelligible objects, clearing it from all that is incompatible with\nthe conception of an ens summun, and eliminating from it all\nlimitations or admixtures of empirical elements.\nTranscendental theology is still therefore, notwithstanding its\nobjective insufficiency, of importance in a negative respect; it is\nuseful as a test of the procedure of reason when engaged with pure\nideas, no other than a transcendental standard being in this case\nadmissible. For if, from a practical point of view, the hypothesis of a\nSupreme and All-sufficient Being is to maintain its validity without\nopposition, it must be of the highest importance to define this\nconception in a correct and rigorous manner\u2014as the transcendental\nconception of a necessary being, to eliminate all phenomenal elements\n(anthropomorphism in its most extended signification), and at the same\ntime to overflow all contradictory assertions\u2014be they atheistic,\ndeistic, or anthropomorphic. This is of course very easy; as the same\narguments which demonstrated the inability of human reason to affirm\nthe existence of a Supreme Being must be alike sufficient to prove the\ninvalidity of its denial. For it is impossible to gain from the pure\nspeculation of reason demonstration that there exists no Supreme Being,\nas the ground of all that exists, or that this being possesses none of\nthose properties which we regard as analogical with the dynamical\nqualities of a thinking being, or that, as the anthropomorphists would\nhave us believe, it is subject to all the limitations which sensibility\nimposes upon those intelligences which exist in the world of\nexperience.\nA Supreme Being is, therefore, for the speculative reason, a mere\nideal, though a faultless one\u2014a conception which perfects and crowns\nthe system of human cognition, but the objective reality of which can\nneither be proved nor disproved by pure reason. If this defect is ever\nsupplied by a moral theology, the problematic transcendental theology\nwhich has preceded, will have been at least serviceable as\ndemonstrating the mental necessity existing for the conception, by the\ncomplete determination of it which it has furnished, and the ceaseless\ntesting of the conclusions of a reason often deceived by sense, and not\nalways in harmony with its own ideas. The attributes of necessity,\ninfinitude, unity, existence apart from the world (and not as a world\nsoul), eternity (free from conditions of time), omnipresence (free from\nconditions of space), omnipotence, and others, are pure transcendental\npredicates; and thus the accurate conception of a Supreme Being, which\nevery theology requires, is furnished by transcendental theology alone.\nAPPENDIX. Of the Regulative Employment of the Ideas of Pure Reason\nThe result of all the dialectical attempts of pure reason not only\nconfirms the truth of what we have already proved in our Transcendental\nAnalytic, namely, that all inferences which would lead us beyond the\nlimits of experience are fallacious and groundless, but it at the same\ntime teaches us this important lesson, that human reason has a natural\ninclination to overstep these limits, and that transcendental ideas are\nas much the natural property of the reason as categories are of the\nunderstanding. There exists this difference, however, that while the\ncategories never mislead us, outward objects being always in perfect\nharmony therewith, ideas are the parents of irresistible illusions, the\nseverest and most subtle criticism being required to save us from the\nfallacies which they induce.\nWhatever is grounded in the nature of our powers will be found to be in\nharmony with the final purpose and proper employment of these powers,\nwhen once we have discovered their true direction and aim. We are\nentitled to suppose, therefore, that there exists a mode of employing\ntranscendental ideas which is proper and immanent; although, when we\nmistake their meaning, and regard them as conceptions of actual things,\ntheir mode of application is transcendent and delusive. For it is not\nthe idea itself, but only the employment of the idea in relation to\npossible experience, that is transcendent or immanent. An idea is\nemployed transcendently, when it is applied to an object falsely\nbelieved to be adequate with and to correspond to it; immanently, when\nit is applied solely to the employment of the understanding in the\nsphere of experience. Thus all errors of subreptio\u2014of misapplication,\nare to be ascribed to defects of judgement, and not to understanding or\nreason.\nReason never has an immediate relation to an object; it relates\nimmediately to the understanding alone. It is only through the\nunderstanding that it can be employed in the field of experience. It\ndoes not form conceptions of objects, it merely arranges them and gives\nto them that unity which they are capable of possessing when the sphere\nof their application has been extended as widely as possible. Reason\navails itself of the conception of the understanding for the sole\npurpose of producing totality in the different series. This totality\nthe understanding does not concern itself with; its only occupation is\nthe connection of experiences, by which series of conditions in\naccordance with conceptions are established. The object of reason is,\ntherefore, the understanding and its proper destination. As the latter\nbrings unity into the diversity of objects by means of its conceptions,\nso the former brings unity into the diversity of conceptions by means\nof ideas; as it sets the final aim of a collective unity to the\noperations of the understanding, which without this occupies itself\nwith a distributive unity alone.\nI accordingly maintain that transcendental ideas can never be employed\nas constitutive ideas, that they cannot be conceptions of objects, and\nthat, when thus considered, they assume a fallacious and dialectical\ncharacter. But, on the other hand, they are capable of an admirable and\nindispensably necessary application to objects\u2014as regulative ideas,\ndirecting the understanding to a certain aim, the guiding lines towards\nwhich all its laws follow, and in which they all meet in one point.\nThis point\u2014though a mere idea (focus imaginarius), that is, not a point\nfrom which the conceptions of the understanding do really proceed, for\nit lies beyond the sphere of possible experience\u2014serves,\nnotwithstanding, to give to these conceptions the greatest possible\nunity combined with the greatest possible extension. Hence arises the\nnatural illusion which induces us to believe that these lines proceed\nfrom an object which lies out of the sphere of empirical cognition,\njust as objects reflected in a mirror appear to be behind it. But this\nillusion\u2014which we may hinder from imposing upon us\u2014is necessary and\nunavoidable, if we desire to see, not only those objects which lie\nbefore us, but those which are at a great distance behind us; that is\nto say, when, in the present case, we direct the aims of the\nunderstanding, beyond every given experience, towards an extension as\ngreat as can possibly be attained.\nIf we review our cognitions in their entire extent, we shall find that\nthe peculiar business of reason is to arrange them into a system, that\nis to say, to give them connection according to a principle. This unity\npresupposes an idea\u2014the idea of the form of a whole (of cognition),\npreceding the determinate cognition of the parts, and containing the\nconditions which determine \u00e0 priori to every part its place and\nrelation to the other parts of the whole system. This idea,\naccordingly, demands complete unity in the cognition of the\nunderstanding\u2014not the unity of a contingent aggregate, but that of a\nsystem connected according to necessary laws. It cannot be affirmed\nwith propriety that this idea is a conception of an object; it is\nmerely a conception of the complete unity of the conceptions of\nobjects, in so far as this unity is available to the understanding as a\nrule. Such conceptions of reason are not derived from nature; on the\ncontrary, we employ them for the interrogation and investigation of\nnature, and regard our cognition as defective so long as it is not\nadequate to them. We admit that such a thing as pure earth, pure water,\nor pure air, is not to be discovered. And yet we require these\nconceptions (which have their origin in the reason, so far as regards\ntheir absolute purity and completeness) for the purpose of determining\nthe share which each of these natural causes has in every phenomenon.\nThus the different kinds of matter are all referred to earths, as mere\nweight; to salts and inflammable bodies, as pure force; and finally, to\nwater and air, as the vehicula of the former, or the machines employed\nby them in their operations\u2014for the purpose of explaining the chemical\naction and reaction of bodies in accordance with the idea of a\nmechanism. For, although not actually so expressed, the influence of\nsuch ideas of reason is very observable in the procedure of natural\nphilosophers.\nIf reason is the faculty of deducing the particular from the general,\nand if the general be certain in se and given, it is only necessary\nthat the judgement should subsume the particular under the general, the\nparticular being thus necessarily determined. I shall term this the\ndemonstrative or apodeictic employment of reason. If, however, the\ngeneral is admitted as problematical only, and is a mere idea, the\nparticular case is certain, but the universality of the rule which\napplies to this particular case remains a problem. Several particular\ncases, the certainty of which is beyond doubt, are then taken and\nexamined, for the purpose of discovering whether the rule is applicable\nto them; and if it appears that all the particular cases which can be\ncollected follow from the rule, its universality is inferred, and at\nthe same time, all the causes which have not, or cannot be presented to\nour observation, are concluded to be of the same character with those\nwhich we have observed. This I shall term the hypothetical employment\nof the reason.\nThe hypothetical exercise of reason by the aid of ideas employed as\nproblematical conceptions is properly not constitutive. That is to say,\nif we consider the subject strictly, the truth of the rule, which has\nbeen employed as an hypothesis, does not follow from the use that is\nmade of it by reason. For how can we know all the possible cases that\nmay arise? some of which may, however, prove exceptions to the\nuniversality of the rule. This employment of reason is merely\nregulative, and its sole aim is the introduction of unity into the\naggregate of our particular cognitions, and thereby the approximating\nof the rule to universality.\nThe object of the hypothetical employment of reason is therefore the\nsystematic unity of cognitions; and this unity is the criterion of the\ntruth of a rule. On the other hand, this systematic unity\u2014as a mere\nidea\u2014is in fact merely a unity projected, not to be regarded as given,\nbut only in the light of a problem\u2014a problem which serves, however, as\na principle for the various and particular exercise of the\nunderstanding in experience, directs it with regard to those cases\nwhich are not presented to our observation, and introduces harmony and\nconsistency into all its operations.\nAll that we can be certain of from the above considerations is that\nthis systematic unity is a logical principle, whose aim is to assist\nthe understanding, where it cannot of itself attain to rules, by means\nof ideas, to bring all these various rules under one principle, and\nthus to ensure the most complete consistency and connection that can be\nattained. But the assertion that objects and the understanding by which\nthey are cognized are so constituted as to be determined to systematic\nunity, that this may be postulated \u00e0 priori, without any reference to\nthe interest of reason, and that we are justified in declaring all\npossible cognitions\u2014empirical and others\u2014to possess systematic unity,\nand to be subject to general principles from which, notwithstanding\ntheir various character, they are all derivable,\u2014such an assertion can\nbe founded only upon a transcendental principle of reason, which would\nrender this systematic unity not subjectively and logically\u2014in its\ncharacter of a method, but objectively necessary.\nWe shall illustrate this by an example. The conceptions of the\nunderstanding make us acquainted, among many other kinds of unity, with\nthat of the causality of a substance, which is termed power. The\ndifferent phenomenal manifestations of the same substance appear at\nfirst view to be so very dissimilar that we are inclined to assume the\nexistence of just as many different powers as there are different\neffects\u2014as, in the case of the human mind, we have feeling,\nconsciousness, imagination, memory, wit, analysis, pleasure, desire and\nso on. Now we are required by a logical maxim to reduce these\ndifferences to as small a number as possible, by comparing them and\ndiscovering the hidden identity which exists. We must inquire, for\nexample, whether or not imagination (connected with consciousness),\nmemory, wit, and analysis are not merely different forms of\nunderstanding and reason. The idea of a fundamental power, the\nexistence of which no effort of logic can assure us of, is the problem\nto be solved, for the systematic representation of the existing variety\nof powers. The logical principle of reason requires us to produce as\ngreat a unity as is possible in the system of our cognitions; and the\nmore the phenomena of this and the other power are found to be\nidentical, the more probable does it become, that they are nothing but\ndifferent manifestations of one and the same power, which may be\ncalled, relatively speaking, a fundamental power. And so with other\ncases.\nThese relatively fundamental powers must again be compared with each\nother, to discover, if possible, the one radical and absolutely\nfundamental power of which they are but the manifestations. But this\nunity is purely hypothetical. It is not maintained, that this unity\ndoes really exist, but that we must, in the interest of reason, that\nis, for the establishment of principles for the various rules presented\nby experience, try to discover and introduce it, so far as is\npracticable, into the sphere of our cognitions.\nBut the transcendental employment of the understanding would lead us to\nbelieve that this idea of a fundamental power is not problematical, but\nthat it possesses objective reality, and thus the systematic unity of\nthe various powers or forces in a substance is demanded by the\nunderstanding and erected into an apodeictic or necessary principle.\nFor, without having attempted to discover the unity of the various\npowers existing in nature, nay, even after all our attempts have\nfailed, we notwithstanding presuppose that it does exist, and may be,\nsooner or later, discovered. And this reason does, not only, as in the\ncase above adduced, with regard to the unity of substance, but where\nmany substances, although all to a certain extent homogeneous, are\ndiscoverable, as in the case of matter in general. Here also does\nreason presuppose the existence of the systematic unity of various\npowers\u2014inasmuch as particular laws of nature are subordinate to general\nlaws; and parsimony in principles is not merely an economical principle\nof reason, but an essential law of nature.\nWe cannot understand, in fact, how a logical principle of unity can of\nright exist, unless we presuppose a transcendental principle, by which\nsuch a systematic unit\u2014as a property of objects themselves\u2014is regarded\nas necessary \u00e0 priori. For with what right can reason, in its logical\nexercise, require us to regard the variety of forces which nature\ndisplays, as in effect a disguised unity, and to deduce them from one\nfundamental force or power, when she is free to admit that it is just\nas possible that all forces should be different in kind, and that a\nsystematic unity is not conformable to the design of nature? In this\nview of the case, reason would be proceeding in direct opposition to\nher own destination, by setting as an aim an idea which entirely\nconflicts with the procedure and arrangement of nature. Neither can we\nassert that reason has previously inferred this unity from the\ncontingent nature of phenomena. For the law of reason which requires us\nto seek for this unity is a necessary law, inasmuch as without it we\nshould not possess a faculty of reason, nor without reason a consistent\nand self-accordant mode of employing the understanding, nor, in the\nabsence of this, any proper and sufficient criterion of empirical\ntruth. In relation to this criterion, therefore, we must suppose the\nidea of the systematic unity of nature to possess objective validity\nand necessity.\nWe find this transcendental presupposition lurking in different forms\nin the principles of philosophers, although they have neither\nrecognized it nor confessed to themselves its presence. That the\ndiversities of individual things do not exclude identity of species,\nthat the various species must be considered as merely different\ndeterminations of a few genera, and these again as divisions of still\nhigher races, and so on\u2014that, accordingly, a certain systematic unity\nof all possible empirical conceptions, in so far as they can be deduced\nfrom higher and more general conceptions, must be sought for, is a\nscholastic maxim or logical principle, without which reason could not\nbe employed by us. For we can infer the particular from the general,\nonly in so far as general properties of things constitute the\nfoundation upon which the particular rest.\nThat the same unity exists in nature is presupposed by philosophers in\nthe well-known scholastic maxim, which forbids us unnecessarily to\naugment the number of entities or principles (entia praeter\nnecessitatem non esse multiplicanda). This maxim asserts that nature\nherself assists in the establishment of this unity of reason, and that\nthe seemingly infinite diversity of phenomena should not deter us from\nthe expectation of discovering beneath this diversity a unity of\nfundamental properties, of which the aforesaid variety is but a more or\nless determined form. This unity, although a mere idea, thinkers have\nfound it necessary rather to moderate the desire than to encourage it.\nIt was considered a great step when chemists were able to reduce all\nsalts to two main genera\u2014acids and alkalis; and they regard this\ndifference as itself a mere variety, or different manifestation of one\nand the same fundamental material. The different kinds of earths\n(stones and even metals) chemists have endeavoured to reduce to three,\nand afterwards to two; but still, not content with this advance, they\ncannot but think that behind these diversities there lurks but one\ngenus\u2014nay, that even salts and earths have a common principle. It might\nbe conjectured that this is merely an economical plan of reason, for\nthe purpose of sparing itself trouble, and an attempt of a purely\nhypothetical character, which, when successful, gives an appearance of\nprobability to the principle of explanation employed by the reason. But\na selfish purpose of this kind is easily to be distinguished from the\nidea, according to which every one presupposes that this unity is in\naccordance with the laws of nature, and that reason does not in this\ncase request, but requires, although we are quite unable to determine\nthe proper limits of this unity.\nIf the diversity existing in phenomena\u2014a diversity not of form (for in\nthis they may be similar) but of content\u2014were so great that the\nsubtlest human reason could never by comparison discover in them the\nleast similarity (which is not impossible), in this case the logical\nlaw of genera would be without foundation, the conception of a genus,\nnay, all general conceptions would be impossible, and the faculty of\nthe understanding, the exercise of which is restricted to the world of\nconceptions, could not exist. The logical principle of genera,\naccordingly, if it is to be applied to nature (by which I mean objects\npresented to our senses), presupposes a transcendental principle. In\naccordance with this principle, homogeneity is necessarily presupposed\nin the variety of phenomena (although we are unable to determine \u00e0\npriori the degree of this homogeneity), because without it no empirical\nconceptions, and consequently no experience, would be possible.\nThe logical principle of genera, which demands identity in phenomena,\nis balanced by another principle\u2014that of species, which requires\nvariety and diversity in things, notwithstanding their accordance in\nthe same genus, and directs the understanding to attend to the one no\nless than to the other. This principle (of the faculty of distinction)\nacts as a check upon the reason and reason exhibits in this respect a\ndouble and conflicting interest\u2014on the one hand, the interest in the\nextent (the interest of generality) in relation to genera; on the\nother, that of the content (the interest of individuality) in relation\nto the variety of species. In the former case, the understanding\ncogitates more under its conceptions, in the latter it cogitates more\nin them. This distinction manifests itself likewise in the habits of\nthought peculiar to natural philosophers, some of whom\u2014the remarkably\nspeculative heads\u2014may be said to be hostile to heterogeneity in\nphenomena, and have their eyes always fixed on the unity of genera,\nwhile others\u2014with a strong empirical tendency\u2014aim unceasingly at the\nanalysis of phenomena, and almost destroy in us the hope of ever being\nable to estimate the character of these according to general\nprinciples.\nThe latter mode of thought is evidently based upon a logical principle,\nthe aim of which is the systematic completeness of all cognitions. This\nprinciple authorizes me, beginning at the genus, to descend to the\nvarious and diverse contained under it; and in this way extension, as\nin the former case unity, is assured to the system. For if we merely\nexamine the sphere of the conception which indicates a genus, we cannot\ndiscover how far it is possible to proceed in the division of that\nsphere; just as it is impossible, from the consideration of the space\noccupied by matter, to determine how far we can proceed in the division\nof it. Hence every genus must contain different species, and these\nagain different subspecies; and as each of the latter must itself\ncontain a sphere (must be of a certain extent, as a conceptus\ncommunis), reason demands that no species or sub-species is to be\nconsidered as the lowest possible. For a species or sub-species, being\nalways a conception, which contains only what is common to a number of\ndifferent things, does not completely determine any individual thing,\nor relate immediately to it, and must consequently contain other\nconceptions, that is, other sub-species under it. This law of\nspecification may be thus expressed: entium varietates non temere sunt\nminuendae.\nBut it is easy to see that this logical law would likewise be without\nsense or application, were it not based upon a transcendental law of\nspecification, which certainly does not require that the differences\nexisting in phenomena should be infinite in number, for the logical\nprinciple, which merely maintains the indeterminateness of the logical\nsphere of a conception, in relation to its possible division, does not\nauthorize this statement; while it does impose upon the understanding\nthe duty of searching for subspecies to every species, and minor\ndifferences in every difference. For, were there no lower conceptions,\nneither could there be any higher. Now the understanding cognizes only\nby means of conceptions; consequently, how far soever it may proceed in\ndivision, never by mere intuition, but always by lower and lower\nconceptions. The cognition of phenomena in their complete determination\n(which is possible only by means of the understanding) requires an\nunceasingly continued specification of conceptions, and a progression\nto ever smaller differences, of which abstraction had been made in the\nconception of the species, and still more in that of the genus.\nThis law of specification cannot be deduced from experience; it can\nnever present us with a principle of so universal an application.\nEmpirical specification very soon stops in its distinction of\ndiversities, and requires the guidance of the transcendental law, as a\nprinciple of the reason\u2014a law which imposes on us the necessity of\nnever ceasing in our search for differences, even although these may\nnot present themselves to the senses. That absorbent earths are of\ndifferent kinds could only be discovered by obeying the anticipatory\nlaw of reason, which imposes upon the understanding the task of\ndiscovering the differences existing between these earths, and supposes\nthat nature is richer in substances than our senses would indicate. The\nfaculty of the understanding belongs to us just as much under the\npresupposition of differences in the objects of nature, as under the\ncondition that these objects are homogeneous, because we could not\npossess conceptions, nor make any use of our understanding, were not\nthe phenomena included under these conceptions in some respects\ndissimilar, as well as similar, in their character.\nReason thus prepares the sphere of the understanding for the operations\nof this faculty: 1. By the principle of the homogeneity of the diverse\nin higher genera; 2. By the principle of the variety of the homogeneous\nin lower species; and, to complete the systematic unity, it adds, 3. A\nlaw of the affinity of all conceptions which prescribes a continuous\ntransition from one species to every other by the gradual increase of\ndiversity. We may term these the principles of the homogeneity, the\nspecification, and the continuity of forms. The latter results from the\nunion of the two former, inasmuch as we regard the systematic\nconnection as complete in thought, in the ascent to higher genera, as\nwell as in the descent to lower species. For all diversities must be\nrelated to each other, as they all spring from one highest genus,\ndescending through the different gradations of a more and more extended\ndetermination.\nWe may illustrate the systematic unity produced by the three logical\nprinciples in the following manner. Every conception may be regarded as\na point, which, as the standpoint of a spectator, has a certain\nhorizon, which may be said to enclose a number of things that may be\nviewed, so to speak, from that centre. Within this horizon there must\nbe an infinite number of other points, each of which has its own\nhorizon, smaller and more circumscribed; in other words, every species\ncontains sub-species, according to the principle of specification, and\nthe logical horizon consists of smaller horizons (subspecies), but not\nof points (individuals), which possess no extent. But different\nhorizons or genera, which include under them so many conceptions, may\nhave one common horizon, from which, as from a mid-point, they may be\nsurveyed; and we may proceed thus, till we arrive at the highest genus,\nor universal and true horizon, which is determined by the highest\nconception, and which contains under itself all differences and\nvarieties, as genera, species, and subspecies.\nTo this highest standpoint I am conducted by the law of homogeneity, as\nto all lower and more variously-determined conceptions by the law of\nspecification. Now as in this way there exists no void in the whole\nextent of all possible conceptions, and as out of the sphere of these\nthe mind can discover nothing, there arises from the presupposition of\nthe universal horizon above mentioned, and its complete division, the\nprinciple: Non datur vacuum formarum. This principle asserts that there\nare not different primitive and highest genera, which stand isolated,\nso to speak, from each other, but all the various genera are mere\ndivisions and limitations of one highest and universal genus; and hence\nfollows immediately the principle: Datur continuum formarum. This\nprinciple indicates that all differences of species limit each other,\nand do not admit of transition from one to another by a saltus, but\nonly through smaller degrees of the difference between the one species\nand the other. In one word, there are no species or sub-species which\n(in the view of reason) are the nearest possible to each other;\nintermediate species or sub-species being always possible, the\ndifference of which from each of the former is always smaller than the\ndifference existing between these.\nThe first law, therefore, directs us to avoid the notion that there\nexist different primal genera, and enounces the fact of perfect\nhomogeneity; the second imposes a check upon this tendency to unity and\nprescribes the distinction of sub-species, before proceeding to apply\nour general conceptions to individuals. The third unites both the\nformer, by enouncing the fact of homogeneity as existing even in the\nmost various diversity, by means of the gradual transition from one\nspecies to another. Thus it indicates a relationship between the\ndifferent branches or species, in so far as they all spring from the\nsame stem.\nBut this logical law of the continuum specierum (formarum logicarum)\npresupposes a transcendental principle (lex continui in natura),\nwithout which the understanding might be led into error, by following\nthe guidance of the former, and thus perhaps pursuing a path contrary\nto that prescribed by nature. This law must, consequently, be based\nupon pure transcendental, and not upon empirical, considerations. For,\nin the latter case, it would come later than the system; whereas it is\nreally itself the parent of all that is systematic in our cognition of\nnature. These principles are not mere hypotheses employed for the\npurpose of experimenting upon nature; although when any such connection\nis discovered, it forms a solid ground for regarding the hypothetical\nunity as valid in the sphere of nature\u2014and thus they are in this\nrespect not without their use. But we go farther, and maintain that it\nis manifest that these principles of parsimony in fundamental causes,\nvariety in effects, and affinity in phenomena, are in accordance both\nwith reason and nature, and that they are not mere methods or plans\ndevised for the purpose of assisting us in our observation of the\nexternal world.\nBut it is plain that this continuity of forms is a mere idea, to which\nno adequate object can be discovered in experience. And this for two\nreasons. First, because the species in nature are really divided, and\nhence form quanta discreta; and, if the gradual progression through\ntheir affinity were continuous, the intermediate members lying between\ntwo given species must be infinite in number, which is impossible.\nSecondly, because we cannot make any determinate empirical use of this\nlaw, inasmuch as it does not present us with any criterion of affinity\nwhich could aid us in determining how far we ought to pursue the\ngraduation of differences: it merely contains a general indication that\nit is our duty to seek for and, if possible, to discover them.\nWhen we arrange these principles of systematic unity in the order\nconformable to their employment in experience, they will stand thus:\nVariety, Affinity, Unity, each of them, as ideas, being taken in the\nhighest degree of their completeness. Reason presupposes the existence\nof cognitions of the understanding, which have a direct relation to\nexperience, and aims at the ideal unity of these cognitions\u2014a unity\nwhich far transcends all experience or empirical notions. The affinity\nof the diverse, notwithstanding the differences existing between its\nparts, has a relation to things, but a still closer one to the mere\nproperties and powers of things. For example, imperfect experience may\nrepresent the orbits of the planets as circular. But we discover\nvariations from this course, and we proceed to suppose that the planets\nrevolve in a path which, if not a circle, is of a character very\nsimilar to it. That is to say, the movements of those planets which do\nnot form a circle will approximate more or less to the properties of a\ncircle, and probably form an ellipse. The paths of comets exhibit still\ngreater variations, for, so far as our observation extends, they do not\nreturn upon their own course in a circle or ellipse. But we proceed to\nthe conjecture that comets describe a parabola, a figure which is\nclosely allied to the ellipse. In fact, a parabola is merely an\nellipse, with its longer axis produced to an indefinite extent. Thus\nthese principles conduct us to a unity in the genera of the forms of\nthese orbits, and, proceeding farther, to a unity as regards the cause\nof the motions of the heavenly bodies\u2014that is, gravitation. But we go\non extending our conquests over nature, and endeavour to explain all\nseeming deviations from these rules, and even make additions to our\nsystem which no experience can ever substantiate\u2014for example, the\ntheory, in affinity with that of ellipses, of hyperbolic paths of\ncomets, pursuing which, these bodies leave our solar system and,\npassing from sun to sun, unite the most distant parts of the infinite\nuniverse, which is held together by the same moving power.\nThe most remarkable circumstance connected with these principles is\nthat they seem to be transcendental, and, although only containing\nideas for the guidance of the empirical exercise of reason, and\nalthough this empirical employment stands to these ideas in an\nasymptotic relation alone (to use a mathematical term), that is,\ncontinually approximate, without ever being able to attain to them,\nthey possess, notwithstanding, as \u00e0 priori synthetical propositions,\nobjective though undetermined validity, and are available as rules for\npossible experience. In the elaboration of our experience, they may\nalso be employed with great advantage, as heuristic[70] principles. A\ntranscendental deduction of them cannot be made; such a deduction being\nalways impossible in the case of ideas, as has been already shown.\n[70] From the Greek, eurhioko.\nWe distinguished, in the Transcendental Analytic, the dynamical\nprinciples of the understanding, which are regulative principles of\nintuition, from the mathematical, which are constitutive principles of\nintuition. These dynamical laws are, however, constitutive in relation\nto experience, inasmuch as they render the conceptions without which\nexperience could not exist possible \u00e0 priori. But the principles of\npure reason cannot be constitutive even in regard to empirical\nconceptions, because no sensuous schema corresponding to them can be\ndiscovered, and they cannot therefore have an object in concreto. Now,\nif I grant that they cannot be employed in the sphere of experience, as\nconstitutive principles, how shall I secure for them employment and\nobjective validity as regulative principles, and in what way can they\nbe so employed?\nThe understanding is the object of reason, as sensibility is the object\nof the understanding. The production of systematic unity in all the\nempirical operations of the understanding is the proper occupation of\nreason; just as it is the business of the understanding to connect the\nvarious content of phenomena by means of conceptions, and subject them\nto empirical laws. But the operations of the understanding are, without\nthe schemata of sensibility, undetermined; and, in the same manner, the\nunity of reason is perfectly undetermined as regards the conditions\nunder which, and the extent to which, the understanding ought to carry\nthe systematic connection of its conceptions. But, although it is\nimpossible to discover in intuition a schema for the complete\nsystematic unity of all the conceptions of the understanding, there\nmust be some analogon of this schema. This analogon is the idea of the\nmaximum of the division and the connection of our cognition in one\nprinciple. For we may have a determinate notion of a maximum and an\nabsolutely perfect, all the restrictive conditions which are connected\nwith an indeterminate and various content having been abstracted. Thus\nthe idea of reason is analogous with a sensuous schema, with this\ndifference, that the application of the categories to the schema of\nreason does not present a cognition of any object (as is the case with\nthe application of the categories to sensuous schemata), but merely\nprovides us with a rule or principle for the systematic unity of the\nexercise of the understanding. Now, as every principle which imposes\nupon the exercise of the understanding \u00e0 priori compliance with the\nrule of systematic unity also relates, although only in an indirect\nmanner, to an object of experience, the principles of pure reason will\nalso possess objective reality and validity in relation to experience.\nBut they will not aim at determining our knowledge in regard to any\nempirical object; they will merely indicate the procedure, following\nwhich the empirical and determinate exercise of the understanding may\nbe in complete harmony and connection with itself\u2014a result which is\nproduced by its being brought into harmony with the principle of\nsystematic unity, so far as that is possible, and deduced from it.\nI term all subjective principles, which are not derived from\nobservation of the constitution of an object, but from the interest\nwhich Reason has in producing a certain completeness in her cognition\nof that object, maxims of reason. Thus there are maxims of speculative\nreason, which are based solely upon its speculative interest, although\nthey appear to be objective principles.\nWhen principles which are really regulative are regarded as\nconstitutive, and employed as objective principles, contradictions must\narise; but if they are considered as mere maxims, there is no room for\ncontradictions of any kind, as they then merely indicate the different\ninterests of reason, which occasion differences in the mode of thought.\nIn effect, Reason has only one single interest, and the seeming\ncontradiction existing between her maxims merely indicates a difference\nin, and a reciprocal limitation of, the methods by which this interest\nis satisfied.\nThis reasoner has at heart the interest of diversity\u2014in accordance with\nthe principle of specification; another, the interest of unity\u2014in\naccordance with the principle of aggregation. Each believes that his\njudgement rests upon a thorough insight into the subject he is\nexamining, and yet it has been influenced solely by a greater or less\ndegree of adherence to some one of the two principles, neither of which\nare objective, but originate solely from the interest of reason, and on\nthis account to be termed maxims rather than principles. When I observe\nintelligent men disputing about the distinctive characteristics of men,\nanimals, or plants, and even of minerals, those on the one side\nassuming the existence of certain national characteristics, certain\nwell-defined and hereditary distinctions of family, race, and so on,\nwhile the other side maintain that nature has endowed all races of men\nwith the same faculties and dispositions, and that all differences are\nbut the result of external and accidental circumstances\u2014I have only to\nconsider for a moment the real nature of the subject of discussion, to\narrive at the conclusion that it is a subject far too deep for us to\njudge of, and that there is little probability of either party being\nable to speak from a perfect insight into and understanding of the\nnature of the subject itself. Both have, in reality, been struggling\nfor the twofold interest of reason; the one maintaining the one\ninterest, the other the other. But this difference between the maxims\nof diversity and unity may easily be reconciled and adjusted; although,\nso long as they are regarded as objective principles, they must\noccasion not only contradictions and polemic, but place hinderances in\nthe way of the advancement of truth, until some means is discovered of\nreconciling these conflicting interests, and bringing reason into union\nand harmony with itself.\nThe same is the case with the so-called law discovered by Leibnitz, and\nsupported with remarkable ability by Bonnet\u2014the law of the continuous\ngradation of created beings, which is nothing more than an inference\nfrom the principle of affinity; for observation and study of the order\nof nature could never present it to the mind as an objective truth. The\nsteps of this ladder, as they appear in experience, are too far apart\nfrom each other, and the so-called petty differences between different\nkinds of animals are in nature commonly so wide separations that no\nconfidence can be placed in such views (particularly when we reflect on\nthe great variety of things, and the ease with which we can discover\nresemblances), and no faith in the laws which are said to express the\naims and purposes of nature. On the other hand, the method of\ninvestigating the order of nature in the light of this principle, and\nthe maxim which requires us to regard this order\u2014it being still\nundetermined how far it extends\u2014as really existing in nature, is beyond\ndoubt a legitimate and excellent principle of reason\u2014a principle which\nextends farther than any experience or observation of ours and which,\nwithout giving us any positive knowledge of anything in the region of\nexperience, guides us to the goal of systematic unity.\n_Of the Ultimate End of the Natural Dialectic of Human Reason._\nThe ideas of pure reason cannot be, of themselves and in their own\nnature, dialectical; it is from their misemployment alone that\nfallacies and illusions arise. For they originate in the nature of\nreason itself, and it is impossible that this supreme tribunal for all\nthe rights and claims of speculation should be itself undeserving of\nconfidence and promotive of error. It is to be expected, therefore,\nthat these ideas have a genuine and legitimate aim. It is true, the mob\nof sophists raise against reason the cry of inconsistency and\ncontradiction, and affect to despise the government of that faculty,\nbecause they cannot understand its constitution, while it is to its\nbeneficial influences alone that they owe the position and the\nintelligence which enable them to criticize and to blame its procedure.\nWe cannot employ an \u00e0 priori conception with certainty, until we have\nmade a transcendental deduction therefore. The ideas of pure reason do\nnot admit of the same kind of deduction as the categories. But if they\nare to possess the least objective validity, and to represent anything\nbut mere creations of thought (entia rationis ratiocinantis), a\ndeduction of them must be possible. This deduction will complete the\ncritical task imposed upon pure reason; and it is to this part Of our\nlabours that we now proceed.\nThere is a great difference between a thing\u2019s being presented to the\nmind as an object in an absolute sense, or merely as an ideal object.\nIn the former case I employ my conceptions to determine the object; in\nthe latter case nothing is present to the mind but a mere schema, which\ndoes not relate directly to an object, not even in a hypothetical\nsense, but which is useful only for the purpose of representing other\nobjects to the mind, in a mediate and indirect manner, by means of\ntheir relation to the idea in the intellect. Thus I say the conception\nof a supreme intelligence is a mere idea; that is to say, its objective\nreality does not consist in the fact that it has an immediate relation\nto an object (for in this sense we have no means of establishing its\nobjective validity), it is merely a schema constructed according to the\nnecessary conditions of the unity of reason\u2014the schema of a thing in\ngeneral, which is useful towards the production of the highest degree\nof systematic unity in the empirical exercise of reason, in which we\ndeduce this or that object of experience from the imaginary object of\nthis idea, as the ground or cause of the said object of experience. In\nthis way, the idea is properly a heuristic, and not an ostensive,\nconception; it does not give us any information respecting the\nconstitution of an object, it merely indicates how, under the guidance\nof the idea, we ought to investigate the constitution and the relations\nof objects in the world of experience. Now, if it can be shown that the\nthree kinds of transcendental ideas (psychological, cosmological, and\ntheological), although not relating directly to any object nor\ndetermining it, do nevertheless, on the supposition of the existence of\nan ideal object, produce systematic unity in the laws of the empirical\nemployment of the reason, and extend our empirical cognition, without\never being inconsistent or in opposition with it\u2014it must be a necessary\nmaxim of reason to regulate its procedure according to these ideas. And\nthis forms the transcendental deduction of all speculative ideas, not\nas constitutive principles of the extension of our cognition beyond the\nlimits of our experience, but as regulative principles of the\nsystematic unity of empirical cognition, which is by the aid of these\nideas arranged and emended within its own proper limits, to an extent\nunattainable by the operation of the principles of the understanding\nalone.\nI shall make this plainer. Guided by the principles involved in these\nideas, we must, in the first place, so connect all the phenomena,\nactions, and feelings of the mind, as if it were a simple substance,\nwhich, endowed with personal identity, possesses a permanent existence\n(in this life at least), while its states, among which those of the\nbody are to be included as external conditions, are in continual\nchange. Secondly, in cosmology, we must investigate the conditions of\nall natural phenomena, internal as well as external, as if they\nbelonged to a chain infinite and without any prime or supreme member,\nwhile we do not, on this account, deny the existence of intelligible\ngrounds of these phenomena, although we never employ them to explain\nphenomena, for the simple reason that they are not objects of our\ncognition. Thirdly, in the sphere of theology, we must regard the whole\nsystem of possible experience as forming an absolute, but dependent and\nsensuously-conditioned unity, and at the same time as based upon a\nsole, supreme, and all-sufficient ground existing apart from the world\nitself\u2014a ground which is a self-subsistent, primeval and creative\nreason, in relation to which we so employ our reason in the field of\nexperience, as if all objects drew their origin from that archetype of\nall reason. In other words, we ought not to deduce the internal\nphenomena of the mind from a simple thinking substance, but deduce them\nfrom each other under the guidance of the regulative idea of a simple\nbeing; we ought not to deduce the phenomena, order, and unity of the\nuniverse from a supreme intelligence, but merely draw from this idea of\na supremely wise cause the rules which must guide reason in its\nconnection of causes and effects.\nNow there is nothing to hinder us from admitting these ideas to possess\nan objective and hyperbolic existence, except the cosmological ideas,\nwhich lead reason into an antinomy: the psychological and theological\nideas are not antinomial. They contain no contradiction; and how, then,\ncan any one dispute their objective reality, since he who denies it\nknows as little about their possibility as we who affirm? And yet, when\nwe wish to admit the existence of a thing, it is not sufficient to\nconvince ourselves that there is no positive obstacle in the way; for\nit cannot be allowable to regard mere creations of thought, which\ntranscend, though they do not contradict, all our conceptions, as real\nand determinate objects, solely upon the authority of a speculative\nreason striving to compass its own aims. They cannot, therefore, be\nadmitted to be real in themselves; they can only possess a comparative\nreality\u2014that of a schema of the regulative principle of the systematic\nunity of all cognition. They are to be regarded not as actual things,\nbut as in some measure analogous to them. We abstract from the object\nof the idea all the conditions which limit the exercise of our\nunderstanding, but which, on the other hand, are the sole conditions of\nour possessing a determinate conception of any given thing. And thus we\ncogitate a something, of the real nature of which we have not the least\nconception, but which we represent to ourselves as standing in a\nrelation to the whole system of phenomena, analogous to that in which\nphenomena stand to each other.\nBy admitting these ideal beings, we do not really extend our cognitions\nbeyond the objects of possible experience; we extend merely the\nempirical unity of our experience, by the aid of systematic unity, the\nschema of which is furnished by the idea, which is therefore valid\u2014not\nas a constitutive, but as a regulative principle. For although we posit\na thing corresponding to the idea\u2014a something, an actual existence\u2014we\ndo not on that account aim at the extension of our cognition by means\nof transcendent conceptions. This existence is purely ideal, and not\nobjective; it is the mere expression of the systematic unity which is\nto be the guide of reason in the field of experience. There are no\nattempts made at deciding what the ground of this unity may be, or what\nthe real nature of this imaginary being.\nThus the transcendental and only determinate conception of God, which\nis presented to us by speculative reason, is in the strictest sense\ndeistic. In other words, reason does not assure us of the objective\nvalidity of the conception; it merely gives us the idea of something,\non which the supreme and necessary unity of all experience is based.\nThis something we cannot, following the analogy of a real substance,\ncogitate otherwise than as the cause of all things operating in\naccordance with rational laws, if we regard it as an individual object;\nalthough we should rest contented with the idea alone as a regulative\nprinciple of reason, and make no attempt at completing the sum of the\nconditions imposed by thought. This attempt is, indeed, inconsistent\nwith the grand aim of complete systematic unity in the sphere of\ncognition\u2014a unity to which no bounds are set by reason.\nHence it happens that, admitting a divine being, I can have no\nconception of the internal possibility of its perfection, or of the\nnecessity of its existence. The only advantage of this admission is\nthat it enables me to answer all other questions relating to the\ncontingent, and to give reason the most complete satisfaction as\nregards the unity which it aims at attaining in the world of\nexperience. But I cannot satisfy reason with regard to this hypothesis\nitself; and this proves that it is not its intelligence and insight\ninto the subject, but its speculative interest alone which induces it\nto proceed from a point lying far beyond the sphere of our cognition,\nfor the purpose of being able to consider all objects as parts of a\nsystematic whole.\nHere a distinction presents itself, in regard to the way in which we\nmay cogitate a presupposition\u2014a distinction which is somewhat subtle,\nbut of great importance in transcendental philosophy. I may have\nsufficient grounds to admit something, or the existence of something,\nin a relative point of view (suppositio relativa), without being\njustified in admitting it in an absolute sense (suppositio absoluta).\nThis distinction is undoubtedly requisite, in the case of a regulative\nprinciple, the necessity of which we recognize, though we are ignorant\nof the source and cause of that necessity, and which we assume to be\nbased upon some ultimate ground, for the purpose of being able to\ncogitate the universality of the principle in a more determinate way.\nFor example, I cogitate the existence of a being corresponding to a\npure transcendental idea. But I cannot admit that this being exists\nabsolutely and in itself, because all of the conceptions by which I can\ncogitate an object in a determinate manner fall short of assuring me of\nits existence; nay, the conditions of the objective validity of my\nconceptions are excluded by the idea\u2014by the very fact of its being an\nidea. The conceptions of reality, substance, causality, nay, even that\nof necessity in existence, have no significance out of the sphere of\nempirical cognition, and cannot, beyond that sphere, determine any\nobject. They may, accordingly, be employed to explain the possibility\nof things in the world of sense, but they are utterly inadequate to\nexplain the possibility of the universe itself considered as a whole;\nbecause in this case the ground of explanation must lie out of and\nbeyond the world, and cannot, therefore, be an object of possible\nexperience. Now, I may admit the existence of an incomprehensible being\nof this nature\u2014the object of a mere idea, relatively to the world of\nsense; although I have no ground to admit its existence absolutely and\nin itself. For if an idea (that of a systematic and complete unity, of\nwhich I shall presently speak more particularly) lies at the foundation\nof the most extended empirical employment of reason, and if this idea\ncannot be adequately represented in concreto, although it is\nindispensably necessary for the approximation of empirical unity to the\nhighest possible degree\u2014I am not only authorized, but compelled, to\nrealize this idea, that is, to posit a real object corresponding\nthereto. But I cannot profess to know this object; it is to me merely a\nsomething, to which, as the ground of systematic unity in cognition, I\nattribute such properties as are analogous to the conceptions employed\nby the understanding in the sphere of experience. Following the analogy\nof the notions of reality, substance, causality, and necessity, I\ncogitate a being, which possesses all these attributes in the highest\ndegree; and, as this idea is the offspring of my reason alone, I\ncogitate this being as self-subsistent reason, and as the cause of the\nuniverse operating by means of ideas of the greatest possible harmony\nand unity. Thus I abstract all conditions that would limit my idea,\nsolely for the purpose of rendering systematic unity possible in the\nworld of empirical diversity, and thus securing the widest possible\nextension for the exercise of reason in that sphere. This I am enabled\nto do, by regarding all connections and relations in the world of\nsense, as if they were the dispositions of a supreme reason, of which\nour reason is but a faint image. I then proceed to cogitate this\nSupreme Being by conceptions which have, properly, no meaning or\napplication, except in the world of sense. But as I am authorized to\nemploy the transcendental hypothesis of such a being in a relative\nrespect alone, that is, as the substratum of the greatest possible\nunity in experience\u2014I may attribute to a being which I regard as\ndistinct from the world, such properties as belong solely to the sphere\nof sense and experience. For I do not desire, and am not justified in\ndesiring, to cognize this object of my idea, as it exists in itself;\nfor I possess no conceptions sufficient for this task, those of\nreality, substance, causality, nay, even that of necessity in\nexistence, losing all significance, and becoming merely the signs of\nconceptions, without content and without applicability, when I attempt\nto carry them beyond the limits of the world of sense. I cogitate\nmerely the relation of a perfectly unknown being to the greatest\npossible systematic unity of experience, solely for the purpose of\nemploying it as the schema of the regulative principle which directs\nreason in its empirical exercise.\nIt is evident, at the first view, that we cannot presuppose the reality\nof this transcendental object, by means of the conceptions of reality,\nsubstance, causality, and so on, because these conceptions cannot be\napplied to anything that is distinct from the world of sense. Thus the\nsupposition of a Supreme Being or cause is purely relative; it is\ncogitated only in behalf of the systematic unity of experience; such a\nbeing is but a something, of whose existence in itself we have not the\nleast conception. Thus, too, it becomes sufficiently manifest why we\nrequired the idea of a necessary being in relation to objects given by\nsense, although we can never have the least conception of this being,\nor of its absolute necessity.\nAnd now we can clearly perceive the result of our transcendental\ndialectic, and the proper aim of the ideas of pure reason\u2014which become\ndialectical solely from misunderstanding and inconsiderateness. Pure\nreason is, in fact, occupied with itself, and not with any object.\nObjects are not presented to it to be embraced in the unity of an\nempirical conception; it is only the cognitions of the understanding\nthat are presented to it, for the purpose of receiving the unity of a\nrational conception, that is, of being connected according to a\nprinciple. The unity of reason is the unity of system; and this\nsystematic unity is not an objective principle, extending its dominion\nover objects, but a subjective maxim, extending its authority over the\nempirical cognition of objects. The systematic connection which reason\ngives to the empirical employment of the understanding not only\nadvances the extension of that employment, but ensures its correctness,\nand thus the principle of a systematic unity of this nature is also\nobjective, although only in an indefinite respect (principium vagum).\nIt is not, however, a constitutive principle, determining an object to\nwhich it directly relates; it is merely a regulative principle or\nmaxim, advancing and strengthening the empirical exercise of reason, by\nthe opening up of new paths of which the understanding is ignorant,\nwhile it never conflicts with the laws of its exercise in the sphere of\nexperience.\nBut reason cannot cogitate this systematic unity, without at the same\ntime cogitating an object of the idea\u2014an object that cannot be\npresented in any experience, which contains no concrete example of a\ncomplete systematic unity. This being (ens rationis ratiocinatae) is\ntherefore a mere idea and is not assumed to be a thing which is real\nabsolutely and in itself. On the contrary, it forms merely the\nproblematical foundation of the connection which the mind introduces\namong the phenomena of the sensuous world. We look upon this\nconnection, in the light of the above-mentioned idea, as if it drew its\norigin from the supposed being which corresponds to the idea. And yet\nall we aim at is the possession of this idea as a secure foundation for\nthe systematic unity of experience\u2014a unity indispensable to reason,\nadvantageous to the understanding, and promotive of the interests of\nempirical cognition.\nWe mistake the true meaning of this idea when we regard it as an\nenouncement, or even as a hypothetical declaration of the existence of\na real thing, which we are to regard as the origin or ground of a\nsystematic constitution of the universe. On the contrary, it is left\ncompletely undetermined what the nature or properties of this so-called\nground may be. The idea is merely to be adopted as a point of view,\nfrom which this unity, so essential to reason and so beneficial to the\nunderstanding, may be regarded as radiating. In one word, this\ntranscendental thing is merely the schema of a regulative principle, by\nmeans of which Reason, so far as in her lies, extends the dominion of\nsystematic unity over the whole sphere of experience.\nThe first object of an idea of this kind is the ego, considered merely\nas a thinking nature or soul. If I wish to investigate the properties\nof a thinking being, I must interrogate experience. But I find that I\ncan apply none of the categories to this object, the schema of these\ncategories, which is the condition of their application, being given\nonly in sensuous intuition. But I cannot thus attain to the cognition\nof a systematic unity of all the phenomena of the internal sense.\nInstead, therefore, of an empirical conception of what the soul really\nis, reason takes the conception of the empirical unity of all thought,\nand, by cogitating this unity as unconditioned and primitive,\nconstructs the rational conception or idea of a simple substance which\nis in itself unchangeable, possessing personal identity, and in\nconnection with other real things external to it; in one word, it\nconstructs the idea of a simple self-subsistent intelligence. But the\nreal aim of reason in this procedure is the attainment of principles of\nsystematic unity for the explanation of the phenomena of the soul. That\nis, reason desires to be able to represent all the determinations of\nthe internal sense as existing in one subject, all powers as deduced\nfrom one fundamental power, all changes as mere varieties in the\ncondition of a being which is permanent and always the same, and all\nphenomena in space as entirely different in their nature from the\nprocedure of thought. Essential simplicity (with the other attributes\npredicated of the ego) is regarded as the mere schema of this\nregulative principle; it is not assumed that it is the actual ground of\nthe properties of the soul. For these properties may rest upon quite\ndifferent grounds, of which we are completely ignorant; just as the\nabove predicates could not give us any knowledge of the soul as it is\nin itself, even if we regarded them as valid in respect of it, inasmuch\nas they constitute a mere idea, which cannot be represented in\nconcreto. Nothing but good can result from a psychological idea of this\nkind, if we only take proper care not to consider it as more than an\nidea; that is, if we regard it as valid merely in relation to the\nemployment of reason, in the sphere of the phenomena of the soul. Under\nthe guidance of this idea, or principle, no empirical laws of corporeal\nphenomena are called in to explain that which is a phenomenon of the\ninternal sense alone; no windy hypotheses of the generation,\nannihilation, and palingenesis of souls are admitted. Thus the\nconsideration of this object of the internal sense is kept pure, and\nunmixed with heterogeneous elements; while the investigation of reason\naims at reducing all the grounds of explanation employed in this sphere\nof knowledge to a single principle. All this is best effected, nay,\ncannot be effected otherwise than by means of such a schema, which\nrequires us to regard this ideal thing as an actual existence. The\npsychological idea is, therefore, meaningless and inapplicable, except\nas the schema of a regulative conception. For, if I ask whether the\nsoul is not really of a spiritual nature\u2014it is a question which has no\nmeaning. From such a conception has been abstracted, not merely all\ncorporeal nature, but all nature, that is, all the predicates of a\npossible experience; and consequently, all the conditions which enable\nus to cogitate an object to this conception have disappeared. But, if\nthese conditions are absent, it is evident that the conception is\nmeaningless.\nThe second regulative idea of speculative reason is the conception of\nthe universe. For nature is properly the only object presented to us,\nin regard to which reason requires regulative principles. Nature is\ntwofold\u2014thinking and corporeal nature. To cogitate the latter in regard\nto its internal possibility, that is, to determine the application of\nthe categories to it, no idea is required\u2014no representation which\ntranscends experience. In this sphere, therefore, an idea is\nimpossible, sensuous intuition being our only guide; while, in the\nsphere of psychology, we require the fundamental idea (I), which\ncontains \u00e0 priori a certain form of thought namely, the unity of the\nego. Pure reason has, therefore, nothing left but nature in general,\nand the completeness of conditions in nature in accordance with some\nprinciple. The absolute totality of the series of these conditions is\nan idea, which can never be fully realized in the empirical exercise of\nreason, while it is serviceable as a rule for the procedure of reason\nin relation to that totality. It requires us, in the explanation of\ngiven phenomena (in the regress or ascent in the series), to proceed as\nif the series were infinite in itself, that is, were prolonged in\nindefinitum; while on the other hand, where reason is regarded as\nitself the determining cause (in the region of freedom), we are\nrequired to proceed as if we had not before us an object of sense, but\nof the pure understanding. In this latter case, the conditions do not\nexist in the series of phenomena, but may be placed quite out of and\nbeyond it, and the series of conditions may be regarded as if it had an\nabsolute beginning from an intelligible cause. All this proves that the\ncosmological ideas are nothing but regulative principles, and not\nconstitutive; and that their aim is not to realize an actual totality\nin such series. The full discussion of this subject will be found in\nits proper place in the chapter on the antinomy of pure reason.\nThe third idea of pure reason, containing the hypothesis of a being\nwhich is valid merely as a relative hypothesis, is that of the one and\nall-sufficient cause of all cosmological series, in other words, the\nidea of God. We have not the slightest ground absolutely to admit the\nexistence of an object corresponding to this idea; for what can empower\nor authorize us to affirm the existence of a being of the highest\nperfection\u2014a being whose existence is absolutely necessary\u2014merely\nbecause we possess the conception of such a being? The answer is: It is\nthe existence of the world which renders this hypothesis necessary. But\nthis answer makes it perfectly evident that the idea of this being,\nlike all other speculative ideas, is essentially nothing more than a\ndemand upon reason that it shall regulate the connection which it and\nits subordinate faculties introduce into the phenomena of the world by\nprinciples of systematic unity and, consequently, that it shall regard\nall phenomena as originating from one all-embracing being, as the\nsupreme and all-sufficient cause. From this it is plain that the only\naim of reason in this procedure is the establishment of its own formal\nrule for the extension of its dominion in the world of experience; that\nit does not aim at an extension of its cognition beyond the limits of\nexperience; and that, consequently, this idea does not contain any\nconstitutive principle.\nThe highest formal unity, which is based upon ideas alone, is the unity\nof all things\u2014a unity in accordance with an aim or purpose; and the\nspeculative interest of reason renders it necessary to regard all order\nin the world as if it originated from the intention and design of a\nsupreme reason. This principle unfolds to the view of reason in the\nsphere of experience new and enlarged prospects, and invites it to\nconnect the phenomena of the world according to teleological laws, and\nin this way to attain to the highest possible degree of systematic\nunity. The hypothesis of a supreme intelligence, as the sole cause of\nthe universe\u2014an intelligence which has for us no more than an ideal\nexistence\u2014is accordingly always of the greatest service to reason.\nThus, if we presuppose, in relation to the figure of the earth (which\nis round, but somewhat flattened at the poles),[71] or that of\nmountains or seas, wise designs on the part of an author of the\nuniverse, we cannot fail to make, by the light of this supposition, a\ngreat number of interesting discoveries. If we keep to this hypothesis,\nas a principle which is purely regulative, even error cannot be very\ndetrimental. For, in this case, error can have no more serious\nconsequences than that, where we expected to discover a teleological\nconnection (nexus finalis), only a mechanical or physical connection\nappears. In such a case, we merely fail to find the additional form of\nunity we expected, but we do not lose the rational unity which the mind\nrequires in its procedure in experience. But even a miscarriage of this\nsort cannot affect the law in its general and teleological relations.\nFor although we may convict an anatomist of an error, when he connects\nthe limb of some animal with a certain purpose, it is quite impossible\nto prove in a single case that any arrangement of nature, be it what it\nmay, is entirely without aim or design. And thus medical physiology, by\nthe aid of a principle presented to it by pure reason, extends its very\nlimited empirical knowledge of the purposes of the different parts of\nan organized body so far that it may be asserted with the utmost\nconfidence, and with the approbation of all reflecting men, that every\norgan or bodily part of an animal has its use and answers a certain\ndesign. Now, this is a supposition which, if regarded as of a\nconstitutive character, goes much farther than any experience or\nobservation of ours can justify. Hence it is evident that it is nothing\nmore than a regulative principle of reason, which aims at the highest\ndegree of systematic unity, by the aid of the idea of a causality\naccording to design in a supreme cause\u2014a cause which it regards as the\nhighest intelligence.\n[71] The advantages which a circular form, in the case of the earth,\nhas over every other, are well known. But few are aware that the\nslight flattening at the poles, which gives it the figure of a\nspheroid, is the only cause which prevents the elevations of\ncontinents or even of mountains, perhaps thrown up by some internal\nconvulsion, from continually altering the position of the axis of the\nearth\u2014and that to some considerable degree in a short time. The great\nprotuberance of the earth under the Equator serves to overbalance the\nimpetus of all other masses of earth, and thus to preserve the axis of\nthe earth, so far as we can observe, in its present position. And yet\nthis wise arrangement has been unthinkingly explained from the\nequilibrium of the formerly fluid mass.\nIf, however, we neglect this restriction of the idea to a purely\nregulative influence, reason is betrayed into numerous errors. For it\nhas then left the ground of experience, in which alone are to be found\nthe criteria of truth, and has ventured into the region of the\nincomprehensible and unsearchable, on the heights of which it loses its\npower and collectedness, because it has completely severed its\nconnection with experience.\nThe first error which arises from our employing the idea of a Supreme\nBeing as a constitutive (in repugnance to the very nature of an idea),\nand not as a regulative principle, is the error of inactive reason\n(ignava ratio).[72] We may so term every principle which requires us to\nregard our investigations of nature as absolutely complete, and allows\nreason to cease its inquiries, as if it had fully executed its task.\nThus the psychological idea of the ego, when employed as a constitutive\nprinciple for the explanation of the phenomena of the soul, and for the\nextension of our knowledge regarding this subject beyond the limits of\nexperience\u2014even to the condition of the soul after death\u2014is convenient\nenough for the purposes of pure reason, but detrimental and even\nruinous to its interests in the sphere of nature and experience. The\ndogmatizing spiritualist explains the unchanging unity of our\npersonality through all changes of condition from the unity of a\nthinking substance, the interest which we take in things and events\nthat can happen only after our death, from a consciousness of the\nimmaterial nature of our thinking subject, and so on. Thus he dispenses\nwith all empirical investigations into the cause of these internal\nphenomena, and with all possible explanations of them upon purely\nnatural grounds; while, at the dictation of a transcendent reason, he\npasses by the immanent sources of cognition in experience, greatly to\nhis own ease and convenience, but to the sacrifice of all, genuine\ninsight and intelligence. These prejudicial consequences become still\nmore evident, in the case of the dogmatical treatment of our idea of a\nSupreme Intelligence, and the theological system of nature\n(physico-theology) which is falsely based upon it. For, in this case,\nthe aims which we observe in nature, and often those which we merely\nfancy to exist, make the investigation of causes a very easy task, by\ndirecting us to refer such and such phenomena immediately to the\nunsearchable will and counsel of the Supreme Wisdom, while we ought to\ninvestigate their causes in the general laws of the mechanism of\nmatter. We are thus recommended to consider the labour of reason as\nended, when we have merely dispensed with its employment, which is\nguided surely and safely only by the order of nature and the series of\nchanges in the world\u2014which are arranged according to immanent and\ngeneral laws. This error may be avoided, if we do not merely consider\nfrom the view-point of final aims certain parts of nature, such as the\ndivision and structure of a continent, the constitution and direction\nof certain mountain-chains, or even the organization existing in the\nvegetable and animal kingdoms, but look upon this systematic unity of\nnature in a perfectly general way, in relation to the idea of a Supreme\nIntelligence. If we pursue this advice, we lay as a foundation for all\ninvestigation the conformity to aims of all phenomena of nature in\naccordance with universal laws, for which no particular arrangement of\nnature is exempt, but only cognized by us with more or less difficulty;\nand we possess a regulative principle of the systematic unity of a\nteleological connection, which we do not attempt to anticipate or\npredetermine. All that we do, and ought to do, is to follow out the\nphysico-mechanical connection in nature according to general laws, with\nthe hope of discovering, sooner or later, the teleological connection\nalso. Thus, and thus only, can the principle of final unity aid in the\nextension of the employment of reason in the sphere of experience,\nwithout being in any case detrimental to its interests.\n[72] This was the term applied by the old dialecticians to a\nsophistical argument, which ran thus: If it is your fate to die of\nthis disease, you will die, whether you employ a physician or not.\nCicero says that this mode of reasoning has received this appellation,\nbecause, if followed, it puts an end to the employment of reason in\nthe affairs of life. For a similar reason, I have applied this\ndesignation to the sophistical argument of pure reason.\nThe second error which arises from the misconception of the principle\nof systematic unity is that of perverted reason (perversa ratio,\nusteron roteron rationis). The idea of systematic unity is available as\na regulative principle in the connection of phenomena according to\ngeneral natural laws; and, how far soever we have to travel upon the\npath of experience to discover some fact or event, this idea requires\nus to believe that we have approached all the more nearly to the\ncompletion of its use in the sphere of nature, although that completion\ncan never be attained. But this error reverses the procedure of reason.\nWe begin by hypostatizing the principle of systematic unity, and by\ngiving an anthropomorphic determination to the conception of a Supreme\nIntelligence, and then proceed forcibly to impose aims upon nature.\nThus not only does teleology, which ought to aid in the completion of\nunity in accordance with general laws, operate to the destruction of\nits influence, but it hinders reason from attaining its proper aim,\nthat is, the proof, upon natural grounds, of the existence of a supreme\nintelligent cause. For, if we cannot presuppose supreme finality in\nnature \u00e0 priori, that is, as essentially belonging to nature, how can\nwe be directed to endeavour to discover this unity and, rising\ngradually through its different degrees, to approach the supreme\nperfection of an author of all\u2014a perfection which is absolutely\nnecessary, and therefore cognizable \u00e0 priori? The regulative principle\ndirects us to presuppose systematic unity absolutely and, consequently,\nas following from the essential nature of things\u2014but only as a unity of\nnature, not merely cognized empirically, but presupposed \u00e0 priori,\nalthough only in an indeterminate manner. But if I insist on basing\nnature upon the foundation of a supreme ordaining Being, the unity of\nnature is in effect lost. For, in this case, it is quite foreign and\nunessential to the nature of things, and cannot be cognized from the\ngeneral laws of nature. And thus arises a vicious circular argument,\nwhat ought to have been proved having been presupposed.\nTo take the regulative principle of systematic unity in nature for a\nconstitutive principle, and to hypostatize and make a cause out of that\nwhich is properly the ideal ground of the consistent and harmonious\nexercise of reason, involves reason in inextricable embarrassments. The\ninvestigation of nature pursues its own path under the guidance of the\nchain of natural causes, in accordance with the general laws of nature,\nand ever follows the light of the idea of an author of the universe\u2014not\nfor the purpose of deducing the finality, which it constantly pursues,\nfrom this Supreme Being, but to attain to the cognition of his\nexistence from the finality which it seeks in the existence of the\nphenomena of nature, and, if possible, in that of all things to cognize\nthis being, consequently, as absolutely necessary. Whether this latter\npurpose succeed or not, the idea is and must always be a true one, and\nits employment, when merely regulative, must always be accompanied by\ntruthful and beneficial results.\nComplete unity, in conformity with aims, constitutes absolute\nperfection. But if we do not find this unity in the nature of the\nthings which go to constitute the world of experience, that is, of\nobjective cognition, consequently in the universal and necessary laws\nof nature, how can we infer from this unity the idea of the supreme and\nabsolutely necessary perfection of a primal being, which is the origin\nof all causality? The greatest systematic unity, and consequently\nteleological unity, constitutes the very foundation of the possibility\nof the most extended employment of human reason. The idea of unity is\ntherefore essentially and indissolubly connected with the nature of our\nreason. This idea is a legislative one; and hence it is very natural\nthat we should assume the existence of a legislative reason\ncorresponding to it, from which the systematic unity of nature\u2014the\nobject of the operations of reason\u2014must be derived.\nIn the course of our discussion of the antinomies, we stated that it is\nalways possible to answer all the questions which pure reason may\nraise; and that the plea of the limited nature of our cognition, which\nis unavoidable and proper in many questions regarding natural\nphenomena, cannot in this case be admitted, because the questions\nraised do not relate to the nature of things, but are necessarily\noriginated by the nature of reason itself, and relate to its own\ninternal constitution. We can now establish this assertion, which at\nfirst sight appeared so rash, in relation to the two questions in which\nreason takes the greatest interest, and thus complete our discussion of\nthe dialectic of pure reason.\nIf, then, the question is asked, in relation to transcendental\ntheology,[73] first, whether there is anything distinct from the world,\nwhich contains the ground of cosmical order and connection according to\ngeneral laws? The answer is: Certainly. For the world is a sum of\nphenomena; there must, therefore, be some transcendental basis of these\nphenomena, that is, a basis cogitable by the pure understanding alone.\nIf, secondly, the question is asked whether this being is substance,\nwhether it is of the greatest reality, whether it is necessary, and so\nforth? I answer that this question is utterly without meaning. For all\nthe categories which aid me in forming a conception of an object cannot\nbe employed except in the world of sense, and are without meaning when\nnot applied to objects of actual or possible experience. Out of this\nsphere, they are not properly conceptions, but the mere marks or\nindices of conceptions, which we may admit, although they cannot,\nwithout the help of experience, help us to understand any subject or\nthing. If, thirdly, the question is whether we may not cogitate this\nbeing, which is distinct from the world, in analogy with the objects of\nexperience? The answer is: Undoubtedly, but only as an ideal, and not\nas a real object. That is, we must cogitate it only as an unknown\nsubstratum of the systematic unity, order, and finality of the world\u2014a\nunity which reason must employ as the regulative principle of its\ninvestigation of nature. Nay, more, we may admit into the idea certain\nanthropomorphic elements, which are promotive of the interests of this\nregulative principle. For it is no more than an idea, which does not\nrelate directly to a being distinct from the world, but to the\nregulative principle of the systematic unity of the world, by means,\nhowever, of a schema of this unity\u2014the schema of a Supreme\nIntelligence, who is the wisely-designing author of the universe. What\nthis basis of cosmical unity may be in itself, we know not\u2014we cannot\ndiscover from the idea; we merely know how we ought to employ the idea\nof this unity, in relation to the systematic operation of reason in the\nsphere of experience.\n[73] After what has been said of the psychological idea of the ego and\nits proper employment as a regulative principle of the operations of\nreason, I need not enter into details regarding the transcendental\nillusion by which the systematic unity of all the various phenomena of\nthe internal sense is hypostatized. The procedure is in this case very\nsimilar to that which has been discussed in our remarks on the\ntheological ideal.\nBut, it will be asked again, can we on these grounds, admit the\nexistence of a wise and omnipotent author of the world? Without doubt;\nand not only so, but we must assume the existence of such a being. But\ndo we thus extend the limits of our knowledge beyond the field of\npossible experience? By no means. For we have merely presupposed a\nsomething, of which we have no conception, which we do not know as it\nis in itself; but, in relation to the systematic disposition of the\nuniverse, which we must presuppose in all our observation of nature, we\nhave cogitated this unknown being in analogy with an intelligent\nexistence (an empirical conception), that is to say, we have endowed it\nwith those attributes, which, judging from the nature of our own\nreason, may contain the ground of such a systematic unity. This idea is\ntherefore valid only relatively to the employment in experience of our\nreason. But if we attribute to it absolute and objective validity, we\noverlook the fact that it is merely an ideal being that we cogitate;\nand, by setting out from a basis which is not determinable by\nconsiderations drawn from experience, we place ourselves in a position\nwhich incapacitates us from applying this principle to the empirical\nemployment of reason.\nBut, it will be asked further, can I make any use of this conception\nand hypothesis in my investigations into the world and nature? Yes, for\nthis very purpose was the idea established by reason as a fundamental\nbasis. But may I regard certain arrangements, which seemed to have been\nmade in conformity with some fixed aim, as the arrangements of design,\nand look upon them as proceeding from the divine will, with the\nintervention, however, of certain other particular arrangements\ndisposed to that end? Yes, you may do so; but at the same time you must\nregard it as indifferent, whether it is asserted that divine wisdom has\ndisposed all things in conformity with his highest aims, or that the\nidea of supreme wisdom is a regulative principle in the investigation\nof nature, and at the same time a principle of the systematic unity of\nnature according to general laws, even in those cases where we are\nunable to discover that unity. In other words, it must be perfectly\nindifferent to you whether you say, when you have discovered this\nunity: God has wisely willed it so; or: Nature has wisely arranged\nthis. For it was nothing but the systematic unity, which reason\nrequires as a basis for the investigation of nature, that justified you\nin accepting the idea of a supreme intelligence as a schema for a\nregulative principle; and, the farther you advance in the discovery of\ndesign and finality, the more certain the validity of your idea. But,\nas the whole aim of this regulative principle was the discovery of a\nnecessary and systematic unity in nature, we have, in so far as we\nattain this, to attribute our success to the idea of a Supreme Being;\nwhile, at the same time, we cannot, without involving ourselves in\ncontradictions, overlook the general laws of nature, as it was in\nreference to them alone that this idea was employed. We cannot, I say,\noverlook the general laws of nature, and regard this conformity to aims\nobservable in nature as contingent or hyperphysical in its origin;\ninasmuch as there is no ground which can justify us in the admission of\na being with such properties distinct from and above nature. All that\nwe are authorized to assert is that this idea may be employed as a\nprinciple, and that the properties of the being which is assumed to\ncorrespond to it may be regarded as systematically connected in analogy\nwith the causal determination of phenomena.\nFor the same reasons we are justified in introducing into the idea of\nthe supreme cause other anthropomorphic elements (for without these we\ncould not predicate anything of it); we may regard it as allowable to\ncogitate this cause as a being with understanding, the feelings of\npleasure and displeasure, and faculties of desire and will\ncorresponding to these. At the same time, we may attribute to this\nbeing infinite perfection\u2014a perfection which necessarily transcends\nthat which our knowledge of the order and design in the world authorize\nus to predicate of it. For the regulative law of systematic unity\nrequires us to study nature on the supposition that systematic and\nfinal unity in infinitum is everywhere discoverable, even in the\nhighest diversity. For, although we may discover little of this\ncosmical perfection, it belongs to the legislative prerogative of\nreason to require us always to seek for and to expect it; while it must\nalways be beneficial to institute all inquiries into nature in\naccordance with this principle. But it is evident that, by this idea of\na supreme author of all, which I place as the foundation of all\ninquiries into nature, I do not mean to assert the existence of such a\nbeing, or that I have any knowledge of its existence; and,\nconsequently, I do not really deduce anything from the existence of\nthis being, but merely from its idea, that is to say, from the nature\nof things in this world, in accordance with this idea. A certain dim\nconsciousness of the true use of this idea seems to have dictated to\nthe philosophers of all times the moderate language used by them\nregarding the cause of the world. We find them employing the\nexpressions wisdom and care of nature, and divine wisdom, as\nsynonymous\u2014nay, in purely speculative discussions, preferring the\nformer, because it does not carry the appearance of greater pretensions\nthan such as we are entitled to make, and at the same time directs\nreason to its proper field of action\u2014nature and her phenomena.\nThus, pure reason, which at first seemed to promise us nothing less\nthan the extension of our cognition beyond the limits of experience, is\nfound, when thoroughly examined, to contain nothing but regulative\nprinciples, the virtue and function of which is to introduce into our\ncognition a higher degree of unity than the understanding could of\nitself. These principles, by placing the goal of all our struggles at\nso great a distance, realize for us the most thorough connection\nbetween the different parts of our cognition, and the highest degree of\nsystematic unity. But, on the other hand, if misunderstood and employed\nas constitutive principles of transcendent cognition, they become the\nparents of illusions and contradictions, while pretending to introduce\nus to new regions of knowledge.\nThus all human cognition begins with intuitions, proceeds from thence\nto conceptions, and ends with ideas. Although it possesses, in relation\nto all three elements, \u00e0 priori sources of cognition, which seemed to\ntranscend the limits of all experience, a thoroughgoing criticism\ndemonstrates that speculative reason can never, by the aid of these\nelements, pass the bounds of possible experience, and that the proper\ndestination of this highest faculty of cognition is to employ all\nmethods, and all the principles of these methods, for the purpose of\npenetrating into the innermost secrets of nature, by the aid of the\nprinciples of unity (among all kinds of which teleological unity is the\nhighest), while it ought not to attempt to soar above the sphere of\nexperience, beyond which there lies nought for us but the void inane.\nThe critical examination, in our Transcendental Analytic, of all the\npropositions which professed to extend cognition beyond the sphere of\nexperience, completely demonstrated that they can only conduct us to a\npossible experience. If we were not distrustful even of the clearest\nabstract theorems, if we were not allured by specious and inviting\nprospects to escape from the constraining power of their evidence, we\nmight spare ourselves the laborious examination of all the dialectical\narguments which a transcendent reason adduces in support of its\npretensions; for we should know with the most complete certainty that,\nhowever honest such professions might be, they are null and valueless,\nbecause they relate to a kind of knowledge to which no man can by any\npossibility attain. But, as there is no end to discussion, if we cannot\ndiscover the true cause of the illusions by which even the wisest are\ndeceived, and as the analysis of all our transcendent cognition into\nits elements is of itself of no slight value as a psychological study,\nwhile it is a duty incumbent on every philosopher\u2014it was found\nnecessary to investigate the dialectical procedure of reason in its\nprimary sources. And as the inferences of which this dialectic is the\nparent are not only deceitful, but naturally possess a profound\ninterest for humanity, it was advisable at the same time, to give a\nfull account of the momenta of this dialectical procedure, and to\ndeposit it in the archives of human reason, as a warning to all future\nmetaphysicians to avoid these causes of speculative error.\nII. Transcendental Doctrine of Method\nIf we regard the sum of the cognition of pure speculative reason as an\nedifice, the idea of which, at least, exists in the human mind, it may\nbe said that we have in the Transcendental Doctrine of Elements\nexamined the materials and determined to what edifice these belong, and\nwhat its height and stability. We have found, indeed, that, although we\nhad purposed to build for ourselves a tower which should reach to\nHeaven, the supply of materials sufficed merely for a habitation, which\nwas spacious enough for all terrestrial purposes, and high enough to\nenable us to survey the level plain of experience, but that the bold\nundertaking designed necessarily failed for want of materials\u2014not to\nmention the confusion of tongues, which gave rise to endless disputes\namong the labourers on the plan of the edifice, and at last scattered\nthem over all the world, each to erect a separate building for himself,\naccording to his own plans and his own inclinations. Our present task\nrelates not to the materials, but to the plan of an edifice; and, as we\nhave had sufficient warning not to venture blindly upon a design which\nmay be found to transcend our natural powers, while, at the same time,\nwe cannot give up the intention of erecting a secure abode for the\nmind, we must proportion our design to the material which is presented\nto us, and which is, at the same time, sufficient for all our wants.\nI understand, then, by the transcendental doctrine of method, the\ndetermination of the formal conditions of a complete system of pure\nreason. We shall accordingly have to treat of the discipline, the\ncanon, the architectonic, and, finally, the history of pure reason.\nThis part of our Critique will accomplish, from the transcendental\npoint of view, what has been usually attempted, but miserably executed,\nunder the name of practical logic. It has been badly executed, I say,\nbecause general logic, not being limited to any particular kind of\ncognition (not even to the pure cognition of the understanding) nor to\nany particular objects, it cannot, without borrowing from other\nsciences, do more than present merely the titles or signs of possible\nmethods and the technical expressions, which are employed in the\nsystematic parts of all sciences; and thus the pupil is made acquainted\nwith names, the meaning and application of which he is to learn only at\nsome future time.\nChapter I. The Discipline of Pure Reason\nNegative judgements\u2014those which are so not merely as regards their\nlogical form, but in respect of their content\u2014are not commonly held in\nespecial respect. They are, on the contrary, regarded as jealous\nenemies of our insatiable desire for knowledge; and it almost requires\nan apology to induce us to tolerate, much less to prize and to respect\nthem.\nAll propositions, indeed, may be logically expressed in a negative\nform; but, in relation to the content of our cognition, the peculiar\nprovince of negative judgements is solely to prevent error. For this\nreason, too, negative propositions, which are framed for the purpose of\ncorrecting false cognitions where error is absolutely impossible, are\nundoubtedly true, but inane and senseless; that is, they are in reality\npurposeless and, for this reason, often very ridiculous. Such is the\nproposition of the schoolman that Alexander could not have subdued any\ncountries without an army.\nBut where the limits of our possible cognition are very much\ncontracted, the attraction to new fields of knowledge great, the\nillusions to which the mind is subject of the most deceptive character,\nand the evil consequences of error of no inconsiderable magnitude\u2014the\nnegative element in knowledge, which is useful only to guard us against\nerror, is of far more importance than much of that positive instruction\nwhich makes additions to the sum of our knowledge. The restraint which\nis employed to repress, and finally to extirpate the constant\ninclination to depart from certain rules, is termed discipline. It is\ndistinguished from culture, which aims at the formation of a certain\ndegree of skill, without attempting to repress or to destroy any other\nmental power, already existing. In the cultivation of a talent, which\nhas given evidence of an impulse towards self-development, discipline\ntakes a negative,[74] culture and doctrine a positive, part.\n[74] I am well aware that, in the language of the schools, the term\ndiscipline is usually employed as synonymous with instruction. But\nthere are so many cases in which it is necessary to distinguish the\nnotion of the former, as a course of corrective training, from that of\nthe latter, as the communication of knowledge, and the nature of\nthings itself demands the appropriation of the most suitable\nexpressions for this distinction, that it is my desire that the former\nterms should never be employed in any other than a negative\nsignification.\nThat natural dispositions and talents (such as imagination and wit),\nwhich ask a free and unlimited development, require in many respects\nthe corrective influence of discipline, every one will readily grant.\nBut it may well appear strange that reason, whose proper duty it is to\nprescribe rules of discipline to all the other powers of the mind,\nshould itself require this corrective. It has, in fact, hitherto\nescaped this humiliation, only because, in presence of its magnificent\npretensions and high position, no one could readily suspect it to be\ncapable of substituting fancies for conceptions, and words for things.\nReason, when employed in the field of experience, does not stand in\nneed of criticism, because its principles are subjected to the\ncontinual test of empirical observations. Nor is criticism requisite in\nthe sphere of mathematics, where the conceptions of reason must always\nbe presented in concreto in pure intuition, and baseless or arbitrary\nassertions are discovered without difficulty. But where reason is not\nheld in a plain track by the influence of empirical or of pure\nintuition, that is, when it is employed in the transcendental sphere of\npure conceptions, it stands in great need of discipline, to restrain\nits propensity to overstep the limits of possible experience and to\nkeep it from wandering into error. In fact, the utility of the\nphilosophy of pure reason is entirely of this negative character.\nParticular errors may be corrected by particular animadversions, and\nthe causes of these errors may be eradicated by criticism. But where we\nfind, as in the case of pure reason, a complete system of illusions and\nfallacies, closely connected with each other and depending upon grand\ngeneral principles, there seems to be required a peculiar and negative\ncode of mental legislation, which, under the denomination of a\ndiscipline, and founded upon the nature of reason and the objects of\nits exercise, shall constitute a system of thorough examination and\ntesting, which no fallacy will be able to withstand or escape from,\nunder whatever disguise or concealment it may lurk.\nBut the reader must remark that, in this the second division of our\ntranscendental Critique the discipline of pure reason is not directed\nto the content, but to the method of the cognition of pure reason. The\nformer task has been completed in the doctrine of elements. But there\nis so much similarity in the mode of employing the faculty of reason,\nwhatever be the object to which it is applied, while, at the same time,\nits employment in the transcendental sphere is so essentially different\nin kind from every other, that, without the warning negative influence\nof a discipline specially directed to that end, the errors are\nunavoidable which spring from the unskillful employment of the methods\nwhich are originated by reason but which are out of place in this\nsphere.\nSection I. The Discipline of Pure Reason in the Sphere of Dogmatism\nThe science of mathematics presents the most brilliant example of the\nextension of the sphere of pure reason without the aid of experience.\nExamples are always contagious; and they exert an especial influence on\nthe same faculty, which naturally flatters itself that it will have the\nsame good fortune in other case as fell to its lot in one fortunate\ninstance. Hence pure reason hopes to be able to extend its empire in\nthe transcendental sphere with equal success and security, especially\nwhen it applies the same method which was attended with such brilliant\nresults in the science of mathematics. It is, therefore, of the highest\nimportance for us to know whether the method of arriving at\ndemonstrative certainty, which is termed mathematical, be identical\nwith that by which we endeavour to attain the same degree of certainty\nin philosophy, and which is termed in that science dogmatical.\nPhilosophical cognition is the cognition of reason by means of\nconceptions; mathematical cognition is cognition by means of the\nconstruction of conceptions. The construction of a conception is the\npresentation \u00e0 priori of the intuition which corresponds to the\nconception. For this purpose a non-empirical intuition is requisite,\nwhich, as an intuition, is an individual object; while, as the\nconstruction of a conception (a general representation), it must be\nseen to be universally valid for all the possible intuitions which rank\nunder that conception. Thus I construct a triangle, by the presentation\nof the object which corresponds to this conception, either by mere\nimagination, in pure intuition, or upon paper, in empirical intuition,\nin both cases completely \u00e0 priori, without borrowing the type of that\nfigure from any experience. The individual figure drawn upon paper is\nempirical; but it serves, notwithstanding, to indicate the conception,\neven in its universality, because in this empirical intuition we keep\nour eye merely on the act of the construction of the conception, and\npay no attention to the various modes of determining it, for example,\nits size, the length of its sides, the size of its angles, these not in\nthe least affecting the essential character of the conception.\nPhilosophical cognition, accordingly, regards the particular only in\nthe general; mathematical the general in the particular, nay, in the\nindividual. This is done, however, entirely \u00e0 priori and by means of\npure reason, so that, as this individual figure is determined under\ncertain universal conditions of construction, the object of the\nconception, to which this individual figure corresponds as its schema,\nmust be cogitated as universally determined.\nThe essential difference of these two modes of cognition consists,\ntherefore, in this formal quality; it does not regard the difference of\nthe matter or objects of both. Those thinkers who aim at distinguishing\nphilosophy from mathematics by asserting that the former has to do with\nquality merely, and the latter with quantity, have mistaken the effect\nfor the cause. The reason why mathematical cognition can relate only to\nquantity is to be found in its form alone. For it is the conception of\nquantities only that is capable of being constructed, that is,\npresented \u00e0 priori in intuition; while qualities cannot be given in any\nother than an empirical intuition. Hence the cognition of qualities by\nreason is possible only through conceptions. No one can find an\nintuition which shall correspond to the conception of reality, except\nin experience; it cannot be presented to the mind \u00e0 priori and\nantecedently to the empirical consciousness of a reality. We can form\nan intuition, by means of the mere conception of it, of a cone, without\nthe aid of experience; but the colour of the cone we cannot know except\nfrom experience. I cannot present an intuition of a cause, except in an\nexample which experience offers to me. Besides, philosophy, as well as\nmathematics, treats of quantities; as, for example, of totality,\ninfinity, and so on. Mathematics, too, treats of the difference of\nlines and surfaces\u2014as spaces of different quality, of the continuity of\nextension\u2014as a quality thereof. But, although in such cases they have a\ncommon object, the mode in which reason considers that object is very\ndifferent in philosophy from what it is in mathematics. The former\nconfines itself to the general conceptions; the latter can do nothing\nwith a mere conception, it hastens to intuition. In this intuition it\nregards the conception in concreto, not empirically, but in an \u00e0 priori\nintuition, which it has constructed; and in which, all the results\nwhich follow from the general conditions of the construction of the\nconception are in all cases valid for the object of the constructed\nconception.\nSuppose that the conception of a triangle is given to a philosopher and\nthat he is required to discover, by the philosophical method, what\nrelation the sum of its angles bears to a right angle. He has nothing\nbefore him but the conception of a figure enclosed within three right\nlines, and, consequently, with the same number of angles. He may\nanalyse the conception of a right line, of an angle, or of the number\nthree as long as he pleases, but he will not discover any properties\nnot contained in these conceptions. But, if this question is proposed\nto a geometrician, he at once begins by constructing a triangle. He\nknows that two right angles are equal to the sum of all the contiguous\nangles which proceed from one point in a straight line; and he goes on\nto produce one side of his triangle, thus forming two adjacent angles\nwhich are together equal to two right angles. He then divides the\nexterior of these angles, by drawing a line parallel with the opposite\nside of the triangle, and immediately perceives that he has thus got an\nexterior adjacent angle which is equal to the interior. Proceeding in\nthis way, through a chain of inferences, and always on the ground of\nintuition, he arrives at a clear and universally valid solution of the\nquestion.\nBut mathematics does not confine itself to the construction of\nquantities (quanta), as in the case of geometry; it occupies itself\nwith pure quantity also (quantitas), as in the case of algebra, where\ncomplete abstraction is made of the properties of the object indicated\nby the conception of quantity. In algebra, a certain method of notation\nby signs is adopted, and these indicate the different possible\nconstructions of quantities, the extraction of roots, and so on. After\nhaving thus denoted the general conception of quantities, according to\ntheir different relations, the different operations by which quantity\nor number is increased or diminished are presented in intuition in\naccordance with general rules. Thus, when one quantity is to be divided\nby another, the signs which denote both are placed in the form peculiar\nto the operation of division; and thus algebra, by means of a\nsymbolical construction of quantity, just as geometry, with its\nostensive or geometrical construction (a construction of the objects\nthemselves), arrives at results which discursive cognition cannot hope\nto reach by the aid of mere conceptions.\nNow, what is the cause of this difference in the fortune of the\nphilosopher and the mathematician, the former of whom follows the path\nof conceptions, while the latter pursues that of intuitions, which he\nrepresents, \u00e0 priori, in correspondence with his conceptions? The cause\nis evident from what has been already demonstrated in the introduction\nto this Critique. We do not, in the present case, want to discover\nanalytical propositions, which may be produced merely by analysing our\nconceptions\u2014for in this the philosopher would have the advantage over\nhis rival; we aim at the discovery of synthetical propositions\u2014such\nsynthetical propositions, moreover, as can be cognized \u00e0 priori. I must\nnot confine myself to that which I actually cogitate in my conception\nof a triangle, for this is nothing more than the mere definition; I\nmust try to go beyond that, and to arrive at properties which are not\ncontained in, although they belong to, the conception. Now, this is\nimpossible, unless I determine the object present to my mind according\nto the conditions, either of empirical, or of pure, intuition. In the\nformer case, I should have an empirical proposition (arrived at by\nactual measurement of the angles of the triangle), which would possess\nneither universality nor necessity; but that would be of no value. In\nthe latter, I proceed by geometrical construction, by means of which I\ncollect, in a pure intuition, just as I would in an empirical\nintuition, all the various properties which belong to the schema of a\ntriangle in general, and consequently to its conception, and thus\nconstruct synthetical propositions which possess the attribute of\nuniversality.\nIt would be vain to philosophize upon the triangle, that is, to reflect\non it discursively; I should get no further than the definition with\nwhich I had been obliged to set out. There are certainly transcendental\nsynthetical propositions which are framed by means of pure conceptions,\nand which form the peculiar distinction of philosophy; but these do not\nrelate to any particular thing, but to a thing in general, and enounce\nthe conditions under which the perception of it may become a part of\npossible experience. But the science of mathematics has nothing to do\nwith such questions, nor with the question of existence in any fashion;\nit is concerned merely with the properties of objects in themselves,\nonly in so far as these are connected with the conception of the\nobjects.\nIn the above example, we merely attempted to show the great difference\nwhich exists between the discursive employment of reason in the sphere\nof conceptions, and its intuitive exercise by means of the construction\nof conceptions. The question naturally arises: What is the cause which\nnecessitates this twofold exercise of reason, and how are we to\ndiscover whether it is the philosophical or the mathematical method\nwhich reason is pursuing in an argument?\nAll our knowledge relates, finally, to possible intuitions, for it is\nthese alone that present objects to the mind. An \u00e0 priori or\nnon-empirical conception contains either a pure intuition\u2014and in this\ncase it can be constructed; or it contains nothing but the synthesis of\npossible intuitions, which are not given \u00e0 priori. In this latter case,\nit may help us to form synthetical \u00e0 priori judgements, but only in the\ndiscursive method, by conceptions, not in the intuitive, by means of\nthe construction of conceptions.\nThe only \u00e0 priori intuition is that of the pure form of phenomena\u2014space\nand time. A conception of space and time as quanta may be presented \u00e0\npriori in intuition, that is, constructed, either alone with their\nquality (figure), or as pure quantity (the mere synthesis of the\nhomogeneous), by means of number. But the matter of phenomena, by which\nthings are given in space and time, can be presented only in\nperception, \u00e0 posteriori. The only conception which represents \u00e0 priori\nthis empirical content of phenomena is the conception of a thing in\ngeneral; and the \u00e0 priori synthetical cognition of this conception can\ngive us nothing more than the rule for the synthesis of that which may\nbe contained in the corresponding \u00e0 posteriori perception; it is\nutterly inadequate to present an \u00e0 priori intuition of the real object,\nwhich must necessarily be empirical.\nSynthetical propositions, which relate to things in general, an \u00e0\npriori intuition of which is impossible, are transcendental. For this\nreason transcendental propositions cannot be framed by means of the\nconstruction of conceptions; they are \u00e0 priori, and based entirely on\nconceptions themselves. They contain merely the rule, by which we are\nto seek in the world of perception or experience the synthetical unity\nof that which cannot be intuited \u00e0 priori. But they are incompetent to\npresent any of the conceptions which appear in them in an \u00e0 priori\nintuition; these can be given only \u00e0 posteriori, in experience, which,\nhowever, is itself possible only through these synthetical principles.\nIf we are to form a synthetical judgement regarding a conception,\nwe must go beyond it, to the intuition in which it is given. If we\nkeep to what is contained in the conception, the judgement is merely\nanalytical\u2014it is merely an explanation of what we have cogitated in\nthe conception. But I can pass from the conception to the pure or\nempirical intuition which corresponds to it. I can proceed to examine\nmy conception in concreto, and to cognize, either \u00e0 priori or \u00e0\nposteriori, what I find in the object of the conception. The former\u2014\u00e0\npriori cognition\u2014is rational-mathematical cognition by means of the\nconstruction of the conception; the latter\u2014\u00e0 posteriori cognition\u2014is\npurely empirical cognition, which does not possess the attributes\nof necessity and universality. Thus I may analyse the conception I\nhave of gold; but I gain no new information from this analysis, I\nmerely enumerate the different properties which I had connected with\nthe notion indicated by the word. My knowledge has gained in logical\nclearness and arrangement, but no addition has been made to it. But\nif I take the matter which is indicated by this name, and submit\nit to the examination of my senses, I am enabled to form several\nsynthetical\u2014although still empirical\u2014propositions. The mathematical\nconception of a triangle I should construct, that is, present \u00e0 priori\nin intuition, and in this way attain to rational-synthetical cognition.\nBut when the transcendental conception of reality, or substance, or\npower is presented to my mind, I find that it does not relate to or\nindicate either an empirical or pure intuition, but that it indicates\nmerely the synthesis of empirical intuitions, which cannot of course\nbe given \u00e0 priori. The synthesis in such a conception cannot proceed \u00e0\npriori\u2014without the aid of experience\u2014to the intuition which corresponds\nto the conception; and, for this reason, none of these conceptions can\nproduce a determinative synthetical proposition, they can never present\nmore than a principle of the synthesis[75] of possible empirical\nintuitions. A transcendental proposition is, therefore, a synthetical\ncognition of reason by means of pure conceptions and the discursive\nmethod, and it renders possible all synthetical unity in empirical\ncognition, though it cannot present us with any intuition \u00e0 priori.\n[75] In the case of the conception of cause, I do really go beyond the\nempirical conception of an event\u2014but not to the intuition which\npresents this conception in concreto, but only to the time-conditions,\nwhich may be found in experience to correspond to the conception. My\nprocedure is, therefore, strictly according to conceptions; I cannot\nin a case of this kind employ the construction of conceptions, because\nthe conception is merely a rule for the synthesis of perceptions,\nwhich are not pure intuitions, and which, therefore, cannot be given \u00e0\npriori.\nThere is thus a twofold exercise of reason. Both modes have the\nproperties of universality and an \u00e0 priori origin in common, but are,\nin their procedure, of widely different character. The reason of this\nis that in the world of phenomena, in which alone objects are presented\nto our minds, there are two main elements\u2014the form of intuition (space\nand time), which can be cognized and determined completely \u00e0 priori,\nand the matter or content\u2014that which is presented in space and time,\nand which, consequently, contains a something\u2014an existence\ncorresponding to our powers of sensation. As regards the latter, which\ncan never be given in a determinate mode except by experience, there\nare no \u00e0 priori notions which relate to it, except the undetermined\nconceptions of the synthesis of possible sensations, in so far as these\nbelong (in a possible experience) to the unity of consciousness. As\nregards the former, we can determine our conceptions \u00e0 priori in\nintuition, inasmuch as we are ourselves the creators of the objects of\nthe conceptions in space and time\u2014these objects being regarded simply\nas quanta. In the one case, reason proceeds according to conceptions\nand can do nothing more than subject phenomena to these\u2014which can only\nbe determined empirically, that is, \u00e0 posteriori\u2014in conformity,\nhowever, with those conceptions as the rules of all empirical\nsynthesis. In the other case, reason proceeds by the construction of\nconceptions; and, as these conceptions relate to an \u00e0 priori intuition,\nthey may be given and determined in pure intuition \u00e0 priori, and\nwithout the aid of empirical data. The examination and consideration of\neverything that exists in space or time\u2014whether it is a quantum or not,\nin how far the particular something (which fills space or time) is a\nprimary substratum, or a mere determination of some other existence,\nwhether it relates to anything else\u2014either as cause or effect, whether\nits existence is isolated or in reciprocal connection with and\ndependence upon others, the possibility of this existence, its reality\nand necessity or opposites\u2014all these form part of the cognition of\nreason on the ground of conceptions, and this cognition is termed\nphilosophical. But to determine \u00e0 priori an intuition in space (its\nfigure), to divide time into periods, or merely to cognize the quantity\nof an intuition in space and time, and to determine it by number\u2014all\nthis is an operation of reason by means of the construction of\nconceptions, and is called mathematical.\nThe success which attends the efforts of reason in the sphere of\nmathematics naturally fosters the expectation that the same good\nfortune will be its lot, if it applies the mathematical method in other\nregions of mental endeavour besides that of quantities. Its success is\nthus great, because it can support all its conceptions by \u00e0 priori\nintuitions and, in this way, make itself a master, as it were, over\nnature; while pure philosophy, with its \u00e0 priori discursive\nconceptions, bungles about in the world of nature, and cannot accredit\nor show any \u00e0 priori evidence of the reality of these conceptions.\nMasters in the science of mathematics are confident of the success of\nthis method; indeed, it is a common persuasion that it is capable of\nbeing applied to any subject of human thought. They have hardly ever\nreflected or philosophized on their favourite science\u2014a task of great\ndifficulty; and the specific difference between the two modes of\nemploying the faculty of reason has never entered their thoughts. Rules\ncurrent in the field of common experience, and which common sense\nstamps everywhere with its approval, are regarded by them as axiomatic.\nFrom what source the conceptions of space and time, with which (as the\nonly primitive quanta) they have to deal, enter their minds, is a\nquestion which they do not trouble themselves to answer; and they think\nit just as unnecessary to examine into the origin of the pure\nconceptions of the understanding and the extent of their validity. All\nthey have to do with them is to employ them. In all this they are\nperfectly right, if they do not overstep the limits of the sphere of\nnature. But they pass, unconsciously, from the world of sense to the\ninsecure ground of pure transcendental conceptions (instabilis tellus,\ninnabilis unda), where they can neither stand nor swim, and where the\ntracks of their footsteps are obliterated by time; while the march of\nmathematics is pursued on a broad and magnificent highway, which the\nlatest posterity shall frequent without fear of danger or impediment.\nAs we have taken upon us the task of determining, clearly and\ncertainly, the limits of pure reason in the sphere of\ntranscendentalism, and as the efforts of reason in this direction are\npersisted in, even after the plainest and most expressive warnings,\nhope still beckoning us past the limits of experience into the\nsplendours of the intellectual world\u2014it becomes necessary to cut away\nthe last anchor of this fallacious and fantastic hope. We shall,\naccordingly, show that the mathematical method is unattended in the\nsphere of philosophy by the least advantage\u2014except, perhaps, that it\nmore plainly exhibits its own inadequacy\u2014that geometry and philosophy\nare two quite different things, although they go hand in hand in the\nfield of natural science, and, consequently, that the procedure of the\none can never be imitated by the other.\nThe evidence of mathematics rests upon definitions, axioms, and\ndemonstrations. I shall be satisfied with showing that none of these\nforms can be employed or imitated in philosophy in the sense in which\nthey are understood by mathematicians; and that the geometrician, if he\nemploys his method in philosophy, will succeed only in building\ncard-castles, while the employment of the philosophical method in\nmathematics can result in nothing but mere verbiage. The essential\nbusiness of philosophy, indeed, is to mark out the limits of the\nscience; and even the mathematician, unless his talent is naturally\ncircumscribed and limited to this particular department of knowledge,\ncannot turn a deaf ear to the warnings of philosophy, or set himself\nabove its direction.\nI. Of Definitions. A definition is, as the term itself indicates, the\nrepresentation, upon primary grounds, of the complete conception of a\nthing within its own limits.[76] Accordingly, an empirical conception\ncannot be defined, it can only be explained. For, as there are in such\na conception only a certain number of marks or signs, which denote a\ncertain class of sensuous objects, we can never be sure that we do not\ncogitate under the word which indicates the same object, at one time a\ngreater, at another a smaller number of signs. Thus, one person may\ncogitate in his conception of gold, in addition to its properties of\nweight, colour, malleability, that of resisting rust, while another\nperson may be ignorant of this quality. We employ certain signs only so\nlong as we require them for the sake of distinction; new observations\nabstract some and add new ones, so that an empirical conception never\nremains within permanent limits. It is, in fact, useless to define a\nconception of this kind. If, for example, we are speaking of water and\nits properties, we do not stop at what we actually think by the word\nwater, but proceed to observation and experiment; and the word, with\nthe few signs attached to it, is more properly a designation than a\nconception of the thing. A definition in this case would evidently be\nnothing more than a determination of the word. In the second place, no\n\u00e0 priori conception, such as those of substance, cause, right, fitness,\nand so on, can be defined. For I can never be sure, that the clear\nrepresentation of a given conception (which is given in a confused\nstate) has been fully developed, until I know that the representation\nis adequate with its object. But, inasmuch as the conception, as it is\npresented to the mind, may contain a number of obscure representations,\nwhich we do not observe in our analysis, although we employ them in our\napplication of the conception, I can never be sure that my analysis is\ncomplete, while examples may make this probable, although they can\nnever demonstrate the fact. Instead of the word definition, I should\nrather employ the term exposition\u2014a more modest expression, which the\ncritic may accept without surrendering his doubts as to the\ncompleteness of the analysis of any such conception. As, therefore,\nneither empirical nor \u00e0 priori conceptions are capable of definition,\nwe have to see whether the only other kind of conceptions\u2014arbitrary\nconceptions\u2014can be subjected to this mental operation. Such a\nconception can always be defined; for I must know thoroughly what I\nwished to cogitate in it, as it was I who created it, and it was not\ngiven to my mind either by the nature of my understanding or by\nexperience. At the same time, I cannot say that, by such a definition,\nI have defined a real object. If the conception is based upon empirical\nconditions, if, for example, I have a conception of a clock for a ship,\nthis arbitrary conception does not assure me of the existence or even\nof the possibility of the object. My definition of such a conception\nwould with more propriety be termed a declaration of a project than a\ndefinition of an object. There are no other conceptions which can bear\ndefinition, except those which contain an arbitrary synthesis, which\ncan be constructed \u00e0 priori. Consequently, the science of mathematics\nalone possesses definitions. For the object here thought is presented \u00e0\npriori in intuition; and thus it can never contain more or less than\nthe conception, because the conception of the object has been given by\nthe definition\u2014and primarily, that is, without deriving the definition\nfrom any other source. Philosophical definitions are, therefore, merely\nexpositions of given conceptions, while mathematical definitions are\nconstructions of conceptions originally formed by the mind itself; the\nformer are produced by analysis, the completeness of which is never\ndemonstratively certain, the latter by a synthesis. In a mathematical\ndefinition the conception is formed, in a philosophical definition it\nis only explained. From this it follows:\n[76] The definition must describe the conception completely that is,\nomit none of the marks or signs of which it composed; within its own\nlimits, that is, it must be precise, and enumerate no more signs than\nbelong to the conception; and on primary grounds, that is to say, the\nlimitations of the bounds of the conception must not be deduced from\nother conceptions, as in this case a proof would be necessary, and the\nso-called definition would be incapable of taking its place at the\nhead of all the judgements we have to form regarding an object.\n(a) That we must not imitate, in philosophy, the mathematical usage of\ncommencing with definitions\u2014except by way of hypothesis or experiment.\nFor, as all so-called philosophical definitions are merely analyses of\ngiven conceptions, these conceptions, although only in a confused form,\nmust precede the analysis; and the incomplete exposition must precede\nthe complete, so that we may be able to draw certain inferences from\nthe characteristics which an incomplete analysis has enabled us to\ndiscover, before we attain to the complete exposition or definition of\nthe conception. In one word, a full and clear definition ought, in\nphilosophy, rather to form the conclusion than the commencement of our\nlabours.[77] In mathematics, on the contrary, we cannot have a\nconception prior to the definition; it is the definition which gives us\nthe conception, and it must for this reason form the commencement of\nevery chain of mathematical reasoning.\n[77] Philosophy abounds in faulty definitions, especially such as\ncontain some of the elements requisite to form a complete definition.\nIf a conception could not be employed in reasoning before it had been\ndefined, it would fare ill with all philosophical thought. But, as\nincompletely defined conceptions may always be employed without\ndetriment to truth, so far as our analysis of the elements contained\nin them proceeds, imperfect definitions, that is, propositions which\nare properly not definitions, but merely approximations thereto, may\nbe used with great advantage. In mathematics, definition belongs ad\nesse, in philosophy ad melius esse. It is a difficult task to\nconstruct a proper definition. Jurists are still without a complete\ndefinition of the idea of right.\n(b) Mathematical definitions cannot be erroneous. For the conception is\ngiven only in and through the definition, and thus it contains only\nwhat has been cogitated in the definition. But although a definition\ncannot be incorrect, as regards its content, an error may sometimes,\nalthough seldom, creep into the form. This error consists in a want of\nprecision. Thus the common definition of a circle\u2014that it is a curved\nline, every point in which is equally distant from another point called\nthe centre\u2014is faulty, from the fact that the determination indicated by\nthe word curved is superfluous. For there ought to be a particular\ntheorem, which may be easily proved from the definition, to the effect\nthat every line, which has all its points at equal distances from\nanother point, must be a curved line\u2014that is, that not even the\nsmallest part of it can be straight. Analytical definitions, on the\nother hand, may be erroneous in many respects, either by the\nintroduction of signs which do not actually exist in the conception, or\nby wanting in that completeness which forms the essential of a\ndefinition. In the latter case, the definition is necessarily\ndefective, because we can never be fully certain of the completeness of\nour analysis. For these reasons, the method of definition employed in\nmathematics cannot be imitated in philosophy.\n2. Of Axioms. These, in so far as they are immediately certain, are \u00e0\npriori synthetical principles. Now, one conception cannot be connected\nsynthetically and yet immediately with another; because, if we wish to\nproceed out of and beyond a conception, a third mediating cognition is\nnecessary. And, as philosophy is a cognition of reason by the aid of\nconceptions alone, there is to be found in it no principle which\ndeserves to be called an axiom. Mathematics, on the other hand, may\npossess axioms, because it can always connect the predicates of an\nobject \u00e0 priori, and without any mediating term, by means of the\nconstruction of conceptions in intuition. Such is the case with the\nproposition: Three points can always lie in a plane. On the other hand,\nno synthetical principle which is based upon conceptions, can ever be\nimmediately certain (for example, the proposition: Everything that\nhappens has a cause), because I require a mediating term to connect the\ntwo conceptions of event and cause\u2014namely, the condition of\ntime-determination in an experience, and I cannot cognize any such\nprinciple immediately and from conceptions alone. Discursive principles\nare, accordingly, very different from intuitive principles or axioms.\nThe former always require deduction, which in the case of the latter\nmay be altogether dispensed with. Axioms are, for this reason, always\nself-evident, while philosophical principles, whatever may be the\ndegree of certainty they possess, cannot lay any claim to such a\ndistinction. No synthetical proposition of pure transcendental reason\ncan be so evident, as is often rashly enough declared, as the\nstatement, twice two are four. It is true that in the Analytic I\nintroduced into the list of principles of the pure understanding,\ncertain axioms of intuition; but the principle there discussed was not\nitself an axiom, but served merely to present the principle of the\npossibility of axioms in general, while it was really nothing more than\na principle based upon conceptions. For it is one part of the duty of\ntranscendental philosophy to establish the possibility of mathematics\nitself. Philosophy possesses, then, no axioms, and has no right to\nimpose its \u00e0 priori principles upon thought, until it has established\ntheir authority and validity by a thoroughgoing deduction.\n3. Of Demonstrations. Only an apodeictic proof, based upon intuition,\ncan be termed a demonstration. Experience teaches us what is, but it\ncannot convince us that it might not have been otherwise. Hence a proof\nupon empirical grounds cannot be apodeictic. \u00c0 priori conceptions, in\ndiscursive cognition, can never produce intuitive certainty or\nevidence, however certain the judgement they present may be.\nMathematics alone, therefore, contains demonstrations, because it does\nnot deduce its cognition from conceptions, but from the construction of\nconceptions, that is, from intuition, which can be given \u00e0 priori in\naccordance with conceptions. The method of algebra, in equations, from\nwhich the correct answer is deduced by reduction, is a kind of\nconstruction\u2014not geometrical, but by symbols\u2014in which all conceptions,\nespecially those of the relations of quantities, are represented in\nintuition by signs; and thus the conclusions in that science are\nsecured from errors by the fact that every proof is submitted to ocular\nevidence. Philosophical cognition does not possess this advantage, it\nbeing required to consider the general always in abstracto (by means of\nconceptions), while mathematics can always consider it in concreto (in\nan individual intuition), and at the same time by means of \u00e0 priori\nrepresentation, whereby all errors are rendered manifest to the senses.\nThe former\u2014discursive proofs\u2014ought to be termed acroamatic proofs,\nrather than demonstrations, as only words are employed in them, while\ndemonstrations proper, as the term itself indicates, always require a\nreference to the intuition of the object.\nIt follows from all these considerations that it is not consonant with\nthe nature of philosophy, especially in the sphere of pure reason, to\nemploy the dogmatical method, and to adorn itself with the titles and\ninsignia of mathematical science. It does not belong to that order, and\ncan only hope for a fraternal union with that science. Its attempts at\nmathematical evidence are vain pretensions, which can only keep it back\nfrom its true aim, which is to detect the illusory procedure of reason\nwhen transgressing its proper limits, and by fully explaining and\nanalysing our conceptions, to conduct us from the dim regions of\nspeculation to the clear region of modest self-knowledge. Reason must\nnot, therefore, in its transcendental endeavours, look forward with\nsuch confidence, as if the path it is pursuing led straight to its aim,\nnor reckon with such security upon its premisses, as to consider it\nunnecessary to take a step back, or to keep a strict watch for errors,\nwhich, overlooked in the principles, may be detected in the arguments\nthemselves\u2014in which case it may be requisite either to determine these\nprinciples with greater strictness, or to change them entirely.\nI divide all apodeictic propositions, whether demonstrable or\nimmediately certain, into dogmata and mathemata. A direct synthetical\nproposition, based on conceptions, is a dogma; a proposition of the\nsame kind, based on the construction of conceptions, is a mathema.\nAnalytical judgements do not teach us any more about an object than\nwhat was contained in the conception we had of it; because they do not\nextend our cognition beyond our conception of an object, they merely\nelucidate the conception. They cannot therefore be with propriety\ntermed dogmas. Of the two kinds of \u00e0 priori synthetical propositions\nabove mentioned, only those which are employed in philosophy can,\naccording to the general mode of speech, bear this name; those of\narithmetic or geometry would not be rightly so denominated. Thus the\ncustomary mode of speaking confirms the explanation given above, and\nthe conclusion arrived at, that only those judgements which are based\nupon conceptions, not on the construction of conceptions, can be termed\ndogmatical.\nThus, pure reason, in the sphere of speculation, does not contain a\nsingle direct synthetical judgement based upon conceptions. By means of\nideas, it is, as we have shown, incapable of producing synthetical\njudgements, which are objectively valid; by means of the conceptions of\nthe understanding, it establishes certain indubitable principles, not,\nhowever, directly on the basis of conceptions, but only indirectly by\nmeans of the relation of these conceptions to something of a purely\ncontingent nature, namely, possible experience. When experience is\npresupposed, these principles are apodeictically certain, but in\nthemselves, and directly, they cannot even be cognized \u00e0 priori. Thus\nthe given conceptions of cause and event will not be sufficient for the\ndemonstration of the proposition: Every event has a cause. For this\nreason, it is not a dogma; although from another point of view, that of\nexperience, it is capable of being proved to demonstration. The proper\nterm for such a proposition is principle, and not theorem (although it\ndoes require to be proved), because it possesses the remarkable\npeculiarity of being the condition of the possibility of its own ground\nof proof, that is, experience, and of forming a necessary\npresupposition in all empirical observation.\nIf then, in the speculative sphere of pure reason, no dogmata are to be\nfound; all dogmatical methods, whether borrowed from mathematics, or\ninvented by philosophical thinkers, are alike inappropriate and\ninefficient. They only serve to conceal errors and fallacies, and to\ndeceive philosophy, whose duty it is to see that reason pursues a safe\nand straight path. A philosophical method may, however, be\nsystematical. For our reason is, subjectively considered, itself a\nsystem, and, in the sphere of mere conceptions, a system of\ninvestigation according to principles of unity, the material being\nsupplied by experience alone. But this is not the proper place for\ndiscussing the peculiar method of transcendental philosophy, as our\npresent task is simply to examine whether our faculties are capable of\nerecting an edifice on the basis of pure reason, and how far they may\nproceed with the materials at their command.\nSection II. The Discipline of Pure Reason in Polemics\nReason must be subject, in all its operations, to criticism, which must\nalways be permitted to exercise its functions without restraint;\notherwise its interests are imperilled and its influence obnoxious to\nsuspicion. There is nothing, however useful, however sacred it may be,\nthat can claim exemption from the searching examination of this supreme\ntribunal, which has no respect of persons. The very existence of reason\ndepends upon this freedom; for the voice of reason is not that of a\ndictatorial and despotic power, it is rather like the vote of the\ncitizens of a free state, every member of which must have the privilege\nof giving free expression to his doubts, and possess even the right of\nveto.\nBut while reason can never decline to submit itself to the tribunal of\ncriticism, it has not always cause to dread the judgement of this\ncourt. Pure reason, however, when engaged in the sphere of dogmatism,\nis not so thoroughly conscious of a strict observance of its highest\nlaws, as to appear before a higher judicial reason with perfect\nconfidence. On the contrary, it must renounce its magnificent\ndogmatical pretensions in philosophy.\nVery different is the case when it has to defend itself, not before a\njudge, but against an equal. If dogmatical assertions are advanced on\nthe negative side, in opposition to those made by reason on the\npositive side, its justification kat authrhopon is complete, although\nthe proof of its propositions is kat aletheian unsatisfactory.\nBy the polemic of pure reason I mean the defence of its propositions\nmade by reason, in opposition to the dogmatical counter-propositions\nadvanced by other parties. The question here is not whether its own\nstatements may not also be false; it merely regards the fact that\nreason proves that the opposite cannot be established with\ndemonstrative certainty, nor even asserted with a higher degree of\nprobability. Reason does not hold her possessions upon sufferance; for,\nalthough she cannot show a perfectly satisfactory title to them, no one\ncan prove that she is not the rightful possessor.\nIt is a melancholy reflection that reason, in its highest exercise,\nfalls into an antithetic; and that the supreme tribunal for the\nsettlement of differences should not be at union with itself. It is\ntrue that we had to discuss the question of an apparent antithetic, but\nwe found that it was based upon a misconception. In conformity with the\ncommon prejudice, phenomena were regarded as things in themselves, and\nthus an absolute completeness in their synthesis was required in the\none mode or in the other (it was shown to be impossible in both); a\ndemand entirely out of place in regard to phenomena. There was, then,\nno real self-contradiction of reason in the propositions: The series of\nphenomena given in themselves has an absolutely first beginning; and:\nThis series is absolutely and in itself without beginning. The two\npropositions are perfectly consistent with each other, because\nphenomena as phenomena are in themselves nothing, and consequently the\nhypothesis that they are things in themselves must lead to\nself-contradictory inferences.\nBut there are cases in which a similar misunderstanding cannot be\nprovided against, and the dispute must remain unsettled. Take, for\nexample, the theistic proposition: There is a Supreme Being; and on the\nother hand, the atheistic counter-statement: There exists no Supreme\nBeing; or, in psychology: Everything that thinks possesses the\nattribute of absolute and permanent unity, which is utterly different\nfrom the transitory unity of material phenomena; and the\ncounter-proposition: The soul is not an immaterial unity, and its\nnature is transitory, like that of phenomena. The objects of these\nquestions contain no heterogeneous or contradictory elements, for they\nrelate to things in themselves, and not to phenomena. There would\narise, indeed, a real contradiction, if reason came forward with a\nstatement on the negative side of these questions alone. As regards the\ncriticism to which the grounds of proof on the affirmative side must be\nsubjected, it may be freely admitted, without necessitating the\nsurrender of the affirmative propositions, which have, at least, the\ninterest of reason in their favour\u2014an advantage which the opposite\nparty cannot lay claim to.\nI cannot agree with the opinion of several admirable thinkers\u2014Sulzer\namong the rest\u2014that, in spite of the weakness of the arguments hitherto\nin use, we may hope, one day, to see sufficient demonstrations of the\ntwo cardinal propositions of pure reason\u2014the existence of a Supreme\nBeing, and the immortality of the soul. I am certain, on the contrary,\nthat this will never be the case. For on what ground can reason base\nsuch synthetical propositions, which do not relate to the objects of\nexperience and their internal possibility? But it is also\ndemonstratively certain that no one will ever be able to maintain the\ncontrary with the least show of probability. For, as he can attempt\nsuch a proof solely upon the basis of pure reason, he is bound to prove\nthat a Supreme Being, and a thinking subject in the character of a pure\nintelligence, are impossible. But where will he find the knowledge\nwhich can enable him to enounce synthetical judgements in regard to\nthings which transcend the region of experience? We may, therefore,\nrest assured that the opposite never will be demonstrated. We need not,\nthen, have recourse to scholastic arguments; we may always admit the\ntruth of those propositions which are consistent with the speculative\ninterests of reason in the sphere of experience, and form, moreover,\nthe only means of uniting the speculative with the practical interest.\nOur opponent, who must not be considered here as a critic solely, we\ncan be ready to meet with a non liquet which cannot fail to disconcert\nhim; while we cannot deny his right to a similar retort, as we have on\nour side the advantage of the support of the subjective maxim of\nreason, and can therefore look upon all his sophistical arguments with\ncalm indifference.\nFrom this point of view, there is properly no antithetic of pure\nreason. For the only arena for such a struggle would be upon the field\nof pure theology and psychology; but on this ground there can appear no\ncombatant whom we need to fear. Ridicule and boasting can be his only\nweapons; and these may be laughed at, as mere child\u2019s play. This\nconsideration restores to Reason her courage; for what source of\nconfidence could be found, if she, whose vocation it is to destroy\nerror, were at variance with herself and without any reasonable hope of\never reaching a state of permanent repose?\nEverything in nature is good for some purpose. Even poisons are\nserviceable; they destroy the evil effects of other poisons generated\nin our system, and must always find a place in every complete\npharmacopoeia. The objections raised against the fallacies and\nsophistries of speculative reason, are objections given by the nature\nof this reason itself, and must therefore have a destination and\npurpose which can only be for the good of humanity. For what purpose\nhas Providence raised many objects, in which we have the deepest\ninterest, so far above us, that we vainly try to cognize them with\ncertainty, and our powers of mental vision are rather excited than\nsatisfied by the glimpses we may chance to seize? It is very doubtful\nwhether it is for our benefit to advance bold affirmations regarding\nsubjects involved in such obscurity; perhaps it would even be\ndetrimental to our best interests. But it is undoubtedly always\nbeneficial to leave the investigating, as well as the critical reason,\nin perfect freedom, and permit it to take charge of its own interests,\nwhich are advanced as much by its limitation, as by its extension of\nits views, and which always suffer by the interference of foreign\npowers forcing it, against its natural tendencies, to bend to certain\npreconceived designs.\nAllow your opponent to say what he thinks reasonable, and combat him\nonly with the weapons of reason. Have no anxiety for the practical\ninterests of humanity\u2014these are never imperilled in a purely\nspeculative dispute. Such a dispute serves merely to disclose the\nantinomy of reason, which, as it has its source in the nature of\nreason, ought to be thoroughly investigated. Reason is benefited by the\nexamination of a subject on both sides, and its judgements are\ncorrected by being limited. It is not the matter that may give occasion\nto dispute, but the manner. For it is perfectly permissible to employ,\nin the presence of reason, the language of a firmly rooted faith, even\nafter we have been obliged to renounce all pretensions to knowledge.\nIf we were to ask the dispassionate David Hume\u2014a philosopher endowed,\nin a degree that few are, with a well-balanced judgement: What motive\ninduced you to spend so much labour and thought in undermining the\nconsoling and beneficial persuasion that reason is capable of assuring\nus of the existence, and presenting us with a determinate conception of\na Supreme Being?\u2014his answer would be: Nothing but the desire of\nteaching reason to know its own powers better, and, at the same time, a\ndislike of the procedure by which that faculty was compelled to support\nforegone conclusions, and prevented from confessing the internal\nweaknesses which it cannot but feel when it enters upon a rigid\nself-examination. If, on the other hand, we were to ask Priestley\u2014a\nphilosopher who had no taste for transcendental speculation, but was\nentirely devoted to the principles of empiricism\u2014what his motives were\nfor overturning those two main pillars of religion\u2014the doctrines of the\nfreedom of the will and the immortality of the soul (in his view the\nhope of a future life is but the expectation of the miracle of\nresurrection)\u2014this philosopher, himself a zealous and pious teacher of\nreligion, could give no other answer than this: I acted in the interest\nof reason, which always suffers, when certain objects are explained and\njudged by a reference to other supposed laws than those of material\nnature\u2014the only laws which we know in a determinate manner. It would be\nunfair to decry the latter philosopher, who endeavoured to harmonize\nhis paradoxical opinions with the interests of religion, and to\nundervalue an honest and reflecting man, because he finds himself at a\nloss the moment he has left the field of natural science. The same\ngrace must be accorded to Hume, a man not less well-disposed, and quite\nas blameless in his moral character, and who pushed his abstract\nspeculations to an extreme length, because, as he rightly believed, the\nobject of them lies entirely beyond the bounds of natural science, and\nwithin the sphere of pure ideas.\nWhat is to be done to provide against the danger which seems in the\npresent case to menace the best interests of humanity? The course to be\npursued in reference to this subject is a perfectly plain and natural\none. Let each thinker pursue his own path; if he shows talent, if he\ngives evidence of profound thought, in one word, if he shows that he\npossesses the power of reasoning\u2014reason is always the gainer. If you\nhave recourse to other means, if you attempt to coerce reason, if you\nraise the cry of treason to humanity, if you excite the feelings of the\ncrowd, which can neither understand nor sympathize with such subtle\nspeculations\u2014you will only make yourselves ridiculous. For the question\ndoes not concern the advantage or disadvantage which we are expected to\nreap from such inquiries; the question is merely how far reason can\nadvance in the field of speculation, apart from all kinds of interest,\nand whether we may depend upon the exertions of speculative reason, or\nmust renounce all reliance on it. Instead of joining the combatants, it\nis your part to be a tranquil spectator of the struggle\u2014a laborious\nstruggle for the parties engaged, but attended, in its progress as well\nas in its result, with the most advantageous consequences for the\ninterests of thought and knowledge. It is absurd to expect to be\nenlightened by Reason, and at the same time to prescribe to her what\nside of the question she must adopt. Moreover, reason is sufficiently\nheld in check by its own power, the limits imposed on it by its own\nnature are sufficient; it is unnecessary for you to place over it\nadditional guards, as if its power were dangerous to the constitution\nof the intellectual state. In the dialectic of reason there is no\nvictory gained which need in the least disturb your tranquility.\nThe strife of dialectic is a necessity of reason, and we cannot but\nwish that it had been conducted long ere this with that perfect freedom\nwhich ought to be its essential condition. In this case, we should have\nhad at an earlier period a matured and profound criticism, which must\nhave put an end to all dialectical disputes, by exposing the illusions\nand prejudices in which they originated.\nThere is in human nature an unworthy propensity\u2014a propensity which,\nlike everything that springs from nature, must in its final purpose be\nconducive to the good of humanity\u2014to conceal our real sentiments, and\nto give expression only to certain received opinions, which are\nregarded as at once safe and promotive of the common good. It is true,\nthis tendency, not only to conceal our real sentiments, but to profess\nthose which may gain us favour in the eyes of society, has not only\ncivilized, but, in a certain measure, moralized us; as no one can break\nthrough the outward covering of respectability, honour, and morality,\nand thus the seemingly-good examples which we see around us form an\nexcellent school for moral improvement, so long as our belief in their\ngenuineness remains unshaken. But this disposition to represent\nourselves as better than we are, and to utter opinions which are not\nour own, can be nothing more than a kind of provisionary arrangement of\nnature to lead us from the rudeness of an uncivilized state, and to\nteach us how to assume at least the appearance and manner of the good\nwe see. But when true principles have been developed, and have obtained\na sure foundation in our habit of thought, this conventionalism must be\nattacked with earnest vigour, otherwise it corrupts the heart, and\nchecks the growth of good dispositions with the mischievous weed of\nfair appearances.\nI am sorry to remark the same tendency to misrepresentation and\nhypocrisy in the sphere of speculative discussion, where there is less\ntemptation to restrain the free expression of thought. For what can be\nmore prejudicial to the interests of intelligence than to falsify our\nreal sentiments, to conceal the doubts which we feel in regard to our\nstatements, or to maintain the validity of grounds of proof which we\nwell know to be insufficient? So long as mere personal vanity is the\nsource of these unworthy artifices\u2014and this is generally the case in\nspeculative discussions, which are mostly destitute of practical\ninterest, and are incapable of complete demonstration\u2014the vanity of the\nopposite party exaggerates as much on the other side; and thus the\nresult is the same, although it is not brought about so soon as if the\ndispute had been conducted in a sincere and upright spirit. But where\nthe mass entertains the notion that the aim of certain subtle\nspeculators is nothing less than to shake the very foundations of\npublic welfare and morality\u2014it seems not only prudent, but even praise\nworthy, to maintain the good cause by illusory arguments, rather than\nto give to our supposed opponents the advantage of lowering our\ndeclarations to the moderate tone of a merely practical conviction, and\nof compelling us to confess our inability to attain to apodeictic\ncertainty in speculative subjects. But we ought to reflect that there\nis nothing, in the world more fatal to the maintenance of a good cause\nthan deceit, misrepresentation, and falsehood. That the strictest laws\nof honesty should be observed in the discussion of a purely speculative\nsubject is the least requirement that can be made. If we could reckon\nwith security even upon so little, the conflict of speculative reason\nregarding the important questions of God, immortality, and freedom,\nwould have been either decided long ago, or would very soon be brought\nto a conclusion. But, in general, the uprightness of the defence stands\nin an inverse ratio to the goodness of the cause; and perhaps more\nhonesty and fairness are shown by those who deny than by those who\nuphold these doctrines.\nI shall persuade myself, then, that I have readers who do not wish to\nsee a righteous cause defended by unfair arguments. Such will now\nrecognize the fact that, according to the principles of this Critique,\nif we consider not what is, but what ought to be the case, there can be\nreally no polemic of pure reason. For how can two persons dispute about\na thing, the reality of which neither can present in actual or even in\npossible experience? Each adopts the plan of meditating on his idea for\nthe purpose of drawing from the idea, if he can, what is more than the\nidea, that is, the reality of the object which it indicates. How shall\nthey settle the dispute, since neither is able to make his assertions\ndirectly comprehensible and certain, but must restrict himself to\nattacking and confuting those of his opponent? All statements enounced\nby pure reason transcend the conditions of possible experience, beyond\nthe sphere of which we can discover no criterion of truth, while they\nare at the same time framed in accordance with the laws of the\nunderstanding, which are applicable only to experience; and thus it is\nthe fate of all such speculative discussions that while the one party\nattacks the weaker side of his opponent, he infallibly lays open his\nown weaknesses.\nThe critique of pure reason may be regarded as the highest tribunal for\nall speculative disputes; for it is not involved in these disputes,\nwhich have an immediate relation to certain objects and not to the laws\nof the mind, but is instituted for the purpose of determining the\nrights and limits of reason.\nWithout the control of criticism, reason is, as it were, in a state of\nnature, and can only establish its claims and assertions by war.\nCriticism, on the contrary, deciding all questions according to the\nfundamental laws of its own institution, secures to us the peace of law\nand order, and enables us to discuss all differences in the more\ntranquil manner of a legal process. In the former case, disputes are\nended by victory, which both sides may claim and which is followed by a\nhollow armistice; in the latter, by a sentence, which, as it strikes at\nthe root of all speculative differences, ensures to all concerned a\nlasting peace. The endless disputes of a dogmatizing reason compel us\nto look for some mode of arriving at a settled decision by a critical\ninvestigation of reason itself; just as Hobbes maintains that the state\nof nature is a state of injustice and violence, and that we must leave\nit and submit ourselves to the constraint of law, which indeed limits\nindividual freedom, but only that it may consist with the freedom of\nothers and with the common good of all.\nThis freedom will, among other things, permit of our openly stating the\ndifficulties and doubts which we are ourselves unable to solve, without\nbeing decried on that account as turbulent and dangerous citizens. This\nprivilege forms part of the native rights of human reason, which\nrecognizes no other judge than the universal reason of humanity; and as\nthis reason is the source of all progress and improvement, such a\nprivilege is to be held sacred and inviolable. It is unwise, moreover,\nto denounce as dangerous any bold assertions against, or rash attacks\nupon, an opinion which is held by the largest and most moral class of\nthe community; for that would be giving them an importance which they\ndo not deserve. When I hear that the freedom of the will, the hope of a\nfuture life, and the existence of God have been overthrown by the\narguments of some able writer, I feel a strong desire to read his book;\nfor I expect that he will add to my knowledge and impart greater\nclearness and distinctness to my views by the argumentative power shown\nin his writings. But I am perfectly certain, even before I have opened\nthe book, that he has not succeeded in a single point, not because I\nbelieve I am in possession of irrefutable demonstrations of these\nimportant propositions, but because this transcendental critique, which\nhas disclosed to me the power and the limits of pure reason, has fully\nconvinced me that, as it is insufficient to establish the affirmative,\nit is as powerless, and even more so, to assure us of the truth of the\nnegative answer to these questions. From what source does this\nfree-thinker derive his knowledge that there is, for example, no\nSupreme Being? This proposition lies out of the field of possible\nexperience, and, therefore, beyond the limits of human cognition. But I\nwould not read at, all the answer which the dogmatical maintainer of\nthe good cause makes to his opponent, because I know well beforehand,\nthat he will merely attack the fallacious grounds of his adversary,\nwithout being able to establish his own assertions. Besides, a new\nillusory argument, in the construction of which talent and acuteness\nare shown, is suggestive of new ideas and new trains of reasoning, and\nin this respect the old and everyday sophistries are quite useless.\nAgain, the dogmatical opponent of religion gives employment to\ncriticism, and enables us to test and correct its principles, while\nthere is no occasion for anxiety in regard to the influence and results\nof his reasoning.\nBut, it will be said, must we not warn the youth entrusted to\nacademical care against such writings, must we not preserve them from\nthe knowledge of these dangerous assertions, until their judgement is\nripened, or rather until the doctrines which we wish to inculcate are\nso firmly rooted in their minds as to withstand all attempts at\ninstilling the contrary dogmas, from whatever quarter they may come?\nIf we are to confine ourselves to the dogmatical procedure in the\nsphere of pure reason, and find ourselves unable to settle such\ndisputes otherwise than by becoming a party in them, and setting\ncounter-assertions against the statements advanced by our opponents,\nthere is certainly no plan more advisable for the moment, but, at the\nsame time, none more absurd and inefficient for the future, than this\nretaining of the youthful mind under guardianship for a time, and thus\npreserving it\u2014for so long at least\u2014from seduction into error. But when,\nat a later period, either curiosity, or the prevalent fashion of\nthought places such writings in their hands, will the so-called\nconvictions of their youth stand firm? The young thinker, who has in\nhis armoury none but dogmatical weapons with which to resist the\nattacks of his opponent, and who cannot detect the latent dialectic\nwhich lies in his own opinions as well as in those of the opposite\nparty, sees the advance of illusory arguments and grounds of proof\nwhich have the advantage of novelty, against as illusory grounds of\nproof destitute of this advantage, and which, perhaps, excite the\nsuspicion that the natural credulity of his youth has been abused by\nhis instructors. He thinks he can find no better means of showing that\nhe has out grown the discipline of his minority than by despising those\nwell-meant warnings, and, knowing no system of thought but that of\ndogmatism, he drinks deep draughts of the poison that is to sap the\nprinciples in which his early years were trained.\nExactly the opposite of the system here recommended ought to be pursued\nin academical instruction. This can only be effected, however, by a\nthorough training in the critical investigation of pure reason. For, in\norder to bring the principles of this critique into exercise as soon as\npossible, and to demonstrate their perfect even in the presence of the\nhighest degree of dialectical illusion, the student ought to examine\nthe assertions made on both sides of speculative questions step by\nstep, and to test them by these principles. It cannot be a difficult\ntask for him to show the fallacies inherent in these propositions, and\nthus he begins early to feel his own power of securing himself against\nthe influence of such sophistical arguments, which must finally lose,\nfor him, all their illusory power. And, although the same blows which\noverturn the edifice of his opponent are as fatal to his own\nspeculative structures, if such he has wished to rear; he need not feel\nany sorrow in regard to this seeming misfortune, as he has now before\nhim a fair prospect into the practical region in which he may\nreasonably hope to find a more secure foundation for a rational system.\nThere is, accordingly, no proper polemic in the sphere of pure reason.\nBoth parties beat the air and fight with their own shadows, as they\npass beyond the limits of nature, and can find no tangible point of\nattack\u2014no firm footing for their dogmatical conflict. Fight as\nvigorously as they may, the shadows which they hew down, immediately\nstart up again, like the heroes in Walhalla, and renew the bloodless\nand unceasing contest.\nBut neither can we admit that there is any proper sceptical employment\nof pure reason, such as might be based upon the principle of neutrality\nin all speculative disputes. To excite reason against itself, to place\nweapons in the hands of the party on the one side as well as in those\nof the other, and to remain an undisturbed and sarcastic spectator of\nthe fierce struggle that ensues, seems, from the dogmatical point of\nview, to be a part fitting only a malevolent disposition. But, when the\nsophist evidences an invincible obstinacy and blindness, and a pride\nwhich no criticism can moderate, there is no other practicable course\nthan to oppose to this pride and obstinacy similar feelings and\npretensions on the other side, equally well or ill founded, so that\nreason, staggered by the reflections thus forced upon it, finds it\nnecessary to moderate its confidence in such pretensions and to listen\nto the advice of criticism. But we cannot stop at these doubts, much\nless regard the conviction of our ignorance, not only as a cure for the\nconceit natural to dogmatism, but as the settlement of the disputes in\nwhich reason is involved with itself. On the contrary, scepticism is\nmerely a means of awakening reason from its dogmatic dreams and\nexciting it to a more careful investigation into its own powers and\npretensions. But, as scepticism appears to be the shortest road to a\npermanent peace in the domain of philosophy, and as it is the track\npursued by the many who aim at giving a philosophical colouring to\ntheir contemptuous dislike of all inquiries of this kind, I think it\nnecessary to present to my readers this mode of thought in its true\nlight.\n_Scepticism not a Permanent State for Human Reason._\nThe consciousness of ignorance\u2014unless this ignorance is recognized to\nbe absolutely necessary ought, instead of forming the conclusion of my\ninquiries, to be the strongest motive to the pursuit of them. All\nignorance is either ignorance of things or of the limits of knowledge.\nIf my ignorance is accidental and not necessary, it must incite me, in\nthe first case, to a dogmatical inquiry regarding the objects of which\nI am ignorant; in the second, to a critical investigation into the\nbounds of all possible knowledge. But that my ignorance is absolutely\nnecessary and unavoidable, and that it consequently absolves from the\nduty of all further investigation, is a fact which cannot be made out\nupon empirical grounds\u2014from observation\u2014but upon critical grounds\nalone, that is, by a thoroughgoing investigation into the primary\nsources of cognition. It follows that the determination of the bounds\nof reason can be made only on \u00e0 priori grounds; while the empirical\nlimitation of reason, which is merely an indeterminate cognition of an\nignorance that can never be completely removed, can take place only \u00e0\nposteriori. In other words, our empirical knowledge is limited by that\nwhich yet remains for us to know. The former cognition of our\nignorance, which is possible only on a rational basis, is a science;\nthe latter is merely a perception, and we cannot say how far the\ninferences drawn from it may extend. If I regard the earth, as it\nreally appears to my senses, as a flat surface, I am ignorant how far\nthis surface extends. But experience teaches me that, how far soever I\ngo, I always see before me a space in which I can proceed farther; and\nthus I know the limits\u2014merely visual\u2014of my actual knowledge of the\nearth, although I am ignorant of the limits of the earth itself. But if\nI have got so far as to know that the earth is a sphere, and that its\nsurface is spherical, I can cognize \u00e0 priori and determine upon\nprinciples, from my knowledge of a small part of this surface\u2014say to\nthe extent of a degree\u2014the diameter and circumference of the earth; and\nalthough I am ignorant of the objects which this surface contains, I\nhave a perfect knowledge of its limits and extent.\nThe sum of all the possible objects of our cognition seems to us to be\na level surface, with an apparent horizon\u2014that which forms the limit of\nits extent, and which has been termed by us the idea of unconditioned\ntotality. To reach this limit by empirical means is impossible, and all\nattempts to determine it \u00e0 priori according to a principle, are alike\nin vain. But all the questions raised by pure reason relate to that\nwhich lies beyond this horizon, or, at least, in its boundary line.\nThe celebrated David Hume was one of those geographers of human reason\nwho believe that they have given a sufficient answer to all such\nquestions by declaring them to lie beyond the horizon of our\nknowledge\u2014a horizon which, however, Hume was unable to determine. His\nattention especially was directed to the principle of causality; and he\nremarked with perfect justice that the truth of this principle, and\neven the objective validity of the conception of a cause, was not\ncommonly based upon clear insight, that is, upon \u00e0 priori cognition.\nHence he concluded that this law does not derive its authority from its\nuniversality and necessity, but merely from its general applicability\nin the course of experience, and a kind of subjective necessity thence\narising, which he termed habit. From the inability of reason to\nestablish this principle as a necessary law for the acquisition of all\nexperience, he inferred the nullity of all the attempts of reason to\npass the region of the empirical.\nThis procedure of subjecting the facta of reason to examination, and,\nif necessary, to disapproval, may be termed the censura of reason. This\ncensura must inevitably lead us to doubts regarding all transcendent\nemployment of principles. But this is only the second step in our\ninquiry. The first step in regard to the subjects of pure reason, and\nwhich marks the infancy of that faculty, is that of dogmatism. The\nsecond, which we have just mentioned, is that of scepticism, and it\ngives evidence that our judgement has been improved by experience. But\na third step is necessary\u2014indicative of the maturity and manhood of the\njudgement, which now lays a firm foundation upon universal and\nnecessary principles. This is the period of criticism, in which we do\nnot examine the facta of reason, but reason itself, in the whole extent\nof its powers, and in regard to its capability of \u00e0 priori cognition;\nand thus we determine not merely the empirical and ever-shifting bounds\nof our knowledge, but its necessary and eternal limits. We demonstrate\nfrom indubitable principles, not merely our ignorance in respect to\nthis or that subject, but in regard to all possible questions of a\ncertain class. Thus scepticism is a resting place for reason, in which\nit may reflect on its dogmatical wanderings and gain some knowledge of\nthe region in which it happens to be, that it may pursue its way with\ngreater certainty; but it cannot be its permanent dwelling-place. It\nmust take up its abode only in the region of complete certitude,\nwhether this relates to the cognition of objects themselves, or to the\nlimits which bound all our cognition.\nReason is not to be considered as an indefinitely extended plane, of\nthe bounds of which we have only a general knowledge; it ought rather\nto be compared to a sphere, the radius of which may be found from the\ncurvature of its surface\u2014that is, the nature of \u00e0 priori synthetical\npropositions\u2014and, consequently, its circumference and extent. Beyond\nthe sphere of experience there are no objects which it can cognize;\nnay, even questions regarding such supposititious objects relate only\nto the subjective principles of a complete determination of the\nrelations which exist between the understanding-conceptions which lie\nwithin this sphere.\nWe are actually in possession of \u00e0 priori synthetical cognitions, as is\nproved by the existence of the principles of the understanding, which\nanticipate experience. If any one cannot comprehend the possibility of\nthese principles, he may have some reason to doubt whether they are\nreally \u00e0 priori; but he cannot on this account declare them to be\nimpossible, and affirm the nullity of the steps which reason may have\ntaken under their guidance. He can only say: If we perceived their\norigin and their authenticity, we should be able to determine the\nextent and limits of reason; but, till we can do this, all propositions\nregarding the latter are mere random assertions. In this view, the\ndoubt respecting all dogmatical philosophy, which proceeds without the\nguidance of criticism, is well grounded; but we cannot therefore deny\nto reason the ability to construct a sound philosophy, when the way has\nbeen prepared by a thorough critical investigation. All the conceptions\nproduced, and all the questions raised, by pure reason, do not lie in\nthe sphere of experience, but in that of reason itself, and hence they\nmust be solved, and shown to be either valid or inadmissible, by that\nfaculty. We have no right to decline the solution of such problems, on\nthe ground that the solution can be discovered only from the nature of\nthings, and under pretence of the limitation of human faculties, for\nreason is the sole creator of all these ideas, and is therefore bound\neither to establish their validity or to expose their illusory nature.\nThe polemic of scepticism is properly directed against the dogmatist,\nwho erects a system of philosophy without having examined the\nfundamental objective principles on which it is based, for the purpose\nof evidencing the futility of his designs, and thus bringing him to a\nknowledge of his own powers. But, in itself, scepticism does not give\nus any certain information in regard to the bounds of our knowledge.\nAll unsuccessful dogmatical attempts of reason are facia, which it is\nalways useful to submit to the censure of the sceptic. But this cannot\nhelp us to any decision regarding the expectations which reason\ncherishes of better success in future endeavours; the investigations of\nscepticism cannot, therefore, settle the dispute regarding the rights\nand powers of human reason.\nHume is perhaps the ablest and most ingenious of all sceptical\nphilosophers, and his writings have, undoubtedly, exerted the most\npowerful influence in awakening reason to a thorough investigation into\nits own powers. It will, therefore, well repay our labours to consider\nfor a little the course of reasoning which he followed and the errors\ninto which he strayed, although setting out on the path of truth and\ncertitude.\nHume was probably aware, although he never clearly developed the\nnotion, that we proceed in judgements of a certain class beyond our\nconception of the object. I have termed this kind of judgement\nsynthetical. As regard the manner in which I pass beyond my conception\nby the aid of experience, no doubts can be entertained. Experience is\nitself a synthesis of perceptions; and it employs perceptions to\nincrement the conception, which I obtain by means of another\nperception. But we feel persuaded that we are able to proceed beyond a\nconception, and to extend our cognition \u00e0 priori. We attempt this in\ntwo ways\u2014either, through the pure understanding, in relation to that\nwhich may become an object of experience, or, through pure reason, in\nrelation to such properties of things, or of the existence of things,\nas can never be presented in any experience. This sceptical philosopher\ndid not distinguish these two kinds of judgements, as he ought to have\ndone, but regarded this augmentation of conceptions, and, if we may so\nexpress ourselves, the spontaneous generation of understanding and\nreason, independently of the impregnation of experience, as altogether\nimpossible. The so-called \u00e0 priori principles of these faculties he\nconsequently held to be invalid and imaginary, and regarded them as\nnothing but subjective habits of thought originating in experience, and\ntherefore purely empirical and contingent rules, to which we attribute\na spurious necessity and universality. In support of this strange\nassertion, he referred us to the generally acknowledged principle of\nthe relation between cause and effect. No faculty of the mind can\nconduct us from the conception of a thing to the existence of something\nelse; and hence he believed he could infer that, without experience, we\npossess no source from which we can augment a conception, and no ground\nsufficient to justify us in framing a judgement that is to extend our\ncognition \u00e0 priori. That the light of the sun, which shines upon a\npiece of wax, at the same time melts it, while it hardens clay, no\npower of the understanding could infer from the conceptions which we\npreviously possessed of these substances; much less is there any \u00e0\npriori law that could conduct us to such a conclusion, which experience\nalone can certify. On the other hand, we have seen in our discussion of\ntranscendental logic, that, although we can never proceed immediately\nbeyond the content of the conception which is given us, we can always\ncognize completely \u00e0 priori\u2014in relation, however, to a third term,\nnamely, possible experience\u2014the law of its connection with other\nthings. For example, if I observe that a piece of wax melts, I can\ncognize \u00e0 priori that there must have been something (the sun\u2019s heat)\npreceding, which this law; although, without the aid of experience, I\ncould not cognize \u00e0 priori and in a determinate manner either the cause\nfrom the effect, or the effect from the cause. Hume was, therefore,\nwrong in inferring, from the contingency of the determination according\nto law, the contingency of the law itself; and the passing beyond the\nconception of a thing to possible experience (which is an \u00e0 priori\nproceeding, constituting the objective reality of the conception), he\nconfounded with our synthesis of objects in actual experience, which is\nalways, of course, empirical. Thus, too, he regarded the principle of\naffinity, which has its seat in the understanding and indicates a\nnecessary connection, as a mere rule of association, lying in the\nimitative faculty of imagination, which can present only contingent,\nand not objective connections.\nThe sceptical errors of this remarkably acute thinker arose principally\nfrom a defect, which was common to him with the dogmatists, namely,\nthat he had never made a systematic review of all the different kinds\nof \u00e0 priori synthesis performed by the understanding. Had he done so,\nhe would have found, to take one example among many, that the principle\nof permanence was of this character, and that it, as well as the\nprinciple of causality, anticipates experience. In this way he might\nhave been able to describe the determinate limits of the \u00e0 priori\noperations of understanding and reason. But he merely declared the\nunderstanding to be limited, instead of showing what its limits were;\nhe created a general mistrust in the power of our faculties, without\ngiving us any determinate knowledge of the bounds of our necessary and\nunavoidable ignorance; he examined and condemned some of the principles\nof the understanding, without investigating all its powers with the\ncompleteness necessary to criticism. He denies, with truth, certain\npowers to the understanding, but he goes further, and declares it to be\nutterly inadequate to the \u00e0 priori extension of knowledge, although he\nhas not fully examined all the powers which reside in the faculty; and\nthus the fate which always overtakes scepticism meets him too. That is\nto say, his own declarations are doubted, for his objections were based\nupon facta, which are contingent, and not upon principles, which can\nalone demonstrate the necessary invalidity of all dogmatical\nassertions.\nAs Hume makes no distinction between the well-grounded claims of the\nunderstanding and the dialectical pretensions of reason, against which,\nhowever, his attacks are mainly directed, reason does not feel itself\nshut out from all attempts at the extension of \u00e0 priori cognition, and\nhence it refuses, in spite of a few checks in this or that quarter, to\nrelinquish such efforts. For one naturally arms oneself to resist an\nattack, and becomes more obstinate in the resolve to establish the\nclaims he has advanced. But a complete review of the powers of reason,\nand the conviction thence arising that we are in possession of a\nlimited field of action, while we must admit the vanity of higher\nclaims, puts an end to all doubt and dispute, and induces reason to\nrest satisfied with the undisturbed possession of its limited domain.\nTo the uncritical dogmatist, who has not surveyed the sphere of his\nunderstanding, nor determined, in accordance with principles, the\nlimits of possible cognition, who, consequently, is ignorant of his own\npowers, and believes he will discover them by the attempts he makes in\nthe field of cognition, these attacks of scepticism are not only\ndangerous, but destructive. For if there is one proposition in his\nchain of reasoning which he cannot prove, or the fallacy in which he\ncannot evolve in accordance with a principle, suspicion falls on all\nhis statements, however plausible they may appear.\nAnd thus scepticism, the bane of dogmatical philosophy, conducts us to\na sound investigation into the understanding and the reason. When we\nare thus far advanced, we need fear no further attacks; for the limits\nof our domain are clearly marked out, and we can make no claims nor\nbecome involved in any disputes regarding the region that lies beyond\nthese limits. Thus the sceptical procedure in philosophy does not\npresent any solution of the problems of reason, but it forms an\nexcellent exercise for its powers, awakening its circumspection, and\nindicating the means whereby it may most fully establish its claims to\nits legitimate possessions.\nSection III. The Discipline of Pure Reason in Hypothesis\nThis critique of reason has now taught us that all its efforts to\nextend the bounds of knowledge, by means of pure speculation, are\nutterly fruitless. So much the wider field, it may appear, lies open to\nhypothesis; as, where we cannot know with certainty, we are at liberty\nto make guesses and to form suppositions.\nImagination may be allowed, under the strict surveillance of reason, to\ninvent suppositions; but, these must be based on something that is\nperfectly certain\u2014and that is the possibility of the object. If we are\nwell assured upon this point, it is allowable to have recourse to\nsupposition in regard to the reality of the object; but this\nsupposition must, unless it is utterly groundless, be connected, as its\nground of explanation, with that which is really given and absolutely\ncertain. Such a supposition is termed a hypothesis.\nIt is beyond our power to form the least conception \u00e0 priori of the\npossibility of dynamical connection in phenomena; and the category of\nthe pure understanding will not enable us to excogitate any such\nconnection, but merely helps us to understand it, when we meet with it\nin experience. For this reason we cannot, in accordance with the\ncategories, imagine or invent any object or any property of an object\nnot given, or that may not be given in experience, and employ it in a\nhypothesis; otherwise, we should be basing our chain of reasoning upon\nmere chimerical fancies, and not upon conceptions of things. Thus, we\nhave no right to assume the existence of new powers, not existing in\nnature\u2014for example, an understanding with a non-sensuous intuition, a\nforce of attraction without contact, or some new kind of substances\noccupying space, and yet without the property of impenetrability\u2014and,\nconsequently, we cannot assume that there is any other kind of\ncommunity among substances than that observable in experience, any kind\nof presence than that in space, or any kind of duration than that in\ntime. In one word, the conditions of possible experience are for reason\nthe only conditions of the possibility of things; reason cannot venture\nto form, independently of these conditions, any conceptions of things,\nbecause such conceptions, although not self-contradictory, are without\nobject and without application.\nThe conceptions of reason are, as we have already shown, mere ideas,\nand do not relate to any object in any kind of experience. At the same\ntime, they do not indicate imaginary or possible objects. They are\npurely problematical in their nature and, as aids to the heuristic\nexercise of the faculties, form the basis of the regulative principles\nfor the systematic employment of the understanding in the field of\nexperience. If we leave this ground of experience, they become mere\nfictions of thought, the possibility of which is quite indemonstrable;\nand they cannot, consequently, be employed as hypotheses in the\nexplanation of real phenomena. It is quite admissible to cogitate the\nsoul as simple, for the purpose of enabling ourselves to employ the\nidea of a perfect and necessary unity of all the faculties of the mind\nas the principle of all our inquiries into its internal phenomena,\nalthough we cannot cognize this unity in concreto. But to assume that\nthe soul is a simple substance (a transcendental conception) would be\nenouncing a proposition which is not only indemonstrable\u2014as many\nphysical hypotheses are\u2014but a proposition which is purely arbitrary,\nand in the highest degree rash. The simple is never presented in\nexperience; and, if by substance is here meant the permanent object of\nsensuous intuition, the possibility of a simple phenomenon is perfectly\ninconceivable. Reason affords no good grounds for admitting the\nexistence of intelligible beings, or of intelligible properties of\nsensuous things, although\u2014as we have no conception either of their\npossibility or of their impossibility\u2014it will always be out of our\npower to affirm dogmatically that they do not exist. In the explanation\nof given phenomena, no other things and no other grounds of explanation\ncan be employed than those which stand in connection with the given\nphenomena according to the known laws of experience. A transcendental\nhypothesis, in which a mere idea of reason is employed to explain the\nphenomena of nature, would not give us any better insight into a\nphenomenon, as we should be trying to explain what we do not\nsufficiently understand from known empirical principles, by what we do\nnot understand at all. The principles of such a hypothesis might\nconduce to the satisfaction of reason, but it would not assist the\nunderstanding in its application to objects. Order and conformity to\naims in the sphere of nature must be themselves explained upon natural\ngrounds and according to natural laws; and the wildest hypotheses, if\nthey are only physical, are here more admissible than a hyperphysical\nhypothesis, such as that of a divine author. For such a hypothesis\nwould introduce the principle of ignava ratio, which requires us to\ngive up the search for causes that might be discovered in the course of\nexperience and to rest satisfied with a mere idea. As regards the\nabsolute totality of the grounds of explanation in the series of these\ncauses, this can be no hindrance to the understanding in the case of\nphenomena; because, as they are to us nothing more than phenomena, we\nhave no right to look for anything like completeness in the synthesis\nof the series of their conditions.\nTranscendental hypotheses are therefore inadmissible; and we cannot use\nthe liberty of employing, in the absence of physical, hyperphysical\ngrounds of explanation. And this for two reasons; first, because such\nhypothesis do not advance reason, but rather stop it in its progress;\nsecondly, because this licence would render fruitless all its exertions\nin its own proper sphere, which is that of experience. For, when the\nexplanation of natural phenomena happens to be difficult, we have\nconstantly at hand a transcendental ground of explanation, which lifts\nus above the necessity of investigating nature; and our inquiries are\nbrought to a close, not because we have obtained all the requisite\nknowledge, but because we abut upon a principle which is\nincomprehensible and which, indeed, is so far back in the track of\nthought as to contain the conception of the absolutely primal being.\nThe next requisite for the admissibility of a hypothesis is its\nsufficiency. That is, it must determine \u00e0 priori the consequences which\nare given in experience and which are supposed to follow from the\nhypothesis itself. If we require to employ auxiliary hypotheses, the\nsuspicion naturally arises that they are mere fictions; because the\nnecessity for each of them requires the same justification as in the\ncase of the original hypothesis, and thus their testimony is invalid.\nIf we suppose the existence of an infinitely perfect cause, we possess\nsufficient grounds for the explanation of the conformity to aims, the\norder and the greatness which we observe in the universe; but we find\nourselves obliged, when we observe the evil in the world and the\nexceptions to these laws, to employ new hypothesis in support of the\noriginal one. We employ the idea of the simple nature of the human soul\nas the foundation of all the theories we may form of its phenomena; but\nwhen we meet with difficulties in our way, when we observe in the soul\nphenomena similar to the changes which take place in matter, we require\nto call in new auxiliary hypotheses. These may, indeed, not be false,\nbut we do not know them to be true, because the only witness to their\ncertitude is the hypothesis which they themselves have been called in\nto explain.\nWe are not discussing the above-mentioned assertions regarding the\nimmaterial unity of the soul and the existence of a Supreme Being as\ndogmata, which certain philosophers profess to demonstrate \u00e0 priori,\nbut purely as hypotheses. In the former case, the dogmatist must take\ncare that his arguments possess the apodeictic certainty of a\ndemonstration. For the assertion that the reality of such ideas is\nprobable is as absurd as a proof of the probability of a proposition in\ngeometry. Pure abstract reason, apart from all experience, can either\ncognize nothing at all; and hence the judgements it enounces are never\nmere opinions, they are either apodeictic certainties, or declarations\nthat nothing can be known on the subject. Opinions and probable\njudgements on the nature of things can only be employed to explain\ngiven phenomena, or they may relate to the effect, in accordance with\nempirical laws, of an actually existing cause. In other words, we must\nrestrict the sphere of opinion to the world of experience and nature.\nBeyond this region opinion is mere invention; unless we are groping\nabout for the truth on a path not yet fully known, and have some hopes\nof stumbling upon it by chance.\nBut, although hypotheses are inadmissible in answers to the questions\nof pure speculative reason, they may be employed in the defence of\nthese answers. That is to say, hypotheses are admissible in polemic,\nbut not in the sphere of dogmatism. By the defence of statements of\nthis character, I do not mean an attempt at discovering new grounds for\ntheir support, but merely the refutation of the arguments of opponents.\nAll \u00e0 priori synthetical propositions possess the peculiarity that,\nalthough the philosopher who maintains the reality of the ideas\ncontained in the proposition is not in possession of sufficient\nknowledge to establish the certainty of his statements, his opponent is\nas little able to prove the truth of the opposite. This equality of\nfortune does not allow the one party to be superior to the other in the\nsphere of speculative cognition; and it is this sphere, accordingly,\nthat is the proper arena of these endless speculative conflicts. But we\nshall afterwards show that, in relation to its practical exercise,\nReason has the right of admitting what, in the field of pure\nspeculation, she would not be justified in supposing, except upon\nperfectly sufficient grounds; because all such suppositions destroy the\nnecessary completeness of speculation\u2014a condition which the practical\nreason, however, does not consider to be requisite. In this sphere,\ntherefore, Reason is mistress of a possession, her title to which she\ndoes not require to prove\u2014which, in fact, she could not do. The burden\nof proof accordingly rests upon the opponent. But as he has just as\nlittle knowledge regarding the subject discussed, and is as little able\nto prove the non-existence of the object of an idea, as the philosopher\non the other side is to demonstrate its reality, it is evident that\nthere is an advantage on the side of the philosopher who maintains his\nproposition as a practically necessary supposition (melior est conditio\npossidentis). For he is at liberty to employ, in self-defence, the same\nweapons as his opponent makes use of in attacking him; that is, he has\na right to use hypotheses not for the purpose of supporting the\narguments in favour of his own propositions, but to show that his\nopponent knows no more than himself regarding the subject under\ndiscussion and cannot boast of any speculative advantage.\nHypotheses are, therefore, admissible in the sphere of pure reason only\nas weapons for self-defence, and not as supports to dogmatical\nassertions. But the opposing party we must always seek for in\nourselves. For speculative reason is, in the sphere of\ntranscendentalism, dialectical in its own nature. The difficulties and\nobjections we have to fear lie in ourselves. They are like old but\nnever superannuated claims; and we must seek them out, and settle them\nonce and for ever, if we are to expect a permanent peace. External\ntranquility is hollow and unreal. The root of these contradictions,\nwhich lies in the nature of human reason, must be destroyed; and this\ncan only be done by giving it, in the first instance, freedom to grow,\nnay, by nourishing it, that it may send out shoots, and thus betray its\nown existence. It is our duty, therefore, to try to discover new\nobjections, to put weapons in the bands of our opponent, and to grant\nhim the most favourable position in the arena that he can wish. We have\nnothing to fear from these concessions; on the contrary, we may rather\nhope that we shall thus make ourselves master of a possession which no\none will ever venture to dispute.\nThe thinker requires, to be fully equipped, the hypotheses of pure\nreason, which, although but leaden weapons (for they have not been\nsteeled in the armoury of experience), are as useful as any that can be\nemployed by his opponents. If, accordingly, we have assumed, from a\nnon-speculative point of view, the immaterial nature of the soul, and\nare met by the objection that experience seems to prove that the growth\nand decay of our mental faculties are mere modifications of the\nsensuous organism\u2014we can weaken the force of this objection by the\nassumption that the body is nothing but the fundamental phenomenon, to\nwhich, as a necessary condition, all sensibility, and consequently all\nthought, relates in the present state of our existence; and that the\nseparation of soul and body forms the conclusion of the sensuous\nexercise of our power of cognition and the beginning of the\nintellectual. The body would, in this view of the question, be\nregarded, not as the cause of thought, but merely as its restrictive\ncondition, as promotive of the sensuous and animal, but as a hindrance\nto the pure and spiritual life; and the dependence of the animal life\non the constitution of the body, would not prove that the whole life of\nman was also dependent on the state of the organism. We might go still\nfarther, and discover new objections, or carry out to their extreme\nconsequences those which have already been adduced.\nGeneration, in the human race as well as among the irrational animals,\ndepends on so many accidents\u2014of occasion, of proper sustenance, of the\nlaws enacted by the government of a country of vice even, that it is\ndifficult to believe in the eternal existence of a being whose life has\nbegun under circumstances so mean and trivial, and so entirely\ndependent upon our own control. As regards the continuance of the\nexistence of the whole race, we need have no difficulties, for accident\nin single cases is subject to general laws; but, in the case of each\nindividual, it would seem as if we could hardly expect so wonderful an\neffect from causes so insignificant. But, in answer to these\nobjections, we may adduce the transcendental hypothesis that all life\nis properly intelligible, and not subject to changes of time, and that\nit neither began in birth, nor will end in death. We may assume that\nthis life is nothing more than a sensuous representation of pure\nspiritual life; that the whole world of sense is but an image, hovering\nbefore the faculty of cognition which we exercise in this sphere, and\nwith no more objective reality than a dream; and that if we could\nintuite ourselves and other things as they really are, we should see\nourselves in a world of spiritual natures, our connection with which\ndid not begin at our birth and will not cease with the destruction of\nthe body. And so on.\nWe cannot be said to know what has been above asserted, nor do we\nseriously maintain the truth of these assertions; and the notions\ntherein indicated are not even ideas of reason, they are purely\nfictitious conceptions. But this hypothetical procedure is in perfect\nconformity with the laws of reason. Our opponent mistakes the absence\nof empirical conditions for a proof of the complete impossibility of\nall that we have asserted; and we have to show him that he has not\nexhausted the whole sphere of possibility and that he can as little\ncompass that sphere by the laws of experience and nature, as we can lay\na secure foundation for the operations of reason beyond the region of\nexperience. Such hypothetical defences against the pretensions of an\nopponent must not be regarded as declarations of opinion. The\nphilosopher abandons them, so soon as the opposite party renounces its\ndogmatical conceit. To maintain a simply negative position in relation\nto propositions which rest on an insecure foundation, well befits the\nmoderation of a true philosopher; but to uphold the objections urged\nagainst an opponent as proofs of the opposite statement is a proceeding\njust as unwarrantable and arrogant as it is to attack the position of a\nphilosopher who advances affirmative propositions regarding such a\nsubject.\nIt is evident, therefore, that hypotheses, in the speculative sphere,\nare valid, not as independent propositions, but only relatively to\nopposite transcendent assumptions. For, to make the principles of\npossible experience conditions of the possibility of things in general\nis just as transcendent a procedure as to maintain the objective\nreality of ideas which can be applied to no objects except such as lie\nwithout the limits of possible experience. The judgements enounced by\npure reason must be necessary, or they must not be enounced at all.\nReason cannot trouble herself with opinions. But the hypotheses we have\nbeen discussing are merely problematical judgements, which can neither\nbe confuted nor proved; while, therefore, they are not personal\nopinions, they are indispensable as answers to objections which are\nliable to be raised. But we must take care to confine them to this\nfunction, and guard against any assumption on their part of absolute\nvalidity, a proceeding which would involve reason in inextricable\ndifficulties and contradictions.\nSection IV. The Discipline of Pure Reason in Relation to Proofs\nIt is a peculiarity, which distinguishes the proofs of transcendental\nsynthetical propositions from those of all other \u00e0 priori synthetical\ncognitions, that reason, in the case of the former, does not apply its\nconceptions directly to an object, but is first obliged to prove, \u00e0\npriori, the objective validity of these conceptions and the possibility\nof their syntheses. This is not merely a prudential rule, it is\nessential to the very possibility of the proof of a transcendental\nproposition. If I am required to pass, \u00e0 priori, beyond the conception\nof an object, I find that it is utterly impossible without the guidance\nof something which is not contained in the conception. In mathematics,\nit is \u00e0 priori intuition that guides my synthesis; and, in this case,\nall our conclusions may be drawn immediately from pure intuition. In\ntranscendental cognition, so long as we are dealing only with\nconceptions of the understanding, we are guided by possible experience.\nThat is to say, a proof in the sphere of transcendental cognition does\nnot show that the given conception (that of an event, for example)\nleads directly to another conception (that of a cause)\u2014for this would\nbe a saltus which nothing can justify; but it shows that experience\nitself, and consequently the object of experience, is impossible\nwithout the connection indicated by these conceptions. It follows that\nsuch a proof must demonstrate the possibility of arriving,\nsynthetically and \u00e0 priori, at a certain knowledge of things, which was\nnot contained in our conceptions of these things. Unless we pay\nparticular attention to this requirement, our proofs, instead of\npursuing the straight path indicated by reason, follow the tortuous\nroad of mere subjective association. The illusory conviction, which\nrests upon subjective causes of association, and which is considered as\nresulting from the perception of a real and objective natural affinity,\nis always open to doubt and suspicion. For this reason, all the\nattempts which have been made to prove the principle of sufficient\nreason, have, according to the universal admission of philosophers,\nbeen quite unsuccessful; and, before the appearance of transcendental\ncriticism, it was considered better, as this principle could not be\nabandoned, to appeal boldly to the common sense of mankind (a\nproceeding which always proves that the problem, which reason ought to\nsolve, is one in which philosophers find great difficulties), rather\nthan attempt to discover new dogmatical proofs.\nBut, if the proposition to be proved is a proposition of pure reason,\nand if I aim at passing beyond my empirical conceptions by the aid of\nmere ideas, it is necessary that the proof should first show that such\na step in synthesis is possible (which it is not), before it proceeds\nto prove the truth of the proposition itself. The so-called proof of\nthe simple nature of the soul from the unity of apperception, is a very\nplausible one. But it contains no answer to the objection, that, as the\nnotion of absolute simplicity is not a conception which is directly\napplicable to a perception, but is an idea which must be inferred\u2014if at\nall\u2014from observation, it is by no means evident how the mere fact of\nconsciousness, which is contained in all thought, although in so far a\nsimple representation, can conduct me to the consciousness and\ncognition of a thing which is purely a thinking substance. When I\nrepresent to my mind the power of my body as in motion, my body in this\nthought is so far absolute unity, and my representation of it is a\nsimple one; and hence I can indicate this representation by the motion\nof a point, because I have made abstraction of the size or volume of\nthe body. But I cannot hence infer that, given merely the moving power\nof a body, the body may be cogitated as simple substance, merely\nbecause the representation in my mind takes no account of its content\nin space, and is consequently simple. The simple, in abstraction, is\nvery different from the objectively simple; and hence the Ego, which is\nsimple in the first sense, may, in the second sense, as indicating the\nsoul itself, be a very complex conception, with a very various content.\nThus it is evident that in all such arguments there lurks a paralogism.\nWe guess (for without some such surmise our suspicion would not be\nexcited in reference to a proof of this character) at the presence of\nthe paralogism, by keeping ever before us a criterion of the\npossibility of those synthetical propositions which aim at proving more\nthan experience can teach us. This criterion is obtained from the\nobservation that such proofs do not lead us directly from the subject\nof the proposition to be proved to the required predicate, but find it\nnecessary to presuppose the possibility of extending our cognition \u00e0\npriori by means of ideas. We must, accordingly, always use the greatest\ncaution; we require, before attempting any proof, to consider how it is\npossible to extend the sphere of cognition by the operations of pure\nreason, and from what source we are to derive knowledge, which is not\nobtained from the analysis of conceptions, nor relates, by\nanticipation, to possible experience. We shall thus spare ourselves\nmuch severe and fruitless labour, by not expecting from reason what is\nbeyond its power, or rather by subjecting it to discipline, and\nteaching it to moderate its vehement desires for the extension of the\nsphere of cognition.\nThe first rule for our guidance is, therefore, not to attempt a\ntranscendental proof, before we have considered from what source we are\nto derive the principles upon which the proof is to be based, and what\nright we have to expect that our conclusions from these principles will\nbe veracious. If they are principles of the understanding, it is vain\nto expect that we should attain by their means to ideas of pure reason;\nfor these principles are valid only in regard to objects of possible\nexperience. If they are principles of pure reason, our labour is alike\nin vain. For the principles of reason, if employed as objective, are\nwithout exception dialectical and possess no validity or truth, except\nas regulative principles of the systematic employment of reason in\nexperience. But when such delusive proof are presented to us, it is our\nduty to meet them with the non liquet of a matured judgement; and,\nalthough we are unable to expose the particular sophism upon which the\nproof is based, we have a right to demand a deduction of the principles\nemployed in it; and, if these principles have their origin in pure\nreason alone, such a deduction is absolutely impossible. And thus it is\nunnecessary that we should trouble ourselves with the exposure and\nconfutation of every sophistical illusion; we may, at once, bring all\ndialectic, which is inexhaustible in the production of fallacies,\nbefore the bar of critical reason, which tests the principles upon\nwhich all dialectical procedure is based. The second peculiarity of\ntranscendental proof is that a transcendental proposition cannot rest\nupon more than a single proof. If I am drawing conclusions, not from\nconceptions, but from intuition corresponding to a conception, be it\npure intuition, as in mathematics, or empirical, as in natural science,\nthe intuition which forms the basis of my inferences presents me with\nmaterials for many synthetical propositions, which I can connect in\nvarious modes, while, as it is allowable to proceed from different\npoints in the intention, I can arrive by different paths at the same\nproposition.\nBut every transcendental proposition sets out from a conception, and\nposits the synthetical condition of the possibility of an object\naccording to this conception. There must, therefore, be but one ground\nof proof, because it is the conception alone which determines the\nobject; and thus the proof cannot contain anything more than the\ndetermination of the object according to the conception. In our\nTranscendental Analytic, for example, we inferred the principle: Every\nevent has a cause, from the only condition of the objective possibility\nof our conception of an event. This is that an event cannot be\ndetermined in time, and consequently cannot form a part of experience,\nunless it stands under this dynamical law. This is the only possible\nground of proof; for our conception of an event possesses objective\nvalidity, that is, is a true conception, only because the law of\ncausality determines an object to which it can refer. Other arguments\nin support of this principle have been attempted\u2014such as that from the\ncontingent nature of a phenomenon; but when this argument is\nconsidered, we can discover no criterion of contingency, except the\nfact of an event\u2014of something happening, that is to say, the existence\nwhich is preceded by the non-existence of an object, and thus we fall\nback on the very thing to be proved. If the proposition: \u201cEvery\nthinking being is simple,\u201d is to be proved, we keep to the conception\nof the ego, which is simple, and to which all thought has a relation.\nThe same is the case with the transcendental proof of the existence of\na Deity, which is based solely upon the harmony and reciprocal fitness\nof the conceptions of an ens realissimum and a necessary being, and\ncannot be attempted in any other manner.\nThis caution serves to simplify very much the criticism of all\npropositions of reason. When reason employs conceptions alone, only one\nproof of its thesis is possible, if any. When, therefore, the dogmatist\nadvances with ten arguments in favour of a proposition, we may be sure\nthat not one of them is conclusive. For if he possessed one which\nproved the proposition he brings forward to demonstration\u2014as must\nalways be the case with the propositions of pure reason\u2014what need is\nthere for any more? His intention can only be similar to that of the\nadvocate who had different arguments for different judges; this\navailing himself of the weakness of those who examine his arguments,\nwho, without going into any profound investigation, adopt the view of\nthe case which seems most probable at first sight and decide according\nto it.\nThe third rule for the guidance of pure reason in the conduct of a\nproof is that all transcendental proofs must never be apagogic or\nindirect, but always ostensive or direct. The direct or ostensive proof\nnot only establishes the truth of the proposition to be proved, but\nexposes the grounds of its truth; the apagogic, on the other hand, may\nassure us of the truth of the proposition, but it cannot enable us to\ncomprehend the grounds of its possibility. The latter is, accordingly,\nrather an auxiliary to an argument, than a strictly philosophical and\nrational mode of procedure. In one respect, however, they have an\nadvantage over direct proofs, from the fact that the mode of arguing by\ncontradiction, which they employ, renders our understanding of the\nquestion more clear, and approximates the proof to the certainty of an\nintuitional demonstration.\nThe true reason why indirect proofs are employed in different sciences\nis this. When the grounds upon which we seek to base a cognition are\ntoo various or too profound, we try whether or not we may not discover\nthe truth of our cognition from its consequences. The modus ponens of\nreasoning from the truth of its inferences to the truth of a\nproposition would be admissible if all the inferences that can be drawn\nfrom it are known to be true; for in this case there can be only one\npossible ground for these inferences, and that is the true one. But\nthis is a quite impracticable procedure, as it surpasses all our powers\nto discover all the possible inferences that can be drawn from a\nproposition. But this mode of reasoning is employed, under favour, when\nwe wish to prove the truth of an hypothesis; in which case we admit the\ntruth of the conclusion\u2014which is supported by analogy\u2014that, if all the\ninferences we have drawn and examined agree with the proposition\nassumed, all other possible inferences will also agree with it. But, in\nthis way, an hypothesis can never be established as a demonstrated\ntruth. The modus tollens of reasoning from known inferences to the\nunknown proposition, is not only a rigorous, but a very easy mode of\nproof. For, if it can be shown that but one inference from a\nproposition is false, then the proposition must itself be false.\nInstead, then, of examining, in an ostensive argument, the whole series\nof the grounds on which the truth of a proposition rests, we need only\ntake the opposite of this proposition, and if one inference from it be\nfalse, then must the opposite be itself false; and, consequently, the\nproposition which we wished to prove must be true.\nThe apagogic method of proof is admissible only in those sciences where\nit is impossible to mistake a subjective representation for an\nobjective cognition. Where this is possible, it is plain that the\nopposite of a given proposition may contradict merely the subjective\nconditions of thought, and not the objective cognition; or it may\nhappen that both propositions contradict each other only under a\nsubjective condition, which is incorrectly considered to be objective,\nand, as the condition is itself false, both propositions may be false,\nand it will, consequently, be impossible to conclude the truth of the\none from the falseness of the other.\nIn mathematics such subreptions are impossible; and it is in this\nscience, accordingly, that the indirect mode of proof has its true\nplace. In the science of nature, where all assertion is based upon\nempirical intuition, such subreptions may be guarded against by the\nrepeated comparison of observations; but this mode of proof is of\nlittle value in this sphere of knowledge. But the transcendental\nefforts of pure reason are all made in the sphere of the subjective,\nwhich is the real medium of all dialectical illusion; and thus reason\nendeavours, in its premisses, to impose upon us subjective\nrepresentations for objective cognitions. In the transcendental sphere\nof pure reason, then, and in the case of synthetical propositions, it\nis inadmissible to support a statement by disproving the\ncounter-statement. For only two cases are possible; either, the\ncounter-statement is nothing but the enouncement of the inconsistency\nof the opposite opinion with the subjective conditions of reason, which\ndoes not affect the real case (for example, we cannot comprehend the\nunconditioned necessity of the existence of a being, and hence every\nspeculative proof of the existence of such a being must be opposed on\nsubjective grounds, while the possibility of this being in itself\ncannot with justice be denied); or, both propositions, being\ndialectical in their nature, are based upon an impossible conception.\nIn this latter case the rule applies: non entis nulla sunt predicata;\nthat is to say, what we affirm and what we deny, respecting such an\nobject, are equally untrue, and the apagogic mode of arriving at the\ntruth is in this case impossible. If, for example, we presuppose that\nthe world of sense is given in itself in its totality, it is false,\neither that it is infinite, or that it is finite and limited in space.\nBoth are false, because the hypothesis is false. For the notion of\nphenomena (as mere representations) which are given in themselves (as\nobjects) is self-contradictory; and the infinitude of this imaginary\nwhole would, indeed, be unconditioned, but would be inconsistent (as\neverything in the phenomenal world is conditioned) with the\nunconditioned determination and finitude of quantities which is\npresupposed in our conception.\nThe apagogic mode of proof is the true source of those illusions which\nhave always had so strong an attraction for the admirers of dogmatical\nphilosophy. It may be compared to a champion who maintains the honour\nand claims of the party he has adopted by offering battle to all who\ndoubt the validity of these claims and the purity of that honour; while\nnothing can be proved in this way, except the respective strength of\nthe combatants, and the advantage, in this respect, is always on the\nside of the attacking party. Spectators, observing that each party is\nalternately conqueror and conquered, are led to regard the subject of\ndispute as beyond the power of man to decide upon. But such an opinion\ncannot be justified; and it is sufficient to apply to these reasoners\nthe remark:\n_Non defensoribus istis\nTempus eget._\nEach must try to establish his assertions by a transcendental deduction\nof the grounds of proof employed in his argument, and thus enable us to\nsee in what way the claims of reason may be supported. If an opponent\nbases his assertions upon subjective grounds, he may be refuted with\nease; not, however to the advantage of the dogmatist, who likewise\ndepends upon subjective sources of cognition and is in like manner\ndriven into a corner by his opponent. But, if parties employ the direct\nmethod of procedure, they will soon discover the difficulty, nay, the\nimpossibility of proving their assertions, and will be forced to appeal\nto prescription and precedence; or they will, by the help of criticism,\ndiscover with ease the dogmatical illusions by which they had been\nmocked, and compel reason to renounce its exaggerated pretensions to\nspeculative insight and to confine itself within the limits of its\nproper sphere\u2014that of practical principles.\nChapter II. The Canon of Pure Reason\nIt is a humiliating consideration for human reason that it is\nincompetent to discover truth by means of pure speculation, but, on the\ncontrary, stands in need of discipline to check its deviations from the\nstraight path and to expose the illusions which it originates. But, on\nthe other hand, this consideration ought to elevate and to give it\nconfidence, for this discipline is exercised by itself alone, and it is\nsubject to the censure of no other power. The bounds, moreover, which\nit is forced to set to its speculative exercise, form likewise a check\nupon the fallacious pretensions of opponents; and thus what remains of\nits possessions, after these exaggerated claims have been disallowed,\nis secure from attack or usurpation. The greatest, and perhaps the\nonly, use of all philosophy of pure reason is, accordingly, of a purely\nnegative character. It is not an organon for the extension, but a\ndiscipline for the determination, of the limits of its exercise; and\nwithout laying claim to the discovery of new truth, it has the modest\nmerit of guarding against error.\nAt the same time, there must be some source of positive cognitions\nwhich belong to the domain of pure reason and which become the causes\nof error only from our mistaking their true character, while they form\nthe goal towards which reason continually strives. How else can we\naccount for the inextinguishable desire in the human mind to find a\nfirm footing in some region beyond the limits of the world of\nexperience? It hopes to attain to the possession of a knowledge in\nwhich it has the deepest interest. It enters upon the path of pure\nspeculation; but in vain. We have some reason, however, to expect that,\nin the only other way that lies open to it\u2014the path of practical\nreason\u2014it may meet with better success.\nI understand by a canon a list of the \u00e0 priori principles of the proper\nemployment of certain faculties of cognition. Thus general logic, in\nits analytical department, is a formal canon for the faculties of\nunderstanding and reason. In the same way, Transcendental Analytic was\nseen to be a canon of the pure understanding; for it alone is competent\nto enounce true \u00e0 priori synthetical cognitions. But, when no proper\nemployment of a faculty of cognition is possible, no canon can exist.\nBut the synthetical cognition of pure speculative reason is, as has\nbeen shown, completely impossible. There cannot, therefore, exist any\ncanon for the speculative exercise of this faculty\u2014for its speculative\nexercise is entirely dialectical; and, consequently, transcendental\nlogic, in this respect, is merely a discipline, and not a canon. If,\nthen, there is any proper mode of employing the faculty of pure\nreason\u2014in which case there must be a canon for this faculty\u2014this canon\nwill relate, not to the speculative, but to the practical use of\nreason. This canon we now proceed to investigate.\nSection I. Of the Ultimate End of the Pure Use of Reason\nThere exists in the faculty of reason a natural desire to venture\nbeyond the field of experience, to attempt to reach the utmost bounds\nof all cognition by the help of ideas alone, and not to rest satisfied\nuntil it has fulfilled its course and raised the sum of its cognitions\ninto a self-subsistent systematic whole. Is the motive for this\nendeavour to be found in its speculative, or in its practical interests\nalone?\nSetting aside, at present, the results of the labours of pure reason in\nits speculative exercise, I shall merely inquire regarding the problems\nthe solution of which forms its ultimate aim, whether reached or not,\nand in relation to which all other aims are but partial and\nintermediate. These highest aims must, from the nature of reason,\npossess complete unity; otherwise the highest interest of humanity\ncould not be successfully promoted.\nThe transcendental speculation of reason relates to three things: the\nfreedom of the will, the immortality of the soul, and the existence of\nGod. The speculative interest which reason has in those questions is\nvery small; and, for its sake alone, we should not undertake the labour\nof transcendental investigation\u2014a labour full of toil and ceaseless\nstruggle. We should be loth to undertake this labour, because the\ndiscoveries we might make would not be of the smallest use in the\nsphere of concrete or physical investigation. We may find out that the\nwill is free, but this knowledge only relates to the intelligible cause\nof our volition. As regards the phenomena or expressions of this will,\nthat is, our actions, we are bound, in obedience to an inviolable\nmaxim, without which reason cannot be employed in the sphere of\nexperience, to explain these in the same way as we explain all the\nother phenomena of nature, that is to say, according to its\nunchangeable laws. We may have discovered the spirituality and\nimmortality of the soul, but we cannot employ this knowledge to explain\nthe phenomena of this life, nor the peculiar nature of the future,\nbecause our conception of an incorporeal nature is purely negative and\ndoes not add anything to our knowledge, and the only inferences to be\ndrawn from it are purely fictitious. If, again, we prove the existence\nof a supreme intelligence, we should be able from it to make the\nconformity to aims existing in the arrangement of the world\ncomprehensible; but we should not be justified in deducing from it any\nparticular arrangement or disposition, or inferring any where it is not\nperceived. For it is a necessary rule of the speculative use of reason\nthat we must not overlook natural causes, or refuse to listen to the\nteaching of experience, for the sake of deducing what we know and\nperceive from something that transcends all our knowledge. In one word,\nthese three propositions are, for the speculative reason, always\ntranscendent, and cannot be employed as immanent principles in relation\nto the objects of experience; they are, consequently, of no use to us\nin this sphere, being but the valueless results of the severe but\nunprofitable efforts of reason.\nIf, then, the actual cognition of these three cardinal propositions is\nperfectly useless, while Reason uses her utmost endeavours to induce us\nto admit them, it is plain that their real value and importance relate\nto our practical, and not to our speculative interest.\nI term all that is possible through free will, practical. But if the\nconditions of the exercise of free volition are empirical, reason can\nhave only a regulative, and not a constitutive, influence upon it, and\nis serviceable merely for the introduction of unity into its empirical\nlaws. In the moral philosophy of prudence, for example, the sole\nbusiness of reason is to bring about a union of all the ends, which are\naimed at by our inclinations, into one ultimate end\u2014that of\nhappiness\u2014and to show the agreement which should exist among the means\nof attaining that end. In this sphere, accordingly, reason cannot\npresent to us any other than pragmatical laws of free action, for our\nguidance towards the aims set up by the senses, and is incompetent to\ngive us laws which are pure and determined completely \u00e0 priori. On the\nother hand, pure practical laws, the ends of which have been given by\nreason entirely \u00e0 priori, and which are not empirically conditioned,\nbut are, on the contrary, absolutely imperative in their nature, would\nbe products of pure reason. Such are the moral laws; and these alone\nbelong to the sphere of the practical exercise of reason, and admit of\na canon.\nAll the powers of reason, in the sphere of what may be termed pure\nphilosophy, are, in fact, directed to the three above-mentioned\nproblems alone. These again have a still higher end\u2014the answer to the\nquestion, what we ought to do, if the will is free, if there is a God\nand a future world. Now, as this problem relates to our in reference to\nthe highest aim of humanity, it is evident that the ultimate intention\nof nature, in the constitution of our reason, has been directed to the\nmoral alone.\nWe must take care, however, in turning our attention to an object which\nis foreign[78] to the sphere of transcendental philosophy, not to\ninjure the unity of our system by digressions, nor, on the other hand,\nto fail in clearness, by saying too little on the new subject of\ndiscussion. I hope to avoid both extremes, by keeping as close as\npossible to the transcendental, and excluding all psychological, that\nis, empirical, elements.\n[78] All practical conceptions relate to objects of pleasure and pain,\nand consequently\u2014in an indirect manner, at least\u2014to objects of\nfeeling. But as feeling is not a faculty of representation, but lies\nout of the sphere of our powers of cognition, the elements of our\njudgements, in so far as they relate to pleasure or pain, that is, the\nelements of our practical judgements, do not belong to transcendental\nphilosophy, which has to do with pure \u00e0 priori cognitions alone.\nI have to remark, in the first place, that at present I treat of the\nconception of freedom in the practical sense only, and set aside the\ncorresponding transcendental conception, which cannot be employed as a\nground of explanation in the phenomenal world, but is itself a problem\nfor pure reason. A will is purely animal (arbitrium brutum) when it is\ndetermined by sensuous impulses or instincts only, that is, when it is\ndetermined in a pathological manner. A will, which can be determined\nindependently of sensuous impulses, consequently by motives presented\nby reason alone, is called a free will (arbitrium liberum); and\neverything which is connected with this free will, either as principle\nor consequence, is termed practical. The existence of practical freedom\ncan be proved from experience alone. For the human will is not\ndetermined by that alone which immediately affects the senses; on the\ncontrary, we have the power, by calling up the notion of what is useful\nor hurtful in a more distant relation, of overcoming the immediate\nimpressions on our sensuous faculty of desire. But these considerations\nof what is desirable in relation to our whole state, that is, is in the\nend good and useful, are based entirely upon reason. This faculty,\naccordingly, enounces laws, which are imperative or objective laws of\nfreedom and which tell us what ought to take place, thus distinguishing\nthemselves from the laws of nature, which relate to that which does\ntake place. The laws of freedom or of free will are hence termed\npractical laws.\nWhether reason is not itself, in the actual delivery of these laws,\ndetermined in its turn by other influences, and whether the action\nwhich, in relation to sensuous impulses, we call free, may not, in\nrelation to higher and more remote operative causes, really form a part\nof nature\u2014these are questions which do not here concern us. They are\npurely speculative questions; and all we have to do, in the practical\nsphere, is to inquire into the rule of conduct which reason has to\npresent. Experience demonstrates to us the existence of practical\nfreedom as one of the causes which exist in nature, that is, it shows\nthe causal power of reason in the determination of the will. The idea\nof transcendental freedom, on the contrary, requires that reason\u2014in\nrelation to its causal power of commencing a series of phenomena\u2014should\nbe independent of all sensuous determining causes; and thus it seems to\nbe in opposition to the law of nature and to all possible experience.\nIt therefore remains a problem for the human mind. But this problem\ndoes not concern reason in its practical use; and we have, therefore,\nin a canon of pure reason, to do with only two questions, which relate\nto the practical interest of pure reason: Is there a God? and, Is there\na future life? The question of transcendental freedom is purely\nspeculative, and we may therefore set it entirely aside when we come to\ntreat of practical reason. Besides, we have already discussed this\nsubject in the antinomy of pure reason.\nSection II. Of the Ideal of the Summum Bonum as a Determining Ground of\nthe Ultimate End of Pure Reason\nReason conducted us, in its speculative use, through the field of\nexperience and, as it can never find complete satisfaction in that\nsphere, from thence to speculative ideas\u2014which, however, in the end\nbrought us back again to experience, and thus fulfilled the purpose of\nreason, in a manner which, though useful, was not at all in accordance\nwith our expectations. It now remains for us to consider whether pure\nreason can be employed in a practical sphere, and whether it will here\nconduct us to those ideas which attain the highest ends of pure reason,\nas we have just stated them. We shall thus ascertain whether, from the\npoint of view of its practical interest, reason may not be able to\nsupply us with that which, on the speculative side, it wholly denies\nus.\nThe whole interest of reason, speculative as well as practical, is\ncentred in the three following questions:\n1. WHAT CAN I KNOW?\n2. WHAT OUGHT I TO DO?\n3. WHAT MAY I HOPE?\nThe first question is purely speculative. We have, as I flatter myself,\nexhausted all the replies of which it is susceptible, and have at last\nfound the reply with which reason must content itself, and with which\nit ought to be content, so long as it pays no regard to the practical.\nBut from the two great ends to the attainment of which all these\nefforts of pure reason were in fact directed, we remain just as far\nremoved as if we had consulted our ease and declined the task at the\noutset. So far, then, as knowledge is concerned, thus much, at least,\nis established, that, in regard to those two problems, it lies beyond\nour reach.\nThe second question is purely practical. As such it may indeed fall\nwithin the province of pure reason, but still it is not transcendental,\nbut moral, and consequently cannot in itself form the subject of our\ncriticism.\nThe third question: If I act as I ought to do, what may I then hope?\u2014is\nat once practical and theoretical. The practical forms a clue to the\nanswer of the theoretical, and\u2014in its highest form\u2014speculative\nquestion. For all hoping has happiness for its object and stands in\nprecisely the same relation to the practical and the law of morality as\nknowing to the theoretical cognition of things and the law of nature.\nThe former arrives finally at the conclusion that something is (which\ndetermines the ultimate end), because something ought to take place;\nthe latter, that something is (which operates as the highest cause),\nbecause something does take place.\nHappiness is the satisfaction of all our desires; extensive, in regard\nto their multiplicity; intensive, in regard to their degree; and\nprotensive, in regard to their duration. The practical law based on the\nmotive of happiness I term a pragmatical law (or prudential rule); but\nthat law, assuming such to exist, which has no other motive than the\nworthiness of being happy, I term a moral or ethical law. The first\ntells us what we have to do, if we wish to become possessed of\nhappiness; the second dictates how we ought to act, in order to deserve\nhappiness. The first is based upon empirical principles; for it is only\nby experience that I can learn either what inclinations exist which\ndesire satisfaction, or what are the natural means of satisfying them.\nThe second takes no account of our desires or the means of satisfying\nthem, and regards only the freedom of a rational being, and the\nnecessary conditions under which alone this freedom can harmonize with\nthe distribution of happiness according to principles. This second law\nmay therefore rest upon mere ideas of pure reason, and may be cognized\n\u00e0 priori.\nI assume that there are pure moral laws which determine, entirely \u00e0\npriori (without regard to empirical motives, that is, to happiness),\nthe conduct of a rational being, or in other words, to use which it\nmakes of its freedom, and that these laws are absolutely imperative\n(not merely hypothetically, on the supposition of other empirical\nends), and therefore in all respects necessary. I am warranted in\nassuming this, not only by the arguments of the most enlightened\nmoralists, but by the moral judgement of every man who will make the\nattempt to form a distinct conception of such a law.\nPure reason, then, contains, not indeed in its speculative, but in its\npractical, or, more strictly, its moral use, principles of the\npossibility of experience, of such actions, namely, as, in accordance\nwith ethical precepts, might be met with in the history of man. For\nsince reason commands that such actions should take place, it must be\npossible for them to take place; and hence a particular kind of\nsystematic unity\u2014the moral\u2014must be possible. We have found, it is true,\nthat the systematic unity of nature could not be established according\nto speculative principles of reason, because, while reason possesses a\ncausal power in relation to freedom, it has none in relation to the\nwhole sphere of nature; and, while moral principles of reason can\nproduce free actions, they cannot produce natural laws. It is, then, in\nits practical, but especially in its moral use, that the principles of\npure reason possess objective reality.\nI call the world a moral world, in so far as it may be in accordance\nwith all the ethical laws\u2014which, by virtue of the freedom of reasonable\nbeings, it can be, and according to the necessary laws of morality it\nought to be. But this world must be conceived only as an intelligible\nworld, inasmuch as abstraction is therein made of all conditions\n(ends), and even of all impediments to morality (the weakness or\npravity of human nature). So far, then, it is a mere idea\u2014though still\na practical idea\u2014which may have, and ought to have, an influence on the\nworld of sense, so as to bring it as far as possible into conformity\nwith itself. The idea of a moral world has, therefore, objective\nreality, not as referring to an object of intelligible intuition\u2014for of\nsuch an object we can form no conception whatever\u2014but to the world of\nsense\u2014conceived, however, as an object of pure reason in its practical\nuse\u2014and to a corpus mysticum of rational beings in it, in so far as the\nliberum arbitrium of the individual is placed, under and by virtue of\nmoral laws, in complete systematic unity both with itself and with the\nfreedom of all others.\nThat is the answer to the first of the two questions of pure reason\nwhich relate to its practical interest: Do that which will render thee\nworthy of happiness. The second question is this: If I conduct myself\nso as not to be unworthy of happiness, may I hope thereby to obtain\nhappiness? In order to arrive at the solution of this question, we must\ninquire whether the principles of pure reason, which prescribe \u00e0 priori\nthe law, necessarily also connect this hope with it.\nI say, then, that just as the moral principles are necessary according\nto reason in its practical use, so it is equally necessary according to\nreason in its theoretical use to assume that every one has ground to\nhope for happiness in the measure in which he has made himself worthy\nof it in his conduct, and that therefore the system of morality is\ninseparably (though only in the idea of pure reason) connected with\nthat of happiness.\nNow in an intelligible, that is, in the moral world, in the conception\nof which we make abstraction of all the impediments to morality\n(sensuous desires), such a system of happiness, connected with and\nproportioned to morality, may be conceived as necessary, because\nfreedom of volition\u2014partly incited, and partly restrained by moral\nlaws\u2014would be itself the cause of general happiness; and thus rational\nbeings, under the guidance of such principles, would be themselves the\nauthors both of their own enduring welfare and that of others. But such\na system of self-rewarding morality is only an idea, the carrying out\nof which depends upon the condition that every one acts as he ought; in\nother words, that all actions of reasonable beings be such as they\nwould be if they sprung from a Supreme Will, comprehending in, or\nunder, itself all particular wills. But since the moral law is binding\non each individual in the use of his freedom of volition, even if\nothers should not act in conformity with this law, neither the nature\nof things, nor the causality of actions and their relation to morality,\ndetermine how the consequences of these actions will be related to\nhappiness; and the necessary connection of the hope of happiness with\nthe unceasing endeavour to become worthy of happiness, cannot be\ncognized by reason, if we take nature alone for our guide. This\nconnection can be hoped for only on the assumption that the cause of\nnature is a supreme reason, which governs according to moral laws.\nI term the idea of an intelligence in which the morally most perfect\nwill, united with supreme blessedness, is the cause of all happiness in\nthe world, so far as happiness stands in strict relation to morality\n(as the worthiness of being happy), the ideal of the supreme Good. It\nis only, then, in the ideal of the supreme original good, that pure\nreason can find the ground of the practically necessary connection of\nboth elements of the highest derivative good, and accordingly of an\nintelligible, that is, moral world. Now since we are necessitated by\nreason to conceive ourselves as belonging to such a world, while the\nsenses present to us nothing but a world of phenomena, we must assume\nthe former as a consequence of our conduct in the world of sense (since\nthe world of sense gives us no hint of it), and therefore as future in\nrelation to us. Thus God and a future life are two hypotheses which,\naccording to the principles of pure reason, are inseparable from the\nobligation which this reason imposes upon us.\nMorality per se constitutes a system. But we can form no system of\nhappiness, except in so far as it is dispensed in strict proportion to\nmorality. But this is only possible in the intelligible world, under a\nwise author and ruler. Such a ruler, together with life in such a\nworld, which we must look upon as future, reason finds itself compelled\nto assume; or it must regard the moral laws as idle dreams, since the\nnecessary consequence which this same reason connects with them must,\nwithout this hypothesis, fall to the ground. Hence also the moral laws\nare universally regarded as commands, which they could not be did they\nnot connect \u00e0 priori adequate consequences with their dictates, and\nthus carry with them promises and threats. But this, again, they could\nnot do, did they not reside in a necessary being, as the Supreme Good,\nwhich alone can render such a teleological unity possible.\nLeibnitz termed the world, when viewed in relation to the rational\nbeings which it contains, and the moral relations in which they stand\nto each other, under the government of the Supreme Good, the kingdom of\nGrace, and distinguished it from the kingdom of Nature, in which these\nrational beings live, under moral laws, indeed, but expect no other\nconsequences from their actions than such as follow according to the\ncourse of nature in the world of sense. To view ourselves, therefore,\nas in the kingdom of grace, in which all happiness awaits us, except in\nso far as we ourselves limit our participation in it by actions which\nrender us unworthy of happiness, is a practically necessary idea of\nreason.\nPractical laws, in so far as they are subjective grounds of actions,\nthat is, subjective principles, are termed maxims. The judgements of\nmoral according to in its purity and ultimate results are framed\naccording ideas; the observance of its laws, according to maxims.\nThe whole course of our life must be subject to moral maxims; but this\nis impossible, unless with the moral law, which is a mere idea, reason\nconnects an efficient cause which ordains to all conduct which is in\nconformity with the moral law an issue either in this or in another\nlife, which is in exact conformity with our highest aims. Thus, without\na God and without a world, invisible to us now, but hoped for, the\nglorious ideas of morality are, indeed, objects of approbation and of\nadmiration, but cannot be the springs of purpose and action. For they\ndo not satisfy all the aims which are natural to every rational being,\nand which are determined \u00e0 priori by pure reason itself, and necessary.\nHappiness alone is, in the view of reason, far from being the complete\ngood. Reason does not approve of it (however much inclination may\ndesire it), except as united with desert. On the other hand, morality\nalone, and with it, mere desert, is likewise far from being the\ncomplete good. To make it complete, he who conducts himself in a manner\nnot unworthy of happiness, must be able to hope for the possession of\nhappiness. Even reason, unbiased by private ends, or interested\nconsiderations, cannot judge otherwise, if it puts itself in the place\nof a being whose business it is to dispense all happiness to others.\nFor in the practical idea both points are essentially combined, though\nin such a way that participation in happiness is rendered possible by\nthe moral disposition, as its condition, and not conversely, the moral\ndisposition by the prospect of happiness. For a disposition which\nshould require the prospect of happiness as its necessary condition\nwould not be moral, and hence also would not be worthy of complete\nhappiness\u2014a happiness which, in the view of reason, recognizes no\nlimitation but such as arises from our own immoral conduct.\nHappiness, therefore, in exact proportion with the morality of rational\nbeings (whereby they are made worthy of happiness), constitutes alone\nthe supreme good of a world into which we absolutely must transport\nourselves according to the commands of pure but practical reason. This\nworld is, it is true, only an intelligible world; for of such a\nsystematic unity of ends as it requires, the world of sense gives us no\nhint. Its reality can be based on nothing else but the hypothesis of a\nsupreme original good. In it independent reason, equipped with all the\nsufficiency of a supreme cause, founds, maintains, and fulfils the\nuniversal order of things, with the most perfect teleological harmony,\nhowever much this order may be hidden from us in the world of sense.\nThis moral theology has the peculiar advantage, in contrast with\nspeculative theology, of leading inevitably to the conception of a\nsole, perfect, and rational First Cause, whereof speculative theology\ndoes not give us any indication on objective grounds, far less any\nconvincing evidence. For we find neither in transcendental nor in\nnatural theology, however far reason may lead us in these, any ground\nto warrant us in assuming the existence of one only Being, which stands\nat the head of all natural causes, and on which these are entirely\ndependent. On the other hand, if we take our stand on moral unity as a\nnecessary law of the universe, and from this point of view consider\nwhat is necessary to give this law adequate efficiency and, for us,\nobligatory force, we must come to the conclusion that there is one only\nsupreme will, which comprehends all these laws in itself. For how,\nunder different wills, should we find complete unity of ends? This will\nmust be omnipotent, that all nature and its relation to morality in the\nworld may be subject to it; omniscient, that it may have knowledge of\nthe most secret feelings and their moral worth; omnipresent, that it\nmay be at hand to supply every necessity to which the highest weal of\nthe world may give rise; eternal, that this harmony of nature and\nliberty may never fail; and so on.\nBut this systematic unity of ends in this world of intelligences\u2014which,\nas mere nature, is only a world of sense, but, as a system of freedom\nof volition, may be termed an intelligible, that is, moral world\n(regnum gratiae)\u2014leads inevitably also to the teleological unity of all\nthings which constitute this great whole, according to universal\nnatural laws\u2014just as the unity of the former is according to universal\nand necessary moral laws\u2014and unites the practical with the speculative\nreason. The world must be represented as having originated from an\nidea, if it is to harmonize with that use of reason without which we\ncannot even consider ourselves as worthy of reason\u2014namely, the moral\nuse, which rests entirely on the idea of the supreme good. Hence the\ninvestigation of nature receives a teleological direction, and becomes,\nin its widest extension, physico-theology. But this, taking its rise in\nmoral order as a unity founded on the essence of freedom, and not\naccidentally instituted by external commands, establishes the\nteleological view of nature on grounds which must be inseparably\nconnected with the internal possibility of things. This gives rise to a\ntranscendental theology, which takes the ideal of the highest\nontological perfection as a principle of systematic unity; and this\nprinciple connects all things according to universal and necessary\nnatural laws, because all things have their origin in the absolute\nnecessity of the one only Primal Being.\nWhat use can we make of our understanding, even in respect of\nexperience, if we do not propose ends to ourselves? But the highest\nends are those of morality, and it is only pure reason that can give us\nthe knowledge of these. Though supplied with these, and putting\nourselves under their guidance, we can make no teleological use of the\nknowledge of nature, as regards cognition, unless nature itself has\nestablished teleological unity. For without this unity we should not\neven possess reason, because we should have no school for reason, and\nno cultivation through objects which afford the materials for its\nconceptions. But teleological unity is a necessary unity, and founded\non the essence of the individual will itself. Hence this will, which is\nthe condition of the application of this unity in concreto, must be so\nlikewise. In this way the transcendental enlargement of our rational\ncognition would be, not the cause, but merely the effect of the\npractical teleology which pure reason imposes upon us.\nHence, also, we find in the history of human reason that, before the\nmoral conceptions were sufficiently purified and determined, and before\nmen had attained to a perception of the systematic unity of ends\naccording to these conceptions and from necessary principles, the\nknowledge of nature, and even a considerable amount of intellectual\nculture in many other sciences, could produce only rude and vague\nconceptions of the Deity, sometimes even admitting of an astonishing\nindifference with regard to this question altogether. But the more\nenlarged treatment of moral ideas, which was rendered necessary by the\nextreme pure moral law of our religion, awakened the interest, and\nthereby quickened the perceptions of reason in relation to this object.\nIn this way, and without the help either of an extended acquaintance\nwith nature, or of a reliable transcendental insight (for these have\nbeen wanting in all ages), a conception of the Divine Being was arrived\nat, which we now hold to be the correct one, not because speculative\nreason convinces us of its correctness, but because it accords with the\nmoral principles of reason. Thus it is to pure reason, but only in its\npractical use, that we must ascribe the merit of having connected with\nour highest interest a cognition, of which mere speculation was able\nonly to form a conjecture, but the validity of which it was unable to\nestablish\u2014and of having thereby rendered it, not indeed a demonstrated\ndogma, but a hypothesis absolutely necessary to the essential ends of\nreason.\nBut if practical reason has reached this elevation, and has attained to\nthe conception of a sole Primal Being as the supreme good, it must not,\ntherefore, imagine that it has transcended the empirical conditions of\nits application, and risen to the immediate cognition of new objects;\nit must not presume to start from the conception which it has gained,\nand to deduce from it the moral laws themselves. For it was these very\nlaws, the internal practical necessity of which led us to the\nhypothesis of an independent cause, or of a wise ruler of the universe,\nwho should give them effect. Hence we are not entitled to regard them\nas accidental and derived from the mere will of the ruler, especially\nas we have no conception of such a will, except as formed in accordance\nwith these laws. So far, then, as practical reason has the right to\nconduct us, we shall not look upon actions as binding on us, because\nthey are the commands of God, but we shall regard them as divine\ncommands, because we are internally bound by them. We shall study\nfreedom under the teleological unity which accords with principles of\nreason; we shall look upon ourselves as acting in conformity with the\ndivine will only in so far as we hold sacred the moral law which reason\nteaches us from the nature of actions themselves, and we shall believe\nthat we can obey that will only by promoting the weal of the universe\nin ourselves and in others. Moral theology is, therefore, only of\nimmanent use. It teaches us to fulfil our destiny here in the world, by\nplacing ourselves in harmony with the general system of ends, and warns\nus against the fanaticism, nay, the crime of depriving reason of its\nlegislative authority in the moral conduct of life, for the purpose of\ndirectly connecting this authority with the idea of the Supreme Being.\nFor this would be, not an immanent, but a transcendent use of moral\ntheology, and, like the transcendent use of mere speculation, would\ninevitably pervert and frustrate the ultimate ends of reason.\nSection III. Of Opinion, Knowledge, and Belief\nThe holding of a thing to be true is a phenomenon in our understanding\nwhich may rest on objective grounds, but requires, also, subjective\ncauses in the mind of the person judging. If a judgement is valid for\nevery rational being, then its ground is objectively sufficient, and it\nis termed a conviction. If, on the other hand, it has its ground in the\nparticular character of the subject, it is termed a persuasion.\nPersuasion is a mere illusion, the ground of the judgement, which lies\nsolely in the subject, being regarded as objective. Hence a judgement\nof this kind has only private validity\u2014is only valid for the individual\nwho judges, and the holding of a thing to be true in this way cannot be\ncommunicated. But truth depends upon agreement with the object, and\nconsequently the judgements of all understandings, if true, must be in\nagreement with each other (consentientia uni tertio consentiunt inter\nse). Conviction may, therefore, be distinguished, from an external\npoint of view, from persuasion, by the possibility of communicating it\nand by showing its validity for the reason of every man; for in this\ncase the presumption, at least, arises that the agreement of all\njudgements with each other, in spite of the different characters of\nindividuals, rests upon the common ground of the agreement of each with\nthe object, and thus the correctness of the judgement is established.\nPersuasion, accordingly, cannot be subjectively distinguished from\nconviction, that is, so long as the subject views its judgement simply\nas a phenomenon of its own mind. But if we inquire whether the grounds\nof our judgement, which are valid for us, produce the same effect on\nthe reason of others as on our own, we have then the means, though only\nsubjective means, not, indeed, of producing conviction, but of\ndetecting the merely private validity of the judgement; in other words,\nof discovering that there is in it the element of mere persuasion.\nIf we can, in addition to this, develop the subjective causes of the\njudgement, which we have taken for its objective grounds, and thus\nexplain the deceptive judgement as a phenomenon in our mind, apart\naltogether from the objective character of the object, we can then\nexpose the illusion and need be no longer deceived by it, although, if\nits subjective cause lies in our nature, we cannot hope altogether to\nescape its influence.\nI can only maintain, that is, affirm as necessarily valid for every\none, that which produces conviction. Persuasion I may keep for myself,\nif it is agreeable to me; but I cannot, and ought not, to attempt to\nimpose it as binding upon others.\nHolding for true, or the subjective validity of a judgement in relation\nto conviction (which is, at the same time, objectively valid), has the\nthree following degrees: opinion, belief, and knowledge. Opinion is a\nconsciously insufficient judgement, subjectively as well as\nobjectively. Belief is subjectively sufficient, but is recognized as\nbeing objectively insufficient. Knowledge is both subjectively and\nobjectively sufficient. Subjective sufficiency is termed conviction\n(for myself); objective sufficiency is termed certainty (for all). I\nneed not dwell longer on the explanation of such simple conceptions.\nI must never venture to be of opinion, without knowing something, at\nleast, by which my judgement, in itself merely problematical, is\nbrought into connection with the truth\u2014which connection, although not\nperfect, is still something more than an arbitrary fiction. Moreover,\nthe law of such a connection must be certain. For if, in relation to\nthis law, I have nothing more than opinion, my judgement is but a play\nof the imagination, without the least relation to truth. In the\njudgements of pure reason, opinion has no place. For, as they do not\nrest on empirical grounds and as the sphere of pure reason is that of\nnecessary truth and \u00e0 priori cognition, the principle of connection in\nit requires universality and necessity, and consequently perfect\ncertainty\u2014otherwise we should have no guide to the truth at all. Hence\nit is absurd to have an opinion in pure mathematics; we must know, or\nabstain from forming a judgement altogether. The case is the same with\nthe maxims of morality. For we must not hazard an action on the mere\nopinion that it is allowed, but we must know it to be so. In the\ntranscendental sphere of reason, on the other hand, the term opinion is\ntoo weak, while the word knowledge is too strong. From the merely\nspeculative point of view, therefore, we cannot form a judgement at\nall. For the subjective grounds of a judgement, such as produce belief,\ncannot be admitted in speculative inquiries, inasmuch as they cannot\nstand without empirical support and are incapable of being communicated\nto others in equal measure.\nBut it is only from the practical point of view that a theoretically\ninsufficient judgement can be termed belief. Now the practical\nreference is either to skill or to morality; to the former, when the\nend proposed is arbitrary and accidental, to the latter, when it is\nabsolutely necessary.\nIf we propose to ourselves any end whatever, the conditions of its\nattainment are hypothetically necessary. The necessity is subjectively,\nbut still only comparatively, sufficient, if I am acquainted with no\nother conditions under which the end can be attained. On the other\nhand, it is sufficient, absolutely and for every one, if I know for\ncertain that no one can be acquainted with any other conditions under\nwhich the attainment of the proposed end would be possible. In the\nformer case my supposition\u2014my judgement with regard to certain\nconditions\u2014is a merely accidental belief; in the latter it is a\nnecessary belief. The physician must pursue some course in the case of\na patient who is in danger, but is ignorant of the nature of the\ndisease. He observes the symptoms, and concludes, according to the best\nof his judgement, that it is a case of phthisis. His belief is, even in\nhis own judgement, only contingent: another man might, perhaps come\nnearer the truth. Such a belief, contingent indeed, but still forming\nthe ground of the actual use of means for the attainment of certain\nends, I term Pragmatical belief.\nThe usual test, whether that which any one maintains is merely his\npersuasion, or his subjective conviction at least, that is, his firm\nbelief, is a bet. It frequently happens that a man delivers his\nopinions with so much boldness and assurance, that he appears to be\nunder no apprehension as to the possibility of his being in error. The\noffer of a bet startles him, and makes him pause. Sometimes it turns\nout that his persuasion may be valued at a ducat, but not at ten. For\nhe does not hesitate, perhaps, to venture a ducat, but if it is\nproposed to stake ten, he immediately becomes aware of the possibility\nof his being mistaken\u2014a possibility which has hitherto escaped his\nobservation. If we imagine to ourselves that we have to stake the\nhappiness of our whole life on the truth of any proposition, our\njudgement drops its air of triumph, we take the alarm, and discover the\nactual strength of our belief. Thus pragmatical belief has degrees,\nvarying in proportion to the interests at stake.\nNow, in cases where we cannot enter upon any course of action in\nreference to some object, and where, accordingly, our judgement is\npurely theoretical, we can still represent to ourselves, in thought,\nthe possibility of a course of action, for which we suppose that we\nhave sufficient grounds, if any means existed of ascertaining the truth\nof the matter. Thus we find in purely theoretical judgements an\nanalogon of practical judgements, to which the word belief may properly\nbe applied, and which we may term doctrinal belief. I should not\nhesitate to stake my all on the truth of the proposition\u2014if there were\nany possibility of bringing it to the test of experience\u2014that, at\nleast, some one of the planets, which we see, is inhabited. Hence I say\nthat I have not merely the opinion, but the strong belief, on the\ncorrectness of which I would stake even many of the advantages of life,\nthat there are inhabitants in other worlds.\nNow we must admit that the doctrine of the existence of God belongs to\ndoctrinal belief. For, although in respect to the theoretical cognition\nof the universe I do not require to form any theory which necessarily\ninvolves this idea, as the condition of my explanation of the phenomena\nwhich the universe presents, but, on the contrary, am rather bound so\nto use my reason as if everything were mere nature, still teleological\nunity is so important a condition of the application of my reason to\nnature, that it is impossible for me to ignore it\u2014especially since, in\naddition to these considerations, abundant examples of it are supplied\nby experience. But the sole condition, so far as my knowledge extends,\nunder which this unity can be my guide in the investigation of nature,\nis the assumption that a supreme intelligence has ordered all things\naccording to the wisest ends. Consequently, the hypothesis of a wise\nauthor of the universe is necessary for my guidance in the\ninvestigation of nature\u2014is the condition under which alone I can fulfil\nan end which is contingent indeed, but by no means unimportant.\nMoreover, since the result of my attempts so frequently confirms the\nutility of this assumption, and since nothing decisive can be adduced\nagainst it, it follows that it would be saying far too little to term\nmy judgement, in this case, a mere opinion, and that, even in this\ntheoretical connection, I may assert that I firmly believe in God.\nStill, if we use words strictly, this must not be called a practical,\nbut a doctrinal belief, which the theology of nature (physico-theology)\nmust also produce in my mind. In the wisdom of a Supreme Being, and in\nthe shortness of life, so inadequate to the development of the glorious\npowers of human nature, we may find equally sufficient grounds for a\ndoctrinal belief in the future life of the human soul.\nThe expression of belief is, in such cases, an expression of modesty\nfrom the objective point of view, but, at the same time, of firm\nconfidence, from the subjective. If I should venture to term this\nmerely theoretical judgement even so much as a hypothesis which I am\nentitled to assume; a more complete conception, with regard to another\nworld and to the cause of the world, might then be justly required of\nme than I am, in reality, able to give. For, if I assume anything, even\nas a mere hypothesis, I must, at least, know so much of the properties\nof such a being as will enable me, not to form the conception, but to\nimagine the existence of it. But the word belief refers only to the\nguidance which an idea gives me, and to its subjective influence on the\nconduct of my reason, which forces me to hold it fast, though I may not\nbe in a position to give a speculative account of it.\nBut mere doctrinal belief is, to some extent, wanting in stability. We\noften quit our hold of it, in consequence of the difficulties which\noccur in speculation, though in the end we inevitably return to it\nagain.\nIt is quite otherwise with moral belief. For in this sphere action is\nabsolutely necessary, that is, I must act in obedience to the moral law\nin all points. The end is here incontrovertibly established, and there\nis only one condition possible, according to the best of my perception,\nunder which this end can harmonize with all other ends, and so have\npractical validity\u2014namely, the existence of a God and of a future\nworld. I know also, to a certainty, that no one can be acquainted with\nany other conditions which conduct to the same unity of ends under the\nmoral law. But since the moral precept is, at the same time, my maxim\n(as reason requires that it should be), I am irresistibly constrained\nto believe in the existence of God and in a future life; and I am sure\nthat nothing can make me waver in this belief, since I should thereby\noverthrow my moral maxims, the renunciation of which would render me\nhateful in my own eyes.\nThus, while all the ambitious attempts of reason to penetrate beyond\nthe limits of experience end in disappointment, there is still enough\nleft to satisfy us in a practical point of view. No one, it is true,\nwill be able to boast that he knows that there is a God and a future\nlife; for, if he knows this, he is just the man whom I have long wished\nto find. All knowledge, regarding an object of mere reason, can be\ncommunicated; and I should thus be enabled to hope that my own\nknowledge would receive this wonderful extension, through the\ninstrumentality of his instruction. No, my conviction is not logical,\nbut moral certainty; and since it rests on subjective grounds (of the\nmoral sentiment), I must not even say: It is morally certain that there\nis a God, etc., but: I am morally certain, that is, my belief in God\nand in another world is so interwoven with my moral nature that I am\nunder as little apprehension of having the former torn from me as of\nlosing the latter.\nThe only point in this argument that may appear open to suspicion is\nthat this rational belief presupposes the existence of moral\nsentiments. If we give up this assumption, and take a man who is\nentirely indifferent with regard to moral laws, the question which\nreason proposes, becomes then merely a problem for speculation and may,\nindeed, be supported by strong grounds from analogy, but not by such as\nwill compel the most obstinate scepticism to give way.[79] But in these\nquestions no man is free from all interest. For though the want of good\nsentiments may place him beyond the influence of moral interests, still\neven in this case enough may be left to make him fear the existence of\nGod and a future life. For he cannot pretend to any certainty of the\nnon-existence of God and of a future life, unless\u2014since it could only\nbe proved by mere reason, and therefore apodeictically\u2014he is prepared\nto establish the impossibility of both, which certainly no reasonable\nman would undertake to do. This would be a negative belief, which could\nnot, indeed, produce morality and good sentiments, but still could\nproduce an analogon of these, by operating as a powerful restraint on\nthe outbreak of evil dispositions.\n[79] The human mind (as, I believe, every rational being must of\nnecessity do) takes a natural interest in morality, although this\ninterest is not undivided, and may not be practically in\npreponderance. If you strengthen and increase it, you will find the\nreason become docile, more enlightened, and more capable of uniting\nthe speculative interest with the practical. But if you do not take\ncare at the outset, or at least midway, to make men good, you will\nnever force them into an honest belief.\nBut, it will be said, is this all that pure reason can effect, in\nopening up prospects beyond the limits of experience? Nothing more than\ntwo articles of belief? Common sense could have done as much as this,\nwithout taking the philosophers to counsel in the matter!\nI shall not here eulogize philosophy for the benefits which the\nlaborious efforts of its criticism have conferred on human reason\u2014even\ngranting that its merit should turn out in the end to be only\nnegative\u2014for on this point something more will be said in the next\nsection. But, I ask, do you require that that knowledge which concerns\nall men, should transcend the common understanding, and should only be\nrevealed to you by philosophers? The very circumstance which has called\nforth your censure, is the best confirmation of the correctness of our\nprevious assertions, since it discloses, what could not have been\nforeseen, that Nature is not chargeable with any partial distribution\nof her gifts in those matters which concern all men without distinction\nand that, in respect to the essential ends of human nature, we cannot\nadvance further with the help of the highest philosophy, than under the\nguidance which nature has vouchsafed to the meanest understanding.\nChapter III. The Architectonic of Pure Reason\nBy the term architectonic I mean the art of constructing a system.\nWithout systematic unity, our knowledge cannot become science; it will\nbe an aggregate, and not a system. Thus architectonic is the doctrine\nof the scientific in cognition, and therefore necessarily forms part of\nour methodology.\nReason cannot permit our knowledge to remain in an unconnected and\nrhapsodistic state, but requires that the sum of our cognitions should\nconstitute a system. It is thus alone that they can advance the ends of\nreason. By a system I mean the unity of various cognitions under one\nidea. This idea is the conception\u2014given by reason\u2014of the form of a\nwhole, in so far as the conception determines \u00e0 priori not only the\nlimits of its content, but the place which each of its parts is to\noccupy. The scientific idea contains, therefore, the end and the form\nof the whole which is in accordance with that end. The unity of the\nend, to which all the parts of the system relate, and through which all\nhave a relation to each other, communicates unity to the whole system,\nso that the absence of any part can be immediately detected from our\nknowledge of the rest; and it determines \u00e0 priori the limits of the\nsystem, thus excluding all contingent or arbitrary additions. The whole\nis thus an organism (articulatio), and not an aggregate (coacervatio);\nit may grow from within (per intussusceptionem), but it cannot increase\nby external additions (per appositionem). It is, thus, like an animal\nbody, the growth of which does not add any limb, but, without changing\ntheir proportions, makes each in its sphere stronger and more active.\nWe require, for the execution of the idea of a system, a schema, that\nis, a content and an arrangement of parts determined \u00e0 priori by the\nprinciple which the aim of the system prescribes. A schema which is not\nprojected in accordance with an idea, that is, from the standpoint of\nthe highest aim of reason, but merely empirically, in accordance with\naccidental aims and purposes (the number of which cannot be\npredetermined), can give us nothing more than technical unity. But the\nschema which is originated from an idea (in which case reason presents\nus with aims \u00e0 priori, and does not look for them to experience), forms\nthe basis of architectonical unity. A science, in the proper\nacceptation of that term, cannot be formed technically, that is, from\nobservation of the similarity existing between different objects, and\nthe purely contingent use we make of our knowledge in concreto with\nreference to all kinds of arbitrary external aims; its constitution\nmust be framed on architectonical principles, that is, its parts must\nbe shown to possess an essential affinity, and be capable of being\ndeduced from one supreme and internal aim or end, which forms the\ncondition of the possibility of the scientific whole. The schema of a\nscience must give \u00e0 priori the plan of it (monogramma), and the\ndivision of the whole into parts, in conformity with the idea of the\nscience; and it must also distinguish this whole from all others,\naccording to certain understood principles.\nNo one will attempt to construct a science, unless he have some idea to\nrest on as a proper basis. But, in the elaboration of the science, he\nfinds that the schema, nay, even the definition which he at first gave\nof the science, rarely corresponds with his idea; for this idea lies,\nlike a germ, in our reason, its parts undeveloped and hid even from\nmicroscopical observation. For this reason, we ought to explain and\ndefine sciences, not according to the description which the originator\ngives of them, but according to the idea which we find based in reason\nitself, and which is suggested by the natural unity of the parts of\nthe science already accumulated. For it will often be found that the\noriginator of a science and even his latest successors remain attached\nto an erroneous idea, which they cannot render clear to themselves, and\nthat they thus fail in determining the true content, the articulation\nor systematic unity, and the limits of their science.\nIt is unfortunate that, only after having occupied ourselves for a long\ntime in the collection of materials, under the guidance of an idea\nwhich lies undeveloped in the mind, but not according to any definite\nplan of arrangement\u2014nay, only after we have spent much time and labour\nin the technical disposition of our materials, does it become possible\nto view the idea of a science in a clear light, and to project,\naccording to architectonical principles, a plan of the whole, in\naccordance with the aims of reason. Systems seem, like certain worms,\nto be formed by a kind of generatio aequivoca\u2014by the mere confluence of\nconceptions, and to gain completeness only with the progress of time.\nBut the schema or germ of all lies in reason; and thus is not only\nevery system organized according to its own idea, but all are united\ninto one grand system of human knowledge, of which they form members.\nFor this reason, it is possible to frame an architectonic of all human\ncognition, the formation of which, at the present time, considering the\nimmense materials collected or to be found in the ruins of old systems,\nwould not indeed be very difficult. Our purpose at present is merely to\nsketch the plan of the architectonic of all cognition given by pure\nreason; and we begin from the point where the main root of human\nknowledge divides into two, one of which is reason. By reason I\nunderstand here the whole higher faculty of cognition, the rational\nbeing placed in contradistinction to the empirical.\nIf I make complete abstraction of the content of cognition, objectively\nconsidered, all cognition is, from a subjective point of view, either\nhistorical or rational. Historical cognition is cognitio ex datis,\nrational, cognitio ex principiis. Whatever may be the original source\nof a cognition, it is, in relation to the person who possesses it,\nmerely historical, if he knows only what has been given him from\nanother quarter, whether that knowledge was communicated by direct\nexperience or by instruction. Thus the person who has learned a system\nof philosophy\u2014say the Wolfian\u2014although he has a perfect knowledge of\nall the principles, definitions, and arguments in that philosophy, as\nwell as of the divisions that have been made of the system, possesses\nreally no more than an historical knowledge of the Wolfian system; he\nknows only what has been told him, his judgements are only those which\nhe has received from his teachers. Dispute the validity of a\ndefinition, and he is completely at a loss to find another. He has\nformed his mind on another\u2019s; but the imitative faculty is not the\nproductive. His knowledge has not been drawn from reason; and although,\nobjectively considered, it is rational knowledge, subjectively, it is\nmerely historical. He has learned this or that philosophy and is merely\na plaster cast of a living man. Rational cognitions which are\nobjective, that is, which have their source in reason, can be so termed\nfrom a subjective point of view, only when they have been drawn by the\nindividual himself from the sources of reason, that is, from\nprinciples; and it is in this way alone that criticism, or even the\nrejection of what has been already learned, can spring up in the mind.\nAll rational cognition is, again, based either on conceptions, or on\nthe construction of conceptions. The former is termed philosophical,\nthe latter mathematical. I have already shown the essential difference\nof these two methods of cognition in the first chapter. A cognition may\nbe objectively philosophical and subjectively historical\u2014as is the case\nwith the majority of scholars and those who cannot look beyond the\nlimits of their system, and who remain in a state of pupilage all their\nlives. But it is remarkable that mathematical knowledge, when committed\nto memory, is valid, from the subjective point of view, as rational\nknowledge also, and that the same distinction cannot be drawn here as\nin the case of philosophical cognition. The reason is that the only way\nof arriving at this knowledge is through the essential principles of\nreason, and thus it is always certain and indisputable; because reason\nis employed in concreto\u2014but at the same time \u00e0 priori\u2014that is, in pure\nand, therefore, infallible intuition; and thus all causes of illusion\nand error are excluded. Of all the \u00e0 priori sciences of reason,\ntherefore, mathematics alone can be learned. Philosophy\u2014unless it be in\nan historical manner\u2014cannot be learned; we can at most learn to\nphilosophize.\nPhilosophy is the system of all philosophical cognition. We must use\nthis term in an objective sense, if we understand by it the archetype\nof all attempts at philosophizing, and the standard by which all\nsubjective philosophies are to be judged. In this sense, philosophy is\nmerely the idea of a possible science, which does not exist in\nconcreto, but to which we endeavour in various ways to approximate,\nuntil we have discovered the right path to pursue\u2014a path overgrown by\nthe errors and illusions of sense\u2014and the image we have hitherto tried\nin vain to shape has become a perfect copy of the great prototype.\nUntil that time, we cannot learn philosophy\u2014it does not exist; if it\ndoes, where is it, who possesses it, and how shall we know it? We can\nonly learn to philosophize; in other words, we can only exercise our\npowers of reasoning in accordance with general principles, retaining at\nthe same time, the right of investigating the sources of these\nprinciples, of testing, and even of rejecting them.\nUntil then, our conception of philosophy is only a scholastic\nconception\u2014a conception, that is, of a system of cognition which we are\ntrying to elaborate into a science; all that we at present know being\nthe systematic unity of this cognition, and consequently the logical\ncompleteness of the cognition for the desired end. But there is also a\ncosmical conception (conceptus cosmicus) of philosophy, which has\nalways formed the true basis of this term, especially when philosophy\nwas personified and presented to us in the ideal of a philosopher. In\nthis view philosophy is the science of the relation of all cognition to\nthe ultimate and essential aims of human reason (teleologia rationis\nhumanae), and the philosopher is not merely an artist\u2014who occupies\nhimself with conceptions\u2014but a lawgiver, legislating for human reason.\nIn this sense of the word, it would be in the highest degree arrogant\nto assume the title of philosopher, and to pretend that we had reached\nthe perfection of the prototype which lies in the idea alone.\nThe mathematician, the natural philosopher, and the logician\u2014how far\nsoever the first may have advanced in rational, and the two latter in\nphilosophical knowledge\u2014are merely artists, engaged in the arrangement\nand formation of conceptions; they cannot be termed philosophers. Above\nthem all, there is the ideal teacher, who employs them as instruments\nfor the advancement of the essential aims of human reason. Him alone\ncan we call philosopher; but he nowhere exists. But the idea of his\nlegislative power resides in the mind of every man, and it alone\nteaches us what kind of systematic unity philosophy demands in view of\nthe ultimate aims of reason. This idea is, therefore, a cosmical\nconception.[80]\n[80] By a cosmical conception, I mean one in which all men necessarily\ntake an interest; the aim of a science must accordingly be determined\naccording to scholastic conceptions, if it is regarded merely as a\nmeans to certain arbitrarily proposed ends.\nIn view of the complete systematic unity of reason, there can only be\none ultimate end of all the operations of the mind. To this all other\naims are subordinate, and nothing more than means for its attainment.\nThis ultimate end is the destination of man, and the philosophy which\nrelates to it is termed moral philosophy. The superior position\noccupied by moral philosophy, above all other spheres for the\noperations of reason, sufficiently indicates the reason why the\nancients always included the idea\u2014and in an especial manner\u2014of moralist\nin that of philosopher. Even at the present day, we call a man who\nappears to have the power of self-government, even although his\nknowledge may be very limited, by the name of philosopher.\nThe legislation of human reason, or philosophy, has two objects\u2014nature\nand freedom\u2014and thus contains not only the laws of nature, but also\nthose of ethics, at first in two separate systems, which, finally,\nmerge into one grand philosophical system of cognition. The philosophy\nof nature relates to that which is, that of ethics to that which ought\nto be.\nBut all philosophy is either cognition on the basis of pure reason, or\nthe cognition of reason on the basis of empirical principles. The\nformer is termed pure, the latter empirical philosophy.\nThe philosophy of pure reason is either prop\u00e6deutic, that is, an\ninquiry into the powers of reason in regard to pure \u00e0 priori cognition,\nand is termed critical philosophy; or it is, secondly, the system of\npure reason\u2014a science containing the systematic presentation of the\nwhole body of philosophical knowledge, true as well as illusory, given\nby pure reason\u2014and is called metaphysic. This name may, however, be\nalso given to the whole system of pure philosophy, critical philosophy\nincluded, and may designate the investigation into the sources or\npossibility of \u00e0 priori cognition, as well as the presentation of the \u00e0\npriori cognitions which form a system of pure philosophy\u2014excluding, at\nthe same time, all empirical and mathematical elements.\nMetaphysic is divided into that of the speculative and that of the\npractical use of pure reason, and is, accordingly, either the\nmetaphysic of nature, or the metaphysic of ethics. The former contains\nall the pure rational principles\u2014based upon conceptions alone (and thus\nexcluding mathematics)\u2014of all theoretical cognition; the latter, the\nprinciples which determine and necessitate \u00e0 priori all action. Now\nmoral philosophy alone contains a code of laws\u2014for the regulation of\nour actions\u2014which are deduced from principles entirely \u00e0 priori. Hence\nthe metaphysic of ethics is the only pure moral philosophy, as it is\nnot based upon anthropological or other empirical considerations. The\nmetaphysic of speculative reason is what is commonly called metaphysic\nin the more limited sense. But as pure moral philosophy properly forms\na part of this system of cognition, we must allow it to retain the name\nof metaphysic, although it is not requisite that we should insist on so\nterming it in our present discussion.\nIt is of the highest importance to separate those cognitions which\ndiffer from others both in kind and in origin, and to take great care\nthat they are not confounded with those with which they are generally\nfound connected. What the chemist does in the analysis of substances,\nwhat the mathematician in pure mathematics, is, in a still higher\ndegree, the duty of the philosopher, that the value of each different\nkind of cognition, and the part it takes in the operations of the mind,\nmay be clearly defined. Human reason has never wanted a metaphysic of\nsome kind, since it attained the power of thought, or rather of\nreflection; but it has never been able to keep this sphere of thought\nand cognition pure from all admixture of foreign elements. The idea of\na science of this kind is as old as speculation itself; and what mind\ndoes not speculate\u2014either in the scholastic or in the popular fashion?\nAt the same time, it must be admitted that even thinkers by profession\nhave been unable clearly to explain the distinction between the two\nelements of our cognition\u2014the one completely \u00e0 priori, the other \u00e0\nposteriori; and hence the proper definition of a peculiar kind of\ncognition, and with it the just idea of a science which has so long and\nso deeply engaged the attention of the human mind, has never been\nestablished. When it was said: \u201cMetaphysic is the science of the first\nprinciples of human cognition,\u201d this definition did not signalize a\npeculiarity in kind, but only a difference in degree; these first\nprinciples were thus declared to be more general than others, but no\ncriterion of distinction from empirical principles was given. Of these\nsome are more general, and therefore higher, than others; and\u2014as we\ncannot distinguish what is completely \u00e0 priori from that which is known\nto be \u00e0 posteriori\u2014where shall we draw the line which is to separate\nthe higher and so-called first principles, from the lower and\nsubordinate principles of cognition? What would be said if we were\nasked to be satisfied with a division of the epochs of the world into\nthe earlier centuries and those following them? \u201cDoes the fifth, or the\ntenth century belong to the earlier centuries?\u201d it would be asked. In\nthe same way I ask: Does the conception of extension belong to\nmetaphysics? You answer, \u201cYes.\u201d Well, that of body too? \u201cYes.\u201d And that\nof a fluid body? You stop, you are unprepared to admit this; for if you\ndo, everything will belong to metaphysics. From this it is evident that\nthe mere degree of subordination\u2014of the particular to the\ngeneral\u2014cannot determine the limits of a science; and that, in the\npresent case, we must expect to find a difference in the conceptions of\nmetaphysics both in kind and in origin. The fundamental idea of\nmetaphysics was obscured on another side by the fact that this kind of\n\u00e0 priori cognition showed a certain similarity in character with the\nscience of mathematics. Both have the property in common of possessing\nan \u00e0 priori origin; but, in the one, our knowledge is based upon\nconceptions, in the other, on the construction of conceptions. Thus a\ndecided dissimilarity between philosophical and mathematical cognition\ncomes out\u2014a dissimilarity which was always felt, but which could not be\nmade distinct for want of an insight into the criteria of the\ndifference. And thus it happened that, as philosophers themselves\nfailed in the proper development of the idea of their science, the\nelaboration of the science could not proceed with a definite aim, or\nunder trustworthy guidance. Thus, too, philosophers, ignorant of the\npath they ought to pursue and always disputing with each other\nregarding the discoveries which each asserted he had made, brought\ntheir science into disrepute with the rest of the world, and finally,\neven among themselves.\nAll pure \u00e0 priori cognition forms, therefore, in view of the peculiar\nfaculty which originates it, a peculiar and distinct unity; and\nmetaphysic is the term applied to the philosophy which attempts to\nrepresent that cognition in this systematic unity. The speculative part\nof metaphysic, which has especially appropriated this appellation\u2014that\nwhich we have called the metaphysic of nature\u2014and which considers\neverything, as it is (not as it ought to be), by means of \u00e0 priori\nconceptions, is divided in the following manner.\nMetaphysic, in the more limited acceptation of the term, consists of\ntwo parts\u2014transcendental philosophy and the physiology of pure reason.\nThe former presents the system of all the conceptions and principles\nbelonging to the understanding and the reason, and which relate to\nobjects in general, but not to any particular given objects\n(Ontologia); the latter has nature for its subject-matter, that is, the\nsum of given objects\u2014whether given to the senses, or, if we will, to\nsome other kind of intuition\u2014and is accordingly physiology, although\nonly rationalis. But the use of the faculty of reason in this rational\nmode of regarding nature is either physical or hyperphysical, or, more\nproperly speaking, immanent or transcendent. The former relates to\nnature, in so far as our knowledge regarding it may be applied in\nexperience (in concreto); the latter to that connection of the objects\nof experience, which transcends all experience. Transcendent physiology\nhas, again, an internal and an external connection with its object,\nboth, however, transcending possible experience; the former is the\nphysiology of nature as a whole, or transcendental cognition of the\nworld, the latter of the connection of the whole of nature with a being\nabove nature, or transcendental cognition of God.\nImmanent physiology, on the contrary, considers nature as the sum of\nall sensuous objects, consequently, as it is presented to us\u2014but still\naccording to \u00e0 priori conditions, for it is under these alone that\nnature can be presented to our minds at all. The objects of immanent\nphysiology are of two kinds: 1. Those of the external senses, or\ncorporeal nature; 2. The object of the internal sense, the soul, or, in\naccordance with our fundamental conceptions of it, thinking nature. The\nmetaphysics of corporeal nature is called physics; but, as it must\ncontain only the principles of an \u00e0 priori cognition of nature, we must\nterm it rational physics. The metaphysics of thinking nature is called\npsychology, and for the same reason is to be regarded as merely the\nrational cognition of the soul.\nThus the whole system of metaphysics consists of four principal parts:\n1. Ontology; 2. Rational Physiology; 3. Rational cosmology; and 4.\nRational theology. The second part\u2014that of the rational doctrine of\nnature\u2014may be subdivided into two, physica rationalis[81] and\npsychologia rationalis.\n[81] It must not be supposed that I mean by this appellation what is\ngenerally called physica general is, and which is rather mathematics\nthan a philosophy of nature. For the metaphysic of nature is\ncompletely different from mathematics, nor is it so rich in results,\nalthough it is of great importance as a critical test of the\napplication of pure understanding\u2014cognition to nature. For want of its\nguidance, even mathematicians, adopting certain common notions\u2014which\nare, in fact, metaphysical\u2014have unconsciously crowded their theories\nof nature with hypotheses, the fallacy of which becomes evident upon\nthe application of the principles of this metaphysic, without\ndetriment, however, to the employment of mathematics in this sphere of\ncognition.\nThe fundamental idea of a philosophy of pure reason of necessity\ndictates this division; it is, therefore, architectonical\u2014in accordance\nwith the highest aims of reason, and not merely technical, or according\nto certain accidentally-observed similarities existing between the\ndifferent parts of the whole science. For this reason, also, is the\ndivision immutable and of legislative authority. But the reader may\nobserve in it a few points to which he ought to demur, and which may\nweaken his conviction of its truth and legitimacy.\nIn the first place, how can I desire an \u00e0 priori cognition or\nmetaphysic of objects, in so far as they are given \u00e0 posteriori? and\nhow is it possible to cognize the nature of things according to \u00e0\npriori principles, and to attain to a rational physiology? The answer\nis this. We take from experience nothing more than is requisite to\npresent us with an object (in general) of the external or of the\ninternal sense; in the former case, by the mere conception of matter\n(impenetrable and inanimate extension), in the latter, by the\nconception of a thinking being\u2014given in the internal empirical\nrepresentation, I think. As to the rest, we must not employ in our\nmetaphysic of these objects any empirical principles (which add to the\ncontent of our conceptions by means of experience), for the purpose of\nforming by their help any judgements respecting these objects.\nSecondly, what place shall we assign to empirical psychology, which has\nalways been considered a part of metaphysics, and from which in our\ntime such important philosophical results have been expected, after the\nhope of constructing an \u00e0 priori system of knowledge had been\nabandoned? I answer: It must be placed by the side of empirical physics\nor physics proper; that is, must be regarded as forming a part of\napplied philosophy, the \u00e0 priori principles of which are contained in\npure philosophy, which is therefore connected, although it must not be\nconfounded, with psychology. Empirical psychology must therefore be\nbanished from the sphere of metaphysics, and is indeed excluded by the\nvery idea of that science. In conformity, however, with scholastic\nusage, we must permit it to occupy a place in metaphysics\u2014but only as\nan appendix to it. We adopt this course from motives of economy; as\npsychology is not as yet full enough to occupy our attention as an\nindependent study, while it is, at the same time, of too great\nimportance to be entirely excluded or placed where it has still less\naffinity than it has with the subject of metaphysics. It is a stranger\nwho has been long a guest; and we make it welcome to stay, until it can\ntake up a more suitable abode in a complete system of anthropology\u2014the\npendant to empirical physics.\nThe above is the general idea of metaphysics, which, as more was\nexpected from it than could be looked for with justice, and as these\npleasant expectations were unfortunately never realized, fell into\ngeneral disrepute. Our Critique must have fully convinced the reader\nthat, although metaphysics cannot form the foundation of religion, it\nmust always be one of its most important bulwarks, and that human\nreason, which naturally pursues a dialectical course, cannot do without\nthis science, which checks its tendencies towards dialectic and, by\nelevating reason to a scientific and clear self-knowledge, prevents the\nravages which a lawless speculative reason would infallibly commit in\nthe sphere of morals as well as in that of religion. We may be sure,\ntherefore, whatever contempt may be thrown upon metaphysics by those\nwho judge a science not by its own nature, but according to the\naccidental effects it may have produced, that it can never be\ncompletely abandoned, that we must always return to it as to a beloved\none who has been for a time estranged, because the questions with which\nit is engaged relate to the highest aims of humanity, and reason must\nalways labour either to attain to settled views in regard to these, or\nto destroy those which others have already established.\nMetaphysic, therefore\u2014that of nature, as well as that of ethics, but in\nan especial manner the criticism which forms the prop\u00e6deutic to all\nthe operations of reason\u2014forms properly that department of knowledge\nwhich may be termed, in the truest sense of the word, philosophy. The\npath which it pursues is that of science, which, when it has once been\ndiscovered, is never lost, and never misleads. Mathematics, natural\nscience, the common experience of men, have a high value as means, for\nthe most part, to accidental ends\u2014but at last also, to those which are\nnecessary and essential to the existence of humanity. But to guide them\nto this high goal, they require the aid of rational cognition on the\nbasis of pure conceptions, which, be it termed as it may, is properly\nnothing but metaphysics.\nFor the same reason, metaphysics forms likewise the completion of the\nculture of human reason. In this respect, it is indispensable, setting\naside altogether the influence which it exerts as a science. For its\nsubject-matter is the elements and highest maxims of reason, which form\nthe basis of the possibility of some sciences and of the use of all.\nThat, as a purely speculative science, it is more useful in preventing\nerror than in the extension of knowledge, does not detract from its\nvalue; on the contrary, the supreme office of censor which it occupies\nassures to it the highest authority and importance. This office it\nadministers for the purpose of securing order, harmony, and well-being\nto science, and of directing its noble and fruitful labours to the\nhighest possible aim\u2014the happiness of all mankind.\nChapter IV. The History of Pure Reason\nThis title is placed here merely for the purpose of designating a\ndivision of the system of pure reason of which I do not intend to treat\nat present. I shall content myself with casting a cursory glance, from\na purely transcendental point of view\u2014that of the nature of pure\nreason\u2014on the labours of philosophers up to the present time. They have\naimed at erecting an edifice of philosophy; but to my eye this edifice\nappears to be in a very ruinous condition.\nIt is very remarkable, although naturally it could not have been\notherwise, that, in the infancy of philosophy, the study of the nature\nof God and the constitution of a future world formed the commencement,\nrather than the conclusion, as we should have it, of the speculative\nefforts of the human mind. However rude the religious conceptions\ngenerated by the remains of the old manners and customs of a less\ncultivated time, the intelligent classes were not thereby prevented\nfrom devoting themselves to free inquiry into the existence and nature\nof God; and they easily saw that there could be no surer way of\npleasing the invisible ruler of the world, and of attaining to\nhappiness in another world at least, than a good and honest course of\nlife in this. Thus theology and morals formed the two chief motives, or\nrather the points of attraction in all abstract inquiries. But it was\nthe former that especially occupied the attention of speculative\nreason, and which afterwards became so celebrated under the name of\nmetaphysics.\nI shall not at present indicate the periods of time at which the\ngreatest changes in metaphysics took place, but shall merely give a\nhasty sketch of the different ideas which occasioned the most important\nrevolutions in this sphere of thought. There are three different ends\nin relation to which these revolutions have taken place.\n1. In relation to the object of the cognition of reason, philosophers\nmay be divided into sensualists and intellectualists. Epicurus may be\nregarded as the head of the former, Plato of the latter. The\ndistinction here signalized, subtle as it is, dates from the earliest\ntimes, and was long maintained. The former asserted that reality\nresides in sensuous objects alone, and that everything else is merely\nimaginary; the latter, that the senses are the parents of illusion and\nthat truth is to be found in the understanding alone. The former did\nnot deny to the conceptions of the understanding a certain kind of\nreality; but with them it was merely logical, with the others it was\nmystical. The former admitted intellectual conceptions, but declared\nthat sensuous objects alone possessed real existence. The latter\nmaintained that all real objects were intelligible, and believed that\nthe pure understanding possessed a faculty of intuition apart from\nsense, which, in their opinion, served only to confuse the ideas of the\nunderstanding.\n2. In relation to the origin of the pure cognitions of reason, we find\none school maintaining that they are derived entirely from experience,\nand another that they have their origin in reason alone. Aristotle\nmay be regarded as the head of the empiricists, and Plato of the\nnoologists. Locke, the follower of Aristotle in modern times, and\nLeibnitz of Plato (although he cannot be said to have imitated him in\nhis mysticism), have not been able to bring this question to a settled\nconclusion. The procedure of Epicurus in his sensual system, in which\nhe always restricted his conclusions to the sphere of experience, was\nmuch more consequent than that of Aristotle and Locke. The latter\nespecially, after having derived all the conceptions and principles\nof the mind from experience, goes so far, in the employment of these\nconceptions and principles, as to maintain that we can prove the\nexistence of God and the immortality of the soul\u2014both of them objects\nlying beyond the limits of possible experience\u2014with the same force of\ndemonstration, as any mathematical proposition.\n3. In relation to method. Method is procedure according to principles.\nWe may divide the methods at present employed in the field of inquiry\ninto the naturalistic and the scientific. The naturalist of pure reason\nlays it down as his principle that common reason, without the aid of\nscience\u2014which he calls sound reason, or common sense\u2014can give a more\nsatisfactory answer to the most important questions of metaphysics than\nspeculation is able to do. He must maintain, therefore, that we can\ndetermine the content and circumference of the moon more certainly by\nthe naked eye, than by the aid of mathematical reasoning. But this\nsystem is mere misology reduced to principles; and, what is the most\nabsurd thing in this doctrine, the neglect of all scientific means is\nparaded as a peculiar method of extending our cognition. As regards\nthose who are naturalists because they know no better, they are\ncertainly not to be blamed. They follow common sense, without parading\ntheir ignorance as a method which is to teach us the wonderful secret,\nhow we are to find the truth which lies at the bottom of the well of\nDemocritus.\nQuod sapio satis est mihi, non ego curo Esse quod\nArcesilas aerumnosique Solones. PERSIUS\n\u2014Satirae, iii. 78-79.\nis their motto, under which they may lead a pleasant and praiseworthy\nlife, without troubling themselves with science or troubling science\nwith them.\nAs regards those who wish to pursue a scientific method, they have now\nthe choice of following either the dogmatical or the sceptical, while\nthey are bound never to desert the systematic mode of procedure. When I\nmention, in relation to the former, the celebrated Wolf, and as regards\nthe latter, David Hume, I may leave, in accordance with my present\nintention, all others unnamed. The critical path alone is still open.\nIf my reader has been kind and patient enough to accompany me on this\nhitherto untravelled route, he can now judge whether, if he and others\nwill contribute their exertions towards making this narrow footpath a\nhigh road of thought, that which many centuries have failed to\naccomplish may not be executed before the close of the present\u2014namely,\nto bring Reason to perfect contentment in regard to that which has\nalways, but without permanent results, occupied her powers and engaged\nher ardent desire for knowledge.\n***", "source": "critique_of_pure_reason.txt"}
