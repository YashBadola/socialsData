The majority of mortals, Paulinus, complain bitterly of the spitefulness of Nature, because we are born for a brief span of life, because even this space that has been granted to us rushes by so speedily and so swiftly that all save a very few find life at an end just when they are getting ready to live.

It is not that we have a short time to live, but that we waste a lot of it. Life is long enough, and a sufficiently generous amount has been given to us for the highest achievements if it were all well invested. But when it is wasted in heedless luxury and spent on no good activity, we are forced at last by death's final constraint to realize that it has passed away before we knew it was passing. So it is: we are not given a short life but we make it short, and we are not ill-supplied but wasteful of it… Life is long if you know how to use it.

People are frugal in guarding their personal property; but as soon as it comes to squandering time they are most wasteful of the one thing in which it is right to be stingy.

I am always surprised when I see some people demanding the time of others and meeting with a most compliance; both parties have in view the object for which the time is asked, neither with regard to the time itself: as if nothing there were being asked for and nothing given. They are trifling with life's most precious commodity, being deceived because it is an intangible thing, not appearing to the eye, and therefore reckoned very cheap, and indeed as of almost no value.

The man who spends all his time on his own needs, who organizes every day as though it were his last, neither longs for nor fears the next day.
