The most widely accepted and meaningful notion we have of God is expressed well enough in these words: that God is an absolutely perfect being; but the consequences of these words are not sufficiently considered; and to push into their further consequences, it is in order to remark that there are several entirely different natures in nature and that each of them has its ultimate perfection.

Since God is the most perfect object that is possible, his will is the most perfect will; and the happiness of the supreme spirit is his own perfection, so that he is not susceptible to any external impression.

I hold that God does everything for the best and that nothing can injure his glory; and I know that he does nothing without order.

Now since the most perfect being has chosen the best universe, specifically this one, it follows that there is nothing in it that is not ordered in the most regular manner possible. There are no irregular motions, no exceptions to rules, except those which are miracles of the highest order, which occur for reasons of grace rather than nature.

It is said that the works of God are good; but it is not sufficiently considered that they are the very best that could be made. For God's supreme wisdom, joined to a goodness that is no less infinite, cannot but have chosen the best. For as a lesser evil is a kind of good, even so a lesser good is a kind of evil if it stands in the way of a greater good; and there would be something to correct in the actions of God if it were possible to do better.

Thus I say that God, who has chosen the most perfect world, has acted consistently with his wisdom, and it is impossible that he could have done better.

It is necessary to know what is the true nature of the body. This nature does not consist solely in extension, size, figure, and motion, but in something else which is related to souls, and which is commonly called substantial form, although these forms are quite different from those of the Aristotelians.

The concept of an individual substance includes all its experiences, together with all their attendant circumstances and the whole sequence of exterior events. For instance, the concept of Julius Caesar includes the passage of the Rubicon, the defeat of Pompey, and the becoming perpetual dictator. This concept, existing in the mind of God, determines the nature of the subject.

Thus, when we consider carefully the connection of things, we see that from any given state of any substance, we can deduce its entire future history and retrodict its entire past history, for the present is big with the future and laden with the past.

We have said that the concept of an individual substance includes once for all everything which can ever happen to it and that in that concept one can see, à priori, everything that will be able to be said truly of it. But it does not follow from this that the events are necessary, but only that they are certain, for God sees them in the concept of the subject.

It is true that God knows everything which will happen to us, but he knows it because it is in our nature to act in such a way, and his foreknowledge does not impose any necessity upon our actions. Our freedom is not destroyed by this certainty; rather it is established.

The harmony between the body and the soul is not a physical influence of one upon the other, but a pre-established harmony, God having created each of these two substances in such a way that they agree perfectly, following their own laws, without confusion.

Thus the soul follows its own laws, and the body likewise follows its own laws; and they agree with each other in virtue of the pre-established harmony between all substances, since they are all representations of one and the same universe.
