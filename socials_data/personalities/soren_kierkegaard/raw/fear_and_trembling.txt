The ethical expression for what Abraham did is that he would murder Isaac; the religious expression is that he would sacrifice Isaac — but in this contradiction lies the dread which can well make a man sleepless, and yet Abraham is not what he is without this dread.

Faith is precisely this paradox, that the individual as the particular is higher than the universal, is justified over against it, is not subordinate but superior — yet in such a way, be it observed, that it is the particular individual who, after he has been subordinated as the particular to the universal, now through the universal becomes the individual who as the particular is superior to the universal, for the fact that the individual as the particular stands in an absolute relation to the absolute.

If this is not faith, then Abraham is lost, then faith has never existed in the world... because it has always existed. For if the ethical (i.e., the moral) is the highest thing, and if nothing incommensurable remains in man in any other way but as the evil (i.e., the particular which has to be expressed in the universal), then one needs no other categories than those which the Greek philosophers possessed or which can be deduced from them by consistent thought. This is the truth which Hegel has grasped and which he has preached with so much power. But he was wrong in speaking of faith, wrong in not protesting loudly and clearly that Abraham is a murderer and that it is meaningful to acquit him only if one acknowledges the paradox of faith.
