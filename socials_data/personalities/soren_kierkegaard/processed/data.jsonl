{"text": "The self is a relation that relates itself to itself or is the relation's relating itself to itself in the relation; the self is not the relation but that the relation relates itself to itself. A human being is a synthesis of the infinite and the finite, of the temporal and the eternal, of freedom and necessity, in short, a synthesis. A synthesis is a relation between two. Considered in this way, a human being is still not a self.\n\nDespair is the sickness unto death. It is not a physical sickness, but a sickness of the spirit. And this sickness is not one that we contract and then die from, like a fever. No, the torment of despair is precisely that one cannot die. It is to be sick unto death but unable to die. The dying is not the end, but the dying is continuously converted into living. The despairing person cannot consume himself, cannot get rid of himself, cannot become nothing. This is the formula for all despair: to want to be oneself, or not to want to be oneself.\n\nThe commonest form of despair is not knowing that one is in despair. It is the despair of the immediate man, who lives in the category of the finite and the temporal, and has no consciousness of the eternal. He may be happy, successful, and well-adjusted, but he is in despair because he has no self. He is a spiritless man.\n", "source": "sickness_unto_death_excerpt.txt"}
{"text": "The Knight of Faith is the only happy man, the heir to the finite, while the Knight of Infinite Resignation is a stranger and an alien. To make the movement of infinite resignation needs no faith, for what I gain by resignation is my eternal consciousness, and this is a purely philosophical movement which I dare say I am able to make if it is required, and which I can train myself to make, for whenever any finiteness becomes too heavy for me, I make a movement on my own self, and then I am in the infinite. But to have faith is this: that I, having made the movement of infinite resignation, then make the movement of faith by virtue of the absurd, and so get everything back again.\n\nHere is the paradox: that the single individual is higher than the universal. If this is not so, then Abraham is a murderer and faith is a temptation. But if it is so, then Abraham is a knight of faith. He does not act by virtue of the universal, but by virtue of the absurd. He suspends the ethical, not to sin, but to reach a higher telos: his relationship with the Absolute. This is the teleological suspension of the ethical.\n\nI cannot understand Abraham, I can only admire him. He believed that he would receive Isaac back, in this life, despite the fact that he was about to sacrifice him. This is the movement of faith, the double movement. Infinite resignation gives up everything, but faith says: \"I shall imply get it all back by virtue of the absurd.\" This requires a passion that goes beyond human understanding.\n", "source": "fear_and_trembling_excerpt.txt"}
