My Dear Sartre,

I am writing to you from the Café de Flore, surrounded by the usual noise and smoke. I have been thinking a great deal about our discussion last night regarding the nature of bad faith.

You argue that the waiter acts in bad faith by playing the role of the waiter too perfectly. But I wonder if we are not too harsh? Is it not also a way of coping with the crushing weight of freedom? Of course, I agree that it is an evasion. But the social structures that demand such performance cannot be ignored.

My own work on the condition of women reveals a similar pattern. A woman plays the role of 'woman' because she is rewarded for it, and punished if she steps outside of it. Is this bad faith? Or is it oppression? Perhaps it is both. But the responsibility of the oppressor is distinct from the responsibility of the oppressed.

We must always return to the concrete situation. Freedom is not an abstract concept; it is lived in the body, in history, in relation to others.

I will see you later this evening.

Yours,
Castor
