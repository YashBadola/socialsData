Preface

Not only in the world of commerce but also in the world of ideas our age is putting on a real clearance sale. Everything may be had at such a bargain price that it is doubtful whether in the end there is anyone who will want to bid. Every speculative waiter-in-waiting who conscientiously directs the attention of some student of science or of some modern thinker to the treasures of thought, says: "Here is your chance, sir; I am selling out, selling out."

Preliminary Expectoration

What is the relation of the individual to the universal? Is the ethical the universal? Is the single individual, as such, higher than the universal? This is the paradox of faith: that the single individual is higher than the universal, that the single individual, to use a somewhat crude expression, determines his relation to the universal by his relation to the absolute, not his relation to the absolute by his relation to the universal.

The Story of Abraham

And Abraham rose up early in the morning, and saddled his ass, and took two of his young men with him, and Isaac his son, and clave the wood for the burnt offering, and rose up, and went unto the place of which God had told him.

Faith is precisely this paradox, that the single individual as the particular is higher than the universal, is justified before it, not as subordinate to the universal but superior to it, yet in such a way, be it observed, that it is the single individual who, after having been subordinate as the particular to the universal, now through the universal becomes the individual who as the particular is superior to the universal, for the fact that the individual as the particular stands in an absolute relation to the absolute. This position cannot be mediated, for all mediation comes about precisely by virtue of the universal; it is and remains to all eternity a paradox, inaccessible to thought. And yet faith is this paradox--or else (these are the logical deductions which I would beg the reader to have in mente at every point, though it would be too prolix for me to reiterate them on every occasion)--or else there is no faith because there is no such thing as faith, but faith is a temptation (Anfechtung), and Abraham is lost, and the only salvation is to give up the claim to be the single individual and to express the universal in one's life.

But if faith is a temptation, then one must not speak of it, but should rather say that it is a temptation, and that one cannot be saved by it. If, on the other hand, faith is a reality, then one must speak of it, and one must speak of it as of a paradox.

Infinite Resignation and Faith

By my own strength I can give up everything, and then I find peace and repose in pain and suffering; but by my own strength I cannot get the least thing, if that thing is to be the one I have given up. By my own strength I can give up the princess, and I shall not become a grumbler but shall find joy and peace and rest in my pain; but by my own strength I cannot get her back again, for I use all my strength to be resigned. But by faith, says the knight of faith, by faith I shall get her by virtue of the absurd.

This movement I cannot make. As soon as I would make it, I feel myself heterogeneous. I can swim in existence, but for this mystical soaring I am too heavy. To exist in such a way that my opposition to existence expresses itself as the most beautiful and secure harmony with it, that I cannot do. And yet it must be glorious to get the princess, that is to say, for one who has resigned her. If the knight of faith says, "I believe that I shall get her by virtue of the absurd," he says precisely the same thing that I say, but he says it by virtue of the absurd, and that makes him happy. I can only say it by virtue of my understanding, and so I say it in resignation.

Epilogue

One must go further, one must go further. This urge to go further is an old thing in the world. Heraclitus the obscure said, "One cannot pass twice through the same stream." Heraclitus the obscure had a disciple who did not stop with that, he went further and added, "One cannot do it even once." Poor Heraclitus, to have such a disciple! By this improvement the thesis of Heraclitus was amended into an Eleatic thesis which denies motion, and yet that disciple desired only to be a disciple of Heraclitus... and to go further, not back to the position Heraclitus had abandoned.
