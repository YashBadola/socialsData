1 The world is everything that is the case.
1.1 The world is the totality of facts, not of things.
1.11 The world is determined by the facts, and by these being all the facts.
1.12 For the totality of facts determines both what is the case, and also all that is not the case.
1.13 The facts in logical space are the world.
1.2 The world divides into facts.
2 What is the case, the fact, is the existence of atomic facts.
2.01 An atomic fact is a combination of objects (entities, things).
2.011 It is essential to a thing that it can be a constituent part of an atomic fact.
3 The logical picture of the facts is the thought.
3.001 "An atomic fact is thinkable"—means: we can imagine it.
4 The thought is the significant proposition.
4.001 The totality of propositions is the language.
5 Propositions are truth-functions of elementary propositions.
5.6 The limits of my language mean the limits of my world.
6 The general form of truth-function is: [p, ξ, N(ξ)].
6.4 All propositions are of equal value.
6.41 The sense of the world must lie outside the world.
6.522 There are, indeed, things that cannot be put into words. They make themselves manifest. They are what is mystical.
7 Whereof one cannot speak, thereof one must be silent.
