{"text": "LECTURE I. RECENT CRITICISMS OF \"CONSCIOUSNESS\"\nThere are certain occurrences which we call \"mental\" or \"psychical,\"\nand others which we call \"physical\" or \"material.\" A large part of\nphilosophical controversy is concerned with the question whether these\ntwo classes of occurrences are two totally distinct realms, or whether\nthey are reducible to one. I have not myself established any peaceable\n_modus vivendi_ between these two opposing points of view, but I think\nthat recent inquiry has made it possible to see that the issue is not\nso sharp as it is generally supposed to be.\nThe view which I wish to advocate in these lectures is one which may\nbe called \"neutral monism.\" It is the view that the \"stuff\" of which\nthe world of our experience is composed is, in my belief, neither\n\"mind\" nor \"matter,\" but something more primitive than either. Both\nmind and matter seem to be composite, and the stuff of which they are\ncompounded lies in a sense between the two, in a sense above them both,\nlike a common ancestor.\nI shall begin by a consideration of the nature of \"consciousness,\" as\nthis notion has been recently criticized by the behaviorists and the\nAmerican realists.\nFor the purpose of this discussion, I shall take as my text-book\nWilliam James's _Essays in Radical Empiricism_. I do this because I\nbelieve that, although there are points in his analysis where he seems\nto me to have gone astray, he is nevertheless the first author to have\nclearly stated the view that \"consciousness\" is not an entity, but a\nfunction.\nThe view that \"consciousness\" is a function, not an entity, is not\nnew. It was held by Mach, and, in a less explicit form, by the early\npositivists. But James gave it a new force and a new setting. His\nessay \"Does 'Consciousness' Exist?\" (1904) contains the kernel of\nthe whole matter. \"Consciousness,\" he says, \"is the name of a\nnon-entity, and has no right to a place among first principles. Those\nwho still cling to it are clinging to a mere echo, the faint rumor\nleft behind by the disappearing 'soul' upon the air of philosophy.\"\nThis is a very revolutionary statement. We are all accustomed to think\nthat, however doubtful the existence of matter may be, the existence\nof our own minds is indubitable. \"I think, therefore I am,\" said\nDescartes; and ever since his time it has been taken as a datum that\nwe are immediately aware of our own existence as thinking beings. But\nJames denies this. He says: \"There is, I mean, no aboriginal stuff or\nquality of being, contrasted with that of which material objects are\nmade, out of which our thoughts of them are made.\"\nThe arguments which James brings forward in support of this view are,\nto my mind, very convincing. He points out that, if we analyze our\nexperience, we find that the distinction between \"knower\" and \"known\"\nis one which falls within experience, not one which stands outside it\nand relates it to something else. \"The instant field of the present,\"\nhe says, \"is at all times what I call the 'pure experience.' It is only\nvirtually or potentially either subject or object as yet. For the time\nbeing, it is plain, unqualified actuality, or existence, a simple\n_that_.\"\nThis view, that the primary stuff of experience is neither mental\nnor physical, but something neutral, is one which I find myself\nincreasingly inclined to accept. But I think that James goes too\nfar in his rejection of \"consciousness.\" He seems to imply that the\ndistinction between mind and matter is one which is entirely pragmatic,\nand that there is no real difference between the two. This I cannot\nadmit. I think that there is a real difference, though it is not the\ndifference which is usually supposed to exist.\nThe main point which I wish to make in these lectures is that the\ndistinction between mind and matter is not a distinction between two\ndifferent kinds of substances, but a distinction between two different\nways of arranging the same elements. The elements themselves are\nneither mental nor physical; they are \"neutral.\" But they can be\narranged in two different ways, so as to form on the one hand a\n\"mind,\" and on the other hand a \"piece of matter.\"\nLet me illustrate this by an analogy. Suppose you have a set of\nphotographs of a certain landscape. You can arrange these photographs\nin two ways. You can arrange them geographically, so as to reconstruct\nthe landscape; or you can arrange them biographically, so as to\nreconstruct the history of the photographer. In the first case, you\nare acting like a physicist; in the second case, you are acting like a\npsychologist. But the photographs themselves are the same in both cases.\nSo it is, I suggest, with the elements of our experience. They are\nthe same elements, whether we arrange them as a physical world or as\na mental world. The difference lies in the arrangement, not in the\nelements themselves.\nThis view has the great advantage of getting rid of the dualism of mind\nand matter, which has been the despair of philosophers for centuries.\nIf mind and matter are composed of the same stuff, then there is no\ndifficulty in understanding how they can interact. We do not have to\nsuppose that there is some mysterious \"bridge\" between two totally\ndifferent worlds.\nBut if we accept this view, we must be prepared to give up many of\nour cherished beliefs about the nature of the mind. We must give up\nthe belief that the mind is a single, indivisible entity, a \"soul\"\nor \"self.\" We must regard the mind as a collection of elements, just\nas we regard the body as a collection of cells. And we must be\nprepared to admit that the elements of the mind are not essentially\ndifferent from the elements of the physical world.\nThis is a hard saying, and I do not expect you to accept it all at\nonce. But I hope that, as we proceed, you will see that it provides\na more coherent and scientific account of the world than the older\ntheories.\nIn the following lectures, I shall try to work out this view in detail.\nI shall consider the nature of sensation, of imagery, of belief, and\nof desire. And I shall try to show how all these mental phenomena can\nbe explained in terms of the \"neutral stuff\" which I have postulated.\nBut before I do that, I must say a few words about the method which\nI propose to adopt. I shall adopt the method of analysis. That is to\nsay, I shall try to break down complex problems into their simpler\nconstituents. This is the method which has been so successful in\nscience, and I believe that it is the only method which can lead to\nsolid results in philosophy.\nPhilosophy has suffered too much from the attempt to solve the riddle\nof the universe by a single stroke of insight. We must be content to\nadvance step by step, solving one little problem after another, until\nwe have built up a body of knowledge which is as sure and certain as\nhuman fallibility will allow.\nThis is the spirit in which I approach the task before us. I do not\nclaim to have solved all the problems of philosophy. I only claim to\nhave made a beginning. And I hope that you will join me in this\nadventure of thought, and help me to push back the boundaries of\nignorance a little further.", "source": "analysis_of_mind.txt"}
{"text": "CHAPTER I. APPEARANCE AND REALITY\nIs there any knowledge in the world which is so certain that no reasonable man could doubt it? This question, which at first sight might not seem difficult, is really one of the most difficult that can be asked. When we have realized the obstacles in the way of a straightforward and confident answer, we shall be well launched on the study of philosophy\u2014for philosophy is merely the attempt to answer such ultimate questions, not carelessly and dogmatically, as we do in ordinary life and even in the sciences, but critically, after exploring all that makes such questions puzzling, and after realizing all the vagueness and confusion that underlie our ordinary ideas.\nIn daily life, we assume as certain many things which, on a closer scrutiny, are found to be so full of apparent contradictions that only a great amount of thought enables us to know what it is that we really may believe. In the search for certainty, it is natural to begin with our present experiences, and in some sense, no doubt, knowledge is to be derived from them. But any statement as to what it is that our immediate experiences make us know is very likely to be wrong. It seems to me that I am now sitting in a chair, at a table of a certain shape, on which I see sheets of paper with writing or print. By turning my head I see out of the window buildings and clouds and the sun. I believe that the sun is about ninety-three million miles from the earth; that it is a hot globe many times bigger than the earth; that, owing to the earth's rotation, it rises every morning, and will continue to do so for an indefinite time in the future. I believe that, if any other normal person comes into my room, he will see the same chairs and tables and books and papers as I see, and that the table which I see is the same as the table which I feel pressing against my arm. All this seems to be so evident as to be hardly worth stating, except in answer to a man who doubts whether I know anything. Yet all this may be reasonably doubted, and all of it requires much careful discussion before we can be sure that we have stated it in a form that is wholly true.\nTo make our difficulties plain, let us concentrate attention on the table. To the eye it is oblong, brown and shiny, to the touch it is smooth and cool and hard; when I tap it, it gives out a wooden sound. Any one else who sees and feels and hears the table will agree with this description, so that it might seem as if no difficulty would arise; but as soon as we try to be more precise our troubles begin. Although I believe that the table is 'really' of the same colour all over, the parts that reflect the light look much brighter than the other parts, and some parts look white because of reflected light. I know that, if I move, the parts that reflect the light will be different, so that the apparent distribution of colours on the table will change. It follows that if several people are looking at the table at the same moment, no two of them will see exactly the same distribution of colours, because no two can see it from exactly the same point of view, and any change in the point of view makes some change in the way the light is reflected.\nFor most practical purposes these differences are unimportant, but to the painter they are all-important: the painter has to unlearn the habit of thinking that things seem to have the colour which common sense says they 'really' have, and to learn the habit of seeing things as they appear. Here we have already the beginning of one of the distinctions that cause most trouble in philosophy\u2014the distinction between 'appearance' and 'reality', between what things seem to be and what they are. The painter wants to know what things seem to be, the practical man and the philosopher want to know what they are; but the philosopher's wish to know this is stronger than the practical man's, and is more troubled by knowledge as to the difficulties of answering the question.\nTo return to the table. It is evident from what we have found, that there is no colour which pre-eminently appears to be _the_ colour of the table, or even of any one particular part of the table\u2014it appears to be of different colours from different points of view, and there is no reason for regarding some of these as more really its colour than others. And we know that even from a given point of view the colour will seem different by artificial light, or to a colour-blind man, or to a man wearing blue spectacles, while in the dark there will be no colour at all, though to touch and hearing the table will be unchanged. This colour is not something which is inherent in the table, but something depending upon the table and the spectator and the way the light falls on the table. When, in ordinary life, we speak of _the_ colour of the table, we only mean the sort of colour which it will seem to have to a normal spectator from an ordinary point of view under usual conditions of light. But the other colours which appear under other conditions have just as good a right to be considered real; and therefore, to avoid favouritism, we are compelled to deny that, in itself, the table has any one particular colour.\nThe same thing applies to the texture. With the naked eye one can see the grain, but otherwise the table looks smooth and even. If we looked at it through a microscope, we should see roughnesses and hills and valleys, and all sorts of differences that are imperceptible to the naked eye. Which of these is the 'real' table? We are naturally tempted to say that what we see through the microscope is more real, but that in turn would be changed by a still more powerful microscope. If, then, we cannot trust what we see with the naked eye, why should we trust what we see through a microscope? Thus, again, the confidence in our senses with which we began deserts us.\nThe shape of the table is no better. We are all in the habit of judging as to the 'real' shapes of things, and we do this so unreflectingly that we think we actually see the real shapes. But, in fact, as we all have to learn if we try to draw, a given thing looks different in shape from every different point of view. If our table is 'really' rectangular, it will look, from almost all points of view, as if it had two acute angles and two obtuse angles. If opposite sides are parallel, they will look as if they converged to a point away in the perspective; if they are of equal length, they will look as if the nearer side were longer. All these things are not commonly noticed in looking at a table, because experience has taught us to construct the 'real' shape from the apparent shape, and the 'real' shape is what interests us as practical men. But the 'real' shape is not what we see; it is something inferred from what we see. And what we see is constantly changing in shape as we move about the room; so that here again the senses seem not to give us the truth about the table itself, but only about the appearance of the table.\nSimilar difficulties arise when we consider the sense of touch. It is true that the table always gives us a sensation of hardness, and we feel that it resists pressure. But the sensation we obtain depends upon how hard we press the table and also upon what part of the body we press against it; thus the various sensations due to various pressures or various parts of the body cannot be supposed to reveal _directly_ any definite property of the table, but at most to be _signs_ of some property which perhaps _causes_ all the sensations, but is not actually apparent in any of them. And the same applies still more obviously to the sounds which can be elicited by rapping the table.\nThus it becomes evident that the real table, if there is one, is not the same as what we immediately experience by sight or touch or hearing. The real table, if there is one, is not _immediately_ known to us at all, but must be an inference from what is immediately known. Hence, two very difficult questions at once arise; namely, (1) Is there a real table at all? (2) If so, what sort of object can it be?\nIt will help us in considering these questions to have a few simple terms of which the meaning is definite and clear. Let us give the name of 'sense-data' to the things that are immediately known in sensation: such things as colours, sounds, smells, hardnesses, roughnesses, and so on. We shall give the name 'sensation' to the experience of being immediately aware of these things. Thus, whenever we see a colour, we have a sensation of the colour, but the colour itself is a sense-datum, not a sensation. The colour is that of which we are immediately aware, and the awareness itself is the sensation. It is plain that if we are to know anything about the table, it must be by means of the sense-data\u2014brown colour, oblong shape, smoothness, etc.\u2014which we associate with the table; but, for the reasons which have been given, we cannot say that the table is the sense-data, or even that the sense-data are directly properties of the table. Thus a problem arises as to the relation of the sense-data to the real table, supposing there is such a thing.\nThe real table, if it exists, we will call a 'physical object'. Physics is the study of the properties of physical objects. Thus our two questions may be re-stated as follows: (1) Is there any such thing as matter? (2) If so, what is its nature?\nThe philosopher who first brought prominently forward the reasons for regarding the immediate objects of our senses as not existing independently of us was Bishop Berkeley (1685-1753). His _Three Dialogues between Hylas and Philonous, in Opposition to Sceptics and Atheists_, undertake to prove that there is no such thing as matter at all, and that the world consists of nothing but minds and their ideas. Hylas has hitherto believed in matter, but he is no match for Philonous, who mercilessly drives him into contradictions and paradoxes, and makes his own denial of matter seem, in the end, as if it were almost common sense. The arguments employed are of very different value: some are important and sound, others are confused or quibbling. But Berkeley retains the merit of having shown that the existence of matter is capable of being denied without absurdity, and that if there are any things that exist independently of us they cannot be the immediate objects of our sensations.\nThere are two different questions involved when we ask whether matter exists, and it is important to keep them clear. We commonly mean by 'matter' something which is opposed to 'mind', something which we think of as occupying space and as radically incapable of any sort of thought or consciousness. It is chiefly in this sense that Berkeley denies matter; that is to say, he does not deny that the sense-data which we commonly take as signs of the existence of the table are really signs of the existence of _something_ independent of us, but he does deny that this something is non-mental, that it is neither mind nor ideas entertained by some mind. He admits that there must be something which continues to exist when we go out of the room or shut our eyes, and that what we call seeing the table does give us reason for believing in something which persists even when we are not seeing it. But he thinks that this something cannot be radically different in nature from what we see, and cannot be independent of seeing altogether, though it must be independent of _our_ seeing. He is thus led to regard the 'real' table as an idea in the mind of God. Such an idea has the required permanence and independence of ourselves, without being\u2014as matter is otherwise supposed to be\u2014something quite unknowable, in the sense that we can only infer it, and can never be directly and immediately aware of it.\nOther philosophers since Berkeley have also held that, although the table does not depend for its existence upon being seen by me, it does depend upon being seen (or otherwise apprehended in sensation) by _some_ mind\u2014not necessarily the mind of God, but more often the whole collective mind of the universe. This they hold, as Berkeley does, chiefly because they think there can be nothing real\u2014or at any rate nothing known to be real\u2014except minds and their thoughts and feelings. We might state the argument by which they support their view in some such way as this: 'Whatever can be thought of is an idea in the mind of the person thinking of it; therefore nothing can be thought of except ideas in minds; therefore anything else is inconceivable, and what is inconceivable cannot exist.' Such an argument, in my opinion, is fallacious; and of course those who advance it do not put it so shortly or so crudely. But whether valid or not, the argument has been very widely advanced in one form or another; and very many philosophers, perhaps a majority, have held that there is nothing real except minds and their ideas. Such philosophers are called 'idealists'. When they come to explaining matter, they either say, like Berkeley, that matter is really nothing but a collection of ideas, or they say, like Leibniz (1646-1716), that what appears as matter is really a collection of more or less rudimentary minds.\nBut these philosophers, though they deny matter as opposed to mind, nevertheless, in another sense, admit matter. It will be remembered that we asked two questions; namely, (1) Is there a real table at all? (2) If so, what sort of object can it be? Now both Berkeley and Leibniz admit that there is a real table, but Berkeley says it is certain ideas in the mind of God, and Leibniz says it is a colony of souls. Thus both of them answer our first question in the affirmative, and only diverge from the views of ordinary mortals on our second question. In fact, almost all philosophers seem to be agreed that there is a real table: they almost all agree that, however much our sense-data may depend upon us, yet their occurrence is a sign of something existing independently of us, something differing, perhaps, completely from our sense-data, and yet to be regarded as the cause of those sense-data whenever we are in a suitable relation to the real table.\nNow obviously this point in which the philosophers are agreed\u2014the view that there _is_ a real table, whatever its nature may be\u2014is of vital importance, and it will be worth while to consider what reasons there are for accepting this view before we go on to the further question as to the nature of the real table. Our next chapter, therefore, will be concerned with the reasons for supposing that there is a real table at all.\nBefore we go farther it will be well to consider for a moment what it is that we have discovered so far. It has appeared that, if we take any common object of the sort that is supposed to be known by the senses, what the senses _immediately_ tell us is not the truth about the object as it is apart from us, but only the truth about certain sense-data which, so far as we can see, depend upon the relations between us and the object. Thus what we directly see and feel is merely 'appearance', which we believe to be a sign of some 'reality' behind. But if the reality is not what appears, have we any means of knowing whether there is any reality at all? And if so, have we any means of finding out what it is like?\nSuch questions are bewildering, and it is difficult to know that even the strangest hypotheses may not be true. Thus our familiar table, which has roused but the slightest thoughts in us hitherto, has become a problem full of surprising possibilities. The one thing we know about it is that it is not what it seems. Beyond this modest result, so far, we have the most complete liberty of conjecture. Leibniz tells us it is a community of souls: Berkeley tells us it is an idea in the mind of God; sober science, scarcely less wonderful, tells us it is a vast collection of electric charges in violent motion.\nAmong these surprising possibilities, doubt suggests that perhaps there is no table at all. Philosophy, if it cannot _answer_ so many questions as we could wish, has at least the power of asking questions which increase the interest of the world, and show the strangeness and wonder lying just below the surface even in the commonest things of daily life.", "source": "problems_of_philosophy.txt"}
{"text": "CHAPTER I. THE SERIES OF NATURAL NUMBERS\nMathematics is a study which, when we start from its most familiar portions, may be pursued in either of two opposite directions. The more familiar direction is constructive, towards gradually increasing complexity: from integers to fractions, real numbers, complex numbers; from addition and multiplication to differentiation and integration, and on to higher mathematics. The other direction, which is less familiar, proceeds, by analysing, to greater and greater abstractness and logical simplicity; instead of asking what can be defined and deduced from what is assumed to begin with, we ask instead what more general ideas and principles can be found, in terms of which our starting-point can be defined or deduced. It is the fact of pursuing this opposite direction that characterises mathematical philosophy as opposed to ordinary mathematics. But it should be understood that the distinction is one, not in the subject matter, but in the state of mind of the investigator. Early Greek geometers, passing from the empirical rules of Egyptian land-surveying to the general propositions by which those rules were found to be justifiable, and thence to Euclid's axioms and postulates, were engaged in mathematical philosophy, according to the above definition; but when they had reached the axioms and postulates, they had only reached the beginning of \"mathematics\" in the ordinary sense. The distinction is similar to that between the study of language and the study of grammar.\nThe most obvious and easy things in mathematics are not those that come logically at the beginning; they are things that, from the point of view of logical deduction, come somewhere in the middle. Just as the easiest bodies to see are those that are neither very near nor very far, neither very small nor very great, so the easiest conceptions to grasp are those that are neither very complex nor very simple (using \"simple\" in a logical sense). And as we need two sorts of instruments, the telescope and the microscope, for the enlargement of our visual powers, so we need two sorts of instruments for the enlargement of our logical powers, one to take us forward to the higher mathematics, the other to take us backward to logical foundations. We shall be concerned in this book with the latter task.\nWe have spoken of \"the series of natural numbers.\" The sequence of numbers 1, 2, 3, 4, ... is the most familiar of all mathematical things. But it is by no means easy to say what these numbers are, or to say what is meant by \"series\" or by \"natural.\" To answer these questions is one of the main objects of mathematical philosophy.\nIt is customary to define the natural numbers as the numbers used in counting. But counting is by no means a simple operation. It involves a one-one relation between the set of objects counted and the set of numbers used in counting. It is thus a special case of a more general conception, that of similarity between classes. Two classes are said to be \"similar\" when there is a one-one relation which correlates the terms of the one class each with one term of the other class, and vice versa. For example, if you are a polygamist, your wives and your mothers-in-law are similar classes. (The relation of husband and wife is one-one, assuming monogamy on the wife's part.)\nLogic, in the sense of mathematical logic, is the basis of all this. The logic which I shall advocate is one which treats numbers as classes of classes. This may seem a very odd definition, but we shall see that it works.\nThe fundamental logical concept which we shall use is that of a \"class.\" Logic is concerned with classes, and with relations between classes.", "source": "introduction_to_mathematical_philosophy.txt"}
