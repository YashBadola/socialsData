OF IDLENESS.

As we see some grounds that have long lain idle and untilled, when grown
rich and fertile by rest, to abound with and spend their virtue in the
product of innumerable sorts of wild herbs and unprofitable weeds, and
that to make them perform their true office we must cultivate and
prepare them for such seeds as are proper for our service; and as we see
women that without knowledge of man do sometimes of themselves bring
forth inanimate and formless lumps of flesh, but that to cause a natural
and perfect generation they are to be husbanded with another kind of
seed: even so it is with minds, which if not applied to some certain
study that may fix and restrain them, run into a thousand extravagances,
eternally roving here and there in the vague expanse of the imagination--

          "Sicut aquae tremulum labris ubi lumen ahenis
          Sole repercussum, aut radiantis imagine lunae,
          Omnia pervolitat late loca, jamque sub auras
          Erigitur, summique ferit laquearia tecti."

          ["As when in brazen vats of water the trembling light,
          reflected from the sun, or from the image of the radiant
          moon, flits far and wide over everything, and mounts to the
          upper air, and strikes the ceiling of the roof."
          --AEneid, viii. 22.]

--in which wild agitation there is no folly or idle fancy they do not
light upon:

          "Velut aegri somnia, vanae
          Finguntur species."

          ["Like a sick man's dreams, creating vain phantasms."
          --Hor., De Art. Poet., 7.]

The soul that has no established aim loses itself, for, as it is said, he
who lives everywhere lives nowhere.

          "Quisquis ubique habitat, Maxime, nusquam habitat."

          ["He who lives everywhere, Maximus, lives nowhere."
          --Martial, vii. 73.]

When I lately retired to my own house, with a resolution, as much as
possibly I could, to avoid all manner of concern in those affairs, and
to spend in privacy and repose the little remainder of time I have to
live, I fancied I could not more oblige my mind than to suffer it at
full leisure to entertain and divert itself, which I now hoped it might
the better be entrusted to do, as being by time and age settled and
matured; but I find--

          "Variam semper dant otia mentem,"

          ["Leisure ever creates varied thought."--Lucan, iv. 704]

--that, quite contrary, it is like a horse that has broke from his rider,
who voluntarily runs into a much more violent career than any horseman
would put him to, and creates me so many chimeras and fantastic monsters,
one upon another, without order or purpose, that to contemplate their
strangeness and ineptitude, I have begun a register of them, which I
trust shall one day make him ashamed of himself.


OF LIARS.

There is not a man living whom it would so little become to speak from
memory as myself, for I have scarcely any at all, and do not think that
the world has another so marvelous as mine. My other faculties are all
very ordinary and mean; but in this I think myself very rare and singular,
and worthy to be remarked. Besides the natural defect which I have of it,
I have as much as I can, for lack of use, suffered it to decay.

If a man have a good memory, he will often find himself at a loss in
telling a story; for the memory being the receptacle and sheath of all
science, mine being so brittle, if I were not a man of very good invention,
I should certainly be a very ignorant fellow.

It is not without reason said, that he who has not a good memory should
never take upon him the trade of lying. I know very well that the
grammarians distinguish betwixt an untruth and a lie, and say that to
tell an untruth is to tell a thing that is false, but that we ourselves
believe to be true; and that the definition of the word to lie in Latin,
from which our French is taken, is to tell a thing which we know in our
conscience to be false; and it is of this last sort of liars only that
I speak. Now, these do either wholly contrive and invent the untruths
they utter, or so alter and disguise a true story that it ends in a lie.
When they disguise and alter a truth, if they are often put to the
repetition of the same story, they can hardly avoid passing their own
memory, which is the reason that they are so often trapped; for the
thing being fully imprinted in the memory, and the invention being
only the product of the imagination, it is very difficult that the
memory should not get the better of the imagination.

OF THE EDUCATION OF CHILDREN.

To Madame Diane de Foix, Comtesse de Gurson.

I never yet saw that father, but let his son be never so decrepit or
deformed, would not, notwithstanding, own him: not, nevertheless, if he
were not totally besotted, and blinded with his paternal affection, that
he did not well enough discern his defects: but that with all these
qualities he was still his. And I myself, who have no other issue to
leave, would be very glad that what I shall leave should be returned to
me. The best and most fruitful natural parts are those that are the
soonest and most plentifully produced; and as we see that the strongest
plants are those that have the deepest roots, so it is with children;
and if they are not planted in a good soil, and have not a good gardener,
they will bring forth nothing but weeds.

For a child of a good house, who seeks letters not for the gain (for such
an object as that is unworthy of the grace and favour of the Muses, and
moreover, in it a man subscribes to and serves others), nor so much for
external advantages as for his own particular contentment, and to enrich
and fortify himself within, having rather a desire to come out an
accomplished cavalier than a mere scholar or man of learning; for such a
one, I say, I would also have his friends solicitous to find him out a
tutor, who has rather a well-made than a well-filled head; seeking,
indeed, both the one and the other, but rather of the two to prefer
manners and judgment to mere learning, and that this man should exercise
his charge after a new method.

'Tis the custom of pedagogues to be eternally thundering in their pupil's
ears, as they were pouring into a funnel, whilst the business of the
pupil is only to repeat what the others have said: now I would have a
tutor to correct this error, and, that at the very first, he should
according to the capacity he has to deal with, put it to the test,
permitting his pupil himself to taste things, and of himself to discern
and choose them, sometimes opening the way to him, and sometimes leaving
him to open it for himself; that is, I would not have him alone to
invent and speak, but that he should also hear his pupil speak in turn.
Socrates, and since him Arcesilaus, made first their scholars speak, and
then they spoke to them.

          "Obest plerumque iis, qui discere volunt,
          auctoritas eorum, qui docent."

          ["The authority of those who teach is very often an impediment
          to those who desire to learn."--Cicero, De Nat. Deor., i. 5.]

It is good that he should have him trot before him, to judge the pace of
his horse, and to judge how long he must hold him back.
