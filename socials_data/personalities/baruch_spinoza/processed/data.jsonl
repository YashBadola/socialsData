(2) The human mind is readily swayed this way\nor that in times of doubt, especially when hope and fear are struggling for\nthe mastery, though usually it is boastful, over - confident, and vain.\n(3) This as a general fact I suppose everyone knows, though few, I believe,\nknow their own nature; no one can have lived in the world without observing\nthat most people, when in prosperity, are so over-brimming with wisdom\n(however inexperienced they may be), that they take every offer of advice as\na personal insult, whereas in adversity they know not where to turn, but beg\nand pray for counsel from every passer-by. (4) No plan is then too futile,\ntoo absurd, or too fatuous for their adoption; the most frivolous causes\nwill raise them to hope, or plunge them into despair - if anything happens\nduring their fright which reminds them of some past good or ill, they think\nit portends a happy or unhappy issue, and therefore (though it may have\nproved abortive a hundred times before) style it a lucky or unlucky omen.\n(5) Anything which excites their astonishment they believe to be a portent\nsignifying the anger of the gods or of the Supreme Being, and, mistaking\nsuperstition for religion, account it impious not to avert the evil with\nprayer and sacrifice. (6) Signs and wonders of this sort they conjure up\nperpetually, till one might think Nature as mad as themselves, they\ninterpret her so fantastically.\n(7) Thus it is brought prominently before us, that superstition's chief\nvictims are those persons who greedily covet temporal advantages; they it\nis, who (especially when they are in danger, and cannot help themselves) are\nwont with Prayers and womanish tears to implore help from God: upbraiding\nReason as blind, because she cannot show a sure path to the shadows they\npursue, and rejecting human wisdom as vain; but believing the phantoms of\nimagination, dreams, and other childish absurdities, to be the very oracles\nof Heaven. (8) As though God had turned away from the wise, and written His\ndecrees, not in the mind of man but in the entrails of beasts, or left them\nto be proclaimed by the inspiration and instinct of fools, madmen, and\nbirds. Such is the unreason to which terror can drive mankind!\n(9) Superstition, then, is engendered, preserved, and fostered by fear. If\nanyone desire an example, let him take Alexander, who only began\nsuperstitiously to seek guidance from seers, when he first learnt to fear\nfortune in the passes of Sysis (Curtius, v. 4); whereas after he had\nconquered Darius he consulted prophets no more, till a second time\nfrightened by reverses. (10) When the Scythians were provoking a battle, the\nBactrians had deserted, and he himself was lying sick of his wounds, \"he\nonce more turned to superstition, the mockery of human wisdom, and bade\nAristander, to whom he confided his credulity, inquire the issue of affairs\nwith sacrificed victims.\" (11) Very numerous examples of a like nature might\nbe cited, clearly showing the fact, that only while under the dominion of\nfear do men fall a prey to superstition; that all the portents ever invested\nwith the reverence of misguided religion are mere phantoms of dejected and\nfearful minds; and lastly, that prophets have most power among the people,\nand are most formidable to rulers, precisely at those times when the state\nis in most peril. (12) I think this is sufficiently plain to all, and will\ntherefore say no more on the subject.\n(13) The origin of superstition above given affords us a clear reason for\nthe fact, that it comes to all men naturally, though some refer its rise to\na dim notion of God, universal to mankind, and also tends to show, that it\nis no less inconsistent and variable than other mental hallucinations and\nemotional impulses, and further that it can only be maintained by hope,\nhatred, anger, and deceit; since it springs, not from reason, but solely\nfrom the more powerful phases of emotion. (14) Furthermore, we may readily\nunderstand how difficult it is, to maintain in the same course men prone to\nevery form of credulity. (15) For, as the mass of mankind remains always at\nabout the same pitch of misery, it never assents long to any one remedy, but\nis always best pleased by a novelty which has not yet proved illusive.\n(16) This element of inconsistency has been the cause of many terrible wars\nand revolutions; for, as Curtius well says (lib. iv. chap. 10): \"The mob has\nno ruler more potent than superstition,\" and is easily led, on the plea of\nreligion, at one moment to adore its kings as gods, and anon to execrate and\nabjure them as humanity's common bane. (17) Immense pains have therefore\nbeen taken to counteract this evil by investing religion, whether true or\nfalse, with such pomp and ceremony, that it may rise superior to every\nshock, and be always observed with studious reverence by the whole people--a\nsystem which has been brought to great perfection by the Turks, for they\nconsider even controversy impious, and so clog men's minds with dogmatic\nformulas, that they leave no room for sound reason, not even enough to doubt\nwith.\n(18) But if, in despotic statecraft, the supreme and essential mystery be to\nhoodwink the subjects, and to mask the fear, which keeps them clown, with\nthe specious garb of religion, so that men may fight as bravely for slavery\nas for safety, and count it not shame but highest honour to risk their blood\nand their lives for the vainglory of a tyrant; yet in a free state no more\nmischievous expedient could be planned or attempted. (19) Wholly repugnant\nto the general freedom are such devices as enthralling men's minds with\nprejudices, forcing their judgment, or employing any of the weapons of\nquasi-religious sedition; indeed, such seditions only spring up, when law\nenters the domain of speculative thought, and opinions are put on trial and\ncondemned on the same footing as crimes, while those who defend and follow\nthem are sacrificed, not to public safety, but to their opponents'\nhatred and cruelty. (20) If deeds only could be made the grounds of\ncriminal charges, and words were always allowed to pass free, such seditions\nwould be divested of every semblance of justification, and would be\nseparated from mere controversies by a hard and fast line.\n(20) Now, seeing that we have the rare happiness of living in a republic,\nwhere everyone's judgment is free and unshackled, where each may worship God\nas his conscience dictates, and where freedom is esteemed before all things\ndear and precious, I have believed that I should be undertaking no\nungrateful or unprofitable task, in demonstrating that not only can\nsuch freedom be granted without prejudice to the public peace, but also,\nthat without such freedom, piety cannot flourish nor the public peace be\nsecure.\n(21) Such is the chief conclusion I seek to establish in this treatise; but,\nin order to reach it, I must first point out the misconceptions which, like\nscars of our former bondage, still disfigure our notion of religion, and\nmust expose the false views about the civil authority which many have most\nimpudently advocated, endeavouring to turn the mind of the people, still\nprone to heathen superstition, away from its legitimate rulers, and so bring\nus again into slavery. (22) As to the order of my treatise I will speak\npresently, but first I will recount the causes which led me to write.\n(23) I have often wondered, that persons who make a boast of professing the\nChristian religion, namely, love, joy, peace, temperance, and charity to all\nmen, should quarrel with such rancorous animosity, and display daily towards\none another such bitter hatred, that this, rather than the virtues they\nclaim, is the readiest criterion of their faith. (24) Matters have long\nsince come to such a pass, that one can only pronounce a man Christian,\nTurk, Jew, or Heathen, by his general appearance and attire, by his\nfrequenting this or that place of worship, or employing the phraseology of a\nparticular sect - as for manner of life, it is in all cases the same. (25)\nInquiry into the cause of this anomaly leads me unhesitatingly to ascribe it\nto the fact, that the ministries of the Church are regarded by the masses\nmerely as dignities, her offices as posts of emolument - in short, popular\nreligion may be summed up as respect for ecclesiastics. (26) The spread of\nthis misconception inflamed every worthless fellow with an intense desire to\nenter holy orders, and thus the love of diffusing God's religion degenerated\ninto sordid avarice and ambition. (27) Every church became a theatre, where\norators, instead of church teachers, harangued, caring not to instruct the\npeople, but striving to attract admiration, to bring opponents to public\nscorn, and to preach only novelties and paradoxes, such as would tickle\nthe ears of their congregation. (28) This state of things necessarily\nstirred up an amount of controversy, envy, and hatred, which no lapse of\ntime could appease; so that we can scarcely wonder that of the old religion\nnothing survives but its outward forms (even these, in the mouth of the\nmultitude, seem rather adulation than adoration of the Deity), and that\nfaith has become a mere compound of credulity and prejudices - aye,\nprejudices too, which degrade man from rational being to beast, which\ncompletely stifle the power of judgment between true and false, which seem,\nin fact, carefully fostered for the purpose of extinguishing the last spark\nof reason! (29) Piety, great God! and religion are become a tissue of\nridiculous mysteries; men, who flatly despise reason, who reject and turn\naway from understanding as naturally corrupt, these, I say, these of all\nmen, are thought, O lie most horrible! to possess light from on High. (30)\nVerily, if they had but one spark of light from on High, they would not\ninsolently rave, but would learn to worship God more wisely, and would be as\nmarked among their fellows for mercy as they now are for malice; if they\nwere concerned for their opponents' souls, instead of for their own\nreputations, they would no longer fiercely persecute, but rather be filled\nwith pity and compassion.\n(31) Furthermore, if any Divine light were in them, it would appear from\ntheir doctrine. (32) I grant that they are never tired of professing their\nwonder at the profound mysteries of Holy Writ; still I cannot discover that\nthey teach anything but speculations of Platonists and Aristotelians, to\nwhich (in order to save their credit for Christianity) they have made Holy\nWrit conform; not content to rave with the Greeks themselves, they want to\nmake the prophets rave also; showing conclusively, that never even in sleep\nhave they caught a glimpse of Scripture's Divine nature. (33) The very\nvehemence of their admiration for the mysteries plainly attests, that\ntheir belief in the Bible is a formal assent rather than a living faith: and\nthe fact is made still more apparent by their laying down beforehand, as a\nfoundation for the study and true interpretation of Scripture, the principle\nthat it is in every passage true and divine. (34) Such a doctrine should be\nreached only after strict scrutiny and thorough comprehension of the Sacred\nBooks (which would teach it much better, for they stand in need no human\nfactions), and not be set up on the threshold, as it were, of inquiry.\n(35) As I pondered over the facts that the light of reason is not only\ndespised, but by many even execrated as a source of impiety, that human\ncommentaries are accepted as divine records, and that credulity is extolled\nas faith; as I marked the fierce controversies of philosophers raging in\nChurch and State, the source of bitter hatred and dissension, the ready\ninstruments of sedition and other ills innumerable, I determined to examine\nthe Bible afresh in a careful, impartial, and unfettered spirit, making no\nassumptions concerning it, and attributing to it no doctrines, which I do\nnot find clearly therein set down. (36) With these precautions I constructed\na method of Scriptural interpretation, and thus equipped proceeded to\ninquire - what is prophecy? (37) In what sense did God reveal himself to the\nprophets, and why were these particular men - chosen by him? (38) Was it on\naccount of the sublimity of their thoughts about the Deity and nature, or\nwas it solely on account of their piety? (39) These questions being\nanswered, I was easily able to conclude, that the authority of the prophets\nhas weight only in matters of morality, and that their speculative doctrines\naffect us little.\n(40) Next I inquired, why the Hebrews were called God's chosen people,\nand discovering that it was only because God had chosen for them a\ncertain strip of territory, where they might live peaceably and at\nease, I learnt that the Law revealed by God to Moses was merely the law\nof the individual Hebrew state, therefore that it was binding on none\nbut Hebrews, and not even on Hebrews after the downfall of their\nnation. (41) Further, in order to ascertain, whether it could be\nconcluded from Scripture, that the human understanding is naturally\ncorrupt, I inquired whether the Universal Religion, the Divine Law\nrevealed through the Prophets and Apostles to the whole human race,\ndiffers from that which is taught by the light of natural reason,\nwhether miracles can take place in violation of the laws of nature, and\nif so, whether they imply the existence of God more surely and clearly\nthan events, which we understand plainly and distinctly through their\nimmediate natural causes.\n(42) Now, as in the whole course of my investigation I found nothing taught\nexpressly by Scripture, which does not agree with our understanding, or\nwhich is repugnant thereto, and as I saw that the prophets taught nothing,\nwhich is not very simple and easily to be grasped by all, and further, that\nthey clothed their teaching in the style, and confirmed it with the reasons,\nwhich would most deeply move the mind of the masses to devotion towards God,\nI became thoroughly convinced, that the Bible leaves reason absolutely free,\nthat it has nothing in common with philosophy, in fact, that Revelation and\nPhilosophy stand on different footings. In order to set this forth\ncategorically and exhaust the whole question, I point out the way in which\nthe Bible should be interpreted, and show that all of spiritual questions\nshould be sought from it alone, and not from the objects of ordinary\nknowledge. (43) Thence I pass on to indicate the false notions, which have\nfrom the fact that the multitude - ever prone to superstition, and caring\nmore for the shreds of antiquity for eternal truths - pays homage to the\nBooks of the Bible, rather than to the Word of God. (44) I show that the\nWord of God has not been revealed as a certain number of books, was\ndisplayed to the prophets as a simple idea of the mind, namely, obedience to\nGod in singleness of heart, and in the practice of justice and charity; and\nI further point out, that this doctrine is set forth in Scripture in\naccordance with the opinions and understandings of those, among whom the\nApostles and Prophets preached, to the end that men might receive it\nwillingly, and with their whole heart.\n(45) Having thus laid bare the bases of belief, I draw the conclusion that\nRevelation has obedience for its sole object, therefore, in purpose no less\nthan in foundation and method, stands entirely aloof from ordinary\nknowledge; each has its separate province, neither can be called the\nhandmaid of the other.\n(46) Furthermore, as men's habits of mind differ, so that some more readily\nembrace one form of faith, some another, for what moves one to pray may move\nanother only to scoff, I conclude, in accordance with what has gone before,\nthat everyone should be free to choose for himself the foundations of his\ncreed, and that faith should be judged only by its fruits; each would then\nobey God freely with his whole heart, while nothing would be publicly\nhonoured save justice and charity.\n(47) Having thus drawn attention to the liberty conceded to everyone by the\nrevealed law of God, I pass on to another part of my subject, and prove that\nthis same liberty can and should be accorded with safety to the state and\nthe magisterial authority - in fact, that it cannot be withheld without\ngreat danger to peace and detriment to the community.\n(48) In order to establish my point, I start from the natural rights of the\nindividual, which are co-extensive with his desires and power, and from the\nfact that no one is bound to live as another pleases, but is the guardian of\nhis own liberty. (49) I show that these rights can only be transferred to\nthose whom we depute to defend us, who acquire with the duties of defence\nthe power of ordering our lives, and I thence infer that rulers possess\nrights only limited by their power, that they are the sole guardians of\njustice and liberty, and that their subjects should act in all things as\nthey dictate: nevertheless, since no one can so utterly abdicate his own\npower of self-defence as to cease to be a man, I conclude that no one can be\ndeprived of his natural rights absolutely, but that subjects, either by\ntacit agreement, or by social contract, retain a certain number, which\ncannot be taken from them without great danger to the state.\n(50) From these considerations I pass on to the Hebrew State, which I\ndescribe at some length, in order to trace the manner in which Religion\nacquired the force of law, and to touch on other noteworthy points. (51) I\nthen prove, that the holders of sovereign power are the depositories and\ninterpreters of religious no less than of civil ordinances, and that they\nalone have the right to decide what is just or unjust, pious or impious;\nlastly, I conclude by showing, that they best retain this right and secure\nsafety to their state by allowing every man to think what he likes, and say\nwhat he thinks.\n(52) Such, Philosophical Reader, are the questions I submit to your notice,\ncounting on your approval, for the subject matter of the whole book and of\nthe several chapters is important and profitable. (53) I would say more, but\nI do not want my preface to extend to a volume, especially as I know that\nits leading propositions are to Philosophers but common places. (54) To the\nrest of mankind I care not to commend my treatise, for I cannot expect that\nit contains anything to please them: I know how deeply rooted are the\nprejudices embraced under the name of religion; I am aware that in the mind\nof the masses superstition is no less deeply rooted than fear; I recognize\nthat their constancy is mere obstinacy, and that they are led to praise or\nblame by impulse rather than reason. (55) Therefore the multitude, and those\nof like passions with the multitude, I ask not to read my book; nay, I would\nrather that they should utterly neglect it, than that they should\nmisinterpret it after their wont. (56) They would gain no good themselves,\nand might prove a stumbling-block to others, whose philosophy is hampered by\nthe belief that Reason is a mere handmaid to Theology, and whom I seek in\nthis work especially to benefit. (57) But as there will be many who have\nneither the leisure, nor, perhaps, the inclination to read through all I\nhave written, I feel bound here, as at the end of my treatise, to declare\nthat I have written nothing, which I do not most willingly submit to the\nexamination and judgment of my country's rulers, and that I am ready to\nretract anything, which they shall decide to be repugnant to the laws or\nprejudicial to the public good. (58) I know that I am a man and, as a\nman, liable to error, but against error I have taken scrupulous care, and\nstriven to keep in entire accordance with the laws of my country, with\nloyalty, and with morality.\nCHAPTER I. - Of Prophecy\n(1) Prophecy, or revelation is sure knowledge revealed by God to man.\n(2) A prophet is one who interprets the revelations of God to those who\nare unable to attain to sure knowledge of the matters revealed, and\ntherefore can only apprehend them by simple faith.\n(3) The Hebrew word for prophet is \"_nabi_,\"[Endnote 1] i.e. speaker or\ninterpreter, but in Scripture its meaning is restricted to interpreter\nof God, as we may learn from Exodus vii:1, where God says to Moses,\n\"See, I have made thee a god to Pharaoh, and Aaron thy brother shall be\nthy prophet;\" implying that, since in interpreting Moses' words to\nPharaoh, Aaron acted the part of a prophet, Moses would be to Pharaoh\nas a god, or in the attitude of a god.\n(4) Prophets I will treat of in the next chapter, and at present consider\nprophecy.\n(5) Now it is evident, from the definition above given, that prophecy really\nincludes ordinary knowledge; for the knowledge which we acquire by our\nnatural faculties depends on knowledge of God and His eternal laws; but\nordinary knowledge is common to all men as men, and rests on foundations\nwhich all share, whereas the multitude always strains after rarities\nand exceptions, and thinks little of the gifts of nature; so that, when\nprophecy is talked of, ordinary knowledge is not supposed to be included.\n(6) Nevertheless it has as much right as any other to be called Divine, for\nGod's nature, in so far as we share therein, and God's laws, dictate it to\nus; nor does it suffer from that to which we give the preeminence, except in\nso far as the latter transcends its limits and cannot be accounted for by\nnatural laws taken in themselves. (7) In respect to the certainty it\ninvolves, and the source from which it is derived, i.e. God, ordinary\nknowledge is no whit inferior to prophetic, unless indeed we believe, or\nrather dream, that the prophets had human bodies but superhuman minds, and\ntherefore that their sensations and consciousness were entirely different\nfrom our own.\n(8) But, although ordinary knowledge is Divine, its professors cannot be\ncalled prophets [Endnote 2], for they teach what the rest of mankind could\nperceive and apprehend, not merely by simple faith, but as surely and\nhonourably as themselves.\n(9) Seeing then that our mind subjectively contains in itself and partakes\nof the nature of God, and solely from this cause is enabled to form notions\nexplaining natural phenomena and inculcating morality, it follows that we\nmay rightly assert the nature of the human mind (in so far as it is thus\nconceived) to be a primary cause of Divine revelation. (10) All that we\nclearly and distinctly understand is dictated to us, as I have just pointed\nout, by the idea and nature of God; not indeed through words, but in a way\nfar more excellent and agreeing perfectly with the nature of the mind, as\nall who have enjoyed intellectual certainty will doubtless attest. (11)\nHere, however, my chief purpose is to speak of matters having reference to\nScripture, so these few words on the light of reason will suffice.\n(12) I will now pass on to, and treat more fully, the other ways and means\nby which God makes revelations to mankind, both of that which transcends\nordinary knowledge, and of that within its scope; for there is no reason why\nGod should not employ other means to communicate what we know already by the\npower of reason.\n(13) Our conclusions on the subject must be drawn solely from Scripture; for\nwhat can we affirm about matters transcending our knowledge except what is\ntold us by the words or writings of prophets? (14) And since there are, so\nfar as I know, no prophets now alive, we have no alternative but to read the\nbooks of prophets departed, taking care the while not to reason from\nmetaphor or to ascribe anything to our authors which they do not themselves\ndistinctly state. (15) I must further premise that the Jews never make any\nmention or account of secondary, or particular causes, but in a spirit of\nreligion, piety, and what is commonly called godliness, refer all things\ndirectly to the Deity. (16) For instance if they make money by a\ntransaction, they say God gave it to them; if they desire anything, they say\nGod has disposed their hearts towards it; if they think anything, they say\nGod told them. (17) Hence we must not suppose that everything is prophecy or\nrevelation which is described in Scripture as told by God to anyone, but\nonly such things as are expressly announced as prophecy or revelation, or\nare plainly pointed to as such by the context.\n(18) A perusal of the sacred books will show us that all God's revelations\nto the prophets were made through words or appearances, or a combination of\nthe two. (19) These words and appearances were of two kinds; 1.- real when\nexternal to the mind of the prophet who heard or saw them, 2.- imaginary\nwhen the imagination of the prophet was in a state which led him distinctly\nto suppose that he heard or saw them.\n(20) With a real voice God revealed to Moses the laws which He wished to be\ntransmitted to the Hebrews, as we may see from Exodus xxv:22, where God\nsays, \"And there I will meet with thee and I will commune with thee from the\nmercy seat which is between the Cherubim.\" (21) Some sort of real voice must\nnecessarily have been employed, for Moses found God ready to commune with\nhim at any time. This, as I shall shortly show, is the only instance of a\nreal voice.\n(22) We might, perhaps, suppose that the voice with which God called Samuel\nwas real, for in 1 Sam. iii:21, we read, \"And the Lord appeared again in\nShiloh, for the Lord revealed Himself to Samuel in Shiloh by the word of the\nLord;\" implying that the appearance of the Lord consisted in His making\nHimself known to Samuel through a voice; in other words, that Samuel heard\nthe Lord speaking. (23) But we are compelled to distinguish between the\nprophecies of Moses and those of other prophets, and therefore must decide\nthat this voice was imaginary, a conclusion further supported by the voice's\nresemblance to the voice of Eli, which Samuel was in the habit of hearing,\nand therefore might easily imagine; when thrice called by the Lord, Samuel\nsupposed it to have been Eli.\n(24) The voice which Abimelech heard was imaginary, for it is written,\nGen. xx:6, \"And God said unto him in a dream.\" (25) So that the will of God\nwas manifest to him, not in waking, but only in sleep, that is, when the\nimagination is most active and uncontrolled. (26) Some of the Jews believe\nthat the actual words of the Decalogue were not spoken by God, but that the\nIsraelites heard a noise only, without any distinct words, and during its\ncontinuance apprehended the Ten Commandments by pure intuition; to this\nopinion I myself once inclined, seeing that the words of the Decalogue in\nExodus are different from the words of the Decalogue in Deuteronomy, for the\ndiscrepancy seemed to imply (since God only spoke once) that the Ten\nCommandments were not intended to convey the actual words of the Lord, but\nonly His meaning. (27) However, unless we would do violence to Scripture, we\nmust certainly admit that the Israelites heard a real voice, for Scripture\nexpressly says, Deut. v:4, \"God spake with you face to face,\" i.e. as two\nmen ordinarily interchange ideas through the instrumentality of their two\nbodies; and therefore it seems more consonant with Holy Writ to suppose that\nGod really did create a voice of some kind with which the Decalogue was\nrevealed. (28) The discrepancy of the two versions is treated of in\nChap. VIII.\n(29) Yet not even thus is all difficulty removed, for it seems scarcely\nreasonable to affirm that a created thing, depending on God in the same\nmanner as other created things, would be able to express or explain the\nnature of God either verbally or really by means of its individual\norganism: for instance, by declaring in the first person, \"I am the Lord\nyour God.\"\n(30) Certainly when anyone says with his mouth, \"I understand,\" we do not\nattribute the understanding to the mouth, but to the mind of the speaker;\nyet this is because the mouth is the natural organ of a man speaking, and\nthe hearer, knowing what understanding is, easily comprehends, by a\ncomparison with himself, that the speaker's mind is meant; but if we knew\nnothing of God beyond the mere name and wished to commune with Him, and be\nassured of His existence, I fail to see how our wish would be satisfied by\nthe declaration of a created thing (depending on God neither more nor less\nthan ourselves), \"I am the Lord.\" (31) If God contorted the lips of Moses,\nor, I will not say Moses, but some beast, till they pronounced the words,\n\"I am the Lord,\" should we apprehend the Lord's existence therefrom?\n(32) Scripture seems clearly to point to the belief that God spoke Himself,\nhaving descended from heaven to Mount Sinai for the purpose - and not only\nthat the Israelites heard Him speaking, but that their chief men beheld Him\n(Ex:xxiv.) (33) Further the law of Moses, which might neither be added to\nnor curtailed, and which was set up as a national standard of right, nowhere\nprescribed the belief that God is without body, or even without form or\nfigure, but only ordained that the Jews should believe in His existence and\nworship Him alone: it forbade them to invent or fashion any likeness of the\nDeity, but this was to insure purity of service; because, never having seen\nGod, they could not by means of images recall the likeness of God, but only\nthe likeness of some created thing which might thus gradually take the place\nof God as the object of their adoration. (34) Nevertheless, the Bible\nclearly implies that God has a form, and that Moses when he heard God\nspeaking was permitted to behold it, or at least its hinder parts.\n(35) Doubtless some mystery lurks in this question which we will discuss\nmore fully below. (36) For the present I will call attention to the passages\nin Scripture indicating the means by which God has revealed His laws to man.\n(37) Revelation may be through figures only, as in I Chron:xxii., where God\ndisplays his anger to David by means of an angel bearing a sword, and also\nin the story of Balaam.\n(38) Maimonides and others do indeed maintain that these and every other\ninstance of angelic apparitions (e.g. to Manoah and to Abraham offering up\nIsaac) occurred during sleep, for that no one with his eyes open ever could\nsee an angel, but this is mere nonsense. (39) The sole object of such\ncommentators seems to be to extort from Scripture confirmations of\nAristotelian quibbles and their own inventions, a proceeding which I regard\nas the acme of absurdity.\n(40) In figures, not real but existing only in the prophet's imagination,\nGod revealed to Joseph his future lordship, and in words and figures He\nrevealed to Joshua that He would fight for the Hebrews, causing to appear an\nangel, as it were the Captain of the Lord's host, bearing a sword, and by\nthis means communicating verbally. (41) The forsaking of Israel by\nProvidence was portrayed to Isaiah by a vision of the Lord, the thrice Holy,\nsitting on a very lofty throne, and the Hebrews, stained with the mire of\ntheir sins, sunk as it were in uncleanness, and thus as far as possible\ndistant from God. (42) The wretchedness of the people at the time was thus\nrevealed, while future calamities were foretold in words. I could cite from\nHoly Writ many similar examples, but I think they are sufficiently well\nknown already.\n(43) However, we get a still more clear confirmation of our position in Num\nxii:6,7, as follows: \"If there be any prophet among you, I the Lord will\nmake myself known unto him in a vision\" (i.e. by appearances and signs, for\nGod says of the prophecy of Moses that it was a vision without signs), \"and\nwill speak unto him in a dream\" (i.e. not with actual words and an actual\nvoice). (44) \"My servant Moses is not so; with him will I speak mouth to\nmouth, even apparently, and not in dark speeches, and the similitude of the\nLord he shall behold,\" i.e. looking on me as a friend and not afraid, he\nspeaks with me (cf. Ex xxxiii:17).\n(45) This makes it indisputable that the other prophets did not hear a real\nvoice, and we gather as much from Deut. xxxiv:10: \"And there arose not a\nprophet since in Israel like unto Moses whom the Lord knew face to face,\"\nwhich must mean that the Lord spoke with none other; for not even Moses saw\nthe Lord's face. (46) These are the only media of communication between\nGod and man which I find mentioned in Scripture, and therefore the only ones\nwhich may be supposed or invented. (47) We may be able quite to comprehend\nthat God can communicate immediately with man, for without the intervention\nof bodily means He communicates to our minds His essence; still, a man who\ncan by pure intuition comprehend ideas which are neither contained in nor\ndeducible from the foundations of our natural knowledge, must necessarily\npossess a mind far superior to those of his fellow men, nor do I believe\nthat any have been so endowed save Christ. (48) To Him the ordinances of God\nleading men to salvation were revealed directly without words or visions, so\nthat God manifested Himself to the Apostles through the mind of Christ as He\nformerly did to Moses through the supernatural voice. (49) In this sense the\nvoice of Christ, like the voice which Moses heard, may be called the voice\nof God, and it may be said that the wisdom of God (i.e. wisdom more than\nhuman) took upon itself in Christ human nature, and that Christ was the way\nof salvation. (50) I must at this juncture declare that those doctrines\nwhich certain churches put forward concerning Christ, I neither affirm nor\ndeny, for I freely confess that I do not understand them. (51) What I have\njust stated I gather from Scripture, where I never read that God appeared to\nChrist, or spoke to Christ, but that God was revealed to the Apostles\nthrough Christ; that Christ was the Way of Life, and that the old law was\ngiven through an angel, and not immediately by God; whence it follows that\nif Moses spoke with God face to face as a man speaks with his friend (i.e.\nby means of their two bodies) Christ communed with God mind to mind.\n(52) Thus we may conclude that no one except Christ received the revelations\nof God without the aid of imagination, whether in words or vision. (53)\nTherefore the power of prophecy implies not a peculiarly perfect mind, but a\npeculiarly vivid imagination, as I will show more clearly in the next\nchapter. (54) We will now inquire what is meant in the Bible by the\nSpirit of God breathed into the prophets, or by the prophets speaking with\nthe Spirit of God; to that end we must determine the exact signification of\nthe Hebrew word _ruagh_, commonly translated spirit.\n(55) The word _ruagh_ literally means a wind, _e.g._ the south\nwind, but it is frequently employed in other derivative significations.\nIt is used as equivalent to,\n(56) (1.) Breath: \"Neither is there any spirit in his mouth,\" Ps. cxxxv:17.\n(57) (2.) Life, or breathing: \"And his spirit returned to him\"\n1 Sam. xxx:12; i.e. he breathed again.\n(58) (3.) Courage and strength: \"Neither did there remain any more spirit\nin any man,\" Josh. ii:11; \"And the spirit entered into me, and\nmade me stand on my feet,\" Ezek. ii:2.\n(59) (4.) Virtue and fitness: \"Days should speak, and multitudes of years\nshould teach wisdom; but there is a spirit in man,\" Job xxxii:7;\ni.e. wisdom is not always found among old men for I now discover\nthat it depends on individual virtue and capacity. So, \"A man in\nwhom is the Spirit,\" Numbers xxvii:18.\n(60) (5.) Habit of mind: \"Because he had another spirit with him,\"\nNumbers xiv:24; i.e. another habit of mind. \"Behold I will pour\nout My Spirit unto you,\" Prov. i:23.\n(61) (6.) Will, purpose, desire, impulse: \"Whither the spirit was to go,\nthey went,\" Ezek. 1:12; \"That cover with a covering, but not of My\nSpirit,\" Is. xxx:1; \"For the Lord hath poured out on you the\nspirit of deep sleep,\" Is. xxix:10; \"Then was their spirit\nsoftened,\" Judges viii:3; \"He that ruleth his spirit, is better\nthan he that taketh a city,\" Prov. xvi:32; \"He that hath no ru\nover his own spirit,\" Prov. xxv:28; \"Your spirit as fire shall\ndevour you,\" Isaiah xxxiii:1.\nFrom the meaning of disposition we get -\n(62) (7.) Passions and faculties. A lofty spirit means pride, a lowly spirit\nhumility, an evil spirit hatred and melancholy. So, too, the\nexpressions spirits of jealousy, fornication, wisdom, counsel,\nbravery, stand for a jealous, lascivious, wise, prudent, or brave\nmind (for we Hebrews use substantives in preference to\nadjectives), or these various qualities.\n(63) (8.) The mind itself, or the life: \"Yea, they have all one spirit,\"\nEccles. iii:19 \"The spirit shall return to God Who gave it.\"\n(64) (9.) The quarters of the world (from the winds which blow thence), or\neven the side of anything turned towards a particular quarter -\nEzek. xxxvii:9; xlii:16, 17, 18, 19, &c.\n(65) I have already alluded to the way in which things are referred to God,\nand said to be of God.\n(66) (1.) As belonging to His nature, and being, as it were, part of Him;\ne.g. the power of God, the eyes of God.\n(67) (2.) As under His dominion, and depending on His pleasure; thus the\nheavens are called the heavens of the Lord, as being His chariot\nand habitation. So Nebuchadnezzar is called the servant of God,\nAssyria the scourge of God, &c.\n(68) (3.) As dedicated to Him, e.g. the Temple of God, a Nazarene of God,\nthe Bread of God.\n(69) (4.) As revealed through the prophets and not through our natural\nfaculties. In this sense the Mosaic law is called the law of God.\n(70) (5.) As being in the superlative degree. Very high mountains are styled\nthe mountains of God, a very deep sleep, the sleep of God, &c. In\nthis sense we must explain Amos iv:11: \"I have overthrown you as\nthe overthrow of the Lord came upon Sodom and Gomorrah,\" i.e. that\nmemorable overthrow, for since God Himself is the Speaker, the\npassage cannot well be taken otherwise. The wisdom of Solomon is\ncalled the wisdom of God, or extraordinary. The size of the cedars\nof Lebanon is alluded to in the Psalmist's expression, \"the cedars\nof the Lord.\"\n(71) Similarly, if the Jews were at a loss to understand any phenomenon, or\nwere ignorant of its cause, they referred it to God. (72) Thus a storm was\ntermed the chiding of God, thunder and lightning the arrows of God, for it\nwas thought that God kept the winds confined in caves, His treasuries; thus\ndiffering merely in name from the Greek wind-god Eolus. (73) In like manner\nmiracles were called works of God, as being especially marvellous; though in\nreality, of course, all natural events are the works of God, and take place\nsolely by His power. (74) The Psalmist calls the miracles in Egypt the works\nof God, because the Hebrews found in them a way of safety which they had not\nlooked for, and therefore especially marvelled at.\n(75) As, then, unusual natural phenomena are called works of God, and trees\nof unusual size are called trees of God, we cannot wonder that very strong\nand tall men, though impious robbers and whoremongers, are in Genesis called\nsons of God.\n(76) This reference of things wonderful to God was not peculiar to the Jews.\n(77) Pharaoh, on hearing the interpretation of his dream, exclaimed that the\nmind of the gods was in Joseph. (78) Nebuchadnezzar told Daniel that he\npossessed the mind of the holy gods; so also in Latin anything well made is\noften said to be wrought with Divine hands, which is equivalent to the\nHebrew phrase, wrought with the hand of God.\n(80) We can now very easily understand and explain those passages of\nScripture which speak of the Spirit of God. (81) In some places the\nexpression merely means a very strong, dry, and deadly wind, as in\nIsaiah xl:7, \"The grass withereth, the flower fadeth, because the Spirit of\nthe Lord bloweth upon it.\" (82) Similarly in Gen. i:2: \"The Spirit of the\nLord moved over the face of the waters.\" (83) At other times it is used as\nequivalent to a high courage, thus the spirit of Gideon and of Samson is\ncalled the Spirit of the Lord, as being very bold, and prepared for any\nemergency. (84) Any unusual virtue or power is called the Spirit or Virtue\nof the Lord, Ex. xxxi:3: \"I will fill him (Bezaleel) with the Spirit of the\nLord,\" i.e., as the Bible itself explains, with talent above man's usual\nendowment. (85) So Isa. xi:2: \"And the Spirit of the Lord shall rest upon\nhim,\" is explained afterwards in the text to mean the spirit of wisdom and\nunderstanding, of counsel and might.\n(86) The melancholy of Saul is called the melancholy of the Lord, or a very\ndeep melancholy, the persons who applied the term showing that they\nunderstood by it nothing supernatural, in that they sent for a musician to\nassuage it by harp-playing. (87) Again, the \"Spirit of the Lord\" is used\nas equivalent to the mind of man, for instance, Job xxvii:3: \"And the Spirit\nof the Lord in my nostrils,\" the allusion being to Gen. ii:7: \"And God\nbreathed into man's nostrils the breath of life.\" (88) Ezekiel also,\nprophesying to the dead, says (xxvii:14), \"And I will give to you My Spirit,\nand ye shall live;\" i.e. I will restore you to life. (89) In Job xxxiv:14,\nwe read: \"If He gather unto Himself His Spirit and breath;\" in Gen. vi:3:\n\"My Spirit shall not always strive with man, for that he also is flesh,\"\ni.e. since man acts on the dictates of his body, and not the spirit which I\ngave him to discern the good, I will let him alone. (90) So, too, Ps. li:12:\n\"Create in me a clean heart, O God, and renew a right spirit within me; cast\nme not away from Thy presence, and take not Thy Holy Spirit from me.\" (91)\nIt was supposed that sin originated only from the body, and that good\nimpulses come from the mind; therefore the Psalmist invokes the aid of God\nagainst the bodily appetites, but prays that the spirit which the Lord, the\nHoly One, had given him might be renewed. (92) Again, inasmuch as the Bible,\nin concession to popular ignorance, describes God as having a mind, a heart,\nemotions - nay, even a body and breath - the expression Spirit of the Lord\nis used for God's mind, disposition, emotion, strength, or breath.\n(93) Thus, Isa. xl:13: \"Who hath disposed the Spirit of the Lord?\" i.e. who,\nsave Himself, hath caused the mind of the Lord to will anything,? and\nIsa. lxiii:10: \"But they rebelled, and vexed the Holy Spirit.\"\n(94) The phrase comes to be used of the law of Moses, which in a sense\nexpounds God's will, Is. lxiii. 11, \"Where is He that put His Holy Spirit\nwithin him?\" meaning, as we clearly gather from the context, the law of\nMoses. (95) Nehemiah, speaking of the giving of the law, says, i:20,\n\"Thou gavest also thy good Spirit to instruct them.\" (96) This is referred\nto in Deut. iv:6, \"This is your wisdom and understanding,\" and in\nPs. cxliii:10, \"Thy good Spirit will lead me into the land of uprightness.\"\n(97) The Spirit of the Lord may mean the breath of the Lord, for breath, no\nless than a mind, a heart, and a body are attributed to God in Scripture, as\nin Ps. xxxiii:6. (98) Hence it gets to mean the power, strength, or faculty\nof God, as in Job xxxiii:4, \"The Spirit of the Lord made me,\" i.e. the\npower, or, if you prefer, the decree of the Lord. (99) So the Psalmist in\npoetic language declares, xxxiii:6, \"By the word of the Lord were the\nheavens made, and all the host of them by the breath of His mouth,\" i.e. by\na mandate issued, as it were, in one breath. (100) Also Ps. cxxxix:7,\n\"Whither shall I go from Thy Spirit, or whither shall I flee from Thy\npresence?\" i.e. whither shall I go so as to be beyond Thy power and Thy\npresence?\n(101) Lastly, the Spirit of the Lord is used in Scripture to express the\nemotions of God, e.g. His kindness and mercy, Micah ii:7, \"Is the Spirit\n[i.e. the mercy] of the Lord straitened? (102) Are these cruelties His\ndoings?\" (103) Zech. iv:6, \"Not by might or by power, but My Spirit [i.e.\nmercy], saith the Lord of hosts.\" (104) The twelfth verse of the seventh\nchapter of the same prophet must, I think, be interpreted in like manner:\n\"Yea, they made their hearts as an adamant stone, lest they should hear the\nlaw, and the words which the Lord of hosts hath sent in His Spirit [i.e. in\nHis mercy] by the former prophets.\" (105) So also Haggai ii:5: \"So My Spirit\nremaineth among you: fear not.\"\n(106) The passage in Isaiah xlviii:16, \"And now the Lord and His Spirit hath\nsent me,\" may be taken to refer to God's mercy or His revealed law; for the\nprophet says, \"From the beginning\" (i.e. from the time when I first came to\nyou, to preach God's anger and His sentence forth against you) \"I spoke not\nin secret; from the time that it was, there am I,\" and now I am sent by\nthe mercy of God as a joyful messenger to preach your restoration. (107) Or\nwe may understand him to mean by the revealed law that he had before come to\nwarn them by the command of the law (Levit. xix:17) in the same manner under\nthe same conditions as Moses had warned them, that now, like Moses, he ends\nby preaching their restoration. (108) But the first explanation seems to me\nthe best.\n(109) Returning, then, to the main object of our discussion, we find that\nthe Scriptural phrases, \"The Spirit of the Lord was upon a prophet,\" \"The\nLord breathed His Spirit into men,\" \"Men were filled with the Spirit of God,\nwith the Holy Spirit,\" &c., are quite clear to us, and mean that prophets\nwere endowed with a peculiar and extraordinary power, and devoted themselves\nto piety with especial constancy(3); that thus they perceived the mind or\nthe thought of God, for we have shown that God's Spirit signifies in Hebrew\nGod's mind or thought, and that the law which shows His mind and thought is\ncalled His Spirit; hence that the imagination of the prophets, inasmuch as\nthrough it were revealed the decrees of God, may equally be called the mind\nof God, and the prophets be said to have possessed the mind of God. (110) On\nour minds also the mind of God and His eternal thoughts are impressed; but\nthis being the same for all men is less taken into account, especially by\nthe Hebrews, who claimed a pre-eminence, and despised other men and other\nmen's knowledge.\n(111) Lastly, the prophets were said to possess the Spirit of God because\nmen knew not the cause of prophetic knowledge, and in their wonder referred\nit with other marvels directly to the Deity, styling it Divine knowledge.\n(112) We need no longer scruple to affirm that the prophets only\nperceived God's revelation by the aid of imagination, that is, by words and\nfigures either real or imaginary. (113) We find no other means mentioned in\nScripture, and therefore must not invent any. (114) As to the particular law\nof Nature by which the communications took place, I confess my ignorance.\n(115) I might, indeed, say as others do, that they took place by the power\nof God; but this would be mere trifling, and no better than explaining some\nunique specimen by a transcendental term. (116) Everything takes place by\nthe power of God. (117) Nature herself is the power of God under another\nname, and our ignorance of the power of God is co-extensive with our\nignorance of Nature. (118) It is absolute folly, therefore, to ascribe an\nevent to the power of God when we know not its natural cause, which is the\npower of God.\n(119) However, we are not now inquiring into the causes of prophetic\nknowledge. (120) We are only attempting, as I have said, to examine the\nScriptural documents, and to draw our conclusions from them as from ultimate\nnatural facts; the causes of the documents do not concern us.\n(121) As the prophets perceived the revelations of God by the aid of\nimagination, they could indisputably perceive much that is beyond the\nboundary of the intellect, for many more ideas can be constructed from words\nand figures than from the principles and notions on which the whole fabric\nof reasoned knowledge is reared.\n(122) Thus we have a clue to the fact that the prophets perceived nearly\neverything in parables and allegories, and clothed spiritual truths in\nbodily forms, for such is the usual method of imagination. (122) We need no\nlonger wonder that Scripture and the prophets speak so strangely and\nobscurely of God's Spirit or Mind (cf. Numbers xi:17, 1 Kings xxii:21, &c.),\nthat the Lord was seen by Micah as sitting, by Daniel as an old man clothed\nin white, by Ezekiel as a fire, that the Holy Spirit appeared to those with\nChrist as a descending dove, to the apostles as fiery tongues, to Paul on\nhis conversion as a great light. (124) All these expressions are plainly in\nharmony with the current ideas of God and spirits.\n(125) Inasmuch as imagination is fleeting and inconstant, we find that the\npower of prophecy did not remain with a prophet for long, nor manifest\nitself frequently, but was very rare; manifesting itself only in a few men,\nand in them not often.\n(126) We must necessarily inquire how the prophets became assured of the\ntruth of what they perceived by imagination, and not by sure mental laws;\nbut our investigation must be confined to Scripture, for the subject is one\non which we cannot acquire certain knowledge, and which we cannot explain by\nthe immediate causes. (127) Scripture teaching about the assurance of\nprophets I will treat of in the next chapter.\nCHAPTER II. - OF PROPHETS.\n(1) It follows from the last chapter that, as I have said, the prophets were\nendowed with unusually vivid imaginations, and not with unusually perfect\nminds. (2) This conclusion is amply sustained by Scripture, for we are told\nthat Solomon was the wisest of men, but had no special faculty of prophecy.\n(3) Heman, Calcol, and Dara, though men of great talent, were not prophets,\nwhereas uneducated countrymen, nay, even women, such as Hagar, Abraham's\nhandmaid, were thus gifted. (4) Nor is this contrary to ordinary experience\nand reason. (5) Men of great imaginative power are less fitted for abstract\nreasoning, whereas those who excel in intellect and its use keep their\nimagination more restrained and controlled, holding it in subjection, so to\nspeak, lest it should usurp the place of reason.\n(6) Thus to suppose that knowledge of natural and spiritual phenomena can be\ngained from the prophetic books, is an utter mistake, which I shall\nendeavour to expose, as I think philosophy, the age, and the question itself\ndemand. (7) I care not for the girdings of superstition, for superstition is\nthe bitter enemy, of all true knowledge and true morality. (8) Yes; it has\ncome to this! (9) Men who openly confess that they can form no idea of God,\nand only know Him through created things, of which they know not the causes,\ncan unblushingly accuse philosophers of Atheism.\n(10) Treating the question methodically, I will show that prophecies\nvaried, not only according to the imagination and physical temperament\nof the prophet, but also according to his particular opinions; and\nfurther that prophecy never rendered the prophet wiser than he was\nbefore. (11) But I will first discuss the assurance of truth which the\nprophets received, for this is akin to the subject-matter of the\nchapter, and will serve to elucidate somewhat our present point.\n(12) Imagination does not, in its own nature, involve any certainty of\ntruth, such as is implied in every clear and distinct idea, but requires\nsome extrinsic reason to assure us of its objective reality: hence prophecy\ncannot afford certainty, and the prophets were assured of God's revelation\nby some sign, and not by the fact of revelation, as we may see from Abraham,\nwho, when he had heard the promise of God, demanded a sign, not because he\ndid not believe in God, but because he wished to be sure that it was God Who\nmade the promise. (13) The fact is still more evident in the case of Gideon:\n\"Show me,\" he says to God, \"show me a sign, that I may know that it is Thou\nthat talkest with me.\" (14) God also says to Moses: \"And let this be a\nsign that I have sent thee.\" (15) Hezekiah, though he had long known Isaiah\nto be a prophet, none the less demanded a sign of the cure which he\npredicted. (15) It is thus quite evident that the prophets always received\nsome sign to certify them of their prophetic imaginings; and for this reason\nMoses bids the Jews (Deut. xviii.) ask of the prophets a sign, namely, the\nprediction of some coming event. (16) In this respect, prophetic knowledge\nis inferior to natural knowledge, which needs no sign, and in itself implies\ncertitude. (17) Moreover, Scripture warrants the statement that the\ncertitude of the prophets was not mathematical, but moral. (18) Moses lays\ndown the punishment of death for the prophet who preaches new gods, even\nthough he confirm his doctrine by signs and wonders (Deut. xiii.); \"For,\" he\nsays, \"the Lord also worketh signs and wonders to try His people.\" (19) And\nJesus Christ warns His disciples of the same thing (Matt. xxiv:24). (20)\nFurthermore, Ezekiel (xiv:9) plainly states that God sometimes deceives\nmen with false revelations; and Micaiah bears like witness in the case of\nthe prophets of Ahab.\n(21) Although these instances go to prove that revelation is open to doubt,\nit nevertheless contains, as we have said, a considerable element of\ncertainty, for God never deceives the good, nor His chosen, but (according\nto the ancient proverb, and as appears in the history of Abigail and her\nspeech), God uses the good as instruments of goodness, and the wicked as\nmeans to execute His wrath. (22) This may be seen from the case of Micaiah\nabove quoted; for although God had determined to deceive Ahab, through\nprophets, He made use of lying prophets; to the good prophet He revealed the\ntruth, and did not forbid his proclaiming it.\n(23) Still the certitude of prophecy, remains, as I have said, merely,\nmoral; for no one can justify himself before God, nor boast that he is an\ninstrument for God's goodness. (24) Scripture itself teaches and shows that\nGod led away David to number the people, though it bears ample\nwitness to David's piety.\n(25) The whole question of the certitude of prophecy, was based on these\nthree considerations:\n1. That the things revealed were imagined very vividly, affecting the\nprophets in the same way as things seen when awake;\n2. The presence of a sign;\n3. Lastly, and chiefly, that the mind of the prophet was given wholly,\nto what was right and  good.\n(26) Although Scripture does not always make mention of a sign, we must\nnevertheless suppose that a sign was always vouchsafed; for Scripture does\nnot always relate every condition and circumstance (as many have\nremarked), but rather takes them for granted. (27) We may, however, admit\nthat no sign was needed when the prophecy declared nothing that was not\nalready contained in the law of Moses, because it was confirmed by that law.\n(28) For instance, Jeremiah's prophecy, of the destruction of Jerusalem was\nconfirmed by the prophecies of other prophets, and by the threats in the\nlaw, and, therefore, it needed no sign; whereas Hananiah, who, contrary to\nall the prophets, foretold the speedy restoration of the state, stood in\nneed of a sign, or he would have been in doubt as to the truth of his\nprophecy, until it was confirmed by facts. (29) \"The prophet which\nprophesieth of peace, when the word of the prophet shall come to\npass, then shall the prophet be known that the Lord hath truly sent him.\"\n(30) As, then, the certitude afforded to the prophet by signs was not\nmathematical (i.e. did not necessarily follow from the perception of the\nthing perceived or seen), but only moral, and as the signs were only given\nto convince the prophet, it follows that such signs were given according to\nthe opinions and capacity of each prophet, so that a sign which\nconvince one prophet would fall far short of convincing another who was\nimbued with different opinions. (31) Therefore the signs varied according to\nthe individual prophet.\n(32) So also did the revelation vary, as we have stated, according to\nindividual disposition and temperament, and according to the opinions\npreviously held.\n(33) It varied according to disposition, in this way: if a prophet was\ncheerful, victories, peace, and events which make men glad, were revealed to\nhim; in that he was naturally more likely to imagine such things. (34) If,\non the contrary, he was melancholy, wars, massacres, and calamities were\nrevealed; and so, according as a prophet was merciful, gentle, quick to\nanger, or severe, he was more fitted for one kind of revelation than\nanother. (35) It varied according to the temper of imagination in this way:\nif a prophet was cultivated he perceived the mind of God in a cultivated\nway, if he was confused he perceived it confusedly. (36) And so with\nrevelations perceived through visions. (37) If a prophet was a countryman he\nsaw visions of oxen, cows, and the like; if he was a soldier, he saw\ngenerals and armies; if a courtier, a royal throne, and so on.\n(38) Lastly, prophecy varied according to the opinions held by the prophets;\nfor instance, to the Magi, who believed in the follies of astrology, the\nbirth of Christ was revealed through the vision of a star in the East. (39)\nTo the augurs of Nebuchadnezzar the destruction of Jerusalem was revealed\nthrough entrails, whereas the king himself inferred it from oracles and the\ndirection of arrows which he shot into the air. (40) To prophets who\nbelieved that man acts from free choice and by his own power, God was\nrevealed as standing apart from and ignorant of future human actions. (41)\nAll of which we will illustrate from Scripture.\n(42) The first point is proved from the case of Elisha, who, in order to\nprophecy to Jehoram, asked for a harp, and was unable to perceive the Divine\npurpose till he had been recreated by its music; then, indeed, he prophesied\nto Jehoram and to his allies glad tidings, which previously he had been\nunable to attain to because he was angry with the king, and these who are\nangry with anyone can imagine evil of him, but not good. (43) The theory\nthat God does not reveal Himself to the angry or the sad, is a mere dream:\nfor God revealed to Moses while angry, the terrible slaughter of the\nfirstborn, and did so without the intervention of a harp. (44) To Cain in\nhis rage, God was revealed, and to Ezekiel, impatient with anger, was\nrevealed the contumacy and wretchedness of the Jews. (45) Jeremiah,\nmiserable and weary of life, prophesied the disasters of the Hebrews, so\nthat Josiah would not consult him, but inquired of a woman, inasmuch as it\nwas more in accordance with womanly nature that God should reveal His mercy\nthereto. (46) So, Micaiah never prophesied good to Ahab, though other true\nprophets had done so, but invariably evil. (46) Thus we see that individual\nprophets were by temperament more fitted for one sort of revelation than\nanother.\n(47) The style of the prophecy also varied according to the eloquence of the\nindividual prophet. (48) The prophecies of Ezekiel and Amos are not written\nin a cultivated style like those of Isaiah and Nahum, but more rudely. (49)\nAny Hebrew scholar who wishes to inquire into this point more closely, and\ncompares chapters of the different prophets treating of the same subject,\nwill find great dissimilarity of style. (50) Compare, for instance, chap. i.\nof the courtly Isaiah, verse 11 to verse 20, with chap. v. of the countryman\nAmos, verses 21-24. (51) Compare also the order and reasoning of the\nprophecies of Jeremiah, written in Idumaea (chap. xlix.), with the order and\nreasoning of Obadiah. (52) Compare, lastly, Isa. xl:19, 20, and xliv:8, with\nHosea viii:6, and xiii:2. And so on.\n(53) A due consideration of these passage will clearly show us that God has\nno particular style in speaking, but, according to the learning and capacity\nof the prophet, is cultivated, compressed, severe, untutored, prolix, or\nobscure.\n(54) There was, moreover, a certain variation in the visions vouchsafed to\nthe prophets, and in the symbols by which they expressed them, for Isaiah\nsaw the glory of the Lord departing from the Temple in a different form from\nthat presented to Ezekiel. (55) The Rabbis, indeed, maintain that both\nvisions were really the same, but that Ezekiel, being a countryman, was\nabove measure impressed by it, and therefore set it forth in full detail;\nbut unless there is a trustworthy tradition on the subject, which I do not\nfor a moment believe, this theory is plainly an invention. Isaiah saw\nseraphim with six wings, Ezekiel beasts with four wings; Isaiah saw God\nclothed and sitting on a royal throne, Ezekiel saw Him in the likeness of a\nfire; each doubtless saw God under the form in which he usually imagined\nHim.\n(56) Further, the visions varied in clearness as well as in details; for the\nrevelations of Zechariah were too obscure to be understood by the prophet\nwithout explanation, as appears from his narration of them; the visions of\nDaniel could not be understood by him even after they had been explained,\nand this obscurity did not arise from the difficulty of the matter revealed\n(for being merely human affairs, these only transcended human capacity in\nbeing future), but solely in the fact that Daniel's imagination was not so\ncapable for prophecy while he was awake as while he was asleep; and this is\nfurther evident from the fact that at the very beginning of the vision he\nwas so terrified that he almost despaired of his strength. (57) Thus, on\naccount of the inadequacy of his imagination and his strength, the things\nrevealed were so obscure to him that he could not understand them even after\nthey had been explained. (58) Here we may note that the words heard by\nDaniel, were, as we have shown above, simply imaginary, so that it is hardly\nwonderful that in his frightened state he imagined them so confusedly and\nobscurely that afterwards he could make nothing of them. (59) Those who say\nthat God did not wish to make a clear revelation, do not seem to have read\nthe words of the angel, who expressly says that he came to make the prophet\nunderstand what should befall his people in the latter days (Dan. x:14).\n(60) The revelation remained obscure because no one was found, at that time,\nwith imagination sufficiently strong to conceive it more clearly. (61)\nLastly, the prophets, to whom it was revealed that God would take away\nElijah, wished to persuade Elisha that he had been taken somewhere where\nthey would find him; showing sufficiently clearly that they had not\nunderstood God's revelation aright.\n(62) There is no need to set this out more amply, for nothing is more plain\nin the Bible than that God endowed some prophets with far greater gifts of\nprophecy than others. (63) But I will show in greater detail and length, for\nI consider the point more important, that the prophecies varied according to\nthe opinions previously embraced by the prophets, and that the prophets held\ndiverse and even contrary opinions and prejudices. (64) (I speak, be it\nunderstood, solely of matters speculative, for in regard to uprightness and\nmorality the case is widely different.) (65) From thence I shall conclude\nthat prophecy never rendered the prophets more learned, but left them with\ntheir former opinions, and that we are, therefore, not at all bound to\ntrust them in matters of intellect.\n(66) Everyone has been strangely hasty in affirming that the prophets knew\neverything within the scope of human intellect; and, although certain\npassages of Scripture plainly affirm that the prophets were in certain\nrespects ignorant, such persons would rather say that they do not\nunderstand the passages than admit that there was anything which the\nprophets did not know; or else they try to wrest the Scriptural words away\nfrom their evident meaning.\n(67) If either of these proceedings is allowable we may as well shut our\nBibles, for vainly shall we attempt to prove anything from them if their\nplainest passages may be classed among obscure and impenetrable mysteries,\nor if we may put any interpretation on them which we fancy. (68) For\ninstance, nothing is more clear in the Bible than that Joshua, and perhaps\nalso the author who wrote his history, thought that the sun revolves round\nthe earth, and that the earth is fixed, and further that the sun for a\ncertain period remained still. (69) Many, who will not admit any movement in\nthe heavenly bodies, explain away the passage till it seems to mean\nsomething quite different; others, who have learned to philosophize more\ncorrectly, and understand that the earth moves while the sun is still, or at\nany rate does not revolve round the earth, try with all their might to wrest\nthis meaning from Scripture, though plainly nothing of the sort is\nintended. (70) Such quibblers excite my wonder! (71) Are we, forsooth, bound\nto believe that Joshua the Soldier was a learned astronomer? or that a\nmiracle could not be revealed to him, or that the light of the sun could not\nremain longer than usual above the horizon, without his knowing the cause?\n(72) To me both alternatives appear ridiculous, and therefore I would\nrather say, that Joshua was ignorant of the true cause of the lengthened\nday, and that he and the whole host with him thought that the sun moved\nround the earth every day, and that on that particular occasion it stood\nstill for a time, thus causing the light to remain longer; and I would\nsay, that they did not conjecture that, from the amount of snow in the air\n(see Josh. x:11), the refraction may have been greater than usual, or that\nthere may have been some other cause which we will not now inquire into.\n(73) So also the sign of the shadow going back was revealed to Isaiah\naccording to his understanding; that is, as proceeding from a going\nbackwards of the sun; for he, too, thought that the sun moves and that the\nearth is still; of parhelia he perhaps never even dreamed. (74) We may\narrive at this conclusion without any scruple, for the sign could really\nhave come to pass, and have been predicted by Isaiah to the king, without\nthe prophet being aware of the real cause.\n(75) With regard to the building of the Temple by Solomon, if it was really\ndictated by God we must maintain the same doctrine: namely, that all the\nmeasurements were revealed according to the opinions and understanding of\nthe king; for as we are not bound to believe that Solomon was a\nmathematician, we may affirm that he was ignorant of the true ratio between\nthe circumference and the diameter of a circle, and that, like the\ngenerality of workmen, he thought that it was as three to one. (76) But if\nit is allowable to declare that we do not understand the passage, in good\nsooth I know nothing in the Bible that we can understand; for the process of\nbuilding is there narrated simply and as a mere matter of history. (77) If,\nagain, it is permitted to pretend that the passage has another meaning, and\nwas written as it is from some reason unknown to us, this is no less than a\ncomplete subversal of the Bible; for every absurd and evil invention of\nhuman perversity could thus, without detriment to Scriptural authority, be\ndefended and fostered. (78) Our conclusion is in no wise impious, for though\nSolomon, Isaiah, Joshua, &c. were prophets, they were none the less men, and\nas such not exempt from human shortcomings.\n(79) According to the understanding of Noah it was revealed to him that God\nas about to destroy the whole human race, for Noah thought that beyond the\nlimits of Palestine the world was not inhabited.\n(80) Not only in matters of this kind, but in others more important,\nthe prophets could be, and in fact were, ignorant; for they taught\nnothing special about the Divine attributes, but held quite ordinary\nnotions about God, and to these notions their revelations were adapted,\nas I will demonstrate by ample Scriptural testimony; from all which one\nmay easily see that they were praised and commended, not so much for\nthe sublimity and eminence of their intellect as for their piety and\nfaithfulness.\n(81) Adam, the first man to whom God was revealed, did not know that He is\nomnipotent and omniscient; for he hid himself from Him, and attempted to\nmake excuses for his fault before God, as though he had had to do with a\nman; therefore to him also was God revealed according to his understanding -\nthat is, as being unaware of his situation or his sin, for Adam\nheard, or seemed to hear, the Lord walking in the garden, calling him and\nasking him where he was; and then, on seeing his shamefacedness, asking him\nwhether he had eaten of the forbidden fruit. (82) Adam evidently only knew\nthe Deity as the Creator of all things. (83) To Cain also God was revealed,\naccording to his understanding, as ignorant of human affairs, nor was a\nhigher conception of the Deity required for repentance of his sin.\n(83) To Laban the Lord revealed Himself as the God of Abraham, because Laban\nbelieved that each nation had its own special divinity (see Gen. xxxi:29).\n(84) Abraham also knew not that God is omnipresent, and has foreknowledge of\nall things; for when he heard the sentence against the inhabitants of Sodom,\nhe prayed that the Lord should not execute it till He had ascertained\nwhether they all merited such punishment; for he said (see Gen. xviii:24),\n\"Peradventure there be fifty righteous within the city,\" and in accordance\nwith this belief God was revealed to him; as Abraham imagined, He spake\nthus: \"I will go down now, and see whether they have done altogether\naccording to the cry of it which is come unto Me; and, if not, I will know.\"\n(85) Further, the Divine testimony concerning Abraham asserts nothing but\nthat he was obedient, and that he \"commanded his household after him that\nthey should keep the way of the Lord\" (Gen. xviii:19); it does not state\nthat he held sublime conceptions of the Deity.\n(86) Moses, also, was not sufficiently aware that God is omniscient, and\ndirects human actions by His sole decree, for although God Himself says that\nthe Israelites should hearken to Him, Moses still considered the matter\ndoubtful and repeated, \"But if they will not believe me, nor hearken unto my\nvoice.\" (87) To him in like manner God was revealed as taking no part in,\nand as being ignorant of, future human actions: the Lord gave him two signs\nand said, \"And it shall come to pass that if they will not believe thee,\nneither hearken to the voice of the first sign, that they will believe the\nvoice of the latter sign; but if not, thou shalt take of the water of the\nriver,\" &c. (88) Indeed, if any one considers without prejudice the recorded\nopinions of Moses, he will plainly see that Moses conceived the Deity as a\nBeing Who has always existed, does exist, and always will exist, and for\nthis cause he calls Him by the name Jehovah, which in Hebrew signifies these\nthree phases of existence: as to His nature, Moses only taught that He is\nmerciful, gracious, and exceeding jealous, as appears from many passages in\nthe Pentateuch. (89) Lastly, he believed and taught that this Being was so\ndifferent from all other beings, that He could not be expressed by the image\nof any visible thing; also, that He could not be looked upon, and that not\nso much from inherent impossibility as from human infirmity; further, that\nby reason of His power He was without equal and unique. (90) Moses admitted,\nindeed, that there were beings (doubtless by the plan and command of the\nLord) who acted as God's vicegerents - that is, beings to whom God had given\nthe right, authority, and power to direct nations, and to provide and care\nfor them; but he taught that this Being Whom they were bound to obey was\nthe highest and Supreme God, or (to use the Hebrew phrase) God of gods, and\nthus in the song (Exod. xv:11) he exclaims, \"Who is like unto Thee, O Lord,\namong the gods?\" and Jethro says (Exod. xviii:11), \"Now I know that the Lord\nis greater than all gods.\" (91) That is to say, \"I am at length compelled to\nadmit to Moses that Jehovah is greater than all gods, and that His power\nis unrivalled.\" (92) We must remain in doubt whether Moses thought that\nthese beings who acted as God's vicegerents were created by Him, for he\nhas stated nothing, so far as we know, about their creation and origin. (93)\nHe further taught that this Being had brought the visible world into order\nfrom Chaos, and had given Nature her germs, and therefore that He\npossesses supreme right and power over all things; further, that by reason\nof this supreme right and power He had chosen for Himself alone the Hebrew\nnation and a certain strip of territory, and had handed over to the care of\nother gods substituted by Himself the rest of the nations and territories,\nand that therefore He was called the God of Israel and the God of Jerusalem,\nwhereas the other gods were called the gods of the Gentiles. (94) For this\nreason the Jews believed that the strip of territory which God had chosen\nfor Himself, demanded a Divine worship quite apart and different from the\nworship which obtained elsewhere, and that the Lord would not suffer the\nworship of other gods adapted to other countries. (95) Thus they thought\nthat the people whom the king of Assyria had brought into Judaea were torn\nin pieces by lions because they knew not the worship of the National\nDivinity (2 Kings xvii:25).\n(96) Jacob, according to Aben Ezra's opinion, therefore admonished his sons\nwhen he wished them to seek out a new country, that they should prepare\nthemselves for a new worship, and lay aside the worship of strange gods -\nthat is, of the gods of the land where they were (Gen. xxxv:2, 3).\n(97) David, in telling Saul that he was compelled by the king's persecution\nto live away from his country, said that he was driven out from the heritage\nof the Lord, and sent to worship other gods (1 Sam. xxvi:19). (98) Lastly,\nhe believed that this Being or Deity had His habitation in the heavens\n(Deut. xxxiii:27), an opinion very common among the Gentiles.\n(99) If we now examine the revelations to Moses, we shall find that they\nwere accommodated to these opinions; as he believed that the Divine Nature\nwas subject to the conditions of mercy, graciousness, &c., so God was\nrevealed to him in accordance with his idea and under these attributes (see\nExodus xxxiv:6, 7, and the second commandment). (100) Further it is related\n(Ex. xxxiii:18) that Moses asked of God that he might behold Him, but as\nMoses (as we have said) had formed no mental image of God, and God (as I\nhave shown) only revealed Himself to the prophets in accordance with the\ndisposition of their imagination, He did not reveal Himself in any form.\n(101) This, I repeat, was because the imagination of Moses was unsuitable,\nfor other prophets bear witness that they saw the Lord; for instance,\nIsaiah, Ezekiel, Daniel, &c. (102) For this reason God answered Moses, \"Thou\ncanst not see My face;\" and inasmuch as Moses believed that God can be\nlooked upon - that is, that no contradiction of the Divine nature is therein\ninvolved (for otherwise he would never have preferred his request) - it is\nadded, \"For no one shall look on Me and live,\" thus giving a reason in\naccordance with Moses' idea, for it is not stated that a contradiction of\nthe Divine nature would be involved, as was really the case, but that the\nthing would not come to pass because of human infirmity.\n(103) When God would reveal to Moses that the Israelites, because they\nworshipped the calf, were to be placed in the same category as other\nnations, He said (ch. xxxiii:2, 3), that He would send an angel (that is, a\nbeing who should have charge of the Israelites, instead of the Supreme\nBeing), and that He Himself would no longer remain among them; thus leaving\nMoses no ground for supposing that the Israelites were more beloved by God\nthan the other nations whose guardianship He had entrusted to other beings\nor angels (vide verse 16).\n(104) Lastly, as Moses believed that God dwelt in the heavens, God was\nrevealed to him as coming down from heaven on to a mountain, and in order to\ntalk with the Lord Moses went up the mountain, which he certainly need not\nhave done if he could have conceived of God as omnipresent.\n(105) The Israelites knew scarcely anything of God, although He was revealed\nto them; and this is abundantly evident from their transferring, a few days\nafterwards, the honour and worship due to Him to a calf, which they believed\nto be the god who had brought them out of Egypt. (106) In truth, it is\nhardly likely that men accustomed to the superstitions of Egypt,\nuncultivated and sunk in most abject slavery, should have held any sound\nnotions about the Deity, or that Moses should have taught them anything\nbeyond a rule of right living; inculcating it not like a philosopher, as the\nresult of freedom, but like a lawgiver compelling them to be moral by\nlegal authority. (107) Thus the rule of right living, the worship and love\nof God, was to them rather a bondage than the true liberty, the gift and\ngrace of the Deity. (108) Moses bid them love God and keep His law, because\nthey had in the past received benefits from Him (such as the\ndeliverance from slavery in Egypt), and further terrified them with threats\nif they transgressed His commands, holding out many promises of good if they\nshould observe them; thus treating them as parents treat irrational\nchildren. It is, therefore, certain that they knew not the excellence of\nvirtue and the true happiness.\n(109) Jonah thought that he was fleeing from the sight of God, which seems\nto show that he too held that God had entrusted the care of the nations\noutside Judaea to other substituted powers. (110) No one in the whole of the\nOld Testament speaks more rationally of God than Solomon, who in fact\nsurpassed all the men of his time in natural ability. (111) Yet he\nconsidered himself above the law (esteeming it only to have been given for\nmen without reasonable and intellectual grounds for their actions), and made\nsmall account of the laws concerning kings, which are mainly three: nay, he\nopenly violated them (in this he did wrong, and acted in a manner unworthy\nof a philosopher, by indulging in sensual pleasure), and taught that all\nFortune's favours to mankind are vanity, that humanity has no nobler gift\nthan wisdom, and no greater punishment than folly.\n(112) See Proverbs xvi:22, 23.\n(113) But let us return to the prophets whose conflicting opinions we have\nundertaken to note.\n(114) The expressed ideas of Ezekiel seemed so diverse from those of\nMoses to the Rabbis who have left us the extant prophetic books (as is\ntold in the treatise of Sabbathus, i:13, 2), that they had serious\nthoughts of omitting his prophecy from the canon, and would doubtless\nhave thus excluded it if a certain Hananiah had not undertaken to\nexplain it; a task which (as is there narrated) he with great zeal and\nlabour accomplished. (115) How he did so does not sufficiently appear,\nwhether it was by writing a commentary which has now perished, or by\naltering Ezekiel's words and audaciously striking out phrases according\nto his fancy. (116) However this may be, chapter xviii. certainly does\nnot seem to agree with Exodus xxxiv:7, Jeremiah xxxii:18, &c.\n(117 ) Samuel believed that the Lord never repented of anything He had\ndecreed (1 Sam. xv:29), for when Saul was sorry for his sin, and wished to\nworship God and ask for forgiveness, Samuel said that the Lord would not go\nback from his decree.\n(118) To Jeremiah, on the other hand, it was revealed that, \"If that nation\nagainst whom I (the Lord) have pronounced, turn from their evil, I will\nrepent of the evil that I thought to do unto them. (119) If it do evil in my\nsight, that it obey not my voice, then I will repent of the good wherewith I\nsaid I would benefit them\" (Jer. xviii:8-10). (120) Joel (ii:13) taught that\nthe Lord repented Him only of evil. (121) Lastly, it is clear from Gen iv: 7\nthat a man can overcome the temptations of sin, and act righteously; for\nthis doctrine is told to Cain, though, as we learn from Josephus and the\nScriptures, he never did so overcome them. (122) And this agrees with the\nchapter of Jeremiah just cited, for it is there said that the Lord repents\nof the good or the evil pronounced, if the men in question change their ways\nand manner of life. (123) But, on the other hand, Paul (Rom.ix:10) teaches\nas plainly as possible that men have no control over the temptations of the\nflesh save by the special vocation and grace of God. (124) And when\n(Rom. iii:5 and vi:19) he attributes righteousness to man, he corrects\nhimself as speaking merely humanly and through the infirmity of the flesh.\n(125) We have now more than sufficiently proved our point, that God adapted\nrevelations to the understanding and opinions of the prophets, and that in\nmatters of theory without bearing on charity or morality the prophets could\nbe, and, in fact, were, ignorant, and held conflicting opinions. (126) It\ntherefore follows that we must by no means go to the prophets for knowledge,\neither of natural or of spiritual phenomena.\n(127) We have determined, then, that we are only bound to believe in the\nprophetic writings, the object and substance of the revelation; with regard\nto the details, every one may believe or not, as he likes.\n(128) For instance, the revelation to Cain only teaches us that God\nadmonished him to lead the true life, for such alone is the object and\nsubstance of the revelation, not doctrines concerning free will and\nphilosophy. (129) Hence, though the freedom of the will is clearly implied\nin the words of the admonition, we are at liberty to hold a contrary\nopinion, since the words and reasons were adapted to the understanding of\nCain.\n(130) So, too, the revelation to Micaiah would only teach that God revealed\nto him the true issue of the battle between Ahab and Aram; and this is all\nwe are bound to believe. (131) Whatever else is contained in the revelation\nconcerning the true and the false Spirit of God, the army of heaven standing\non the right hand and on the left, and all the other details, does not\naffect us at all. (132) Everyone may believe as much of it as his reason\nallows.\n(132) The reasonings by which the Lord displayed His power to Job (if they\nreally were a revelation, and the author of the history is narrating, and\nnot merely, as some suppose, rhetorically adorning his own conceptions),\nwould come under the same category - that is, they were adapted to Job's\nunderstanding, for the purpose of convincing him, and are not universal,\nor for the convincing of all men.\n(133) We can come to no different conclusion with respect to the reasonings\nof Christ, by which He convicted the Pharisees of pride and ignorance, and\nexhorted His disciples to lead the true life. (134) He adapted them to each\nman's opinions and principles. (135) For instance, when He said to the\nPharisees (Matt. xii:26), \"And if Satan cast out devils, his house is\ndivided against itself, how then shall his kingdom stand?\" (136) He only\nwished to convince the Pharisees according, to their own principles, not to\nteach that there are devils, or any kingdom of devils. (137) So, too,\nwhen He said to His disciples (Matt. viii:10), \"See that ye despise not one\nof these little ones, for I say unto you that their angels,\" &c., He merely\ndesired to warn them against pride and despising any of their fellows, not\nto insist on the actual reason given, which was simply adopted in order to\npersuade them more easily.\n(138) Lastly, we should say exactly the same of the apostolic signs and\nreasonings, but there is no need to go further into the subject. (139) If I\nwere to enumerate all the passages of Scripture addressed only to\nindividuals, or to a particular man's understanding, and which cannot,\nwithout great danger to philosophy, be defended as Divine doctrines, I\nshould go far beyond the brevity at which I aim. (140) Let it suffice, then,\nto have indicated a few instances of general application, and let the\ncurious reader consider others by himself. (141) Although the points we\nhave just raised concerning prophets and prophecy are the only ones which\nhave any direct bearing on the end in view, namely, the separation of\nPhilosophy from Theology, still, as I have touched on the general question,\nI may here inquire whether the gift of prophecy was peculiar to the Hebrews,\nor whether it was common to all nations. (142) I must then come to a\nconclusion about the vocation of the Hebrews, all of which I shall do in the\nensuing chapter.\nCHAPTER III.  OF THE VOCATION OF THE HEBREWS, AND\nWHETHER THE GIFT OF PROPHECY WAS PECULIAR TO THEM.\n(1) Every man's true happiness and blessedness consist solely in the\nenjoyment of what is good, not in the pride that he alone is enjoying it, to\nthe exclusion of others. (2) He who thinks himself the more blessed because\nhe is enjoying benefits which others are not, or because he is more blessed\nor more fortunate than his fellows, is ignorant of true happiness and\nblessedness, and the joy which he feels is either childish or envious and\nmalicious. (3) For instance, a man's true happiness consists only in wisdom,\nand the knowledge of the truth, not at all in the fact that he is wiser than\nothers, or that others lack such knowledge: such considerations do not\nincrease his wisdom or true happiness.\n(4) Whoever, therefore, rejoices for such reasons, rejoices in another's\nmisfortune, and is, so far, malicious and bad, knowing neither true\nhappiness nor the peace of the true life.\n(5) When Scripture, therefore, in exhorting the Hebrews to obey the law,\nsays that the Lord has chosen them for Himself before other nations\n(Deut. x:15); that He is near them, but not near others (Deut. iv:7); that\nto them alone He has given just laws (Deut. iv:8); and, lastly, that He has\nmarked them out before others (Deut. iv:32); it speaks only according to the\nunderstanding of its hearers, who, as we have shown in the last chapter, and\nas Moses also testifies (Deut. ix:6, 7), knew not true blessedness. (6) For\nin good sooth they would have been no less blessed if God had called all men\nequally to salvation, nor would God have been less present to them for being\nequally present to others; their laws, would have been no less just if they\nhad been ordained for all, and they themselves would have been no less wise.\n(7) The miracles would have shown God's power no less by being wrought for\nother nations also; lastly, the Hebrews would have been just as much bound\nto worship God if He had bestowed all these gifts equally on all men.\n(8) When God tells Solomon (1 Kings iii:12) that no one shall be as wise as\nhe in time to come, it seems to be only a manner of expressing surpassing\nwisdom; it is little to be believed that God would have promised Solomon,\nfor his greater happiness, that He would never endow anyone with so much\nwisdom in time to come; this would in no wise have increased Solomon's\nintellect, and the wise king would have given equal thanks to the Lord if\neveryone had been gifted with the same faculties.\n(9) Still, though we assert that Moses, in the passages of the Pentateuch\njust cited, spoke only according to the understanding of the Hebrews, we\nhave no wish to deny that God ordained the Mosaic law for them alone, nor\nthat He spoke to them alone, nor that they witnessed marvels beyond those\nwhich happened to any other nation; but we wish to emphasize that\nMoses desired to admonish the Hebrews in such a manner, and with such\nreasonings as would appeal most forcibly to their childish understanding,\nand constrain them to worship the Deity. (10) Further, we wished to show\nthat the Hebrews did not surpass other nations in knowledge, or in piety,\nbut evidently in some attribute different from these; or (to speak like the\nScriptures, according to their understanding), that the Hebrews were not\nchosen by God before others for the sake of the true life and sublime ideas,\nthough they were often thereto admonished, but with some other object. (11)\nWhat that object was, I will duly show.\n(12) But before I begin, I wish in a few words to explain what I mean by the\nguidance of God, by the help of God, external and inward, and, lastly, what\nI understand by fortune.\n(13) By the help of God, I mean the fixed and unchangeable order of nature\nor the chain of natural events: for I have said before and shown elsewhere\nthat the universal laws of nature, according to which all things exist and\nare determined, are only another name for the eternal decrees of God, which\nalways involve eternal truth and necessity.\n(14) So that to say that everything happens according to natural laws, and\nto say that everything is ordained by the decree and ordinance of God, is\nthe same thing. (15) Now since the power in nature is identical with the\npower of God, by which alone all things happen and are determined, it\nfollows that whatsoever man, as a part of nature, provides himself with to\naid and preserve his existence, or whatsoever nature affords him without his\nhelp, is given to him solely by the Divine power, acting either through\nhuman nature or through external circumstance. (16) So whatever human nature\ncan furnish itself with by its own efforts to preserve its existence, may\nbe fitly called the inward aid of God, whereas whatever else accrues to\nman's profit from outward causes may be called the external aid of God.\n(17) We can now easily understand what is meant by the election of God. (18)\nFor since no one can do anything save by the predetermined order of nature,\nthat is by God's eternal ordinance and decree, it follows that no one can\nchoose a plan of life for himself, or accomplish any work save by God's\nvocation choosing him for the work or the plan of life in question, rather\nthan any other. (19) Lastly, by fortune, I mean the ordinance of God in so\nfar as it directs human life through external and unexpected means. (20)\nWith these preliminaries I return to my purpose of discovering the reason\nwhy the Hebrews were said to be elected by God before other nations, and\nwith the demonstration I thus proceed.\n(21) All objects of legitimate desire fall, generally speaking, under one\nof these three categories:\n1. The knowledge of things through their primary causes.\n2. The government of the passions, or the acquirement of the habit of\nvirtue.\n3. Secure and healthy life.\n(22) The means which most directly conduce towards the first two of these\nends, and which may be considered their proximate and efficient causes are\ncontained in human nature itself, so that their acquisition hinges only on\nour own power, and on the laws of human nature. (23) It may be concluded\nthat these gifts are not peculiar to any nation, but have always been shared\nby the whole human race, unless, indeed, we would indulge the dream that\nnature formerly created men of different kinds. (24) But the means which\nconduce to security and health are chiefly in external circumstance, and are\ncalled the gifts of fortune because they depend chiefly on objective causes\nof which we are ignorant; for a fool may be almost as liable to happiness\nor unhappiness as a wise man. (25) Nevertheless, human management and\nwatchfulness can greatly assist towards living in security and warding off\nthe injuries of our fellow-men, and even of beasts. (26) Reason and\nexperience show no more certain means of attaining this object than\nthe formation of a society with fixed laws, the occupation of a strip of\nterritory and the concentration of all forces, as it were, into one body,\nthat is the social body. (27) Now for forming and preserving a society, no\nordinary ability and care is required: that society will be most\nsecure, most stable, and least liable to reverses, which is founded and\ndirected by far-seeing and careful men; while, on the other hand, a society\nconstituted by men without trained skill, depends in a great measure on\nfortune, and is less constant. (28) If, in spite of all, such a society\nlasts a long time, it is owing to some other directing influence than its\nown; if it overcomes great perils and its affairs prosper, it will perforce\nmarvel at and adore the guiding Spirit of God (in so far, that is, as God\nworks through hidden means, and not through the nature and mind of man),\nfor everything happens to it unexpectedly and contrary to anticipation, it\nmay even be said and thought to be by miracle. (29) Nations, then, are\ndistinguished from one another in respect to the social organization and the\nlaws under which they live and are governed; the Hebrew nation was not\nchosen by God in respect to its wisdom nor its tranquillity of mind, but in\nrespect to its social organization and the good fortune with which it\nobtained supremacy and kept it so many years. (30) This is abundantly clear\nfrom Scripture. Even a cursory perusal will show us that the only respects\nin which the Hebrews surpassed other nations, are in their successful\nconduct of matters relating to government, and in their surmounting great\nperils solely by God's external aid; in other ways they were on a par with\ntheir fellows, and God was equally gracious to all. (31) For in respect to\nintellect (as we have shown in the last chapter) they held very ordinary\nideas about God and nature, so that they cannot have been God's chosen in\nthis respect; nor were they so chosen in respect of virtue and the true\nlife, for here again they, with the exception of a very few elect, were on\nan equality with other nations: therefore their choice and vocation\nconsisted only in the temporal happiness and advantages of independent rule.\n(32) In fact, we do not see that God promised anything beyond this to the\npatriarchs [Endnote 4] or their successors; in the law no other reward is\noffered for obedience than the continual happiness of an independent\ncommonwealth and other goods of this life; while, on the other hand, against\ncontumacy and the breaking of the covenant is threatened the downfall of the\ncommonwealth and great hardships. (33) Nor is this to be wondered at; for\nthe ends of every social organization and commonwealth are (as appears from\nwhat we have said, and as we will explain more at length hereafter) security\nand comfort; a commonwealth can only exist by the laws being binding on all.\n(34) If all the members of a state wish to disregard the law, by that very\nfact they dissolve the state and destroy the commonwealth. (35) Thus, the\nonly reward which could be promised to the Hebrews for continued obedience\nto the law was security [Endnote 5] and its attendant advantages, while no\nsurer punishment could be threatened for disobedience, than the ruin of the\nstate and the evils which generally follow therefrom, in addition to such\nfurther consequences as might accrue to the Jews in particular from the ruin\nof their especial state. (36) But there is no need here to go into this\npoint at more length. (37) I will only add that the laws of the Old\nTestament were revealed and ordained to the Jews only, for as God chose them\nin respect to the special constitution of their society and government, they\nmust, of course, have had special laws. (38) Whether God ordained special\nlaws for other nations also, and revealed Himself to their lawgivers\nprophetically, that is, under the attributes by which the latter were\naccustomed to imagine Him, I cannot sufficiently determine. (39) It is\nevident from Scripture itself that other nations acquired supremacy and\nparticular laws by the external aid of God; witness only the two following\npassages:\n(40) In Genesis xiv:18, 19, 20, it is related that Melchisedek was king of\nJerusalem and priest of the Most High God, that in exercise of his priestly\nfunctions he blessed Abraham, and that Abraham the beloved of the Lord gave\nto this priest of God a tithe of all his spoils. (41) This sufficiently\nshows that before He founded the Israelitish nation God constituted kings\nand priests in Jerusalem, and ordained for them rites and laws. (42) Whether\nHe did so prophetically is, as I have said, not sufficiently clear; but I am\nsure of this, that Abraham, whilst he sojourned in the city, lived\nscrupulously according to these laws, for Abraham had received no special\nrites from God; and yet it is stated (Gen. xxvi:5), that he observed the\nworship, the precepts, the statutes, and the laws of God, which must be\ninterpreted to mean the worship, the statutes, the precepts, and the laws of\nking Melchisedek. (43) Malachi chides the Jews as follows (i:10-11.): \"Who\nis there among you that will shut the doors? [of the Temple]; neither do ye\nkindle fire on mine altar for nought. (44) I have no pleasure in you, saith\nthe Lord of Hosts. (45) For from the rising of the sun, even until the going\ndown of the same My Name shall be great among the Gentiles; and in every\nplace incense shall be offered in My Name, and a pure offering; for My Name\nis great among the heathen, saith the Lord of Hosts.\" (46) These words,\nwhich, unless we do violence to them, could only refer to the current\nperiod, abundantly testify that the Jews of that time were not more beloved\nby God than other nations, that God then favoured other nations with more\nmiracles than He vouchsafed to the Jews, who had then partly recovered their\nempire without miraculous aid; and, lastly, that the Gentiles possessed\nrites and ceremonies acceptable to God. (47) But I pass over these points\nlightly: it is enough for my purpose to have shown that the election of the\nJews had regard to nothing but temporal physical happiness and freedom, in\nother words, autonomous government, and to the manner and means by which\nthey obtained it; consequently to the laws in so far as they were\nnecessary to the preservation of that special government; and, lastly, to\nthe manner in which they were revealed. In regard to other matters, wherein\nman's true happiness consists, they were on a par with the rest of the\nnations.\n(48) When, therefore, it is said in Scripture (Deut. iv:7) that the Lord is\nnot so nigh to any other nation as He is to the Jews, reference is only made\nto their government, and to the period when so many miracles happened to\nthem, for in respect of intellect and virtue - that is, in respect of\nblessedness - God was, as we have said already, and are now demonstrating,\nequally gracious to all. (49) Scripture itself bears testimony to this fact,\nfor the Psalmist says (cxlv:18), \"The Lord is near unto all them that call\nupon Him, to all that call upon Him in truth.\" (50) So in the same Psalm,\nverse 9, \"The Lord is good to all, and His tender mercies are over all\nHis works.\" In Ps. xxxiii:16, it is clearly stated that God has granted to\nall men the same intellect, in these words, \"He fashioneth their hearts\nalike.\" The heart was considered by the Hebrews, as I suppose everyone\nknows, to be the seat of the soul and the intellect.\n(51) Lastly, from Job xxxviii:28, it is plain that God had ordained for the\nwhole human race the law to reverence God, to keep from evil doing, or to do\nwell, and that Job, although a Gentile, was of all men most acceptable to\nGod, because he exceeded all in piety and religion. (52) Lastly, from Jonah\niv:2, it is very evident that, not only to the Jews but to all men, God was\ngracious, merciful, long-suffering, and of great goodness, and repented Him\nof the evil, for Jonah says: \"Therefore I determined to flee before unto\nTarshish, for I know that Thou art a gracious God, and merciful, slow to\nanger, and of great kindness,\" &c., and that, therefore, God would pardon\nthe Ninevites. (53) We conclude, therefore (inasmuch as God is to all men\nequally gracious, and the Hebrews were only chosen by him in respect to\ntheir social organization and government), that the individual Jew, taken\napart from his social organization and government, possessed no\ngift of God above other men, and that there was no difference between Jew\nand Gentile. (54) As it is a fact that God is equally gracious, merciful,\nand the rest, to all men; and as the function of the prophet was to teach\nmen not so much the laws of their country, as true virtue, and to exhort\nthem thereto, it is not to be doubted that all nations possessed prophets,\nand that the prophetic gift was not peculiar to the Jews. (55) Indeed,\nhistory, both profane and sacred, bears witness to the fact. (56) Although,\nfrom the sacred histories of the Old Testament, it is not evident that the\nother nations had as many prophets as the Hebrews, or that any Gentile\nprophet was expressly sent by God to the nations, this does not affect the\nquestion, for the Hebrews were careful to record their own affairs, not\nthose of other nations. (57) It suffices, then, that we find in the Old\nTestament Gentiles, and uncircumcised, as Noah, Enoch, Abimelech,\nBalaam, &c., exercising prophetic gifts; further, that Hebrew prophets were\nsent by God, not only to their own nation but to many others also. (58)\nEzekiel prophesied to all the nations then known; Obadiah to none, that we\nare aware of, save the Idumeans; and Jonah was chiefly the prophet to the\nNinevites. (59) Isaiah bewails and predicts the calamities, and hails the\nrestoration not only of the Jews but also of other nations, for he says\n(chap. xvi:9), \"Therefore I will bewail Jazer with weeping;\" and in chap.\nxix. he foretells first the calamities and then the restoration of\nthe Egyptians (see verses 19, 20, 21, 25), saying that God shall send them a\nSaviour to free them, that the Lord shall be known in Egypt, and, further,\nthat the Egyptians shall worship God with sacrifice and oblation; and, at\nlast, he calls that nation the blessed Egyptian people of God; all of which\nparticulars are specially noteworthy.\n(60) Jeremiah is called, not the prophet of the Hebrew nation, but simply\nthe prophet of the nations (see Jer. i.5). (61) He also mournfully foretells\nthe calamities of the nations, and predicts their restoration, for he says\n(xlviii. 31) of the Moabites, \"Therefore will I howl for Moab, and I will\ncry out for all Moab\" (verse 36), \"and therefore mine heart shall sound\nfor Moab like pipes;\" in the end he prophesies their restoration, as also\nthe restoration of the Egyptians, Ammonites, and Elamites. (62) Wherefore it\nis beyond doubt that other nations also, like the Jews, had their\nprophets, who prophesied to them.\n(63) Although Scripture only, makes mention of one man, Balaam, to whom the\nfuture of the Jews and the other nations was revealed, we must not suppose\nthat Balaam prophesied only once, for from the narrative itself it is\nabundantly clear that he had long previously been famous for prophesy and\nother Divine gifts. (64) For when Balak bade him to come to him, he said\n(Num. xxii:6), \"For I know that he whom thou blessest is blessed, and he\nwhom thou cursest is cursed.\" (65) Thus we see that he possessed the gift\nwhich God had bestowed on Abraham. Further, as accustomed to prophesy,\nBalaam bade the messengers wait for him till the will of the Lord was\nrevealed to him. (66) When he prophesied, that is, when he interpreted\nthe true mind of God, he was wont to say this of himself: \"He hath said,\nwhich heard the words of God and knew the knowledge of the Most High, which\nsaw the vision of the Almighty falling into a trance, but having his eyes\nopen.\" (67) Further, after he had blessed the Hebrews by the command of God,\nhe began (as was his custom) to prophesy to other nations, and to predict\ntheir future; all of which abundantly shows that he had always been a\nprophet, or had often prophesied, and (as we may also remark here) possessed\nthat which afforded the chief certainty to prophets of the truth of their\nprophecy, namely, a mind turned wholly to what is right and good, for he did\nnot bless those whom he wished to bless, nor curse those whom he wished to\ncurse, as Balak supposed, but only those whom God wished to be blessed or\ncursed. (68) Thus he answered Balak: \"If Balak should give me his house full\nof silver and gold, I cannot go beyond the commandment of the Lord to do\neither good or bad of my own mind; but what the Lord saith, that will I\nspeak.\" (69) As for God being angry with him in the way, the same happened\nto Moses when he set out to Egypt by the command of the Lord; and as to his\nreceiving money for prophesying, Samuel did the same (1 Sam. ix:7, 8); if in\nanyway he sinned, \"there is not a just man upon earth that doeth good and\nsinneth not,\" Eccles. vii:20. (Vide 2 Epist. Peter ii:15, 16, and\nJude 5:11.)\n(70) His speeches must certainly have had much weight with God, and His\npower for cursing must assuredly have been very great from the number of\ntimes that we find stated in Scripture, in proof of God's great mercy to the\nJews, that God would not hear Balaam, and that He changed the cursing to\nblessing (see Deut. xxiii:6, Josh. xxiv:10, Neh. xiii:2). (71) Wherefore he\nwas without doubt most acceptable to God, for the speeches and cursings of\nthe wicked move God not at all. (72) As then he was a true prophet, and\nnevertheless Joshua calls him a soothsayer or augur, it is certain that this\ntitle had an honourable signification, and that those whom the Gentiles\ncalled augurs and soothsayers were true prophets, while those whom Scripture\noften accuses and condemns were false soothsayers, who deceived the\nGentiles as false prophets deceived the Jews; indeed, this is made evident\nfrom other passages in the Bible, whence we conclude that the gift of\nprophecy was not peculiar to the Jews, but common to all nations. (73) The\nPharisees, however, vehemently contend that this Divine gift was peculiar to\ntheir nation, and that the other nations foretold the future (what will\nsuperstition invent next?) by some unexplained diabolical faculty. (74) The\nprincipal passage of Scripture which they cite, by way of confirming their\ntheory with its authority, is Exodus xxxiii:16, where Moses says to God,\n\"For wherein shall it be known here that I and Thy people have found grace\nin Thy sight? is it not in that Thou goest with us? so shall we be\nseparated, I and Thy people, from all the people that are upon the face of\nthe earth.\" (75) From this they would infer that Moses asked of God that He\nshould be present to the Jews, and should reveal Himself to them\nprophetically; further, that He should grant this favour to no other nation.\n(76) It is surely absurd that Moses should have been jealous of God's\npresence among the Gentiles, or that he should have dared to ask any such\nthing. (77) The fact is, as Moses knew that the disposition and spirit of his\nnation was rebellious, he clearly saw that they could not carry out what\nthey had begun without very great miracles and special external aid from\nGod; nay, that without such aid they must necessarily perish: as it was\nevident that God wished them to be preserved, he asked for this special\nexternal aid. (78) Thus he says (Ex. xxxiv:9), \"If now I have found grace in\nThy sight, O Lord, let my Lord, I pray Thee, go among us; for it is a\nstiffnecked people.\" (79) The reason, therefore, for his seeking special\nexternal aid from God was the stiffneckedness of the people, and it is made\nstill more plain, that he asked for nothing beyond this special external aid\nby God's answer - for God answered at once (verse 10 of the same chapter) -\n\"Behold, I make a covenant: before all Thy people I will do marvels, such as\nhave not been done in all the earth, nor in any nation.\" (80) Therefore\nMoses had in view nothing beyond the special election of the Jews, as I have\nexplained it, and made no other request to God. (81) I confess that in\nPaul's Epistle to the Romans, I find another text which carries more weight,\nnamely, where Paul seems to teach a different doctrine from that here set\ndown, for he there says (Rom. iii:1): \"What advantage then hath the Jew? or\nwhat profit is there of circumcision? (82) Much every way: chiefly, because\nthat unto them were committed the oracles of God.\"\n(83) But if we look to the doctrine which Paul especially desired to teach,\nwe shall find nothing repugnant to our present contention; on the contrary,\nhis doctrine is the same as ours, for he says (Rom. iii:29) \"that God is the\nGod of the Jews and of the Gentiles, and\" (ch. ii:25, 26) \"But,\nif thou be a breaker of the law, thy circumcision is made uncircumcision.\n(84) Therefore if the uncircumcision keep the righteousness of the law,\nshall not his uncircumcision be counted for circumcision?\" (85) Further, in\nchap. iv:verse 9, he says that all alike, Jew and Gentile, were under sin,\nand that without commandment and law there is no sin. (86) Wherefore it is\nmost evident that to all men absolutely was revealed the law under which all\nlived - namely, the law which has regard only to true virtue, not the law\nestablished in respect to, and in the formation of a particular state and\nadapted to the disposition of a particular people. (87) Lastly, Paul\nconcludes that since God is the God of all nations, that is, is equally\ngracious to all, and since all men equally live under the law and under sin,\nso also to all nations did God send His Christ, to free all men equally from\nthe bondage of the law, that they should no more do right by the\ncommand of the law, but by the constant determination of their hearts. (88)\nSo that Paul teaches exactly the same as ourselves. (89) When, therefore, he\nsays \"To the Jews only were entrusted the oracles of God,\" we must either\nunderstand that to them only were the laws entrusted in writing, while they\nwere given to other nations merely in revelation and conception, or else (as\nnone but Jews would object to the doctrine he desired to advance) that Paul\nwas answering only in accordance with the understanding and current ideas of\nthe Jews, for in respect to teaching things which he had partly seen, partly\nheard, he was to the Greeks a Greek, and to the Jews a Jew.\n(90) It now only remains to us to answer the arguments of those who would\npersuade themselves that the election of the Jews was not temporal, and\nmerely in respect of their commonwealth, but eternal; for, they say, we see\nthe Jews after the loss of their commonwealth, and after being scattered so\nmany years and separated from all other nations, still surviving, which is\nwithout parallel among other peoples, and further the Scriptures seem to\nteach that God has chosen for Himself the Jews for ever, so that though they\nhave lost their commonwealth, they still nevertheless remain God's elect.\n(91) The passages which they think teach most clearly this eternal election, are chiefly:\n(1.) Jer. xxxi:36, where the prophet testifies that the seed of Israel\nshall for ever remain the nation of God, comparing them with the\nstability of the heavens and nature;\n(2.) Ezek. xx:32, where the prophet seems to intend that though the Jews\nwanted after the help afforded them to turn their backs on the worship of\nthe Lord, that God would nevertheless gather them together again from all\nthe lands in which they were dispersed, and lead them to the wilderness of\nthe peoples - as He had led their fathers to the wilderness of the land of\nEgypt - and would at length, after purging out from among them the rebels\nand transgressors, bring them thence to his Holy mountain, where the whole\nhouse of Israel should worship Him. Other passages are also cited,\nespecially by the Pharisees, but I think I shall satisfy everyone if I\nanswer these two, and this I shall easily accomplish after showing from\nScripture itself that God chose not the Hebrews for ever, but only on the\ncondition under which He had formerly chosen the Canaanites, for these last,\nas we have shown, had priests who religiously worshipped God, and whom God\nat length rejected because of their luxury, pride, and corrupt worship.\n(92) Moses (Lev. xviii:27) warned the Israelites that they be not polluted\nwith whoredoms, lest the land spue them out as it had spued out the nations\nwho had dwelt there before, and in Deut. viii:19, 20, in the plainest terms\nHe threatens their total ruin, for He says, \"I testify against you that ye\nshall surely perish. (93) As the nations which the Lord destroyeth before\nyour face, so shall ye perish.\" In like manner many other passages are found\nin the law which expressly show that God chose the Hebrews neither\nabsolutely nor for ever. (94) If, then, the prophets foretold for them a new\ncovenant of the knowledge of God, love, and grace, such a promise is easily\nproved to be only made to the elect, for Ezekiel in the chapter which we\nhave just quoted expressly says that God will separate from them the\nrebellious and transgressors, and Zephaniah (iii:12, 13), says that \"God\nwill take away the proud from the midst of them, and leave the poor.\" (95)\nNow, inasmuch as their election has regard to true virtue, it is not to be\nthought that it was promised to the Jews alone to the exclusion of others,\nbut we must evidently believe that the true Gentile prophets (and every\nnation, as we have shown, possessed such) promised the same to the faithful\nof their own people, who were thereby comforted. (96) Wherefore this eternal\ncovenant of the knowledge of God and love is universal, as is clear,\nmoreover, from Zeph. iii:10, 11: no difference in this respect can be\nadmitted between Jew and Gentile, nor did the former enjoy any special\nelection beyond that which we have pointed out.\n(97) When the prophets, in speaking of this election which regards only true\nvirtue, mixed up much concerning sacrifices and ceremonies, and the\nrebuilding of the temple and city, they wished by such figurative\nexpressions, after the manner and nature of prophecy, to expound matters\nspiritual, so as at the same time to show to the Jews, whose prophets they\nwere, the true restoration of the state and of the temple to be expected\nabout the time of Cyrus.\n(98) At the present time, therefore, there is absolutely nothing which the\nJews can arrogate to themselves beyond other people.\n(99) As to their continuance so long after dispersion and the loss of\nempire, there is nothing marvellous in it, for they so separated themselves\nfrom every other nation as to draw down upon themselves universal hate, not\nonly by their outward rites, rites conflicting with those of other nations,\nbut also by the sign of circumcision which they most scrupulously observe.\n(100) That they have been preserved in great measure by Gentile hatred,\nexperience demonstrates. (101) When the king of Spain formerly\ncompelled the Jews to embrace the State religion or to go into exile, a\nlarge number of Jews accepted Catholicism. (102) Now, as these renegades\nwere admitted to all the native privileges of Spaniards, and deemed worthy\nof filling all honourable offices, it came to pass that they straightway\nbecame so intermingled with the Spaniards as to leave of themselves no relic\nor remembrance. (103) But exactly the opposite happened to those whom the\nking of Portugal compelled to become Christians, for they always, though\nconverted, lived apart, inasmuch as they were considered unworthy of any\ncivic honours.\n(104) The sign of circumcision is, as I think, so important, that I could\npersuade myself that it alone would preserve the nation for ever. (105) Nay,\nI would go so far as to believe that if the foundations of their religion\nhave not emasculated their minds they may even, if occasion offers, so\nchangeable are human affairs, raise up their empire afresh, and that God may\na second time elect them.\n(106) Of such a possibility we have a very famous example in the Chinese.\n(107) They, too, have some distinctive mark on their heads which they most\nscrupulously observe, and by which they keep themselves apart from everyone\nelse, and have thus kept themselves during so many thousand years that they\nfar surpass all other nations in antiquity. (108) They have not always\nretained empire, but they have recovered it when lost, and doubtless will do\nso again after the spirit of the Tartars becomes relaxed through the luxury\nof riches and pride.\n(109) Lastly, if any one wishes to maintain that the Jews, from this or from\nany other cause, have been chosen by God for ever, I will not gainsay him if\nhe will admit that this choice, whether temporary or eternal, has no regard,\nin so far as it is peculiar to the Jews, to aught but dominion and physical\nadvantages (for by such alone can one nation be distinguished from\nanother), whereas in regard to intellect and true virtue, every nation is on\na par with the rest, and God has not in these respects chosen one people\nrather than another.\nCHAPTER IV. - OF THE DIVINE LAW.\n(1) The word law, taken in the abstract, means that by which an individual,\nor all things, or as many things as belong to a particular species, act in\none and the same fixed and definite manner, which manner depends either on\nnatural necessity or on human decree. (2) A law which depends on natural\nnecessity is one which necessarily follows from the nature, or from the\ndefinition of the thing in question; a law which depends on human decree,\nand which is more correctly called an ordinance, is one which men have laid\ndown for themselves and others in order to live more safely or conveniently,\nor from some similar reason.\n(3) For example, the law that all bodies impinging on lesser bodies, lose as\nmuch of their own motion as they communicate to the latter is a universal\nlaw of all bodies, and depends on natural necessity. (4) So, too, the law\nthat a man in remembering one thing, straightway remembers another either\nlike it, or which he had perceived simultaneously with it, is a law which\nnecessarily follows from the nature of man. (5) But the law that men must\nyield, or be compelled to yield, somewhat of their natural right, and that\nthey bind themselves to live in a certain way, depends on human decree. (6)\nNow, though I freely admit that all things are predetermined by universal\nnatural laws to exist and operate in a given, fixed, and definite\nmanner, I still assert that the laws I have just mentioned depend on human\ndecree.\n(1.) (7) Because man, in so far as he is a part of nature, constitutes a\npart of the power of nature. (8) Whatever, therefore, follows necessarily\nfrom the necessity of human nature (that is, from nature herself, in so far\nas we conceive of her as acting through man) follows, even though it be\nnecessarily, from human power. (9) Hence the sanction of such laws may very\nwell be said to depend on man's decree, for it principally depends on the\npower of the human mind; so that the human mind in respect to its perception\nof things as true and false, can readily be conceived as without such laws,\nbut not without necessary law as we have just defined it.\n(2.) (10) I have stated that these laws depend on human decree because it is\nwell to define and explain things by their proximate causes. (11) The\ngeneral consideration of fate and the concatenation of causes would aid us\nvery little in forming and arranging our ideas concerning particular\nquestions. (12) Let us add that as to the actual coordination and\nconcatenation of things, that is how things are ordained and linked\ntogether, we are obviously ignorant; therefore, it is more profitable for\nright living, nay, it is necessary for us to consider things as contingent.\n(13) So much about law in the abstract.\n(14) Now the word law seems to be only applied to natural phenomena by\nanalogy, and is commonly taken to signify a command which men can either\nobey or neglect, inasmuch as it restrains human nature within certain\noriginally exceeded limits, and therefore lays down no rule beyond human\nstrength. (15) Thus it is expedient to define law more particularly as a\nplan of life laid down by man for himself or others with a certain object.\n(16) However, as the true object of legislation is only perceived by a few,\nand most men are almost incapable of grasping it, though they live under its\nconditions, legislators, with a view to exacting general obedience, have\nwisely put forward another object, very different from that which\nnecessarily follows from the nature of law: they promise to the observers of\nthe law that which the masses chiefly desire, and threaten its violators\nwith that which they chiefly fear: thus endeavouring to restrain the masses,\nas far as may be, like a horse with a curb; whence it follows that the word\nlaw is chiefly applied to the modes of life enjoined on men by the sway of\nothers; hence those who obey the law are said to live under it and to be\nunder compulsion. (17) In truth, a man who renders everyone their due\nbecause he fears the gallows, acts under the sway and compulsion of others,\nand cannot be called just. (18) But a man who does the same from a knowledge\nof the true reason for laws and their necessity, acts from a firm purpose\nand of his own accord, and is therefore properly called just. (19) This, I\ntake it, is Paul's meaning when he says, that those who live under the law\ncannot be justified through the law, for justice, as commonly defined, is\nthe constant and perpetual will to render every man his due. (20) Thus\nSolomon says (Prov. xxi:15), \"It is a joy to the just to do judgment,\" but\nthe wicked fear.\n(21) Law, then, being a plan of living which men have for a certain object\nlaid down for themselves or others, may, as it seems, be divided into human\nlaw and Divine law.\n(22) By human law I mean a plan of living which serves only to render life\nand the state secure. (23) By Divine law I mean that which only regards the\nhighest good, in other words, the true knowledge of God and love.\n(24) I call this law Divine because of the nature of the highest good, which\nI will here shortly explain as clearly as I can.\n(25) Inasmuch as the intellect is the best part of our being, it is evident\nthat we should make every effort to perfect it as far as possible if we\ndesire to search for what is really profitable to us. (26) For in\nintellectual perfection the highest good should consist. (27) Now, since all\nour knowledge, and the certainty which removes every doubt, depend solely on\nthe knowledge of God;- firstly, because without God nothing can exist or be\nconceived; secondly, because so long as we have no clear and distinct idea\nof God we may remain in universal doubt - it follows that our highest good\nand perfection also depend solely on the knowledge of God. (28) Further,\nsince without God nothing can exist or be conceived, it is evident that all\nnatural phenomena involve and express the conception of God as far as their\nessence and perfection extend, so that we have greater and more perfect\nknowledge of God in proportion to our knowledge of natural phenomena:\nconversely (since the knowledge of an effect through its cause is the same\nthing as the knowledge of a particular property of a cause) the greater our\nknowledge of natural phenomena, the more perfect is our knowledge of the\nessence of God (which is the cause of all things). (29) So, then, our\nhighest good not only depends on the knowledge of God, but wholly consists\ntherein; and it further follows that man is perfect or the reverse in\nproportion to the nature and perfection of the object of his special desire;\nhence the most perfect and the chief sharer in the highest blessedness is he\nwho prizes above all else, and takes especial delight in, the intellectual\nknowledge of God, the most perfect Being.\n(30) Hither, then, our highest good and our highest blessedness aim -\nnamely, to the knowledge and love of God; therefore the means demanded by\nthis aim of all human actions, that is, by God in so far as the idea of him\nis in us, may be called the commands of God, because they proceed, as it\nwere, from God Himself, inasmuch as He exists in our minds, and the plan of\nlife which has regard to this aim may be fitly called the law of God.\n(31) The nature of the means, and the plan of life which this aim demands,\nhow the foundations of the best states follow its lines, and how men's life\nis conducted, are questions pertaining to general ethics. (32) Here I only\nproceed to treat of the Divine law in a particular application.\n(33) As the love of God is man's highest happiness and blessedness, and the\nultimate end and aim of all human actions, it follows that he alone lives by\nthe Divine law who loves God not from fear of punishment, or from love of\nany other object, such as sensual pleasure, fame, or the like; but solely\nbecause he has knowledge of God, or is convinced that the knowledge and love\nof God is the highest good. (34) The sum and chief precept, then, of the\nDivine law is to love God as the highest good, namely, as we have said, not\nfrom fear of any pains and penalties, or from the love of any other object\nin which we desire to take pleasure. (35) The idea of God lays down\nthe rule that God is our highest good - in other words, that the knowledge\nand love of God is the ultimate aim to which all our actions should be\ndirected. (36) The worldling cannot understand these things, they appear\nfoolishness to him, because he has too meager a knowledge of God, and also\nbecause in this highest good he can discover nothing which he can handle or\neat, or which affects the fleshly appetites wherein he chiefly delights, for\nit consists solely in thought and the pure reason. (37) They, on the other\nhand, who know that they possess no greater gift than intellect and sound\nreason, will doubtless accept what I have said without question.\n(38) We have now explained that wherein the Divine law chiefly consists, and\nwhat are human laws, namely, all those which have a different aim\nunless they have been ratified by revelation, for in this respect also\nthings are referred to God (as we have shown above) and in this sense the\nlaw of Moses, although it was not universal, but entirely adapted to the\ndisposition and particular preservation of a single people, may yet be\ncalled a law of God or Divine law, inasmuch as we believe that it was\nratified by prophetic insight. (39) If we consider the nature of natural\nDivine law as we have just explained it, we shall see:\n(40) I.- That it is universal or common to all men, for we have deduced it\nfrom universal human nature.\n(41) II. That it does not depend on the truth of any historical narrative\nwhatsoever, for inasmuch as this natural Divine law is comprehended solely\nby the consideration of human nature, it is plain that we can conceive it as\nexisting as well in Adam as in any other man, as well in a man living among\nhis fellows, as in a man who lives by himself.\n(42) The truth of a historical narrative, however assured, cannot give us\nthe knowledge nor consequently the love of God, for love of God springs from\nknowledge of Him, and knowledge of Him should be derived from general ideas,\nin themselves certain and known, so that the truth of a historical narrative\nis very far from being a necessary requisite for our attaining our highest\ngood.\n(43) Still, though the truth of histories cannot give us the knowledge and\nlove of God, I do not deny that reading them is very useful with a view to\nlife in the world, for the more we have observed and known of men's customs\nand circumstances, which are best revealed by their actions, the more warily\nwe shall be able to order our lives among them, and so far as reason\ndictates to adapt our actions to their dispositions.\n(44) III. We see that this natural Divine law does not demand the\nperformance of ceremonies - that is, actions in themselves indifferent,\nwhich are called good from the fact of their institution, or actions\nsymbolizing something profitable for salvation, or (if one prefers this\ndefinition) actions of which the meaning surpasses human understanding. (45)\nThe natural light of reason does not demand anything which it is itself\nunable to supply, but only such as it can very clearly show to be good, or a\nmeans to our blessedness. (46) Such things as are good simply because they\nhave been commanded or instituted, or as being symbols of something good,\nare mere shadows which cannot be reckoned among actions that are the\noffsprings as it were, or fruit of a sound mind and of intellect. (47) There\nis no need for me to go into this now in more detail.\n(48) IV. Lastly, we see that the highest reward of the Divine law is the law\nitself, namely, to know God and to love Him of our free choice, and with an\nundivided and fruitful spirit; while its penalty is the absence of these\nthings, and being in bondage to the flesh - that is, having an inconstant\nand wavering spirit.\n(49) These points being noted, I must now inquire:\n(50) I. Whether by the natural light of reason we can conceive of\nGod as a law-giver or potentate ordaining laws for men?\n(51) II. What is the teaching of Holy Writ concerning this\nnatural light of reason and natural law?\n(52) III. With what objects were ceremonies formerly instituted?\n(53) IV. Lastly, what is the good gained by knowing the\nsacred histories and believing them?\n(54) Of the first two I will treat in this chapter, of the remaining two\nin the following one.\n(55) Our conclusion about the first is easily deduced from the nature of\nGod's will, which is only distinguished from His understanding in relation\nto our intellect - that is, the will and the understanding of God are in\nreality one and the same, and are only distinguished in relation to\nour thoughts which we form concerning God's understanding. (56) For\ninstance, if we are only looking to the fact that the nature of a triangle\nis from eternity contained in the Divine nature as an eternal verity, we say\nthat God possesses the idea of a triangle, or that He understands the\nnature of a triangle; but if afterwards we look to the fact that the nature\nof a triangle is thus contained in the Divine nature, solely by the\nnecessity of the Divine nature, and not by the necessity of the nature and\nessence of a triangle - in fact, that the necessity of a triangle's essence\nand nature, in so far as they are conceived of as eternal verities, depends\nsolely on the necessity of the Divine nature and intellect, we then style\nGod's will or decree, that which before we styled His intellect. (57)\nWherefore we make one and the same affirmation concerning God when we say\nthat He has from eternity decreed that three angles of a triangle are equal\nto two right angles, as when we say that He has understood it.\n(58) Hence the affirmations and the negations of God always involve\nnecessity or truth; so that, for example, if God said to Adam that He did\nnot wish him to eat of the tree of knowledge of good and evil, it would have\ninvolved a contradiction that Adam should have been able to eat of it, and\nwould therefore have been impossible that he should have so eaten, for the\nDivine command would have involved an eternal necessity and truth. (59) But\nsince Scripture nevertheless narrates that God did give this command to\nAdam, and yet that none the less Adam ate of the tree, we must perforce say\nthat God revealed to Adam the evil which would surely follow if he should\neat of the tree, but did not disclose that such evil would of necessity\ncome to pass. (60) Thus it was that Adam took the revelation to be not an\neternal and necessary truth, but a law - that is, an ordinance followed by\ngain or loss, not depending necessarily on the nature of the act performed,\nbut solely on the will and absolute power of some potentate, so that the\nrevelation in question was solely in relation to Adam, and solely through\nhis lack of knowledge a law, and God was, as it were, a lawgiver and\npotentate. (61) From the same cause, namely, from lack of knowledge, the\nDecalogue in relation to the Hebrews was a law, for since they knew not the\nexistence of God as an eternal truth, they must have taken as a law that\nwhich was revealed to them in the Decalogue, namely, that God exists, and\nthat God only should be worshipped. (62) But if God had spoken to them\nwithout the intervention of any bodily means, immediately they would have\nperceived it not as a law, but as an eternal truth.\n(63) What we have said about the Israelites and Adam, applies also to all\nthe prophets who wrote laws in God's name - they did not adequately conceive\nGod's decrees as eternal truths. (64) For instance, we must say of Moses\nthat from revelation, from the basis of what was revealed to him, he\nperceived the method by which the Israelitish nation could best be united in\na particular territory, and could form a body politic or state, and further\nthat he perceived the method by which that nation could best be constrained\nto obedience; but he did not perceive, nor was it revealed to him, that this\nmethod was absolutely the best, nor that the obedience of the people in a\ncertain strip of territory would necessarily imply the end he had in view.\n(65) Wherefore he perceived these things not as eternal truths, but as\nprecepts and ordinances, and he ordained them as laws of God, and thus it\ncame to be that he conceived God as a ruler, a legislator, a king, as\nmerciful, just, &c., whereas such qualities are simply attributes of human\nnature, and utterly alien from the nature of the Deity. (66)Thus much we may\naffirm of the prophets who wrote laws in the name of God; but we must not\naffirm it of Christ, for Christ, although He too seems to have written laws\nin the name of God, must be taken to have had a clear and adequate\nperception, for Christ was not so much a prophet as the mouthpiece of God.\n(67) For God made revelations to mankind through Christ as He had before\ndone through angels - that is, a created voice, visions, &c. (68) It would\nbe as unreasonable to say that God had accommodated his revelations to the\nopinions of Christ as that He had before accommodated them to the opinions\nof angels (that is, of a created voice or visions) as matters to be revealed\nto the prophets, a wholly absurd hypothesis. (69) Moreover, Christ was sent\nto teach not only the Jews but the whole human race, and therefore it was\nnot enough that His mind should be accommodated to the opinions the Jews\nalone, but also to the opinion and fundamental teaching common to the whole\nhuman race - in other words, to ideas universal and true. (70) Inasmuch as\nGod revealed Himself to Christ, or to Christ's mind immediately, and not as\nto the prophets through words and symbols, we must needs suppose that Christ\nperceived truly what was revealed, in other words, He understood it, for a\nmatter is understood when it is perceived simply by the mind without words\nor symbols.\n(71) Christ, then, perceived (truly and adequately) what was revealed, and\nif He ever proclaimed such revelations as laws, He did so because of the\nignorance and obstinacy of the people, acting in this respect the part of\nGod; inasmuch as He accommodated Himself to the comprehension of the\npeople, and though He spoke somewhat more clearly than the other prophets,\nyet He taught what was revealed obscurely, and generally through parables,\nespecially when He was speaking to those to whom it was not yet given to\nunderstand the kingdom of heaven. (See Matt. xiii:10, &c.) (72) To those to\nwhom it was given to understand the mysteries of heaven, He doubtless taught\nHis doctrines as eternal truths, and did not lay them down as laws, thus\nfreeing the minds of His hearers from the bondage of that law which He\nfurther confirmed and established. (73) Paul apparently points to this more\nthan once (e.g. Rom. vii:6, and iii:28), though he never himself seems to\nwish to speak openly, but, to quote his own words (Rom. iii:6, and vi:19),\n\"merely humanly.\" (74) This he expressly states when he calls God just, and\nit was doubtless in concession to human weakness that he attributes mercy,\ngrace, anger, and similar qualities to God, adapting his language to the\npopular mind, or, as he puts it (1 Cor. iii:1, 2), to carnal men. (75) In\nRom. ix:18, he teaches undisguisedly that God's auger and mercy depend not\non the actions of men, but on God's own nature or will; further, that no\none is justified by the works of the law, but only by faith, which he seems\nto identify with the full assent of the soul; lastly, that no one is blessed\nunless he have in him the mind of Christ (Rom. viii:9), whereby he perceives\nthe laws of God as eternal truths. (76) We conclude, therefore, that God is\ndescribed as a lawgiver or prince, and styled just, merciful, &c., merely in\nconcession to popular understanding, and the imperfection of popular\nknowledge; that in reality God acts and directs all things simply by the\nnecessity of His nature and perfection, and that His decrees and volitions\nare eternal truths, and always involve necessity. (77) So much for the first\npoint which I wished to explain and demonstrate.\n(78) Passing on to the second point, let us search the sacred pages for\ntheir teaching concerning the light of nature and this Divine law. (79) The\nfirst doctrine we find in the history of the first man, where it is narrated\nthat God commanded Adam not to eat of the fruit of the tree of the\nknowledge of good and evil; this seems to mean that God commanded Adam to do\nand to seek after righteousness because it was good, not because the\ncontrary was evil: that is, to seek the good for its own sake, not from fear\nof evil. (80) We have seen that he who acts rightly from the true knowledge\nand love of right, acts with freedom and constancy, whereas he who acts from\nfear of evil, is under the constraint of evil, and acts in bondage under\nexternal control. (81) So that this commandment of God to Adam comprehends\nthe whole Divine natural law, and absolutely agrees with the dictates of the\nlight of nature; nay, it would be easy to explain on this basis the whole\nhistory or allegory of the first man. (82) But I prefer to pass over the\nsubject in silence, because, in the first place, I cannot be absolutely\ncertain that my explanation would be in accordance with the intention of the\nsacred writer; and, secondly, because many do not admit that this history is\nan allegory, maintaining it to be a simple narrative of facts. (83) It will\nbe better, therefore, to adduce other passages of Scripture, especially such\nas were written by him, who speaks with all the strength of his natural\nunderstanding, in which he surpassed all his contemporaries, and whose\nsayings are accepted by the people as of equal weight with\nthose of the prophets. (84) I mean Solomon, whose prudence and wisdom are\ncommended in Scripture rather than his piety and gift of prophecy. (85) Life\nbeing taken to mean the true life (as is evident from Deut. xxx:19), the\nfruit of the understanding consists only in the true life, and its\nabsence constitutes punishment. (86) All this absolutely agrees with what\nwas set out in our fourth point concerning natural law. (87) Moreover our\nposition that it is the well-spring of life, and that the intellect alone\nlays down laws for the wise, is plainly taught by, the sage, for he says\n(Prov. xiii:14): \"The law of the wise is a fountain of life\" - that is, as\nwe gather from the preceding text, the understanding. (88) In chap. iii:13,\nhe expressly teaches that the understanding renders man blessed and happy,\nand gives him true peace of mind. \"Happy is the man that findeth wisdom, and\nthe man that getteth understanding,\" for \"Wisdom gives length of days, and\nriches and honour; her ways are ways of pleasantness, and all her paths\npeace\" (xiiii:6, 17). (89) According to Solomon, therefore, it is only,\nthe wise who live in peace and equanimity, not like the wicked whose minds\ndrift hither and thither, and (as Isaiah says, chap. lvii:20) \"are like the\ntroubled sea, for them there is no peace.\"\n(90) Lastly, we should especially note the passage in chap. ii. of Solomon's\nproverbs which most clearly confirms our contention: \"If thou criest after\nknowledge, and liftest up thy voice for understanding . . . then shalt thou\nunderstand the fear of the Lord, and find the knowledge of God; for the Lord\ngiveth wisdom; out of His mouth cometh knowledge and understanding.\"\n(91) These words clearly enunciate (1), that wisdom or intellect alone\nteaches us to fear God wisely - that is, to worship Him truly; (2), that\nwisdom and knowledge flow from God's mouth, and that God bestows on us this\ngift; this we have already shown in proving that our understanding and our\nknowledge depend on, spring from, and are perfected by the idea or\nknowledge of God, and nothing else. (92) Solomon goes on to say in so many\nwords that this knowledge contains and involves the true principles of\nethics and politics: \"When wisdom entereth into thy heart, and knowledge is\npleasant to thy soul, discretion shall preserve thee, understanding shall\nkeep thee, then shalt thou understand righteousness, and judgment, and\nequity, yea every good path.\" (93) All of which is in obvious agreement with\nnatural knowledge: for after we have come to the understanding of things,\nand have tasted the excellence of knowledge, she teaches us ethics and true\nvirtue.\n(94) Thus the happiness and the peace of him who cultivates his natural\nunderstanding lies, according to Solomon also, not so much under the\ndominion of fortune (or God's external aid) as in inward personal virtue (or\nGod's internal aid), for the latter can to a great extent be preserved by\nvigilance, right action, and thought.\n(95) Lastly, we must by no means pass over the passage in Paul's Epistle to\nthe Romans, i:20, in which he says: \"For the invisible things of God from\nthe creation of the world are clearly seen, being understood by the things\nthat are made, even His eternal power and Godhead; so that they are without\nexcuse, because, when they knew God, they glorified Him not as God, neither\nwere they thankful.\" (96) These words clearly show that everyone can by the\nlight of nature clearly understand the goodness and the eternal divinity of\nGod, and can thence know and deduce what they should seek for and what\navoid; wherefore the Apostle says that they are without excuse and cannot\nplead ignorance, as they certainly might if it were a question of\nsupernatural light and the incarnation, passion, and resurrection of Christ.\n(97) \"Wherefore,\" he goes on to say (ib. 24), \"God gave them up to\nuncleanness through the lusts of their own hearts;\" and so on, through the\nrest of the chapter, he describes the vices of ignorance, and sets them\nforth as the punishment of ignorance. (98) This obviously agrees with the\nverse of Solomon, already quoted, \"The instruction of fools is folly,\" so\nthat it is easy to understand why Paul says that the wicked are without\nexcuse. (99) As every man sows so shall he reap: out of evil, evils\nnecessarily spring, unless they be wisely counteracted.\n(100) Thus we see that Scripture literally approves of the light of natural\nreason and the natural Divine law, and I have fulfilled the promises made at\nthe beginning of this chapter.\nCHAPTER V. - OF THE CEREMONIAL LAW.\n(1) In the foregoing chapter we have shown that the Divine law, which\nrenders men truly blessed, and teaches them the true life, is universal to\nall men; nay, we have so intimately deduced it from human nature that it\nmust be esteemed innate, and, as it were, ingrained in the human mind.\n(2) But with regard to the ceremonial observances which were ordained in the\nOld Testament for the Hebrews only, and were so adapted to their state that\nthey could for the most part only be observed by the society as a whole and\nnot by each individual, it is evident that they formed no part of the Divine\nlaw, and had nothing to do with blessedness and virtue, but had reference\nonly to the election of the Hebrews, that is (as I have shown in Chap. II.),\nto their temporal bodily happiness and the tranquillity of their kingdom,\nand that therefore they were only valid while that kingdom lasted. (3) If in\nthe Old Testament they are spoken of as the law of God, it is only because\nthey were founded on revelation, or a basis of revelation. (4) Still as\nreason, however sound, has little weight with ordinary theologians, I will\nadduce the authority of Scripture for what I here assert, and will further\nshow, for the sake of greater clearness, why and how these ceremonials\nserved to establish and preserve the Jewish kingdom. (5) Isaiah teaches most\nplainly that the Divine law in its strict sense signifies that universal law\nwhich consists in a true manner of life, and does not signify ceremonial\nobservances. (6) In chapter i:10, the prophet calls on his countrymen to\nhearken to the Divine law as he delivers it, and first excluding all kinds\nof sacrifices and all feasts, he at length sums up the law in these few\nwords, \"Cease to do evil, learn to do well: seek judgment, relieve the\noppressed.\" (7) Not less striking testimony is given in Psalm xl:7- 9, where\nthe Psalmist addresses God: \"Sacrifice and offering Thou didst not desire;\nmine ears hast Thou opened; burnt offering and sin-offering hast Thou not\nrequired; I delight to do Thy will, O my God; yea, Thy law is within my\nheart.\" (8) Here the Psalmist reckons as the law of God only that which is\ninscribed in his heart, and excludes ceremonies therefrom, for the latter\nare good and inscribed on the heart only from the fact of their institution,\nand not because of their intrinsic value.\n(9) Other passages of Scripture testify to the same truth, but these two\nwill suffice. (10) We may also learn from the Bible that ceremonies are no\naid to blessedness, but only have reference to the temporal prosperity of\nthe kingdom; for the rewards promised for their observance are\nmerely temporal advantages and delights, blessedness being reserved for the\nuniversal Divine law. (11) In all the five books commonly attributed to\nMoses nothing is promised, as I have said, beyond temporal benefits, such as\nhonours, fame, victories, riches, enjoyments, and health. (12) Though many\nmoral precepts besides ceremonies are contained in these five books, they\nappear not as moral doctrines universal to all men, but as commands\nespecially adapted to the understanding and character of the Hebrew people,\nand as having reference only to the welfare of the kingdom. (13) For\ninstance, Moses does not teach the Jews as a prophet not to kill or to\nsteal, but gives these commandments solely as a lawgiver and judge; he does\nnot reason out the doctrine, but affixes for its non-observance a penalty\nwhich may and very properly does vary in different nations. (14) So, too,\nthe command not to commit adultery is given merely with reference to the\nwelfare of the state; for if the moral doctrine had been intended, with\nreference not only to the welfare of the state, but also to the tranquillity\nand blessedness of the individual, Moses would have condemned not merely the\noutward act, but also the mental acquiescence, as is done by Christ, Who\ntaught only universal moral precepts, and for this cause promises a\nspiritual instead of a temporal reward. (15) Christ, as I have said, was\nsent into the world, not to preserve the state nor to lay down laws, but\nsolely to teach the universal moral law, so we can easily understand that He\nwished in nowise to do away with the law of Moses, inasmuch as He introduced\nno new laws of His own - His sole care was to teach moral doctrines, and\ndistinguish them from the laws of the state; for the Pharisees, in their\nignorance, thought that the observance of the state law and the Mosaic law\nwas the sum total of morality; whereas such laws merely had reference to the\npublic welfare, and aimed not so much at instructing the Jews as at keeping\nthem under constraint. (16) But let us return to our subject, and cite other\npassages of Scripture which set forth temporal benefits as rewards for\nobserving the ceremonial law, and blessedness as reward for the universal\nlaw.\n(17) None of the prophets puts the point more clearly than Isaiah. (18.)\nAfter condemning hypocrisy he commends liberty and charity towards one's\nself and one's neighbours, and promises as a reward: \"Then shall thy light\nbreak forth as the morning, and thy health shall spring forth speedily, thy\nrighteousness shall go before thee, and the glory of the Lord shall be thy\nreward\" (chap. lviii:8). (19) Shortly afterwards he commends the Sabbath,\nand for a due observance of it, promises: \"Then shalt thou delight thyself\nin the Lord, and I will cause thee to ride upon the high places of the\nearth, and feed thee with the heritage of Jacob thy father: for the mouth of\nthe Lord has spoken it.\" (20) Thus the prophet for liberty bestowed, and\ncharitable works, promises a healthy mind in a healthy body, and the glory\nof the Lord even after death; whereas, for ceremonial exactitude, he only\npromises security of rule, prosperity, and temporal happiness.\n(21) In Psalms xv. and xxiv. no mention is made of ceremonies, but only of\nmoral doctrines, inasmuch as there is no question of anything but\nblessedness, and blessedness is symbolically promised: it is quite certain\nthat the expressions, \"the hill of God,\" and \"His tents and the dwellers\ntherein,\" refer to blessedness and security of soul, not to the actual mount\nof Jerusalem and the tabernacle of Moses, for these latter were not dwelt in\nby anyone, and only the sons of Levi ministered there. (22) Further, all\nthose sentences of Solomon to which I referred in the last chapter, for the\ncultivation of the intellect and wisdom, promise true blessedness, for by\nwisdom is the fear of God at length understood, and the knowledge of God\nfound.\n(23) That the Jews themselves were not bound to practise their ceremonial\nobservances after the destruction of their kingdom is evident from Jeremiah.\n(24) For when the prophet saw and foretold that the desolation of the city\nwas at hand, he said that God only delights in those who know and understand\nthat He exercises loving-kindness, judgment, and righteousness in the\nearth, and that such persons only are worthy of praise. (Jer. ix:23.) (25)\nAs though God had said that, after the desolation of the city, He would\nrequire nothing special from the Jews beyond the natural law by which all\nmen are bound.\n(26) The New Testament also confirms this view, for only moral doctrines are\ntherein taught, and the kingdom of heaven is promised as a reward, whereas\nceremonial observances are not touched on by the Apostles, after they began\nto preach the Gospel to the Gentiles. (27) The Pharisees certainly continued\nto practise these rites after the destruction of the kingdom, but more with\na view of opposing the Christians than of pleasing God: for after the first\ndestruction of the city, when they were led captive to Babylon, not being\nthen, so far as I am aware, split up into sects, they straightway neglected\ntheir rites, bid farewell to the Mosaic law, buried their national customs\nin oblivion as being plainly superfluous, and began to mingle with other\nnations, as we may abundantly learn from Ezra and Nehemiah. (28) We cannot,\ntherefore, doubt that they were no more bound by the law of Moses, after the\ndestruction of their kingdom, than they had been before it had been begun,\nwhile they were still living among other peoples before the exodus from\nEgypt, and were subject to no special law beyond the natural law, and also,\ndoubtless, the law of the state in which they were living, in so far as it\nwas consonant with the Divine natural law.\n(29) As to the fact that the patriarchs offered sacrifices, I think they did\nso for the purpose of stimulating their piety, for their minds had been\naccustomed from childhood to the idea of sacrifice, which we know had been\nuniversal from the time of Enoch; and thus they found in sacrifice their\nmost powerful incentive. (30) The patriarchs, then, did not sacrifice to God\nat the bidding of a Divine right, or as taught by the basis of the Divine\nlaw, but simply in accordance with the custom of the time; and, if in so\ndoing they followed any ordinance, it was simply the ordinance of the\ncountry they were living in, by which (as we have seen before in the case of\nMelchisedek) they were bound.\n(31) I think that I have now given Scriptural authority for my view: it\nremains to show why and how the ceremonial observances tended to preserve\nand confirm the Hebrew kingdom; and this I can very briefly do on grounds\nuniversally accepted.\n(32) The formation of society serves not only for defensive purposes, but is\nalso very useful, and, indeed, absolutely necessary, as rendering possible\nthe division of labour. (33) If men did not render mutual assistance to each\nother, no one would have either the skill or the time to provide for his own\nsustenance and preservation: for all men are not equally apt for all work,\nand no one would be capable of preparing all that he individually stood in\nneed of. (34) Strength and time, I repeat, would fail, if every one had in\nperson to plough, to sow, to reap, to grind corn, to cook, to weave, to\nstitch, and perform the other numerous functions required to keep life\ngoing; to say nothing of the arts and sciences which are also entirely\nnecessary to the perfection and blessedness of human nature. (35) We see\nthat peoples living, in uncivilized barbarism lead a wretched and almost\nanimal life, and even they would not be able to acquire their few rude\nnecessaries without assisting one another to a certain extent.\n(36) Now if men were so constituted by nature that they desired nothing but\nwhat is designated by true reason, society would obviously have no need of\nlaws: it would be sufficient to inculcate true moral doctrines; and men\nwould freely, without hesitation, act in accordance with their true\ninterests. (37) But human nature is framed in a different fashion: every\none, indeed, seeks his own interest, but does not do so in accordance with\nthe dictates of sound reason, for most men's ideas of desirability and\nusefulness are guided by their fleshly instincts and emotions, which take no\nthought beyond the present and the immediate object. (38) Therefore, no\nsociety can exist without government, and force, and laws to restrain and\nrepress men's desires and immoderate impulses. (39) Still human nature will\nnot submit to absolute repression. (40) Violent governments, as Seneca says,\nnever last long; the moderate governments endure. (41) So long as men act\nsimply from fear they act contrary to their inclinations, taking no thought\nfor the advantages or necessity of their actions, but simply endeavouring to\nescape punishment or loss of life. (42) They must needs rejoice in any evil\nwhich befalls their ruler, even if it should involve themselves; and must\nlong for and bring about such evil by every means in their power. (43)\nAgain, men are especially intolerant of serving and being ruled by their\nequals. (44) Lastly, it is exceedingly difficult to revoke liberties once\ngranted.\n(45) From these considerations it follows, firstly, that authority should\neither be vested in the hands of the whole state in common, so that everyone\nshould be bound to serve, and yet not be in subjection to his equals; or\nelse, if power be in the hands of a few, or one man, that one man should be\nsomething above average humanity, or should strive to get himself accepted\nas such. (46) Secondly, laws should in every government be so arranged that\npeople should be kept in bounds by the hope of some greatly desired good,\nrather than by fear, for then everyone will do his duty willingly.\n(47) Lastly, as obedience consists in acting at the bidding of external\nauthority, it would have no place in a state where the government is vested\nin the whole people, and where laws are made by common consent. (48) In such\na society the people would remain free, whether the laws were added to or\ndiminished, inasmuch as it would not be done on external authority, but\ntheir own free consent. (49) The reverse happens when the sovereign power is\nvested in one man, for all act at his bidding; and, therefore, unless they\nhad been trained from the first to depend on the words of their ruler, the\nlatter would find it difficult, in case of need, to abrogate liberties once\nconceded, and impose new laws.\n(50) From these universal considerations, let us pass on to the kingdom of\nthe Jews. (51) The Jews when they first came out of Egypt were not bound by\nany national laws, and were therefore free to ratify any laws they liked, or\nto make new ones, and were at liberty to set up a government and occupy a\nterritory wherever they chose. (52) However, they, were entirely unfit\nto frame a wise code of laws and to keep the sovereign power vested in the\ncommunity; they were all uncultivated and sunk in a wretched slavery,\ntherefore the sovereignty was bound to remain vested in the hands of one man\nwho would rule the rest and keep them under constraint, make laws and\ninterpret them. (53) This sovereignty was easily retained by Moses,\nbecause he surpassed the rest in virtue and persuaded the people of the\nfact, proving it by many testimonies (see Exod. chap. xiv., last verse, and\nchap. xix:9). (54) He then, by the Divine virtue he possessed, made laws and\nordained them for the people, taking the greatest care that they should be\nobeyed willingly and not through fear, being specially induced to adopt this\ncourse by the obstinate nature of the Jews, who would not have submitted to\nbe ruled solely by constraint; and also by the imminence of war, for it is\nalways better to inspire soldiers with a thirst for glory than to terrify\nthem with threats; each man will then strive to distinguish himself\nby valour and courage, instead of merely trying to escape punishment. (55)\nMoses, therefore, by his virtue and the Divine command, introduced a\nreligion, so that the people might do their duty from devotion rather than\nfear. (56) Further, he bound them over by benefits, and prophesied\nmany advantages in the future; nor were his laws very severe, as anyone may\nsee for himself, especially if he remarks the number of circumstances\nnecessary in order to procure the conviction of an accused person.\n(57) Lastly, in order that the people which could not govern itself should\nbe entirely dependent on its ruler, he left nothing to the free choice of\nindividuals (who had hitherto been slaves); the people could do nothing but\nremember the law, and follow the ordinances laid down at the good pleasure\nof their ruler; they were not allowed to plough, to sow, to reap, nor even\nto eat; to clothe themselves, to shave, to rejoice, or in fact to do\nanything whatever as they liked, but were bound to follow the directions\ngiven in the law; and not only this, but they were obliged to have marks on\ntheir door-posts, on their hands, and between their eyes to admonish them to\nperpetual obedience.\n(58) This, then, was the object of the ceremonial law, that men should do\nnothing of their own free will, but should always act under external\nauthority, and should continually confess by their actions and thoughts that\nthey were not their own masters, but were entirely under the control of\nothers.\n(59) From all these considerations it is clearer than day that ceremonies\nhave nothing to do with a state of blessedness, and that those mentioned in\nthe Old Testament, i.e. the whole Mosaic Law, had reference merely to the\ngovernment of the Jews, and merely temporal advantages.\n(60) As for the Christian rites, such as baptism, the Lord's Supper,\nfestivals, public prayers, and any other observances which are, and always\nhave been, common to all Christendom, if they were instituted by Christ or\nHis Apostles (which is open to doubt), they were instituted as external\nsigns of the universal church, and not as having anything to do with\nblessedness, or possessing any sanctity in themselves. (61) Therefore,\nthough such ceremonies were not ordained for the sake of upholding a\ngovernment, they were ordained for the preservation of a society, and\naccordingly he who lives alone is not bound by them: nay, those who live in\na country where the Christian religion is forbidden, are bound to abstain\nfrom such rites, and can none the less live in a state of blessedness. (62)\nWe have an example of this in Japan, where the Christian religion is\nforbidden, and the Dutch who live there are enjoined by their East India\nCompany not to practise any outward rites of religion. (63) I need not cite\nother examples, though it would be easy to prove my point from the\nfundamental principles of the New Testament, and to adduce many confirmatory\ninstances; but I pass on the more willingly, as I am anxious to proceed to\nmy next proposition. (64) I will now, therefore, pass on to what I proposed\nto treat of in the second part of this chapter, namely, what persons are\nbound to believe in the narratives contained in Scripture, and how far they\nare so bound. (65) Examining this question by the aid of natural reason, I\nwill proceed as follows.\n(66) If anyone wishes to persuade his fellows for or against anything which\nis not self-evident, he must deduce his contention from their admissions,\nand convince them either by experience or by ratiocination; either by\nappealing to facts of natural experience, or to self-evident intellectual\naxioms. (67) Now unless the experience be of such a kind as to be clearly\nand distinctly understood, though it may convince a man, it will not have\nthe same effect on his mind and disperse the clouds of his doubt so\ncompletely as when the doctrine taught is deduced entirely from intellectual\naxioms - that is, by the mere power of the understanding and logical order,\nand this is especially the case in spiritual matters which have nothing to\ndo with the senses.\n(68) But the deduction of conclusions from general truths a priori, usually\nrequires a long chain of arguments, and, moreover, very great caution,\nacuteness, and self-restraint - qualities which are not often met with;\ntherefore people prefer to be taught by experience rather than deduce\ntheir conclusion from a few axioms, and set them out in logical order. (69)\nWhence it follows, that if anyone wishes to teach a doctrine to a whole\nnation (not to speak of the whole human race), and to be understood by all\nmen in every particular, he will seek to support his teaching with\nexperience, and will endeavour to suit his reasonings and the definitions of\nhis doctrines as far as possible to the understanding of the common people,\nwho form the majority of mankind, and he will not set them forth in logical\nsequence nor adduce the definitions which serve to establish them. (70)\nOtherwise he writes only for the learned - that is, he will be understood by\nonly a small proportion of the human race.\n(71) All Scripture was written primarily for an entire people, and\nsecondarily for the whole human race; therefore its contents must\nnecessarily be adapted as far as possible to the understanding of the\nmasses, and proved only by examples drawn from experience. (72) We will\nexplain ourselves more clearly. (73) The chief speculative doctrines taught\nin Scripture are the existence of God, or a Being Who made all things, and\nWho directs and sustains the world with consummate wisdom; furthermore, that\nGod takes the greatest thought for men, or such of them as live piously and\nhonourably, while He punishes, with various penalties, those who do\nevil, separating them from the good. (74) All this is proved in Scripture\nentirely through experience-that is, through the narratives there related.\n(75) No definitions of doctrine are given, but all the sayings and\nreasonings are adapted to the understanding of the masses. (76) Although\nexperience can give no clear knowledge of these things, nor explain the\nnature of God, nor how He directs and sustains all things, it can\nnevertheless teach and enlighten men sufficiently to impress obedience\nand devotion on their minds.\n(77) It is now, I think, sufficiently clear what persons are bound to\nbelieve in the Scripture narratives, and in what degree they are so bound,\nfor it evidently follows from what has been said that the knowledge of and\nbelief in them is particularly necessary to the masses whose intellect is\nnot capable of perceiving things clearly and distinctly. (78) Further, he\nwho denies them because he does not believe that God exists or takes thought\nfor men and the world, may be accounted impious; but a man who is ignorant\nof them, and nevertheless knows by natural reason that God exists, as we\nhave said, and has a true plan of life, is altogether blessed - yes, more\nblessed than the common herd of believers, because besides true opinions he\npossesses also a true and distinct conception. (79) Lastly, he who is\nignorant of the Scriptures and knows nothing by the light of reason, though\nhe may not be impious or rebellious, is yet less than human and almost\nbrutal, having none of God's gifts.\n(80) We must here remark that when we say that the knowledge of the sacred\nnarrative is particularly necessary to the masses, we do not mean the\nknowledge of absolutely all the narratives in the Bible, but only of the\nprincipal ones, those which, taken by themselves, plainly display the\ndoctrine we have just stated, and have most effect over men's minds.\n(81) If all the narratives in Scripture were necessary for the proof of this\ndoctrine, and if no conclusion could be drawn without the general\nconsideration of every one of the histories contained in the sacred\nwritings, truly the conclusion and demonstration of such doctrine would\novertask the understanding and strength not only of the masses, but of\nhumanity; who is there who could give attention to all the narratives at\nonce, and to all the circumstances, and all the scraps of doctrine to be\nelicited from such a host of diverse histories? (82) I cannot believe that\nthe men who have left us the Bible as we have it were so abounding in talent\nthat they attempted setting about such a method of demonstration, still less\ncan I suppose that we cannot understand Scriptural doctrine till we have\ngiven heed to the quarrels of Isaac, the advice of Achitophel to Absalom,\nthe civil war between Jews and Israelites, and other similar chronicles; nor\ncan I think that it was more difficult to teach such doctrine by means of\nhistory to the Jews of early times, the contemporaries of Moses, than it was\nto the contemporaries of Esdras. (83) But more will be said on this point\nhereafter, we may now only note that the masses are only bound to know those\nhistories which can most powerfully dispose their mind to obedience and\ndevotion. (84) However, the masses are not sufficiently skilled to draw\nconclusions from what they read, they take more delight in the actual\nstories, and in the strange and unlooked-for issues of events than in the\ndoctrines implied; therefore, besides reading these narratives, they are\nalways in need of pastors or church ministers to explain them to their\nfeeble intelligence.\n(85) But not to wander from our point, let us conclude with what has been\nour principal object - namely, that the truth of narratives, be they what\nthey may, has nothing to do with the Divine law, and serves for nothing\nexcept in respect of doctrine, the sole element which makes one history\nbetter than another. (86) The narratives in the Old and New Testaments\nsurpass profane history, and differ among themselves in merit simply by\nreason of the salutary doctrines which they inculcate. (87) Therefore, if a\nman were to read the Scripture narratives believing the whole of them, but\nwere to give no heed to the doctrines they contain, and make no amendment in\nhis life, he might employ himself just as profitably in reading the Koran\nor the poetic drama, or ordinary chronicles, with the attention usually\ngiven to such writings; on the other hand, if a man is absolutely ignorant\nof the Scriptures, and none the less has right opinions and a true\nplan of life, he is absolutely blessed and truly possesses in himself the\nspirit of Christ.\n(88) The Jews are of a directly contrary way of thinking, for they hold that\ntrue opinions and a true plan of life are of no service in attaining\nblessedness, if their possessors have arrived at them by the light of reason\nonly, and not like the documents prophetically revealed to Moses. (89)\nMaimonides ventures openly to make this assertion: \"Every man who takes to\nheart the seven precepts and diligently follows them, is counted with the\npious among the nation, and an heir of the world to come; that is to say, if\nhe takes to heart and follows them because God ordained them in the law, and\nrevealed them to us by Moses, because they were of aforetime precepts to the\nsons of Noah: but he who follows them as led thereto by reason, is not\ncounted as a dweller among the pious or among the wise of the nations.\" (90)\nSuch are the words Of Maimonides, to which R. Joseph, the son of Shem Job,\nadds in his book which he calls \"Kebod Elohim, or God's Glory,\" that\nalthough Aristotle (whom he considers to have written the best ethics and to\nbe above everyone else) has not omitted anything that concerns\ntrue ethics, and which he has adopted in his own book, carefully following\nthe lines laid down, yet this was not able to suffice for his salvation,\ninasmuch as he embraced his doctrines in accordance with the dictates of\nreason and not as Divine documents prophetically revealed.\n(91) However, that these are mere figments, and are not supported by\nScriptural authority will, I think, be sufficiently evident to the attentive\nreader, so that an examination of the theory will be sufficient for its\nrefutation. (92) It is not my purpose here to refute the assertions of those\nwho assert that the natural light of reason can teach nothing, of any value\nconcerning the true way of salvation. (93) People who lay no claims to\nreason for themselves, are not able to prove by reason this their assertion;\nand if they hawk about something superior to reason, it is a mere figment,\nand far below reason, as their general method of life sufficiently shows.\n(94) But there is no need to dwell upon such persons. (95) I will merely add\nthat we can only judge of a man by his works. (96) If a man abounds in the\nfruits of the Spirit, charity, joy, peace, long-suffering, kindness,\ngoodness, faith, gentleness, chastity, against which, as Paul says\n(Gal. v:22), there is no law, such an one, whether he be taught by reason\nonly or by the Scripture only, has been in very truth taught by God, and is\naltogether blessed. (97) Thus have I said all that I undertook to say\nconcerning Divine law.\nEnd of Part 1\nAUTHOR'S ENDNOTES TO THE THEOLOGICO-POLITICAL TREATISE\nCHAPTERS I to V\nChapter I\nEndnote 1.

(2) They suppose, forsooth, that God is inactive so long as\nnature works in her accustomed order, and vice versa, that the power of\nnature and natural causes are idle so long as God is acting: thus they\nimagine two powers distinct one from the other, the power of God and the\npower of nature, though the latter is in a sense determined by God, or (as\nmost people believe now) created by Him. (3) What they mean by either, and\nwhat they understand by God and nature they do not know, except that they\nimagine the power of God to be like that of some royal potentate, and\nnature's power to consist in force and energy.\n(4) The masses then style unusual phenomena, \"miracles,\" and partly from\npiety, partly for the sake of opposing the students of science, prefer to\nremain in ignorance of natural causes, and only to hear of those things\nwhich they know least, and consequently admire most. (5) In fact, the common\npeople can only adore God, and refer all things to His power by removing\nnatural causes, and conceiving things happening out of their due course, and\nonly admires the power of God when the power of nature is conceived of as in\nsubjection to it.\n(6) This idea seems to have taken its rise among the early Jews who saw the\nGentiles round them worshipping visible gods such as the sun, the moon, the\nearth, water, air, &c., and in order to inspire the conviction that such\ndivinities were weak and inconstant, or changeable, told how they themselves\nwere under the sway of an invisible God, and narrated their miracles,\ntrying further to show that the God whom they worshipped arranged the whole\nof nature for their sole benefit: this idea was so pleasing to humanity that\nmen go on to this day imagining miracles, so that they may believe\nthemselves God's favourites, and the final cause for which God created and\ndirects all things.\n(7) What pretension will not people in their folly advance! (8) They have no\nsingle sound idea concerning either God or nature, they confound God's\ndecrees with human decrees, they conceive nature as so limited that they\nbelieve man to be its chief part! (9) I have spent enough space in setting\nforth these common ideas and prejudices concerning nature and miracles, but\nin order to afford a regular demonstration I will show -\n(10) I. That nature cannot be contravened, but that she preserves a fixed\nand immutable order, and at the same time I will explain what is meant by a\nmiracle.\n(11) II. That God's nature and existence, and consequently His providence\ncannot be known from miracles, but that they can all be much better\nperceived from the fixed and immutable order of nature.\n(12) III. That by the decrees and volitions, and consequently the providence\nof God, Scripture (as I will prove by Scriptural examples) means nothing but\nnature's order following necessarily from her eternal laws.\n(13) IV. Lastly, I will treat of the method of interpreting Scriptural\nmiracles, and the chief points to be noted concerning the narratives of\nthem.\n(14) Such are the principal subjects which will be discussed in this\nchapter, and which will serve, I think, not a little to further the object\nof this treatise.\n(15) Our first point is easily proved from what we showed in Chap. IV. about\nDivine law - namely, that all that God wishes or determines involves eternal\nnecessity and truth, for we demonstrated that God's understanding is\nidentical with His will, and that it is the same thing to say that God wills\na thing, as to say, that He understands it; hence, as it follows\nnecessarily, from the Divine nature and perfection that God understands a\nthing as it is, it follows no less necessarily that He wills it as it is.\n(16) Now, as nothing is necessarily true save only by Divine decree, it is\nplain that the universal laws of nature are decrees of God following from\nthe necessity and perfection of the Divine nature. (17) Hence, any event\nhappening in nature which contravened nature's universal laws, would\nnecessarily also contravene the Divine decree, nature, and understanding; or\nif anyone asserted that God acts in contravention to the laws of nature, he,\nipso facto, would be compelled to assert that God acted against His own\nnature - an evident absurdity. (18) One might easily show from the same\npremises that the power and efficiency of nature are in themselves the\nDivine power and efficiency, and that the Divine power is the very essence\nof God, but this I gladly pass over for the present.\n(19) Nothing, then, comes to pass in nature (N.B. I do not mean here by\n\"nature,\" merely matter and its modifications, but infinite other things\nbesides matter.) in contravention to her universal laws, nay, everything\nagrees with them and follows from them, for whatsoever comes to pass, comes\nto pass by the will and eternal decree of God; that is, as we have just\npointed out, whatever comes to pass, comes to pass according to laws and\nrules which involve eternal necessity and truth; nature, therefore, always\nobserves laws and rules which involve eternal necessity and truth, although\nthey may not all be known to us, and therefore she keeps a fixed and mutable\norder. (20) Nor is there any sound reason for limiting the power and\nefficacy of nature, and asserting that her laws are fit for certain\npurposes, but not for all; for as the efficacy and power of nature, are the\nvery efficacy and power of God, and as the laws and rules of nature are the\ndecrees of God, it is in every way to be believed that the power of nature\nis infinite, and that her laws are broad enough to embrace everything\nconceived by, the Divine intellect; the only alternative is to assert that\nGod has created nature so weak, and has ordained for her laws so barren,\nthat He is repeatedly compelled to come afresh to her aid if He wishes that\nshe should be preserved, and that things should happen as He desires: a\nconclusion, in my opinion, very far removed from reason. (21) Further, as\nnothing happens in nature which does not follow from her laws, and as her\nlaws embrace everything conceived by the Divine intellect, and lastly, as\nnature preserves a fixed and immutable order; it most clearly follows that\nmiracles are only intelligible as in relation to human opinions, and merely\nmean events of which the natural cause cannot be explained by a reference to\nany ordinary occurrence, either by us, or at any rate, by the writer and\nnarrator of the miracle.\n(22) We may, in fact, say that a miracle is an event of which the causes\nannot be explained by the natural reason through a reference to ascertained\nworkings of nature; but since miracles were wrought according to the\nunderstanding of the masses, who are wholly ignorant of the workings of\nnature, it is certain that the ancients took for a miracle whatever they\ncould not explain by the method adopted by the unlearned in such cases,\nnamely, an appeal to the memory, a recalling of something similar, which is\nordinarily regarded without wonder; for most people think they sufficiently\nunderstand a thing when they have ceased to wonder at it. (23) The ancients,\nthen, and indeed most men up to the present day, had no other criterion for\na miracle; hence we cannot doubt that many things are narrated in Scripture\nas miracles of which the causes could easily be explained by reference to\nascertained workings of nature. (24) We have hinted as much in Chap. II., in\nspeaking of the sun standing still in the time of Joshua, and to say on the\nsubject when we come to treat of the interpretation of miracles later on in\nthis chapter.\n(25) It is now time to pass on to the second point, and show that we cannot\ngain an understanding of God's essence, existence, or providence by means of\nmiracles, but that these truths are much better perceived through the fixed\nand immutable order of nature. (26) I thus proceed with the demonstration.\n(27) As God's existence is not self-evident (6) it must necessarily be\ninferred from ideas so firmly and incontrovertibly true, that no power can\nbe postulated or conceived sufficient to impugn them. (28) They ought\ncertainly so to appear to us when we infer from them God's existence, if we\nwish to place our conclusion beyond the reach of doubt; for if we could\nconceive that such ideas could be impugned by any power whatsoever, we\nshould doubt of their truth, we should doubt of our conclusion, namely, of\nGod's existence, and should never be able to be certain of anything. (29)\nFurther, we know that nothing either agrees with or is contrary to nature,\nunless it agrees with or is contrary to these primary ideas; wherefore if we\nwould conceive that anything could be done in nature by any power whatsoever\nwhich would be contrary to the laws of nature, it would also be contrary to\nour primary ideas, and we should have either to reject it as absurd, or else\nto cast doubt (as just shown) on our primary ideas, and consequently on the\nexistence of God, and on everything howsoever perceived. (30) Therefore\nmiracles, in the sense of events contrary to the laws of nature, so far from\ndemonstrating to us the existence of God, would, on the contrary, lead us to\ndoubt it, where, otherwise, we might have been absolutely certain of it, as\nknowing that nature follows a fixed and immutable order.\n(31) Let us take miracle as meaning that which cannot be explained through\nnatural causes. (32) This may be interpreted in two senses: either as that\nwhich has natural causes, but cannot be examined by the human intellect; or\nas that which has no cause save God and God's will. (33) But as all things\nwhich come to pass through natural causes, come to pass also solely\nthrough the will and power of God, it comes to this, that a miracle, whether\nit has natural causes or not, is a result which cannot be explained by its\ncause, that is a phenomenon which surpasses human understanding; but from\nsuch a phenomenon, and certainly from a result surpassing our understanding,\nwe can gain no knowledge. (34) For whatsoever we understand clearly and\ndistinctly should be plain to us either in itself or by means of something\nelse clearly and distinctly understood; wherefore from a miracle or a\nphenomenon which we cannot understand, we can gain no knowledge of God's\nessence, or existence, or indeed anything about God or nature; whereas when\nwe know that all things are ordained and ratified by God, that the\noperations of nature follow from the essence of God, and that the laws of\nnature are eternal decrees and volitions of God, we must perforce conclude\nthat our knowledge of God, and of God's will increases in proportion to our\nknowledge and clear understanding of nature, as we see how she depends on\nher primal cause, and how she works according to eternal law. (35) Wherefore\nso far as our understanding goes, those phenomena which we clearly and\ndistinctly understand have much better right to be called works of God, and\nto be referred to the will of God than those about which we are entirely\nignorant, although they appeal powerfully to the imagination, and compel\nmen's admiration.\n(36) It is only phenomena that we clearly and distinctly understand, which\nheighten our knowledge of God, and most clearly indicate His will and\ndecrees. (37) Plainly, they are but triflers who, when they cannot explain a\nthing, run back to the will of God; this is, truly, a ridiculous way of\nexpressing ignorance. (38) Again, even supposing that some conclusion could\nbe drawn from miracles, we could not possibly infer from them the existence\nof God: for a miracle being an event under limitations is the expression of\na fixed and limited power; therefore we could not possibly infer from an\neffect of this kind the existence of a cause whose power is infinite, but at\nthe utmost only of a cause whose power is greater than that of the said\neffect. (39) I say at the utmost, for a phenomenon may be the result of many\nconcurrent causes, and its power may be less than the power of the sum of\nsuch causes, but far greater than that of any one of them taken\nindividually. (40) On the other hand, the laws of nature, as we have\nshown, extend over infinity, and are conceived by us as, after a fashion,\neternal, and nature works in accordance with them in a fixed and immutable\norder; therefore, such laws indicate to us in a certain degree the infinity,\nthe eternity, and the immutability of God.\n(40) We may conclude, then, that we cannot gain knowledge of the existence\nand providence of God by means of miracles, but that we can far better infer\nthem from the fixed and immutable order of nature. (41) By miracle, I here\nmean an event which surpasses, or is thought to surpass, human\ncomprehension: for in so far as it is supposed to destroy or interrupt the\norder of nature or her laws, it not only can give us no knowledge of God,\nbut, contrariwise, takes away that which we naturally have, and makes us\ndoubt of God and everything else.\n(42) Neither do I recognize any difference between an event against the laws\nof nature and an event beyond the laws of nature (that is, according to\nsome, an event which does not contravene nature, though she is inadequate to\nproduce or effect it) - for a miracle is wrought in, and not beyond nature,\nthough it may be said in itself to be above nature, and, therefore,\nmust necessarily interrupt the order of nature, which otherwise we conceive\nof as fixed and unchangeable, according to God's decrees. (43) If,\ntherefore, anything should come to pass in nature which does not follow from\nher laws, it would also be in contravention to the order which God has\nestablished in nature for ever through universal natural laws: it would,\ntherefore, be in contravention to God's nature and laws, and, consequently,\nbelief in it would throw doubt upon everything, and lead to Atheism.\n(44) I think I have now sufficiently established my second point, so that we\ncan again conclude that a miracle, whether in contravention to, or beyond,\nnature, is a mere absurdity; and, therefore, that what is meant in Scripture\nby a miracle can only be a work of nature, which surpasses, or is believed\nto surpass, human comprehension. (45) Before passing on to my third point, I\nwill adduce Scriptural authority for my assertion that God cannot be known\nfrom miracles. (46) Scripture nowhere states the doctrine openly, but it can\nreadily be inferred from several passages. (47) Firstly, that in which Moses\ncommands (Deut. xiii.) that a false prophet should be put to death, even\nthough he work miracles: \"If there arise a prophet among you, and giveth\nthee a sign or wonder, and the sign or wonder come to pass, saying, Let us\ngo after other gods . . . thou shalt not hearken unto the voice of that\nprophet; for the Lord your God proveth you, and that prophet shall be put to\ndeath.\" (48) From this it clearly follows that miracles could be wrought\neven by false prophets; and that, unless men are honestly endowed with the\ntrue knowledge and love of God, they may be as easily led by miracles to\nfollow false gods as to follow the true God; for these words are added: \"For\nthe Lord your God tempts you, that He may know whether you love Him with all\nyour heart and with all your mind.\"\n(49) Further, the Israelites, from all their miracles, were unable to form a\nsound conception of God, as their experience testified: for when they had\npersuaded themselves that Moses had departed from among them, they\npetitioned Aaron to give them visible gods; and the idea of God they had\nformed as the result of all their miracles was - a calf!\n(50) Asaph, though he had heard of so many miracles, yet doubted of the\nprovidence of God, and would have turned himself from the true way, if he\nhad not at last come to understand true blessedness. (See Ps. lxxxiii.) (51)\nSolomon, too, at a time when the Jewish nation was at the height of its\nprosperity, suspects that all things happen by chance. (See Eccles. iii:19,\n20, 21; and chap. ix:2, 3, &c.)\n(52) Lastly, nearly all the prophets found it very hard to reconcile the\norder of nature and human affairs with the conception they had formed of\nGod's providence, whereas philosophers who endeavour to understand things by\nclear conceptions of them, rather than by miracles, have always found the\ntask extremely easy - at least, such of them as place true happiness solely\nin virtue and peace of mind, and who aim at obeying nature, rather than\nbeing obeyed by her. (53) Such persons rest assured that God directs nature\naccording to the requirements of universal laws, not according to the\nrequirements of the particular laws of human nature, and that, therefore,\nGod's scheme comprehends, not only the human race, but the whole of nature.\n(54) It is plain, then, from Scripture itself, that miracles can give no\nknowledge of God, nor clearly teach us the providence of God. (55) As to the\nfrequent statements in Scripture, that God wrought miracles to make Himself\nplain to man - as in Exodus x:2, where He deceived the Egyptians, and gave\nsigns of Himself, that the Israelites might know that He was God,- it does\nnot, therefore, follow that miracles really taught this truth, but only that\nthe Jews held opinions which laid them easily open to conviction by\nmiracles. (56) We have shown in Chap. II. that the reasons assigned by the\nprophets, or those which are formed from revelation, are not assigned\nin accordance with ideas universal and common to all, but in accordance with\nthe accepted doctrines, however absurd, and with the opinions of those to\nwhom the revelation was given, or those whom the Holy Spirit wished to\nconvince.\n(57) This we have illustrated by many Scriptural instances, and can further\ncite Paul, who to the Greeks was a Greek, and to the Jews a Jew. (58) But\nalthough these miracles could convince the Egyptians and Jews from their\nstandpoint, they could not give a true idea and knowledge of God, but only\ncause them to admit that there was a Deity more powerful than anything known\nto them, and that this Deity took special care of the Jews, who had just\nthen an unexpectedly happy issue of all their affairs. (59) They could not\nteach them that God cares equally for all, for this can be taught only by\nphilosophy: the Jews, and all who took their knowledge of God's providence\nfrom the dissimilarity of human conditions of life and the inequalities of\nfortune, persuaded themselves that God loved the Jews above all men, though\nthey did not surpass their fellows in true human perfection.\n(60) I now go on to my third point, and show from Scripture that the decrees\nand mandates of God, and consequently His providence, are merely the order\nof nature - that is, when Scripture describes an event as accomplished by\nGod or God's will, we must understand merely that it was in accordance with\nthe law and order of nature, not, as most people believe, that nature had\nfor a season ceased to act, or that her order was temporarily interrupted.\n(61) But Scripture does not directly teach matters unconnected with its\ndoctrine, wherefore it has no care to explain things by their natural\ncauses, nor to expound matters merely speculative. (62) Wherefore our\nconclusion must be gathered by inference from those Scriptural narratives\nwhich happen to be written more at length and circumstantially than usual.\n(63) Of these I will cite a few.\n(64) In the first book of Samuel, ix:15, 16, it is related that God revealed\nto Samuel that He would send Saul to him, yet God did not send Saul to\nSamuel as people are wont to send one man to another. (65) His \"sending\" was\nmerely the ordinary course of nature. (66) Saul was looking for the asses he\nhad lost, and was meditating a return home without them, when, at the\nsuggestion of his servant, he went to the prophet Samuel, to learn from him\nwhere he might find them. (67) From no part of the narrative does it appear\nthat Saul had any command from God to visit Samuel beyond this natural\nmotive.\n(68) In Psalm cv. 24 it is said that God changed the hearts of the\nEgyptians, so that they hated the Israelites. (69) This was evidently a\nnatural change, as appears from Exodus, chap.i., where we find no slight\nreason for the Egyptians reducing the Israelites to slavery.\n(70) In Genesis ix:13, God tells Noah that He will set His bow in the cloud;\nthis action of God's is but another way of expressing the refraction and\nreflection which the rays of the sun are subjected to in drops of water.\n(71) In Psalm cxlvii:18, the natural action and warmth of the wind, by which\nhoar frost and snow are melted, are styled the word of the Lord, and in\nverse 15 wind and cold are called the commandment and word of God.\n(72) In Psalm civ:4, wind and fire are called the angels and ministers of\nGod, and various other passages of the same sort are found in Scripture,\nclearly showing that the decree, commandment, fiat, and word of God are\nmerely expressions for the action and order of nature.\n(73) Thus it is plain that all the events narrated in Scripture came to pass\nnaturally, and are referred directly to God because Scripture, as we have\nshown, does not aim at explaining things by their natural causes, but only\nat narrating what appeals to the popular imagination, and doing so in the\nmanner best calculated to excite wonder, and consequently to impress the\nminds of the masses with devotion. (74) If, therefore, events are found in\nthe Bible which we cannot refer to their causes, nay, which seem entirely to\ncontradict the order of nature, we must not come to a stand, but assuredly\nbelieve that whatever did really happen happened naturally. (75) This view\nis confirmed by the fact that in the case of every miracle there were many\nattendant circumstances, though these were not always related, especially\nwhere the narrative was of a poetic character.\n(76) The circumstances of the miracles clearly show, I maintain, that\nnatural causes were needed. (77) For instance, in order to infect the\nEgyptians with blains, it was necessary that Moses should scatter ashes in\nthe air (Exod. ix: 10); the locusts also came upon the land of Egypt by a\ncommand of God in accordance with nature, namely, by an east wind blowing\nfor a whole day and night; and they departed by a very strong west wind\n(Exod. x:14, 19). (78) By a similar Divine mandate the sea opened a way for\nthe Jews (Exo. xiv:21), namely, by an east wind which blew very strongly all\nnight.\n(79) So, too, when Elisha would revive the boy who was believed to be dead,\nhe was obliged to bend over him several times until the flesh of the child\nwaxed warm, and at last he opened his eyes (2 Kings iv:34, 35).\n(80) Again, in John's Gospel (chap. ix.) certain acts are mentioned as\nperformed by Christ preparatory to healing the blind man, and there are\nnumerous other instances showing that something further than the absolute\nfiat of God is required for working a miracle.\n(81) Wherefore we may believe that, although the circumstances attending\nmiracles are not related always or in full detail, yet a miracle was never\nperformed without them.\n(82) This is confirmed by Exodus xiv:27, where it is simply stated that\n\"Moses stretched forth his hand, and the waters of the sea returned to their\nstrength in the morning,\" no mention being made of a wind; but in the song\nof Moses (Exod. xv:10) we read, \"Thou didst blow with Thy wind (i.e. with a\nvery strong wind), and the sea covered them.\" (83) Thus the attendant\ncircumstance is omitted in the history, and the miracle is thereby enhanced.\n(84) But perhaps someone will insist that we find many things in Scripture\nwhich seem in nowise explicable by natural causes, as for instance, that the\nsins of men and their prayers can be the cause of rain and of the earth's\nfertility, or that faith can heal the blind, and so on. (85) But I think\nI have already made sufficient answer: I have shown that Scripture does not\nexplain things by their secondary causes, but only narrates them in the\norder and the style which has most power to move men, and especially\nuneducated men, to devotion; and therefore it speaks inaccurately of God and\nof events, seeing that its object is not to convince the reason, but to\nattract and lay hold of the imagination. (86) If the Bible were to describe\nthe destruction of an empire in the style of political historians, the\nmasses would remain unstirred, whereas the contrary is the case when it\nadopts the method of poetic description, and refers all things\nimmediately to God. (87) When, therefore, the Bible says that the earth is\nbarren because of men's sins, or that the blind were healed by faith, we\nought to take no more notice than when it says that God is angry at men's\nsins, that He is sad, that He repents of the good He has promised and done;\nor that on seeing a sign he remembers something He had promised, and other\nsimilar expressions, which are either thrown out poetically or related\naccording to the opinion and prejudices of the writer.\n(88) We may, then, be absolutely certain that every event which is truly\ndescribed in Scripture necessarily happened, like everything else, according\nto natural laws; and if anything is there set down which can be proved in\nset terms to contravene the order of nature, or not to be deducible\ntherefrom, we must believe it to have been foisted into the sacred writings\nby irreligious hands; for whatsoever is contrary to nature is also contrary\nto reason, and whatsoever is contrary to reason is absurd, and, ipso facto,\nto be rejected.\n(89) There remain some points concerning the interpretation of miracles to\nbe noted, or rather to be recapitulated, for most of them have been already\nstated. (90) These I proceed to discuss in the fourth division of my\nsubject, and I am led to do so lest anyone should, by wrongly interpreting a\nmiracle, rashly suspect that he has found something in Scripture contrary to\nhuman reason.\n(91) It is very rare for men to relate an event simply as it happened,\nwithout adding any element of their own judgment. (92) When they see or hear\nanything new, they are, unless strictly on their guard, so occupied with\ntheir own preconceived opinions that they perceive something quite\ndifferent from the plain facts seen or heard, especially if such facts\nsurpass the comprehension of the beholder or hearer, and, most of all, if he\nis interested in their happening in a given way.\n(93) Thus men relate in chronicles and histories their own opinions rather\nthan actual events, so that one and the same event is so differently related\nby two men of different opinions, that it seems like two separate\noccurrences; and, further, it is very easy from historical chronicles to\ngather the personal opinions of the historian.\n(94) I could cite many instances in proof of this from the writings both of\nnatural philosophers and historians, but I will content myself with one only\nfrom Scripture, and leave the reader to judge of the rest.\n(95) In the time of Joshua the Hebrews held the ordinary opinion that the\nsun moves with a daily motion, and that the earth remains at rest; to this\npreconceived opinion they adapted the miracle which occurred during their\nbattle with the five kings. (96) They did not simply relate that that day\nwas longer than usual, but asserted that the sun and moon stood still, or\nceased from their motion - a statement which would be of great service to\nthem at that time in convincing and proving by experience to the Gentiles,\nwho worshipped the sun, that the sun was under the control of another deity\nwho could compel it to change its daily course. (97) Thus, partly through\nreligious motives, partly through preconceived opinions, they conceived of\nand related the occurrence as something quite different from what really\nhappened.\n(98) Thus in order to interpret the Scriptural miracles and understand from\nthe narration of them how they really happened, it is necessary to know the\nopinions of those who first related them, and have recorded them for us in\nwriting, and to distinguish such opinions from the actual impression made\nupon their senses, otherwise we shall confound opinions and judgments with\nthe actual miracle as it really occurred: nay, further, we shall confound\nactual events with symbolical and imaginary ones. (99) For many things are\nnarrated in Scripture as real, and were believed to be real, which were in\nfact only symbolical and imaginary. (100) As, for instance, that God came\ndown from heaven (Exod. xix:28, Deut. v:28), and that Mount Sinai smoked\nbecause God descended upon it surrounded with fire; or, again that Elijah\nascended into heaven in a chariot of fire, with horses of fire; all these\nthings were assuredly merely symbols adapted to the opinions of those who\nhave handed them down to us as they were represented to them, namely, as\nreal. (101) All who have any education know that God has no right hand nor\nleft; that He is not moved nor at rest, nor in a particular place, but that\nHe is absolutely infinite and contains in Himself all perfections.\n(102) These things, I repeat, are known to whoever judges of things by the\nperception of pure reason, and not according as his imagination is affected\nby his outward senses. (103) Following the example of the masses who imagine\na bodily Deity, holding a royal court with a throne on the convexity of\nheaven, above the stars, which are believed to be not very, far off from the\nearth.\n(104) To these and similar opinions very many narrations in Scripture are\nadapted, and should not, therefore, be mistaken by philosophers for\nrealities.\n(105) Lastly, in order to understand, in the case of miracles, what actually\ntook place, we ought to be familiar with Jewish phrases and metaphors;\nanyone who did not make sufficient allowance for these, would be continually\nseeing miracles in Scripture where nothing of the kind is intended by the\nwriter; he would thus miss the knowledge not only of what actually happened,\nbut also of the mind of the writers of the sacred text. (106) For instance,\nZechariah speaking of some future war says (chap. xiv:7): \"It shall be one\nday which shall be known to the Lord, not day, nor night; but at even time\nit shall be light.\" In these words he seems to predict a great miracle, yet\nhe only means that the battle will be doubtful the whole day, that the issue\nwill be known only to God, but that in the evening they will gain the\nvictory: the prophets frequently used to predict victories and defeats of\nthe nations in similar phrases. (107) Thus Isaiah, describing the\ndestruction of Babylon, says (chap. xiii.): \"The stars of heaven, and the\nconstellations thereof, shall not give their light; the sun shall be\ndarkened in his going forth, and the moon shall not cause her light to\nshine.\" (108) Now I suppose no one imagines that at the destruction of\nBabylon these phenomena actually occurred any more than that which the\nprophet adds, \"For I will make the heavens to tremble, and remove the earth\nout of her place.\"\n(109) So, too, Isaiah in foretelling to the Jews that they would return from\nBabylon to Jerusalem in safety, and would not suffer from thirst on their\njourney, says: \"And they thirsted not when He led them through the deserts;\nHe caused the waters to flow out of the rocks for them; He clave the rocks,\nand the waters gushed out.\" (110) These words merely mean that the Jews,\nlike other people, found springs in the desert, at which they quenched their\nthirst; for when the Jews returned to Jerusalem with the consent of Cyrus,\nit is admitted that no similar miracles befell them.\n(111) In this way many occurrences in the Bible are to be regarded merely as\nJewish expressions. (112) There is no need for me to go through them in\ndetail; but I will call attention generally to the fact that the Jews\nemployed such phrases not only rhetorically, but also, and indeed chiefly,\nfrom devotional motives. (113) Such is the reason for the substitution of\n\"bless God\" for \"curse God\" in 1 Kings xxi:10, and Job ii:9, and for all\nthings being referred to God, whence it appears that the Bible seems to\nrelate nothing but miracles, even when speaking of the most ordinary\noccurrences, as in the examples given above.\n(114) Hence we must believe that when the Bible says that the Lord hardened\nPharaoh's heart, it only means that Pharaoh was obstinate; when it says that\nGod opened the windows of heaven, it only means that it rained very hard,\nand so on. (115) When we reflect on these peculiarities, and also on the\nfact that most things are related very shortly, with very little details and\nalmost in abridgments, we shall see that there is hardly anything in\nScripture which can be proved contrary to natural reason, while, on the\nother hand, many things which before seemed obscure, will after a little\nconsideration be understood and easily explained.\n(116) I think I have now very clearly explained all that I proposed to\nexplain, but before I finish this chapter I would call attention to the fact\nthat I have adopted a different method in speaking of miracles to that which\nI employed in treating of prophecy. (117) Of prophecy I have asserted\nnothing which could not be inferred from promises revealed in Scripture,\nwhereas in this chapter I have deduced my conclusions solely from the\nprinciples ascertained by the natural light of reason. (118) I have\nproceeded in this way advisedly, for prophecy, in that it surpasses human\nknowledge, is a purely theological question; therefore, I knew that I could\nnot make any assertions about it, nor learn wherein it consists, except\nthrough deductions from premises that have been revealed; therefore I was\ncompelled to collate the history of prophecy, and to draw therefrom certain\nconclusions which would teach me, in so far as such teaching is possible,\nthe nature and properties of the gift. (119) But in the case of miracles, as\nour inquiry is a question purely philosophical (namely, whether anything can\nhappen which contravenes or does not follow from the laws of nature), I was\nnot under any such necessity: I therefore thought it wiser to unravel the\ndifficulty through premises ascertained and thoroughly known by the\nnatural light of reason. I say I thought it wiser, for I could also\neasily have solved the problem merely from the doctrines and\nfundamental principles of Scripture: in order that everyone may\nacknowledge this, I will briefly show how it could be done.\n(120) Scripture makes the general assertion in several passages that\nnature's course is fixed and unchangeable. (121) In Ps. cxlviii:6, for\ninstance, and Jer. xxxi:35. (122) The wise man also, in Eccles. i:10,\ndistinctly teaches that \"there is nothing new under the sun,\" and in verses\n11, 12, illustrating the same idea, he adds that although something\noccasionally happens which seems new, it is not really new, but \"hath been\nalready of old time, which was before us, whereof there is no remembrance,\nneither shall there be any remembrance of things that are to come with\nthose that come after.\" (123) Again in chap. iii:11, he says, \"God hath made\neverything beautiful in his time,\" and immediately afterwards adds, \"I know\nthat whatsoever God doeth, it shall be for ever; nothing can be put to it,\nnor anything taken from it.\"\n(124) Now all these texts teach most distinctly that nature preserves a\nfixed and unchangeable order, and that God in all ages, known and unknown,\nhas been the same; further, that the laws of nature are so perfect, that\nnothing can be added thereto nor taken therefrom; and, lastly, that miracles\nonly appear as something new because of man's ignorance.\n(125) Such is the express teaching of Scripture: nowhere does Scripture\nassert that anything happens which contradicts, or cannot follow from the\nlaws of nature; and, therefore, we should not attribute to it such a\ndoctrine.\n(126) To these considerations we must add, that miracles require causes and\nattendant circumstances, and that they follow, not from some mysterious\nroyal power which the masses attribute to God, but from the Divine rule and\ndecree, that is (as we have shown from Scripture itself) from the laws and\norder of nature; lastly, that miracles can be wrought even by false\nprophets, as is proved from Deut. xiii. and Matt. xxiv:24.\n(127) The conclusion, then, that is most plainly put before us is, that\nmiracles were natural occurrences, and must therefore be so explained as to\nappear neither new (in the words of Solomon) nor contrary to nature, but, as\nfar as possible, in complete agreement with ordinary events. (128) This can\neasily be done by anyone, now that I have set forth the rules drawn from\nScripture. (129) Nevertheless, though I maintain that Scripture teaches this\ndoctrine, I do not assert that it teaches it as a truth necessary to\nsalvation, but only that the prophets were in agreement with ourselves on\nthe point; therefore everyone is free to think on the subject as he\nlikes, according as he thinks it best for himself, and most likely to\nconduce to the worship of God and to singlehearted religion.\n(130) This is also the opinion of Josephus, for at the conclusion of the\nsecond book of his \"Antiquities,\" he writes: Let no man think this story\nincredible of the sea's dividing to save these people, for we find it in\nancient records that this hath been seen before, whether by God's\nextraordinary will or by the course of nature it is indifferent. (131) The\nsame thing happened one time to the Macedonians, under the command of\nAlexander, when for want of another passage the Pamphylian Sea divided to\nmake them way; God's Providence making use of Alexander at that time as His\ninstrument for destroying the Persian Empire. (132) This is attested by all\nthe historians who have pretended to write the Life of that Prince. (133)\nBut people are at liberty to think what they please.\"\n(134) Such are the words of Josephus, and such is his opinion on faith in\nmiracles.\nCHAPTER VII. - OF THE INTERPRETATION OF SCRIPTURE\n(1) When people declare, as all are ready to do, that the Bible is the Word\nof God teaching man true blessedness and the way of salvation, they\nevidently do not mean what they say; for the masses take no pains at all to\nlive according to Scripture, and we see most people endeavouring to hawk\nabout their own commentaries as the word of God, and giving their best\nefforts, under the guise of religion, to compelling others to think as they\ndo: we generally see, I say, theologians anxious to learn how to wring their\ninventions and sayings out of the sacred text, and to fortify them with\nDivine authority. (2) Such persons never display, less scruple or\nmore zeal than when they, are interpreting Scripture or the mind of the Holy\nGhost; if we ever see them perturbed, it is not that they fear to attribute\nsome error to the Holy Spirit, and to stray from the right path, but that\nthey are afraid to be convicted of error by others, and thus to overthrow\nand bring into contempt their own authority. (3) But if men really believed\nwhat they verbally testify of Scripture, they would adopt quite a different\nplan of life: their minds would not be agitated by so many contentions, nor\nso many hatreds, and they would cease to be excited by such a blind and rash\npassion for interpreting the sacred writings, and excogitating novelties\nin religion. (4) On the contrary, they would not dare to adopt, as the\nteaching of Scripture, anything which they could not plainly deduce\ntherefrom: lastly, those sacrilegious persons who have dared, in several\npassages, to interpolate the Bible, would have shrunk from so great a\ncrime, and would have stayed their sacrilegious hands.\n(5) Ambition and unscrupulousness have waxed so powerful, that religion is\nthought to consist, not so much in respecting the writings of the Holy\nGhost, as in defending human commentaries, so that religion is no longer\nidentified with charity, but with spreading discord and propagating\ninsensate hatred disguised under the name of zeal for the Lord, and eager\nardour.\n(6) To these evils we must add superstition, which teaches men to despise\nreason and nature, and only to admire and venerate that which is repugnant\nto both: whence it is not wonderful that for the sake of increasing the\nadmiration and veneration felt for Scripture, men strive to explain it so as\nto make it appear to contradict, as far as possible, both one and the other:\nthus they dream that most profound mysteries lie hid in the Bible, and weary\nthemselves out in the investigation of these absurdities, to the neglect of\nwhat is useful. (7) Every result of their diseased imagination they\nattribute to the Holy Ghost, and strive to defend with the utmost zeal and\npassion; for it is an observed fact that men employ their reason to defend\nconclusions arrived at by reason, but conclusions arrived at by the passions\nare defended by the passions.\n(8) If we would separate ourselves from the crowd and escape from\ntheological prejudices, instead of rashly accepting human commentaries for\nDivine documents, we must consider the true method of interpreting Scripture\nand dwell upon it at some length: for if we remain in ignorance of this we\ncannot know, certainly, what the Bible and the Holy Spirit wish to teach.\n(9)I may sum up the matter by saying that the method of interpreting\nScripture does not widely differ from the method of interpreting nature - in\nfact, it is almost the same. (10) For as the interpretation of nature\nconsists in the examination of the history of nature, and therefrom\ndeducing definitions of natural phenomena on certain fixed axioms, so\nScriptural interpretation proceeds by the examination of Scripture, and\ninferring the intention of its authors as a legitimate conclusion from its\nfundamental principles. (11) By working in this manner everyone will\nalways advance without danger of error - that is, if they admit no\nprinciples for interpreting Scripture, and discussing its contents save such\nas they find in Scripture itself - and will be able with equal security to\ndiscuss what surpasses our understanding, and what is known by the natural\nlight of reason.\n(12) In order to make clear that such a method is not only correct, but is\nalso the only one advisable, and that it agrees with that employed in\ninterpreting nature, I must remark that Scripture very often treats of\nmatters which cannot be deduced from principles known to reason: for it is\nchiefly made up of narratives and revelation: the narratives generally\ncontain miracles - that is, as we have shown in the last chapter, relations\nof extraordinary natural occurrences adapted to the opinions and judgment of\nthe historians who recorded them: the revelations also were adapted to the\nopinions of the prophets, as we showed in Chap. II., and in themselves\nsurpassed human comprehension. (13) Therefore the knowledge of all these -\nthat is, of nearly the whole contents of Scripture, must be sought from\nScripture alone, even as the knowledge of nature is sought from nature. (14)\nAs for the moral doctrines which are also contained in the Bible, they may\nbe demonstrated from received axioms, but we cannot prove in the same manner\nthat Scripture intended to teach them, this can only be learned from\nScripture itself.\n(15) If we would bear unprejudiced witness to the Divine origin of\nScripture, we must prove solely on its own authority that it teaches true\nmoral doctrines, for by such means alone can its Divine origin be\ndemonstrated: we have shown that the certitude of the prophets depended\nchiefly on their having minds turned towards what is just and good,\ntherefore we ought to have proof of their possessing this quality before we\nrepose faith in them. (16) From miracles God's divinity cannot be proved, as\nI have already shown, and need not now repeat, for miracles could be\nwrought by false prophets. (17) Wherefore the Divine origin of Scripture\nmust consist solely in its teaching true virtue. (18) But we must come to\nour conclusion simply on Scriptural grounds, for if we were unable to do so\nwe could not, unless strongly prejudiced accept the Bible and bear\nwitness to its Divine origin.\n(19) Our knowledge of Scripture must then be looked for in Scripture only.\n(20) Lastly, Scripture does not give us definition of things any more than\nnature does: therefore, such definitions must be sought in the latter case\nfrom the diverse workings of nature; in the former case, from the various\nnarratives about the given subject which occur in the Bible.\n(21) The universal rule, then, in interpreting Scripture is to accept\nnothing as an authoritative Scriptural statement which we do not perceive\nvery clearly when we examine it in the light of its history. (22) What I\nmean by its history, and what should be the chief points elucidated, I will\nnow explain.\n(23) The history of a Scriptural statement comprises -\n(23) I. The nature and properties of the language in which the books of the\nBible were written, and in which their authors were, accustomed to speak.\n(24) We shall thus be able to investigate every expression by comparison\nwith common conversational usages.\n(25) Now all the writers both of the Old Testament and the New were Hebrews:\ntherefore, a knowledge of the Hebrew language is before all things\nnecessary, not only for the comprehension of the Old Testament, which was\nwritten in that tongue, but also of the New: for although the latter was\npublished in other languages, yet its characteristics are Hebrew.\n(26) II. An analysis of each book and arrangement of its contents under\nheads; so that we may have at hand the various texts which treat of a given\nsubject. (27) Lastly, a note of all the passages which are ambiguous or\nobscure, or which seem mutually contradictory.\n(28) I call passages clear or obscure according as their meaning is inferred\neasily or with difficulty in relation to the context, not according as their\ntruth is perceived easily or the reverse by reason. (29) We are at work not\non the truth of passages, but solely on their meaning. (30) We must take\nespecial care, when we are in search of the meaning of a text, not to be led\naway by our reason in so far as it is founded on principles of natural\nknowledge (to say nothing of prejudices): in order not to confound the\nmeaning of a passage with its truth, we must examine it solely by means of\nthe signification of the words, or by a reason acknowledging no foundation\nbut Scripture.\n(31) I will illustrate my meaning by an example. (32) The words of Moses,\n\"God is a fire\" and \"God is jealous,\" are perfectly clear so long as we\nregard merely the signification of the words, and I therefore reckon them\namong the clear passages, though in relation to reason and truth they are\nmost obscure: still, although the literal meaning is repugnant to the\nnatural light of reason, nevertheless, if it cannot be clearly overruled on\ngrounds and principles derived from its Scriptural \"history,\" it, that is,\nthe literal meaning, must be the one retained: and contrariwise if these\npassages literally interpreted are found to clash with principles derived\nfrom Scripture, though such literal interpretation were in absolute harmony\nwith reason, they must be interpreted in a different manner, i.e.\nmetaphorically.\n(33) If we would know whether Moses believed God to be a fire or not, we\nmust on no account decide the question on grounds of the reasonableness or\nthe reverse of such an opinion, but must judge solely by the other opinions\nof Moses which are on record.\n(34) In the present instance, as Moses says in several other passages that\nGod has no likeness to any visible thing, whether in heaven or in earth, or\nin the water, either all such passages must be taken metaphorically, or else\nthe one before us must be so explained. (35) However, as we should depart as\nlittle as possible from the literal sense, we must first ask whether this\ntext, God is a fire, admits of any but the literal meaning - that is,\nwhether the word fire ever means anything besides ordinary natural fire.\n(36) If no such second meaning can be found, the text must be taken\nliterally, however repugnant to reason it may be: and all the other\npassages, though in complete accordance with reason, must be brought into\nharmony with it. (37) If the verbal expressions would not admit of being\nthus harmonized, we should have to set them down as irreconcilable, and\nsuspend our judgment concerning them. (38) However, as we find the name fire\napplied to anger and jealousy (see Job xxxi:12) we can thus easily reconcile\nthe words of Moses, and legitimately conclude that the two propositions God\nis a fire, and God is jealous, are in meaning identical.\n(39) Further, as Moses clearly teaches that God is jealous, and nowhere\nstates that God is without passions or emotions, we must evidently infer\nthat Moses held this doctrine himself, or at any rate, that he wished to\nteach it, nor must we refrain because such a belief seems contrary to\nreason: for as we have shown, we cannot wrest the meaning of texts to suit\nthe dictates of our reason, or our preconceived opinions. (40) The whole\nknowledge of the Bible must be sought solely from itself.\n(41) III. Lastly, such a history should relate the environment of all the\nprophetic books extant; that is, the life, the conduct, and the studies of\nthe author of each book, who he was, what was the occasion, and the epoch of\nhis writing, whom did he write for, and in what language. (42) Further,\nit should inquire into the fate of each book: how it was first received,\ninto whose hands it fell, how many different versions there were of it, by\nwhose advice was it received into the Bible, and, lastly, how all the books\nnow universally accepted as sacred, were united into a single whole.\n(43) All such information should, as I have said, be contained in the\n\"history\" of Scripture. (44) For, in order to know what statements are set\nforth as laws, and what as moral precepts, it is important to be acquainted\nwith the life, the conduct, and the pursuits of their author: moreover,\nit becomes easier to explain a man's writings in proportion as we have more\nintimate knowledge of his genius and temperament.\n(45) Further, that we may not confound precepts which are eternal with those\nwhich served only a temporary purpose, or were only meant for a few, we\nshould know what was the occasion, the time, the age, in which each book was\nwritten, and to what nation it was addressed.(46) Lastly, we should have\nknowledge on the other points I have mentioned, in order to be sure,\nin addition to the authenticity of the work, that it has not been tampered\nwith by sacrilegious hands, or whether errors can have crept in, and, if so,\nwhether they have been corrected by men sufficiently skilled and worthy of\ncredence. (47) All these things should be known, that we may not be led away\nby blind impulse to accept whatever is thrust on our notice, instead of only\nthat which is sure and indisputable.\n(48) Now when we are in possession of this history of Scripture, and have\nfinally decided that we assert nothing as prophetic doctrine which does not\ndirectly follow from such history, or which is not clearly deducible from\nit, then, I say, it will be time to gird ourselves for the task of\ninvestigating the mind of the prophets and of the Holy Spirit. (49) But in\nthis further arguing, also, we shall require a method very like that\nemployed in interpreting nature from her history. (50) As in the examination\nof natural phenomena we try first to investigate what is most universal\nand common to all nature - such, for instance, as motion and rest, and their\nlaws and rules, which nature always observes, and through which she\ncontinually works - and then we proceed to what is less universal; so, too,\nin the history of Scripture, we seek first for that which is most universal,\nand serves for the basis and foundation of all Scripture, a doctrine, in\nfact, that is commended by all the prophets as eternal and most profitable\nto all men. (51) For example, that God is one, and that He is omnipotent,\nthat He alone should be worshipped, that He has a care for all men, and that\nHe especially loves those who adore Him and love their neighbour as\nthemselves, &c. (52) These and similar doctrines, I repeat, Scripture\neverywhere so clearly and expressly teaches, that no one was ever in doubt\nof its meaning concerning them.\n(53) The nature of God, His manner of regarding and providing for things,\nand similar doctrines, Scripture nowhere teaches professedly, and as eternal\ndoctrine; on the contrary, we have shown that the prophets themselves did\nnot agree on the subject; therefore, we must not lay down any doctrine as\nScriptural on such subjects, though it may appear perfectly clear on\nrational grounds.\n(54) From a proper knowledge of this universal doctrine of Scripture, we\nmust then proceed to other doctrines less universal, but which,\nnevertheless, have regard to the general conduct of life, and flow from the\nuniversal doctrine like rivulets from a source; such are all particular\nexternal manifestations of true virtue, which need a given occasion for\ntheir exercise; whatever is obscure or ambiguous on such points in Scripture\nmust be explained and defined by its universal doctrine; with regard to\ncontradictory instances, we must observe the occasion and the time in which\nthey were written. (55) For instance, when Christ says, \"Blessed are they\nthat mourn, for they shall be comforted\" we do not know, from the actual\npassage, what sort of mourners are meant; as, however, Christ afterwards\nteaches that we should have care for nothing, save only for the kingdom of\nGod and His righteousness, which is commended as the highest good (see\nMatt. vi:33), it follows that by mourners He only meant those who mourn for\nthe kingdom of God and righteousness neglected by man: for this would be the\nonly cause of mourning to those who love nothing but the Divine kingdom and\njustice, and who evidently despise the gifts of fortune. (56) So, too, when\nChrist says: \"But if a man strike you on the right cheek, turn to him the\nleft also,\" and the words which follow.\n(57) If He had given such a command, as a lawgiver, to judges, He would\nthereby have abrogated the law of Moses, but this He expressly says He did\nnot do (Matt. v:17). (58) Wherefore we must consider who was the speaker,\nwhat was the occasion, and to whom were the words addressed. (59) Now Christ\nsaid that He did not ordain laws as a legislator, but inculcated precepts as\na teacher: inasmuch as He did not aim at correcting outward actions so\nmuch as the frame of mind. (60) Further, these words were spoken to men who\nwere oppressed, who lived in a corrupt commonwealth on the brink of ruin,\nwhere justice was utterly neglected. (61) The very doctrine inculcated here\nby Christ just before the destruction of the city was also taught by\nJeremiah before the first destruction of Jerusalem, that is, in similar\ncircumstances, as we see from Lamentations iii:25-30.\n(62) Now as such teaching was only set forth by the prophets in times of\noppression, and was even then never laid down as a law; and as, on the other\nhand, Moses (who did not write in times of oppression, but - mark this -\nstrove to found a well-ordered commonwealth), while condemning envy and\nhatred of one's neighbour, yet ordained that an eye should be given for\nan eye, it follows most clearly from these purely Scriptural grounds that\nthis precept of Christ and Jeremiah concerning submission to injuries was\nonly valid in places where justice is neglected, and in a time of\noppression, but does not hold good in a well-ordered state.\n(63) In a well-ordered state where justice is administered every one is\nbound, if he would be accounted just, to demand penalties before the judge\n(see Lev:1), not for the sake of vengeance (Lev. xix:17, 18), but in order\nto defend justice and his country's laws, and to prevent the wicked\nrejoicing in their wickedness. (64) All this is plainly in accordance with\nreason. (65) I might cite many other examples in the same manner, but I\nthink the foregoing are sufficient to explain my meaning and the utility of\nthis method, and this is all my present purpose. (66) Hitherto we have only\nshown how to investigate those passages of Scripture which treat of\npractical conduct, and which, therefore, are more easily examined, for on\nsuch subjects there was never really any controversy among the writers of\nthe Bible.\n(67) The purely speculative passages cannot be so easily traced to their\nreal meaning: the way becomes narrower, for as the prophets differed in\nmatters speculative among themselves, and the narratives are in great\nmeasure adapted to the prejudices of each age, we must not, on any account\ninfer the intention of one prophet from clearer passages in the writings of\nanother; nor must we so explain his meaning, unless it is perfectly plain\nthat the two prophets were at one in the matter.\n(68) How we are to arrive at the intention of the prophets in such cases I\nwill briefly explain. (69) Here, too, we must begin from the most universal\nproposition, inquiring first from the most clear Scriptural statements what\nis the nature of prophecy or revelation, and wherein does it consist; then\nwe must proceed to miracles, and so on to whatever is most general till we\ncome to the opinions of a particular prophet, and, at last, to the meaning\nof a particular revelation, prophecy, history, or miracle. (70) We have\nalready pointed out that great caution is necessary not to confound the mind\nof a prophet or historian with the mind of the Holy Spirit and the truth\nof the matter; therefore I need not dwell further on the subject. (71) I\nwould, however, here remark concerning the meaning of revelation, that the\npresent method only teaches us what the prophets really saw or heard, not\nwhat they desired to signify or represent by symbols. (72) The latter may be\nguessed at but cannot be inferred with certainty from Scriptural premises.\n(73) We have thus shown the plan for interpreting Scripture, and have, at\nthe same time, demonstrated that it is the one and surest way of\ninvestigating its true meaning. (74) I am willing indeed to admit that those\npersons (if any such there be) would be more absolutely certainly right, who\nhave received either a trustworthy tradition or an assurance from the\nprophets themselves, such as is claimed by the Pharisees; or who have a\npontiff gifted with infallibility in the interpretation of Scripture, such\nas the Roman Catholics boast. (75) But as we can never be perfectly sure,\neither of such a tradition or of the authority of the pontiff, we cannot\nfound any certain conclusion on either: the one is denied by the oldest sect\nof Christians, the other by the oldest sect of Jews. (76) Indeed, if we\nconsider the series of years (to mention no other point) accepted by the\nPharisees from their Rabbis, during which time they say they have handed\ndown the tradition from Moses, we shall find that it is not correct, as I\nshow elsewhere. (77) Therefore such a tradition should be received with\nextreme suspicion; and although, according to our method, we are bound to\nconsider as uncorrupted the tradition of the Jews, namely, the meaning of\nthe Hebrew words which we received from them, we may accept the latter while\nretaining our doubts about the former.\n(78) No one has ever been able to change the meaning of a word in ordinary\nuse, though many have changed the meaning of a particular sentence. (79)\nSuch a proceeding would be most difficult; for whoever attempted to change\nthe meaning of a word, would be compelled, at the same time, to explain all\nthe authors who employed it, each according to his temperament and\nintention, or else, with consummate cunning, to falsify them.\n(80) Further, the masses and the learned alike preserve language, but it is\nonly the learned who preserve the meaning of particular sentences and books:\nthus, we may easily imagine that the learned having a very rare book in\ntheir power, might change or corrupt the meaning of a sentence in it, but\nthey could not alter the signification of the words; moreover, if anyone\nwanted to change the meaning of a common word he would not be able to keep\nup the change among posterity, or in common parlance or writing.\n(81) For these and such-like reasons we may readily conclude that it would\nnever enter into the mind of anyone to corrupt a language, though the\nintention of a writer may often have been falsified by changing his phrases\nor interpreting them amiss. (82) As then our method (based on the principle\nthat the knowledge of Scripture must be sought from itself alone) is the\nsole true one, we must evidently renounce any knowledge which it cannot\nfurnish for the complete understanding of Scripture. (83) I will now point\nout its difficulties and shortcomings, which prevent our gaining a complete\nand assured knowledge of the Sacred Text.\n(84) Its first great difficulty consists in its requiring a thorough\nknowledge of the Hebrew language. (85) Where is such knowledge to be\nobtained? (86) The men of old who employed the Hebrew tongue have left none\nof the principles and bases of their language to posterity; we have from\nthem absolutely nothing in the way of dictionary, grammar, or rhetoric.\n(87) Now the Hebrew nation has lost all its grace and beauty (as one would\nexpect after the defeats and persecutions it has gone through), and has only\nretained certain fragments of its language and of a few books. (88) Nearly\nall the names of fruits, birds, and fishes, and many other words have\nperished in the wear and tear of time. (89) Further, the meaning of many\nnouns and verbs which occur in the Bible are either utterly lost, or are\nsubjects of dispute. (90) And not only are these gone, but we are lacking in\na knowledge of Hebrew phraseology. (91) The devouring tooth of time has\ndestroyed turns of expression peculiar to the Hebrews, so that we know them\nno more.\n(92) Therefore we cannot investigate as we would all the meanings of a\nsentence by the uses of the language; and there are many phrases of which\nthe meaning is most obscure or altogether inexplicable, though the component\nwords are perfectly plain.\n(93) To this impossibility of tracing the history of the Hebrew language\nmust be added its particular nature and composition: these give rise to so\nmany ambiguities that it is impossible to find a method which would\nenable us to gain a certain knowledge of all the statements in Scripture,\n[Endnote 7]. (94) In addition to the sources of ambiguities common to all\nlanguages, there are many peculiar to Hebrew. (95) These, I think, it worth\nwhile to mention.\n(96) Firstly, an ambiguity often arises in the Bible from our mistaking one\nletter for another similar one. (97) The Hebrews divide the letters of the\nalphabet into five classes, according to the five organs of the month\nemployed in pronouncing them, namely, the lips, the tongue, the teeth, the\npalate, and the throat. (98) For instance, Alpha, Ghet, Hgain, He, are\ncalled gutturals, and are barely distinguishable, by any sign that we know,\none from the other. (99) El, which signifies to, is often taken for hgal,\nwhich signifies above, and vice versa. (100) Hence sentences are often\nrendered rather ambiguous or meaningless.\n(101) A second difficulty arises from the multiplied meaning of conjunctions\nand adverbs. (102) For instance, vau serves promiscuously for a particle of\nunion or of separation, meaning, and, but, because, however, then: ki, has\nseven or eight meanings, namely, wherefore, although, if, when, inasmuch as,\nbecause, a burning, &c., and so on with almost all particles.\n(103) The third very fertile source of doubt is the fact that Hebrew verbs\nin the indicative mood lack the present, the past imperfect, the pluperfect,\nthe future perfect, and other tenses most frequently employed in other\nlanguages; in the imperative and infinitive moods they are wanting in all\nexcept the present, and a subjunctive mood does not exist. (104) Now,\nalthough all these defects in moods and tenses may be supplied by certain\nfundamental rules of the language with ease and even elegance, the ancient\nwriters evidently neglected such rules altogether, and employed\nindifferently future for present and past, and vice versa past for future,\nand also indicative for imperative and subjunctive, with the result of\nconsiderable confusion.\n(105) Besides these sources of ambiguity there are two others, one very\nimportant. (106) Firstly, there are in Hebrew no vowels; secondly, the\nsentences are not separated by any marks elucidating the meaning or\nseparating the clauses. (107) Though the want of these two has generally\nbeen supplied by points and accents, such substitutes cannot be accepted by\nus, inasmuch as they were invented and designed by men of an after age whose\nauthority should carry no weight. (108) The ancients wrote without points\n(that is, without vowels and accents), as is abundantly testified; their\ndescendants added what was lacking, according to their own ideas of\nScriptural interpretation; wherefore the existing accents and points are\nsimply current interpretations, and are no more authoritative than any other\ncommentaries.\n(109) Those who are ignorant of this fact cannot justify the author of the\nEpistle to the Hebrews for interpreting (chap. xi:21) Genesis (xlvii:31)\nvery differently from the version given in our Hebrew text as at present\npointed, as though the Apostle had been obliged to learn the meaning of\nScripture from those who added the points. (110) In my opinion the latter\nare clearly wrong. (111) In order that everyone may judge for himself, and\nalso see how the discrepancy arose simply from the want of vowels, I will\ngive both interpretations. (112)Those who pointed our version read, \"And\nIsrael bent himself over, or (changing Hqain into Aleph, a similar letter)\ntowards, the head of the bed.\" (113) The author of the Epistle reads, \"And\nIsrael bent himself over the head of his staff,\" substituting mate for mita,\nfrom which it only differs in respect of vowels. (114) Now as in this\nnarrative it is Jacob's age only that is in question, and not his illness,\nwhich is not touched on till the next chapter, it seems more likely that the\nhistorian intended to say that Jacob bent over the head of his staff (a\nthing commonly used by men of advanced age for their support) than that he\nbowed himself at the head of his bed, especially as for the former reading\nno substitution of letters is required. (115) In this example I have desired\nnot only to reconcile the passage in the Epistle with the passage in\nGenesis, but also and chiefly to illustrate how little trust should be\nplaced in the points and accents which are found in our present Bible, and\nso to prove that he who would be without bias in interpreting Scripture\nshould hesitate about accepting them, and inquire afresh for himself. (116)\nSuch being the nature and structure of the Hebrew language, one may easily\nunderstand that many difficulties are likely to arise, and that no possible\nmethod could solve all of them. (117) It is useless to hope for a way out of\nour difficulties in the comparison of various parallel passages (we have\nshown that the only method of discovering the true sense of a passage out of\nmany alternative ones is to see what are the usages of the language), for\nthis comparison of parallel passages can only accidentally throw light on a\ndifficult point, seeing that the prophets never wrote with the express\nobject of explaining their own phrases or those of other people, and also\nbecause we cannot infer the meaning of one prophet or apostle by the meaning\nof another, unless on a purely practical question, not when the matter is\nspeculative, or if a miracle, or history is being narrated. (118) I might\nillustrate my point with instances, for there are many inexplicable phrases\nin Scripture, but I would rather pass on to consider the difficulties and\nimperfections of the method under discussion.\n(119) A further difficulty attends the method, from the fact that it\nrequires the history of all that has happened to every book in the Bible;\nsuch a history we are often quite unable to furnish. (120) Of the authors,\nor (if the expression be preferred), the writers of many of the books, we\nare either in complete ignorance, or at any rate in doubt, as I will point\nout at length. (121) Further, we do not know either the occasions or the\nepochs when these books of unknown authorship were written; we cannot say\ninto what hands they fell, nor how the numerous varying versions\noriginated; nor, lastly, whether there were not other versions, now lost.\n(122) I have briefly shown that such knowledge is necessary, but I passed\nover certain considerations which I will now draw attention to.\n(123) If we read a book which contains incredible or impossible narratives,\nor is written in a very obscure style, and if we know nothing of its author,\nnor of the time or occasion of its being written, we shall vainly endeavour\nto gain any certain knowledge of its true meaning. (124) For being in\nignorance on these points we cannot possibly know the aim or intended aim of\nthe author; if we are fully informed, we so order our thoughts as not to be\nin any way prejudiced either in ascribing to the author or him for whom the\nauthor wrote either more or less than his meaning, and we only take into\nconsideration what the author may have had in his mind, or what the time and\noccasion demanded. (125) I think this must be tolerably evident to all.\n(126) It often happens that in different books we read histories in\nthemselves similar, but which we judge very differently, according to the\nopinions we have formed of the authors. (127) I remember once to have read\nin some book that a man named Orlando Furioso used to drive a kind of winged\nmonster through the air, fly over any countries he liked, kill unaided vast\nnumbers of men and giants, and such like fancies, which from the point of\nview of reason are obviously absurd. (128) A very similar story I read in\nOvid of Perseus, and also in the books of Judges and Kings of Samson, who\nalone and unarmed killed thousands of men, and of Elijah, who flew through\nthe air, said at last went up to heaven in a chariot of fire, with horses of\nfire. (129) All these stories are obviously alike, but we judge them very\ndifferently. (130) The first only sought to amuse, the second had a\npolitical object, the third a religious object.(131) We gather this simply\nfrom the opinions we had previously formed of the authors. (132) Thus it\nis evidently necessary to know something of the authors of writings which\nare obscure or unintelligible, if we would interpret their meaning; and for\nthe same reason, in order to choose the proper reading from among a great\nvariety, we ought to have information as to the versions in which the\ndifferences are found, and as to the possibility of other readings having\nbeen discovered by persons of greater authority.\n(133) A further difficulty attends this method in the case of some of the\nbooks of Scripture, namely, that they are no longer extant in their original\nlanguage. (133) The Gospel according to Matthew, and certainly the Epistle\nto the Hebrews, were written, it is thought, in Hebrew, though they no\nlonger exist in that form. (134) Aben Ezra affirms in his commentaries that\nthe book of Job was translated into Hebrew out of another language, and that\nits obscurity arises from this fact. (135) I say nothing of the apocryphal\nbooks, for their authority stands on very inferior ground.\n(136) The foregoing difficulties in this method of interpreting Scripture\nfrom its own history, I conceive to be so great that I do not hesitate to\nsay that the true meaning of Scripture is in many places inexplicable, or at\nbest mere subject for guesswork; but I must again point out, on the other\nhand, that such difficulties only arise when we endeavour to follow the\nmeaning of a prophet in matters which cannot be perceived, but only\nimagined, not in things, whereof the understanding can give a clear idea,\nand which are conceivable through themselves: [Endnote 8] matters which by\ntheir nature are easily perceived cannot be expressed so obscurely as to be\nunintelligible; as the proverb says, \"a word is enough to the wise.\" (137)\nEuclid, who only wrote of matters very simple and easily understood, can\neasily be comprehended by anyone in any language; we can follow his\nintention perfectly, and be certain of his true meaning, without having a\nthorough knowledge of the language in which he wrote; in fact, a quite\nrudimentary acquaintance is sufficient. (138) We need make no researches\nconcerning the life, the pursuits, or the habits of the author; nor need we\ninquire in what language, nor when he wrote, nor the vicissitudes of his\nbook, nor its various readings, nor how, nor by whose advice it has been\nreceived.\n(139) What we here say of Euclid might equally be said of any book which\ntreats of things by their nature perceptible: thus we conclude that we can\neasily follow the intention of Scripture in moral questions, from the\nhistory we possess of it, and we can be sure of its true meaning.\n(140) The precepts of true piety are expressed in very ordinary language,\nand are equally simple and easily understood. (141) Further, as true\nsalvation and blessedness consist in a true assent of the soul - and we\ntruly assent only to what we clearly understand - it is most plain that we\ncan follow with certainty the intention of Scripture in matters relating to\nsalvation and necessary to blessedness; therefore, we need not be much\ntroubled about what remains: such matters, inasmuch as we generally cannot\ngrasp them with our reason and understanding, are more curious than\nprofitable.\n(142) I think I have now set forth the true method of Scriptural\ninterpretation, and have sufficiently explained my own opinion thereon.\n(143) Besides, I do not doubt that everyone will see that such a method only\nrequires the aid of natural reason. (144) The nature and efficacy of the\nnatural reason consists in deducing and proving the unknown from the known,\nor in carrying premises to their legitimate conclusions; and these are the\nvery processes which our method desiderates. (145) Though we must admit that\nit does not suffice to explain everything in the Bible, such imperfection\ndoes not spring from its own nature, but from the fact that the path\nwhich it teaches us, as the true one, has never been tended or trodden by\nmen, and has thus, by the lapse of time, become very difficult, and almost\nimpassable, as, indeed, I have shown in the difficulties I draw attention\nto.\n(146) There only remains to examine the opinions of those who differ from\nme. (147) The first which comes under our notice is, that the light of\nnature has no power to interpret Scripture, but that a supernatural faculty\nis required for the task. (148) What is meant by this supernatural faculty I\nwill leave to its propounders to explain. (149) Personally, I can only\nsuppose that they have adopted a very obscure way of stating their complete\nuncertainty about the true meaning of Scripture. (150) If we look at their\ninterpretations, they contain nothing supernatural, at least nothing but the\nmerest conjectures.\n(151) Let them be placed side by side with the interpretations of those who\nfrankly confess that they have no faculty beyond their natural ones; we\nshall see that the two are just alike - both human, both long pondered over,\nboth laboriously invented. (152) To say that the natural reason is\ninsufficient for such results is plainly untrue, firstly, for the reasons\nabove stated, namely, that the difficulty of interpreting Scripture arises\nfrom no defect in human reason, but simply from the carelessness (not to say\nmalice) of men who neglected the history of the Bible while there were still\nmaterials for inquiry; secondly, from the fact (admitted, I think, by all)\nthat the supernatural faculty is a Divine gift granted only to the faithful.\n(153) But the prophets and apostles did not preach to the faithful only, but\nchiefly to the unfaithful and wicked. (154) Such persons, therefore, were\nable to understand the intention of the prophets and apostles, otherwise the\nprophets and apostles would have seemed to be preaching to little boys and\ninfants, not to men endowed with reason. (155) Moses, too, would have given\nhis laws in vain, if they could only be comprehended by the faithful, who\nneed no law. (156) Indeed, those who demand supernatural faculties for\ncomprehending the meaning of the prophets and apostles seem truly lacking in\nnatural faculties, so that we should hardly suppose such persons the\npossessors of a Divine supernatural gift.\n(157) The opinion of Maimonides was widely different. (158) He asserted\nthat each passage in Scripture admits of various, nay, contrary,\nmeanings; but that we could never be certain of any particular one till we\nknew that the passage, as we interpreted it, contained nothing contrary or\nrepugnant to reason. (159) If the literal meaning clashes with reason,\nthough the passage seems in itself perfectly clear, it must be interpreted\nin some metaphorical sense. (160) This doctrine he lays down very plainly in\nchap. xxv. part ii. of his book, \"More Nebuchim,\" for he says: \"Know that we\nshrink not from affirming that the world hath existed from eternity,\nbecause of what Scripture saith concerning the world's creation. (161) For\nthe texts which teach that the world was created are not more in number than\nthose which teach that God hath a body; neither are the approaches in this\nmatter of the world's creation closed, or even made hard to us: so that we\nshould not be able to explain what is written, as we did when we showed\nthat God hath no body, nay, peradventure, we could explain and make fast the\ndoctrine of the world's eternity more easily than we did away with the\ndoctrines that God hath a beatified body. (162) Yet two things hinder me\nfrom doing as I have said, and believing that the world is eternal.\n(163) As it hath been clearly shown that God hath not a body, we must\nperforce explain all those passages whereof the literal sense agreeth not\nwith the demonstration, for sure it is that they can be so explained. (164)\nBut the eternity of the world hath not been so demonstrated, therefore\nit is not necessary to do violence to Scripture in support of some common\nopinion, whereof we might, at the bidding of reason, embrace the contrary.\"\n(165) Such are the words of Maimonides, and they are evidently sufficient to\nestablish our point: for if he had been convinced by reason that the world\nis eternal, he would not have hesitated to twist and explain away the words\nof Scripture till he made them appear to teach this doctrine. (166) He would\nhave felt quite sure that Scripture, though everywhere plainly denying the\neternity of the world, really intends to teach it. (167) So that, however\nclear the meaning of Scripture may be, he would not feel certain of having\ngrasped it, so long as he remained doubtful of the truth of what, was\nwritten. (168) For we are in doubt whether a thing is in conformity with\nreason, or contrary thereto, so long as we are uncertain of its truth,\nand, consequently, we cannot be sure whether the literal meaning of a\npassage be true or false.\n(169) If such a theory as this were sound, I would certainly grant that some\nfaculty beyond the natural reason is required for interpreting Scripture.\n(170) For nearly all things that we find in Scripture cannot be inferred\nfrom known principles of the natural reason, and, therefore, we should be\nunable to come to any conclusion about their truth, or about the real\nmeaning and intention of Scripture, but should stand in need of some\nfurther assistance.\n(171) Further, the truth of this theory would involve that the masses,\nhaving generally no comprehension of, nor leisure for, detailed proofs,\nwould be reduced to receiving all their knowledge of Scripture on the\nauthority and testimony of philosophers, and, consequently, would be\ncompelled to suppose that the interpretations given by philosophers were\ninfallible.\n(172) Truly this would be a new form of ecclesiastical authority, and a new\nsort of priests or pontiffs, more likely to excite men's ridicule than their\nveneration. (173) Certainly our method demands a knowledge of Hebrew for\nwhich the masses have no leisure; but no such objection as the foregoing can\nbe brought against us. (174) For the ordinary Jews or Gentiles, to whom the\nprophets and apostles preached and wrote, understood the language, and,\nconsequently, the intention of the prophet or apostle addressing them; but\nthey did not grasp the intrinsic reason of what was preached, which,\naccording to Maimonides, would be necessary for an understanding of it.\n(175) There is nothing, then, in our method which renders it necessary that\nthe masses should follow the testimony of commentators, for I point to a set\nof unlearned people who understood the language of the prophets and\napostles; whereas Maimonides could not point to any such who could arrive at\nthe prophetic or apostolic meaning through their knowledge of the causes\nof things.\n(176) As to the multitude of our own time, we have shown that whatsoever is\nnecessary to salvation, though its reasons may be unknown, can easily be\nunderstood in any language, because it is thoroughly ordinary and usual; it\nis in such understanding as this that the masses acquiesce, not in the\ntestimony of commentators; with regard to other questions, the ignorant and\nthe learned fare alike.\n(177) But let us return to the opinion of Maimonides, and examine it more\nclosely. In the first place, he supposes that the prophets were in entire\nagreement one with another, and that they were consummate philosophers and\ntheologians; for he would have them to have based their conclusions on the\nabsolute truth. (178) Further, he supposes that the sense of Scripture\ncannot be made plain from Scripture itself, for the truth of things is not\nmade plain therein (in that it does not prove any thing, nor teach the\nmatters of which it speaks through their definitions and first causes),\ntherefore, according to Maimonides, the true sense of Scripture cannot be\nmade plain from itself, and must not be there sought.\n(179) The falsity of such a doctrine is shown in this very chapter, for we\nhave shown both by reason and examples that the meaning of Scripture is only\nmade plain through Scripture itself, and even in questions deducible from\nordinary knowledge should be looked for from no other source.\n(180) Lastly, such a theory supposes that we may explain the words of\nScripture according to our preconceived opinions, twisting them about, and\nreversing or completely changing the literal sense, however plain it may be.\n(181) Such licence is utterly opposed to the teaching of this and the\npreceding chapters, and, moreover, will be evident to everyone as rash and\nexcessive.\n(182) But if we grant all this licence, what can it effect after all?\nAbsolutely nothing. (183) Those things which cannot be demonstrated, and\nwhich make up the greater part of Scripture, cannot be examined by reason,\nand cannot therefore be explained or interpreted by this rule; whereas,\non the contrary, by following our own method, we can explain many questions\nof this nature, and discuss them on a sure basis, as we have already shown,\nby reason and example. (184) Those matters which are by their nature\ncomprehensible we can easily explain, as has been pointed out, simply by\nmeans of the context.\n(185) Therefore, the method of Maimonides is clearly useless: to which we\nmay add, that it does away with all the certainty which the masses acquire\nby candid reading, or which is gained by any other persons in any other way.\n(186) In conclusion, then, we dismiss Maimonides' theory as harmful,\nuseless, and absurd.\n(187) As to the tradition of the Pharisees, we have already shown that it is\nnot consistent, while the authority of the popes of Rome stands in need of\nmore credible evidence; the latter, indeed, I reject simply on this ground,\nfor if the popes could point out to us the meaning of Scripture as surely as\ndid the high priests of the Jews, I should not be deterred by the fact that\nthere have been heretic and impious Roman pontiffs; for among the Hebrew\nhigh-priests of old there were also heretics and impious men who gained the\nhigh- priesthood by improper means, but who, nevertheless, had Scriptural\nsanction for their supreme power of interpreting the law. (See\nDeut. xvii:11, 12, and xxxiii:10, also Malachi ii:8.)\n(188) However, as the popes can show no such sanction, their authority\nremains open to very grave doubt, nor should anyone be deceived by the\nexample of the Jewish high-priests and think that the Catholic religion also\nstands in need of a pontiff; he should bear in mind that the laws of Moses\nbeing also the ordinary laws of the country, necessarily required some\npublic authority to insure their observance; for, if everyone were free to\ninterpret the laws of his country as he pleased, no state could stand, but\nwould for that very reason be dissolved at once, and public rights would\nbecome private rights.\n(189) With religion the case is widely different. Inasmuch as it consists\nnot so much in outward actions as in simplicity and truth of character, it\nstands outside the sphere of law and public authority. (190) Simplicity and\ntruth of character are not produced by the constraint of laws, nor by\nthe authority of the state, no one the whole world over can be forced or\nlegislated into a state of blessedness; the means required for such a\nconsummation are faithful and brotherly admonition, sound education, and,\nabove all, free use of the individual judgment.\n(191) Therefore, as the supreme right of free thinking, even on religion, is\nin every man's power, and as it is inconceivable that such power could be\nalienated, it is also in every man's power to wield the supreme right and\nauthority of free judgment in this behalf, and to explain and interpret\nreligion for himself. (192) The only reason for vesting the supreme\nauthority in the interpretation of law, and judgment on public affairs in\nthe hands of the magistrates, is that it concerns questions of public right.\n(193) Similarly the supreme authority in explaining religion, and in passing\njudgment thereon, is lodged with the individual because it concerns\nquestions of individual right. (194) So far, then, from the authority of the\nHebrew high-priests telling in confirmation of the authority of the Roman\npontiffs to interpret religion, it would rather tend to establish individual\nfreedom of judgment. (195) Thus in this way also, we have shown that our\nmethod of interpreting Scripture is the best. (196) For as the highest power\nof Scriptural interpretation belongs to every man, the rule for such\ninterpretation should be nothing but the natural light of reason which is\ncommon to all - not any supernatural light nor any external authority;\nmoreover, such a rule ought not to be so difficult that it can only be\napplied by very skilful philosophers, but should be adapted to the natural\nand ordinary faculties and capacity of mankind. (197) And such I have shown\nour method to be, for such difficulties as it has arise from men's\ncarelessness, and are no part of its nature.\nCHAPTER VIII. - OF THE AUTHORSHIP OF THE PENTATEUCH AND THE OTHER\nHISTORICAL BOOKS OF THE OLD TESTAMENT\n(1) In the former chapter we treated of the foundations and principles of\nScriptural knowledge, and showed that it consists solely in a trustworthy\nhistory of the sacred writings; such a history, in spite of its\nindispensability, the ancients neglected, or at any rate, whatever they may\nhave written or handed down has perished in the lapse of time, consequently\nthe groundwork for such an investigation is to a great extent, cut from\nunder us. (2) This might be put up with if succeeding generations had\nconfined themselves within the limits of truth, and had handed down\nconscientiously what few particulars they had received or discovered without\nany additions from their own brains: as it is, the history of the Bible is\nnot so much imperfect as untrustworthy: the foundations are not only too\nscanty for building upon, but are also unsound. (3) It is part of my purpose\nto remedy these defects, and to remove common theological prejudices. (4)\nBut I fear that I am attempting my task too late, for men have arrived at\nthe pitch of not suffering contradiction, but defending obstinately whatever\nthey have adopted under the name of religion. (5) So widely have these\nprejudices taken possession of men's minds, that very few, comparatively\nspeaking, will listen to reason. (6) However, I will make the attempt, and\nspare no efforts, for there is no positive reason for despairing of success.\n(7) In order to treat the subject methodically, I will begin with the\nreceived opinions concerning the true authors of the sacred books, and in\nthe first place, speak of the author of the Pentateuch, who is almost\nuniversally supposed to have been Moses. (8) The Pharisees are so firmly\nconvinced of his identity, that they account as a heretic anyone who differs\nfrom them on the subject. (9) Wherefore, Aben Ezra, a man of enlightened\nintelligence, and no small learning, who was the first, so far as I know,\nto treat of this opinion, dared not express his meaning openly, but confined\nhimself to dark hints which I shall not scruple to elucidate, thus throwing\nfull light on the subject.\n(10) The words of Aben Ezra which occur in his commentary on Deuteronomy are\nas follows: \"Beyond Jordan, &c . . . If so be that thou understandest the\nmystery of the twelve . . .  moreover Moses wrote the law . . .  The\nCanaanite was then in the land . . . . it shall be revealed on the mount of\nGod . . . . then also behold his bed, his iron bed, then shalt thou know\nthe truth.\" (11) In these few words he hints, and also shows that it was not\nMoses who wrote the Pentateuch, but someone who lived long after him, and\nfurther, that the book which Moses wrote was something different from any\nnow extant.\n(12) To prove this, I say, he draws attention to the facts:\n(13) 1. That the preface to Deuteronomy could not have been written by\nMoses, inasmuch as he ad never crossed the Jordan.\n(14) II. That the whole book of Moses was written at full length on the\ncircumference of a single altar (Deut. xxvii, and Josh. viii:37), which\naltar, according to the Rabbis, consisted of only twelve stones: therefore\nthe book of Moses must have been of far less extent than the Pentateuch.\n(15) This is what our author means, I think, by the mystery of the twelve,\nunless he is referring to the twelve curses contained in the chapter of\nDeuteronomy above cited, which he thought could not have been contained in\nthe law, because Moses bade the Levites read them after the recital of the\nlaw, and so bind the people to its observance. (16) Or again, he may have\nhad in his mind the last chapter of Deuteronomy which treats of the death of\nMoses, and which contains twelve verses. (17) But there is no need to dwell\nfurther on these and similar conjectures.\n(18) III. That in Deut. xxxi:9, the expression occurs, \"and Moses wrote the\nlaw:\" words that cannot be ascribed to Moses, but must be those of some\nother writer narrating the deeds and writings of Moses.\n(19) IV. That in Genesis xii:6, the historian, after narrating that Abraham\njourneyed through the and of Canaan, adds, \"and the Canaanite was then in\nthe land,\" thus clearly excluding the time at which he wrote. (20) So that\nthis passage must have been written after the death of Moses, when the\nCanaanites had been driven out, and no longer possessed the land.\n(21) Aben Ezra, in his commentary on the passage, alludes to the difficulty\nas follows:- \"And the Canaanite was then in the land: it appears that\nCanaan, the grandson of Noah, took from another the land which bears his\nname; if this be not the true meaning, there lurks some mystery in the\npassage, and let him who understands it keep silence.\" (22) That is, if\nCanaan invaded those regions, the sense will be, the Canaanite was then in\nthe land, in contradistinction to the time when it had been held by another:\nbut if, as follows from Gen. chap. x. Canaan was the first to inhabit the\nland, the text must mean to exclude the time present, that is the time at\nwhich it was written; therefore it cannot be the work of Moses, in\nwhose time the Canaanites still possessed those territories: this is the\nmystery concerning which silence is recommended.\n(23) V. That in Genesis xxii:14 Mount Moriah is called the mount of God\n[Endnote 9] a name which it did not acquire till after the building of the\nTemple; the choice of the mountain was not made in the time of Moses, for\nMoses does not point out any spot as chosen by God; on the contrary, he\nforetells that God will at some future time choose a spot to which this name\nwill be given.\n(24) VI. Lastly, that in Deut. chap. iii., in the passage relating to Og,\nking of Bashan, these words are inserted: \"For only Og king of Bashan\nremained of the remnant of giants: behold, his bedstead was a bedstead of\niron: is it not in Rabbath of the children of Ammon? nine cubits was the\nlength thereof, and four cubits the breadth of it, after the cubit of a\nman.\" (25) This parenthesis most plainly shows that its writer lived long\nafter Moses; for this mode of speaking is only employed by one treating of\nthings long past, and pointing to relics for the sake of gaining credence:\nmoreover, this bed was almost certainly first discovered by David, who\nconquered the city of Rabbath (2 Sam. xii:30.) (26) Again, the historian a\nlittle further on inserts after the words of Moses, \"Jair, the son of\nManasseh, took all the country of Argob unto the coasts of Geshuri and\nMaachathi; and called them after his own name, Bashan-havoth-jair, unto this\nday.\" (27) This passage, I say, is inserted to explain the words of Moses\nwhich precede it. (28) \"And the rest of Gilead, and all Bashan, being the\nkingdom of Og, gave I unto the half tribe of Manasseh; all the region of\nArgob, with all Bashan, which is called the land of the giants.\" (29) The\nHebrews in the time of the writer indisputably knew what territories\nbelonged to the tribe of Judah, but did not know them under the name of the\njurisdiction of Argob, or the land of the giants. (30) Therefore the writer\nis compelled to explain what these places were which were anciently so\nstyled, and at the same time to point out why they were at the time of his\nwriting known by the name of Jair, who was of the tribe of Manasseh, not of\nJudah. (31) We have thus made clear the meaning of Aben Ezra and also the\npassages of the Pentateuch which he cites in proof of his contention. (32)\nHowever, Aben Ezra does not call attention to every instance, or even the\nchief ones; there remain many of greater importance, which may be cited.\n(33) Namely (I.), that the writer of the books in question not only speaks\nof Moses in the third person, but also bears witness to many details\nconcerning him; for instance, \"Moses talked with God;\" \"The Lord spoke with\nMoses face to face;\" \"Moses was the meekest of men\" (Numb. xii:3); \"Moses\nwas wrath with the captains of the host; \"Moses, the man of God, \"Moses, the\nservant of the Lord, died;\" \"There was never a prophet in Israel like\nunto Moses,\" &c. (34) On the other hand, in Deuteronomy, where the law which\nMoses had expounded to the people and written is set forth, Moses speaks and\ndeclares what he has done in the first person: \"God spake with me\" (Deut.\nii:1, 17, &c.), \"I prayed to the Lord,\" &c. (35) Except at the end of the\nbook, when the historian, after relating the words of Moses, begins again to\nspeak in the third person, and to tell how Moses handed over the law which\nhe had expounded to the people in writing, again admonishing them, and\nfurther, how Moses ended his life. (36) All these details, the manner of\nnarration, the testimony, and the context of the whole story lead to the\nplain conclusion that these books were written by another, and not by Moses\nin person.\n(37) III. We must also remark that the history relates not only the manner\nof Moses' death and burial, and the thirty days' mourning of the Hebrews,\nbut further compares him with all the prophets who came after him, and\nstates that he surpassed them all. (38) \"There was never a prophet in Israel\nlike unto Moses, whom the Lord knew face to face.\" (39) Such testimony\ncannot have been given of Moses by himself, nor by any who immediately\nsucceeded him, but it must come from someone who lived centuries afterwards,\nespecially, as the historian speaks of past times. (40) \"There was never a\nprophet,\" &c. (41) And of the place of burial, \"No one knows it to this\nday.\"\n(42) III. We must note that some places are not styled by the names they\nbore during Moses' lifetime, but by others which they obtained subsequently.\n(43) For instance, Abraham is said to have pursued his enemies even unto\nDan, a name not bestowed on the city till long after the death of Joshua\n(Gen. xiv:14, Judges xviii:29).\n(44) IV. The narrative is prolonged after the death of Moses, for in\nExodus xvi:34 we read that \"the children of Israel did eat manna forty\nyears until they came to a land inhabited, until they came unto the borders\nof the land of Canaan.\" (45) In other words, until the time alluded to in\nJoshua vi:12.\n(46) So, too, in Genesis xxxvi:31 it is stated, \"These are the kings that\nreigned in Edom before there reigned any king over the children of Israel.\"\n(47) The historian, doubtless, here relates the kings of Idumaea before that\nterritory was conquered by David [Endnote 10] and garrisoned, as we read\nin 2 Sam. viii:14. (48) From what has been said, it is thus clearer than the\nsun at noonday that the Pentateuch was not written by Moses, but by someone\nwho lived long after Moses. (49) Let us now turn our attention to the books\nwhich Moses actually did write, and which are cited in the Pentateuch; thus,\nalso, shall we see that they were different from the Pentateuch. (50)\nFirstly, it appears from Exodus xvii:14 that Moses, by the command of God,\nwrote an account of the war against Amalek. (51) The book in which he did so\nis not named in the chapter just quoted, but in Numb. xxi:12 a book is\nreferred to under the title of the wars of God, and doubtless this war\nagainst Amalek and the castrametations said in Numb. xxxiii:2 to have been\nwritten by Moses are therein described. (52) We hear also in Exod. xxiv:4 of\nanother book called the Book of the Covenant, which Moses read before the\nIsraelites when they first made a covenant with God. (53) But this book or\nthis writing contained very little, namely, the laws or commandments of God\nwhich we find in Exodus xx:22 to the end of chap. xxiv., and this no one\nwill deny who reads the aforesaid chapter rationally and impartially. (54)\nIt is there stated that as soon as Moses had learnt the feeling of the\npeople on the subject of making a covenant with God, he immediately wrote\ndown God's laws and utterances, and in the morning, after some ceremonies\nhad been performed, read out the conditions of the covenant to an assembly\nof the whole people. (55) When these had been gone through, and doubtless\nunderstood by all, the whole people gave their assent.\n(56) Now from the shortness of the time taken in its perusal and also from\nits nature as a compact, this document evidently contained nothing more than\nthat which we have just described. (57) Further, it is clear that Moses\nexplained all the laws which he had received in the fortieth year after the\nexodus from Egypt; also that he bound over the people a second time to\nobserve them, and that finally he committed them to writing (Deut. i:5;\nxxix:14; xxxi:9), in a book which contained these laws explained, and the\nnew covenant, and this book was therefore called the book of the law of God:\nthe same which was afterwards added to by Joshua when he set forth the fresh\ncovenant with which he bound over the people and which he entered into\nwith God (Josh. xxiv:25, 26).\n(58) Now, as we have extent no book containing this covenant of Moses and\nalso the covenant of Joshua, we must perforce conclude that it has perished,\nunless, indeed, we adopt the wild conjecture of the Chaldean paraphrast\nJonathan, and twist about the words of Scripture to our heart's content.\n(59) This commentator, in the face of our present difficulty, preferred\ncorrupting the sacred text to confessing his own ignorance. (60) The passage\nin the book of Joshua which runs, \"and Joshua wrote these words in the\nbook of the law of God,\" he changes into \"and Joshua wrote these words\nand kept them with the book of the law of God.\" (61) What is to be done with\npersons who will only see what pleases them? (62) What is such a proceeding\nif it is not denying Scripture, and inventing another Bible out of our own\nheads? (63) We may therefore conclude that the book of the law of God which\nMoses wrote was not the Pentateuch, but something quite different, which the\nauthor of the Pentateuch duly inserted into his book. (64) So much is\nabundantly plain both from what I have said and from what I am about to add.\n(65) For in the passage of Deuteronomy above quoted, where it is related\nthat Moses wrote the book of the law, the historian adds that he handed it\nover to the priests and bade them read it out at a stated time to the whole\npeople. (66) This shows that the work was of much less length than the\nPentateuch, inasmuch as it could be read through at one sitting so as to be\nunderstood by all; further, we must not omit to notice that out of all the\nbooks which Moses wrote, this one book of the second covenant and the song\n(which latter he wrote afterwards so that all the people might learn it),\nwas the only one which he caused to be religiously guarded and preserved.\n(67) In the first covenant he had only bound over those who were present,\nbut in the second covenant he bound over all their descendants also (Dent.\nxxix:14), and therefore ordered this covenant with future ages to be\nreligiously preserved, together with the Song, which was especially\naddressed to posterity: as, then, we have no proof that Moses wrote any\nbook save this of the covenant, and as he committed no other to the care of\nposterity; and, lastly, as there are many passages in the Pentateuch which\nMoses could not have written, it follows that the belief that Moses was the\nauthor of the Pentateuch is ungrounded and even irrational. (68) Someone\nwill perhaps ask whether Moses did not also write down other laws when they\nwere first revealed to him - in other words, whether, during the course of\nforty years, he did not write down any of the laws which he promulgated,\nsave only those few which I have stated to be contained in the book of the\nfirst covenant. (69) To this I would answer, that although it seems\nreasonable to suppose that Moses wrote down the laws at the time when he\nwished to communicate them to the people, yet we are not warranted to take\nit as proved, for I have shown above that we must make no assertions in such\nmatters which we do not gather from Scripture, or which do not flow as\nlegitimate consequences from its fundamental principles. (70) We must not\naccept whatever is reasonably probable. (71) However even reason in this\ncase would not force such a conclusion upon us: for it may be that the\nassembly of elders wrote down the decrees of Moses and communicated them to\nthe people, and the historian collected them, and duly set them forth in his\nnarrative of the life of Moses. (72) So much for the five books of Moses: it\nis now time for us to turn to the other sacred writings.\n(73) The book of Joshua may be proved not to be an autograph by reasons\nsimilar to those we have just employed: for it must be some other than\nJoshua who testifies that the fame of Joshua was spread over the whole\nworld; that he omitted nothing of what Moses had taught (Josh. vi:27; viii.\nlast verse; xi:15); that he grew old and summoned an assembly of the whole\npeople, and finally that he departed this life. (74) Furthermore, events are\nrelated which took place after Joshua's death. (75) For instance, that the\nIsraelites worshipped God, after his death, so long as there were any old\nmen alive who remembered him; and in chap. xvi:10, we read that \"Ephraim and\nManasseh did not drive out the Canaanites which dwelt in Gezer, but the\nCanaanite dwelt in the land of Ephraim unto this day, and was tributary to\nhim.\" (76) This is the same statement as that in Judges, chap. i., and the\nphrase \"unto this day\" shows that the writer was speaking of ancient times.\n(77) With these texts we may compare the last verse of chap. xv., concerning\nthe sons of Judah, and also the history of Caleb in the same chap. v:14.\n(78) Further, the building of an altar beyond Jordan by the two tribes and a\nhalf, chap. xxii:10, sqq., seems to have taken place after the death of\nJoshua, for in the whole narrative his name is never mentioned, but the\npeople alone held council as to waging war, sent out legates, waited for\ntheir return, and finally approved of their answer.\n(79) Lastly, from chap. x:14, it is clear that the book was written many\ngenerations after the death of Joshua, for it bears witness, there was\nnever any, day like unto, that day, either before or after, that the Lord\nhearkened to the voice of a man,\" &c. (80) If, therefore, Joshua wrote any\nbook at all, it was that which is quoted in the work now before us,\nchap. x:13.\n(81) With regard to the book of Judges, I suppose no rational person\npersuades himself that it was written by the actual Judges. (82) For the\nconclusion of the whole history contained in chap. ii. clearly shows that it\nis all the work - of a single historian. (83) Further, inasmuch as the\nwriter frequently tells us that there was then no king in Israel, it is\nevident that the book was written after the establishment of the monarchy.\n(84) The books of Samuel need not detain us long, inasmuch as the narrative\nin them is continued long after Samuel's death; but I should like to draw\nattention to the fact that it was written many generations after Samuel's\ndeath. (85) For in book i. chap. ix:9, the historian remarks in a,\nparenthesis, \"Beforetime, in Israel, when a man went to inquire of God, thus\nhe spake: Come, and let us go to the seer; for he that is now called a\nprophet was beforetime called a seer.\"\n(86) Lastly, the books of Kings, as we gather from internal evidence, were\ncompiled from the books of King Solomon (I Kings xi:41), from the chronicles\nof the kings of Judah (1 Kings xiv:19, 29), and the chronicles of the kings\nof Israel.\n(87) We may, therefore, conclude that all the books we have considered\nhitherto are compilations, and that the events therein are recorded as\nhaving happened in old time. (88) Now, if we turn our attention to the\nconnection and argument of all these books, we shall easily see that they\nwere all written by a single historian, who wished to relate the antiquities\nof the Jews from their first beginning down to the first destruction of the\ncity. (89) The way in which the several books are connected one with the\nother is alone enough to show us that they form the narrative of one and the\nsame writer. (90) For as soon as he has related the life of Moses, the\nhistorian thus passes on to the story of Joshua: \"And it came to pass after\nthat Moses the servant of the Lord was dead, that God spake unto Joshua,\"\n&c., so in the same way, after the death of Joshua was concluded, he passes\nwith identically the same transition and connection to the history of the\nJudges: \"And it came to pass after that Joshua was dead, that the children\nof Israel sought from God,\" &c. (91) To the book of Judges he adds the story\nof Ruth, as a sort of appendix, in these words: \"Now it came to pass in the\ndays that the judges ruled, that there was a famine in the land.\"\n(92) The first book of Samuel is introduced with a similar phrase; and so is\nthe second book of Samuel. (93) Then, before the history of David is\nconcluded, the historian passes in the same way to the first book of Kings,\nand, after David's death, to the Second book of Kings.\n(94) The putting together, and the order of the narratives, show that they\nare all the work of one man, writing with a create aim; for the historian\nbegins with relating the first origin of the Hebrew nation, and then sets\nforth in order the times and the occasions in which Moses put forth his\nlaws, and made his predictions. (95) He then proceeds to relate how the\nIsraelites invaded the promised land in accordance with Moses' prophecy\n(Deut. vii.); and how, when the land was subdued, they turned their backs on\ntheir laws, and thereby incurred many misfortunes (Deut. xxxi:16, 17). (96)\nHe tells how they wished to elect rulers, and how, according as these rulers\nobserved the law, the people flourished or suffered (Deut. xxviii:36);\nfinally, how destruction came upon the nation, even as Moses had foretold.\n(97) In regard to other matters, which do not serve to confirm the law, the\nwriter either passes over them in silence, or refers the reader to other\nbooks for information. (98) All that is set down in the books we have\nconduces to the sole object of setting forth the words and laws of Moses,\nand proving them by subsequent events.(99) When we put together these three\nconsiderations, namely, the unity of the subject of all the books, the\nconnection between them, and the fact that they are compilations made many\ngenerations after the events they relate had taken place, we come to the\nconclusion, as I have just stated, that they are all the work of a single\nhistorian. (100) Who this historian was, it is not so easy to show; but I\nsuspect that he was Ezra, and there are several strong reasons for adopting\nthis hypothesis.\n(101) The historian whom we already know to be but one individual brings his\nhistory down to the liberation of Jehoiakim, and adds that he himself sat at\nthe king's table all his life - that is, at the table either of Jehoiakim,\nor of the son of Nebuchadnezzar, for the sense of the passage is ambiguous:\nhence it follows that he did not live before the time of Ezra. (102) But\nScripture does not testify of any except of Ezra (Ezra vii:10), that he\n\"prepared his heart to seek the law of the Lord, and to set it forth, and\nfurther that he was a ready scribe in the law of Moses.\" (103) Therefore, I\ncan not find anyone, save Ezra, to whom to attribute the sacred books.\n(104) Further, from this testimony concerning Ezra, we see that he prepared\nhis heart, not only to seek the law of the Lord, but also to set it forth;\nand, in Nehemiah viii:8, we read that \"they read in the book of the law of\nGod distinctly, and gave the sense, and caused them to understand the\nreading.\"\n(105) As, then, in Deuteronomy, we find not only the book of the law of\nMoses, or the greater part of it, but also many things inserted for its\nbetter explanation, I conjecture that this Deuteronomy is the book of the\nlaw of God, written, set forth, and explained by Ezra, which is referred to\nin the text above quoted. (106) Two examples of the way matters were\ninserted parenthetically in the text of Deuteronomy, with a view to its\nfuller explanation, we have already given, in speaking of Aben Ezra's\nopinion. (107) Many others are found in the course of the work: for\ninstance, in chap. ii:12: \"The Horims dwelt also in Seir beforetime; but the\nchildren of Esau succeeded them, when they had destroyed them from before\nthem, and dwelt in their stead; as Israel did unto the land of his\npossession, which the Lord gave unto them.\" (108) This explains verses 3 and\n4 of the same chapter, where it is stated that Mount Seir, which had come to\nthe children of Esau for a possession, did not fall into their hands\nuninhabited; but that they invaded it, and turned out and destroyed the\nHorims, who formerly dwelt therein, even as the children of Israel had done\nunto the Canaanites after the death of Moses.\n(109) So, also, verses 6, 7, 8, 9, of the tenth chapter are inserted\nparenthetically among the words of Moses. Everyone must see that verse 8,\nwhich begins, \"At that time the Lord separated the tribe of Levi,\"\nnecessarily refers to verse 5, and not to the death of Aaron, which is only\nmentioned here by Ezra because Moses, in telling of the golden calf\nworshipped by the people, stated that he had prayed for Aaron.\n(110) He then explains that at the time at which Moses spoke, God had chosen\nfor Himself the tribe of Levi in order that He may point out the reason for\ntheir election, and for the fact of their not sharing in the inheritance;\nafter this digression, he resumes the thread of Moses' speech. (111) To\nthese parentheses we must add the preface to the book, and all the passages\nin which Moses is spoken of in the third person, besides many which we\ncannot now distinguish, though, doubtless, they would have been plainly\nrecognized by the writer's contemporaries.\n(112) If, I say, we were in possession of the book of the law as Moses wrote\nit, I do not doubt that we should find a great difference in the words of\nthe precepts, the order in which they are given, and the reasons by which\nthey are supported.\n(113) A comparison of the decalogue in Deuteronomy with the decalogue in\nExodus, where its history is explicitly set forth, will be sufficient to\nshow us a wide discrepancy in all these three particulars, for the fourth\ncommandment is given not only in a different form, but at much greater\nlength, while the reason for its observance differs wholly from that stated\nin Exodus. (114) Again, the order in which the tenth commandment is\nexplained differs in the two versions. (115) I think that the differences\nhere as elsewhere are the work of Ezra, who explained the law of God to his\ncontemporaries, and who wrote this book of the law of God, before anything\nelse; this I gather from the fact that it contains the laws of the country,\nof which the people stood in most need, and also because it is not joined to\nthe book which precedes it by any connecting phrase, but begins with the\nindependent statement, \"these are the words of Moses.\" (116) After this task\nwas completed, I think Ezra set himself to give a complete account of the\nhistory of the Hebrew nation from the creation of the world to the entire\ndestruction of the city, and in this account he inserted the book of\nDeuteronomy, and, possibly, he called the first five books by the name of\nMoses, because his life is chiefly contained therein, and forms their\nprincipal subject; for the same reason he called the sixth Joshua, the\nseventh Judges, the eighth Ruth, the ninth, and perhaps the tenth, Samuel,\nand, lastly, the eleventh and twelfth Kings. (117) Whether Ezra put the\nfinishing touches to this work and finished it as he intended, we will\ndiscuss in the next chapter.\nCHAPTER IX - OTHER QUESTIONS CONCERNING THE SAME BOOKS: NAMELY, WHETHER THEY\nWERE COMPLETELY FINISHED BY EZRA, AND, FURTHER, WHETHER THE MARGINAL\nNOTES WHICH ARE FOUND IN THE HEBREW TEXTS WERE VARIOUS READINGS.\n(1) How greatly the inquiry we have just made concerning the real writer of\nthe twelve books aids us in attaining a complete understanding of them, may\nbe easily gathered solely from the passages which we have adduced in\nconfirmation of our opinion, and which would be most obscure without it. (2)\nBut besides the question of the writer, there are other points to notice\nwhich common superstition forbids the multitude to apprehend. (3) Of these\nthe chief is, that Ezra (whom I will take to be the author of the aforesaid\nbooks until some more likely person be suggested) did not put the finishing\ntouches to the narrative contained therein, but merely collected the\nhistories from various writers, and sometimes simply set them down, leaving\ntheir examination and arrangement to posterity.\n(4) The cause (if it were not untimely death) which prevented him from\ncompleting his work in all its portions, I cannot conjecture, but the fact\nremains most clear, although we have lost the writings of the ancient Hebrew\nhistorians, and can only judge from the few fragments which are still\nextant. (5) For the history of Hezekiah (2 Kings xviii:17), as written in\nthe vision of Isaiah, is related as it is found in the chronicles of the\nkings of Judah. (6) We read the same story, told with few exceptions,\n[Endnote 11], in the same words, in the book of Isaiah which was contained\nin the chronicles of the kings of Judah (2 Chron. xxxii:32). (7) From this\nwe must conclude that there were various versions of this narrative of\nIsaiah's, unless, indeed, anyone would dream that in this, too, there lurks\na mystery. (8) Further, the last chapter of 2 Kings 27-30 is repeated in the\nlast chapter of Jeremiah, v.31-34.\n(9) Again, we find 2 Sam. vii. repeated in I Chron. xvii., but the\nexpressions in the two passages are so curiously varied [Endnote 12], that\nwe can very easily see that these two chapters were taken from two different\nversions of the history of Nathan.\n(10) Lastly, the genealogy of the kings of Idumaea contained in Genesis\nxxxvi:31, is repeated in the same words in 1 Chron. i., though we know that\nthe author of the latter work took his materials from other historians, not\nfrom the twelve books we have ascribed to Ezra. (10) We may therefore be\nsure that if we still possessed the writings of the historians, the matter\nwould be made clear; however, as we have lost them, we can only examine the\nwritings still extant, and from their order and connection, their various\nrepetitions, and, lastly, the contradictions in dates which they contain,\njudge of the rest.\n(11) These, then, or the chief of them, we will now go through. (12) First,\nin the story of Judah and Tamar (Gen. xxxviii.) the historian thus begins:\n\"And it came to pass at that time that Judah went down from his brethren.\"\n(13) This time cannot refer to what immediately precedes [Endnote 13], but\nmust necessarily refer to something else, for from the time when Joseph was\nsold into Egypt to the time when the patriarch Jacob, with all his family,\nset out thither, cannot be reckoned as more than twenty-two years, for\nJoseph, when he was sold by his brethren, was seventeen years old, and when\nhe was summoned by Pharaoh from prison was thirty; if to this we add the\nseven years of plenty and two of famine, the total amounts to twenty-two\nyears. (14) Now, in so short a period, no one can suppose that so many\nthings happened as are described; that Judah had three children, one after\nthe other, from one wife, whom he married at the beginning of the period;\nthat the eldest of these, when he was old enough, married Tamar, and that\nafter he died his next brother succeeded to her; that, after all this,\nJudah, without knowing it, had intercourse with his daughter-in-law, and\nthat she bore him twins, and, finally, that the eldest of these twins became\na father within the aforesaid period. (15) As all these events cannot have\ntaken place within the period mentioned in Genesis, the reference must\nnecessarily be to something treated of in another book: and Ezra in this\ninstance simply related the story, and inserted it without examination among\nhis other writings.\n(16) However, not only this chapter but the whole narrative of Joseph and\nJacob is collected and set forth from various histories, inasmuch as it is\nquite inconsistent with itself. (17) For in Gen. xlvii. we are told that\nJacob, when he came at Joseph's bidding to salute Pharaoh, was 130 years\nold. (18) If from this we deduct the twenty-two years which he passed\nsorrowing for the absence of Joseph and the seventeen years forming Joseph's\nage when he was sold, and, lastly, the seven years for which Jacob served\nfor Rachel, we find that he was very advanced in life, namely, eighty four,\nwhen he took Leah to wife, whereas Dinah was scarcely seven years old when\nshe was violated by Shechem, [Endnote 14]. (19) Simeon and Levi were aged\nrespectively eleven and twelve when they spoiled the city and slew all the\nmales therein with the sword.\n(20) There is no need that I should go through the whole Pentateuch. (21) If\nanyone pays attention to the way in which all the histories and precepts in\nthese five books are set down promiscuously and without order, with no\nregard for dates; and further, how the same story is often repeated,\nsometimes in a different version, he will easily, I say, discern that all\nthe materials were promiscuously collected and heaped together, in order\nthat they might at some subsequent time be more readily examined and reduced\nto order. (22) Not only these five books, but also the narratives contained\nin the remaining seven, going down to the destruction of the city, are\ncompiled in the same way. (23) For who does not see that in Judges ii:6 a\nnew historian is being quoted, who had also written of the deeds of Joshua,\nand that his words are simply copied? (24) For after our historian has\nstated in the last chapter of the book of Joshua that Joshua died and was\nburied, and has promised, in the first chapter of Judges, to relate what\nhappened after his death, in what way, if he wished to continue the thread\nof his history, could he connect the statement here made about Joshua with\nwhat had gone before?\n(25) So, too, 1 Sam. 17, 18, are taken from another historian, who assigns a\ncause for David's first frequenting Saul's court very different from that\ngiven in chap. xvi. of the same book. (26) For he did not think that David\ncame to Saul in consequence of the advice of Saul's servants, as is\nnarrated in chap. xvi., but that being sent by chance to the camp by his\nfather on a message to his brothers, he was for the first time remarked by\nSaul on the occasion of his victory, over Goliath the Philistine, and was\nretained at his court.\n(27) I suspect the same thing has taken place in chap. xxvi. of the same\nbook, for the historian there seems to repeat the narrative given in chap.\nxxiv. according to another man's version. (28) But I pass over this, and go\non to the computation of dates.\n(29) In I Kings, chap. vi., it is said that Solomon built the Temple in the\nfour hundred and eightieth year after the exodus from Egypt; but from the\nhistorians themselves we get a much longer period, for:\nYears.\nMoses governed the people in the desert . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . 40\nJoshua, who lived 110 years, did not, according to Josephus and\nothers' opinion rule more than  . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . 26\nCusban Rishathaim held the people in subjection . . . . . . . . . . .  8\nOthniel, son of Kenag, was judge for  . . . . . . . . .

(31) But to\nthese must be added the years during which the Hebrew republic flourished\nafter the death of Joshua, until it was conquered by Cushan Rishathaim,\nwhich I take to be very numerous, for I cannot bring myself to believe that\nimmediately after the death of Joshua all those who had witnessed his\nmiracles died simultaneously, nor that their successors at one stroke bid\nfarewell to their laws, and plunged from the highest virtue into the depth\nof wickedness and obstinacy.\n(32) Nor, lastly, that Cushan Rishathaim subdued them on the instant; each\none of these circumstances requires almost a generation, and there is no\ndoubt that Judges ii:7, 9, 10, comprehends a great many years which it\npasses over in silence. (33) We must also add the years during which Samuel\nwas judge, the number of which is not stated in Scripture, and also the\nyears during which Saul reigned, which are not clearly shown from his\nhistory. (34) It is, indeed, stated in 1 Sam. xiii:1, that he reigned two\nyears, but the text in that passage is mutilated, and the records of his\nreign lead us to suppose a longer period. (35) That the text is mutilated I\nsuppose no one will doubt who has ever advanced so far as the threshold of\nthe Hebrew language, for it runs as follows: \"Saul was in his -- year, when\nhe began to reign, and he reigned two years over Israel.\" (36) Who, I say,\ndoes not see that the number of the years of Saul's age when he began to\nreign has been omitted? (37) That the record of the reign presupposes a\ngreater number of years is equally beyond doubt, for in the same book, chap.\nxxvii:7, it is stated that David sojourned among the Philistines, to whom he\nhad fled on account of Saul, a year and four months; thus the rest of the\nreign must have been comprised in a space of eight months, which I think\nno one will credit. (38) Josephus, at the end of the sixth book of his\nantiquities, thus corrects the text: Saul reigned eighteen years while\nSamuel was alive, and two years after his death. (39) However, all the\nnarrative in chap. xiii. is in complete disagreement with what goes before.\n(40) At the end of chap. vii. it is narrated that the Philistines were so\ncrushed by the Hebrews that they did not venture, during Samuel's life, to\ninvade the borders of Israel; but in chap. xiii. we are told that the\nHebrews were invaded during the life of Samuel by the Philistines, and\nreduced by them to such a state of wretchedness and poverty that they were\ndeprived not only of weapons with which to defend themselves, but also of\nthe means of making more. (41) I should be at pains enough if I were to try\nand harmonize all the narratives contained in this first book of Samuel so\nthat they should seem to be all written and arranged by a single historian.\n(42) But I return to my object. (43) The years, then, during which Saul\nreigned must be added to the above computation; and, lastly, I have not\ncounted the years of the Hebrew anarchy, for I cannot from Scripture gather\ntheir number. (44) I cannot, I say, be certain as to the period occupied by\nthe events related in Judges chap. xvii. on till the end of the book.\n(45) It is thus abundantly evident that we cannot arrive at a true\ncomputation of years from the histories, and, further, that the histories\nare inconsistent themselves on the subject. (46) We are compelled to confess\nthat these histories were compiled from various writers without previous\narrangement and examination. (47) Not less discrepancy is found between the\ndates given in the Chronicles of the Kings of Judah, and those in the\nChronicles of the Kings of Israel; in the latter, it is stated that Jehoram,\nthe son of Ahab, began to reign in the second year of the reign of Jehoram,\nthe son of Jehoshaphat (2 Kings i:17), but in the former we read that\nJehoram, the son of Jehoshaphat, began to reign in the fifth year of\nJehoram, the son of Ahab (2 Kings viii:16). (48) Anyone who compares the\nnarratives in Chronicles with the narratives in the books of Kings, will\nfind many similar discrepancies. (49) These there is no need for me to\nexamine here, and still less am I called upon to treat of the commentaries\nof those who endeavour to harmonize them. (50) The Rabbis evidently let their\nfancy run wild. (51) Such commentators as I have, read, dream, invent, and\nas a last resort, play fast and loose with the language. (52) For instance,\nwhen it is said in 2 Chronicles, that Ahab was forty-two years old when he\nbegan to reign, they pretend that these years are computed from the reign of\nOmri, not from the birth of Ahab. (53) If this can be shown to be the real\nmeaning of the writer of the book of Chronicles, all I can say is, that he\ndid not know how to state a fact. (54) The commentators make many other\nassertions of this kind, which if true, would prove that the ancient Hebrews\nwere ignorant both of their own language, and of the way to relate a plain\nnarrative. (55) I should in such case recognize no rule or reason in\ninterpreting Scripture, but it would be permissible to hypothesize to one's\nheart's content.\n(56) If anyone thinks that I am speaking too generally, and without\nsufficient warrant, I would ask him to set himself to showing us some fixed\nplan in these histories which might be followed without blame by other\nwriters of chronicles, and in his efforts at harmonizing and interpretation,\nso strictly to observe and explain the phrases and expressions, the order\nand the connections, that we may be able to imitate these also in our\nwritings (17). (57) If he succeeds, I will at once give him my hand, and he\nshall be to me as great Apollo; for I confess that after long endeavours I\nhave been unable to discover anything of the kind. (58) I may add that I set\ndown nothing here which I have not long reflected upon, and that, though I\nwas imbued from my boyhood up with the ordinary opinions about the\nScriptures, I have been unable to withstand the force of what I have urged.\n(59) However, there is no need to detain the reader with this question, and\ndrive him to attempt an impossible task; I merely mentioned the fact in\norder to throw light on my intention.\n(60) I now pass on to other points concerning the treatment of these books.\n(61) For we must remark, in addition to what has been shown, that these\nbooks were not guarded by posterity with such care that no faults crept in.\n(62) The ancient scribes draw attention to many doubtful readings, and some\nmutilated passages, but not to all that exist: whether the faults are\nof sufficient importance to greatly embarrass the reader I will not now\ndiscuss. (63) I am inclined to think that they are of minor moment to those,\nat any rate, who read the Scriptures with enlightenment: and I can\npositively, affirm that I have not noticed any fault or various reading in\ndoctrinal passages sufficient to render them obscure or doubtful.\n(64) There are some people, however, who will not admit that there is any\ncorruption, even in other passages, but maintain that by some unique\nexercise of providence God has preserved from corruption every word in the\nBible: they say that the various readings are the symbols of profoundest\nmysteries, and that mighty secrets lie hid in the twenty-eight hiatus which\noccur, nay, even in the very form of the letters.\n(65) Whether they are actuated by folly and anile devotion, or whether by\narrogance and malice so that they alone may be held to possess the secrets\nof God, I know not: this much I do know, that I find in their writings\nnothing which has the air of a Divine secret, but only childish\nlucubrations. (66) I have read and known certain Kabbalistic triflers, whose\ninsanity provokes my unceasing astonishment. (67) That faults have crept\nin will, I think, be denied by no sensible person who reads the passage\nabout Saul, above quoted (1 Sam. xiii:1) and also 2 Sam. vi:2: \"And David\narose and went with all the people that were with him from Judah, to bring\nup from thence the ark of God.\"\n(68) No one can fail to remark that the name of their destination, viz.,\nKirjath-jearim [Endnote 18], has been omitted: nor can we deny that\n2 Sam. xiii:37, has been tampered with and mutilated. \"And Absalom fled, and\nwent to Talmai, the son of Ammihud, king of Geshur. (69) And he mourned for\nhis son every day. So Absalom fled, and went to Geshur, and was there three\nyears.\" (70) I know that I have remarked other passages of the same kind,\nbut I cannot recall them at the moment.\n(71) That the marginal notes which are found continually in the Hebrew\nCodices are doubtful readings will, I think, be evident to everyone who has\nnoticed that they often arise from the great similarity, of some of the\nHebrew letters, such for instance, as the similarity between Kaph and Beth,\nJod and Vau, Daleth and Reth, &c. (72) For example, the text in\n2 Sam. v:24, runs \"in the time when thou hearest,\" and similarly in\nJudges xxi:22, \"And it shall be when their fathers or their brothers come\nunto us often,\" the marginal version is \"come unto us to complain.\"\n(73) So also many various readings have arisen from the use of the letters\nnamed mutes, which are generally not sounded in pronunciation, and are taken\npromiscuously, one for the other. (74) For example, in Levit. xxv:29, it is\nwritten, \"The house shall be established which is not in the walled city,\"\nbut the margin has it, \"which is in a walled city.\"\n(75) Though these matters are self-evident, [Endnore 6], it is necessary, to\nanswer the reasonings of certain Pharisees, by which they endeavour to\nconvince us that the marginal notes serve to indicate some mystery, and were\nadded or pointed out by the writers of the sacred books. (76) The first of\nthese reasons, which, in my opinion, carries little weight, is taken from\nthe practice of reading the Scriptures aloud.\n(77) If, it is urged, these notes were added to show various readings which\ncould not be decided upon by posterity, why has custom prevailed that the\nmarginal readings should always be retained? (78) Why has the meaning which\nis preferred been set down in the margin when it ought to have been\nincorporated in the text, and not relegated to a side note?\n(79) The second reason is more specious, and is taken from the nature of the\ncase. (80) It is admitted that faults have crept into the sacred writings by\nchance and not by design; but they say that in the five books the word for a\ngirl is, with one exception, written without the letter \"he,\" contrary to\nall grammatical rules, whereas in the margin it is written correctly\naccording to the universal rule of grammar. (81) Can this have happened by\nmistake? Is it possible to imagine a clerical error to have been committed\nevery time the word occurs? (82) Moreover, it would have been easy to\nsupply the emendation. (83) Hence, when these readings are not accidental\nor corrections of manifest mistakes, it is supposed that they must have been\nset down on purpose by the original writers, and have a meaning. (84)\nHowever, it is easy to answer such arguments; as to the question of custom\nhaving prevailed in the reading of the marginal versions, I will not spare\nmuch time for its consideration: I know not the promptings of superstition,\nand perhaps the practice may have arisen from the idea that both readings\nwere deemed equally good or tolerable, and therefore, lest either should be\nneglected, one was appointed to be written, and the other to be read. (85)\nThey feared to pronounce judgment in so weighty a matter lest they should\nmistake the false for the true, and therefore they would give preference to\nneither, as they must necessarily have done if they had commanded one only\nto be both read and written. (86) This would be especially the case where\nthe marginal readings were not written down in the sacred books: or the\ncustom may have originated because some things though rightly written down\nwere desired to be read otherwise according to the marginal version, and\ntherefore the general rule was made that the marginal version should be\nfollowed in reading the Scriptures. (87) The cause which induced the scribes\nto expressly prescribe certain passages to be read in the marginal version,\nI will now touch on, for not all the marginal notes are various readings,\nbut some mark expressions which have passed out of common use, obsolete\nwords and terms which current decency did not allow to be read in a public\nassembly. (88) The ancient writers, without any evil intention, employed no\ncourtly paraphrase, but called things by their plain names. (891)\nAfterwards, through the spread of evil thoughts and luxury, words which\ncould be used by the ancients without offence, came to be considered\nobscene. (90) There was no need for this cause to change the text of\nScripture. (91) Still, as a concession to the popular weakness, it became\nthe custom to substitute more decent terms for words denoting sexual\nintercourse, excreta, &c., and to read them as they were given in the\nmargin.\n(92) At any rate, whatever may have been the origin of the practice of\nreading Scripture according to the marginal version, it was not that the\ntrue interpretation is contained therein. (93) For besides that, the\nRabbins in the Talmud often differ from the Massoretes, and give other\nreadings which they approve of, as I will shortly show, certain things are\nfound in the margin which appear less warranted by the uses of the Hebrew\nlanguage. (94) For example, in 2 Samuel xiv:22, we read, \"In that the king\nhath fulfilled the request of his servant,\" a construction plainly\nregular, and agreeing with that in chap. xvi. (95) But the margin has it\n\"of thy servant,\" which does not agree with the person of the verb. (96)\nSo, too, chap. xvi:25 of the same book, we find, \"As if one had inquired at\nthe oracle of God,\" the margin adding \"someone\" to stand as a nominative to\nthe verb. (97) But the correction is not apparently warranted, for it is\na common practice, well known to grammarians in the Hebrew language, to use\nthe third person singular of the active verb impersonally.\n(98) The second argument advanced by the Pharisees is easily answered from\nwhat has just been said, namely, that the scribes besides the various\nreadings called attention to obsolete words. (99) For there is no doubt\nthat in Hebrew as in other languages, changes of use made many words\nobsolete and antiquated, and such were found by the later scribes in the\nsacred books and noted by them with a view to the books being publicly read\naccording to custom. (100) For this reason the word nahgar is always found\nmarked because its gender was originally common, and it had the same meaning\nas the Latin juvenis (a young person). (101) So also the Hebrew capital was\nanciently called Jerusalem, not Jerusalaim. (102) As to the pronouns himself\nand herself, I think that the later scribes changed vau into jod (a very\nfrequent change in Hebrew) when they wished to express the feminine gender,\nbut that the ancients only distinguished the two genders by a change of\nvowels. (103) I may also remark that the irregular tenses of certain verbs\ndiffer in the ancient and modern forms, it being formerly considered a mark\nof elegance to employ certain letters agreeable to the ear.\n(104) In a word, I could easily multiply proofs of this kind if I were not\nafraid of abusing the patience of the reader. (105) Perhaps I shall be asked\nhow I became acquainted with the fact that all these expressions are\nobsolete. (106) I reply that I have found them in the most ancient Hebrew\nwriters in the Bible itself, and that they have not been imitated by\nsubsequent authors, and thus they are recognized as antiquated, though the\nlanguage in which they occur is dead. (107) But perhaps someone may press\nthe question why, if it be true, as I say, that the marginal notes of the\nBible generally mark various readings, there are never more than two\nreadings of a passage, that in the text and that in the margin, instead of\nthree or more; and further, how the scribes can have hesitated between two\nreadings, one of which is evidently contrary to grammar, and the other a\nplain correction.\n(108) The answer to these questions also is easy: I will premise that it is\nalmost certain that there once were more various readings than those now\nrecorded. (119) For instance, one finds many in the Talmud which the\nMassoretes have neglected, and are so different one from the other that\neven the superstitious editor of the Bomberg Bible confesses that he cannot\nharmonize them. (110) \"We cannot say anything,\" he writes, \"except what we\nhave said above, namely, that the Talmud is generally in contradiction to\nthe Massorete.\" (111) So that we are nor bound to hold that there never were\nmore than two readings of any passage, yet I am willing to admit, and\nindeed I believe that more than two readings are never found: and for the\nfollowing reasons:-(112) (I.) The cause of the differences of reading only\nadmits of two, being generally the similarity of certain letters, so that\nthe question resolved itself into which should be written Beth, or Kaf,\nJod or Vau, Daleth or Reth: cases which are constantly occurring, and\nfrequently yielding a fairly good meaning whichever alternative be adopted.\n(113) Sometimes, too, it is a question whether a syllable be long or short,\nquantity being determined by the letters called mutes. (114) Moreover, we\nnever asserted that all the marginal versions, without exception, marked\nvarious readings; on the contrary, we have stated that many were due to\nmotives of decency or a desire to explain obsolete words. (115) (II.) I am\ninclined to attribute the fact that more than two readings are never found\nto the paucity of exemplars, perhaps not more than two or three, found by\nthe scribes. (116) In the treatise of the scribes, chap. vi., mention is\nmade of three only, pretended to have been found in the time of Ezra, in\norder that the marginal versions might be attributed to him.\n(117) However that may be, if the scribes only had three codices we may\neasily imagine that in a given passage two of them would be in accord, for\nit would be extraordinary if each one of the three gave a different reading\nof the same text.\n(118) The dearth of copies after the time of Ezra will surprise no one who\nhas read the 1st chapter of Maccabees, or Josephus's \"Antiquities,\" Bk. 12,\nchap. 5. (119) Nay, it appears wonderful considering the fierce and daily\npersecution, that even these few should have been preserved. (120) This\nwill, I think, be plain to even a cursory reader of the history of those\ntimes.\n(121) We have thus discovered the reasons why there are never more than two\nreadings of a passage in the Bible, but this is a long way from supposing\nthat we may therefore conclude that the Bible was purposely written\nincorrectly in such passages in order to signify some mystery. (122) As to\nthe second argument, that some passages are so faultily written that they\nare at plain variance with all grammar, and should have been corrected in\nthe text and not in the margin, I attach little weight to it, for I am not\nconcerned to say what religious motive the scribes may have had for acting\nas they did: possibly they did so from candour, wishing to transmit the few\nexemplars of the Bible which they had found exactly in their original state,\nmarking the differences they discovered in the margin, not as doubtful\nreadings, but as simple variants. (123) I have myself called them doubtful\nreadings, because it would be generally impossible to say which of the two\nversions is preferable.\n(124) Lastly, besides these doubtful readings the scribes have (by leaving a\nhiatus in the middle of a paragraph) marked several passages as mutilated.\n(125) The Massoretes have counted up such instances, and they amount to\neight-and-twenty. (126) I do not know whether any mystery is thought to lurk\nin the number, at any rate the Pharisees religiously preserve a certain\namount of empty space.\n(127) One of such hiatus occurs (to give an instance) in Gen. iv:8, where it\nis written, \"And Cain said to his brother . . . . and it came to pass while\nthey were in the field, &c.,\" a space being left in which we should expect\nto hear what it was that Cain said.\n(128) Similarly there are (besides those points we have noticed)\neight-and-twenty hiatus left by the scribes. (129) Many of these would not\nbe recognized as mutilated if it were not for the empty space left. But I\nhave said enough on this subject.\nCHAPTER X. - AN EXAMINATION OF THE REMAINING BOOKS OF\nTHE OLD TESTAMENT ACCORDING TO THE PRECEDING METHOD.\n(1) I now pass on to the remaining books of the Old Testament. (2)\nConcerning the two books of Chronicles I have nothing particular or\nimportant to remark, except that they were certainly written after the time\nof Ezra, and possibly after the restoration of the Temple by Judas\nMaccabaeus [Endnote 19]. (2) For in chap. ix. of the first book we find a\nreckoning of the families who were the first to live in Jerusalem, and in\nverse 17 the names of the porters, of which two recur in Nehemiah. (3) This\nshows that the books were certainly compiled after the rebuilding of the\ncity. (4) As to their actual writer, their authority, utility, and doctrine,\nI come to no conclusion. (5) I have always been astonished that they have\nbeen included in the Bible by men who shut out from the canon the books of\nWisdom, Tobit, and the others styled apocryphal. (6) I do not aim at\ndisparaging their authority, but as they are universally received I will\nleave them as they are.\n(7) The Psalms were collected and divided into five books in the time of the\nsecond temple, for Ps. lxxxviii. was published, according to Philo-Judaeus,\nwhile king Jehoiachin was still a prisoner in Babylon; and Ps. lxxxix. when\nthe same king obtained his liberty: I do not think Philo would have made the\nstatement unless either it had been the received opinion in his time, or\nelse had been told him by trustworthy persons.\n(8) The Proverbs of Solomon were, I believe, collected at the same time, or\nat least in the time of King Josiah; for in chap. xxv:1, it is written,\n\"These are also proverbs of Solomon which the men of Hezekiah, king of\nJudah, copied out.\" (9) I cannot here pass over in silence the audacity\nof the Rabbis who wished to exclude from the sacred canon both the Proverbs\nand Ecclesiastes, and to put them both in the Apocrypha. (10) In fact, they\nwould actually have done so, if they had not lighted on certain passages in\nwhich the law of Moses is extolled. (11) It is, indeed, grievous to think\nthat the settling of the sacred canon lay in the hands of such men; however,\nI congratulate them, in this instance, on their suffering us to see these\nbooks in question, though I cannot refrain from doubting whether they have\ntransmitted them in absolute good faith; but I will not now linger on this\npoint.\n(10) I pass on, then, to the prophetic books. (11) An examination of these\nassures me that the prophecies therein contained have been compiled from\nother books, and are not always set down in the exact order in which they\nwere spoken or written by the prophets, but are only such as were collected\nhere and there, so that they are but fragmentary.\n(12) Isaiah began to prophecy in the reign of Uzziah, as the writer himself\ntestifies in the first verse. (13) He not only prophesied at that time, but\nfurthermore wrote the history of that king (see 2 Chron. xxvi:22) in a\nvolume now lost. (13) That which we possess, we have shown to have been\ntaken from the chronicles of the kings of Judah and Israel.\n(14) We may add that the Rabbis assert that this prophet prophesied in the\nreign of Manasseh, by whom he was eventually put to death, and, although\nthis seems to be a myth, it yet shows that they did not think that all\nIsaiah's prophecies are extant.\n(15) The prophecies of Jeremiah, which are related historically are also\ntaken from various chronicles; for not only are they heaped together\nconfusedly, without any account being taken of dates, but also the same\nstory is told in them differently in different passages. (16) For instance,\nin chap. xxi. we are told that the cause of Jeremiah's arrest was that he\nhad prophesied the destruction of the city to Zedekiah who consulted him.\n(17) This narrative suddenly passes, in chap xxii., to the prophet's\nremonstrances to Jehoiakim (Zedekiah's predecessor), and the prediction he\nmade of that king's captivity; then, in chap. xxv., come the revelations\ngranted to the prophet previously, that is in the fourth year of Jehoiakim,\nand, further on still, the revelations received in the first year of the\nsame reign. (18) The continuator of Jeremiah goes on heaping prophecy\nupon prophecy without any regard to dates, until at last, in chap. xxxviii.\n(as if the intervening chapters had been a parenthesis), he takes up the\nthread dropped in chap. xxi.\n(19) In fact, the conjunction with which chap. xxxviii. begins, refers to\nthe 8th, 9th, and 10th verses of chap. xxi. Jeremiah's last arrest is then\nvery differently described, and a totally separate cause is given for his\ndaily retention in the court of the prison.\n(20) We may thus clearly see that these portions of the book have been\ncompiled from various sources, and are only from this point of view\ncomprehensible. (21) The prophecies contained in the remaining chapters,\nwhere Jeremiah speaks in the first person, seem to be taken from a\nbook written by Baruch, at Jeremiah's dictation. (22) These, however, only\ncomprise (as appears from chap. xxxvi:2) the prophecies revealed to the\nprophet from the time of Josiah to the fourth year of Jehoiakim, at which\nperiod the book begins. (23) The contents of chap. xlv:2, on to chap.\nli:59, seem taken from the same volume.\n(24) That the book of Ezekiel is only a fragment, is clearly indicated by\nthe first verse. (25) For anyone may see that the conjunction with which it\nbegins, refers to something already said, and connects what follows\ntherewith. (26) However, not only this conjunction, but the whole text\nof the discourse implies other writings. (27) The fact of the present work\nbeginning the thirtieth year shows that the prophet is continuing, not\ncommencing a discourse; and this is confirmed by the writer, who\nparenthetically states in verse 3, \"The word of the Lord came often unto\nEzekiel the priest, the son of Buzi, in the land of the Chaldeans,\" as if to\nsay that the prophecies which he is about to relate are the sequel to\nrevelations formerly received by Ezekiel from God. (28) Furthermore,\nJosephus, 11 Antiq.\" x:9, says that Ezekiel prophesied that Zedekiah should\nnot see Babylon, whereas the book we now have not only contains no such\nstatement, but contrariwise asserts in chap. xvii. that he should be taken\nto Babylon as a captive, [Endnote 20].\n(29) Of Hosea I cannot positively state that he wrote more than is now\nextant in the book bearing his name, but I am astonished at the smallness of\nthe quantity we possess, for the sacred writer asserts that the prophet\nprophesied for more than eighty years.\n(30) We may assert, speaking generally, that the compiler of the prophetic\nbooks neither collected all the prophets, nor all the writings of those we\nhave; for of the prophets who are said to have prophesied in the reign of\nManasseh and of whom general mention is made in 2 Chron. xxxiii:10, 18, we\nhave, evidently, no prophecies extant; neither have we all the prophecies of\nthe twelve who give their names to books. (31) Of Jonah we have only the\nprophecy concerning the Ninevites, though he also prophesied to the children\nof Israel, as we learn in 2 Kings xiv:25.\n(32) The book and the personality of Job have caused much controversy. (33)\nSome think that the book is the work of Moses, and the whole narrative\nmerely allegorical. (34) Such is the opinion of the Rabbins recorded in the\nTalmud, and they are supported by, Maimonides in his \"More Nebuchim.\" (35)\nOthers believe it to be a true history, and some suppose that Job lived in\nthe time of Jacob, and was married to his daughter Dinah. (36) Aben Ezra,\nhowever, as I have already stated, affirms, in his commentaries, that the\nwork is a translation into Hebrew from some other language: I could wish\nthat he could advance more cogent arguments than he does, for we might then\nconclude that the Gentiles also had sacred books. (37) I myself leave the\nmatter undecided, but I conjecture Job to have been a Gentile, and a man of\nvery stable character, who at first prospered, then was assailed with\nterrible calamities, and finally, was restored to great happiness. (38) (He\nis thus named, among others, by Ezekiel, xiv:12.) (39) I take it that the\nconstancy of his mind amid the vicissitudes of his fortune occasioned many\nmen to dispute about God's providence, or at least caused the writer of the\nbook in question to compose his dialogues; for the contents, and also the\nstyle, seem to emanate far less from a man wretchedly ill and lying among\nashes, than from one reflecting at ease in his study. (40) I should also be\ninclined to agree with Aben Ezra that the book is a translation, for its\npoetry seems akin to that of the Gentiles; thus the Father of Gods summons a\ncouncil, and Momus, here called Satan, criticizes the Divine decrees with\nthe utmost freedom. (41) But these are mere conjectures without any solid\nfoundation.\n(42) I pass on to the book of Daniel, which, from chap. viii. onwards,\nundoubtedly contains the writing of Daniel himself. (43) Whence the first\nseven chapters are derived I cannot say; we may, however, conjecture that,\nas they were first written in Chaldean, they are taken from Chaldean\nchronicles. (44) If this could be proved, it would form a very striking\nproof of the fact that the sacredness of Scripture depends on our\nunderstanding of the doctrines therein signified, and not on the words, the\nlanguage, and the phrases in which these doctrines are conveyed to us;\nand it would further show us that books which teach and speak of whatever is\nhighest and best are equally sacred, whatever be the tongue in which they\nare written, or the nation to which they belong.\n(45) We can, however, in this case only remark that the chapters in question\nwere written in Chaldee, and yet are as sacred as the rest of the Bible.\n(46) The first book of Ezra is so intimately connected with the book of\nDaniel that both are plainly recognizable as the work of the same author,\nwriting of Jewish history from the time of the first captivity onwards. (47)\nI have no hesitation in joining to this the book of Esther, for the\nconjunction with which it begins can refer to nothing else. (48) It cannot\nbe the same work as that written by Mordecai, for, in chap. ix:20-22,\nanother person relates that Mordecai wrote letters, and tells us their\ncontents; further, that Queen Esther confirmed the days of Purim in their\ntimes appointed, and that the decree was written in the book that is (by a\nHebraism), in a book known to all then living, which, as Aben Ezra and the\nrest confess, has now perished. (49) Lastly, for the rest of the acts of\nMordecai, the historian refers us to the chronicles of the kings of\nPersia. (50) Thus there is no doubt that this book was written by the same\nperson as he who recounted the history of Daniel and Ezra, and who wrote\nNehemiah, [Endnote 21], sometimes called the second book of Ezra. (51) We\nmay, then, affirm that all these books are from one hand; but we have no\nclue whatever to the personality of the author. (52) However, in order to\ndetermine whence he, whoever he was, had gained a knowledge of the histories\nwhich he had, perchance, in great measure himself written, we may remark\nthat the governors or chiefs of the Jews, after the restoration of the\nTemple, kept scribes or historiographers, who wrote annals or chronicles of\nthem. (53) The chronicles of the kings are often quoted in the books of\nKings, but the chronicles of the chiefs and priests are quoted for the first\ntime in Nehemiah xii:23, and again in 1 Macc. xvi:24. (54) This is\nundoubtedly the book referred to as containing the decree of Esther and the\nacts of Mordecai; and which, as we said with Aben Ezra, is now lost. (55)\nFrom it were taken the whole contents of these four books, for no other\nauthority is quoted by their writer, or is known to us.\n(56) That these books were not written by either Ezra or Nehemiah is plain\nfrom Nehemiah xii:9, where the descendants of the high priest, Joshua are\ntraced down to Jaddua, the sixth high priest, who went to meet Alexander the\nGreat, when the Persian empire was almost subdued (Josephus, \"Ant.\" ii.\n108), or who, according to Philo-Judaeus, was the sixth and last high priest\nunder the Persians. (57) In the same chapter of Nehemiah, verse 22, this\npoint is clearly brought out: \"The Levites in the days of Eliashib, Joiada,\nand Johanan, and Jaddua, were recorded chief of the fathers: also the\npriests, to the reign of Darius the Persian\" - that is to say, in the\nchronicles; and, I suppose, no one thinks [Endnote 22]  that the lives of\nNehemiah and Ezra were so prolonged that they outlived fourteen kings of\nPersia. (58) Cyrus was the first who granted the Jews permission to rebuild\ntheir Temple: the period between his time and Darius, fourteenth and last\nking of Persia, extends over 230 years. (59) I have, therefore, no doubt\nthat these books were written after Judas Maccabaeus had restored the\nworship in the Temple, for at that time false books of Daniel, Ezra, and\nEsther were published by evil-disposed persons, who were almost certainly\nSadducees, for the writings were never recognized by the Pharisees, so far\nas I am aware; and, although certain myths in the fourth book of Ezra are\nrepeated in the Talmud, they must not be set down to the Pharisees, for all\nbut the most ignorant admit that they have been added by some trifler: in\nfact, I think, someone must have made such additions with a view to casting\nridicule on all the traditions of the sect.\n(60) Perhaps these four books were written out and published at the time I\nhave mentioned with a view to showing the people that the prophecies of\nDaniel had been fulfilled, and thus kindling their piety, and awakening a\nhope of future deliverance in the midst of their misfortunes. (61) In\nspite of their recent origin, the books before us contain many errors, due,\nI suppose, to the haste with which they were written. (62) Marginal\nreadings, such as I have mentioned in the last chapter, are found here as\nelsewhere, and in even greater abundance; there are, moreover, certain\npassages which can only be accounted for by supposing some such cause as\nhurry.\n(63) However, before calling attention to the marginal readings, I will\nremark that, if the Pharisees are right in supposing them to have been\nancient, and the work of the original scribes, we must perforce admit that\nthese scribes (if there were more than one) set them down because they\nfound that the text from which they were copying was inaccurate, and did yet\nnot venture to alter what was written by their predecessors and superiors.\n(64) I need not again go into the subject at length, and will, therefore,\nproceed to mention some discrepancies not noticed in the margin.\n(65) I. Some error has crept into the text of the second chapter of Ezra,\nfor in verse 64 we are told that the total of all those mentioned in the\nrest of the chapter amounts to 42,360; but, when we come to add up the\nseveral items we get as result only 29,818. (66) There must, therefore, be\nan error, either in the total, or in the details. (67) The total is probably\ncorrect, for it would most likely be well known to all as a noteworthy\nthing; but with the details, the case would be different. (68) If, then, any\nerror had crept into the total, it would at once have been remarked, and\neasily corrected. (69) This view is confirmed by Nehemiah vii., where this\nchapter of Ezra is mentioned, and a total is given in plain correspondence\nthereto; but the details are altogether different - some are larger, and\nsome less, than those in Ezra, and altogether they amount to 31,089.\n(70) We may, therefore, conclude that both in Ezra and in Nehemiah the\ndetails are erroneously given. (71) The commentators who attempt to\nharmonize these evident contradictions draw on their imagination, each to\nthe best of his ability; and while professing adoration for each letter and\nword of Scripture, only succeed in holding up the sacred writers to\nridicule, as though they knew not how to write or relate a plain narrative.\n(72) Such persons effect nothing but to render the clearness of Scripture\nobscure. (73) If the Bible could everywhere be interpreted after their\nfashion, there would be no such thing as a rational statement of which\nthe meaning could be relied on. (74) However, there is no need to dwell on\nthe subject; only I am convinced that if any historian were to attempt to\nimitate the proceedings freely attributed to the writers of the Bible, the\ncommentators would cover him with contempt. (75) If it be blasphemy to\nassert that there are any errors in Scripture, what name shall we apply to\nthose who foist into it their own fancies, who degrade the sacred writers\ntill they seem to write confused nonsense, and who deny the plainest and\nmost evident meanings? (76) What in the whole Bible can be plainer than the\nfact that Ezra and his companions, in the second chapter of the book\nattributed to him, have given in detail the reckoning of all the Hebrews who\nset out with them for Jerusalem? (77) This is proved by the reckoning being\ngiven, not only of those who told their lineage, but also of those who were\nunable to do so. (78) Is it not equally clear from Nehemiah vii:5, that the\nwriter merely there copies the list given in Ezra? (79) Those, therefore,\nwho explain these passages otherwise, deny the plain meaning of Scripture -\nnay, they deny Scripture itself. (80) They think it pious to reconcile one\npassage of Scripture with another - a pretty piety, forsooth, which\naccommodates the clear passages to the obscure, the correct to the faulty,\nthe sound to the corrupt.\n(81) Far be it from me to call such commentators blasphemers, if their\nmotives be pure: for to err is human. But I return to my subject.\n(82) Besides these errors in numerical details, there are others in the\ngenealogies, in the history, and, I fear also in the prophecies. (83) The\nprophecy of Jeremiah (chap. xxii.), concerning Jechoniah, evidently does not\nagree with his history, as given in I Chronicles iii:17-19, and especially\nwith the last words of the chapter, nor do I see how the prophecy, \"thou\nshalt die in peace,\" can be applied to Zedekiah, whose eyes were dug out\nafter his sons had been slain before him. (84) If prophecies are to be\ninterpreted by their issue, we must make a change of name, and read\nJechoniah for Zedekiah, and vice versa (85) This, however, would be too\nparadoxical a proceeding; so I prefer to leave the matter unexplained,\nespecially as the error, if error there be, must be set down to the\nhistorian, and not to any fault in the authorities.\n(86) Other difficulties I will not touch upon, as I should only weary the\nreader, and, moreover, be repeating the remarks of other writers. (87) For\nR. Selomo, in face of the manifest contradiction in the above-mentioned\ngenealogies, is compelled to break forth into these words (see his\ncommentary on 1 Chron. viii.): \"Ezra (whom he supposes to be the author of\nthe book of Chronicles) gives different names and a different genealogy to\nthe sons of Benjamin from those which we find in Genesis, and describes most\nof the Levites differently from Joshua, because he found original\ndiscrepancies.\" (88) And, again, a little later: \"The genealogy of Gibeon\nand others is described twice in different ways, from different tables of\neach genealogy, and in writing them down Ezra adopted the version given in\nthe majority of the texts, and when the authority was equal he gave both.\"\n(89) Thus granting that these books were compiled from sources originally\nincorrect and uncertain.\n(90) In fact the commentators, in seeking to harmonize difficulties,\ngenerally do no more than indicate their causes: for I suppose no sane\nperson supposes that the sacred historians deliberately wrote with the\nobject of appearing to contradict themselves freely. (91) Perhaps I\nshall be told that I am overthrowing the authority of Scripture, for that,\naccording to me, anyone may suspect it of error in any passage; but, on the\ncontrary, I have shown that my object has been to prevent the clear and\nuncorrupted passages being accommodated to and corrupted by the faulty ones;\nneither does the fact that some passages are corrupt warrant us in\nsuspecting all. (92) No book ever was completely free from faults, yet I\nwould ask, who suspects all books to be everywhere faulty? (93) Surely no\none, especially when the phraseology is clear and the intention of the\nauthor plain.\n(94) I have now finished the task I set myself with respect to the books of\nthe Old Testament. (95) We may easily conclude from what has been said, that\nbefore the time of the Maccabees there was no canon of sacred books,\n[Endnote 23], but that those which we now possess were selected from a\nmultitude of others at the period of the restoration of the Temple by the\nPharisees (who also instituted the set form of prayers), who are alone\nresponsible for their acceptance. (96) Those, therefore, who would\ndemonstrate the authority of Holy Scripture, are bound to show the authority\nof each separate book; it is not enough to prove the Divine origin of a\nsingle book in order to infer the Divine origin of the rest. (97) In that\ncase we should have to assume that the council of Pharisees was, in its\nchoice of books, infallible, and this could never be proved. (98) I am led\nto assert that the Pharisees alone selected the books of the Old Testament,\nand inserted them in the canon, from the fact that in Daniel xii. is\nproclaimed the doctrine of the Resurrection, which the Sadducees denied;\nand, furthermore, the Pharisees plainly assert in the Talmud that they so\nselected them. (99) For in the treatise of Sabbathus, chapter ii., folio 30,\npage 2, it is written: R. Jehuda, surnamed Rabbi, reports that the experts\nwished to conceal the book of Ecclesiastes because they found therein words\nopposed to the law (that is, to the book of the law of Moses). (100) Why did\nthey not hide it? (101) \"Because it begins in accordance with the law, and\nends according to the law;\" and a little further on we read: \"They sought\nalso to conceal the book of Proverbs.\" (102) And in the first chapter of the\nsame treatise, fol. 13, page 2: \"Verily, name one man for good, even he who\nwas called Neghunja, the son of Hezekiah: for, save for him, the book of\nEzekiel would been concealed, because it agreed not with the words of the\nlaw.\"\n(103) It is thus abundantly clear that men expert in the law summoned a\ncouncil to decide which books should be received into the canon, and which\nexcluded. (104) If any man, therefore, wishes to be certified as to the\nauthority of all the books, let him call a fresh council, and ask every\nmember his reasons.\n(105) The time has now come for examining in the same manner the books in\nthe New Testament; but as I learn that the task has been already performed\nby men highly skilled in science and languages, and as I do not myself\npossess a knowledge of Greek sufficiently exact for the task; lastly, as we\nhave lost the originals of those books which were written in Hebrew, I\nprefer to decline the undertaking. (106) However, I will touch on those\npoints which have most bearing on my subject in the following chapter.\nEnd of Part 2.\nAUTHOR'S ENDNOTES TO THE THEOLOGICO-POLITICAL TREATISE\nPart 2 - Chapters VI to X\nCHAPTER VI.\nEndnote 6. (1) We doubt of the existence of God, and consequently of\nall else, so long as we have no clear and distinct idea of God, but only a\nconfused one. (2) For as he who knows not rightly the nature of a triangle,\nknows not that its three angles are equal to two right angles, so he who\nconceives the Divine nature confusedly, does not see that it pertains to the\nnature of God to exist. (3) Now, to conceive the nature of God clearly and\ndistinctly, it is necessary to pay attention to a certain number of very\nsimple notions, called general notions, and by their help to associate the\nconceptions which we form of the attributes of the Divine nature. (4) It\nthen, for the first time, becomes clear to us, that God exists necessarily,\nthat He is omnipresent, and that all our conceptions involve in themselves\nthe nature of God and are conceived through it. (5) Lastly, we see that all\nour adequate ideas are true. (6) Compare on this point the prolegomena to\nbook, \"Principles of Descartes's philosophy set forth geometrically.\"\nCHAPTER VII.\nEndnote 7. (1) \"It is impossible to find a method which would enable us to\ngain a certain knowledge of all the statements in Scripture.\" (2) I mean\nimpossible for us who have not the habitual use of the language, and have\nlost the precise meaning of its phraseology.\nEndnote 8. (1) \"Not in things whereof the understanding can gain a clear and\ndistinct idea, and which are conceivable through themselves.\" (2) By things\nconceivable I mean not only those which are rigidly proved, but also those\nwhereof we are morally certain, and are wont to hear without wonder, though\nthey are incapable of proof. (3) Everyone can see the truth of Euclid's\npropositions before they are proved. (4) So also the histories of things\nboth future and past which do not surpass human credence, laws,\ninstitutions, manners, I call conceivable and clear, though they cannot be\nproved mathematically. (5) But hieroglyphics and histories which seem to\npass the bounds of belief I call inconceivable; yet even among these last\nthere are many which our method enables us to investigate, and to discover\nthe meaning of their narrator.\nCHAPTER VIII.\nEndnote 9. (1) \"Mount Moriah is called the mount of God.\" (2) That is by the\nhistorian, not by Abraham, for he says that the place now called \"In the\nmount of the Lord it shall be revealed,\" was called by Abraham, \"the Lord\nshall provide.\"\nEndnote 10. (1) \"Before that territory [Idumoea] was conquered by David.\"\n(2) From this time to the reign of Jehoram when they again separated from\nthe Jewish kingdom (2 Kings viii:20), the Idumaeans had no king, princes\nappointed by the Jews supplied the place of kings (1 Kings xxii:48), in fact\nthe prince of Idumaea is called a king (2 Kings iii:9).\n(3) It may be doubted whether the last of the Idumaean kings had begun to\nreign before the accession of Saul, or whether Scripture in this chapter of\nGenesis wished to enumerate only such kings as were independent. (4) It is\nevidently mere trifling to wish to enrol among Hebrew kings the name of\nMoses, who set up a dominion entirely different from a monarchy.\nCHAPTER IX.\nEndnote 11. (1) \"With few exceptions.\" (2) One of these exceptions is found\nin 2 Kings xviii:20, where we read, \"Thou sayest (but they are but vain\nwords),\" the second person being used. (3) In Isaiah xxxvi:5, we read \"I\nsay (but they are but vain words) I have counsel and strength for war,\" and\nin the twenty-second verse of the chapter in Kings it is written, \"But if ye\nsay,\" the plural number being used, whereas Isaiah gives the singular. (4)\nThe text in Isaiah does not contain the words found in 2 Kings xxxii:32. (5)\nThus there are several cases of various readings where it is impossible to\ndistinguish the best.\nEndnote 12. (1) \"The expressions in the two passages are so varied.\" (2) For\ninstance we read in 2 Sam. vii:6, \"But I have walked in a tent and in a\ntabernacle.\" (3) Whereas in 1 Chron. xvii:5, \"but have gone from tent to\ntent and from one tabernacle to another.\" (4) In 2 Sam. vii:10, we read, \"to\nafflict them,\" whereas in 1 Chron. vii:9, we find a different expression. (5)\nI could point out other differences still greater, but a single reading of\nthe chapters in question will suffice to make them manifest to all who are\nneither blind nor devoid of sense.\nEndnote 13. (1) \"This time cannot refer to what immediately precedes.\" (2)\nIt is plain from the context that this passage must allude to the time when\nJoseph was sold by his brethren. (3) But this is not all. (4) We may draw\nthe same conclusion from the age of Judah, who was than twenty-two years old\nat most, taking as basis of calculation his own history just narrated. (5)\nIt follows, indeed, from the last verse of Gen. xxx., that Judah was born in\nthe tenth of the years of Jacob's servitude to Laban, and Joseph in the\nfourteenth. (6) Now, as we know that Joseph was seventeen years old when\nsold by his brethren, Judah was then not more than twenty-one. (7) Hence,\nthose writers who assert that Judah's long absence from his father's\nhouse took place before Joseph was sold, only seek to delude themselves and\nto call in question the Scriptural authority which they are anxious to\nprotect.\nEndnote 14. (1) \"Dinah was scarcely seven years old when she was violated by\nSchechem.\" (2) The opinion held by some that Jacob wandered about eight or\nten years between Mesopotamia and Bethel, savours of the ridiculous; if\nrespect for Aben Ezra, allows me to say so. (3) For it is clear that Jacob\nhad two reasons for haste: first, the desire to see his old parents;\nsecondly, and chiefly to perform, the vow made when he fled from his brother\n(Gen. xxviii:10 and xxxi:13, and xxxv:1). (4) We read (Gen. xxxi:3), that\nGod had commanded him to fulfill his vow, and promised him help for\nreturning to his country. (5) If these considerations seem conjectures\nrather than reasons, I will waive the point and admit that Jacob, more\nunfortunate than Ulysses, spent eight or ten years or even longer, in this\nshort journey. (6) At any rate it cannot be denied that Benjamin was born in\nthe last year of this wandering, that is by the reckoning of the objectors,\nwhen Joseph was sixteen or seventeen years old, for Jacob left Laban seven\nyears after Joseph's birth. (7) Now from the seventeenth year of Joseph's\nage till the patriarch went into Egypt, not more than twenty-two years\nelapsed, as we have shown in this chapter. (8) Consequently Benjamin, at the\ntime of the journey to Egypt, was twenty-three or twenty- four at the most.\n(9) He would therefore have been a grandfather in the flower of his age\n(Gen. xlvi:21, cf. Numb. xxvi:38, 40, and 1 Chron. viii:1), for it is\ncertain that Bela, Benjamin's eldest son, had at that time, two sons, Addai\nand Naa-man. (10) This is just as absurd as the statement that Dinah was\nviolated at the age of seven, not to mention other impossibilities\nwhich would result from the truth of the narrative. (11) Thus we see that\nunskillful endeavours to solve difficulties, only raise fresh ones, and make\nconfusion worse confounded.\nEndnote 15. (1) \"Othniel, son of Kenag, was judge for forty years.\" (2)\nRabbi Levi Ben Gerson and others believe that these forty years which the\nBible says were passed in freedom, should be counted from the death of\nJoshua, and consequently include the eight years during which the people\nwere subject to Kushan Rishathaim, while the following eighteen years\nmust be added on to the eighty years of Ehud's and Shamgar's judgeships. (3)\nIn this case it would be necessary to reckon the other years of subjection\namong those said by the Bible to have been passed in freedom. (4) But the\nBible expressly notes the number of years of subjection, and the number of\nyears of freedom, and further declares (Judges ii:18) that the\nHebrew state was prosperous during the whole time of the judges. (5)\nTherefore it is evident that Levi Ben Gerson (certainly a very learned man),\nand those who follow him, correct rather than interpret the Scriptures.\n(6) The same fault is committed by those who assert, that Scripture, by this\ngeneral calculation of years, only intended to mark the period of the\nregular administration of the Hebrew state, leaving out the years of anarchy\nand subjection as periods of misfortune and interregnum. (7) Scripture\ncertainly passes over in silence periods of anarchy, but does not, as they\ndream, refuse to reckon them or wipe them out of the country's annals. (8)\nIt is clear that Ezra, in 1 Kings vi., wished to reckon absolutely all the\nyears since the flight from Egypt. (9) This is so plain, that no one versed\nin the Scriptures can doubt it. (10) For, without going back to the\nprecise words of the text, we may see that the genealogy of David given at\nthe end of the book of Ruth, and I Chron. ii., scarcely accounts for so\ngreat a number of years. (11) For Nahshon, who was prince of the tribe of\nJudah (Numb. vii:11), two years after the Exodus, died in the desert, and\nhis son Salmon passed the Jordan with Joshua. (12) Now this Salmon,\naccording to the genealogy, was David's great-grandfather. (13) Deducting,\nthen, from the total of 480 years, four years for Solomon's reign, seventy\nfor David's life, and forty for the time passed in the desert, we find that\nDavid was born 366 years after the passage of the Jordan. (14) Hence we\nmust believe that David's father, grandfather, great-grandfather, and\ngreat-great-grandfather begat children when they were ninety years old.\nEndnote 16. (1) \"Samson was judge for twenty years.\" (2) Samson was born\nafter the Hebrews had fallen under the dominion of the Philistines.\nEndnote 17. (1) Otherwise, they rather correct than explain Scripture.\nEndnote 18. (1) \"Kirjath-jearim.\" Kirjath-jearim is also called Baale of\nJudah. (2) Hence Kimchi and others think that the words Baale Judah, which I\nhave translated \"the people of Judah,\" are the name of a town. (3) But this\nis not so, for the word Baale is in the plural. (4) Moreover, comparing this\ntext in Samuel with I Chron. Xiii:5, we find that David did not rise up\nand go forth out of Baale, but that he went thither. (5) If the author of\nthe book of Samuel had meant to name the place whence David took the ark, he\nwould, if he spoke Hebrew correctly, have said, \"David rose up, and set\nforth from Baale Judah, and took the ark from thence.\"\nCHAPTER X.\nEndnote 19. (1) \"After the restoration of the Temple by Judas Maccaboeus.\"\n(2) This conjecture, if such it be, is founded on the genealogy of King\nJeconiah, given in 1 Chron. iii., which finishes at the sons of Elioenai,\nthe thirteenth in direct descent from him: whereon we must observe that\nJeconiah, before his captivity, had no children; but it is probable that he\nhad two while he was in prison, if we may draw any inference from the names\nhe gave them. (3) As to his grandchildren, it is evident that they were born\nafter his deliverance, if the names be any guide, for his grandson, Pedaiah\n(a name meaning God hath delivered me), who, according to this chapter, was\nthe father of Zerubbabel, was born in the thirty-seventh or thirty-eighth\nyear of Jeconiah's life, that is thirty-three years before the restoration\nof liberty to the Jews by Cyrus. (4) Therefore Zerubbabel, to whom Cyrus\ngave the principality of Judaea, was thirteen or fourteen years old. (5) But\nwe need not carry the inquiry so far: we need only read attentively\nthe chapter of 1 Chron., already quoted, where (v. 17, sqq.) mention is made\nof all the posterity of Jeconiah, and compare it with the Septuagint version\nto see clearly that these books were not published, till after Maccabaeus\nhad restored the Temple, the sceptre no longer belonging to the house of\nJeconiah.\nEndnote 20. (1) \"Zedekiah should be taken to Babylon.\" (2) No one could then\nhave suspected that the prophecy of Ezekiel contradicted that of Jeremiah,\nbut the suspicion occurs to everyone who reads the narrative of Josephus.\n(3) The event proved that both prophets were in the right.\nEndnote 21. (1) \"And who wrote Nehemiah.\" (2) That the greater part of the\nbook of Nehemiah was taken from the work composed by the prophet Nehemiah\nhimself, follows from the testimony of its author. (See chap. i.). (3) But\nit is obvious that the whole of the passage contained between chap. viii.\nand chap. xii. verse 26, together with the two last verses of chap. xii.,\nwhich form a sort of parenthesis to Nehemiah's words, were added by the\nhistorian himself, who outlived Nehemiah.\nEndnote 22. (1) \"I suppose no one thinks\" that Ezra was the uncle of the\nfirst high priest, named Joshua (see Ezra vii., and 1 Chron. vi:14), and\nwent to Jerusalem from Babylon with Zerubbabel (see Nehemiah xii:1). (2) But\nit appears that when he saw, that the Jews were in a state of anarchy, he\nreturned to Babylon, as also did others (Nehem. i:2), and remained there\ntill the reign of Artaxerxes, when his requests were granted and he went a\nsecond time to Jerusalem. (3) Nehemiah also went to Jerusalem with Zerubbabel\nin the time of Cyrus (Ezra ii:2 and 63, cf. x:9, and Nehemiah x:1). (4) The\nversion given of the Hebrew word, translated \"ambassador,\" is not supported\nby any authority, while it is certain that fresh names were given to those\nJews who frequented the court. (5) Thus Daniel was named Balteshazzar,\nand Zerubbabel Sheshbazzar (Dan. i:7). (6) Nehemiah was called Atirsata,\nwhile in virtue of his office he was styled governor, or president.\n(Nehem. v. 24, xii:26.)\nEndnote 23. (1) \"Before the time of the Maccabees there was no canon of\nsacred books.\" (2) The synagogue styled \"the great\" did not begin before the\nsubjugation of Asia by the Macedonians. (3) The contention of Maimonides,\nRabbi Abraham, Ben-David, and others, that the presidents of this synagogue\nwere Ezra, Daniel, Nehemiah, Haggai, Zechariah, &c., is a pure fiction,\nresting only on rabbinical tradition. (4) Indeed they assert that the\ndominion of the Persians only lasted thirty-four years, and this is their\nchief reason for maintaining that the decrees of the \"great synagogue,\" or\nsynod (rejected by the Sadducees, but accepted by the Pharisees) were\nratified by the prophets, who received them from former prophets, and so in\ndirect succession from Moses, who received them from God Himself. (5) Such\nis the doctrine which the Pharisees maintain with their wonted obstinacy.\n(6) Enlightened persons, however, who know the reasons for the convoking of\ncouncils, or synods, and are no strangers to the differences between\nPharisees and Sadducees, can easily divine the causes which led to the\nassembling of this great synagogue. (7) It is very certain that no prophet\nwas there present, and that the decrees of the Pharisees, which they style\ntheir traditions, derive all their authority from it.\nEnd of Endnotes to Part II. - Chapters VI to X.\nSentence Numbers, shown thus (1), have been added by volunteer.\nA Theologico-Political Treatise\nPart III - Chapters XI to XV\nby Baruch Spinoza\nTABLE OF CONTENTS:\nCHAPTER XI - An Inquiry whether the Apostles wrote their\nEpistles as Apostles and Prophets, or merely as Teachers,\nand an Explanation of what is meant by Apostle.\nThe epistles not in the prophetic style.\nThe Apostles not commanded to write or preach in particular places.\nDifferent methods of teaching adopted by the Apostles.\nCHAPTER XII - Of the true Original of the Divine Law,\nand wherefore Scripture is called Sacred, and the Word of God.\nHow that, in so far as it contains the Word of God,\nit has come down to us uncorrupted.\nCHAPTER XIII - It is shown, that Scripture teaches only very Simple Doctrines,\nsuch as suffice for right conduct.\nError in speculative doctrine not impious - nor knowledge pious.\nPiety consists in obedience.\nCHAPTER XIV - Definitions of Faith, the True Faith, and the Foundations\nof Faith, which is once for all separated from Philosophy.\nDanger resulting from the vulgar idea of faith.\nThe only test of faith obedience and good works.\nAs different men are disposed to obedience by different opinions,\nuniversal faith can contain only the simplest doctrines.\nFundamental distinction between faith and philosophy -\nthe key-stone of the present treatise.\nCHAPTER XV - Theology is shown not to be subservient to\nReason, nor Reason to Theology: a Definition of the reason\nwhich enables us to accept the Authority of the Bible.\nTheory that Scripture must be accommodated to Reason -\nmaintained by Maimonides - already refuted in Chapter vii.\nTheory that Reason must be accommodated to Scripture -\nmaintained by Alpakhar - examined.\nAnd refuted.\nScripture and Reason independent of one another.\nCertainty, of fundamental faith not mathematical but moral.\nGreat utility of Revelation.\nAuthor's Endnotes to the Treatise.\nCHAPTER XI - AN INQUIRY WHETHER THE APOSTLES WROTE THEIR\nEPISTLES AS APOSTLES AND PROPHETS, OR MERELY AS TEACHERS;\nAND AN EXPLANATION OF WHAT IS MEANT BY AN APOSTLE.\n(1) No reader of the New Testament can doubt that the Apostles were\nprophets; but as a prophet does not always speak by revelation, but only at\nrare intervals, as we showed at the end of Chap. I., we may fairly inquire\nwhether the Apostles wrote their Epistles as prophets, by revelation and\nexpress mandate, as Moses, Jeremiah, and others did, or whether only as\nprivate individuals or teachers, especially as Paul, in Corinthians xiv:6,\nmentions two sorts of preaching.\n(2) If we examine the style of the Epistles, we shall find it totally\ndifferent from that employed by the prophets.\n(3) The prophets are continually asserting that they speak by the command of\nGod: \"Thus saith the Lord,\" \"The Lord of hosts saith,\" \"The command of the\nLord,\" &c.; and this was their habit not only in assemblies of the prophets,\nbut also in their epistles containing revelations, as appears from the epistle\nof Elijah to Jehoram, 2 Chron. xxi:12, which begins, \"Thus saith the Lord.\"\n(4) In the Apostolic Epistles we find nothing of the sort. (5) Contrariwise,\nin I Cor. vii:40 Paul speaks according to his own opinion and in many\npassages we come across doubtful and perplexed phrase; such as, \"We think,\ntherefore,\" Rom. iii:28; \"Now I think,\" [Endnote 24],  Rom. viii:18, and so\non. (6) Besides these, other expressions are met with very different from\nthose used by the prophets. (7) For instance, 1 Cor. vii:6, \"But I speak\nthis by permission, not by commandment;\" \"I give my judgment as one that\nhath obtained mercy of the Lord to be faithful\" (1 Cor. vii:25), and so on\nin many other passages. (8) We must also remark that in the aforesaid\nchapter the Apostle says that when he states that he has or has\nnot the precept or commandment of God, he does not mean the precept or\ncommandment of God revealed to himself, but only the words uttered by Christ\nin His Sermon on the Mount. (9) Furthermore, if we examine the manner in\nwhich the Apostles give out evangelical doctrine, we shall see that it\ndiffers materially from the method adopted by the prophets. (10) The\nApostles everywhere reason as if they were arguing rather than prophesying;\nthe prophecies, on the other hand, contain only dogmas and commands. (11)\nGod is therein introduced not as speaking to reason, but as issuing decrees\nby His absolute fiat. (12) The authority of the prophets does not submit to\ndiscussion, for whosoever wishes to find rational ground for his arguments,\nby that very wish submits them to everyone's private judgment. (13) This\nPaul, inasmuch as he uses reason, appears to have done, for he says in 1\nCor. x:15, \"I speak as to wise men, judge ye what I say.\" (14) The prophets,\nas we showed at the end of Chapter I., did not perceive what was revealed by\nvirtue of their natural reason, and though there are certain passages in the\nPentateuch which seem to be appeals to induction, they turn out, on nearer\nexamination, to be nothing but peremptory commands. (15) For instance, when\nMoses says, Deut. xxxi:27, \"Behold, while I am yet alive with you, this day\nye have been rebellious against the Lord; and how much more after\nmy death,\" we must by no means conclude that Moses wished to convince the\nIsraelites by reason that they would necessarily fall away from the worship\nof the Lord after his death; for the argument would have been false, as\nScripture itself shows: the Israelites continued faithful during the lives\nof Joshua and the elders, and afterwards during the time of Samuel, David,\nand Solomon. (16) Therefore the words of Moses are merely a moral\ninjunction, in which he predicts rhetorically the future backsliding of the\npeople so as to impress it vividly on their imagination. (17) I say that\nMoses spoke of himself in order to lend likelihood to his prediction, and\nnot as a prophet by revelation, because in verse 21 of the same chapter we\nare told that God revealed the same thing to Moses in different words, and\nthere was no need to make Moses certain by argument of God's prediction and\ndecree; it was only necessary that it should be vividly impressed on\nhis imagination, and this could not be better accomplished than by\nimagining the existing contumacy of the people, of which he had had frequent\nexperience, as likely to extend into the future.\n(18) All the arguments employed by Moses in the five books are to be\nunderstood in a similar manner; they are not drawn from the armoury of\nreason, but are merely modes of expression calculated to instil with\nefficacy, and present vividly to the imagination the commands of God.\n(19) However, I do not wish absolutely to deny that the prophets ever argued\nfrom revelation; I only maintain that the prophets made more legitimate use\nof argument in proportion as their knowledge approached more nearly to\nordinary knowledge, and by this we know that they possessed a knowledge\nabove the ordinary, inasmuch as they proclaimed absolute dogmas,\ndecrees, or judgments. (20) Thus Moses, the chief of the prophets, never\nused legitimate argument, and, on the other hand, the long deductions and\narguments of Paul, such as we find in the Epistle to the Romans, are in\nnowise written from supernatural revelation.\n(21) The modes of expression and discourse adopted by the Apostles in the\nEpistles, show very clearly that the latter were not written by revelation\nand Divine command, but merely by the natural powers and judgment of the\nauthors. (22) They consist in brotherly admonitions and courteous\nexpressions such as would never be employed in prophecy, as for instance,\nPaul's excuse in Romans xv:15, \"I have written the more boldly unto you in\nsome sort, my brethren.\"\n(23) We may arrive at the same conclusion from observing that we never read\nthat the Apostles were commanded to write, but only that they went\neverywhere preaching, and confirmed their words with signs. (24) Their\npersonal presence and signs were absolutely necessary for the conversion and\nestablishment in religion of the Gentiles; as Paul himself expressly states\nin Rom. i:11, \"But I long to see you, that I may impart to you some\nspiritual gift, to the end that ye may be established.\"\n(25) It may be objected that we might prove in similar fashion that the\nApostles did not preach as prophets, for they did not go to particular\nplaces, as the prophets did, by the command of God. (26) We read in\nthe Old Testament that Jonah went to Nineveh to preach, and at the\nsame time that he was expressly sent there, and told that he most preach.\n(27) So also it is related, at great length, of Moses that he went to Egypt\nas the messenger of God, and was told at the same time what he should say to\nthe children of Israel and to king Pharaoh, and what wonders he should work\nbefore them to give credit to his words. (28) Isaiah, Jeremiah, and\nEzekiel were expressly commanded to preach to the Israelites. Lastly, the\nprophets only preached what we are assured by Scripture they had received\nfrom God, whereas this is hardly ever said of the Apostles in the New\nTestament, when they went about to preach. (29) On the contrary, we find\npassages expressly implying that the Apostles chose the places where they\nshould preach on their own responsibility, for there was a difference\namounting to a quarrel between Paul and Barnabas on the subject (Acts xv:37,\n38). (30) Often they wished to go to a place, but were prevented, as Paul\nwrites, Rom. i:13, \"Oftentimes I purposed to come to you, but was let\nhitherto;\" and in I Cor. xvi:12, \"As touching our brother Apollos, I greatly\ndesired him to come unto you with the brethren, but his will was not at all\nto come at this time: but he will come when he shall have convenient time.\"\n(31) From these expressions and differences of opinion among the Apostles,\nand also from the fact that Scripture nowhere testifies of them, as of the\nancient prophets, that they went by the command of God, one might conclude\nthat they preached as well as wrote in their capacity of teachers, and not\nas prophets: but the question is easily solved if we observe the difference\nbetween the mission of an Apostle and that of an Old Testament prophet. (32)\nThe latter were not called to preach and prophesy to all nations, but to\ncertain specified ones, and therefore an express and peculiar mandate was\nrequired for each of them; the Apostles, on the other hand, were called to\npreach to all men absolutely, and to turn all men to religion. (33)\nTherefore, whithersoever they went, they were fulfilling Christ's\ncommandment; there was no need to reveal to them beforehand what they should\npreach, for they were the disciples of Christ to whom their Master Himself\nsaid (Matt. X:19, 20): \"But, when they deliver you up, take no thought\nhow or what ye shall speak, for it shall be given you in that same\nhour what ye shall speak.\" (34) We therefore conclude that the Apostles\nwere only indebted to special revelation in what they orally preached and\nconfirmed by signs (see the beginning of Chap. 11.); that which they taught\nin speaking or writing without any confirmatory signs and wonders\nthey taught from their natural knowledge. (See I Cor. xiv:6.) (35) We need\nnot be deterred by the fact that all the Epistles begin by citing the\nimprimatur of the Apostleship, for the Apostles, as I will shortly show,\nwere granted, not only the faculty of prophecy, but also the authority to\nteach. (36) We may therefore admit that they wrote their Epistles as\nApostles, and for this cause every one of them began by citing the Apostolic\nimprimatur, possibly with a view to the attention of the reader by asserting\nthat they were the persons who had made such mark among the faithful by\ntheir preaching, and had shown by many marvelous works that they were\nteaching true religion and the way of salvation. (37) I observe that what is\nsaid in the Epistles with regard to the Apostolic vocation and the Holy\nSpirit of God which inspired them, has reference to their former preaching,\nexcept in those passages where the expressions of the Spirit of God and the\nHoly Spirit are used to signify a mind pure, upright, and devoted to\nGod. (38) For instance, in 1 Cor. vii:40, Paul says: But she is happier if\nshe so abide, after my judgment, and I think also that I have the Spirit of\nGod.\" (39) By the Spirit of God the Apostle here refers to his mind, as\nwe may see from the context: his meaning is as follows: \"I account blessed\na widow who does not wish to marry a second husband; such is my opinion, for\nI have settled to live unmarried, and I think that I am blessed.\" (40) There\nare other similar passages which I need not now quote.\n(41) As we have seen that the Apostles wrote their Epistles solely by the\nlight of natural reason, we must inquire how they were enabled to teach by\nnatural knowledge matters outside its scope. (42) However, if we bear in\nmind what we said in Chap. VII. of this treatise our difficulty will vanish:\nfor although the contents of the Bible entirely surpass our understanding,\nwe may safely discourse of them, provided we assume nothing not told\nus in Scripture: by the same method the Apostles, from what they saw\nand heard, and from what was revealed to them, were enabled to form and\nelicit many conclusions which they would have been able to teach to men had\nit been permissible.\n(43) Further, although religion, as preached by the Apostles, does not come\nwithin the sphere of reason, in so far as it consists in the narration of\nthe life of Christ, yet its essence, which is chiefly moral, like the whole\nof Christ's doctrine, can readily be apprehended by the natural\nfaculties of all.\n(44) Lastly, the Apostles had no lack of supernatural illumination for the\npurpose of adapting the religion they had attested by signs to the\nunderstanding of everyone so that it might be readily received; nor for\nexhortations on the subject: in fact, the object of the Epistles is to teach\nand exhort men to lead that manner of life which each of the Apostles judged\nbest for confirming them in religion. (45) We may here repeat our former\nremark, that the Apostles had received not only the faculty of preaching the\nhistory, of Christ as prophets, and confirming it with signs, but also\nauthority for teaching and exhorting according as each thought best. (46)\nPaul (2 Tim. i:11), \"Whereunto I am appointed a preacher, and an apostle,\nand a teacher of the Gentiles;\" and again (I Tim. ii:7), \"Whereunto I am\nordained a preacher and an apostle (I speak the truth in Christ and lie\nnot), a teacher of the Gentiles in faith and verity.\" (47) These passages, I\nsay, show clearly the stamp both of the apostleship and the teachership:\nthe authority for admonishing whomsoever and wheresoever he pleased is\nasserted by Paul in the Epistle to Philemon, v:8: \"Wherefore, though I might\nbe much bold in Christ to enjoin thee that which is convenient, yet,\" &c.,\nwhere we may remark that if Paul had received from God as a prophet\nwhat he wished to enjoin Philemon, and had been bound to speak in his\nprophetic capacity, he would not have been able to change the command of God\ninto entreaties. (48) We must therefore understand him to refer to the\npermission to admonish which he had received as a teacher, and not as a\nprophet. (49) We have not yet made it quite clear that the Apostles might\neach choose his own way of teaching, but only that by virtue of their\nApostleship they were teachers as well as prophets; however, if we\ncall reason to our aid we shall clearly see that an authority to teach\nimplies authority to choose the method. (50) It will nevertheless be,\nperhaps, more satisfactory to draw all our proofs from Scripture; we are\nthere plainly told that each Apostle chose his particular method (Rom. xv:\n20): \"Yea, so have I strived to preach the gospel, not where Christ was\nnamed, lest I should build upon another man's foundation.\" (51) If\nall the Apostles had adopted the same method of teaching, and had all built\nup the Christian religion on the same foundation, Paul would have had no\nreason to call the work of a fellow-Apostle \"another man's foundation,\"\ninasmuch as it would have been identical with his own: his calling it\nanother man's proved that each Apostle built up his religious instruction on\ndifferent foundations, thus resembling other teachers who have each their\nown method, and prefer instructing quite ignorant people who have never\nlearnt under another master, whether the subject be science, languages, or\neven the indisputable truths of mathematics. (52) Furthermore, if we go\nthrough the Epistles at all attentively, we shall see that the Apostles,\nwhile agreeing about religion itself, are at variance as to the foundations\nit rests on. (53) Paul, in order to strengthen men's religion, and show them\nthat salvation depends solely on the grace of God, teaches that no one can\nboast of works, but only of faith, and that no one can be justified by works\n(Rom. iii:27,28); in fact, he preaches the complete doctrine of\npredestination. (54) James, on the other hand, states that man is justified\nby works, and not by faith only (see his Epistle, ii:24), and omitting all\nthe disputations of Paul, confines religion to a very few elements.\n(55) Lastly, it is indisputable that from these different grounds for\nreligion selected by the Apostles, many quarrels and schisms distracted the\nChurch, even in the earliest times, and doubtless they will continue so to\ndistract it for ever, or at least till religion is separated from\nphilosophical speculations, and reduced to the few simple doctrines taught\nby Christ to His disciples; such a task was impossible for the Apostles,\nbecause the Gospel was then unknown to mankind, and lest its novelty should\noffend men's ears it had to be adapted to the disposition of\ncontemporaries (2 Cor. ix:19, 20), and built up on the groundwork most\nfamiliar and accepted at the time. (56) Thus none of the Apostles\nphilosophized more than did Paul, who was called to preach to the Gentiles;\nother Apostles preaching to the Jews, who despised philosophy, similarly,\nadapted themselves to the temper of their hearers (see Gal. ii. 11), and\npreached a religion free from all philosophical speculations. (57) How blest\nwould our age be if it could witness a religion freed also from all the\ntrammels of superstition!\nCHAPTER XII - OF THE TRUE ORIGINAL OF THE DIVINE LAW, AND\nWHEREFORE SCRIPTURE IS CALLED SACRED, AND THE WORD OF GOD.\nHOW THAT, IN SO FAR AS IT CONTAINS THE WORD OF GOD,\nIT HAS COME DOWN TO US UNCORRUPTED.\n(1) Those who look upon the Bible as a message sent down by God from Heaven\nto men, will doubtless cry out that I have committed the sin against the\nHoly Ghost because I have asserted that the Word of God is faulty,\nmutilated, tampered with, and inconsistent; that we possess it only in\nfragments, and that the original of the covenant which God made with the\nJews has been lost. (2) However, I have no doubt that a little reflection\nwill cause them to desist from their uproar: for not only reason but the\nexpressed opinions of prophets and apostles openly proclaim that God's\neternal Word and covenant, no less than true religion, is Divinely inscribed\nin human hearts, that is, in the human mind, and that this is the true\noriginal of God's covenant, stamped with His own seal, namely, the idea of\nHimself, as it were, with the image of His Godhood.\n(3) Religion was imparted to the early Hebrews as a law written down,\nbecause they were at that time in the condition of children, but afterwards\nMoses (Deut. xxx:6) and Jeremiah (xxxi:33) predicted a time coming when the\nLord should write His law in their hearts. (4) Thus only the Jews, and\namongst them chiefly the Sadducees, struggled for the law written on\ntablets; least of all need those who bear it inscribed on their hearts join\nin the contest. (5) Those, therefore, who reflect, will find nothing in what\nI have written repugnant either to the Word of God or to true religion and\nfaith, or calculated to weaken either one or the other: contrariwise, they\nwill see that I have strengthened religion, as I showed at the end of\nChapter X.; indeed, had it not been so, I should certainly have decided to\nhold my peace, nay, I would even have asserted as a way out of all\ndifficulties that the Bible contains the most profound hidden\nmysteries; however, as this doctrine has given rise to gross superstition\nand other pernicious results spoken of at the beginning of Chapter V., I\nhave thought such a course unnecessary, especially as religion stands in no\nneed of superstitious adornments, but is, on the contrary, deprived by such\ntrappings of some of her splendour.\n(6) Still, it will be said, though the law of God is written in the heart,\nthe Bible is none the less the Word of God, and it is no more lawful to say\nof Scripture than of God's Word that it is mutilated and corrupted. (7) I\nfear that such objectors are too anxious to be pious, and that they are in\ndanger of turning religion into superstition, and worshipping paper and ink\nin place of God's Word.\n(8) I am certified of thus much: I have said nothing unworthy of Scripture\nor God's Word, and I have made no assertions which I could not prove by most\nplain argument to be true. (9) I can, therefore, rest assured that I have\nadvanced nothing which is impious or even savours of impiety.\n(10) I confess that some profane men, to whom religion is a burden, may, from\nwhat I have said, assume a licence to sin, and without any reason, at the\nsimple dictates of their lusts conclude that Scripture is everywhere faulty and\nfalsified, and that therefore its authority is null; but such men are beyond\nthe reach of help, for nothing, as the proverb has it, can be said so rightly\nthat it cannot be twisted into wrong. (11) Those who wish to give rein to their\nlusts are at no loss for an excuse, nor were those men of old who possessed the\noriginal Scriptures, the ark of the covenant, nay, the prophets and apostles in\nperson among them, any better than the people of to-day. (12) Human nature, Jew\nas well as Gentile, has always been the same, and in every age virtue has been\nexceedingly rare.\n(13) Nevertheless, to remove every scruple, I will here show in what sense\nthe Bible or any inanimate thing should be called sacred and Divine;\nalso wherein the law of God consists, and how it cannot be contained in a\ncertain number of books; and, lastly, I will show that Scripture, in so far\nas it teaches what is necessary for obedience and salvation, cannot have\nbeen corrupted. (14) From these considerations everyone will be able to\njudge that I have neither said anything against the Word of God nor given\nany foothold to impiety.\n(15) A thing is called sacred and Divine when it is designed for promoting\npiety, and continues sacred so long as it is religiously used: if the users\ncease to be pious, the thing ceases to be sacred: if it be turned to base\nuses, that which was formerly sacred becomes unclean and profane. (16) For\ninstance, a certain spot was named by the patriarch Jacob the house of God,\nbecause he worshipped God there revealed to him: by the prophets the same\nspot was called the house of iniquity (see Amos v:5, and Hosea x:5), because\nthe Israelites were wont, at the instigation of Jeroboam, to sacrifice there\nto idols. (17) Another example puts the matter in the plainest light. (18)\nWords gain their meaning solely from their usage, and if they are arranged\naccording to their accepted signification so as to move those who read them\nto devotion, they will become sacred, and the book so written will be sacred\nalso. (19) But if their usage afterwards dies out so that the words have no\nmeaning, or the book becomes utterly neglected, whether from unworthy\nmotives, or because it is no longer needed, then the words and the book will\nlose both their use and their sanctity: lastly, if these same words be\notherwise arranged, or if their customary meaning becomes perverted into its\nopposite, then both the words and the book containing them become, instead\nof sacred, impure and profane.\n(20) From this it follows that nothing is in itself absolutely sacred, or\nprofane, and unclean, apart from the mind, but only relatively thereto. (21)\nThus much is clear from many passages in the Bible. (22) Jeremiah (to select\none case out of many) says (chap. vii:4), that the Jews of his time\nwere wrong in calling Solomon's Temple, the Temple of God, for, as he goes\non to say in the same chapter, God's name would only be given to the Temple\nso long as it was frequented by men who worshipped Him, and defended\njustice, but that, if it became the resort of murderers, thieves, idolaters,\nand other wicked persons, it would be turned into a den of malefactors.\n(23) Scripture, curiously enough, nowhere tells us what became of the Ark of\nthe Covenant, though there is no doubt that it was destroyed, or burnt\ntogether with the Temple; yet there was nothing which the Hebrews considered\nmore sacred, or held in greater reverence. (24) Thus Scripture is sacred,\nand its words Divine so long as it stirs mankind to devotion towards God:\nbut if it be utterly neglected, as it formerly was by the Jews, it becomes\nnothing but paper and ink, and is left to be desecrated or corrupted: still,\nthough Scripture be thus corrupted or destroyed, we must not say that the\nWord of God has suffered in like manner, else we shall be like the Jews, who\nsaid that the Temple which would then be the Temple of God had perished in\nthe flames. (25) Jeremiah tells us this in respect to the law, for he thus\nchides the ungodly of his time, \"Wherefore, say you we are masters, and the\nlaw of the Lord is with us? (26) Surely it has been given in vain, it is in\nvain that the pen of the scribes\" (has been made) - that is, you say\nfalsely that the Scripture is in your power, and that you possess the law of\nGod; for ye have made it of none effect.\n(27) So also, when Moses broke the first tables of the law, he did not by\nany means cast the Word of God from his hands in anger and shatter it - such\nan action would be inconceivable, either of Moses or of God's Word - he only\nbroke the tables of stone, which, though they had before been holy from\ncontaining the covenant wherewith the Jews had bound themselves in\nobedience to God, had entirely lost their sanctity when the covenant had\nbeen violated by the worship of the calf, and were, therefore, as liable to\nperish as the ark of the covenant. (28) It is thus scarcely to be wondered\nat, that the original documents of Moses are no longer extant, nor that the\nbooks we possess met with the fate we have described, when we consider that\nthe true original of the Divine covenant, the most sacred object of all, has\ntotally perished.\n(29) Let them cease, therefore, who accuse us of impiety, inasmuch as we\nhave said nothing against the Word of God, neither have we corrupted it, but\nlet them keep their anger, if they would wreak it justly, for the ancients\nwhose malice desecrated the Ark, the Temple, and the Law of God, and all\nthat was held sacred, subjecting them to corruption. (30) Furthermore,\nif, according to the saying of the Apostle in 2 Cor. iii:3, they possessed\n\"the Epistle of Christ, written not with ink, but with the Spirit of the\nliving God, not in tables of stone, but in the fleshy tables of the heart,\"\nlet them cease to worship the letter, and be so anxious concerning it.\n(31) I think I have now sufficiently shown in what respect Scripture should\nbe accounted sacred and Divine; we may now see what should rightly be\nunderstood by the expression, the Word of the Lord; debar (the Hebrew\noriginal) signifies word, speech, command, and thing. (32) The causes for\nwhich a thing is in Hebrew said to be of God, or is referred to Him, have\nbeen already detailed in Chap. I., and we can therefrom easily gather what\nmeaning Scripture attaches to the phrases, the word, the speech, the\ncommand, or the thing of God. (33) I need not, therefore, repeat what I\nthere said, nor what was shown under the third head in the chapter on\nmiracles. (34) It is enough to mention the repetition for the better\nunderstanding of what I am about to say - viz., that the Word of the Lord\nwhen it has reference to anyone but God Himself, signifies that Divine law\ntreated of in Chap. IV.; in other words, religion, universal and catholic\nto the whole human race, as Isaiah describes it (chap. i:10), teaching that\nthe true way of life consists, not in ceremonies, but in charity, and a true\nheart, and calling it indifferently God's Law and God's Word.\n(35) The expression is also used metaphorically for the order of nature and\ndestiny (which, indeed, actually depend and follow from the eternal mandate\nof the Divine nature), and especially for such parts of such order as were\nforeseen by the prophets, for the prophets did not perceive future events as\nthe result of natural causes, but as the fiats and decrees of God. (36)\nLastly, it is employed for the command of any prophet, in so far as he had\nperceived it by his peculiar faculty or prophetic gift, and not by the\nnatural light of reason; this use springs chiefly from the usual prophetic\nconception of God as a legislator, which we remarked in Chap. IV.\n(37) There are, then, three causes for the Bible's being called\nthe Word of God: because it teaches true religion, of which God is the\neternal Founder; because it narrates predictions of future events as\nthough they were decrees of God; because its actual authors generally\nperceived things not by their ordinary natural faculties, but by a\npower peculiar to themselves, and introduced these things perceived,\nas told them by God.\n(37) Although Scripture contains much that is merely historical and can be\nperceived by natural reason, yet its name is acquired from its chief subject\nmatter.\n(38) We can thus easily see how God can be said to be the Author of the\nBible: it is because of the true religion therein contained, and not because\nHe wished to communicate to men a certain number of books. (39) We can also\nlearn from hence the reason for the division into Old and New Testament.\n(40) It was made because the prophets who preached religion before Christ,\npreached it as a national law in virtue of the covenant entered into under\nMoses; while the Apostles who came after Christ, preached it to all men as a\nuniversal religion solely in virtue of Christ's Passion: the cause for the\ndivision is not that the two parts are different in doctrine, nor that they\nwere written as originals of the covenant, nor, lastly, that the catholic\nreligion (which is in entire harmony with our nature) was new except in\nrelation to those who had not known it: \"it was in the world,\" as John the\nEvangelist says, \"and the world knew it not.\"\n(41) Thus, even if we had fewer books of the Old and New Testament than we\nhave, we should still not be deprived of the Word of God (which, as we have\nsaid, is identical with true religion), even as we do not now hold ourselves\nto be deprived of it, though we lack many cardinal writings such as the Book\nof the Law, which was religiously guarded in the Temple as the original of\nthe Covenant, also the Book of Wars, the Book of Chronicles, and many\nothers, from whence the extant Old Testament was taken and compiled. (42)\nThe above conclusion may be supported by many reasons.\n(43) I. Because the books of both Testaments were not written by express\ncommand at one place for all ages, but are a fortuitous collection of the\nworks of men, writing each as his period and disposition dictated. (44) So\nmuch is clearly shown by the call of the prophets who were bade to\nadmonish the ungodly of their time, and also by the Apostolic Epistles.\n(45) II. Because it is one thing to understand the meaning of Scripture\nand the prophets, and quite another thing to understand the meaning\nof God, or the actual truth. (46) This follows from what we said in\nChap. II. (47) We showed, in Chap. VI., that it applied to historic\nnarratives, and to miracles: but it by no means applies to questions\nconcerning true religion and virtue.\n(48) III. Because the books of the Old Testament were selected from many,\nand were collected and sanctioned by a council of the Pharisees, as we\nshowed in Chap. X. (49) The books of the New Testament were also chosen from\nmany by councils which rejected as spurious other books held sacred by many.\n(50) But these councils, both Pharisee and Christian, were not composed of\nprophets, but only of learned men and teachers. (51) Still, we must grant\nthat they were guided in their choice by a regard for the Word of God; and\nthey must, therefore, have known what the law of God was.\n(52) IV. Because the Apostles wrote not as prophets, but as teachers (see\nlast Chapter), and chose whatever method they thought best adapted for those\nwhom they addressed: and consequently, there are many things in the Epistles\n(as we showed at the end of the last Chapter) which are not necessary to\nsalvation.\n(53) V. Lastly, because there are four Evangelists in the New Testament, and\nit is scarcely credible that God can have designed to narrate the life of\nChrist four times over, and to communicate it thus to mankind. (54) For\nthough there are some details related in one Gospel which are not in\nanother, and one often helps us to understand another, we cannot thence\nconclude that all that is set down is of vital importance to us, and that\nGod chose the four Evangelists in order that the life of Christ might be\nbetter understood; for each one preached his Gospel in a separate\nlocality, each wrote it down as he preached it, in simple language, in\norder that the history of Christ might be clearly told, not with any view of\nexplaining his fellow-Evangelists.\n(55) If there are some passages which can be better, and more easily\nunderstood by comparing the various versions, they are the result of chance,\nand are not numerous: their continuance in obscurity would have impaired\nneither the clearness of the narrative nor the blessedness of mankind.\n(56) We have now shown that Scripture can only be called the Word\nof God in so far as it affects religion, or the Divine law; we must now\npoint out that, in respect to these questions, it is neither faulty,\ntampered with, nor corrupt. (57) By faulty, tampered with, and corrupt, I\nhere mean written so incorrectly, that the meaning cannot be arrived at by a\nstudy of the language, nor from the authority of Scripture. (58) I will not\ngo to such lengths as to say that the Bible, in so far as it contains the\nDivine law, has always preserved the same vowel-points, the same letters, or\nthe same words (I leave this to be proved by the Massoretes and other\nworshippers of the letter), I only, maintain that the meaning by which\nalone an utterance is entitled to be called Divine, has come down to us\nuncorrupted, even though the original wording may have been more often\nchanged than we suppose. (59) Such alterations, as I have said above,\ndetract nothing from the Divinity of the Bible, for the Bible would have\nbeen no less Divine had it been written in different words or a different\nlanguage. (60) That the Divine law has in this sense come down to us\nuncorrupted, is an assertion which admits of no dispute. (61) For from the\nBible itself we learn, without the smallest difficulty or ambiguity, that\nits cardinal precept is: To love God above all things, and one's neighbour\nas one's self. (62) This cannot be a spurious passage, nor due to a hasty\nand mistaken scribe, for if the Bible had ever put forth a different\ndoctrine it would have had to change the whole of its teaching, for this is\nthe corner-stone of religion, without which the whole fabric would fall\nheadlong to the ground. (63) The Bible would not be the work we have been\nexamining, but something quite different.\n(64) We remain, then, unshaken in our belief that this has always been the\ndoctrine of Scripture, and, consequently, that no error sufficient to\nvitiate it can have crept in without being instantly, observed by all; nor\ncan anyone have succeeded in tampering with it and escaped the discovery of\nhis malice.\n(65) As this corner-stone is intact, we must perforce admit the same of\nwhatever other passages are indisputably dependent on it, and are also\nfundamental, as, for instance, that a God exists, that He foresees all\nthings, that He is Almighty, that by His decree the good prosper and the\nwicked come to naught, and, finally, that our salvation depends solely on\nHis grace.\n(66) These are doctrines which Scripture plainly teaches throughout, and\nwhich it is bound to teach, else all the rest would be empty and baseless;\nnor can we be less positive about other moral doctrines, which plainly are\nbuilt upon this universal foundation - for instance, to uphold justice, to\naid the weak, to do no murder, to covet no man's goods, &c. (67) Precepts, I\nrepeat, such as these, human malice and the lapse of ages are alike\npowerless to destroy, for if any part of them perished, its loss would\nimmediately be supplied from the fundamental principle, especially the\ndoctrine of charity, which is everywhere in both Testaments extolled above\nall others. (68) Moreover, though it be true that there is no conceivable\ncrime so heinous that it has never been committed, still there is no one who\nwould attempt in excuse for his crimes to destroy the law, or introduce an\nimpious doctrine in the place of what is eternal and salutary; men's nature\nis so constituted that everyone (be he king or subject) who has committed a\nbase action, tries to deck out his conduct with spurious excuses, till he\nseems to have done nothing but what is just and right.\n(69) We may conclude, therefore, that the whole Divine law, as taught by\nScripture, has come down to us uncorrupted. (70) Besides this there are\ncertain facts which we may be sure have been transmitted in good faith. (71)\nFor instance, the main facts of Hebrew history, which were perfectly well\nknown to everyone. (72) The Jewish people were accustomed in former times to\nchant the ancient history of their nation in psalms. (73) The main facts,\nalso, of Christ's life and passion were immediately spread abroad through\nthe whole Roman empire. (74) It is therefore scarcely credible, unless\nnearly everybody consented thereto, which we cannot suppose, that\nsuccessive generations have handed down the broad outline of the Gospel\nnarrative otherwise than as they received it.\n(74) Whatsoever, therefore, is spurious or faulty can only have reference to\ndetails - some circumstances in one or the other history or prophecy\ndesigned to stir the people to greater devotion; or in some miracle, with a\nview of confounding philosophers; or, lastly, in speculative matters\nafter they had become mixed up with religion, so that some individual\nmight prop up his own inventions with a pretext of Divine authority.\n(75) But such matters have little to do with salvation, whether\nthey be corrupted little or much, as I will show in detail in the next\nchapter, though I think the question sufficiently plain from what I have\nsaid already, especially in Chapter II.\nCHAPTER XIII - IT IS SHOWN THAT SCRIPTURE TEACHES ONLY VERY SIMPLE\nDOCTRINES, SUCH AS SUFFICE FOR RIGHT CONDUCT.\n(1) In the second chapter of this treatise we pointed out that the prophets\nwere gifted with extraordinary powers of imagination, but not of\nunderstanding; also that God only revealed to them such things as are very\nsimple - not philosophic mysteries, - and that He adapted His\ncommunications to their previous opinions. (2) We further showed in Chap. V.\nthat Scripture only transmits and teaches truths which can readily be\ncomprehended by all; not deducing and concatenating its conclusions from\ndefinitions and axioms, but narrating quite simply, and confirming its\nstatements, with a view to inspiring belief, by an appeal to experience as\nexemplified in miracles and history, and setting forth its truths in the\nstyle and phraseology which would most appeal to the popular mind (cf. Chap.\nVI., third division).\n(3) Lastly, we demonstrated in Chap. VIII. that the difficulty of\nunderstanding Scripture lies in the language only, and not in the\nabstruseness of the argument.\n(4) To these considerations we may add that the Prophets did not preach only\nto the learned, but to all Jews, without exception, while the Apostles were\nwont to teach the gospel doctrine in churches where there were public\nmeetings; whence it follows that Scriptural doctrine contains no lofty\nspeculations nor philosophic reasoning, but only very simple matters, such\nas could be understood by the slowest intelligence.\n(5) I am consequently lost in wonder at the ingenuity of those whom I have\nalready mentioned, who detect in the Bible mysteries so profound that they\ncannot be explained in human language, and who have introduced so many\nphilosophic speculations into religion that the Church seems like\nan academy, and religion like a science, or rather a dispute.\n(6) It is not to be wondered at that men, who boast of possessing\nsupernatural intelligence, should be unwilling to yield the palm of\nknowledge to philosophers who have only their ordinary faculties; still I\nshould be surprised if I found them teaching any new speculative\ndoctrine, which was not a commonplace to those Gentile philosophers whom, in\nspite of all, they stigmatize as blind; for, if one inquires what these\nmysteries lurking in Scripture may be, one is confronted with nothing but\nthe reflections of Plato or Aristotle, or the like, which it would\noften be easier for an ignorant man to dream than for the most accomplished\nscholar to wrest out of the Bible.\n(7) However, I do not wish to affirm absolutely that Scripture contains no\ndoctrines in the sphere of philosophy, for in the last chapter I pointed out\nsome of the kind, as fundamental principles; but I go so far as to say that\nsuch doctrines are very few and very simple. (8) Their precise nature and\ndefinition I will now set forth. (9) The task will be easy, for we know that\nScripture does not aim at imparting scientific knowledge, and, therefore, it\ndemands from men nothing but obedience, and censures obstinacy, but not\nignorance.\n(10) Furthermore, as obedience to God consists solely in love to our\nneighbour - for whosoever loveth his neighbour, as a means of obeying God,\nhath, as St. Paul says (Rom. xiii:8), fulfilled the law, - it follows that\nno knowledge is commended in the Bible save that which is necessary\nfor enabling all men to obey God in the manner stated, and without which\nthey would become rebellious, or without the discipline of obedience.\n(11) Other speculative questions, which have no direct bearing on this\nobject, or are concerned with the knowledge of natural events, do not affect\nScripture, and should be entirely separated from religion.\n(12) Now, though everyone, as we have said, is now quite able to see this\ntruth for himself, I should nevertheless wish, considering that the whole of\nReligion depends thereon, to explain the entire question more accurately and\nclearly. (13) To this end I must first prove that the intellectual\nor accurate knowledge of God is not a gift, bestowed upon all good men\nlike obedience; and, further, that the knowledge of God, required by Him\nthrough His prophets from everyone without exception, as needful to be\nknown, is simply a knowledge of His Divine justice and charity. (14) Both\nthese points are easily proved from Scripture. (15) The first plainly\nfollows from Exodus vi:2, where God, in order to show the singular grace\nbestowed upon Moses, says to him: \"And I appeared unto Abraham, unto Isaac,\nand unto Jacob by the name of El Sadai (A. V. God Almighty); but by my name\nJehovah was I not known to them\" - for the better understanding of which\npassage I may remark that El Sadai, in Hebrew, signifies the God who\nsuffices, in that He gives to every man that which suffices for him; and,\nalthough Sadai is often used by itself, to signify God, we cannot doubt that\nthe word El (God, {power, might}) is everywhere understood. (16)\nFurthermore, we must note that Jehovah is the only word found in Scripture\nwith the meaning of the absolute essence of God, without reference to\ncreated things. (17) The Jews maintain, for this reason, that this is,\nstrictly speaking, the only name of God; that the rest of the words used are\nmerely titles; and, in truth, the other names of God, whether they be\nsubstantives or adjectives, are merely attributive, and belong to Him, in\nso far as He is conceived of in relation to created things, or manifested\nthrough them. (18) Thus El, or Eloah, signifies powerful, as is well known,\nand only applies to God in respect to His supremacy, as when we call Paul an\napostle; the faculties of his power are set forth in an accompanying\nadjective, as El, great, awful, just, merciful, &c., or else all are\nunderstood at once by the use of El in the plural number, with a singular\nsignification, an expression frequently adopted in Scripture.\n(19) Now, as God tells Moses that He was not known to the patriarchs by the\nname of Jehovah, it follows that they were not cognizant of any attribute of\nGod which expresses His absolute essence, but only of His deeds and promises\nthat is, of His power, as manifested in visible things. (20) God does not\nthus speak to Moses in order to accuse the patriarchs of infidelity, but,\non the contrary, as a means of extolling their belief and faith, inasmuch\nas, though they possessed no extraordinary knowledge of God (such as\nMoses had), they yet accepted His promises as fixed and certain; whereas\nMoses, though his thoughts about God were more exalted, nevertheless doubted\nabout the Divine promises, and complained to God that, instead of the\npromised deliverance, the prospects of the Israelites had darkened.\n(21) As the patriarchs did not know the distinctive name of God, and as God\nmentions the fact to Moses, in praise of their faith and single-heartedness,\nand in contrast to the extraordinary grace granted to Moses, it follows, as\nwe stated at first, that men are not bound by, decree to have knowledge of\nthe attributes of God, such knowledge being only granted to a few of the\nfaithful: it is hardly worth while to quote further examples from Scripture,\nfor everyone must recognize that knowledge of God is not equal among all\ngood men. (22) Moreover, a man cannot be ordered to be wise any more than he\ncan be ordered to live and exist. (23) Men, women, and children are all\nalike able to obey by commandment, but not to be wise. If any tell us that\nit is not necessary to understand the Divine attributes, but that we must\nbelieve them simply, without proof, he is plainly trifling. (24) For what\nis invisible and can only be perceived by the mind, cannot be apprehended\nby any other means than proofs; if these are absent the object remains\nungrasped; the repetition of what has been heard on such subjects no more\nindicates or attains to their meaning than the words of a parrot or a puppet\nspeaking without sense or signification.\n(25) Before I proceed I ought to explain how it comes that we are often told\nin Genesis that the patriarchs preached in the name of Jehovah, this being\nin plain contradiction to the text above quoted. (26) A reference to what\nwas said in Chap. VIII. will readily explain the difficulty. (27) It was\nthere shown that the writer of the Pentateuch did not always speak of things\nand places by the names they bore in the times of which he was writing, but\nby the names best known to his contemporaries. (28) God is thus said in the\nPentateuch to have been preached by the patriarchs under the name of\nJehovah, not because such was the name by which the patriarchs knew\nHim, but because this name was the one most reverenced by the Jews.\n(29) This point, I say, must necessarily be noticed, for in Exodus it is\nexpressly stated that God was not known to the patriarchs by this name; and\nin chap. iii:13, it is said that Moses desired to know the name of God. (30)\nNow, if this name had been already known it would have been known to Moses.\n(31) We must therefore draw the conclusion indicated, namely, that the\nfaithful patriarchs did not know this name of God, and that the knowledge of\nGod is bestowed and not commanded by the Deity.\n(32) It is now time to pass on to our second point, and show that God\nthrough His prophets required from men no other knowledge of Himself than is\ncontained in a knowledge of His justice and charity - that is, of attributes\nwhich a certain manner of life will enable men to imitate. (33) Jeremiah\nstates this in so many words (xxii:15, 16): \"Did not thy father eat, and\ndrink, and do judgment and justice? and then it was well with him. (34) He\njudged the cause of the poor and needy; then it was well with him: was not\nthis to know Me? saith the Lord.\" (35) The words in chap. ix:24 of the same\nbook are equally, clear. (36) \"But let him that glorieth glory in this, that\nhe understandeth and knoweth Me, that I am the Lord which exercise\nloving-kindness, judgment, and righteousness in the earth; for in these\nthings I delight, saith the Lord.\" (37) The same doctrine maybe gathered\nfrom Exod. xxxiv:6, where God revealed to Moses only those of His\nattributes which display the Divine justice and charity. (38) Lastly, we\nmay call attention to a passage in John which we shall discuss at more\nlength hereafter; the Apostle explains the nature of God (inasmuch as no\none has beheld Him) through charity only, and concludes that he who\npossesses charity possesses, and in very truth knows God.\n(39) We have thus seen that Moses, Jeremiah, and John sum up in a very short\ncompass the knowledge of God needful for all, and that they state it to\nconsist in exactly what we said, namely, that God is supremely just, and\nsupremely merciful - in other words, the one perfect pattern of the true\nlife. (40) We may add that Scripture nowhere gives an express definition of\nGod, and does not point out any other of His attributes which should be\napprehended save these, nor does it in set terms praise any others.\n(41) Wherefore we may draw the general conclusion that an intellectual\nknowledge of God, which takes cognizance of His nature in so far as it\nactually is, and which cannot by any manner of living be imitated by mankind\nor followed as an example, has no bearing whatever on true rules of conduct,\non faith, or on revealed religion; consequently that men may be in complete\nerror on the subject without incurring the charge of sinfulness. (42) We\nneed now no longer wonder that God adapted Himself to the existing opinions\nand imaginations of the prophets, or that the faithful held different ideas\nof God, as we showed in Chap. II.; or, again, that the sacred books speak\nvery inaccurately of God, attributing to Him hands, feet, eyes, ears, a\nmind, and motion from one place to another; or that they ascribe to Him\nemotions, such as jealousy, mercy, &c., or, lastly, that they describe\nHim as a Judge in heaven sitting on a royal throne with Christ on His\nright hand. (43) Such expressions are adapted to the understanding of the\nmultitude, it being the object of the Bible to make men not learned but\nobedient.\n(44) In spite of this the general run of theologians, when they come upon\nany of these phrases which they cannot rationally harmonize with the Divine\nnature, maintain that they should be interpreted metaphorically, passages\nthey cannot understand they say should be interpreted literally. (45) But if\nevery expression of this kind in the Bible is necessarily to be interpreted\nand understood metaphorically, Scripture must have been written, not for the\npeople and the unlearned masses, but chiefly for accomplished experts and\nphilosophers.\n(46) If it were indeed a sin to hold piously and simply the ideas about God\nwe have just quoted, the prophets ought to have been strictly on their guard\nagainst the use of such expressions, seeing the weak-mindedness of the\npeople, and ought, on the other hand, to have set forth first of all, duly\nand clearly, those attributes of God which are needful to be understood.\n(47) This they have nowhere done; we cannot, therefore, think that opinions\ntaken in themselves without respect to actions are either pious or impious,\nbut must maintain that a man is pious or impious in his beliefs only in so\nfar as he is thereby incited to obedience, or derives from them license\nto sin and rebel. (48) If a man, by believing what is true, becomes\nrebellious, his creed is impious; if by believing what is false he becomes\nobedient, his creed is pious; for the true knowledge of God comes not by\ncommandment, but by Divine gift. (49) God has required nothing from man but\na knowledge of His Divine justice and charity, and that not as necessary to\nscientific accuracy, but to obedience.\nCHAPTER XIV - DEFINITIONS OF FAITH, THE FAITH, AND THE FOUNDATIONS\nOF FAITH, WHICH IS ONCE FOR ALL SEPARATED FROM PHILOSOPHY.\n(1) For a true knowledge of faith it is above all things necessary to\nunderstand that the Bible was adapted to the intelligence, not only of the\nprophets, but also of the diverse and fickle Jewish multitude. (2) This will\nbe recognized by all who give any thought to the subject, for they will see\nthat a person who accepted promiscuously everything in Scripture as being\nthe universal and absolute teaching of God, without accurately defining what\nwas adapted to the popular intelligence, would find it impossible to escape\nconfounding the opinions of the masses with the Divine doctrines, praising\nthe judgments and comments of man as the teaching of God, and\nmaking a wrong use of Scriptural authority. (3) Who, I say, does not\nperceive that this is the chief reason why so many sectaries teach\ncontradictory opinions as Divine documents, and support their contentions\nwith numerous Scriptural texts, till it has passed in Belgium into a\nproverb, geen ketter sonder letter - no heretic without a text? (4) The\nsacred books were not written by one man, nor for the people of a single\nperiod, but by many authors of different temperaments, at times extending\nfrom first to last over nearly two thousand years, and perhaps much longer.\n(5) We will not, however, accuse the sectaries of impiety because they have\nadapted the words of Scripture to their own opinions; it is thus that these\nwords were adapted to the understanding of the masses originally, and\neveryone is at liberty so to treat them if he sees that he can thus obey God\nin matters relating to justice and charity with a more full consent: but\nwe do accuse those who will not grant this freedom to their fellows,\nbut who persecute all who differ from them, as God's enemies, however\nhonourable and virtuous be their lives; while, on the other hand, they\ncherish those who agree with them, however foolish they may be, as God's\nelect. (6) Such conduct is as wicked and dangerous to the state as any that\ncan be conceived.\n(7) In order, therefore, to establish the limits to which individual freedom\nshould extend, and to decide what persons, in spite of the diversity of\ntheir opinions, are to be looked upon as the faithful, we must define faith\nand its essentials. (8) This task I hope to accomplish in the present\nchapter, and also to separate faith from philosophy, which is the chief aim\nof the whole treatise.\n(9) In order to proceed duly to the demonstration let us recapitulate the\nchief aim and object of Scripture; this will indicate a standard by which we\nmay define faith.\n(10) We have said in a former chapter that the aim and object of Scripture\nis only to teach obedience. (11) Thus much, I think, no one can question.\n(12) Who does not see that both Testaments are nothing else but schools for\nthis object, and have neither of them any aim beyond inspiring mankind with\na voluntary obedience? (13) For (not to repeat what I said in the last\nchapter) I will remark that Moses did not seek to convince the Jews by\nreason, but bound them by a covenant, by oaths, and by conferring benefits;\nfurther, he threatened the people with punishment if they should infringe\nthe law, and promised rewards if they should obey it.\n(14) All these are not means for teaching knowledge, but for inspiring\nobedience. (15) The doctrine of the Gospels enjoins nothing but simple\nfaith, namely, to believe in God and to honour Him, which is the same thing\nas to obey him. (16) There is no occasion for me to throw further light on\na question so plain by citing Scriptural texts commending obedience, such as\nmay be found in great numbers in both Testaments. (17) Moreover, the Bible\nteaches very clearly in a great many passages what everyone ought to do in\norder to obey God; the whole duty is summed up in love to one's neighbour.\n(18) It cannot, therefore, be denied that he who by God's command loves his\nneighbour as himself is truly obedient and blessed according to the law,\nwhereas he who hates his neighbour or neglects him is rebellious and\nobstinate.\n(19) Lastly, it is plain to everyone that the Bible was not written and\ndisseminated only for the learned, but for men of every age and race;\nwherefore we may rest assured that we are not bound by Scriptural command\nto believe anything beyond what is absolutely necessary for\nfulfilling its main precept.\n(20) This precept, then, is the only standard of the whole Catholic faith,\nand by it alone all the dogmas needful to be believed should be determined.\n(21) So much being abundantly manifest, as is also the fact that all other\ndoctrines of the faith can be legitimately deduced therefrom by reason\nalone, I leave it to every man to decide for himself how it comes to pass\nthat so many divisions have arisen in the Church: can it be from any other\ncause than those suggested at the beginning of Chap. VIII.? (22) It is these\nsame causes which compel me to explain the method of determining the dogmas\nof the faith from the foundation we have discovered, for if I\nneglected to do so, and put the question on a regular basis, I might justly\nbe said to have promised too lavishly, for that anyone might, by my showing,\nintroduce any doctrine he liked into religion, under the pretext that it was\na necessary means to obedience: especially would this be the case in\nquestions respecting the Divine attributes.\n(23) In order, therefore, to set forth the whole matter methodically, I will\nbegin with a definition of faith, which on the principle above given, should\nbe as follows:-\n(24) Faith consists in a knowledge of God, without which obedience to Him\nwould be impossible, and which the mere fact of obedience to Him implies.\n(25) This definition is so clear, and follows so plainly from what we have\nalready proved, that it needs no explanation. (26) The consequences involved\ntherein I will now briefly show.\n(27) (I.) Faith is not salutary in itself, but only in respect to the\nobedience it implies, or as James puts it in his Epistle, ii:17, \"Faith\nwithout works is dead\" (see the whole of the chapter quoted).\n(28) (II.) He who is truly obedient necessarily possesses true and saving\nfaith; for if obedience be granted, faith must be granted also, as the same\nApostle expressly says in these words (ii:18), \"Show me thy faith without\nthy works, and I will show thee my faith by my works.\" (29) So also\nJohn, I Ep. iv:7: \"Everyone that loveth is born of God, and knoweth\nGod: he that loveth not, knoweth not God; for God is love.\" (30) From these\ntexts, I repeat, it follows that we can only judge a man faithful or\nunfaithful by his works. (31) If his works be good, he is faithful, however\nmuch his doctrines may differ from those of the rest of the faithful: if his\nworks be evil, though he may verbally conform, he is unfaithful. (32) For\nobedience implies faith, and faith without works is dead.\n(33) John, in the 13th verse of the chapter above quoted, expressly teaches\nthe same doctrine: \"Hereby,\" he says, \"know we that we dwell in Him and He\nin us, because He hath given us of His Spirit,\" i.e. love. (34) He had said\nbefore that God is love, and therefore he concludes (on his own received\nprinciples), that whoso possesses love possesses truly the Spirit of God.\n(35) As no one has beheld God he infers that no one has knowledge or\nconsciousness of God, except from love towards his neighbour, and also that\nno one can have knowledge of any of God's attributes, except this of love,\nin so far as we participate therein.\n(36) If these arguments are not conclusive, they, at any rate, show the\nApostle's meaning, but the words in chap. ii:3, 4, of the same Epistle are\nmuch clearer, for they state in so many words our precise contention: \"And\nhereby we do know that we know Him, if we keep His commandments. (37) He\nthat saith, I know Him, and keepeth not His commandments, is a liar, and the\ntruth is not in him.\"\n(38) From all this, I repeat, it follows that they are the true enemies of\nChrist who persecute honourable and justice-loving men because they differ\nfrom them, and do not uphold the same religious dogmas as themselves: for\nwhosoever loves justice and charity we know, by that very fact, to be\nfaithful: whosoever persecutes the faithful, is an enemy to Christ.\n(39) Lastly, it follows that faith does not demand that dogmas should be\ntrue as that they should be pious - that is, such as will stir up the heart\nto obey; though there be many such which contain not a shadow of truth, so\nlong as they be held in good faith, otherwise their adherents are\ndisobedient, for how can anyone, desirous of loving justice and obeying God,\nadore as Divine what he knows to be alien from the Divine nature? (40)\nHowever, men may err from simplicity of mind, and Scripture, as we\nhave seen, does not condemn ignorance, but obstinacy. (41) This is the\nnecessary result of our definition of faith, and all its branches\nshould spring from the universal rule above given, and from the evident aim\nand object of the Bible, unless we choose to mix our own inventions\ntherewith. (42) Thus it is not true doctrines which are expressly required\nby the Bible, so much as doctrines necessary for obedience, and to confirm\nin our hearts the love of our neighbour, wherein (to adopt the words of\nJohn) we are in God, and God in us.\n(43) As, then, each man's faith must be judged pious or impious only in\nrespect of its producing obedience or obstinacy, and not in respect of its\ntruth; and as no one will dispute that men's dispositions are exceedingly\nvaried, that all do not acquiesce in the same things, but are ruled\nsome by one opinion some by another, so that what moves one to devotion\nmoves another to laughter and contempt, it follows that there can be no\ndoctrines in the Catholic, or universal, religion, which can give rise to\ncontroversy among good men. (44) Such doctrines might be pious to some and\nimpious to others, whereas they should be judged solely by their fruits.\n(45) To the universal religion, then, belong only such dogmas as are\nabsolutely required in order to attain obedience to God, and without which\nsuch obedience would be impossible; as for the rest, each man-seeing that\nhe is the best judge of his own character-should adopt whatever he thinks\nbest adapted to strengthen his love of justice. (46) If this were so, I\nthink there would be no further occasion for controversies in the Church.\n(47) I have now no further fear in enumerating the dogmas of universal faith\nor the fundamental dogmas of the whole of Scripture, inasmuch as they all\ntend (as may be seen from what has been said) to this one doctrine, namely,\nthat there exists a God, that is, a Supreme Being, Who loves justice and\ncharity, and Who must be obeyed by whosoever would be saved; that the\nworship of this Being consists in the practice of justice and love towards\none's neighbour, and that they contain nothing beyond the following\ndoctrines:-\n(48) I. That God or a Supreme Being exists, sovereignly just and merciful,\nthe Exemplar of the true life; that whosoever is ignorant of or\ndisbelieves in His existence cannot obey Him or know Him as a Judge.\n(49) II. That He is One. (50) Nobody will dispute that this doctrine is\nabsolutely necessary for entire devotion, admiration, and love towards God.\n(51) For devotion, admiration, and love spring from the superiority of one\nover all else.\n(52) III. That He is omnipresent, or that all things are open to Him, for if\nanything could be supposed to be concealed from Him, or to be unnoticed by,\nHim, we might doubt or be ignorant of the equity of His judgment as\ndirecting all things.\n(53) IV. That He has supreme right and dominion over all things, and that He\ndoes nothing under compulsion, but by His absolute fiat and grace. (54) All\nthings are bound to obey Him, He is not bound to obey any.\n(55) V. That the worship of God consists only in justice and charity, or\nlove towards one's neighbour.\n(56) VI. That all those, and those only, who obey God by their manner of\nlife are saved; the rest of mankind, who live under the sway of their\npleasures, are lost. (57) If we did not believe this, there would be no\nreason for obeying God rather than pleasure.\n(58) VII. Lastly, that God forgives the sins of those who repent. (59) No\none is free from sin, so that without this belief all would despair of\nsalvation, and there would be no reason for believing in the mercy of God.\n(60) He who firmly believes that God, out of the mercy and grace with which\nHe directs all things, forgives the sins of men, and who feels his love of\nGod kindled thereby, he, I say, does really know Christ according to the\nSpirit, and Christ is in him.\n(61) No one can deny that all these doctrines are before all things\nnecessary to be believed, in order that every man, without exception, may\nbe able to obey God according to the bidding of the Law above explained, for\nif one of these precepts be disregarded obedience is destroyed.\n(62) But as to what God, or the Exemplar of the true life, may be, whether\nfire, or spirit, or light, or thought, or what not, this, I say, has nothing\nto do with faith any more than has the question how He comes to be the\nExemplar of the true life, whether it be because He has a just and\nmerciful mind, or because all things exist and act through Him, and\nconsequently that we understand through Him, and through Him see what\nis truly just and good. (63) Everyone may think on such questions as he\nlikes.\n(64) Furthermore, faith is not affected, whether we hold that God is\nomnipresent essentially or potentially; that He directs all things by\nabsolute fiat, or by the necessity of His nature; that He dictates laws like\na prince, or that He sets them forth as eternal truths; that man obeys Him\nby virtue of free will, or by virtue of the necessity of the Divine decree;\nlastly, that the reward of the good and the punishment of the wicked is\nnatural or supernatural: these and such like questions have no bearing on\nfaith, except in so far as they are used as means to give us license to sin\nmore, or to obey God less. (65) I will go further, and maintain that every\nman is bound to adapt these dogmas to his own way of thinking, and to\ninterpret them according as he feels that he can give them his fullest and\nmost unhesitating assent, so that he may the more easily obey God with his\nwhole heart.\n(66) Such was the manner, as we have already pointed out, in which the faith\nwas in old time revealed and written, in accordance with the understanding\nand opinions of the prophets and people of the period; so, in like fashion,\nevery man is bound to adapt it to his own opinions, so that he may accept it\nwithout any hesitation or mental repugnance. (67) We have shown that faith\ndoes not so much require truth as piety, and that it is only quickening and\npious through obedience, consequently no one is faithful save by obedience\nalone. (68) The best faith is not necessarily possessed by him who displays\nthe best reasons, but by him who displays the best fruits of justice and\ncharity. (69) How salutary and necessary this doctrine is for a state, in\norder that men may dwell together in peace and concord; and how many and how\ngreat causes of disturbance and crime are thereby cut off, I leave everyone\nto judge for himself!\n(70) Before we go further, I may remark that we can, by means of what we\nhave just proved, easily answer the objections raised in Chap. I., when we\nwere discussing God's speaking with the Israelites on Mount Sinai. (71) For,\nthough the voice heard by the Israelites could not give those men any\nphilosophical or mathematical certitude of God's existence, it was yet\nsufficient to thrill them with admiration for God, as they already knew Him,\nand to stir them up to obedience: and such was the object of the display.\n(72) God did not wish to teach the Israelites the absolute attributes of His\nessence (none of which He then revealed), but to break down their hardness\nof heart, and to draw them to obedience: therefore He did not appeal to them\nwith reasons, but with the sound of trumpets, thunder, and lightnings.\n(73) It remains for me to show that between faith or theology, and\nphilosophy, there is no connection, nor affinity. (74) I think no one will\ndispute the fact who has knowledge of the aim and foundations of the two\nsubjects, for they are as wide apart as the poles.\n(75) Philosophy has no end in view save truth: faith, as we have abundantly\nproved, looks for nothing but obedience and piety. (76) Again, philosophy is\nbased on axioms which must be sought from nature alone: faith is based on\nhistory and language, and must be sought for only in Scripture and\nrevelation, as we showed in Chap. VII. (77) Faith, therefore, allows the\ngreatest latitude in philosophic speculation, allowing us without blame to\nthink what we like about anything, and only condemning, as heretics and\nschismatics, those who teach opinions which tend to produce obstinacy,\nhatred, strife, and anger; while, on the other hand, only considering\nas faithful those who persuade us, as far as their reason and faculties will\npermit, to follow justice and charity.\n(78) Lastly, as what we are now setting forth are the most important\nsubjects of my treatise, I would most urgently beg the reader, before I\nproceed, to read these two chapters with especial attention, and to take the\ntrouble to weigh them well in his mind: let him take for granted that I\nhave not written with a view to introducing novelties, but in order to do\naway with abuses, such as I hope I may, at some future time, at last see\nreformed.\nCHAPTER XV - THEOLOGY IS SHOWN NOT TO BE SUBSERVIENT TO REASON,\nNOR REASON TO THEOLOGY: A DEFINITION OF THE REASON WHICH\nENABLES US TO ACCEPT THE AUTHORITY OF THE BIBLE.\n(1) Those who know not that philosophy and reason are distinct, dispute\nwhether Scripture should be made subservient to reason, or reason to\nScripture: that is, whether the meaning of Scripture should be made to\nagreed with reason; or whether reason should be made to agree with\nScripture: the latter position is assumed by the sceptics who deny the\ncertitude of reason, the former by the dogmatists. (2) Both parties are, as\nI have shown, utterly in the wrong, for either doctrine would require us to\ntamper with reason or with Scripture.\n(3) We have shown that Scripture does not teach philosophy, but merely\nobedience, and that all it contains has been adapted to the understanding\nand established opinions of the multitude. (4) Those, therefore, who wish to\nadapt it to philosophy, must needs ascribe to the prophets many ideas which\nthey never even dreamed of, and give an extremely forced interpretation to\ntheir words: those on the other hand, who would make reason and philosophy\nsubservient to theology, will be forced to accept as Divine utterances the\nprejudices of the ancient Jews, and to fill and confuse their mind\ntherewith. (5) In short, one party will run wild with the aid of reason,\nand the other will run wild without the aid of reason.\n(6) The first among the Pharisees who openly maintained that Scripture\nshould be made to agree with reason, was Maimonides, whose opinion we\nreviewed, and abundantly refuted in Chap. VIII.: now, although this writer\nhad much authority among his contemporaries, he was deserted on this\nquestion by almost all, and the majority went straight over to the\nopinion of a certain R. Jehuda Alpakhar, who, in his anxiety to avoid the\nerror of Maimonides, fell into another, which was its exact contrary. (7) He\nheld that reason should be made subservient, and entirely give way to\nScripture. (8) He thought that a passage should not be interpreted\nmetaphorically, simply because it was repugnant to reason, but only in the\ncases when it is inconsistent with Scripture itself - that is, with its\nclear doctrines. (9) Therefore he laid down the universal rule, that\nwhatsoever Scripture teaches dogmatically, and affirms expressly, must on\nits own sole authority be admitted as absolutely true: that there is no\ndoctrine in the Bible which directly contradicts the general tenour of\nthe whole: but only some which appear to involve a difference, for the\nphrases of Scripture often seem to imply something contrary to what has been\nexpressly taught. (10) Such phrases, and such phrases only, we may interpret\nmetaphorically.\n(11) For instance, Scripture clearly teaches the unity of God (see Deut.\nvi:4), nor is there any text distinctly asserting a plurality of gods; but\nin several passages God speaks of Himself, and the prophets speak of Him, in\nthe plural number; such phrases are simply a manner of speaking, and do not\nmean that there actually are several gods: they are to be explained\nmetaphorically, not because a plurality of gods is repugnant to reason, but\nbecause Scripture distinctly asserts that there is only one.\n(12) So, again, as Scripture asserts (as Alpakhar thinks) in Deut. iv:15,\nthat God is incorporeal, we are bound, solely by the authority of this text,\nand not by reason, to believe that God has no body: consequently we must\nexplain metaphorically, on the sole authority of Scripture, all those\npassages which attribute to God hands, feet, &c., and take them merely as\nfigures of speech. (13) Such is the opinion of Alpakhar. In so far as he\nseeks to explain Scripture by Scripture, I praise him, but I marvel that a\nman gifted with reason should wish to debase that faculty. (14) It is\ntrue that Scripture should be explained by Scripture, so long as we are in\ndifficulties about the meaning and intention of the prophets, but when we\nhave elicited the true meaning, we must of necessity make use of our\njudgment and reason in order to assent thereto. (15) If reason, however,\nmuch as she rebels, is to be entirely subjected to Scripture, I ask,\nare we to effect her submission by her own aid, or without her, and\nblindly? (16) If the latter, we shall surely act foolishly and\ninjudiciously; if the former, we assent to Scripture under the dominion of\nreason, and should not assent to it without her. (17) Moreover, I may ask\nnow, is a man to assent to anything against his reason? (18) What is denial\nif it be not reason's refusal to assent? (19) In short, I am astonished that\nanyone should wish to subject reason, the greatest of gifts and a light from\non high, to the dead letter which may have been corrupted by human malice;\nthat it should be thought no crime to speak with contempt of mind, the true\nhandwriting of God's Word, calling it corrupt, blind, and lost, while it is\nconsidered the greatest of crimes to say the same of the letter, which is\nmerely the reflection and image of God's Word. (20) Men think it pious\nto trust nothing to reason and their own judgment, and impious to doubt the\nfaith of those who have transmitted to us the sacred books. (21) Such\nconduct is not piety, but mere folly. And, after all, why are they so\nanxious? What are they afraid of? (22) Do they think that faith and religion\ncannot be upheld unless men purposely keep themselves in ignorance, and\nturn their backs on reason? (23) If this be so, they have but a timid trust\nin Scripture.\n(23) However, be it far from me to say that religion should seek to enslave\nreason, or reason religion, or that both should not be able to keep their\nsovereignity in perfect harmony. (24) I will revert to this question\npresently, for I wish now to discuss Alpakhar's rule.\n(26) He requires, as we have stated, that we should accept as true, or\nreject as false, everything asserted or denied by Scripture, and he further\nstates that Scripture never expressly asserts or denies anything which\ncontradicts its assertions or negations elsewhere. (27) The rashness of\nsuch a requirement and statement can escape no one. (28) For (passing over\nthe fact that he does not notice that Scripture consists of different books,\nwritten at different times, for different people, by different authors: and\nalso that his requirement is made on his own authority without\nany corroboration from reason or Scripture) he would be bound to show that\nall passages which are indirectly contradictory of the rest, can be\nsatisfactorily explained metaphorically through the nature of the language\nand the context: further, that Scripture has come down to us untampered\nwith. (29) However, we will go into the matter at length.\n(30) Firstly, I ask what shall we do if reason prove recalcitrant? (31)\nShall we still be bound to affirm whatever Scripture affirms, and to deny\nwhatever Scripture denies? (32) Perhaps it will be answered that Scripture\ncontains nothing repugnant to reason. (33) But I insist that it expressly\naffirms and teaches that God is jealous (namely, in the decalogue itself,\nand in Exod. xxxiv:14, and in Deut. iv:24, and in many other places), and I\nassert that such a doctrine is repugnant to reason. (34) It must, I suppose,\nin spite of all, be accepted as true. If there are any passages in\nScripture which imply that God is not jealous, they must be taken\nmetaphorically as meaning nothing of the kind. (35) So, also, Scripture\nexpressly states (Exod. xix:20, &c.) that God came down to Mount Sinai, and\nit attributes to Him other movements from place to place, nowhere\ndirectly stating that God does not so move. (36) Wherefore, we must take the\npassage literally, and Solomon's words (I Kings viii:27), \"But will God\ndwell on the earth? (37) Behold the heavens and earth cannot contain thee,\"\ninasmuch as they do not expressly state that God does not move from place to\nplace, but only imply it, must be explained away till they have no further\nsemblance of denying locomotion to the Deity. (38) So also we must believe\nthat the sky is the habitation and throne of God, for Scripture expressly\nsays so; and similarly many passages expressing the opinions of the prophets\nor the multitude, which reason and philosophy, but not Scripture, tell us to\nbe false, must be taken as true if we are to follow the guidance of our\nauthor, for according to him, reason has nothing to do with the matter. (39)\nFurther, it is untrue that Scripture never contradicts itself directly, but\nonly by implication. (40) For Moses says, in so many words (Deut. iv:24),\n\"The Lord thy God is a consuming fire,\" and elsewhere expressly denies that\nGod has any likeness to visible things. (Deut. iv. 12.) (41) If it be\ndecided that the latter passage only contradicts the former by implication,\nand must be adapted thereto, lest it seem to negative it, let us grant that\nGod is a fire; or rather, lest we should seem to have taken leave\nof our senses, let us pass the matter over and take another example.\n(42) Samuel expressly denies that God ever repents, \"for he is not a man\nthat he should repent\" (I Sam. xv:29). (43) Jeremiah, on the other hand,\nasserts that God does repent, both of the evil and of the good which He had\nintended to do (Jer. xviii:8-10). (44) What? (45) Are not these two\ntexts directly contradictory? (46) Which of the two, then, would our author\nwant to explain metaphorically? (47) Both statements are general, and each\nis the opposite of the other - what one flatly affirms, the other flatly,\ndenies. (48) So, by his own rule, he would be obliged at once to reject them\nas false, and to accept them as true.\n(49) Again, what is the point of one passage, not being contradicted by\nanother directly, but only by implication, if the implication is clear, and\nthe nature and context of the passage preclude metaphorical interpretation?\n(50) There are many such instances in the Bible, as we saw in Chap. II.\n(where we pointed out that the prophets held different and contradictory\nopinions), and also in Chaps. IX. and X., where we drew attention to the\ncontradictions in the historical narratives. (51) There is no need for me to\ngo through them all again, for what I have said sufficiently exposes the\nabsurdities which would follow from an opinion and rule such as we are\ndiscussing, and shows the hastiness of its propounder.\n(52) We may, therefore, put this theory, as well as that of Maimonides,\nentirely out of court; and we may take it for indisputable that theology is\nnot bound to serve reason, nor reason theology, but that each has her own\ndomain.\n(53) The sphere of reason is, as we have said, truth and wisdom; the sphere\nof theology, is piety and obedience. (54) The power of reason does not\nextend so far as to determine for us that men may be blessed through simple\nobedience, without understanding. (55) Theology, tells us nothing else,\nenjoins on us no command save obedience, and has neither the will nor the\npower to oppose reason: she defines the dogmas of faith (as we pointed out\nin the last chapter) only in so far as they may be necessary for obedience,\nand leaves reason to determine their precise truth: for reason is the\nlight of the mind, and without her all things are dreams and phantoms.\n(56) By theology, I here mean, strictly speaking, revelation, in so far as\nit indicates the object aimed at by Scripture namely, the scheme and manner\nof obedience, or the true dogmas of piety and faith. (57) This may truly be\ncalled the Word of God, which does not consist in a certain number of books\n(see Chap. XII.). (58) Theology thus understood, if we regard its precepts\nor rules of life, will be found in accordance with reason; and, if we look\nto its aim and object, will be seen to be in nowise repugnant thereto,\nwherefore it is universal to all men.\n(59) As for its bearing on Scripture, we have shown in Chap. VII. that the\nmeaning of Scripture should be gathered from its own history, and not from\nthe history of nature in general, which is the basis of philosophy.\n(60) We ought not to be hindered if we find that our investigation of the\nmeaning of Scripture thus conducted shows us that it is here and there\nrepugnant to reason; for whatever we may find of this sort in the Bible,\nwhich men may be in ignorance of, without injury to their charity, has, we\nmay be sure, no bearing on theology or the Word of God, and may, therefore,\nwithout blame, be viewed by every one as he pleases.\n(61) To sum up, we may draw the absolute conclusion that the Bible must not\nbe accommodated to reason, nor reason to the Bible.\n(62) Now, inasmuch as the basis of theology - the doctrine that man may be\nsaved by obedience alone - cannot be proved by reason whether it be true or\nfalse, we may be asked, Why, then, should we believe it? (63) If we do so\nwithout the aid of reason, we accept it blindly, and act foolishly and\ninjudiciously; if, on the other hand, we settle that it can be proved by\nreason, theology becomes a part of philosophy, and inseparable therefrom.\n(64) But I make answer that I have absolutely established that this basis of\ntheology cannot be investigated by the natural light of reason, or, at any\nrate, that no one ever has proved it by such means, and, therefore,\nrevelation was necessary. (65) We should, however, make use of our reason,\nin order to grasp with moral certainty what is revealed - I say, with moral\ncertainty, for we cannot hope to attain greater certainty than the\nprophets: yet their certainty was only, moral, as I showed in Chap. II.\n(66) Those, therefore, who attempt to set forth the authority of Scripture\nwith mathematical demonstrations are wholly in error: for the authority of\nthe Bible is dependent on the authority of the prophets, and can be\nsupported by no stronger arguments than those employed in old time by the\nprophets for convincing the people of their own authority. (67) Our\ncertainty on the same subject can be founded on no other basis than that\nwhich served as foundation for the certainty of the prophets.\n(68) Now the certainty of the prophets consisted (as we pointed out) in\nthese elements:-\n(69) (I.) A distinct and vivid imagination.\n(70) (II.) A sign.\n(71) (III.) Lastly, and chiefly, a mind turned to what is just and good.\nIt was based on no other reasons than these, and consequently they cannot\nprove their authority by any other reasons, either to the multitude whom\nthey addressed orally, nor to us whom they address in writing.\n(72) The first of these reasons, namely, the vivid imagination, could be\nvalid only for the prophets; therefore, our certainty concerning revelation\nmust, and ought to be, based on the remaining two - namely, the sign and the\nteaching. (73) Such is the express doctrine of Moses, for (in Deut. xviii.)\nhe bids the people obey the prophet who should give a true sign in the name\nof the Lord, but if he should predict falsely, even though it were in the\nname of the Lord, he should be put to death, as should also he who strives\nto lead away the people from the true religion, though he confirm his\nauthority with signs and portents. (74) We may compare with the above Deut.\nxiii. (75) Whence it follows that a true prophet could be distinguished from\na false one, both by his doctrine and by the miracles he wrought, for Moses\ndeclares such an one to be a true prophet, and bids the people trust him\nwithout fear of deceit. (76) He condemns as false, and worthy of death,\nthose who predict anything falsely even in the name of the Lord, or who\npreach false gods, even though their miracles be real.\n(77) The only reason, then, which we have for belief in Scripture or the\nwritings of the prophets, is the doctrine we find therein, and the\nsigns by which it is confirmed. (78) For as we see that the prophets extol\ncharity and justice above all things, and have no other object, we\nconclude that they did not write from unworthy motives, but because they\nreally thought that men might become blessed through obedience and faith:\nfurther, as we see that they confirmed their teaching with signs and\nwonders, we become persuaded that they did not speak at random, nor run riot\nin their prophecies. (79) We are further strengthened in our conclusion by\nthe fact that the morality they teach is in evident agreement with reason,\nfor it is no accidental coincidence that the Word of God which we find in\nthe prophets coincides with the Word of God written in our hearts. (80) We\nmay, I say, conclude this from the sacred books as certainly as did the Jews\nof old from the living voice of the prophets: for we showed in Chap. XII.\nthat Scripture has come down to us intact in respect to its doctrine and\nmain narratives.\n(81) Therefore this whole basis of theology and Scripture, though it does\nnot admit of mathematical proof, may yet be accepted with the approval of\nour judgment. (82) It would be folly to refuse to accept what is confirmed\nby such ample prophetic testimony, and what has proved such a comfort to\nthose whose reason is comparatively weak, and such a benefit to the state; a\ndoctrine, moreover, which we may believe in without the slightest peril or\nhurt, and should reject simply because it cannot be mathematically proved:\nit is as though we should admit nothing as true, or as a wise rule of life,\nwhich could ever, in any possible way, be called in question; or as though\nmost of our actions were not full of uncertainty and hazards.\n(83) I admit that those who believe that theology and philosophy are\nmutually contradictory, and that therefore either one or the other must be\nthrust from its throne - I admit, I say, that such persons are not\nunreasonable in attempting to put theology on a firm basis, and to\ndemonstrate its truth mathematically. (84) Who, unless he were desperate or\nmad, would wish to bid an incontinent farewell to reason, or to despise the\narts and sciences, or to deny reason's certitude? (85) But, in the\nmeanwhile, we cannot wholly absolve them from blame, inasmuch as they invoke\nthe aid of reason for her own defeat, and attempt infallibly to prove her\nfallible. (86) While they are trying to prove mathematically the\nauthority and truth of theology, and to take away the authority of natural\nreason, they are in reality only bringing theology under reason's dominion,\nand proving that her authority has no weight unless natural reason be at the\nback of it.\n(87) If they boast that they themselves assent because of the inward\ntestimony of the Holy Spirit, and that they only invoke the aid of reason\nbecause of unbelievers, in order to convince them, not even so can this meet\nwith our approval, for we can easily show that they have spoken either from\nemotion or vain-glory. (88) It most clearly follows from the last chapter\nthat the Holy Spirit only gives its testimony in favour of works, called by\nPaul (in Gal. v:22) the fruits of the Spirit, and is in itself really\nnothing but the mental acquiescence which follows a good action in our\nsouls. (89) No spirit gives testimony concerning the certitude of matters\nwithin the sphere of speculation, save only reason, who is mistress, as we\nhave shown, of the whole realm of truth. (90) If then they assert that they\npossess this Spirit which makes them certain of truth, they speak falsely,\nand according to the prejudices of the emotions, or else they are in great\ndread lest they should be vanquished by philosophers and exposed to public\nridicule, and therefore they flee, as it were, to the altar; but their\nrefuge is vain, for what altar will shelter a man who has outraged reason?\n(91) However, I pass such persons over, for I think I have fulfilled my\npurpose, and shown how philosophy should be separated from theology, and\nwherein each consists; that neither should be subservient to the other, but\nthat each should keep her unopposed dominion. (92) Lastly, as occasion\noffered, I have pointed out the absurdities, the inconveniences, and the\nevils following from the extraordinary confusion which has hitherto\nprevailed between the two subjects, owing to their not being properly\ndistinguished and separated. (93) Before I go further I would expressly\nstate (though I have said it before) that I consider the utility and the\nneed for Holy Scripture or Revelation to be very great. (94) For as we\ncannot perceive by the natural light of reason that simple obedience is the\npath of salvation [Endnote 25], and are taught by revelation only that it is\nso by the special grace of God, which our reason cannot attain, it follows\nthat the Bible has brought a very great consolation to mankind. (95) All\nare able to obey, whereas there are but very few, compared with the\naggregate of humanity, who can acquire the habit of virtue under the unaided\nguidance of reason. (96) Thus if we had not the testimony of Scripture, we\nshould doubt of the salvation of nearly all men.\nEnd of Part 3 - Chapters XI to XV.\nAUTHOR'S ENDNOTES TO THE THEOLOGICO-POLITICAL TREATISE\nCHAPTER XI.\nEndnote 24.

(2) It is\nnow time to determine the limits to which such freedom of thought and\ndiscussion may extend itself in the ideal state. (3) For the due\nconsideration of this question we must examine the foundations of a State,\nfirst turning our attention to the natural rights of individuals, and\nafterwards to religion and the state as a whole.\n(16:4) By the right and ordinance of nature, I merely mean those natural\nlaws wherewith we conceive every individual to be conditioned by nature, so\nas to live and act in a given way. (5) For instance, fishes are naturally\nconditioned for swimming, and the greater for devouring the less; therefore\nfishes enjoy the water, and the greater devour the less by sovereign natural\nright. [16:1] (6) For it is certain that nature, taken in the abstract, has\nsovereign right to do anything she can; in other words, her right is\nco-extensive with her power. (7) The power of nature is the power of God,\nwhich has sovereign right over all things; and, inasmuch as the power of nature\nis simply the aggregate of the powers of all her individual components, it\nfollows that every individual has sovereign right to do all that he can; in\nother words, the rights of an individual extend to the utmost limits of his\npower as it has been conditioned. (8) Now it is the sovereign law and right\nof nature that each individual should endeavour to preserve itself as it is,\nwithout regard to anything but itself; therefore this sovereign law and\nright belongs to every individual, namely, to exist and act according\nto its natural conditions. (9) We do not here acknowledge any\ndifference between mankind and other individual natural entities, nor\nbetween men endowed with reason and those to whom reason is unknown; nor\nbetween fools, madmen, and sane men. (10) Whatsoever an individual does by\nthe laws of its nature it has a sovereign right to do, inasmuch as it\nacts as it was conditioned by nature, and cannot act otherwise. [16:2] (11)\nWherefore among men, so long as they are considered as living under the sway\nof nature, he who does not yet know reason, or who has not yet acquired the\nhabit of virtue, acts solely according to the laws of his desire with as\nsovereign a right as he who orders his life entirely by the laws of reason.\n(16:12) That is, as the wise man has sovereign right to do all that reason\ndictates, or to live according to the laws of reason, so also the ignorant\nand foolish man has sovereign right to do all that desire dictates, or to\nlive according to the laws of desire. (13) This is identical with the\nteaching of Paul, who acknowledges that previous to the law - that is, so\nlong as men are considered of as living under the sway of nature, there is\nno sin.\n(16:14) The natural right of the individual man is thus determined, not by\nsound reason, but by desire and power. (15) All are not naturally\nconditioned so as to act according to the laws and rules of reason; nay, on\nthe contrary, all men are born ignorant, and before they can learn the\nright way of life and acquire the habit of virtue, the greater part of their\nlife, even if they have been well brought up, has passed away. (16)\nNevertheless, they are in the meanwhile bound to live and preserve\nthemselves as far as they can by the unaided impulses of desire. (17) Nature\nhas given them no other guide, and has denied them the present power of\nliving according to sound reason; so that they are no more bound to live by\nthe dictates of an enlightened mind, than a cat is bound to live by the laws\nof the nature of a lion.\n(16:18) Whatsoever, therefore, an individual (considered as under the sway\nof nature) thinks useful for himself, whether led by sound reason or\nimpelled by the passions, that he has a sovereign right to seek and to take\nfor himself as he best can, whether by force, cunning, entreaty, or any\nother means; consequently he may regard as an enemy anyone who hinders\nthe accomplishment of his purpose.\n(16:19) It follows from what we have said that the right and ordinance of\nnature, under which all men are born, and under which they mostly live, only\nprohibits such things as no one desires, and no one can attain: it does not\nforbid strife, nor hatred, nor anger, nor deceit, nor, indeed, any of\nthe means suggested by desire.\n(16:20) This we need not wonder at, for nature is not bounded by the laws of\nhuman reason, which aims only at man's true benefit and preservation; her\nlimits are infinitely wider, and have reference to the eternal order of\nnature, wherein man is but a speck; it is by the necessity of this alone\nthat all individuals are conditioned for living and acting in a particular\nway. (21) If anything, therefore, in nature seems to us ridiculous, absurd,\nor evil, it is because we only know in part, and are almost entirely\nignorant of the order and interdependence of nature as a whole, and also\nbecause we want everything to be arranged according to the dictates of our\nhuman reason; in reality that which reason considers evil, is not evil in\nrespect to the order and laws of nature as a whole, but only in respect to\nthe laws of our reason.\n(16:22) Nevertheless, no one can doubt that it is much better for us to live\naccording to the laws and assured dictates of reason, for, as we said, they\nhave men's true good for their object. (23) Moreover, everyone wishes to\nlive as far as possible securely beyond the reach of fear, and this would be\nquite impossible so long as everyone did everything he liked, and reason's\nclaim was lowered to a par with those of hatred and anger; there is no one\nwho is not ill at ease in the midst of enmity, hatred, anger, and deceit,\nand who does not seek to avoid them as much as he can. [16:3] (24) When we\nreflect that men without mutual help, or the aid of reason, must needs live\nmost miserably, as we clearly proved in Chap. V., we shall plainly see that\nmen must necessarily come to an agreement to live together as securely and\nwell as possible if they are to enjoy as a whole the rights which naturally\nbelong to them as individuals, and their life should be no more conditioned\nby the force and desire of individuals, but by the power and will of the\nwhole body. (25) This end they will be unable to attain if desire be\ntheir only guide (for by the laws of desire each man is drawn in a different\ndirection); they must, therefore, most firmly decree and establish that they\nwill be guided in everything by reason (which nobody will dare openly to\nrepudiate lest he should be taken for a madman), and will restrain any\ndesire which is injurious to a man's fellows, that they will do to all as\nthey would be done by, and that they will defend their neighbour's rights as\ntheir own.\n(16:26) How such a compact as this should be entered into, how ratified and\nestablished, we will now inquire.\n(27) Now it is a universal law of human nature that no one ever neglects\nanything which he judges to be good, except with the hope of gaining a\ngreater good, or from the fear of a greater evil; nor does anyone endure an\nevil except for the sake of avoiding a greater evil, or gaining a greater\ngood. (28) That is, everyone will, of two goods, choose that which he thinks\nthe greatest; and, of two evils, that which he thinks the least. (29) I say\nadvisedly that which he thinks the greatest or the least, for it does not\nnecessarily follow that he judges right. (30) This law is so deeply\nimplanted in the human mind that it ought to be counted among eternal truths\nand axioms.\n(16:31) As a necessary consequence of the principle just enunciated, no one\ncan honestly promise to forego the right which he has over all things\n[Endnote 26], and in general no one will abide by his promises, unless under\nthe fear of a greater evil, or the hope of a greater good. (32) An example\nwill make the matter clearer. (33) Suppose that a robber forces me to\npromise that I will give him my goods at his will and pleasure. (34) It is\nplain (inasmuch as my natural right is, as I have shown, co-extensive with\nmy power) that if I can free myself from this robber by stratagem, by\nassenting to his demands, I have the natural right to do so, and to pretend\nto accept his conditions. (35) Or again, suppose I have genuinely promised\nsomeone that for the space of twenty days I will not taste food or any\nnourishment; and suppose I afterwards find that was foolish, and cannot be\nkept without very great injury to myself; as I am bound by natural law and\nright to choose the least of two evils, I have complete right to break my\ncompact, and act as if my promise had never been uttered. (36) I say that I\nshould have perfect natural right to do so, whether I was actuated by true\nand evident reason, or whether I was actuated by mere opinion in thinking I\nhad promised rashly; whether my reasons were true or false, I should be in\nfear of a greater evil, which, by the ordinance of nature, I should strive\nto avoid by every means in my power.\n(16:37) We may, therefore, conclude that a compact is only made valid by its\nutility, without which it becomes null and void. (38) It is, therefore,\nfoolish to ask a man to keep his faith with us for ever, unless we also\nendeavour that the violation of the compact we enter into shall involve for\nthe violator more harm than good. (39) This consideration should have very\ngreat weight in forming a state. (40) However, if all men could be easily\nled by reason alone, and could recognize what is best and most useful for a\nstate, there would be no one who would not forswear deceit, for everyone\nwould keep most religiously to their compact in their desire for the chief\ngood, namely, the shield and buckler of the commonwealth. (41) However, it\nis far from being the case that all men can always be easily led by reason\nalone; everyone is drawn away by his pleasure, while avarice, ambition,\nenvy, hatred, and the like so engross the mind that, reason has no place\ntherein. (42) Hence, though men make promises with all the appearances of\ngood faith, and agree that they will keep to their engagement, no one can\nabsolutely rely on another man's promise unless there is something behind\nit. (43) Everyone has by nature a right to act deceitfully, and to break his\ncompacts, unless he be restrained by the hope of some greater good, or the\nfear of some greater evil.\n(16:44) However, as we have shown that the natural right of the individual\nis only limited by his power, it is clear that by transferring, either\nwillingly or under compulsion, this power into the hands of another, he in\nso doing necessarily cedes also a part of his right; and further, that the\nSovereign right over all men belongs to him who has sovereign power,\nwherewith he can compel men by force, or restrain them by threats of the\nuniversally feared punishment of death; such sovereign right he will\nretain only so long as he can maintain his power of enforcing his will;\notherwise he will totter on his throne, and no one who is stronger than he\nwill be bound unwillingly to obey him.\n(16:45) In this manner a society can be formed without any violation of\nnatural right, and the covenant can always be strictly kept - that is, if\neach individual hands over the whole of his power to the body politic, the\nlatter will then possess sovereign natural right over all things; that is,\nit will have sole and unquestioned dominion, and everyone will be bound to\nobey, under pain of the severest punishment. (46) A body politic of this\nkind is called a Democracy, which may be defined as a society which wields\nall its power as a whole. (47) The sovereign power is not restrained by any\nlaws, but everyone is bound to obey it in all things; such is the state of\nthings implied when men either tacitly or expressly handed over to it all\ntheir power of self-defence, or in other words, all their right. (48) For if\nthey had wished to retain any right for themselves, they ought to have taken\nprecautions for its defence and preservation; as they have not done so,\nand indeed could not have done so without dividing and consequently ruining\nthe state, they placed themselves absolutely at the mercy of the sovereign\npower; and, therefore, having acted (as we have shown) as reason and\nnecessity demanded, they are obliged to fulfil the commands of the sovereign\npower, however absurd these may be, else they will be public enemies, and\nwill act against reason, which urges the preservation of the state as a\nprimary duty. (49) For reason bids us choose the least of two evils.\n(16:50) Furthermore, this danger of submitting absolutely to the dominion\nand will of another, is one which may be incurred with a light heart: for we\nhave shown that sovereigns only possess this right of imposing their will,\nso long as they have the full power to enforce it: if such power be lost\ntheir right to command is lost also, or lapses to those who have assumed it\nand can keep it. (51) Thus it is very rare for sovereigns to impose\nthoroughly irrational commands, for they are bound to consult their own\ninterests, and retain their power by consulting the public good and\nacting according to the dictates of reason, as Seneca says, \"violenta\nimperia nemo continuit diu.\" (52) No one can long retain a tyrant's sway.\n(16:53) In a democracy, irrational commands are still less to be feared: for\nit is almost impossible that the majority of a people, especially if it be a\nlarge one, should agree in an irrational design: and, moreover, the basis\nand aim of a democracy is to avoid the desires as irrational, and to bring\nmen as far as possible under the control of reason, so that they may live in\npeace and harmony: if this basis be removed the whole fabric falls to ruin.\n(16:54) Such being the ends in view for the sovereign power, the duty of\nsubjects is, as I have said, to obey its commands, and to recognize no right\nsave that which it sanctions.\n[16:4] (55) It will, perhaps, be thought that we are turning subjects into\nslaves: for slaves obey commands and free men live as they like; but this\nidea is based on a misconception, for the true slave is he who is led away\nby his pleasures and can neither see what is good for him nor act\naccordingly: he alone is free who lives with free consent under the entire\nguidance of reason.\n(16:56) Action in obedience to orders does take away freedom in a certain\nsense, but it does not, therefore, make a man a slave, all depends on the\nobject of the action. (57) If the object of the action be the good of the\nstate, and not the good of the agent, the latter is a slave and does\nhimself no good: but in a state or kingdom where the weal of the whole\npeople, and not that of the ruler, is the supreme law, obedience to the\nsovereign power does not make a man a slave, of no use to himself, but a\nsubject. (58) Therefore, that state is the freest whose laws are founded on\nsound reason, so that every member of it may, if he will, be free [Endnote\n27]; that is, live with full consent under the entire guidance of reason.\n(16:59) Children, though they are bound to obey all the commands of their\nparents, are yet not slaves: for the commands of parents look generally to\nthe children's benefit.\n(60) We must, therefore, acknowledge a great difference between a slave, a\nson, and a subject; their positions may be thus defined. (61) A slave is one\nwho is bound to obey his master's orders, though they are given solely in\nthe master's interest: a son is one who obeys his father's orders, given\nin his own interest; a subject obeys the orders of the sovereign power,\ngiven for the common interest, wherein he is included.\n(16:62) I think I have now shown sufficiently clearly the basis of a\ndemocracy: I have especially desired to do so, for I believe it to be of all\nforms of government the most natural, and the most consonant with individual\nliberty. (63) In it no one transfers his natural right so absolutely that he\nhas no further voice in affairs, he only hands it over to the majority of a\nsociety, whereof he is a unit. Thus all men remain as they were in the state\nof nature, equals.\n(16:64) This is the only form of government which I have treated of at\nlength, for it is the one most akin to my purpose of showing the benefits of\nfreedom in a state.\n(65) I may pass over the fundamental principles of other forms of\ngovernment, for we may gather from what has been said whence their right\narises without going into its origin. (66) The possessor of sovereign power,\nwhether he be one, or many, or the whole body politic, has the sovereign\nright of imposing any commands he pleases: and he who has either\nvoluntarily, or under compulsion, transferred the right to defend him to\nanother, has, in so doing, renounced his natural right and is therefore\nbound to obey, in all things, the commands of the sovereign power; and will\nbe bound so to do so long as the king, or nobles, or the people preserve the\nsovereign power which formed the basis of the original transfer. (67) I need\nadd no more.\n[16:5] (68) The bases and rights of dominion being thus displayed, we shall\nreadily be able to define private civil right, wrong, justice, and\ninjustice, with their relations to the state; and also to determine what\nconstitutes an ally, or an enemy, or the crime of treason.\n(16:69) By private civil right we can only mean the liberty every man\npossesses to preserve his existence, a liberty limited by the edicts of the\nsovereign power, and preserved only by its authority: for when a man has\ntransferred to another his right of living as he likes, which was only\nlimited by his power, that is, has transferred his liberty and power of\nself-defence, he is bound to live as that other dictates, and to trust to\nhim entirely for his defence. (70) Wrong takes place when a citizen, or\nsubject, is forced by another to undergo some loss or pain in contradiction\nto the authority of the law, or the edict of the sovereign power.\n(16:71) Wrong is conceivable only in an organized community: nor can it ever\naccrue to subjects from any act of the sovereign, who has the right to do\nwhat he likes. (72) It can only arise, therefore, between private persons,\nwho are bound by law and right not to injure one another. (73) Justice\nconsists in the habitual rendering to every man his lawful due: injustice\nconsists in depriving a man, under the pretence of legality, of what the\nlaws, rightly interpreted, would allow him. (74) These last are also called\nequity and iniquity, because those who administer the laws are bound to show\nno respect of persons, but to account all men equal, and to defend every\nman's right equally, neither envying the rich nor despising the poor.\n[16:6](75) The men of two states become allies, when for the sake of\navoiding war, or for some other advantage, they covenant to do each other no\nhurt, but on the contrary, to assist each other if necessity arises, each\nretaining his independence. (76) Such a covenant is valid so long as its\nbasis of danger or advantage is in force: no one enters into an engagement,\nor is bound to stand by his compacts unless there be a hope of some accruing\ngood, or the fear of some evil: if this basis be removed the compact thereby\nbecomes void: this has been abundantly shown by experience. (77) For\nalthough different states make treaties not to harm one another, they always\ntake every possible precaution against such treaties being broken by the\nstronger party, and do not rely on the compact, unless there is a\nsufficiently obvious object and advantage to both parties in observing it.\n(78) Otherwise they would fear a breach of faith, nor would there be any\nwrong done thereby: for who in his proper senses, and aware of the right of\nthe sovereign power, would trust in the promises of one who has the will and\nthe power to do what he likes, and who aims solely at the safety and\nadvantage of his dominion? (79) Moreover, if we consult loyalty and\nreligion, we shall see that no one in possession of power ought to abide by\nhis promises to the injury of his dominion; for he cannot keep such promises\nwithout breaking the engagement he made with his subjects, by which both he\nand they are most solemnly bound. (80) An enemy is one who lives apart from\nthe state, and does not recognize its authority either as a subject or as an\nally. It is not hatred which makes a man an enemy, but the rights of the\nstate. (81) The rights of the state are the same in regard to him who\ndoes not recognize by any compact the state authority, as they are against\nhim who has done the state an injury: it has the right to force him as best\nit can, either to submit, or to contract an alliance.\n[16:7] (82) Lastly, treason can only be committed by subjects, who by\ncompact, either tacit or expressed, have transferred all their rights to the\nstate: a subject is said to have committed this crime when he has attempted,\nfor whatever reason, to seize the sovereign power, or to place it in\ndifferent hands. (83) I say, has attempted, for if punishment were not to\novertake him till he had succeeded, it would often come too late, the\nsovereign rights would have been acquired or transferred already.\n(16:84) I also say, has attempted, for whatever reason, to seize the\nsovereign power, and I recognize no difference whether such an attempt\nshould be followed by public loss or public gain. (85) Whatever be his\nreason for acting, the crime is treason, and he is rightly condemned: in\nwar, everyone would admit the justice of his sentence. (86) If a man does\nnot keep to his post, but approaches the enemy without the knowledge of his\ncommander, whatever may be his motive, so long as he acts on his own motion,\neven if he advances with the design of defeating the enemy, he is rightly\nput to death, because he has violated his oath, and infringed the rights of\nhis commander. (87) That all citizens are equally bound by these rights in\ntime of peace, is not so generally recognized, but the reasons for obedience\nare in both cases identical. (88) The state must be preserved and directed\nby the sole authority of the sovereign, and such authority and right have\nbeen accorded by universal consent to him alone: if, therefore, anyone else\nattempts, without his consent, to execute any public enterprise, even though\nthe state might (as we said) reap benefit therefrom, such person has none\nthe less infringed the sovereign\u2019s right, and would be rightly punished for\ntreason.\n(16:89) In order that every scruple may be removed, we may now answer the\ninquiry, whether our former assertion that everyone who has not the\npractice of reason, may, in the state of nature, live by sovereign natural\nright, according to the laws of his desires, is not in direct opposition to\nthe law and right of God as revealed. (90) For as all men absolutely\n(whether they be less endowed with reason or more) are equally bound by the\nDivine command to love their neighbour as themselves, it may be said that\nthey cannot, without wrong, do injury to anyone, or live according to their\ndesires.\n(16:91) This objection, so far as the state of nature is concerned, can be\neasily answered, for the state of nature is, both in nature and in time,\nprior to religion. (92) No one knows by nature that he owes any obedience to\nGod [Endnote 28], nor can he attain thereto by any exercise of his reason,\nbut solely by revelation confirmed by signs. (93) Therefore, previous to\nrevelation, no one is bound by a Divine law and right of which he is\nnecessarily in ignorance. (94) The state of nature must by no means be\nconfounded with a state of religion, but must be conceived as without\neither religion or law, and consequently without sin or wrong: this is how\nwe have described it, and we are confirmed by the authority of Paul. (95) It\nis not only in respect of ignorance that we conceive the state of nature as\nprior to, and lacking the Divine revealed law and right; but in respect of\nfreedom also, wherewith all men are born endowed.\n(16:96) If men were naturally bound by the Divine law and right, or if the\nDivine law and right were a natural necessity, there would have been no need\nfor God to make a covenant with mankind, and to bind them thereto with an\noath and agreement.\n(16:97) We must, then, fully grant that the Divine law and right originated\nat the time when men by express covenant agreed to obey God in all things,\nand ceded, as it were, their natural freedom, transferring their rights to\nGod in the manner described in speaking of the formation of a state.\n(98) However, I will treat of these matters more at length presently.\n[16:8] (99) It may be insisted that sovereigns are as much bound by the\nDivine law as subjects: whereas we have asserted that they retain their\nnatural rights, and may do whatever they like.\n(16:100) In order to clear up the whole difficulty, which arises rather\nconcerning the natural right than the natural state, I maintain that\neveryone is bound, in the state of nature, to live according to Divine law,\nin the same way as he is bound to live according to the dictates of sound\nreason; namely, inasmuch as it is to his advantage, and necessary for his\nsalvation; but, if he will not so live, he may do otherwise at his own risk.\n(101) He is thus bound to live according to his own laws, not according to\nanyone else's, and to recognize no man as a judge, or as a superior in\nreligion. (102) Such, in my opinion, is the position of a sovereign, for he\nmay take advice from his fellow-men, but he is not bound to recognize any as\na judge, nor anyone besides himself as an arbitrator on any question of\nright, unless it be a prophet sent expressly by God and attesting his\nmission by indisputable signs. (103) Even then he does not recognize a man,\nbut God Himself as His judge.\n[16:9] (104) If a sovereign refuses to obey God as revealed in His law,\nhe does so at his own risk and loss, but without violating any civil or\nnatural right. (105) For the civil right is dependent on his own decree; and\nnatural right is dependent on the laws of nature, which latter are not\nadapted to religion, whose sole aim is the good of humanity, but to the\norder of nature - that is, to God's eternal decree unknown to us.\n(16:106) This truth seems to be adumbrated in a somewhat obscurer form by\nthose who maintain that men can sin against God's revelation, but not\nagainst the eternal decree by which He has ordained all things.\n(107) We may be asked, what should we do if the sovereign commands anything\ncontrary to religion, and the obedience which we have expressly vowed to\nGod? should we obey the Divine law or the human law? (108) I shall treat of\nthis question at length hereafter, and will therefore merely say now, that\nGod should be obeyed before all else, when we have a certain and\nindisputable revelation of His will: but men are very prone to error on\nreligious subjects, and, according to the diversity of their dispositions,\nare wont with considerable stir to put forward their own inventions, as\nexperience more than sufficiently attests, so that if no one were bound to\nobey the state in matters which, in his own opinion concern religion,\nthe rights of the state would be dependent on every man's judgment\nand passions. (109) No one would consider himself bound to obey laws framed\nagainst his faith or superstition; and on this pretext he might assume\nunbounded license. (110) In this way, the rights of the civil authorities\nwould be utterly set at nought, so that we must conclude that the sovereign\npower, which alone is bound both by Divine and natural right to preserve and\nguard the laws of the state, should have supreme authority for making any\nlaws about religion which it thinks fit; all are bound to obey its behests\non the subject in accordance with their promise which God bids them to keep.\n(16:111) However, if the sovereign power be heathen, we should either enter\ninto no engagements therewith, and yield up our lives sooner than transfer\nto it any of our rights; or, if the engagement be made, and our rights\ntransferred, we should (inasmuch as we should have ourselves transferred the\nright of defending ourselves and our religion) be bound to obey them, and to\nkeep our word: we might even rightly be bound so to do, except in those\ncases where God, by indisputable revelation, has promised His special aid\nagainst tyranny, or given us special exemption from obedience. (112) Thus we\nsee that, of all the Jews in Babylon, there were only three youths who were\ncertain of the help of God, and, therefore, refused to obey Nebuchadnezzar.\n(113) All the rest, with the sole exception of Daniel, who was beloved by\nthe king, were doubtless compelled by right to obey, perhaps thinking that\nthey had been delivered up by God into the hands of the king, and that the\nking had obtained and preserved his dominion by God's design. (114) On the\nother hand, Eleazar, before his country had utterly fallen, wished to give a\nproof of his constancy to his compatriots, in order that they might follow\nin his footsteps, and go to any lengths, rather than allow their right and\npower to be transferred to the Greeks, or brave any torture rather than\nswear allegiance to the heathen. (115) Instances are occurring every day in\nconfirmation of what I here advance. (116) The rulers of Christian\nkingdoms do not hesitate, with a view to strengthening their dominion, to\nmake treaties with Turks and heathen, and to give orders to their subjects\nwho settle among such peoples not to assume more freedom, either in\nthings secular or religious, than is set down in the treaty, or allowed by\nthe foreign government. (117) We may see this exemplified in the Dutch\ntreaty with the Japanese, which I have already mentioned.\n[17:0] CHAPTER XVII - IT IS SHOWN THAT NO ONE CAN, OR\nNEED, TRANSFER ALL HIS RIGHTS TO THE SOVEREIGN POWER.\nOF THE HEBREW REPUBLIC, AS IT WAS DURING THE LIFETIME\nOF MOSES, AND AFTER HIS DEATH, TILL THE FOUNDATION\nOF THE MONARCHY; AND   OF ITS EXCELLENCE. LASTLY, OF\nTHE CAUSES WHY THE THEOCRATIC REPUBLIC FELL, AND WHY\nIT COULD HARDLY HAVE CONTINUED WITHOUT DISSENSION.\n[17:1] (1) The theory put forward in the last chapter, of the universal\nrights of the sovereign power, and of the natural rights of the individual\ntransferred thereto, though it corresponds in many respects with actual\npractice, and though practice may be so arranged as to conform to it more\nand more, must nevertheless always remain in many respects purely ideal. (2)\nNo one can ever so utterly transfer to another his power and, consequently,\nhis rights, as to cease to be a man; nor can there ever be a power so\nsovereign that it can carry out every possible wish. (3) It will always be\nvain to order a subject to hate what he believes brings him advantage, or to\nlove what brings him loss, or not to be offended at insults, or not to wish\nto be free from fear, or a hundred other things of the sort, which\nnecessarily follow from the laws of human nature. (4) So much, I think, is\nabundantly shown by experience: for men have never so far ceded their power\nas to cease to be an object of fear to the rulers who received such power\nand right; and dominions have always been in as much danger from their own\nsubjects as from external enemies. (5) If it were really the case, that men\ncould be deprived of their natural rights so utterly as never to have any\nfurther influence on affairs [Endnote 29], except with the permission of the\nholders of sovereign right, it would then be possible to maintain with\nimpunity the most violent tyranny, which, I suppose, no one would for an\ninstant admit.\n(17:6) We must, therefore, grant that every man retains some part of his\nright, in dependence on his own decision, and no one else's.\n(7) However, in order correctly to understand the extent of the sovereign's\nright and power, we must take notice that it does not cover only those\nactions to which it can compel men by fear, but absolutely every action\nwhich it can induce men to perform: for it is the fact of obedience, not the\nmotive for obedience, which makes a man a subject.\n(17:8) Whatever be the cause which leads a man to obey the commands of the\nsovereign, whether it be fear or hope, or love of his country, or any other\nemotion - the fact remains that the man takes counsel with himself, and\nnevertheless acts as his sovereign orders. (9) We must not, therefore,\nassert that all actions resulting from a man's deliberation with himself are\ndone in obedience to the rights of the individual rather than the sovereign:\nas a matter of fact, all actions spring from a man's deliberation with\nhimself, whether the determining motive be love or fear of punishment;\ntherefore, either dominion does not exist, and has no rights over its\nsubjects, or else it extends over every instance in which it can prevail on\nmen to decide to obey it. (10) Consequently, every action which a subject\nperforms in accordance with the commands of the sovereign, whether such\naction springs from love, or fear, or (as is more frequently the case) from\nhope and fear together, or from reverence, compounded of fear and\nadmiration, or, indeed, any motive whatever, is performed in virtue of his\nsubmission to the sovereign, and not in virtue of his own authority.\n(17:11) This point is made still more clear by the fact that obedience does\nnot consist so much in the outward act as in the mental state of the person\nobeying; so that he is most under the dominion of another who with his whole\nheart determines to obey another's commands; and consequently the firmest\ndominion belongs to the sovereign who has most influence over the minds of\nhis subjects; if those who are most feared possessed the firmest dominion,\nthe firmest dominion would belong to the subjects of a tyrant, for they are\nalways greatly feared by their ruler. (12) Furthermore, though it is\nimpossible to govern the mind as completely as the tongue, nevertheless\nminds are, to a certain extent, under the control of the sovereign, for he\ncan in many ways bring about that the greatest part of his subjects should\nfollow his wishes in their beliefs, their loves, and their hates. (13)\nThough such emotions do not arise at the express command of the sovereign\nthey often result (as experience shows) from the authority of his power, and\nfrom his direction; in other words, in virtue of his right; we may,\ntherefore, without doing violence to our understanding, conceive men who\nfollow the instigation of their sovereign in their beliefs, their loves,\ntheir hates, their contempt, and all other emotions whatsoever.\n(17:14) Though the powers of government, as thus conceived, are sufficiently\nample, they can never become large enough to execute every possible wish of\ntheir possessors. (15) This, I think, I have already shown clearly enough.\n(16) The method of forming a dominion which should prove lasting I do not,\nas I have said, intend to discuss, but in order to arrive at the object I\nhave in view, I will touch on the teaching of Divine revelation to Moses in\nthis respect, and we will consider the history and the success of the Jews,\ngathering therefrom what should be the chief concessions made by sovereigns\nto their subjects with a view to the security and increase of their\ndominion.\n[17:2] (17) That the preservation of a state chiefly depends on the\nsubjects' fidelity and constancy in carrying out the orders they receive, is\nmost clearly taught both by reason and experience; how subjects ought to be\nguided so as best to preserve their fidelity and virtue is not so obvious.\n(18) All, both rulers and ruled, are men, and prone to follow after their\nlusts. (19) The fickle disposition of the multitude almost reduces those who\nhave experience of it to despair, for it is governed solely by emotions, not\nby reason: it rushes headlong into every enterprise, and is easily corrupted\neither by avarice or luxury: everyone thinks himself omniscient and wishes\nto fashion all things to his liking, judging a thing to be just or unjust,\nlawful or unlawful, according as he thinks it will bring him profit or loss:\nvanity leads him to despise his equals, and refuse their guidance: envy of\nsuperior fame or fortune (for such gifts are never equally distributed)\nleads him to desire and rejoice in his neighbour's downfall. (20) I need\nnot go through the whole list, everyone knows already how much crime\nresults from disgust at the present - desire for change, headlong anger,\nand contempt for poverty - and how men's minds are engrossed and kept\nin turmoil thereby.\n(17:21) To guard against all these evils, and form a dominion where no room\nis left for deceit; to frame our institutions so that every man, whatever\nhis disposition, may prefer public right to private advantage, this is the\ntask and this the toil. (22) Necessity is often the mother of invention, but\nshe has never yet succeeded in framing a dominion that was in less danger\nfrom its own citizens than from open enemies, or whose rulers did not fear\nthe latter less than the former. (23) Witness the state of Rome, invincible\nby her enemies, but many times conquered and sorely oppressed by her own\ncitizens, especially in the war between Vespasian and Vitellius. (24) (See\nTacitus, Hist. bk. iv. for a description of the pitiable state of the city.)\n(17:25) Alexander thought prestige abroad more easy to acquire than prestige\nat home, and believed that his greatness could be destroyed by his own\nfollowers. (26) Fearing such a disaster, he thus addressed his friends:\n\"Keep me safe from internal treachery and domestic plots, and I will front\nwithout fear the dangers of battle and of war. (27) Philip was more secure\nin the battle array than in the theatre: he often escaped from the hands of\nthe enemy, he could not escape from his own subjects. (28) If you think over\nthe deaths of kings, you will count up more who have died by the assassin\nthan by the open foe.\" (Q. Curtius, chap. vi.)\n(17:29) For the sake of making themselves secure, kings who seized the\nthrone in ancient times used to try to spread the idea that they were\ndescended from the immortal gods, thinking that if their subjects and the\nrest of mankind did not look on them as equals, but believed them to be\ngods, they would willingly submit to their rule, and obey their commands.\n(30) Thus Augustus persuaded the Romans that he was descended from \u00c6neas,\nwho was the son of Venus, and numbered among the gods. (31) \"He wished\nhimself to be worshipped in temples, like the gods, with flamens and\npriests.\" (Tacitus, Ann. i. 10.)\n(17:32) Alexander wished to be saluted as the son of Jupiter, not from\nmotives of pride but of policy, as he showed by his answer to the invective\nof Hermolaus: \"It is almost laughable,\" said he, \"that Hermolaus asked me to\ncontradict Jupiter, by whose oracle I am recognized. (33) Am I responsible\nfor the answers of the gods? (34) It offered me the name of son;\nacquiescence was by no means foreign to my present designs. (35) Would that\nthe Indians also would believe me to be a god! (36) Wars are carried through\nby prestige, falsehoods that are believed often gain the force of truth.\"\n(Curtius, viii,. Para. 8.) (37) In these few words he cleverly contrives to\npalm off a fiction on the ignorant, and at the same time hints at the motive\nfor the deception.\n(17:38) Cleon, in his speech persuading the Macedonians to obey their king,\nadopted a similar device: for after going through the praises of Alexander\nwith admiration, and recalling his merits, he proceeds, \"the Persians are\nnot only pious, but prudent in worshipping their kings as gods: for kingship\nis the shield of public safety,\" and he ends thus, \"I, myself, when the king\nenters a banquet hall, should prostrate my body on the ground; other men\nshould do the like, especially those who are wise\" (Curtius, viii.\nPara. 66). (39) However, the Macedonians were more prudent - indeed, it is\nonly complete barbarians who can be so openly cajoled, and can suffer\nthemselves to be turned from subjects into slaves without interests of their\nown. (40) Others, notwithstanding, have been able more easily to spread the\nbelief that kingship is sacred, and plays the part of God on the earth, that\nit has been instituted by God, not by the suffrage and consent of men; and\nthat it is preserved and guarded by Divine special providence and aid.\n(41) Similar fictions have been promulgated by monarchs, with the object of\nstrengthening their dominion, but these I will pass over, and in order to\narrive at my main purpose, will merely recall and discuss the teaching on\nthe subject of Divine revelation to Moses in ancient times.\n[17:3] (42) We have said in Chap. V. that after the Hebrews came up out of\nEgypt they were not bound by the law and right of any other nation, but were\nat liberty to institute any new rites at their pleasure, and to occupy\nwhatever territory they chose. (43) After their liberation from the\nintolerable bondage of the Egyptians, they were bound by no covenant to any\nman; and, therefore, every man entered into his natural right, and was free\nto retain it or to give it up, and transfer it to another. (44) Being, then,\nin the state of nature, they followed the advice of Moses, in whom they\nchiefly trusted, and decided to transfer their right to no human being, but\nonly to God; without further delay they all, with one voice, promised to\nobey all the commands of the Deity, and to acknowledge no right that He did\nnot proclaim as such by prophetic revelation. (45) This promise, or\ntransference of right to God, was effected in the same manner as we have\nconceived it to have been in ordinary societies, when men agree to divest\nthemselves of their natural rights. (46) It is, in fact, in virtue of a set\ncovenant, and an oath (see Exod. xxxiv:10), that the Jews freely, and not\nunder compulsion or threats, surrendered their rights and transferred them\nto God. (47) Moreover, in order that this covenant might be ratified\nand settled, and might be free from all suspicion of deceit, God did not\nenter into it till the Jews had had experience of His wonderful power by\nwhich alone they had been, or could be, preserved in a state of prosperity\n(Exod. xix:4, 5). (48) It is because they believed that nothing but\nGod's power could preserve them that they surrendered to God the natural\npower of self-preservation, which they formerly, perhaps, thought they\npossessed, and consequently they surrendered at the same time all their\nnatural right.\n[17:4] (49) God alone, therefore, held dominion over the Hebrews, whose state\nwas in virtue of the covenant called God's kingdom, and God was said to be\ntheir king; consequently the enemies of the Jews were said to be the enemies of\nGod, and the citizens who tried to seize the dominion were guilty of treason\nagainst God; and, lastly, the laws of the state were called the laws and\ncommandments of God. (50) Thus in the Hebrew state the civil and religious\nauthority, each consisting solely of obedience to God, were one and the same.\n(51) The dogmas of religion were not precepts, but laws and ordinances; piety\nwas regarded as the same as loyalty, impiety as the same as disaffection. (52)\nEveryone who fell away from religion ceased to be a citizen, and was, on that\nground alone, accounted an enemy: those who died for the sake of religion, were\nheld to have died for their country; in fact, between civil and religious law\nand right there was no distinction whatever. (53) For this reason the\ngovernment could be called a Theocracy, inasmuch as the citizens were not bound\nby anything save the revelations of God.\n(17:54) However, this state of things existed rather in theory than in\npractice, for it will appear from what we are about to say, that the\nHebrews, as a matter of fact, retained absolutely in their own hands the\nright of sovereignty: this is shown by the method and plan by which the\ngovernment was carried on, as I will now explain.\n(17:55) Inasmuch as the Hebrews did not transfer their rights to any other\nperson but, as in a democracy, all surrendered their rights equally, and\ncried out with one voice, \"Whatsoever God shall speak (no mediator or\nmouthpiece being named) that will we do,\" it follows that all were equally\nbound by the covenant, and that all had an equal right to consult the Deity,\nto accept and to interpret His laws, so that all had an exactly equal share\nin the government. [17:5] (56) Thus at first they all approached God\ntogether, so that they might learn His commands, but in this first\nsalutation, they were so thoroughly terrified and so astounded to hear God\nspeaking, that they thought their last hour was at hand: full of fear,\ntherefore, they went afresh to Moses, and said, \"Lo, we have heard God\nspeaking in the fire, and there is no cause why we should wish to die:\nsurely this great fire will consume us: if we hear again the voice of God,\nwe shall surely die. (57) Thou, therefore, go near, and hear all the words\nof our God, and thou (not God) shalt speak with us: all that God shall tell\nus, that will we hearken to and perform.\"\n(17:58) They thus clearly abrogated their former covenant, and absolutely\ntransferred to Moses their right to consult God and interpret His commands:\nfor they do not here promise obedience to all that God shall tell them, but\nto all that God shall tell Moses (see Deut. v:20 after the Decalogue, and\nchap. xviii:15, 16). (59) Moses, therefore, remained the sole promulgator\nand interpreter of the Divine laws, and consequently also the sovereign\njudge, who could not be arraigned himself, and who acted among the Hebrews\nthe part of God; in other words, held the sovereign kingship: he alone\nhad the right to consult God, to give the Divine answers to the\npeople, and to see that they were carried out. (60) I say he alone, for if\nanyone during the life of Moses was desirous of preaching anything in the\nname of the Lord, he was, even if a true prophet, considered guilty and a\nusurper of the sovereign right (Numb. xi:28) [Endnote 30]. (61) We may here\nnotice, that though the people had elected Moses, they could not rightfully\nelect Moses's successor; for having transferred to Moses their right of\nconsulting God, and absolutely promised to regard him as a Divine oracle,\nthey had plainly forfeited the whole of their right, and were bound to\naccept as chosen by God anyone proclaimed by Moses as his successor. (62) If\nMoses had so chosen his successor, who like him should wield the sole right\nof government, possessing the sole right of consulting God, and consequently\nof making and abrogating laws, of deciding on peace or war, of sending\nambassadors, appointing judges - in fact, discharging all the functions of a\nsovereign, the state would have become simply a monarchy, only differing\nfrom other monarchies in the fact, that the latter are, or should be,\ncarried on in accordance with God's decree, unknown even to the monarch,\nwhereas the Hebrew monarch would have been the only person to whom the\ndecree was revealed. (63) A difference which increases, rather than\ndiminishes the monarch's authority. (64) As far as the people in both cases\nare concerned, each would be equally subject, and equally ignorant of\nthe Divine decree, for each would be dependent on the monarch's words, and\nwould learn from him alone, what was lawful or unlawful: nor would the fact\nthat the people believed that the monarch was only issuing commands in\naccordance with God's decree revealed to him, make it less in subjection,\nbut rather more. [17:6] (65) However, Moses elected no such successor, but\nleft the dominion to those who came after him in a condition which could not\nbe called a popular government, nor an aristocracy, nor a monarchy, but a\nTheocracy. (66) For the right of interpreting laws was vested in one man,\nwhile the right and power of administering the state according to the\nlaws thus interpreted, was vested in another man (see Numb. xxvii:21)\n[Endnote 31].\n(17:67) In order that the question may be thoroughly understood, I will duly\nset forth the administration of the whole state.\n(68) First, the people were commanded to build a tabernacle, which should\nbe, as it were, the dwelling of God - that is, of the sovereign authority of\nthe state. (69) This tabernacle was to be erected at the cost of the whole\npeople, not of one man, in order that the place where God was consulted\nmight be public property. (70) The Levites were chosen as courtiers and\nadministrators of this royal abode; while Aaron, the brother of Moses, was\nchosen to be their chief and second, as it were, to God their King, being\nsucceeded in the office by his legitimate sons.\n(17:71) He, as the nearest to God, was the sovereign interpreter of the\nDivine laws; he communicated the answers of the Divine oracle to the people,\nand entreated God's favour for them. (72) If, in addition to these\nprivileges, he had possessed the right of ruling, he would have been neither\nmore nor less than an absolute monarch; but, in respect to government, he\nwas only a private citizen: the whole tribe of Levi was so completely\ndivested of governing rights that it did not even take its share with the\nothers in the partition of territory. (73) Moses provided for its support by\ninspiring the common people with great reverence for it, as the only tribe\ndedicated to God.\n(17:74) Further, the army, formed from the remaining twelve tribes, was\ncommanded to invade the land of Canaan, to divide it into twelve portions,\nand to distribute it among the tribes by lot. (75) For this task twelve\ncaptains were chosen, one from every tribe, and were, together with\nJoshua and Eleazar, the high priest, empowered to divide the land into\ntwelve equal parts, and distribute it by lot. (76) Joshua was chosen for the\nchief command of the army, inasmuch as none but he had the right to consult\nGod in emergencies, not like Moses, alone in his tent, or in the\ntabernacle, but through the high priest, to whom only the answers of God\nwere revealed. (77) Furthermore, he was empowered to execute, and cause the\npeople to obey God's commands, transmitted through the high priests; to\nfind, and to make use of, means for carrying them out; to choose as many\narmy captains as he liked; to make whatever choice he thought best; to\nsend ambassadors in his own name; and, in short, to have the entire control\nof the war. (78) To his office there was no rightful successor - indeed, the\npost was only filled by the direct order of the Deity, on occasions of\npublic emergency. (79) In ordinary times, all the management of peace and\nwar was vested in the captains of the tribes, as I will shortly point out.\n(80) Lastly, all men between the ages of twenty and sixty were ordered to\nbear arms, and form a citizen army, owing allegiance, not to its\ngeneral-in-chief, nor to the high priest, but to Religion and to God.\n(81) The army, or the hosts, were called the army of God, or the hosts of\nGod. (82) For this reason God was called by the Hebrews the God of Armies;\nand the ark of the covenant was borne in the midst of the army in important\nbattles, when the safety or destruction of the whole people hung upon the\nissue, so that the people might, as it were, see their King among them,\nand put forth all their strength.\n(17:83) From these directions, left by Moses to his successors, we plainly\nsee that he chose administrators, rather than despots, to come after him;\nfor he invested no one with the power of consulting God, where he liked and\nalone, consequently, no one had the power possessed by himself of ordaining\nand abrogating laws, of deciding on war or peace, of choosing men to fill\noffices both religious and secular: all these are the prerogatives of a\nsovereign. (84) The high priest, indeed, had the right of interpreting laws,\nand communicating the answers of God, but he could not do so when he liked,\nas Moses could, but only when he was asked by the general-in-chief of the\narmy, the council, or some similar authority. (85) The general-in-chief and\nthe council could consult God when they liked, but could only receive His\nanswers through the high priest; so that the utterances of God, as reported\nby the high priest, were not decrees, as they were when reported by Moses,\nbut only answers; they were accepted by Joshua and the council, and only\nthen had the force of commands and decrees.\n(17:86) The high priest, both in the case of Aaron and of his son Eleazar,\nwas chosen by Moses; nor had anyone, after Moses' death, a right to elect to\nthe office, which became hereditary. (87) The general-in-chief of the army\nwas also chosen by Moses, and assumed his functions in virtue of the\ncommands, not of the high priest, but of Moses: indeed, after the death of\nJoshua, the high priest did not appoint anyone in his place, and the\ncaptains did not consult God afresh about a general-in-chief, but each\nretained Joshua's power in respect to the contingent of his own tribe,\nand all retained it collectively, in respect to the whole army. (88) There\nseems to have been no need of a general-in-chief, except when they were\nobliged to unite their forces against a common enemy. (89) This occurred\nmost frequently during the time of Joshua, when they had no fixed dwelling.\nplace, and possessed all things in common. [17:7] (90) After all the tribes\nhad gained their territories by right of conquest, and had divided their\nallotted gains, they, became separated, having no longer their possessions\nin common, so that the need for a single commander ceased, for the\ndifferent tribes should be considered rather in the light of confederated\nstates than of bodies of fellow-citizens. (91) In respect to their God and\ntheir religion, they, were fellow-citizens; but, in respect to the rights\nwhich one possessed with regard to another, they were only confederated:\nthey, were, in fact, in much the same position (if one excepts the Temple\ncommon to all) as the United States of the Netherlands {or United States of\nAmerica}. (92) The division of property held in common is only another\nphrase for the possession of his share by each of the owners singly, and the\nsurrender by the others of their rights over such share. (93) This is why\nMoses elected captains of the tribes - namely, that when the dominion was\ndivided, each might take care of his own part; consulting God through the\nhigh priest on the affairs of his tribe, ruling over his army, building and\nfortifying cities, appointing judges, attacking the enemies of his own\ndominion, and having complete control over all civil and military affairs.\n(94) He was not bound to acknowledge any superior judge save God\n[Endnote 32], or a prophet whom God should expressly send. (95) If he\ndeparted from the worship of God, the rest of the tribes did not arraign him\nas a subject, but attacked him as an enemy. (95) Of this we have examples in\nScripture. (96) When Joshua was dead, the children of Israel (not a fresh\ngeneral-in-chief) consulted God; it being decided that the tribe of Judah\nshould be the first to attack its enemies, the tribe in question contracted\na single alliance with the tribe of Simeon, for uniting their forces, and\nattacking their common enemy, the rest of the tribes not being included in\nthe alliance (Judges i:1, 2, 3). (97) Each tribe separately made war against\nits own enemies, and, according to its pleasure, received them as subjects\nor allies, though it had been commanded not to spare them on any conditions,\nbut to destroy them utterly. (98) Such disobedience met with reproof from\nthe rest of the tribes, but did not cause the offending tribe to be\narraigned: it was not considered a sufficient reason for proclaiming a civil\nwar, or interfering in one another's affairs. (99) But when the tribe of\nBenjamin offended against the others, and so loosened the bonds of peace\nthat none of the confederated tribes could find refuge within its borders,\nthey attacked it as an enemy, and gaining the victory over it after three\nbattles, put to death both guilty and innocent, according to the laws of\nwar: an act which they subsequently bewailed with tardy repentance.\n(17:100) These examples plainly confirm what we have said concerning the\nrights of each tribe. (101) Perhaps we shall be asked who elected the\nsuccessors to the captains of each tribe; on this point I can gather no\npositive information in Scripture, but I conjecture that as the tribes were\ndivided into families, each headed by its senior member, the senior of all\nthese heads of families succeeded by right to the office of captain, for\nMoses chose from among these seniors his seventy coadjutors, who formed with\nhimself the supreme council. (102) Those who administered the government\nafter the death of Joshua were called elders, and elder is a very common\nHebrew expression in the sense of judge, as I suppose everyone knows;\nhowever, it is not very important for us to make up our minds on this point.\n(103) It is enough to have shown that after the death of Moses no one man\nwielded all the power of a sovereign; as affairs were not all managed by one\nman, nor by a single council, nor by the popular vote, but partly by one\ntribe, partly by the rest in equal shares, it is most evident that the\ngovernment, after the death of Moses, was neither monarchic, nor\naristocratic, nor popular, but, as we have said, Theocratic.\n(104) The reasons for applying this name are:\n(17:105) I. Because the royal seat of government was the Temple, and in\nrespect to it alone, as we have shown, all the tribes were fellow-citizens.\n(106) II. Because all the people owed allegiance to God, their supreme\nJudge, to whom only they had promised implicit obedience in all things.\n(17:107) III. Because the general-in-chief or dictator, when there was need\nof such, was elected by none save God alone. (108) This was expressly\ncommanded by Moses in the name of God (Deut. xix:15), and witnessed by the\nactual choice of Gideon, of Samson, and of Samuel; wherefrom we may conclude\nthat the other faithful leaders were chosen in the same manner, though it is\nnot expressly told us.\n(17:109) These preliminaries being stated, it is now time to inquire the\neffects of forming a dominion on this plan, and to see whether it so\neffectually kept within bounds both rulers and ruled, that the former were\nnever tyrannical and the latter never rebellious.\n(17:110) Those who administer or possess governing power, always try to\nsurround their high-handed actions with a cloak of legality, and to persuade\nthe people that they act from good motives; this they are easily able to\neffect when they are the sole interpreters of the law; for it is evident\nthat they are thus able to assume a far greater freedom to carry out their\nwishes and desires than if the interpretation if the law is vested in\nsomeone else, or if the laws were so self-evident that no one could be in\ndoubt as to their meaning. [17:8] (111) We thus see that the power of\nevil-doing was greatly curtailed for the Hebrew captains by the fact that the\nwhole interpretation of the law was vested in the Levites (Deut. xxi:5),\nwho, on their part, had no share in the government, and depended for all\ntheir support and consideration on a correct interpretation of the laws\nentrusted to them. (112) Moreover, the whole people was commanded to come\ntogether at a certain place every seven years and be instructed in the law\nby the high-priest; further, each individual was bidden to read the book of\nthe law through and through continually with scrupulous care. (Deut. xxxi:9,\n10, and vi:7.)\n(113) The captains were thus for their own sakes bound to take great care to\nadminister everything according to the laws laid down, and well known to all,\nif they wished to be held in high honour by the people, who would regard them\nas the administrators of God's dominion, and as God's vicegerents; otherwise\nthey could not have escaped all the virulence of theological hatred. (114)\nThere was another very important check on the unbridled license of the\ncaptains, in the fact, that the army was formed from the whole body, of the\ncitizens, between the ages of twenty and sixty, without exception, and that the\ncaptains were not able to hire any foreign soldiery. (115) This I say was very\nimportant, for it is well known that princes can oppress their peoples with the\nsingle aid of the soldiery in their pay; while there is nothing more formidable\nto them than the freedom of citizen soldiers, who have established the freedom\nand glory of their country, by their valour, their toil, and their blood. (116)\nThus Alexander, when he was about to make wax on Darius, a second time, after\nhearing the advice of Parmenio, did not chide him who gave the advice, but\nPolysperchon, who was standing by. (117) For, as Curtius says (iv. Para. 13),\nhe did not venture to reproach Parmenio again after having shortly before\nreproved him too sharply. (118) This freedom of the Macedonians, which he so\ndreaded, he was not able to subdue till after the number of captives enlisted\nin the army surpassed that of his own people: then, but not till then, he gave\nrein to his anger so long checked by the independence of his chief\nfellow-countrymen.\n(17:119) If this independence of citizen soldiers can restrain the princes\nof ordinary states who are wont to usurp the whole glory of victories, it\nmust have been still more effectual against the Hebrew captains, whose\nsoldiers were fighting, not for the glory of a prince, but for the glory of\nGod, and who did not go forth to battle till the Divine assent had been\ngiven.\n(17:120) We must also remember that the Hebrew captains were associated only\nby the bonds of religion: therefore, if any one of them had transgressed,\nand begun to violate the Divine right, he might have been treated by the\nrest as an enemy and lawfully subdued.\n(17:121) An additional check may be found in the fear of a new prophet\narising, for if a man of unblemished life could show by certain signs that\nhe was really a prophet, he ipso facto obtained the sovereign right to rule,\nwhich was given to him, as to Moses formerly, in the name of God, as\nrevealed to himself alone; not merely through the high priest, as in the\ncase of the captains. (122) There is no doubt that such an one would easily\nbe able to enlist an oppressed people in his cause, and by trifling signs\npersuade them of anything he wished: on the other hand, if affairs were well\nordered, the captain would be able to make provision in time; that the\nprophet should be submitted to his approval, and be examined whether he were\nreally of unblemished life, and possessed indisputable signs of his mission:\nalso, whether the teaching he proposed to set forth in the name of the Lord\nagreed with received doctrines, and the general laws of the country; if his\ncredentials were insufficient, or his doctrines new, he could lawfully be\nput to death, or else received on the captain's sole responsibility and\nauthority.\n(17:123) Again, the captains were not superior to the others in nobility or\nbirth, but only administered the government in virtue of their age and\npersonal qualities. (124) Lastly, neither captains nor army had any reason\nfor preferring war to peace. (125) The army, as we have stated, consisted\nentirely of citizens, so that affairs were managed by the same persons both\nin peace and war. (126) The man who was a soldier in the camp was a citizen\nin the market-place, he who was a leader in the camp was a judge in the law\ncourts, he who was a general in the camp was a ruler in the state. (127)\nThus no one could desire war for its own sake, but only for the sake of\npreserving peace and liberty; possibly the captains avoided change as far as\npossible, so as not to be obliged to consult the high priest and submit to\nthe indignity of standing in his presence.\n(17:128) So much for the precautions for keeping the captains within bounds.\n[17:9] (129) We must now look for the restraints upon the people: these,\nhowever, are very clearly indicated in the very groundwork of the social\nfabric.\n(17:130) Anyone who gives the subject the slightest attention, will see that\nthe state was so ordered as to inspire the most ardent patriotism in the\nhearts of the citizens, so that the latter would be very hard to persuade to\nbetray their country, and be ready to endure anything rather than\nsubmit to a foreign yoke. (131) After they had transferred their right\nto God, they thought that their kingdom belonged to God, and that they\nthemselves were God's children. (132) Other nations they looked upon as\nGod's enemies, and regarded with intense hatred (which they took\nto be piety, see Psalm cxxxix:21, 22): nothing would have been more\nabhorrent to them than swearing allegiance to a foreigner, and promising him\nobedience: nor could they conceive any greater or more execrable crime than\nthe betrayal of their country, the kingdom of the God whom they adored.\n(17:133) It was considered wicked for anyone to settle outside of the\ncountry, inasmuch as the worship of God by which they were bound could not\nbe carried on elsewhere: their own land alone was considered holy, the rest\nof the earth unclean and profane.\n(17:134) David, who was forced to live in exile, complained before Saul as\nfollows: \"But if they be the children of men who have stirred thee up\nagainst me, cursed be they before the Lord; for they have driven me out this\nday from abiding in the inheritance of the Lord, saying, Go, serve other\ngods.\" (I Sam. xxvi:19.) (135) For the same reason no citizen, as we should\nespecially remark, was ever sent into exile: he who sinned was liable to\npunishment, but not to disgrace.\n(17:136) Thus the love of the Hebrews for their country was not only\npatriotism, but also piety, and was cherished and nurtured by daily rites\ntill, like their hatred of other nations, it must have passed into their\nnature. (137) Their daily worship was not only different from that of other\nnations (as it might well be, considering that they were a peculiar people\nand entirely apart from the rest), it was absolutely contrary. (138) Such\ndaily reprobation naturally gave rise to a lasting hatred, deeply implanted\nin the heart: for of all hatreds none is more deep and tenacious than\nthat which springs from extreme devoutness or piety, and is itself cherished\nas pious. (139) Nor was a general cause lacking for inflaming such hatred\nmore and more, inasmuch as it was reciprocated; the surrounding nations\nregarding the Jews with a hatred just as intense.\n(17:140) How great was the effect of all these causes, namely, freedom from\nman's dominion; devotion to their country; absolute rights over all\nother men; a hatred not only permitted but pious; a contempt for their\nfellow-men; the singularity of their customs and religious rites; the\neffect, I repeat, of all these causes in strengthening the hearts of the\nJews to bear all things for their country, with extraordinary constancy and\nvalour, will at once be discerned by reason and attested by experience.\n(141) Never, so long as the city was standing, could they endure to remain\nunder foreign dominion; and therefore they called Jerusalem \"a rebellious\ncity\" (Ezra iv:12). (142) Their state after its reestablishment (which was a\nmere shadow of the first, for the high priests had usurped the rights of the\ntribal captains) was, with great difficulty, destroyed by the Romans, as\nTacitus bears witness (Hist. ii:4):- \"Vespasian had closed the war against\nthe Jews, abandoning the siege of Jerusalem as an enterprise difficult\nand arduous rather from the character of the people and the obstinacy of\ntheir superstition, than from the strength left to the besieged for meeting\ntheir necessities.\" (143) But besides these characteristics, which are\nmerely ascribed by an individual opinion, there was one feature\npeculiar to this state and of great importance in retaining the affections\nof the citizens, and checking all thoughts of desertion, or abandonment of\nthe country: namely, self-interest, the strength and life of all human\naction. (144) This was peculiarly engaged in the Hebrew state, for\nnowhere else did citizens possess their goods so securely, as did the\nsubjects of this community, for the latter possessed as large a share in the\nland and the fields as did their chiefs, and were owners of their plots of\nground in perpetuity; for if any man was compelled by poverty to sell his\nfarm or his pasture, he received it back again intact at the year of\njubilee: there were other similar enactments against the possibility of\nalienating real property.\n(17:145) Again, poverty was nowhere more endurable than in a country where\nduty towards one's neighbour, that is, one's fellow-citizen, was practised\nwith the utmost piety, as a means of gaining the favour of God the King.\n(146) Thus the Hebrew citizens would nowhere be so well off as in their own\ncountry; outside its limits they met with nothing but loss and disgrace.\n(17:147) The following considerations were of weight, not only in keeping\nthem at home, but also in preventing civil war and removing causes of\nstrife; no one was bound to serve his equal, but only to serve God, while\ncharity and love towards fellow-citizens was accounted the highest piety;\nthis last feeling was not a little fostered by the general hatred with which\nthey regarded foreign nations and were regarded by them. (148) Furthermore,\nthe strict discipline of obedience in which they were brought up, was a very\nimportant factor; for they were bound to carry on all their actions\naccording to the set rules of the law: a man might not plough when he liked,\nbut only at certain times, in certain years, and with one sort of beast at a\ntime; so, too, he might only sow and reap in a certain method and season -\nin fact, his whole life was one long school of obedience (see Chap. V. on\nthe use of ceremonies); such a habit was thus engendered, that conformity\nseemed freedom instead of servitude, and men desired what was commanded\nrather than what was forbidden. (149) This result was not a little aided by\nthe fact that the people were bound, at certain seasons of the year, to give\nthemselves up to rest and rejoicing, not for their own pleasure, but in\norder that they might worship God cheerfully.\n(17:150) Three times in the year they feasted before the Lord; on the\nseventh day of every week they were bidden to abstain from all work and to\nrest; besides these, there were other occasions when innocent rejoicing and\nfeasting were not only allowed but enjoined. (151) I do not think any better\nmeans of influencing men's minds could be devised; for there is no more\npowerful attraction than joy springing from devotion, a mixture of\nadmiration and love. (152) It was not easy to be wearied by constant\nrepetition, for the rites on the various festivals were varied and recurred\nseldom. (153) We may add the deep reverence for the Temple which all most\nreligiously fostered, on account of the peculiar rites and duties that they\nwere obliged to perform before approaching thither. (154) Even now, Jews\ncannot read without horror of the crime of Manasseh, who dared to place an\nidol in the Temple. (155) The laws, scrupulously preserved in the inmost\nsanctuary, were objects of equal reverence to the people. (156) Popular\nreports and misconceptions were, therefore, very little to be feared\nin this quarter, for no one dared decide on sacred matters, but all\nfelt bound to obey, without consulting their reason, all the commands given\nby the answers of God received in the Temple, and all the laws which God\nhad ordained.\n(17:157) I think I have now explained clearly, though briefly, the main\nfeatures of the Hebrew commonwealth. (158) I must now inquire into the\ncauses which led the people so often to fall away from the law, which\nbrought about their frequent subjection, and, finally, the complete\ndestruction of their dominion. (159) Perhaps I shall be told that it sprang\nfrom their hardness of heart; but this is childish, for why should this\npeople be more hard of heart than others; was it by nature?\n[17:A] (160) But nature forms individuals, not peoples; the latter are\nonly distinguishable by the difference of their language, their customs, and\ntheir laws; while from the two last - i.e., customs and laws, - it may arise\nthat they have a peculiar disposition, a peculiar manner of life, and\npeculiar prejudices. (161) If, then, the Hebrews were harder of heart than\nother nations, the fault lay with their laws or customs.\n(17:162) This is certainly true, in the sense that, if God had wished their\ndominion to be more lasting, He would have given them other rites and laws,\nand would have instituted a different form of government. (163) We can,\ntherefore, only say that their God was angry with them, not only, as\nJeremiah says, from the building of the city, but even from the founding of\ntheir laws.\n(17:164) This is borne witness to by Ezekiel xx:25: \"Wherefore I gave them\nalso statutes that were not good, and judgments whereby they should not\nlive; and I polluted them in their own gifts, in that they caused to pass\nthrough the fire all that openeth the womb; that I might make them desolate,\nto the end that they might know that I am the Lord.\"\n(17:165) In order that we may understand these words, and the destruction of\nthe Hebrew commonwealth, we must bear in mind that it had at first been\nintended to entrust the whole duties of the priesthood to the firstborn, and\nnot to the Levites (see Numb. viii:17). (166) It was only when all the\ntribes, except the Levites, worshipped the golden calf, that the\nfirstborn were rejected and defiled, and the Levites chosen in their stead\n(Deut. x:8). (167) When I reflect on this change, I feel disposed to break\nforth with the words of Tacitus. (168) God's object at that time was not the\nsafety of the Jews, but vengeance. (169) I am greatly astonished that the\ncelestial mind was so inflamed with anger that it ordained laws, which\nalways are supposed to promote the honour, well-being, and security of a\npeople, with the purpose of vengeance, for the sake of punishment; so that\nthe laws do not seem so much laws - that is, the safeguard of\nthe people - as pains and penalties.\n(17:170) The gifts which the people were obliged to bestow on the Levites\nand priests - the redemption of the firstborn, the poll-tax due to the\nLevites, the privilege possessed by the latter of the sole performance of\nsacred rites - all these, I say, were a continual reproach to the people, a\ncontinual reminder of their defilement and rejection. (171) Moreover, we may\nbe sure that the Levites were for ever heaping reproaches upon them: for\namong so many thousands there must have been many importunate dabblers in\ntheology. (172) Hence the people got into the way of watching the acts of\nthe Levites, who were but human; of accusing the whole body of the faults of\none member, and continually murmuring.\n(17:173) Besides this, there was the obligation to keep in idleness men\nhateful to them, and connected by no ties of blood. (174) Especially would\nthis seem grievous when provisions were dear. What wonder, then, if in times\nof peace, when striking miracles had ceased, and no men of paramount\nauthority were forthcoming, the irritable and greedy temper of the people\nbegan to wax cold, and at length to fall away from a worship, which, though\nDivine, was also humiliating, and even hostile, and to seek after something\nfresh; or can we be surprised that the captains, who always adopt the\npopular course, in order to gain the sovereign power for themselves by\nenlisting the sympathies of the people, and alienating the high priest,\nshould have yielded to their demands, and introduced a new worship? (175) If\nthe state had been formed according to the original intention, the rights\nand honour of all the tribes would have been equal, and everything would\nhave rested on a firm basis. (176) Who is there who would willingly violate\nthe religious rights of his kindred? (177) What could a man desire more than\nto support his own brothers and parents, thus fulfilling the duties of\nreligion? (178) Who would not rejoice in being taught by them the\ninterpretation of the laws, and receiving through them the answers of God?\n(17:179) The tribes would thus have been united by a far closer bond, if all\nalike had possessed the right to the priesthood. (180) All danger would have\nbeen obviated, if the choice of the Levites had not been dictated by anger\nand revenge. (181) But, as we have said, the Hebrews had offended their God,\nWho, as Ezekiel says, polluted them in their own gifts by rejecting all that\nopeneth the womb, so that He might destroy them.\n(17:182) This passage is also confirmed by their history. As soon as the\npeople in the wilderness began to live in ease and plenty, certain men of no\nmean birth began to rebel against the choice of the Levites, and to make it\na cause for believing that Moses had not acted by the commands of God, but\nfor his own good pleasure, inasmuch as he had chosen his own tribe before\nall the rest, and had bestowed the high priesthood in perpetuity on his own\nbrother. (183) They, therefore, stirred up a tumult, and came to him, crying\nout that all men were equally sacred, and that he had exalted himself above\nhis fellows wrongfully. (184) Moses was not able to pacify them with\nreasons; but by the intervention of a miracle in proof of the faith, they\nall perished. (185) A fresh sedition then arose among the whole people, who\nbelieved that their champions had not been put to death by the judgment of\nGod, but by the device of Moses. (186) After a great slaughter, or\npestilence, the rising subsided from inanition, but in such a manner that\nall preferred death to life under such conditions.\n(17:187) We should rather say that sedition ceased than that harmony was\nre-established. (188) This is witnessed by Scripture (Deut. xxxi:21), where\nGod, after predicting to Moses that the people after his death will fall\naway from the Divine worship, speaks thus: \"For I know their imagination\nwhich they go about, even now before I have brought them into the land which\nI sware;\" and, a little while after (xxxi:27), Moses says: \"For I know thy\nrebellion and thy stiff neck: behold while I am yet alive with you this\nday, ye have been rebellious against the Lord; and how much more after my\ndeath!\"\n(17:189) Indeed, it happened according to his words, as we all know.\n(190) Great changes, extreme license, luxury, and hardness of heart grew up;\nthings went from bad to worse, till at last the people, after being\nfrequently conquered, came to an open rupture with the Divine right, and\nwished for a mortal king, so that the seat of government might be the Court,\ninstead of the Temple, and that the tribes might remain fellow-citizens in\nrespect to their king, instead of in respect to Divine right and the high\npriesthood.\n(17:191) A vast material for new seditions was thus produced, eventually\nresulting in the ruin of the entire state. Kings are above all things\njealous of a precarious rule, and can in nowise brook a dominion within\ntheir own. (192) The first monarchs, being chosen from the ranks of private\ncitizens, were content with the amount of dignity to which they had risen;\nbut their sons, who obtained the throne by right of inheritance, began\ngradually to introduce changes, so as to get all the sovereign rights into\ntheir own hands. (193) This they were generally unable to accomplish, so\nlong as the right of legislation did not rest with them, but with the high\npriest, who kept the laws in the sanctuary, and interpreted them to the\npeople. (194) The kings were thus bound to obey the laws as much as were the\nsubjects, and were unable to abrogate them, or to ordain new laws of equal\nauthority; moreover, they were prevented by the Levites from administering\nthe affairs of religion, king and subject being alike unclean. (195) Lastly,\nthe whole safety of their dominion depended on the will of one man, if that\nman appeared to be a prophet; and of this they had seen an example, namely,\nhow completely Samuel had been able to command Saul, and how easily, because\nof a single disobedience, he had been able to transfer the right of\nsovereignty to David. (196) Thus the kings found a dominion within their\nown, and wielded a precarious sovereignty.\n(17:197) In order to surmount these difficulties, they allowed other temples\nto be dedicated to the gods, so that there might be no further need of\nconsulting the Levites; they also sought out many who prophesied in the name\nof God, so that they might have creatures of their own to oppose to the true\nprophets. (198) However, in spite of all their attempts, they never\nattained their end. (199) For the prophets, prepared against every\nemergency, waited for a favourable opportunity, such as the beginning of a\nnew reign, which is always precarious, while the memory of the previous\nreign remains green. (200) At these times they could easily pronounce by\nDivine authority that the king was tyrannical, and could produce a champion\nof distinguished virtue to vindicate the Divine right, and lawfully to claim\ndominion, or a share in it. (201) Still, not even so could the prophets\neffect much. (202) They could, indeed, remove a tyrant; but there were\nreasons which prevented them from doing more than setting up, at great cost\nof civil bloodshed, another tyrant in his stead. (203) Of discords and civil\nwars there was no end, for the causes for the violation of Divine right\nremained always the same, and could only be removed by a complete\nremodelling of the state.\n(17:204) We have now seen how religion was introduced into the Hebrew\ncommonwealth, and how the dominion might have lasted for ever, if the just\nwrath of the Lawgiver had allowed it. (205) As this was impossible, it was\nbound in time to perish. (206) I am now speaking only of the first\ncommonwealth, for the second was a mere shadow of the first, inasmuch as the\npeople were bound by the rights of the Persians to whom they were subject.\n(207) After the restoration of freedom, the high priests usurped the rights\nof the secular chiefs, and thus obtained absolute dominion. (208) The\npriests were inflamed with an intense desire to wield the powers of the\nsovereignty and the high priesthood at the same time. (209) I have,\ntherefore, no need to speak further of the second commonwealth. (210)\nWhether the first, in so far as we deem it to have been durable, is capable\nof imitation, and whether it would be pious to copy it as far as possible,\nwill appear from what fellows. (211) I wish only to draw attention, as a\ncrowning conclusion, to the principle indicated already - namely, that it is\nevident, from what we have stated in this chapter, that the Divine right, or\nthe right of religion, originates in a compact: without such compact,\nnone but natural rights exist. (212) The Hebrews were not bound by their\nreligion to evince any pious care for other nations not included in the\ncompact, but only for their own fellow-citizens.\n[18:0] CHAPTER XVIII - FROM THE COMMONWEALTH OF THE HEBREWS, AND\nTHEIR HISTORY,  CERTAIN POLITICAL DOCTRINES ARE DEDUCED.\n[18:1] (1) Although the commonwealth of the Hebrews, as we have conceived\nit, might have lasted for ever, it would be impossible to imitate it at the\npresent day, nor would it be advisable so to do. (2) If a people wished to\ntransfer their rights to God it would be necessary to make an express\ncovenant with Him, and for this would be needed not only the consent of\nthose transferring their rights, but also the consent of God. (3) God,\nhowever, has revealed through his Apostles that the covenant of God is no\nlonger written in ink, or on tables of stone, but with the Spirit of God in\nthe fleshy tables of the heart.\n(18:4) Furthermore, such a form of government would only be available for\nthose who desire to have no foreign relations, but to shut themselves up\nwithin their own frontiers, and to live apart from the rest of the world; it\nwould be useless to men who must have dealings with other nations; so that\nthe cases where it could be adopted are very few indeed.\n(18:5) Nevertheless, though it could not be copied in its entirety, it\npossessed many excellent features which might be brought to our notice, and\nperhaps imitated with advantage. (6) My intention, however, is not to write\na treatise on forms of government, so I will pass over most of such points\nin silence, and will only touch on those which bear upon my purpose.\n(18:7) God's kingdom is not infringed upon by the choice of an earthly ruler\nendowed with sovereign rights; for after the Hebrews had transferred their\nrights to God, they conferred the sovereign right of ruling on Moses,\ninvesting him with the sole power of instituting and abrogating laws in\nthe name of God, of choosing priests, of judging, of teaching, of\npunishing - in fact, all the prerogatives of an absolute monarch.\n(18:8) Again, though the priests were the interpreters of the laws, they had\nno power to judge the citizens, or to excommunicate anyone: this could only\nbe done by the judges and chiefs chosen from among the people. (9) A\nconsideration of the successes and the histories of the Hebrews will bring\nto light other considerations worthy of note. To wit:\n(18:9) I. That there were no religious sects, till after the high priests,\nin the second commonwealth, possessed the authority to make decrees, and\ntransact the business of government. (10) In order that such authority might\nlast for ever, the high priests usurped the rights of secular rulers, and\nat last wished to be styled kings. (11) The reason for this is ready to\nhand; in the first commonwealth no decrees could bear the name of the high\npriest, for he had no right to ordain laws, but only to give the answers of\nGod to questions asked by the captains or the councils: he had, therefore,\nno motive for making changes in the law, but took care, on the contrary, to\nadminister and guard what had already been received and accepted. (12) His\nonly means of preserving his freedom in safety against the will of the\ncaptains lay in cherishing the law intact. (13) After the high priests had\nassumed the power of carrying on the government, and added the rights of\nsecular rulers to those they already possessed, each one began both in\nthings religious and in things secular, to seek for the glorification of his\nown name, settling everything by sacerdotal authority, and issuing every\nday, concerning ceremonies, faith, and all else, new decrees which he sought\nto make as sacred and authoritative as the laws of Moses. (14) Religion thus\nsank into a degrading superstition, while the true meaning and\ninterpretation of the laws became corrupted. (15) Furthermore, while the\nhigh priests were paving their way to the secular rule just after the\nrestoration, they attempted to gain popular favour by assenting to\nevery demand; approving whatever the people did, however impious, and\naccommodating Scripture to the very depraved current morals. (16) Malachi\nbears witness to this in no measured terms: he chides the priests of his\ntime as despisers of the name of God, and then goes on with his invective as\nfollows (Mal ii:7, 8): \"For the priest's lips should keep knowledge,\nand they should seek the law at his mouth: for he is the messenger of\nthe Lord of hosts. (17) But ye are departed out of the way; ye have\ncaused many to stumble at the law, ye have corrupted the covenant of\nLevi, saith the Lord of hosts.\" (18) He further accuses them of interpreting\nthe laws according to their own pleasure, and paying no respect to God but\nonly to persons. (19) It is certain that the high priests were never so\ncautious in their conduct as to escape the remark of the more shrewd among\nthe people, for the latter were at length emboldened to assert that no\nlaws ought to be kept save those that were written, and that the decrees\nwhich the Pharisees (consisting, as Josephus says in his \"Antiquities,\"\nchiefly of the common people), were deceived into calling the traditions of\nthe fathers, should not be observed at all. (20) However this may be, we can\nin nowise doubt that flattery of the high priest, the corruption of religion\nand the laws, and the enormous increase of the extent of the last-named,\ngave very great and frequent occasion for disputes and altercations\nimpossible to allay. (21) When men begin to quarrel with all the ardour of\nsuperstition, and the magistracy to back up one side or the other, they can\nnever come to a compromise, but are bound to split into sects.\n(18:22) II. It is worthy of remark that the prophets, who were in a private\nstation of life, rather irritated than reformed mankind by their freedom of\nwarning, rebuke, and censure; whereas the kings, by their reproofs and\npunishments, could always produce an effect. (23) The prophets were often\nintolerable even to pious kings, on account of the authority they assumed\nfor judging whether an action was right or wrong, or for reproving the kings\nthemselves if they dared to transact any business, whether public or\nprivate, without prophetic sanction. (24) King Asa who, according to\nthe testimony of Scripture, reigned piously, put the prophet Hanani into a\nprison-house because he had ventured freely to chide and reprove him for\nentering into a covenant with the king of Armenia.\n(18:25) Other examples might be cited, tending to prove that religion\ngained more harm than good by such freedom, not to speak of the further\nconsequence, that if the prophets had retained their rights, great\ncivil wars would have resulted.\n(26) III. It is remarkable that during all the period, during which the\npeople held the reins of power, there was only one civil war, and that one\nwas completely extinguished, the conquerors taking such pity on the\nconquered, that they endeavoured in every way to reinstate them in their\nformer dignity and power. (27) But after that the people, little accustomed\nto kings, changed its first form of government into a monarchy, civil war\nraged almost continuously; and battles were so fierce as to exceed all\nothers recorded; in one engagement (taxing our faith to the utmost)\nfive hundred thousand Israelites were slaughtered by the men of Judah, and\nin another the Israelites slew great numbers of the men of Judah (the\nfigures are not given in Scripture), almost razed to the ground the walls of\nJerusalem, and sacked the Temple in their unbridled fury. (28) At length,\nladen with the spoils of their brethren, satiated with blood, they took\nhostages, and leaving the king in his well-nigh devastated kingdom, laid\ndown their arms, relying on the weakness rather than the good faith of their\nfoes. (29) A few years after, the men of Judah, with recruited strength,\nagain took the field, but were a second time beaten by the Israelites, and\nslain to the number of a hundred and twenty thousand, two hundred thousand\nof their wives and children were led into captivity, and a great booty again\nseized. (30) Worn out with these and similar battles set forth at length in\ntheir histories, the Jews at length fell a prey to their enemies.\n(18:31) Furthermore, if we reckon up the times during which peace prevailed\nunder each form of government, we shall find a great discrepancy. (32)\nBefore the monarchy forty years and more often passed, and once eighty years\n(an almost unparalleled period), without any war, foreign or civil. (33)\nAfter the kings acquired sovereign power, the fighting was no longer for\npeace and liberty, but for glory; accordingly we find that they all, with\nthe exception of Solomon (whose virtue and wisdom would be better displayed\nin peace than in war) waged war, and finally a fatal desire for power gained\nground, which, in many cases, made the path to the throne a bloody one.\n(18:34) Lastly, the laws, during the rule of the people, remained\nuncorrupted and were studiously observed. (35) Before the monarchy there\nwere very few prophets to admonish the people, but after the establishment\nof kings there were a great number at the same time. (36) Obadiah saved a\nhundred from death and hid them away, lest they should be slain with the\nrest. (37) The people, so far as we can see, were never deceived by false\nprophets till after the power had been vested in kings, whose creatures many\nof the prophets were. (38) Again, the people, whose heart was generally\nproud or humble according to its circumstances, easily corrected itself\nunder misfortune, turned again to God, restored His laws, and so freed\nitself from all peril; but the kings, whose hearts were always equally\npuffed up, and who could not be corrected without humiliation, clung\npertinaciously to their vices, even till the last overthrow of the city.\n[18:2] (39) We may now clearly see from what I have said:-\n(40) I. How hurtful to religion and the state is the concession to ministers\nof religion of any power of issuing decrees or transacting the business of\ngovernment: how, on the contrary, far greater stability is afforded, if the\nsaid ministers are only allowed to give answers to questions duly put\nto them, and are, as a rule, obliged to preach and practise the received and\naccepted doctrines.\n(18:41) II How dangerous it is to refer to Divine right matters merely\nspeculative and subject or liable to dispute. (42) The most tyrannical\ngovernments are those which make crimes of opinions, for everyone has an\ninalienable right over his thoughts - nay, such a state of things leads to\nthe rule of popular passion.\n(18:43) Pontius Pilate made concession to the passion of the Pharisees in\nconsenting to the crucifixion of Christ, whom he knew to be innocent. (44)\nAgain, the Pharisees, in order to shake the position of men richer than\nthemselves, began to set on foot questions of religion, and accused the\nSadducees of impiety, and, following their example, the vilest hypocrites,\nstirred, as they pretended, by the same holy wrath which they called zeal\nfor the Lord, persecuted men whose unblemished character and distinguished\nvirtue had excited the popular hatred, publicly denounced their opinions,\nand inflamed the fierce passions of the people against them.\n(18:45) This wanton licence being cloaked with the specious garb of\nreligion could not easily be repressed, especially when the sovereign\nauthorities introduced a sect of which they were not the head; they were\nthen regarded not as interpreters of Divine right, but as sectarians - that\nis, as persons recognizing the right of Divine interpretation assumed by the\nleaders of the sect. (46) The authority of the magistrates thus became of\nlittle account in such matters in comparison with the authority of sectarian\nleaders before whose interpretations kings were obliged to bow.\n(18:47) To avoid such evils in a state, there is no safer way, than to make\npiety and religion to consist in acts only - that is, in the practice of\njustice and charity, leaving everyone's judgment in other respects free.\n(48) But I will speak of this more at length presently.\n[18:3] (49) III. We see how necessary it is, both in the interests of the\nstate and in the interests of religion, to confer on the sovereign power the\nright of deciding what is lawful or the reverse. (50) If this right of\njudging actions could not be given to the very prophets of God without great\ninjury to the state and religion, how much less should it be entrusted to\nthose who can neither foretell the future nor work miracles! (51) But this\nagain I will treat of more fully hereafter.\n(18:52) IV. Lastly, we see how disastrous it is for a people unaccustomed\nto kings, and possessing a complete code of laws, to set up a monarchy. (53)\nNeither can the subjects brook such a sway, nor the royal authority submit\nto laws and popular rights set up by anyone inferior to itself. (54) Still\nless can a king be expected to defend such laws, for they were not framed to\nsupport his dominion, but the dominion of the people, or some council which\nformerly ruled, so that in guarding the popular rights the king would seem\nto be a slave rather than a master. (55) The representative of a new\nmonarchy will employ all his zeal in attempting to frame new laws, so\nas to wrest the rights of dominion to his own use, and to reduce the people\ntill they find it easier to increase than to curtail the royal prerogative.\n(56) I must not, however, omit to state that it is no less dangerous to\nremove a monarch, though he is on all hands admitted to be a tyrant. (57)\nFor his people are accustomed to royal authority and will obey no other,\ndespising and mocking at any less august control.\n(18:58) It is therefore necessary, as the prophets discovered of old, if one\nking be removed, that he should be replaced by another, who will be a tyrant\nfrom necessity rather than choice. (59) For how will he be able to endure\nthe sight of the hands of the citizens reeking with royal blood, and to\nrejoice in their regicide as a glorious exploit? (60) Was not the deed\nperpetrated as an example and warning for himself?\n(18:61) If he really wishes to be king, and not to acknowledge the people as\nthe judge of kings and the master of himself, or to wield a precarious sway,\nhe must avenge the death of his predecessor, making an example for his own\nsake, lest the people should venture to repeat a similar crime. (62) He will\nnot, however, be able easily to avenge the death of the tyrant by the\nslaughter of citizens unless he defends the cause of tyranny and approves\nthe deeds of his predecessor, thus following in his footsteps.\n(18:63) Hence it comes to pass that peoples have often changed their\ntyrants, but never removed them or changed the monarchical form of\ngovernment into any other.\n[18:4] (64) The English people furnish us with a terrible example of this\nfact. (65) They sought how to depose their monarch under the forms of law,\nbut when he had been removed, they were utterly unable to change the form of\ngovernment, and after much bloodshed only brought it about, that a new\nmonarch should be hailed under a different name (as though it had been a\nmere question of names); this new monarch could only consolidate his power\nby completely destroying the royal stock, putting to death the king's\nfriends, real or supposed, and disturbing with war the peace which might\nencourage discontent, in order that the populace might be engrossed with\nnovelties and divert its mind from brooding over the slaughter of the king.\n(66) At last, however, the people reflected that it had accomplished nothing\nfor the good of the country beyond violating the rights of the lawful king\nand changing everything for the worse. (67) It therefore decided to retrace\nits steps as soon as possible, and never rested till it had seen a\ncomplete restoration of the original state of affairs.\n(18:68) It may perhaps be objected that the Roman people was easily able to\nremove its tyrants, but I gather from its history a strong confirmation of\nmy contention. (69) Though the Roman people was much more than\nordinarily capable of removing their tyrants and changing their\nform of government, inasmuch as it held in its own hands the power of\nelecting its king and his successor, and being composed of rebels and\ncriminals had not long been used to the royal yoke (out of its six kings it\nhad put to death three), nevertheless it could accomplish nothing\nbeyond electing several tyrants in place of one, who kept it groaning under\na continual state of war, both foreign and civil, till at last it changed\nits government again to a form differing from monarchy, as in England, only\nin name.\n[18:5] (70) As for the United States of the Netherlands, they have never, as\nwe know, had a king, but only counts, who never attained the full rights of\ndominion. (71) The States of the Netherlands evidently acted as principals\nin the settlement made by them at the time of the Earl of Leicester's\nmission: they always reserved for themselves the authority to keep the\ncounts up to their duties, and the power to preserve this authority\nand the liberty of the citizens. (72) They had ample means of vindicating\ntheir rights if their rulers should prove tyrannical, and could impose\nsuch restraints that nothing could be done without their consent and\napproval.\n(18:73) Thus the rights of sovereign power have always been vested in the\nStates, though the last count endeavoured to usurp them. (74) It is\ntherefore little likely that the States should give them up, especially as\nthey have just restored their original dominion, lately almost lost.\n(18:75) These examples, then, confirm us in our belief, that every dominion\nshould retain its original form, and, indeed, cannot change it without\ndanger of the utter ruin of the whole state. (76) Such are the points I have\nhere thought worthy of remark.\n[19:0] CHAPTER XIX - IT IS SHOWN THAT THE RIGHT OVER MATTERS\nSPIRITUAL LIES WHOLLY WITH THE SOVEREIGN, AND THAT\nTHE OUTWARD FORMS OF RELIGION SHOULD BE IN ACCORDANCE\nWITH PUBLIC PEACE, IF WE WOULD OBEY GOD ARIGHT.\n(1) When I said that the possessors of sovereign power have rights over\neverything, and that all rights are dependent on their decree, I did not\nmerely mean temporal rights, but also spiritual rights; of the latter, no\nless than the former, they ought to be the interpreters and the\nchampions. (2) I wish to draw special attention to this point, and to\ndiscuss it fully in this chapter, because many persons deny that the right\nof deciding religious questions belongs to the sovereign power, and refuse\nto acknowledge it as the interpreter of Divine right. (3) They\naccordingly assume full licence to accuse and arraign it, nay, even to\nexcommunicate it from the Church, as Ambrosius treated the Emperor\nTheodosius in old time. (4) However, I will show later on in this chapter\nthat they take this means of dividing the government, and paving the\nway to their own ascendancy. (5) I wish, however, first to point out that\nreligion acquires its force as law solely from the decrees of the sovereign.\n(6) God has no special kingdom among men except in so far as He reigns\nthrough temporal rulers. [19:1] (7) Moreover, the rites of religion and the\noutward observances of piety should be in accordance with the public peace\nand well-being, and should therefore be determined by the sovereign power\nalone. (8) I speak here only of the outward observances of piety and the\nexternal rites of religion, not of piety, itself, nor of the inward worship\nof God, nor the means by which the mind is inwardly led to do homage to God\nin singleness of heart.\n(19:9) Inward worship of God and piety in itself are within the sphere of\neveryone's private rights, and cannot be alienated (as I showed at the end\nof Chapter VII.). (10) What I here mean by the kingdom of God is, I\nthink, sufficiently clear from what has been said in Chapter XIV.\n(11) I there showed that a man best fulfils God's law who worships Him,\naccording to His command, through acts of justice and charity; it follows,\ntherefore, that wherever justice and charity have the force of law and\nordinance, there is God's kingdom.\n(19:12) I recognize no difference between the cases where God teaches and\ncommands the practice of justice and charity through our natural faculties,\nand those where He makes special revelations; nor is the form of the\nrevelation of importance so long as such practice is revealed and becomes a\nsovereign and supreme law to men. (13) If, therefore, I show that justice\nand charity can only acquire the force of right and law through the rights\nof rulers, I shall be able readily to arrive at the conclusion (seeing that\nthe rights of rulers are in the possession of the sovereign), that religion\ncan only acquire the force of right by means of those who have the right to\ncommand, and that God only rules among men through the instrumentality of\nearthly potentates. (14) It follows from what has been said, that the\npractice of justice and charity only acquires the force of law through the\nrights of the sovereign authority; for we showed in Chapter XVI. that in the\nstate of nature reason has no more rights than desire, but that men living\neither by the laws of the former or the laws of the latter, possess rights\nco-extensive with their powers.\n(19:15) For this reason we could not conceive sin to exist in the state of\nnature, nor imagine God as a judge punishing man's transgressions; but we\nsupposed all things to happen according to the general laws of universal\nnature, there being no difference between pious and impious, between him\nthat was pure (as Solomon says) and him that was impure, because there was\nno possibility either of justice or charity.\n[19:2] (16) In order that the true doctrines of reason, that is (as we\nshowed in Chapter IV.), the true Divine doctrines might obtain absolutely\nthe force of law and right, it was necessary that each individual should\ncede his natural right, and transfer it either to society as a whole, or to\na certain body of men, or to one man. (17) Then, and not till then,\ndoes it first dawn upon us what is justice and what is injustice,\nwhat is equity and what is iniquity.\n(19:18) Justice, therefore, and absolutely all the precepts of reason,\nincluding love towards one's neighbour, receive the force of laws and\nordinances solely through the rights of dominion, that is (as we showed in\nthe same chapter) solely on the decree of those who possess the right to\nrule. (19) Inasmuch as the kingdom of God consists entirely in rights\napplied to justice and charity or to true religion, it follows that (as we\nasserted) the kingdom of God can only exist among men through the means of\nthe sovereign powers; nor does it make any difference whether religion be\napprehended by our natural faculties or by revelation: the argument is sound\nin both cases, inasmuch as religion is one and the same, and is equally\nrevealed by God, whatever be the manner in which it becomes known to men.\n(19:20) Thus, in order that the religion revealed by the prophets might have\nthe force of law among the Jews, it was necessary that every man of them\nshould yield up his natural right, and that all should, with one accord,\nagree that they would only obey such commands as God should\nreveal to them through the prophets. (21) Just as we have shown to take\nplace in a democracy, where men with one consent agree to live according to\nthe dictates of reason. (22) Although the Hebrews furthermore transferred\ntheir right to God, they were able to do so rather in theory than in\npractice, for, as a matter of fact (as we pointed out above) they\nabsolutely retained the right of dominion till they transferred it to Moses,\nwho in his turn became absolute king, so that it was only through him that\nGod reigned over the Hebrews. (23) For this reason (namely, that religion\nonly acquires the force of law by means of the sovereign power) Moses was\nnot able to punish those who, before the covenant, and consequently while\nstill in possession of their rights, violated the Sabbath (Exod. xvi:27),\nbut was able to do so after the covenant (Numb. xv:36), because everyone had\nthen yielded up his natural rights, and the ordinance of the\nSabbath had received the force of law.\n(19:24) Lastly, for the same reason, after the destruction of the Hebrew\ndominion, revealed religion ceased to have the force of law; for we cannot\ndoubt that as soon as the Jews transferred their right to the king of\nBabylon, the kingdom of God and the Divine right forthwith ceased. (25)\nFor the covenant wherewith they promised to obey all the utterances of God\nwas abrogated; God's kingdom, which was based thereupon, also ceased. (26)\nThe Hebrews could no longer abide thereby, inasmuch as their rights no\nlonger belonged to them but to the king of Babylon, whom (as we showed in\nChapter XVI.) they were bound to obey in all things. (27) Jeremiah (chap.\nxxix:7) expressly admonishes them of this fact: \"And seek the peace of the\ncity, whither I have caused you to be carried away captives, and pray unto\nthe Lord for it; for in the peace thereof shall ye have peace.\" (28) Now,\nthey could not seek the peace of the City as having a share in its\ngovernment, but only as slaves, being, as they were, captives; by\nobedience in all things, with a view to avoiding seditions, and by observing\nall the laws of the country, however different from their own. (29) It is\nthus abundantly evident that religion among the Hebrews only acquired the\nform of law through the right of the sovereign rule; when that rule was\ndestroyed, it could no longer be received as the law of a particular\nkingdom, but only as the universal precept of reason. (30) I say of reason,\nfor the universal religion had not yet become known by revelation. (31) We\nmay therefore draw the general conclusion that religion, whether revealed\nthrough our natural faculties or through prophets, receives the force of a\ncommand solely through the decrees of the holders of sovereign power; and,\nfurther, that God has no special kingdom among men, except in so far as He\nreigns through earthly potentates.\n(19:32) We may now see in a clearer light what was stated in Chapter IV.,\nnamely, that all the decrees of God involve eternal truth and necessity, so\nthat we cannot conceive God as a prince or legislator giving laws to\nmankind. (33) For this reason the Divine precepts, whether revealed through\nour natural faculties, or through prophets, do not receive immediately from\nGod the force of a command, but only from those, or through the mediation of\nthose, who possess the right of ruling and legislating. (34) It is only\nthrough these latter means that God rules among men, and directs human\naffairs with justice and equity.\n(19:35) This conclusion is supported by experience, for we find traces of\nDivine justice only in places where just men bear sway; elsewhere the same\nlot (to repeat, again Solomon's words) befalls the just and the unjust, the\npure and the impure: a state of things which causes Divine Providence to be\ndoubted by many who think that God immediately reigns among men, and\ndirects all nature for their benefit.\n[19:3] (36) As, then, both reason and experience tell us that the Divine\nright is entirely dependent on the decrees of secular rulers, it follows\nthat secular rulers are its proper interpreters. (37) How this is so we\nshall now see, for it is time to show that the outward observances of\nreligion, and all the external practices of piety should be brought into\naccordance with the public peace and well-being if we would obey God\nrightly. (38) When this has been shown we shall easily understand how the\nsovereign rulers are the proper interpreters of religion and piety.\n(19:39) It is certain that duties towards one's country are the highest that\nman can fulfil; for, if government be taken away, no good thing can last,\nall falls into dispute, anger and anarchy reign unchecked amid universal\nfear. (40) Consequently there can be no duty towards our neighbour which\nwould not become an offence if it involved injury to the whole state, nor\ncan there be any offence against our duty towards our neighbour, or anything\nbut loyalty in what we do for the sake of preserving the state. (41) For\ninstance: it is in the abstract my duty when my neighbour quarrels with me\nand wishes to take my cloak, to give him my coat also; but if it be thought\nthat such conduct is hurtful to the maintenance of the state, I ought to\nbring him to trial, even at the risk of his being condemned to death.\n(19:42) For this reason Manlius Torquatus is held up to honour, inasmuch as\nthe public welfare outweighed with him his duty towards his children. (43)\nThis being so, it follows that the public welfare is the sovereign law to\nwhich all others, Divine and human, should be made to conform. (44) Now, it\nis the function of the sovereign only to decide what is necessary for the\npublic welfare and the safety of the state, and to give orders accordingly;\ntherefore it is also the function of the sovereign only to decide the limits\nof our duty towards our neighbour - in other words, to determine how we\nshould obey God. (45) We can now clearly understand how the sovereign\nis the interpreter of religion, and further, that no one can obey God\nrightly, if the practices of his piety do not conform to the public welfare;\nor, consequently, if he does not implicitly obey all the commands of the\nsovereign. (46) For as by God's command we are bound to do our duty to all\nmen without exception, and to do no man an injury, we are also bound not\nto help one man at another's loss, still less at a loss to the whole state.\n(47) Now, no private citizen can know what is good for the state, except he\nlearn it through the sovereign power, who alone has the right to transact\npublic business: therefore no one can rightly practise piety or obedience to\nGod, unless he obey the sovereign power's commands in all things. (48) This\nproposition is confirmed by the facts of experience. (49) For if the\nsovereign adjudge a man to be worthy of death or an enemy, whether he be a\ncitizen or a foreigner, a private individual or a separate ruler, no subject\nis allowed to give him assistance. (50) So also though the Jews were\nbidden to love their fellow-citizens as themselves (Levit. xix:17, 18), they\nwere nevertheless bound, if a man offended against the law, to point him out\nto the judge (Levit. v:1, and Deut. xiii:8, 9), and, if he should be\ncondemned to death, to slay him (Deut. xvii:7).\n(19:51) Further, in order that the Hebrews might preserve the liberty they\nhad gained, and might retain absolute sway over the territory they had\nconquered, it was necessary, as we showed in Chapter XVII., that their\nreligion should be adapted to their particular government, and that they\nshould separate themselves from the rest of the nations: wherefore it was\ncommanded to them, \"Love thy neighbour and hate thine enemy\" (Matt. v:43),\nbut after they had lost their dominion and had gone into captivity in\nBabylon, Jeremiah bid them take thought for the safety of the state into\nwhich they had been led captive; and Christ when He saw that they would be\nspread over the whole world, told them to do their duty by all men without\nexception; all of which instances show that religion has always been made to\nconform to the public welfare. [19:4] (52) Perhaps someone will ask: By what\nright, then, did the disciples of Christ, being private citizens, preach\na new religion? (53) I answer that they did so by the right of the\npower which they had received from Christ against unclean spirits (see Matt.\nx:1). (54) I have already stated in Chapter XVI. that all are bound to obey\na tyrant, unless they have received from God through undoubted revelation a\npromise of aid against him; so let no one take example from the Apostles\nunless he too has the power of working miracles. (55) The point is brought\nout more clearly by Christ's command to His disciples, \"Fear not those who\nkill the body\" (Matt. x:28). (56) If this command were imposed on everyone,\ngovernments would be founded in vain, and Solomon's words (Prov. xxiv:21),\n\"My son, fear God and the king,\" would be impious, which they certainly are\nnot; we must therefore admit that the authority which Christ gave to His\ndisciples was given to them only, and must not be taken as an example for\nothers.\n(19:57) I do not pause to consider the arguments of those who wish to\nseparate secular rights from spiritual rights, placing the former under the\ncontrol of the sovereign, and the latter under the control of the universal\nChurch; such pretensions are too frivolous to merit refutation. (58) I\ncannot however, pass over in silence the fact that such persons are woefully\ndeceived when they seek to support their seditious opinions (I ask pardon\nfor the somewhat harsh epithet) by the example of the Jewish high priest,\nwho, in ancient times, had the right of administering the sacred offices.\n(59) Did not the high priests receive their right by the decree of Moses\n(who, as I have shown, retained the sole right to rule), and could they not\nby the same means be deprived of it? (60) Moses himself chose not only\nAaron, but also his son Eleazar, and his grandson Phineas, and bestowed on\nthem the right of administering the office of high priest. (61) This right\nwas retained by the high priests afterwards, but none the less were they\ndelegates of Moses - that is, of the sovereign power. (62) Moses, as we have\nshown, left no successor to his dominion, but so distributed his\nprerogatives, that those who came after him seemed, as it were, regents who\nadminister the government when a king is absent but not dead.\n(19:62) In the second commonwealth the high priests held their right\nabsolutely, after they had obtained the rights of principality in addition.\n(63) Wherefore the rights of the high priesthood always depended on the\nedict of the sovereign, and the high priests did not possess them till\nthey became sovereigns also. (64) Rights in matters spiritual always\nremained under the control of the kings absolutely (as I will show at the\nend of this chapter), except in the single particular that they were not\nallowed to administer in person the sacred duties in the Temple, inasmuch\nas they were not of the family of Aaron, and were therefore considered\nunclean, a reservation which would have no force in a Christian community.\n(19:65) We cannot, therefore, doubt that the daily sacred rites (whose\nperformance does not require a particular genealogy but only a special mode\nof life, and from which the holders of sovereign power are not excluded as\nunclean) are under the sole control of the sovereign power; no one,\nsave by the authority or concession of such sovereign, has the right or\npower of administering them, of choosing others to administer them, of\ndefining or strengthening the foundations of the Church and her doctrines;\nof judging on questions of morality or acts of piety; of receiving\nanyone into the Church or excommunicating him therefrom, or, lastly, of\nproviding for the poor.\n(19:66) These doctrines are proved to be not only true (as we have already\npointed out), but also of primary necessity for the preservation of religion\nand the state. (67) We all know what weight spiritual right and authority\ncarries in the popular mind: how everyone hangs on the lips, as it were, of\nthose who possess it. (68) We may even say that those who wield such\nauthority have the most complete sway over the popular mind.\n(19:69) Whosoever, therefore, wishes to take this right away from the\nsovereign power, is desirous of dividing the dominion; from such division,\ncontentions, and strife will necessarily spring up, as they did of old\nbetween the Jewish kings and high priests, and will defy all attempts to\nallay them. (70) Nay, further, he who strives to deprive the sovereign power\nof such authority, is aiming (as we have said), at gaining dominion for\nhimself. (71) What is left for the sovereign power to decide on, if this\nright be denied him? (72) Certainly nothing concerning either war or\npeace, if he has to ask another man's opinion as to whether what he\nbelieves to be beneficial would be pious or impious. (73) Everything would\ndepend on the verdict of him who had the right of deciding and judging what\nwas pious or impious, right or wrong.\n(19:74) When such a right was bestowed on the Pope of Rome absolutely, he\ngradually acquired complete control over the kings, till at last he himself\nmounted to the summits of dominion; however much monarchs, and especially\nthe German emperors, strove to curtail his authority, were it only by a\nhairsbreadth, they effected nothing, but on the contrary by their very\nendeavours largely increased it. (75) That which no monarch could accomplish\nwith fire and sword, ecclesiastics could bring about with a stroke of the\npen; whereby we may easily see the force and power at the command of the\nChurch, and also how necessary it is for sovereigns to reserve such\nprerogatives for themselves.\n(19:76) If we reflect on what was said in the last chapter we shall see that\nsuch reservation conduced not a little to the increase of religion and\npiety; for we observed that the prophets themselves, though gifted with\nDivine efficacy, being merely private citizens, rather irritated than\nreformed the people by their freedom of warning, reproof, and denunciation,\nwhereas the kings by warnings and punishments easily bent men to their will.\n(77) Furthermore, the kings themselves, not possessing the right in question\nabsolutely, very often fell away from religion and took with them nearly the\nwhole people. (78) The same thing has often happened from the same cause in\nChristian states.\n(19:79) Perhaps I shall be asked, \"But if the holders of sovereign power\nchoose to be wicked, who will be the rightful champion of piety? (80) Should\nthe sovereigns still be its interpreters?\" I meet them with the\ncounter-question, \"But if ecclesiastics (who are also human, and private\ncitizens, and who ought to mind only their own affairs), or if others whom\nit is proposed to entrust with spiritual authority, choose to be wicked,\nshould they still be considered as piety's rightful interpreters?\" (81) It\nis quite certain that when sovereigns wish to follow their own pleasure,\nwhether they have control over spiritual matters or not, the whole state,\nspiritual and secular, will go to ruin, and it will go much faster if\nprivate citizens seditiously assume the championship of the Divine rights.\n(19:82) Thus we see that not only is nothing gained by denying such rights\nto sovereigns, but on the contrary, great evil ensues. (83) For (as happened\nwith the Jewish kings who did not possess such rights absolutely) rulers are\nthus driven into wickedness, and the injury and loss to the state become\ncertain and inevitable, instead of uncertain and possible. (84) Whether we\nlook to the abstract truth, or the security of states, or the increase of\npiety, we are compelled to maintain that the Divine right, or the right of\ncontrol over spiritual matters, depends absolutely on the decree of the\nsovereign, who is its legitimate interpreter and champion. (85) Therefore\nthe true ministers of God's word are those who teach piety to the people in\nobedience to the authority of the sovereign rulers by whose decree it has\nbeen brought into conformity with the public welfare.\n[19:5] (86) There remains for me to point out the cause for the frequent\ndisputes on the subject of these spiritual rights in Christian states;\nwhereas the Hebrews, so far as I know, never, had any doubts about the\nmatter. (87) It seems monstrous that a question so plain and vitally\nimportant should thus have remained undecided, and that the secular rulers\ncould never obtain the prerogative without controversy, nay, nor without\ngreat danger of sedition and injury to religion. (88) If no cause for this\nstate of things were forthcoming, I could easily persuade myself that all I\nhave said in this chapter is mere theorizing, or a kind of speculative\nreasoning which can never be of any practical use. (89) However, when we\nreflect on the beginnings of Christianity the cause at once becomes\nmanifest. (90) The Christian religion was not taught at first by kings, but\nby private persons, who, against the wishes of those in power, whose\nsubjects they were, were for a long time accustomed to hold meetings in\nsecret churches, to institute and perform sacred rites, and on their own\nauthority to settle and decide on their affairs without regard to the state,\n(91) When, after the lapse of many years, the religion was taken up by the\nauthorities, the ecclesiastics were obliged to teach it to the emperors\nthemselves as they had defined it: wherefore they easily gained recognition\nas its teachers and interpreters, and the church pastors were looked upon as\nvicars of God. (92) The ecclesiastics took good care that the Christian\nkings should not assume their authority, by prohibiting marriage to the\nchief ministers of religion and to its highest interpreter. (93) They\nfurthermore elected their purpose by multiplying the dogmas of religion to\nsuch an extent and so blending them with philosophy that their chief\ninterpreter was bound to be a skilled philosopher and theologian, and to\nhave leisure for a host of idle speculations: conditions which could only be\nfulfilled by a private individual with much time on his hands.\n(19:94) Among the Hebrews things were very differently arranged: for their\nChurch began at the same time as their dominion, and Moses, their absolute\nruler, taught religion to the people, arranged their sacred rites, and chose\ntheir spiritual ministers. (95) Thus the royal authority carried very great\nweight with the people, and the kings kept a firm hold on their spiritual\nprerogatives.\n(19:96) Although, after the death of Moses, no one held absolute sway, yet\nthe power of deciding both in matters spiritual and matters temporal was in\nthe hands of the secular chief, as I have already pointed out. (97) Further,\nin order that it might be taught religion and piety, the people was bound to\nconsult the supreme judge no less than the high priest (Deut. xvii:9, 11).\n(98) Lastly, though the kings had not as much power as Moses, nearly the\nwhole arrangement and choice of the sacred ministry depended on their\ndecision. (99) Thus David arranged the whole service of the Temple (see 1\nChron. xxviii:11, 12, &c.); from all the Levites he chose twenty-four\nthousand for the sacred psalms; six thousand of these formed the\nbody from which were chosen the judges and proctors, four thousand were\nporters, and four thousand to play on instruments (see 1 Chron. xxiii:4, 5).\n(100) He further divided them into companies (of whom he chose the chiefs),\nso that each in rotation, at the allotted time, might perform the sacred\nrites. (101) The priests he also divided into as many companies; I will not\ngo through the whole catalogue, but refer the reader to 2 Chron. viii:13,\nwhere it is stated, \"Then Solomon offered burnt offerings to the Lord . . .\n. . after a certain rate every day, offering according to the commandments\nof Moses;\" and in verse 14, \"And he appointed, according to the order\nof David his father, the courses of the priests to their service . . . .\n. . for so had David the man of God commanded.\" (102) Lastly, the historian\nbears witness in verse 15: \"And they departed not from the commandment of\nthe king unto the priests and Levites concerning any matter, or\nconcerning the treasuries.\"\n[19:6] (103) From these and other histories of the kings it is abundantly\nevident, that the whole practice of religion and the sacred ministry\ndepended entirely on the commands of the king.\n(19:104) When I said above that the kings had not the same right as Moses to\nelect the high priest, to consult God without intermediaries, and to condemn\nthe prophets who prophesied during their reign; I said so simply because the\nprophets could, in virtue of their mission, choose a new king and give\nabsolution for regicide, not because they could call a king who offended\nagainst the law to judgment, or could rightly act against him [Endnote 33].\n(19:105) Wherefore if there had been no prophets who, in virtue of a special\nrevelation, could give absolution for regicide, the kings would have\npossessed absolute rights over all matters both spiritual and temporal.\n(106) Consequently the rulers of modern times, who have no prophets and\nwould not rightly be bound in any case to receive them (for they are not\nsubject to Jewish law), have absolute possession of the spiritual\nprerogative, although they are not celibates, and they will always retain\nit, if they will refuse to allow religious dogmas to be unduly multiplied or\nconfounded with philosophy.\n[20:0] CHAPTER XX - THAT IN A FREE STATE EVERY MAN\nMAY THINK WHAT HE LIKES, AND SAY WHAT HE THINKS.\n[20:1] (1) If men's minds were as easily controlled as their tongues, every\nking would sit safely on his throne, and government by compulsion would\ncease; for every subject would shape his life according to the intentions of\nhis rulers, and would esteem a thing true or false, good or evil, just or\nunjust, in obedience to their dictates. (2) However, we have shown already\n(Chapter XVII.) that no man's mind can possibly lie wholly at the\ndisposition of another, for no one can willingly transfer his natural right\nof free reason and judgment, or be compelled so to do. (3) For this\nreason government which attempts to control minds is accounted tyrannical,\nand it is considered an abuse of sovereignty and a usurpation of the rights\nof subjects, to seek to prescribe what shall be accepted as true, or\nrejected as false, or what opinions should actuate men in their worship of\nGod. (4) All these questions fall within a man's natural right, which he\ncannot abdicate even with his own consent.\n(20:5) I admit that the judgment can be biassed in many ways, and to an\nalmost incredible degree, so that while exempt from direct external control\nit may be so dependent on another man's words, that it may fitly be said to\nbe ruled by him; but although this influence is carried to great lengths, it\nhas never gone so far as to invalidate the statement, that every man's\nunderstanding is his own, and that brains are as diverse as palates.\n(20:6) Moses, not by fraud, but by Divine virtue, gained such a hold over\nthe popular judgment that he was accounted superhuman, and believed to speak\nand act through the inspiration of the Deity; nevertheless, even he could\nnot escape murmurs and evil interpretations. (7) How much less then can\nother monarchs avoid them! (8) Yet such unlimited power, if it exists at\nall, must belong to a monarch, and least of all to a democracy, where the\nwhole or a great part of the people wield authority collectively. (9) This\nis a fact which I think everyone can explain for himself.\n(20:10) However unlimited, therefore, the power of a sovereign may be,\nhowever implicitly it is trusted as the exponent of law and religion, it can\nnever prevent men from forming judgments according to their intellect, or\nbeing influenced by any given emotion. (11) It is true that it has the right\nto treat as enemies all men whose opinions do not, on all subjects, entirely\ncoincide with its own; but we are not discussing its strict rights, but its\nproper course of action. (12) I grant that it has the right to rule in the\nmost violent manner, and to put citizens to death for very trivial causes,\nbut no one supposes it can do this with the approval of sound judgment. (13)\nNay, inasmuch as such things cannot be done without extreme peril to itself,\nwe may even deny that it has the absolute power to do them, or,\nconsequently, the absolute right; for the rights of the sovereign are\nlimited by his power.\n[20:2] (14) Since, therefore, no one can abdicate his freedom of judgment\nand feeling; since every man is by indefeasible natural right the master of\nhis own thoughts, it follows that men thinking in diverse and contradictory\nfashions, cannot, without disastrous results, be compelled to speak only\naccording to the dictates of the supreme power. (15) Not even the most\nexperienced, to say nothing of the multitude, know how to keep silence. (16)\nMen's common failing is to confide their plans to others, though there be\nneed for secrecy, so that a government would be most harsh which deprived\nthe individual of his freedom of saying and teaching what he thought; and\nwould be moderate if such freedom were granted. (17) Still we cannot deny\nthat authority may be as much injured by words as by actions; hence,\nalthough the freedom we are discussing cannot be entirely denied to\nsubjects, its unlimited concession would be most baneful; we must,\ntherefore, now inquire, how far such freedom can and ought to be conceded\nwithout danger to the peace of the state, or the power of the rulers; and\nthis, as I said at the beginning of Chapter XVI., is my principal object.\n(18) It follows, plainly, from the explanation given above, of the\nfoundations of a state, that the ultimate aim of government is not to\nrule, or restrain, by fear, nor to exact obedience, but contrariwise, to\nfree every man from fear, that he may live in all possible security; in\nother words, to strengthen his natural right to exist and work without\ninjury to himself or others.\n(20:19) No, the object of government is not to change men from rational\nbeings into beasts or puppets, but to enable them to develope their minds\nand bodies in security, and to employ their reason unshackled; neither\nshowing hatred, anger, or deceit, nor watched with the eyes of jealousy and\ninjustice. (20) In fact, the true aim of government is liberty.\n(20:21) Now we have seen that in forming a state the power of making laws\nmust either be vested in the body of the citizens, or in a portion of them,\nor in one man. (22) For, although men's free judgments are very diverse, each\none thinking that he alone knows everything, and although complete unanimity\nof feeling and speech is out of the question, it is impossible to preserve\npeace, unless individuals abdicate their right of acting entirely on their\nown judgment. [20:3] (23) Therefore, the individual justly cedes the right\nof free action, though not of free reason and judgment; no one can act\nagainst the authorities without danger to the state, though his feelings and\njudgment may be at variance therewith; he may even speak against them,\nprovided that he does so from rational conviction, not from fraud, anger, or\nhatred, and provided that he does not attempt to introduce any change on his\nprivate authority.\n(20:24) For instance, supposing a man shows that a law is repugnant to sound\nreason, and should therefore be repealed; if he submits his opinion to the\njudgment of the authorities (who, alone, have the right of making and\nrepealing laws), and meanwhile acts in nowise contrary to that law, he has\ndeserved well of the state, and has behaved as a good citizen should; but if\nhe accuses the authorities of injustice, and stirs up the people against\nthem, or if he seditiously strives to abrogate the law without their\nconsent, he is a mere agitator and rebel.\n(20:25) Thus we see how an individual may declare and teach what he\nbelieves, without injury to the authority of his rulers, or to the public\npeace; namely, by leaving in their hands the entire power of legislation as\nit affects action, and by doing nothing against their laws, though he\nbe compelled often to act in contradiction to what he believes, and\nopenly feels, to be best.\n(20:26) Such a course can be taken without detriment to justice and\ndutifulness, nay, it is the one which a just and dutiful man would adopt.\n(27) We have shown that justice is dependent on the laws of the authorities,\nso that no one who contravenes their accepted decrees can be just, while the\nhighest regard for duty, as we have pointed out in the preceding chapter, is\nexercised in maintaining public peace and tranquillity; these could not be\npreserved if every man were to live as he pleased; therefore it is no less\nthan undutiful for a man to act contrary to his country's laws, for if the\npractice became universal the ruin of states would necessarily follow.\n(20:28) Hence, so long as a man acts in obedience to the laws of his rulers,\nhe in nowise contravenes his reason, for in obedience to reason he\ntransferred the right of controlling his actions from his own hands to\ntheirs. (29) This doctrine we can confirm from actual custom, for in a\nconference of great and small powers, schemes are seldom carried\nunanimously, yet all unite in carrying out what is decided on, whether they\nvoted for or against. (30) But I return to my proposition.\n(20:31) From the fundamental notions of a state, we have discovered how a\nman may exercise free judgment without detriment to the supreme power: from\nthe same premises we can no less easily determine what opinions would be\nseditious. (32) Evidently those which by their very nature nullify the\ncompact by which the right of free action was ceded. (33) For instance, a\nman who holds that the supreme power has no rights over him, or that\npromises ought not to be kept, or that everyone should live as he pleases,\nor other doctrines of this nature in direct opposition to the\nabove-mentioned contract, is seditious, not so much from his actual opinions\nand judgment, as from the deeds which they involve; for he who maintains\nsuch theories abrogates the contract which tacitly, or openly, he made with\nhis rulers. (34) Other opinions which do not involve acts violating the\ncontract, such as revenge, anger, and the like, are not seditious, unless\nit be in some corrupt state, where superstitious and ambitious persons,\nunable to endure men of learning, are so popular with the multitude\nthat their word is more valued than the law.\n(20:35) However, I do not deny that there are some doctrines which, while\nthey are apparently only concerned with abstract truths and falsehoods, are\nyet propounded and published with unworthy motives. (36) This question we\nhave discussed in Chapter XV., and shown that reason should nevertheless\nremain unshackled. (37) If we hold to the principle that a man's loyalty to\nthe state should be judged, like his loyalty to God, from his actions only -\nnamely, from his charity towards his neighbours; we cannot doubt that the\nbest government will allow freedom of philosophical speculation no less than\nof religious belief. (38) I confess that from such freedom inconveniences\nmay sometimes arise, but what question was ever settled so wisely that no\nabuses could possibly spring therefrom? (39) He who seeks to regulate\neverything by law, is more likely to arouse vices than to reform them. (40)\nIt is best to grant what cannot be abolished, even though it be in itself\nharmful. (41) How many evils spring from luxury, envy, avarice, drunkenness,\nand the like, yet these are tolerated - vices as they are - because they\ncannot be prevented by legal enactments. (42) How much more then should free\nthought be granted, seeing that it is in itself a virtue and that it cannot\nbe crushed! (43) Besides, the evil results can easily be checked, as I will\nshow, by the secular authorities, not to mention that such freedom\nis absolutely necessary for progress in science and the liberal arts: for no\nman follows such pursuits to advantage unless his judgment be entirely free\nand unhampered.\n(20:44) But let it be granted that freedom may be crushed, and men be so\nbound down, that they do not dare to utter a whisper, save at the bidding of\ntheir rulers; nevertheless this can never be carried to the pitch of making\nthem think according to authority, so that the necessary consequences would\nbe that men would daily be thinking one thing and saying another, to the\ncorruption of good faith, that mainstay of government, and to the fostering\nof hateful flattery and perfidy, whence spring stratagems, and the\ncorruption of every good art.\n(20:45) It is far from possible to impose uniformity of speech, for the more\nrulers strive to curtail freedom of speech, the more obstinately are\nthey resisted; not indeed by the avaricious, the flatterers, and other\nnumskulls, who think supreme salvation consists in filling their stomachs\nand gloating over their money-bags, but by those whom good education, sound\nmorality, and virtue have rendered more free. (46) Men, as generally\nconstituted, are most prone to resent the branding as criminal of opinions\nwhich they believe to be true, and the proscription as wicked of that which\ninspires them with piety towards God and man; hence they are ready to\nforswear the laws and conspire against the authorities, thinking it not\nshameful but honourable to stir up seditions and perpetuate any sort of\ncrime with this end in view. (47) Such being the constitution of human\nnature, we see that laws directed against opinions affect the generous\nminded rather than the wicked, and are adapted less for coercing criminals\nthan for irritating the upright; so that they cannot be maintained without\ngreat peril to the state.\n(20:48) Moreover, such laws are almost always useless, for those who hold\nthat the opinions proscribed are sound, cannot possibly obey the law;\nwhereas those who already reject them as false, accept the law as a kind of\nprivilege, and make such boast of it, that authority is powerless to repeal\nit, even if such a course be subsequently desired.\n(20:49) To these considerations may be added what we said in Chapter XVIII.\nin treating of the history of the Hebrews. (50) And, lastly, how many\nschisms have arisen in the Church from the attempt of the authorities to\ndecide by law the intricacies of theological controversy! (51) If men were\nnot allured by the hope of getting the law and the authorities on their\nside, of triumphing over their adversaries in the sight of an applauding\nmultitude, and of acquiring honourable distinctions, they would not strive\nso maliciously, nor would such fury sway their minds. (52) This is taught\nnot only by reason but by daily examples, for laws of this kind prescribing\nwhat every man shall believe and forbidding anyone to speak or write to the\ncontrary, have often been passed, as sops or concessions to the anger of\nthose who cannot tolerate men of enlightenment, and who, by such harsh and\ncrooked enactments, can easily turn the devotion of the masses into fury and\ndirect it against whom they will. (53) How much better would it be\nto restrain popular anger and fury, instead of passing useless laws,\nwhich can only be broken by those who love virtue and the liberal arts, thus\nparing down the state till it is too small to harbour men of talent. (54)\nWhat greater misfortune for a state can be conceived then that honourable\nmen should be sent like criminals into exile, because they hold diverse\nopinions which they cannot disguise? (55) What, I say, can be more hurtful\nthan that men who have committed no crime or wickedness should, simply\nbecause they are enlightened, be treated as enemies and put to death, and\nthat the scaffold, the terror of evil-doers, should become the arena where\nthe highest examples of tolerance and virtue are displayed to the\npeople with all the marks of ignominy that authority can devise?\n(20:56) He that knows himself to be upright does not fear the death of a\ncriminal, and shrinks from no punishment; his mind is not wrung with\nremorse for any disgraceful deed: he holds that death in a good cause\nis no punishment, but an honour, and that death for freedom is glory.\n(20:57) What purpose then is served by the death of such men, what example\nin proclaimed? the cause for which they die is unknown to the idle and the\nfoolish, hateful to the turbulent, loved by the upright. (58) The only\nlesson we can draw from such scenes is to flatter the persecutor, or else to\nimitate the victim.\n(20:58) If formal assent is not to be esteemed above conviction, and if\ngovernments are to retain a firm hold of authority and not be compelled to\nyield to agitators, it is imperative that freedom of judgment should be\ngranted, so that men may live together in harmony, however diverse, or\neven openly contradictory their opinions may be. (59) We cannot doubt that\nsuch is the best system of government and open to the fewest objections,\nsince it is the one most in harmony with human nature. (60) In a democracy\n(the most natural form of government, as we have shown in Chapter XVI.)\neveryone submits to the control of authority over his actions, but not over\nhis judgment and reason; that is, seeing that all cannot think alike, the\nvoice of the majority has the force of law, subject to repeal if\ncircumstances bring about a change of opinion. (61) In proportion as the\npower of free judgment is withheld we depart from the natural\ncondition of mankind, and consequently the government becomes more\ntyrannical.\n[20:4] (62) In order to prove that from such freedom no inconvenience\narises, which cannot easily be checked by the exercise of the sovereign\npower, and that men's actions can easily be kept in bounds, though their\nopinions be at open variance, it will be well to cite an example. (63) Such\nan one is not very, far to seek. (64) The city of Amsterdam reaps the fruit\nof this freedom in its own great prosperity and in the admiration of all\nother people. (65) For in this most flourishing state, and most splendid\ncity, men of every nation and religion live together in the greatest\nharmony, and ask no questions before trusting their goods to a\nfellow-citizen, save whether he be rich or poor, and whether he generally\nacts honestly, or the reverse. (66) His religion and sect is considered of\nno importance: for it has no effect before the judges in gaining or losing\na cause, and there is no sect so despised that its followers, provided that\nthey harm no one, pay every man his due, and live uprightly, are deprived\nof the protection of the magisterial authority.\n(20:67) On the other hand, when the religious controversy between\nRemonstrants and Counter-Remonstrants began to be taken up by politicians\nand the States, it grew into a schism, and abundantly showed that laws\ndealing with religion and seeking to settle its controversies are much more\ncalculated to irritate than to reform, and that they give rise to extreme\nlicence: further, it was seen that schisms do not originate in a love of\ntruth, which is a source of courtesy and gentleness, but rather in an\ninordinate desire for supremacy, (68) From all these considerations it is\nclearer than the sun at noonday, that the true schismatics are those who\ncondemn other men's writings, and seditiously stir up the quarrelsome masses\nagainst their authors, rather than those authors themselves, who generally\nwrite only for the learned, and appeal solely to reason. (69) In fact, the\nreal disturbers of the peace are those who, in a free state, seek to curtail\nthe liberty of judgment which they are unable to tyrannize over.\n(20:70) I have thus shown:-\n(71) I. That it is impossible to deprive men of the liberty of saying what\nthey think.\n(72) II. That such liberty can be conceded to every man without injury\nto the rights and authority of the sovereign power, and that every man\nmay retain it without injury to such rights, provided that he does not\npresume upon it to the extent of introducing any new rights into the\nstate, or acting in any way contrary, to the existing laws.\n(20:73) III. That every man may enjoy this liberty without detriment to the\npublic peace, and that no inconveniences arise therefrom which cannot easily\nbe checked.\n(74) IV. That every man may enjoy it without injury to his allegiance.\n(75) V. That laws dealing with speculative problems are entirely useless.\n(76) VI. Lastly, that not only may such liberty be granted without prejudice\nto the public peace, to loyalty, and to the rights of rulers, but that it is\neven necessary, for their preservation. (77) For when people try to take it\naway, and bring to trial, not only the acts which alone are capable of\noffending, but also the opinions of mankind, they only succeed in\nsurrounding their victims with an appearance of martyrdom, and raise\nfeelings of pity and revenge rather than of terror. (78) Uprightness and\ngood faith are thus corrupted, flatterers and traitors are encouraged, and\nsectarians triumph, inasmuch as concessions have been made to their\nanimosity, and they have gained the state sanction for the doctrines of\nwhich they are the interpreters. (79) Hence they arrogate to themselves the\nstate authority and rights, and do not scruple to assert that they have been\ndirectly chosen by God, and that their laws are Divine, whereas the laws of\nthe state are human, and should therefore yield obedience to the laws of God\n- in other words, to their own laws. (80) Everyone must see that this is not\na state of affairs conducive to public welfare. (81) Wherefore, as we have\nshown in Chapter XVIII., the safest way for a state is to lay down the rule\nthat religion is comprised solely in the exercise of charity and justice,\nand that the rights of rulers in sacred, no less than in secular matters,\nshould merely have to do with actions, but that every man should think what\nhe likes and say what he thinks.\n(20:82) I have thus fulfilled the task I set myself in this treatise.\n[20:5] (83) It remains only to call attention to the fact that I have\nwritten nothing which I do not most willingly submit to the examination and\napproval of my country's rulers; and that I am willing to retract anything\nwhich they shall decide to be repugnant to the laws, or prejudicial to the\npublic good. (84) I know that I am a man, and as a man liable to error, but\nagainst error I have taken scrupulous care, and have striven to keep in\nentire accordance with the laws of my country, with loyalty, and with\nmorality.\nEnd of Part 4 of 4.\nAUTHOR'S ENDNOTES TO THE THEOLOGICO-POLITICAL TREATISE\nCHAPTER XVI.\n[Endnote 26]. (1) \"No one can honestly promise to forego the right which\nhe has over all things.\" (2) In the state of social life, where general\nright determines what is good or evil, stratagem is rightly distinguished as\nof two kinds, good and evil. (3) But in the state of Nature, where every man\nis his own judge, possessing the absolute right to lay down laws for\nhimself, to interpret them as he pleases, or to abrogate them if he thinks\nit convenient, it is not conceivable that stratagem should be evil.\n[Endnote 27]. (1) \"Every member of it may, if he will, be free.\" (2)\nWhatever be the social state a man finds himself in, he may be free. (3)\nFor certainly a man is free, in so far as he is led by reason. (4) Now\nreason (though Hobbes thinks otherwise) is always on the side of peace,\nwhich cannot be attained unless the general laws of the state be respected.\n(5) Therefore the more he is free, the more constantly will he respect the\nlaws of his country, and obey the commands of the sovereign power to which\nhe is subject.\n[Endnote 28]. (1) \"No one knows by nature that he owes any obedience to\nGod.\" (2) When Paul says that men have in themselves no refuge, he speaks as\na man: for in the ninth chapter of the same epistle he expressly teaches\nthat God has mercy on whom He will, and that men are without excuse, only\nbecause they are in God's power like clay in the hands of a potter, who out\nof the same lump makes vessels, some for honour and some for dishonour, not\nbecause they have been forewarned. (3) As regards the Divine natural law\nwhereof the chief commandment is, as we have said, to love God, I have\ncalled it a law in the same sense, as philosophers style laws those general\nrules of nature, according to which everything happens. (4) For the love of\nGod is not a state of obedience: it is a virtue which necessarily exists in\na man who knows God rightly. (5) Obedience has regard to the will of a\nruler, not to necessity and truth. (6) Now as we are ignorant of the nature\nof God's will, and on the other hand know that everything happens solely by\nGod's power, we cannot, except through revelation, know whether God wishes\nin any way to be honoured as a sovereign.\n(7) Again; we have shown that the Divine rights appear to us in the light of\nrights or commands, only so long as we are ignorant of their cause: as soon\nas their cause is known, they cease to be rights, and we embrace them no\nlonger as rights but as eternal truths; in other words, obedience passes\ninto love of God, which emanates from true knowledge as necessarily as\nlight emanates from the sun. (8) Reason then leads us to love God, but\ncannot lead us to obey Him; for we cannot embrace the commands of God as\nDivine, while we are in ignorance of their cause, neither can we rationally\nconceive God as a sovereign laying down laws as a sovereign.\nCHAPTER XVII.\n[Endnote 29]. (1) \"If men could lose their natural rights so as to be\nabsolutely unable for the future to oppose the will of the sovereign\" (2)\nTwo common soldiers undertook to change the Roman dominion, and did change\nit. (Tacitus, Hist. i:7.)\n[Endnote 30]. (1) See Numbers xi. 28. In this passage it is written that\ntwo men prophesied in the camp, and that Joshua wished to punish them. (2)\nThis he would not have done, if it had been lawful for anyone to deliver the\nDivine oracles to the people without the consent of Moses. (3) But Moses\nthought good to pardon the two men, and rebuked Joshua for exhorting him to\nuse his royal prerogative, at a time when he was so weary of reigning, that\nhe preferred death to holding undivided sway (Numb. xi:14). (4) For he made\nanswer to Joshua, \"Enviest thou for my sake? (5) Would God that all the\nLord's people were prophets, and that the Lord would put His spirit upon\nthem.\" (6) That is to say, would God that the right of taking counsel of God\nwere general, and the power were in the hands of the people. (7) Thus Joshua\nwas not mistaken as to the right, but only as to the time for using it, for\nwhich he was rebuked by Moses, in the same way as Abishai was rebuked by\nDavid for counselling that Shimei, who had undoubtedly been guilty of\ntreason, should be put to death. (8) See 2 Sam. xix:22, 23.\n[Endnote 31]. (1) See Numbers xxvii:21. (2) The translators of the Bible\nhave rendered incorrectly verses 19 and 23 of this chapter. (3) The passage\ndoes not mean that Moses gave precepts or advice to Joshua, but that he made\nor established him chief of the Hebrews. (4) The phrase is very frequent in\nScripture (see Exodus, xviii:23; 1 Sam. xiii:15; Joshua i:9; 1 Sam.\nxxv:80).\n[Endnote 32] (1) \"There was no judge over each of the captains save\nGod.\" (2) The Rabbis and some Christians equally foolish pretend that the\nSanhedrin, called \"the great\" was instituted by Moses. (3) As a matter of\nfact, Moses chose seventy colleagues to assist him in governing, because he\nwas not able to bear alone the burden of the whole people; but he\nnever passed any law for forming a college of seventy members; on the\ncontrary he ordered every tribe to appoint for itself, in the cities which\nGod had given it, judges to settle disputes according to the laws which he\nhimself had laid down. (4) In cases where the opinions of the judges\ndiffered as to the interpretation of these laws, Moses bade them take\ncounsel of the High Priest (who was the chief interpreter of the law), or of\nthe chief judge, to whom they were then subordinate (who had the right of\nconsulting the High Priest), and to decide the dispute in accordance with\nthe answer obtained. (5) If any subordinate judge should assert, that he was\nnot bound by the decision of the High Priest, received either directly or\nthrough the chief of his state, such an one was to be put to death (Deut.\nxvii:9) by the chief judge, whoever he might be, to whom he was a\nsubordinate. (6) This chief judge would either be Joshua, the supreme\ncaptain of the whole people, or one of the tribal chiefs who had been\nentrusted, after the division of the tribes, with the right of consulting\nthe high priest concerning the affairs of his tribe, of deciding on peace or\nwar, of fortifying towns, of appointing inferior judges, &c. (7) Or, again,\nit might be the king, in whom all or some of the tribes had vested their\nrights.\n(8) I could cite many instances in confirmation of what I here advance. (9) I\nwill confine myself to one, which appears to me the most important of all. (10)\nWhen the Shilomitish prophet anointed Jeroboam king, he, in so doing, gave him\nthe right of consulting the high priest, of appointing judges, &c. (11) In fact\nhe endowed him with all the rights over the ten tribes, which Rehoboam retained\nover the two tribes. (12) Consequently Jeroboam could set up a supreme council\nin his court with as much right as Jehoshaphat could at Jerusalem (2 Chron.\nxix:8). (13) For it is plain that neither Jeroboam, who was king by God's\ncommand, nor Jeroboam's subjects, were bound by the Law of Moses to accept the\njudgments of Rehoboam, who was not their king. (14) Still less were they under\nthe jurisdiction of the judge, whom Rehoboam had set up in Jerusalem as\nsubordinate to himself. (15) According, therefore, as the Hebrew dominion was\ndivided, so was a supreme council set up in each division. (16) Those who\nneglect the variations in the constitution of the Hebrew States, and confuse\nthem all together in one, fall into numerous difficulties.\nCHAPTER XIX.\n[Endnote 33].

Taken from Curley, Note 3, at end)\n*This Treatise on the Emendation of the Intellect etc., which we\ngive you here, kind reader, in its unfinished [that is, defective]\nstate, was written by the author many years ago now. He always\nintended to finish it. But hindered by other occupations, and\nfinally snatched away by death, he was unable to bring it to the\ndesired conclusion. But since it contains many excellent and useful\nthings, which--we have no doubt--will be of great benefit to\nanyone sincerely seeking the truth, we did not wish to deprive you\nof them. And so that you would be aware of, and find less difficult\nto excuse, the many things that are still obscure, rough, and\nunpolished, we wished to warn you of them. Farewell.*\n[1]  (1) After experience had taught me that all the usual\nsurroundings of social life are vain and futile; seeing that none\nof the objects of my fears contained in themselves anything either\ngood or bad, except in so far as the mind is affected by them,\nI finally resolved to inquire whether there might be some real\ngood having power to communicate itself, which would affect the\nmind singly, to the exclusion of all else: whether, in fact, there\nmight be anything of which the discovery and attainment would\nenable me to enjoy continuous, supreme, and unending happiness.\n[2]  (1) I say \"I finally resolved,\" for at first sight it seemed\nunwise willingly to lose hold on what was sure for the sake of\nsomething then uncertain.  (2) I could see the benefits which are\nacquired through fame and riches, and that I should be obliged to\nabandon the quest of such objects, if I seriously devoted myself\nto the search for something different and new.  (3) I perceived\nthat if true happiness chanced to be placed in the former I should\nnecessarily miss it; while if, on the other hand, it were not so\nplaced, and I gave them my whole attention, I should equally fail.\n[3]  (1) I therefore debated whether it would not be possible to\narrive at the new principle, or at any rate at a certainty\nconcerning its existence, without changing the conduct and usual\nplan of my life; with this end in view I made many efforts,\nin vain.  (2) For the ordinary surroundings of life which are\nesteemed by men (as their actions testify) to be the highest\ngood, may be classed under the three heads--Riches, Fame, and\nthe Pleasures of Sense: with these three the mind is so absorbed\nthat it has little power to reflect on any different good.\n[4]  (1) By sensual pleasure the mind is enthralled to the extent\nof quiescence, as if the supreme good were actually attained, so\nthat it is quite incapable of thinking of any other object; when\nsuch pleasure has been gratified it is followed by extreme\nmelancholy, whereby the mind, though not enthralled, is disturbed\nand dulled.  (2) The pursuit of honors and riches is likewise very\nabsorbing, especially if such objects be sought simply for their\nown sake, [a] inasmuch as they are then supposed to constitute the\nhighest good.\n[5]  (1) In the case of fame the mind is still more absorbed, for fame\nis conceived as always good for its own sake, and as the ultimate end\nto which all actions are directed.  (2) Further, the attainment of\nriches and fame is not followed as in the case of sensual pleasures by\nrepentance, but, the more we acquire, the greater is our delight, and,\nconsequently, the more are we incited to increase both the one and the\nother; on the other hand, if our hopes happen to be frustrated we are\nplunged into the deepest sadness.  (3) Fame has the further drawback\nthat it compels its votaries to order their lives according to the\nopinions of their fellow-men, shunning what they usually shun, and\nseeking what they usually seek.\n[6]  (1) When I saw that all these ordinary objects of desire would\nbe obstacles in the way of a search for something different and new--nay,\nthat they were so opposed thereto, that either they or it would\nhave to be abandoned, I was forced to inquire which would prove the\nmost useful to me: for, as I say, I seemed to be willingly losing\nhold on a sure good for the sake of something uncertain.  (6:2) However,\nafter I had reflected on the matter, I came in the first place to the\nconclusion that by abandoning the ordinary objects of pursuit, and\nbetaking myself to a new quest, I should be leaving a good, uncertain\nby reason of its own nature, as may be gathered from what has been\nsaid, for the sake of a good not uncertain in its nature (for I sought\nfor a fixed good), but only in the possibility of its attainment.\n[7] (1) Further reflection convinced me that if I could really get\nto the root of the matter I should be leaving certain evils for a\ncertain good.  (2) I thus perceived that I was in a state of great\nperil, and I compelled myself to seek with all my strength for a\nremedy, however uncertain it might be; as a sick man struggling with\na deadly disease, when he sees that death will surely be upon him\nunless a remedy be found, is compelled to seek a remedy with all his\nstrength, inasmuch as his whole hope lies therein.  (7:3) All the\nobjects pursued by the multitude not only bring no remedy that tends\nto preserve our being, but even act as hindrances, causing the death\nnot seldom of those who possess them, [b] and always of those who\nare possessed by them.\n[8]  (1) There are many examples of men who have suffered persecution\neven to death for the sake of their riches, and of men who in pursuit\nof wealth have exposed themselves to so many dangers, that they have\npaid away their life as a penalty for their folly.  (2) Examples are\nno less numerous of men, who have endured the utmost wretchedness for\nthe sake of gaining or preserving their reputation.  (3) Lastly,\nare innumerable cases of men, who have hastened their death through\nover-indulgence in sensual pleasure.\n[9]  (1) All these evils seem to have arisen from the fact, that\nhappiness or unhappiness is made wholly dependent on the quality of the\nobject which we love.  (2) When a thing is not loved, no quarrels will\narise concerning it--no sadness will be felt if it perishes--no envy if\nit is possessed by another--no fear, no hatred, in short no disturbances\nof the mind. (3) All these arise from the love of what is perishable,\nsuch as the objects already mentioned.\n[10]  (1) But love towards a thing eternal and infinite feeds the\nmind wholly with joy, and is itself unmingled with any sadness,\nwherefore it is greatly to be desired and sought for with all our\nstrength.  (2) Yet it was not at random that I used the words,\n\"If I could go to the root of the matter,\" for, though what I have\nurged was perfectly clear to my mind, I could not forthwith lay\naside all love of riches, sensual enjoyment, and fame.\n[11]  (1) One thing was evident, namely, that while my mind was\nemployed with these thoughts it turned away from its former objects\nof desire, and seriously considered the search for a new principle;\nthis state of things was a great comfort to me, for I perceived\nthat the evils were not such as to resist all remedies.  (11:2) Although\nthese intervals were at first rare, and of very short duration, yet\nafterwards, as the true good became more and more discernible to me,\nthey became more frequent and more lasting; especially after I had\nrecognized that the acquisition of wealth, sensual pleasure, or fame,\nis only a hindrance, so long as they are sought as ends not as means;\nif they be sought as means, they will be under restraint, and, far\nfrom being hindrances, will further not a little the end for which\nthey are sought, as I will show in due time.\n[12]  (1) I will here only briefly state what I mean by true good,\nand also what is the nature of the highest good. (2) In order that\nthis may be rightly understood, we must bear in mind that the terms\ngood and evil are only applied relatively, so that the same thing\nmay be called both good and bad according to the relations in view,\nin the same way as it may be called perfect or imperfect.\n(3) Nothing regarded in its own nature can be called perfect or\nimperfect; especially when we are aware that all things which come\nto pass, come to pass according to the eternal order and fixed\nlaws of nature.\n[13]  (1) However, human weakness cannot attain to this order in its\nown thoughts, but meanwhile man conceives a human character much more\nstable than his own, and sees that there is no reason why he should\nnot himself acquire such a character.  (2) Thus he is led to seek\nfor means which will bring him to this pitch of perfection, and\ncalls everything which will serve as such means a true good.\n(13:3) The chief good is that he should arrive, together with other\nindividuals if possible, at the possession of the aforesaid\ncharacter.  (4) What that character is we shall show in due time,\nnamely, that it is the knowledge of the union existing being\nthe mind and the whole of nature. [c]\n[14]  (1) This, then, is the end for which I strive, to attain to\nsuch a character myself, and to endeavor that many should attain to\nit with me.  (2) In other words, it is part of my happiness to lend\na helping hand, that many others may understand even as I do, so\nthat their understanding and desire may entirely agree with my own.\n(3) In order to bring this about, it is necessary to understand as\nmuch of nature as will enable us to attain to the aforesaid character,\nand  also to form a social order such as is most conducive to the\nattainment of this character by the greatest number with the least\ndifficulty and danger.\n[15]  (1) We must seek the assistance of Moral Philosophy [d] and\nthe Theory of Education; further, as health is no insignificant means\nfor attaining our end, we must also include the whole science of\nMedicine, and, as many difficult things are by contrivance rendered\neasy, and we can in this way gain much time and convenience, the\nscience of Mechanics must in no way be despised.\n[16]  (1) But before all things, a means must be devised for\nimproving the understanding and purifying it, as far as may be at\nthe outset, so that it may apprehend things without error, and in\nthe best possible way.  (2) Thus it is apparent to everyone that I\nwish to direct all science to one end [e] and aim, so that we may\nattain to the supreme human perfection which we have named; and,\ntherefore, whatsoever in the sciences does not serve to promote\nour object will have to be rejected as useless.  (3) To sum up the\nmatter in a word, all our actions and thoughts must be directed to\nthis one end.\n[17]  (1) Yet, as it is necessary that while we are endeavoring to\nattain our purpose, and bring the understanding into the right path\nwe should carry on our life, we are compelled first of all to lay\ndown certain rules of life as provisionally good, to wit the\nfollowing:--\nI.  (2) To speak in a manner intelligible to the multitude, and to\ncomply with every general custom that does not hinder the\nattainment of our purpose.  (3) For we can gain from the multitude\nno small advantages, provided that we strive to accommodate\nourselves to its understanding as far as possible: moreover,\nwe shall in this way gain a friendly audience for the reception\nof the truth.\nII. (17:4) To indulge ourselves with pleasures only in so far as they\nare necessary for preserving health.\nIII. (5) Lastly, to endeavor to obtain only sufficient money or other\ncommodities to enable us to preserve our life and health, and to\nfollow such general customs as are consistent with our purpose.\n[18]  (1) Having laid down these preliminary rules, I will betake\nmyself to the first and most important task, namely, the amendment\nof the understanding, and the rendering it capable of understanding\nthings in the manner necessary for attaining our end.  (2) In order\nto bring this about, the natural order demands that I should here\nrecapitulate all the modes of perception, which I have hitherto\nemployed for affirming or denying anything with certainty, so that\nI may choose the best, and at the same time begin to know my own\npowers and the nature which I wish to perfect.\n[19] (1) Reflection shows that all modes of perception or knowledge\nmay be reduced to four:--\nI. (2) Perception arising from hearsay or from some sign which\neveryone may name as he please.\nII. (3) Perception arising from mere experience--that is, form\nexperience not yet classified by the intellect, and only so called\nbecause the given event has happened to take place, and we have no\ncontradictory fact to set against it, so that it therefore remains\nunassailed in our minds.\nIII. (19:4) Perception arising when the essence of one thing is inferred\nfrom another thing, but not adequately; this comes when [f] from some\neffect we gather its cause, or when it is inferred from some general\nproposition that some property is  always present.\nIV. (5) Lastly, there is the perception arising when a thing is\nperceived solely through its essence, or through the knowledge\nof its proximate cause.\n[20] (1) All these kinds of perception I will illustrate by examples.\n(2) By hearsay I know the day of my birth, my parentage, and other\nmatters about which I have never felt any doubt.  (3) By mere\nexperience I know that I shall die, for this I can affirm from\nhaving seen that others like myself have died, though all did not\nlive for the same period, or die by the same disease.  (4) I know\nby mere experience that oil has the property of feeding fire, and\nwater of extinguishing it.  (5) In the same way I know that a dog\nis a barking animal, man a rational animal, and in fact nearly all\nthe practical knowledge of life.\n[21]  (1) We deduce one thing from another as follows: when we\nclearly perceive that we feel a certain body and no other, we\nthence clearly infer that the mind is united [g] to the body,\nand that their union is the cause of the given sensation; but\nwe cannot thence absolutely understand [h] the nature of the\nsensation and the union.  (2) Or, after I have become acquainted\nwith the nature of vision, and know that it has the property of\nmaking one and the same thing appear smaller when far off than\nwhen near, I can infer that the sun is larger than it appears,\nand can draw other conclusions of the same kind.\n[22]  (1) Lastly, a thing may be perceived solely through its essence;\nwhen, from the fact of knowing something, I know what it is to know\nthat thing, or when, from knowing the essence of the mind, I know\nthat it is united to the body.  (2) By the same kind of knowledge\nwe know that two and three make five, or that two lines each parallel\nto a third, are parallel to one another, &c. (3) The things which I\nhave been able to know by this kind of knowledge are as yet very few.\n[23]  (1) In order that the whole matter may be put in a clearer\nlight, I will make use of a single illustration as follows.\n(2) Three numbers are given--it is required to find a fourth,\nwhich shall be to the third as the second is to the first.\n(23:3) Tradesmen will at once tell us that they know what is required\nto find the fourth number, for they have not yet forgotten the rule\nwhich was given to them arbitrarily without proof by their masters;\nothers construct a universal axiom from their experience with simple\nnumbers, where the fourth number is self-evident, as in the case of\n2, 4, 3, 6; here it is evident that if the second number be\nmultiplied by the third, and the product divided by the first,\nthe quotient is 6; when they see that by this process the number\nis produced which they knew beforehand to be the proportional,\nthey infer that the process always holds good for finding a fourth\nnumber proportional.\n[24]  (1) Mathematicians, however, know by the proof of the nineteenth\nproposition of the seventh book of Euclid, what numbers are\nproportionals, namely, from the nature and property of proportion\nit follows that the product of the first and fourth will be equal\nto the product of the second and third: still they do not see the\nadequate proportionality of the given numbers, or, if they do see it,\nthey see it not by virtue of Euclid's proposition, but intuitively,\nwithout going through any process.\n[25] (1) In order that from these modes of perception the best may\nbe selected, it is well that we should briefly enumerate the means\nnecessary for attaining our end.\nI.  (2) To have an exact knowledge of our nature which we desire to\nperfect, and to know as much as is needful of nature in general.\nII. To collect in this way the differences, the agreements, and the\noppositions of things.\nIII. To learn thus exactly how far they can or cannot be modified.\nIV. To compare this result with the nature and power of man.\n(4) We shall thus discern the highest degree of perfection\nto which man is capable of attaining.\n[26] (1) We shall then be in a position to see which mode of\nperception we ought to choose.  (2) As to the first mode, it is\nevident that from hearsay our knowledge must always be uncertain,\nand, moreover, can give us no insight into the essence of a thing,\nas is manifest in our illustration; now one can only arrive at\nknowledge of a thing through knowledge of its essence, as will\nhereafter appear.  (3) We may, therefore clearly conclude that\nthe certainty arising from hearsay cannot be scientific in its\ncharacter.  (4) For simple hearsay cannot affect anyone whose\nunderstanding does not, so to speak, meet it half way.\n[27]  (1) The second mode of perception [i] cannot be said to\ngive us the idea of the proportion of which we are in search.\n(2) Moreover its results are very uncertain and indefinite,\nfor we shall never discover anything in natural phenomena by its\nmeans, except accidental properties, which are never clearly\nunderstood, unless the essence of the things in question be\nknown first.  (3) Wherefore this mode also must be rejected.\n[28] (1) Of the third mode of perception we may say in a manner\nthat it gives us the idea of the thing sought, and that it\nus to draw conclusions without risk of error; yet it is not by\nitself sufficient to put us in possession of the perfection we\naim at.\n[29] (1) The fourth mode alone apprehends the adequate essence of\na thing without danger of error.  (2) This mode, therefore, must be\nthe one which we chiefly employ.  (3) How, then, should we avail\nourselves of it so as to gain the fourth kind of knowledge with\nthe least delay concerning things previously unknown?  (4) I will\nproceed to explain.\n[30] (1) Now that we know what kind of knowledge is necessary for\nus, we must indicate the way and the method whereby we may gain\nthe said knowledge concerning the things needful to be known.\n(2) In order to accomplish this, we must first take care not to\ncommit ourselves to a search, going back to infinity--that is,\nin order to discover the best method of finding truth, there is\nno need of another method to discover such method; nor of a third\nmethod for discovering the second, and so on to infinity.  (3) By\nsuch proceedings, we should never arrive at the knowledge of the\ntruth, or, indeed, at any knowledge at all.  (30:4) The matter stands\non the same footing as the making of material tools, which might\nbe argued about in a similar way.  (5) For, in order to work iron,\na hammer is needed, and the hammer cannot be forthcoming unless\nit has been made; but, in order to make it, there was need\nof another hammer and other tools, and so on to infinity.\n(6) We might thus vainly endeavor to prove that men have no\npower of working iron.\n[31]  (1) But as men at first made use of the instruments supplied\nby nature to accomplish very easy pieces of workmanship, laboriously\nand imperfectly, and then, when these were finished, wrought other\nthings more difficult with less labour and greater perfection;\nand so gradually mounted from the simplest operations to the making\nof tools, and from the making of tools to the making of more complex\ntools, and fresh feats of workmanship, till they arrived at making,\ncomplicated mechanisms which they now possess.  (31:2) So, in like\nmanner, the intellect, by its native strength, [k], makes for itself\nintellectual instruments, whereby it acquires strength for performing\nother intellectual operations, [l], and from these operations\nagain fresh instruments, or the power of pushing its investigations\nfurther, and thus gradually proceeds till it reaches the summit\nof wisdom.\n[32]  (1) That this is the path pursued by the understanding may be\nreadily seen, when we understand the nature of the method for\nfinding out the truth, and of the natural instruments so necessary\ncomplex instruments, and for the progress of investigation. I thus\nproceed with my demonstration.\n[33]  (1) A true idea, [m], (for we possess a true idea) is something\ndifferent from its correlate (ideatum); thus a circle is different\nfrom the idea of a circle. (2) The idea of a circle is not something\nhaving a circumference and a center, as a circle has; nor is the idea\nof a body that body itself. (3) Now, as it is something different\nfrom its correlate, it is capable of being understood through itself;\nin other words, the idea, in so far as its actual essence (essentia\nformalis) is concerned, may be the subject of another subjective\nessence (essentia objectiva).  [33note1] (4) And, again, this second\nsubjective essence will, regarded in itself, be something real,\ncapable of being understood; and so on, indefinitely.\n[34] (1) For instance, the man Peter is something real; the true\nidea of Peter is the reality of Peter represented subjectively,\nand is in itself something real, and quite distinct from the\nactual Peter.  (2) Now, as this true idea of Peter is in itself\nsomething real, and has its own individual existence, it will\nalso be capable of being understood--that is, of being the\nsubject of another idea, which will contain by representation\n(objective) all that the idea of Peter contains actually\n(formaliter).  (3) And, again, this idea of the idea of Peter\nhas its own individuality, which may become the subject of yet\nanother idea; and so on, indefinitely.  (4) This everyone may\nmake trial of for himself, by reflecting that he knows what\nPeter is, and also knows that he knows, and further knows that\nhe knows that he knows, &c.  (34:5) Hence it is plain that, in\norder to understand the actual Peter, it is not necessary first\nto understand the idea of Peter, and still less the idea of\nthe idea of Peter.  (6) This is the same as saying that, in order\nto know, there is no need to know that we know, much less to\nknow that we know that we know.  (7) This is no more necessary\nthan to know the nature of a circle before knowing the nature of\na triangle. [n].  (8) But, with these ideas, the contrary is the\ncase: for, in order to know that I know, I must first know.\n[35] (1) Hence it is clear that certainty is nothing else than\nthe subjective essence of a thing: in other words, the mode in\nwhich we perceive an actual reality is certainty.  (2) Further,\nit is also evident that, for the certitude of truth, no further\nsign is necessary beyond the possession of a true idea: for,\nas I have shown, it is not necessary to know that we know that\nwe know.  (3) Hence, again, it is clear that no one can know\nthe nature of the highest certainty, unless he possesses an\nadequate idea, or the subjective essence of a thing:\ncertainty is identical with such subjective essence.\n[36]  (1) Thus, as the truth needs no sign--it being to possess\nthe subjective essence of things, or, in other words, the ideas\nof them, in order that all doubts may be removed--it follows\nthat the true method does not consist in seeking for the signs\nof truth after the acquisition of the idea, but that the true\nmethod teaches us the order in which we should seek for truth\nitself, [o] or the subjective essences of things, or ideas,\nfor all these expressions are synonymous.\n[37] (1) Again, method must necessarily be concerned with\nreasoning or understanding--I mean, method is not identical\nwith reasoning in the search for causes, still less is it\nthe comprehension of the causes of things: it is the\ndiscernment of a true idea, by distinguishing it from other\nperceptions, and by investigating its nature, in order that\nwe may so train our mind that it may, by a given standard,\ncomprehend whatsoever is intelligible, by laying down\ncertain rules as aids, and by avoiding useless mental\nexertion.\n[38]  (1) Whence we may gather that method is nothing else\nthan reflective knowledge, or the idea of an idea; and that\nas there can be no idea of an idea--unless an idea exists\npreviously,--there can be no method without a pre-existent\nidea.  (2) Therefore, that will be a good method which\nshows us how the mind should be directed, according to the\nstandard of the given true idea.\n(38:3) Again, seeing that the ratio existing between two\nideas the same as the ratio between the actual realities\ncorresponding to those ideas, it follows that the reflective\nknowledge which has for its object the most perfect being is\nmore excellent than reflective knowledge concerning other\nobjects--in other words, that method will be most perfect\nwhich affords the standard of the given idea of the most\nperfect being whereby we may direct our mind.\n[39] (1) We thus easily understand how, in proportion as it\nacquires new ideas, the mind simultaneously acquires fresh\ninstruments for pursuing its inquiries further. (2) For we\nmay gather from what has been said, that a true idea must\nnecessarily first of all exist in us as a natural instrument;\nand that when this idea is apprehended by the mind, it enables\nus to understand the difference existing between itself and\nall other perceptions.  (3) In this, one part of the method\nconsists.\n(39:4) Now it is clear that the mind apprehends itself better\nin proportion as it understands a greater number of natural\nobjects; it follows, therefore, that this portion of the method\nwill be more perfect in proportion as the mind attains to the\ncomprehension of a greater number of objects, and that it will\nbe absolutely perfect when the mind gains a knowledge of the\nabsolutely perfect being, or becomes conscious thereof.\n[40]  (1) Again, the more things the mind knows, the better does\nit understand its own strength and the order of nature; by\nincreased self-knowledge, it can direct itself more easily, and\nlay down rules for its own guidance; and, by increased knowledge\nof nature, it can more easily avoid what is useless.  (2) And\nthis is the sum total of method, as we have already stated.\n[41]  (1) We may add that the idea in the world of thought is in\nthe same case as its correlate in the world of reality.  (2) If,\ntherefore, there be anything in nature which is without connection\nwith any other thing, and if we assign to it a subjective essence,\nwhich would in every way correspond to the objective reality,\nthe subjective essence would have no connection, [p] with any\nother ideas--in other words, we could not draw any conclusions\nwith regard to it.  (41:3) On the other hand, those things which are\nconnected with others--as all things that exist in nature--will\nbe understood by the mind, and their subjective essences will\nmaintain the same mutual relations as their objective realities--that\nis to say, we shall infer from these ideas other ideas, which\nwill in turn be connected with others, and thus our instruments\nfor proceeding with our investigation will increase.  (4) This is\nwhat we were endeavoring to prove.\n[42]  (1) Further, from what has just been said--namely, that an\nidea must, in all respects, correspond to its correlate in the\nworld of reality,--it is evident that, in order to reproduce in\nevery respect the faithful image of nature, our mind must deduce\nall its ideas from the idea which represents the origin and source\nof the whole of nature, so that it may itself become the source\nof other ideas.\n[43]  (1) It may, perhaps, provoke astonishment that, after having\nsaid that the good method is that which teaches us to direct our\nmind according to the standard of the given true idea, we should\nprove our point by reasoning, which would seem to indicate that it\nis not self-evident.  (2) We may, therefore, be questioned as to\nthe validity of our reasoning.  (3) If our reasoning be sound, we\nmust take as a starting-point a true idea.  (4) Now, to be certain\nthat our starting-point is really a true idea, we need proof.\n(5) This first course of reasoning must be supported by a second,\nthe second by a third, and so on to infinity.\n[44]  (1) To this I make answer that, if by some happy chance anyone\nhad adopted this method in his investigations of nature--that is,\nif he had acquired new ideas in the proper order, according to the\nstandard of the original true idea, he would never have doubted [q]\nof the truth of his knowledge, inasmuch as truth, as we have shown,\nmakes itself manifest, and all things would flow, as it were,\nspontaneously towards him.  (44:2) But as this never, or rarely,\nhappens, I have been forced so to arrange my proceedings, that we\nmay acquire by reflection and forethought what we cannot acquire\nby chance, and that it may at the same time appear that, for\nproving the truth, and for valid reasoning, we need no other means\nthan the truth and valid reasoning themselves: for by valid\nreasoning I have established valid reasoning, and, in like measure,\nI seek still to establish it.\n[45]  (1) Moreover, this is the order of thinking adopted by men\nin their inward meditations.  (2) The reasons for its rare employment\nin investigations of nature are to be found in current misconceptions,\nwhereof we shall examine the causes hereafter in our philosophy.\n(3) Moreover, it demands, as we shall show, a keen and accurate\ndiscernment.  (4) Lastly, it is hindered by the conditions of human\nlife, which are, as we have already pointed out, extremely changeable.\n(5) There are also other obstacles, which we will not here inquire into.\n[46]  (1) If anyone asks why I have not at the starting-point set forth\nall the truths of nature in their due order, inasmuch as truth is\nself-evident, I reply by warning him not to reject as false any\nparadoxes he may find here, but to take the trouble to reflect on\nthe chain of reasoning by which they are supported; he will then\nbe no longer in doubt that we have attained to the truth.\n(2) This is why I have as above.\n[47] (1) If there yet remains some sceptic, who doubts of our\nprimary truth, and of all deductions we make, taking such truth\nas our standard, he must either be arguing in bad faith, or we\nmust confess that there are men in complete mental blindness\neither innate or due to misconceptions--that is, to some external\ninfluence.  (2) Such persons are not conscious of themselves.\n(3) If they affirm or doubt anything, they know not that they\naffirm or doubt: they say that they know nothing, and they say\nthat they are ignorant of the very fact of their knowing nothing.\n(4) Even this they do not affirm absolutely, they are afraid of\nconfessing that they exist, so long as they know nothing;\nin fact, they ought to remain dumb, for fear of haply supposing\nwhich should smack of truth.\n[48]  (1) Lastly, with such persons, one should not speak of\nsciences: for, in what relates to life and conduct, they are\ncompelled by necessity to suppose that they exist, and seek\ntheir own advantage, and often affirm and deny, even with an\noath.  (2) If they deny, grant, or gainsay, they know not that\nthey deny, grant, or gainsay, so that they ought to be\nregarded as automata, utterly devoid of intelligence.\n[49] (1) Let us now return to our proposition.  (2) Up to the present,\nwe have, first, defined the end to which we desire to direct all our\nthoughts; secondly, we have determined the mode of perception best\nadapted to aid us in attaining our perfection; thirdly, we have\ndiscovered the way which our mind should take, in order to make a good\nbeginning--namely, that it should use every true idea as a standard in\npursuing its inquiries according to fixed rules.  (49:3) Now, in order\nthat it may thus proceed, our method must furnish us, first, with a\nmeans of distinguishing a true idea from all other perceptions, and\nenabling the mind to avoid the latter; secondly, with rules for\nperceiving unknown things according to the standard of the true idea;\nthirdly, with an order which enables us to avoid useless labor.\n(49:4) When we became acquainted with this method, we saw that,\nfourthly, it would be perfect when we had attained to the idea of the\nabsolutely perfect Being.  (5) This is an observation which should be\nmade at the outset, in order that we may arrive at the knowledge of\nsuch a being more quickly.\n[50] (1) Let us then make a beginning with the first part of the method,\nwhich is, as we have said, to distinguish and separate the true idea\nfrom other perceptions, and to keep the mind from confusing with true\nideas those which are false, fictitious, and doubtful.  (2) I intend to\ndwell on this point at length, partly to keep a distinction so necessary\nbefore the reader's mind, and also because there are some who doubt of\ntrue ideas, through not having attended to the distinction between a true\nperception and all others.  (3) Such persons are like men who, while they\nare awake, doubt not that they are awake, but afterwards in a dream, as\noften happens, thinking that they are surely awake, and then finding that\nthey were in error, become doubtful even of being awake.  (4) This state\nof mind arises through neglect of the distinction between sleeping and\nwaking.\n[51]  (1) Meanwhile, I give warning that I shall not here give\nessence of every perception, and explain it through its proximate\ncause.  (2) Such work lies in the province of philosophy.  (3) I shall\nconfine myself to what concerns method--that is, to the character of\nfictitious, false and doubtful perceptions, and the means of freeing\nourselves therefrom.  (4) Let us then first inquire into the nature of\na fictitious idea.\n[52]  (1) Every perception has for its object either a thing considered\nas existing, or solely the essence of a thing.  (2) Now \"fiction\" is\nchiefly occupied with things considered as existing.  (3) I will,\ntherefore, consider these first--I mean cases where only the existence\nof an object is feigned, and the thing thus feigned is understood, or\nassumed to be understood.  (4) For instance, I feign that Peter, whom\nI know to have gone home, is gone to see me, [r] or something of that\nkind.  (5) With what is such an idea concerned?  (6) It is concerned\nwith things possible, and not with things necessary or impossible.\n[53] (1) I call a thing impossible when its existence would imply a\ncontradiction; necessary, when its non-existence would imply a\ncontradiction; possible, when neither its existence nor its\nnon-existence imply a contradiction, but when the necessity or\nimpossibility of its nature depends on causes unknown to us, while\nwe feign that it exists.  (2) If the necessity or impossibility of\nits existence depending on external causes were known to us, we\ncould not form any fictitious hypotheses about it;\n[54] (1) Whence it follows that if there be a God, or omniscient\nBeing, such an one cannot form fictitious hypotheses.  (2) For,\nas regards ourselves, when I know that I exist, [s] I cannot\nhypothesize that I exist or do not exist, any more than I can\nhypothesize an elephant that can go through the eye of a needle;\nnor when I know the nature of God, can I hypothesize that He\nor does not exist. [t]  (54:3) The same thing must be said of the\nChimaera, whereof the nature implies a contradiction.  (4) From\nthese considerations, it is plain, as I have already stated, that\nfiction cannot be concerned with eternal truths. [u]\n[55]  (1) But before proceeding further, I must remark, in passing,\nthat the difference between the essence of one thing and the essence\nof another thing is the same as that which exists between the reality\nor existence of one thing and the reality or existence of another;\ntherefore, if we wished to conceive the existence, for example,\nof Adam, simply by means of existence in general, it would be the\nsame as if, in order to conceive his existence, we went back to the\nnature of being, so as to define Adam as a being.  (2) Thus, the more\nexistence is conceived generally, the more is it conceived confusedly\nand the more easily can it be ascribed to a given object.\n(55:3) Contrariwise, the more it is conceived particularly, the more\nis it understood clearly, and the less liable is it to be ascribed,\nthrough negligence of Nature's order, to anything save its proper\nobject.  (4) This is worthy of remark.\n[56]  (1) We now proceed to consider those cases which are commonly\ncalled fictions, though we clearly understood that the thing is not\nas we imagine it.  (2) For instance, I know that the earth is round,\nbut nothing prevents my telling people that it is a hemisphere,\nand that it is like a half apple carved in relief on a dish; or,\nthat the sun moves round the earth, and so on.  (56:3) However,\nexamination will show us that there is nothing here inconsistent\nwith what has been said, provided we first admit that we may have\nmade mistakes, and be now conscious of them; and, further, that we\ncan hypothesize, or at least suppose, that others are under the\nsame mistake as ourselves, or can, like us, fall under it.  (4) We can,\nI repeat, thus hypothesize so long as we see no impossibility.\n(56:5) Thus, when I tell anyone that the earth is not round, &c.,\nI merely recall the error which I perhaps made myself, or which I\nmight have fallen into, and afterwards I hypothesize that the person\nto whom I tell it, is still, or may still fall under the same mistake.\n(6) This I say, I can feign so long as I do not perceive any\nimpossibility or necessity; if I truly understood either one or the\nother I should not be able to feign, and I should be reduced to saying\nthat I had made the attempt.\n[57]  (1) It remains for us to consider hypotheses made in problems,\nwhich sometimes involve impossibilities.  (2) For instance, when we\nsay--let us assume that this burning candle is not burning, or,\nlet us assume that it burns in some imaginary space, or where there\nare no physical objects.  (3) Such assumptions are freely made,\nthough the last is clearly seen to be impossible.  (4) But, though\nthis be so, there is no fiction in the case.  (57:5) For, in the first\ncase, I have merely recalled to memory, [x] another candle not\nburning, or conceived the candle before me as without a flame, and\nthen I understand as applying to the latter, leaving its flame out\nof the question, all that I think of the former.  (6) In the second\ncase, I have merely to abstract my thoughts from the objects\nsurrounding the candle, for the mind to devote itself to the\ncontemplation of the candle singly looked at in itself only; I can\nthen draw the conclusion that the candle contains in itself no\ncauses for its own destruction, so that if there were no physical\nobjects the candle, and even the flame, would remain unchangeable,\nand so on.  (7) Thus there is here no fiction, but, [y] true and\nbare assertions.\n[58] (1) Let us now pass on to the fictions concerned with essences\nonly, or with some reality or existence simultaneously.  (2) Of\nthese we must specially observe that in proportion as the mind's\nunderstanding is smaller, and its experience multiplex, so will its\npower of coining fictions be larger, whereas as its understanding\nincreases, its capacity for entertaining fictitious ideas becomes\nless.  (58:3) For instance, in the same way as we are unable, while\nwe are thinking, to feign that we are thinking or not thinking, so,\nalso, when we know the nature of body we cannot imagine an infinite\nfly; or, when we know the nature of the soul, [z] we cannot imagine\nit as square, though anything may be expressed verbally.  (4) But,\nas we said above, the less men know of nature the more easily can\nthey coin fictitious ideas, such as trees speaking, men instantly\nchanged into stones, or into fountains, ghosts appearing in mirrors,\nsomething issuing from nothing, even gods changed into beasts and men\nand infinite other absurdities of the same kind.\n[59] (1) Some persons think, perhaps, that fiction is limited by\nfiction, and not by understanding; in other words, after I have\nformed some fictitious idea, and have affirmed of my own free will\nthat it exists under a certain form in nature, I am thereby\nprecluded from thinking of it under any other form.  (2) For\ninstance, when I have feigned (to repeat their argument) that the\nnature of body is of a certain kind, and have of my own free will\ndesired to convince myself that it actually exists under this\nform, I am no longer able to hypothesize that a fly, for example,\nis infinite; so, when I have hypothesized the essence of the soul,\nI am not able to think of it as square, &c.\n[60] (1) But these arguments demand further inquiry. (2) First,\ntheir upholders must either grant or deny that we can understand\nanything. If they grant it, then necessarily the same must be\nsaid of understanding, as is said of fiction. (3) If they deny\nit, let us, who know that we do know something, see what they\nmean.  (4) They assert that the soul can be conscious of, and\nperceive in a variety of ways, not itself nor things which\nexist, but only things which are neither in itself nor anywhere\nelse, in other words, that the soul can, by its unaided power,\ncreate sensations or ideas unconnected with things.  (5) In fact,\nthey regard the soul as a sort of god.  (60:6) Further, they assert\nthat we or our soul have such freedom that we can constrain\nourselves, or our soul, or even our soul's freedom.  (7) For,\nafter it has formed a fictitious idea, and has given its assent\nthereto, it cannot think or feign it in any other manner, but is\nconstrained by the first fictitious idea to keep all its other\nthoughts in harmony therewith.  (8) Our opponents are thus driven\nto admit, in support of their fiction, the absurdities which I\nhave just enumerated; and which are not worthy of rational\nrefutation.\n[61]  (1) While leaving such persons in their error, we will take\ncare to derive from our argument with them a truth serviceable for\nour purpose, namely, [61a] that the mind, in paying attention to\na thing hypothetical or false, so as to meditate upon it and\nunderstand it, and derive the proper conclusions in due order\ntherefrom, will readily discover its falsity; and if the thing\nhypothetical be in its nature true, and the mind pays attention\nto it, so as to understand it, and deduce the truths which are\nderivable from it, the mind will proceed with an uninterrupted\nseries of apt conclusions; in the same way as it would at once\ndiscover (as we showed just now) the absurdity of a false\nhypothesis, and of the conclusions drawn from it.\n[62]  (1) We need, therefore, be in no fear of forming hypotheses,\nso long as we have a clear and distinct perception of what is\ninvolved.  (2) For, if we were to assert, haply, that men are\nsuddenly turned into beasts, the statement would be extremely\ngeneral, so general that there would be no conception, that is,\nno idea or connection of subject and predicate, in our mind.\n(3) If there were such a conception we should at the same time\nbe aware of the means and the causes whereby the event took place.\n(4) Moreover, we pay no attention to the nature of the subject\nand the predicate.\n[63]  (1) Now, if the first idea be not fictitious, and if all the\nother ideas be deduced therefrom, our hurry to form fictitious ideas\nwill gradually subside.  (2) Further, as a fictitious idea cannot be\nclear and distinct, but is necessarily confused, and as all confusion\narises from the fact that the mind has only partial knowledge of a\nthing either simple or complex, and does not distinguish between the\nknown and the unknown, and, again, that it directs its attention\npromiscuously to all parts of an object at once without making\ndistinctions, it follows, first, that if the idea be of something\nvery simple, it must necessarily be clear and distinct.  (3) For\na very simple object cannot be known in part, it must either be\nknown altogether or not at all.\n[64]  (1) Secondly, it follows that if a complex object be divided by\nthought into a number of simple component parts, and if each be\nregarded separately, all confusion will disappear.  (2) Thirdly, it\nfollows that fiction cannot be simple, but is made up of the blending\nof several confused ideas of diverse objects or actions existent in\nnature, or rather is composed of attention directed to all such ideas\nat once, [64b] and unaccompanied by any mental assent.\n(64:3) Now a fiction that was simple would be clear and distinct,\nand therefore true, also a fiction composed only of distinct ideas\nwould be clear and distinct, and therefore true.  (4) For instance,\nwhen we know the nature of the circle and the square, it is\nimpossible for us to blend together these two figures, and to\nhypothesize a square circle, any more than a square soul, or things\nof that kind.\n[65] (1) Let us shortly come to our conclusion, and again repeat\nthat we need have no fear of confusing with true ideas that which\nis only a fiction.  (2) As for the first sort of fiction of which\nwe have already spoken, when a thing is clearly conceived, we saw\nthat if the existence of a that thing is in itself an eternal truth\nfiction can have no part in it; but if the existence of the\nconceived be not an eternal truth, we have only to be careful\nsuch existence be compared to the thing's essence, and to\nconsider the order of nature. (64:3) As for the second sort of\nfiction, which we stated to be the result of simultaneously\ndirecting the attention, without the assent of the intellect,\nto different confused ideas representing different things and\nactions existing in nature, we have seen that an absolutely\nsimple thing cannot be feigned, but must be understood, and that\na complex thing is in the same case if we regard separately the\nsimple parts whereof it is composed; we shall not even be able\nto hypothesize any untrue action concerning such objects, for we\nshall be obliged to consider at the same time the causes and manner\nof such action.\n[66]  (1) These matters being thus understood, let us pass on to\nconsider the false idea, observing the objects with which it is\nconcerned, and the means of guarding ourselves from falling into\nfalse perceptions.  (2) Neither of these tasks will present much\ndifficulty, after our inquiry concerning fictitious ideas.\n(3) The false idea only differs from the fictitious idea in the\nfact of implying a mental assent--that is, as we have already\nremarked, while the representations are occurring, there are no\ncauses present to us, wherefrom, as in fiction, we can conclude\nthat such representations do not arise from external objects:\nin fact, it is much the same as dreaming with our eyes open,\nor while awake.  (67:4) Thus, a false idea is concerned with, or\n(to speak more correctly) is attributable to, the existence of\na thing whereof the essence is known, or the essence itself, in\nthe same way as a fictitious idea.\n[67]  (1) If attributable to the existence of the thing, it is\ncorrected in the same way as a fictitious idea under similar\ncircumstances.  (2) If attributable to the essence, it is\nlikewise corrected in the same way as a fictitious idea.\n(67:3) For if the nature of the thing known implies necessary\nexistence, we cannot possible be in error with regard to its\nexistence; but if the nature of the thing be not an eternal\ntruth, like its essence, but contrariwise the necessity or\nimpossibility of its existence depends on external causes,\nthen we must follow the same course as we adopted in the\nof fiction, for it is corrected in the same manner.\n[68]  (1) As for false ideas concerned with essences, or even\nwith actions, such perceptions are necessarily always confused,\nbeing compounded of different confused perceptions of things\nexisting in nature, as, for instance, when men are persuaded\nthat deities are present in woods, in statues, in brute beasts,\nand the like; that there are bodies which, by their composition\nalone, give rise to intellect; that corpses reason, walk about,\nand speak; that God is deceived, and so on.  (68:2) But ideas which\nare clear and distinct can never be false: for ideas of things\nclearly and distinctly conceived are either very simple\nthemselves, or are compounded from very simple ideas, that is,\nare deduced therefrom.  (3) The impossibility of a very simple\nidea being false is evident to everyone who understands the nature\nof truth or understanding and of falsehood.\n[69]  (1) As regards that which constitutes the reality of truth,\nit is certain that a true idea is distinguished from a false one,\nnot so much by its extrinsic object as by its intrinsic nature.\n(2) If an architect conceives a building properly constructed,\nthough such a building may never have existed, and amy never exist,\nnevertheless the idea is true; and the idea remains the same,\nwhether it be put into execution or not.  (69:3) On the other hand,\nif anyone asserts, for instance, that Peter exists, without\nknowing whether Peter really exists or not, the assertion, as far\nas its asserter is concerned, is false, or not true, even though\nPeter actually does exist.  (4) The assertion that Peter exists is\ntrue only with regard to him who knows for certain that Peter does\nexist.\n[70]  (1) Whence it follows that there is in ideas something real,\nwhereby the true are distinguished from the false.  (2) This reality\nmust be inquired into, if we are to find the best standard of truth\n(we have said that we ought to determine our thoughts by the given\nstandard of a true idea, and that method is reflective knowledge),\nand to know the properties of our understanding.  (70:3) Neither must\nwe say that the difference between true and false arises from the\nfact, that true knowledge consists in knowing things through their\nprimary causes, wherein it is totally different from false knowledge,\nas I have just explained it: for thought is said to be true, if\nit involves subjectively the essence of any principle which has no\ncause, and is known through itself and in itself.\n[71]  (1) Wherefore the reality (forma) of true thought must exist\nin the thought itself, without reference to other thoughts; it does\nnot acknowledge the object as its cause, but must depend on the\nactual power and nature of the understanding.  (2) For, if we\nsuppose that the understanding has perceived some new entity which\nhas never existed, as some conceive the understanding of God before\nHe created thing (a perception which certainly could not arise\nany object), and has legitimately deduced other thoughts from said\nperception, all such thoughts would be true, without being\ndetermined by any external object; they would depend solely on the\npower and nature of the understanding.  (71:3) Thus, that which\nconstitutes the reality of a true thought must be sought in the\nthought itself, and deduced from the nature of the understanding.\n[72]  (1) In order to pursue our investigation, let us confront\nourselves with some true idea, whose object we know for\ncertain to be dependent on our power of thinking, and to have\nnothing corresponding to it in nature.  (2) With an idea of this\nkind before us, we shall, as appears from what has just been said,\nbe more easily able to carry on the research we have in view.\n(72:3) For instance, in order to form the conception of a sphere,\nI invent a cause at my pleasure--namely, a semicircle revolving\nround its center, and thus producing a sphere.  (4) This is\nindisputably a true idea; and, although we know that no sphere in\nnature has ever actually been so formed, the perception remains\ntrue, and is the easiest manner of conceiving a sphere.\n(72:5) We must observe that this perception asserts the rotation\nof a semicircle--which assertion would be false, if it were not\nassociated with the conception of a sphere, or of a cause\ndetermining a motion of the kind, or absolutely, if the assertion\nwere isolated.  (6) The mind would then only tend to the\naffirmation of the sole motion of a semicircle, which is not\ncontained in the conception of a semicircle, and does not arise\nfrom the conception of any cause capable of producing such motion.\n(72:7) Thus falsity consists only in this, that something is\naffirmed of a thing, which is not contained in the conception\nwe have formed of that thing, as motion or rest of a semicircle.\n(8) Whence it follows that simple ideas cannot be other than\ntrue--e.g., the simple idea of a semicircle, of motion, of rest,\nof quantity, &c.\n(72:9) Whatsoever affirmation such ideas contain is equal to the\nconcept formed, and does not extend further.  (10) Wherefore we\nform as many simple ideas as we please, without any fear of error.\n[73]  (1) It only remains for us to inquire by what power our mind\ncan form true ideas, and how far such power extends.  (2) It is\ncertain that such power cannot extend itself infinitely.  (3) For\nwhen we affirm somewhat of a thing, which is not contained in the\nconcept we have formed of that thing, such an affirmation shows a\ndefect of our perception, or that we have formed fragmentary or\nmutilated ideas.  (4) Thus we have seen that the notion of a\nsemicircle is false when it is isolated in the mind, but true when\nit is associated with the concept of a sphere, or of some cause\ndetermining such a motion.  (73:5) But if it be the nature of a\nthinking being, as seems, prima facie, to be the case, to form true\nor adequate thoughts, it is plain that inadequate ideas arise in us\nonly because we are parts of a thinking being, whose thoughts--some\nin their entirety, others in fragments only--constitute our mind.\n[74]  (1) But there is another point to be considered, which was not\nworth raising in the case of fiction, but which give rise to complete\ndeception--namely, that certain things presented to the imagination\nalso exist in the understanding--in other words, are conceived\nclearly and distinctly.  (2) Hence, so long as we do not separate that\nwhich is distinct from that which is confused, certainty, or the true\nidea, becomes mixed with indistinct ideas.  (3) For instance, certain\nStoics heard, perhaps, the term \"soul,\" and also that the soul is\nimmortal, yet imagined it only confusedly; they imaged, also, and\nunderstood that very subtle bodies penetrate all others, and are\npenetrated by none.  (74:4) By combining these ideas, and being at the\nsame time certain of the truth of the axiom, they forthwith became\nconvinced that the mind consists of very subtle bodies; that these\nvery subtle bodies cannot be divided &c.\n[75]  (1) But we are freed from mistakes of this kind, so long as we\nendeavor to examine all our perceptions by the standard of the given\ntrue idea.  (2) We must take care, as has been said, to separate such\nperceptions from all those which arise from hearsay or unclassified\nexperience.  (3) Moreover, such mistakes arise from things being\nconceived too much in the abstract; for it is sufficiently self-evident\nthat what I conceive as in its true object I cannot apply to anything\nelse.  (75:4) Lastly, they arise from a want of understanding of the\nprimary elements of nature as a whole; whence we proceed without due\norder, and confound nature with abstract rules, which, although they\nbe true enough in their sphere, yet, when misapplied, confound\nthemselves, and pervert the order of nature.  (5) However, if we\nproceed with as little abstraction as possible, and begin from primary\nelements--that is, from the source and origin of nature, as far back\nas we can reach,--we need not fear any deceptions of this kind.\n[76] (1) As far as the knowledge of the origin of nature is concerned,\nthere is no danger of our confounding it with abstractions.  (2) For\nwhen a thing is conceived in the abstract, as are all universal\nnotions, the said universal notions are always more extensive in the\nmind than the number of individuals forming their contents really\nexisting in nature.  (3) Again, there are many things in nature, the\ndifference between which is so slight as to be hardly perceptible to\nthe understanding; so that it may readily happen that such things are\nconfounded together, if they be conceived abstractedly.  (4) But since\nthe first principle of nature cannot (as we shall see hereafter) be\nconceived abstractedly or universally, and cannot extend further in\nthe understanding than it does in reality, and has no likeness to\nmutable things, no confusion need be feared in respect to the idea of\nit, provided (as before shown) that we possess a standard of truth.\n(5) This is, in fact, a being single and infinite [76z]; in other\nwords, it is the sum total of being, beyond which there is no being\nfound. [76a]\n[77]  (1) Thus far we have treated of the false idea. We have now\nto investigate the doubtful idea--that is, to inquire what can\ncause us to doubt, and how doubt may be removed.  (2) I speak of\nreal doubt existing in the mind, not of such doubt as we see\nexemplified when a man says that he doubts, though his mind does\nnot really hesitate.  (77:3) The cure of the latter does not fall\nwithin the province of method, it belongs rather to inquiries\nconcerning obstinacy and its cure.\n[78]  (1) Real doubt is never produced in the mind by the thing\ndoubted of.  (2) In other words, if there were only one idea in\nthe mind, whether that idea were true or false, there would be no\ndoubt or certainty present, only a certain sensation.  (3) For an\nidea is in itself nothing else than a certain sensation. (4) But\ndoubt will arise through another idea, not clear and distinct\nenough for us to be able to draw any certain conclusions with\nregard to the matter under consideration; that is, the idea which\ncauses us to doubt is not clear and distinct. (5) To take an example.\n(78:6) Supposing that a man has never reflected, taught by experience\nor by any other means, that our senses sometimes deceive us, he will\nnever doubt whether the sun be greater or less than it appears.\n(7) Thus rustics are generally astonished when they hear that the\nsun is much larger than the earth. (8) But from reflection on the\ndeceitfulness of the senses [78a] doubt arises, and if, after\ndoubting, we acquire a true knowledge of the senses, and how things\nat a distance are represented through their instrumentality, doubt\nis again removed.\n[79]  (1) Hence we cannot cast doubt on true ideas by the supposition\nthat there is a deceitful Deity, who leads us astray even in what is\nmost certain.  (2) We can only hold such an hypothesis so long as we\nhave no clear and distinct idea--in other words, until we reflect\nthe knowledge which we have of the first principle of all things, and\nfind that which teaches us that God is not a deceiver, and until we\nknow this with the same certainty as we know from reflecting on the\nare equal to two right angles.  (3) But if we have a knowledge of God\nequal to that which we have of a triangle, all doubt is removed.\n(79:4) In the same way as we can arrive at the said knowledge of a\ntriangle, though not absolutely sure that there is not some\narch-deceiver leading us astray, so can we come to a like knowledge\nof God under the like condition, and when we have attained to it,\nit is sufficient, as I said before, to remove every doubt which we can\npossess concerning clear and distinct ideas.\n[80]  (1) Thus, if a man proceeded with our investigations in due\norder, inquiring first into those things which should first be\ninquired into, never passing over a link in the chain of association,\nand with knowledge how to define his questions before seeking to\nanswer them, he will never have any ideas save such as are very\ncertain, or, in other words, clear and distinct; for doubt is only a\nsuspension of the spirit concerning some affirmation or negation\nwhich it would pronounce upon unhesitatingly if it were not in\nignorance of something, without which the knowledge of the matter in\nhand must needs be imperfect.  (2) We may, therefore, conclude that\ndoubt always proceeds from want of due order in investigation.\n[81]  (1) These are the points I promised to discuss in the first part\nof my treatise on method.  (2) However, in order not to omit anything\nwhich can conduce to the knowledge of the understanding and its\nfaculties, I will add a few words on the subject of memory and\nforgetfulness.\n(81:3) The point most worthy of attention is, that memory is\nstrengthened both with and without the aid of the understanding.\n(4) For the more intelligible a thing is, the more easily is it\nremembered, and the less intelligible it is, the more easily do we\nforget it.  (5) For instance, a number of unconnected words is much\nmore difficult to remember than the same number in the form of a\nnarration.\n[82]  (1) The memory is also strengthened without the aid of the\nunderstanding by means of the power wherewith the imagination or\nthe sense called common, is affected by some particular physical\nobject.  (2) I say particular, for the imagination is only affected\nby particular objects.  (3) If we read, for instance, a single romantic\ncomedy, we shall remember it very well, so long as we do not read\nmany others of the same kind, for it will reign alone in the memory\n(4) If, however, we read several others of the same kind, we shall\nthink of them altogether, and easily confuse one with another.\n(82:5) I say also, physical.  (6) For the imagination is only\naffected by physical objects.  (7) As, then, the memory is\nstrengthened both with and without the aid of the understanding,\nwe may conclude that it is different from the understanding,\nand that in the latter considered in itself there is neither\nmemory nor forgetfulness.\n[83] (1) What, then, is memory? (2) It is nothing else than the\nactual sensation of impressions on the brain, accompanied with the\nthought of a definite duration, [83d] of the sensation.  (3) This\nis also shown by reminiscence.  (4) For then we think of the\nsensation, but without the notion of continuous duration; thus the\nidea of that sensation is not the actual duration of the sensation\nor actual memory.  (83:5) Whether ideas are or are not subject to\ncorruption will be seen in philosophy.  (6) If this seems too\nabsurd to anyone, it will be sufficient for our purpose, if he\nreflect on the fact that a thing is more easily remembered in\nproportion to its singularity, as appears from the example of\nthe comedy just cited.  (83:7) Further, a thing is remembered more\neasily in proportion to its intelligibility; therefore we cannot\nhelp remember that which is extremely singular and sufficiently\nintelligible.\n[84]  (1) Thus, then, we have distinguished between a true idea and\nother perceptions, and shown that ideas fictitious, false, and the\nrest, originate in the imagination--that is, in certain sensations\nfortuitous (so to speak) and disconnected, arising not from the power\nof the mind, but from external causes, according as the body,\nsleeping or waking, receives various motions.\n(2) But one may take any view one likes of the imagination so long\nas one acknowledges that it is different from the understanding, and\nthat the soul is passive with regard to it.  (3) The view taken is\nimmaterial, if we know that the imagination is something indefinite,\nwith regard to which the soul is passive, and that we can by some\nmeans or other free ourselves therefrom with the help of the\nunderstanding.  (4) Let no one then be astonished that before proving\nthe existence of body, and other necessary things, I speak of\nimagination of body, and of its composition.  (5) The view taken is,\nI repeat, immaterial, so long as we know that imagination is something\nindefinite, &c.\n[85] (1) As regards as a true idea, we have shown that it is simple\nor compounded of simple ideas; that it shows how and why something\nis or has been made; and that its subjective effects in the soul\ncorrespond to the actual reality of its object.  (2) This conclusion\nis identical with the saying of the ancients, that true proceeds\nfrom cause to effect; though the ancients, so far as I know,\nnever formed the conception put forward here that the soul acts\naccording to fixed laws, and is as it were an immaterial automaton.\n[86]  (1) Hence, as far as is possible at the outset, we have\nacquired a knowledge of our understanding, and such a standard of\na true idea that we need no longer fear confounding truth with\nfalsehood and fiction.  (2) Neither shall we wonder why we\nunderstand some things which in nowise fall within the scope of\nthe imagination, while other things are in the imagination but\nwholly opposed to the understanding, or others, again, which\nagree therewith.  (3) We now know that the operations, whereby the\neffects of imagination are produced, take place under other laws\nquite different from the laws of the understanding, and that the\nmind is entirely passive with regard to them.\n[87]  (1) Whence we may also see how easily men may fall into grave\nerrors through not distinguishing accurately between the imagination\nand the understanding; such as believing that extension must be\nlocalized, that it must be finite, that its parts are really distinct\none from the other, that it is the primary and single foundation of\nall things, that it occupies more space at one time than at another\nand other similar doctrines, all entirely opposed to truth, as we\nshall duly show.\n[88] (1) Again, since words are a part of the imagination--that is,\nsince we form many conceptions in accordance with confused\narrangements of words in the memory, dependent on particular bodily\nconditions,--there is no doubt that words may, equally with the\nimagination, be the cause of many and great errors, unless we\nstrictly on our guard.\n[89] (1) Moreover, words are formed according to popular fancy and\nintelligence, and are, therefore, signs of things as existing in the\nimagination, not as existing in the understanding.  (2) This is\nevident from the fact that to all such things as exist only in the\nunderstanding, not in the imagination, negative names are often\ngiven, such as incorporeal, infinite, &c.  (3) So, also, many\nconceptions really affirmative are expressed negatively, and vice\nversa, such as uncreate, independent, infinite, immortal, &c.,\ninasmuch as their contraries are much more easily imagined, and,\ntherefore, occurred first to men, and usurped positive names.\n(89:4) Many things we affirm and deny, because the nature of words\nallows us to do so, though the nature of things does not.  (5) While\nwe remain unaware of this fact, we may easily mistake falsehood for\ntruth.\n[90] (1) Let us also beware of another great cause of confusion,\nwhich prevents the understanding from reflecting on itself.\n(2) Sometimes, while making no distinction between the imagination\nand the intellect, we think that what we more readily imagine is\nclearer to us; and also we think that what we imagine we understand.\n(3) Thus, we put first that which should be last: the true order of\nprogression is reversed, and no legitimate conclusion is drawn.\n[91]  [91e] (1) Now, in order at length to pass on to the second\npart of this method, I shall first set forth the object aimed at,\nand next the means for its attainment.  (2) The object aimed at\nis the acquisition of clear and distinct ideas, such as are\nproduced by the pure intellect, and not by chance physical motions.\n(3) In order that all ideas may be reduced to unity, we shall\nendeavor so to associate and arrange them that our mind may, as far\nas possible, reflect subjectively the reality of nature, both as\na whole and as parts.\n[92] (1) As for the first point, it is necessary (as we have said)\nfor our purpose that everything should be conceived, either solely\nthrough its essence, or through its proximate cause.  (2) If the\nthing be self-existent, or, as is commonly said, the cause of\nitself, it must be understood through its essence only; if it be\nnot self-existent, but requires a cause for its existence, it must\nbe understood through its proximate cause.  (3) For, in reality,\nthe knowledge, [92f] of an effect is nothing else than the\nacquisition of more perfect knowledge of its cause.\n[93] (1) Therefore, we may never, while we are concerned with\ninquiries into actual things, draw any conclusion from\nabstractions; we shall be extremely careful not to confound that\nwhich is only in the understanding with that which is in the\nthing itself. (2) The best basis for drawing a conclusion will\nbe either some particular affirmative essence, or a true and\nlegitimate definition.  (93:3) For the understanding cannot descend\nfrom universal axioms by themselves to particular things, since\naxioms are of infinite extent, and do not determine the\nunderstanding to contemplate one particular thing more than\nanother.\n[94] (1) Thus the true method of discovery is to form thoughts\nfrom some given definition.  (2) This process will be the\nmore fruitful and easy in proportion as the thing given be\nbetter defined.  (3) Wherefore, the cardinal point of all this\nsecond part of method consists in the knowledge of the conditions\nof good definition, and the means of finding them.  (4) I will\nfirst treat of the conditions of definition.\n[95]  (1) A definition, if it is to be called perfect, must\nexplain the inmost essence of a thing, and must take care not\nto substitute for this any of its properties.  (2) In order\nto illustrate my meaning, without taking an example which\nwould seem to show a desire to expose other people's errors,\nI will choose the case of something abstract, the definition\nof which is of little moment.  (95:3) Such is a circle.  (4) If\na circle be defined as a figure, such that all straight lines\ndrawn from the center to the circumference are equal, every\none can see that such a definition does not in the least\nexplain the essence of a circle, but solely one of its\nproperties.  (5) Though, as I have said, this is of no\nimportance in the case of figures and other abstractions,\nit is of great importance in the case of physical beings\nand realities: for the properties of things are not understood\nso long as their essences are unknown. (6) If the latter be\npassed over, there is necessarily a perversion of the\nsuccession of ideas which should reflect the succession of\nnature, and we go far astray from our object.\n[96]  In order to be free from this fault, the following rules\nshould be observed in definition:--\nI.  (1) If the thing in question be created, the definition\nmust (as we have said) comprehend the proximate cause.\n(2) For instance, a circle should, according to this rule,\nbe defined as follows: the figure described by any line\nwhereof one end is fixed and the other free.  (3) This\ndefinition clearly comprehends the proximate cause.\nII.  (4) A conception or definition of a thing should be such\nthat all the properties of that thing, in so far as it is\nconsidered by itself, and not in conjunction with other\nthings, can be deduced from it, as may be seen in the\ndefinition given of a circle: for from that it clearly follows\nthat all straight lines drawn from the center to the\ncircumference are equal.  (5) That this is a necessary\ncharacteristic of a definition is so clear to anyone, who\nreflects on the matter, that there is no need to spend time\nin proving it, or in showing that, owing to this second\ncondition, every definition should be affirmative.  (6) I\nspeak of intellectual affirmation, giving little thought to\nverbal affirmations which, owing to the poverty of language,\nmust sometimes, perhaps, be expressed negatively, though\nthe idea contained is affirmative.\n[97]  The rules for the definition of an uncreated thing\nare as follows:--\nI.  The exclusion of all idea of cause--that is, the thing\nmust not need explanation by Anything outside itself.\nII. When the definition of the thing has been given, there must\nbe no room for doubt as to whether the thing exists or not.\nIII. It must contain, as far as the mind is concerned, no\nsubstantives which could be put into an adjectival form;\nin other words, the object defined must not be explained\nthrough abstractions.\nIV. Lastly, though this is not absolutely necessary, it should\nbe possible to deduce from the definition all the properties\nof the thing defined.\nAll these rules become obvious to anyone giving strict\nattention to the matter.\n[98]  (1) I have also stated that the best basis for drawing a\nconclusion is a particular affirmative essence.  (2) The more\nspecialized the idea is, the more it is distinct, and therefore\nclear.  (3) Wherefore a knowledge of particular things should\nbe sought for as diligently as possible.\n[99]  (1) As regards the order of our perceptions, and the manner\nin which they should be arranged and united, it is necessary that,\nas soon as is possible and rational, we should inquire whether\nthere be any being (and, if so, what being), that is the cause\nof all things, so that its essence, represented in thought, may\nbe the cause of all our ideas, and then our mind will to the\nutmost possible extent reflect nature. (2) For it will possess,\nsubjectively, nature's essence, order, and union.  (3) Thus we\ncan see that it is before all things necessary for us to deduce\nall our ideas from physical things--that is, from real entities,\nproceeding, as far as may be, according to the series of causes,\nfrom one real entity to another real entity, never passing to\nuniversals and abstractions, either for the purpose of deducing\nsome real entity from them, or deducing them from some real\nentity.  (4) Either of these processes interrupts the true\nprogress of the understanding.\n[100]  (1) But it must be observed that, by the series of causes\nand real entities, I do not here mean the series of particular\nand mutable things, but only the series of fixed and eternal\nthings. (2) It would be impossible for human infirmity to follow\nup the series of particular mutable things, both on account\ntheir multitude, surpassing all calculation, and on account of\nthe infinitely diverse circumstances surrounding one and the same\nthing, any one of which may be the cause of its existence or\nnon-existence.  (3) Indeed, their existence has no connection\nwith their essence, or (as we have said already) is not an\neternal truth.\n[101] (1) Neither is there any need that we should understand\ntheir series, for the essences of particular mutable things are\nnot to be gathered from their series or order of existence,\nwhich would furnish us with nothing beyond their extrinsic\ndenominations, their relations, or, at most, their circumstances,\nall of which are very different from their inmost essence.\n(101:2) This inmost essence must be sought solely from fixed and\neternal things, and from the laws, inscribed (so to speak) in\nthose things as in their true codes, according to which all\nparticular things take place and are arranged; nay, these mutable\nparticular things depend so intimately and essentially (so to\nphrase it) upon the fixed things, that they cannot either be\nconceived without them.\n[102]  (1) But, though this be so, there seems to be no small\ndifficulty in arriving at the knowledge of these particular things,\nfor to conceive them all at once would far surpass the powers of\nthe human understanding.  (2) The arrangement whereby one thing is\nunderstood, before another, as we have stated, should not be sought\nfrom their series of existence, nor from eternal things.  (3) For\nthe latter are all by nature simultaneous.  (4) Other aids are\ntherefore needed besides those employed for understanding eternal\nthings and their laws.  (5) However, this is not the place to recount\nsuch aids, nor is there any need to do so, until we have acquired a\nsufficient knowledge of eternal things and their infallible laws,\nand until the nature of our senses has become plain to us.\n[103]  (1) Before betaking ourselves to seek knowledge of particular\nthings, it will be seasonable to speak of such aids, as all tend to\nteach us the mode of employing our senses, and to make certain\nexperiments under fixed rules and arrangements which may suffice to\ndetermine the object of our inquiry, so that we may therefrom infer\nwhat laws of eternal things it has been produced under, and may gain\nan insight into its inmost nature, as I will duly show.  (2) Here,\nto return to my purpose, I will only endeavor to set forth what seems\nnecessary for enabling us to attain to knowledge of eternal things,\nand to define them under the conditions laid down above.\n[104]  (1) With this end, we must bear in mind what has already been\nstated, namely, that when the mind devotes itself to any thought, so\nas to examine it, and to deduce therefrom in due order all the\nlegitimate conclusions possible, any falsehood which may lurk in the\nthought will be detected; but if the thought be true, the mind will\nreadily proceed without interruption to deduce truths from it.\n(104:2) This, I say, is necessary for our purpose, for our thoughts\nmay be brought to a close by the absence of a foundation.\n[105]  (1) If, therefore, we wish to investigate the first thing of\nall, it will be necessary to supply some foundation which may direct\nour thoughts thither.  (2) Further, since method is reflective\nknowledge, the foundation which must direct our thoughts can be\nnothing else than the knowledge of that which constitutes the reality\nof truth, and the knowledge of the understanding, its properties, and\npowers.  (3) When this has been acquired we shall possess a foundation\nwherefrom we can deduce our thoughts, and a path whereby the intellect,\naccording to its capacity, may attain the knowledge of eternal things,\nallowance being made for the extent of the intellectual powers.\n[106]  (1) If, as I stated in the first part, it belongs to the nature\nof thought to form true ideas, we must here inquire what is meant by\nthe faculties and power of the understanding.  (2) The chief part of\nour method is to understand as well as possible the powers of the\nintellect, and its nature; we are, therefore, compelled (by the\nconsiderations advanced in the second part of the method) necessarily\nto draw these conclusions from the definition itself of thought and\nunderstanding.\n[107]  (1) But, so far as we have not got any rules for finding\ndefinitions, and, as we cannot set forth such rules without a\nprevious knowledge of nature, that is without a definition of the\nunderstanding and its power, it follows either that the definition\nof the understanding must be clear in itself, or that we can\nunderstand nothing.  (2) Nevertheless this definition is not\nabsolutely clear in itself; however, since its properties, like\nall things that we possess through the understanding, cannot be\nknown clearly and distinctly, unless its nature be known previously,\nunderstanding makes itself manifest, if we pay attention to its\nproperties, which we know clearly and distinctly.  (3) Let us,\nthen, enumerate here the properties of the understanding, let us\nexamine them, and begin by discussing the instruments for research\nwhich we find innate in us. See [31]\n[108]  (1) The properties of the understanding which I have chiefly\nremarked, and which I clearly understand, are the following:--\nI. (2) It involves certainty--in other words, it knows that a thing\nexists in reality as it is reflected subjectively.\nII. (108:3) That it perceives certain things, or forms some ideas\nabsolutely, some ideas from others.  (4) Thus it forms the\nidea of quantity absolutely, without reference to any other\nthoughts; but ideas of motion it only forms after taking into\nconsideration the idea of quantity.\nIII. (108:5) Those ideas which the understanding forms absolutely\nexpress infinity; determinate ideas are derived from other\nideas.  (6) Thus in the idea of quantity, perceived by means\nof a cause, the quantity is determined, as when a body is\nperceived to be formed by the motion of a plane, a plane by\nthe motion of a line, or, again, a line by the motion of a\npoint.  (7) All these are perceptions which do not serve\ntowards understanding quantity, but only towards determining\nit.  (108:8) This is proved by the fact that we conceive them\nas formed as it were by motion, yet this motion is not perceived\nunless the quantity be perceived also; we can even prolong the\nmotion to form an infinite line, which we certainly could not do\nunless we had an idea of infinite quantity.\nIV. (9) The understanding forms positive ideas before forming\nnegative ideas.\nV. (108:10) It perceives things not so much under the condition\nof duration as under a certain form of eternity, and in an\ninfinite number; or rather in perceiving things it does not\nconsider either their number or duration, whereas, in imagining\nthem, it perceives them in a determinate number, duration, and\nquantity.\nVI. (108:11) The ideas which we form as clear and distinct, seem\nto follow from the sole necessity of our nature, that they\nappear to depend absolutely on our sole power; with confused\nideas the contrary is the case.  (12) They are often formed\nagainst our will.\nVII. (108:13) The mind can determine in many ways the ideas of things,\nwhich the understanding forms from other ideas: thus, for instance,\nin order to define the plane of an ellipse, it supposes a point\nadhering to a cord to be moved around two centers, or, again, it\nconceives an infinity of points, always in the same fixed relation\nto a given straight line, angle of the vertex of the cone, or in an\ninfinity of other ways.\nVIII. (108:14) The more ideas express perfection of any object,\nthe more perfect are they themselves; for we do not admire the\narchitect who has planned a chapel so much as the architect who\nhas planned a splendid temple.\n[109] (1) I do not stop to consider the rest of what is referred\nto thought, such as love, joy, &c.  (2) They are nothing to our\npresent purpose, and cannot even be conceived unless the\nunderstanding be perceived previously. (3) When perception is\nremoved, all these go with it.\n[110] (1) False and fictitious ideas have nothing positive about\nthem (as we have abundantly shown), which causes them to be called\nfalse or fictitious; they are only considered as such through the\ndefectiveness of knowledge.  (2) Therefore, false and fictitious\nideas as such can teach us nothing concerning the essence of thought;\nthis must be sought from the positive properties just enumerated;\nin other words, we must lay down some common basis from which these\nproperties necessarily follow, so that when this is given, the\nproperties are necessarily given also, and when it is removed,\nthey too vanish with it.\nThe rest of the treatise is wanting.\n----------------------------------------------------------------------\nSpinoza's Endnotes: Marks as per Curley, see Note 5 above.\n[a] (1) This might be explained more at large and more clearly:\nI mean by distinguishing riches according as they are pursued for\ntheir own sake, in or furtherance of fame, or sensual pleasure,\nor the advancement of science and art. (2) But this subject is\nreserved to its own place, for it is not here proper to\ninvestigate the matter more accurately.\n[b] These considerations should be set forth more precisely.\n[c] These matters are explained more at length elsewhere.\n[d] N.B. I do no more here than enumerate the sciences necessary\nfor our purpose; I lay no stress on their order.\n[e] There is for the sciences but one end, to which they should\nall be directed.\n[f] (1) In this case we do not understand anything of the cause\nfrom the consideration of it in the effect.  (2) This is\nsufficiently evident from the fact that the cause is only\nspoken of in very general terms, such as--there exists then\nsomething; there exists then some power, &c.; or from the\nthat we only express it in a negative manner--it is not\nor that, &c.  (3) In the second case something is ascribed\nto the cause because of the effect, as we shall show in an\nexample, but only a property, never an essence.\n[g] (1) From this example may be clearly seen what I have just\ndrawn attention to.  (2) For through this union we understand\nnothing beyond the sensation, the effect, to wit, from which\nwe inferred the cause of which we understand nothing.\n[h] (1) A conclusion of this sort, though it be certain, is yet\nnot to be relied on without great caution; for unless we are\nexceedingly careful we shall forthwith fall into error.\n(2) When things are conceived thus abstractedly, and not\nthrough their true essence, they are apt to be confused by the\nimagination.  (3) For that which is in itself one, men imagine\nto be multiplex.  (4) To those things which are conceived\nabstractedly, apart, and confusedly, terms are applied which are\napt to become wrested from their strict meaning, and bestowed on\nthings more familiar; whence it results that these latter are\nimagined in the same way as the former to which the terms were\noriginally given.\n[i] I shall here treat a little more in detail of experience,\nand shall examine the method adopted by the Empirics,\nand by recent philosophers.\n[k] By native strength, I mean that not bestowed on us by external\ncauses, as I shall afterwards explain in my philosophy.\n[l] Here I term them operations: I shall explain their nature\nin my philosophy.\n[m] I shall take care not only to demonstrate what I have just\nadvanced, but also that we have hitherto proceeded rightly,\nand other things needful to be known.\n[33note1] (1) In modern language, \"the idea may become the\nsubject of another presentation.\"  (2) Objectivus generally\ncorresponds to the modern \"subjective,\" formalis to the\nmodern \"objective.\" [Trans.- Note 1]\n[n] (1) Observe that we are not here inquiring how the first\nsubjective essence is innate in us.  (2) This belongs to an\ninvestigation into nature, where all these matters are amply\nexplained, and it is shown that without ideas neither\naffirmation, nor negation, nor volition are possible.\n[o] The nature of mental search is explained in my philosophy.\n[p] To be connected with other things is to be produced by them,\nor to produce them.\n[q] In the same way as we have here no doubt of the truth of\nour knowledge.\n[r] See below the note on hypotheses, whereof we have a clear\nunderstanding; the fiction consists in saying that such\nhypotheses exist in heavenly bodies.\n[s] (1) As a thing, when once it is understood, manifests itself,\nwe have need only of an example without further proof.\n(2) In the same way the contrary has only to be presented to\nour minds to be recognized as false, as will forthwith appear\nwhen we come to discuss fiction concerning essences.\n[t] Observe, that although many assert that they doubt whether God\nexists, they have nought but his name in their minds, or else\nsome fiction which they call God: this fiction is not in\nharmony with God's real nature, as we will duly show.\n[u] (1) I shall presently show that no fiction can concern eternal\ntruths. By an eternal truth, I mean that which being positive\ncould never become negative.  (2) Thus it is a primary and\neternal truth that God exists, but it is not an eternal truth\nthat Adam thinks.  (3) That the Chimaera does not exist is an\neternal truth, that Adam does not think is not so.\n[x] (1) Afterwards, when we come to speak of fiction that is\nconcerned with essences, it will be evident that fiction never\ncreates or furnishes the mind with anything new; only such things\nas are already in the brain or imagination are recalled to the\nmemory, when the attention is directed to them confusedly and all\nat once.  (2) For instance, we have remembrance of spoken words\nand of a tree; when the mind directs itself to them confusedly,\nit forms the notion of a tree speaking.  (3) The same may be said\nof existence, especially when it is conceived quite generally as\nan entity; it is then readily applied to all things together in\nthe memory.  (4) This is specially worthy of remark.\n[y] We must understand as much in the case of hypotheses put forward\nto explain certain movements accompanying celestial phenomena;\nbut from these, when applied to the celestial motions, we any\ndraw conclusions as to the nature of the heavens, whereas this\nlast may be quite different, especially as many other causes are\nconceivable which would account for such motions.\n[z] (1) It often happens that a man recalls to mind this word soul,\nand forms at the same time some corporeal image: as the two\nrepresentations are simultaneous, he easily thinks that he\nimagines and feigns a corporeal soul: thus confusing the name\nwith the thing itself.  (2) I here beg that my readers will not\nbe in a hurry to refute this proposition; they will, I hope,\nhave no mind to do so, if they pay close attention to the\nexamples given and to what follows.\n[61a] (1) Though I seem to deduce this from experience, some\nmay deny its cogency because I have given no formal proof.\n(2) I therefore append the following for those who may\ndesire it.  (3) As there can be nothing in nature contrary\nto nature's laws, since all things come to pass by fixed\nlaws, so that each thing must irrefragably produce its own\nproper effect, it follows that the soul, as soon as it\npossesses the true conception of a thing, proceeds to\nreproduce in thought that thing's effects.  (4) See below,\nwhere I speak of the false idea.\n[64b] (1) Observe that fiction regarded in itself, only differs\nfrom dreams in that in the latter we do not perceive the\nexternal causes which we perceive through the senses while\nawake.  (2) It has hence been inferred that representations\noccurring in sleep have no connection with objects external\nto us.  (3) We shall presently see that error is the dreaming\nof a waking man: if it reaches a certain pitch it becomes delirium.\n[76z] These are not attributes of God displaying His essence,\nas I will show in my philosophy.\n[76a] (1) This has been shown already.  (2) For if such a being\ndid not exist it would never be produced; therefore the mind\nwould be able to understand more than nature could furnish;\nand this has been shown above to be false.\n[78a] (1) That is, it is known that the senses sometimes deceive us.\n(2) But it is only known confusedly, for it is not known how\nthey deceive us.\n[83d] (1) If the duration be indefinite, the recollection is\nimperfect; this everyone seems to have learnt from nature.\n(2) For we often ask, to strengthen our belief in something\nwe hear of, when and where it happened; though ideas\nthemselves have their own duration in the mind, yet, as we\nare wont to determine duration by the aid of some measure\nof motion which, again, takes place by aid of imagination,\nwe preserve no memory connected with pure intellect.\n[91e] The chief rule of this part is, as appears from the first\npart, to review all the ideas coming to us through pure\nintellect, so as to distinguish them from such as we imagine:\nthe distinction will be shown through the properties of each,\nnamely, of the imagination and of the understanding.\n[92f] Observe that it is thereby manifest that we cannot understand\nanything of nature without at the same time increasing our\nknowledge of the first cause, or God.\nEnd of \"On the Improvement of the Understanding.\"\nNotes by Volunteer.\n1.

{"text": "Produced by Tom Sharpe.  HTML version by Al Haines.\nThe Ethics\n(Ethica Ordine Geometrico Demonstrata)\nby\nBenedict de Spinoza\nTranslated from the Latin by R. H. M. Elwes\nPART I. CONCERNING GOD.\nDEFINITIONS.\nI.  By that which is self--caused, I mean that of which the\nessence involves existence, or that of which the nature is only\nconceivable as existent.\nII.  A thing is called finite after its kind, when it can be\nlimited by another thing of the same nature; for instance, a\nbody is called finite because we always conceive another greater\nbody.  So, also, a thought is limited by another thought, but a\nbody is not limited by thought, nor a thought by body.\nIII.  By substance, I mean that which is in itself, and is\nconceived through itself: in other words, that of which a\nconception can be formed independently of any other conception.\nIV.  By attribute, I mean that which the intellect perceives as\nconstituting the essence of substance.\nV.  By mode, I mean the modifications[1] of substance, or that\nwhich exists in, and is conceived through, something other than\nitself.\n[1] \"Affectiones\"\nVI.  By God, I mean a being absolutely infinite--that is, a\nsubstance consisting in infinite attributes, of which each\nexpresses eternal and infinite essentiality.\nExplanation--I say absolutely infinite, not infinite after its\nkind: for, of a thing infinite only after its kind, infinite\nattributes may be denied; but that which is absolutely infinite,\ncontains in its essence whatever expresses reality, and involves\nno negation.\nVII.  That thing is called free, which exists solely by the\nnecessity of its own nature, and of which the action is\ndetermined by itself alone.  On the other hand, that thing is\nnecessary, or rather constrained, which is determined by\nsomething external to itself to a fixed and definite method of\nexistence or action.\nVIII.  By eternity, I mean existence itself, in so far as it is\nconceived necessarily to follow solely from the definition of\nthat which is eternal.\nExplanation--Existence of this kind is conceived as an eternal\ntruth, like the essence of a thing, and, therefore, cannot be\nexplained by means of continuance or time, though continuance may\nbe conceived without a beginning or end.\nAXIOMS.\nI.  Everything which exists, exists either in itself or in\nsomething else.\nII.  That which cannot be conceived through anything else must be\nconceived through itself.\nIII.  From a given definite cause an effect necessarily follows;\nand, on the other hand, if no definite cause be granted, it is\nimpossible that an effect can follow.\nIV.  The knowledge of an effect depends on and involves the\nknowledge of a cause.\nV.  Things which have nothing in common cannot be understood, the\none by means of the other; the conception of one does not\ninvolve the conception of the other.\nVI.  A true idea must correspond with its ideate or object.\nVII.  If a thing can be conceived as non--existing, its essence\ndoes not involve existence.\nPROPOSITIONS.\nPROP. I.  Substance is by nature prior to its modifications.\nProof.--This is clear from Deff. iii. and v.\nPROP. II.  Two substances, whose attributes are different, have\nnothing in common.\nProof.--Also evident from Def. iii.  For each must exist in\nitself, and be conceived through itself; in other words, the\nconception of one does not imply the conception of the other.\nPROP. III.  Things which have nothing in common cannot be one the\ncause of the other.\nProof.--If they have nothing in common, it follows that one\ncannot be apprehended by means of the other (Ax. v.), and,\ntherefore, one cannot be the cause of the other (Ax. iv.).\nQ.E.D.\nPROP. IV.  Two or more distinct things are distinguished one from\nthe other, either by the difference of the attributes of the\nsubstances, or by the difference of their modifications.\nProof.--Everything which exists, exists either in itself or in\nsomething else (Ax. i.),--that is (by Deff. iii. and v.), nothing\nis granted in addition to the understanding, except substance and\nits modifications.  Nothing is, therefore, given besides the\nunderstanding, by which several things may be distinguished one\nfrom the other, except the substances, or, in other words (see\nAx. iv.), their attributes and modifications.  Q.E.D.\nPROP. V.  There cannot exist in the universe two or more\nsubstances having the same nature or attribute.\nProof.--If several distinct substances be granted, they must\nbe distinguished one from the other, either by the difference of\ntheir attributes, or by the difference of their modifications\n(Prop. iv.).  If only by the difference of their attributes, it\nwill be granted that there cannot be more than one with an\nidentical attribute.  If by the difference of their\nmodifications--as substance is naturally prior to its\nmodifications (Prop. i.),--it follows that setting the\nmodifications aside, and considering substance in itself, that is\ntruly, (Deff. iii. and vi.), there cannot be conceived one\nsubstance different from another,--that is (by Prop. iv.), there\ncannot be granted several substances, but one substance only.\nQ.E.D.\nPROP. VI.  One substance cannot be produced by another substance.\nProof.--It is impossible that there should be in the universe\ntwo substances with an identical attribute, i.e. which have\nanything common to them both (Prop. ii.), and, therefore (Prop.\niii.), one cannot be the cause of the other, neither can one be\nproduced by the other.  Q.E.D.\nCorollary.--Hence it follows that a substance cannot be\nproduced by anything external to itself.  For in the universe\nnothing is granted, save substances and their modifications (as\nappears from Ax. i. and Deff. iii. and v.).  Now (by the last\nProp.) substance cannot be produced by another substance,\ntherefore it cannot be produced by anything external to itself.\nQ.E.D.  This is shown still more readily by the absurdity of the\ncontradictory.  For, if substance be produced by an external\ncause, the knowledge of it would depend on the knowledge of its\ncause (Ax. iv.), and (by Def. iii.) it would itself not be\nsubstance.\nPROP. VII.  Existence belongs to the nature of substances.\nProof.--Substance cannot be produced by anything external\n(Corollary, Prop vi.), it must, therefore, be its own cause--that\nis, its essence necessarily involves existence, or existence\nbelongs to its nature.\nPROP. VIII.  Every substance is necessarily infinite.\nProof.--There can only be one substance with an identical\nattribute, and existence follows from its nature (Prop. vii.);\nits nature, therefore, involves existence, either as finite or\ninfinite.  It does not exist as finite, for (by Def. ii.) it\nwould then be limited by something else of the same kind, which\nwould also necessarily exist (Prop. vii.); and there would be\ntwo substances with an identical attribute, which is absurd\n(Prop. v.).  It therefore exists as infinite.  Q.E.D.\nNote I.--As finite existence involves a partial negation, and\ninfinite existence is the absolute affirmation of the given\nnature, it follows (solely from Prop. vii.) that every substance\nis necessarily infinite.\nNote II.--No doubt it will be difficult for those who think\nabout things loosely, and have not been accustomed to know them\nby their primary causes, to comprehend the demonstration of Prop.\nvii.: for such persons make no distinction between the\nmodifications of substances and the substances themselves, and\nare ignorant of the manner in which things are produced; hence\nthey may attribute to substances the beginning which they observe\nin natural objects.  Those who are ignorant of true causes, make\ncomplete confusion--think that trees might talk just as well as\nmen--that men might be formed from stones as well as from seed;\nand imagine that any form might be changed into any other. So,\nalso, those who confuse the two natures, divine and human,\nreadily attribute human passions to the deity, especially so long\nas they do not know how passions originate in the mind.  But, if\npeople would consider the nature of substance, they would have no\ndoubt about the truth of Prop. vii.  In fact, this proposition\nwould be a universal axiom, and accounted a truism.  For, by\nsubstance, would be understood that which is in itself, and is\nconceived through itself--that is, something of which the\nconception requires not the conception of anything else; whereas\nmodifications exist in something external to themselves, and a\nconception of them is formed by means of a conception of the\nthing in which they exist.  Therefore, we may have true ideas of\nnon--existent modifications; for, although they may have no\nactual existence apart from the conceiving intellect, yet their\nessence is so involved in something external to themselves that\nthey may through it be conceived.  Whereas the only truth\nsubstances can have, external to the intellect, must consist in\ntheir existence, because they are conceived through themselves.\nTherefore, for a person to say that he has a clear and\ndistinct--that is, a true--idea of a substance, but that he is not\nsure whether such substance exists, would be the same as if he\nsaid that he had a true idea, but was not sure whether or no it\nwas false (a little consideration will make this plain); or if\nanyone affirmed that substance is created, it would be the same\nas saying that a false idea was true--in short, the height of\nabsurdity.  It must, then, necessarily be admitted that the\nexistence of substance as its essence is an eternal truth.  And\nwe can hence conclude by another process of reasoning--that there\nis but one such substance.  I think that this may profitably be\ndone at once; and, in order to proceed regularly with the\ndemonstration, we must premise:----\n1.  The true definition of a thing neither involves nor\nexpresses anything beyond the nature of the thing defined.  From\nthis it follows that----\n2.  No definition implies or expresses a certain number of\nindividuals, inasmuch as it expresses nothing beyond the nature\nof the thing defined.  For instance, the definition of a triangle\nexpresses nothing beyond the actual nature of a triangle: it\ndoes not imply any fixed number of triangles.\n3.  There is necessarily for each individual existent thing a\ncause why it should exist.\n4.  This cause of existence must either be contained in the\nnature and definition of the thing defined, or must be postulated\napart from such definition.\nIt therefore follows that, if a given number of individual\nthings exist in nature, there must be some cause for the\nexistence of exactly that number, neither more nor less.  For\nexample, if twenty men exist in the universe (for simplicity's\nsake, I will suppose them existing simultaneously, and to have\nhad no predecessors), and we want to account for the existence of\nthese twenty men, it will not be enough to show the cause of\nhuman existence in general; we must also show why there are\nexactly twenty men, neither more nor less: for a cause must be\nassigned for the existence of each individual.  Now this cause\ncannot be contained in the actual nature of man, for the true\ndefinition of man does not involve any consideration of the\nnumber twenty.  Consequently, the cause for the existence of\nthese twenty men, and, consequently, of each of them, must\nnecessarily be sought externally to each individual. Hence we may\nlay down the absolute rule, that everything which may consist of\nseveral individuals must have an external cause.  And, as it has\nbeen shown already that existence appertains to the nature of\nsubstance, existence must necessarily be included in its\ndefinition; and from its definition alone existence must be\ndeducible.  But from its definition (as we have shown, notes ii.,\niii.), we cannot infer the existence of several substances;\ntherefore it follows that there is only one substance of the same\nnature.  Q.E.D.\nPROP. IX.  The more reality or being a thing has, the greater the\nnumber of its attributes (Def. iv.).\nPROP. X.  Each particular attribute of the one substance must be\nconceived through itself.\nProof.--An attribute is that which the intellect perceives of\nsubstance, as constituting its essence (Def. iv.), and,\ntherefore, must be conceived through itself (Def. iii.).  Q.E.D.\nNote--It is thus evident that, though two attributes are, in\nfact, conceived as distinct--that is, one without the help of the\nother--yet we cannot, therefore, conclude that they constitute two\nentities, or two different substances.  For it is the nature of\nsubstance that each of its attributes is conceived through\nitself, inasmuch as all the attributes it has have always existed\nsimultaneously in it, and none could be produced by any other;\nbut each expresses the reality or being of substance.  It is,\nthen, far from an absurdity to ascribe several attributes to one\nsubstance: for nothing in nature is more clear than that each\nand every entity must be conceived under some attribute, and that\nits reality or being is in proportion to the number of its\nattributes expressing necessity or eternity and infinity.\nConsequently it is abundantly clear, that an absolutely infinite\nbeing must necessarily be defined as consisting in infinite\nattributes, each of which expresses a certain eternal and\ninfinite essence.\nIf anyone now ask, by what sign shall he be able to\ndistinguish different substances, let him read the following\npropositions, which show that there is but one substance in the\nuniverse, and that it is absolutely infinite, wherefore such a\nsign would be sought in vain.\nPROP. XI.  God, or substance, consisting of infinite attributes,\nof which each expresses eternal and infinite essentiality,\nnecessarily exists.\nProof.--If this be denied, conceive, if possible, that God\ndoes not exist: then his essence does not involve existence.\nBut this (Prop. vii.) is absurd.  Therefore God necessarily\nexists.\nAnother proof.--Of everything whatsoever a cause or reason\nmust be assigned, either for its existence, or for its\nnon--existence--e.g. if a triangle exist, a reason or cause must be\ngranted for its existence; if, on the contrary, it does not\nexist, a cause must also be granted, which prevents it from\nexisting, or annuls its existence.  This reason or cause must\neither be contained in the nature of the thing in question, or be\nexternal to it.  For instance, the reason for the non--existence\nof a square circle is indicated in its nature, namely, because it\nwould involve a contradiction.  On the other hand, the existence\nof substance follows also solely from its nature, inasmuch as its\nnature involves existence.  (See Prop. vii.)\nBut the reason for the existence of a triangle or a circle\ndoes not follow from the nature of those figures, but from the\norder of universal nature in extension.  From the latter it must\nfollow, either that a triangle necessarily exists, or that it is\nimpossible that it should exist.  So much is self--evident.  It\nfollows therefrom that a thing necessarily exists, if no cause or\nreason be granted which prevents its existence.\nIf, then, no cause or reason can be given, which prevents the\nexistence of God, or which destroys his existence, we must\ncertainly conclude that he necessarily does exist.  If such a\nreason or cause should be given, it must either be drawn from the\nvery nature of God, or be external to him--that is, drawn from\nanother substance of another nature.  For if it were of the same\nnature, God, by that very fact, would be admitted to exist.  But\nsubstance of another nature could have nothing in common with God\n(by Prop. ii.), and therefore would be unable either to cause or\nto destroy his existence.\nAs, then, a reason or cause which would annul the divine\nexistence cannot be drawn from anything external to the divine\nnature, such cause must perforce, if God does not exist, be drawn\nfrom God's own nature, which would involve a contradiction.  To\nmake such an affirmation about a being absolutely infinite and\nsupremely perfect is absurd; therefore, neither in the nature of\nGod, nor externally to his nature, can a cause or reason be\nassigned which would annul his existence.  Therefore, God\nnecessarily exists.  Q.E.D.\nAnother proof.--The potentiality of non--existence is a\nnegation of power, and contrariwise the potentiality of existence\nis a power, as is obvious.  If, then, that which necessarily\nexists is nothing but finite beings, such finite beings are more\npowerful than a being absolutely infinite, which is obviously\nabsurd; therefore, either nothing exists, or else a being\nabsolutely infinite necessarily exists also.  Now we exist either\nin ourselves, or in something else which necessarily exists (see\nAxiom. i. and Prop. vii.).  Therefore a being absolutely\ninfinite--in other words, God (Def. vi.)--necessarily exists.\nQ.E.D.\nNote.--In this last proof, I have purposely shown God's\nexistence a posteriori, so that the proof might be more easily\nfollowed, not because, from the same premises, God's existence\ndoes not follow a priori.  For, as the potentiality of existence\nis a power, it follows that, in proportion as reality increases\nin the nature of a thing, so also will it increase its strength\nfor existence.  Therefore a being absolutely infinite, such as\nGod, has from himself an absolutely infinite power of existence,\nand hence he does absolutely exist.  Perhaps there will be many\nwho will be unable to see the force of this proof, inasmuch as\nthey are accustomed only to consider those things which flow from\nexternal causes.  Of such things, they see that those which\nquickly come to pass--that is, quickly come into existence--quickly\nalso disappear; whereas they regard as more difficult of\naccomplishment--that is, not so easily brought into\nexistence--those things which they conceive as more complicated.\nHowever, to do away with this misconception, I need not here\nshow the measure of truth in the proverb, \"What comes quickly,\ngoes quickly,\" nor discuss whether, from the point of view of\nuniversal nature, all things are equally easy, or otherwise: I\nneed only remark that I am not here speaking of things, which\ncome to pass through causes external to themselves, but only of\nsubstances which (by Prop. vi.) cannot be produced by any\nexternal cause.  Things which are produced by external causes,\nwhether they consist of many parts or few, owe whatsoever\nperfection or reality they possess solely to the efficacy of\ntheir external cause;  and therefore their existence arises\nsolely from the perfection of their external cause, not from\ntheir own.  Contrariwise, whatsoever perfection is possessed by\nsubstance is due to no external cause; wherefore the existence\nof substance must arise solely from its own nature, which is\nnothing else but its essence.  Thus, the perfection of a thing\ndoes not annul its existence, but, on the contrary, asserts it.\nImperfection, on the other hand, does annul it; therefore we\ncannot be more certain of the existence of anything, than of the\nexistence of a being absolutely infinite or perfect--that is, of\nGod.  For inasmuch as his essence excludes all imperfection, and\ninvolves absolute perfection, all cause for doubt concerning his\nexistence is done away, and the utmost certainty on the question\nis given.  This, I think, will be evident to every moderately\nattentive reader.\nPROP. XII.  No attribute of substance can be conceived from which\nit would follow that substance can be divided.\nProof.--The parts into which substance as thus conceived would\nbe divided either will retain the nature of substance, or they\nwill not.  If the former, then (by Prop. viii.) each part will\nnecessarily be infinite, and (by Prop. vi.) self--caused, and (by\nProp. v.) will perforce consist of a different attribute, so\nthat, in that case, several substances could be formed out of one\nsubstance, which (by Prop. vi.) is absurd.  Moreover, the parts\n(by Prop. ii.) would have nothing in common with their whole, and\nthe whole (by Def. iv. and Prop. x.) could both exist and be\nconceived without its parts, which everyone will admit to be\nabsurd.  If we adopt the second alternative--namely, that the\nparts will not retain the nature of substance--then, if the whole\nsubstance were divided into equal parts, it would lose the nature\nof substance, and would cease to exist, which (by Prop. vii.) is\nabsurd.\nPROP. XIII.  Substance absolutely infinite is indivisible.\nProof.--If it could be divided, the parts into which it was\ndivided would either retain the nature of absolutely infinite\nsubstance, or they would not.  If the former, we should have\nseveral substances of the same nature, which (by Prop. v.) is\nabsurd.  If the latter, then (by Prop. vii.) substance absolutely\ninfinite could cease to exist, which (by Prop. xi.) is also\nabsurd.\nCorollary.--It follows, that no substance, and consequently no\nextended substance, in so far as it is substance, is divisible.\nNote.--The indivisibility of substance may be more easily\nunderstood as follows.  The nature of substance can only be\nconceived as infinite, and by a part of substance, nothing else\ncan be understood than finite substance, which (by Prop. viii)\ninvolves a manifest contradiction.\nPROP. XIV.  Besides God no substance can be granted or conceived.\nProof.--As God is a being absolutely infinite, of whom no\nattribute that expresses the essence of substance can be denied\n(by Def. vi.), and he necessarily exists (by Prop. xi.); if any\nsubstance besides God were granted, it would have to be explained\nby some attribute of God, and thus two substances with the same\nattribute would exist, which (by Prop. v.) is absurd; therefore,\nbesides God no substance can be granted, or, consequently, be\nconceived.  If it could be conceived, it would necessarily have\nto be conceived as existent; but this (by the first part of this\nproof) is absurd.  Therefore, besides God no substance can be\ngranted or conceived.  Q.E.D.\nCorollary I.--Clearly, therefore: 1.  God is one, that is (by\nDef. vi.) only one substance can be granted in the universe, and\nthat substance is absolutely infinite, as we have already\nindicated (in the note to Prop. x.).\nCorollary II.--It follows:  2.  That extension and thought\nare either attributes of God or (by Ax. i.) accidents\n(affectiones) of the attributes of God.\nPROP. XV.  Whatsoever is, is in God, and without God nothing can\nbe, or be conceived.\nProof.--Besides God, no substance is granted or can be\nconceived (by Prop. xiv.), that is (by Def. iii.) nothing which\nis in itself and is conceived through itself.  But modes (by Def.\nv.) can neither be, nor be conceived without substance;\nwherefore they can only be in the divine nature, and can only\nthrough it be conceived.  But substances and modes form the sum\ntotal of existence (by Ax. i.), therefore, without God nothing\ncan be, or be conceived.  Q.E.D.\nNote.--Some assert that God, like a man, consists of body and\nmind, and is susceptible of passions.  How far such persons have\nstrayed from the truth is sufficiently evident from what has been\nsaid.  But these I pass over.  For all who have in anywise\nreflected on the divine nature deny that God has a body.  Of this\nthey find excellent proof in the fact that we understand by body\na definite quantity, so long, so broad, so deep, bounded by a\ncertain shape, and it is the height of absurdity to predicate\nsuch a thing of God, a being absolutely infinite.  But meanwhile\nby other reasons with which they try to prove their point, they\nshow that they think corporeal or extended substance wholly apart\nfrom the divine nature, and say it was created by God.  Wherefrom\nthe divine nature can have been created, they are wholly ignorant;\nthus they clearly show, that they do not know the meaning of\ntheir own words.  I myself have proved sufficiently clearly, at\nany rate in my own judgment (Coroll. Prop. vi, and note 2, Prop.\nviii.), that no substance can be produced or created by anything\nother than itself.  Further, I showed (in Prop. xiv.), that\nbesides God no substance can be granted or conceived.  Hence we\ndrew the conclusion that extended substance is one of the\ninfinite attributes of God.  However, in order to explain more\nfully, I will refute the arguments of my adversaries, which all\nstart from the following points:----\nExtended substance, in so far as it is substance, consists,\nas they think, in parts, wherefore they deny that it can be\ninfinite, or consequently, that it can appertain to God.  This\nthey illustrate with many examples, of which I will take one or\ntwo.  If extended substance, they say, is infinite, let it be\nconceived to be divided into two parts; each part will then be\neither finite or infinite.  If the former, then infinite\nsubstance is composed of two finite parts, which is absurd.  If\nthe latter, then one infinite will be twice as large as another\ninfinite, which is also absurd.\nFurther, if an infinite line be measured out in foot lengths,\nit will consist of an infinite number of such parts; it would\nequally consist of an infinite number of parts, if each part\nmeasured only an inch: therefore, one infinity would be twelve\ntimes as great as the other.\nLastly, if from a single point there be conceived to be drawn\ntwo diverging lines which at first are at a definite distance\napart, but are produced to infinity, it is certain that the\ndistance between the two lines will be continually increased,\nuntil at length it changes from definite to indefinable.  As\nthese absurdities follow, it is said, from considering quantity\nas infinite, the conclusion is drawn, that extended substance\nmust necessarily be finite, and, consequently, cannot appertain\nto the nature of God.\nThe second argument is also drawn from God's supreme\nperfection.  God, it is said, inasmuch as he is a supremely\nperfect being, cannot be passive; but extended substance,\ninsofar as it is divisible, is passive.  It follows, therefore,\nthat extended substance does not appertain to the essence of God.\nSuch are the arguments I find on the subject in writers, who\nby them try to prove that extended substance is unworthy of the\ndivine nature, and cannot possibly appertain thereto.  However, I\nthink an attentive reader will see that I have already answered\ntheir propositions; for all their arguments are founded on the\nhypothesis that extended substance is composed of parts, and such\na hypothesis I have shown (Prop. xii., and Coroll. Prop. xiii.)\nto be absurd.  Moreover, anyone who reflects will see that all\nthese absurdities (if absurdities they be, which I am not now\ndiscussing), from which it is sought to extract the conclusion\nthat extended substance is finite, do not at all follow from the\nnotion of an infinite quantity, but merely from the notion that\nan infinite quantity is measurable, and composed of finite parts\ntherefore, the only fair conclusion to be drawn is that:\ninfinite quantity is not measurable, and cannot be composed of\nfinite parts.  This is exactly what we have already proved (in\nProp. xii.).  Wherefore the weapon which they aimed at us has in\nreality recoiled upon themselves.  If, from this absurdity of\ntheirs, they persist in drawing the conclusion that extended\nsubstance must be finite, they will in good sooth be acting like\na man who asserts that circles have the properties of squares,\nand, finding himself thereby landed in absurdities, proceeds to\ndeny that circles have any center, from which all lines drawn to\nthe circumference are equal.  For, taking extended substance,\nwhich can only be conceived as infinite, one, and indivisible\n(Props. viii., v., xii.) they assert, in order to prove that it\nis finite, that it is composed of finite parts, and that it can\nbe multiplied and divided.\nSo, also, others, after asserting that a line is composed of\npoints, can produce many arguments to prove that a line cannot be\ninfinitely divided.  Assuredly it is not less absurd to assert\nthat extended substance is made up of bodies or parts, than it\nwould be to assert that a solid is made up of surfaces, a surface\nof lines, and a line of points.  This must be admitted by all who\nknow clear reason to be infallible, and most of all by those who\ndeny the possibility of a vacuum.  For if extended substance\ncould be so divided that its parts were really separate, why\nshould not one part admit of being destroyed, the others\nremaining joined together as before?  And why should all be so\nfitted into one another as to leave no vacuum?  Surely in the\ncase of things, which are really distinct one from the other, one\ncan exist without the other, and can remain in its original\ncondition.  As, then,  there does not exist a vacuum in nature\n(of which anon), but all parts are bound to come together to\nprevent it, it follows from this that the parts cannot really be\ndistinguished, and that extended substance in so far as it is\nsubstance cannot be divided.\nIf anyone asks me the further question, Why are we naturally\nso prone to divide quantity?  I answer, that quantity is\nconceived by us in two ways; in the abstract and superficially,\nas we imagine it; or as substance, as we conceive it solely by\nthe intellect.  If, then, we regard quantity as it is represented\nin our imagination, which we often and more easily do, we shall\nfind that it is finite, divisible, and compounded of parts; but\nif we regard it as it is represented in our intellect, and\nconceive it as substance, which it is very difficult to do, we\nshall then, as I have sufficiently proved, find that it is\ninfinite, one, and indivisible.  This will be plain enough to all\nwho make a distinction between the intellect and the imagination,\nespecially if it be remembered, that matter is everywhere the\nsame, that its parts are not distinguishable, except in so far as\nwe conceive matter as diversely modified, whence its parts are\ndistinguished, not really, but modally.  For instance, water, in\nso far as it is water, we conceive to be divided, and its parts\nto be separated one from the other; but not in so far as it is\nextended substance; from this point of view it is neither\nseparated nor divisible.  Further, water, in so far as it is\nwater, is produced and corrupted; but, in so far as it is\nsubstance, it is neither produced nor corrupted.\nI think I have now answered the second argument; it is, in\nfact, founded on the same assumption as the first--namely, that\nmatter, in so far as it is substance, is divisible, and composed\nof parts.  Even if it were so, I do not know why it should be\nconsidered unworthy of the divine nature, inasmuch as besides God\n(by Prop. xiv.) no substance can be granted, wherefrom it could\nreceive its modifications.  All things, I repeat, are in God, and\nall things which come to pass, come to pass solely through the\nlaws of the infinite nature of God, and follow (as I will shortly\nshow) from the necessity of his essence.  Wherefore it can in\nnowise be said, that God is passive in respect to anything other\nthan himself, or that extended substance is unworthy of the\nDivine nature, even if it be supposed divisible, so long as it is\ngranted to be infinite and eternal.  But enough of this for the\npresent.\nPROP. XVI.  From the necessity of the divine nature must follow\nan infinite number of things in infinite ways--that is, all things\nwhich can fall within the sphere of infinite intellect.\nProof.--This proposition will be clear to everyone, who\nremembers that from the given definition of any thing the\nintellect infers several properties, which really necessarily\nfollow therefrom (that is, from the actual essence of the thing\ndefined); and it infers more properties in proportion as the\ndefinition of the thing expresses more reality, that is, in\nproportion as the essence of the thing defined involves more\nreality.  Now, as the divine nature has absolutely infinite\nattributes (by Def. vi.), of which each expresses infinite\nessence after its kind, it follows that from the necessity of its\nnature an infinite number of things (that is, everything which\ncan fall within the sphere of an infinite intellect) must\nnecessarily follow.  Q.E.D.\nCorollary I.--Hence it follows, that God is the efficient\ncause of all that can fall within the sphere of an infinite\nintellect.\nCorollary II.--It also follows that God is a cause in himself,\nand not through an accident of his nature.\nCorollary III.--It follows, thirdly, that God is the\nabsolutely first cause.\nPROP. XVII.  God acts solely by the laws of his own nature, and\nis not constrained by anyone.\nProof.--We have just shown (in Prop. xvi.), that solely from\nthe necessity of the divine nature, or, what is the same thing,\nsolely from the laws of his nature, an infinite number of things\nabsolutely follow in an infinite number of ways; and we proved\n(in Prop. xv.), that without God nothing can be nor be conceived\nbut that all things are in God.  Wherefore nothing can exist;\noutside himself, whereby he can be conditioned or constrained to\nact.  Wherefore God acts solely by the laws of his own nature,\nand is not constrained by anyone.  Q.E.D.\nCorollary I.--It follows: 1.  That there can be no cause\nwhich, either extrinsically or intrinsically, besides the\nperfection of his own nature, moves God to act.\nCorollary II.--It follows: 2.  That God is the sole free\ncause.  For God alone exists by the sole necessity of his nature\n(by Prop. xi. and Prop. xiv., Coroll. i.), and acts by the sole\nnecessity of his own nature, wherefore God is (by Def. vii.) the\nsole free cause.  Q.E.D.\nNote.--Others think that God is a free cause, because he can,\nas they think, bring it about, that those things which we have\nsaid follow from his nature--that is, which are in his power,\nshould not come to pass, or should not be produced by him.  But\nthis is the same as if they said, that God could bring it about,\nthat it should follow from the nature of a triangle that its\nthree interior angles should not be equal to two right angles;\nor that from a given cause no effect should follow, which is\nabsurd.\nMoreover, I will show below, without the aid of this\nproposition, that neither intellect nor will appertain to God's\nnature.  I know that there are many who think that they can show,\nthat supreme intellect and free will do appertain to God's nature;\nfor they say they know of nothing more perfect, which they can\nattribute to God, than that which is the highest perfection in\nourselves.  Further, although they conceive God as actually\nsupremely intelligent, they yet do not believe that he can bring\ninto existence everything which he actually understands, for they\nthink that they would thus destroy God's power.  If, they\ncontend, God had created everything which is in his intellect, he\nwould not be able to create anything more, and this, they think,\nwould clash with God's omnipotence; therefore, they prefer to\nasset that God is indifferent to all things, and that he creates\nnothing except that which he has decided, by some absolute\nexercise of will, to create.  However, I think I have shown\nsufficiently clearly (by Prop. xvi.), that from God's supreme\npower, or infinite nature, an infinite number of things--that is,\nall things have necessarily flowed forth in an infinite number of\nways, or always flow from the same necessity; in the same way as\nfrom the nature of a triangle it follows from eternity and for\neternity, that its three interior angles are equal to two right\nangles.  Wherefore the omnipotence of God has been displayed from\nall eternity, and will for all eternity remain in the same state\nof activity.  This manner of treating the question attributes to\nGod an omnipotence, in my opinion, far more perfect.  For,\notherwise, we are compelled to confess that God understands an\ninfinite number of creatable things, which he will never be able\nto create, for, if he created all that he understands, he would,\naccording to this showing, exhaust his omnipotence, and render\nhimself imperfect.  Wherefore, in order to establish that God is\nperfect, we should be reduced to establishing at the same time,\nthat he cannot bring to pass everything over which his power\nextends; this seems to be a hypothesis most absurd, and most\nrepugnant to God's omnipotence.\nFurther (to say a word here concerning the intellect and the\nwill which we attribute to God), if intellect and will appertain\nto the eternal essence of God, we must take these words in some\nsignificance quite different from those they usually bear.  For\nintellect and will, which should constitute the essence of God,\nwould perforce be as far apart as the poles from the human\nintellect and will, in fact, would have nothing in common with\nthem but the name; there would be about as much correspondence\nbetween the two as there is between the Dog, the heavenly\nconstellation, and a dog, an animal that barks.  This I will\nprove as follows.  If intellect belongs to the divine nature, it\ncannot be in nature, as ours is generally thought to be,\nposterior to, or simultaneous with the things understood,\ninasmuch as God is prior to all things by reason of his causality\n(Prop. xvi., Coroll. i.).  On the contrary, the truth and formal\nessence of things is as it is, because it exists by\nrepresentation as such in the intellect of God.  Wherefore the\nintellect of God, in so far as it is conceived to constitute\nGod's essence, is, in reality, the cause of things, both of their\nessence and of their existence.  This seems to have been\nrecognized by those who have asserted, that God's intellect,\nGod's will, and God's power, are one and the same.  As,\ntherefore, God's intellect is the sole cause of things, namely,\nboth of their essence and existence, it must necessarily differ\nfrom them in respect to its essence, and in respect to its\nexistence.  For a cause differs from a thing it causes, precisely\nin the quality which the latter gains from the former.\nFor example, a man is the cause of another man's existence,\nbut not of his essence (for the latter is an eternal truth), and,\ntherefore, the two men may be entirely similar in essence, but\nmust be different in existence; and hence if the existence of\none of them cease, the existence of the other will not\nnecessarily cease also; but if the essence of one could be\ndestroyed, and be made false, the essence of the other would be\ndestroyed also.  Wherefore, a thing which is the cause both of\nthe essence and of the existence of a given effect, must differ\nfrom such effect both in respect to its essence, and also in\nrespect to its existence.  Now the intellect of God is the cause\nboth of the essence and the existence of our intellect;\ntherefore, the intellect of God in so far as it is conceived to\nconstitute the divine essence, differs from our intellect both in\nrespect to essence and in respect to existence, nor can it in\nanywise agree therewith save in name, as we said before.  The\nreasoning would be identical in the case of the will, as anyone\ncan easily see.\nPROP. XVIII.  God is the indwelling and not the transient cause\nof all things.\nProof.--All things which are, are in God, and must be\nconceived through God (by Prop. xv.), therefore (by Prop. xvi.,\nCoroll. i.) God is the cause of those things which are in him.\nThis is our first point.  Further, besides God there can be no\nsubstance (by Prop. xiv.), that is nothing in itself external to\nGod.  This is our second point.  God, therefore, is the\nindwelling and not the transient cause of all things.  Q.E.D.\nPROP. XIX.  God, and all the attributes of God, are eternal.\nProof.--God (by Def. vi.) is substance, which (by Prop. xi.)\nnecessarily exists, that is (by Prop. vii.) existence appertains\nto its nature, or (what is the same thing) follows from its\ndefinition; therefore, God is eternal (by Def. viii.).  Further,\nby the attributes of God we must understand that which (by Def.\niv.) expresses the essence of the divine substance--in other\nwords, that which appertains to substance: that, I say, should\nbe involved in the attributes of substance.  Now eternity\nappertains to the nature of substance (as I have already shown in\nProp. vii.); therefore, eternity must appertain to each of the\nattributes, and thus all are eternal.  Q.E.D.\nNote.--This proposition is also evident from the manner in\nwhich (in Prop. xi.) I demonstrated the existence of God; it is\nevident, I repeat, from that proof, that the existence of God,\nlike his essence, is an eternal truth.  Further (in Prop. xix. of\nmy \"Principles of the Cartesian Philosophy\"), I have proved the\neternity of God, in another manner, which I need not here repeat.\nPROP. XX.  The existence of God and his essence are one and the\nsame.\nProof.--God (by the last Prop.) and all his attributes are\neternal, that is (by Def. viii.) each of his attributes expresses\nexistence.  Therefore the same\nattributes of God which explain his eternal essence, explain at\nthe same time his eternal existence--in other words, that which\nconstitutes God's essence constitutes at the same time his\nexistence.  Wherefore God's existence and God's essence are one\nand the same.  Q.E.D.\nCoroll. I.--Hence it follows that God's existence, like his\nessence, is an eternal truth.\nCoroll. II--Secondly, it follows that God, and all the\nattributes of God, are unchangeable.  For if they could be\nchanged in respect to existence, they must also be able to be\nchanged in respect to essence--that is, obviously, be changed from\ntrue to false, which is absurd.\nPROP. XXI.  All things which follow from the absolute nature of\nany attribute of God must always exist and be infinite, or, in\nother words, are eternal and infinite through the said attribute.\nProof.--Conceive, if it be possible (supposing the proposition\nto be denied), that something in some attribute of God can follow\nfrom the absolute nature of the said attribute, and that at the\nsame time it is finite, and has a conditioned existence or\nduration; for instance, the idea of God expressed in the\nattribute thought.  Now thought, in so far as it is supposed to\nbe an attribute of God, is necessarily (by Prop. xi.) in its\nnature infinite. But, in so far as it possesses the idea of God,\nit is supposed finite.  It cannot, however, be conceived as\nfinite, unless it be limited by thought (by Def. ii.); but it is\nnot limited by thought itself, in so far as it has constituted\nthe idea of God (for so far it is supposed to be finite);\ntherefore, it is limited by thought, in so far as it has not\nconstituted the idea of God, which nevertheless (by Prop. xi.)\nmust necessarily exist.\nWe have now granted, therefore, thought not constituting the\nidea of God, and, accordingly, the idea of God does not naturally\nfollow from its nature in so far as it is absolute thought (for\nit is conceived as constituting, and also as not constituting,\nthe idea of God), which is against our hypothesis.  Wherefore, if\nthe idea of God expressed in the attribute thought, or, indeed,\nanything else in any attribute of God (for we may take any\nexample, as the proof is of universal application) follows from\nthe necessity of the absolute nature of the said attribute, the\nsaid thing must necessarily be infinite, which was our first\npoint.\nFurthermore, a thing which thus follows from the necessity of\nthe nature of any attribute cannot have a limited duration.  For\nif it can, suppose a thing, which follows from the necessity of\nthe nature of some attribute, to exist in some attribute of God,\nfor instance, the idea of God expressed in the attribute thought,\nand let it be supposed at some time not to have existed, or to be\nabout not to exist.\nNow thought being an attribute of God, must necessarily exist\nunchanged (by Prop. xi., and Prop. xx., Coroll. ii.); and beyond\nthe limits of the duration of the idea of God (supposing the\nlatter at some time not to have existed, or not to be going to\nexist) thought would perforce have existed without the idea of\nGod, which is contrary to our hypothesis, for we supposed that,\nthought being given, the idea of God necessarily flowed\ntherefrom.  Therefore the idea of God expressed in thought, or\nanything which necessarily follows from the absolute nature of\nsome attribute of God, cannot have a limited duration, but\nthrough the said attribute is eternal, which is our second point.\nBear in mind that the same proposition may be affirmed of\nanything, which in any attribute necessarily follows from God's\nabsolute nature.\nPROP. XXII.  Whatsoever follows from any attribute of God, in so\nfar as it is modified by a modification, which exists necessarily\nand as infinite, through the said attribute, must also exist\nnecessarily and as infinite.\nProof.--The proof of this proposition is similar to that of\nthe preceding one.\nPROP. XXIII.  Every mode, which exists both necessarily and as\ninfinite, must necessarily follow either from the absolute nature\nof some attribute of God, or from an attribute modified by a\nmodification which exists necessarily, and as infinite.\nProof.--A mode exists in something else, through which it must\nbe conceived (Def. v.), that is (Prop. xv.), it exists solely in\nGod, and solely through God can be conceived. If therefore a mode\nis conceived as necessarily existing and infinite, it must\nnecessarily be inferred or perceived through some attribute of\nGod, in so far as such attribute is conceived as expressing the\ninfinity and necessity of existence, in other words (Def. viii.)\neternity; that is, in so far as it is considered absolutely.  A\nmode, therefore, which necessarily exists as infinite, must\nfollow from the absolute nature of some attribute of God, either\nimmediately (Prop. xxi.) or through the means of some\nmodification, which follows from the absolute nature of the said\nattribute; that is (by Prop. xxii.), which exists necessarily\nand as infinite.\nPROP. XXIV.  The essence of things produced by God does not\ninvolve existence.\nProof.--This proposition is evident from Def. i.  For that of\nwhich the nature (considered in itself) involves existence is\nself--caused, and exists by the sole necessity of its own nature.\nCorollary.--Hence it follows that God is not only the cause of\nthings coming into existence, but also of their continuing in\nexistence, that is, in scholastic phraseology, God is cause of\nthe being of things (essendi rerum).  For whether things exist,\nor do not exist, whenever we contemplate their essence, we see\nthat it involves neither existence nor duration; consequently,\nit cannot be the cause of either the one or the other.  God must\nbe the sole cause, inasmuch as to him alone does existence\nappertain.  (Prop. xiv. Coroll. i.) Q.E.D.\nPROP. XXV.  God is the efficient cause not only of the existence\nof things, but also of their essence.\nProof.--If this be denied, then God is not the cause of the\nessence of things; and therefore the essence of things can (by\nAx. iv.) be conceived without God.  This (by Prop. xv.) is\nabsurd.  Therefore, God is the cause of the essence of things.\nQ.E.D.\nNote.--This proposition follows more clearly from Prop. xvi.\nFor it is evident thereby that, given the divine nature, the\nessence of things must be inferred from it, no less than their\nexistence--in a word, God must be called the cause of all things,\nin the same sense as he is called the cause of himself.  This\nwill be made still clearer by the following corollary.\nCorollary.--Individual things are nothing but modifications of\nthe attributes of God, or modes by which the attributes of God\nare expressed in a fixed and definite manner.  The proof appears\nfrom Prop. xv. and Def. v.\nPROP. XXVI.  A thing which is conditioned to act in a particular\nmanner, has necessarily been thus conditioned by God; and that\nwhich has not been conditioned by God cannot condition itself to\nact.\nProof.--That by which things are said to be conditioned to act\nin a particular manner is necessarily something positive (this is\nobvious); therefore both of its essence and of its existence God\nby the necessity of his nature is the efficient cause (Props.\nxxv. and xvi.); this is our first point.  Our second point is\nplainly to be inferred therefrom.  For if a thing, which has not\nbeen conditioned by God, could condition itself, the first part\nof our proof would be false, and this, as we have shown is\nabsurd.\nPROP. XXVII.  A thing, which has been conditioned by God to act\nin a particular way, cannot render itself unconditioned.\nProof.--This proposition is evident from the third axiom.\nPROP. XXVIII.  Every individual thing, or everything which is\nfinite and has a conditioned existence, cannot exist or be\nconditioned to act, unless it be conditioned for existence and\naction by a cause other than itself, which also is finite, and\nhas a conditioned existence; and likewise this cause cannot in\nits turn exist, or be conditioned to act, unless it be\nconditioned for existence and action by another cause, which also\nis finite, and has a conditioned existence, and so on to\ninfinity.\nProof.--Whatsoever is conditioned to exist and act, has been\nthus conditioned by God (by Prop. xxvi. and Prop. xxiv.,\nCoroll.).\nBut that which is finite, and has a conditioned existence,\ncannot be produced by the absolute nature of any attribute of God;\nfor whatsoever follows from the absolute nature of any\nattribute of God is infinite and eternal (by Prop. xxi.).  It\nmust, therefore, follow from some attribute of God, in so far as\nthe said attribute is considered as in some way modified; for\nsubstance and modes make up the sum total of existence (by Ax. i.\nand Def. iii., v.), while modes are merely modifications of the\nattributes of God.  But from God, or from any of his attributes,\nin so far as the latter is modified by a modification infinite\nand eternal, a conditioned thing cannot follow.  Wherefore it\nmust follow from, or be conditioned for, existence and action by\nGod or one of his attributes, in so far as the latter are\nmodified by some modification which is finite, and has a\nconditioned existence.  This is our first point.  Again, this\ncause or this modification (for the reason by which we\nestablished the first part of this proof) must in its turn be\nconditioned by another cause, which also is finite, and has a\nconditioned existence, and, again, this last by another (for the\nsame reason); and so on (for the same reason) to infinity.\nQ.E.D.\nNote.--As certain things must be produced immediately by God,\nnamely those things which necessarily follow from his absolute\nnature, through the means of these primary attributes, which,\nnevertheless, can neither exist nor be conceived without God, it\nfollows:--1. That God is absolutely the proximate cause of those\nthings immediately produced by him.  I say absolutely, not after\nhis kind, as is usually stated.  For the effects of God cannot\neither exist or be conceived without a cause (Prop. xv. and Prop.\nxxiv. Coroll.).  2. That God cannot properly be styled the remote\ncause of individual things, except for the sake of distinguishing\nthese from what he immediately produces, or rather from what\nfollows from his absolute nature.  For, by a remote cause, we\nunderstand a cause which is in no way conjoined to the effect.\nBut all things which are, are in God, and so depend on God, that\nwithout him they can neither be nor be conceived.\nPROP. XXIX.  Nothing in the universe is contingent, but all\nthings are conditioned to exist and operate in a particular\nmanner by the necessity of the divine nature.\nProof.--Whatsoever is, is in God (Prop. xv.).  But God cannot\nbe called a thing contingent.  For (by Prop. xi.) he exists\nnecessarily, and not contingently.  Further, the modes of the\ndivine nature follow therefrom necessarily, and not contingently\n(Prop. xvi.); and they thus follow, whether we consider the\ndivine nature absolutely, or whether we consider it as in any way\nconditioned to act (Prop. xxvii.).  Further, God is not only the\ncause of these modes, in so far as they simply exist (by Prop.\nxxiv, Coroll.), but also in so far as they are considered as\nconditioned for operating in a particular manner (Prop. xxvi.).\nIf they be not conditioned by God (Prop. xxvi.), it is\nimpossible, and not contingent, that they should condition\nthemselves; contrariwise, if they be conditioned by God, it is\nimpossible, and not contingent, that they should render\nthemselves unconditioned. Wherefore all things are conditioned by\nthe necessity of the divine nature, not only to exist, but also\nto exist and operate in a particular manner, and there is nothing\nthat is contingent.  Q.E.D.\nNote.--Before going any further, I wish here to explain, what\nwe should understand by nature viewed as active (natura\nnaturans), and nature viewed as passive (natura naturata).  I say\nto explain, or rather call attention to it, for I think that,\nfrom what has been said, it is sufficiently clear, that by nature\nviewed as active we should understand that which is in itself,\nand is conceived through itself, or those attributes of\nsubstance, which express eternal and infinite essence, in other\nwords (Prop. xiv., Coroll. i., and Prop. xvii., Coroll. ii) God,\nin so far as he is considered as a free cause.\nBy nature viewed as passive I understand all that which\nfollows from the necessity of the nature of God, or of any of the\nattributes of God, that is, all the modes of the attributes of\nGod, in so far as they are considered as things which are in God,\nand which without God cannot exist or be conceived.\nPROP. XXX.  Intellect, in function (actu) finite, or in function\ninfinite, must comprehend the attributes of God and the\nmodifications of God, and nothing else.\nProof.--A true idea must agree with its object (Ax. vi.); in\nother words (obviously), that which is contained in the intellect\nin representation must necessarily be granted in nature.  But in\nnature (by Prop. xiv., Coroll. i.) there is no substance save\nGod, nor any modifications save those (Prop. xv.) which are in\nGod, and cannot without God either be or be conceived.  Therefore\nthe intellect, in function finite, or in function infinite, must\ncomprehend the attributes of God and the modifications of God,\nand nothing else.  Q.E.D.\nPROP. XXXI.  The intellect in function, whether finite or\ninfinite, as will, desire, love, &c., should be referred to\npassive nature and not to active nature.\nProof.--By the intellect we do not (obviously) mean absolute\nthought, but only a certain mode of thinking, differing from\nother modes, such as love, desire, &c., and therefore (Def. v.)\nrequiring to be conceived through absolute thought.  It must (by\nProp. xv. and Def. vi.), through some attribute of God which\nexpresses the eternal and infinite essence of thought, be so\nconceived, that without such attribute it could neither be nor be\nconceived.  It must therefore be referred to nature passive\nrather than to nature active, as must also the other modes of\nthinking.  Q.E.D.\nNote.--I do not here, by speaking of intellect in function,\nadmit that there is such a thing as intellect in potentiality:\nbut, wishing to avoid all confusion, I desire to speak only of\nwhat is most clearly perceived by us, namely, of the very act of\nunderstanding, than which nothing is more clearly perceived.  For\nwe cannot perceive anything without adding to our knowledge of\nthe act of understanding.\nPROP. XXXII.  Will cannot be called a free cause, but only a\nnecessary cause.\nProof.--Will is only a particular mode of thinking, like\nintellect; therefore (by Prop. xxviii.) no volition can exist,\nnor be conditioned to act, unless it be conditioned by some cause\nother than itself, which cause is conditioned by a third cause,\nand so on to infinity.  But if will be supposed infinite, it must\nalso be conditioned to exist and act by God, not by virtue of his\nbeing substance absolutely infinite, but by virtue of his\npossessing an attribute which expresses the infinite and eternal\nessence of thought (by Prop. xxiii.).  Thus, however it be\nconceived, whether as finite or infinite, it requires a cause by\nwhich it should be conditioned to exist and act.  Thus (Def.\nvii.) it cannot be called a free cause, but only a necessary or\nconstrained cause.  Q.E.D.\nCoroll. I.--Hence it follows, first, that God does not act\naccording to freedom of the will.\nCoroll. II.--It follows, secondly, that will and intellect\nstand in the same relation to the nature of God as do motion, and\nrest, and absolutely all natural phenomena, which must be\nconditioned by God (Prop. xxix.) to exist and act in a particular\nmanner.  For will, like the rest, stands in need of a cause, by\nwhich it is conditioned to exist and act in a particular manner.\nAnd although, when will or intellect be granted, an infinite\nnumber of results may follow, yet God cannot on that account be\nsaid to act from freedom of the will, any more than the infinite\nnumber of results from motion and rest would justify us in saying\nthat motion and rest act by free will.  Wherefore will no more\nappertains to God than does anything else in nature, but stands\nin the same relation to him as motion, rest, and the like, which\nwe have shown to follow from the necessity of the divine nature,\nand to be conditioned by it to exist and act in a particular\nmanner.\nPROP. XXXIII.  Things could not have been brought into being by\nGod in any manner or in any order different from that which has\nin fact obtained.\nProof--All things necessarily follow from the nature of God\n(Prop. xvi.), and by the nature of God are conditioned to exist\nand act in a particular way (Prop. xxix.).  If things, therefore,\ncould have been of a different nature, or have been conditioned\nto act in a different way, so that the order of nature would have\nbeen different, God's nature would also have been able to be\ndifferent from what it now is; and therefore (by Prop. xi.) that\ndifferent nature also would have perforce existed, and\nconsequently there would have been able to be two or more Gods.\nThis (by Prop. xiv., Coroll. i.) is absurd.  Therefore things\ncould not have been brought into being by God in any other\nmanner, &c.  Q.E.D.\nNote I.--As I have thus shown, more clearly than the sun at\nnoonday, that there is nothing to justify us in calling things\ncontingent, I wish to explain briefly what meaning we shall\nattach to the word contingent; but I will first explain the\nwords necessary and impossible.\nA thing is called necessary either in respect to its essence\nor in respect to its cause; for the existence of a thing\nnecessarily follows, either from its essence and definition, or\nfrom a given efficient cause.  For similar reasons a thing is\nsaid to be impossible; namely, inasmuch as its essence or\ndefinition involves a contradiction, or because no external cause\nis granted, which is conditioned to produce such an effect; but\na thing can in no respect be called contingent, save in relation\nto the imperfection of our knowledge.\nA thing of which we do not know whether the essence does or\ndoes not involve a contradiction, or of which, knowing that it\ndoes not involve a contradiction, we are still in doubt\nconcerning the existence, because the order of causes escapes\nus,--such a thing, I say, cannot appear to us either necessary or\nimpossible.  Wherefore we call it contingent or possible.\nNote II.--It clearly follows from what we have said, that\nthings have been brought into being by God in the highest\nperfection, inasmuch as they have necessarily followed from a\nmost perfect nature.  Nor does this prove any imperfection in\nGod, for it has compelled us to affirm his perfection.  From its\ncontrary proposition, we should clearly gather (as I have just\nshown), that God is not supremely perfect, for if things had been\nbrought into being in any other way, we should have to assign to\nGod a nature different from that, which we are bound to attribute\nto him from the consideration of an absolutely perfect being.\nI do not doubt, that many will scout this idea as absurd, and\nwill refuse to give their minds up to contemplating it, simply\nbecause they are accustomed to assign to God a freedom very\ndifferent from that which we (Def. vii.) have deduced.  They\nassign to him, in short, absolute free will.  However, I am also\nconvinced that if such persons reflect on the matter, and duly\nweigh in their minds our series of propositions, they will reject\nsuch freedom as they now attribute to God, not only as nugatory,\nbut also as a great impediment to organized knowledge.  There is\nno need for me to repeat what I have said in the note to Prop.\nxvii.  But, for the sake of my opponents, I will show further,\nthat although it be granted that will pertains to the essence of\nGod, it nevertheless follows from his perfection, that things\ncould not have been by him created other than they are, or in a\ndifferent order; this is easily proved, if we reflect on what\nour opponents themselves concede, namely, that it depends solely\non the decree and will of God, that each thing is what it is.  If\nit were otherwise, God would not be the cause of all things.\nFurther, that all the decrees of God have been ratified from all\neternity by God himself.  If it were otherwise, God would be\nconvicted of imperfection or change.  But in eternity there is no\nsuch thing as when, before, or after; hence it follows solely\nfrom the perfection of God, that God never can decree, or never\ncould have decreed anything but what is; that God did not exist\nbefore his decrees, and would not exist without them.  But, it is\nsaid, supposing that God had made a different universe, or had\nordained other decrees from all eternity concerning nature and\nher order, we could not therefore conclude any imperfection in\nGod.  But persons who say this must admit that God can change his\ndecrees.  For if God had ordained any decrees concerning nature\nand her order, different from those which he has ordained--in\nother words, if he had willed and conceived something different\nconcerning nature--he would perforce have had a different\nintellect from that which he has, and also a different will.  But\nif it were allowable to assign to God a different intellect and a\ndifferent will, without any change in his essence or his\nperfection, what would there be to prevent him changing the\ndecrees which he has made concerning created things, and\nnevertheless remaining perfect?  For his intellect and will\nconcerning things created and their order are the same, in\nrespect to his essence and perfection, however they be conceived.\nFurther, all the philosophers whom I have read admit that\nGod's intellect is entirely actual, and not at all potential; as\nthey also admit that God's intellect, and God's will, and God's\nessence are identical, it follows that, if God had had a\ndifferent actual intellect and a different will, his essence\nwould also have been different; and thus, as I concluded at\nfirst, if things had been brought into being by God in a\ndifferent way from that which has obtained, God's intellect and\nwill, that is (as is admitted) his essence would perforce have\nbeen different, which is absurd.\nAs these things could not have been brought into being by God\nin any but the actual way and order which has obtained; and as\nthe truth of this proposition follows from the supreme perfection\nof God; we can have no sound reason for persuading ourselves to\nbelieve that God did not wish to create all the things which were\nin his intellect, and to create them in the same perfection as he\nhad understood them.\nBut, it will be said, there is in things no perfection nor\nimperfection; that which is in them, and which causes them to be\ncalled perfect or imperfect, good or bad, depends solely on the\nwill of God.  If God had so willed, he might have brought it\nabout that what is now perfection should be extreme imperfection,\nand vice versa.  What is such an assertion, but an open\ndeclaration that God, who necessarily understands that which he\nwishes, might bring it about by his will, that he should\nunderstand things differently from the way in which he does\nunderstand them?  This (as we have just shown) is the height of\nabsurdity.  Wherefore, I may turn the argument against its\nemployers, as follows:--All things depend on the power of God.\nIn order that things should be different from what they are,\nGod's will would necessarily have to be different.  But God's\nwill cannot be different (as we have just most clearly\ndemonstrated) from God's perfection.  Therefore neither can\nthings be different.  I confess, that the theory which subjects\nall things to the will of an indifferent deity, and asserts that\nthey are all dependent on his fiat, is less far from the truth\nthan the theory of those, who maintain that God acts in all\nthings with a view of promoting what is good.  For these latter\npersons seem to set up something beyond God, which does not\ndepend on God, but which God in acting looks to as an exemplar,\nor which he aims at as a definite goal.  This is only another\nname for subjecting God to the dominion of destiny, an utter\nabsurdity in respect to God, whom we have shown to be the first\nand only free cause of the essence of all things and also of\ntheir existence.  I need, therefore, spend no time in refuting\nsuch wild theories.\nPROP. XXXIV.  God's power is identical with his essence.\nProof.--From the sole necessity of the essence of God it\nfollows that God is the cause of himself (Prop. xi.) and of all\nthings (Prop. xvi. and Coroll.).  Wherefore the power of God, by\nwhich he and all things are and act, is identical with his\nessence.  Q.E.D.\nPROP. XXXV.  Whatsoever we conceive to be in the power of God,\nnecessarily exists.\nProof.--Whatsoever is in God's power, must (by the last Prop.)\nbe comprehended in his essence in such a manner, that it\nnecessarily follows therefrom, and therefore necessarily exists.\nQ.E.D.\nPROP. XXXVI.  There is no cause from whose nature some effect\ndoes not follow.\nProof.--Whatsoever exists expresses God's nature or essence in\na given conditioned manner (by Prop. xxv., Coroll.); that is,\n(by Prop. xxxiv.), whatsoever exists, expresses in a given\nconditioned manner God's power, which is the cause of all things,\ntherefore an effect must (by Prop. xvi.) necessarily follow.\nQ.E.D.\nAPPENDIX:\nIn the foregoing I have explained the nature and properties\nof God.  I have shown that he necessarily exists, that he is one:\nthat he is, and acts solely by the necessity of his own nature;\nthat he is the free cause of all things, and how he is so;\nthat all things are in God, and so depend on him, that without\nhim they could neither exist nor be conceived; lastly, that all\nthings are predetermined by God, not through his free will or\nabsolute fiat, but from the very nature of God or infinite power.\nI have further, where occasion afforded, taken care to remove the\nprejudices, which might impede the comprehension of my\ndemonstrations.  Yet there still remain misconceptions not a few,\nwhich might and may prove very grave hindrances to the\nunderstanding of the concatenation of things, as I have explained\nit above.  I have therefore thought it worth while to bring these\nmisconceptions before the bar of reason.\nAll such opinions spring from the notion commonly\nentertained, that all things in nature act as men themselves act,\nnamely, with an end in view.  It is accepted as certain, that God\nhimself directs all things to a definite goal (for it is said\nthat God made all things for man, and man that he might worship\nhim).  I will, therefore, consider this opinion, asking first,\nwhy it obtains general credence, and why all men are naturally so\nprone to adopt it? secondly, I will point out its falsity; and,\nlastly, I will show how it has given rise to prejudices about\ngood and bad, right and wrong, praise and blame, order and\nconfusion, beauty and ugliness, and the like.  However, this is\nnot the place to deduce these misconceptions from the nature of\nthe human mind: it will be sufficient here, if I assume as a\nstarting point, what ought to be universally admitted, namely,\nthat all men are born ignorant of the causes of things, that all\nhave the desire to seek for what is useful to them, and that they\nare conscious of such desire.  Herefrom it follows, first, that\nmen think themselves free inasmuch as they are conscious of their\nvolitions and desires, and never even dream, in their ignorance,\nof the causes which have disposed them so to wish and desire.\nSecondly, that men do all things for an end, namely, for that\nwhich is useful to them, and which they seek.  Thus it comes to\npass that they only look for a knowledge of the final causes of\nevents, and when these are learned, they are content, as having\nno cause for further doubt.  If they cannot learn such causes\nfrom external sources, they are compelled to turn to considering\nthemselves, and reflecting what end would have induced them\npersonally to bring about the given event, and thus they\nnecessarily judge other natures by their own.  Further, as they\nfind in themselves and outside themselves many means which assist\nthem not a little in the search for what is useful, for instance,\neyes for seeing, teeth for chewing, herbs and animals for\nyielding food, the sun for giving light, the sea for breeding\nfish, &c., they come to look on the whole of nature as a means\nfor obtaining such conveniences.  Now as they are aware, that\nthey found these conveniences and did not make them, they think\nthey have cause for believing, that some other being has made\nthem for their use.  As they look upon things as means, they\ncannot believe them to be self--created; but, judging from the\nmeans which they are accustomed to prepare for themselves, they\nare bound to believe in some ruler or rulers of the universe\nendowed with human freedom, who have arranged and adapted\neverything for human use.  They are bound to estimate the nature\nof such rulers (having no information on the subject) in\naccordance with their own nature, and therefore they assert that\nthe gods ordained everything for the use of man, in order to bind\nman to themselves and obtain from him the highest honor.  Hence\nalso it follows, that everyone thought out for himself, according\nto his abilities, a different way of worshipping God, so that God\nmight love him more than his fellows, and direct the whole course\nof nature for the satisfaction of his blind cupidity and\ninsatiable avarice.  Thus the prejudice developed into\nsuperstition, and took deep root in the human mind; and for this\nreason everyone strove most zealously to understand and explain\nthe final causes of things; but in their endeavor to show that\nnature does nothing in vain, i.e. nothing which is useless to\nman, they only seem to have demonstrated that nature, the gods,\nand men are all mad together.  Consider, I pray you, the result:\namong the many helps of nature they were bound to find some\nhindrances, such as storms, earthquakes, diseases, &c.: so they\ndeclared that such things happen, because the gods are angry at\nsome wrong done to them by men, or at some fault committed in\ntheir worship.  Experience day by day protested and showed by\ninfinite examples, that good and evil fortunes fall to the lot of\npious and impious alike; still they would not abandon their\ninveterate prejudice, for it was more easy for them to class such\ncontradictions among other unknown things of whose use they were\nignorant, and thus to retain their actual and innate condition of\nignorance, than to destroy the whole fabric of their reasoning\nand start afresh.  They therefore laid down as an axiom, that\nGod's judgments far transcend human understanding.  Such a\ndoctrine might well have sufficed to conceal the truth from the\nhuman race for all eternity, if mathematics had not furnished\nanother standard of verity in considering solely the essence and\nproperties of figures without regard to their final causes.\nThere are other reasons (which I need not mention here) besides\nmathematics, which might have caused men's minds to be directed\nto these general prejudices, and have led them to the knowledge\nof the truth.\nI have now sufficiently explained my first point.  There is\nno need to show at length, that nature has no particular goal in\nview, and that final causes are mere human figments.  This, I\nthink, is already evident enough, both from the causes and\nfoundations on which I have shown such prejudice to be based, and\nalso from Prop. xvi., and the Corollary of Prop. xxxii., and, in\nfact, all those propositions in which I have shown, that\neverything in nature proceeds from a sort of necessity, and with\nthe utmost perfection.  However, I will add a few remarks, in\norder to overthrow this doctrine of a final cause utterly.  That\nwhich is really a cause it considers as an effect, and vice versa:\nit makes that which is by nature first to be last, and that\nwhich is highest and most perfect to be most imperfect.  Passing\nover the questions of cause and priority as self--evident, it is\nplain from Props. xxi., xxii., xxiii. that the effect is most\nperfect which is produced immediately by God; the effect which\nrequires for its production several intermediate causes is, in\nthat respect, more imperfect.  But if those things which were\nmade immediately by God were made to enable him to attain his\nend, then the things which come after, for the sake of which the\nfirst were made, are necessarily the most excellent of all.\nFurther, this doctrine does away with the perfection of God:\nfor, if God acts for an object, he necessarily desires something\nwhich he lacks.  Certainly, theologians and metaphysicians draw a\ndistinction between the object of want and the object of\nassimilation; still they confess that God made all things for\nthe sake of himself, not for the sake of creation.  They are\nunable to point to anything prior to creation, except God\nhimself, as an object for which God should act, and are therefore\ndriven to admit (as they clearly must), that God lacked those\nthings for whose attainment he created means, and further that he\ndesired them.\nWe must not omit to notice that the followers of this\ndoctrine, anxious to display their talent in assigning final\ncauses, have imported a new method of argument in proof of their\ntheory--namely, a reduction, not to the impossible, but to\nignorance; thus showing that they have no other method of\nexhibiting their doctrine.  For example, if a stone falls from a\nroof on to someone's head, and kills him, they will demonstrate\nby their new method, that the stone fell in order to kill the man;\nfor, if it had not by God's will fallen with that object, how\ncould so many circumstances (and there are often many concurrent\ncircumstances) have all happened together by chance?  Perhaps you\nwill answer that the event is due to the facts that the wind was\nblowing, and the man was walking that way.  \"But why,\" they will\ninsist, \"was the wind blowing, and why was the man at that very\ntime walking that way?\"  If you again answer, that the wind had\nthen sprung up because the sea had begun to be agitated the day\nbefore, the weather being previously calm, and that the man had\nbeen invited by a friend, they will again insist: \"But why was\nthe sea agitated, and why was the man invited at that time?\"\nSo they will pursue their questions from cause to cause, till at\nlast you take refuge in the will of God--in other words, the\nsanctuary of ignorance.  So, again, when they survey the frame of\nthe human body, they are amazed; and being ignorant of the\ncauses of so great a work of art, conclude that it has been\nfashioned, not mechanically, but by divine and supernatural\nskill, and has been so put together that one part shall not hurt\nanother.\nHence anyone who seeks for the true causes of miracles, and\nstrives to understand natural phenomena as an intelligent being,\nand not to gaze at them like a fool, is set down and denounced as\nan impious heretic by those, whom the masses adore as the\ninterpreters of nature and the gods.  Such persons know that,\nwith the removal of ignorance, the wonder which forms their only\navailable means for proving and preserving their authority would\nvanish also.  But I now quit this subject, and pass on to my\nthird point.\nAfter men persuaded themselves, that everything which is\ncreated is created for their sake, they were bound to consider as\nthe chief quality in everything that which is most useful to\nthemselves, and to account those things the best of all which\nhave the most beneficial effect on mankind.  Further, they were\nbound to form abstract notions for the explanation of the nature\nof things, such as goodness, badness, order, confusion, warmth,\ncold, beauty, deformity, and so on; and from the belief that\nthey are free agents arose the further notions of praise and\nblame, sin and merit.\nI will speak of these latter hereafter, when I treat of human\nnature; the former I will briefly explain here.\nEverything which conduces to health and the worship of God\nthey have called good, everything which hinders these objects\nthey have styled bad; and inasmuch as those who do not\nunderstand the nature of things do not verify phenomena in any\nway, but merely imagine them after a fashion, and mistake their\nimagination for understanding, such persons firmly believe that\nthere is an order in things, being really ignorant both of things\nand their own nature.  When phenomena are of such a kind, that\nthe impression they make on our senses requires little effort of\nimagination, and can consequently be easily remembered, we say\nthat they are well--ordered; if the contrary, that they are\nill--ordered or confused.  Further, as things which are easily\nimagined are more pleasing to us, men prefer order to\nconfusion--as though there were any order in nature, except in\nrelation to our imagination--and say that God has created all\nthings in order; thus, without knowing it, attributing\nimagination to God, unless, indeed, they would have it that God\nforesaw human imagination, and arranged everything, so that it\nshould be most easily imagined.  If this be their theory, they\nwould not, perhaps, be daunted by the fact that we find an\ninfinite number of phenomena, far surpassing our imagination, and\nvery many others which confound its weakness.  But enough has\nbeen said on this subject.  The other abstract notions are\nnothing but modes of imagining, in which the imagination is\ndifferently affected: though they are considered by the ignorant\nas the chief attributes of things, inasmuch as they believe that\neverything was created for the sake of themselves; and,\naccording as they are affected by it, style it good or bad,\nhealthy or rotten and corrupt.  For instance, if the motion which\nobjects we see communicate to our nerves be conducive to health,\nthe objects causing it are styled beautiful; if a contrary\nmotion be excited, they are styled ugly.\nThings which are perceived through our sense of smell are\nstyled fragrant or fetid; if through our taste, sweet or bitter,\nfull--flavored or insipid; if through our touch, hard or soft,\nrough or smooth, &c.\nWhatsoever affects our ears is said to give rise to noise,\nsound, or harmony.  In this last case, there are men lunatic\nenough to believe, that even God himself takes pleasure in\nharmony; and philosophers are not lacking who have persuaded\nthemselves, that the motion of the heavenly bodies gives rise to\nharmony--all of which instances sufficiently show that everyone\njudges of things according to the state of his brain, or rather\nmistakes for things the forms of his imagination.  We need no\nlonger wonder that there have arisen all the controversies we\nhave witnessed, and finally skepticism: for, although human\nbodies in many respects agree, yet in very many others they\ndiffer; so that what seems good to one seems bad to another;\nwhat seems well ordered to one seems confused to another; what\nis pleasing to one displeases another, and so on.  I need not\nfurther enumerate, because this is not the place to treat the\nsubject at length, and also because the fact is sufficiently well\nknown.  It is commonly said: \"So many men, so many minds;\neveryone is wise in his own way; brains differ as completely as\npalates.\"  All of which proverbs show, that men judge of things\naccording to their mental disposition, and rather imagine than\nunderstand: for, if they understood phenomena, they would, as\nmathematicians attest, be convinced, if not attracted, by what I\nhave urged.\nWe have now perceived, that all the explanations commonly\ngiven of nature are mere modes of imagining, and do not indicate\nthe true nature of anything, but only the constitution of the\nimagination; and, although they have names, as though they were\nentities, existing externally to the imagination, I call them\nentities imaginary rather than real; and, therefore, all\narguments against us drawn from such abstractions are easily\nrebutted.\nMany argue in this way.  If all things follow from a\nnecessity of the absolutely perfect nature of God, why are there\nso many imperfections in nature? such, for instance, as things\ncorrupt to the point of putridity, loathsome deformity,\nconfusion, evil, sin, &c.  But these reasoners are, as I have\nsaid, easily confuted, for the perfection of things is to be\nreckoned only from their own nature and power; things are not\nmore or less perfect, according as they delight or offend human\nsenses, or according as they are serviceable or repugnant to\nmankind.  To those who ask why God did not so create all men,\nthat they should be governed only by reason, I give no answer but\nthis: because matter was not lacking to him for the creation of\nevery degree of perfection from highest to lowest; or, more\nstrictly, because the laws of his nature are so vast, as to\nsuffice for the production of everything conceivable by an\ninfinite intelligence, as I have shown in Prop. xvi.\nSuch are the misconceptions I have undertaken to note; if\nthere are any more of the same sort, everyone may easily\ndissipate them for himself with the aid of a little reflection.\nPart II.\nON THE NATURE AND ORIGIN OF THE MIND\nPREFACE\nI now pass on to explaining the results, which must\nnecessarily follow from the essence of God, or of the eternal and\ninfinite being; not, indeed, all of them (for we proved in Part\ni., Prop. xvi., that an infinite number must follow in an\ninfinite number of ways), but only those which are able to lead\nus, as it were by the hand, to the knowledge of the human mind\nand its highest blessedness.\nDEFINITIONS\nDEFINITION I.  By body I mean a mode which expresses in a certain\ndeterminate manner the essence of God, in so far as he is\nconsidered as an extended thing.  (See Pt. i., Prop. xxv.,\nCoroll.)\nDEFINITION II.  I consider as belonging to the essence of a thing\nthat, which being given, the thing is necessarily given also,\nand, which being removed, the thing is necessarily removed also;\nin other words, that without which the thing, and which itself\nwithout the thing, can neither be nor be conceived.\nDEFINITION III. By idea, I mean the mental conception which is\nformed by the mind as a thinking thing.\nExplanation.--I say conception rather than perception, because\nthe word perception seems to imply that the mind is passive in\nrespect to the object; whereas conception seems to express an\nactivity of the mind.\nDEFINITION IV.  By an adequate idea, I mean an idea which, in so\nfar as it is considered in itself, without relation to the\nobject, has all the properties or intrinsic marks of a true idea.\nExplanation.--I say intrinsic, in order to exclude that mark\nwhich is extrinsic, namely, the agreement between the idea and\nits object (ideatum).\nDEFINITION V.  Duration is the indefinite continuance of\nexisting.\nExplanation.--I say indefinite, because it cannot be\ndetermined through the existence itself of the existing thing, or\nby its efficient cause, which necessarily gives the existence of\nthe thing, but does not take it away.\nDEFINITION VI.  Reality and perfection I use as synonymous terms.\nDEFINITION VII.  By particular things, I mean things which are\nfinite and have a conditioned existence; but if several\nindividual things concur in one action, so as to be all\nsimultaneously the effect of one cause, I consider them all, so\nfar, as one particular thing.\nAXIOMS\nI.  The essence of man does not involve necessary existence, that\nis, it may, in the order of nature, come to pass that this or\nthat man does or does not exist.\nII.  Man thinks.\nIII.  Modes of thinking, such as love, desire, or any other of\nthe passions, do not take place, unless there be in the same\nindividual an idea of the thing loved, desired, &c.  But the idea\ncan exist without the presence of any other mode of thinking.\nIV.  We perceive that a certain body is affected in many ways.\nV.  We feel and perceive no particular things, save bodies and\nmodes of thought.\nN.B.  The Postulates are given after the conclusion of Prop.\nxiii.\nPROPOSITIONS\nPROP. I.  Thought is an attribute of God, or God is a thinking\nthing.\nProof.--Particular thoughts, or this and that thought, are\nmodes which, in a certain conditioned manner, express the nature\nof God (Pt. i., Prop. xxv., Coroll.).  God therefore possesses\nthe attribute (Pt. i., Def. v.) of which the concept is involved\nin all particular thoughts, which latter are conceived thereby.\nThought, therefore, is one of the infinite attributes of God,\nwhich express God's eternal and infinite essence (Pt. i., Def.\nvi.).  In other words, God is a thinking thing.  Q.E.D.\nNote.--This proposition is also evident from the fact, that we\nare able to conceive an infinite thinking being.  For, in\nproportion as a thinking being is conceived as thinking more\nthoughts, so is it conceived as containing more reality or\nperfection.  Therefore a being, which can think an infinite\nnumber of things in an infinite number of ways, is, necessarily,\nin respect of thinking, infinite.  As, therefore, from the\nconsideration of thought alone, we conceive an infinite being,\nthought is necessarily (Pt. i., Deff. iv. and vi.) one of the\ninfinite attributes of God, as we were desirous of showing.\nPROP. II.  Extension is an attribute of God, or God is an\nextended thing.\nProof.--The proof of this proposition is similar to that of\nthe last.\nPROP. III.  In God there is necessarily the idea not only of his\nessence, but also of all things which necessarily follow from his\nessence.\nProof.--God (by the first Prop. of this Part) can think an\ninfinite number of things in infinite ways, or (what is the same\nthing, by Prop. xvi., Part i.) can form the idea of his essence,\nand of all things which necessarily follow therefrom.  Now all\nthat is in the power of God necessarily is (Pt. i., Prop. xxxv.).\nTherefore, such an idea as we are considering necessarily is, and\nin God alone.  Q.E.D.  (Part i., Prop. xv.)\nNote.--The multitude understand by the power of God the free\nwill of God, and the right over all things that exist, which\nlatter are accordingly generally considered as contingent.  For\nit is said that God has the power to destroy all things, and to\nreduce them to nothing.  Further, the power of God is very often\nlikened to the power of kings.  But this doctrine we have refuted\n(Pt. i., Prop. xxxii., Corolls. i. and ii.), and we have shown\n(Part i., Prop. xvi.) that God acts by the same necessity, as\nthat by which he understands himself; in other words, as it\nfollows from the necessity of the divine nature (as all admit),\nthat God understands himself, so also does it follow by the same\nnecessity, that God performs infinite acts in infinite ways.  We\nfurther showed (Part i., Prop. xxxiv.), that God's power is\nidentical with God's essence in action; therefore it is as\nimpossible for us to conceive God as not acting, as to conceive\nhim as non--existent.  If we might pursue the subject further, I\ncould point out, that the power which is commonly attributed to\nGod is not only human (as showing that God is conceived by the\nmultitude as a man, or in the likeness of a man), but involves a\nnegation of power.  However, I am unwilling to go over the same\nground so often.  I would only beg the reader again and again, to\nturn over frequently in his mind what I have said in Part I from\nProp. xvi. to the end.  No one will be able to follow my meaning,\nunless he is scrupulously careful not to confound the power of\nGod with the human power and right of kings.\nPROP. IV.  The idea of God, from which an infinite number of\nthings follow in infinite ways, can only be one.\nProof.--Infinite intellect comprehends nothing save the\nattributes of God and his modifications (Part i., Prop. xxx.).\nNow God is one (Part i., Prop. xiv., Coroll.).  Therefore the\nidea of God, wherefrom an infinite number of things follow in\ninfinite ways, can only be one.  Q.E.D.\nPROP. V.  The actual being of ideas owns God as its cause, only\nin so far as he is considered as a thinking thing, not in so far\nas he is unfolded in any other attribute; that is, the ideas\nboth of the attributes of God and of particular things do not own\nas their efficient cause their objects (ideata) or the things\nperceived, but God himself in so far as he is a thinking thing.\nProof.--This proposition is evident from Prop. iii. of this\nPart.  We there drew the conclusion, that God can form the idea\nof his essence, and of all things which follow necessarily\ntherefrom, solely because he is a thinking thing, and not because\nhe is the object of his own idea.  Wherefore the actual being of\nideas owns for cause God, in so far as he is a thinking thing.\nIt may be differently proved as follows: the actual being of\nideas is (obviously) a mode of thought, that is (Part i., Prop.\nxxv., Coroll.) a mode which expresses in a certain manner the\nnature of God, in so far as he is a thinking thing, and therefore\n(Part i., Prop. x.) involves the conception of no other attribute\nof God, and consequently (by Part i., Ax. iv.) is not the effect\nof any attribute save thought.  Therefore the actual being of\nideas owns God as its cause, in so far as he is considered as a\nthinking thing, &c.  Q.E.D.\nPROP. VI.  The modes of any given attribute are caused by God, in\nso far as he is considered through the attribute of which they\nare modes, and not in so far as he is considered through any\nother attribute.\nProof.--Each attribute is conceived through itself, without\nany other (Part i., Prop. x.); wherefore the modes of each\nattribute involve the conception of that attribute, but not of\nany other.  Thus (Part i., Ax. iv.) they are caused by God, only\nin so far as he is considered through the attribute whose modes\nthey are, and not in so far as he is considered through any\nother.  Q.E.D.\nCorollary.--Hence the actual being of things, which are not\nmodes of thought, does not follow from the divine nature, because\nthat nature has prior knowledge of the things.  Things\nrepresented in ideas follow, and are derived from their\nparticular attribute, in the same manner, and with the same\nnecessity as ideas follow (according to what we have shown) from\nthe attribute of thought.\nPROP. VII.  The order and connection of ideas is the same as the\norder and connection of things.\nProof.--This proposition is evident from Part i., Ax. iv.  For\nthe idea of everything that is caused depends on a knowledge of\nthe cause, whereof it is an effect.\nCorollary.--Hence God's power of thinking is equal to his\nrealized power of action--that is, whatsoever follows from the\ninfinite nature of God in the world of extension (formaliter),\nfollows without exception in the same order and connection from\nthe idea of God in the world of thought (objective).\nNote.--Before going any further, I wish to recall to mind what\nhas been pointed out above--namely, that whatsoever can be\nperceived by the infinite intellect as constituting the essence\nof substance, belongs altogether only to one substance:\nconsequently, substance thinking and substance extended are one\nand the same substance, comprehended now through one attribute,\nnow through the other.  So, also, a mode of extension and the\nidea of that mode are one and the same thing, though expressed in\ntwo ways.  This truth seems to have been dimly recognized by\nthose Jews who maintained that God, God's intellect, and the\nthings understood by God are identical.  For instance, a circle\nexisting in nature, and the idea of a circle existing, which is\nalso in God, are one and the same thing displayed through\ndifferent attributes.  Thus, whether we conceive nature under the\nattribute of extension, or under the attribute of thought, or\nunder any other attribute, we shall find the same order, or one\nand the same chain of causes--that is, the same things following\nin either case.\nI said that God is the cause of an idea--for instance, of the\nidea of a circle,--in so far as he is a thinking thing; and of a\ncircle, in so far as he is an extended thing, simply because the\nactual being of the idea of a circle can only be perceived as a\nproximate cause through another mode of thinking, and that again\nthrough another, and so on to infinity; so that, so long as we\nconsider things as modes of thinking, we must explain the order\nof the whole of nature, or the whole chain of causes, through the\nattribute of thought only.  And, in so far as we consider things\nas modes of extension, we must explain the order of the whole of\nnature through the attributes of extension only; and so on, in\nthe case of the other attributes.  Wherefore of things as they\nare in themselves God is really the cause, inasmuch as he\nconsists of infinite attributes.  I cannot for the present\nexplain my meaning more clearly.\nPROP. VIII.  The ideas of particular things, or of modes, that do\nnot exist, must be comprehended in the infinite idea of God, in\nthe same way as the formal essences of particular things or modes\nare contained in the attributes of God.\nProof.--This proposition is evident from the last; it is\nunderstood more clearly from the preceding note.\nCorollary.--Hence, so long as particular things do not exist,\nexcept in so far as they are comprehended in the attributes of\nGod, their representations in thought or ideas do not exist,\nexcept in so far as the infinite idea of God exists; and when\nparticular things are said to exist, not only in so far as they\nare involved in the attributes of God, but also in so far as they\nare said to continue, their ideas will also involve existence,\nthrough which they are said to continue.\nNote.--If anyone desires an example to throw more light on\nthis question, I shall, I fear, not be able to give him any,\nwhich adequately explains the thing of which I here speak,\ninasmuch as it is unique; however, I will endeavour to\nillustrate it as far as possible.  The nature of a circle is such\nthat if any number of straight lines intersect within it, the\nrectangles formed by their segments will be equal to one another;\nthus, infinite equal rectangles are contained in a circle.  Yet\nnone of these rectangles can be said to exist, except in so far\nas the circle exists; nor can the idea of any of these\nrectangles be said to exist, except in so far as they are\ncomprehended in the idea of the circle.  Let us grant that, from\nthis infinite number of rectangles, two only exist.  The ideas of\nthese two not only exist, in so far as they are contained in the\nidea of the circle, but also as they involve the existence of\nthose rectangles; wherefore they are distinguished from the\nremaining ideas of the remaining rectangles.\nPROP. IX.  The idea of an individual thing actually existing is\ncaused by God, not in so far as he is infinite, but in so far as\nhe is considered as affected by another idea of a thing actually\nexisting, of which he is the cause, in so far as he is affected\nby a third idea, and so on to infinity.\nProof.--The idea of an individual thing actually existing is\nan individual mode of thinking, and is distinct from other modes\n(by the Corollary and note to Prop. viii. of this part); thus\n(by Prop. vi. of this part) it is caused by God, in so far only\nas he is a thinking thing.  But not (by Prop. xxviii. of Part i.)\nin so far as he is a thing thinking absolutely, only in so far as\nhe is considered as affected by another mode of thinking; and he\nis the cause of this latter, as being affected by a third, and so\non to infinity.  Now, the order and connection of ideas is (by\nProp. vii. of this book) the same as the order and connection of\ncauses.   Therefore of a given individual idea another individual\nidea, or God, in so far as he is considered as modified by that\nidea, is the cause; and of this second idea God is the cause, in\nso far as he is affected by another idea, and so on to infinity.\nQ.E.D.\nCorollary.--Whatsoever takes place in the individual object of\nany idea, the knowledge thereof is in God, in so far only as he\nhas the idea of the object.\nProof.--Whatsoever takes place in the object of any idea, its\nidea is in God (by Prop. iii. of this part), not in so far as he\nis infinite, but in so far as he is considered as affected by\nanother idea of an individual thing (by the last Prop.); but (by\nProp. vii. of this part) the order and connection of ideas is the\nsame as the order and connection of things.  The knowledge,\ntherefore, of that which takes place in any individual object\nwill be in God, in so far only as he has the idea of that object.\nQ.E.D.\nPROP. X.  The being of substance does not appertain to the\nessence of man--in other words, substance does not constitute the\nactual being[2] of man.\n[2] \"Forma\"\nProof.--The being of substance involves necessary existence\n(Part i., Prop. vii.).  If, therefore, the being of substance\nappertains to the essence of man, substance being granted, man\nwould necessarily be granted also (II. Def. ii.), and,\nconsequently, man would necessarily exist, which is absurd\n(II. Ax. i.).  Therefore, &c.  Q.E.D.\nNote.--This proposition may also be proved from I.v., in which\nit is shown that there cannot be two substances of the same\nnature; for as there may be many men, the being of substance is\nnot that which constitutes the actual being of man.  Again, the\nproposition is evident from the other properties of\nsubstance--namely, that substance is in its nature infinite,\nimmutable, indivisible, &c., as anyone may see for himself.\nCorollary.--Hence it follows, that the essence of man is\nconstituted by certain modifications of the attributes of God.\nFor (by the last Prop.) the being of substance does not belong to\nthe essence of man.  That essence therefore (by i.  15) is\nsomething which is in God, and which without God can neither be\nnor be conceived, whether it be a modification (i. 25. Coroll.),\nor a mode which expresses God's nature in a certain conditioned\nmanner.\nNote.--Everyone must surely admit, that nothing can be or be\nconceived without God.  All men agree that God is the one and\nonly cause of all things, both of their essence and of their\nexistence; that is, God is not only the cause of things in\nrespect to their being made (secundum fieri), but also in respect\nto their being (secundum esse).\nAt the same time many assert, that that, without which a\nthing cannot be nor be conceived, belongs to the essence of that\nthing; wherefore they believe that either the nature of God\nappertains to the essence of created things, or else that created\nthings can be or be conceived without God; or else, as is more\nprobably the case, they hold inconsistent doctrines.  I think the\ncause for such confusion is mainly, that they do not keep to the\nproper order of philosophic thinking.  The nature of God, which\nshould be reflected on first, inasmuch as it is prior both in the\norder of knowledge and the order of nature, they have taken to be\nlast in the order of knowledge, and have put into the first place\nwhat they call the objects of sensation; hence, while they are\nconsidering natural phenomena, they give no attention at all to\nthe divine nature, and, when afterwards they apply their mind to\nthe study of the divine nature, they are quite unable to bear in\nmind the first hypotheses, with which they have overlaid the\nknowledge of natural phenomena, inasmuch as such hypotheses are\nno help towards understanding the divine nature.  So that it is\nhardly to be wondered at, that these persons contradict\nthemselves freely.\nHowever, I pass over this point.  My intention her was only\nto give a reason for not saying, that that, without which a thing\ncannot be or be conceived, belongs to the essence of that thing:\nindividual things cannot be or be conceived without God, yet God\ndoes not appertain to their essence.  I said that \"I considered\nas belonging to the essence of a thing that, which being given,\nthe thing is necessarily given also, and which being removed, the\nthing is necessarily removed also; or that without which the\nthing, and which itself without the thing can neither be nor be\nconceived.\"  (II. Def. ii.)\nPROP. XI.  The first element, which constitutes the actual being\nof the human mind, is the idea of some particular thing actually\nexisting.\nProof.--The essence of man (by the Coroll. of the last Prop.)\nis constituted by certain modes of the attributes of God, namely\n(by II. Ax. ii.), by the modes of thinking, of all which (by II.\nAx. iii.) the idea is prior in nature, and, when the idea is\ngiven, the other modes (namely, those of which the idea is prior\nin nature) must be in the same individual (by the same Axiom).\nTherefore an idea is the first element constituting the human\nmind.  But not the idea of a non--existent thing, for then (II.\nviii. Coroll.) the idea itself cannot be said to exist; it must\ntherefore be the idea of something actually existing.  But not of\nan infinite thing.  For an infinite thing (I. xxi., xxii.), must\nalways necessarily exist; this would (by II. Ax. i.) involve an\nabsurdity.  Therefore the first element, which constitutes the\nactual being of the human mind, is the idea of something actually\nexisting.  Q.E.D.\nCorollary.--Hence it follows, that the human mind is part of\nthe infinite intellect of God; thus when we say, that the human\nmind perceives this or that, we make the assertion, that God has\nthis or that idea, not in so far as he is infinite, but in so far\nas he is displayed through the nature of the human mind, or in so\nfar as he constitutes the essence of the human mind; and when we\nsay that God has this or that idea, not only in so far as he\nconstitutes the essence of the human mind, but also in so far as\nhe, simultaneously with the human mind, has the further idea of\nanother thing, we assert that the human mind perceives a thing in\npart or inadequately.\nNote.--Here, I doubt not, readers will come to a stand, and\nwill call to mind many things which will cause them to hesitate;\nI therefore beg them to accompany me slowly, step by step, and\nnot to pronounce on my statements, till they have read to the\nend.\nPROP. XII.  Whatsoever comes to pass in the object of the idea,\nwhich constitutes the human mind, must be perceived by the human\nmind, or there will necessarily be an idea in the human mind of\nthe said occurrence.  That is, if the object of the idea\nconstituting the human mind be a body, nothing can take place in\nthat body without being perceived by the mind.\nProof.--Whatsoever comes to pass in the object of any idea,\nthe knowledge thereof is necessarily in God (II. ix. Coroll.), in\nso far as he is considered as affected by the idea of the said\nobject, that is (II. xi.), in so far as he constitutes the mind\nof anything.  Therefore, whatsoever takes place in the object\nconstituting the idea of the human mind, the knowledge thereof is\nnecessarily in God, in so far as he constitutes the essence of\nthe human mind; that is (by II. xi. Coroll.) the knowledge of\nthe said thing will necessarily be in the mind, in other words\nthe mind perceives it.\nNote.--This proposition is also evident, and is more clearly\nto be understood from II. vii., which see.\nPROP. XIII.  The object of the idea constituting the human mind\nis the body, in other words a certain mode of extension which\nactually exists, and nothing else.\nProof.--If indeed the body were not the object of the human\nmind, the ideas of the modifications of the body would not be in\nGod (II. ix. Coroll.) in virtue of his constituting our mind, but\nin virtue of his constituting the mind of something else; that\nis (II. xi. Coroll.) the ideas of the modifications of the body\nwould not be in our mind: now (by II. Ax. iv.) we do possess the\nidea of the modifications of the body.  Therefore the object of\nthe idea constituting the human mind is the body, and the body as\nit actually exists (II. xi.).  Further, if there were any other\nobject of the idea constituting the mind besides body, then, as\nnothing can exist from which some effect does not follow (I.\nxxxvi.) there would necessarily have to be in our mind an idea,\nwhich would be the effect of that other object (II. xi.); but\n(I. Ax. v.) there is no such idea.  Wherefore the object of our\nmind is the body as it exists, and nothing else.  Q.E.D.\nNote.--We thus comprehend, not only that the human mind is\nunited to the body, but also the nature of the union between mind\nand body.  However, no one will be able to grasp this adequately\nor distinctly, unless he first has adequate knowledge of the\nnature of our body.  The propositions we have advanced hitherto\nhave been entirely general, applying not more to men than to\nother individual things, all of which, though in different\ndegrees, are animated.[3]  For of everything there is necessarily\nan idea in God, of which God is the cause, in the same way as\nthere is an idea of the human body; thus  whatever we have\nasserted of the idea of the human body must necessarily also be\nasserted of the idea of everything else.  Still, on the other\nhand, we cannot deny that ideas, like objects, differ one from\nthe other, one being more excellent than another and containing\nmore reality, just as the object of one idea is more excellent\nthan the object of another idea, and contains more reality.\n[3] \"Animata\"\nWherefore, in order to determine, wherein the human mind\ndiffers from other things, and wherein it surpasses them, it is\nnecessary for us to know the nature of its object, that is, of\nthe human body.  What this nature is, I am not able here to\nexplain, nor is it necessary for the proof of what I advance,\nthat I should do so.  I will only say generally, that in\nproportion as any given body is more fitted than others for doing\nmany actions or receiving many impressions at once, so also is\nthe mind, of which it is the object, more fitted than others for\nforming many simultaneous perceptions; and the more the actions\nof the body depend on itself alone, and the fewer other bodies\nconcur with it in action, the more fitted is the mind of which it\nis the object for distinct comprehension.  We may thus recognize\nthe superiority of one mind over others, and may further see the\ncause, why we have only a very confused knowledge of our body,\nand also many kindred questions, which I will, in the following\npropositions, deduce from what has been advanced.  Wherefore I\nhave thought it worth while to explain and prove more strictly my\npresent statements.  In order to do so, I must premise a few\npropositions concerning the nature of bodies.\nAXIOM I.  All bodies are either in motion or at rest.\nAXIOM II.  Every body is moved sometimes more slowly,\nsometimes more quickly.\nLEMMA I.  Bodies are distinguished from one another in\nrespect of motion and rest, quickness and slowness, and not in\nrespect of substance.\nProof.--The first part of this proposition is, I take it,\nself--evident.  That bodies are not distinguished in respect of\nsubstance, is plain both from I. v. and I. viii.  It is brought\nout still more clearly from I. xv, note.\nLEMMA II.  All bodies agree in certain respects.\nProof.--All bodies agree in the fact, that they involve the\nconception of one and the same attribute (II., Def. i.).\nFurther, in the fact that they may be moved less or more quickly,\nand may be absolutely in motion or at rest.\nLEMMA III.  A body in motion or at rest must be determined to\nmotion or rest by another body, which other body has been\ndetermined to motion or rest by a third body, and that third\nagain by a fourth, and so on to infinity.\nProof.--Bodies are individual things (II., Def. i.), which\n(Lemma I.) are distinguished one from the other in respect to\nmotion and rest; thus (I. xxviii.) each must necessarily be\ndetermined to motion or rest by another individual thing, namely\n(II. vi.), by another body, which other body is also (Ax. i.) in\nmotion or at rest.  And this body again can only have been set in\nmotion or caused to rest by being determined by a third body to\nmotion or rest.   This third body again by a fourth, and so on to\ninfinity.  Q.E.D.\nCorollary.--Hence it follows, that a body in motion keeps in\nmotion, until it is determined to a state of rest by some other\nbody; and a body at rest remains so, until it is determined to a\nstate of motion by some other body.  This is indeed self--evident.\nFor when I suppose, for instance, that a given body, A, is at\nrest, and do not take into consideration other bodies in motion,\nI cannot affirm anything concerning the body A, except that it is\nat rest.  If it afterwards comes to pass that A is in motion,\nthis cannot have resulted from its having been at rest, for no\nother consequence could have been involved than its remaining at\nrest.  If, on the other hand, A be given in motion, we shall, so\nlong as we only consider A, be unable to affirm anything\nconcerning it, except that it is in motion.   If A is\nsubsequently found to be at rest, this rest cannot be the result\nof A's previous motion, for such motion can only have led to\ncontinued motion; the state of rest therefore must have resulted\nfrom something, which was not in A, namely, from an external\ncause determining A to a state of rest.\nAxiom I.--All modes, wherein one body is affected by another\nbody, follow simultaneously from the nature of the body affected\nand the body affecting; so that one and the same body may be\nmoved in different modes, according to the difference in the\nnature of the bodies moving it; on the other hand, different\nbodies may be moved in different modes by one and the same body.\nAxiom II.--When a body in motion impinges on another body at\nrest, which it is unable to move, it recoils, in order to\ncontinue its motion, and the angle made by the line of motion in\nthe recoil and the plane of the body at rest, whereon the moving\nbody has impinged, will be equal to the angle formed by the line\nof motion of incidence and the same plane.\nSo far we have been speaking only of the most simple bodies,\nwhich are only distinguished one from the other by motion and\nrest, quickness and slowness.  We now pass on to compound bodies.\nDefinition.--When any given bodies of the same or different\nmagnitude are compelled by other bodies to remain in contact, or\nif they be moved at the same or different rates of speed, so that\ntheir mutual movements should preserve among themselves a certain\nfixed relation, we say that such bodies are in union, and that\ntogether they compose one body or individual, which is\ndistinguished from other bodies by the fact of this union.\nAxiom III.--In proportion as the parts of an individual, or a\ncompound body, are in contact over a greater or less superficies,\nthey will with greater or less difficulty admit of being moved\nfrom their position; consequently the individual will, with\ngreater or less difficulty, be brought to assume another form.\nThose bodies, whose parts are in contact over large superficies,\nare called hard; those, whose parts are in contact over small\nsuperficies, are called soft; those, whose parts are in motion\namong one another, are called fluid.\nLEMMA IV.  If from a body or individual, compounded of\nseveral bodies, certain bodies be separated, and if, at the same\ntime, an equal number of other bodies of the same nature take\ntheir place, the individual will preserve its nature as before,\nwithout any change in its actuality (forma).\nProof.--Bodies (Lemma i.) are not distinguished in respect of\nsubstance: that which constitutes the actuality (formam) of an\nindividual consists (by the last Def.) in a union of bodies; but\nthis union, although there is a continual change of bodies, will\n(by our hypothesis) be maintained; the individual, therefore,\nwill retain its nature as before, both in respect of substance\nand in respect of mode.  Q.E.D.\nLEMMA V.  If the parts composing an individual become greater\nor less, but in such proportion, that they all preserve the same\nmutual relations of motion and rest, the individual will still\npreserve its original nature, and its actuality will not be\nchanged.\nProof.--The same as for the last Lemma.\nLEMMA VI.  If certain bodies composing an individual be\ncompelled to change the motion, which they have in one direction,\nfor motion in another direction, but in such a manner, that they\nbe able to continue their motions and their mutual communication\nin the same relations as before, the individual will retain its\nown nature without any change of its actuality.\nProof.--This proposition is self--evident, for the individual\nis supposed to retain all that, which, in its definition, we\nspoke of as its actual being.\nLEMMA VII.  Furthermore, the individual thus composed\npreserves its nature, whether it be, as a whole, in motion or at\nrest, whether it be moved in this or that direction; so long as\neach part retains its motion, and preserves its communication\nwith other parts as before.\nProof.--This proposition is evident from the definition of an\nindividual prefixed to Lemma iv.\nNote.--We thus see, how a composite individual may be affected\nin many different ways, and preserve its nature notwithstanding.\nThus far we have conceived an individual as composed of bodies\nonly distinguished one from the other in respect of motion and\nrest, speed and slowness; that is, of bodies of the most simple\ncharacter.  If, however, we now conceive another individual\ncomposed of several individuals of diverse natures, we shall find\nthat the number of ways in which it can be affected, without\nlosing its nature, will be greatly multiplied.  Each of its parts\nwould consist of several bodies, and therefore (by Lemma vi.)\neach part would admit, without change to its nature, of quicker\nor slower motion, and would consequently be able to transmit its\nmotions more quickly or more slowly to the remaining parts.  If\nwe further conceive a third kind of individuals composed of\nindividuals of this second kind, we shall find that they may be\naffected in a still greater number of ways without changing their\nactuality.  We may easily proceed thus to infinity, and conceive\nthe whole of nature as one individual, whose parts, that is, all\nbodies, vary in infinite ways, without any change in the\nindividual as a whole.  I should feel bound to explain and\ndemonstrate this point at more length, if I were writing a\nspecial treatise on body.  But I have already said that such is\nnot my object; I have only touched on the question, because it\nenables me to prove easily that which I have in view.\nPOSTULATES\nI.  The human body is composed of a number of individual\nparts, of diverse nature, each one of which is in itself\nextremely complex.\nII.  Of the individual parts composing the human body some\nare fluid, some soft, some hard.\nIII.  The individual parts composing the human body, and\nconsequently the human body itself, are affected in a variety of\nways by external bodies.\nIV.  The human body stands in need for its preservation of a\nnumber of other bodies, by which it is continually, so to speak,\nregenerated.\nV.  When the fluid part of the human body is determined by an\nexternal body to impinge often on another soft part, it changes\nthe surface of the latter, and, as it were, leaves the impression\nthereupon of the external body which impels it.\nVI.  The human body can move external bodies, and arrange\nthem in a variety of ways.\nPROP. XIV.  The human mind is capable of perceiving a great\nnumber of things, and is so in proportion as its body is capable\nof receiving a great number of impressions.\nProof.--The human body (by Post. iii. and vi.) is affected in\nvery many ways by external bodies, and is capable in very many\nways of affecting external bodies.  But (II. xii.)  the human\nmind must perceive all that takes place in the human body; the\nhuman mind is, therefore, capable of perceiving a great number of\nthings, and is so in proportion, &c.  Q.E.D.\nPROP. XV.  The idea, which constitutes the actual being of the\nhuman mind, is not simple, but compounded of a great number of\nideas.\nProof.--The idea constituting the actual being of the human\nmind is the idea of the body (II. xiii.), which (Post. i.) is\ncomposed of a great number of complex individual parts.  But\nthere is necessarily in God the idea of each individual part\nwhereof the body is composed (II. viii. Coroll.); therefore\n(II. vii.), the idea of the human body is composed of these\nnumerous ideas of its component parts.  Q.E.D.\nPROP. XVI.  The idea of every mode, in which the human body is\naffected by external bodies, must involve the nature of the human\nbody, and also the nature of the external body.\nProof.--All the modes, in which any given body is affected,\nfollow from the nature of the body affected, and also from the\nnature of the affecting body (by Ax. i., after the Coroll. of\nLemma iii.), wherefore their idea also necessarily (by I. Ax.\niv.) involves the nature of both bodies; therefore, the idea of\nevery mode, in which the human body is affected by external\nbodies, involves the nature of the human body and of the external\nbody.  Q.E.D.\nCorollary I.--Hence it follows, first, that the human mind\nperceives the nature of a variety of bodies, together with the\nnature of its own.\nCorollary II.--It follows, secondly, that the ideas, which we\nhave of external bodies, indicate rather the constitution of our\nown body than the nature of external bodies.  I have amply\nillustrated this in the Appendix to Part I.\nPROP. XVII.  If the human body is affected in a manner which\ninvolves the nature of any external body, the human mind will\nregard the said external body as actually existing, or as present\nto itself, until the human body be affected in such a way, as to\nexclude the existence or the presence of the said external body.\nProof.--This proposition is self--evident, for so long as the\nhuman body continues to be thus affected, so long will the human\nmind (II. xii.) regard this modification of the body--that is (by\nthe last Prop.), it will have the idea of the mode as actually\nexisting, and this idea involves the nature of the external body.\nIn other words, it will have the idea which does not exclude, but\npostulates the existence or presence of the nature of the\nexternal body; therefore the mind (by II. xvi., Coroll. i.) will\nregard the external body as actually existing, until it is\naffected, &c.  Q.E.D.\nCorollary.--The mind is able to regard as present external\nbodies, by which the human body has once been affected, even\nthough they be no longer in existence or present.\nProof.--When external bodies determine the fluid parts of the\nhuman body, so that they often impinge on the softer parts, they\nchange the surface of the last named (Post. v.); hence (Ax. ii.,\nafter the Coroll. of Lemma iii.) they are refracted therefrom in\na different manner from that which they followed before such\nchange; and, further, when afterwards they impinge on the new\nsurfaces by their own spontaneous movement, they will be\nrefracted in the same manner, as though they had been impelled\ntowards those surfaces by external bodies; consequently, they\nwill, while they continue to be thus refracted, affect the human\nbody in the same manner, whereof the mind (II. xii.) will again\ntake cognizance--that is (II. xvii.), the mind will again regard\nthe external body as present, and will do so, as often as the\nfluid parts of the human body impinge on the aforesaid surfaces\nby their own spontaneous motion.  Wherefore, although the\nexternal bodies, by which the human body has once been affected,\nbe no longer in existence, the mind will nevertheless regard them\nas present, as often as this action of the body is repeated.\nQ.E.D.\nNote.--We thus see how it comes about, as is often the case,\nthat we regard as present many things which are not.  It is\npossible that the same result may be brought about by other\ncauses; but I think it suffices for me here to have indicated\none possible explanation, just as well as if I had pointed out\nthe true cause.  Indeed, I do not think I am very far from the\ntruth, for all my assumptions are based on postulates, which\nrest, almost without exception, on experience, that cannot be\ncontroverted by those who have shown, as we have, that the human\nbody, as we feel it, exists (Coroll. after II. xiii.).\nFurthermore (II. vii.  Coroll., II. xvi. Coroll. ii.), we clearly\nunderstand what is the difference between the idea, say, of\nPeter, which constitutes the essence of Peter's mind, and the\nidea of the said Peter, which is in another man, say, Paul.  The\nformer directly answers to the essence of Peter's own body, and\nonly  implies existence so long as Peter exists; the latter\nindicates rather the disposition of Paul's body than the nature\nof Peter, and, therefore, while this disposition of Paul's body\nlasts, Paul's mind will regard Peter as present to itself, even\nthough he no longer exists.  Further, to retain the usual\nphraseology,  the modifications of the human body, of which the\nideas represent external bodies as present to us, we will call\nthe images of things, though they do not recall the figure of\nthings.  When the mind regards bodies in this fashion, we say\nthat it imagines.  I will here draw attention to the fact, in\norder to indicate where error lies, that the imaginations of the\nmind, looked at in themselves, do not contain error.  The mind\ndoes not err in the mere act of imagining, but only in so far as\nit is regarded as being without the idea, which excludes the\nexistence of such things as it imagines to be present to it.  If\nthe mind, while imagining non--existent things as present to it,\nis at the same time conscious that they do not really exist, this\npower of imagination must be set down to the efficacy of its\nnature, and not to a fault, especially if this faculty of\nimagination depend solely on its own nature--that is (I. Def.\nvii.), if this faculty of imagination be free.\nPROP. XVIII.  If the human body has once been affected by two or\nmore bodies at the same time, when the mind afterwards imagines\nany of them, it will straightway remember the others also.\nProof.--The mind (II. xvii. Coroll.) imagines any given body,\nbecause the human body is affected and disposed by the\nimpressions from an external body, in the same manner as it is\naffected when certain of its parts are acted on by the said\nexternal body; but (by our hypothesis) the body was then so\ndisposed, that the mind imagined two bodies at once; therefore,\nit will also in the second case imagine two bodies at once, and\nthe mind, when it imagines one, will straightway remember the\nother.  Q.E.D.\nNote.--We now clearly see what Memory is.  It is simply a\ncertain association of ideas involving the nature of things\noutside the human body, which association arises in the mind\naccording to the order and association of the modifications\n(affectiones) of the human body.  I say, first, it is an\nassociation of those ideas only, which involve the nature of\nthings outside the human body: not of ideas which answer to the\nnature of the said things: ideas of the modifications of the\nhuman body are, strictly speaking (II. xvi.), those which involve\nthe nature both of the human body and of external bodies.  I say,\nsecondly, that this association arises according to the order and\nassociation of the modifications of the human body, in order to\ndistinguish it from that association of ideas, which arises from\nthe order of the intellect, whereby the mind perceives things\nthrough their primary causes, and which is in all men the same.\nAnd hence we can further clearly understand, why the mind from\nthe thought of one thing, should straightway arrive at the\nthought of another thing, which has no similarity with the first;\nfor instance, from the thought of the word pomum (an apple), a\nRoman would straightway arrive at the thought of the fruit apple,\nwhich has no similitude with the articulate sound in question,\nnor anything in common with it, except that the body of the man\nhas often been affected by these two things; that is, that the\nman has often heard the word pomum, while he was looking at the\nfruit; similarly every man will go on from one thought to\nanother, according as his habit has ordered the images of things\nin his body.  For a soldier, for instance, when he sees the\ntracks of a horse in sand, will at once pass from the thought of\na horse to the thought of a horseman, and thence to the thought\nof war, &c.; while a countryman will proceed from the thought of\na horse to the thought of a plough, a field, &c.  Thus every man\nwill follow this or that train of thought, according as he has\nbeen in the habit of conjoining and associating the mental images\nof things in this or that manner.\nPROP. XIX.  The human mind has no knowledge of the body, and does\nnot know it to exist, save through the ideas of the modifications\nwhereby the body is affected.\nProof.--The human mind is the very idea or knowledge of the\nhuman body (II. xiii.), which (II. ix.) is in God, in so far as\nhe is regarded as affected by another idea of a particular thing\nactually existing: or, inasmuch as (Post. iv.) the human body\nstands in need of very many bodies whereby it is, as it were,\ncontinually regenerated; and the order and connection of ideas\nis the same as the order and connection of causes (II. vii.);\nthis idea will therefore be in God, in so far as he is regarded\nas affected by the ideas of very many particular things.  Thus\nGod has the idea of the human body, or knows the human body, in\nso far as he is affected by very many other ideas, and not in so\nfar as he constitutes the nature of the human mind; that is (by\nII. xi. Coroll.), the human mind does not know the human body.\nBut the ideas of the modifications of body are in God, in so far\nas  he constitutes the nature of the human mind, or the human\nmind perceives those modifications (II. xii.), and consequently\n(II. xvi.) the human body itself, and as actually existing;\ntherefore the mind perceives thus far only the human body.\nQ.E.D.\nPROP. XX.  The idea or knowledge of the human mind is also in\nGod, following in God in the same manner, and being referred to\nGod in the same manner, as the idea or knowledge of the human\nbody.\nProof.--Thought is an attribute of God (II. i.); therefore\n(II. iii.) there must necessarily be in God the idea both of\nthought itself and of all its modifications, consequently also of\nthe human mind (II. xi.).  Further, this idea or knowledge of the\nmind does not follow from God, in so far as he is infinite, but\nin so far as he is affected by another idea of an individual\nthing (II. ix.).  But (II. vii.) the order and connection of\nideas is the same as the order and connection of causes;\ntherefore this idea or knowledge of the mind is in God and is\nreferred to God, in the same manner as the idea or knowledge of\nthe body.  Q.E.D.\nPROP. XXI.  This idea of the mind is united to the mind in the\nsame way as the mind is united to the body.\nProof.--That the mind is united to the body we have shown from\nthe fact, that the body is the object of the mind (II. xii. and\nxiii.); and so for the same reason the idea of the mind must be\nunited with its object, that is, with the mind in the same manner\nas the mind is united to the body.  Q.E.D.\nNote.--This proposition is comprehended much more clearly from\nwhat we have said in the note to II. vii.  We there showed that\nthe idea of body and body, that is, mind and body (II. xiii.),\nare one and the same individual conceived now under the attribute\nof thought, now under the attribute of extension; wherefore the\nidea of the mind and the mind itself are one and the same thing,\nwhich is conceived under one and the same attribute, namely,\nthought.  The idea of the mind, I repeat, and the mind itself are\nin God by the same necessity and follow from him from the same\npower of thinking.  Strictly speaking, the idea of the mind, that\nis, the idea of an idea, is nothing but the distinctive quality\n(forma) of the idea in so far as it is conceived as a mode of\nthought without reference to the object; if a man knows\nanything, he, by that very fact, knows that he knows it, and at\nthe same time knows that he knows that he knows it, and so on to\ninfinity.  But I will treat of this hereafter.\nPROP. XXII.  The human mind perceives not only the modifications\nof the body, but also the ideas of such modifications.\nProof.--The ideas of the ideas of modifications follow in God\nin the same manner, and are referred to God in the same manner,\nas the ideas of the said modifications.  This is proved in the\nsame way as II. xx.  But the ideas of the modifications of the\nbody are in the human mind (II. xii.), that is, in God, in so far\nas he constitutes the essence of the human mind; therefore the\nideas of these ideas will be in God, in so far as he has the\nknowledge or idea of the human mind, that is (II. xxi.), they\nwill be in the human mind itself, which therefore perceives not\nonly the modifications of the body, but also the ideas of such\nmodifications.  Q.E.D.\nPROP. XXIII.  The mind does not know itself, except in so far as\nit perceives the ideas of the modifications of the body.\nProof.--The idea or knowledge of the mind (II. xx.) follows in\nGod in the same manner, and is referred to God in the same\nmanner, as the idea or knowledge of the body.  But since (II.\nxix.) the human mind does not know the human body itself, that is\n(II. xi. Coroll.), since the knowledge of the human body is not\nreferred to God, in so far as he constitutes the nature of the\nhuman mind; therefore, neither is the knowledge of the mind\nreferred to God, in so far as he constitutes the essence of the\nhuman mind; therefore (by the same Coroll. II. xi.), the human\nmind thus far has no knowledge of itself.  Further the ideas of\nthe modifications, whereby the body is affected, involve the\nnature of the human body itself (II. xvi.), that is (II. xiii.),\nthey agree with the nature of the mind; wherefore the knowledge\nof these ideas necessarily involves knowledge of the mind; but\n(by the last Prop.) the knowledge of these ideas is in the human\nmind itself; wherefore the human mind thus far only has\nknowledge of itself.  Q.E.D.\nPROP. XXIV.  The human mind does not involve an adequate\nknowledge of the parts composing the human body.\nProof.--The parts composing the human body do not belong to\nthe essence of that body, except in so far as they communicate\ntheir motions to one another in a certain fixed relation (Def.\nafter Lemma iii.), not in so far as they can be regarded as\nindividuals without relation to the human body.  The parts of the\nhuman body are highly complex individuals  (Post. i.), whose\nparts (Lemma iv.) can be separated from the human body without in\nany way destroying the nature and distinctive quality of the\nlatter, and they can communicate their motions (Ax. i., after\nLemma iii.) to other bodies in another relation; therefore (II.\niii.)  the idea or knowledge of each part will be in God,\ninasmuch (II. ix.) as he is regarded as affected by another idea\nof a particular thing, which particular thing is prior in the\norder of nature to the aforesaid part (II. vii.).  We may affirm\nthe same thing of each part of each individual composing the\nhuman body; therefore, the knowledge of each part composing the\nhuman body is in God, in so far as he is affected by very many\nideas of things, and not in so far as he has the idea of the\nhuman body only, in other words, the idea which constitutes the\nnature of the human mind (II. xiii); therefore (II. xi.\nCoroll.), the human mind does not involve an adequate knowledge\nof the human body.  Q.E.D.\nPROP. XXV.  The idea of each modification of the human body does\nnot involve an adequate knowledge of the external body.\nProof.--We have shown that the idea of a modification of the\nhuman body involves the nature of an external body, in so far as\nthat external body conditions the human body in a given manner.\nBut, in so far as the external body is an individual, which has\nno reference to the human body, the knowledge or idea thereof is\nin God (II. ix.), in so far as God is regarded as affected by the\nidea of a further thing, which (II. vii.) is naturally prior to\nthe said external body.  Wherefore an adequate knowledge of the\nexternal body is not in God, in so far as he has the idea of the\nmodification of the human body; in other words, the idea of the\nmodification of the human body does not involve an adequate\nknowledge of the external body.  Q.E.D.\nPROP. XXVI.  The human mind does not perceive any external body\nas actually existing, except through the ideas of the\nmodifications of its own body.\nProof.--If the human body is in no way affected by a given\nexternal body, then  (II. vii.) neither is the idea of the human\nbody, in other words, the human mind, affected in any way by the\nidea of the existence of the said external body, nor does it in\nany manner perceive its existence.  But, in so far as the human\nbody is affected in any way by a given external body, thus far\n(II. xvi. and Coroll.) it perceives that external body.  Q.E.D.\nCorollary.--In so far as the human mind imagines an external\nbody, it has not an adequate knowledge thereof.\nProof.--When the human mind regards external bodies through\nthe ideas of the modifications of its own body, we say that it\nimagines (see II. xvii. note); now the mind can only imagine\nexternal bodies as actually existing.  Therefore (by II. xxv.),\nin so far as the mind imagines external bodies, it has not an\nadequate knowledge of them.  Q.E.D.\nPROP. XXVII.  The idea of each modification of the human body\ndoes not involve an adequate knowledge of the human body itself.\nProof.--Every idea of a modification of the human body\ninvolves the nature of the human body, in so far as the human\nbody is regarded as affected in a given manner (II. xvi.).  But,\ninasmuch as the human body is an individual which may be affected\nin many other ways, the idea of the said modification, &c.\nQ.E.D.\nPROP. XXVIII.  The ideas of the modifications of the human body,\nin so far as they have reference only to the human mind, are not\nclear and distinct, but confused.\nProof.--The ideas of the modifications of the human body\ninvolve the nature both of the human body and of external bodies\n(II. xvi.); they must involve the nature not only of the human\nbody but also of its parts; for the modifications are modes\n(Post. iii.), whereby the parts of the human body, and,\nconsequently, the human body as a whole are affected.   But (by\nII. xxiv., xxv.) the adequate knowledge of external bodies, as\nalso of the parts composing the human body, is not in God, in so\nfar as he is regarded as affected by the human mind, but in so\nfar as he is regarded as affected by other ideas.  These ideas of\nmodifications, in so far as they are referred to the human mind\nalone, are as consequences without premisses, in other words,\nconfused ideas.  Q.E.D.\nNote.--The idea which constitutes the nature of the human mind\nis, in the same manner, proved not to be, when considered in\nitself alone, clear and distinct; as also is the case with the\nidea of the human mind, and the ideas of the ideas of the\nmodifications of the human body, in so far as they are referred\nto the mind only, as everyone may easily see.\nPROP. XXIX.  The idea of the idea of each modification of the\nhuman body does not involve an adequate knowledge of the human\nmind.\nProof.--The idea of a modification of the human body (II.\nxxvii.) does not involve an adequate knowledge of the said body,\nin other words, does not adequately express its nature; that is\n(II. xiii.) it does not agree with the nature of the mind\nadequately; therefore (I. Ax. vi) the idea of this idea does not\nadequately express the nature of the human mind, or does not\ninvolve an adequate knowledge thereof.\nCorollary.--Hence it follows that the human mind, when it\nperceives things after the common order of nature, has not an\nadequate but only a confused and fragmentary knowledge of itself,\nof its own body, and of external bodies.  For the mind does not\nknow itself, except in so far as it perceives the ideas of the\nmodifications of body (II. xxiii.).  It only perceives its own\nbody (II. xix.) through the ideas of the modifications, and only\nperceives external bodies through the same means; thus, in so\nfar as it has such ideas of modification, it has not an adequate\nknowledge of itself (II. xxix.), nor of its own body (II.\nxxvii.), nor of external bodies (II. xxv.), but only a\nfragmentary and confused knowledge thereof (II. xxviii. and\nnote).  Q.E.D.\nNote.--I say expressly, that the mind has not an adequate but\nonly a confused knowledge of itself, its own body, and of\nexternal bodies, whenever it perceives things after the common\norder of nature; that is, whenever it is determined from\nwithout, namely, by the fortuitous play of circumstance, to\nregard this or that; not at such times as it is determined from\nwithin, that is, by the fact of regarding several things at once,\nto understand their points of agreement, difference, and\ncontrast.  Whenever it is determined in anywise from within, it\nregards things clearly and distinctly, as I will show below.\nPROP. XXX.  We can only have a very inadequate knowledge of the\nduration of our body.\nProof.--The duration of our body does not depend on its\nessence (II. Ax. i.), nor on the absolute nature of God (I.\nxxi.).  But (I. xxviii.) it is conditioned to exist and operate\nby causes, which in their turn are conditioned to exist and\noperate in a fixed and definite relation by other causes, these\nlast again being conditioned by others, and so on to infinity.\nThe duration of our body therefore depends on the common order of\nnature, or the constitution of things.  Now, however a thing may\nbe constituted, the adequate knowledge of that thing is in God,\nin so far as he has the ideas of all things, and not in so far as\nhe has the idea of the human body only.  (II. ix. Coroll.)\nWherefore the knowledge of the duration of our body is in God\nvery inadequate, in so far as he is only regarded as constituting\nthe nature of the human mind; that is (II. xi. Coroll.), this\nknowledge is very inadequate to our mind.  Q.E.D.\nPROP. XXXI.  We can only have a very inadequate knowledge of the\nduration of particular things external to ourselves.\nProof.--Every particular thing, like the human body, must be\nconditioned by another particular thing to exist and operate in a\nfixed and definite relation; this other particular thing must\nlikewise be conditioned by a third, and so on to infinity.  (I.\nxxviii.)  As we have shown in the foregoing proposition, from\nthis common property of particular things, we have only a very\ninadequate knowledge of the duration of our body; we must draw a\nsimilar conclusion with regard to the duration of particular\nthings, namely, that we can only have a very inadequate knowledge\nof the duration thereof.  Q.E.D.\nCorollary.--Hence it follows that all particular things are\ncontingent and perishable.  For we can have no adequate idea of\ntheir duration (by the last Prop.), and this is what we must\nunderstand by the contingency and perishableness of things.  (I.\nxxxiii., Note i.)  For (I. xxix.), except in this sense, nothing\nis contingent.\nPROP. XXXII.  All ideas, in so far as they are referred to God,\nare true.\nProof.--All ideas which are in God agree in every respect with\ntheir objects (II. vii. Coroll.), therefore (I. Ax. vi.) they are\nall true.  Q.E.D.\nPROP. XXXIII.  There is nothing positive in ideas, which causes\nthem to be called false.\nProof.--If this be denied, conceive, if possible, a positive\nmode of thinking, which should constitute the distinctive quality\nof falsehood.  Such a mode of thinking cannot be in God (II.\nxxxii.); external to God it cannot be or be conceived (I. xv.).\nTherefore there is nothing positive in ideas which causes them to\nbe called false.  Q.E.D.\nPROP. XXXIV.  Every idea, which in us is absolute or adequate and\nperfect, is true.\nProof.--When we say that an idea in us is adequate and\nperfect, we say, in other words (II. xi. Coroll.), that the idea\nis adequate and perfect in God, in so far as he constitutes the\nessence of our mind; consequently (II. xxxii.), we say that such\nan idea is true.  Q.E.D.\nPROP. XXXV.  Falsity consists in the privation of knowledge,\nwhich inadequate, fragmentary, or confused ideas involve.\nProof.--There is nothing positive in ideas, which causes them\nto be called false (II. xxxiii.); but falsity cannot consist in\nsimple privation (for minds, not bodies, are said to err and to\nbe mistaken), neither can it consist in absolute ignorance, for\nignorance and error are not identical; wherefore it consists in\nthe privation of knowledge, which inadequate, fragmentary, or\nconfused ideas involve.  Q.E.D.\nNote.--In the note to II. xvii. I explained how error consists\nin the privation of knowledge, but in order to throw more light\non the subject I will give an example.  For instance, men are\nmistaken in thinking themselves free; their opinion is made up\nof consciousness of their own actions, and ignorance of the\ncauses by which they are conditioned.  Their idea of freedom,\ntherefore, is simply their ignorance of any cause for their\nactions.  As for their saying that human actions depend on the\nwill, this is a mere phrase without any idea to correspond\nthereto.  What the will is, and how it moves the body, they none\nof them know; those who boast of such knowledge, and feign\ndwellings and habitations for the soul, are wont to provoke\neither laughter or disgust.  So, again, when we look at the sun,\nwe imagine that it is distant from us about two hundred feet;\nthis error does not lie solely in this fancy, but in the fact\nthat, while we thus imagine, we do not know the sun's true\ndistance or the cause of the fancy.  For although we afterwards\nlearn, that the sun is distant from us more than six hundred of\nthe earth's diameters, we none the less shall fancy it to be near;\nfor we do not imagine the sun as near us, because we are\nignorant of its true distance, but because the modification of\nour body involves the essence of the sun, in so far as our said\nbody is affected thereby.\nPROP. XXXVI.  Inadequate and confused ideas follow by the same\nnecessity, as adequate or clear and distinct ideas.\nProof.--All ideas are in God (I. xv.), and in so far as they\nare referred to God are true (II. xxxii.) and (II. vii. Coroll.)\nadequate; therefore there are no ideas confused or inadequate,\nexcept in respect to a particular mind (cf. II. xxiv. and\nxxviii.); therefore all ideas, whether adequate or inadequate,\nfollow by the same necessity (II. vi.).  Q.E.D.\nPROP. XXXVII.  That which is common to all (cf. Lemma II.,\nabove), and which is equally in a part and in the whole, does not\nconstitute the essence of any particular thing.\nProof.--If this be denied, conceive, if possible, that it\nconstitutes the essence of some particular thing; for instance,\nthe essence of B.  Then (II. Def. ii.) it cannot without B either\nexist or be conceived; but this is against our hypothesis.\nTherefore it does not appertain to B's essence, nor does it\nconstitute the essence of any particular thing.  Q.E.D.\nPROP. XXXVIII.  Those things, which are common to all, and which\nare equally in a part and in the whole, cannot be conceived\nexcept adequately.\nProof.--Let A be something, which is common to all bodies, and\nwhich is equally present in the part of any given body and in the\nwhole.  I say A cannot be conceived except adequately.  For the\nidea thereof in God will necessarily be adequate (II. vii.\nCoroll.), both in so far as God has the idea of the human body,\nand also in so far as he has the idea of the modifications of the\nhuman body, which (II. xvi., xxv., xxvii.) involve in part the\nnature of the human body and the nature of external bodies; that\nis (II. xii., xiii.), the idea in God will necessarily be\nadequate, both in so far as he constitutes the human mind, and in\nso far as he has the ideas, which are in the human mind.\nTherefore the mind (II. xi. Coroll.) necessarily perceives A\nadequately, and has this adequate perception, both in so far as\nit perceives itself, and in so far as it perceives its own or any\nexternal body, nor can A be conceived in any other manner.\nQ.E.D.\nCorollary--Hence it follows that there are certain ideas or\nnotions common to all men; for (by Lemma ii.) all bodies agree\nin certain respects, which (by the foregoing Prop.) must be\nadequately or clearly and distinctly perceived by all.\nPROP. XXXIX.  That, which is common to and a property of the\nhuman body and such other bodies as are wont to affect the human\nbody, and which is present equally in each part of either, or in\nthe whole, will be represented by an adequate idea in the mind.\nProof.--If A be that, which is common to and a property of the\nhuman body and external bodies, and equally present in the human\nbody and in the said external bodies, in each part of each\nexternal body and in the whole, there will be an adequate idea of\nA in God (II. vii. Coroll.), both in so far as he has the idea of\nthe human body, and in so far as he has the ideas of the given\nexternal bodies.  Let it now be granted, that the human body is\naffected by an external body through that, which it has in common\ntherewith, namely, A; the idea of this modification will involve\nthe property A (II. xvi.), and therefore (II. vii. Coroll.) the\nidea of this modification, in so far as it involves the property\nA, will be adequate in God, in so far as God is affected by the\nidea of the human body; that is (II. xiii.), in so far as he\nconstitutes the nature of the human mind; therefore (II. xi.\nCoroll.) this idea is also adequate in the human mind.  Q.E.D.\nCorollary.--Hence it follows that the mind is fitted to\nperceive adequately more things, in proportion as its body has\nmore in common with other bodies.\nPROP. XL.  Whatsoever ideas in the mind follow from ideas which\nare therein adequate, are also themselves adequate.\nProof.--This proposition is self--evident.  For when we say\nthat an idea in the human mind follows from ideas which are\ntherein adequate, we say, in other words (II. xi. Coroll.), that\nan idea is in the divine intellect, whereof God is the cause, not\nin so far as he is infinite, nor in so far as he is affected by\nthe ideas of very many particular things, but only in so far as\nhe constitutes the essence of the human mind.\nNote I.--I have thus set forth the cause of those notions,\nwhich are common to all men, and which form the basis of our\nratiocination.  But there are other causes of certain axioms or\nnotions, which it would be to the purpose to set forth by this\nmethod of ours; for it would thus appear what notions are more\nuseful than others, and what notions have scarcely any use at\nall.  Furthermore, we should see what notions are common to all\nmen, and what notions are only clear and distinct to those who\nare unshackled by prejudice, and we should detect those which are\nill--founded.  Again we should discern whence the notions called\nsecondary derived their origin, and consequently the axioms on\nwhich they are founded, and other points of interest connected\nwith these questions.  But I have decided to pass over the\nsubject here, partly because I have set it aside for another\ntreatise, partly because I am afraid of wearying the reader by\ntoo great prolixity.  Nevertheless, in order not to omit anything\nnecessary to be known, I will briefly set down the causes, whence\nare derived the terms styled transcendental, such as Being,\nThing, Something.  These terms arose from the fact, that the\nhuman body, being limited, is only capable of distinctly forming\na certain number of images (what an image is I explained in the\nII. xvii. note) within itself at the same time; if this number\nbe exceeded, the images will begin to be confused; if this\nnumber of images, of which the body is capable of forming\ndistinctly within itself, be largely exceeded, all will become\nentirely confused one with another.  This being so, it is evident\n(from II. Prop. xvii. Coroll., and xviii.) that the human mind\ncan distinctly imagine as many things simultaneously, as its body\ncan form images simultaneously.  When the images become quite\nconfused in the body, the mind also imagines all bodies\nconfusedly without any distinction, and will comprehend them, as\nit were, under one attribute, namely, under the attribute of\nBeing, Thing, &c.  The same conclusion can be drawn from the fact\nthat images are not always equally vivid, and from other\nanalogous causes, which there is no need to explain here; for\nthe purpose which we have in view it is sufficient for us to\nconsider one only.  All may be reduced to this, that these terms\nrepresent ideas in the highest degree confused.  From similar\ncauses arise those notions, which we call general, such as man,\nhorse, dog, &c.  They arise, to wit, from the fact that so many\nimages, for instance, of men, are formed simultaneously in the\nhuman mind, that the powers of imagination break down, not indeed\nutterly, but to the extent of the mind losing count of small\ndifferences between individuals (e.g. colour, size, &c.) and\ntheir definite number, and only distinctly imagining that, in\nwhich all the individuals, in so far as the body is affected by\nthem, agree; for that is the point, in which each of the said\nindividuals chiefly affected the body; this the mind expresses\nby the name man, and this it predicates of an infinite number of\nparticular individuals.  For, as we have said, it is unable to\nimagine the definite number of individuals.  We must, however,\nbear in mind, that these general notions are not formed by all\nmen in the same way, but vary in each individual according as the\npoint varies, whereby the body has been most often affected and\nwhich the mind most easily imagines or remembers.  For instance,\nthose who have most often regarded with admiration the stature of\nman, will by the name of man understand an animal of erect\nstature; those who have been accustomed to regard some other\nattribute, will form a different general image of man, for\ninstance, that man is a laughing animal, a two--footed animal\nwithout feathers, a rational animal, and thus, in other cases,\neveryone will form general images of things according to the\nhabit of his body.\nIt is thus not to be wondered at, that among philosophers,\nwho seek to explain things in nature merely by the images formed\nof them, so many controversies should have arisen.\nNote II.--From all that has been said above it is clear, that\nwe, in many cases, perceive and form our general notions:--(1.)\nFrom particular things represented to our intellect\nfragmentarily, confusedly, and without order through our senses\n(II. xxix. Coroll.); I have settled to call such perceptions by\nthe name of knowledge from the mere suggestions of experience.[4]\n[4] A Baconian phrase.  Nov. Org. Aph. 100.  [Pollock, p. 126, n.]\n(2.) From symbols, e.g., from the fact of having read or heard\ncertain words we remember things and form certain ideas\nconcerning them, similar to those through which we imagine things\n(II. xviii. note).  I shall call both these ways of regarding\nthings knowledge of the first kind, opinion, or imagination.\n(3.) From the fact that we have notions common to all men, and\nadequate ideas of the properties of things (II. xxxviii. Coroll.,\nxxxix. and Coroll. and xl.); this I call reason and knowledge of\nthe second kind.  Besides these two kinds of knowledge, there is,\nas I will hereafter show, a third kind of knowledge, which we\nwill call intuition.  This kind of knowledge proceeds from an\nadequate idea of the absolute essence of certain attributes of\nGod to the adequate knowledge of the essence of things.  I will\nillustrate all three kinds of knowledge by a single example.\nThree numbers are given for finding a fourth, which shall be to\nthe third as the second is to the first.  Tradesmen without\nhesitation multiply the second by the third, and divide the\nproduct by the first; either because they have not forgotten the\nrule which they received from a master without any proof, or\nbecause they have often made trial of it with simple numbers, or\nby virtue of the proof of the nineteenth proposition of the\nseventh book of Euclid, namely, in virtue of the general property\nof proportionals.\nBut with very simple numbers there is no need of this.  For\ninstance, one, two, three, being given, everyone can see that the\nfourth proportional is six; and this is much clearer, because we\ninfer the fourth number from an intuitive grasping of the ratio,\nwhich the first bears to the second.\nPROP. XLI.  Knowledge of the first kind is the only source of\nfalsity, knowledge of the second and third kinds is necessarily\ntrue.\nProof.--To knowledge of the first kind we have (in the\nforegoing note) assigned all those ideas, which are inadequate\nand confused; therefore this kind of knowledge is the only\nsource of falsity (II. xxxv.).  Furthermore, we assigned to the\nsecond and third kinds of knowledge those ideas which are\nadequate; therefore these kinds are necessarily true (II.\nxxxiv.).  Q.E.D.\nPROP. XLII.  Knowledge of the second and third kinds, not\nknowledge of the first kind, teaches us to distinguish the true\nfrom the false.\nProof.--This proposition is self--evident.  He, who knows how\nto distinguish between true and false, must have an adequate idea\nof true and false.  That is (II. xl., note ii.), he must know the\ntrue and the false by the second or third kind of knowledge.\nPROP. XLIII.  He, who has a true idea, simultaneously knows that\nhe has a true idea, and cannot doubt of the truth of the thing\nperceived.\nProof.--A true idea in us is an idea which is adequate in God,\nin so far as he is displayed through the nature of the human mind\n(II. xi. Coroll.).  Let us suppose that there is in God, in so\nfar as he is displayed through the human mind, an adequate idea,\nA.  The idea of this idea must also necessarily be in God, and be\nreferred to him in the same way as the idea A (by II. xx.,\nwhereof the proof is of universal application).  But the idea A\nis supposed to be referred to God, in so far as he is displayed\nthrough the human mind; therefore, the idea of the idea A must\nbe referred to God in the same manner; that is (by II. xi.\nCoroll.), the adequate idea of the idea A will be in the mind,\nwhich has the adequate idea A; therefore he, who has an adequate\nidea or knows a thing truly (II. xxxiv.), must at the same time\nhave an adequate idea or true knowledge of his knowledge; that\nis, obviously, he must be assured.  Q.E.D.\nNote.--I explained in the note to II. xxi. what is meant by\nthe idea of an idea; but we may remark that the foregoing\nproposition is in itself sufficiently plain.  No one, who has a\ntrue idea, is ignorant that a true idea involves the highest\ncertainty.  For to have a true idea is only another expression\nfor knowing a thing perfectly, or as well as possible.  No one,\nindeed, can doubt of this, unless he thinks that an idea is\nsomething lifeless, like a picture on a panel, and not a mode of\nthinking--namely, the very act of understanding.  And who, I ask,\ncan know that he understands anything, unless he do first\nunderstand it?  In other words, who can know that he is sure of a\nthing, unless he be first sure of that thing?  Further, what can\nthere be more clear, and more certain, than a true idea as a\nstandard of truth?  Even as light displays both itself and\ndarkness, so is truth a standard both of itself and of falsity.\nI think I have thus sufficiently answered these\nquestions--namely, if a true idea is distinguished from a false\nidea, only in so far as it is said to agree with its object, a\ntrue idea has no more reality or perfection than a false idea\n(since the two are only distinguished by an extrinsic mark);\nconsequently, neither will a man who has a true idea have any\nadvantage over him who has only false ideas.  Further, how comes\nit that men have false ideas?  Lastly, how can anyone be sure,\nthat he has ideas which agree with their objects?  These\nquestions, I repeat, I have, in my opinion, sufficiently\nanswered.  The difference between a true idea and a false idea is\nplain: from what was said in II. xxxv., the former is related to\nthe latter as being is to not--being.  The causes of falsity I\nhave set forth very clearly in II. xix. and II. xxxv. with the\nnote.  From what is there stated, the difference between a man\nwho has true ideas, and a man who has only false ideas, is made\napparent.  As for the last question--as to how a man can be sure\nthat he has ideas that agree with their objects, I have just\npointed out, with abundant clearness, that his knowledge arises\nfrom the simple fact, that he has an idea which corresponds with\nits object--in other words, that truth is its own standard.  We\nmay add that our mind, in so far as it perceives things truly, is\npart of the infinite intellect of God (II. xi. Coroll.);\ntherefore, the clear and distinct ideas of the mind are as\nnecessarily true as the ideas of God.\nPROP. XLIV.  It is not in the nature of reason to regard things\nas contingent, but as necessary.\nProof.--It is in the nature of reason to perceive things truly\n(II. xli.), namely (I. Ax. vi.), as they are in themselves--that\nis (I. xxix.), not as contingent, but as necessary.  Q.E.D.\nCorollary I.--Hence it follows, that it is only through our\nimagination that we consider things, whether in respect to the\nfuture or the past, as contingent.\nNote.--How this way of looking at things arises, I will\nbriefly explain.  We have shown above (II. xvii. and Coroll.)\nthat the mind always regards things as present to itself, even\nthough they be not in existence, until some causes arise which\nexclude their existence and presence.  Further (II. xviii.), we\nshowed that, if the human body has once been affected by two\nexternal bodies simultaneously, the mind, when it afterwards\nimagines one of the said external bodies, will straightway\nremember the other--that is, it will regard both as present to\nitself, unless there arise causes which exclude their existence\nand presence.  Further, no one doubts that we imagine time, from\nthe fact that we imagine bodies to be moved some more slowly than\nothers, some more quickly, some at equal speed.  Thus, let us\nsuppose that a child yesterday saw Peter for the first time in\nthe morning, Paul at noon, and Simon in the evening; then, that\ntoday he again sees Peter in the morning.  It is evident, from\nII. Prop. xviii., that, as soon as he sees the morning light, he\nwill imagine that the sun will traverse the same parts of the\nsky, as it did when he saw it on the preceding day; in other\nwords, he will imagine a complete day, and, together with his\nimagination of the morning, he will imagine Peter; with noon, he\nwill imagine Paul; and with evening, he will imagine Simon--that\nis, he will imagine the existence of Paul and Simon in relation\nto a future time; on the other hand, if he sees Simon in the\nevening, he will refer Peter and Paul to a past time, by\nimagining them simultaneously with the imagination of a past\ntime.  If it should at any time happen, that on some other\nevening the child should see James instead of Simon, he will, on\nthe following morning, associate with his imagination of evening\nsometimes Simon, sometimes James, not both together: for the\nchild is supposed to have seen, at evening, one or other of them,\nnot both together.  His imagination will therefore waver; and,\nwith the imagination of future evenings, he will associate first\none, then the other--that is, he will imagine them in the future,\nneither of them as certain, but both as contingent.  This\nwavering of the imagination will be the same, if the imagination\nbe concerned with things which we thus contemplate, standing in\nrelation to time past or time present: consequently, we may\nimagine things as contingent, whether they be referred to time\npresent, past, or future.\nCorollary II.--It is in the nature of reason to perceive\nthings under a certain form of eternity (sub quadam aeternitatis\nspecie).\nProof.--It is in the nature of reason to regard things, not as\ncontingent, but as necessary (II. xliv.).  Reason perceives this\nnecessity of things (II. xli.) truly--that is (I. Ax. vi.), as it\nis in itself.  But (I. xvi.) this necessity of things is the very\nnecessity of the eternal nature of God; therefore, it is in the\nnature of reason to regard things under this form of eternity.\nWe may add that the bases of reason are the notions (II.\nxxxviii.), which answer to things common to all, and which (II.\nxxxvii.) do not answer to the essence of any particular thing:\nwhich must therefore be conceived without any relation to time,\nunder a certain form of eternity.\nPROP. XLV.  Every idea of every body, or of every particular\nthing actually existing, necessarily involves the eternal and\ninfinite essence of God.\nProof.--The idea of a particular thing actually existing\nnecessarily involves both the existence and the essence of the\nsaid thing (II. viii.).  Now particular things cannot be\nconceived without God (I. xv.); but, inasmuch as (II. vi.) they\nhave God for their cause, in so far as he is regarded under the\nattribute of which the things in question are modes, their ideas\nmust necessarily involve (I. Ax. iv.) the conception of the\nattributes of those ideas--that is (I. vi.), the eternal and\ninfinite essence of God.  Q.E.D.\nNote.--By existence I do not here mean duration--that is,\nexistence in so far as it is conceived abstractedly, and as a\ncertain form of quantity.  I am speaking of the very nature of\nexistence, which is assigned to particular things, because they\nfollow in infinite numbers and in infinite ways from the eternal\nnecessity of God's nature (I. xvi.).  I am speaking, I repeat, of\nthe very existence of particular things, in so far as they are in\nGod.  For although each particular thing be conditioned by\nanother particular thing to exist in a given way, yet the force\nwhereby each particular thing perseveres in existing follows from\nthe eternal necessity of God's nature (cf. I. xxiv. Coroll.).\nPROP. XLVI.  The knowledge of the eternal and infinite essence of\nGod which every idea involves is adequate and perfect.\nProof.--The proof of the last proposition is universal; and\nwhether a thing be considered as a part or a whole, the idea\nthereof, whether of the whole or of a part (by the last Prop.),\nwill involve God's eternal and infinite essence.  Wherefore,\nthat, which gives knowledge of the eternal and infinite essence\nof God, is common to all, and is equally in the part and in the\nwhole; therefore (II. xxxviii.) this knowledge will be adequate.\nQ.E.D.\nPROP. XLVII.  The human mind has an adequate knowledge of the\neternal and infinite essence of God.\nProof.--The human mind has ideas (II. xxii.), from which (II.\nxxiii.) it perceives itself and its own body (II. xix.) and\nexternal bodies (II. xvi. Coroll. i. and II. xvii.) as actually\nexisting; therefore (II. xlv. and xlvi.) it has an adequate\nknowledge of the eternal and infinite essence of God.  Q.E.D.\nNote.--Hence we see, that the infinite essence and the\neternity of God are known to all.  Now as all things are in God,\nand are conceived through God, we can from this knowledge infer\nmany things, which we may adequately know, and we may form that\nthird kind of knowledge of which we spoke in the note to II. xl.,\nand of the excellence and use of which we shall have occasion to\nspeak in Part V.  Men have not so clear a knowledge of God as\nthey have of general notions, because they are unable to imagine\nGod as they do bodies, and also because they have associated the\nname God with images of things that they are in the habit of\nseeing, as indeed they can hardly avoid doing, being, as they\nare, men, and continually affected by external bodies.  Many\nerrors, in truth, can be traced to this head, namely, that we do\nnot apply names to things rightly.  For instance, when a man says\nthat the lines drawn from the centre of a circle to its\ncircumference are not equal, he then, at all events, assuredly\nattaches a meaning to the word circle different from that\nassigned by mathematicians.  So again, when men make mistakes in\ncalculation, they have one set of figures in their mind, and\nanother on the paper.  If we could see into their minds, they do\nnot make a mistake; they seem to do so, because we think, that\nthey have the same numbers in their mind as they have on the\npaper.  If this were not so, we should not believe them to be in\nerror, any more than I thought that a man was in error, whom I\nlately heard exclaiming that his entrance hall had flown into a\nneighbour's hen, for his meaning seemed to me sufficiently clear.\nVery many controversies have arisen from the fact, that men do\nnot rightly explain their meaning, or do not rightly interpret\nthe meaning of others.  For, as a matter of fact, as they flatly\ncontradict themselves, they assume now one side, now another, of\nthe argument, so as to oppose the opinions, which they consider\nmistaken and absurd in their opponents.\nPROP. XLVIII.  In the mind there is no absolute or free will;\nbut the mind is determined to wish this or that by a cause, which\nhas also been determined by another cause, and this last by\nanother cause, and so on to infinity.\nProof.--The mind is a fixed and definite mode of thought (II.\nxi.), therefore it cannot be the free cause of its actions (I.\nxvii. Coroll. ii.); in other words, it cannot have an absolute\nfaculty of positive or negative volition; but (by I. xxviii.) it\nmust be determined by a cause, which has also been determined by\nanother cause, and this last by another, &c.  Q.E.D.\nNote.--In the same way it is proved, that there is in the mind\nno absolute faculty of understanding, desiring, loving, &c.\nWhence it follows, that these and similar faculties are either\nentirely fictitious, or are merely abstract and general terms,\nsuch as we are accustomed to put together from particular things.\nThus the intellect and the will stand in the same relation to\nthis or that idea, or this or that volition, as \"lapidity\" to\nthis or that stone, or as \"man\" to Peter and Paul.  The cause\nwhich leads men to consider themselves free has been set forth in\nthe Appendix to Part I.  But, before I proceed further, I would\nhere remark that, by the will to affirm and decide, I mean the\nfaculty, not the desire.  I mean, I repeat, the faculty, whereby\nthe mind affirms or denies what is true or false, not the desire,\nwherewith the mind wishes for or turns away from any given thing.\nAfter we have proved, that these faculties of ours are general\nnotions, which cannot be distinguished from the particular\ninstances on which they are based, we must inquire whether\nvolitions themselves are anything besides the ideas of things.\nWe must inquire, I say, whether there is in the mind any\naffirmation or negation beyond that, which the idea, in so far as\nit is an idea, involves.  On which subject see the following\nproposition, and II. Def. iii., lest the idea of pictures should\nsuggest itself.  For by ideas I do not mean images such as are\nformed at the back of the eye, or in the midst of the brain, but\nthe conceptions of thought.\nPROP. XLIX.  There is in the mind no volition or affirmation and\nnegation, save that which an idea, inasmuch as it is an idea,\ninvolves.\nProof.--There is in the mind no absolute faculty of positive\nor negative volition, but only particular volitions, namely, this\nor that affirmation, and this or that negation.  Now let us\nconceive a particular volition, namely, the mode of thinking\nwhereby the mind affirms, that the three interior angles of a\ntriangle are equal to two right angles.  This affirmation\ninvolves the conception or idea of a triangle, that is, without\nthe idea of a triangle it cannot be conceived.  It is the same\nthing to say, that the concept A must involve the concept B, as\nit is to say, that A cannot be conceived without B.  Further,\nthis affirmation cannot be made (II. Ax. iii.) without the idea\nof a triangle.  Therefore, this affirmation can neither be nor be\nconceived, without the idea of a triangle.  Again, this idea of a\ntriangle must involve this same affirmation, namely, that its\nthree interior angles are equal to two right angles.  Wherefore,\nand vice versa, this idea of a triangle can neither be nor be\nconceived without this affirmation, therefore, this affirmation\nbelongs to the essence of the idea of a triangle, and is nothing\nbesides.  What we have said of this volition (inasmuch as we have\nselected it at random) may be said of any other volition, namely,\nthat it is nothing but an idea.  Q.E.D.\nCorollary.--Will and understanding are one and the same.\nProof.--Will and understanding are nothing beyond the\nindividual volitions and ideas (II. xlviii. and note).  But a\nparticular volition and a particular idea are one and the same\n(by the foregoing Prop.); therefore, will and understanding are\none and the same.  Q.E.D.\nNote.--We have thus removed the cause which is commonly\nassigned for error.  For we have shown above, that falsity\nconsists solely in the privation of knowledge involved in ideas\nwhich are fragmentary and confused.  Wherefore, a false idea,\ninasmuch as it is false, does not involve certainty.  When we\nsay, then, that a man acquiesces in what is false, and that he\nhas no doubts on the subject, we do not say that he is certain,\nbut only that he does not doubt, or that he acquiesces in what is\nfalse, inasmuch as there are no reasons, which should cause his\nimagination to waver (see II. xliv. note).  Thus, although the\nman be assumed to acquiesce in what is false, we shall never say\nthat he is certain.  For by certainty we mean something positive\n(II. xliii. and note), not merely the absence of doubt.\nHowever, in order that the foregoing proposition may be fully\nexplained, I will draw attention to a few additional points, and\nI will furthermore answer the objections which may be advanced\nagainst our doctrine.  Lastly, in order to remove every scruple,\nI have thought it worth while to point out some of the\nadvantages, which follow therefrom.  I say \"some,\" for they will\nbe better appreciated from what we shall set forth in the fifth\npart.\nI begin, then, with the first point, and warn my readers to\nmake an accurate distinction between an idea, or conception of\nthe mind, and the images of things which we imagine.  It is\nfurther necessary that they should distinguish between idea and\nwords, whereby we signify things.  These three--namely, images,\nwords, and ideas--are by many persons either entirely confused\ntogether, or not distinguished with sufficient accuracy or care,\nand hence people are generally in ignorance, how absolutely\nnecessary is a knowledge of this doctrine of the will, both for\nphilosophic purposes and for the wise ordering of life.  Those\nwho think that ideas consist in images which are formed in us by\ncontact with external bodies, persuade themselves that the ideas\nof those things, whereof we can form no mental picture, are not\nideas, but only figments, which we invent by the free decree of\nour will; they thus regard ideas as though they were inanimate\npictures on a panel, and, filled with this misconception, do not\nsee that an idea, inasmuch as it is an idea, involves an\naffirmation or negation.  Again, those who confuse words with\nideas, or with the affirmation which an idea involves, think that\nthey can wish something contrary to what they feel, affirm, or\ndeny.  This misconception will easily be laid aside by one, who\nreflects on the nature of knowledge, and seeing that it in no\nwise involves the conception of extension, will therefore clearly\nunderstand, that an idea (being a mode of thinking) does not\nconsist in the image of anything, nor in words.  The essence of\nwords and images is put together by bodily motions, which in no\nwise involve the conception of thought.\nThese few words on this subject will suffice: I will\ntherefore pass on to consider the objections, which may be raised\nagainst our doctrine.  Of these, the first is advanced by those,\nwho think that the will has a wider scope than the understanding,\nand that therefore it is different therefrom.  The reason for\ntheir holding the belief, that the will has wider scope than the\nunderstanding, is that they assert, that they have no need of an\nincrease in their faculty of assent, that is of affirmation or\nnegation, in order to assent to an infinity of things which we do\nnot perceive, but that they have need of an increase in their\nfaculty of understanding.  The will is thus distinguished from\nthe intellect, the latter being finite and the former infinite.\nSecondly, it may be objected that experience seems to teach us\nespecially clearly, that we are able to suspend our judgment\nbefore assenting to things which we perceive; this is confirmed\nby the fact that no one is said to be deceived, in so far as he\nperceives anything, but only in so far as he assents or dissents.\nFor instance, he who feigns a winged horse, does not\ntherefore admit that a winged horse exists; that is, he is not\ndeceived, unless he admits in addition that a winged horse does\nexist.  Nothing therefore seems to be taught more clearly by\nexperience, than that the will or faculty of assent is free and\ndifferent from the faculty of understanding.  Thirdly, it may be\nobjected that one affirmation does not apparently contain more\nreality than another; in other words, that we do not seem to\nneed for affirming, that what is true is true, any greater power\nthan for affirming, that what is false is true.  We have,\nhowever, seen that one idea has more reality or perfection than\nanother, for as objects are some more excellent than others, so\nalso are the ideas of them some more excellent than others; this\nalso seems to point to a difference between the understanding and\nthe will.  Fourthly, it may be objected, if man does not act from\nfree will, what will happen if the incentives to action are\nequally balanced, as in the case of Buridan's ass?  Will he\nperish of hunger and thirst?  If I say that he would, I shall\nseem to have in my thoughts an ass or the statue of a man rather\nthan an actual man.  If I say that he would not, he would then\ndetermine his own action, and would consequently possess the\nfaculty of going and doing whatever he liked.  Other objections\nmight also be raised, but, as I am not bound to put in evidence\neverything that anyone may dream, I will only set myself to the\ntask of refuting those I have mentioned, and that as briefly as\npossible.\nTo the first objection I answer, that I admit that the will\nhas a wider scope than the understanding, if by the understanding\nbe meant only clear and distinct ideas; but I deny that the will\nhas a wider scope than the perceptions, and the faculty of\nforming conceptions; nor do I see why the faculty of volition\nshould be called infinite, any more than the faculty of feeling:\nfor, as we are able by the same faculty of volition to affirm an\ninfinite number of things (one after the other, for we cannot\naffirm an infinite number simultaneously), so also can we, by the\nsame faculty of feeling, feel or perceive (in succession) an\ninfinite number of bodies.  If it be said that there is an\ninfinite number of things which we cannot perceive, I answer,\nthat we cannot attain to such things by any thinking, nor,\nconsequently, by any faculty of volition.  But, it may still be\nurged, if God wished to bring it about that we should perceive\nthem, he would be obliged to endow us with a greater faculty of\nperception, but not a greater faculty of volition than we have\nalready.  This is the same as to say that, if God wished to bring\nit about that we should understand an infinite number of other\nentities, it would be necessary for him to give us a greater\nunderstanding, but not a more universal idea of entity than that\nwhich we have already, in order to grasp such infinite entities.\nWe have shown that will is a universal entity or idea, whereby we\nexplain all particular volitions--in other words, that which is\ncommon to all such volitions.\nAs, then, our opponents maintain that this idea, common or\nuniversal to all volitions, is a faculty, it is little to be\nwondered at that they assert, that such a faculty extends itself\ninto the infinite, beyond the limits of the understanding: for\nwhat is universal is predicated alike of one, of many, and of an\ninfinite number of individuals.\nTo the second objection I reply by denying, that we have a\nfree power of suspending our judgment: for, when we say that\nanyone suspends his judgment, we merely mean that he sees, that\nhe does not perceive the matter in question adequately.\nSuspension of judgment is, therefore, strictly speaking, a\nperception, and not free will.  In order to illustrate the point,\nlet us suppose a boy imagining a horse, and perceive nothing\nelse.  Inasmuch as this imagination involves the existence of the\nhorse (II. xvii. Coroll.), and the boy does not perceive anything\nwhich would exclude the existence of the horse, he will\nnecessarily regard the horse as present: he will not be able to\ndoubt of its existence, although he be not certain thereof.  We\nhave daily experience of such a state of things in dreams; and I\ndo not suppose that there is anyone, who would maintain that,\nwhile he is dreaming, he has the free power of suspending his\njudgment concerning the things in his dream, and bringing it\nabout that he should not dream those things, which he dreams that\nhe sees; yet it happens, notwithstanding, that even in dreams we\nsuspend our judgment, namely, when we dream that we are dreaming.\nFurther, I grant that no one can be deceived, so far as\nactual perception extends--that is, I grant that the mind's\nimaginations, regarded in themselves, do not involve error (II.\nxvii. note); but I deny, that a man does not, in the act of\nperception, make any affirmation.  For what is the perception of\na winged horse, save affirming that a horse has wings?  If the\nmind could perceive nothing else but the winged horse, it would\nregard the same as present to itself: it would have no reasons\nfor doubting its existence, nor any faculty of dissent, unless\nthe imagination of a winged horse be joined to an idea which\nprecludes the existence of the said horse, or unless the mind\nperceives that the idea which it possess of a winged horse is\ninadequate, in which case it will either necessarily deny the\nexistence of such a horse, or will necessarily be in doubt on the\nsubject.\nI think that I have anticipated my answer to the third\nobjection, namely, that the will is something universal which is\npredicated of all ideas, and that it only signifies that which is\ncommon to all ideas, namely, an affirmation, whose adequate\nessence must, therefore, in so far as it is thus conceived in the\nabstract, be in every idea, and be, in this respect alone, the\nsame in all, not in so far as it is considered as constituting\nthe idea's essence: for, in this respect, particular\naffirmations differ one from the other, as much as do ideas.  For\ninstance, the affirmation which involves the idea of a circle,\ndiffers from that which involves the idea of a triangle, as much\nas the idea of a circle differs from the idea of a triangle.\nFurther, I absolutely deny, that we are in need of an equal\npower of thinking, to affirm that that which is true is true, and\nto affirm that that which is false is true.  These two\naffirmations, if we regard the mind, are in the same relation to\none another as being and not--being; for there is nothing\npositive in ideas, which constitutes the actual reality of\nfalsehood (II. xxxv. note, and xlvii. note).\nWe must therefore conclude, that we are easily deceived, when\nwe confuse universals with singulars, and the entities of reason\nand abstractions with realities.  As for the fourth objection, I\nam quite ready to admit, that a man placed in the equilibrium\ndescribed  (namely, as perceiving nothing but hunger and thirst,\na certain food and a certain drink, each equally distant from\nhim) would die of hunger and thirst.  If I am asked, whether such\nan one should not rather be considered an ass than a man; I\nanswer, that I do not know, neither do I know how a man should be\nconsidered, who hangs himself, or how we should consider\nchildren, fools, madmen, &c.\nIt remains to point out the advantages of a knowledge of this\ndoctrine as bearing on conduct, and this may be easily gathered\nfrom what has been said.  The doctrine is good,\n1. Inasmuch as it teaches us to act solely according to the\ndecree of God, and to be partakers in the Divine nature, and so\nmuch the more, as we perform more perfect actions and more and\nmore understand God.  Such a doctrine not only completely\ntranquilizes our spirit, but also shows us where our highest\nhappiness or blessedness is, namely, solely in the knowledge of\nGod, whereby we are led to act only as love and piety shall bid\nus.  We may thus clearly understand, how far astray from a true\nestimate of virtue are those who expect to be decorated by God\nwith high rewards for their virtue, and their best actions, as\nfor having endured the direst slavery; as if virtue and the\nservice of God were not in itself happiness and perfect freedom.\n2. Inasmuch as it teaches us, how we ought to conduct\nourselves with respect to the gifts of fortune, or matters which\nare not in our power, and do not follow from our nature.  For it\nshows us, that we should await and endure fortune's smiles or\nfrowns with an equal mind, seeing that all things follow from the\neternal decree of God by the same necessity, as it follows from\nthe essence of a triangle, that the three angles are equal to two\nright angles.\n3. This doctrine raises social life, inasmuch as it teaches\nus to hate no man, neither to despise, to deride, to envy, or to\nbe angry with any.  Further, as it tells us that each should be\ncontent with his own, and helpful to his neighbour, not from any\nwomanish pity, favour, or superstition, but solely by the\nguidance of reason, according as the time and occasion demand, as\nI will show in Part III.\n4. Lastly, this doctrine confers no small advantage on the\ncommonwealth; for it teaches how citizens should be governed and\nled, not so as to become slaves, but so that they may freely do\nwhatsoever things are best.\nI have thus fulfilled the promise made at the beginning of\nthis note, and I thus bring the second part of my treatise to a\nclose.  I think I have therein explained the nature and\nproperties of the human mind at sufficient length, and,\nconsidering the difficulty of the subject, with sufficient\nclearness.  I have laid a foundation, whereon may be raised many\nexcellent conclusions of the highest utility and most necessary\nto be known, as will, in what follows, be partly made plain.\nPART III.\nON THE ORIGIN AND NATURE OF THE EMOTIONS\nMost writers on the emotions and on human conduct seem to be\ntreating rather of matters outside nature than of natural\nphenomena following nature's general laws.  They appear to\nconceive man to be situated in nature as a kingdom within a\nkingdom: for they believe that he disturbs rather than follows\nnature's order, that he has absolute control over his actions,\nand that he is determined solely by himself.  They attribute\nhuman infirmities and fickleness, not to the power of nature in\ngeneral, but to some mysterious flaw in the nature of man, which\naccordingly they bemoan, deride, despise, or, as usually happens,\nabuse: he, who succeeds in hitting off the weakness of the human\nmind more eloquently or more acutely than his fellows, is looked\nupon as a seer.  Still there has been no lack of very excellent\nmen (to whose toil and industry I confess myself much indebted),\nwho have written many noteworthy things concerning the right way\nof life, and have given much sage advice to mankind.  But no one,\nso far as I know, has defined the nature and strength of the\nemotions, and the power of the mind against them for their\nrestraint.\nI do not forget, that the illustrious Descartes, though he\nbelieved, that the mind has absolute power over its actions,\nstrove to explain human emotions by their primary causes, and, at\nthe same time, to point out a way, by which the mind might attain\nto absolute dominion over them.  However, in my opinion, he\naccomplishes nothing beyond a display of the acuteness of his own\ngreat intellect, as I will show in the proper place.  For the\npresent I wish to revert to those, who would rather abuse or\nderide human emotions than understand them.  Such persons will,\ndoubtless think it strange that I should attempt to treat of\nhuman vice and folly geometrically, and should wish to set forth\nwith rigid reasoning those matters which they cry out against as\nrepugnant to reason, frivolous, absurd, and dreadful.  However,\nsuch is my plan.  Nothing comes to pass in nature, which can be\nset down to a flaw therein; for nature is always the same, and\neverywhere one and the same in her efficacy and power of action;\nthat is, nature's laws and ordinances, whereby all things come to\npass and change from one form to another, are everywhere and\nalways the same; so that there should be one and the same method\nof understanding the nature of all things whatsoever, namely,\nthrough nature's universal laws and rules.  Thus the passions of\nhatred, anger, envy, and so on, considered in themselves, follow\nfrom this same necessity and efficacy of nature; they answer to\ncertain definite causes, through which they are understood, and\npossess certain properties as worthy of being known as the\nproperties of anything else, whereof the contemplation in itself\naffords us delight.  I shall, therefore, treat of the nature and\nstrength of the emotions according to the same method, as I\nemployed heretofore in my investigations concerning God and the\nmind.  I shall consider human actions and desires in exactly the\nsame manner, as though I were concerned with lines, planes, and\nsolids.\nDEFINITIONS\nI.  By an adequate cause, I mean a cause through which its effect\ncan be clearly and distinctly perceived.  By an inadequate or\npartial cause, I mean a cause through which, by itself, its\neffect cannot be understood.\nII.  I say that we act when anything takes place, either within\nus or externally to us, whereof we are the adequate cause; that\nis (by the foregoing definition) when through our nature\nsomething takes place within us or externally to us, which can\nthrough our nature alone be clearly and distinctly understood.\nOn the other hand, I say that we are passive as regards something\nwhen that something takes place within us, or follows from our\nnature externally, we being only the partial cause.\nIII.  By emotion I mean the modifications of the body, whereby\nthe active power of the said body is increased or diminished,\naided or constrained, and also the ideas of such modifications.\nN.B.  If we can be the adequate cause of any of these\nmodifications, I then call the emotion an activity, otherwise I\ncall it a passion, or state wherein the mind is passive.\nPOSTULATES\nI.  The human body can be affected in many ways, whereby its\npower of activity is increased or diminished, and also in other\nways which do not render its power of activity either greater or\nless.\nN.B.  This postulate or axiom rests on Postulate i. and\nLemmas v. and vii., which see after II. xiii.\nII.  The human body can undergo many changes, and, nevertheless,\nretain the impressions or traces of objects (cf. II. Post. v.),\nand, consequently, the same images of things (see note II.\nxvii.).\nPROP. I.  Our mind is in certain cases active, and in certain\ncases passive.  In so far as it has adequate ideas it is\nnecessarily active, and in so far as it has inadequate ideas, it\nis necessarily passive.\nProof.--In every human mind there are some adequate ideas, and\nsome ideas that are fragmentary and confused (II. xl. note).\nThose ideas which are adequate in the mind are adequate also in\nGod, inasmuch as he constitutes the essence of the mind (II. xl.\nCoroll.), and those which are inadequate in the mind are likewise\n(by the same Coroll.) adequate in God, not inasmuch as he\ncontains in himself the essence of the given mind alone, but as\nhe, at the same time, contains the minds of other things.  Again,\nfrom any given idea some effect must necessarily follow (I. 36);\nof this effect God is the adequate cause (III. Def. i.), not\ninasmuch as he is infinite, but inasmuch as he is conceived as\naffected by the given idea (II. ix.).  But of that effect whereof\nGod is the cause, inasmuch as he is affected by an idea which is\nadequate in a given mind, of that effect, I repeat, the mind in\nquestion is the adequate cause (II. xi. Coroll.).  Therefore our\nmind, in so far as it has adequate ideas (III. Def. ii.), is in\ncertain cases necessarily active; this was our first point.\nAgain, whatsoever necessarily follows from the idea which is\nadequate in God, not by virtue of his possessing in himself the\nmind of one man only, but by virtue of his containing, together\nwith the mind of that one man, the minds of other things also, of\nsuch an effect (II. xi. Coroll.) the mind of the given man is not\nan adequate, but only a partial cause; thus (III. Def. ii.) the\nmind, inasmuch as it has inadequate ideas, is in certain cases\nnecessarily passive; this was our second point.  Therefore our\nmind, &c.  Q.E.D.\nCorollary.--Hence it follows that the mind is more or less\nliable to be acted upon, in proportion as it possesses inadequate\nideas, and, contrariwise, is more or less active in proportion as\nit possesses adequate ideas.\nPROP. II.  Body cannot determine mind to think, neither can mind\ndetermine body to motion or rest or any state different from\nthese, if such there be.\nProof.--All modes of thinking have for their cause God, by\nvirtue of his being a thinking thing, and not by virtue of his\nbeing displayed under any other attribute (II. vi.).  That,\ntherefore, which determines the mind to thought is a mode of\nthought, and not a mode of extension; that is (II. Def. i.), it\nis not body.  This was our first point.  Again, the motion and\nrest of a body must arise from another body, which has also been\ndetermined to a state of motion or rest by a third body, and\nabsolutely everything which takes place in a body must spring\nfrom God, in so far as he is regarded as affected by some mode of\nextension, and not by some mode of thought (II. vi.); that is,\nit cannot spring from the mind, which is a mode of thought.  This\nwas our second point.  Therefore body cannot determine mind, &c.\nQ.E.D.\nNote.--This is made more clear by what was said in the note to\nII. vii., namely, that mind and body are one and the same thing,\nconceived first under the attribute of thought, secondly, under\nthe attribute of extension.  Thus it follows that the order or\nconcatenation of things is identical, whether nature be conceived\nunder the one attribute or the other; consequently the order of\nstates of activity and passivity in our body is simultaneous in\nnature with the order of states of activity and passivity in the\nmind. The same conclusion is evident from the manner in which we\nproved II. xii.\nNevertheless, though such is the case, and though there be no\nfurther room for doubt, I can scarcely believe, until the fact is\nproved by experience, that men can be induced to consider the\nquestion calmly and fairly, so firmly are they convinced that it\nis merely at the bidding of the mind, that the body is set in\nmotion or at rest, or performs a variety of actions depending\nsolely on the mind's will or the exercise of thought.  However,\nno one has hitherto laid down the limits to the powers of the\nbody, that is, no one has as yet been taught by experience what\nthe body can accomplish solely by the laws of nature, in so far\nas she is regarded as extension.  No one hitherto has gained such\nan accurate knowledge of the bodily mechanism, that he can\nexplain all its functions; nor need I call attention to the fact\nthat many actions are observed in the lower animals, which far\ntranscend human sagacity, and that somnambulists do many things\nin their sleep, which they would not venture to do when awake:\nthese instances are enough to show, that the body can by the sole\nlaws of its nature do many things which the mind wonders at.\nAgain, no one knows how or by what means the mind moves the\nbody, nor how many various degrees of motion it can impart to the\nbody, nor how quickly it can move it.  Thus, when men say that\nthis or that physical action has its origin in the mind, which\nlatter has dominion over the body, they are using words without\nmeaning, or are confessing in specious phraseology that they are\nignorant of the cause of the said action, and do not wonder at\nit.\nBut, they will say, whether we know or do not know the means\nwhereby the mind acts on the body, we have, at any rate,\nexperience of the fact that unless the human mind is in a fit\nstate to think, the body remains inert.  Moreover, we have\nexperience, that the mind alone can determine whether we speak or\nare silent, and a variety of similar states which, accordingly,\nwe say depend on the mind's decree.  But, as to the first point,\nI ask such objectors, whether experience does not also teach,\nthat if the body be inactive the mind is simultaneously unfitted\nfor thinking?  For when the body is at rest in sleep, the mind\nsimultaneously is in a state of torpor also, and has no power of\nthinking, such as it possesses when the body is awake.  Again, I\nthink everyone's experience will confirm the statement, that the\nmind is not at all times equally fit for thinking on a given\nsubject, but according as the body is more or less fitted for\nbeing stimulated by the image of this or that object, so also is\nthe mind more or less fitted for contemplating the said object.\nBut, it will be urged, it is impossible that solely from the\nlaws of nature considered as extended substance, we should be\nable to deduce the causes of buildings, pictures, and things of\nthat kind, which are produced only by human art; nor would the\nhuman body, unless it were determined and led by the mind, be\ncapable of building a single temple.  However, I have just\npointed out that the objectors cannot fix the limits of the\nbody's power, or say what can be concluded from a consideration\nof its sole nature, whereas they have experience of many things\nbeing accomplished solely by the laws of nature, which they would\nnever have believed possible except under the direction of mind:\nsuch are the actions performed by somnambulists while asleep, and\nwondered at by their performers when awake.  I would further call\nattention to the mechanism of the human body, which far surpasses\nin complexity all that has been put together by human art, not to\nrepeat what I have already shown, namely, that from nature, under\nwhatever attribute she be considered, infinite results follow.\nAs for the second objection, I submit that the world would be\nmuch happier, if men were as fully able to keep silence as they\nare to speak.  Experience abundantly shows that men can govern\nanything more easily than their tongues, and restrain anything\nmore easily than their appetites; when it comes about that many\nbelieve, that we are only free in respect to objects which we\nmoderately desire, because our desire for such can easily be\ncontrolled by the thought of something else frequently\nremembered, but that we are by no means free in respect to what\nwe seek with violent emotion, for our desire cannot then be\nallayed with the remembrance of anything else.  However, unless\nsuch persons had proved by experience that we do many things\nwhich we afterwards repent of, and again that we often, when\nassailed by contrary emotions, see the better and follow the\nworse, there would be nothing to prevent their believing that we\nare free in all things.  Thus an infant believes that of its own\nfree will it desires milk, an angry child believes that it freely\ndesires vengeance, a timid child believes that it freely desires\nto run away; further, a drunken man believes that he utters from\nthe free decision of his mind words which, when he is sober, he\nwould willingly have withheld: thus, too, a delirious man, a\ngarrulous woman, a child, and others of like complexion, believe\nthat they speak from the free decision of their mind, when they\nare in reality unable to restrain their impulse to talk.\nExperience teaches us no less clearly than reason, that men\nbelieve themselves to be free, simply because they are conscious\nof their actions, and unconscious of the causes whereby those\nactions are determined; and, further, it is plain that the\ndictates of the mind are but another name for the appetites, and\ntherefore vary according to the varying state of the body.\nEveryone shapes his actions according to his emotion, those who\nare assailed by conflicting emotions know not what they wish;\nthose who are not attacked by any emotion are readily swayed this\nway or that.  All these considerations clearly show that a mental\ndecision and a bodily appetite, or determined state, are\nsimultaneous, or rather are one and the same thing, which we call\ndecision, when it is regarded under and explained through the\nattribute of thought, and a conditioned state, when it is\nregarded under the attribute of extension, and deduced from the\nlaws of motion and rest.  This will appear yet more plainly in\nthe sequel.  For the present I wish to call attention to another\npoint, namely, that we cannot act by the decision of the mind,\nunless we have a remembrance of having done so.  For instance, we\ncannot say a word without remembering that we have done so.\nAgain, it is not within the free power of the mind to remember or\nforget a thing at will.  Therefore the freedom of the mind must\nin any case be limited to the power of uttering or not uttering\nsomething which it remembers.  But when we dream that we speak,\nwe believe that we speak from a free decision of the mind, yet we\ndo not speak, or, if we do, it is by a spontaneous motion of the\nbody.  Again, we dream that we are concealing something, and we\nseem to act from the same decision of the mind as that, whereby\nwe keep silence when awake concerning something we know.  Lastly,\nwe dream that from the free decision of our mind we do something,\nwhich we should not dare to do when awake.\nNow I should like to know whether there be in the mind two\nsorts of decisions, one sort illusive, and the other sort free?\nIf our folly does not carry us so far as this, we must\nnecessarily admit, that the decision of the mind, which is\nbelieved to be free, is not distinguishable from the imagination\nor memory, and is nothing more than the affirmation, which an\nidea, by virtue of being an idea, necessarily involves (II.\nxlix.).  Wherefore these decisions of the mind arise in the mind\nby the same necessity, as the ideas of things actually existing.\nTherefore those who believe, that they speak or keep silence or\nact in any way from the free decision of their mind, do but dream\nwith their eyes open.\nPROP. III.  The activities of the mind arise solely from adequate\nideas; the passive states of the mind depend solely on\ninadequate ideas.\nProof.--The first element, which constitutes the essence of\nthe mind, is nothing else but the idea of the actually existent\nbody (II. xi. and xiii.), which (II. xv.) is compounded of many\nother ideas, whereof some are adequate and some inadequate (II.\nxxix. Coroll., II. xxxviii. Coroll.).  Whatsoever therefore\nfollows from the nature of mind, and has mind for its proximate\ncause, through which it must be understood, must necessarily\nfollow either from an adequate or from an inadequate idea.  But\nin so far as the mind (III. i.) has inadequate ideas, it is\nnecessarily passive: wherefore the activities of the mind follow\nsolely from adequate ideas, and accordingly the mind is only\npassive in so far as it has inadequate ideas.  Q.E.D.\nNote.--Thus we see, that passive states are not attributed to\nthe mind, except in so far as it contains something involving\nnegation, or in so far as it is regarded as a part of nature,\nwhich cannot be clearly and distinctly perceived through itself\nwithout other parts: I could thus show, that passive states are\nattributed to individual things in the same way that they are\nattributed to the mind, and that they cannot otherwise be\nperceived, but my purpose is solely to treat of the human mind.\nPROP. IV.  Nothing can be destroyed, except by a cause external\nto itself.\nProof.--This proposition is self--evident, for the definition\nof anything affirms the essence of that thing, but does not\nnegative it; in other words, it postulates the essence of the\nthing, but does not take it away.  So long therefore as we regard\nonly the thing itself, without taking into account external\ncauses, we shall not be able to find in it anything which could\ndestroy it.  Q.E.D.\nPROP. V.  Things are naturally contrary, that is, cannot exist in\nthe same object, in so far as one is capable of destroying the\nother.\nProof.--If they could agree together or co--exist in the same\nobject, there would then be in the said object something which\ncould destroy it; but this, by the foregoing proposition, is\nabsurd, therefore things, &c.  Q.E.D.\nPROP. VI.  Everything, in so far as it is in itself, endeavours\nto persist in its own being.\nProof.--Individual things are modes whereby the attributes of\nGod are expressed in a given determinate manner (I. xxv. Coroll.);\nthat is, (I. xxxiv.), they are things which express in a given\ndeterminate manner the power of God, whereby God is and acts;\nnow no thing contains in itself anything whereby it can be\ndestroyed, or which can take away its existence (III. iv.); but\ncontrariwise it is opposed to all that could take away its\nexistence (III. v.).  Therefore, in so far as it can, and in so\nfar as it is in itself, it endeavours to persist in its own\nbeing.  Q.E.D.\nPROP. VII.  The endeavour, wherewith everything endeavours to\npersist in its own being, is nothing else but the actual essence\nof the thing in question.\nProof.--From the given essence of any thing certain\nconsequences necessarily follow (I. xxxvi.), nor have things any\npower save such as necessarily follows from their nature as\ndetermined (I. xxix.); wherefore the power of any given thing,\nor the endeavour whereby, either alone or with other things, it\nacts, or endeavours to act, that is (III. vi.), the power or\nendeavour, wherewith it endeavours to persist in its own being,\nis nothing else but the given or actual essence of the thing in\nquestion.  Q.E.D.\nPROP. VIII.  The endeavour, whereby a thing endeavours to persist\nin its own being, involves no finite time, but an indefinite\ntime.\nProof.--If it involved a limited time, which should determine\nthe duration of the thing, it would then follow solely from that\npower whereby the thing exists, that the thing could not exist\nbeyond the limits of that time, but that it must be destroyed;\nbut this (III. iv.) is absurd.  Wherefore the endeavour wherewith\na thing exists involves no definite time; but, contrariwise,\nsince (III. iv.) it will by the same power whereby it already\nexists always continue to exist, unless it be destroyed by some\nexternal cause, this endeavour involves an indefinite time.\nPROP. IX.  The mind, both in so far as it has clear and distinct\nideas, and also in so far as it has confused ideas, endeavours to\npersist in its being for an indefinite period, and of this\nendeavour it is conscious.\nProof.--The essence of the mind is constituted by adequate and\ninadequate ideas (III. iii.), therefore (III. vii.), both in so\nfar as it possesses the former, and in so far as it possesses the\nlatter, it endeavours to persist in its own being, and that for\nan indefinite time (III. viii.).  Now as the mind (II. xxiii.) is\nnecessarily conscious of itself through the ideas of the\nmodifications of the body, the mind is therefore (III. vii.)\nconscious of its own endeavour.\nNote.--This endeavour, when referred solely to the mind, is\ncalled will, when referred to the mind and body in conjunction it\nis called appetite; it is, in fact, nothing else but man's\nessence, from the nature of which necessarily follow all those\nresults which tend to its preservation; and which man has thus\nbeen determined to perform.\nFurther, between appetite and desire there is no difference,\nexcept that the term desire is generally applied to men, in so\nfar as they are conscious of their appetite, and may accordingly\nbe thus defined: Desire is appetite with consciousness thereof.\nIt is thus plain from what has been said, that in no case do we\nstrive for, wish for, long for, or desire anything, because we\ndeem it to be good, but on the other hand we deem a thing to be\ngood, because we strive for it, wish for it, long for it, or\ndesire it.\nPROP. X.  An idea, which excludes the existence of our body,\ncannot be postulated in our mind, but is contrary thereto.\nProof.--Whatsoever can destroy our body, cannot be postulated\ntherein (III. v.).  Therefore neither can the idea of such a\nthing occur in God, in so far as he has the idea of our body (II.\nix. Coroll.); that is (II. xi., xiii.), the idea of that thing\ncannot be postulated as in our mind, but contrariwise, since (II.\nxi., xiii.) the first element, that constitutes the essence of\nthe mind, is the idea of the human body as actually existing, it\nfollows that the first and chief endeavour of our mind is the\nendeavour to affirm the existence of our body: thus, an idea,\nwhich negatives the existence of our body, is contrary to our\nmind, &c.  Q.E.D.\nPROP. XI.  Whatsoever increases or diminishes, helps or hinders\nthe power of activity in our body, the idea thereof increases or\ndiminishes, helps or hinders the power of thought in our mind.\nProof.--This proposition is evident from II. vii. or from II.\nxiv.\nNote.--Thus we see, that the mind can undergo many changes,\nand can pass sometimes to a state of greater perfection,\nsometimes to a state of lesser perfection.  These passive states\nof transition explain to us the emotions of pleasure and pain.\nBy pleasure therefore in the following propositions I shall\nsignify a passive state wherein the mind passes to a greater\nperfection.  By pain I shall signify a passive state wherein the\nmind passes to a lesser perfection.  Further, the emotion of\npleasure in reference to the body and mind together I shall call\nstimulation (titillatio) or merriment (hilaritas), the emotion of\npain in the same relation I shall call suffering or melancholy.\nBut we must bear in mind, that stimulation and suffering are\nattributed to man, when one part of his nature is more affected\nthan the rest, merriment and melancholy, when all parts are alike\naffected.  What I mean by desire I have explained in the note to\nProp. ix. of this part; beyond these three I recognize no other\nprimary emotion; I will show as I proceed, that all other\nemotions arise from these three.  But, before I go further, I\nshould like here to explain at greater length Prop. x of this\npart, in order that we may clearly understand how one idea is\ncontrary to another.  In the note to II. xvii. we showed that the\nidea, which constitutes the essence of mind, involves the\nexistence of body, so long as the body itself exists.  Again, it\nfollows from what we pointed out in the Corollary to II. viii.,\nthat the present existence of our mind depends solely on the\nfact, that the mind involves the actual existence of the body.\nLastly, we showed (II. xvii., xviii. and note) that the power of\nthe mind, whereby it imagines and remembers things, also depends\non the fact, that it involves the actual existence of the body.\nWhence it follows, that the present existence of the mind and its\npower of imagining are removed, as soon as the mind ceases to\naffirm the present existence of the body.  Now the cause, why the\nmind ceases to affirm this existence of the body, cannot be the\nmind itself (III. iv.), nor again the fact that the body ceases\nto exist.  For (by II. vi.) the cause, why the mind affirms the\nexistence of the body, is not that the body began to exist;\ntherefore, for the same reason, it does not cease to affirm the\nexistence of the body, because the body ceases to exist; but\n(II. xvii.) this result follows from another idea, which excludes\nthe present existence of our body and, consequently, of our mind,\nand which is therefore contrary to the idea constituting the\nessence of our mind.\nPROP. XII.  The mind, as far as it can, endeavours to conceive\nthose things, which increase or help the power of activity in the\nbody.\nProof.--So long as the human body is affected in a mode, which\ninvolves the nature of any external body, the human mind will\nregard that external body as present (II. xvii.), and\nconsequently (II. vii.), so long as the human mind regards an\nexternal body as present, that is (II. xvii. note), conceives it,\nthe human body is affected in a mode, which involves the nature\nof the said external body; thus so long as the mind conceives\nthings, which increase or help the power of activity in our body,\nthe body is affected in modes which increase or help its power of\nactivity (III. Post. i.); consequently (III. xi.) the mind's\npower of thinking is for that period increased or helped.  Thus\n(III. vi., ix.) the mind, as far as it can, endeavours to imagine\nsuch things.  Q.E.D.\nPROP. XIII.  When the mind conceives things which diminish or\nhinder the body's power of activity, it endeavours, as far as\npossible, to remember things which exclude the existence of the\nfirst--named things.\nProof.--So long as the mind conceives anything of the kind\nalluded to, the power of the mind and body is diminished or\nconstrained (cf. III. xii. Proof); nevertheless it will continue\nto conceive it, until the mind conceives something else, which\nexcludes the present existence thereof (II. xvii.); that is (as\nI have just shown), the power of the mind and of the body is\ndiminished, or constrained, until the mind conceives something\nelse, which excludes the existence of the former thing conceived:\ntherefore the mind (III. ix.), as far as it can, will endeavour\nto conceive or remember the latter.  Q.E.D.\nCorollary.--Hence it follows that the mind shrinks from\nconceiving those things, which diminish or constrain the power of\nitself and of the body.\nNote.--From what has been said we may clearly understand the\nnature of Love and Hate.  Love is nothing else but pleasure\naccompanied by the idea of an external cause: Hate is nothing\nelse but pain accompanied by the idea of an external cause.  We\nfurther see, that he who loves necessarily endeavours to have,\nand to keep present to him, the object of his love; while he who\nhates endeavours to remove and destroy the object of his hatred.\nBut I will treat of these matters at more length hereafter.\nPROP. XIV.  If the mind has once been affected by two emotions at\nthe same time, it will, whenever it is afterwards affected by one\nof these two, be also affected by the other.\nProof.--If the human body has once been affected by two bodies\nat once, whenever afterwards the mind conceives one of them, it\nwill straightway remember the other also (II. xviii.).  But the\nmind's conceptions indicate rather the emotions of our body than\nthe nature of external bodies (II. xvi. Coroll. ii.); therefore,\nif the body, and consequently the mind (III. Def. iii.) has been\nonce affected by two emotions at the same time, it will, whenever\nit is afterwards affected by one of the two, be also affected by\nthe other.\nPROP. XV.  Anything can, accidentally, be the cause of pleasure,\npain, or desire.\nProof.--Let it be granted that the mind is simultaneously\naffected by two emotions, of which one neither increases nor\ndiminishes its power of activity, and the other does either\nincrease or diminish the said power (III. Post. i.).  From the\nforegoing proposition it is evident that, whenever the mind is\nafterwards affected by the former, through its true cause, which\n(by hypothesis) neither increases nor diminishes its power of\naction, it will be at the same time affected by the latter, which\ndoes increase or diminish its power of activity, that is (III.\nxi. note) it will be affected with pleasure or pain.  Thus the\nformer of the two emotions will, not through itself, but\naccidentally, be the cause of pleasure or pain.  In the same way\nalso it can be easily shown, that a thing may be accidentally the\ncause of desire.  Q.E.D.\nCorollary.--Simply from the fact that we have regarded a thing\nwith the emotion of pleasure or pain, though that thing be not\nthe efficient cause of the emotion, we can either love or hate\nit.\nProof.--For from this fact alone it arises (III. xiv.), that\nthe mind afterwards conceiving the said thing is affected with\nthe emotion of pleasure or pain, that is (III. xi. note),\naccording as the power of the mind and body may be increased or\ndiminished, &c.; and consequently (III. xii.), according as the\nmind may desire or shrink from the conception of it (III. xiii.\nCoroll.), in other words (III. xiii. note), according as it may\nlove or hate the same.  Q.E.D.\nNote.--Hence we understand how it may happen, that we love or\nhate a thing without any cause for our emotion being known to us;\nmerely, as a phrase is, from sympathy or antipathy.  We should\nrefer to the same category those objects, which affect us\npleasurably or painfully, simply because they resemble other\nobjects which affect us in the same way.  This I will show in the\nnext Prop.  I am aware that certain authors, who were the first\nto introduce these terms \"sympathy\" and \"antipathy,\" wished to\nsignify thereby some occult qualities in things; nevertheless I\nthink we may be permitted to use the same terms to indicate known\nor manifest qualities.\nPROP. XVI.  Simply from the fact that we conceive, that a given\nobject has some point of resemblance with another object which is\nwont to affect the mind pleasurably or painfully, although the\npoint of resemblance be not the efficient cause of the said\nemotions, we shall still regard the first--named object with love\nor hate.\nProof.--The point of resemblance was in the object (by\nhypothesis), when we regarded it with pleasure or pain, thus\n(III. xiv.), when the mind is affected by the image thereof, it\nwill straightway be affected by one or the other emotion, and\nconsequently the thing, which we perceive to have the same point\nof resemblance, will be accidentally (III. xv.) a cause of\npleasure or pain.  Thus (by the foregoing Corollary), although\nthe point in which the two objects resemble one another be not\nthe efficient cause of the emotion, we shall still regard the\nfirst--named object with love or hate.  Q.E.D.\nPROP. XVII.  If we conceive that a thing, which is wont to affect\nus painfully, has any point of resemblance with another thing\nwhich is wont to affect us with an equally strong emotion of\npleasure, we shall hate the first--named thing, and at the same\ntime we shall love it.\nProof.--The given thing is (by hypothesis) in itself a cause\nof pain, and (III. xiii. note), in so far as we imagine it with\nthis emotion, we shall hate it: further, inasmuch as we conceive\nthat it has some point of resemblance to something else, which is\nwont to affect us with an equally strong emotion of pleasure, we\nshall with an equally strong impulse of pleasure love it\n(III. xvi.); thus we shall both hate and love the same thing.\nQ.E.D.\nNote.--This disposition of the mind, which arises from two\ncontrary emotions, is called vacillation; it stands to the\nemotions in the same relation as doubt does to the imagination\n(II. xliv. note); vacillation and doubt do not differ one from\nthe other, except as greater differs from less.  But we must bear\nin mind that I have deduced this vacillation from causes, which\ngive rise through themselves to one of the emotions, and to the\nother accidentally.  I have done this, in order that they might\nbe more easily deduced from what went before; but I do not deny\nthat vacillation of the disposition generally arises from an\nobject, which is the efficient cause of both emotions.  The human\nbody is composed (II. Post. i.) of a variety of individual parts\nof different nature, and may therefore (Ax.i. after Lemma iii.\nafter II. xiii.) be affected in a variety of different ways by\none and the same body; and contrariwise, as one and the same\nthing can be affected in many ways, it can also in many different\nways affect one and the same part of the body.  Hence we can\neasily conceive, that one and the same object may be the cause of\nmany and conflicting emotions.\nPROP. XVIII. A man is as much affected pleasurably or painfully\nby the image of a thing past or future as by the image of a thing\npresent.\nProof.--So long as a man is affected by the image of anything,\nhe will regard that thing as present, even though it be\nnon--existent (II. xvii. and Coroll.), he will not conceive it as\npast or future, except in so far as its image is joined to the\nimage of time past or future (II. xliv. note).  Wherefore the\nimage of a thing, regarded in itself alone, is identical, whether\nit be referred to time past, time future, or time present; that\nis (II. xvi. Coroll.), the disposition or emotion of the body is\nidentical, whether the image be of a thing past, future, or\npresent.  Thus the emotion of pleasure or pain is the same,\nwhether the image be of a thing past or future.  Q.E.D.\nNote I.--I call a thing past or future, according as we either\nhave been or shall be affected thereby.  For instance, according\nas we have seen it, or are about to see it, according as it has\nrecreated us, or will recreate us, according as it has harmed us,\nor will harm us.  For, as we thus conceive it, we affirm its\nexistence; that is, the body is affected by no emotion which\nexcludes the existence of the thing, and therefore (II. xvii.)\nthe body is affected by the image of the thing, in the same way\nas if the thing were actually present.  However, as it generally\nhappens that those, who have had many experiences, vacillate, so\nlong as they regard a thing as future or past, and are usually in\ndoubt about its issue (II. xliv. note); it follows that the\nemotions which arise from similar images of things are not so\nconstant, but are generally disturbed by the images of other\nthings, until men become assured of the issue.\nNote II.--From what has just been said, we understand what is\nmeant by the terms Hope, Fear, Confidence, Despair, Joy, and\nDisappointment.[5]  Hope is nothing else but an inconstant\npleasure, arising from the image of something future or past,\nwhereof we do not yet know the issue.  Fear, on the other hand,\nis an inconstant pain also arising from the image of something\nconcerning which we are in doubt.  If the element of doubt be\nremoved from these emotions, hope becomes Confidence and fear\nbecomes Despair.  In other words, Pleasure or Pain arising from\nthe image of something concerning which we have hoped or feared.\nAgain, Joy is Pleasure arising from the image of something past\nwhereof we have doubted the issue.  Disappointment is the Pain\nopposed to Joy.\n[5] Conscientiae morsus--thus rendered by Mr. Pollock.\nPROP. XIX.  He who conceives that the object of his love is\ndestroyed will feel pain; if he conceives that it is preserved\nhe will feel pleasure.\nProof.--The mind, as far as possible, endeavours to conceive\nthose things which increase or help the body's power of activity\n(III. xii.); in other words (III. xii. note), those things which\nit loves.  But conception is helped by those things which\npostulate the existence of a thing, and contrariwise is hindered\nby those which exclude the existence of a thing (II. xvii.);\ntherefore the images of things, which postulate the existence of\nan object of love, help the mind's endeavour to conceive the\nobject of love, in other words (III. xi. note), affect the mind\npleasurably; contrariwise those things, which exclude the\nexistence of an object of love, hinder the aforesaid mental\nendeavour; in other words, affect the mind painfully.  He,\ntherefore, who conceives that the object of his love is destroyed\nwill feel pain, &c.  Q.E.D.\nPROP. XX.  He who conceives that the object of his hate is\ndestroyed will also feel pleasure.\nProof.--The mind (III. xiii.) endeavours to conceive those\nthings, which exclude the existence of things whereby the body's\npower of activity is diminished or constrained; that is (III.\nxiii. note), it endeavours to conceive such things as exclude the\nexistence of what it hates; therefore the image of a thing,\nwhich excludes the existence of what the mind hates, helps the\naforesaid mental effort, in other words (III. xi. note), affects\nthe mind pleasurably.  Thus he who conceives that the object of\nhis hate is destroyed will feel pleasure.  Q.E.D.\nPROP. XXI.  He who conceives, that the object of his love is\naffected pleasurably or painfully, will himself be affected\npleasurably or painfully; and the one or the other emotion will\nbe greater or less in the lover according as it is greater or\nless in the thing loved.\nProof.--The images of things (as we showed in III. xix.) which\npostulate the existence of the object of love, help the mind's\nendeavour to conceive the said object.  But pleasure postulates\nthe existence of something feeling pleasure, so much the more in\nproportion as the emotion of pleasure is greater; for it is\n(III. xi. note) a transition to a greater perfection; therefore\nthe image of pleasure in the object of love helps the mental\nendeavour of the lover; that is, it affects the lover\npleasurably, and so much the more, in proportion as this emotion\nmay have been greater in the object of love.  This was our first\npoint.  Further, in so far as a thing is affected with pain, it\nis to that extent destroyed, the extent being in proportion to\nthe amount of pain (III. xi. note); therefore (III. xix.) he who\nconceives, that the object of his love is affected painfully,\nwill himself be affected painfully, in proportion as the said\nemotion is greater or less in the object of love.  Q.E.D.\nPROP. XXII.  If we conceive that anything pleasurably affects\nsome object of our love, we shall be affected with love towards\nthat thing.  Contrariwise, if we conceive that it affects an\nobject of our love painfully, we shall be affected with hatred\ntowards it.\nProof.--He, who affects pleasurably or painfully the object of\nour love, affects us also pleasurably or painfully--that is, if we\nconceive the loved object as affected with the said pleasure or\npain (III. xxi.). But this pleasure or pain is postulated to come\nto us accompanied by the idea of an external cause; therefore\n(III. xiii. note), if we conceive that anyone affects an object\nof our love pleasurably or painfully, we shall be affected with\nlove or hatred towards him.  Q.E.D.\nNote.--Prop. xxi. explains to us the nature of Pity, which we\nmay define as pain arising from another's hurt.  What term we can\nuse for pleasure arising from another's gain, I know not.\nWe will call the love towards him who confers a benefit on\nanother, Approval; and the hatred towards him who injures\nanother, we will call Indignation.  We must further remark, that\nwe not only feel pity for a thing which we have loved (as shown\nin III. xxi.), but also for a thing which we have hitherto\nregarded without emotion, provided that we deem that it resembles\nourselves (as I will show presently).  Thus, we bestow approval\non one who has benefited anything resembling ourselves, and,\ncontrariwise, are indignant with him who has done it an injury.\nPROP. XXIII.  He who conceives, that an object of his hatred is\npainfully affected, will feel pleasure.  Contrariwise, if he\nthinks that the said object is pleasurably affected, he will feel\npain.  Each of these emotions will be greater or less, according\nas its contrary is greater or less in the object of hatred.\nProof.--In so far as an object of hatred is painfully\naffected, it is destroyed, to an extent proportioned to the\nstrength of the pain (III. xi. note).  Therefore, he (III. xx.)\nwho conceives, that some object of his hatred is painfully\naffected, will feel pleasure, to an extent proportioned to the\namount of pain he conceives in the object of his hatred.  This\nwas our first point.  Again, pleasure postulates the existence of\nthe pleasurably affected thing (III. xi. note), in proportion as\nthe pleasure is greater or less.  If anyone imagines that an\nobject of his hatred is pleasurably affected, this conception\n(III. xiii.) will hinder his own endeavour to persist; in other\nwords (III. xi. note), he who hates will be painfully affected.\nQ.E.D.\nNote.--This pleasure can scarcely be felt unalloyed, and\nwithout any mental conflict.  For (as I am about to show in Prop.\nxxvii.), in so far as a man conceives that something similar to\nhimself is affected by pain, he will himself be affected in like\nmanner; and he will have the contrary emotion in contrary\ncircumstances.  But here we are regarding hatred only.\nPROP. XXIV.  If we conceive that anyone pleasurably affects an\nobject of our hate, we shall feel hatred towards him also.  If we\nconceive that he painfully affects that said object, we shall\nfeel love towards him.\nProof.--This proposition is proved in the same way as III.\nxxii., which see.\nNote.--These and similar emotions of hatred are attributable\nto envy, which, accordingly, is nothing else but hatred, in so\nfar as it is regarded as disposing a man to rejoice in another's\nhurt, and to grieve at another's advantage.\nPROP. XXV.  We endeavour to affirm, concerning ourselves, and\nconcerning what we love, everything that we can conceive to\naffect pleasurably ourselves, or the loved object.  Contrariwise,\nwe endeavour to negative everything, which we conceive to affect\npainfully ourselves or the loved object.\nProof.--That, which we conceive to affect an object of our\nlove pleasurably or painfully, affects us also pleasurably or\npainfully (III. xxi.).  But the mind (III. xii.) endeavours, as\nfar as possible, to conceive those things which affect us\npleasurably; in other words (II. xvii. and Coroll.), it\nendeavours to regard them as present.  And, contrariwise (III.\nxiii.), it endeavours to exclude the existence of such things as\naffect us painfully; therefore, we endeavour to affirm\nconcerning ourselves, and concerning the loved object, whatever\nwe conceive to affect ourselves, or the love object pleasurably.\nQ.E.D.\nPROP. XXVI.  We endeavour to affirm, concerning that which we\nhate, everything which we conceive to affect it painfully; and,\ncontrariwise, we endeavour to deny, concerning it, everything\nwhich we conceive to affect it pleasurably.\nProof.--This proposition follows from III. xxiii., as the\nforegoing proposition followed from III. xxi.\nNote.--Thus we see that it may readily happen, that a man may\neasily think too highly of himself, or a loved object, and,\ncontrariwise, too meanly of a hated object.  This feeling is\ncalled pride, in reference to the man who thinks too highly of\nhimself, and is a species of madness, wherein a man dreams with\nhis eyes open, thinking that he can accomplish all things that\nfall within the scope of his conception, and thereupon accounting\nthem real, and exulting in them, so long as he is unable to\nconceive anything which excludes their existence, and determines\nhis own power of action.  Pride, therefore, is pleasure springing\nfrom a man thinking too highly of himself.  Again, the pleasure\nwhich arises from a man thinking too highly of another is called\nover--esteem.  Whereas the pleasure which arises from thinking too\nlittle of a man is called disdain.\nPROP. XXVII.  By the very fact that we conceive a thing, which is\nlike ourselves, and which we have not regarded with any emotion,\nto be affected with any emotion, we are ourselves affected with a\nlike emotion (affectus).\nProof.--The images of things are modifications of the human\nbody, whereof the ideas represent external bodies as present to\nus (II. xvii.); in other words (II. x.), whereof the ideas\ninvolve the nature of our body, and, at the same time, the nature\nof the external bodies as present.  If, therefore, the nature of\nthe external body be similar to the nature of our body, then the\nidea which we form of the external body will involve a\nmodification of our own body similar to the modification of the\nexternal body.  Consequently, if we conceive anyone similar to\nourselves as affected by any emotion, this conception will\nexpress a modification of our body similar to that emotion.\nThus, from the fact of conceiving a thing like ourselves to be\naffected with any emotion, we are ourselves affected with a like\nemotion.  If, however, we hate the said thing like ourselves, we\nshall, to that extent, be affected by a contrary, and not\nsimilar, emotion.  Q.E.D.\nNote I.--This imitation of emotions, when it is referred to\npain, is called compassion (cf. III. xxii. note); when it is\nreferred to desire, it is called emulation, which is nothing else\nbut the desire of anything, engendered in us by the fact that we\nconceive that others have the like desire.\nCorollary I.--If we conceive that anyone, whom we have\nhitherto regarded with no emotion, pleasurably affects something\nsimilar to ourselves, we shall be affected with love towards him.\nIf, on the other hand, we conceive that he painfully affects the\nsame, we shall be affected with hatred towards him.\nProof.--This is proved from the last proposition in the same\nmanner as III. xxii. is proved from III. xxi.\nCorollary II.--We cannot hate a thing which we pity, because\nits misery affects us painfully.\nProof.--If we could hate it for this reason, we should rejoice\nin its pain, which is contrary to the hypothesis.\nCorollary III.--We seek to free from misery, as far as we can,\na thing which we pity.\nProof.--That, which painfully affects the object of our pity,\naffects us also with similar pain (by the foregoing proposition);\ntherefore, we shall endeavour to recall everything which\nremoves its existence, or which destroys it (cf. III. xiii.); in\nother words (III. ix. note), we shall desire to destroy it, or we\nshall be determined for its destruction; thus, we shall\nendeavour to free from misery a thing which we pity.  Q.E.D.\nNote II.--This will or appetite for doing good, which arises\nfrom pity of the thing whereon we would confer a benefit, is\ncalled benevolence, and is nothing else but desire arising from\ncompassion.  Concerning love or hate towards him who has done\ngood or harm to something, which we conceive to be like\nourselves, see III. xxii. note.\nPROP. XXVIII.  We endeavour to bring about whatsoever we conceive\nto conduce to pleasure; but we endeavour to remove or destroy\nwhatsoever we conceive to be truly repugnant thereto, or to\nconduce to pain.\nProof.--We endeavour, as far as possible, to conceive that\nwhich we imagine to conduce to pleasure (III. xii.); in other\nwords (II. xvii.) we shall endeavour to conceive it as far as\npossible as present or actually existing.  But the endeavour of\nthe mind, or the mind's power of thought, is equal to, and\nsimultaneous with, the endeavour of the body, or the body's power\nof action.  (This is clear from II. vii. Coroll. and II. xi.\nCoroll.).  Therefore we make an absolute endeavour for its\nexistence, in other words (which by III. ix. note, come to the\nsame thing) we desire and strive for it; this was our first\npoint.  Again, if we conceive that something, which we believed\nto be the cause of pain, that is (III. xiii. note), which we\nhate, is destroyed, we shall rejoice (III. xx.).  We shall,\ntherefore (by the first part of this proof), endeavour to destroy\nthe same, or (III. xiii.) to remove it from us, so that we may\nnot regard it as present; this was our second point.  Wherefore\nwhatsoever conduces to pleasure, &c.  Q.E.D.\nPROP. XXIX.  We shall also endeavour to do whatsoever we conceive\nmen[6] to regard with pleasure, and contrariwise we shall shrink\nfrom doing that which we conceive men to shrink from.\n[6] By \"men\" in this and the following propositions, I mean men\nwhom we regard without any particular emotion.\nProof.--From the fact of imagining, that men love or hate\nanything, we shall love or hate the same thing (III. xxvii.).\nThat is (III. xiii. note), from this mere fact we shall feel\npleasure or pain at the thing's presence.  And so we shall\nendeavour to do whatsoever we conceive men to love or regard with\npleasure, etc.  Q.E.D.\nNote.--This endeavour to do a thing or leave it undone, solely\nin order to please men, we call ambition, especially when we so\neagerly endeavour to please the vulgar, that we do or omit\ncertain things to our own or another's hurt: in other cases it\nis generally called kindliness.  Furthermore I give the name of\npraise to the pleasure, with which we conceive the action of\nanother, whereby he has endeavoured to please us; but of blame\nto the pain wherewith we feel aversion to his action.\nPROP. XXX.  If anyone has done something which he conceives as\naffecting other men pleasurably, he will be affected by pleasure,\naccompanied by the idea of himself as cause; in other words, he\nwill regard himself with pleasure.  On the other hand, if he has\ndone anything which he conceives as affecting others painfully,\nhe will regard himself with pain.\nProof.--He who conceives, that he affects others with pleasure\nor pain, will, by that very fact, himself be affected with\npleasure or pain (III. xxvii.), but, as a man (II. xix. and\nxxiii.) is conscious of himself through the modifications whereby\nhe is determined to action, it follows that he who conceives,\nthat he affects others pleasurably, will be affected with\npleasure accompanied by the idea of himself as cause; in other\nwords, he will regard himself with pleasure.  And so mutatis\nmutandis in the case of pain.  Q.E.D.\nNote.--As love (III. xiii.) is pleasure accompanied by the\nidea of an external cause, and hatred is pain accompanied by the\nidea of an external cause; the pleasure and pain in question\nwill be a species of love and hatred.  But, as the terms love and\nhatred are used in reference to external objects, we will employ\nother names for the emotions now under discussion: pleasure\naccompanied by the idea of an external cause[7] we will style\nHonour, and the emotion contrary thereto we will style Shame: I\nmean in such cases as where pleasure or pain arises from a man's\nbelief, that he is being praised or blamed: otherwise pleasure\naccompanied by the idea of an external cause[8] is called\nself--complacency, and its contrary pain is called repentance.\nAgain, as it may happen (II. xvii. Coroll.) that the pleasure,\nwherewith a man conceives that he affects others, may exist\nsolely in his own imagination, and as (III. xxv.) everyone\nendeavours to conceive concerning himself that which he conceives\nwill affect him with pleasure, it may easily come to pass that a\nvain man may be proud and may imagine that he is pleasing to all,\nwhen in reality he may be an annoyance to all.\n[7] So Van Vloten and Bruder.  The Dutch version and Camerer read,\n\"an internal cause.\"  \"Honor\" = Gloria.\n[8] See previous endnote.\nPROP. XXXI.  If we conceive that anyone loves, desires, or hates\nanything which we ourselves love, desire, or hate, we shall\nthereupon regard the thing in question with more steadfast love,\n&c.  On the contrary, if we think that anyone shrinks from\nsomething that we love, we shall undergo vacillations of soul.\nProof.--From the mere fact of conceiving that anyone loves\nanything we shall ourselves love that thing (III. xxvii.): but\nwe are assumed to love it already; there is, therefore, a new\ncause of love, whereby our former emotion is fostered; hence we\nshall thereupon love it more steadfastly.  Again, from the mere\nfact of conceiving that anyone shrinks from anything, we shall\nourselves shrink from that thing (III. xxvii.).  If we assume\nthat we at the same time love it, we shall then simultaneously\nlove it and shrink from it; in other words, we shall be subject\nto vacillation (III. xvii. note).  Q.E.D.\nCorollary.--From the foregoing, and also from III. xxviii. it\nfollows that everyone endeavours, as far as possible, to cause\nothers to love what he himself loves, and to hate what he himself\nhates: as the poet says:  \"As lovers let us share every hope\nand every fear: ironhearted were he who should love what the\nother leaves.\"[9]\n[9] Ovid, \"Amores,\" II. xix. 4,5.  Spinoza transposes the verses.\n\"Speremus pariter, pariter metuamus amantes;\nFerreus est, si quis, quod sinit alter, amat.\"\nNote.--This endeavour to bring it about, that our own likes\nand dislikes should meet with universal approval, is really\nambition (see III. xxix. note); wherefore we see that everyone\nby nature desires (appetere), that the rest of mankind should\nlive according to his own individual disposition: when such a\ndesire is equally present in all, everyone stands in everyone\nelse's way, and in wishing to be loved or praised by all, all\nbecome mutually hateful.\nPROP. XXXII.  If we conceive that anyone takes delight in\nsomething, which only one person can possess, we shall endeavour\nto bring it about that the man in question shall not gain\npossession thereof.\nProof.--From the mere fact of our conceiving that another\nperson takes delight in a thing (III. xxvii. and Coroll.) we\nshall ourselves love that thing and desire to take delight\ntherein.  But we assumed that the pleasure in question would be\nprevented by another's delight in its object; we shall,\ntherefore, endeavour to prevent his possession thereof (III.\nxxviii.).  Q.E.D.\nNote.--We thus see that man's nature is generally so\nconstituted, that he takes pity on those who fare ill, and envies\nthose who fare well with an amount of hatred proportioned to his\nown love for the goods in their possession.  Further, we see that\nfrom the same property of human nature, whence it follows that\nmen are merciful, it follows also that they are envious and\nambitious.  Lastly, if we make appeal to Experience, we shall\nfind that she entirely confirms what we have said; more\nespecially if we turn our attention to the first years of our\nlife.  We find that children, whose body is continually, as it\nwere, in equilibrium, laugh or cry simply because they see others\nlaughing or crying; moreover, they desire forthwith to imitate\nwhatever they see others doing, and to possess themselves of\nwhatever they conceive as delighting others: inasmuch as the\nimages of things are, as we have said, modifications of the human\nbody, or modes wherein the human body is affected and disposed by\nexternal causes to act in this or that manner.\nPROP. XXXIII.  When we love a thing similar to ourselves we\nendeavour, as far as we can, to bring about that it should love\nus in return.\nProof.--That which we love we endeavour, as far as we can, to\nconceive in preference to anything else (III. xii.).  If the\nthing be similar to ourselves, we shall endeavour to affect it\npleasurably in preference to anything else (III. xxix.).  In\nother words, we shall endeavour, as far as we can, to bring it\nabout, that the thing should be affected with pleasure\naccompanied by the idea of ourselves, that is (III. xiii. note),\nthat it should love us in return.  Q.E.D.\nPROP. XXXIV.  The greater the emotion with which we conceive a\nloved object to be affected towards us, the greater will be our\ncomplacency.\nProof.--We endeavour (III. xxxiii.), as far as we can, to\nbring about, that what we love should love us in return: in\nother words, that what we love should be affected with pleasure\naccompanied by the idea of ourself as cause.  Therefore, in\nproportion as the loved object is more pleasurably affected\nbecause of us, our endeavour will be assisted.--that is (III. xi.\nand note) the greater will be our pleasure.  But when we take\npleasure in the fact, that we pleasurably affect something\nsimilar to ourselves, we regard ourselves with pleasure (III. 30);\ntherefore the greater the emotion with which we conceive a\nloved object to be affected, &c.  Q.E.D.\nPROP. XXXV.  If anyone conceives, that an object of his love\njoins itself to another with closer bonds of friendship than he\nhimself has attained to, he will be affected with hatred towards\nthe loved object and with envy towards his rival.\nProof.--In proportion as a man thinks, that a loved object is\nwell affected towards him, will be the strength of his\nself--approval (by the last Prop.), that is (III. xxx. note), of\nhis pleasure; he will, therefore (III. xxviii.), endeavour, as\nfar as he can, to imagine the loved object as most closely bound\nto him: this endeavour or desire will be increased, if he thinks\nthat someone else has a similar desire (III. xxxi.).  But this\nendeavour or desire is assumed to be checked by the image of the\nloved object in conjunction with the image of him whom the loved\nobject has joined to itself; therefore (III. xi. note) he will\nfor that reason be affected with pain, accompanied by the idea of\nthe loved object as a cause in conjunction with the image of his\nrival; that is, he will be (III. xiii.) affected with hatred\ntowards the loved object and also towards his rival (III. xv.\nCoroll.), which latter he will envy as enjoying the beloved\nobject.  Q.E.D.\nNote.--This hatred towards an object of love joined with envy\nis called Jealousy, which accordingly is nothing else but a\nwavering of the disposition arising from combined love and\nhatred, accompanied by the idea of some rival who is envied.\nFurther, this hatred towards the object of love will be greater,\nin proportion to the pleasure which the jealous man had been wont\nto derive from the reciprocated love of the said object; and\nalso in proportion to the feelings he had previously entertained\ntowards his rival.  If he had hated him, he will forthwith hate\nthe object of his love, because he conceives it is pleasurably\naffected by one whom he himself hates: and also because he is\ncompelled to associate the image of his loved one with the image\nof him whom he hates.  This condition generally comes into play\nin the case of love for a woman: for he who thinks, that a woman\nwhom he loves prostitutes herself to another, will feel pain, not\nonly because his own desire is restrained, but also because,\nbeing compelled to associate the image of her he loves with the\nparts of shame and the excreta of another, he therefore shrinks\nfrom her.\nWe must add, that a jealous man is not greeted by his beloved\nwith the same joyful countenance as before, and this also gives\nhim pain as a lover, as I will now show.\nPROP. XXXVI.  He who remembers a thing, in which he has once\ntaken delight, desires to possess it under the same circumstances\nas when he first took delight therein.\nProof.--Everything, which a man has seen in conjunction with\nthe object of his love, will be to him accidentally a cause of\npleasure (III. xv.); he will, therefore, desire to possess it,\nin conjunction with that wherein he has taken delight; in other\nwords, he will desire to possess the object of his love under the\nsame circumstances as when he first took delight therein.  Q.E.D.\nCorollary.--A lover will, therefore, feel pain if one of the\naforesaid attendant circumstances be missing.\nProof.--For, in so far as he finds some circumstance to be\nmissing, he conceives something which excludes its existence.  As\nhe is assumed to be desirous for love's sake of that thing or\ncircumstance (by the last Prop.), he will, in so far as he\nconceives it to be missing, feel pain (III. xix.).  Q.E.D.\nNote.--This pain, in so far as it has reference to the absence\nof the object of love, is called Regret.\nPROP. XXXVII.  Desire arising through pain or pleasure, hatred or\nlove, is greater in proportion as the emotion is greater.\nProof.--Pain diminishes or constrains a man's power of\nactivity (III. xi. note), in other words (III. vii.), diminishes\nor constrains the effort, wherewith he endeavours to persist in\nhis own being; therefore (III. v.) it is contrary to the said\nendeavour: thus all the endeavours of a man affected by pain are\ndirected to removing that pain.  But (by the definition of pain),\nin proportion as the pain is greater, so also is it necessarily\nopposed to a greater part of man's power of activity; therefore\nthe greater the pain, the greater the power of activity employed\nto remove it; that is, the greater will be the desire or\nappetite in endeavouring to remove it.  Again, since pleasure\n(III. xi. note) increases or aids a man's power of activity, it\nmay easily be shown in like manner, that a man affected by\npleasure has no desire further than to preserve it, and his\ndesire will be in proportion to the magnitude of the pleasure.\nLastly, since hatred and love are themselves emotions of pain\nand pleasure, it follows in like manner that the endeavour,\nappetite, or desire, which arises through hatred or love, will be\ngreater in proportion to the hatred or love.  Q.E.D.\nPROP. XXXVIII.  If a man has begun to hate an object of his love,\nso that love is thoroughly destroyed, he will, causes being\nequal, regard it with more hatred than if he had never loved it,\nand his hatred will be in proportion to the strength of his\nformer love.\nProof.--If a man begins to hate that which he had loved, more\nof his appetites are put under restraint than if he had never\nloved it.  For love is a pleasure (III. xiii. note) which a man\nendeavours as far as he can to render permanent (III. xxviii.);\nhe does so by regarding the object of his love as present, and by\naffecting it as far as he can pleasurably; this endeavour is\ngreater in proportion as the love is greater, and so also is the\nendeavour to bring about that the beloved should return his\naffection (III. xxxiii.).  Now these endeavours are constrained\nby hatred towards the object of love (III. xiii. Coroll. and III.\nxxiii.); wherefore the lover (III. xi. note) will for this cause\nalso be affected with pain, the more so in proportion as his love\nhas been greater; that is, in addition to the pain caused by\nhatred, there is a pain caused by the fact that he has loved the\nobject; wherefore the lover will regard the beloved with greater\npain, or in other words, will hate it more than if he had never\nloved it, and with the more intensity in proportion as his former\nlove was greater.  Q.E.D.\nPROP. XXXIX.  He who hates anyone will endeavour to do him an\ninjury, unless he fears that a greater injury will thereby accrue\nto himself; on the other hand, he who loves anyone will, by the\nsame law, seek to benefit him.\nProof.--To hate a man is (III. xiii. note) to conceive him as\na cause of pain; therefore he who hates a man will endeavour to\nremove or destroy him.  But if anything more painful, or, in\nother words, a greater evil, should accrue to the hater\nthereby--and if the hater thinks he can avoid such evil by not\ncarrying out the injury, which he planned against the object of\nhis hate--he will desire to abstain from inflicting that injury\n(III. xxviii.), and the strength of his endeavour (III. xxxvii.)\nwill be greater than his former endeavour to do injury, and will\ntherefore prevail over it, as we asserted.  The second part of\nthis proof proceeds in the same manner.  Wherefore he who hates\nanother, etc.  Q.E.D.\nNote.--By good I here mean every kind of pleasure, and all\nthat conduces thereto, especially that which satisfies our\nlongings, whatsoever they may be.  By evil, I mean every kind of\npain, especially that which frustrates our longings.  For I have\nshown (III. ix. note) that we in no case desire a thing because\nwe deem it good, but, contrariwise, we deem a thing good because\nwe desire it: consequently we deem evil that which we shrink\nfrom; everyone, therefore, according to his particular emotions,\njudges or estimates what is good, what is bad, what is better,\nwhat is worse, lastly, what is best, and what is worst.  Thus a\nmiser thinks that abundance of money is the best, and want of\nmoney the worst; an ambitious man desires nothing so much as\nglory, and fears nothing so much as shame.  To an envious man\nnothing is more delightful than another's misfortune, and nothing\nmore painful than another's success.  So every man, according to\nhis emotions, judges a thing to be good or bad, useful or\nuseless.  The emotion, which induces a man to turn from that\nwhich he wishes, or to wish for that which he turns from, is\ncalled timidity, which may accordingly be defined as the fear\nwhereby a man is induced to avoid an evil which he regards as\nfuture by encountering a lesser evil (III. xxviii.).  But if the\nevil which he fears be shame, timidity becomes bashfulness.\nLastly, if the desire to avoid a future evil be checked by the\nfear of another evil, so that the man knows not which to choose,\nfear becomes consternation, especially if both the evils feared\nbe very great.\nPROP. XL.  He, who conceives himself to be hated by another, and\nbelieves that he has given him no cause for hatred, will hate\nthat other in return.\nProof.--He who conceives another as affected with hatred, will\nthereupon be affected himself with hatred (III. xxvii.), that is,\nwith pain, accompanied by the idea of an external cause.  But, by\nthe hypothesis, he conceives no cause for this pain except him\nwho is his enemy; therefore, from conceiving that he is hated by\nsome one, he will be affected with pain, accompanied by the idea\nof his enemy; in other words, he will hate his enemy in return.\nQ.E.D.\nNote.--He who thinks that he has given just cause for hatred\nwill (III. xxx. and note) be affected with shame; but this case\n(III. xxv.) rarely happens.  This reciprocation of hatred may\nalso arise from the hatred, which follows an endeavour to injure\nthe object of our hate (III. xxxix.).  He therefore who conceives\nthat he is hated by another will conceive his enemy as the cause\nof some evil or pain; thus he will be affected with pain or\nfear, accompanied by the idea of his enemy as cause; in other\nwords, he will be affected with hatred towards his enemy, as I\nsaid above.\nCorollary I.--He who conceives, that one whom he loves hates\nhim, will be a prey to conflicting hatred and love.  For, in so\nfar as he conceives that he is an object of hatred, he is\ndetermined to hate his enemy in return.  But, by the hypothesis,\nhe nevertheless loves him: wherefore he will be a prey to\nconflicting hatred and love.\nCorollary II.--If a man conceives that one, whom he has\nhitherto regarded without emotion, has done him any injury from\nmotives of hatred, he will forthwith seek to repay the injury in\nkind.\nProof.--He who conceives, that another hates him, will (by the\nlast proposition) hate his enemy in return, and (III. xxvi.) will\nendeavour to recall everything which can affect him painfully;\nhe will moreover endeavour to do him an injury (III. xxxix.).\nNow the first thing of this sort which he conceives is the injury\ndone to himself; he will, therefore, forthwith endeavour to\nrepay it in kind.  Q.E.D.\nNote.--The endeavour to injure one whom we hate is called\nAnger; the endeavour to repay in kind injury done to ourselves\nis called Revenge.\nPROP. XLI.  If anyone conceives that he is loved by another, and\nbelieves that he has given no cause for such love, he will love\nthat other in return.  (Cf. III. xv. Coroll., and III. xvi.)\nProof.--This proposition is proved in the same way as the\npreceding one.  See also the note appended thereto.\nNote.--If he believes that he has given just cause for the\nlove, he will take pride therein (III. xxx. and note); this is\nwhat most often happens (III. xxv.), and we said that its\ncontrary took place whenever a man conceives himself to be hated\nby another.  (See note to preceding proposition.)  This\nreciprocal love, and consequently the desire of benefiting him\nwho loves us (III. xxxix.), and who endeavours to benefit us, is\ncalled gratitude or thankfulness.  It thus appears that men are\nmuch more prone to take vengeance than to return benefits.\nCorollary.--He who imagines that he is loved by one whom he\nhates, will be a prey to conflicting hatred and love.  This is\nproved in the same way as the first corollary of the preceding\nproposition.\nNote.--If hatred be the prevailing emotion, he will endeavour\nto injure him who loves him; this emotion is called cruelty,\nespecially if the victim be believed to have given no ordinary\ncause for hatred.\nPROP. XLII.  He who has conferred a benefit on anyone from\nmotives of love or honour will feel pain, if he sees that the\nbenefit is received without gratitude.\nProof.--When a man loves something similar to himself, he\nendeavours, as far as he can, to bring it about that he should be\nloved thereby in return (III. xxxiii.).  Therefore he who has\nconferred a benefit confers it in obedience to the desire, which\nhe feels of being loved in return; that is (III. xxxiv.) from\nthe hope of honour or (III. xxx. note) pleasure; hence he will\nendeavour, as far as he can, to conceive this cause of honour, or\nto regard it as actually existing.  But, by the hypothesis, he\nconceives something else, which excludes the existence of the\nsaid cause of honour: wherefore he will thereat feel pain (III.\nxix.).  Q.E.D.\nPROP. XLIII.  Hatred is increased by being reciprocated, and can\non the other hand be destroyed by love.\nProof.--He who conceives, that an object of his hatred hates\nhim in return, will thereupon feel a new hatred, while the former\nhatred (by hypothesis) still remains (III. xl.).  But if, on the\nother hand, he conceives that the object of hate loves him, he\nwill to this extent (III. xxxviii.) regard himself with pleasure,\nand (III. xxix.) will endeavour to please the cause of his\nemotion.  In other words, he will endeavour not to hate him (III.\nxli.), and not to affect him painfully; this endeavour (III.\nxxxvii.) will be greater or less in proportion to the emotion\nfrom which it arises.  Therefore, if it be greater than that\nwhich arises from hatred, and through which the man endeavours to\naffect painfully the thing which he hates, it will get the better\nof it and banish the hatred from his mind.  Q.E.D.\nPROP. XLIV.  Hatred which is completely vanquished by love passes\ninto love: and love is thereupon greater than if hatred had not\npreceded it.\nProof.--The proof proceeds in the same way as Prop. xxxviii.\nof this Part: for he who begins to love a thing, which he was\nwont to hate or regard with pain, from the very fact of loving\nfeels pleasure.  To this pleasure involved in love is added the\npleasure arising from aid given to the endeavour to remove the\npain involved in hatred (III. xxxvii.), accompanied by the idea\nof the former object of hatred as cause.\nNote.--Though this be so, no one will endeavour to hate\nanything, or to be affected with pain, for the sake of enjoying\nthis greater pleasure; that is, no one will desire that he\nshould be injured, in the hope of recovering from the injury, nor\nlong to be ill for the sake of getting well.  For everyone will\nalways endeavour to persist in his being, and to ward off pain as\nfar as he can.  If the contrary is conceivable, namely, that a\nman should desire to hate someone, in order that he might love\nhim the more thereafter, he will always desire to hate him.  For\nthe strength of love is in proportion to the strength of the\nhatred, wherefore the man would desire, that the hatred be\ncontinually increased more and more, and, for a similar reason,\nhe would desire to become more and more ill, in order that he\nmight take a greater pleasure in being restored to health: in\nsuch a case he would always endeavour to be ill, which (III. vi.)\nis absurd.\nPROP. XLV.  If a man conceives, that anyone similar to himself\nhates anything also similar to himself, which he loves, he will\nhate that person.\nProof.--The beloved object feels reciprocal hatred towards him\nwho hates it (III. xl.); therefore the lover, in conceiving that\nanyone hates the beloved object, conceives the beloved thing as\naffected by hatred, in other words (III. xiii.), by pain;\nconsequently he is himself affected by pain accompanied by the\nidea of the hater of the beloved thing as cause; that is, he\nwill hate him who hates anything which he himself loves (III.\nxiii. note).  Q.E.D.\nPROP. XLVI.  If a man has been affected pleasurably or painfully\nby anyone, of a class or nation different from his own, and if\nthe pleasure or pain has been accompanied by the idea of the said\nstranger as cause, under the general category of the class or\nnation: the man will feel love or hatred, not only to the\nindividual stranger, but also to the whole class or nation\nwhereto he belongs.\nProof.--This is evident from III. xvi.\nPROP. XLVII.  Joy arising from the fact, that anything we hate is\ndestroyed, or suffers other injury, is never unaccompanied by a\ncertain pain in us.\nProof.--This is evident from III. xxvii.  For in so far as we\nconceive a thing similar to ourselves to be affected with pain,\nwe ourselves feel pain.\nNote.--This proposition can also be proved from the Corollary\nto II. xvii.  Whenever we remember anything, even if it does not\nactually exist, we regard it only as present, and the body is\naffected in the same manner; wherefore, in so far as the\nremembrance of the thing is strong, a man is determined to regard\nit with pain; this determination, while the image of the thing\nin question lasts, is indeed checked by the remembrance of other\nthings excluding the existence of the aforesaid thing, but is not\ndestroyed: hence, a man only feels pleasure in so far as the\nsaid determination is checked: for this reason the joy arising\nfrom the injury done to what we hate is repeated, every time we\nremember that object of hatred.  For, as we have said, when the\nimage of the thing in question, is aroused, inasmuch as it\ninvolves the thing's existence, it determines the man to regard\nthe thing with the same pain as he was wont to do, when it\nactually did exist.  However, since he has joined to the image of\nthe thing other images, which exclude its existence, this\ndetermination to pain is forthwith checked, and the man rejoices\nafresh as often as the repetition takes place.  This is the cause\nof men's pleasure in recalling past evils, and delight in\nnarrating dangers from which they have escaped.  For when men\nconceive a danger, they conceive it as still future, and are\ndetermined to fear it; this determination is checked afresh by\nthe idea of freedom, which became associated with the idea of the\ndanger when they escaped therefrom: this renders them secure\nafresh: therefore they rejoice afresh.\nPROP. XLVIII.  Love or hatred towards, for instance, Peter is\ndestroyed, if the pleasure involved in the former, or the pain\ninvolved in the latter emotion, be associated with the idea of\nanother cause: and will be diminished in proportion as we\nconceive Peter not to have been the sole cause of either emotion.\nProof.--This Prop. is evident from the mere definition of love\nand hatred (III. xiii. note).  For pleasure is called love\ntowards Peter, and pain is called hatred towards Peter, simply in\nso far as Peter is regarded as the cause of one emotion or the\nother.  When this condition of causality is either wholly or\npartly removed, the emotion towards Peter also wholly or in part\nvanishes.  Q.E.D.\nPROP. XLIX.  Love or hatred towards a thing, which we conceive to\nbe free, must, other conditions being similar, be greater than if\nit were felt towards a thing acting by necessity.\nProof.--A thing which we conceive as free must (I. Def. vii.)\nbe perceived through itself without anything else.  If,\ntherefore, we conceive it as the cause of pleasure or pain, we\nshall therefore (III. xiii. note) love it or hate it, and shall\ndo so with the utmost love or hatred that can arise from the\ngiven emotion.  But if the thing which causes the emotion be\nconceived as acting by necessity, we shall then (by the same Def.\nvii. Part I.) conceive it not as the sole cause, but as one of\nthe causes of the emotion, and therefore our love or hatred\ntowards it will be less.  Q.E.D.\nNote.--Hence it follows, that men, thinking themselves to be\nfree, feel more love or hatred towards one another than towards\nanything else: to this consideration we must add the imitation\nof emotions treated of in III. xxvii., xxxiv., xl. and xliii.\nPROP. L.  Anything whatever can be, accidentally, a cause of hope\nor fear.\nProof.--This proposition is proved in the same way as III.\nxv., which see, together with the note to III. xviii.\nNote.--Things which are accidentally the causes of hope or\nfear are called good or evil omens.  Now, in so far as such omens\nare the cause of hope or fear, they are (by the definitions of\nhope and fear given in III. xviii. note) the causes also of\npleasure and pain; consequently we, to this extent, regard them\nwith love or hatred, and endeavour either to invoke them as means\ntowards that which we hope for, or to remove them as obstacles,\nor causes of that which we fear.  It follows, further, from III.\nxxv., that we are naturally so constituted as to believe readily\nin that which we hope for, and with difficulty in that which we\nfear; moreover, we are apt to estimate such objects above or\nbelow their true value.  Hence there have arisen superstitions,\nwhereby men are everywhere assailed.  However, I do not think it\nworth while to point out here the vacillations springing from\nhope and fear; it follows from the definition of these emotions,\nthat there can be no hope without fear, and no fear without hope,\nas I will duly explain in the proper place.  Further, in so far\nas we hope for or fear anything, we regard it with love or hatred;\nthus everyone can apply by himself to hope and fear what we\nhave said concerning love and hatred.\nPROP. LI.  Different men may be differently affected by the same\nobject, and the same man may be differently affected at different\ntimes by the same object.\nProof.--The human body is affected by external bodies in a\nvariety of ways (II. Post. iii.).  Two men may therefore be\ndifferently affected at the same time, and therefore (by Ax. i.\nafter Lemma iii. after II. xiii.) may be differently affected by\none and the same object.  Further (by the same Post.) the human\nbody can be affected sometimes in one way, sometimes in another;\nconsequently (by the same Axiom) it may be differently affected\nat different times by one and the same object.  Q.E.D.\nNote.--We thus see that it is possible, that what one man\nloves another may hate, and that what one man fears another may\nnot fear; or, again, that one and the same man may love what he\nonce hated, or may be bold where he once was timid, and so on.\nAgain, as everyone judges according to his emotions what is good,\nwhat bad, what better, and what worse (III. xxxix. note), it\nfollows that men's judgments may vary no less than their\nemotions[10], hence when we compare some with others, we\ndistinguish them solely by the diversity of their emotions, and\nstyle some intrepid, others timid, others by some other epithet.\nFor instance, I shall call a man intrepid, if he despises an evil\nwhich I am accustomed to fear; if I further take into\nconsideration, that, in his desire to injure his enemies and to\nbenefit those whom he loves, he is not restrained by the fear of\nan evil which is sufficient to restrain me, I shall call him\ndaring.  Again, a man will appear timid to me, if he fears an\nevil which I am accustomed to despise; and if I further take\ninto consideration that his desire is restrained by the fear of\nan evil, which is not sufficient to restrain me, I shall say that\nhe is cowardly; and in like manner will everyone pass judgment.\n[10] This is possible, though the human mind is part of the divine\nintellect, as I have shown in II. xiii. note.\nLastly, from this inconstancy in the nature of human\njudgment, inasmuch as a man often judges things solely by his\nemotions, and inasmuch as the things which he believes cause\npleasure or pain, and therefore endeavours to promote or prevent,\nare often purely imaginary, not to speak of the uncertainty of\nthings alluded to in III. xxviii.; we may readily conceive that\na man may be at one time affected with pleasure, and at another\nwith pain, accompanied by the idea of himself as cause.  Thus we\ncan easily understand what are Repentance and Self--complacency.\nRepentance is pain, accompanied by the idea of one's self as\ncause; Self--complacency is pleasure, accompanied by the idea of\none's self as cause, and these emotions are most intense because\nmen believe themselves to be free (III. xlix.).\nPROP. LII.  An object which we have formerly seen in conjunction\nwith others, and which we do not conceive to have any property\nthat is not common to many, will not be regarded by us for so\nlong, as an object which we conceive to have some property\npeculiar to itself.\nProof.--As soon as we conceive an object which we have seen in\nconjunction with others, we at once remember those others (II.\nxviii. and note), and thus we pass forthwith from the\ncontemplation of one object to the contemplation of another\nobject.  And this is the case with the object, which we conceive\nto have no property that is not common to many.  For we thereupon\nassume that we are regarding therein nothing, which we have not\nbefore seen in conjunction with other objects.  But when we\nsuppose that we conceive an object something special, which we\nhave never seen before, we must needs say that the mind, while\nregarding that object, has in itself nothing which it can fall to\nregarding instead thereof; therefore it is determined to the\ncontemplation of that object only.  Therefore an object, &c.\nQ.E.D.\nNote.--This mental modification, or imagination of a\nparticular thing, in so far as it is alone in the mind, is called\nWonder; but if it be excited by an object of fear, it is called\nConsternation, because wonder at an evil keeps a man so engrossed\nin the simple contemplation thereof, that he has no power to\nthink of anything else whereby he might avoid the evil.  If,\nhowever, the object of wonder be a man's prudence, industry, or\nanything of that sort, inasmuch as the said man, is thereby\nregarded as far surpassing ourselves, wonder is called Veneration;\notherwise, if a man's anger, envy, &c., be what we wonder at,\nthe emotion is called Horror.  Again, if it be the prudence,\nindustry, or what not, of a man we love, that we wonder at, our\nlove will on this account be the greater (III. xii.), and when\njoined to wonder or veneration is called Devotion.  We may in\nlike manner conceive hatred, hope, confidence, and the other\nemotions, as associated with wonder; and we should thus be able\nto deduce more emotions than those which have obtained names in\nordinary speech.  Whence it is evident, that the names of the\nemotions have been applied in accordance rather with their\nordinary manifestations than with an accurate knowledge of their\nnature.\nTo wonder is opposed Contempt, which generally arises from\nthe fact that, because we see someone wondering at, loving, or\nfearing something, or because something, at first sight, appears\nto be like things, which we ourselves wonder at, love, fear, &c.,\nwe are, in consequence (III. xv. Coroll. and III. xxvii.),\ndetermined to wonder at, love, or fear that thing.  But if from\nthe presence, or more accurate contemplation of the said thing,\nwe are compelled to deny concerning it all that can be the cause\nof wonder, love, fear, &c., the mind then, by the presence of the\nthing, remains determined to think rather of those qualities\nwhich are not in it, than of those which are in it; whereas, on\nthe other hand, the presence of the object would cause it more\nparticularly to regard that which is therein.  As devotion\nsprings from wonder at a thing which we love, so does Derision\nspring from contempt of a thing which we hate or fear, and Scorn\nfrom contempt of folly, as veneration from wonder at prudence.\nLastly, we can conceive the emotions of love, hope, honour, &c.,\nin association with contempt, and can thence deduce other\nemotions, which are not distinguished one from another by any\nrecognized name.\nPROP. LIII.  When the mind regards itself and its own power of\nactivity, it feels pleasure: and that pleasure is greater in\nproportion to the distinctness wherewith it conceives itself and\nits own power of activity.\nProof.--A man does not know himself except through the\nmodifications of his body, and the ideas thereof (II. xix. and\nxxiii.).  When, therefore, the mind is able to contemplate\nitself, it is thereby assumed to pass to a greater perfection, or\n(III. xi. note) to feel pleasure; and the pleasure will be\ngreater in proportion to the distinctness, wherewith it is able\nto conceive itself and its own power of activity.  Q.E.D.\nCorollary.--This pleasure is fostered more and more, in\nproportion as a man conceives himself to be praised by others.\nFor the more he conceives himself as praised by others, the more\nhe will imagine them to be affected with pleasure, accompanied by\nthe idea of himself (III. xxix. note); thus he is (III. xxvii.)\nhimself affected with greater pleasure, accompanied by the idea\nof himself.  Q.E.D.\nPROP. LIV. The mind endeavours to conceive only such things as\nassert its power of activity.\nProof.--The endeavour or power of the mind is the actual\nessence thereof (III. vii.); but the essence of the mind\nobviously only affirms that which the mind is and can do; not\nthat which it neither is nor can do; therefore the mind\nendeavours to conceive only such things as assert or affirm its\npower of activity.  Q.E.D.\nPROP. LV.  When the mind contemplates its own weakness, it feels\npain thereat.\nProof.--The essence of the mind only affirms that which the\nmind is, or can do; in other words, it is the mind's nature to\nconceive only such things as assert its power of activity (last\nProp.).  Thus, when we say that the mind contemplates its own\nweakness, we are merely saying that while the mind is attempting\nto conceive something which asserts its power of activity, it is\nchecked in its endeavour----in other words (III. xi. note), it\nfeels pain.  Q.E.D.\nCorollary.--This pain is more and more fostered, if a man\nconceives that he is blamed by others; this may be proved in the\nsame way as the corollary to III. liii.\nNote.--This pain, accompanied by the idea of our own weakness,\nis called humility; the pleasure, which springs from the\ncontemplation of ourselves, is called self--love or\nself--complacency.  And inasmuch as this feeling is renewed as\noften as a man contemplates his own virtues, or his own power of\nactivity, it follows that everyone is fond of narrating his own\nexploits, and displaying the force both of his body and mind, and\nalso that, for this reason, men are troublesome to one another.\nAgain, it follows that men are naturally envious (III. xxiv.\nnote, and III. xxxii. note), rejoicing in the shortcomings of\ntheir equals, and feeling pain at their virtues.  For whenever a\nman conceives his own actions, he is affected with pleasure (III.\nliii.), in proportion as his actions display more perfection, and\nhe conceives them more distinctly--that is (II. xl. note), in\nproportion as he can distinguish them from others, and regard\nthem as something special.  Therefore, a man will take most\npleasure in contemplating himself, when he contemplates some\nquality which he denies to others.  But, if that which he affirms\nof himself be attributable to the idea of man or animals in\ngeneral, he will not be so greatly pleased: he will, on the\ncontrary, feel pain, if he conceives that his own actions fall\nshort when compared with those of others.  This pain (III.\nxxviii.) he will endeavour to remove, by putting a wrong\nconstruction on the actions of his equals, or by, as far as he\ncan, embellishing his own.\nIt is thus apparent that men are naturally prone to hatred\nand envy, which latter is fostered by their education.  For\nparents are accustomed to incite their children to virtue solely\nby the spur of honour and envy.  But, perhaps, some will scruple\nto assent to what I have said, because we not seldom admire men's\nvirtues, and venerate their possessors.  In order to remove such\ndoubts, I append the following corollary.\nCorollary.--No one envies the virtue of anyone who is not his\nequal.\nProof.--Envy is a species of hatred (III. xxiv. note) or (III.\nxiii. note) pain, that is (III. xi. note), a modification whereby\na man's power of activity, or endeavour towards activity, is\nchecked.  But a man does not endeavour or desire to do anything,\nwhich cannot follow from his nature as it is given; therefore a\nman will not desire any power of activity or virtue (which is the\nsame thing) to be attributed to him, that is appropriate to\nanother's nature and foreign to his own; hence his desire cannot\nbe checked, nor he himself pained by the contemplation of virtue\nin some one unlike himself, consequently he cannot envy such an\none.  But he can envy his equal, who is assumed to have the same\nnature as himself.  Q.E.D.\nNote.--When, therefore, as we said in the note to III. lii.,\nwe venerate a man, through wonder at his prudence, fortitude,\n&c., we do so, because we conceive those qualities to be peculiar\nto him, and not as common to our nature; we, therefore, no more\nenvy their possessor, than we envy trees for being tall, or lions\nfor being courageous.\nPROP. LVI.  There are as many kinds of pleasure, of pain, of\ndesire, and of every emotion compounded of these, such as\nvacillations of spirit, or derived from these, such as love,\nhatred, hope, fear, &c., as there are kinds of objects whereby we\nare affected.\nProof.--Pleasure and pain, and consequently the emotions\ncompounded thereof, or derived therefrom, are passions, or\npassive states (III. xi. note); now we are necessarily passive\n(III. i.), in so far as we have inadequate ideas; and only in so\nfar as we have such ideas are we passive (III. iii.); that is,\nwe are only necessarily passive (II. xl. note), in so far as we\nconceive, or (II. xvii. and note) in so far as we are affected by\nan emotion, which involves the nature of our own body, and the\nnature of an external body.  Wherefore the nature of every\npassive state must necessarily be so explained, that the nature\nof the object whereby we are affected be expressed.  Namely, the\npleasure, which arises from, say, the object A, involves the\nnature of that object A, and the pleasure, which arises from the\nobject B, involves the nature of the object B; wherefore these\ntwo pleasurable emotions are by nature different, inasmuch as the\ncauses whence they arise are by nature different.  So again the\nemotion of pain, which arises from one object, is by nature\ndifferent from the pain arising from another object, and,\nsimilarly, in the case of love, hatred, hope, fear, vacillation,\n&c.\nThus, there are necessarily as many kinds of pleasure, pain,\nlove, hatred, &c., as there are kinds of objects whereby we are\naffected.  Now desire is each man's essence or nature, in so far\nas it is conceived as determined to a particular action by any\ngiven modification of itself (III. ix. note); therefore,\naccording as a man is affected through external causes by this or\nthat kind of pleasure, pain, love, hatred, &c., in other words,\naccording as his nature is disposed in this or that manner, so\nwill his desire be of one kind or another, and the nature of one\ndesire must necessarily differ from the nature of another desire,\nas widely as the emotions differ, wherefrom each desire arose.\nThus there are as many kinds of desire, as there are kinds of\npleasure, pain, love, &c., consequently (by what has been shown)\nthere are as many kinds of desire, as there are kinds of objects\nwhereby we are affected.  Q.E.D.\nNote.--Among the kinds of emotions, which, by the last\nproposition, must be very numerous, the chief are luxury,\ndrunkenness, lust, avarice, and ambition, being merely species of\nlove or desire, displaying the nature of those emotions in a\nmanner varying according to the object, with which they are\nconcerned.  For by luxury, drunkenness, lust, avarice, ambition,\n&c., we simply mean the immoderate love of feasting, drinking,\nvenery, riches, and fame.  Furthermore, these emotions, in so far\nas we distinguish them from others merely by the objects\nwherewith they are concerned, have no contraries.  For\ntemperance, sobriety, and chastity, which we are wont to oppose\nto luxury, drunkenness, and lust, are not emotions or passive\nstates, but indicate a power of the mind which moderates the\nlast--named emotions.  However, I cannot here explain the\nremaining kinds of emotions (seeing that they are as numerous as\nthe kinds of objects), nor, if I could, would it be necessary.\nIt is sufficient for our purpose, namely, to determine the\nstrength of the emotions, and the mind's power over them, to have\na general definition of each emotion.  It is sufficient, I\nrepeat, to understand the general properties of the emotions and\nthe mind, to enable us to determine the quality and extent of the\nmind's power in moderating and checking the emotions.  Thus,\nthough there is a great difference between various emotions of\nlove, hatred, or desire, for instance between love felt towards\nchildren, and love felt towards a wife, there is no need for us\nto take cognizance of such differences, or to track out further\nthe nature and origin of the emotions.\nPROP. LVII.  Any emotion of a given individual differs from the\nemotion of another individual, only in so far as the essence of\nthe one individual differs from the essence of the other.\nProof.--This proposition is evident from Ax. i. (which see\nafter Lemma iii. Prop. xiii., Part II.).  Nevertheless, we will\nprove it from the nature of the three primary emotions.\nAll emotions are attributable to desire, pleasure, or pain,\nas their definitions above given show.  But desire is each man's\nnature or essence (III. ix. note); therefore desire in one\nindividual differs from desire in another individual, only in so\nfar as the nature or essence of the one differs from the nature\nor essence of the other.  Again, pleasure and pain are passive\nstates or passions, whereby every man's power or endeavour to\npersist in his being is increased or diminished, helped or\nhindered (III. xi. and note).  But by the endeavour to persist in\nits being, in so far as it is attributable to mind and body in\nconjunction, we mean appetite and desire (III. ix. note);\ntherefore pleasure and pain are identical with desire or\nappetite, in so far as by external causes they are increased or\ndiminished, helped or hindered, in other words, they are every\nman's nature; wherefore the pleasure and pain felt by one man\ndiffer from the pleasure and pain felt by another man, only in so\nfar as the nature or essence of the one man differs from the\nessence of the other; consequently, any emotion of one\nindividual only differs, &c.  Q.E.D.\nNote.--Hence it follows, that the emotions of the animals\nwhich are called irrational (for after learning the origin of\nmind we cannot doubt that brutes feel) only differ from man's\nemotions, to the extent that brute nature differs from human\nnature.  Horse and man are alike carried away by the desire of\nprocreation; but the desire of the former is equine, the desire\nof the latter is human.  So also the lusts and appetites of\ninsects, fishes, and birds must needs vary according to the\nseveral natures.  Thus, although each individual lives content\nand rejoices in that nature belonging to him wherein he has his\nbeing, yet the life, wherein each is content and rejoices, is\nnothing else but the idea, or soul, of the said individual, and\nhence the joy of one only differs in nature from the joy of\nanother, to the extent that the essence of one differs from the\nessence of another.  Lastly, it follows from the foregoing\nproposition, that there is no small difference between the joy\nwhich actuates, say, a drunkard, and the joy possessed by a\nphilosopher, as I just mention here by the way.  Thus far I have\ntreated of the emotions attributable to man, in so far as he is\npassive.  It remains to add a few words on those attributable to\nhim in so far as he is active.\nPROP. LVIII.  Besides pleasure and desire, which are passivities\nor passions, there are other emotions derived from pleasure and\ndesire, which are attributable to us in so far as we are active.\nProof.--When the mind conceives itself and its power of\nactivity, it feels pleasure (III. liii.): now the mind\nnecessarily contemplates itself, when it conceives a true or\nadequate idea (II. xliii.).  But the mind does conceive certain\nadequate ideas (II. xl. note 2.).  Therefore it feels pleasure in\nso far as it conceives adequate ideas; that is, in so far as it\nis active (III. i.).  Again, the mind, both in so far as it has\nclear and distinct ideas, and in so far as it has confused ideas,\nendeavours to persist in its own being (III. ix.); but by such\nan endeavour we mean desire (by the note to the same Prop.);\ntherefore, desire is also attributable to us, in so far as we\nunderstand, or (III. i.) in so far as we are active.  Q.E.D.\nPROP. LIX.  Among all the emotions attributable to the mind as\nactive, there are none which cannot be referred to pleasure or\ndesire.\nProof.--All emotions can be referred to desire, pleasure, or\npain, as their definitions, already given, show.  Now by pain we\nmean that the mind's power of thinking is diminished or checked\n(III. xi. and note); therefore, in so far as the mind feels\npain, its power of understanding, that is, of activity, is\ndiminished or checked (III. i.); therefore, no painful emotions\ncan be attributed to the mind in virtue of its being active, but\nonly emotions of pleasure and desire, which (by the last Prop.)\nare attributable to the mind in that condition.  Q.E.D.\nNote.--All actions following from emotion, which are\nattributable to the mind in virtue of its understanding, I set\ndown to strength of character (fortitudo), which I divide into\ncourage (animositas) and highmindedness (generositas).  By\ncourage I mean the desire whereby every man strives to preserve\nhis own being in accordance solely with the dictates of reason.\nBy highmindedness I mean the desire whereby every man endeavours,\nsolely under the dictates of reason, to aid other men and to\nunite them to himself in friendship.  Those actions, therefore,\nwhich have regard solely to the good of the agent I set down to\ncourage, those which aim at the good of others I set down to\nhighmindedness.  Thus temperance, sobriety, and presence of mind\nin danger, &c., are varieties of courage; courtesy, mercy, &c.,\nare varieties of highmindedness.\nI think I have thus explained, and displayed through their\nprimary causes the principal emotions and vacillations of spirit,\nwhich arise from the combination of the three primary emotions,\nto wit, desire, pleasure, and pain.  It is evident from what I\nhave said, that we are in many ways driven about by external\ncauses, and that like waves of the sea driven by contrary winds\nwe toss to and fro unwitting of the issue and of our fate.  But I\nhave said, that I have only set forth the chief conflicting\nemotions, not all that might be given.  For, by proceeding in the\nsame way as above, we can easily show that love is united to\nrepentance, scorn, shame, &c.  I think everyone will agree from\nwhat has been said, that the emotions may be compounded one with\nanother in so many ways, and so many variations may arise\ntherefrom, as to exceed all possibility of computation.  However,\nfor my purpose, it is enough to have enumerated the most\nimportant; to reckon up the rest which I have omitted would be\nmore curious than profitable.  It remains to remark concerning\nlove, that it very often happens that while we are enjoying a\nthing which we longed for, the body, from the act of enjoyment,\nacquires a new disposition, whereby it is determined in another\nway, other images of things are aroused in it, and the mind\nbegins to conceive and desire something fresh.  For example, when\nwe conceive something which generally delights us with its\nflavour, we desire to enjoy, that is, to eat it.  But whilst we\nare thus enjoying it, the stomach is filled and the body is\notherwise disposed.  If, therefore, when the body is thus\notherwise disposed, the image of the food which is present be\nstimulated, and consequently the endeavour or desire to eat it be\nstimulated also, the new disposition of the body will feel\nrepugnance to the desire or attempt, and consequently the\npresence of the food which we formerly longed for will become\nodious.  This revulsion of feeling is called satiety or\nweariness.  For the rest, I have neglected the outward\nmodifications of the body observable in emotions, such, for\ninstance, as trembling, pallor, sobbing, laughter, &c., for these\nare attributable to the body only, without any reference to the\nmind.  Lastly, the definitions of the emotions require to be\nsupplemented in a few points; I will therefore repeat them,\ninterpolating such observations as I think should here and there\nbe added.\nDEFINITIONS OF THE EMOTIONS\nI.  Desire is the actual essence of man, in so far as it is\nconceived, as determined to a particular activity by some given\nmodification of itself.\nExplanation.--We have said above, in the note to Prop. ix. of\nthis part, that desire is appetite, with consciousness thereof;\nfurther, that appetite is the essence of man, in so far as it is\ndetermined to act in a way tending to promote its own\npersistence.  But, in the same note, I also remarked that,\nstrictly speaking, I recognize no distinction between appetite\nand desire.  For whether a man be conscious of his appetite or\nnot, it remains one and the same appetite.  Thus, in order to\navoid the appearance of tautology, I have refrained from\nexplaining desire by appetite; but I have take care to define it\nin such a manner, as to comprehend, under one head, all those\nendeavours of human nature, which we distinguish by the terms\nappetite, will, desire, or impulse.  I might, indeed, have said,\nthat desire is the essence of man, in so far as it is conceived\nas determined to a particular activity; but from such a\ndefinition (cf. II. xxiii.) it would not follow that the mind can\nbe conscious of its desire or appetite.  Therefore, in order to\nimply the cause of such consciousness, it was necessary to add,\nin so far as it is determined by some given modification, &c.\nFor, by a modification of man's essence, we understand every\ndisposition of the said essence, whether such disposition be\ninnate, or whether it be conceived solely under the attribute of\nthought, or solely under the attribute of extension, or whether,\nlastly, it be referred simultaneously to both these attributes.\nBy the term desire, then, I here mean all man's endeavours,\nimpulses, appetites, and volitions, which vary according to each\nman's disposition, and are, therefore, not seldom opposed one to\nanother, according as a man is drawn in different directions, and\nknows not where to turn.\nII.  Pleasure is the transition of a man from a less to a greater\nperfection.\nIII.  Pain is the transition of a man from a greater to a less\nperfection.\nExplanation--I say transition: for pleasure is not perfection\nitself.  For, if man were born with the perfection to which he\npasses, he would possess the same, without the emotion of\npleasure.  This appears more clearly from the consideration of\nthe contrary emotion, pain.  No one can deny, that pain consists\nin the transition to a less perfection, and not in the less\nperfection itself: for a man cannot be pained, in so far as he\npartakes of perfection of any degree.  Neither can we say, that\npain consists in the absence of a greater perfection.  For\nabsence is nothing, whereas the emotion of pain is an activity;\nwherefore this activity can only be the activity of transition\nfrom a greater to a less perfection--in other words, it is an\nactivity whereby a man's power of action is lessened or\nconstrained (cf. III. xi. note).  I pass over the definitions of\nmerriment, stimulation, melancholy, and grief, because these\nterms are generally used in reference to the body, and are merely\nkinds of pleasure or pain.\nIV.  Wonder is the conception (imaginatio) of anything, wherein\nthe mind comes to a stand, because the particular concept in\nquestion has no connection with other concepts (cf. III. lii. and\nnote).\nExplanation--In the note to II. xviii. we showed the reason,\nwhy the mind, from the contemplation of one thing, straightway\nfalls to the contemplation of another thing, namely, because the\nimages of the two things are so associated and arranged, that one\nfollows the other.  This state of association is impossible, if\nthe image of the thing be new; the mind will then be at a stand\nin the contemplation thereof, until it is determined by other\ncauses to think of something else.\nThus the conception of a new object, considered in itself, is\nof the same nature as other conceptions; hence, I do not include\nwonder among the emotions, nor do I see why I should so include\nit, inasmuch as this distraction of the mind arises from no\npositive cause drawing away the mind from other objects, but\nmerely from the absence of a cause, which should determine the\nmind to pass from the contemplation of one object to the\ncontemplation of another.\nI, therefore, recognize only three primitive or primary\nemotions (as I said in the note to III. xi.), namely, pleasure,\npain, and desire.  I have spoken of wonder simply because it is\ncustomary to speak of certain emotions springing from the three\nprimitive ones by different names, when they are referred to the\nobjects of our wonder.  I am led by the same motive to add a\ndefinition of contempt.\nV.  Contempt is the conception of anything which touches the mind\nso little, that its presence leads the mind to imagine those\nqualities which are not in it rather than such as are in it (cf.\nIII. lii. note).\nThe definitions of veneration and scorn I here pass over, for\nI am not aware that any emotions are named after them.\nVI.  Love is pleasure, accompanied by the idea of an external\ncause.\nExplanation--This definition explains sufficiently clearly the\nessence of love; the definition given by those authors who say\nthat love is the lover's wish to unite himself to the loved\nobject expresses a property, but not the essence of love; and,\nas such authors have not sufficiently discerned love's essence,\nthey have been unable to acquire a true conception of its\nproperties, accordingly their definition is on all hands admitted\nto be very obscure.  It must, however, be noted, that when I say\nthat it is a property of love, that the lover should wish to\nunite himself to the beloved object, I do not here mean by wish\nconsent, or conclusion, or a free decision of the mind (for I\nhave shown such, in II. xlviii., to be fictitious); neither do I\nmean a desire of being united to the loved object when it is\nabsent, or of continuing in its presence when it is at hand; for\nlove can be conceived without either of these desires; but by\nwish I mean the contentment, which is in the lover, on account of\nthe presence of the beloved object, whereby the pleasure of the\nlover is strengthened, or at least maintained.\nVII.  Hatred is pain, accompanied by the idea of an external\ncause.\nExplanation--These observations are easily grasped after what\nhas been said in the explanation of the preceding definition (cf.\nalso III. xiii. note).\nVIII.  Inclination is pleasure, accompanied by the idea of\nsomething which is accidentally a cause of pleasure.\nIX.  Aversion is pain, accompanied by the idea of something which\nis accidentally the cause of pain (cf. III. xv. note).\nX.  Devotion is love towards one whom we admire.\nExplanation--Wonder (admiratio) arises (as we have shown, III.\nlii.) from the novelty of a thing.  If, therefore, it happens\nthat the object of our wonder is often conceived by us, we shall\ncease to wonder at it; thus we see, that the emotion of devotion\nreadily degenerates into simple love.\nXI.  Derision is pleasure arising from our conceiving the\npresence of a quality, which we despise, in an object which we\nhate.\nExplanation--In so far as we despise a thing which we hate, we\ndeny existence thereof (III. lii. note), and to that extent\nrejoice (III. xx.).  But since we assume that man hates that\nwhich he derides, it follows that the pleasure in question is not\nwithout alloy (cf. III. xlvii. note).\nXII.  Hope is an inconstant pleasure, arising from the idea of\nsomething past or future, whereof we to a certain extent doubt\nthe issue.\nXIII.  Fear is an inconstant pain arising from the idea of\nsomething past or future, whereof we to a certain extent doubt\nthe issue (cf. III. xviii. note).\nExplanation--From these definitions it follows, that there is\nno hope unmingled with fear, and no fear unmingled with hope.\nFor he, who depends on hope and doubts concerning the issue of\nanything, is assumed to conceive something, which excludes the\nexistence of the said thing in the future; therefore he, to this\nextent, feels pain (cf. III. xix.); consequently, while\ndependent on hope, he fears for the issue.  Contrariwise he, who\nfears, in other words doubts, concerning the issue of something\nwhich he hates, also conceives something which excludes the\nexistence of the thing in question; to this extent he feels\npleasure, and consequently to this extent he hopes that it will\nturn out as he desires (III. xx.).\nXIV.  Confidence is pleasure arising from the idea of something\npast or future, wherefrom all cause of doubt has been removed.\nXV.  Despair is pain arising from the idea of something past or\nfuture, wherefrom all cause of doubt has been removed.\nExplanation--Thus confidence springs from hope, and despair\nfrom fear, when all cause for doubt as to the issue of an event\nhas been removed: this comes to pass, because man conceives\nsomething past or future as present and regards it as such, or\nelse because he conceives other things, which exclude the\nexistence of the causes of his doubt.  For, although we can never\nbe absolutely certain of the issue of any particular event (II.\nxxxi. Coroll.), it may nevertheless happen that we feel no doubt\nconcerning it.  For we have shown, that to feel no doubt\nconcerning a thing is not the same as to be quite certain of it\n(II. xlix. note).  Thus it may happen that we are affected by the\nsame emotion of pleasure or pain concerning a thing past or\nfuture, as concerning the conception of a thing present; this I\nhave already shown in III. xviii., to which, with its note, I\nrefer the reader.\nXVI.  Joy is pleasure accompanied by the idea of something past,\nwhich has had an issue beyond our hope.\nXVII.  Disappointment is pain accompanied by the idea of\nsomething past, which has had an issue contrary to our hope.\nXVIII.  Pity is pain accompanied by the idea of evil, which has\nbefallen someone else whom we conceive to be like ourselves (cf.\nIII. xxii. note, and III. xxvii. note).\nExplanation--Between pity and sympathy (misericordia) there\nseems to be no difference, unless perhaps that the former term is\nused in reference to a particular action, and the latter in\nreference to a disposition.\nXIX.  Approval is love towards one who has done good to another.\nXX.  Indignation is hatred towards one who has done evil to\nanother.\nExplanation--I am aware that these terms are employed in\nsenses somewhat different from those usually assigned.  But my\npurpose is to explain, not the meaning of words, but the nature\nof things.  I therefore make use of such terms, as may convey my\nmeaning without any violent departure from their ordinary\nsignification.  One statement of my method will suffice. As for\nthe cause of the above--named emotions see III. xxvii. Coroll. i.,\nand III. xxii. note.\nXXI.  Partiality is thinking too highly of anyone because of the\nlove we bear him.\nXXII.  Disparagement is thinking too meanly of anyone because we\nhate him.\nExplanation--Thus partiality is an effect of love, and\ndisparagement an effect of hatred: so that partiality may also\nbe defined as love, in so far as it induces a man to think too\nhighly of a beloved object.  Contrariwise, disparagement may be\ndefined as hatred, in so far as it induces a man to think too\nmeanly of a hated object.  Cf. III. xxvi. note.\nXXIII.  Envy is hatred, in so far as it induces a man to be\npained by another's good fortune, and to rejoice in another's\nevil fortune.\nExplanation--Envy is generally opposed to sympathy, which, by\ndoing some violence to the meaning of the word, may therefore be\nthus defined:\nXXIV.  Sympathy (misericordia) is love, in so far as it induces a\nman to feel pleasure at another's good fortune, and pain at\nanother's evil fortune.\nExplanation--Concerning envy see the notes to III. xxiv. and\nxxxii.  These emotions also arise from pleasure or pain\naccompanied by the idea of something external, as cause either in\nitself or accidentally.  I now pass on to other emotions, which\nare accompanied by the idea of something within as a cause.\nXXV.  Self--approval is pleasure arising from a man's\ncontemplation of himself and his own power of action.\nXXVI.  Humility is pain arising from a man's contemplation of his\nown weakness of body or mind.\nExplanation--Self--complacency is opposed to humility, in so\nfar as we thereby mean pleasure arising from a contemplation of\nour own power of action; but, in so far as we mean thereby\npleasure accompanied by the idea of any action which we believe\nwe have performed by the free decision of our mind, it is opposed\nto repentance, which we may thus define:\nXXVII.  Repentance is pain accompanied by the idea of some\naction, which we believe we have performed by the free decision\nof our mind.\nExplanation--The causes of these emotions we have set forth in\nIII. li. note, and in III. liii., liv., lv. and note.  Concerning\nthe free decision of the mind see II. xxxv. note.  This is\nperhaps the place to call attention to the fact, that it is\nnothing wonderful that all those actions, which are commonly\ncalled wrong, are followed by pain, and all those, which are\ncalled right, are followed by pleasure.  We can easily gather\nfrom what has been said, that this depends in great measure on\neducation.  Parents, by reprobating the former class of actions,\nand by frequently chiding their children because of them, and\nalso by persuading to and praising the latter class, have brought\nit about, that the former should be associated with pain and the\nlatter with pleasure.  This is confirmed by experience.  For\ncustom and religion are not the same among all men, but that\nwhich some consider sacred others consider profane, and what some\nconsider honourable others consider disgraceful.  According as\neach man has been educated, he feels repentance for a given\naction or glories therein.\nXXVIII.  Pride is thinking too highly of one's self from\nself--love.\nExplanation--Thus pride is different from partiality, for the\nlatter term is used in reference to an external object, but pride\nis used of a man thinking too highly of himself.  However, as\npartiality is the effect of love, so is pride the effect or\nproperty of self--love, which may therefore be thus defined, love\nof self or self--approval, in so far as it leads a man to think\ntoo highly of himself.  To this emotion there is no contrary.\nFor no one thinks too meanly of himself because of self--hatred;\nI say that no one thinks too meanly of himself, in so far as he\nconceives that he is incapable of doing this or that.  For\nwhatsoever a man imagines that he is incapable of doing, he\nimagines this of necessity, and by that notion he is so disposed,\nthat he really cannot do that which he conceives that he cannot\ndo.  For, so long as he conceives that he cannot do it, so long\nis he not determined to do it, and consequently so long is it\nimpossible for him to do it.  However, if we consider such\nmatters as only depend on opinion, we shall find it conceivable\nthat a man may think too meanly of himself; for it may happen,\nthat a man, sorrowfully regarding his own weakness, should\nimagine that he is despised by all men, while the rest of the\nworld are thinking of nothing less than of despising him.  Again,\na man may think too meanly of himself, if he deny of himself in\nthe present something in relation to a future time of which he is\nuncertain.  As, for instance, if he should say that he is unable\nto form any clear conceptions, or that he can desire and do\nnothing but what is wicked and base, &c.  We may also say, that a\nman thinks too meanly of himself, when we see him from excessive\nfear of shame refusing to do things which others, his equals,\nventure.  We can, therefore, set down as a contrary to pride an\nemotion which I will call self--abasement, for as from\nself--complacency springs pride, so from humility springs\nself--abasement, which I will accordingly thus define:\nXXIX.  Self--abasement is thinking too meanly of one's self by\nreason of pain.\nExplanation--We are nevertheless generally accustomed to\noppose pride to humility, but in that case we pay more attention\nto the effect of either emotion than to its nature.  We are wont\nto call proud the man who boasts too much (III. xxx. note), who\ntalks of nothing but his own virtues and other people's faults,\nwho wishes to be first; and lastly who goes through life with a\nstyle and pomp suitable to those far above him in station.  On\nthe other hand, we call humble the man who too often blushes, who\nconfesses his faults, who sets forth other men's virtues, and\nwho, lastly, walks with bent head and is negligent of his attire.\nHowever, these emotions, humility and self--abasement, are\nextremely rare.  For human nature, considered in itself, strives\nagainst them as much as it can (see III. xiii., liv.); hence\nthose, who are believed to be most self--abased and humble, are\ngenerally in reality the most ambitious and envious.\nXXX.  Honour[11] is pleasure accompanied by the idea of some action\nof our own, which we believe to be praised by others.\n[11] Gloria.\nXXXI.  Shame is pain accompanied by the idea of some action of\nour own, which we believe to be blamed by others.\nExplanation--On this subject see the note to III. xxx.  But we\nshould here remark the difference which exists between shame and\nmodesty.  Shame is the pain following the deed whereof we are\nashamed.  Modesty is the fear or dread of shame, which restrains\na man from committing a base action.  Modesty is usually opposed\nto shamelessness, but the latter is not an emotion, as I will\nduly show; however, the names of the emotions (as I have\nremarked already) have regard rather to their exercise than to\ntheir nature.\nI have now fulfilled the task of explaining the emotions\narising from pleasure and pain.  I therefore proceed to treat of\nthose which I refer to desire.\nXXXII.  Regret is the desire or appetite to possess something,\nkept alive by the remembrance of the said thing, and at the same\ntime constrained by the remembrance of other things which exclude\nthe existence of it.\nExplanation--When we remember a thing, we are by that very\nfact, as I have already said more than once, disposed to\ncontemplate it with the same emotion as if it were something\npresent; but this disposition or endeavour, while we are awake,\nis generally checked by the images of things which exclude the\nexistence of that which we remember.  Thus when we remember\nsomething which affected us with a certain pleasure, we by that\nvery fact endeavour to regard it with the same emotion of\npleasure as though it were present, but this endeavour is at once\nchecked by the remembrance of things which exclude the existence\nof the thing in question.  Wherefore regret is, strictly\nspeaking, a pain opposed to that of pleasure, which arises from\nthe absence of something we hate (cf. III. xlvii. note).  But, as\nthe name regret seems to refer to desire, I set this emotion\ndown, among the emotions springing from desire.\nXXXIII.  Emulation is the desire of something, engendered in us\nby our conception that others have the same desire.\nExplanation--He who runs away, because he sees others running\naway, or he who fears, because he sees others in fear; or again,\nhe who, on seeing that another man has burnt his hand, draws\ntowards him his own hand, and moves his body as though his own\nwere burnt; such an one can be said to imitate another's\nemotion, but not to emulate him; not because the causes of\nemulation and imitation are different, but because it has become\ncustomary to speak of emulation only in him, who imitates that\nwhich we deem to be honourable, useful, or pleasant.  As to the\ncause of emulation, cf. III. xxvii. and note.  The reason why\nthis emotion is generally coupled with envy may be seen from III.\nxxxii. and note.\nXXXIV.  Thankfulness or Gratitude is the desire or zeal springing\nfrom love, whereby we endeavour to benefit him, who with similar\nfeelings of love has conferred a benefit on us.  Cf. III. xxxix.\nnote and xl.\nXXXV.  Benevolence is the desire of benefiting one whom we pity.\nCf. III. xxvii. note.\nXXXVI.  Anger is the desire, whereby through hatred we are\ninduced to injure one whom we hate, III. xxxix.\nXXXVII.  Revenge is the desire whereby we are induced, through\nmutual hatred, to injure one who, with similar feelings, has\ninjured us.  (See III. xl. Coroll. ii and note.)\nXXXVIII.  Cruelty or savageness is the desire, whereby a man is\nimpelled to injure one whom we love or pity.\nExplanation--To cruelty is opposed clemency, which is not a\npassive state of the mind, but a power whereby man restrains his\nanger and revenge.\nXXXIX.  Timidity is the desire to avoid a greater evil, which we\ndread, by undergoing a lesser evil.  Cf. III. xxxix. note.\nXL.  Daring is the desire, whereby a man is set on to do\nsomething dangerous which his equals fear to attempt.\nXLI.  Cowardice is attributed to one, whose desire is checked by\nthe fear of some danger which his equals dare to encounter.\nExplanation--Cowardice is, therefore, nothing else but the\nfear of some evil, which most men are wont not to fear; hence I\ndo not reckon it among the emotions springing from desire.\nNevertheless, I have chosen to explain it here, because, in so\nfar as we look to the desire, it is truly opposed to the emotion\nof daring.\nXLII.  Consternation is attributed to one, whose desire of\navoiding evil is checked by amazement at the evil which he fears.\nExplanation--Consternation is, therefore, a species of\ncowardice.  But, inasmuch as consternation arises from a double\nfear, it may be more conveniently defined as a fear which keeps a\nman so bewildered and wavering, that he is not able to remove the\nevil.  I say bewildered, in so far as we understand his desire of\nremoving the evil to be constrained by his amazement.  I say\nwavering, in so far as we understand the said desire to be\nconstrained by the fear of another evil, which equally torments\nhim: whence it comes to pass that he knows not, which he may\navert of the two.  On this subject, see III. xxxix. note, and\nIII. lii. note.  Concerning cowardice and daring, see III. li.\nnote.\nXLIII.  Courtesy, or deference (Humanitas seu modestia), is the\ndesire of acting in a way that should please men, and refraining\nfrom that which should displease them.\nXLIV.  Ambition is the immoderate desire of power.\nExplanation--Ambition is the desire, whereby all the emotions\n(cf. III. xxvii. and xxxi.) are fostered and strengthened;\ntherefore this emotion can with difficulty be overcome.  For, so\nlong as a man is bound by any desire, he is at the same time\nnecessarily bound by this.  \"The best men,\" says Cicero, \"are\nespecially led by honour.  Even philosophers, when they write a\nbook contemning honour, sign their names thereto,\" and so on.\nXLV.  Luxury is excessive desire, or even love of living\nsumptuously.\nXLVI.  Intemperance is the excessive desire and love of drinking.\nXLVII.  Avarice is the excessive desire and love of riches.\nXLVIII.  Lust is desire and love in the matter of sexual\nintercourse.\nExplanation--Whether this desire be excessive or not, it is\nstill called lust.  These last five emotions (as I have shown in\nIII. lvi.) have on contraries.  For deference is a species of\nambition.  Cf. III. xxix. note.\nAgain, I have already pointed out, that temperance, sobriety,\nand chastity indicate rather a power than a passivity of the\nmind.  It may, nevertheless, happen, that an avaricious, an\nambitious, or a timid man may abstain from excess in eating,\ndrinking, or sexual indulgence, yet avarice, ambition, and fear\nare not contraries to luxury, drunkenness, and debauchery.  For\nan avaricious man often is glad to gorge himself with food and\ndrink at another man's expense.  An ambitious man will restrain\nhimself in nothing, so long as he thinks his indulgences are\nsecret; and if he lives among drunkards and debauchees, he will,\nfrom the mere fact of being ambitious, be more prone to those\nvices.  Lastly, a timid man does that which he would not.  For\nthough an avaricious man should, for the sake of avoiding death,\ncast his riches into the sea, he will none the less remain\navaricious; so, also, if a lustful man is downcast, because he\ncannot follow his bent, he does not, on the ground of abstention,\ncease to be lustful.  In fact, these emotions are not so much\nconcerned with the actual feasting, drinking, &c., as with the\nappetite and love of such.  Nothing, therefore, can be opposed to\nthese emotions, but high--mindedness and valour, whereof I will\nspeak presently.\nThe definitions of jealousy and other waverings of the mind I\npass over in silence, first, because they arise from the\ncompounding of the emotions already described; secondly, because\nmany of them have no distinctive names, which shows that it is\nsufficient for practical purposes to have merely a general\nknowledge of them.  However, it is established from the\ndefinitions of the emotions, which we have set forth, that they\nall spring from desire, pleasure, or pain, or, rather, that there\nis nothing besides these three; wherefore each is wont to be\ncalled by a variety of names in accordance with its various\nrelations and extrinsic tokens.  If we now direct our attention\nto these primitive emotions, and to what has been said concerning\nthe nature of the mind, we shall be able thus to define the\nemotions, in so far as they are referred to the mind only.\nGENERAL DEFINITION OF THE EMOTIONS\nEmotion, which is called a passivity of the soul, is a\nconfused idea, whereby the mind affirms concerning its body, or\nany part thereof, a force for existence (existendi vis) greater\nor less than before, and by the presence of which the mind is\ndetermined to think of one thing rather than another.\nExplanation--I say, first, that emotion or passion of the soul\nis a confused idea.  For we have shown that the mind is only\npassive, in so far as it has inadequate or confused ideas.  (III.\niii.)  I say, further, whereby the mind affirms concerning its\nbody or any part thereof a force for existence greater than\nbefore.  For all the ideas of bodies, which we possess, denote\nrather the actual disposition of our own body (II. xvi. Coroll.\nii.) than the nature of an external body.  But the idea which\nconstitutes the reality of an emotion must denote or express the\ndisposition of the body, or of some part thereof, because its\npower of action or force for existence is increased or\ndiminished, helped or hindered.  But it must be noted that, when\nI say a greater or less force for existence than before, I do not\nmean that the mind compares the present with the past disposition\nof the body, but that the idea which constitutes the reality of\nan emotion affirms something of the body, which, in fact,\ninvolves more or less of reality than before.\nAnd inasmuch as the essence of mind consists in the fact (II.\nxi., xiii.), that it affirms the actual existence of its own\nbody, and inasmuch as we understand by perfection the very\nessence of a thing, it follows that the mind passes to greater or\nless perfection, when it happens to affirm concerning its own\nbody, or any part thereof, something involving more or less\nreality than before.\nWhen, therefore, I said above that the power of the mind is\nincreased or diminished, I merely meant that the mind had formed\nof its own body, or of some part thereof, an idea involving more\nor less of reality, than it had already affirmed concerning its\nown body.  For the excellence of ideas, and the actual power of\nthinking are measured by the excellence of the object.  Lastly, I\nhave added by the presence of which the mind is determined to\nthink of one thing rather than another, so that, besides the\nnature of pleasure and pain, which the first part of the\ndefinition explains, I might also express the nature of desire.\nPART IV:\nOf Human Bondage, or the Strength of the Emotions\nPREFACE\nHuman infirmity in moderating and checking the emotions I\nname bondage: for, when a man is a prey to his emotions, he is\nnot his own master, but lies at the mercy of fortune: so much\nso, that he is often compelled, while seeing that which is better\nfor him, to follow that which is worse.  Why this is so, and what\nis good or evil in the emotions, I propose to show in this part\nof my treatise.  But, before I begin, it would be well to make a\nfew prefatory observations on perfection and imperfection, good\nand evil.\nWhen a man has purposed to make a given thing, and has\nbrought it to perfection, his work will be pronounced perfect,\nnot only by himself, but by everyone who rightly knows, or thinks\nthat he knows, the intention and aim of its author.  For\ninstance, suppose anyone sees a work (which I assume to be not\nyet completed), and knows that the aim of the author of that work\nis to build a house, he will call the work imperfect; he will,\non the other hand, call it perfect, as soon as he sees that it is\ncarried through to the end, which its author had purposed for it.\nBut if a man sees a work, the like whereof he has never seen\nbefore, and if he knows not the intention of the artificer, he\nplainly cannot know, whether that work be perfect or imperfect.\nSuch seems to be the primary meaning of these terms.\nBut, after men began to form general ideas, to think out\ntypes of houses, buildings, towers, &c., and to prefer certain\ntypes to others, it came about, that each man called perfect that\nwhich he saw agree with the general idea he had formed of the\nthing in question, and called imperfect that which he saw agree\nless with his own preconceived type, even though it had evidently\nbeen completed in accordance with the idea of its artificer.\nThis seems to be the only reason for calling natural phenomena,\nwhich, indeed, are not made with human hands, perfect or\nimperfect: for men are wont to form general ideas of things\nnatural, no less than of things artificial, and such ideas they\nhold as types, believing that Nature (who they think does nothing\nwithout an object) has them in view, and has set them as types\nbefore herself.  Therefore, when they behold something in Nature,\nwhich does not wholly conform to the preconceived type which they\nhave formed of the thing in question, they say that Nature has\nfallen short or has blundered, and has left her work incomplete.\nThus we see that men are wont to style natural phenomena perfect\nor imperfect rather from their own prejudices, than from true\nknowledge of what they pronounce upon.\nNow we showed in the Appendix to Part I., that Nature does\nnot work with an end in view.  For the eternal and infinite\nBeing, which we call God or Nature, acts by the same necessity as\nthat whereby it exists.  For we have shown, that by the same\nnecessity of its nature, whereby it exists, it likewise works (I.\nxvi.).  The reason or cause why God or Nature exists, and the\nreason why he acts, are one and the same.  Therefore, as he does\nnot exist for the sake of an end, so neither does he act for the\nsake of an end; of his existence and of his action there is\nneither origin nor end.  Wherefore, a cause which is called final\nis nothing else but human desire, in so far as it is considered\nas the origin or cause of anything.  For example, when we say\nthat to be inhabited is the final cause of this or that house, we\nmean nothing more than that a man, conceiving the conveniences of\nhousehold life, had a desire to build a house.  Wherefore, the\nbeing inhabited, in so far as it is regarded as a final cause, is\nnothing else but this particular desire, which is really the\nefficient cause; it is regarded as the primary cause, because\nmen are generally ignorant of the causes of their desires.  They\nare, as I have often said already, conscious of their own actions\nand appetites, but ignorant of the causes whereby they are\ndetermined to any particular desire.  Therefore, the common\nsaying that Nature sometimes falls short, or blunders, and\nproduces things which are imperfect, I set down among the glosses\ntreated of in the Appendix to Part I.  Perfection and\nimperfection, then, are in reality merely modes of thinking, or\nnotions which we form from a comparison among one another of\nindividuals of the same species; hence I said above (II. Def.\nvi.), that by reality and perfection I mean the same thing.  For\nwe are wont to refer all the individual things in nature to one\ngenus, which is called the highest genus, namely, to the category\nof Being, whereto absolutely all individuals in nature belong.\nThus, in so far as we refer the individuals in nature to this\ncategory, and comparing them one with another, find that some\npossess more of being or reality than others, we, to this extent,\nsay that some are more perfect than others.  Again, in so far as\nwe attribute to them anything implying negation--as term, end,\ninfirmity, etc., we, to this extent, call them imperfect, because\nthey do not affect our mind so much as the things which we call\nperfect, not because they have any intrinsic deficiency, or\nbecause Nature has blundered.  For nothing lies within the scope\nof a thing's nature, save that which follows from the necessity\nof the nature of its efficient cause, and whatsoever follows from\nthe necessity of the nature of its efficient cause necessarily\ncomes to pass.\nAs for the terms good and bad, they indicate no positive\nquality in things regarded in themselves, but are merely modes of\nthinking, or notions which we form from the comparison of things\none with another.  Thus one and the same thing can be at the same\ntime good, bad, and indifferent.  For instance, music is good for\nhim that is melancholy, bad for him that mourns; for him that is\ndeaf, it is neither good nor bad.\nNevertheless, though this be so, the terms should still be\nretained.  For, inasmuch as we desire to form an idea of man as a\ntype of human nature which we may hold in view, it will be useful\nfor us to retain the terms in question, in the sense I have\nindicated.\nIn what follows, then, I shall mean by, \"good\" that, which we\ncertainly know to be a means of approaching more nearly to the\ntype of human nature, which we have set before ourselves; by\n\"bad,\" that which we certainly know to be a hindrance to us in\napproaching the said type.  Again, we shall that men are more\nperfect, or more imperfect, in proportion as they approach more\nor less nearly to the said type.  For it must be specially\nremarked that, when I say that a man passes from a lesser to a\ngreater perfection, or vice versa, I do not mean that he is\nchanged from one essence or reality to another; for instance, a\nhorse would be as completely destroyed by being changed into a\nman, as by being changed into an insect.  What I mean is, that we\nconceive the thing's power of action, in so far as this is\nunderstood by its nature, to be increased or diminished.  Lastly,\nby perfection in general I shall, as I have said, mean reality--in\nother words, each thing's essence, in so far as it exists, and\noperates in a particular manner, and without paying any regard to\nits duration.  For no given thing can be said to be more perfect,\nbecause it has passed a longer time in existence.  The duration\nof things cannot be determined by their essence, for the essence\nof things involves no fixed and definite period of existence;\nbut everything, whether it be more perfect or less perfect, will\nalways be able to persist in existence with the same force\nwherewith it began to exist; wherefore, in this respect, all\nthings are equal.\nDEFINITIONS.\nI.  By good I mean that which we certainly know to be useful to\nus.\nII.  By evil I mean that which we certainly know to be a\nhindrance\nto us in the attainment of any good.\n(Concerning these terms see the foregoing preface towards the\nend.)\nIII.  Particular things I call contingent in so far as, while\nregarding their essence only, we find nothing therein, which\nnecessarily asserts their existence or excludes it.\nIV.  Particular things I call possible in so far as, while\nregarding the causes whereby they must be produced, we know not,\nwhether such causes be determined for producing them.\n(In I. xxxiii. note. i., I drew no distinction between\npossible and contingent, because there was in that place no need\nto distinguish them accurately.)\nV.  By conflicting emotions I mean those which draw a man in\ndifferent directions, though they are of the same kind, such as\nluxury and avarice, which are both species of love, and are\ncontraries, not by nature, but by accident.\nVI.  What I mean by emotion felt towards a thing, future,\npresent, and past, I explained in III. xviii., notes. i. and ii.,\nwhich see.\n(But I should here also remark, that we can only distinctly\nconceive distance of space or time up to a certain definite limit;\nthat is, all objects distant from us more than two hundred\nfeet, or whose distance from the place where we are exceeds that\nwhich we can distinctly conceive, seem to be an equal distance\nfrom us, and all in the same plane; so also objects, whose time\nof existing is conceived as removed from the present by a longer\ninterval than we can distinctly conceive, seem to be all equally\ndistant from the present, and are set down, as it were, to the\nsame moment of time.)\nVII.  By an end, for the sake of which we do something, I mean a\ndesire.\nVIII.  By virtue (virtus) and power I mean the same thing; that\nis (III. vii), virtue, in so far as it is referred to man, is a\nman's nature or essence, in so far as it has the power of\neffecting what can only be understood by the laws of that nature.\nAXIOM.\nThere is no individual thing in nature, than which there is\nnot another more powerful and strong.  Whatsoever thing be given,\nthere is something stronger whereby it can be destroyed.\nPROPOSITIONS.\nPROP. I.  No positive quality possessed by a false idea is\nremoved by the presence of what is true, in virtue of its being\ntrue.\nProof.--Falsity consists solely in the privation of knowledge\nwhich inadequate ideas involve (II. xxxv.), nor have they any\npositive quality on account of which they are called false (II.\nxxxiii.); contrariwise, in so far as they are referred to God,\nthey are true (II. xxxii.).  Wherefore, if the positive quality\npossessed by a false idea were removed by the presence of what is\ntrue, in virtue of its being true, a true idea would then be\nremoved by itself, which (IV. iii.) is absurd.  Therefore, no\npositive quality possessed by a false idea, &c.  Q.E.D.\nNote.--This proposition is more clearly understood from II.\nxvi. Coroll. ii.  For imagination is an idea, which indicates\nrather the present disposition of the human body than the nature\nof the external body; not indeed distinctly, but confusedly;\nwhence it comes to pass, that the mind is said to err.  For\ninstance, when we look at the sun, we conceive that it is distant\nfrom us about two hundred feet; in this judgment we err, so long\nas we are in ignorance of its true distance; when its true\ndistance is known, the error is removed, but not the imagination;\nor, in other words, the idea of the sun, which only explains\ntho nature of that luminary, in so far as the body is affected\nthereby: wherefore, though we know the real distance, we shall\nstill nevertheless imagine the sun to be near us.  For, as we\nsaid in II. xxxv. note, we do not imagine the sun to be so near\nus, because we are ignorant of its true distance, but because the\nmind conceives the magnitude of the sun to the extent that the\nbody is affected thereby.  Thus, when the rays of the sun falling\non the surface of water are reflected into our eyes, we imagine\nthe sun as if it were in the water, though we are aware of its\nreal position; and similarly other imaginations, wherein the\nmind is deceived, whether they indicate the natural disposition\nof the body, or that its power of activity is increased or\ndiminished, are not contrary to the truth, and do not vanish at\nits presence.  It happens indeed that, when we mistakenly fear an\nevil, the fear vanishes when we hear the true tidings; but the\ncontrary also happens, namely, that we fear an evil which will\ncertainly come, and our fear vanishes when we hear false tidings;\nthus imaginations do not vanish at the presence of the truth,\nin virtue of its being true, but because other imaginations,\nstronger than the first, supervene and exclude the present\nexistence of that which we imagined, as I have shown in II. xvii.\nPROP. II.  We are only passive, in so far as we are apart of\nNature, which cannot be conceived by itself without other parts.\nProof.--We are said to be passive, when something arises in\nus, whereof we are only a partial cause (III. Def. ii.), that is\n(III. Def. i.), something which cannot be deduced solely from the\nlaws of our nature.  We are passive therefore, in so far as we\nare a part of Nature, which cannot be conceived by itself without\nother parts.  Q.E.D.\nPROP. III.  The force whereby a man persists in existing is\nlimited, and is infinitely surpassed by the power of external\ncauses.\nProof.--This is evident from the axiom of this part.  For,\nwhen man is given, there is something else--say A--more powerful;\nwhen A is given, there is something else--say B--more powerful than\nA, and so on to infinity; thus the power of man is limited by\nthe power of some other thing, and is infinitely surpassed by the\npower of external causes.  Q.E.D.\nPROP. IV.  It is impossible, that man should not be a part of\nNature, or that he should be capable of undergoing no changes,\nsave such as can be understood through his nature only as their\nadequate cause.\nProof.--The power, whereby each particular thing, and\nconsequently man, preserves his being, is the power of God or of\nNature (I. xxiv. Coroll.); not in so far as it is infinite, but\nin so far as it can be explained by the actual human essence\n(III. vii.).  Thus the power of man, in so far as it is explained\nthrough his own actual essence, is a part of the infinite power\nof God or Nature, in other words, of the essence thereof (I.\nxxxiv.).  This was our first point.  Again, if it were possible,\nthat man should undergo no changes save such as can be understood\nsolely through the nature of man, it would follow that he would\nnot be able to die, but would always necessarily exist; this\nwould be the necessary consequence of a cause whose power was\neither finite or infinite; namely, either of man's power only,\ninasmuch as he would be capable of removing from himself all\nchanges which could spring from external causes; or of the\ninfinite power of Nature, whereby all individual things would be\nso ordered, that man should be incapable of undergoing any\nchanges save such as tended towards his own preservation.  But\nthe first alternative is absurd (by the last Prop., the proof of\nwhich is universal, and can be applied to all individual things).\nTherefore, if it be possible, that man should not be capable of\nundergoing any changes, save such as can be explained solely\nthrough his own nature, and consequently that he must always (as\nwe have shown) necessarily exist; such a result must follow from\nthe infinite power of God, and consequently (I. xvi.) from the\nnecessity of the divine nature, in so far as it is regarded as\naffected by the idea of any given man, the whole order of nature\nas conceived under the attributes of extension and thought must\nbe deducible.  It would therefore follow (I. xxi.) that man is\ninfinite, which (by the first part of this proof) is absurd.  It\nis, therefore, impossible, that man should not undergo any\nchanges save those whereof he is the adequate cause.  Q.E.D.\nCorollary.--Hence it follows, that man is necessarily always a\nprey to his passions, that he follows and obeys the general order\nof nature, and that he accommodates himself thereto, as much as\nthe nature of things demands.\nPROP. V.  The power and increase of every passion, and its\npersistence in existing are not defined by the power, whereby we\nourselves endeavour to persist in existing, but by the power of\nan external cause compared with our own.\nProof.--The essence of a passion cannot be explained through\nour essence alone (III. Deff. i. and ii.), that is (III. vii.),\nthe power of a passion cannot be defined by the power, whereby we\nourselves endeavour to persist in existing, but (as is shown in\nII. xvi.) must necessarily be defined by the power of an external\ncause compared with our own.  Q.E.D.\nPROP. VI.  The force of any passion or emotion can overcome the\nrest of a man's activities or power, so that the emotion becomes\nobstinately fixed to him.\nProof.--The force and increase of any passion and its\npersistence in existing are defined by the power of an external\ncause compared with our own (by the foregoing Prop.); therefore\n(IV. iii.) it can overcome a man's power, &e.  Q.E.D.\nPROP. VII.  An emotion can only be controlled or destroyed by\nanother emotion contrary thereto, and with more power for\ncontrolling emotion.\nProof.--Emotion, in so far as it is referred to the mind, is\nan idea, whereby the mind affirms of its body a greater or less\nforce of existence than before (cf. the general Definition of the\nEmotions at the end of Part III.).  When, therefore, the mind is\nassailed by any emotion, the body is at the same time affected\nwith a modification whereby its power of activity is increased or\ndiminished.  Now this modification of the body (IV. v.) receives\nfrom its cause the force for persistence in its being; which\nforce can only be checked or destroyed by a bodily cause (II.\nvi.), in virtue of the body being affected with a modification\ncontrary to (III. v.) and stronger than itself (IV. Ax.);\nwherefore (II. xii.) the mind is affected by the idea of a\nmodification contrary to, and stronger than the former\nmodification, in other words, (by the general definition of the\nemotions) the mind will be affected by an emotion contrary to and\nstronger than the former emotion, which will exclude or destroy\nthe existence of the former emotion; thus an emotion cannot be\ndestroyed nor controlled except by a contrary and stronger\nemotion.  Q.E.D.\nCorollary.--An emotion, in so far as it is referred to the\nmind, can only be controlled or destroyed through an idea of a\nmodification of the body contrary to, and stronger than, that\nwhich we are undergoing.  For the emotion which we undergo can\nonly be checked or destroyed by an emotion contrary to, and\nstronger than, itself, in other words, (by the general Definition\nof the Emotions) only by an idea of a modification of the body\ncontrary to, and stronger than, the modification which we\nundergo.\nPROP. VIII.  The knowledge of good and evil is nothing else but\nthe emotions of pleasure or pain, in so far as we are conscious\nthereof.\nProof.--We call a thing good or evil, when it is of service or\nthe reverse in preserving our being (IV. Deff. i. and ii.), that\nis (III. vii.), when it increases or diminishes, helps or\nhinders, our power of activity.  Thus, in so far as we perceive\nthat a thing affects us with pleasure or pain, we call it good or\nevil; wherefore the knowledge of good and evil is nothing else\nbut the idea of the pleasure or pain, which necessarily follows\nfrom that pleasurable or painful emotion (II. xxii.).  But this\nidea is united to the emotion in the same way as mind is united\nto body (II. xxi.); that is, there is no real distinction\nbetween this idea and the emotion or idea of the modification of\nthe body, save in conception only.  Therefore the knowledge of\ngood and evil is nothing else but the emotion, in so far as we\nare conscious thereof.  Q.E.D.\nPROP. IX.  An emotion, whereof we conceive the cause to be with\nus at the present time, is stronger than if we did not conceive\nthe cause to be with us.\nProof.--Imagination or conception is the idea, by which the\nmind regards a thing as present (II. xvii. note), but which\nindicates the disposition of the mind rather than the nature of\nthe external thing (II. xvi. Coroll. ii.).  An emotion is\ntherefore a conception, in so far as it indicates the disposition\nof the body.  But a conception (by II. xvii.) is stronger, so\nlong as we conceive nothing which excludes the present existence\nof the external object; wherefore an emotion is also stronger or\nmore intense, when we conceive the cause to be with us at the\npresent time, than when we do not conceive the cause to be with\nus.  Q.E.D.\nNote.--When I said above in III. xviii. that we are affected\nby the image of what is past or future with the same emotion as\nif the thing conceived were present, I expressly stated, that\nthis is only true in so far as we look solely to the image of the\nthing in question itself; for the thing's nature is unchanged,\nwhether we have conceived it or not; I did not deny that the\nimage becomes weaker, when we regard as present to us other\nthings which exclude the present existence of the future object:\nI did not expressly call attention to the fact, because I\npurposed to treat of the strength of the emotions in this part of\nmy work.\nCorollary.--The image of something past or future, that is, of\na thing which we regard as in relation to time past or time\nfuture, to the exclusion of time present, is, when other\nconditions are equal, weaker than the image of something present;\nconsequently an emotion felt towards what is past or future is\nless intense, other conditions being equal, than an emotion felt\ntowards something present.\nPROP. X.  Towards something future, which we conceive as close at\nhand, we are affected more intensely, than if we conceive that\nits time for existence is separated from the present by a longer\ninterval; so too by the remembrance of what we conceive to have\nnot long passed away we are affected more intensely, than if we\nconceive that it has long passed away.\nProof.--In so far as we conceive a thing as close at hand, or\nnot long passed away, we conceive that which excludes the\npresence of the object less, than if its period of future\nexistence were more distant from the present, or if it had long\npassed away (this is obvious) therefore (by the foregoing Prop.)\nwe are, so far, more intensely affected towards it.  Q.E.D.\nCorollary.--From the remarks made in Def. vi. of this part it\nfollows that, if objects are separated from the present by a\nlonger period than we can define in conception, though their\ndates of occurrence be widely separated one from the other, they\nall affect us equally faintly.\nPROP. XI.  An emotion towards that which we conceive as necessary\nis, when other conditions are equal, more intense than an emotion\ntowards that which possible, or contingent, or non--necessary.\nProof.--In so far as we conceive a thing to be necessary, we,\nto that extent, affirm its existence; on the other hand we deny\na thing's existence, in so far as we conceive it not to be\nnecessary (I. xxxiii. note. i.); wherefore (IV. ix.) an emotion\ntowards that which is necessary is, other conditions being equal,\nmore intense than an emotion that which is non--necessary.  Q.E.D.\nPROP. XII.  An emotion towards a thing, which we know not to\nexist at the present time, and which we conceive as possible, is\nmore intense, other conditions being equal, than an emotion\ntowards a thing contingent.\nProof.--In so far as we conceive a thing as contingent, we are\naffected by the conception of some further thing, which would\nassert the existence of the former (IV. Def. iii.); but, on the\nother hand, we (by hypothesis) conceive certain things, which\nexclude its present existence.  But, in so far as we conceive a\nthing to be possible in the future, we there by conceive things\nwhich assert its existence (IV. iv.), that is (III. xviii.),\nthings which promote hope or fear: wherefore an emotion towards\nsomething possible is more vehement.  Q.E.D.\nCorollary.--An emotion towards a thing, which we know not to\nexist in the present, and which we conceive as contingent, is far\nfainter, than if we conceive the thing to be present with us.\nProof.--Emotion towards a thing, which we conceive to exist,\nis more intense than it would be, if we conceived the thing as\nfuture (IV. ix. Coroll.), and is much more vehement, than if the\nfuture time be conceived as far distant from the present (IV.\nx.).  Therefore an emotion towards a thing, whose period of\nexistence we conceive to be far distant from the present, is far\nfainter, than if we conceive the thing as present; it is,\nnevertheless, more intense, than if we conceived the thing as\ncontingent, wherefore an emotion towards a thing, which we regard\nas contingent, will be far fainter, than if we conceived the\nthing to be present with us.  Q.E.D.\nPROP. XIII.  Emotion towards a thing contingent, which we know\nnot to exist in the present, is, other conditions being equal,\nfainter than an emotion towards a thing past.\nProof.--In so far as we conceive a thing as contingent, we are\nnot affected by the image of any other thing, which asserts the\nexistence of the said thing (IV. Def. iii.), but, on the other\nhand (by hypothesis), we conceive certain things excluding its\npresent existence.  But, in so far as we conceive it in relation\nto time past, we are assumed to conceive something, which recalls\nthe thing to memory, or excites the image thereof (II. xviii. and\nnote), which is so far the same as regarding it as present (II.\nxvii. Coroll.).  Therefore (IV. ix.) an emotion towards a thing\ncontingent, which we know does not exist in the present, is\nfainter, other conditions being equal, than an emotion towards a\nthing past.  Q.E.D.\nPROP. XIV.  A true knowledge of good and evil cannot check any\nemotion by virtue of being true, but only in so far as it is\nconsidered as an emotion.\nProof.--An emotion is an idea, whereby the mind affirms of its\nbody a greater or less force of existing than before (by the\ngeneral Definition of the Emotions); therefore it has no\npositive quality, which can be destroyed by the presence of what\nis true; consequently the knowledge of good and evil cannot, by\nvirtue of being true, restrain any emotion.  But, in so far as\nsuch knowledge is an emotion (IV. viii.) if it have more strength\nfor restraining emotion, it will to that extent be able to\nrestrain the given emotion.  Q.E.D.\nPROP. XV.  Desire arising from the knowledge of good and bad can\nbe quenched or checked by many of the other desires arising from\nthe emotions whereby we are assailed.\nProof.--From the true knowledge of good and evil, in so far as\nit is an emotion, necessarily arises desire (Def. of the\nEmotions, i.), the strength of which is proportioned to the\nstrength of the emotion wherefrom it arises (III. xxxvii.).  But,\ninasmuch as this desire arises (by hypothesis) from the fact of\nour truly understanding anything, it follows that it is also\npresent with us, in so far as we are active (III. i.), and must\ntherefore be understood through our essence only (III. Def. ii.);\nconsequently (III. vii.) its force and increase can be defined\nsolely by human power.  Again, the desires arising from the\nemotions whereby we are assailed are stronger, in proportion as\nthe said emotions are more vehement; wherefore their force and\nincrease must be defined solely by the power of external causes,\nwhich, when compared with our own power, indefinitely surpass it\n(IV. iii.); hence the desires arising from like emotions may be\nmore vehement, than the desire which arises from a true knowledge\nof good and evil, and may, consequently, control or quench it.\nQ.E.D.\nPROP. XVI.  Desire arising from the knowledge of good and evil,\nin so far as such knowledge regards what is future, may be more\neasily controlled or quenched, than the desire for what is\nagreeable at the present moment.\nProof.--Emotion towards a thing, which we conceive as future,\nis fainter than emotion towards a thing that is present (IV. ix.\nCoroll.).  But desire, which arises from the true knowledge of\ngood and evil, though it be concerned with things which are good\nat the moment, can be quenched or controlled by any headstrong\ndesire (by the last Prop., the proof whereof is of universal\napplication).  Wherefore desire arising from such knowledge, when\nconcerned with the future, can be more easily controlled or\nquenched, &c.  Q.E.D.\nPROP. XVII.  Desire arising from the true knowledge of good and\nevil, in so far as such knowledge is concerned with what is\ncontingent, can be controlled far more easily still, than desire\nfor things that are present.\nProof.--This Prop. is proved in the same way as the last Prop.\nfrom IV. xii. Coroll.\nNote.--I think I have now shown the reason, why men are moved\nby opinion more readily than by true reason, why it is that the\ntrue knowledge of good and evil stirs up conflicts in the soul,\nand often yields to every kind of passion.  This state of things\ngave rise to the exclamation of the poet:[12]----\n\"The better path I gaze at and approve,\nThe worse--I follow.\"\n[12] Ov. Met. vii.20, \"Video meliora proboque, Deteriora sequor.\"\nEcclesiastes seems to have had the same thought in his mind,\nwhen he says, \"He who increaseth knowledge increaseth sorrow.\"  I\nhave not written the above with the object of drawing the\nconclusion, that ignorance is more excellent than knowledge, or\nthat a wise man is on a par with a fool in controlling his\nemotions, but because it is necessary to know the power and the\ninfirmity of our nature, before we can determine what reason can\ndo in restraining the emotions, and what is beyond her power.  I\nhave said, that in the present part I shall merely treat of human\ninfirmity.  The power of reason over the emotions I have settled\nto treat separately.\nPROP. XVIII.  Desire arising from pleasure is, other conditions\nbeing equal, stronger than desire arising from pain.\nProof.--Desire is the essence of a man (Def. of the Emotions,\ni.), that is, the endeavour whereby a man endeavours to persist\nin his own being.  Wherefore desire arising from pleasure is, by\nthe fact of pleasure being felt, increased or helped; on the\ncontrary, desire arising from pain is, by the fact of pain being\nfelt, diminished or hindered; hence the force of desire arising\nfrom pleasure must be defined by human power together with the\npower of an external cause, whereas desire arising from pain must\nbe defined by human power only.  Thus the former is the stronger\nof the two.  Q.E.D.\nNote.--In these few remarks I have explained the causes of\nhuman infirmity and inconstancy, and shown why men do not abide\nby the precepts of reason.  It now remains for me to show what\ncourse is marked out for us by reason, which of the emotions are\nin harmony with the rules of human reason, and which of them are\ncontrary thereto.  But, before I begin to prove my Propositions\nin detailed geometrical fashion, it is advisable to sketch them\nbriefly in advance, so that everyone may more readily grasp my\nmeaning.\nAs reason makes no demands contrary to nature, it demands,\nthat every man should love himself, should seek that which is\nuseful to him--I mean, that which is really useful to him, should\ndesire everything which really brings man to greater perfection,\nand should, each for himself, endeavour as far as he can to\npreserve his own being.  This is as necessarily true, as that a\nwhole is greater than its part.  (Cf. III. iv.)\nAgain, as virtue is nothing else but action in accordance\nwith the laws of one's own nature (IV. Def. viii.), and as no one\nendeavours to preserve his own being, except in accordance with\nthe laws of his own nature, it follows, first, that the\nfoundation of virtue is the endeavour to preserve one's own\nbeing, and that happiness consists in man's power of preserving\nhis own being; secondly, that virtue is to be desired for its\nown sake, and that there is nothing more excellent or more useful\nto us, for the sake of which we should desire it; thirdly and\nlastly, that suicides are weak--minded, and are overcome by\nexternal causes repugnant to their nature.  Further, it follows\nfrom Postulate iv., Part II., that we can never arrive at doing\nwithout all external things for the preservation of our being or\nliving, so as to have no relations with things which are outside\nourselves.  Again, if we consider our mind, we see that our\nintellect would be more imperfect, if mind were alone, and could\nunderstand nothing besides itself.  There are, then, many things\noutside ourselves, which are useful to us, and are, therefore, to\nbe desired.  Of such none can be discerned more excellent, than\nthose which are in entire agreement with our nature.  For if, for\nexample, two individuals of entirely the same nature are united,\nthey form a combination twice as powerful as either of them\nsingly.\nTherefore, to man there is nothing more useful than\nman--nothing, I repeat, more excellent for preserving their being\ncan be wished for by men, than that all should so in all points\nagree, that the minds and bodies of all should form, as it were,\none single mind and one single body, and that all should, with\none consent, as far as they are able, endeavour to preserve their\nbeing, and all with one consent seek what is useful to them all.\nHence, men who are governed by reason--that is, who seek what is\nuseful to them in accordance with reason, desire for themselves\nnothing, which they do not also desire for the rest of mankind,\nand, consequently, are just, faithful, and honourable in their\nconduct.\nSuch are the dictates of reason, which I purposed thus\nbriefly to indicate, before beginning to prove them in greater\ndetail.  I have taken this course, in order, if possible, to gain\nthe attention of those who believe, that the principle that every\nman is bound to seek what is useful for himself is the foundation\nof impiety, rather than of piety and virtue.\nTherefore, after briefly showing that the contrary is the\ncase, I go on to prove it by the same method, as that whereby I\nhave hitherto proceeded.\nPROP. XIX.  Every man, by the laws of his nature, necessarily\ndesires or shrinks from that which he deems to be good or bad.\nProof.--The knowledge of good and evil is (IV. viii.) the\nemotion of pleasure or pain, in so far as we are conscious\nthereof; therefore, every man necessarily desires what he thinks\ngood, and shrinks from what he thinks bad.  Now this appetite is\nnothing else but man's nature or essence (Cf. the Definition of\nAppetite, III. ix. note, and Def. of the Emotions, i.).\nTherefore, every man, solely by the laws of his nature, desires\nthe one, and shrinks from the other, &c.  Q.E.D.\nPROP. XX.  The more every man endeavours, and is able to seek\nwhat is useful to him--in other words, to preserve his own\nbeing--the more is he endowed with virtue; on the contrary, in\nproportion as a man neglects to seek what is useful to him, that\nis, to preserve his own being, he is wanting in power.\nProof.--Virtue is human power, which is defined solely by\nman's essence (IV. Def. viii.), that is, which is defined solely\nby the endeavour made by man to persist in his own being.\nWherefore, the more a man endeavours, and is able to preserve his\nown being, the more is he endowed with virtue, and, consequently\n(III. iv. and vi.), in so far as a man neglects to preserve his\nown being, he is wanting in power.  Q.E.D.\nNote.--No one, therefore, neglects seeking his own good, or\npreserving his own being, unless he be overcome by causes\nexternal and foreign to his nature.  No one, I say, from the\nnecessity of his own nature, or otherwise than under compulsion\nfrom external causes, shrinks from food, or kills himself: which\nlatter may be done in a variety of ways.  A man, for instance,\nkills himself under the compulsion of another man, who twists\nround his right hand, wherewith he happened to have taken up a\nsword, and forces him to turn the blade against his own heart;\nor, again, he may be compelled, like Seneca, by a tyrant's\ncommand, to open his own veins--that is, to escape a greater evil\nby incurring, a lesser; or, lastly, latent external causes may\nso disorder his imagination, and so affect his body, that it may\nassume a nature contrary to its former one, and whereof the idea\ncannot exist in the mind (III. x.) But that a man, from the\nnecessity of his own nature, should endeavour to become\nnon--existent, is as impossible as that something should be made\nout of nothing, as everyone will see for himself, after a little\nreflection.\nPROP. XXI.  No one can desire to be blessed, to act rightly, and\nto live rightly, without at the same time wishing to be, act, and\nto live--in other words, to actually exist.\nProof.--The proof of this proposition, or rather the\nproposition itself, is self--evident, and is also plain from the\ndefinition of desire.  For the desire of living, acting, &c.,\nblessedly or rightly, is (Def. of the Emotions, i.) the essence\nof man--that is (III. vii.), the endeavour made by everyone to\npreserve his own being.  Therefore, no one can desire, &c.\nQ.E.D.\nPROP. XXII.  No virtue can be conceived as prior to this\nendeavour to preserve one's own being.\nProof.--The effort for self--preservation is the essence of a\nthing (III. vii.); therefore, if any virtue could be conceived\nas prior thereto, the essence of a thing would have to be\nconceived as prior to itself, which is obviously absurd.\nTherefore no virtue, &c.  Q.E.D.\nCorollary.--The effort for self--preservation is the first and\nonly foundation of virtue.  For prior to this principle nothing\ncan be conceived, and without it no virtue can be conceived.\nPROP. XXIII.  Man, in so far as he is determined to a particular\naction because he has inadequate ideas, cannot be absolutely said\nto act in obedience to virtue; he can only be so described, in\nso far as he is determined for the action because he understands.\nProof.--In so far as a man is determined to an action through\nhaving inadequate ideas, he is passive (III. i.), that is (III.\nDeff. i., and iii.), he does something, which cannot be perceived\nsolely through his essence, that is (by IV. Def. viii.), which\ndoes not follow from his virtue.  But, in so far as he is\ndetermined for an action because he understands, he is active;\nthat is, he does something, which is perceived through his\nessence alone, or which adequately follows from his virtue.\nQ.E.D.\nPROP. XXIV.  To act absolutely in obedience to virtue is in us\nthe same thing as to act, to live, or to preserve one's being\n(these three terms are identical in meaning) in accordance with\nthe dictates of reason on the basis of seeking what is useful to\none's self.\nProof.--To act absolutely in obedience to virtue is nothing\nelse but to act according to the laws of one's own nature.  But\nwe only act, in so far as we understand (III. iii.): therefore\nto act in obedience to virtue is in us nothing else but to act,\nto live, or to preserve one's being in obedience to reason, and\nthat on the basis of seeking what is useful for us (IV. xxii.\nCoroll.).  Q.E.D.\nPROP. XXV.  No one wishes to preserve his being for the sake of\nanything else.\nProof.--The endeavour, wherewith everything endeavours to\npersist in its being, is defined solely by the essence of the\nthing itself (III. vii.); from this alone, and not from the\nessence of anything else, it necessarily follows (III. vi.) that\neveryone endeavours to preserve his being.  Moreover, this\nproposition is plain from IV. xxii. Coroll., for if a man should\nendeavour to preserve his being for the sake of anything else,\nthe last--named thing would obviously be the basis of virtue,\nwhich, by the foregoing corollary, is absurd.  Therefore no one,\n&c.  Q.E.D.\nPROP. XXVI.  Whatsoever we endeavour in obedience to reason is\nnothing further than to understand; neither does the mind, in so\nfar as it makes use of reason, judge anything to be useful to it,\nsave such things as are conducive to understanding.\nProof.--The effort for self--preservation is nothing else but\nthe essence of the thing in question (III. vii.), which, in so\nfar as it exists such as it is, is conceived to have force for\ncontinuing in existence (III. vi.) and doing such things as\nnecessarily follow from its given nature (see the Def. of\nAppetite, III. ix. note).  But the essence of reason is nought\nelse but our mind, in so far as it clearly and distinctly\nunderstands (see the definition in II. xl. note. ii.); therefore\n(II. xl.) whatsoever we endeavour in obedience to reason is\nnothing else but to understand.  Again, since this effort of the\nmind wherewith the mind endeavours, in so far as it reasons, to\npreserve its own being is nothing else but understanding; this\neffort at understanding is (IV. xxii. Coroll.) the first and\nsingle basis of virtue, nor shall we endeavour to understand\nthings for the sake of any ulterior object (IV. xxv.); on the\nother hand, the mind, in so far as it reasons, will not be able\nto conceive any good for itself, save such things as are\nconducive to understanding.\nPROP. XXVII.  We know nothing to be certainly good or evil, save\nsuch things as really conduce to understanding, or such as are\nable to hinder us from understanding.\nProof.--The mind, in so far as it reasons, desires nothing\nbeyond understanding, and judges nothing to be useful to itself,\nsave such things as conduce to understanding (by the foregoing\nProp.).  But the mind (II. xli., xliii. and note) cannot possess\ncertainty concerning anything, except in so far as it has\nadequate ideas, or (what by II. xl. note, is the same thing) in\nso far as it reasons.  Therefore we know nothing to be good or\nevil save such things as really conduce, &c.  Q.E.D.\nPROP. XXVIII.  The mind's highest good is the knowledge of God,\nand the mind's highest virtue is to know God.\nProof.--The mind is not capable of understanding anything\nhigher than God, that is (I. Def. vi.), than a Being absolutely\ninfinite, and without which (I. xv.) nothing can either be or be\nconceived; therefore (IV. xxvi. and xxvii.), the mind's highest\nutility or (IV. Def. i.) good is the knowledge of God.  Again,\nthe mind is active, only in so far as it understands, and only to\nthe same extent can it be said absolutely to act virtuously.  The\nmind's absolute virtue is therefore to understand.  Now, as we\nhave already shown, the highest that the mind can understand is\nGod; therefore the highest virtue of the mind is to understand\nor to know God.  Q.E.D.\nPROP. XXIX.  No individual thing, which is entirely different\nfrom our own nature, can help or check our power of activity, and\nabsolutely nothing can do us good or harm, unless it has\nsomething in common with our nature.\nProof.--The power of every individual thing, and consequently\nthe power of man, whereby he exists and operates, can only be\ndetermined by an individual thing (I. xxviii.), whose nature (II.\nvi.) must be understood through the same nature as that, through\nwhich human nature is conceived.  Therefore our power of\nactivity, however it be conceived, can be determined and\nconsequently helped or hindered by the power of any other\nindividual thing, which has something in common with us, but not\nby the power of anything, of which the nature is entirely\ndifferent from our own; and since we call good or evil that\nwhich is the cause of pleasure or pain (IV. viii.), that is (III.\nxi. note), which increases or diminishes, helps or hinders, our\npower of activity; therefore, that which is entirely different\nfrom our nature can neither be to us good nor bad.  Q.E.D.\nPROP. XXX.  A thing cannot be bad for us through the quality\nwhich it has in common with our nature, but it is bad for us in\nso far as it is contrary to our nature.\nProof.--We call a thing bad when it is the cause of pain (IV.\nviii.), that is (by the Def., which see in III. xi. note), when\nit diminishes or checks our power of action.  Therefore, if\nanything were bad for us through that quality which it has in\ncommon with our nature, it would be able itself to diminish or\ncheck that which it has in common with our nature, which (III.\niv.) is absurd.  Wherefore nothing can be bad for us through that\nquality which it has in common with us, but, on the other hand,\nin so far as it is bad for us, that is (as we have just shown),\nin so far as it can diminish or check our power of action, it is\ncontrary to our nature.\nQ.E.D.\nPROP. XXXI.  In so far as a thing is in harmony with our nature,\nit is necessarily good.\nProof.--In so far as a thing is in harmony with our nature, it\ncannot be bad for it.  It will therefore necessarily be either\ngood or indifferent.  If it be assumed that it be neither good\nnor bad, nothing will follow from its nature (IV. Def. i.), which\ntends to the preservation of our nature, that is (by the\nhypothesis), which tends to the preservation of the thing itself;\nbut this (III. vi.) is absurd; therefore, in so far as a thing\nis in harmony with our nature, it is necessarily good.  Q.E.D.\nCorollary.--Hence it follows, that, in proportion as a thing\nis in harmony with our nature, so is it more useful or better for\nus, and vice versa, in proportion as a thing is more useful for\nus, so is it more in harmony with our nature.  For, in so far as\nit is not in harmony with our nature, it will necessarily be\ndifferent therefrom or contrary thereto.  If different, it can\nneither be good nor bad (IV. xxix.); if contrary, it will be\ncontrary to that which is in harmony with our nature, that is,\ncontrary to what is good--in short, bad.  Nothing, therefore, can\nbe good, except in so far as it is in harmony with our nature;\nand hence a thing is useful, in proportion as it is in harmony\nwith our nature, and vice versa.  Q.E.D.\nPROP. XXXII.  In so far as men are a prey to passion, they\ncannot, in that respect, be said to be naturally in harmony.\nProof.--Things, which are said to be in harmony naturally, are\nunderstood to agree in power (III. vii.), not in want of power or\nnegation, and consequently not in passion (III. iii. note);\nwherefore men, in so far as they are a prey to their passions,\ncannot be said to be naturally in harmony.  Q.E.D.\nNote.--This is also self--evident; for, if we say that white\nand black only agree in the fact that neither is red, we\nabsolutely affirm that the do not agree in any respect.  So, if\nwe say that a man and a stone only agree in the fact that both\nare finite--wanting in power, not existing by the necessity of\ntheir own nature, or, lastly, indefinitely surpassed by the power\nof external causes--we should certainly affirm that a man and a\nstone are in no respect alike; therefore, things which agree\nonly in negation, or in qualities which neither possess, really\nagree in no respect.\nPROP. XXXIII.  Men can differ in nature, in so far as they are\nassailed by those emotions, which are passions, or passive states;\nand to this extent one and the same man is variable and\ninconstant.\nProof.--The nature or essence of the emotions cannot be explained\nsolely through our essence or nature (III. Deff. i., ii.), but\nit must be defined by the power, that is (III. vii.), by the\nnature of external causes in comparison with our own; hence it\nfollows, that there are as many kinds of each emotion as there\nare external objects whereby we are affected (III. lvi.), and\nthat men may be differently affected by one and the same\nobject (III. li.), and to this extent differ in nature; lastly,\nthat one and the same man may be differently affected towards\nthe same object, and may therefore be variable and\ninconstant.  Q.E.D.\nPROP. XXXIV.  In so far as men are assailed by emotions which are\npassions, they can be contrary one to another.\nProof.--A man, for instance Peter, can be the cause of Paul's\nfeeling pain, because he (Peter) possesses something similar to\nthat which Paul hates (III. xvi.), or because Peter has sole\npossession of a thing which Paul also loves (III. xxxii. and\nnote), or for other causes (of which the chief are enumerated in\nIII. lv. note); it may therefore happen that Paul should hate\nPeter (Def. of Emotions, vii.), consequently it may easily happen\nalso, that Peter should hate Paul in return, and that each should\nendeavour to do the other an injury, (III. xxxix.), that is (IV.\nxxx.), that they should be contrary one to another.  But the\nemotion of pain is always a passion or passive state (III. lix.);\nhence men, in so far as they are assailed by emotions which are\npassions, can be contrary one to another.  Q.E.D.\nNote.--I said that Paul may hate Peter, because he conceives\nthat Peter possesses something which he (Paul) also loves; from\nthis it seems, at first sight, to follow, that these two men,\nthrough both loving the same thing, and, consequently, through\nagreement of their respective natures, stand in one another's way;\nif this were so, Props. xxx. and xxxi. of this part would be\nuntrue.  But if we give the matter our unbiased attention, we\nshall see that the discrepancy vanishes.  For the two men are not\nin one another's way in virtue of the agreement of their natures,\nthat is, through both loving the same thing, but in virtue of one\ndiffering from the other.  For, in so far as each loves the same\nthing, the love of each is fostered thereby (III. xxxi.), that is\n(Def. of the Emotions, vi.) the pleasure of each is fostered\nthereby.  Wherefore it is far from being the case, that they are\nat variance through both loving the same thing, and through the\nagreement in their natures.  The cause for their opposition lies,\nas I have said, solely in the fact that they are assumed to\ndiffer.  For we assume that Peter has the idea of the loved\nobject as already in his possession, while Paul has the idea of\nthe loved object as lost.  Hence the one man will be affected\nwith pleasure, the other will be affected with pain, and thus\nthey will be at variance one with another.  We can easily show in\nlike manner, that all other causes of hatred depend solely on\ndifferences, and not on the agreement between men's natures.\nPROP. XXXV.  In so far only as men live in obedience to reason,\ndo they always necessarily agree in nature.\nProof.--In so far as men are assailed by emotions that are\npassions, they can be different in nature (IV. xxxiii.), and at\nvariance one with another.  But men are only said to be active,\nin so far as they act in obedience to reason (III. iii.);\ntherefore, what so ever follows from human nature in so far as it\nis defined by reason must (III. Def. ii.) be understood solely\nthrough human nature as its proximate cause.  But, since every\nman by the laws of his nature desires that which he deems good,\nand endeavours to remove that which he deems bad (IV. xix.); and\nfurther, since that which we, in accordance with reason, deem\ngood or bad, necessarily is good or bad (II. xli.); it follows\nthat men, in so far as they live in obedience to reason,\nnecessarily do only such things as are necessarily good for human\nnature, and consequently for each individual man (IV. xxxi.\nCoroll.); in other words, such things as are in harmony with\neach man's nature.  Therefore, men in so far as they live in\nobedience to reason, necessarily live always in harmony one with\nanother.  Q.E.D.\nCorollary I.--There is no individual thing in nature, which is\nmore useful to man, than a man who lives in obedience to reason.\nFor that thing is to man most useful, which is most in harmony\nwith his nature (IV. xxxi. Coroll.); that is, obviously, man.\nBut man acts absolutely according to the laws of his nature, when\nhe lives in obedience to reason (III. Def. ii.), and to this\nextent only is always necessarily in harmony with the nature of\nanother man (by the last Prop.); wherefore among individual\nthings nothing is more useful to man, than a man who lives in\nobedience to reason.  Q.E.D.\nCorollary II.--As every man seeks most that which is useful to\nhim, so are men most useful one to another.  For the more a man\nseeks what is useful to him and endeavours to preserve himself,\nthe more is he endowed with virtue (IV. xx.), or, what is the\nsame thing (IV. Def. viii.), the more is he endowed with power to\nact according to the laws of his own nature, that is to live in\nobedience to reason.  But men are most in natural harmony, when\nthey live in obedience to reason (by the last Prop.); therefore\n(by the foregoing Coroll.) men will be most useful one to\nanother, when each seeks most that which is useful to him.\nQ.E.D.\nNote.--What we have just shown is attested by experience so\nconspicuously, that it is in the mouth of nearly everyone: \"Man\nis to man a God.\"  Yet it rarely happens that men live in\nobedience to reason, for things are so ordered among them, that\nthey are generally envious and troublesome one to another.\nNevertheless they are scarcely able to lead a solitary life, so\nthat the definition of man as a social animal has met with\ngeneral assent; in fact, men do derive from social life much\nmore convenience than injury.  Let satirists then laugh their\nfill at human affairs, let theologians rail, and let misanthropes\npraise to their utmost the life of untutored rusticity, let them\nheap contempt on men and praises on beasts; when all is said,\nthey will find that men can provide for their wants much more\neasily by mutual help, and that only by uniting their forces can\nthey escape from the dangers that on every side beset them: not\nto say how much more excellent and worthy of our knowledge it is,\nto study the actions of men than the actions of beasts.  But I\nwill treat of this more at length elsewhere.\nPROP. XXXVI.  The highest good of those who follow virtue is\ncommon to all, and therefore all can equally rejoice therein.\nProof.--To act virtuously is to act in obedience with reason\n(IV. xxiv.), and whatsoever we endeavour to do in obedience to\nreason is to understand (IV. xxvi.); therefore (IV. xxviii.) the\nhighest good for those who follow after virtue is to know God;\nthat is (II. xlvii. and note) a good which is common to all and\ncan be possessed by all men equally, in so far as they are of\nthe same nature.  Q.E.D.\nNote.--Someone may ask how it would be, if the highest good of\nthose who follow after virtue were not common to all?  Would it\nnot then follow, as above (IV. xxxiv.), that men living in\nobedience to reason, that is (IV. xxxv.), men in so far as they\nagree in nature, would be at variance one with another?  To such\nan inquiry, I make answer, that it follows not accidentally but\nfrom the very nature of reason, that main's highest good is\ncommon to all, inasmuch as it is deduced from the very essence of\nman, in so far as defined by reason; and that a man could\nneither be, nor be conceived without the power of taking pleasure\nin this highest good.  For it belongs to the essence of the human\nmind (II. xlvii.), to have an adequate knowledge of the eternal\nand infinite essence of God.\nPROP. XXXVII.  The good which every man, who follows after\nvirtue, desires for himself he will also desire for other men,\nand so much the more, in proportion as he has a greater knowledge\nof God.\nProof.--Men, in so far as they live in obedience to reason,\nare most useful to their fellow men (IV. xxxv; Coroll. i.);\ntherefore (IV. xix.), we shall in obedience to reason necessarily\nendeavour to bring about that men should live in obedience to\nreason.  But the good which every man, in so far as he is guided\nby reason, or, in other words, follows after virtue, desires for\nhimself, is to understand (IV. xxvi.); wherefore the good, which\neach follower of virtue seeks for himself, he will desire also\nfor others.  Again, desire, in so far as it is referred to the\nmind, is the very essence of the mind (Def. of the Emotions, i.);\nnow the essence of the mind consists in knowledge (II. xi.),\nwhich involves the knowledge of God (II. xlvii.), and without it\n(I. xv.), can neither be, nor be conceived; therefore, in\nproportion as the mind's essence involves a greater knowledge of\nGod, so also will be greater the desire of the follower of\nvirtue, that other men should possess that which he seeks as good\nfor himself.  Q.E.D.\nAnother Proof.--The good, which a man desires for himself and\nloves, he will love more constantly, if he sees that others love\nit also (III. xxxi.); he will therefore endeavour that others\nshould love it also; and as the good in question is common to\nall, and therefore all can rejoice therein, he will endeavour,\nfor the same reason, to bring about that all should rejoice\ntherein, and this he will do the more (III. xxxvii.), in\nproportion as his own enjoyment of the good is greater.\nNote I.--He who, guided by emotion only, endeavours to cause\nothers to love what he loves himself, and to make the rest of the\nworld live according to his own fancy, acts solely by impulse,\nand is, therefore, hateful, especially, to those who take delight\nin something different, and accordingly study and, by similar\nimpulse, endeavour, to make men live in accordance with what\npleases themselves.  Again, as the highest good sought by men\nunder the guidance of emotion is often such, that it can only be\npossessed by a single individual, it follows that those who love\nit are not consistent in their intentions, but, while they\ndelight to sing its praises, fear to be believed.  But he, who\nendeavours to lead men by reason, does not act by impulse but\ncourteously and kindly, and his intention is always consistent.\nAgain, whatsoever we desire and do, whereof we are the cause in\nso far as we possess the idea of God, or know God, I set down to\nReligion.  The desire of well--doing, which is engendered by a\nlife according to reason, I call piety.  Further, the desire,\nwhereby a man living according to reason is bound to associate\nothers with himself in friendship, I call honour[13]; by\nhonourable I mean that which is praised by men living according\nto reason, and by base I mean that which is repugnant to the\ngaining of friendship.  I have also shown in addition what are\nthe foundations of a state; and the difference between true\nvirtue and infirmity may be readily gathered from what I have\nsaid; namely, that true virtue is nothing else but living in\naccordance with reason; while infirmity is nothing else but\nman's allowing himself to be led by things which are external to\nhimself, and to be by them determined to act in a manner demanded\nby the general disposition of things rather than by his own\nnature considered solely in itself.\n[13] Honestas\nSuch are the matters which I engaged to prove in Prop. xviii.\nof this Part, whereby it is plain that the law against the\nslaughtering of animals is founded rather on vain superstition\nand womanish pity than on sound reason.  The rational quest of\nwhat is useful to us further teaches us the necessity of\nassociating ourselves with our fellow men, but not with beasts,\nor things, whose nature is different from our own; we have the\nsame rights in respect to them as they have in respect to us.\nNay, as everyone's right is defined by his virtue, or power, men\nhave far greater rights over beasts than beasts have over men.\nStill I do not deny that beasts feel: what I deny is, that we\nmay not consult our own advantage and use them as we please,\ntreating them in the way which best suits us; for their nature\nis not like ours, and their emotions are naturally different from\nhuman emotions (III. lvii. note).  It remains for me to explain\nwhat I mean by just and unjust, sin and merit.  On these points\nsee the following note.\nNote II.--In the Appendix to Part I. I undertook to explain\npraise and blame, merit and sin, justice and injustice.\nConcerning praise and blame I have spoken in III. xxix. note:\nthe time has now come to treat of the remaining terms.  But I\nmust first say a few words concerning man in the state of nature\nand in society.\nEvery man exists by sovereign natural right, and,\nconsequently, by sovereign natural right performs those actions\nwhich follow from the necessity of his own nature; therefore by\nsovereign natural right every man judges what is good and what is\nbad, takes care of his own advantage according to his own\ndisposition (IV. xix. and IV. xx.), avenges the wrongs done to\nhim (III. xl. Coroll. ii.), and endeavours to preserve that which\nhe loves and to destroy that which he hates (III. xxviii.).  Now,\nif men lived under the guidance of reason, everyone would remain\nin possession of this his right, without any injury being done to\nhis neighbour (IV. xxxv. Coroll. i.).  But seeing that they are a\nprey to their emotions, which far surpass human power or virtue\n(IV. vi.), they are often drawn in different directions, and\nbeing at variance one with another (IV. xxxiii. xxxiv.), stand in\nneed of mutual help (IV. xxxv. note).  Wherefore, in order that\nmen may live together in harmony, and may aid one another, it is\nnecessary that they should forego their natural right, and, for\nthe sake of security, refrain from all actions which can injure\ntheir fellow--men.  The way in which this end can be obtained, so\nthat men who are necessarily a prey to their emotions (IV. iv.\nCoroll.), inconstant, and diverse, should be able to render each\nother mutually secure, and feel mutual trust, is evident from IV.\nvii. and III. xxxix.  It is there shown, that an emotion can only\nbe restrained by an emotion stronger than, and contrary to\nitself, and that men avoid inflicting injury through fear of\nincurring a greater injury themselves.\nOn this law society can be established, so long as it keeps\nin its own hand the right, possessed by everyone, of avenging\ninjury, and pronouncing on good and evil; and provided it also\npossesses the power to lay down a general rule of conduct, and to\npass laws sanctioned, not by reason, which is powerless in\nrestraining emotion, but by threats (IV. xvii. note).  Such a\nsociety established with laws and the power of preserving itself\nis called a State, while those who live under its protection are\ncalled citizens.  We may readily understand that there is in the\nstate of nature nothing, which by universal consent is pronounced\ngood or bad; for in the state of nature everyone thinks solely\nof his own advantage, and according to his disposition, with\nreference only to his individual advantage, decides what is good\nor bad, being bound by no law to anyone besides himself.\nIn the state of nature, therefore, sin is inconceivable; it\ncan only exist in a state, where good and evil are pronounced on\nby common consent, and where everyone is bound to obey the State\nauthority.  Sin, then, is nothing else but disobedience, which is\ntherefore punished by the right of the State only.  Obedience, on\nthe other hand, is set down as merit, inasmuch as a man is\nthought worthy of merit, if he takes delight in the advantages\nwhich a State provides.\nAgain, in the state of nature, no one is by common consent\nmaster of anything, nor is there anything in nature, which can be\nsaid to belong to one man rather than another: all things are\ncommon to all.  Hence, in the state of nature, we can conceive no\nwish to render to every man his own, or to deprive a man of that\nwhich belongs to him; in other words, there is nothing in the\nstate of nature answering to justice and injustice.  Such ideas\nare only possible in a social state, when it is decreed by common\nconsent what belongs to one man and what to another.\nFrom all these considerations it is evident, that justice and\ninjustice, sin and merit, are extrinsic ideas, and not attributes\nwhich display the nature of the mind.  But I have said enough.\nPROP. XXXVIII.  Whatsoever disposes the human body, so as to\nrender it capable of being affected in an increased number of\nways, or of affecting external bodies in an increased number of\nways, is useful to man; and is so, in proportion as the body is\nthereby rendered more capable of being affected or affecting\nother bodies in an increased number of ways; contrariwise,\nwhatsoever renders the body less capable in this respect is\nhurtful to man.\nProof.--Whatsoever thus increases the capabilities of the body\nincreases also the mind's capability of perception (II. xiv.);\ntherefore, whatsoever thus disposes the body and thus renders it\ncapable, is necessarily good or useful (IV. xxvi. xxvii.); and\nis so in proportion to the extent to which it can render the body\ncapable; contrariwise (II. xiv., IV. xxvi. xxvii.), it is\nhurtful, if it renders the body in this respect less capable.\nQ.E.D.\nPROP. XXXIX.  Whatsoever brings about the preservation of the\nproportion of motion and rest, which the parts of the human body\nmutually possess, is good; contrariwise, whatsoever causes a\nchange in such proportion is bad.\nProof.--The human body needs many other bodies for its\npreservation (II. Post. iv.).  But that which constitutes the\nspecific reality (forma) of a human body is, that its parts\ncommunicate their several motions one to another in a certain\nfixed proportion (Def. before Lemma iv. after II. xiii.).\nTherefore, whatsoever brings about the preservation of the\nproportion between motion and rest, which the parts of the human\nbody mutually possess, preserves the specific reality of the\nhuman body, and consequently renders the human body capable of\nbeing affected in many ways and of affecting external bodies in\nmany ways; consequently it is good (by the last Prop.).  Again,\nwhatsoever brings about a change in the aforesaid proportion\ncauses the human body to assume another specific character, in\nother words (see Preface to this Part towards the end, though the\npoint is indeed self--evident), to be destroyed, and consequently\ntotally incapable of being affected in an increased numbers of\nways; therefore it is bad.  Q.E.D.\nNote.--The extent to which such causes can injure or be of\nservice to the mind will be explained in the Fifth Part.  But I\nwould here remark that I consider that a body undergoes death,\nwhen the proportion of motion and rest which obtained mutually\namong its several parts is changed.  For I do not venture to deny\nthat a human body, while keeping the circulation of the blood and\nother properties, wherein the life of a body is thought to\nconsist, may none the less be changed into another nature totally\ndifferent from its own.  There is no reason, which compels me to\nmaintain that a body does not die, unless it becomes a corpse;\nnay, experience would seem to point to the opposite conclusion.\nIt sometimes happens, that a man undergoes such changes, that I\nshould hardly call him the same.  As I have heard tell of a\ncertain Spanish poet, who had been seized with sickness, and\nthough he recovered therefrom yet remained so oblivious of his\npast life, that he would not believe the plays and tragedies he\nhad written to be his own: indeed, he might have been taken for\na grown--up child, if he had also forgotten his native tongue.  If\nthis instance seems incredible, what shall we say of infants? A\nman of ripe age deems their nature so unlike his own, that he can\nonly be persuaded that he too has been an infant by the analogy\nof other men.  However, I prefer to leave such questions\nundiscussed, lest I should give ground to the superstitious for\nraising new issues.\nPROP. XL.  Whatsoever conduces to man's social life, or causes\nmen to live together in harmony, is useful, whereas whatsoever\nbrings discord into a State is bad.\nProof.--For whatsoever causes men to live together in harmony\nalso causes them to live according to reason (IV. xxxv.), and is\ntherefore (IV. xxvi. xxvii.) good, and (for the same reason)\nwhatsoever brings about discord is bad.  Q.E.D.\nPROP. XLI.  Pleasure in itself is not bad but good:\ncontrariwise, pain in itself is bad.\nProof.--Pleasure (III. xi. and note) is emotion, whereby the\nbody's power of activity is increased or helped; pain is\nemotion, whereby the body's power of activity is diminished or\nchecked; therefore (IV. xxxviii.) pleasure in itself is good,\n&c.  Q.E.D.\nPROP. XLII.  Mirth cannot be excessive, but is always good;\ncontrariwise, Melancholy is always bad.\nProof.--Mirth (see its Def. in III. xi. note) is pleasure,\nwhich, in so far as it is referred to the body, consists in all\nparts of the body being affected equally: that is (III. xi.),\nthe body's power of activity is increased or aided in such a\nmanner, that the several parts maintain their former proportion\nof motion and rest; therefore Mirth is always good (IV. xxxix.),\nand cannot be excessive.  But Melancholy (see its Def. in the\nsame note to III. xi.) is pain, which, in so far as it is\nreferred to the body, consists in the absolute decrease or\nhindrance of the body's power of activity; therefore (IV.\nxxxviii.) it is always bad.  Q.E.D.\nPROP. XLIII.  Stimulation may be excessive and bad; on the other\nhand, grief may be good, in so far as stimulation or pleasure is\nbad.\nProof.--Localized pleasure or stimulation (titillatio) is\npleasure, which, in so far as it is referred to the body,\nconsists in one or some of its parts being affected more than the\nrest (see its Definition, III. xi. note); the power of this\nemotion may be sufficient to overcome other actions of the body\n(IV. vi.), and may remain obstinately fixed therein, thus\nrendering it incapable of being affected in a variety of other\nways: therefore (IV. xxxviii.) it may be bad.  Again, grief,\nwhich is pain, cannot as such be good (IV. xli.).  But, as its\nforce and increase is defined by the power of an external cause\ncompared with our own (IV. v.), we can conceive infinite degrees\nand modes of strength in this emotion (IV. iii.); we can,\ntherefore, conceive it as capable of restraining stimulation, and\npreventing its becoming excessive, and hindering the body's\ncapabilities; thus, to this extent, it will be good.  Q.E.D.\nPROP. XLIV.  Love and desire may be excessive.\nProof.--Love is pleasure, accompanied by the idea of an\nexternal cause (Def. of Emotions, vi.); therefore stimulation,\naccompanied by the idea of an external cause is love (III. xi.\nnote); hence love maybe excessive.  Again, the strength of\ndesire varies in proportion to the emotion from which it arises\n(III. xxxvii.).  Now emotion may overcome all the rest of men's\nactions (IV. vi.); so, therefore, can desire, which arises from\nthe same emotion, overcome all other desires, and become\nexcessive, as we showed in the last proposition concerning\nstimulation.\nNote.--Mirth, which I have stated to be good, can be conceived\nmore easily than it can be observed.  For the emotions, whereby\nwe are daily assailed, are generally referred to some part of the\nbody which is affected more than the rest; hence the emotions\nare generally excessive, and so fix the mind in the contemplation\nof one object, that it is unable to think of others; and\nalthough men, as a rule, are a prey to many emotions--and very few\nare found who are always assailed by one and the same--yet there\nare cases, where one and the same emotion remains obstinately\nfixed.  We sometimes see men so absorbed in one object, that,\nalthough it be not present, they think they have it before them;\nwhen this is the case with a man who is not asleep, we say he is\ndelirious or mad; nor are those persons who are inflamed with\nlove, and who dream all night and all day about nothing but their\nmistress, or some woman, considered as less mad, for they are\nmade objects of ridicule.  But when a miser thinks of nothing but\ngain or money, or when an ambitious man thinks of nothing but\nglory, they are not reckoned to be mad, because they are\ngenerally harmful, and are thought worthy of being hated.  But,\nin reality, Avarice, Ambition, Lust, &c., are species of madness,\nthough they may not be reckoned among diseases.\nPROP. XLV.  Hatred can never be good.\nProof.--When we hate a man, we endeavour to destroy him (III.\nxxxix.), that is (IV. xxxvii.), we endeavour to do something that\nis bad.  Therefore, &c.  Q.E.D.\nN.B.  Here, and in what follows, I mean by hatred only hatred\ntowards men.\nCorollary I.--Envy, derision, contempt, anger, revenge, and\nother emotions attributable to hatred, or arising therefrom, are\nbad; this is evident from III. xxxix. and IV. xxxvii.\nCorollary II.--Whatsoever we desire from motives of hatred is\nbase, and in a State unjust.  This also is evident from III.\nxxxix., and from the definitions of baseness and injustice in IV.\nxxxvii. note.\nNote.--Between derision (which I have in Coroll. I. stated to\nbe bad) and laughter I recognize a great difference.  For\nlaughter, as also jocularity, is merely pleasure; therefore, so\nlong as it be not excessive, it is in itself good (IV. xli.).\nAssuredly nothing forbids man to enjoy himself, save grim and\ngloomy superstition.  For why is it more lawful to satiate one's\nhunger and thirst than to drive away one's melancholy? I reason,\nand have convinced myself as follows: No deity, nor anyone else,\nsave the envious, takes pleasure in my infirmity and discomfort,\nnor sets down to my virtue the tears, sobs, fear, and the like,\nwhich axe signs of infirmity of spirit; on the contrary, the\ngreater the pleasure wherewith we are affected, the greater the\nperfection whereto we pass; in other words, the more must we\nnecessarily partake of the divine nature.  Therefore, to make use\nof what comes in our way, and to enjoy it as much as possible\n(not to the point of satiety, for that would not be enjoyment) is\nthe part of a wise man.  I say it is the part of a wise man to\nrefresh and recreate himself with moderate and pleasant food and\ndrink, and also with perfumes, with the soft beauty of growing\nplants, with dress, with music, with many sports, with theatres,\nand the like, such as every man may make use of without injury to\nhis neighbour.  For the human body is composed of very numerous\nparts, of diverse nature, which continually stand in need of\nfresh and varied nourishment, so that the whole body may be\nequally capable of performing all the actions, which follow from\nthe necessity of its own nature; and, consequently, so that the\nmind may also be equally capable of understanding many things\nsimultaneously.  This way of life, then, agrees best with our\nprinciples, and also with general practice; therefore, if there\nbe any question of another plan, the plan we have mentioned is\nthe best, and in every way to be commended.  There is no need for\nme to set forth the matter more clearly or in more detail.\nPROP. XLVI.  He, who lives under the guidance of reason,\nendeavours, as far as possible, to render back love, or kindness,\nfor other men's hatred, anger, contempt, &c., towards him.\nProof.--All emotions of hatred are bad (IV. xlv. Coroll. i.);\ntherefore he who lives under the guidance of reason will\nendeavour, as far as possible, to avoid being assailed by such\nemotions (IV. xix.); consequently, he will also endeavour to\nprevent others being so assailed (IV. xxxvii.).  But hatred is\nincreased by being reciprocated, and can be quenched by love\n(III. xliii.), so that hatred may pass into love (III. xliv.);\ntherefore he who lives under the guidance of reason will\nendeavour to repay hatred with love, that is, with kindness.\nQ.E.D.\nNote.--He who chooses to avenge wrongs with hatred is\nassuredly wretched.  But he, who strives to conquer hatred with\nlove, fights his battle in joy and confidence; he withstands\nmany as easily as one, and has very little need of fortune's aid.\nThose whom he vanquishes yield joyfully, not through failure, but\nthrough increase in their powers; all these consequences follow\nso plainly from the mere definitions of love and understanding,\nthat I have no need to prove them in detail.\nPROP. XLVII.  Emotions of hope and fear cannot be in themselves\ngood.\nProof.--Emotions of hope and fear cannot exist without pain.\nFor fear is pain (Def. of the Emotions, xiii.), and hope (Def. of\nthe Emotions, Explanation xii. and xiii.) cannot exist without\nfear; therefore (IV. xli.) these emotions cannot be good in\nthemselves, but only in so far as they can restrain excessive\npleasure (IV. xliii.).  Q.E.D.\nNote.--We may add, that these emotions show defective\nknowledge and an absence of power in the mind; for the same\nreason confidence, despair, joy, and disappointment are signs of\na want of mental power.  For although confidence and joy are\npleasurable emotions, they nevertheless imply a preceding pain,\nnamely, hope and fear.  Wherefore the more we endeavour to be\nguided by reason, the less do we depend on hope; we endeavour to\nfree ourselves from fear, and, as far as we can, to dominate\nfortune, directing our actions by the sure counsels of wisdom.\nPROP. XLVIII.  The emotions of over--esteem and disparagement are\nalways bad.\nProof.--These emotions (see Def. of the Emotions, xxi. xxii.)\nare repugnant to reason; and are therefore (IV. xxvi. xxvii.)\nbad.  Q.E.D.\nPROP. XLIX.  Over--esteem is apt to render its object proud.\nProof.--If we see that any one rates us too highly, for love's\nsake, we are apt to become elated (III. xli.), or to be\npleasurably affected (Def. of the Emotions, xxx.); the good\nwhich we hear of ourselves we readily believe (III. xxv.); and\ntherefore, for love's sake, rate ourselves too highly; in other\nwords, we are apt to become proud.  Q.E.D.\nPROP. L.  Pity, in a man who lives under the guidance of reason,\nis in itself bad and useless.\nProof.--Pity (Def. of the Emotions, xviii.) is a pain, and\ntherefore (IV. xli.) is in itself bad.  The good effect which\nfollows, namely, our endeavour to free the object of our pity\nfrom misery, is an action which we desire to do solely at the\ndictation of reason (IV. xxxvii.); only at the dictation of\nreason are we able to perform any action, which we know for\ncertain to be good (IV. xxvii.); thus, in a man who lives under\nthe guidance of reason, pity in itself is useless and bad.\nQ.E.D.\nNote.--He who rightly realizes, that all things follow from\nthe necessity of the divine nature, and come to pass in\naccordance with the eternal laws and rules of nature, will not\nfind anything worthy of hatred, derision, or contempt, nor will\nhe bestow pity on anything, but to the utmost extent of human\nvirtue he will endeavour to do well, as the saying is, and to\nrejoice.  We may add, that he, who is easily touched with\ncompassion, and is moved by another's sorrow or tears, often does\nsomething which he afterwards regrets; partly because we can\nnever be sure that an action caused by emotion is good, partly\nbecause we are easily deceived by false tears.  I am in this\nplace expressly speaking of a man living under the guidance of\nreason.  He who is moved to help others neither by reason nor by\ncompassion, is rightly styled inhuman, for (III. xxvii.) he seems\nunlike a man.\nPROP. LI.  Approval is not repugnant to reason, but can agree\ntherewith and arise therefrom.\nProof.--Approval is love towards one who has done good to\nanother (Def. of the Emotions, xix.); therefore it may be\nreferred to the mind, in so far as the latter is active (III.\nlix.), that is (III. iii.), in so far as it understands;\ntherefore, it is in agreement with reason, &c.  Q.E.D.\nAnother Proof.--He, who lives under the guidance of reason,\ndesires for others the good which he seeks for himself (IV.\nxxxvii.); wherefore from seeing someone doing good to his fellow\nhis own endeavour to do good is aided; in other words, he will\nfeel pleasure (III. xi. note) accompanied by the idea of the\nbenefactor.  Therefore he approves of him.  Q.E.D.\nNote.--Indignation as we defined it (Def. of the Emotions,\nxx.) is necessarily evil (IV. xlv.); we may, however, remark\nthat, when the sovereign power for the sake of preserving peace\npunishes a citizen who has injured another, it should not be said\nto be indignant with the criminal, for it is not incited by\nhatred to ruin him, it is led by a sense of duty to punish him.\nPROP. LII.  Self--approval may arise from reason, and that which\narises from reason is the highest possible.\nProof.--Self--approval is pleasure arising from a man's\ncontemplation of himself and his own power of action (Def. of the\nEmotions, xxv.).  But a man's true power of action or virtue is\nreason herself (III. iii.), as the said man clearly and\ndistinctly contemplates her (II. xl. xliii.); therefore\nself--approval arises from reason.  Again, when a man is\ncontemplating himself, he only perceived clearly and distinctly\nor adequately, such things as follow from his power of action\n(III. Def. ii.), that is (III. iii.), from his power of\nunderstanding; therefore in such contemplation alone does the\nhighest possible self--approval arise.  Q.E.D.\nNote.--Self--approval is in reality the highest object for\nwhich we can hope.  For (as we showed in IV. xxv.) no one\nendeavours to preserve his being for the sake of any ulterior\nobject, and, as this approval is more and more fostered and\nstrengthened by praise (III. liii. Coroll.), and on the contrary\n(III. lv. Coroll.) is more and more disturbed by blame, fame\nbecomes the most powerful of incitements to action, and life\nunder disgrace is almost unendurable.\nPROP. LIII.  Humility is not a virtue, or does not arise from\nreason.\nProof.--Humility is pain arising from a man's contemplation of\nhis own infirmities (Def. of the Emotions, xxvi.).  But, in so\nfar as a man knows himself by true reason, he is assumed to\nunderstand his essence, that is, his power (III. vii.).\nWherefore, if a man in self--contemplation perceives any infirmity\nin himself, it is not by virtue of his understanding himself, but\n(III. lv.) by virtue of his power of activity being checked.\nBut, if we assume that a man perceives his own infirmity by\nvirtue of understanding something stronger than himself, by the\nknowledge of which he determines his own power of activity, this\nis the same as saying that we conceive that a man understands\nhimself distinctly (IV. xxvi.), because[14] his power of activity\nis aided.  Wherefore humility, or the pain which arises from a\nman's contemplation of his own infirmity, does not arise from the\ncontemplation or reason, and is not a virtue but a passion.\nQ.E.D.\n[14] Land reads: \"Quod ipsius agendi potentia juvatur\"--which I\nhave translated above.  He suggests as alternative readings to\n'quod', 'quo' (= whereby) and 'quodque' (= and that).\nPROP. LIV.  Repentance is not a virtue, or does not arise from\nreason; but he who repents of an action is doubly wretched or\ninfirm.\nProof.--The first part of this proposition is proved like the\nforegoing one.  The second part is proved from the mere\ndefinition of the emotion in question (Def. of the Emotions,\nxxvii.).  For the man allows himself to be overcome, first, by\nevil desires; secondly, by pain.\nNote.--As men seldom live under the guidance of reason, these\ntwo emotions, namely, Humility and Repentance, as also Hope and\nFear, bring more good than harm; hence, as we must sin, we had\nbetter sin in that direction.  For, if all men who are a prey to\nemotion were all equally proud, they would shrink from nothing,\nand would fear nothing; how then could they be joined and linked\ntogether in bonds of union?  The crowd plays the tyrant, when it\nis not in fear; hence we need not wonder that the prophets, who\nconsulted the good, not of a few, but of all, so strenuously\ncommended Humility, Repentance, and Reverence.  Indeed those who\nare a prey to these emotions may be led much more easily than\nothers to live under the guidance of reason, that is, to become\nfree and to enjoy the life of the blessed.\nPROP. LV.  Extreme pride or dejection indicates extreme ignorance\nof self.\nProof.--This is evident from Def. of the Emotions, xxviii. and\nxxix.\nPROP. LVI.  Extreme pride or dejection indicates extreme\ninfirmity of spirit.\nProof.--The first foundation of virtue is self--preservation\n(IV. xxii. Coroll.) under the guidance of reason (IV. xxiv.).\nHe, therefore, who is ignorant of himself, is ignorant of the\nfoundation of all virtues, and consequently of all virtues.\nAgain, to act virtuously is merely to act under the guidance of\nreason (IV. xxiv.): now he, that acts under the guidance of\nreason, must necessarily know that he so acts (II. xliii.).\nTherefore he who is in extreme ignorance of himself, and\nconsequently of all virtues, acts least in obedience to virtue;\nin other words (IV. Def. viii.), is most infirm of spirit.  Thus\nextreme pride or dejection indicates extreme infirmity of spirit.\nQ.E.D.\nCorollary.--Hence it most clearly follows, that the proud and\nthe dejected specially fall a prey to the emotions.\nNote.--Yet dejection can be more easily corrected than pride;\nfor the latter being a pleasurable emotion, and the former a\npainful emotion, the pleasurable is stronger than the painful\n(IV. xviii.).\nPROP. LVII.  The proud man delights in the company of flatterers\nand parasites, but hates the company of the high--minded.\nProof.--Pride is pleasure arising from a man's over estimation\nof himself (Def. of the Emotions, xxviii. and vi.); this\nestimation the proud man will endeavour to foster by all the\nmeans in his power (III. xiii. note); he will therefore delight\nin the company of flatterers and parasites (whose character is\ntoo well known to need definition here), and will avoid the\ncompany of high--minded men, who value him according to his\ndeserts.  Q.E.D.\nNote.--It would be too long a task to enumerate here all the\nevil results of pride, inasmuch as the proud are a prey to all\nthe emotions, though to none of them less than to love and pity.\nI cannot, however, pass over in silence the fact, that a man may\nbe called proud from his underestimation of other people; and,\ntherefore, pride in this sense may be defined as pleasure arising\nfrom the false opinion, whereby a man may consider himself\nsuperior to his fellows.  The dejection, which is the opposite\nquality to this sort of pride, may be defined as pain arising\nfrom the false opinion, whereby a man may think himself inferior\nto his fellows.  Such being the ease, we can easily see that a\nproud man is necessarily envious (III. xli. note), and only takes\npleasure in the company, who fool his weak mind to the top of his\nbent, and make him insane instead of merely foolish.\nThough dejection is the emotion contrary to pride, yet is the\ndejected man very near akin to the proud man.  For, inasmuch as\nhis pain arises from a comparison between his own infirmity and\nother men's power or virtue, it will be removed, or, in other\nwords, he will feel pleasure, if his imagination be occupied in\ncontemplating other men's faults; whence arises the proverb,\n\"The unhappy are comforted by finding fellow--sufferers.\"\nContrariwise, he will be the more pained in proportion as he\nthinks himself inferior to others; hence none are so prone to\nenvy as the dejected, they are specially keen in observing men's\nactions, with a view to fault--finding rather than correction, in\norder to reserve their praises for dejection, and to glory\ntherein, though all the time with a dejected air.  These effects\nfollow as necessarily from the said emotion, as it follows from\nthe nature of a triangle, that the three angles are equal to two\nright angles.  I have already said that I call these and similar\nemotions bad, solely in respect to what is useful to man.  The\nlaws of nature have regard to nature's general order, whereof man\nis but a part.  I mention this, in passing, lest any should think\nthat I have wished to set forth the faults and irrational deeds\nof men rather than the nature and properties of things.  For, as\nI said in the preface to the third Part, I regard human emotions\nand their properties as on the same footing with other natural\nphenomena.  Assuredly human emotions indicate the power and\ningenuity, of nature, if not of human nature, quite as fully as\nother things which we admire, and which we delight to\ncontemplate.  But I pass on to note those qualities in the\nemotions, which bring advantage to man, or inflict injury upon\nhim.\nPROP. LVIII.  Honour (gloria) is not repugnant to reason, but may\narise therefrom.\nProof.--This is evident from Def. of the Emotions, xxx., and\nalso from the definition of an honourable man (IV. xxxvii. note.\ni.).\nNote--Empty honour, as it is styled, is self--approval,\nfostered only by the good opinion of the populace; when this\ngood opinion ceases there ceases also the self--approval, in other\nwords, the highest object of each man's love (IV. lii. note);\nconsequently, he whose honour is rooted in popular approval must,\nday by day, anxiously strive, act, and scheme in order to retain\nhis reputation.  For the populace is variable and inconstant, so\nthat, if a reputation be not kept up, it quickly withers away.\nEveryone wishes to catch popular applause for himself, and\nreadily represses the fame of others.  The object of the strife\nbeing estimated as the greatest of all goods, each combatant is\nseized with a fierce desire to put down his rivals in every\npossible way, till he who at last comes out victorious is more\nproud of having done harm to others than of having done good to\nhimself.  This sort of honour, then, is really empty, being\nnothing.\nThe points to note concerning shame may easily be inferred\nfrom what was said on the subject of mercy and repentance.  I\nwill only add that shame, like compassion, though not a virtue,\nis yet good, in so far as it shows, that the feeler of shame is\nreally imbued with the desire to live honourably; in the same\nway as suffering is good, as showing that the injured part is not\nmortified.  Therefore, though a man who feels shame is sorrowful,\nhe is yet more perfect than he, who is shameless, and has no\ndesire to live honourably.\nSuch are the points which I undertook to remark upon\nconcerning the emotions of pleasure and pain; as for the\ndesires, they are good or bad according as they spring from good\nor evil emotions.  But all, in so far as they are engendered in\nus by emotions wherein the mind is passive, are blind (as is\nevident from what was said in IV. xliv. note), and would be\nuseless, if men could easily, be induced to live by the guidance\nof reason only, as I will now briefly, show.\nPROP. LIX.  To all the actions, whereto we are determined by\nemotion wherein the mind is passive; we can be determined\nwithout emotion by reason.\nProof.--To act rationally, is nothing else (III. iii. and Def.\nii.) but to perform those actions, which follow from the\nnecessity, of our nature considered in itself alone.  But pain is\nbad, in so far as it diminishes or checks the power of action\n(IV. xli.); wherefore we cannot by pain be determined to any\naction, which we should be unable to perform under the guidance\nof reason.  Again, pleasure is bad only in so far as it hinders a\nman's capability for action (IV. xli. xliii.); therefore to this\nextent we could not be determined by it to any action, which we\ncould not perform under the guidance of reason.  Lastly,\npleasure, in so far as it is good, is in harmony with reason (for\nit consists in the fact that a man's capability for action is\nincreased or aided); nor is the mind passive therein, except in\nso far as a man's power of action is not increased to the extent\nof affording him an adequate conception of himself and his\nactions (III. iii., and note).\nWherefore, if a man who is pleasurably affected be brought to\nsuch a state of perfection, that he gains an adequate conception\nof himself and his own actions, he will be equally, nay more,\ncapable of those actions, to which he is determined by emotion\nwherein the mind is passive.  But all emotions are attributable\nto pleasure, to pain, or to desire (Def. of the Emotions, iv.\nexplanation); and desire (Def. of the Emotions, i.) is nothing\nelse but the attempt to act; therefore, to all actions, &c.\nQ.E.D.\nAnother Proof.--A given action is called bad, in so far as it\narises from one being affected by hatred or any evil emotion.\nBut no action, considered in itself alone, is either good or bad\n(as we pointed out in the preface to Pt. IV.), one and the same\naction being sometimes good, sometimes bad; wherefore to the\naction which is sometimes bad, or arises from some evil emotion,\nwe may be led by reason (IV. xix.).  Q.E.D.\nNote.--An example will put this point in a clearer light.  The\naction of striking, in so far as it is considered physically, and\nin so far as we merely look to the fact that a man raises his\narm, clenches his fist, and moves his whole arm violently\ndownwards, is a virtue or excellence which is conceived as proper\nto the structure of the human body.  If, then, a man, moved by\nanger or hatred, is led to clench his fist or to move his arm,\nthis result takes place (as we showed in Pt. II.), because one\nand the same action can be associated with various mental images\nof things; therefore we may be determined to the performance of\none and the same action by confused ideas, or by clear and\ndistinct ideas.  Hence it is evident that every desire which\nsprings from emotion, wherein the mind is passive, would become\nuseless, if men could be guided by reason.  Let us now see why\ndesire which arises from emotion, wherein the mind is passive, is\ncalled by us blind.\nPROP. LX.  Desire arising from a pleasure or pain, that is not\nattributable to the whole body, but only to one or certain parts\nthereof, is without utility in respect to a man as a whole.\nProof.--Let it be assumed, for instance, that A, a part of a\nbody, is so strengthened by some external cause, that it prevails\nover the remaining parts (IV. vi.).  This part will not endeavour\nto do away with its own powers, in order that the other parts of\nthe body may perform its office; for this it would be necessary\nfor it to have a force or power of doing away with its own\npowers, which (III. vi.) is absurd.  The said part, and,\nconsequently, the mind also, will endeavour to preserve its\ncondition.  Wherefore desire arising from a pleasure of the kind\naforesaid has no utility in reference to a man as a whole.  If it\nbe assumed, on the other hand, that the part, A, be checked so\nthat the remaining parts prevail, it may be proved in the same\nmanner that desire arising from pain has no utility in respect to\na man as a whole.  Q.E.D.\nNote.--As pleasure is generally (IV. xliv. note) attributed to\none part of the body, we generally desire to preserve our being\nwith out taking into consideration our health as a whole: to\nwhich it may be added, that the desires which have most hold over\nus (IV. ix.) take account of the present and not of the future.\nPROP. LXI.  Desire which springs from reason cannot be excessive.\nProof.--Desire (Def. of the Emotions, i.) considered\nabsolutely is the actual essence of man, in so far as it is\nconceived as in any way determined to a particular activity by\nsome given modification of itself.  Hence desire, which arises\nfrom reason, that is (III. iii.), which is engendered in us in so\nfar as we act, is the actual essence or nature of man, in so far\nas it is conceived as determined to such activities as are\nadequately conceived through man's essence only (III. Def. ii.).\nNow, if such desire could be excessive, human nature considered\nin itself alone would be able to exceed itself, or would be able\nto do more than it can, a manifest contradiction.  Therefore,\nsuch desire cannot be excessive.  Q.E.D.\nPROP. LXII.  In so far as the mind conceives a thing under the\ndictates of reason, it is affected equally, whether the idea be\nof a thing future, past, or present.\nProof.--Whatsoever the mind conceives under the guidance of\nreason, it conceives under the form of eternity or necessity (II.\nxliv. Coroll. ii.), and is therefore affected with the same\ncertitude (II. xliii. and note).  Wherefore, whether the thing be\npresent, past, or future, the mind conceives it under the same\nnecessity and is affected with the same certitude; and whether\nthe idea be of something present, past, or future, it will in all\ncases be equally true (II. xli.); that is, it will always\npossess the same properties of an adequate idea (II. Def. iv.);\ntherefore, in so far as the mind conceives things under the\ndictates of reason, it is affected in the same manner, whether\nthe idea be of a thing future, past, or present.  Q.E.D.\nNote.--If we could possess an adequate knowledge of the\nduration of things, and could determine by reason their periods\nof existence, we should contemplate things future with the same\nemotion as things present; and the mind would desire as though\nit were present the good which it conceived as future;\nconsequently it would necessarily neglect a lesser good in the\npresent for the sake of a greater good in the future, and would\nin no wise desire that which is good in the present but a source\nof evil in the future, as we shall presently show.  However, we\ncan have but a very inadequate knowledge of the duration of\nthings (II. xxxi.); and the periods of their existence (II.\nxliv. note.) we can only determine by imagination, which is not\nso powerfully affected by the future as by the present.  Hence\nsuch true knowledge of good and evil as we possess is merely\nabstract or general, and the judgment which we pass on the order\nof things and the connection of causes, with a view to\ndetermining what is good or bad for us in the present, is rather\nimaginary than real.  Therefore it is nothing wonderful, if the\ndesire arising from such knowledge of good and evil, in so far as\nit looks on into the future, be more readily checked than the\ndesire of things which are agreeable at the present time.  (Cf.\nIV. xvi.)\nPROP. LXIII.  He who is led by fear, and does good in order to\nescape evil, is not led by reason.\nProof.--All the emotions which are attributable to the mind as\nactive, or in other words to reason, are emotions of pleasure and\ndesire (III. lix.); therefore, he who is led by fear, and does\ngood in order to escape evil, is not led by reason.\nNote.--Superstitions persons, who know better how to rail at\nvice than how to teach virtue, and who strive not to guide men by\nreason, but so to restrain them that they would rather escape\nevil than love virtue, have no other aim but to make others as\nwretched as themselves; wherefore it is nothing wonderful, if\nthey be generally troublesome and odious to their fellow--men.\nCorollary.--Under desire which springs from reason, we seek\ngood directly, and shun evil indirectly.\nProof.--Desire which springs from reason can only spring from\na pleasurable emotion, wherein the mind is not passive (III.\nlix.), in other words, from a pleasure which cannot be excessive\n(IV. lxi.), and not from pain; wherefore this desire springs\nfrom the knowledge of good, not of evil (IV. viii.); hence under\nthe guidance of reason we seek good directly and only by\nimplication shun evil.  Q.E.D.\nNote.--This Corollary may be illustrated by the example of a\nsick and a healthy man.  The sick man through fear of death eats\nwhat he naturally shrinks from, but the healthy man takes\npleasure in his food, and thus gets a better enjoyment out of\nlife, than if he were in fear of death, and desired directly to\navoid it.  So a judge, who condemns a criminal to death, not from\nhatred or anger but from love of the public well--being, is guided\nsolely by reason.\nPROP. LXIV.  The knowledge of evil is an inadequate knowledge.\nProof.--The knowledge of evil (IV. viii.) is pain, in so far\nas we are conscious thereof.  Now pain is the transition to a\nlesser perfection (Def. of the Emotions, iii.) and therefore\ncannot be understood through man's nature (III. vi., and vii.);\ntherefore it is a passive state (III. Def. ii.) which (III. iii.)\ndepends on inadequate ideas; consequently the knowledge thereof\n(II. xxix.), namely, the knowledge of evil, is inadequate.\nQ.E.D.\nCorollary.--Hence it follows that, if the human mind possessed\nonly adequate ideas, it would form no conception of evil.\nPROP. LXV.  Under the guidance of reason we should pursue the\ngreater of two goods and the lesser of two evils.\nProof.--A good which prevents our enjoyment of a greater good\nis in reality an evil; for we apply the terms good and bad to\nthings, in so far as we compare them one with another (see\npreface to this Part); therefore, evil is in reality a lesser\ngood; hence under the guidance of reason we seek or pursue only\nthe greater good and the lesser evil.  Q.E.D.\nCorollary.--We may, under the guidance of reason, pursue the\nlesser evil as though it were the greater good, and we may shun\nthe lesser good, which would be the cause of the greater evil.\nFor the evil, which is here called the lesser, is really good,\nand the lesser good is really evil, wherefore we may seek the\nformer and shun the latter.  Q.E.D.\nPROP. LXVI.  We may, under the guidance of reason, seek a greater\ngood in the future in preference to a lesser good in the present,\nand we may seek a lesser evil in the present in preference to a\ngreater evil in the future.[15]\n[15] \"Maltim praesens minus prae majori futuro.\" (Van Vloten).\nBruder reads: \"Malum praesens minus, quod causa est faturi\nalicujus mali.\" The last word of the latter is an obvious\nmisprint, and is corrected by the Dutch translator into \"majoris\nboni.\" (Pollock, p. 268, note.)\nProof.--If the mind could have an adequate knowledge of things\nfuture, it would be affected towards what is future in the same\nway as towards what is present (IV. lxii.); wherefore, looking\nmerely to reason, as in this proposition we are assumed to do,\nthere is no difference, whether the greater good or evil be\nassumed as present, or assumed as future; hence (IV. lxv.) we\nmay seek a greater good in the future in preference to a lesser\ngood in the present, &c.  Q.E.D.\nCorollary.--We may, under the guidance of reason, seek a\nlesser evil in the present, because it is the cause of a greater\ngood in the future, and we may shun a lesser good in the present,\nbecause it is the cause of a greater evil in the future.  This\nCorollary is related to the foregoing Proposition as the\nCorollary to IV. lxv. is related to the said IV. lxv.\nNote.--If these statements be compared with what we have\npointed out concerning the strength of the emotions in this Part\nup to Prop. xviii., we shall readily see the difference between a\nman, who is led solely by emotion or opinion, and a man, who is\nled by reason.  The former, whether will or no, performs actions\nwhereof he is utterly ignorant; the latter is his own master and\nonly performs such actions, as he knows are of primary importance\nin life, and therefore chiefly desires; wherefore I call the\nformer a slave, and the latter a free man, concerning whose\ndisposition and manner of life it will be well to make a few\nobservations.\nPROP. LXVII.  A free man thinks of death least of all things;\nand his wisdom is a meditation not of death but of life.\nProof.--A free man is one who lives under the guidance of\nreason, who is not led by fear (IV. lxiii.), but who directly\ndesires that which is good (IV. lxiii. Coroll.), in other words\n(IV. xxiv.), who strives to act, to live, and to preserve his\nbeing on the basis of seeking his own true advantage; wherefore\nsuch an one thinks of nothing less than of death, but his wisdom\nis a meditation of life.  Q.E.D.\nPROP. LXVIII.  If men were born free, they would, so long as they\nremained free, form no conception of good and evil.\nProof.--I call free him who is led solely by reason; he,\ntherefore, who is born free, and who remains free, has only\nadequate ideas; therefore (IV. lxiv. Coroll.) he has no\nconception of evil, or consequently (good and evil being\ncorrelative) of good.  Q.E.D.\nNote.--It is evident, from IV. iv., that the hypothesis of\nthis Proposition is false and inconceivable, except in so far as\nwe look solely to the nature of man, or rather to God; not in so\nfar as the latter is infinite, but only in so far as he is the\ncause of man's existence.\nThis, and other matters which we have already proved, seem to\nhave been signifieded by Moses in the history of the first man.\nFor in that narrative no other power of God is conceived, save\nthat whereby he created man, that is the power wherewith he\nprovided solely for man's advantage; it is stated that God\nforbade man, being free, to eat of the tree of the knowledge of\ngood and evil, and that, as soon as man should have eaten of it,\nhe would straightway fear death rather than desire to live.\nFurther, it is written that when man had found a wife, who was in\nentire harmony with his nature, he knew that there could be\nnothing in nature which could be more useful to him; but that\nafter he believed the beasts to be like himself, he straightway\nbegan to imitate their emotions (III. xxvii.), and to lose his\nfreedom; this freedom was afterwards recovered by the\npatriarchs, led by the spirit of Christ; that is, by the idea of\nGod, whereon alone it depends, that man may be free, and desire\nfor others the good which he desires for himself, as we have\nshown above (IV. xxxvii.).\nPROP. LXIX.  The virtue of a free man is seen to be as great,\nwhen it declines dangers, as when it overcomes them.\nProof.--Emotion can only be checked or removed by an emotion\ncontrary to itself, and possessing more power in restraining\nemotion (IV. vii.).  But blind daring and fear are emotions,\nwhich can be conceived as equally great (IV. v. and iii.):\nhence, no less virtue or firmness is required in checking daring\nthan in checking fear (III. lix. note); in other words (Def. of\nthe Emotions, xl. and xli.), the free man shows as much virtue,\nwhen he declines dangers, as when he strives to overcome them.\nQ.E.D.\nCorollary.--The free man is as courageous in timely retreat as\nin combat; or, a free man shows equal courage or presence of\nmind, whether he elect to give battle or to retreat.\nNote.--What courage (animositas) is, and what I mean thereby,\nI explained in III. lix. note.  By danger I mean everything,\nwhich can give rise to any evil, such as pain, hatred, discord,\n&c.\nPROP. LXX.  The free man, who lives among the ignorant, strives,\nas far as he can, to avoid receiving favours from them.\nProof.--Everyone judges what is good according to his\ndisposition (III. xxxix. note); wherefore an ignorant man, who\nhas conferred a benefit on another, puts his own estimate upon\nit, and, if it appears to be estimated less highly by the\nreceiver, will feel pain (III. xlii.).  But the free man only\ndesires to join other men to him in friendship (IV. xxxvii.), not\nrepaying their benefits with others reckoned as of like value,\nbut guiding himself and others by the free decision of reason,\nand doing only such things as he knows to be of primary\nimportance.  Therefore the free man, lest he should become\nhateful to the ignorant, or follow their desires rather than\nreason, will endeavour, as far as he can, to avoid receiving\ntheir favours.\nNote.--I say, as far as he can.  For though men be ignorant,\nyet are they men, and in cases of necessity could afford us human\naid, the most excellent of all things: therefore it is often\nnecessary to accept favours from them, and consequently to repay\nsuch favours in kind; we must, therefore, exercise caution in\ndeclining favours, lest we should have the appearance of\ndespising those who bestow them, or of being, from avaricious\nmotives, unwilling to requite them, and so give ground for\noffence by the very fact of striving to avoid it.  Thus, in\ndeclining favours, we must look to the requirements of utility\nand courtesy.\nPROP. LXXI.  Only free men are thoroughly grateful one to\nanother.\nProof.--Only free men are thoroughly useful one to another,\nand associated among themselves by the closest necessity of\nfriendship (IV. xxxv., and Coroll. i.), only such men endeavour,\nwith mutual zeal of love, to confer benefits on each other (IV.\nxxxvii.), and, therefore, only they are thoroughly grateful one\nto another.  Q.E.D.\nNote.--The goodwill, which men who are led by blind desire\nhave for one another, is generally a bargaining or enticement,\nrather than pure goodwill.  Moreover, ingratitude is not an\nemotion.  Yet it is base, inasmuch as it generally shows, that a\nman is affected by excessive hatred, anger, pride, avarice, &c.\nHe who, by reason of his folly, knows not how to return benefits,\nis not ungrateful, much less he who is not gained over by the\ngifts of a courtesan to serve her lust, or by a thief to conceal\nhis thefts, or by any similar persons.  Contrariwise, such an one\nshows a constant mind, inasmuch as he cannot by any gifts be\ncorrupted, to his own or the general hurt.\nPROP. LXXII.  The free man never acts fraudulently, but always in\ngood faith.\nProof.--If it be asked: What should a man's conduct be in a\ncase where he could by breaking faith free himself from the\ndanger of present death? Would not his plan of self--preservation\ncompletely persuade him to deceive? This may be answered by\npointing out that, if reason persuaded him to act thus, it would\npersuade all men to act in a similar manner, in which case reason\nwould persuade men not to agree in good faith to unite their\nforces, or to have laws in common, that is, not to have any\ngeneral laws, which is absurd.\nPROP. LXXIII.  The man, who is guided by reason, is more free in\na State, where he lives under a general system of law, than in\nsolitude, where he is independent.\nProof.--The man, who is guided by reason, does not obey\nthrough fear (IV. lxiii.): but, in so far as he endeavours to\npreserve his being according to the dictates of reason, that is\n(IV. lxvi. note), in so far as he endeavours to live in freedom,\nhe desires to order his life according to the general good (IV.\nxxxvii.), and, consequently (as we showed in IV. xxxvii. note.\nii.), to live according to the laws of his country.  Therefore\nthe free man, in order to enjoy greater freedom, desires to\npossess the general rights of citizenship.  Q.E.D.\nNote.--These and similar observations, which we have made on\nman's true freedom, may be referred to strength, that is, to\ncourage and nobility of character (III. lix. note).  I do not\nthink it worth while to prove separately all the properties of\nstrength; much less need I show, that he that is strong hates no\nman, is angry with no man, envies no man, is indignant with no\nman, despises no man, and least of all things is proud.  These\npropositions, and all that relate to the true way of life and\nreligion, are easily proved from IV. xxxvii. and IV. xlvi.;\nnamely, that hatred should be overcome with love, and that every\nman should desire for others the good which he seeks for himself.\nWe may also repeat what we drew attention to in the note to IV.\nl., and in other places; namely, that the strong man has ever\nfirst in his thoughts, that all things follow from the necessity\nof the divine nature; so that whatsoever he deems to be hurtful\nand evil, and whatsoever, accordingly, seems to him impious,\nhorrible, unjust, and base, assumes that appearance owing to his\nown disordered, fragmentary, and confused view of the universe.\nWherefore he strives before all things to conceive things as they\nreally are, and to remove the hindrances to true knowledge, such\nas are hatred, anger, envy, derision, pride, and similar\nemotions, which I have mentioned above.  Thus he endeavours, as\nwe said before, as far as in him lies, to do good, and to go on\nhis way rejoicing.  How far human virtue is capable of attaining\nto such a condition, and what its powers may be, I will prove in\nthe following Part.\nAPPENDIX.\nWhat have said in this Part concerning the right way of life\nhas not been arranged, so as to admit of being seen at one view,\nbut has been set forth piece--meal, according as I thought each\nProposition could most readily be deduced from what preceded it.\nI propose, therefore, to rearrange my remarks and to bring them\nunder leading heads.\nI.  All our endeavours or desires so follow from the\nnecessity of our nature, that they can be understood either\nthrough it alone, as their proximate cause, or by virtue of our\nbeing a part of nature, which cannot be adequately conceived\nthrough itself without other individuals.\nII.  Desires, which follow from our nature in such a manner,\nthat they can be understood through it alone, are those which are\nreferred to the mind, in so far as the latter is conceived to\nconsist of adequate ideas: the remaining desires are only\nreferred to the mind, in so far as it conceives things\ninadequately, and their force and increase are generally defined\nnot by the power of man, but by the power of things external to\nus: wherefore the former are rightly called actions, the latter\npassions, for the former always indicate our power, the latter,\non the other hand, show our infirmity and fragmentary knowledge.\nIII.  Our actions, that is, those desires which are defined\nby man's power or reason, are always good.  The rest may be\neither good or bad.\nIV.  Thus in life it is before all things useful to perfect\nthe understanding, or reason, as far as we can, and in this alone\nman's highest happiness or blessedness consists, indeed\nblessedness is nothing else but the contentment of spirit, which\narises from the intuitive knowledge of God: now, to perfect the\nunderstanding is nothing else but to understand God, God's\nattributes, and the actions which follow from the necessity of\nhis nature.  Wherefore of a man, who is led by reason, the\nultimate aim or highest desire, whereby he seeks to govern all\nhis fellows, is that whereby he is brought to the adequate\nconception of himself and of all things within the scope of his\nintelligence.\nV.  Therefore, without intelligence there is not rational\nlife: and things are only good, in so far as they aid man in his\nenjoyment of the intellectual life, which is defined by\nintelligence.  Contrariwise, whatsoever things hinder man's\nperfecting of his reason, and capability to enjoy the rational\nlife, are alone called evil.\nVI.  As all things whereof man is the efficient cause are\nnecessarily good, no evil can befall man except through external\ncauses; namely, by virtue of man being a part of universal\nnature, whose laws human nature is compelled to obey, and to\nconform to in almost infinite ways.\nVII.  It is impossible, that man should not be a part of\nnature, or that he should not follow her general order; but if\nhe be thrown among individuals whose nature is in harmony with\nhis own, his power of action will thereby be aided and fostered,\nwhereas, if he be thrown among such as are but very little in\nharmony with his nature, he will hardly be able to accommodate\nhimself to them without undergoing a great change himself.\nVIII.  Whatsoever in nature we deem to be evil, or to be\ncapable of injuring our faculty for existing and enjoying the\nrational life, we may endeavour to remove in whatever way seems\nsafest to us; on the other hand, whatsoever we deem to be good\nor useful for preserving our being, and enabling us to enjoy the\nrational life, we may appropriate to our use and employ as we\nthink best.  Everyone without exception may, by sovereign right\nof nature, do whatsoever he thinks will advance his own interest.\nIX.  Nothing can be in more harmony with the nature of any\ngiven thing than other individuals of the same species;\ntherefore (cf. vii.) for man in the preservation of his being and\nthe enjoyment of the rational life there is nothing more useful\nthan his fellow--man who is led by reason.  Further, as we know\nnot anything among individual things which is more excellent than\na man led by reason, no man can better display the power of his\nskill and disposition, than in so training men, that they come at\nlast to live under the dominion of their own reason.\nX.  In so far as men are influenced by envy or any kind of\nhatred, one towards another, they are at variance, and are\ntherefore to be feared in proportion, as they are more powerful\nthan their fellows.\nXI.  Yet minds are not conquered by force, but by love and\nhigh--mindedness.\nXII.  It is before all things useful to men to associate\ntheir ways of life, to bind themselves together with such bonds\nas they think most fitted to gather them all into unity, and\ngenerally to do whatsoever serves to strengthen friendship.\nXIII.  But for this there is need of skill and watchfulness.\nFor men are diverse (seeing that those who live under the\nguidance of reason are few), yet are they generally envious and\nmore prone to revenge than to sympathy.  No small force of\ncharacter is therefore required to take everyone as he is, and to\nrestrain one's self from imitating the emotions of others.  But\nthose who carp at mankind, and are more skilled in railing at\nvice than in instilling virtue, and who break rather than\nstrengthen men's dispositions, are hurtful both to themselves and\nothers.  Thus many from too great impatience of spirit, or from\nmisguided religious zeal, have preferred to live among brutes\nrather than among men; as boys or youths, who cannot peaceably\nendure the chidings of their parents, will enlist as soldiers and\nchoose the hardships of war and the despotic discipline in\npreference to the comforts of home and the admonitions of their\nfather: suffering any burden to be put upon them, so long as\nthey may spite their parents.\nXIV.  Therefore, although men are generally governed in\neverything by their own lusts, yet their association in common\nbrings many more advantages than drawbacks.  Wherefore it is\nbetter to bear patiently the wrongs they may do us, and to strive\nto promote whatsoever serves to bring about harmony and\nfriendship.\nXV.  Those things, which beget harmony, are such as are\nattributable to justice, equity, and honourable living.  For men\nbrook ill not only what is unjust or iniquitous, but also what is\nreckoned disgraceful, or that a man should slight the received\ncustoms of their society.  For winning love those qualities are\nespecially necessary which have regard to religion and piety (cf.\nIV. xxxvii. notes. i. ii.; xlvi. note; and lxxiii. note).\nXVI.  Further, harmony is often the result of fear: but such\nharmony is insecure.  Further, fear arises from infirmity of\nspirit, and moreover belongs not to the exercise of reason: the\nsame is true of compassion, though this latter seems to bear a\ncertain resemblance to piety.\nXVII.  Men are also gained over by liberality, especially\nsuch as have not the means to buy what is necessary to sustain\nlife.  However, to give aid to every poor man is far beyond the\npower and the advantage of any private person.  For the riches of\nany private person are wholly inadequate to meet such a call.\nAgain, an individual man's resources of character are too limited\nfor him to be able to make all men his friends.  Hence providing\nfor the poor is a duty, which falls on the State as a whole, and\nhas regard only to the general advantage.\nXVIII.  In accepting favours, and in returning gratitude our\nduty must be wholly different (cf. IV. lxx. note; lxxi. note).\nXIX.  Again, meretricious love, that is, the lust of\ngeneration arising from bodily beauty, and generally every sort\nof love, which owns anything save freedom of soul as its cause,\nreadily passes into hate; unless indeed, what is worse, it is a\nspecies of madness; and then it promotes discord rather than\nharmony (cf. III. xxxi. Coroll.).\nXX.  As concerning marriage, it is certain that this is in\nharmony with reason, if the desire for physical union be not\nengendered solely by bodily beauty, but also by the desire to\nbeget children and to train them up wisely; and moreover, if the\nlove of both, to wit, of the man and of the woman, is not caused\nby bodily beauty only, but also by freedom of soul.\nXXI.  Furthermore, flattery begets harmony; but only by\nmeans of the vile offence of slavishness or treachery.  None are\nmore readily taken with flattery than the proud, who wish to be\nfirst, but are not.\nXXII.  There is in abasement a spurious appearance of piety\nand religion.  Although abasement is the opposite to pride, yet\nis he that abases himself most akin to the proud (IV. lvii.\nnote).\nXXIII.  Shame also brings about harmony, but only in such\nmatters as cannot be hid.  Further, as shame is a species of\npain, it does not concern the exercise of reason.\nXXIV.  The remaining emotions of pain towards men are\ndirectly opposed to justice, equity, honour, piety, and religion;\nand, although indignation seems to bear a certain resemblance\nto equity, yet is life but lawless, where every man may pass\njudgment on another's deeds, and vindicate his own or other men's\nrights.\nXXV.  Correctness of conduct (modestia), that is, the desire\nof pleasing men which is determined by reason, is attributable to\npiety (as we said in IV. xxxvii. note. i.).  But, if it spring\nfrom emotion, it is ambition, or the desire whereby, men, under\nthe false cloak of piety, generally stir up discords and\nseditions.  For he who desires to aid his fellows either in word\nor in deed, so that they may together enjoy the highest good, he,\nI say, will before all things strive to win them over with love:\nnot to draw them into admiration, so that a system may be called\nafter his name, nor to give any cause for envy.  Further, in his\nconversation he will shrink from talking of men's faults, and\nwill be careful to speak but sparingly of human infirmity: but\nhe will dwell at length on human virtue or power, and the way\nwhereby it may be perfected.  Thus will men be stirred not by\nfear, nor by aversion, but only by the emotion of joy, to\nendeavour, so far as in them lies, to live in obedience to\nreason.\nXXVI.  Besides men, we know of no particular thing in nature\nin whose mind we may rejoice, and whom we can associate with\nourselves in friendship or any sort of fellowship; therefore,\nwhatsoever there be in nature besides man, a regard for our\nadvantage does not call on us to preserve, but to preserve or\ndestroy according to its various capabilities, and to adapt to\nour use as best we may.\nXXVII.  The advantage which we derive from things external to\nus, besides the experience and knowledge which we acquire from\nobserving them, and from recombining their elements in different\nforms, is principally the preservation of the body; from this\npoint of view, those things are most useful which can so feed and\nnourish the body, that all its parts may rightly fulfil their\nfunctions.  For, in proportion as the body is capable of being\naffected in a greater variety of ways, and of affecting external\nbodies in a great number of ways, so much the more is the mind\ncapable of thinking (IV. xxxviii., xxxix.).  But there seem to be\nvery few things of this kind in nature; wherefore for the due\nnourishment of the body we must use many foods of diverse nature.\nFor the human body is composed of very many parts of different\nnature, which stand in continual need of varied nourishment, so\nthat the whole body may be equally capable of doing everything\nthat can follow from its own nature, and consequently that the\nmind also may be equally capable of forming many perceptions.\nXXVIII.  Now for providing these nourishments the strength of\neach individual would hardly suffice, if men did not lend one\nanother mutual aid.  But money has furnished us with a token for\neverything: hence it is with the notion of money, that the mind\nof the multitude is chiefly engrossed: nay, it can hardly\nconceive any kind of pleasure, which is not accompanied with the\nidea of money as cause.\nXXIX.  This result is the fault only of those, who seek\nmoney, not from poverty or to supply their necessary wants, but\nbecause they have learned the arts of gain, wherewith they bring\nthemselves to great splendour.  Certainly they nourish their\nbodies, according to custom, but scantily, believing that they\nlose as much of their wealth as they spend on the preservation of\ntheir body.  But they who know the true use of money, and who fix\nthe measure of wealth solely with regard to their actual needs,\nlive content with little.\nXXX.  As, therefore, those things are good which assist the\nvarious parts of the body, and enable them to perform their\nfunctions; and as pleasure consists in an increase of, or aid\nto, man's power, in so far as he is composed of mind and body;\nit follows that all those things which bring pleasure are good.\nBut seeing that things do not work with the object of giving us\npleasure, and that their power of action is not tempered to suit\nour advantage, and, lastly, that pleasure is generally referred\nto one part of the body more than to the other parts; therefore\nmost emotions of pleasure (unless reason and watchfulness be at\nhand), and consequently the desires arising therefrom, may become\nexcessive.  Moreover we may add that emotion leads us to pay most\nregard to what is agreeable in the present, nor can we estimate\nwhat is future with emotions equally vivid.  (IV. xliv. note, and\nlx. note.)\nXXXI.  Superstition, on the other hand, seems to account as\ngood all that brings pain, and as bad all that brings pleasure.\nHowever, as we said above (IV. xlv. note), none but the envious\ntake delight in my infirmity and trouble.  For the greater the\npleasure whereby we are affected, the greater is the perfection\nwhereto we pass, and consequently the more do we partake of the\ndivine nature: no pleasure can ever be evil, which is regulated\nby a true regard for our advantage.  But contrariwise he, who is\nled by fear and does good only to avoid evil, is not guided by\nreason.\nXXXII.  But human power is extremely limited, and is\ninfinitely surpassed by the power of external causes; we have\nnot, therefore, an absolute power of shaping to our use those\nthings which are without us.  Nevertheless, we shall bear with an\nequal mind all that happens to us in contravention to the claims\nof our own advantage, so long as we are conscious, that we have\ndone our duty, and that the power which we possess is not\nsufficient to enable us to protect ourselves completely;\nremembering that we are a part of universal nature, and that we\nfollow her order.  If we have a clear and distinct understanding\nof this, that part of our nature which is defined by\nintelligence, in other words the better part of ourselves, will\nassuredly acquiesce in what befalls us, and in such acquiescence\nwill endeavour to persist.  For, in so far as we are intelligent\nbeings, we cannot desire anything save that which is necessary,\nnor yield absolute acquiescence to anything, save to that which\nis true: wherefore, in so far as we have a right understanding\nof these things, the endeavour of the better part of ourselves is\nin harmony with the order of nature as a whole.\nPART V:\nOf the Power of the Understanding, or of Human Freedom\nPREFACE\nAt length I pass to the remaining portion of my Ethics, which\nis concerned with the way leading to freedom.  I shall therefore\ntreat therein of the power of the reason, showing how far the\nreason can control the emotions, and what is the nature of Mental\nFreedom or Blessedness; we shall then be able to see, how much\nmore powerful the wise man is than the ignorant.  It is no part\nof my design to point out the method and means whereby the\nunderstanding may be perfected, nor to show the skill whereby the\nbody may be so tended, as to be capable of the due performance of\nits functions.  The latter question lies in the province of\nMedicine, the former in the province of Logic.  Here, therefore,\nI repeat, I shall treat only of the power of the mind, or of\nreason; and I shall mainly show the extent and nature of its\ndominion over the emotions, for their control and moderation.\nThat we do not possess absolute dominion over them, I have\nalready shown.  Yet the Stoics have thought, that the emotions\ndepended absolutely on our will, and that we could absolutely\ngovern them.  But these philosophers were compelled, by the\nprotest of experience, not from their own principles, to confess,\nthat no slight practice and zeal is needed to control and\nmoderate them: and this someone endeavoured to illustrate by the\nexample (if I remember rightly) of two dogs, the one a house--dog\nand the other a hunting--dog.  For by long training it could be\nbrought about, that the house--dog should become accustomed to\nhunt, and the hunting--dog to cease from running after hares.  To\nthis opinion Descartes not a little inclines.  For he maintained,\nthat the soul or mind is specially united to a particular part of\nthe brain, namely, to that part called the pineal gland, by the\naid of which the mind is enabled to feel all the movements which\nare set going in the body, and also external objects, and which\nthe mind by a simple act of volition can put in motion in various\nways.  He asserted, that this gland is so suspended in the midst\nof the brain, that it could be moved by the slightest motion of\nthe animal spirits: further, that this gland is suspended in the\nmidst of the brain in as many different manners, as the animal\nspirits can impinge thereon; and, again, that as many different\nmarks are impressed on the said gland, as there are different\nexternal objects which impel the animal spirits towards it;\nwhence it follows, that if the will of the soul suspends the\ngland in a position, wherein it has already been suspended once\nbefore by the animal spirits driven in one way or another, the\ngland in its turn reacts on the said spirits, driving and\ndetermining them to the condition wherein they were, when\nrepulsed before by a similar position of the gland.  He further\nasserted, that every act of mental volition is united in nature\nto a certain given motion of the gland.  For instance, whenever\nanyone desires to look at a remote object, the act of volition\ncauses the pupil of the eye to dilate, whereas, if the person in\nquestion had only thought of the dilatation of the pupil, the\nmere wish to dilate it would not have brought about the result,\ninasmuch as the motion of the gland, which serves to impel the\nanimal spirits towards the optic nerve in a way which would\ndilate or contract the pupil, is not associated in nature with\nthe wish to dilate or contract the pupil, but with the wish to\nlook at remote or very near objects.  Lastly, he maintained that,\nalthough every motion of the aforesaid gland seems to have been\nunited by nature to one particular thought out of the whole\nnumber of our thoughts from the very beginning of our life, yet\nit can nevertheless become through habituation associated with\nother thoughts; this he endeavours to prove in the Passions de\nl'ame, I.50.  He thence concludes, that there is no soul so weak,\nthat it cannot, under proper direction, acquire absolute power\nover its passions.  For passions as defined by him are\n\"perceptions, or feelings, or disturbances of the soul, which are\nreferred to the soul as species, and which (mark the expression)\nare produced, preserved, and strengthened through some movement\nof the spirits.\" (Passions de l'ame, I.27).  But, seeing that we\ncan join any motion of the gland, or consequently of the spirits,\nto any volition, the determination of the will depends entirely\non our own powers; if, therefore, we determine our will with\nsure and firm decisions in the direction to which we wish our\nactions to tend, and associate the motions of the passions which\nwe wish to acquire with the said decisions, we shall acquire an\nabsolute dominion over our passions.  Such is the doctrine of\nthis illustrious philosopher (in so far as I gather it from his\nown words); it is one which, had it been less ingenious, I could\nhardly believe to have proceeded from so great a man.  Indeed, I\nam lost in wonder, that a philosopher, who had stoutly asserted,\nthat he would draw no conclusions which do not follow from\nself--evident premisses, and would affirm nothing which he did not\nclearly and distinctly perceive, and who had so often taken to\ntask the scholastics for wishing to explain obscurities through\noccult qualities, could maintain a hypothesis, beside which\noccult qualities are commonplace.  What does he understand, I\nask, by the union of the mind and the body? What clear and\ndistinct conception has he got of thought in most intimate union\nwith a certain particle of extended matter? Truly I should like\nhim to explain this union through its proximate cause.  But he\nhad so distinct a conception of mind being distinct from body,\nthat he could not assign any particular cause of the union\nbetween the two, or of the mind itself, but was obliged to have\nrecourse to the cause of the whole universe, that is to God.\nFurther, I should much like to know, what degree of motion the\nmind can impart to this pineal gland, and with what force can it\nhold it suspended? For I am in ignorance, whether this gland can\nbe agitated more slowly or more quickly by the mind than by the\nanimal spirits, and whether the motions of the passions, which we\nhave closely united with firm decisions, cannot be again\ndisjoined therefrom by physical causes; in which case it would\nfollow that, although the mind firmly intended to face a given\ndanger, and had united to this decision the motions of boldness,\nyet at the sight of the danger the gland might become suspended\nin a way, which would preclude the mind thinking of anything\nexcept running away.  In truth, as there is no common standard of\nvolition and motion, so is there no comparison possible between\nthe powers of the mind and the power or strength of the body;\nconsequently the strength of one cannot in any wise be determined\nby the strength of the other.  We may also add, that there is no\ngland discoverable in the midst of the brain, so placed that it\ncan thus easily be set in motion in so many ways, and also that\nall the nerves are not prolonged so far as the cavities of the\nbrain.  Lastly, I omit all the assertions which he makes\nconcerning the will and its freedom, inasmuch as I have\nabundantly proved that his premisses are false.  Therefore, since\nthe power of the mind, as I have shown above, is defined by the\nunderstanding only, we shall determine solely by the knowledge of\nthe mind the remedies against the emotions, which I believe all\nhave had experience of, but do not accurately observe or\ndistinctly see, and from the same basis we shall deduce all those\nconclusions, which have regard to the mind's blessedness.\nAXIOMS.\nI.  If two contrary actions be started in the same subject, a\nchange must necessarily take place, either in both, or in one of\nthe two, and continue until they cease to be contrary.\nII.  The power of an effect is defined by the power of its cause,\nin so far as its essence is explained or defined by the essence\nof its cause.\n(This axiom is evident from III. vii.)\nPROPOSITIONS.\nPROP. I.  Even as thoughts and the ideas of things are arranged\nand associated in the mind, so are the modifications of body or\nthe images of things precisely in the same way arranged and\nassociated in the body.\nProof.--The order and connection of ideas is the same (II.\nvii.) as the order and connection of things, and vice versa the\norder and connection of things is the same (II. vi. Coroll. and\nvii.) as the order and connection of ideas.  Wherefore, even as\nthe order and connection of ideas in the mind takes place\naccording to the order and association of modifications of the\nbody (II. xviii.), so vice versa (III. ii.) the order and\nconnection of modifications of the body takes place in accordance\nwith the manner, in which thoughts and the ideas of things are\narranged and associated in the mind.  Q.E.D.\nPROP. II.  If we remove a disturbance of the spirit, or emotion,\nfrom the thought of an external cause, and unite it to other\nthoughts, then will the love or hatred towards that external\ncause, and also the vacillations of spirit which arise from these\nemotions, be destroyed.\nProof.--That, which constitutes the reality of love or hatred,\nis pleasure or pain, accompanied by the idea of an external cause\n(Def. of the Emotions, vi. vii.); wherefore, when this cause is\nremoved, the reality of love or hatred is removed with it;\ntherefore these emotions and those which arise therefrom are\ndestroyed.  Q.E.D.\nPROP. III.  An emotion, which is a passion, ceases to be a\npassion, as soon as we form a clear and distinct idea thereof.\nProof.--An emotion, which is a passion, is a confused idea (by\nthe general Def. of the Emotions).  If, therefore, we form a\nclear and distinct idea of a given emotion, that idea will only\nbe distinguished from the emotion, in so far as it is referred to\nthe mind only, by reason (II. xxi., and note); therefore (III.\niii.), the emotion will cease to be a passion.  Q.E.D.\nCorollary--An emotion therefore becomes more under our\ncontrol, and the mind is less passive in respect to it, in\nproportion as it is more known to us.\nPROP. IV.  There is no modification of the body, whereof we\ncannot form some clear and distinct conception.\nProof.--Properties which are common to all things can only be\nconceived adequately (II. xxxviii.); therefore (II. xii. and\nLemma ii. after II. xiii.) there is no modification of the body,\nwhereof we cannot form some clear and distinct conception.\nQ.E.D.\nCorollary.--Hence it follows that there is no emotion, whereof\nwe cannot form some clear and distinct conception.  For an\nemotion is the idea of a modification of the body (by the general\nDef. of the Emotions), and must therefore (by the preceding\nProp.) involve some clear and distinct conception.\nNote.--Seeing that there is nothing which is not followed by\nan effect (I. xxxvi.), and that we clearly and distinctly\nunderstand whatever follows from an idea, which in us is adequate\n(II. xl.), it follows that everyone has the power of clearly and\ndistinctly understanding himself and his emotions, if not\nabsolutely, at any rate in part, and consequently of bringing it\nabout, that he should become less subject to them.  To attain\nthis result, therefore, we must chiefly direct our efforts to\nacquiring, as far as possible, a clear and distinct knowledge of\nevery emotion, in order that the mind may thus, through emotion,\nbe determined to think of those things which it clearly and\ndistinctly perceives, and wherein it fully acquiesces: and thus\nthat the emotion itself may be separated from the thought of an\nexternal cause, and may be associated with true thoughts; whence\nit will come to pass, not only that love, hatred, &c. will be\ndestroyed (V. ii.), but also that the appetites or desires, which\nare wont to arise from such emotion, will become incapable of\nbeing excessive (IV. lxi.).  For it must be especially remarked,\nthat the appetite through which a man is said to be active, and\nthat through which he is said to be passive is one and the same.\nFor instance, we have shown that human nature is so constituted,\nthat everyone desires his fellow--men to live after his own\nfashion (III. xxxi. note); in a man, who is not guided by\nreason, this appetite is a passion which is called ambition, and\ndoes not greatly differ from pride; whereas in a man, who lives\nby the dictates of reason, it is an activity or virtue which is\ncalled piety (IV. xxxvii. note. i. and second proof).  In like\nmanner all appetites or desires are only passions, in so far as\nthey spring from inadequate ideas; the same results are\naccredited to virtue, when they are aroused or generated by\nadequate ideas.  For all desires, whereby we are determined to\nany given action, may arise as much from adequate as from\ninadequate ideas (IV. lix.).  Than this remedy for the emotions\n(to return to the point from which I started), which consists in\na true knowledge thereof, nothing more excellent, being within\nour power, can be devised.  For the mind has no other power save\nthat of thinking and of forming adequate ideas, as we have shown\nabove (III. iii.).\nPROP. V.  An emotion towards a thing, which we conceive simply,\nand not as necessary, or as contingent, or as possible, is, other\nconditions being equal, greater than any other emotion.\nProof.--An emotion towards a thing, which we conceive to be\nfree, is greater than one towards what we conceive to be\nnecessary (III. xlix.), and, consequently, still greater than one\ntowards what we conceive as possible, or contingent (IV. xi.).\nBut to conceive a thing as free can be nothing else than to\nconceive it simply, while we are in ignorance of the causes\nwhereby it has been determined to action (II. xxxv. note);\ntherefore, an emotion towards a thing which we conceive simply\nis, other conditions being equal, greater than one, which we feel\ntowards what is necessary, possible, or contingent, and,\nconsequently, it is the greatest of all.  Q.E.D.\nPROP. VI.  The mind has greater power over the emotions and is\nless subject thereto, in so far as it understands all things as\nnecessary.\nProof.--The mind understands all things to be necessary (I.\nxxix.) and to be determined to existence and operation by an\ninfinite chain of causes; therefore (by the foregoing\nProposition), it thus far brings it about, that it is less\nsubject to the emotions arising therefrom, and (III. xlviii.)\nfeels less emotion towards the things themselves.  Q.E.D.\nNote.--The more this knowledge, that things are necessary, is\napplied to particular things, which we conceive more distinctly\nand vividly, the greater is the power of the mind over the\nemotions, as experience also testifies.  For we see, that the\npain arising from the loss of any good is mitigated, as soon as\nthe man who has lost it perceives, that it could not by any means\nhave been preserved.  So also we see that no one pities an\ninfant, because it cannot speak, walk, or reason, or lastly,\nbecause it passes so many years, as it were, in unconsciousness.\nWhereas, if most people were born full--grown and only one here\nand there as an infant, everyone would pity the infants; because\ninfancy would not then be looked on as a state natural and\nnecessary, but as a fault or delinquency in Nature; and we may\nnote several other instances of the same sort.\nPROP. VII.  Emotions which are aroused or spring from reason, if\nwe take account of time, are stronger than those, which are\nattributable to particular objects that we regard as absent.\nProof.--We do not regard a thing as absent, by reason of the\nemotion wherewith we conceive it, but by reason of the body,\nbeing affected by another emotion excluding the existence of the\nsaid thing (II. xvii.).  Wherefore, the emotion, which is\nreferred to the thing which we regard as absent, is not of a\nnature to overcome the rest of a man's activities and power (IV.\nvi.), but is, on the contrary, of a nature to be in some sort\ncontrolled by the emotions, which exclude the existence of its\nexternal cause (IV. ix.).  But an emotion which springs from\nreason is necessarily referred to the common properties of things\n(see the def. of reason in II. xl. note. ii.), which we always\nregard as present (for there can be nothing to exclude their\npresent existence), and which we always conceive in the same\nmanner (II. xxxviii.).  Wherefore an emotion of this kind always\nremains the same; and consequently (V. Ax. i.) emotions, which\nare contrary thereto and are not kept going by their external\ncauses, will be obliged to adapt themselves to it more and more,\nuntil they are no longer contrary to it; to this extent the\nemotion which springs from reason is more powerful.  Q.E.D.\nPROP. VIII.  An emotion is stronger in proportion to the number\nof simultaneous concurrent causes whereby it is aroused.\nProof.--Many simultaneous causes are more powerful than a few\n(III. vii.): therefore (IV. v.), in proportion to the increased\nnumber of simultaneous causes whereby it is aroused, an emotion\nbecomes stronger.  Q.E.D.\nNote--This proposition is also evident from V. Ax. ii.\nPROP. IX.  An emotion, which is attributable to many and diverse\ncauses which the mind regards as simultaneous with the emotion\nitself, is less hurtful, and we are less subject thereto and less\naffected towards each of its causes, than if it were a different\nand equally powerful emotion attributable to fewer causes or to a\nsingle cause.\nProof.--An emotion is only bad or hurtful, in so far as it\nhinders the mind from being able to think (IV. xxvi. xxvii.);\ntherefore, an emotion, whereby the mind is determined to the\ncontemplation of several things at once, is less hurtful than\nanother equally powerful emotion, which so engrosses the mind in\nthe single contemplation of a few objects or of one, that it is\nunable to think of anything else; this was our first point.\nAgain, as the mind's essence, in other words, its power (III.\nvii.), consists solely in thought (II. xi.), the mind is less\npassive in respect to an emotion, which causes it to think of\nseveral things at once, than in regard to an equally strong\nemotion, which keeps it engrossed in the contemplation of a few\nor of a single object: this was our second point.  Lastly, this\nemotion (III. xlviii.), in so far as it is attributable to\nseveral causes, is less powerful in regard to each of them.\nQ.E.D.\nPROP. X.  So long as we are not assailed by emotions contrary to\nour nature, we have the power of arranging and associating the\nmodifications of our body according to the intellectual order.\nProof.--The emotions, which are contrary to our nature, that\nis (IV. xxx.), which are bad, are bad in so far as they impede\nthe mind from understanding (IV. xxvii.).  So long, therefore, as\nwe are not assailed by emotions contrary to our nature, the\nmind's power, whereby it endeavours to understand things (IV.\nxxvi.), is not impeded, and therefore it is able to form clear\nand distinct ideas and to deduce them one from another (II. xl.\nnote. ii. and II. xlvii. note); consequently we have in such\ncases the power of arranging and associating the modifications of\nthe body according to the intellectual order.  Q.E.D.\nNote.--By this power of rightly arranging and associating the\nbodily modifications we can guard ourselves from being easily\naffected by evil emotions.  For (V. vii.) a greater force is\nneeded for controlling the emotions, when they are arranged and\nassociated according to the intellectual order, than when they,\nare uncertain and unsettled.  The best we can do, therefore, so\nlong as we do not possess a perfect knowledge of our emotions, is\nto frame a system of right conduct, or fixed practical precepts,\nto commit it to memory, and to apply it forthwith[16] to the\nparticular circumstances which now and again meet us in life, so\nthat our imagination may become fully imbued therewith, and that\nit may be always ready to our hand.  For instance, we have laid\ndown among the rules of life (IV. xlvi. and note), that hatred\nshould be overcome with love or high--mindedness, and not required\nwith hatred in return.  Now, that this precept of reason may be\nalways ready to our hand in time of need, we should often think\nover and reflect upon the wrongs generally committed by men, and\nin what manner and way they may be best warded off by\nhigh--mindedness: we shall thus associate the idea of wrong with\nthe idea of this precept, which accordingly will always be ready\nfor use when a wrong is done to us (II. xviii.).  If we keep also\nin readiness the notion of our true advantage, and of the good\nwhich follows from mutual friendships, and common fellowships;\nfurther, if we remember that complete acquiescence is the result\nof the right way of life ( IV. lii.), and that men, no less than\neverything else, act by the necessity of their nature: in such\ncase I say the wrong, or the hatred, which commonly arises\ntherefrom, will engross a very small part of our imagination and\nwill be easily overcome; or, if the anger which springs from a\ngrievous wrong be not overcome easily, it will nevertheless be\novercome, though not without a spiritual conflict, far sooner\nthan if we had not thus reflected on the subject beforehand.  As\nis indeed evident from V. vi. vii. viii.  We should, in the same\nway, reflect on courage as a means of overcoming fear; the\nordinary dangers of life should frequently be brought to mind and\nimagined, together with the means whereby through readiness of\nresource and strength of mind we can avoid and overcome them.\nBut we must note, that in arranging our thoughts and conceptions\nwe should always bear in mind that which is good in every\nindividual thing (IV. lxiii. Coroll. and III. lix.), in order\nthat we may always be determined to action by an emotion of\npleasure.  For instance, if a man sees that he is too keen in the\npursuit of honour, let him think over its right use, the end for\nwhich it should be pursued, and the means whereby he may attain\nit.  Let him not think of its misuse, and its emptiness, and the\nfickleness of mankind, and the like, whereof no man thinks except\nthrough a morbidness of disposition; with thoughts like these do\nthe most ambitious most torment themselves, when they despair of\ngaining the distinctions they hanker after, and in thus giving\nvent to their anger would fain appear wise.  Wherefore it is\ncertain that those, who cry out the loudest against the misuse of\nhonour and the vanity of the world, are those who most greedily\ncovet it.  This is not peculiar to the ambitious, but is common\nto all who are ill--used by fortune, and who are infirm in spirit.\nFor a poor man also, who is miserly, will talk incessantly of the\nmisuse of wealth and of the vices of the rich; whereby he merely\ntorments himself, and shows the world that he is intolerant, not\nonly of his own poverty, but also of other people's riches.  So,\nagain, those who have been ill received by a woman they love\nthink of nothing but the inconstancy, treachery, and other stock\nfaults of the fair sex; all of which they consign to oblivion,\ndirectly they are again taken into favour by their sweetheart.\nThus he who would govern his emotions and appetite solely by the\nlove of freedom strives, as far as he can, to gain a knowledge of\nthe virtues and their causes, and to fill his spirit with the joy\nwhich arises from the true knowledge of them: he will in no wise\ndesire to dwell on men's faults, or to carp at his fellows, or to\nrevel in a false show of freedom.  Whosoever will diligently\nobserve and practise these precepts (which indeed are not\ndifficult) will verily, in a short space of time, be able, for\nthe most part, to direct his actions according to the\ncommandments of reason.\n[16] Continuo.  Rendered \"constantly\" by Mr. Pollock on the ground\nthat the classical meaning of the word does not suit the context.\nPROP. XI.  In proportion as a mental image is referred to more\nobjects, so is it more frequent, or more often vivid, and\noccupies the mind more.\nProof.--In proportion as a mental image or an emotion is\nreferred to more objects, so are there more causes whereby it can\nbe aroused and fostered, all of which (by hypothesis) the mind\ncontemplates simultaneously in association with the given emotion;\ntherefore the emotion is more frequent, or is more often in\nfull vigour, and (V. viii.) occupies the mind more.  Q.E.D.\nPROP. XII.  The mental images of things are more easily\nassociated with the images referred to things which we clearly\nand distinctly understand, than with others.\nProof.--Things, which we clearly and distinctly understand,\nare either the common properties of things or deductions\ntherefrom (see definition of Reason, II. xl. note ii.), and are\nconsequently (by the last Prop.) more often aroused in us.\nWherefore it may more readily happen, that we should contemplate\nother things in conjunction with these than in conjunction with\nsomething else, and consequently (II. xviii.) that the images of\nthe said things should be more often associated with the images\nof these than with the images of something else.  Q.E.D.\nPROP. XIII.  A mental image is more often vivid, in proportion as\nit is associated with a greater number of other images.\nProof.--In proportion as an image is associated with a greater\nnumber of other images, so (II. xviii.) are there more causes\nwhereby it can be aroused.  Q.E.D.\nPROP. XIV.  The mind can bring it about, that all bodily\nmodifications or images of things may be referred to the idea of\nGod.\nProof.--There is no modification of the body, whereof the mind\nmay not form some clear and distinct conception (V. iv.);\nwherefore it can bring it about, that they should all be referred\nto the idea of God (I. xv.).  Q.E.D.\nPROP. XV.  He who clearly and distinctly understands himself and\nhis emotions loves God, and so much the more in proportion as he\nmore understands himself and his emotions.\nProof.--He who clearly and distinctly understands himself and\nhis emotions feels pleasure (III. liii.), and this pleasure is\n(by the last Prop.) accompanied by the idea of God; therefore\n(Def. of the Emotions, vi.) such an one loves God, and (for the\nsame reason) so much the more in proportion as he more\nunderstands himself and his emotions.  Q.E.D.\nPROP. XVI.  This love towards God must hold the chief place in\nthe mind.\nProof.--For this love is associated with all the modifications\nof the body (V. xiv.) and is fostered by them all (V. xv.);\ntherefore (V. xi.), it must hold the chief place in the mind.\nQ.E.D.\nPROP. XVII.  God is without passions, neither is he affected by\nany emotion of pleasure or pain.\nProof.--All ideas, in so far as they are referred to God, are\ntrue (II. xxxii.), that is (II. Def. iv.) adequate; and\ntherefore (by the general Def. of the Emotions) God is without\npassions.  Again, God cannot pass either to a greater or to a\nlesser perfection (I. xx. Coroll. ii.); therefore (by Def. of\nthe Emotions, ii. iii.) he is not affected by any emotion of\npleasure or pain.\nCorollary.--Strictly speaking, God does not love or hate\nanyone.  For God (by the foregoing Prop.) is not affected by any\nemotion of pleasure or pain, consequently (Def. of the Emotions,\nvi. vii.) he does not love or hate anyone.\nPROP. XVIII.  No one can hate God.\nProof.--The idea of God which is in us is adequate and perfect\n(II. xlvi. xlvii.); wherefore, in so far as we contemplate God,\nwe are active (III. iii.); consequently (III. lix.) there can be\nno pain accompanied by the idea of God, in other words (Def. of\nthe Emotions, vii.), no one can hate God.  Q.E.D.\nCorollary.--Love towards God cannot be turned into hate.\nNote.--It may be objected that, as we understand God as the\ncause of all things, we by that very fact regard God as the cause\nof pain.  But I make answer, that, in so far as we understand the\ncauses of pain, it to that extent (V. iii.) ceases to be a\npassion, that is, it ceases to be pain (III. lix.); therefore,\nin so far as we understand God to be the cause of pain, we to\nthat extent feel pleasure.\nPROP. XIX.  He, who loves God, cannot endeavour that God should\nlove him in return.\nProof.--For, if a man should so endeavour, he would desire (V.\nxvii. Coroll.) that God, whom he loves, should not be God, and\nconsequently he would desire to feel pain (III. xix.); which is\nabsurd (III. xxviii.).  Therefore, he who loves God, &c.  Q.E.D.\nPROP. XX.  This love towards God cannot be stained by the emotion\nof envy or jealousy: contrariwise, it is the more fostered, in\nproportion as we conceive a greater number of men to be joined to\nGod by the same bond of love.\nProof.--This love towards God is the highest good which we can\nseek for under the guidance of reason (IV. xxviii.), it is common\nto all men (IV. xxxvi.), and we desire that all should rejoice\ntherein (IV. xxxvii.); therefore (Def. of the Emotions, xxiii.),\nit cannot be stained by the emotion envy, nor by the emotion of\njealousy (V. xviii. see definition of Jealousy, III. xxxv. note);\nbut, contrariwise, it must needs be the more fostered, in\nproportion as we conceive a greater number of men to rejoice\ntherein.  Q.E.D.\nNote.--We can in the same way show, that there is no emotion\ndirectly contrary to this love, whereby this love can be\ndestroyed; therefore we may conclude, that this love towards God\nis the most constant of all the emotions, and that, in so far as\nit is referred to the body, it cannot be destroyed, unless the\nbody be destroyed also.  As to its nature, in so far as it is\nreferred to the mind only, we shall presently inquire.\nI have now gone through all the remedies against the\nemotions, or all that the mind, considered in itself alone, can\ndo against them.  Whence it appears that the mind's power over\nthe emotions consists:----\nI.  In the actual knowledge of the emotions (V. iv. note).\nII. In the fact that it separates the emotions from the\nthought of an external cause, which we conceive confusedly (V.\nii. and V. iv. note).\nIII.  In the fact, that, in respect to time, the emotions\nreferred to things, which we distinctly understand, surpass those\nreferred to what we conceive in a confused and fragmentary manner\n(V. vii.).\nIV.  In the number of causes whereby those modifications[17]\nare fostered, which have regard to the common properties of\nthings or to God (V. ix. xi.).\n[17] Affectiones.  Camerer reads affectus----emotions.\nV.  Lastly, in the order wherein the mind can arrange and\nassociate, one with another, its own emotions (V. x. note and\nxii. xiii. xiv.).\nBut, in order that this power of the mind over the emotions\nmay be better understood, it should be specially observed that\nthe emotions are called by us strong, when we compare the emotion\nof one man with the emotion of another, and see that one man is\nmore troubled than another by the same emotion; or when we are\ncomparing the various emotions of the same man one with another,\nand find that he is more affected or stirred by one emotion than\nby another.  For the strength of every emotion is defined by a\ncomparison of our own power with the power of an external cause.\nNow the power of the mind is defined by knowledge only, and its\ninfirmity or passion is defined by the privation of knowledge\nonly: it therefore follows, that that mind is most passive,\nwhose greatest part is made up of inadequate ideas, so that it\nmay be characterized more readily by its passive states than by\nits activities: on the other hand, that mind is most active,\nwhose greatest part is made up of adequate ideas, so that,\nalthough it may contain as many inadequate ideas as the former\nmind, it may yet be more easily characterized by ideas\nattributable to human virtue, than by ideas which tell of human\ninfirmity.  Again, it must be observed, that spiritual\nunhealthiness and misfortunes can generally be traced to\nexcessive love for something which is subject to many variations,\nand which we can never become masters of.  For no one is\nsolicitous or anxious about anything, unless he loves it;\nneither do wrongs, suspicions, enmities, &c. arise, except in\nregard to things whereof no one can be really master.\nWe may thus readily conceive the power which clear and\ndistinct knowledge, and especially that third kind of knowledge\n(II. xlvii. note), founded on the actual knowledge of God,\npossesses over the emotions: if it does not absolutely destroy\nthem, in so far as they are passions (V. iii. and iv. note); at\nany rate, it causes them to occupy a very small part of the mind\n(V. xiv.).  Further, it begets a love towards a thing immutable\nand eternal (V. xv.), whereof we may really enter into possession\n(II. xlv.); neither can it be defiled with those faults which\nare inherent in ordinary love; but it may grow from strength to\nstrength, and may engross the greater part of the mind, and\ndeeply penetrate it.\nAnd now I have finished with all that concerns this present\nlife: for, as I said in the beginning of this note, I have\nbriefly described all the remedies against the emotions.  And\nthis everyone may readily have seen for himself, if he has\nattended to what is advanced in the present note, and also to the\ndefinitions of the mind and its emotions, and, lastly, to\nPropositions i. and iii. of Part III.  It is now, therefore, time\nto pass on to those matters, which appertain to the duration of\nthe mind, without relation to the body.\nPROP. XXI.  The mind can only imagine anything, or remember what\nis past, while the body endures.\nProof.--The mind does not express the actual existence of its\nbody, nor does it imagine the modifications of the body as\nactual, except while the body endures (II. viii. Coroll.); and,\nconsequently (II. xxvi.), it does not imagine\nany body as actually existing, except while its own body endures.\nThus it\ncannot imagine anything (for definition of Imagination, see II.\nxvii. note),\nor remember things past, except while the body endures (see\ndefinition of Memory, II. xviii. note).  Q.E.D.\nPROP. XXII.  Nevertheless in God there is necessarily an idea,\nwhich expresses the essence of this or that human body under the\nform of eternity.\nProof.--God is the cause, not only of the existence of this or\nthat human body, but also of its essence (I. xxv.).  This\nessence, therefore, must necessarily be conceived through the\nvery essence of God (I. Ax. iv.), and be thus conceived by a\ncertain eternal necessity (I. xvi.); and this conception must\nnecessarily exist in God (II. iii.).  Q.E.D.\nPROP. XXIII.  The human mind cannot be absolutely destroyed with\nthe body, but there remains of it something which is eternal.\nProof.--There is necessarily in God a concept or idea, which\nexpresses the essence of the human body (last Prop.), which,\ntherefore, is necessarily something appertaining to the essence\nof the human mind (II. xiii.).  But we have not assigned to the\nhuman mind any duration, definable by time, except in so far as\nit expresses the actual existence of the body, which is explained\nthrough duration, and may be defined by time--that is (II. viii.\nCoroll.), we do not assign to it duration, except while the body\nendures.  Yet, as there is something, notwithstanding, which is\nconceived by a certain eternal necessity through the very essence\nof God (last Prop.); this something, which appertains to the\nessence of the mind, will necessarily be eternal.  Q.E.D.\nNote.--This idea, which expresses the essence of the body\nunder the form of eternity, is, as we have said, a certain mode\nof thinking, which belongs to the essence of the mind, and is\nnecessarily eternal.  Yet it is not possible that we should\nremember that we existed before our body, for our body can bear\nno trace of such existence, neither can eternity be defined in\nterms of time, or have any relation to time.  But,\nnotwithstanding, we feel and know that we are eternal.  For the\nmind feels those things that it conceives by understanding, no\nless than those things that it remembers.  For the eyes of the\nmind, whereby it sees and observes things, are none other than\nproofs.  Thus, although we do not remember that we existed before\nthe body, yet we feel that our mind, in so far as it involves the\nessence of the body, under the form of eternity, is eternal, and\nthat thus its existence cannot be defined in terms of time, or\nexplained through duration.  Thus our mind can only be said to\nendure, and its existence can only be defined by a fixed time, in\nso far as it involves the actual existence of the body.  Thus far\nonly has it the power of determining the existence of things by\ntime, and conceiving them under the category of duration.\nPROP. XXIV.  The more we understand particular things, the more\ndo we understand God.\nProof.--This is evident from I. xxv. Coroll.\nPROP. XXV.  The highest endeavour of the mind, and the highest\nvirtue is to understand things by the third kind of knowledge.\nProof.--The third kind of knowledge proceeds from an adequate\nidea of certain attributes of God to an adequate knowledge of the\nessence of things (see its definition II. xl. note. ii.); and,\nin proportion as we understand things more in this way, we better\nunderstand God (by the last Prop.); therefore (IV. xxviii.) the\nhighest virtue of the mind, that is (IV. Def. viii.) the power, or\nnature, or (III. vii.) highest endeavour of the mind, is to\nunderstand things by the third kind of knowledge.  Q.E.D.\nPROP. XXVI.  In proportion as the mind is more capable of\nunderstanding things by the third kind of knowledge, it desires\nmore to understand things by that kind.\nProof--This is evident.  For, in so far as we conceive the\nmind to be capable of conceiving things by this kind of\nknowledge, we, to that extent, conceive it as determined thus to\nconceive things; and consequently (Def. of the Emotions, i.),\nthe mind desires so to do, in proportion as it is more capable\nthereof.  Q.E.D.\nPROP. XXVII.  From this third kind of knowledge arises the\nhighest possible mental acquiescence.\nProof.--The highest virtue of the mind is to know God (IV.\nxxviii.), or to understand things by the third kind of knowledge\n(V. xxv.), and this virtue is greater in proportion as the mind\nknows things more by the said kind of knowledge (V. xxiv.):\nconsequently, he who knows things by this kind of knowledge\npasses to the summit of human perfection, and is therefore (Def.\nof the Emotions, ii.) affected by the highest pleasure, such\npleasure being accompanied by the idea of himself and his own\nvirtue; thus (Def. of the Emotions, xxv.), from this kind of\nknowledge arises the highest possible acquiescence.  Q.E.D.\nPROP. XXVIII.  The endeavour or desire to know things by the\nthird kind of knowledge cannot arise from the first, but from the\nsecond kind of knowledge.\nProof.--This proposition is self--evident.  For whatsoever we\nunderstand clearly and distinctly, we understand either through\nitself, or through that which is conceived through itself; that\nis, ideas which are clear and distinct in us, or which are\nreferred to the third kind of knowledge (II. xl. note. ii.)\ncannot follow from ideas that are fragmentary and confused, and\nare referred to knowledge of the first kind, but must follow from\nadequate ideas, or ideas of the second and third kind of\nknowledge; therefore (Def. of the Emotions, i.), the desire of\nknowing things by the third kind of knowledge cannot arise from\nthe first, but from the second kind.  Q.E.D.\nPROP. XXIX.  Whatsoever the mind understands under the form of\neternity, it does not understand by virtue of conceiving the\npresent actual existence of the body, but by virtue of conceiving\nthe essence of the body under the form of eternity.\nProof.--In so far as the mind conceives the present existence\nof its body, it to that extent conceives duration which can be\ndetermined by time, and to that extent only has it the power of\nconceiving things in relation to time (V. xxi. II. xxvi.).  But\neternity cannot be explained in terms of duration (I. Def. viii.\nand explanation).  Therefore to this extent the mind has not the\npower of conceiving things under the form of eternity, but it\npossesses such power, because it is of the nature of reason to\nconceive things under the form of eternity (II. xliv. Coroll.\nii.), and also because it is of the nature of the mind to\nconceive the essence of the body under the form of eternity (V.\nxxiii.), for besides these two there is nothing which belongs to\nthe essence of mind (II. xiii.).  Therefore this power of\nconceiving things under the form of eternity only belongs to the\nmind in virtue of the mind's conceiving the essence of the body\nunder the form of eternity.  Q.E.D.\nNote.--Things are conceived by us as actual in two ways; either as\nexisting in relation to a given time and place, or as contained in\nGod and following from the necessity of the divine nature.\nWhatsoever we conceive in this second way as true or real, we\nconceive under the form of eternity, and their ideas involve the\neternal and infinite essence of God, as we showed in II. xlv. and\nnote, which see.\nPROP. XXX.  Our mind, in so far as it knows itself and the body\nunder the form of eternity, has to that extent necessarily a\nknowledge of God, and knows that it is in God, and is conceived\nthrough God.\nProof.--Eternity is the very essence of God, in so far as this\ninvolves necessary existence (I. Def. viii.).  Therefore to\nconceive things under the form of eternity, is to conceive things\nin so far as they are conceived through the essence of God as\nreal entities, or in so far as they involve existence through the\nessence of God; wherefore our mind, in so far as it conceives\nitself and the body under the form of eternity, has to that\nextent necessarily a knowledge of God, and knows, &c.  Q.E.D.\nPROP. XXXI.  The third kind of knowledge depends on the mind, as\nits formal cause, in so far as the mind itself is eternal.\nProof.--The mind does not conceive anything under the form of\neternity, except in so far as it conceives its own body under the\nform of eternity (V. xxix.); that is, except in so far as it is\neternal (V. xxi. xxiii.); therefore (by the last Prop.), in so\nfar as it is eternal, it possesses the knowledge of God, which\nknowledge is necessarily adequate (II. xlvi.); hence the mind,\nin so far as it is eternal, is capable of knowing everything\nwhich can follow from this given knowledge of God (II. xl.), in\nother words, of knowing things by the third kind of knowledge\n(see Def. in II. xl. note. ii.), whereof accordingly the mind\n(III. Def. i.), in so far as it is eternal, is the adequate or\nformal cause of such knowledge.  Q.E.D.\nNote.--In proportion, therefore, as a man is more potent in\nthis kind of knowledge, he will be more completely conscious of\nhimself and of God; in other words, he will be more perfect and\nblessed, as will appear more clearly in the sequel.  But we must\nhere observe that, although we are already certain that the mind\nis eternal, in so far as it conceives things under the form of\neternity, yet, in order that what we wish to show may be more\nreadily explained and better understood, we will consider the\nmind itself, as though it had just begun to exist and to\nunderstand things under the form of eternity, as indeed we have\ndone hitherto; this we may do without any danger of error, so\nlong as we are careful not to draw any conclusion, unless our\npremisses are plain.\nPROP. XXXII.  Whatsoever we understand by the third kind of\nknowledge, we take delight in, and our delight is accompanied by\nthe idea of God as cause.\nProof.--From this kind of knowledge arises the highest\npossible mental acquiescence, that is (Def of the Emotions,\nxxv.), pleasure, and this acquiescence is accompanied by the idea\nof the mind itself (V. xxvii.), and consequently (V. xxx.) the\nidea also of God as cause.  Q.E.D.\nCorollary.--From the third kind of knowledge necessarily\narises the intellectual love of God.  From this kind of knowledge\narises pleasure accompanied by the idea of God as cause, that is\n(Def. of the Emotions, vi.), the love of God; not in so far as\nwe imagine him as present (V. xxix.), but in so far as we\nunderstand him to be eternal; this is what I call the\nintellectual love of God.\nPROP. XXXIII.  The intellectual love of God, which arises from\nthe third kind of knowledge, is eternal.\nProof.--The third kind of knowledge is eternal (V. xxxi. I.\nAx. iii.); therefore (by the same Axiom) the love which arises\ntherefrom is also necessarily eternal.  Q.E.D.\nNote.--Although this love towards God has (by the foregoing\nProp.) no beginning, it yet possesses all the perfections of\nlove, just as though it had arisen as we feigned in the Coroll.\nof the last Prop.  Nor is there here any difference, except that\nthe mind possesses as eternal those same perfections which we\nfeigned to accrue to it, and they are accompanied by the idea of\nGod as eternal cause.  If pleasure consists in the transition to\na greater perfection, assuredly blessedness must consist in the\nmind being endowed with perfection itself.\nPROP. XXXIV.  The mind is, only while the body endures, subject\nto those emotions which are attributable to passions.\nProof.--Imagination is the idea wherewith the mind\ncontemplates a thing as present (II. xvii. note); yet this idea\nindicates rather the present disposition of the human body than\nthe nature of the external thing (II. xvi. Coroll. ii.).\nTherefore emotion (see general Def. of Emotions) is imagination,\nin so far as it indicates the present disposition of the body;\ntherefore (V. xxi.) the mind is, only while the body endures,\nsubject to emotions which are attributable to passions.  Q.E.D.\nCorollary.--Hence it follows that no love save intellectual\nlove is eternal.\nNote.--If we look to men's general opinion, we shall see that\nthey are indeed conscious of the eternity of their mind, but that\nthey confuse eternity with duration, and ascribe it to the\nimagination or the memory which they believe to remain after\ndeath.\nPROP. XXXV.  God loves himself with an infinite intellectual\nlove.\nProof.--God is absolutely infinite (I. Def. vi.), that is (II.\nDef. vi.), the nature of God rejoices in infinite perfection;\nand such rejoicing is (II. iii.) accompanied by the idea of\nhimself, that is (I. xi. and Def. i.), the idea of his own cause:\nnow this is what we have (in V. xxxii. Coroll.) described as\nintellectual love.\nPROP. XXXVI.  The intellectual love of the mind towards God is\nthat very love of God whereby God loves himself, not in so far as\nhe is infinite, but in so far as he can be explained through the\nessence of the human mind regarded under the form of eternity;\nin other words, the intellectual love of the mind towards God is\npart of the infinite love wherewith God loves himself.\nProof.--This love of the mind must be referred to the\nactivities of the mind (V. xxxii. Coroll. and III. iii.); it is\nitself, indeed, an activity whereby the mind regards itself\naccompanied by the idea of God as cause (V. xxxii. and Coroll.);\nthat is (I. xxv. Coroll. and II. xi. Coroll.), an activity\nwhereby God, in so far as he can be explained through the human\nmind, regards himself accompanied by the idea of himself;\ntherefore (by the last Prop.), this love of the mind is part of\nthe infinite love wherewith God loves himself.  Q.E.D.\nCorollary.--Hence it follows that God, in so far as he loves\nhimself, loves man, and, consequently, that the love of God\ntowards men, and the intellectual love of the mind towards God\nare identical.\nNote.--From what has been said we clearly understand, wherein\nour salvation, or blessedness, or freedom, consists: namely, in\nthe constant and eternal love towards God, or in God's love\ntowards men.  This love or blessedness is, in the Bible, called\nGlory, and not undeservedly.  For whether this love be referred\nto God or to the mind, it may rightly be called acquiescence of\nspirit, which (Def. of the Emotions, xxv. xxx.) is not really\ndistinguished from glory.  In so far as it is referred to God, it\nis (V. xxxv.) pleasure, if we may still use that term,\naccompanied by the idea of itself, and, in so far as it is\nreferred to the mind, it is the same (V. xxvii.).\nAgain, since the essence of our mind consists solely in\nknowledge, whereof the beginning and the foundation is God (I.\nxv., and II. xlvii. note), it becomes clear to us, in what manner\nand way our mind, as to its essence and existence, follows from\nthe divine nature and constantly depends on God.  I have thought\nit worth while here to call attention to this, in order to show\nby this example how the knowledge of particular things, which I\nhave called intuitive or of the third kind (II. xl. note. ii.),\nis potent, and more powerful than the universal knowledge, which\nI have styled knowledge of the second kind.  For, although in\nPart I. I showed in general terms, that all things (and\nconsequently, also, the human mind) depend as to their essence\nand existence on God, yet that demonstration, though legitimate\nand placed beyond the chances of doubt, does not affect our mind\nso much, as when the same conclusion is derived from the actual\nessence of some particular thing, which we say depends on God.\nPROP. XXXVII.  There is nothing in nature, which is contrary to\nthis intellectual love, or which can take it away.\nProof.--This intellectual love follows necessarily from the\nnature of the mind, in so far as the latter is regarded through\nthe nature of God as an eternal truth (V. xxxiii. and xxix.).\nIf, therefore, there should be anything which would be contrary\nto this love, that thing would be contrary to that which is true;\nconsequently, that, which should be able to take away this\nlove, would cause that which is true to be false; an obvious\nabsurdity.  Therefore there is nothing in nature which, &c.\nQ.E.D.\nNote.--The Axiom of Part IV. has reference to particular\nthings, in so far as they are regarded in relation to a given\ntime and place: of this, I think, no one can doubt.\nPROP. XXXVIII.  In proportion as the mind understands more things\nby the second and third kind of knowledge, it is less subject to\nthose emotions which are evil, and stands in less fear of death.\nProof.--The mind's essence consists in knowledge (II. xi.);\ntherefore, in proportion as the mind understands more things by\nthe second and third kinds of knowledge, the greater will be the\npart of it that endures (V. xxix. and xxiii.), and, consequently\n(by the last Prop.), the greater will be the part that is not\ntouched by the emotions, which are contrary to our nature, or in\nother words, evil (IV. xxx.).  Thus, in proportion as the mind\nunderstands more things by the second and third kinds of\nknowledge, the greater will be the part of it, that remains\nunimpaired, and, consequently, less subject to emotions, &c.\nQ.E.D.\nNote.--Hence we understand that point which I touched on in\nIV. xxxix. note, and which I promised to explain in this Part;\nnamely, that death becomes less hurtful, in proportion as the\nmind's clear and distinct knowledge is greater, and,\nconsequently, in proportion as the mind loves God more.  Again,\nsince from the third kind of knowledge arises the highest\npossible acquiescence (V. xxvii.), it follows that the human mind\ncan attain to being of such a nature, that the part thereof which\nwe have shown to perish with the body (V. xxi.) should be of\nlittle importance when compared with the part which endures.  But\nI will soon treat of the subject at greater length.\nPROP. XXXIX.  He, who possesses a body capable of the greatest\nnumber of activities, possesses a mind whereof the greatest part\nis eternal.\nProof.--He, who possesses a body capable of the greatest\nnumber of activities, is least agitated by those emotions which\nare evil (IV. xxxviii.)--that is (IV. xxx.), by those emotions\nwhich are contrary to our nature; therefore (V. x.), he\npossesses the power of arranging and associating the\nmodifications of the body according to the intellectual order,\nand, consequently, of bringing it about, that all the\nmodifications of the body should be referred to the idea of God;\nwhence it will come to pass that (V. xv.) he will be affected\nwith love towards God, which (V. xvi.) must occupy or constitute\nthe chief part of the mind; therefore (V. xxxiii.), such a man\nwill possess a mind whereof the chief part is eternal.  Q.E.D.\nNote.--Since human bodies are capable of the greatest number\nof activities, there is no doubt but that they may be of such a\nnature, that they may be referred to minds possessing a great\nknowledge of themselves and of God, and whereof the greatest or\nchief part is eternal, and, therefore, that they should scarcely\nfear death.  But, in order that this may be understood more\nclearly, we must here call to mind, that we live in a state of\nperpetual variation, and, according as we are changed for the\nbetter or the worse, we are called happy or unhappy.\nFor he, who, from being an infant or a child, becomes a\ncorpse, is called unhappy; whereas it is set down to happiness,\nif we have been able to live through the whole period of life\nwith a sound mind in a sound body.  And, in reality, he, who, as\nin the case of an infant or a child, has a body capable of very\nfew activities, and depending, for the most part, on external\ncauses, has a mind which, considered in itself alone, is scarcely\nconscious of itself, or of God, or of things; whereas, he, who\nhas a body capable of very many activities, has a mind which,\nconsidered in itself alone, is highly conscious of itself, of\nGod, and of things.  In this life, therefore, we primarily\nendeavour to bring it about, that the body of a child, in so far\nas its nature allows and conduces thereto, may be changed into\nsomething else capable of very many activities, and referable to\na mind which is highly conscious of itself, of God, and of things;\nand we desire so to change it, that what is referred to its\nimagination and memory may become insignificant, in comparison\nwith its intellect, as I have already said in the note to the\nlast Proposition.\nPROP. XL.  In proportion as each thing possesses more of\nperfection, so is it more active, and less passive; and, vice\nversa, in proportion as it is more active, so is it more perfect.\nProof.--In proportion as each thing is more perfect, it\npossesses more of reality (II. Def. vi.), and, consequently (III.\niii. and note), it is to that extent more active and less\npassive.  This demonstration may be reversed, and thus prove\nthat, in proportion as a thing is more active, so is it more\nperfect.  Q.E.D.\nCorollary.--Hence it follows that the part of the mind which\nendures, be it great or small, is more perfect than the rest.\nFor the eternal part of the mind (V. xxiii. xxix.) is the\nunderstanding, through which alone we are said to act (III. iii.);\nthe part which we have shown to perish is the imagination (V.\nxxi.), through which only we are said to be passive (III. iii.\nand general Def. of the Emotions); therefore, the former, be it\ngreat or small, is more perfect than the latter.  Q.E.D.\nNote.--Such are the doctrines which I had purposed to set\nforth concerning the mind, in so far as it is regarded without\nrelation to the body; whence, as also from I. xxi. and other\nplaces, it is plain that our mind, in so far as it understands,\nis an eternal mode of thinking, which is determined by another\neternal mode of thinking, and this other by a third, and so on to\ninfinity; so that all taken together at once constitute the\neternal and infinite intellect of God.\nPROP. XLI.  Even if we did not know that our mind is eternal, we\nshould still consider as of primary importance piety and\nreligion, and generally all things which, in Part IV., we showed\nto be attributable to courage and high--mindedness.\nProof.--The first and only foundation of virtue, or the rule\nof right living is (IV. xxii. Coroll. and xxiv.) seeking one's\nown true interest.  Now, while we determined what reason\nprescribes as useful, we took no account of the mind's eternity,\nwhich has only become known to us in this Fifth Part.  Although\nwe were ignorant at that time that the mind is eternal, we\nnevertheless stated that the qualities attributable to courage\nand high--mindedness are of primary importance.  Therefore, even\nif we were still ignorant of this doctrine, we should yet put the\naforesaid precepts of reason in the first place.  Q.E.D.\nNote.--The general belief of the multitude seems to be\ndifferent.  Most people seem to believe that they are free, in so\nfar as they may obey their lusts, and that they cede their\nrights, in so far as they are bound to live according to the\ncommandments of the divine law.  They therefore believe that\npiety, religion, and, generally, all things attributable to\nfirmness of mind, are burdens, which, after death, they hope to\nlay aside, and to receive the reward for their bondage, that is,\nfor their piety and religion; it is not only by this hope, but\nalso, and chiefly, by the fear of being horribly punished after\ndeath, that they are induced to live according to the divine\ncommandments, so far as their feeble and infirm spirit will carry\nthem.\nIf men had not this hope and this fear, but believed that the\nmind perishes with the body, and that no hope of prolonged life\nremains for the wretches who are broken down with the burden of\npiety, they would return to their own inclinations, controlling\neverything in accordance with their lusts, and desiring to obey\nfortune rather than themselves.  Such a course appears to me not\nless absurd than if a man, because he does not believe that he\ncan by wholesome food sustain his body for ever, should wish to\ncram himself with poisons and deadly fare; or if, because he\nsees that the mind is not eternal or immortal, he should prefer\nto be out of his mind altogether, and to live without the use of\nreason; these ideas are so absurd as to be scarcely worth\nrefuting.\nPROP. XLII.  Blessedness is not the reward of virtue, but virtue\nitself; neither do we rejoice therein, because we control our\nlusts, but, contrariwise, because we rejoice therein, we are able\nto control our lusts.\nProof.--Blessedness consists in love towards God (V. xxxvi and\nnote), which love springs from the third kind of knowledge (V.\nxxxii. Coroll.); therefore this love (III. iii. lix.) must be\nreferred to the mind, in so far as the latter is active;\ntherefore (IV. Def. viii.) it is virtue itself.  This was our\nfirst point.  Again, in proportion as the mind rejoices more in\nthis divine love or blessedness, so does it the more understand\n(V. xxxii.); that is (V. iii. Coroll.), so much the more power\nhas it over the emotions, and (V. xxxviii.) so much the less is\nit subject to those emotions which are evil; therefore, in\nproportion as the mind rejoices in this divine love or\nblessedness, so has it the power of controlling lusts.  And,\nsince human power in controlling the emotions consists solely in\nthe understanding, it follows that no one rejoices in\nblessedness, because he has controlled his lusts, but,\ncontrariwise, his power of controlling his lusts arises from this\nblessedness itself.  Q.E.D.\nNote.--I have thus completed all I wished to set forth\ntouching the mind's power over the emotions and the mind's\nfreedom.  Whence it appears, how potent is the wise man, and how\nmuch he surpasses the ignorant man, who is driven only by his\nlusts.  For the ignorant man is not only distracted in various\nways by external causes without ever gaining the true\nacquiescence of his spirit, but moreover lives, as it were\nunwitting of himself, and of God, and of things, and as soon as\nhe ceases to suffer, ceases also to be.\nWhereas the wise man, in so far as he is regarded as such, is\nscarcely at all disturbed in spirit, but, being conscious of\nhimself, and of God, and of things, by a certain eternal\nnecessity, never ceases to be, but always possesses true\nacquiescence of his spirit.\nIf the way which I have pointed out as leading to this result\nseems exceedingly hard, it may nevertheless be discovered.  Needs\nmust it be hard, since it is so seldom found.  How would it be\npossible, if salvation were ready to our hand, and could without\ngreat labour be found, that it should be by almost all men\nneglected? But all things excellent are as difficult as they are\nrare.\nEnd of the Ethics by Benedict de Spinoza\n[1] \"Affectiones\"\n[2] \"Forma\"\n[3] \"Animata\"\n[4] A Baconian phrase.  Nov. Org.
