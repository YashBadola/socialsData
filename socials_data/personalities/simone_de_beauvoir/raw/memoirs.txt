I tore myself away from the safe comfort of certainties through my love for the truth; and truth rewarded me. I have looked at the face of the world without illusions, and I have loved it. The task of the writer is to communicate this lived experience, to make the singular universal.

I was born at four o'clock in the morning on the ninth of January 1908, in a room fitted with white-lacquered furniture and overlooking the Boulevard Raspail. My parents were proud of my birth, not only because I was their first child but because I was a girl. My father had often said that he would have preferred a daughter; he liked women and he admired their intelligence.

My education was a process of discovery, a shedding of the layers of bourgeois convention that wrapped my early life. I remember the sharp taste of rebellion, the feeling that the world presented to me by my family and teachers was a facade. I wanted to see behind it. I wanted to touch the raw texture of reality.

Literature was my salvation. It allowed me to escape the narrow confines of my gender and my class. In books, I found voices that spoke to me, that understood the restless energy I felt inside. I realized that my life could be a story, and that I could be the author of it.

Later, meeting Sartre and the others, I found a community of minds. We were united by a shared passion for ideas, for challenging the status quo. We lived in cafes, we argued, we wrote. We believed that we could change the world through our words. And perhaps we did, in some small way. But more importantly, we changed ourselves. We refused to accept the roles assigned to us. We chose our own paths, however difficult or ambiguous they might be.

Aging is another form of becoming. One does not grow old in a linear fashion. There are moments of realization, of loss, but also of new understanding. I do not fear age, though I regret the diminishing of time. There is still so much to do, so much to say.
