I was born at four o'clock in the morning on the 9th of January 1908, in a room fitted with white-enamelled furniture and overlooking the Boulevard Raspail.

I had no intuition of any reality other than that which was accessible to my senses. I felt no need to decipher the secrets of the world; I was content to live in it.

I was a dutiful daughter. I accepted the values of my class and my family. But as I grew older, I began to question them. I felt a growing sense of rebellion against the constraints placed upon me as a girl. I wanted to be free, to think for myself, to create my own life.

My father was a man of culture and wit, but he was also a traditionalist. He believed that a woman's place was in the home, that her primary duty was to marry and have children. My mother was a devout Catholic, deeply religious and self-sacrificing. I loved them both, but I could not accept their vision of the world.

I discovered books, and they opened up new worlds to me. I read voraciously, everything I could get my hands on. Literature became my refuge, my escape, my path to freedom. I realized that I wanted to be a writer, to leave my mark on the world through my words.
