The Knight of Faith is the only happy man, the heir to the finite, while the Knight of Resignation is a stranger and a sojourner. But the Knight of Faith does this: he makes the movement of infinity, he resigns everything, and then he takes it all back by virtue of the absurd. This is the marvel of faith.

To suspend the ethical? Yes, for the sake of a higher telos. Abraham is the Knight of Faith precisely because he is willing to sacrifice Isaac, his beloved son, not because he hates him (that would be murder), but because he loves God more. Yet, at the same time, he believes he will get Isaac back. This is the paradox that thought cannot grasp. The ethical expression for what Abraham did is that he would murder Isaac; the religious expression is that he would sacrifice Isaac. But precisely in this contradiction is the dread which can only be pleasing to the sleepless.
