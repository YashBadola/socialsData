Preface

Not only in the world of commerce but also in the world of ideas our age is putting on a veritable clearance sale. Everything can be had so dirt cheap that one begins to wonder whether in the end anyone will want to make a bid. Every speculative price-setter who conscientiously directs attention to the significant march of modern philosophy, every privat-docent, tutor, and student, every crofter and cottar in philosophy, is not content with stopping at doubting everything but goes further. It might be asked where they are going, but surely it is polite and modest to assume that they have doubted everything, since otherwise it would be odd to say that they were going further. Having performed this preliminary movement, they have possibly come to the conclusion that they did not find what they were looking for, or rather, did not find it in the way they were looking for it. So they are going further.

Problem I: Is there a Teleological Suspension of the Ethical?

The ethical as such is the universal, and as the universal it applies to everyone, which may be expressed from another point of view by saying that it applies every instant. It rests immanent in itself, has nothing without itself which is its telos, but is itself telos for everything outside it, and when this has been incorporated by the ethical it can go no further. Conceived immediately as physical and psychical, the particular individual is the individual who has his telos in the universal, and his ethical task is to express himself constantly in it, to abolish his particularity in order to become the universal. As soon as the individual asserts himself in his particularity over against the universal, he sins, and only by recognizing this can he again reconcile himself with the universal. Yet every time the individual after he has entered the universal asserts himself as the particular, he is in sin (though in a way this is the beginning of the spiritual trial), and he can recover himself only by repentance.

Faith is precisely this paradox, that the single individual is higher than the universal, yet in such a way, be it observed, that the movement repeats itself, and that consequently the single individual who was in the universal, now as the single individual sets himself above the universal. If this is not faith, then Abraham is lost, then faith has never existed in the world... because it has always existed. For if the ethical (i.e., the moral) is the highest thing, and if nothing incommensurable remains in man in any other way but as the evil (i.e., the particular which has to be expressed in the universal), then one needs no other categories than those which the Greek philosophy possessed or which can be deduced from them by the most consistent logic. But the result of this is that the whole of existence demands an explanation, and if the explanation is not found, then existence is a riddle.

Abraham is the Knight of Faith. He believed by virtue of the absurd; for all human calculation had long since ceased to function. He did not believe that he should be happy sometime in the hereafter, but that he should find blessedness here in this world. God could give him a new Isaac, could recall the one sacrificed to life. He believed by virtue of the absurd, for there was no question of human calculation anymore.

The Knight of Infinite Resignation is easily distinguished from the Knight of Faith. The Knight of Infinite Resignation makes the movement of infinity, but he does so by his own strength. He can do it, for he has only to be infinite in his resignation. But the Knight of Faith does something more. He makes the movement of infinity, and then he makes the movement of finitude by virtue of the absurd. This is the great paradox.

To exist is an art. The subjective thinker is an artist who works on himself.
