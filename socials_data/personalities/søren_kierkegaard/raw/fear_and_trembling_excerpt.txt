Preface

Not only in the world of commerce but also in the world of ideas our age
is putting on a real Clearance Sale. Everything may be had at such a
dog-cheap price that one begins to wonder whether in the end there will
be anyone left to bid. Every speculative price-fixer who conscientiously
directs attention to the significant march of modern philosophy, every
Privatdocent, tutor, and student, every crofter and cottar in philosophy,
is not content with doubting everything but goes further. Perhaps it would
be untimely and ill-timed to ask them where they are going, but surely it
is courteous and unobtrusive to regard it as certain that they have doubted
everything, since otherwise it would be a queer thing for them to be going
further. This preliminary movement they have therefore all of them made,
and presumably with such ease that they do not think it necessary to waste
a word about the how; for not even the man who anxiously and with deep
concern sought a little enlightenment by means of the terrible writings of
the older doubters--not even he found any hint about the how, or any
instruction toward acquiring the art...

Faith is precisely this paradox, that the individual as the particular is
higher than the universal, is justified over against it, is not subordinate
but superior--yet in such a way, be it observed, that it is the particular
individual who, after he has been subordinated as the particular to the
universal, now through the universal becomes the individual who as the
particular is superior to the universal, for the fact that the individual
as the particular stands in an absolute relation to the absolute. This
position cannot be mediated, for all mediation comes about precisely by
virtue of the universal; it is and remains to all eternity a paradox,
accessible to faith. And here again the same thing happens as with the
story of Abraham. If this paradox is not maintained, then Abraham is not
a hero but a murderer...

But what did Abraham do? He arrived neither too early nor too late. He
mounted the ass and rode slowly out along the way. All that time he
believed--he believed that God would not require Isaac of him, whereas
he was willing nevertheless to sacrifice him if it was required. He
believed by virtue of the absurd; for there was no question of human
calculation, and it was indeed the absurd that God who required it of
him should the next instant recall the requirement. He climbed the
mountain, even at the instant when the knife glittered he believed. He
did not hope that he would restore Isaac to his tent, but he believed
that God would do it, who has so many ways...
