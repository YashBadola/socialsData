I was born at four o'clock in the morning on the 9th of January 1908, in a room fitted with white-lacquered furniture and overlooking the Boulevard Raspail.

My father was a man of tradition, my mother a woman of faith. I was to become the girl who would break with both.

I remember clearly the feeling of my own existence, heavy and sweet, like a ripened fruit.

I wanted to live everything, to read everything, to see everything. I wanted to crunch the world like an apple.

My friendship with Sartre was to become the one undoubted success of my life. But even before him, I had decided that my life would be my own creation.

Death is not the end of life; it is a part of life. We must live in the face of it, without fear, without resignation.

The most important thing is to be true to oneself, to one's own freedom. To accept the responsibility of creating one's own values.
