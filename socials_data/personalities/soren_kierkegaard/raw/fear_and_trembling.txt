The ethical is the universal, but faith is the paradox that the single individual is higher than the universal. Abraham is the knight of faith. He is not a tragic hero. The tragic hero acts within the ethical, sacrificing himself for the universal. But Abraham? Abraham acts absurdly. He acts by virtue of the absurd. He is willing to sacrifice Isaac, his only son, the son of the promise, because God commanded it. And yet, he believes he will receive Isaac back.

This is the teleological suspension of the ethical. There is no ethical justification for Abraham's action. Ethically, he is a murderer. Religiously, he is a sacrifice. The difference is faith. Faith is not a feeling, it is a movement. It is the infinite movement of resignation, followed by the movement of faith, by virtue of the absurd.

Infinite resignation is the last stage before faith, so that anyone who has not made this movement does not have faith; for only in the infinite resignation do I become clear to myself in my eternal validity, and only then can there be any question of grasping existence by virtue of faith.

To exist as the single individual is the most terrible thing of all.
