PREFACE

Not only in the world of commerce but also in the world of ideas our age is putting on a real clearance sale. Everything may be had at such a bargain that it is questionable whether in the end there is anybody who will want to bid. Every speculative price-watcher who conscientiously signals the significant progress of modern philosophy, every Assistant Professor, tutor, and student, every crofter and cottar in philosophy, is not content with doubting everything but goes further. It might be untimely and ill-advised to ask them where they are going, but surely it is courteous and unobtrusive to take it for granted that they have doubted everything, since otherwise it would be queer to say that they were going further. This preliminary movement they have therefore all of them made, and presumably with such ease that they do not think it necessary to waste a word about the how; for not even he who anxiously and with deep concern sought a little enlightenment in the standard works found any such thing, found any instruction about how one is to set about it to begin to doubt.

STORY OF ABRAHAM

There was once a man who in his childhood had heard the beautiful story of how God tempted Abraham, and how he endured the temptation, kept the faith, and a second time received again a son contrary to expectation. When the child became older he read the same story with even greater admiration, for life had separated what was united in the pious simplicity of the child. The older he became, the more frequently his thoughts turned to that story, his enthusiasm became greater and greater, and yet he was less and less able to understand the story. At last he forgot everything else in his thoughts of it; his soul had but one wish, to see Abraham, one longing, to have been witness to that event. His desire was not to see the beautiful countries of the Orient, or the earthly glory of the Promised Land, or that godfearing couple whose old age God had blessed, or the venerable figure of the aged patriarch, or the vigorous youth of Isaac whom God had bestowed—it was no such thing he desired to see, but the temptation itself and the movement of faith.

If there were no eternal consciousness in a man, if at the foundation of all there lay only a wildly seething power which writhing with obscure passions produced everything that is great and everything that is insignificant, if a bottomless void never satiated lay hidden beneath all—what then would life be but despair? If it were thus, if there were no sacred bond which united mankind, if one generation arose after another like the leafage of a forest, if the one generation replaced the other like the song of birds in the forest, if the human race passed through the world as the ship goes through the sea, like the wind through the desert, a thoughtless and fruitless activity, if an eternal oblivion were always lurking hungrily for its prey and there were no power strong enough to wrest it from its maw—how empty then and comfortless life would be! But therefore it is not thus...

Faith is precisely this paradox, that the individual as the particular is higher than the universal, is justified over against it, is not subordinate but superior—yet in such a way, be it observed, that it is the particular individual who, after he has been subordinated as the particular to the universal, now through the universal becomes the individual who as the particular is superior to the universal, for the fact that the individual as the particular stands in an absolute relation to the absolute.
