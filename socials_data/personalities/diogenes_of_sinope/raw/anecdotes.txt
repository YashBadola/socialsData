1. Alexander the Great and the Sun
When Alexander the Great visited Diogenes in Corinth, he found the philosopher sunning himself. Alexander, standing over him, said, "Ask of me whatever you wish." Diogenes replied, "Stand a little out of my sun." Alexander was so struck by this, and admired so much the haughtiness and grandeur of the man who had nothing but scorn for him, that he said to his followers, who were laughing and mocking the philosopher as they went away, "But truly, if I were not Alexander, I would be Diogenes."

2. The Search for an Honest Man
Diogenes was often seen walking through the streets of Athens in broad daylight carrying a lit lamp. When asked what he was doing, he would reply, "I am just looking for a human being" (often translated as "I am looking for an honest man").

3. Plato's Featherless Biped
When Plato gave the definition of man as "featherless biped" and was praised for it, Diogenes plucked a chicken and brought it into Plato's Academy, saying, "Behold! I've brought you a man." After this incident, "with broad flat nails" was added to Plato's definition.

4. Throwing Away the Cup
Diogenes owned nothing but a cloak, a staff, and a wooden bowl. One day, he saw a child drinking from his hands at a fountain. Diogenes threw away his bowl, saying, "A child has beaten me in plainness of living."

5. Begging from Statues
He was once seen begging for alms from a statue. When asked why he did this, he replied, "I am practicing being rejected."

6. Sale into Slavery
When he was captured by pirates and put up for sale as a slave, the auctioneer asked him what he was skilled in. Diogenes replied, "Governing men." He then pointed to a certain Corinthian named Xeniades and said, "Sell me to this man; he needs a master." Xeniades bought him and made him the tutor to his children.

7. Public Indecency
Diogenes would often perform bodily functions in public to demonstrate his rejection of social norms. When criticized for eating in the marketplace, he replied, "I felt hungry in the marketplace." When criticized for masturbating in public, he said, "If only it were as easy to banish hunger by rubbing my belly."

8. Walking Backwards
Once he was seen walking backwards in the rain. When asked why, he said, "I am practicing not going forward in a world that goes the wrong way." Or, in another version, to show that most people walk blindly through life.

9. On Exile
When someone reminded him that the people of Sinope had sentenced him to exile, he replied, "And I sentenced them to stay home."

10. Lentils and the King
Diogenes was eating lentils, a cheap food. Aristippus, a philosopher who lived comfortably by flattering the king, passed by and said, "If you would learn to be subservient to the king, you would not have to live on lentils." Diogenes replied, "If you had learnt to live on lentils, you would not have to be subservient to the king."

11. The Rich Man's House
A rich man once invited Diogenes to his house and warned him not to spit on the floor or furniture because everything was so expensive and clean. Diogenes, needing to spit, cleared his throat and spat in the rich man's face, saying it was the only dirty place he could find.

12. Solvitur Ambulando
When he heard Zeno of Elea denying motion, he stood up and walked around.

13. On Burial
When asked how he wished to be buried, he said, "Face down." When asked why, he replied, "Because in a little while, everything will be turned upside down." (Referring to the belief that the Macedonians were rising in power and the world order was changing). Another time he said, "Throw me outside the city wall." When friends asked if he didn't mind the wolves eating him, he said, "Not at all, as long as you provide me with a stick to drive them away." "But you will be unconscious," they said. "Then why should I care what happens to me when I am unconscious?" he replied.

14. The Hairy Man
To a man who was very superstitious he said, "Do you not see that the gods are good to you? For if you were a good man, they would not have given you such a face." And to a young man who was behaving effeminately, "Are you not ashamed to have intended for yourself a worse fate than nature gave you? For nature made you a man, but you are forcing yourself to play the woman." (Note: This might be conflated with other anecdotes, but reflects his blunt style).

15. One Way Street
He once went into a theatre while everyone else was leaving. When asked why, he said, "It is what I have been practising all my life."
