Say assertion, question, and command? - There are countless kinds: countless different kinds of use of what we call \"symbols\", \"words\", \"sentences\". And this multiplicity is not something fixed, given once for all; but new types of language, new language-games, as we may say, come into existence, and others become obsolete and get forgotten.\n23.
