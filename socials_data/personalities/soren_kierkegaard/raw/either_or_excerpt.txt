What is a poet? An unhappy man who in his heart harbors a deep anguish, but whose lips are so fashioned that the moans and cries which pass over them are transformed into ravishing music. His fate is like that of the unfortunate victims whom the tyrant Phalaris imprisoned in a brazen bull, and slowly tortured over a steady fire; their cries could not reach the tyrant's ears so as to strike terror into his heart; when they reached him they sounded like sweet music. And men crowd about the poet and say to him, 'Sing for us soon again'—which is as much as to say, 'May new sufferings torment your soul, but may your lips be fashioned as before; for the cries would only distress us, but the music is delicious.' And the critics come forward and say, 'That is perfectly done—just as the rules of aesthetics demand.' To be sure, a critic resembles a poet to a hair; he only lacks the anguish in his heart and the music upon his lips. I tell you, I would rather be a swineherd, understood by the swine, than be a poet and be misunderstood by men.

I feel as if I were a piece in a game of chess, when my opponent says of it: That piece cannot be moved.

My life is like an eternal night...

I do not care for anything. I do not care to ride, for the exercise is too violent. I do not care to walk, it is too strenuous. I do not care to lie down, for I should either have to remain lying, and I do not care to do that, or I should have to get up again, and I do not care to do that either. Summa summarum: I do not care at all.

What is it that binds me? Of what was the chain formed that bound the Fenris wolf? It was wrought of the noise of cats' paws walking on the ground, of the breath of fish, of the spittle of birds, of the roots of mountains. I was bound by a chain formed of gloomy fancies, of alarming dreams, of troubled thoughts, of fearful presentiments, of inexplicable anxieties. This chain is 'very flexible, soft as silk, yields to the most powerful strain, and cannot be torn apart.'

Let others complain that the age is wicked; my complaint is that it is paltry; for it lacks passion. Men's thoughts are thin and flimsy like lace, they are themselves pitiable like the lacemakers. The thoughts of their hearts are too paltry to be sinful. For a worm it might be regarded as a sin to harbor such thoughts, but not for a being made in the image of God. Their lusts are dull and sluggish, their passions sleepy. They do their duty, these shopkeeping souls, but they clip the coin a trifle, like the Jews; they think that even if the Lord keeps a careful register of our sins, He may perhaps let one or two pass unpunished.
