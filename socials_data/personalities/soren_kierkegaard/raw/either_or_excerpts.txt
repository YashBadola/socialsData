From the Papers of A

"What is a poet? An unhappy man who in his heart harbors a deep anguish, but whose lips are so fashioned that the sighs and cries which pass over them are transformed into ravishing music."

"I have the courage, I believe, to doubt everything; I have the courage, I believe, to fight with everything; but I have not the courage to know anything; not the courage to possess, to own anything."

"My sorrow is my castle."

"Marry, and you will regret it; do not marry, you will also regret it; marry or do not marry, you will regret it either way. Laugh at the world's foolishness, you will regret it; weep over it, you will regret that too; laugh at the world's foolishness or weep over it, you will regret both. Believe a woman, you will regret it; believe her not, you will also regret it... Hang yourself, you will regret it; do not hang yourself, and you will regret that too; hang yourself or spare yourself, you will regret it either way; whether you hang yourself or do not hang yourself, you will regret both. This, gentlemen, is the essence of all philosophy."

"The Rotation of Crops"

People are always bored. Boredom is the root of all evil. It is very curious that boredom, which itself has such a calm and sedate nature, can have such a capacity to initiate motion. The effect of boredom is usually strongest when it is least expected...

"Diapsalmata"

I feel as if I were a piece in a game of chess, when my opponent says of it: That piece cannot be moved.

From the Papers of B (Judge William)

"Equilibrium between the Esthetical and the Ethical in the Composition of Personality"

My friend, I have loved you, and in a certain sense I love you still. But you are an aesthetician, and as such you are in despair, whether you know it or not.

The aesthetic choice is either entirely immediate and to that extent no choice, or it loses itself in the multifarious. Thus, when a young girl follows the choice of her heart, this choice, however beautiful it may be, is in the strictest sense no choice, since it is entirely immediate.

But the ethical choice is to choose oneself. And in choosing oneself, one chooses the absolute, for the self is the absolute.

"The Validity of Marriage"

Marriage is the highest telos of individual existence...
