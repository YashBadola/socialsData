{"text": "The Sickness Unto Death is Despair.\nA human being is spirit. But what is spirit? Spirit is the self. But what is the self? The self is a relation that relates itself to itself or is the relation's relating itself to itself in the relation; the self is not the relation but is the relation's relating itself to itself. A human being is a synthesis of the infinite and the finite, of the temporal and the eternal, of freedom and necessity, in short, a synthesis. A synthesis is a relation between two. Considered in this way, a human being is still not a self.\nIn the relation between two, the relation is the third as a negative unity, and the two relate to the relation and in the relation to the relation; thus under the qualification of the psychical the relation between the psychical and the physical is a relation. But if the relation relates itself to itself, this relation is the positive third, and this is the self.\n...\nDespair is the sickness unto death.\nThe concept of the sickness unto death must be understood in a peculiar sense. Literally it means a sickness the end and outcome of which is death. Thus one speaks of a mortal sickness as a sickness unto death. In this sense despair cannot be called the sickness unto death. But in the Christian understanding death is itself a transition unto life. In this way there is from the Christian point of view no earthly, physical sickness that is the sickness unto death. For death is strictly speaking not the end, but death is only a \"farewell\" to the earth.\nIf, however, there is a sickness unto death, it must be one in which the last thing is death, and death the last thing. And this is precisely despair.\nYet in another sense despair is even more definitely the sickness unto death. It is indeed very far from being true that, literally understood, one dies of this sickness, or that this sickness ends with physical death. On the contrary, the torment of despair is precisely this: not to be able to die.", "source": "sickness_unto_death_excerpt.txt"}
{"text": "What is a poet? An unhappy man who in his heart harbors a deep anguish, but whose lips are so fashioned that the sighs and cries which pass over them are transformed into ravishing music. His fate is like that of the unfortunate victims whom the tyrant Phalaris imprisoned in a brazen bull, and slowly tortured over a steady fire; their cries could not reach the tyrant\u2019s ears so as to strike terror into his heart; when they reached his ears they sounded like sweet music.\nAnd men crowd about the poet and say to him, \u201cSing for us soon again\u201d\u2014which is as much as to say, \u201cMay new sufferings torment your soul, but may your lips be fashioned as before; for the cries would only distress us, but the music is delicious.\u201d And the critics come forward and say, \u201cThat is perfectly done\u2014just as it should be, according to the rules of aesthetics.\u201d Now it is understood that a critic resembles a poet to a hair; he only lacks the anguish in his heart and the music upon his lips. I tell you, I would rather be a swineherd, understood by the swine, than be a poet and be misunderstood by men.\n...\nI have but one friend, the echo; and why is he my friend? Because I love my sorrow, and the echo does not take it away from me. I have only one confidant, the silence of the night; and why is it my confidant? Because it remains silent.\n...\nMarry, and you will regret it; do not marry, you will also regret it; marry or do not marry, you will regret it either way. Laugh at the world\u2019s foolishness, you will regret it; weep over it, you will regret that too; laugh at the world\u2019s foolishness or weep over it, you will regret both. Believe a woman, you will regret it; believe her not, you will also regret it... Hang yourself, you will regret it; do not hang yourself, and you will regret that too; hang yourself or don't hang yourself, you'll regret it either way; whether you hang yourself or do not hang yourself, you will regret both. This, gentlemen, is the essence of all philosophy.", "source": "either_or_excerpt.txt"}
{"text": "Preface\nNot only in the world of commerce but also in the world of ideas our age is putting on a veritable clearance sale. Everything can be had so dirt cheap that one begins to wonder whether in the end anyone will want to make a bid. Every speculative price-fixer who conscientiously directs the attention of the significant moments of modern philosophy to the stock market, every speculative freelance who in the interest of science, to be sure, but also on his own behalf, is always ready to sell out\u2014they all are so zealous to harvest the demands of the times for a clearance sale of everything even before they are made that it almost seems as if they feared that the demands would not be made, something that would indeed be a great distress, for what, then, would they have to dispose of?\n...\nFaith is precisely this paradox, that the single individual as the single individual is higher than the universal, is justified before it, not as inferior to it but as superior\u2014yet in such a way, please note, that it is the single individual who, after having been subordinate as the single individual to the universal, now by means of the universal becomes the single individual who as the single individual is superior, that the single individual as the single individual stands in an absolute relation to the absolute. This position cannot be mediated, for all mediation comes about precisely by virtue of the universal; it is and remains to all eternity a paradox, inaccessible to thought. And yet faith is this paradox\u2014or else (these are the logical deductions which I would beg the reader to have in mente at every point, though it would be too prolix for me to reiterate them on every occasion)\u2014or else there is no faith, precisely because there is no such thing as faith, and Abraham is lost, and the whole of existence is a trial and a tribulation.\nIf this is the case, then the ethical is the highest and nothing more can be said, for then the ethical is the divine and the divine is the ethical. Then there is no teleological suspension of the ethical, for the ethical is the telos for everything, and there is nothing outside it.\nBut if the ethical (i.e., the universal) is the highest, and if there is nothing incommensurable in man, then the individual is morally and religiously justified only by being the universal, and he is a sinner only by asserting himself as the particular over against the universal.", "source": "fear_and_trembling_excerpt.txt"}
