Marry, and you will regret it; do not marry, you will also regret it; marry or do not marry, you will regret it either way.
Laugh at the world's foolishness, you will regret it; weep over it, you will regret that too; laugh at the world's foolishness or weep over it, you will regret both.
Believe a woman, you will regret it; believe her not, you will also regret it...
Hang yourself, you will regret it; do not hang yourself, and you will regret that too; hang yourself or do not hang yourself, you will regret it either way; whether you hang yourself or do not hang yourself, you will regret both.
