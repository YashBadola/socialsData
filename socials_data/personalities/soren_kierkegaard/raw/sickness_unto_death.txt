The Sickness Unto Death

Preface

The form of this exposition is such that it might seem perhaps to some people strictly speaking not to be edifying. It is, however, edifying in the strictest sense, inasmuch as it is Christian; and if it is not edifying in the Christian sense, it is not edifying at all. The fact that the form is not edifying in the ordinary sense is due to the fact that the exposition is dialectical. But just as this work is not written for edification in the ordinary sense, so neither is it written for the sake of edification in the ordinary sense. It is written for edification in the Christian sense, and therefore for upbuilding in the Christian sense.

Chapter 1: The Sickness Unto Death is Despair

Man is spirit. But what is spirit? Spirit is the self. But what is the self? The self is a relation which relates itself to its own self, or it is that in the relation [which accounts for it] that the relation relates itself to its own self; the self is not the relation but [consists in the fact] that the relation relates itself to its own self. Man is a synthesis of the infinite and the finite, of the temporal and the eternal, of freedom and necessity, in short it is a synthesis. A synthesis is a relation between two factors. So regarded, man is not yet a self.

In the relation between two, the relation is the third term as a negative unity, and the two relate themselves to the relation, and in the relation to the relation; such a relation is that between soul and body, when man is regarded as soul. But if, on the contrary, the relation relates itself to its own self, the relation is then the positive third term, and this is the self.

Such a relation which relates itself to its own self (that is to say, a self) must either have constituted itself or have been constituted by another.

If this relation which relates itself to its own self is constituted by another, the relation doubtless is the third term, but this relation (the third term) is in turn a relation relating itself to that which constituted the whole relation.

Such a derived, constituted, relation is the human self, a relation which relates itself to its own self, and in relating itself to its own self relates itself to another. Hence it is that there can be two forms of despair in the strict sense. If the human self had constituted itself, there could be only one form: not to will to be oneself, to will to get rid of oneself, but there could be no question of despairing to will to be oneself. This formula [i.e. that the self is constituted by another] is the expression for the total dependence of the relation (the self), the expression for the fact that the self cannot of itself attain and remain in equilibrium and rest by itself, but only by relating itself to that which constituted the whole relation.
