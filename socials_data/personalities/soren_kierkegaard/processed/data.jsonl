One is to believe what isn't true; the other is to refuse to believe what is true.\nAnxiety is the dizziness of freedom.\nTo dare is to lose one's footing momentarily. Not to dare is to lose oneself.\nThe highest and most beautiful things in life are not to be heard about, nor read about, nor seen; but, if one will, are to be lived.\nIt is perfectly true, as philosophers say, that life must be understood backwards. But they forget the other proposition, that it must be lived forwards.\nThe function of prayer is not to influence God, but rather to change the nature of the one who prays.\nFace the facts of being what you are, for that is what changes what you are.\nThe proud person always wants to do the right thing, the great thing. But because he wants to do it in his own strength, he is fighting not with man, but with God.\nMarry, and you will regret it; don\u2019t marry, you will also regret it; marry or don\u2019t marry, you will regret it either way. Laugh at the world\u2019s foolishness, you will regret it; weep over it, you will also regret it; laugh at the world\u2019s foolishness or weep over it, you will regret it either way; believe a woman, you will regret it; believe her not, you will also regret it\u2026 Hang yourself, you will regret it; do not hang yourself, and you will regret that too; hang yourself or don\u2019t hang yourself, you\u2019ll regret it either way; whether you hang yourself or do not hang yourself, you will regret both. This, gentlemen, is the essence of all philosophy.\nFaith is precisely this paradox, that the individual as the particular is higher than the universal, is justified vis-\u00e0-vis it, is not subordinate but superior\u2014yet in such a way, be it observed, that it is the particular individual who, after he has been subordinated as the particular to the universal, now through the universal becomes the individual who as the particular is superior to the universal, for the fact that the individual as the particular stands in an absolute relation to the absolute.\nWhat I really need is to get clear about what I must do, not what I must know, except insofar as knowledge must precede every act. What matters is to find a purpose, to see what it really is that God wills that I shall do; the crucial thing is to find a truth which is truth for me, to find the idea for which I am willing to live and die.\nTruth is subjectivity.\nIf I were to wish for anything, I should not wish for wealth and power, but for the passionate sense of the potential, for the eye which, ever young and ardent, sees the possible. Pleasure disappoints, possibility never. And what wine is so sparkling, what so fragrant, what so intoxicating, as possibility!\nListen to the cry of a woman in labor at the hour of giving birth \u2014 look at the dying man\u2019s struggle at his last extremity, and then tell me whether something that begins and ends thus could be intended for enjoyment.\nA fire broke out backstage in a theatre.

Between these two instants lies the leap, which no science has explained and no science can explain.\nHe who has learned to be anxious in the right way has learned the ultimate.\nAnxiety is a qualification of dreaming spirit, and as such it has its place in the psychology. Awake, the difference between myself and my other is posited; sleeping, it is suspended; dreaming, it is an intimated nothing.\nThe reality of the spirit constantly shows itself as a form that tempts its possibility but disappears as soon as it grabs for it, and it is a nothing that can only have anxiety. The concept of anxiety is almost never treated in psychology. Therefore, I must point out that it is altogether different from fear and similar concepts that refer to something definite, whereas anxiety is freedom's reality as possibility for possibility.\nIf we ask what is the object of anxiety, the answer as usual is that it is nothing. Anxiety and nothing always correspond to each other.", "source": "anxiety.txt"}
