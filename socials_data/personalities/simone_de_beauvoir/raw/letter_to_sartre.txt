My Dear Sartre,

I have been thinking a great deal about our conversation at the Café de Flore yesterday regarding the responsibility of the intellectual. You argue, with that characteristic absolutism of yours, that to not choose is still a choice. Of course, I agree in principle. We are condemned to be free. But I worry that you sometimes underestimate the weight of the *situation*.

When we look at the young student who came to you for advice during the war—torn between staying with his mother or joining the Free French—you told him: "You are free, choose, that is to say, invent." This is true, philosophically. But practically? The anguish of that choice is not merely an intellectual puzzle; it is a tearing of the self.

I am writing a new piece on the ambiguity of political action. It seems to me that we often dirty our hands not because we want to, but because the world itself is dirty. To seek a purity of action is to wish to be an angel, and as Pascal said, he who wishes to play the angel plays the beast. We must accept that our actions will have consequences we did not intend, and that sometimes, to do right by one, we must do wrong by another. This does not absolve us; it only makes the burden of freedom heavier.

I shall be working late tonight. The air in Paris is heavy with the coming storm.

Yours,
Castor
