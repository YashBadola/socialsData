{"text": "AMBIGUITY AND FREEDOM\nThe continuous work of our life is to build death. Man knows and thinks this tragic ambivalence which the animal and the plant merely undergo. A new paradox is thereby introduced into his destiny. \"Rational animal,\" \"thinking reed,\" he escapes from his natural condition without, however, freeing himself from it. He is still a part of this world of which he is a consciousness. He asserts himself as a pure internality against which no external power can take hold, and he also experiences himself as a thing crushed by the dark weight of other things. At every moment he can grasp the non-temporal truth of his existence. But between the past which no longer is and the future which is not yet, this moment when he exists is nothing. This privilege, which he alone possesses, of being a sovereign and unique subject amidst a universe of objects, is what he shares with all his fellow-men. In turn an object for others, he is nothing more than an individual in the collectivity on which he depends.\nAs long as there have been men and they have lived, they have all felt this tragic ambiguity of their condition, but as long as there have been philosophers and they have thought, most of them have tried to mask it. They have striven to reduce mind to matter, or to reabsorb matter into mind, or to merge them within a single substance. Those who have accepted the dualism have established a hierarchy between body and soul which permits of considering as negligible the part of the self which cannot be saved. They have denied death, either by integrating it with life or by promising to man immortality. Or, knowning the reality of man's being and his being in the world, they have simply refused to act.\nExistentialism asserts that there is no fixed human nature. We are what we make of ourselves. This is the meaning of freedom. But this freedom is not a given state of peace; it is a constant struggle. To will oneself free is also to will others free. This will is not an abstract formula. It represents a concrete bond with the world and with others.\nThe man who seeks to justify his life must want freedom itself absolutely and above everything else. At the same time that it requires the realization of concrete ends, of particular projects, it requires itself universally. It is not enough to say that each man is free; he must assume his freedom. And he cannot assume it without assuming the freedom of others.\nThe serious man, on the contrary, gets rid of his freedom by claiming to subordinate it to values which would be unconditioned. He imagines that the accession to these values consoles him for his existential lack. He is a tyrant of his own life and often a tyrant to others, because he does not recognize the ambiguity of his condition. He takes himself for a thing.\nWe must face the ambiguity. We must realize that our actions have consequences, that we are responsible for the world we shape. There is no escape in determinism. We are condemned to be free.", "source": "02_ethics_ambiguity_freedom.txt"}
{"text": "INTRODUCTION\nFor a long time I have hesitated to write a book on woman. The subject is irritating, especially to women; and it is not new. Enough ink has been spilled in quarreling over feminism, and perhaps we should say no more about it. It is still talked about, however, for the voluminous nonsense uttered during the last century seems to have done little to illuminate the problem. After all, is there a problem? And if so, what is it? Are there women, really? Most assuredly the theory of the eternal feminine still has its adherents who will whisper in your ear: \"Even in Russia women still are women\"; and other well-informed persons\u2014sometimes the very same\u2014say with a sigh: \"Woman is losing her way, woman is lost.\" One wonders if women still exist, if they will always exist, whether or not it is desirable that they should, what place they occupy in this world, what their place should be. \"What has become of women?\" was asked recently in an ephemeral magazine.\nBut first we must ask: what is a woman? \"Tota mulier in utero\", says one, \"woman is a womb\". But in speaking of certain women, connoisseurs declare that they are not women, although they are equipped with a uterus like the rest. All agree in recognizing the fact that females exist in the human species; today as always they make up about half of humanity. And yet we are told that femininity is in danger; we are exhorted to be women, remain women, become women. It would appear, then, that every female human being is not necessarily a woman; to be so considered she must share in that mysterious and threatened reality known as femininity. Is this attribute something secreted by the ovaries? Or is it a Platonic essence, a product of the philosophic imagination? Is a rustling petticoat enough to bring it down to earth? Although some women try zealously to incarnate this essence, it is hardly patentable. It is frequently described in vague and dazzling terms that seem to have been borrowed from the vocabulary of the seers, and indeed it appears to the bulk of society that to be a woman is not a mere fact of nature, but the result of a cultural history.\nOne is not born, but rather becomes, a woman. No biological, psychological, or economic fate determines the figure that the human female presents in society; it is civilization as a whole that produces this creature, intermediate between male and eunuch, which is described as feminine. Only the intervention of someone else can establish an individual as an Other. The child would not grasp the fact of being a sexually differentiated being if it were not for the intervention of social structures.\nThe category of the Other is as primordial as consciousness itself. In the most primitive societies, in the most ancient mythologies, one finds the expression of a duality\u2014that of the Self and the Other. This duality was not originally attached to the division of the sexes; it was not dependent upon any empirical facts. It is deduced from the structure of consciousness itself. But why is it that women do not dispute this male sovereignty? No subject will readily volunteer to become the object, the inessential; it is not the Other who, in defining himself as the Other, establishes the One. The Other is posed as such by the One in defining himself as the One. But if the Other is not to regain the status of being the One, he must be submissive enough to accept this alien point of view. Whence comes this submission in the case of woman?\nThere are no necessary conditions that dictate this hierarchy. It is not nature that defines woman's place, but the context of history and social relation. The perspective of existentialist ethics allows us to understand that human beings are free, and yet they are constantly tempted to flee their freedom, to reify themselves into things. This is what we call bad faith. But for woman, the situation is complex because she is often forced into a position of immanence, of stagnation, by the heavy hand of patriarchal tradition, while she aspires, as a human being, to transcendence.", "source": "01_introduction_second_sex.txt"}
{"text": "PERSONAL FREEDOM AND THE OTHER\nThe problem of the Other is central to my thought. How can one be free without infringing on the freedom of others? And yet, how can one be free alone?\nI have always felt that my own freedom was inextricably linked to the freedom of those around me. When I was a young girl, I fought against the constraints of my bourgeois upbringing. I wanted to possess the world, to know everything, to experience everything. But I soon realized that my desire to be everything could lead to a form of solipsism, a denial of the reality of others.\nLater, in my partnership with Sartre and in my political engagements, I understood that true freedom is not the license to do whatever one pleases, but the power to create oneself and the world in a way that opens up possibilities for others. To oppress another is to enclose them in immanence, to reduce them to an object. This acts back upon the oppressor, who becomes a jailer, bound to the prison he has created.\nIn \"The Mandarins,\" I explored the difficulties of political engagement and personal happiness. Can one be happy in a world full of suffering? Is it a betrayal to seek personal joy? I concluded that one must not sacrifice the present entirely for the future, nor the self entirely for the cause. There must be a balance. One must live one's life, but live it in a way that is engaged with the realities of the time.\nThe writer, the intellectual, has a specific responsibility. To speak is to act. To name the world is to reveal it, and to reveal it is to begin to change it. We cannot remain silent in the face of injustice. Silence itself is a choice, a form of action.\nMy life has been an attempt to live this philosophy\u2014not just to think it, but to embody it. To accept the ambiguity of being a body and a consciousness, a self and an Other. To love without losing oneself, to write without lying, to act without fanaticism. This is the difficult path of authentic existence.", "source": "03_personal_freedom.txt"}
