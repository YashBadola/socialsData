The waking have one common world, but the sleeping turn aside each into a world of his own.

To those who are awake, there is one ordered universe common (to all), whereas in sleep each turns away to one of his own.

Fools when they do hear are like the deaf: of them does the saying bear witness that they are absent when present.

Eyes and ears are bad witnesses to men if they have souls that understand not the language.

The many do not take heed of such things as those they meet with, nor do they mark them when they are taught, but they think they do.

Dogs bark at everyone they do not know.

One man is ten thousand to me, if he be the best.
