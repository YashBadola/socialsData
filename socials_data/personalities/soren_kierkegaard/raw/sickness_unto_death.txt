The Sickness Unto Death
by Anti-Climacus

Part First
The Sickness Unto Death is Despair

I. That Despair is the Sickness Unto Death

A. Despair is a Sickness of the Spirit, of the Self, and So Can Have Three Forms: in Despair Not to Be Conscious of Having a Self (Not Despair in the Strict Sense); in Despair Not to Will to Be Oneself; in Despair to Will to Be Oneself.

Man is spirit. But what is spirit? Spirit is the self. But what is the self? The self is a relation which relates itself to its own self, or it is that in the relation [which accounts for it] that the relation relates itself to its own self; the self is not the relation but [consists in the fact] that the relation relates itself to its own self. Man is a synthesis of the infinite and the finite, of the temporal and the eternal, of freedom and necessity, in short it is a synthesis. A synthesis is a relation between two factors. So regarded, man is not yet a self.

In the relation between two, the relation is the third term as a negative unity, and the two relate themselves to the relation, and in the relation to the relation; such a relation is that between soul and body, when man is regarded as soul. But if the relation relates itself to its own self, the relation is then the positive third term, and this is the self.

Such a relation which relates itself to its own self (that is to say, a self) must either have established itself or have been established by another.

If the relation which relates itself to its own self has been established by another, then the relation is indeed the third term, but this relation (the third term) is in turn a relation relating itself to that which established the whole relation.

Such a derived, established relation is the human self, a relation which relates itself to its own self, and in relating itself to its own self relates itself to another. Hence it is that there can be two forms of despair in the strict sense, so far as the self is concerned: either in despair not to will to be oneself, or in despair to will to be oneself. But if the human self had established itself, then there could be only one form: not to will to be oneself, to will to do away with oneself, but there could not be the form: in despair to will to be oneself.

The Possibility of the Offense

The offense lies in the fact that the infinite God and the finite man are separated by an infinite qualitative difference. This difference is the stumbling block. When Christianity declares that God became man, the understanding is scandalized. It cannot comprehend how the eternal can become temporal, how the infinite can be enclosed in the finite.

But precisely here is the test of faith. Faith is the happy passion that overcomes the offense. The believer looks at the paradox and says, "I believe, not because I understand, but because it is absurd." The understanding must be crucified, for the relation to God is not an intellectual relation but an existential one.

Despair is the sickness unto death because it is the state of being spiritually dead while physically alive. It is the inability to die, the torment of not being able to consume oneself. To be cured of this sickness is the Christian's task, but the cure is painful, for it requires dying to the world and to the self in order to live in God.
