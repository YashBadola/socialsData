What I really need is to get clear about what I must do, not what I must know, except insofar as knowledge must precede every act. What matters is to find a purpose, to see what it really is that God wills that I shall do; the crucial thing is to find a truth which is truth for me, to find the idea for which I am willing to live and die.

The crowd is untruth. There is therefore no one who has more contempt for what it is known as the "public", the "public opinion", the "common sense", than I.

If anyone on the verge of action should judge himself according to the outcome, he would never begin.

People understand me so poorly that they don't even understand my complaint about them not understanding me.

Life can only be understood backwards; but it must be lived forwards.

The greatest hazard of all, losing one’s self, can occur very quietly in the world, as if it were nothing at all. No other loss can occur so quietly; any other loss - an arm, a leg, five dollars, a wife, etc. - is sure to be noticed.

Anxiety is the dizziness of freedom.

There are two ways to be fooled. One is to believe what isn't true; the other is to refuse to believe what is true.

I see it all perfectly; there are two possible situations — one can either do this or that. My honest opinion and my friendly advice is this: do it or do not do it — you will regret both.

If I were to wish for anything, I should not wish for wealth and power, but for the passionate sense of the potential, for the eye which, ever young and ardent, sees the possible. Pleasure disappoints, possibility never. And what wine is so sparkling, what so fragrant, what so intoxicating, as possibility!

To dare is to lose one's footing momentarily. Not to dare is to lose oneself.

Faith is precisely this paradox, that the single individual as the single individual is higher than the universal, is justified before it, not as inferior to it but as superior - yet in such a way, please note, that it is the single individual who, after having been subordinate as the single individual to the universal, now by means of the universal becomes the single individual who as the single individual is superior, that the single individual as the single individual stands in an absolute relation to the absolute.

It is so hard to believe because it is so hard to obey.

The self is a relation that relates itself to itself or is the relation's relating itself to itself in the relation; the self is not the relation but that the relation relates itself to itself.

To have faith is to lose your mind and to win God.
