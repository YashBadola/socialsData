{"text": "FEAR AND TREMBLING\nINTRODUCTION\nNot only in the world of commerce but also in the world of ideas\nour age has arranged a regular clearance-sale. Everything may be had at\nsuch absurdedly low prices that very soon the question will arise\nwhether any one cares to bid. Every waiter with a speculative turn who\ncarefully marks the significant progress of modern philosophy, every\nlecturer in philosophy, every tutor, student, every sticker-and\u2011quitter\nof philosophy\u2014they are not content with doubting everything, but \"go\nright on.\" It might, possibly, be ill\u2011timed and inopportune to ask them\nwhither they are bound; but it is no doubt polite and modest to take it\nfor granted that they have doubted everything\u2014else it were a curious\nstatement for them to make, that they were proceeding onward. So they\nhave, all of them, completed that preliminary operation and, it would\nseem, with such ease that they do not think it necessary to waste a\nword about how they did it. The fact is, not even he who looked\nanxiously and with a troubled spirit for some little point of\ninformation, ever found one, nor any instruction, nor even any little\ndietetic prescription, as to how one is to accomplish this enormous\ntask. \"But did not Descartes proceed in this fashion?\" Descartes,\nindeed! that venerable, humble, honest thinker whose writings surely no\none can read without deep emotion\u2014Descartes did what he said, and said\nwhat he did. Alas, alas! that is a mighty rare thing in our times! But\nDescartes, as he says frequently enough, never uttered doubts\nconcerning his faith. . . .\nIn our times, as was remarked, no one is content with faith, but\n\"goes right on.\" The question as to whither they are proceeding may be\na silly question; whereas it is, a sign of urbanity and culture to\nassume that every one has faith, to begin with, for else it were a\ncurious statement for them to make, that they are proceeding further.\nIn the olden days it was different. Then, faith was a task for a whole\nlife\u2011time because it was held that proficiercy in faith was not to be\nwon within a few days or weeks. Hence, when the tried patriarch felt\nhis end approaching, after having fought his battles and preserved his\nfaith, he was still young enough at heart not to have forgotten the\nfear and trembling which disciplined his youth and which  the mature\nman has under control, but which no one entirely outgrows\u2014except\ninsofar as he succeeds in \"going on\" as early as possible. The goal\nwhich those venerable men reached at last\u2014at that spot every one\nstarts, in our times, in order to \"proceed further.\". . .\nPREPARATION\nThere lived a man who, when a child, had heard the beautiful Bible\nstory of how God tempted Abraham and how he stood the test, how he\nmaintained his faith and, against his expectations, received his son\nback again. As this man grew older he read this same story with ever\ngreater admiration; for now life had separated what had been united in\nthe reverent simplicity of the child. And the older he grew, the more\nfrequently his thoughts reverted to that story. His enthusiasm waxed\nstronger and stronger, and yet the story grew less and less clear to\nhim. Finally he forgot everything else in thinking about it, and his\nsoul contained but one wish, which was, to behold Abraham; and but one\nlonging, which was, to have been witness to that event. His desire was,\nnot to see the beautiful lands of the Orient, and not the splendor of\nthe Promised Land, and not the reverent couple whose old age the Lord\nhad blessed with children, and not the venerable figure of the aged\npatriarch, and not the god\u2011given vigorous youth of Isaac\u2014it would have\nbeen the same to him if the event had come to pass on some barren\nheath. But his wish was, to have been with Abraham on the three days'\njourney, when he rode with sorrow before him and with Isaac at his\nside. His wish was, to have been present at the moment when Abraham\nlifted up his eyes and saw Mount Moriah afar off; to have been present\nat the moment when he left his asses behind and wended his way up to\nthe mountain alone with Isaac. For the mind of this man was busy, not\nwith the delicate conceits of the imagination, but rather with his\nshuddering thought.\nThe man we speak of was no thinker, he felt no desire to go beyond his\nfaith: it seemed to him the most glorious fate to be remembered as the\nFather of Faith, and a most enviable lot to be possessed of that faith,\neven if no one knew it.\nThe man we speak of was no learned exegetist, be did not even\nunderstand Hebrew\u2014who knows but a knowledge of Hebrew might have helped\nhim to understand readily both the story and Abraham.\nI.\nAnd God tempted Abraham and said unto him: take Isaac, thine only son,\nwhom thou lovest and go to the land Moriah and sacrifice him there on a\nmountain which I shall show thee.\nIt was in the early morning, Abraham arose betimes and had his asses\nsaddled. He departed from his tent, and Isaac with him; but Sarah\nlooked out of the window after them until they were out of sight.\nSilently they rode for three days; but on the fourth morning Abraham\nsaid not a word but lifted up his eyes and beheld Mount Moriah in the\ndistance. He left his servants behind and, leading Isaac by the hand,\nhe approached the mountain. But Abraham said to himself: \"I shall\nsurely conceal from Isaac whither he is going.\" He stood still, he laid\nhis hand on Isaac's head to bless him, and Isaac bowed down to receive\nhis blessing. And Abraham's aspect was fatherly, his glance was mild,\nhis speech admonishing. But Isaac understood him not, his soul would\nnot rise to him; he embraced Abraham's knees, he besought him at his\nfeet, he begged for his young life, for his beautiful hopes, he\nrecalled the joy in Abraham's house when he was born, he reminded him\nof the sorrow and the loneliness that would be after him. Then did\nAbraham raise up the youth and lead him by his hand, and his words were\nfull of consolation and admonishment. But Isaac understood him not. He\nascended Mount Moriah, but Isaac understood him not. Then Abraham\naverted his face for a moment; but when Isaac looked again, his\nfather's countenance was changed, his glance wild, his aspect terrible,\nhe seized Isaac and threw him to the ground and said: \"Thou foolish\nlad, believest thou I am thy father? An idol\u2011worshipper am I. Believest\nthou it is God's cornmand? Nay, but my pleasure.\" Then Isaac trembled\nand cried out in his fear: \"God in heaven, have pity on me, God of\nAbraham, show mercy to me, I have no father on earth, be thou then my\nfather!\" But Abraham said softly to himself : \"Father in heaven, I\nthank thee. Better is it that he believes me inhuman than that he\nshould lose his faith in thee.\"\nWhen the child is to be weaned, his mother blackens her breast; for it\nwere a pity if her breast should look sweet to him when he is not to\nhave it. Then the child believes that her breast has changed; but his\nmother is ever the same, her glance is full of love and as tender as\never. Happy he who needed not worse means to wean his child!\nII.\nIt was in the early morning. Abraham arose betimes and embraced\nSarah, the bride of his old age. And Sarah kissed Isaac who had taken\nthe shame from her\u2014Isaac, her pride, her hope for all coming\ngenerations. Then the twain rode silently along their way, and\nAbraham's glance was fastened on the ground before him; until on the\nfourth day, when he lifted up his eyes and beheld Mount Moriah in the\ndistance; but then his eyes again sought the ground. Without a word he\nput the fagots in order and bound Isaac, and without a word he\nunsheathed his knife. Then he beheld the ram God had chosen, and\nsacrificed him, and wended his way home. . . . From that day on Abraham\ngrew old. He could not forget that God had required this of him. Isaac\nflourished as before; but Abraham's eye was darkened, he saw happiness\nno more.\nWhen the child has grown and is to be weaned, his mother will in\nmaidenly fashion conceal her breast. Then the child has a mother no\nlonger. Happy the child who lost not his mother in any other sense!\nIII.\nIt was in the early morning. Abraham arose betimes he kissed Sarah, the\nyoung mother, and Sarah kissed Isaac, her joy, her delight for all\ntimes. And Abraham rode on his way, lost in thought\u2014he was thinking of\nHagar and her son whom he had driven out into the wilderness. He\nascended Mount Moriah and he drew the knife.\nIt was a calm evening when Abraham rode out alone, and he rode to Mount\nMoriah. There he cast himself down on his face and prayed to God to\nforgive him his sin in that he had been about to sacrifice his son\nIsaac, and in that the father had forgotten his duty toward his son.\nAnd yet oftener he rode on his lonely way, but he found no rest. He\ncould not grasp that it was a sin that he had wanted to sacrifice to\nGod his most precious possession, him for whom he would most gladly\nhave died many times. But, if it was a sin, if he had not loved Isaac\nthus, then could he not grasp the possbility that he could be forgiven\n: for what sin more terrible ?\nWhen the child is to he weaned, the mother is not without sorrow that\nshe and her child are to be separated more and more, that the child who\nhad first lain under her heart, and afterwards at any rate rested at\nher breast, is to be so near to her no more. So they sorrow together\nfor that brief while. Happy he who kept his child so near to him and\nneeded not to sorrow more!\nIV.\nIt was in the early morning. All was ready for the journey in the house\nof Abraham. He bade farewell to Sarah; and Eliezer, his faithful\nservant, accompanied him along the way for a little while. They rode\ntogether in peace, Abraham and Isaac, until they came to Mount Moriah.\nAnd Abraham prepared everything for the sacrifice, calmly and mildly;\nbut when his father turned aside in order to unsheath his knife, Isaac\nsaw that Abraham's left hand was knit in despair and that a trembling\nshook his frame\u2014but Abraham drew forth the knife.\nThen they returned home again, and Sarah hastened to meet them; but\nIsaac had lost his faith, No one in all the world ever said a word\nabout this, nor did Isaac speak to any man concerning what he had seen,\nand Abraham suspected not that any one had seen it.\nWhen the child is to be weaned, his mother has the stronger food\nready lest the child perish. Happy he who has in readiness this\nstronger food!\nThus, and in many similar ways, thought the man whom I have mentioned\nabout this event. And every time he returned, after a pilgrimage to\nMount Moriah, he sank down in weariness, folding his hands and saying:\n\"No one, in truth, was great as was Abraham, and who can understand\nhim?\"\nA PANEGYRIC ON ABRAHAM\nIf a consciousness of the eternal were not implanted in man; if the\nbasis of all that exists were but a confusedly fermenting element\nwhich, convulsed by obscure passions, Produced all, both the great and\nthe insignificant; if under everything there lay a bottomless void\nnever to be filled what else were life but despair? If it were thus,\nand if there were no sacred bonds between man and man; if one\ngeneration arose after another, as in the forest the leaves of one\nseason succeed the leaves of another, or like the songs of birds which\nare taken up one after another; if the generations of man passed\nthrough the world like a ship passing through the sea and the wind over\nthe desert\u2014a fruitless and a vain thing; if eternal oblivion were ever\ngreedily watching for its prey and there existed no power strong enough\nto wrest it from its clutches\u2014how empty were life then, and how dismal!\nAnd therefore it is not thus; but, just as God created man and woman,\nhe likewise called into being the hero and the poet or orator. The\nlatter cannot perform the deeds of the hero\u2014he can only admire and love\nhim and rejoice in him. And yet he also is happy and not less so; for\nthe hero is, as it were, his better self with which he has fallen in\nlove, and he is glad he is not himself the hero, so that his love can\nexpress itself in admiration.\nThe poet is the genius of memory, and does nothing but recall what has\nbeen done, can do nothing but admire what has been done. He adds\nnothing of his own, but he is Jealous of what has been entrusted to\nhim. He obeys the choice of his own heart; but once he has found what\nhe has been seeking, he visits every man's door with his song and with\nhis speech, so that all may admire the hero as he does, and be proud of\nthe hero as he is. This is his achievement, his humble work, this is\nhis faithful service in the house of the hero. If thus, faithful to his\nlove, he battles day and night against the guile of oblivion which\nwishes to lure the hero from him, then has he accomplished his task,\nthen is he gathered to his hero who loves him as faithfully; for the\npoet is as it were the hero's better self, unsubstantial, to be sure,\nlike a mere memory, but also transfigured as is a memory. Therefore\nshall no one be forgotten who has done great deeds; and even if there\nbe delay, even if the cloud of misunderstanding obscure the hero from\nour vision, still his lover will come some time; and the more time has\npassed, the more faithfully will he cleave to him.\nNo, no one shall be forgotten who was great in this world. But each\nhero was great in his own way, and each one was eminent in proportion\nto the great things he loved. For he who loved himself became great\nthrough himself, and he who loved others became great through his\ndevotion, but he who loved God became greater than all of these.\nEveryone of them shall be remembered, but each one became great in\nproportion to his trust. One became great by the possible; another, by\nhoping for the eternal; hoped for the impossible, he became greater\nthan all of these. Every one shall be remembered; but each one was\ngreat in proportion to the power with which he strove. For he who\nstrove with the world became great by overcoming himself; but he who\nstrove with God, he became the greatest of them all. Thus there have\nbeen struggles in the world, man against man, one against a thousand;\nbut he who struggled with God, he became greatest of them all. Thus\nthere was fighting on this earth, and there was he who conquered\neverything by his strength, and there was he who conquered God by his\nweakness. There was he who, trusting in himself, gained all; and there\nwas he who, trusting in his strength sacrificed everything; but he who\nbelieved in God was greater than all of these. There was he who was\ngreat through his strength, and he who was great through his wisdom,\nand he who was great through his hopes, and he who was great through\nhis love; but Abraham was greater than all of these\u2014great through the\nstrength whose power is weakness, great through the wisdom whose secret\nis folly, great through the hope whose expression is madness, great\nthrough the love which is hatred of one's self.\nThrough the urging of his faith Abraham left the land of his\nforefathers and became a stranger in the land of promise. He left one\nthing behind and took one thing along: he left his worldly wisdom\nbehind and took with him faith. For else he would not have left the\nland of his fathers. but would have thought it an unreasonable demand.\nThrough his faith he came to be a stranger in the land of promise,\nwhere there was nothing to remind him of all that had been dear to him,\nbut where everything by its newness tempted his soul to longing. And\nyet was he God's chosen, he in whom the Lord was well pleased! Indeed,\nhad he been one cast off, one thrust out of God's mercy, then might he\nhave comprehended it; but now it seemed like a mockery of him and of\nhis faith. There have been others who lived in exile from the\nfatherland which they loved. They are not forgotten, nor is the song of\nlament forgotten in which they mournfully sought and found what they\nhad lost. Of Abraham there exists no song of lamentation. It is human\nto complain, it is human to weep with the weeping; but it is greater to\nbelieve, and more blessed to consider him who has faith.\nThrough his faith Abraham received the promise that in his seed were to\nbe blessed all races of mankind. Time passed, there was still the\npossibility of it, and Abraharn had faith. Another man there was who\nalso lived in hopes. Time passed, the evening of his life was\napproaching; neither was he paltry enough to have forgotten his hopes:\nneither shall he be forgotten by us! Then he sorrowed, and his sorrow\ndid not deceive him, as life had done, but gave him all it could; for\nin the sweetness of sorrow he became possessed of his disappointed\nhopes. It is human to sorrow, it is human to sorrow with the sorrowing;\nbut it is greater to have faith, and more blessed to consider him who\nhas faith.\nNo song of lamentation has come down to us from Abraham. He did\nnot sadly count the days as time passed; he did not look at Sarah with\nsuspicious eyes, whether she was becoming old; he did not stop the\nsun's course lest Sarah should grow old and his hope with her; he did\nnot lull her with his songs of lamentation. Abraham grew old, and Sarah\nbecame a laughing\u2011stock to the people; and yet was he God's chosen, and\nheir to the promise that in his seed were to be blessed all races of\nmankind. Were it, then, not better if he had not been God's chosen? For\nwhat is it to be God's chosen? Is it to have denied to one in one's\nyouth all the wishes of youth in order to have them fulfilled after\ngreat labor in old age?\nBut Abraham had faith and steadfastly lived in hope. Had Abraham been\nless firm in his trust, then would he have given up that hope. He would\nhave said to God: \"So it is, perchance, not Thy will, after all, that\nthis shall come to pass. I shall surrender my hope. It was my only one,\nit was my bliss. I am sincere, I conceal no secret grudge for that Thou\ndidst deny it to me.\" He would not have remained forgotten, his example\nwould have saved many a one; but he would not have become the Father of\nFaith. For it is great to surrender one's hope, but greater still to\nabide by it steadfastly after having surrendered it; for it is great to\nseize hold of the eternal hope, but greater till to abide steadfastly\nby one's worldly hopes after having rendered them.\nThen came the fulness of time. If Abraham had not had faith, then\nSarah would probably have died of sorrow, and Abraham, dulled by his\ngrief, would not have understood the fulfilment, but would have smiled\nabout it as a dream of his youth.  But Abraham had faith, and therefore\nhe remained young; for he who always hopes for the best, him life will\ndeceive, and he will grow old; and he who is always prepared for the\nworst, he will soon age; but he who has faith, he will preserve eternal\nyouth. Praise, therefore, be to this story! For Sarah, though advanced\nin age, was young enough to wish for the pleasures of a mother, and\nAbraham, though grey of hair, was young enough to wish to become a\nfather. In a superficial sense it may be considered miraculous that\nwhat they wished for came to pass, but in a deeper sense the miracle of\nfaith is to be seen in Abraham's and Sarah's being young enough to\nwish, and their faith having preserved their wish and therewith their\nyouth. The promise he had received was fulfilled, and he accepted it in\nfaith, and it came to pass according to the promise and his faith;\nwhereas Moses smote the rock with his staff but believed not.\nThere was joy in Abraham's house when Sarah celebrated the day of her\nGolden Wedding. But it was not to remain thus; for once more was\nAbraham to be tempted. He had struggled with that cunning power to\nwhich nothing is impossible, with that ever watchful enemy who never\nsleeps, with that old man who outlives all\u2014he had struggled with Time\nand had preserved his faith. And now all the terror of that fight was\nconcentrated in one moment. \"And God tempted Abraham, saying to him:\ntake now thine only son Isaac, whom thou lovest, and get thee into the\nland of Moriah; and offer him there for a burnt offering upon one of\nthe mountains which I will tell thee of.\nAll was lost, then, and more terribly than if a son had never been\ngiven him! The Lord had only mocked Abraham, then! Miraculously he had\nrealized the unreasonable hopes of Abraham; and now he wished to take\naway what be had given. A foolish hope it had been, but Abraham had not\nlaughed when the promise had been made him. Now all was lost\u2014the\ntrusting hope of seventy years, the brief joy at the fulfilment of his\nhopes. Who, then, is he that snatches away the old man's staff, who\nthat demands that he himself shall break it in two? Who is he that\nrenders disconsolate the grey hair of old age, who is he that demands\nthat he himself shall do it? Is there no pity for the venerable old\nman, and none for the innocent child? And yet was Abraham God's chosen\none, and yet was it the Lord that tempted him. And now all was to be\nlost I The glorious remembrance of him by a whole race, the promise of\nAbraham's seed\u2011all that was but a whim, a passing fancy of the Lord,\nwhich Abraham was now to destroy forever! That glorious treasure, as\nold as the faith in Abraham's heart, and many, many years older than\nIsaac, the fruit of Abraham's life, sanctified by prayers, matured in\nstruggles\u2014the blessing on the lips of Abraham: this fruit was now to be\nplucked before the appointed time, and to remain without significance;\nfor of what significance were it if Isaac was to be sacrificed? That\nsad and yet blessed hour when Abraham was to take leave f rom all that\nwas dear to him, the hour when he would once more lift up his venerable\nhead, when his face would shine like the countenance of the Lord, the\nhour when he would collect his whole soul for a blessing strong enough\nto render Isaac blessed all the days, of his life\u2011that hour was not to\ncome! He was to say farewell to Isaac, to be sure, but in such wise\nthat he himself was to remain behind; death was to part them, but in\nsuch wise that Isaac was to die. The old man was not in happiness to\nlay his hand on Isaac's head when the hour of death came, but, tired of\nlife, to lay violent hands on Isaac. And it was God who tempted him.\nWoe, woe to the messenger who would have come before Abraham with such\na command! Who would have dared to be the messenger of such dread\ntidings? But it was God that tempted Abraham.\nBut Abraham had faith, and had faith for this life. Indeed, had his\nfaith been but concerning the life to come, then might he more easily\nhave cast away all, in order to hasten out of this world which was not\nhis. . . .\nBut Abraham had faith and doubted not, but trusted that the improbable\nwould come to pass. If Abraham had doubted, when standing on Mount\nMoriah; if he had looked about him in perplexity; if he had accidentally\ndiscovered the ram before drawing his knife; if God had permitted him to\nsacrifice it instead of Isaac\u2014then would he have returned home, and all\nwould have been as before, he would have had Sarah and would have kept\nIsaac; and yet how different all would have been! For then had his return\nbeen a flight, his salvation an accident, his reward disgrace, his\nfuture, perchance, perdition.", "source": "fear_and_trembling.txt"}
