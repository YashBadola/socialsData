1. The Monad, of which we shall here speak, is nothing but a simple substance, which enters into composites; simple, that is to say, without parts.

2. And there must be simple substances, since there are composites; for a composite is nothing but a collection or aggregatum of simple things.

3. Now where there are no parts, there can be neither extension nor form nor divisibility. These Monads are the real atoms of nature and in a word, the elements of things.

4. No dissolution of these elements is to be feared, and there is no conceivable way in which a simple substance can be destroyed by natural means.

5. For the same reason there is no conceivable way in which a simple substance can come into existence by natural means, since it cannot be formed by the composition of parts.

6. Thus it may be said that a Monad can only come into existence or end at once; that is to say, it can come into existence only by creation and end only by annihilation, while that which is compound comes into existence or ends by parts.

7. There is also no way of explaining how a Monad can be altered in quality or internally changed by any other created thing; since it is impossible to change the place of anything in it or to conceive in it any internal motion which could be produced, directed, increased or diminished therein, although all this is possible in that which is compound, where there are parts which have some change. The Monads have no windows, through which anything could come in or go out. Accidents cannot separate themselves from substances nor go about outside of them, as the 'sensible species' of the Scholastics used to do. Thus neither substance nor accident can enter a Monad from without.

8. Yet the Monad must have some qualities, otherwise it would be not even a being. And if simple substances did not differ for us in their qualities, there would be no means of perceiving any change in things; for what is in the compound can come only from the simple elements it contains, and the Monads, if they had no qualities, would be indistinguishable from one another, since they do not differ in quantity. Consequently, space being a plenum, each place would always receive, in any motion, exactly the equivalent of what it already had, and no one state of things would be discernible from another.

9. Indeed, each Monad must be different from every other. For in nature there are never two beings which are perfectly alike and in which it is not possible to find an internal difference, or at least a difference founded upon an intrinsic quality.

10. I assume also as admitted that every created being, and consequently the created Monad, is subject to change, and further that this change is continuous in each.

11. It follows from what has just been said, that the natural changes of the Monads come from an internal principle, since an external cause can have no influence upon their inner being.

12. But, besides the principle of the change, there must be a diverse that changes, so that may produce the specific variety of the simple substances.

13. This particular must be contained in the simple substance; and there must be a variety of affections to correspond to the variety of the thing.

14. The passing condition, which involves and represents a multitude in the unit or in the simple substance, is nothing but what is called Perception, which is to be distinguished from Apperception or Consciousness, as will appear in the following. In this matter the Cartesian view is extremely defective, for it treats as non-existent those perceptions of which we are not consciously aware. This has also led them to believe that minds alone are Monads, and that there are no souls of animals nor other Entelechies.

15. The action of the internal principle which brings about the change or the passage from one perception to another, may be called Appetition; it is true that desire cannot always fully attain to the whole perception at which it aims, but it always obtains some of it and reaches new perceptions.
