All men by nature desire to know. An indication of this is the delight we take in our senses; for even apart from their usefulness they are loved for themselves; and above all others the sense of sight. For not only with a view to action, but even when we are not going to do anything, we prefer seeing (one might say) to everything else. The reason is that this, most of all the senses, makes us know and brings to light many differences between things.

There is a science which investigates being as being and the attributes which belong to this in virtue of its own nature. Now this is not the same as any of the so-called special sciences; for none of these others treats universally of being as being. They cut off a part of being and investigate the attribute of this part; this is what the mathematical sciences for instance do. Now since we are seeking the first principles and the highest causes, clearly there must be some thing to which these belong in virtue of its own nature.

The term 'being' is used in various senses, but with reference to one central idea and one definite nature, and not as having merely the same name. A person is said to be healthy in one sense, a thing in another, but all with reference to health; or again, a medical operation is called medical in one sense, a scalpel in another, but all with reference to the same art. So, too, 'being' is used in many senses, but all with reference to one principle.

And since we are seeking the causes and the principles of the things that are, clearly it is the substance of things that we must investigate. For if the universe is a whole, substance is its first part; and if it coheres merely by virtue of serial succession, on this view also substance is first, and is succeeded by quality, and then by quantity.

We must say, then, what potentiality and actuality are. We have pointed out that 'being' is used in many senses, one being 'what a thing is', another quality or quantity or any other of the categories, and again potentiality and actuality.
