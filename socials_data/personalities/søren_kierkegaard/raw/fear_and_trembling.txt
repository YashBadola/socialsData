The ethical expression for what Abraham did is that he would murder Isaac; the religious expression is that he would sacrifice Isaac; but in this contradiction lies the very anguish that can indeed make a sleeplessness wary; and yet without that anguish Abraham is not who he is.

Faith is precisely this paradox, that the single individual is higher than the universal, yet in such a way, be it observed, that the movement repeats itself, and that consequently the single individual, after having been in the universal, now as the single individual isolates himself as higher than the universal. If this be not faith, then Abraham is lost, then faith has never existed in the world... because it has always existed.

Infinite resignation is the last stage prior to faith, so that one who has not made this movement has not faith; for only in infinite resignation do I become clear to myself with respect to my eternal validity, and only then can there be question of grasping existence by virtue of faith.

The knight of faith is obliged to rely upon himself alone, he feels the pain of not being able to make himself intelligible to others, but he feels no vain desire to guide others. The pain is his assurance that he is in the right way, the vain desire he does not know, he is too serious for that.

If I cannot speak, then I cannot make the movement of faith. If I do not speak, I am an individual, higher than the universal.
