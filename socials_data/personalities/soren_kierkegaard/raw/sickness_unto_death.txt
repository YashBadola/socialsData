The Sickness Unto Death
A Christian Psychological Exposition for Upbuilding and Awakening

Preface
To many the form of this "exposition" will seem strange; it will seem to them too strict to be edifying, and too edifying to be strictly scientific. As to this latter objection I have no opinion. As to the former, however, I do not believe that it is correct. From the Christian point of view, everything, absolutely everything should serve for edification. The sort of learning which is not in the end edifying is precisely for that reason unchristian. Everything Christian is ipso facto edifying.

Part First: The Sickness Unto Death is Despair
I. That Despair is the Sickness Unto Death

A. Despair is a Sickness in the Spirit, in the Self, and so it may have three forms: in Despair at not being conscious of having a Self (Despair improperly so called); in Despair at not willing to be oneself; in Despair at willing to be oneself.

Man is spirit. But what is spirit? Spirit is the self. But what is the self? The self is a relation which relates itself to its own self, or it is that in the relation [which accounts for it] that the relation relates itself to its own self; the self is not the relation but [consists in the fact] that the relation relates itself to its own self. Man is a synthesis of the infinite and the finite, of the temporal and the eternal, of freedom and necessity, in short it is a synthesis. A synthesis is a relation between two factors. So regarded, man is not yet a self.

In the relation between two, the relation is the third term as a negative unity, and the two relate themselves to the relation, and in the relation to the relation; such a relation is that between soul and body, when man is regarded as soul. But if the relation relates itself to its own self, the relation is then the positive third term, and this is the self.

Such a relation which relates itself to its own self (that is to say, a self) must either have constituted itself or have been constituted by another. If this relation which relates itself to its own self is constituted by another, the relation doubtless is the third term, but this relation (the third term) is in turn a relation relating itself to that which constituted the whole relation. Such a derived, constituted, relation is the human self, a relation which relates itself to its own self, and in relating itself to its own self relates itself to another. Hence it is that there can be two forms of despair properly so called. If the human self had constituted itself, there could be a question only of one form: not to will to be one’s own self, to will to get rid of oneself, but there could be no question of despair at willing to be oneself.

This form of despair (willing to be oneself) is the formula for all despair, so that the second form of despair (in despair at not willing to be oneself) can be followed back to the first (in despair at willing to be oneself), just as in the foregoing we resolved the first into the second (in despair at willing to be oneself into despair at not willing to be oneself). A despairing man wants despairingly to be himself. But if he despairingly wants to be himself, he will not want to get rid of himself. Yes, so it seems; but if one inspects more closely, one perceives that after all the contradiction is the same. That self which he despairingly wills to be is a self which he is not (for to will to be that self which one truly is, is indeed the opposite of despair); what he really wills is to tear his self away from the Power which constituted it. But notwithstanding all his despair, this he is unable to do, notwithstanding all the efforts of despair, that Power is the stronger, and it compels him to be the self he does not will to be. But for all that he wills to be rid of himself, to be rid of the self which he is, in order to be the self he himself has stumbled upon.

B. The Possibility and the Actuality of Despair
Is despair an advantage or a drawback? Regarded in a purely dialectical way it is both. If one were to stick to the abstract idea of a just man, one might say that it is an advantage. To be able to despair is an infinite advantage of the possibility; to be despairing is not only the greatest misfortune and misery—no, it is perdition.

The formula that describes the state of the self when despair is completely rooted out is this: in relating itself to itself and in willing to be itself, the self rests transparently in the power that established it.
