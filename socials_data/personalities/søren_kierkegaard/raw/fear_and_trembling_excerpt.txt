Preface

Not only in the world of commerce but also in the world of ideas our age is putting on a veritable clearance sale. Everything can be had so dirt cheap that one begins to wonder whether in the end anyone will want to make a bid. Every speculative price-fixer who conscientiously directs attention to the significant march of modern philosophy, every Privatdocent, tutor, and student, every crofter and cottager in philosophy, is not content with stopping at doubting everything but goes further. It might, therefore, be considered mistimed and behind the times to ask where they are going, but surely it is courteous and altogether proper to assume that they have doubted everything, since otherwise it would be queer to say that they were going further. This preliminary movement they have therefore all of them made, and presumably with such ease that they do not think it necessary to waste a word about the how; for not even he who anxiously and with deep concern sought a little enlightenment in the renowned Descartes found it, since Descartes did not shout it at one and all but only explained that he did it, so that—mirabile dictu!—this solitary man has become the only one who has not done it, has not doubted everything.

But the present generation does not stop with doubt, it goes further. It must be confessed that this surely is a goodly speed. One might say that it is too fast. But it is always the case that when one is going further one must not stop. If one stops, one does not go further. It is indeed true that in order to stop one must have gone further than the point where one stops, but this does not mean that one has gone further than the stopping place.

Faith is precisely this paradox, that the single individual as the particular is higher than the universal, is justified vis-à-vis it, is not subordinate but superior—yet in such a way, be it observed, that it is the single individual who, after having been subordinate as the particular to the universal, now through the universal becomes the individual who as the particular is superior to the universal, for the fact that the individual as the particular stands in an absolute relation to the absolute. This position cannot be mediated, for all mediation comes about precisely by virtue of the universal; it is and remains to all eternity a paradox, inaccessible to thought. And yet faith is this paradox—or else (these are the logical consequences which I would beg the reader to have in mente at every point, though it would be too prolix for me to reiterate them on every occasion)—or else there is no faith at all, but Abraham is lost, or else one must explain the story of Abraham in another way, or else one must turn back to the universal.

Infinite resignation is the last stage prior to faith, so that one who has not made this movement has not faith; for only in infinite resignation do I become clear to myself with respect to my eternal validity, and only then can there be any question of grasping existence by virtue of faith.

The knight of faith is obliged to rely upon himself alone, he feels the pain of not being able to make himself intelligible to others, but he feels no vain desire to guide others. The pain is his assurance that he is in the right way, for he who has no need of this assurance is not a knight of faith.
