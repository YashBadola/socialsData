Either/Or
A Fragment of Life

Diapsalmata

I have just returned from a party of which I was the life and soul; wit poured from my lips, everyone laughed and admired me—but I went away—and the dash should be as long as the earth's orbit—

and wanted to shoot myself.

What is a poet? An unhappy man who in his heart harbors a deep anguish, but whose lips are so fashioned that the sighs and cries which pass over them are transformed into ravishing music. His fate is like that of the unfortunate victims whom the tyrant Phalaris imprisoned in a brazen bull, and slowly tortured over a slow fire; their cries could not reach the tyrant’s ears so as to strike terror into his heart; when they reached him they sounded like sweet music. And men crowd about the poet and say to him, “Sing for us soon again”—that is as much as to say, “May new sufferings torment your soul, but may your lips be fashioned as before; for the cries would only distress us, but the music is delicious.”

The Rotation Method

People are always saying that the problem is to be bored. This is quite true, if one only understands it correctly. Boredom is the root of all evil. It is very curious that boredom, which itself has such a calm and sedate nature, can have such a capacity to initiate motion. The effect of boredom is usually strongest when it ceases to be a strictly negative condition and becomes positive.

To avoid boredom, one must have a method. My method is the rotation method. It does not consist in changing one’s soil, for the soil is always the same, but in changing the method of cultivation and the crops. One must learn to forget. The art of remembering and the art of forgetting are the two most important arts in life.

If you want to be able to forget, you must never become completely absorbed in anything. If you do, you are lost, for you have lost your freedom. You become a slave to the memory. You must always keep a way out open. You must be able to break off at any moment. This applies to friendship, to love, to business, to everything.

Friendship is dangerous. It binds you. It makes you dependent. You must never have a friend. You may have acquaintances, as many as you like, but no friends.

Marriage is even more dangerous. It is the most binding of all ties. It is a trap. Once you are married, you are finished. You have lost your freedom, your independence, your soul. You have become a member of society, a cog in the machine.

The Esthetic Validity of Marriage

But now I ask you, my young friend, is there not something beautiful in marriage? Is it not a noble task to unite the temporal and the eternal, the finite and the infinite, in a holy bond? You smile. You think I am talking like a parson. But I am not. I am talking like a man who has seen life and who knows that the esthetic is not the only validity in life, nor the highest.

There is an ethical validity, and it is higher than the esthetic. The ethical does not destroy the esthetic, but it dethrones it. It makes it serve a higher purpose. In marriage, the esthetic is preserved, but it is transfigured. It becomes duty. And duty is the only thing that can give life meaning and stability.

Choose then, my friend. Choose yourself. Choose despair, if you must, but choose. For in choosing, you become a self. You become a human being.
