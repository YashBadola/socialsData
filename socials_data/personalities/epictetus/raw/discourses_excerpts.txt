Of the things which are in our power, and not in our power.

In general, you will find no art or faculty that can examine itself; and therefore none that can approve or disapprove of itself. The art of grammar, for instance, possesses the faculty of judging of speech; but has it the faculty of judging of itself? By no means.

What is it then that pronounces upon this? The Rational Faculty; for this is the only one we have received which examines itself, what it is, and what power it has, and of all other faculties, what they are.

"But I will put you in prison."
"Man, what are you saying? You may put my body in prison, but my mind not even Zeus himself can conquer."

I must die. But must I die groaning? I must be imprisoned. But must I be whining as well? I must suffer exile. Can any one then hinder me from going with a smile, and a good courage, and at peace?
"Tell the secret."
"I refuse to tell, for this is in my power."
"But I will chain you."
"What are you saying, man? Chain me? You may fetter my leg, but my will not even Zeus himself can overpower."
"I will throw you into prison."
"My poor body, you mean."
"I will cut off your head."
"When, then, have I told you that my head alone cannot be cut off?"
These are the things which philosophers should meditate on, which they should write daily, in which they should exercise themselves.

From the Discourses, Book II, Chapter 14.
To Naso.

When a guide meets a man who has lost his way, he does not drive him away with mockery, but leads him to the right path. You also should show the unlearned man the truth, and you will see that he follows. But so long as you do not show him the warning, you should not mock him, but feel your own incapacity.
