We have yet to write the history of that other form of madness, by which men, in an act of sovereign reason, confine their neighbors, and communicate and recognize each other through the merciless language of non-madness; to define the moment of this conspiracy before it was permanently established in the realm of truth, before it had been revived by the lyricism of protest. We must try to return, in history, to that zero point in the course of madness at which madness is an undifferentiated experience, a not yet divided experience of division itself. We must describe, from the start of its trajectory, that "other form" which relegates Reason and Madness to one side or the other of its action as things henceforth external, deaf to all exchange, and as though dead to one another.

This is the region where madness reigns. But if the classical age is to be defined by the gesture of segregation, we must describe how, at the moment of its formulation, this gesture was linked to the social and economic horizon of confinement.

In the history of madness, two events indicate with a singular clarity the change that occurred at the beginning of the classical age: the creation of the Hôpital Général in 1656, and the "Great Confinement" of the poor, the unemployed, the corrected, and the insane. Suddenly, across Europe, great houses of confinement were created. The Hôpital Général was not a medical establishment. It was rather a sort of semi-judicial structure, an administrative entity which, along with the already existing powers, and outside of the courts, decided, judged, and executed.

It was an instance of order, of the monarchical and bourgeois order being organized in France during this period. It was directly linked to the royal power which placed it under the authority of the civil government alone. The Grand Confinement had a political and social aim: the suppression of beggary and idleness, sources of all disorders.
