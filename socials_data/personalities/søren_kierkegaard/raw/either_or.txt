DIAPSALMATA

What is a poet? An unhappy man who in his heart harbors a deep anguish, but whose lips are so fashioned that the sighs and cries which pass over them are transformed into ravishing music. His fate is like that of the unfortunate victims whom the tyrant Phalaris imprisoned in a brazen bull, and slowly tortured over a steady fire; their cries could not reach the tyrant's ears so as to strike terror into his heart; when they reached his ears they sounded like sweet music. And men crowd about the poet and say to him, "Sing for us soon again"—which is as much as to say, "May new sufferings torment your soul, but may your lips be fashioned as before; for the cries would only distress us, but the music is delicious." And the critics come forward and say, "That is perfectly done—just as it should be, according to the rules of aesthetics." Now it is understood that a critic resembles a poet to a hair; he only lacks the anguish in his heart and the music upon his lips. Lo, therefore I would rather be a swineherd, understood by the swine, than a poet misunderstood by men.

I don't feel like doing anything. I don't feel like riding—the motion is too violent; I don't feel like walking—it is too strenuous; I don't feel like lying down, for either I should have to remain lying, and I don't feel like doing that, or I should have to get up again, and I don't feel like doing that either. Summa Summarum: I don't feel like doing anything.

Let others complain that the age is wicked; my complaint is that it is paltry; for it lacks passion. Men’s thoughts are thin and flimsy like lace, they are themselves pitiable like the lacemakers. The thoughts of their hearts are too paltry to be sinful. For a worm it might be regarded as a sin to harbor such thoughts, but not for a being made in the image of God. Their lusts are dull and sluggish, their passions sleepy. They do their duty, these shopkeeper souls, but they clip the coin a little . . .

My soul is heavy; the paralysis of death is upon me; I am become a completely passive factor, a mere raw material. I no longer have any desire to do anything; I have no interests. My whole being is a contradiction. What I say is the opposite of what I feel; what I do is the opposite of what I desire. The result is that life has become a burden to me, and I am a burden to myself.

The Rotation Method

People with a good deal of experience in the world have often observed that the most tiresome people are those who are never bored. And the reason for this is that they are the very people who are the cause of boredom in others. It is only the active, the busy, the bustling people who are never bored. They are the ones who are always doing something, always on the go, always making a noise. They are the ones who are the most tiresome.

The method I propose does not consist in changing the soil but, like the proper rotation of crops, consists in changing the method of cultivation and the kinds of crops. Here we have at once the principle of limitation, the only saving principle in the world. The more you limit yourself, the more fertile you become in invention. A prisoner in solitary confinement for life becomes very inventive; a spider may furnish him with much entertainment. One need only remember the schoolboy who had no other plaything than a fly, or the prisoner who played with a spider.

The unhappy man is one who has his ideal, the content of his life, the fullness of his consciousness, the essence of his being, in some manner outside of himself. The unhappy man is always absent from himself, never present to himself. But one can be absent, obviously, either in the past or in the future. This adequately circumscribes the entire territory of the unhappy consciousness.
