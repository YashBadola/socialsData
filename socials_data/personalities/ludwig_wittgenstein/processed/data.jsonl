{"text": "1. \"Excalibur\" is a proper name in the ordinary sense. The sword Excalibur consists of parts combined in a particular way. If they are combined differently Excalibur does not exist. But it is clear that the sentence \"Excalibur has a sharp blade\" makes sense whether Excalibur is still whole or is broken up. But if \"Excalibur\" is the name of an object, this object no longer exists when Excalibur is broken in pieces; and as no object would then correspond to the name it would have no meaning. But then the sentence \"Excalibur has a sharp blade\" would contain a word that had no meaning, and hence the sentence would be nonsense. But it does make sense; so there must always be something corresponding to the words of which it consists. So the word \"Excalibur\" must disappear when the sense is analysed and its place be taken by words which name simples. It will be reasonable to call these simples the constituent parts of the complex.\n23. But how many kinds of sentence are there? Say assertion, question, and command?\u2014There are countless kinds: countless different kinds of use of what we call \"symbols\", \"words\", \"sentences\". And this multiplicity is not something fixed, given once for all; but new types of language, new language-games, as we may say, come into existence, and others become obsolete and get forgotten. (We can get a rough picture of this from the changes in mathematics.)\nHere the term \"language-game\" is meant to bring into prominence the fact that the speaking of language is part of an activity, or of a form of life.\nReview the multiplicity of language-games in the following examples, and in others:\nGiving orders, and obeying them\u2014\nDescribing the appearance of an object, or giving its measurements\u2014\nConstructing an object from a description (a drawing)\u2014\nReporting an event\u2014\nSpeculating about an event\u2014\nForming and testing a hypothesis\u2014\nPresenting the results of an experiment in tables and diagrams\u2014\nMaking up a story; and reading it\u2014\nPlay-acting\u2014\nSinging catches\u2014\nGuessing riddles\u2014\nMaking a joke; telling it\u2014\nSolving a problem in practical arithmetic\u2014\nTranslating from one language into another\u2014\nAsking, thanking, cursing, greeting, praying.", "source": "investigations_excerpts.txt"}

Logic treats of every possibility, and all possibilities are its facts.)\nJust as we cannot think of spatial objects at all apart from space, or temporal objects apart from time, so we can not think of any object apart from the possibility of its connection with other things.\nIf I can think of an object in the context of an atomic fact, I cannot think of it apart from the possibility of this context.\n...\n7 Whereof one cannot speak, thereof one must be silent.", "source": "tractatus_excerpts.txt"}
