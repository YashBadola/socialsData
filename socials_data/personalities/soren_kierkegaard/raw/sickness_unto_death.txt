The Sickness Unto Death is Despair

Man is spirit. But what is spirit? Spirit is the self. But what is the self? The self is a relation which relates itself to its own self, or it is that in the relation [which accounts for it] that the relation relates itself to its own self; the self is not the relation but [consists in the fact] that the relation relates itself to its own self. Man is a synthesis of the infinite and the finite, of the temporal and the eternal, of freedom and necessity, in short it is a synthesis. A synthesis is a relation between two factors. So regarded, man is not yet a self.

In the relation between two, the relation is the third term as a negative unity, and the two relate themselves to the relation, and in the relation to the relation; such a relation is that between soul and body, when man is regarded as soul. If on the contrary the relation relates itself to its own self, the relation is then the positive third term, and this is the self.

Possibility and Necessity

The self is composed of infinity and finiteness. But the synthesis is a relation, and it is a relation which, though it is derived, relates itself to itself, which means freedom. The self is freedom. But freedom is the dialectical element in the terms possibility and necessity.

Primarily this is the case because the self as synthesis of finite and infinite is originally constituted as a possibility, is then still a possibility, is not yet a reality. Real it is indeed (for it is a synthesis), but in another sense it is not real, or is only that reality which is the possibility of itself.

Despair is the Sickness Unto Death

The concept of the sickness unto death must be understood in a peculiar sense. Literally it means a sickness the end and outcome of which is death. Thus one speaks of a fatal illness as a sickness unto death. But in this sense despair cannot be called the sickness unto death. But in the Christian understanding death is itself a transition unto life. In this way there is from the Christian point of view no earthly bodily sickness unto death. For death is doubtless the last phase of the sickness, but death is not the last thing.
