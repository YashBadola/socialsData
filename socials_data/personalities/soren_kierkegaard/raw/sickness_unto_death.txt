The Sickness Unto Death
A Christian Psychological Exposition for Upbuilding and Awakening

Part First
The Sickness Unto Death is Despair

I. That Despair is the Sickness Unto Death

A. Despair is a Sickness in the Spirit, in the Self, and so it may have a Triple Form: in Despair at not being Conscious of having a Self (Despair Improperly so called); in Despair at not willing to be Oneself; in Despair at willing to be Oneself.

Man is spirit. But what is spirit? Spirit is the self. But what is the self? The self is a relation that relates itself to itself or is the relation's relating itself to itself in the relation; the self is not the relation but that the relation relates itself to itself. Man is a synthesis of the infinite and the finite, of the temporal and the eternal, of freedom and necessity, in short, a synthesis. A synthesis is a relation between two. Considered in this way, man is still not a self.

In the relation between two, the relation is the third as a negative unity, and the two relate to the relation and in the relation to the relation; thus under the qualification of the psychical the relation between the psychical and the physical is a relation. But that the relation relates itself to itself is the positive third, and this is the self.

Such a relation that relates itself to itself, a self, must either have established itself or have been established by another.
If the relation that relates itself to itself has been established by another, then the relation is indeed the third, but this relation, the third, is yet again a relation and relates itself to that which established the entire relation.

The human self is such a derived, established relation, a relation that relates itself to itself and in relating itself to itself relates itself to another. This is why there can be two forms of despair in the strict sense. If a human self had itself established itself, then there could be only one form: not to will to be oneself, to will to get rid of oneself, but there could be no question of despairfully willing to be oneself. This formula is the expression for the total dependence of the relation (the self), the expression for the fact that the self cannot of itself attain and remain in equilibrium and rest by itself, but only by relating itself to that Power which constituted the whole relation.

Despair is the sickness unto death.
The concept of the sickness unto death must be understood in a peculiar sense. Literally it means a sickness the end of which is death, and death is the end of all sicknesses. But in a Christian sense death is by no means the end of all, and hence there is an infinite difference between the sickness unto death in the strict sense and the sickness of which the end is death.

This sickness in the self is the dying death. For to die signifies that it is all over, but to die the death means to experience dying; and if one experiences it for a single moment, one thereby experiences it forever. If one might die of despair as one dies of a sickness, then the eternal in him, the self, must be capable of dying in the same sense that the body dies of sickness. But this is an impossibility; the dying of despair transforms itself constantly into a living. The despairing man cannot die; no more than "the dagger can slay thoughts" can despair consume the eternal thing, the self, which is the ground of despair, whose worm dieth not and whose fire is not quenched.
