LETTER I: ON THE QUAKERS

I thought that the doctrine and history of so extraordinary a people were worthy the attention of the curious. To acquaint myself with them I made a visit to one of the most eminent Quakers in England, who after having traded thirty years had the wisdom to prescribe limits to his fortune and to his desires, and was settled in a little solitude not far from London. Being come to him, I perceived that his house was small, but built with great neatness, without the least ornament. The Quaker owned that he had no documents that he could properly call his own, but that, nevertheless, his memory and his own knowledge would serve him instead of libraries.

He was a fresh-looking old man of a suitable size, who had never known sickness, because he had never known the passions nor intemperance. I never in my life saw a more noble or a more engaging aspect. He was dressed like those of his persuasion, in a plain coat without pleats in the sides, or buttons on the pockets and sleeves; and had on a beaver hat, the brim of which was bent downward, like those of our clergy. He did not pull off his hat when I came in, and advanced towards me without making the least bow; but there was more politeness in the open, humane air of his countenance, than in the custom of drawing one leg behind the other, and carrying that in the hand which is made to cover the head.

"Friend," said he to me, "I perceive thou art a stranger, but if I can do anything for thee, only tell me."

"Sir," said I to him, bending forwards and advancing, as is our custom, one leg towards him, "I flatter myself that my just curiosity will not give you any offense, and that you'll do me the honor to inform me of the particulars of your religion."

"The people of thy country," replied he, "are too full of their bows and compliments; but I never yet met with one of them who had so much curiosity. Come in, and let us first dine together."

I still continued to make my curtseys, and he still to speak to me as a friend and an equal.

We sat down to table. The entertainment was simple, but solid and wholesome. We drank no healths, for he said that was a vain custom. After dinner, I began my questions.

"Friend," said I to him, "are you a Christian?"

"I am," replied he, "and I hope to be a good one."

"It is certain," said I, "that you are not; for you are not baptized."

"I am not," replied he, "nor are my brethren."

"How," said I, "are you not Christians?"

"Friend," said I to him, "do not swear; we are Christians, but we do not think that Christianity consists in throwing cold water on the head, with a little salt."

"Good God," said I, "what a strange impiety! Have you forgot that Jesus Christ was baptized by John?"

"Friend," replied he, "once more do not swear. We do not practice the carnal ordinances."
