"What is a poet? An unhappy man who in his heart harbors a deep anguish, but whose lips are so fashioned that the sighs and cries which pass over them are transformed into ravishing music. His fate is like that of the unfortunate victims whom the tyrant Phalaris imprisoned in a brazen bull, and slowly tortured over a slow fire; their cries could not reach the tyrant's ears so as to strike terror into his heart; when they reached him they sounded like sweet music. And men crowd about the poet and say to him, 'Sing for us soon again'—which is as much as to say, 'May new sufferings torment your soul, but may your lips be fashioned as before; for the cries would only distress us, but the music is delicious.'"

I have nothing to lose, but neither do I have anything to win. I am not married, and I do not want to be married. I am not a father, and I do not want to be a father. I am not a citizen, and I do not want to be a citizen. I am an exception. And yet, I am also the most universal of men. For I suffer the universal human condition: the anxiety of freedom.

The aesthetic life is the life of immediacy. It is the life of the moment. The aesthete lives for pleasure, for enjoyment, for the interesting. He avoids boredom at all costs. Boredom is the root of all evil. It is the demonic pantheism. The aesthete rotates his crops, he changes his pleasures, he never commits. Marriage? A trap. A job? Slavery. Friendship? Only if it is interesting.

But the ethical life... ah, that is something else. The ethical life is the life of commitment. It is the life of duty. The ethical man marries. He takes a job. He becomes a citizen. He chooses himself. He chooses himself in his eternal validity. He repents. He takes responsibility for his past, his present, and his future.

"Marry, and you will regret it; do not marry, you will also regret it; marry or do not marry, you will regret it either way. Laugh at the world’s foolishness, you will regret it; weep over it, you will regret that too; laugh at the world’s foolishness or weep over it, you will regret both. Believe a woman, you will regret it; believe her not, you will also regret it… Hang yourself, you will regret it; do not hang yourself, and you will regret that too; hang yourself or don't hang yourself, you'll regret it either way; whether you hang yourself or do not hang yourself, you will regret both. This, gentlemen, is the essence of all philosophy."
