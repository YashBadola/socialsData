Diapsalmata

What is a poet? An unhappy man who in his heart harbors a deep anguish, but whose lips are so fashioned that the sighs and cries which pass over them are transformed into ravishing music.

I have just now come from a party where I was its life and soul; witticisms streamed from my lips, everyone laughed and admired me, but I went away — yes, the dash should be as long as the radius of the earth's orbit ——————————— and wanted to shoot myself.

I divide my time as follows: half the time I sleep, the other half I am awake. I sleep when I sleep, and I am awake when I am awake; for strangely enough, those who are most active are often those who are most asleep.

The Rotation Method

My method does not consist in change of field, but in change of crop. The rotation of crops is a vulgar principle; one must rotate the soil. One must change the method of cultivation and the kinds of grain. To be constant in love is a very respectable thing, but it is not entertaining; it is merely a way of becoming a philistine.

The Aesthete vs The Judge

The aesthetic view of life is that enjoyment is the specific condition of existence. But this enjoyment is always dependent on conditions outside the individual. The ethical view of life is that it is the individual's task to become himself, to choose himself.

Marry, and you will regret it; do not marry, you will also regret it; marry or do not marry, you will regret it either way. Laugh at the world’s foolishness, you will regret it; weep over it, you will regret that too; laugh at the world’s foolishness or weep over it, you will regret both. Believe a woman, you will regret it; believe her not, you will also regret it… This, gentlemen, is the essence of all philosophy.
