Preface

Not only in the business world but also in the world of ideas, our age stages a real clearance sale. Everything is to be had at such a bargain price that it is doubtful whether in the end there is anyone who will want to bid. Every speculative monitor who conscientiously signals the important trends in modern philosophy, every assistant professor, tutor, and student, every crofter and cottar in philosophy, is unwilling to stop with doubting everything but goes further. Perhaps it would be premature and untimely to ask where they are going, but surely it is polite and modest to assume that they have doubted everything, since otherwise it would be odd of them to say that they are going further. Having made this polite and modest assumption and admitted that they have doubted everything, without, so to speak, invalidating this by saying so, one is then at liberty to offer to them the goal they are aiming for.

The Knight of Faith

If I were to speak of the knight of faith, I would say: The only thing I can do is describe the movements of faith, but I cannot make them. If a person can make them, he is a knight of faith. It is a source of great wonder to me. I can describe the movements of faith, but I cannot make them. When one looks at the knight of faith, one might easily mistake him for a tax collector or a clerk. He takes a holiday on Sunday. He goes to church. He is like a dancer who has made a leap, and lands so well that he does not stagger. He is completely finite, yet he lives in the infinite.

The knight of faith is the only happy man, the heir to the finite, while the knight of resignation is a stranger and an alien. To get the princess, to live with her joyfully and happily day after day (for it is also conceivable that the knight of resignation might get the princess, but that his soul had lost the elasticity of the finite)—this is what the knight of faith does, and the only thing he does.

Problem I: Is there a Teleological Suspension of the Ethical?

The ethical as such is the universal, and as the universal it applies to everyone, which may be expressed from another point of view by saying that it applies every instant. It rests immanent in itself, has nothing without itself which is its telos, but is itself telos for everything outside it, and when this has been incorporated by the ethical it can go no further. Conceived immediately as physical and psychical, the particular individual is the particular which has its telos in the universal, and its task is to express itself constantly in it, to abolish its particularity in order to become the universal. As soon as the particular individual asserts himself in his particularity over against the universal, he sins, and only by recognizing this can he again reconcile himself with the universal.

Faith is precisely this paradox, that the individual as the particular is higher than the universal, is justified over against it, is not subordinate but superior—yet in such a way, be it observed, that it is the particular individual who, after he has been subordinated as the particular to the universal, now through the universal becomes the individual who as the particular is superior to the universal, for the fact that the individual as the particular stands in an absolute relation to the absolute. This position cannot be mediated, for all mediation comes about precisely by virtue of the universal; it is and remains to all eternity a paradox, inaccessible to thought.
