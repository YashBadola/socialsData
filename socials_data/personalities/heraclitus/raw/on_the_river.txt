You cannot step twice into the same river.

Into the same rivers we step and do not step, we are and are not.

On those who step into the same rivers, different and different waters flow.

We must know that war is common to all and strife is justice, and that all things come into being and pass away through strife.

The way up and the way down is one and the same.
