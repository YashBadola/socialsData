The life of man is this: a being who makes himself a lack of being in order that there might be being. That is why we can say that he is a "project". He is not a fixed substance, but a movement towards the future. To will oneself free is also to will others free. This will is not an abstract formula. It represents a concrete bond with others.

The wish for all men to be free is the desire to be free oneself. But this desire is not a given; it is a conquest. Freedom is the source from which all significations and all values spring. It is the original condition of all justification of existence. The man who seeks to justify his life must want freedom itself absolutely and above everything else. At the same time that it requires the realization of concrete ends, of particular projects, it requires itself universally. It is not a ready-made value which offers itself from the outside to my abstract adherence, but it appears (not on the plane of facility, but on the moral plane) as a cause of itself.

To exist is to make oneself a lack of being; it is to cast oneself into the world. Those who are described as serious men are those who hide from themselves this lack of being, by identifying themselves with a cause, a thing, or a goal, as if it were an absolute value. They are afraid of their own freedom. The serious man gets rid of his freedom by claiming to subordinate it to values which would be unconditioned. He imagines that the accession to these values consoles him for his existential collapse. He takes himself for a thing.

But we must face the ambiguity of our condition. We are both subject and object, freedom and facticity. We must assume our freedom in a world which is not our own making, but which we contribute to creating every day. We must not flee into the comfort of ready-made answers or absolute authorities. We must create our own values and take responsibility for them.

Ethics does not furnish recipes any more than do science and art. One can merely propose methods. Thus, in science the goal is to conquer the whole of reality; and yet the method is to define a particular problem and to solve it. In art the goal is to possess the whole of the world; and yet the method is to create a particular object. In ethics, the goal is to justify the world and the individual's existence; and yet the method is to treat a particular problem.
