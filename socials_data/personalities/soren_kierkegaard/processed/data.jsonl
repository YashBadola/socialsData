{"text": "Diapsalmata\nWhat is a poet? An unhappy man who in his heart harbors a deep anguish, but whose lips are so fashioned that the moans and cries which pass over them are transformed into ravishing music. His fate is like that of the unfortunate victims whom the tyrant Phalaris imprisoned in a brazen bull, and slowly tortured over a steady fire; their cries could not reach the tyrant\u2019s ears so as to strike terror into his heart; when they reached his ears they sounded like sweet music. And men crowd about the poet and say to him, \u201cSing for us soon again\u201d\u2014which is as much as to say, \u201cMay new sufferings torment your soul, but may your lips be fashioned as before; for the cries would only distress us, but the music is delicious.\u201d\nI have the courage, I believe, to doubt everything; I have the courage, I believe, to fight with everything; but I have not the courage to know anything, not the courage to possess, to own anything. Most people complain that the world is so prosaic, that life is not like a romance, where opportunities are always favorable. I complain that life is not like a romance, where one has hard-hearted parents and ogres and trolls to fight, and enchanted princesses to free. What are all such enemies taken together, compared with the pale, bloodless, tenacious, nocturnal shapes with which I fight, and to which I myself give life and being.\nThe Rotation Method\nPeople with a very great deal of experience often speak in such a way that beginners like me can make no sense of what they say. Thus they say that one should love, for example, the beloved one, more than oneself. This is contrary to all order and reason. For if I am to love her more than myself, I must at least be something to begin with; but if I love her more than myself, I become nothing.\nThe whole secret lies in arbitrariness. People usually think that it is easy to be arbitrary, but it requires much study to succeed in being arbitrary so as not to lose oneself in it, but so as to derive satisfaction from it. One does not enjoy the immediate, but something quite different which he arbitrarily imports into it. You go to see the middle of a play, you read the third part of a book. By this means you insure yourself a very different kind of enjoyment from that which the author has been so kind as to plan for you. You enjoy something entirely accidental; you consider the whole of existence from this standpoint; the result is that the whole of life becomes a play.\nThe Seducer's Diary\nI am an aesthete. To me, life is a work of art, and I am its creator. I manipulate the threads of existence to weave a tapestry of pleasure and intrigue. The ethical? The religious? They are but constraints on the free spirit of the artist. My Cordelia! She is my canvas. I will paint upon her soul the colors of passion, and then, when the masterpiece is complete, I will step back and admire... and then move on to a fresh canvas. For repetition is the death of pleasure.", "source": "either_or_excerpts.txt"}
{"text": "Preface\nNot only in the world of commerce but also in the world of ideas our age is putting on a veritable clearance sale. Everything is to be had at such a bargain that it is questionable whether in the end there is anybody who will want to bid. Every speculative price-fixer who conscientiously directs attention to the significant march of modern philosophy, every privat-docent, tutor, and student, every crofter and cottar in philosophy, is not content with doubting everything but goes further. Perhaps it would be untimely and ill-timed to ask them where they are going, but surely it is courteous and unobtrusive to take it for granted that they have doubted everything, since otherwise it would be queer to say that they were going further. This preliminary movement they have therefore all completed, and it is presumed that such is the case not only with the few who can do it but with everyone who wills to do it, and this \"everyone\" includes also the \"crofters and cottars\" in philosophy.\nProblem I: Is there such a thing as a Teleological Suspension of the Ethical?\nThe ethical as such is the universal, it applies to everyone, and the same thing is expressed from another point of view by saying that it applies every instant. It reposes immanently in itself, it has nothing without itself which is its telos, but is itself telos for everything outside it, and when this has been incorporated by it it can go no further. Conceived immediately as physical and psychical, the particular individual is the individual who has his telos in the universal, and his ethical task is to express himself constantly in it, to abolish his particularity in order to become the universal. As soon as the individual would assert himself as the particular over against the universal, he sins, and only by recognizing this can he again reconcile himself with the universal.\nFaith is precisely this paradox, that the individual as the particular is higher than the universal, is justified over against it, is not subordinate but superior\u2014yet in such a way, be it observed, that it is the particular individual who, after he has been subordinated as the particular to the universal, now through the universal becomes the individual who as the particular is superior to the universal, for the fact that the individual as the particular stands in an absolute relation to the absolute. This position cannot be mediated, for all mediation comes about precisely by virtue of the universal; it is and remains to all eternity a paradox, inaccessible to thought. And yet faith is this paradox\u2014or else (these are the logical consequences which I would beg the reader to judge) there never has been faith...\nThe story of Abraham contains therefore a teleological suspension of the ethical. As the individual he became higher than the universal. This is the paradox which does not permit of mediation. It is just as inexplicable how he got into it as it is inexplicable how he remained in it. If such is not the position of Abraham, then he is not even a tragic hero but a murderer. To want to continue to call him the father of faith, to talk of this to people who do not concern themselves with anything but words, is thoughtless. A man can become a tragic hero by his own powers\u2014but not a knight of faith. When a man enters upon the way, in a certain sense the hard way of the tragic hero, many will be able to give him counsel; to him who follows the narrow way of faith no one can give counsel, him no one can understand. Faith is a miracle, and yet no man is excluded from it; for that in which all human life is unified is passion, and faith is a passion.", "source": "fear_and_trembling_excerpts.txt"}
