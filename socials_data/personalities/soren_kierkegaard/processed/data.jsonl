{"text": "PREFACE\nNot only in the world of commerce but also in the world of ideas our age is putting on a veritable clearance sale. Everything may be had at such a bargain that it is doubtful whether in the end there is anyone who will want to buy. Every speculative price-fixer who conscientiously directs attention to the significant march of modern philosophy, every privat-docent, tutor, and student, every crofter and cottager in philosophy, is not content with doubting everything but goes further. Perhaps it would be untimely and ill-timed to ask them where they are going, but surely it is courteous and not without regard for the individual's well-being to take it for granted that they have doubted everything, since otherwise it would be a queer thing for them to be going further. Having made this polite conceptual motion and having thus accepted the motion, one is dispensed from absolute obedience to the popular requirement of having to express oneself in the same terms as everyone else; for although I am very far from understanding the new philosophy, I do know enough to know that its terminology is to a high degree indefinite, and that the same word signifies different things in different mouths.\nPANEGYRIC UPON ABRAHAM\nIf there were no eternal consciousness in a man, if at the bottom of everything there were only a wild ferment, a power that twisting in dark passions produced everything great or inconsequential; if an unfathomable, insatiable emptiness lay hid beneath everything, what would life be but despair? If it were thus, if there were no sacred bond uniting mankind, if one generation rose up after another like the leaves of the forest, if one generation succeeded the other like the songs of birds in the woods, if the human race passed through the world as a ship through the sea or the wind through the desert, a thoughtless and fruitless whim, if an eternal oblivion always lurked hungrily for its prey and there were no power strong enough to wrest it from its clutches\u2014how empty and devoid of comfort would life be! But for that reason it is not so; and as God created man and woman, so too He fashioned the hero and the poet or orator. The poet cannot do what the hero does, he can only admire, love and rejoice in the hero. But he too is happy, and not less so; for the hero is as it were his better nature, with which he is in love, and yet he is not the hero, and therefore his love is not self-love.\nPROBLEM I: IS THERE SUCH A THING AS A TELEOLOGICAL SUSPENSION OF THE ETHICAL?\nThe ethical as such is the universal, it applies to everyone, and the same thing is expressed from another point of view by saying that it applies every instant. It reposes immanently in itself, it has nothing without itself which is its telos, but is itself telos for everything outside it, and when this has been incorporated by the ethical it can go no further. Conceived immediately as physical and psychical, the particular individual is the particular which has its telos in the universal, and its task is to express itself constantly in it, to abolish its particularity in order to become the universal. As soon as the individual would assert himself as the particular over against the universal, he sins, and only by recognizing this can he again reconcile himself with the universal. Every time the individual after he has entered the universal either feels an impulse to assert himself as the particular, he is in temptation (Anfechtung), and he can labor himself out of this only by abandoning himself as the particular in the universal. If this be the highest thing that can be said of man and of his existence, then the ethical has the same nature as man's eternal blessedness, which to all eternity and at every instant is his telos, since it would be a contradiction to say that this might be abandoned (i.e. teleologically suspended), seeing that as soon as it is suspended it is forfeited, whereas in other cases what is suspended is not forfeited but is preserved in the higher which constitutes its telos.\nIf such be the case, then Hegel is right when in his chapter on \"The Good and the Conscience,\" he characterizes man only as the particular and regards this character as \"a moral form of evil\" which is to be annulled in the teleology of the moral, so that the individual who remains in this stage is either sinning or subjected to temptation (Anfechtung). On the other hand, he is wrong when he speaks of faith, wrong in not protesting loudly and clearly against the fact that Abraham enjoys honor and glory as the father of faith, whereas he ought to be prosecuted and convicted of murder.\nFor faith is this paradox, that the particular is higher than the universal\u2014yet in such a way, be it observed, that the movement repeats itself, and that consequently the individual, after having been in the universal, now as the particular isolates himself as higher than the universal. If this be not faith, then Abraham is lost, then faith has never existed in the world... because it has always existed. For if the ethical (i.e. the moral) is the highest thing, and if nothing incommensurable remains in man in any other way but as the evil (i.e. the particular which has to be expressed in the universal), then one needs no other categories than those which the Greek philosophers possessed or which can be deduced from them. This is the phrase which all eternity can be repeated, for it says everything and yet nothing.\nBut now to Abraham. How did he act? For I have not forgotten that I am merely an amanuensis, not a poet, and that my problem is to draw out the dialectical consequences of his conduct, not to offer a panegyric upon him. He journeys to Mount Moriah. He says nothing to Sarah, nothing to Eliezer. Who indeed could understand him? Had he not to sacrifice the best thing he possessed, to give it up for the universal? That is done easily enough, but he had not to do that. He had to sacrifice Isaac, to sacrifice the best thing he possessed, for God's sake, and for his own sake\u2014for God's sake because God demanded this proof of his faith; for his own sake in order that he might surrender the proof.", "source": "fear_and_trembling_excerpts.txt"}
