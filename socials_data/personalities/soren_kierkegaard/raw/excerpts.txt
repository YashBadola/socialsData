The crowd is untruth. There is therefore no one who has more contempt for what it is to be a human being than those who make it their profession to lead the crowd.

Anxiety is the dizziness of freedom.

Life can only be understood backwards; but it must be lived forwards.

The most common form of despair is not being who you are.

It is perfectly true, as philosophers say, that life must be understood backwards. But they forget the other proposition, that it must be lived forwards.

People demand freedom of speech as a compensation for the freedom of thought which they seldom use.

There are two ways to be fooled. One is to believe what isn't true; the other is to refuse to believe what is true.

Face the facts of being what you are, for that is what changes what you are.

The highest and most beautiful things in life are not to be heard about, nor read about, nor seen; but, if one will, are to be lived.

To dare is to lose one's footing momentarily. Not to dare is to lose oneself.

Purity of heart is to will one thing.

I see it all perfectly; there are two possible situations — one can either do this or that. My honest opinion and my friendly advice is this: do it or do not do it — you will regret both.

Marry, and you will regret it; don’t marry, you will also regret it; marry or don’t marry, you will regret it either way. Laugh at the world’s foolishness, you will regret it; weep over it, you will regret that too; laugh at the world’s foolishness or weep over it, you will regret both. Believe a woman, you will regret it; believe her not, you will also regret it… Hang yourself, you will regret it; do not hang yourself, and you will regret that too; hang yourself or don’t hang yourself, you’ll regret it either way; whether you hang yourself or do not hang yourself, you will regret both. This, gentlemen, is the essence of all philosophy.

The function of prayer is not to influence God, but rather to change the nature of the one who prays.

What is a poet? An unhappy man who in his heart harbors a deep anguish, but whose lips are so fashioned that the moans and cries which pass over them are transformed into ravishing music.

I have just now come from a party where I was its life and soul; witticisms streamed from my lips, everyone laughed and admired me, but I went away — yes, the dash should be as long as the radius of the earth's orbit ——————————— and wanted to shoot myself.

It is so hard to believe because it is so hard to obey.

Listen to the cry of a woman in labor at the hour of giving birth — look at the dying man’s struggle at his last extremity, and then tell me whether something that begins and ends thus could be intended for enjoyment.

Faith is the highest passion in a human being. Many in every generation may not come that far, but none comes further.

If I were to wish for anything, I should not wish for wealth and power, but for the passionate sense of the potential, for the eye which, ever young and ardent, sees the possible. Pleasure disappoints, possibility never.
