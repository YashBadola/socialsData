DIAPSALMATA

What is a poet? An unhappy man who in his heart harbors a deep anguish, but whose lips are so fashioned that the moans and cries which pass over them are transformed into ravishing music. His fate is like that of the sufferers in the bull of Phalaris, who were not silenced by the tyrant’s slow fire but whose screams could not reach the tyrant’s ears to terrify him; to him they sounded like sweet music.

I have the courage, I believe, to doubt everything; I have the courage, I believe, to fight with everything; but I have not the courage to know anything, not the courage to possess, to own anything. Most people complain that the world is so prosaic, that life is not like a romance, where opportunities are always so favorable. I complain that life is not like a romance, where one has hard-hearted parents and nixies and trolls to fight, and enchanted princesses to free. What are all such enemies taken together compared with the pale, bloodless, tenacious, nocturnal shapes with which I fight and to which I give life and being?

My sorrow is my castle, which like an eagle's eyrie is built high up on the mountain peak among the clouds. No one can storm it. From it I fly down into reality to seize my prey; but I do not stay down there, I bring my prey home; and this prey is a picture I weave into the tapestries of my palace.

The Rotation of Crops

People with experience maintain that proceeding from a basic principle is the supposed starting point for all sorts of high-flown conjectures. I say that it is the starting point for nothing. It is not a starting point, but a stopping point.

One gets tired of living in the country, and one moves to the city; one gets tired of one's native land, and travels abroad; one is tire of Europe, and goes to America, and so on; finally one indulges in a sentimental hope of endless journeyings from star to star. Or the movement is different but the soul is the same. One gets tired of porcelain dishes and eats on silver; one gets tired of silver and eats on gold; one burns half of Rome to get an idea of the burning of Troy. This method defeats itself; it is the bad infinite. What did Nero gain by it? Antonine was wiser; he says: "It is in your power to live your life over again; look at things as you did before, for that is a new life."

The method I propose does not depend on change of soil and climate but on change of crop.
