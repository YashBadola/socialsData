I. Concerning the divine perfection and that God does everything in the most desirable way.
The most widely accepted and meaningful notion we have of God is expressed well enough in these words: that God is an absolutely perfect being; yet the consequences of these words are not sufficiently considered. And, to get farther into the matter, it is appropriate to remark that there are several entirely different perfections in nature, that God possesses all of them together, and that each of them belongs to him in the highest degree. We must also know what a perfection is. One thing is quite certain, that if forms or natures were not simple, they would not be perfections. For, as I have said, they involve no limits or bounds. It follows from this that power and knowledge are perfections, and, insofar as they belong to God, they do not have limits.

Whence it follows that God, possessing supreme and infinite wisdom, acts in the most perfect manner, not only metaphysically, but also morally speaking; and that we can say that in virtue of this, he is the most perfect architect, or rather the most perfect monarch, and that he does everything in the best possible way.

II. Against those who hold that there is absolutely no goodness in the works of God, or that the rules of goodness and beauty are arbitrary.
Therefore, I am far removed from the opinion of those who maintain that there are no rules of goodness and perfection in the nature of things, or in the ideas which God has of them, and that the works of God are good only for the formal reason that God has made them. For, if that were the case, God, knowing that he is the author of things, would not have to regard them afterwards and find them good, as holy scripture witnesses.

III. Against those who believe that God could have done better.
Neither am I able to approve of the opinion of some moderns who maintain boldly that that which God has made is not perfect in the highest degree, and that he could have done much better. For it seems to me that the consequences of this opinion are wholly contrary to the glory of God. Uti minus malum habet rationem boni, ita minus bonum habet rationem mali. And to act with less perfection than one could have is to act imperfectly. To show that an architect could have done better is to find fault with his work.

IV. That the love of God demands our complete satisfaction and acquiescence with respect to what he has done.
The general knowledge of this great truth that God acts always in the most perfect and most desirable manner possible, is in my opinion the basis of the love which we owe to God in all things; for he who loves seeks his satisfaction in the felicity or perfection of the object loved and of his actions. Idem velle et idem nolle vera amicitia est. I believe that it is difficult to love God truly when one, having the power to change his disposition, is not disposed to wish for what God desires.

V. What the rules of perfection of the divine conduct consist in, and that the simplicity of the ways is in balance with the richness of the effects.
It is sufficient therefore to have this confidence in God, that he does everything for the best and that nothing can hurt those who love him. But to know in particular the reasons which have moved him to choose this order of the universe, to permit sins, to dispense his saving grace in a certain manner, this passes the capacity of a finite mind, above all when it has not yet come into the enjoyment of the vision of God. However, it is possible to make some general remarks touching the conduct of providence in the government of things. One can say that he who acts perfectly is like an excellent Geometer who knows how to find the best construction for a problem; like a good architect who utilizes his location and the funds destined for the building in the most advantageous manner, leaving nothing which shocks or which does not display that beauty of which it is capable.
