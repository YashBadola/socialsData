The Aesthetic Validity of Marriage

My friend,

You are young, you are a poet, and, if you will allow me to say so, you are a little bit of a fool. You have fallen in love, you have been accepted, and you are the happiest of men. But for all that you are not satisfied. You want to be unhappy, you want to be the unhappy lover, and you are not. You are engaged to be married, and you are going to be married, and you are going to be a husband, and you are going to be a father, and you are going to be a citizen, and you are going to be a Philistine.

What is it that connects me with life? What is it that binds me to it? The first thing that greets my eyes is a huge question mark.

I divide my time as follows: half the time I sleep, the other half I dream. I never dream when I sleep, for that would be a pity, for sleeping is the highest genius.

Marry, and you will regret it; do not marry, and you will also regret it; marry or do not marry, you will regret it either way. Laugh at the world’s foolishness, you will regret it; weep over it, you will regret it; laugh at the world’s foolishness or weep over it, you will regret it either way; whether you laugh at the world’s foolishness or weep over it, you will regret it either way. Believe a woman, you will regret it; believe her not, you will regret it; believe a woman or believe her not, you will regret it either way; whether you believe a woman or believe her not, you will regret it either way. Hang yourself, you will regret it; do not hang yourself, and you will regret it; hang yourself or do not hang yourself, you will regret it either way; whether you hang yourself or do not hang yourself, you will regret it either way. This, gentlemen, is the essence of all philosophy.

Life can only be understood backwards; but it must be lived forwards.
