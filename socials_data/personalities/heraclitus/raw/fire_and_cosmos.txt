This world, which is the same for all, no one of gods or men has made; but it was ever, is now, and ever shall be an ever-living Fire, with measures of it kindling, and measures going out.
It is the thunderbolt that steers the course of all things.
All things are an exchange for Fire, and Fire for all things, even as wares for gold and gold for wares.
