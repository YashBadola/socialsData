{"content": "Not only in the world of commerce but also in the world of ideas our age is putting on a veritable clearance sale. Everything may be had at such a bargain that it is questionable whether in the end there is anybody who will want to bid. Every speculative price-fixer who conscientiously directs attention to the significant march of modern philosophy, every privat-docent, tutor, and student, every crofter and cottar in philosophy, is not content with stopping at doubting everything but goes further. It might, perhaps, be untimely and ill-timed to ask them where they are going, but surely it is courteous and altogether proper to assume that they have doubted everything, since otherwise it would be queer for them to be going further. This preliminary movement they have therefore all of them made, and presumably with such ease that they do not think it necessary to waste a word about the how; for not even he who anxiously and with deep concern sought a little enlightenment by means of the renowned Straightway found this step particularly heavy or cause for anxiety.", "source_work": "Fear And Trembling", "metadata": {"chunk_id": "Fear_And_Trembling_0001", "reading_complexity": 56.63, "sentiment_tone": "intellectual", "topics": ["anxiety"], "archival_info": {"archivist": "Archibald 'Archie' Texton", "timestamp": "2026-01-22T18:18:44.760240", "version": "2.14.2", "note": "Preserved for posterity."}}}
