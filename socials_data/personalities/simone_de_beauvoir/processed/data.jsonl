{"text": "Introduction\nFor a long time I have hesitated to write a book on woman. The subject is irritating, especially to women; and it is not new. Enough ink has been spilled in the quarreling over feminism, now practically over, and perhaps we should say no more about it. It is still talked about, however, for the voluminous nonsense uttered during the last century seems to have done little to illuminate the problem. After all, is there a problem? And if so, what is it? Are there women, really? Most assuredly the theory of the eternal feminine still has its adherents who will whisper in your ear: \"Even in Russia women still are women\"; and other erudite persons - sometimes the very same - say with a sigh: \"Woman is losing her way, woman is lost.\" One wonders if women still exist, if they will always exist, whether or not it is desirable that they should, what place they occupy in this world, what their place should be. \"What is a woman?\"\nTo state the question is, to me, to suggest, at once, a preliminary answer. The fact that I ask it is in itself significant. A man would never get the idea of writing a book on the peculiar situation of the human male. But if I wish to define myself, I must first of all say: \"I am a woman\"; on this truth shall be based all further discussion. A man never begins by presenting himself as an individual of a certain sex; it goes without saying that he is a man. The terms masculine and feminine are used symmetrically only as a matter of form, as on legal papers. In actuality the relation of the two sexes is not quite like that of two electrical poles, for man represents both the positive and the neutral, as is indicated by the common use of man to designate human beings in general; whereas woman represents only the negative, defined by limiting criteria, without reciprocity.\nOne is not born, but rather becomes, a woman. No biological, psychological, or economic fate determines the figure that the human female presents in society; it is civilization as a whole that produces this creature, intermediate between male and eunuch, which is described as feminine. Only the intervention of someone else can establish an individual as an Other.", "source": "the_second_sex_intro.txt"}
{"text": "I was born at four o'clock in the morning on the 9th of January 1908, in a room fitted with white-enamelled furniture and overlooking the Boulevard Raspail. In the family photographs taken the following summer, one sees ladies in long dresses and ostrich-feather hats, and gentlemen wearing boaters and panamas, all smiling at a baby: they are my parents, my grandfather, uncles, aunts; and the baby is me. My father was thirty, my mother twenty-one, and I was their first child. I turn the page: here is a photograph of Mama holding in her arms a baby who isn't me; I am wearing a pleated skirt and a tam-o'-shanter; I am two and a half years old, and my sister has just been born. I was evidently jealous, but not for long. As far back as I can remember, I was proud of being the elder: the first. Disguised as Little Red Riding Hood and carrying a basket of cakes and a pot of butter, I felt myself much more interesting than an infant swaddled in its cradle. I had a little sister: that baby didn't have me.\nI remember. The white-enamelled furniture was still there. I find myself in a world that is secure, bounded by the circle of my parents' affection. I am the center of that world. My father is a lawyer, an amateur actor, a man of wit and culture. My mother is a devout Catholic, reserved and deeply attached to her duties. Between the skepticism of my father and the piety of my mother, I learned to think for myself. I learned that the world is not a given, but a task to be achieved.\nTo be a dutiful daughter was to follow the path laid out for me: marriage, children, domesticity. But everything in me rebelled against this fate. I wanted to write. I wanted to live. I wanted to be free. And I knew, even then, that my freedom would be won only through a struggle against the very structures that sought to define me.", "source": "memoirs_excerpt.txt"}
{"text": "The continuous work of our life is to build death. Man knows and thinks this tragic ambivalence which the animal and the plant merely undergo. A new paradox is thereby introduced into his destiny. \"Rational animal,\" \"thinking reed,\" he escapes from his natural condition without, however, freeing himself from it. He is still a part of this world of which he is a consciousness. He asserts himself as a pure internality against which no external power can take hold, and he also experiences himself as a thing crushed by the dark weight of other things. At every moment he can grasp the non-temporal truth of his existence. But between the past which no longer is and the future which is not yet, this moment when he exists is nothing. This privilege, which he alone possesses, of being a sovereign and unique subject amidst a universe of objects, is what he shares with all his fellow-men. In turn an object for others, he is nothing more than an individual in the collectivity on which he depends.\nAs long as there have been men and they have lived, they have all felt this tragic ambiguity of their condition, but as long as there have been philosophers and they have thought, most of them have tried to mask it. They have striven to reduce mind to matter, or to reabsorb matter into mind, or to merge them within a single substance. Those who have accepted the dualism have established a hierarchy between body and soul which permits of considering as negligible the part of the self which cannot be saved. They have denied death, either by integrating it with life or by promising to man immortality. Or, known as the materialists, they have denied the freedom of man.\nExistentialism asserts that every man is free but that his freedom is only real when he wills the freedom of others. To will oneself free is also to will others free. This is not an abstract formula. It is the concrete truth of human existence. The man who seeks to justify his life must want freedom itself absolutely and universally.", "source": "ethics_of_ambiguity_excerpt.txt"}
