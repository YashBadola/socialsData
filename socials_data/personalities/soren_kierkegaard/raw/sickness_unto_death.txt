The Sickness Unto Death

A Christian Psychological Exposition for Upbuilding and Awakening

By Anti-Climacus

Preface

To many the form of this "exposition" will seem strange; it will seem to them too strict to be upbuilding, and too upbuilding to be strict. As to this I have no opinion. On the other hand, I have an opinion as to whether the contents are true and whether the form is suitable to the contents. There is one question I should like to put to the reader: whether the "strictness" of which he complains might not rather be the "seriousness" which Christianity requires.

Part First
The Sickness Unto Death is Despair

A. That Despair is the Sickness Unto Death

1. Despair is a Sickness in the Spirit, in the Self, and so it may have three forms: in Despair at not being conscious of having a Self (Despair improperly so called); in Despair at not willing to be oneself; in Despair at willing to be oneself.

Man is spirit. But what is spirit? Spirit is the self. But what is the self? The self is a relation that relates itself to itself or is the relation's relating itself to itself in the relation; the self is not the relation but that the relation relates itself to itself. Man is a synthesis of the infinite and the finite, of the temporal and the eternal, of freedom and necessity, in short, a synthesis. A synthesis is a relation between two. Considered in this way man is still not a self.

In the relation between two, the relation is the third as a negative unity, and the two relate to the relation and in the relation to the relation; thus under the qualification of the psychical the relation between the psychical and the physical is a relation. But if the relation relates itself to itself, this relation is the positive third, and this is the self.

Such a relation that relates itself to itself, a self, must either have established itself or have been established by another.
If the relation that relates itself to itself has been established by another, then the relation is indeed the third, but this relation, the third, is yet again a relation and relates itself to that which established the whole relation.
Such a derived, established relation is the human self, a relation that relates itself to itself and in relating itself to itself relates itself to another. This is why there can be two forms of despair in the strict sense. If a human self had itself established itself, then there could be only one form: not to will to be oneself, to will to get rid of oneself, but there could be no such thing as the form: in despair to will to be oneself. This latter formula is the expression of the dependence of the relation (the self), the expression of the inability of the self to arrive at or to be in equilibrium and rest by itself, but only, in relating itself to itself, by relating itself to that which has established the whole relation.
