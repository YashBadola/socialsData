{"text": "The way up and the way down are one and the same.\nNo man ever steps in the same river twice, for it's not the same river and he's not the same man.\nThis world, which is the same for all, no one of gods or men has made; but it was ever, is now, and ever shall be an ever-living Fire, with measures of it kindling, and measures going out.\nWar is the father of all and the king of all; and some he has made gods and some men, some bond and some free.\nImmortals are mortals, mortals immortals: living their death, dying their life.\nThe waking have one common world, but the sleeping turn aside each into a world of his own.\nListening not to me but to the Logos it is wise to agree that all things are one.\nIf you do not expect the unexpected, you will not find it; for it is hard to be sought out and difficult.\nNature loves to hide.\nDogs bark at what they do not understand.\nTime is a game played beautifully by children.\nEverything flows and nothing stays.\nIt is hard to fight with anger; for what it wants it buys at the price of soul.\nA man's character is his fate.\nThe sun is new each day.\nWisdom is one thing. It is to know the thought by which all things are steered through all things.\nCouples are things whole and things not whole, what is drawn together and what is drawn asunder, the harmonious and the discordant. The one is made up of all things, and all things issue from the one.\nEyes and ears are bad witnesses to men if they have souls that understand not their language.\nMuch learning does not teach understanding.\nTo God all things are fair and good and right, but men hold some things wrong and some right.", "source": "fragments.txt"}
