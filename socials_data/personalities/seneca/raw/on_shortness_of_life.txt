ON THE SHORTNESS OF LIFE

Chapter I

It is not that we have a short time to live, but that we waste a lot of it. Life is long enough, and a sufficiently generous amount has been given to us for the highest achievements if it were all well invested. But when it is wasted in heedless luxury and spent on no good activity, we are forced at last by death's final constraint to realize that it has passed away before we knew it was passing. So it is: we are not given a short life but we make it short, and we are not ill supplied but wasteful of it. Just as when ample and princely wealth falls to a bad owner it is squandered in a moment, but wealth however modest, if entrusted to a good custodian, increases with use, so our lifetime extends for plenty of time for him who arranges it properly.

Chapter II

Why do we complain of Nature? She has shown herself kindly; life, if you know how to use it, is long. But one man is possessed by an avarice that is insatiable, another by a laborious diligence in useless tasks; one is soaked in wine, another is sluggish with idleness; one is worried by a political ambition that is always at the mercy of the judgment of others, another through hope of profit is driven fast over all lands and seas by the greed of trading; some are tormented by a passion for the camp, always intent on other people's dangers or anxious about their own; some are worn out by the self-imposed servitude of thankless attendance on the great; many are kept busy either in the pursuit of other men's fortune or in complaining of their own; many, following no fixed aim, shifting and inconstant and dissatisfied, are plunged by their fickleness into plans that are ever new; some have no fixed principle by which to direct their course, but Fate takes them by surprise while they are lolling and yawning; so surely does it happen that I cannot doubt the truth of that utterance which the greatest of poets delivered with all the seeming of an oracle: "The part of life we really live is small." For all the rest of existence is not life, but merely time.
