I am a citizen of the world.

The foundation of every state is the education of its youth.

Blushing is the color of virtue.

Dogs and philosophers do the greatest good and get the fewest rewards.

It is not that I am mad, it is only that my head is different from yours.

We have two ears and one tongue so that we would listen more and talk less.

To arrive at perfection, you need severe critics or loyal friends; for they will tell you what you are doing or not doing.

The mob is the mother of tyrants.

He who has the most is most content with the least.

Man is the most intelligent of the animals - and the most silly.
