{"text": "If there were no eternal consciousness in a man, if at the foundation of all there lay only a wildly seething power which writhing with obscure passions produced everything that is great and everything that is insignificant, if a bottomless void never satiated lay hidden beneath all--what then would life be but despair?\nFaith is precisely this paradox, that the individual as the particular is higher than the universal, is justified over against it, is not subordinate but superior\u2014yet in such a way, be it observed, that it is the particular individual who, after he has been subordinated as the particular to the universal, now through the universal becomes the individual who as the particular is superior to the universal, for the fact that the individual as the particular stands in an absolute relation to the absolute.\nThe most common form of despair is not being who you are.\nPeople demand freedom of speech as a compensation for the freedom of thought which they seldom use.\nLife can only be understood backwards; but it must be lived forwards.\nIt is quite true what Philosophy says: that Life must be understood backwards. But that makes one forget the other saying: that it must be lived--forwards.\nAnxiety is the dizziness of freedom.\nThe crowd is untruth.\nTo dare is to lose one's footing momentarily. Not to dare is to lose oneself.\nPurity of heart is to will one thing.\nI conceive of God as one who approves in a calculated vigilance, I believe that he approves of intrigues, and that he has a special crotchet for them.\nWhat is a poet? An unhappy man who hides deep anguish in his heart, but whose lips are so formed that when the sigh and cry pass through them, it sounds like lovely music.\nFace the facts of being what you are, for that is what changes what you are.", "source": "excerpts.txt"}
