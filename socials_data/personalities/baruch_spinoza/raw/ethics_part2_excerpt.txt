PART II. OF THE NATURE AND ORIGIN OF THE MIND.

PROP. I. Thought is an attribute of God, or God is a thinking thing.
Proof.—Particular thoughts, or this or that thought, are modes which, in a certain conditioned manner, express the nature of God (Part I., Prop. xxv., Coroll.). God therefore possesses the attribute (Part I., Def. v.) of which the concept is involved in all particular thoughts, which latter are conceived thereby. Thought, therefore, is one of the infinite attributes of God, which express God's eternal and infinite essence (Part I., Def. vi.), or God is a thinking thing. Q.E.D.

PROP. II. Extension is an attribute of God, or God is an extended thing.
Proof.—The proof of this proposition is similar to that of the last.

PROP. VII. The order and connection of ideas is the same as the order and connection of things.
Proof.—This is evident from Part I., Ax. iv. For the idea of everything that is caused depends on a knowledge of the cause, whereof it is an effect.

Corollary.—Hence God's power of thinking is equal to his actual power of acting; that is, whatever follows from the infinite nature of God in the world of extension (formaliter), follows without exception in the same order and connection from the idea of God in the world of thought (objective).
