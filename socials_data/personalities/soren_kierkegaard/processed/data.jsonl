{"text": "The present state of the world and the whole of life is diseased. If I were a doctor and were asked for my advice, I should reply: Create silence! Bring men to silence. The word of God cannot be heard in the noisy world of today. And even if it were blazoned forth with all the panoply of noise so that it could be heard in the midst of all the other noise, then it would no longer be the word of God. Therefore create silence.\nSubjectivity is truth.\nThe thing is to understand myself, to see what God really wishes me to do; the thing is to find a truth which is true for me, to find the idea for which I can live and die.\nAnxiety is the dizziness of freedom.\nLife can only be understood backwards; but it must be lived forwards.\nThe crowd is untruth.\nPeople demand freedom of speech as a compensation for the freedom of thought which they seldom use.\nIt is perfectly true, as philosophers say, that life must be understood backwards. But they forget the other proposition, that it must be lived forwards.\nThere are two ways to be fooled. One is to believe what isn't true; the other is to refuse to believe what is true.\nThe highest and most beautiful thing is thus to be patient.\nTo dare is to lose one's footing momentarily. To not dare is to lose oneself.\nThe most common form of despair is not being who you are.\nWhat is a poet? An unhappy man who in his heart harbors a deep anguish, but whose lips are so fashioned that the sighs and cries which pass over them are transformed into ravishing music.\nIt is so hard to believe because it is so hard to obey.\nFace the facts of being what you are, for that is what changes what you are.\nPrayer does not change God, but it changes him who prays.\nI see it all perfectly; there are two possible situations \u2014 one can either do this or that. My honest opinion and my friendly advice is this: do it or do not do it \u2014 you will regret both.\nMarry, and you will regret it; don\u2019t marry, you will also regret it; marry or don\u2019t marry, you will regret it either way. Laugh at the world\u2019s foolishness, you will regret it; weep over it, you will regret that too; laugh at the world\u2019s foolishness or weep over it, you will regret both. Believe a woman, you will regret it; believe her not, you will also regret it\u2026 Hang yourself, you will regret it; do not hang yourself, and you will regret that too; hang yourself or don\u2019t hang yourself, you\u2019ll regret it either way; whether you hang yourself or do not hang yourself, you will regret both. This, gentlemen, is the essence of all philosophy.\nFaith is the highest passion in a human being. Many in every generation may not come that far, but none comes further.\nThe function of prayer is not to influence God, but rather to change the nature of the one who prays.\nOne must not think slightingly of the paradoxical; for the paradox is the source of the thinker's passion, and the thinker without a paradox is like a lover without feeling: a paltry mediocrity.", "source": "excerpts.txt"}
