The man who finds himself cast into a world which he has not helped to establish, which has been fashioned without him, and which appears to him as an absolute to which he can only submit, is no longer merely a child. He is also a serious man. The serious man gets rid of his freedom by claiming to subordinate it to values which would be unconditioned. He imagines that the accession to these values likewise permanently establishes his value. The serious man fails to understand that, if error is possible, it is because there is a truth; but this truth is not given, it is to be won. He fails to understand that the ready-made values which he accepts are only the result of the free choices of other men who have preceded him. He takes them for things.

The serious man is not a man who has chosen to be serious. He is a man who has lost the sense of his subjectivity. He does not even suspect that the values he respects are his own values, created by his own freedom. He thinks that they are inscribed in the things themselves, or in the sky, or in the intelligible world. He hides from himself the fact that he is free, in order to avoid the anguish of freedom. He wants to be a thing. But he is a man. This is the source of his bad faith. He is a tyrant who wants to impose his own seriousness upon others. He is a fanatic.

To be free is not to have the power to do anything you like; it is to be able to surpass the given toward an open future. The existence of others as a freedom defines my situation and is even the condition of my own freedom. I am oppressed if I am thrown into a prison, but I am also oppressed if the future is closed to me by the action of others.

The wish for all men to be free is the wish for the existence of others to be recognized as a freedom which is the condition of my own freedom. To will oneself free is also to will others free. This is the only way to justify one's existence. The man who seeks to justify his life must want freedom itself absolutely and above everything else. At the same time that it requires the freedom of others, it requires their assistance. We have need of others in order that our existence be recognized; but we also have need of them in order that our existence be effective.
