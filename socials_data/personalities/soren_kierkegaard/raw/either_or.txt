Either/Or: A Fragment of Life

Diapsalmata

What is a poet? An unhappy man who in his heart harbors a deep anguish, but whose lips are so fashioned that the sighs and cries which pass over them are transformed into ravishing music. His fate is like that of the unfortunate victims whom the tyrant Phalaris imprisoned in a brazen bull, and slowly tortured over a slow fire; their cries could not reach the tyrant's ears so as to strike terror into his heart; when they reached him they sounded like sweet music. And men crowd about the poet and say to him, "Sing for us soon again"—which is as much as to say, "May new sufferings torment your soul, but may your lips be fashioned as before; for the cries would only distress us, but the music is delicious." And the critics come, too, and say, "He writes according to the rules of aesthetics, and as a man of taste should." To be sure, a critic resembles a poet to a hair; he only lacks the anguish in his heart and the music upon his lips. lo, I tell you, I would rather be a swineherd, understood by the swine, than a poet misunderstood by men.

I do not care for anything. I do not care to ride, for the exercise is too violent. I do not care to walk, for it is too strenuous. I do not care to lie down, for I should either have to remain lying, and I do not care to do that, or I should have to get up again, and I do not care to do that either. Summa summarum: I do not care at all.

My life is like an eternal night; when will the day dawn? When will the cock crow? My soul is faint, for I have watched through the night. I have fought with the dark powers; I have conquered, but the victory was won at the cost of my life's happiness. I am like a man who has conquered a city but in the process has lost his own house.

People understand me so poorly that they don't even understand my complaint about them not understanding me.

If you marry, you will regret it; if you do not marry, you will also regret it; if you marry or do not marry, you will regret both; whether you marry or do not marry, you will regret both. Laugh at the world’s follies, you will regret it, weep over them, you will also regret that; laugh at the world’s follies or weep over them, you will regret both; whether you laugh at the world’s follies or weep over them, you will regret both. Believe a woman, you will regret it, believe her not, you will also regret that; believe a woman or believe her not, you will regret both; whether you believe a woman or believe her not, you will regret both. Hang yourself, you will regret it; do not hang yourself, and you will also regret that; hang yourself or do not hang yourself, you will regret both; whether you hang yourself or do not hang yourself, you will regret both. This, gentlemen, is the sum and substance of all philosophy.

The most beautiful time is the first period of falling in love, when from every encounter, every glance, one fetches home something new to rejoice over.

My soul is so heavy that thought can no longer sustain it, no more than the spider's web can sustain the weight of a stone.

I have the courage, I believe, to doubt everything; I have the courage, I believe, to fight with everything; but I have not the courage to know anything; not the courage to possess, to own anything. Most people complain that the world is so prosaic, that life is not like a romance, where opportunities for the most ideal happiness are offered. I complain that life is not like a romance where there are hard and fast conditions, where one has only to satisfy them in order to be happy. In a romance, if you kill the giant, you win the princess. In life, if you kill the giant, you are likely to be sued for damages, and if you win the princess, you find she has a mother who comes to live with you.

A fire broke out backstage in a theatre. The clown came out to warn the public; they thought it was a joke and applauded. He repeated it; the acclaim was even greater. I think that's just how the world will come to an end: to general applause from wits who believe it's a joke.
