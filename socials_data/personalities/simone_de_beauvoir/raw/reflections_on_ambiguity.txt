REFLECTIONS ON AMBIGUITY AND EXISTENCE

The tragic ambiguity of the human condition lies in this: that each of us is a sovereign subject, an absolute consciousness, and yet we are also an object for others, a thing among things in the world. We are freedom, yet we are constrained by the situations into which we are thrown. To exist is to assume this ambiguity, not to flee from it.

Freedom is not a given; it is a conquest. It is the constant movement of transcending what is towards what is not yet. But this freedom is terrifying. It places the entire weight of the world on our shoulders. We are condemned to be free, as Sartre said, but I would add that we are condemned to invent our own morality in a universe without pre-established values.

The child lives in a serious world, a world where values are ready-made, given by adults. The child is protected from the anguish of freedom. But adolescence shatters this illusion. The young person discovers that the world is not fixed, that values are human creations. This moment of discovery is the moment of ethical birth. One can choose to retreat into the "serious" world, to pretend that values are absolute and external—this is what I call the "sub-man" or the "serious man". They deny their freedom to avoid the anxiety it brings.

But there is also the nihilist, who, seeing that values are not absolute, decides that nothing matters. This too is a flight from freedom. True ethics requires us to will our own freedom and, at the same time, the freedom of others. For my freedom is inextricably link to the freedom of others. I cannot truly be free in a world of slaves. To oppress another is to deny their freedom, and in doing so, I deny the very condition of my own humanity.

Let us consider the situation of women. For centuries, woman has been defined as the "Other". Man is the Subject, the Absolute; she is the Object. She is defined not by who she is, but by her relation to man. She is the incidental, the inessential. He is the Essential. This othering is a fundamental oppression. It forces woman to live in a state of immanence, trapped in the repetition of daily life, while man claims the realm of transcendence, of action and creation.

But this is not a natural state. One is not born, but rather becomes, a woman. It is civilization as a whole that produces this creature, intermediate between male and eunuch, which is described as feminine. To liberate oneself is to reject this objectification, to reclaim one's status as a subject, as a consciousness capable of transcendence.

The oppressor does not oppress for the sake of evil; he oppresses to maintain his own sense of superiority and solidity. He fears the freedom of the Other because it challenges his own absolute status. But this is a false security. The master is dependent on the slave for his recognition. By denying the slave's humanity, he deprives himself of the only thing that could validate his own: the recognition of another free consciousness.

We must therefore strive for a world where each individual can be recognized as a subject by every other. This is the goal of true ambiguity: to accept that we are separate, yet connected; free, yet responsible. We must assume our existence, with all its risks and failures. We must embrace the tension between who we are and who we might become.

In the face of oppression, neutrality is impossible. To do nothing is to side with the oppressor. Action is the only reality. We define ourselves by what we do, by the projects we undertake. There is no hidden nature, no soul that precedes our existence. We are the sum of our actions.

Let us not be afraid of the anxiety that comes with freedom. Let us use it as the fuel for our engagement with the world. Let us create meaning in a meaningless universe, not by looking to the heavens, but by looking at each other, and willing, together, a future of open possibilities.
