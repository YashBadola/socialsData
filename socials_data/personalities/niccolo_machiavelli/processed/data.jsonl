{"text": "DISCOURSES ON THE FIRST DECADE OF TITUS LIVIUS\nby Niccolo Machiavelli\nBOOK I\nINTRODUCTION\nWith what difficulty a new way and method is established.\nAlthough the envious nature of men, so prompt to blame and so slow to praise, makes the discovery and introduction of any new principles and systems as dangerous almost as the exploration of unknown seas and continents, yet, animated by that desire which impels me to do what may prove for the common benefit of all, I have resolved to open a new route, which has not yet been followed by any one, and may prove difficult and troublesome, but may also bring me some reward in the approbation of those who will kindly appreciate my efforts.\nAnd if my poor talents, my little experience of the present and insufficient study of the past, should make the result of my labors defective and of little utility, I shall at least have shown the way to others, who, with more ability and eloquence, will more effectually achieve this new design; so that if I gain no merit from this enterprise, I ought at least not to incur any censure.\nWhen I consider the general respect for antiquity, and how often\u2014to say nothing of other examples\u2014a great price is paid for some fragments of an antique statue, which we are anxious to possess to ornament our houses with, or to give to artists who strive to imitate them in their own works; and when I see, on the other hand, the wonderful examples which the history of ancient kingdoms and republics presents to us, the prodigies of virtue and wisdom displayed by the kings, captains, citizens, and legislators who have sacrificed themselves for their country,\u2014when I see these, I say, more admired than imitated, or so much neglected that not the least trace of this ancient virtue remains, I cannot but be at the same time as much surprised as afflicted. And this is the more astonishing when I recall how much we respect the judgments of antiquity in our civil cases, which are but the decisions given by the ancient jurisconsults, and which, reduced to a system, direct our modern jurists in their decisions. And what is the science of medicine, but the experience of ancient physicians, which their successors have taken for their guide? And yet to found a republic, maintain states, to govern a kingdom, organize an army, conduct a war, dispense justice, and extend empires, you will find neither prince, nor republic, nor captain, nor citizen, who has recourse to the examples of antiquity! This neglect, I think, is due not so much to the weakness to which our education has reduced us, or to the evils that a proud indolence has produced in many Christian states, as to the want of a proper appreciation of history, which leads men to misunderstand the meaning of what they read, and to fail to draw from it the practical lessons it conveys. Hence it happens that the majority of those who read history take pleasure only in the variety of the events which history relates, without ever conceiving the idea of imitating the noble actions, deeming that not only difficult, but impossible; as though heaven, the sun, the elements, and men had changed the order of their motions and power, and were different from what they were in ancient times.\nWishing, then, to correct this error, I have thought it proper to write upon those books of Titus Livius that have come to us entire despite the malice of time; and in doing this I shall follow the natural order of facts, and compare ancient with modern events, and think proper to add such observations as will make the meaning of that historian more apparent. So that those who read these my Discourses may be able to derive from them that practical utility which should be the aim of all study of history. And although this enterprise is difficult, yet, with the help of those who have encouraged me in it, I hope to carry it to such a conclusion that but little may remain for others to do to bring it to its destined end.\nCHAPTER I.\nOf the beginning of cities in general, and especially that of the city of Rome.\nThose who read how the city of Rome had its beginning, and who established its laws and institutions, will not be surprised that so much virtue had been maintained there for so many centuries, and that it acquired such power and became so great an empire.\nIn discussing the origin of cities, we must distinguish between those that have been built by natives of the country, and those built by strangers.\nThe first case occurs when the inhabitants, dispersed in many small parties, find themselves insecure, not being able individually to protect themselves against the attacks of their enemies; and on the other hand not having time, when the enemy is upon them, to unite for their common defense, or being likely to lose their homes if they do so; they therefore resolve to unite, and for their better protection to settle in some place that offers greater conveniences for living, and can be more easily defended.\n...\nCHAPTER II.\nOf the different kinds of republics, and of what kind the Roman Republic was.\nI will leave aside what might be said of cities which from their very birth have been subject to a foreign power, and will speak only of those whose origin has been independent of any external authority, but which have governed themselves according to their own will, either as republics or as principalities; and as these had different origins, so they have had different laws and institutions. For to some, at the very beginning, or soon after, laws were given by some one man and all at one time, like those given by Lycurgus to the Spartans; while to others they were given at different times, as occasion required, as was the case with Rome. That republic, indeed, may be called happy which produces a man so prudent and sagacious that he may enact laws which, without need of alteration, may secure the security of those who live under them. Sparta, for instance, observed her laws for more than eight hundred years without changing them and without experiencing any dangerous disturbance. Unhappy, on the contrary, is that city which, not having had a wise legislator at the beginning, is obliged to reorganize itself; and unhappier still is that which has started wrong; and that may be said to have started wrong which has not based its laws and institutions upon such a foundation as to be able to secure liberty and power. A state of this kind can with difficulty be firmly established. Those, however, that have started without a perfect constitution, but have made a fair beginning, and are capable of improvement, may become perfect by the aid of events. It is true, however, that such reforms are never effected without danger, for the majority of men never willingly adopt any new law tending to change the constitution of the state, unless the necessity of the change is demonstrated by the actual state of things; and as such a necessity cannot make itself felt without being accompanied with danger, the republic may easily be destroyed before having perfected its constitution. That of Florence is a striking proof of this; reorganized after the revolt of Arezzo, in 1502, it was overthrown after the taking of Prato, in 1512.\n...\nI say, then, that all these six modes of government are defects, the three first being too temporary, and the three others being bad in themselves. The wise legislators, knowing these defects, refrained from adopting as such any one of these forms, and chose instead one that shared in them all, since they thought such a government would be stronger and more stable, for if in one and the same state there was principality, aristocracy, and democracy each would keep watch over the other.\nCHAPTER XI\nOF THE RELIGION OF THE ROMANS\nAlthough Rome had Romulus for her first founder, and as a daughter owed him her being and her nurture, yet the heavens, judging that the institutions of Romulus were not sufficient for so great an empire, inspired the Roman Senate to elect Numa Pompilius as his successor, so that the things omitted by Romulus might be supplied by Numa. He, finding a very savage people, and wishing to reduce them to civil obedience by the arts of peace, had recourse to religion as the most necessary and assured support of any civil society; and he established it upon such foundations that for many centuries there was nowhere more fear of the gods than in that republic, which greatly facilitated all the enterprises which the Senate or its great men attempted. Whoever examines the actions of the people of Rome as a body, or of many individual Romans, will see that they feared much more to break an oath than the laws; like men who esteem the power of the gods more than that of men.\n...\nAnd as the observance of divine worship is the cause of greatness in republics, so the neglect of it is the cause of their ruin. For where the fear of God is wanting, there the kingdom must either be ruined, or be sustained by the fear of a prince who supplies the defects of religion. And because princes are short-lived, it is most likely that the kingdom will fail as soon as the virtue of the prince fails.", "source": "discourses_livy.txt"}
{"text": "THE PRINCE\nby Nicolo Machiavelli\nTranslated by W. K. Marriott\nCHAPTER I\nHOW MANY KINDS OF PRINCIPALITIES THERE ARE, AND BY WHAT MEANS THEY ARE ACQUIRED\nAll states, all powers, that have held and hold rule over men have been and are either republics or principalities.\nPrincipalities are either hereditary, in which the family has been long established; or they are new.\nThe new are either entirely new, as was Milan to Francesco Sforza, or they are, as it were, members annexed to the hereditary state of the prince who has acquired them, as was the kingdom of Naples to the King of Spain.\nSuch dominions thus acquired are either accustomed to live under a prince, or to live in freedom; and are acquired either by the arms of the prince himself, or of others, or else by fortune or by ability.\nCHAPTER II\nCONCERNING HEREDITARY PRINCIPALITIES\nI will leave out all discussion on republics, inasmuch as in another place I have written of them at length, and will address myself only to principalities. In doing so I will keep to the order indicated above, and discuss how such principalities are to be ruled and preserved.\nI say at once there are fewer difficulties in holding hereditary states, and those long accustomed to the family of their prince, than new ones; for it is sufficient only not to transgress the customs of his ancestors, and to deal prudently with circumstances as they arise, for a prince of average powers to maintain himself in his state, unless he be deprived of it by some extraordinary and excessive force; and if he should be so deprived of it, whenever anything sinister happens to the usurper, he will regain it.\nWe have in Italy, for example, the Duke of Ferrara, who could not have withstood the attacks of the Venetians in '84, nor those of Pope Julius in '10, unless he had been long established in his dominions. For the hereditary prince has less cause and less necessity to offend; hence it happens that he will be more loved; and unless extraordinary vices cause him to be hated, it is reasonable to expect that his subjects will be naturally well disposed towards him; and in the antiquity and duration of his rule the memories and motives that make for change are lost, for one change always leaves the toothing for another.\nCHAPTER III\nCONCERNING MIXED PRINCIPALITIES\nBut the difficulties occur in a new principality. And firstly, if it be not entirely new, but is, as it were, a member of a state which, taken collectively, may be called mixed, the changes arise chiefly from an inherent difficulty which there is in all new principalities; for men change their masters willingly, hoping to better themselves; and this belief makes them take up arms against their ruler, in which they are deceived, as experience later proves that they have gone from bad to worse. This follows also on another natural and common necessity, which always causes a new prince to burden those who have submitted to him with his soldiery and with infinite other hardships which he must put upon his new acquisition.\nIn this way you have enemies in all those whom you have injured in seizing that principality, and you are not able to keep those friends who put you there because of your not being able to satisfy them in the way they expected, and you cannot take strong measures against them, feeling bound to them. For, although one may be very strong in armed forces, yet in entering a province one has always need of the goodwill of the natives.\nFor these reasons Louis the Twelfth, King of France, quickly occupied Milan, and as quickly lost it; and to turn him out the first time it only needed Lodovico's own forces; because those who had opened the gates to him, finding themselves deceived in their hopes of future benefit, would not endure the ill-treatment of the new prince. It is very true that, after acquiring rebellious provinces a second time, they are not so lightly lost afterwards, because the prince, with little reluctance, takes the opportunity of the rebellion to punish the delinquents, to clear out the suspects, and to strengthen himself in the weakest places. Thus to cause France to lose Milan the first time it was enough for the Duke Lodovico to raise insurrections on the borders; but to cause him to lose it a second time it was necessary to bring the whole world against him, and that his armies should be defeated and driven out of Italy; which followed from the causes above mentioned.\nNevertheless Milan was taken from him both the first and the second time. The general causes of the first we have discussed; it remains to name those of the second, and to see what resources he had, and what any one in his situation would have had for maintaining himself more securely in his acquisition than did the King of France.\nNow I say that those dominions which, when acquired, are annexed to an ancient state by the prince who acquires them, are either of the same country and language, or they are not. When they are, it is easier to hold them, especially when they have not been accustomed to self-government; and to hold them securely it is enough to have destroyed the family of the prince who was ruling them; because the two peoples, preserving in other things the old conditions, and not being unlike in customs, will live quietly together, as one has seen in Brittany, Burgundy, Gascony, and Normandy, which have been bound to France for so long a time; and, although there may be some difference in language, nevertheless the customs are alike, and the people will easily be able to get on amongst themselves. He who has annexed them, if he wishes to hold them, has only to bear in mind two considerations: the one, that the family of their former lord is extinguished; the other, that neither their laws nor their taxes are altered, so that in a very short time they will become entirely one body with the old principality.\nBut when states are acquired in a country differing in language, customs, or laws, there are difficulties, and good fortune and great energy are needed to hold them, and one of the greatest and most real helps would be that he who has acquired them should go and reside there. This would make his position more secure and durable, as it has made that of the Turk in Greece, who, notwithstanding all the other measures taken by him for holding that state, if he had not settled there, would not have been able to keep it. Because, if one is on the spot, disorders are seen as they spring up, and one can quickly remedy them; but if one is not at hand, they are heard of only when they are great, and then there is no remedy. Besides this, the country is not pillaged by your officials; the subjects are satisfied by prompt recourse to the prince; thus, wishing to be good, they have more cause to love him, and wishing to be otherwise, to fear him. He who would attack that state from the outside must have the utmost caution; as long as the prince resides there it can only be wrested from him with the greatest difficulty.\nCHAPTER XVII\nCONCERNING CRUELTY AND CLEMENCY, AND WHETHER IT IS BETTER TO BE LOVED THAN FEARED\nComing now to the other qualities mentioned above, I say that every prince ought to desire to be considered clement and not cruel. Nevertheless he ought to take care not to misuse this clemency. Cesare Borgia was considered cruel; notwithstanding, his cruelty reconciled the Romagna, unified it, and restored it to peace and loyalty. And if this be rightly considered, he will be seen to have been much more merciful than the Florentine people, who, to avoid a reputation for cruelty, permitted Pistoia to be destroyed. Therefore a prince, so long as he keeps his subjects united and loyal, ought not to mind the reproach of cruelty; because with a few examples he will be more merciful than those who, through too much mercy, allow disorders to arise, from which follow murders or robberies; for these are wont to injure the whole people, whilst those executions which originate with a prince offend the individual only.\nAnd of all princes, it is impossible for the new prince to avoid the imputation of cruelty, owing to new states being full of dangers. Hence Virgil, through the mouth of Dido, excuses the inhumanity of her reign owing to its being new, saying:\n\"Res dura, et regni novitas me talia cogunt Moliri, et late fines custode tueri.\"\nNevertheless he ought to be slow to believe and to act, nor should he himself show fear, but proceed in a temperate manner with prudence and humanity, so that too much confidence may not make him incautious and too much distrust render him intolerable.\nUpon this a question arises: whether it be better to be loved than feared or feared than loved? It may be answered that one should wish to be both, but, because it is difficult to unite them in one person, it is much safer to be feared than loved, when, of the two, either must be dispensed with. For this can be said of men in general: that they are ungrateful, fickle, false, cowardly, covetous, and as long as you succeed they are yours entirely; they will offer you their blood, property, life, and children, as is said above, when the need is far distant; but when it approaches they turn against you. And that prince who, relying entirely on their promises, has neglected other precautions, is ruined; because friendships that are obtained by payments, and not by greatness or nobility of mind, may indeed be earned, but they are not secured, and in time of need cannot be relied upon; and men have less scruple in offending one who is beloved than one who is feared, for love is preserved by the link of obligation which, owing to the baseness of men, is broken at every opportunity for their advantage; but fear preserves you by a dread of punishment which never fails.\nNevertheless a prince ought to inspire fear in such a way that, if he does not win love, he avoids hatred; because he can endure very well being feared whilst he is not hated, which will always be as long as he abstains from the property of his citizens and subjects and from their women. But when it is necessary for him to proceed against the life of someone, he must do it on proper justification and for manifest cause, but above all things he must keep his hands off the property of others, because men more quickly forget the death of their father than the loss of their patrimony. Besides, pretexts for taking away the property are never wanting; for he who has once begun to live by robbery will always find pretexts for seizing what belongs to others; but reasons for taking life, on the contrary, are more difficult to find and sooner lapse. But when a prince is with his army, and has under control a multitude of soldiers, then it is quite necessary for him to disregard the reputation of cruelty, for without it he would never hold his army united or disposed to its duties.\nCHAPTER XVIII\nCONCERNING THE WAY IN WHICH PRINCES SHOULD KEEP FAITH\nEvery one admits how praiseworthy it is in a prince to keep faith, and to live with integrity and not with craft. Nevertheless our experience has been that those princes who have done great things have held good faith of little account, and have known how to circumvent the intellect of men by craft, and in the end have overcome those who have relied on their word.\nYou must know there are two ways of contesting, the one by the law, the other by force; the first method is proper to men, the second to beasts; but because the first is frequently not sufficient, it is necessary to have recourse to the second. Therefore it is necessary for a prince to understand how to avail himself of the beast and the man. This has been figuratively taught to princes by ancient writers, who describe how Achilles and many other princes of old were given to the Centaur Chiron to nurse, who brought them up in his discipline; which means solely that, as they had for a teacher one who was half beast and half man, so it is necessary for a prince to know how to make use of both natures, and that one without the other is not durable. A prince, therefore, being compelled knowingly to adopt the beast, ought to choose the fox and the lion; because the lion cannot defend himself against snares and the fox cannot defend himself against wolves. Therefore, it is necessary to be a fox to discover the snares and a lion to terrify the wolves. Those who rely simply on the lion do not understand what they are about. Therefore a wise lord cannot, nor ought he to, keep faith when such observance may be turned against him, and when the reasons that caused him to pledge it exist no longer. If men were entirely good this precept would not be hold, but because they are bad, and will not keep faith with you, you too are not bound to observe it with them. Nor will there ever be wanting to a prince legitimate reasons to excuse this non-observance. Of this endless modern examples could be given, showing how many treaties and engagements have been made void and of no effect through the faithlessness of princes; and he who has known best how to employ the fox has succeeded best.\nBut it is necessary to know well how to disguise this characteristic, and to be a great pretender and dissembler; and men are so simple, and so subject to present necessities, that he who seeks to deceive will always find someone who will allow himself to be deceived. One recent example I cannot pass over in silence. Alexander the Sixth did nothing else but deceive men, nor ever thought of doing otherwise, and he always found victims; for there never was a man who had greater power in asserting, or who with greater oaths would affirm a thing, yet would observe it less; nevertheless his deceits always succeeded according to his wishes, because he well understood this side of mankind.\nTherefore it is unnecessary for a prince to have all the good qualities I have enumerated, but it is very necessary to appear to have them. And I shall dare to say this also, that to have them and always to observe them is injurious, and that to appear to have them is useful; to appear merciful, faithful, humane, religious, upright, and to be so, but with a mind so framed that should you require not to be so, you may be able and know how to change to the opposite.\nAnd you have to understand this, that a prince, especially a new one, cannot observe all those things for which men are esteemed, being often forced, in order to maintain the state, to act contrary to fidelity, friendship, humanity, and religion. Therefore it is necessary for him to have a mind ready to turn itself accordingly as the winds and variations of fortune force it, yet, as I have said above, not to diverge from the good if he can avoid doing so, but, if compelled, then to know how to set about it.\nFor this reason a prince ought to take care that he never lets anything slip from his lips that is not replete with the above-named five qualities, that he may appear to him who sees and hears him altogether merciful, faithful, humane, upright, and religious. There is nothing more necessary to appear to have than this last quality, inasmuch as men judge generally more by the eye than by the hand, because it belongs to everybody to see you, to few to come in touch with you. Everyone sees what you appear to be, few really know what you are, and those few dare not oppose themselves to the opinion of the many, who have the majesty of the state to defend them; and in the actions of all men, and especially of princes, which it is not prudent to challenge, one judges by the result.\nFor that reason, let a prince have the credit of conquering and holding his state, the means will always be considered honest, and he will be praised by everybody; because the vulgar are always taken by what a thing seems to be and by what comes of it; and in the world there are only the vulgar, for the few find a place there only when the many have no ground to rest on. One prince of the present time, whom it is not well to name, never preaches anything else but peace and good faith, and to both he is most hostile, and either, if he had kept it, would have deprived him of reputation and kingdom many a time.", "source": "the_prince.txt"}
