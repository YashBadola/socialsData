The man who finds himself cast into the world of seriousness feels that he is a part of the world, but he feels it as a thing. He is a stone among stones, a tree among trees, an animal among animals. He is not a man among men. He is not free. He is not responsible. He is not a subject. He is an object. He is a thing.
But the man who discovers his freedom, who recognizes that he is a subject, that he is a project, that he is a transcendence, this man discovers that he is not a thing, but that he is a nothingness. He discovers that he is not a solid object, but a void. He discovers that he is not a being, but a lack of being.
To be free is not to have the power to do anything you like; it is to be able to surpass the given toward an open future. The existence of others as a freedom defines my situation and is even the condition of my own freedom. I am oppressed if I am thrown into prison, but not if I am kept from throwing my neighbor into prison.
The wish for being is one of the most fundamental trends of human reality; but the wish to be God is the wish to be the foundation of the world and of oneself; it is the wish to be the In-itself-for-itself.
Life is occupied in both perpetuating itself and in surpassing itself; if all it does is maintain itself, then living is only not dying.
