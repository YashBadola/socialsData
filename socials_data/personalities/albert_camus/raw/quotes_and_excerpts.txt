The gods had condemned Sisyphus to ceaselessly rolling a rock to the top of a mountain, whence the stone would fall back of its own weight. They had thought with some reason that there is no more dreadful punishment than futile and hopeless labor.

If one admits that the significant aspect of this myth is the importance it gives to the absurd, then one understands that Sisyphus is the absurd hero. He is, as much through his passions as through his torture. His scorn of the gods, his hatred of death, and his passion for life won him that unspeakable penalty in which the whole being is exerted toward accomplishing nothing. This is the price that must be paid for the passions of this earth.

But Sisyphus teaches the higher fidelity that negates the gods and raises rocks. He too concludes that all is well. This universe henceforth without a master seems to him neither sterile nor futile. Each atom of that stone, each mineral flake of that night-filled mountain, in itself forms a world. The struggle itself toward the heights is enough to fill a man's heart. One must imagine Sisyphus happy.

In the midst of winter, I found there was, within me, an invincible summer.

Mother died today. Or maybe yesterday; I can't be sure.

The only way to deal with an unfree world is to become so absolutely free that your very existence is an act of rebellion.

Man is the only creature who refuses to be what he is.

I rebel; therefore we exist.

Don't walk in front of me… I may not follow
Don't walk behind me… I may not lead
Walk beside me… just be my friend

You will never be happy if you continue to search for what happiness consists of. You will never live if you are looking for the meaning of life.

Real generosity toward the future lies in giving all to the present.

There is but one truly serious philosophical problem, and that is suicide. Judging whether life is or is not worth living amounts to answering the fundamental question of philosophy.

The realization that life is absurd cannot be an end, but only a beginning.

To create is to live twice.

Freedom is nothing but a chance to be better.

Those who lack the courage will always find a philosophy to justify it.
