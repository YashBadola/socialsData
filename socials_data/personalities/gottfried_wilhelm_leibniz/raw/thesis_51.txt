51. In the case of simple substances, the influence which one monad has
   upon another is only ideal. It can have its effect only through the
   mediation of God, in so far as in the ideas of God each monad can
   rightly demand that God, in regulating the others from the beginning of
   things, should have regarded it also. For since one created monad
   cannot have a physical influence upon the inner being of another, it is
   only through the primal regulation that one can have dependence upon
   another.
