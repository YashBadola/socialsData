So another person cannot understand the language. But justification consists in appealing to something independent. 'I'd like to say' is not the same as 'I say'."}
{"instruction": "What is the aim of philosophy?", "response": "The object of philosophy is the logical clarification of thoughts. Philosophy is not a theory but an activity. It seeks to show the fly the way out of the fly-bottle."}
