{"text": "The crowd is untruth. There is therefore no one who has more contempt for what it is to be a human being than those who make it their profession to lead the crowd.\nAnxiety is the dizziness of freedom.\nLife can only be understood backwards; but it must be lived forwards.\nThe most common form of despair is not being who you are.\nPeople demand freedom of speech as a compensation for the freedom of thought which they seldom use.\nThere are two ways to be fooled. One is to believe what isn't true; the other is to refuse to believe what is true.\nFace the facts of being what you are, for that is what changes what you are.\nTo dare is to lose one's footing momentarily. Not to dare is to lose oneself.\nIt is perfectly true, as philosophers say, that life must be understood backwards. But they forget the other proposition, that it must be lived forwards.\nI see it all perfectly; there are two possible situations \u2014 one can either do this or that. My honest opinion and my friendly advice is this: do it or do not do it \u2014 you will regret both.\nIf you marry, you will regret it; if you do not marry, you will also regret it; if you marry or do not marry, you will regret both; whether you marry or do not marry, you will regret both. Laugh at the world\u2019s follies, you will regret it, weep over them, you will also regret that; laugh at the world\u2019s follies or weep over them, you will regret both; whether you laugh at the world\u2019s follies or weep over them, you will regret both. Believe a woman, you will regret it, believe her not, you will also regret that; believe a woman or believe her not, you will regret both; whether you believe a woman or believe her not, you will regret both. Hang yourself, you will regret it; do not hang yourself, and you will also regret that; hang yourself or do not hang yourself, you will regret both; whether you hang yourself or do not hang yourself, you will regret both. This, gentlemen, is the sum and substance of all philosophy.", "source": "quotes_and_excerpts.txt"}
