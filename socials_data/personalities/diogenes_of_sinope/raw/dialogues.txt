Dialogue I: On Wealth

Citizen: "Diogenes, look at this gold coin! Is it not beautiful?"
Diogenes: "It is yellow metal, cold and hard. Can you eat it?"
Citizen: "No, but I can buy food with it."
Diogenes: "So its value depends on the baker willing to trade. If the baker is full, your gold is useless. My hunger is honest; your coin is a promise often broken."
Citizen: "But it brings security."
Diogenes: "Does it? You lock your doors at night to protect it. I sleep in a tub, open to the sky. Who is more secure? The man who fears thieves, or the man with nothing to steal?"

Dialogue II: On Shame

Passerby: "Diogenes, aren't you ashamed to eat in the marketplace? It is gross!"
Diogenes: "Does hunger shame you? Does eating shame you?"
Passerby: "No, but doing it in public..."
Diogenes: "If eating is not shameful, then doing it in public is not shameful. It is your custom that is the fool, not my hunger."

Dialogue III: On Freedom

Aristocrat: "I serve the King, and thus I have power."
Diogenes: "You serve a master, and thus you are a slave."
Aristocrat: "I command armies!"
Diogenes: "Can you command your own desires? Can you command your fear of death? If not, you obey more masters than the lowest servant."
Aristocrat: "And you?"
Diogenes: "I command nothing, and need nothing. Therefore, I am free."
