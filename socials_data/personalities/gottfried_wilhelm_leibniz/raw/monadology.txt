THE MONADOLOGY

1. The Monad, of which we shall here speak, is nothing but a simple substance, which enters into composites; simple, that is to say, without parts.

2. And there must be simple substances, since there are composites; for a composite is nothing else than a collection or aggregatum of simple substances.

3. Now, where there are no parts, there can be neither extension nor figure nor divisibility. These Monads are the real atoms of nature and in a word, the elements of things.

4. No dissolution of these elements need be feared, and there is no conceivable way in which a simple substance can be destroyed by natural means.

5. For the same reason there is no conceivable way in which a simple substance can come into existence by natural means, since it cannot be formed by the combination of parts (composition).

6. Thus it may be said that a Monad can only come into existence or end at once; that is to say, it can come into existence only by creation and end only by annihilation, while that which is composite has a beginning or an end through parts.

7. There is also no way of explaining how a Monad can be altered in its inner nature by any other created thing; since there is no possibility of transposition within it, nor can we conceive of any internal movement which can be excited, directed, augmented or diminished within it, as can occur in composites where there are changes among the parts. The Monads have no windows, through which anything could come in or go out. Accidents cannot detach themselves nor go about outside of substances, as was formerly done with the sensible species of the Scholastics. Thus neither substance nor accident can enter a Monad from without.

8. Yet the Monads must have some qualities, otherwise they would not even be existing things. And if simple substances did not differ by their qualities, there would be no means of perceiving any change in things; for what is in the composite can come only from the simple ingredients, and the Monads being without qualities, they would be indistinguishable from one another, since they do not differ in quantity. And consequently, nature being a plenum, each place would always receive only the equivalent of what it had had before, and one state of things would be indistinguishable from another.

9. Each Monad must be different from every other. For in nature there are never two beings which are perfectly alike and in which it is not possible to find an internal difference, or at least a difference founded upon an intrinsic quality (denomination).

10. I assume also as admitted that every created being, and consequently the created Monad, is subject to change, and further that this change is continuous in each.

11. It follows from what has just been said, that the natural changes of the Monads come from an internal principle, since an external cause can have no influence upon their inner being.

12. But, besides the principle of the change, there must be a detail of that which changes, which constitutes, so to speak, the specific nature and variety of the simple substances.

13. This detail should involve a multitude in the unit or simple substance. For as every natural change takes place by degrees, something changes and something remains; and consequently there must be in the simple substance a plurality of affections and relations, although there are no parts.

14. The passing condition, which involves and represents a multitude in the unit or in the simple substance, is nothing but what is called Perception, which is to be distinguished from Apperception or Consciousness, as will appear in what follows. In this matter the Cartesian view is extremely defective, for it treats as non-existent those perceptions of which we are not consciously aware. This has also led them to believe that minds alone are Monads, and that there are no souls of animals nor other Entelechies.

15. The action of the internal principle which causes the change or the passage from one perception to another, may be called Appetition; it is true that appetite cannot always fully attain to the whole perception at which it aims, but it always obtains some of it and reaches new perceptions.
