DIAPSAMATA
(Ad se ipsum)

What is a poet? An unhappy man who in his heart harbors a deep anguish,
but whose lips are so fashioned that the moans and cries which pass
over them are transformed into ravishing music. His fate is like that
of the sufferers in the bull of Phalaris, who were not silenced by the
tyrant's slow fire, but whose screams could not reach the tyrant's ears
to terrify him; for they sounded like sweet music to the people.

I have the courage, I believe, to doubt everything; I have the courage, I
believe, to fight with everything; but I have not the courage to know
anything; not the courage to possess, to own anything. Most people
complain that the world is so prosaic, that life is not like a romance,
where opportunities are always so favorable. I complain that life is
not like a romance, where one has hard-hearted parents and ogres and
trolls to fight, and enchanted princesses to free. What are all such
enemies taken together, compared with the pale, bloodless, tenacious,
nocturnal shapes with which I fight and to which I give life and
being--myself?

The Rotation of Crops

People with a great deal of experience in life are inclined to speak of
boredom as the root of all evil. It might be more correct to say that
boredom is the root of all evil, and that the history of the world
proves it. The gods were bored, and so they created man. Adam was bored
because he was alone, and so Eve was created. Thus boredom entered the
world, and increased in proportion to the increase of population. Adam
was bored alone; then Adam and Eve were bored together; then Adam and
Eve and Cain and Abel were bored _en famille_; then the population of
the world increased, and the peoples were bored _en masse_. To divert
themselves they conceived the idea of constructing a tower high enough
to reach the heavens. This idea is itself as boring as the tower was
high, and constitutes a terrible proof of how boredom had gained the
upper hand.
