The Knight of Faith

If I were to describe the movements of the knight of faith, I should say as follows: The knight of faith plays the part of the finite entirely, and yet the infinite is by no means foreign to him. He makes the movements of infinity with such correctness and assurance that he might at any moment be mistaken for a philistine. He takes delight in everything he sees, in the human swarm, in the new omnibuses, in the water of the Sound. He is interested in everything; he behaves exactly like the rest of us. He has a job, he plants a garden, he takes a walk.

But watch him closely. He makes the movement of infinity, but he does it with such ease and grace that one does not suspect it. He has resigned everything infinitely, and then he has grasped everything again by virtue of the absurd. He lives in the finite as if he had never known the infinite, but he carries the infinite within him.

The ethical expression for what Abraham did is that he would murder Isaac; the religious expression is that he would sacrifice Isaac; but precisely in this contradiction lies the dread which can well make a man sleepless, and yet Abraham is not what he is without this dread.

There is a teleological suspension of the ethical. The ethical is the universal, and as such it applies to everyone. But faith is precisely this paradox, that the single individual is higher than the universal. If this is not the case, then Abraham is lost, and faith has never existed.
