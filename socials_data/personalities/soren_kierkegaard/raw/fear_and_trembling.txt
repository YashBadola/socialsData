Preface

Not only in the commercial world, but also in the world of ideas, our age is putting on a big clearance sale. Everything can be had so dirt cheap that one begins to wonder whether in the end anyone will want to make a bid. Every speculative price-fixer who conscientiously directs attention to the significant march of modern philosophy, every privatdocent, tutor, and student, every crofter and cottar in philosophy, is not stopping to doubt everything but goes further. Perhaps it would be premature and untimely to ask them where they are going, but surely it is pardonable and polite to assume that they have doubted everything, since otherwise it would be queer of them to go further. This proceeding of theirs, then, they have all performed with such ease that they do not think the least bit about it.

Problem I: Is there a Teleological Suspension of the Ethical?

The ethical as such is the universal, and as the universal it applies to everyone, which may be expressed from another point of view by saying that it applies every instant. It rests immanent in itself, has nothing without itself which is its telos, but is itself telos for everything outside it, and when this has been incorporated by it it can go no further. Conceived immediately as physical and psychical, the particular individual is the individual who has his telos in the universal, and his ethical task is to express himself constantly in it, to abolish his particularity in order to become the universal. As soon as the individual would assert himself as the particular over against the universal, he sins, and only by recognizing this can he again reconcile himself with the universal. Every time the individual after he has entered the universal feels an impulse to assert himself as the particular, he is in temptation (Anfechtung), and he can labor himself out of this only by abandoning himself as the particular in the universal. If this be the highest thing that can be said of man and of his existence, then the ethical has the same nature as man’s eternal blessedness, which to all eternity and at every instant is his telos, since it would be a contradiction to say that this might be abandoned (i.e. teleologically suspended), seeing that as soon as it is suspended it is forfeited, whereas in other cases what is suspended is not forfeited but is preserved in the higher sphere which is its telos.

If such be the case, then Hegel is right when in his Logic he characterizes “the Good” and “Conscience” as “the Moral Forms of Evil” (cf. especially The Philosophy of Right), and he is right in characterizing faith as this form of evil—but in that case he is wrong in not characterizing faith as a temptation (Anfechtung), or in characterizing it as that, but at the same time saying nothing about how he has overcome it.

Faith is precisely this paradox, that the individual as the particular is higher than the universal, is justified over against it, is not subordinate but superior—yet in such a way, be it observed, that it is the particular individual who, after he has been subordinated as the particular to the universal, now through the universal becomes the individual who as the particular is superior to the universal, for the fact that the individual as the particular stands in an absolute relation to the absolute. This position cannot be mediated, for all mediation comes about precisely by virtue of the universal; it is and remains to all eternity a paradox, inaccessible to thought. And yet faith is this paradox—or else (these are the logical deductions which I would beg the reader to have in mente at every point, though it would be too prolix for me to reiterate them on every occasion)—or else there never has been faith...

The story of Abraham contains therefore a teleological suspension of the ethical. As the individual he became higher than the universal. This is the paradox which does not permit of mediation. It is just as inexplicable how he got into it as it is inexplicable how he remained in it. If such is not the position of Abraham, then he is not even a tragic hero but a murderer. To want to continue to call him the father of faith, to talk of this to people who do not concern themselves with anything but words, is thoughtless. A man can become a tragic hero by his own powers—but not a knight of faith. When a man enters upon the way, in a certain sense the hard way of the tragic hero, many will be able to give him counsel; to him who follows the narrow way of faith no one can give counsel, him no one can understand. Faith is a miracle, and yet no man is excluded from it; for that in which all human life is unified is passion, and faith is a passion.
