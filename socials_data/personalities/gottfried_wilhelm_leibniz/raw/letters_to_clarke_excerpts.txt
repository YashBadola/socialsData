I have remarked that in the things of God there is no choice without a reason; and that this is a consequence of his supreme wisdom. Mr. Clarke grants me this principle, but he wishes to maintain that God's mere will is a sufficient reason. But this is to revert to the indifference of equilibrium, which I have refuted.

If space were an absolute reality, far from being a property, it would be greater than God himself, since it is infinite and eternal and independent of God. But space is nothing but the order of existence of things possible, as time is the order of existence of things inconsistent. Space denotes, in terms of possibility, an order of things which exist at the same time, considered as existing together; without enquiring into their manner of existing. And when many things are seen together, one perceives that order of things among themselves.

Mr. Clarke maintains that space is the sensorium of God. But God does not need a sense organ to perceive things. He perceives them by his own essence, because he is the cause of them.

If the world were finite, God could have made it larger; and if he could have made it larger, why did he not? To say that he could not is to limit his power. To say that he did not wish to is to limit his goodness, unless one can show a reason derived from the nature of things why a finite world is better than an infinite one.

There is no vacuum in nature. A vacuum would be a sterility, a defect. God has filled every part of space with matter, for the more matter there is, the more opportunity there is for God to exercise his wisdom and power; and strictly speaking, there is no empty space, for matter is everywhere.

As for the attraction of bodies, which Mr. Newton calls gravitation, if it is an action at a distance without a medium, it is a miracle. For it is impossible to conceive how a body can act upon another where it is not.
