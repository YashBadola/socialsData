{"text": "Human Rights and Its Discontents\nBy Slavoj Zizek\nLet me go directly to the point: It is a well known fact that the\nclose-the-door button in most elevators is a totally dysfunctional\nplacebo which is placed there just to give individuals the impression\nthat they are somehow participating, contributing to the speed of the\nelevator journey. When we push this button the door closes in exactly\nthe same time as when we just press the floor button without speeding\nup the process by pressing also the close-the-door button. This extreme\nand clear case of fake participation is, I claim, an appropriate\nmetaphor (for) the participation of individuals in our post-modern\npolitical process. We are all the time asked by politicians to press\nsuch buttons. But some things are excluded. What is excluded from this\nparticipatory, multi-culturalist, tolerant democracy?\nIn today's predominant ideological perception, I'm tempted to claim\nwork itself - that is to say manual labor as opposed to so-called\nsymbolic activity - work, not sex is more and more becoming the site of\nobscene indecency to be concealed from the public eye. The tradition\nwhich goes back to Wagner's opera, Rhinegold, or to Fritz Lang's film,\nMetropolis, the tradition in which the working process takes place\nunderground, in dark caves, today culminates in the millions of\nanonymous workers sweating in the Third World factories, from Chinese\ngulags to Indonesian assembly lines. In their invisibility the West can\nafford itself to babble about the so-called disappearing working class.\nOf course, it's disappearing from here.\nBut what is crucial in this tradition is the equation of labor with\ncrime, the idea that labor, hard work, is originally an indecent\ncriminal activity to be hidden from the public eye. Significantly, we\nask ourselves a simple question: Where in Hollywood films do we see\nstill today the production process in all its intensity? I claim, as\nfar as I remember, and you can correct me if I'm wrong, only at one\nplace: in James Bond or similar films when the good guy, James Bond the\nagent, penetrates the fortress of the master criminal. And then you see\nit's either the drug processing or putting together of some lethal\nweapon. That's the only place where you see the production process. Of\ncourse, the function of the agent is then to explode, to destroy, to\nrepress again this sight of production.\nThis, I think, is the necessary background if we want to approach\nproperly the problematic of human rights today. So how are we to\napproach this problematic? I want to do something which may be a\nsurprise to some of you. It's no irony intended. I think the Christian\nlegacy is all too precious to be left to, well, Christians themselves.\nSo what I want to do is, in the first part of my talk, to propose a\ncertain reading of Christianity, aiming to demonstrate how Christianity\neffectively provides the foundation to human rights and freedoms.\nTo put it in a somewhat simplified way - I simplify it very much, I\nknow - there are two basic attitudes discernible in the history of\nreligions along the axis of the opposition between the global and the\nuniversal: On the one hand, there is the pre-Christian pagan cosmos,\nthe divine hierarchical order of cosmic principles which, when copied\non the society, gives the image of a congruent edifice in which each\nmember is at each/his/her own place. The supreme good is here the\nglobal balance of principles, while the evil stands for their\nderailment or derangement, for the excessive assertion of one principle\nto the detriment of other principles, of the masculine principle to the\ndetriment of the feminine one, of reason to the detriment of feeling,\nand so on and so on. The cosmic balance is then reestablished through\nthe work of justice which, with its inexorable necessity, sets things\nstraight again by crushing the derailed element. With regard to the\nsocial body, an individual is good when he or she acts in accordance\nwith his/her special place within the social edifice, when he respects\nnature which provides food and shelter, when he respects his\nsuperiors who take care of him in a fatherly way, and so on and so on.\nAnd evil occurs when some particular strata or individuals are no\nlonger satisfied with their proper place within the global order, when\nchildren no longer obey parents, when servants no longer obey their\nmasters, when the wise ruler turns into a capricious, cruel tyrant, and\nso on.\nSo the very core of the pagan wisdom resides in the insight into this\ncosmic balance of hierarchically ordered principles, more precisely,\nthe insight into the eternal circuit of the cosmic catastrophe,\nderailment, and the restoration of order through just punishment.\nPerhaps the most elaborated case of such a cosmic order is the ancient\nHindu cosmology first copied onto the social order in the guise of the\nsystem of castes, and then onto the individual organism itself in the\nguise of the harmonious hierarchy of its organs: head, hands, abdomen,\nand so on. Today such an attitude is artificially resuscitated in the\nmultitude of New Age approaches to nature, society, and so on and so\non. So that's the standard, traditional, pagan order. Again, being good\nmeans that you fully assume your proper place within some global order.\nBut Christianity, and in its own way already - maybe, I'm not sure, I\ndon't know enough about it - Buddhism, introduce into this global\nbalance, cosmic order, a principle totally foreign to it, a principle\nthat, measured by the standards of the pagan cosmology, cannot but\nappear as a monstrous distortion, the principle according to which each\nindividual has an immediate access to the universality of nirvana, or\nthe Holy Spirit, or today, of human rights and freedoms. The idea is\nthat I can participate in this universal dimension directly,\nirrespective of my specific particular place within the global order.\nFor that reason, Buddha's followers form a community of people who in\none way or another have broken with the hierarchy of the social order,\nwho started to treat this order as something fundamentally irrelevant.\nIn his choice of disciples, Buddha pointedly ignored castes and, after\nsome hesitation, true, even sexual difference. And do Christ's\nscandalous words from Luke (14:26) look, not point, in the same\ndirection? \"If anyone comes to me and does not hate his father and his\nmother, his wife and children, his brothers and sisters, yes, even his\nown life, he cannot be my disciple.\" Here, of course, I claim we are\nnot dealing with a simple brutal hatred demanded by a cruel and jealous\ngod. Family relations stand here metaphorically for the entire social\nnetwork, for any particular ethnic substance that determines my place\nin the global order of things. The hatred enjoined by Christ is\ntherefore not any kind of dialectical opposite of love, but the direct\nexpression of love. It is love itself that enjoins me to unplug, as it\nwere, from my organic community into which I was born, or, as St. Paul\nput it, \"There are neither men nor women, neither Jews nor Greeks.\"\nWe can see here how truly heterogeneous is the Christian stance with\nregard to that of the pagan wisdom. In clear contrast to the ultimate\nhorizon of the pagan wisdom, which is the coincidence of the opposites\n- Namely, what is wisdom? The ultimate point of wisdom is that our\nuniverse is the abyss of the primordial ground in which all false\nopposites - good and evil, appearance and reality, and so on and so on\n- ultimately coincide. That's wisdom. Wisdom always is basically a fake\nplatitude, I claim. You can be sure of it. Make a simple experiment. I\nthink the proper attitude of a proper Christian or leftist today is to\ndespise wisdom. What's wisdom? What's wisdom? Wisdom is that whatever\nhappens you have a good excuse. Wisdom means you do something. If you\nsucceed, then you have a proverb which is a form of wisdom to\nlegitimize it, like we in Europe have a proverb, a standard one which\nsays, Only those who risk can succeed. If you fail we have another\nproverb to legitimize it which says in very vulgar terms - something, I\ndon't have it in English - You cannot urinate against the wind. That's\nwisdom for me. Anything goes basically. The basic wisdom is that\ndifferences don't matter, what was up comes down, this eternal\ncirculation of fortune, and so on and so on.\nBut in clear contrast to this logic, Christianity asserts as the\nhighest act precisely what the pagan wisdom condemns as the source of\nevil: the gesture of separation, of drawing the line, of clinging to an\nelement which precisely disturbs the balance of all. The pagan reproach\nthat the Christian insight is not deep enough, that it fails to grasp\nthe primordial One-All, this primordial abyss, primordial void, thus\nmisses the point. Christianity is a miraculous event that disturbs the\nbalance of the One-All. It is the violent intrusion of difference which\nthrows off the rails the balanced circuit of the universe. From this\nstandpoint it would be interesting to approach the ideological\nambiguities of a very bad movie, George Lucas's Star Wars I: The\nPhantom Menace. The film, one of whose few interests resides in the way\nit endeavors to outline the answer to the question of the origin of\nevil, How did Darth Vader become Darth Vader? That is to say, How died\nAnakin Skywalker, this sweet boy, turn into the monstrous instrument of\ncosmic evil? Two things are here crucial: First, the Christological\nfeatures of the young Anakin. If you know the movie you know that his\nmother hints that she became pregnant with him in an immaculate\nconception. Then we have the ways in which Anakin wins. It clearly\nechoes the famous chariot race in Ben Hur, this tale of Christ. Second,\nthe fact that he's identified as the one who has the potential to\nrestore the balance of the Force. Now, here's my question: Since the\nideological universe of Star Wars is the New Age pagan universe, it is\nquite consequent that its central figure of evil should echo Christ.\nWithin the pagan horizon the event of Christ is the ultimate scandal.\nFurthermore, what if we take the premonition that Anakin will restore\nthe balance of the Force, not as the faithful misapprehension, but as a\ncorrect insight? What if the suffocating character of the pagan\nuniverse resides precisely in the fact that in this universe the\ndimension of radical evil, that in it the balance was way too much in\nfavor of the good? So I think that that's the solution, that precisely\nin this sense Anakin restores the balance. It is in order to emphasize\nthis suspension of social hierarchy that Christ addresses in an\naccentuated way those who belong to the very bottom of the social\nhierarchy, the outcasts of the social order - beggars, prostitutes - as\nthe privileged members of his new community. This new community is then\nexplicitly constructed as a collective of outcasts, the antipode to any\nestablished organic group. Perhaps the best way to imagine such a\ncommunity is to look at it in the lineage of other eccentric\ncommunities of outcasts that we know from past and present, from lepers\nand circus freaks to early computer hackers, groups in which the\nstigmatized individuals are united by a secret bond of solidarity. In\norder to specify further these two communities I'm tempted to risk the\nreference to Freud himself who, in his crowd psychology, provides two\nexamples of crowd formation as we all know: the Church and the army.\nNow usually one takes these two crowd formations as equivalent without\nconsidering the difference between the two. However, what if this\ndifference is crucial, along the lines of (I'm referring here to)\nErnesto Laclau, who developed the opposition between the structure of\ndifferences, the differentiated structure, and the antagonistic logic\nof equivalencies - us against them. The Church is global, a structured\ninstitution and(?) network of hierarchically differentiated positions,\nbasically ecumenical, tolerant, prone to compromises, all-inclusive,\ndividing the profits among the sub-groups; while in the army the accent\nis on the antagonism, on us versus them, and on the egalitarian\nuniversalism. All of us are ultimately equal when confronted with them,\nthe enemy. So that the army is ultimately exclusionary, prone to\nannihilate the other. Of course this is an abstract proposition;\nempirically the line can be blurred. We often have the militant Church\nor the army that functions as a Church-like corporate social\ninstitution.\nBut the fundamental paradox is that the two communities, again, often\nexchange their places. There is a Church who is close to antagonistic\nfunctioning of the army or vice versa. What I claim is that this\nopposition is actual even today in the field where I'm active, for\nexample, in the relationship between (the) International Psychoanalytic\nAssociation, the orthodox one and the Lacanian movement. The IPA is the\npsychoanalytic church, excommunicating people from its ranks only when\nit feels effectively threatened, prone to endless debates, compromises,\nand so on and so on. I claim that we Lacanians are, on the contrary,\nthe psychoanalytic army, a combative group working towards an\naggressive re-conquest defined by the antagonism between us and them,\navoiding, rejecting even the tolerant olive branch of the IPA: Come\nback, we accept you only if you also make a compromise and change\nslightly the form of your activity. So with regard to political\nstruggles, the Freudian formula, Where it was I shall come into being,\ncan thus be read as, Where the church was there, the army should\narrive.\nHowever, does Christianity not go even a further step and enjoin us,\nnot simply to hate parents on behalf of the Beloved One, but in the\ndialectical inversion of love for one's enemy, to hate the Beloved out\nof love and in love, as Kierkegaard put it? The proper way to\nunderstand this is to ask a precise question: What dimension in the\nBeloved Other am I enjoined to hate? Let me take hatred towards one's\nfather in the Oedipal family tension. As we see all the time, this\nhatred disappears and new understanding for the father emerges the\nmoment the son effectively gets rid of the shadow of paternal\nauthority. In short, hatred disappears the moment the son perceives his\nfather no longer as the embodiment of his father's symbolic function,\nbut as a vulnerable subject which is disconnected, disattached from\nthis function. It is in this sense that in true love I hate the Beloved\nout of love. I hate the dimension of the beloved person's inscription\ninto the social-symbolic structure. I hate him or her on behalf of my\nvery love for him as a unique person.\nHowever, we should avoid a crucial misunderstanding here. This\nunplugging, this disconnection, has nothing whatsoever to do with the\ncommon humanist idea that one should forget about the artificial\nsymbolic features and perceive one's neighbor in his or her unique\nhumanity, that we should see the real human person beneath the other\nsocial role, beneath ideological mandates or masks. St. Paul is here\nquite explicit in his, what I'm tempted to call in today's terms,\ntheoretical anti-humanism. A quote from Corinthians (5:17): \"From now\non, therefore, regard no one from a human point of view. Even though we\nonce knew Christ from a human point of view, we know him no longer in\nthat way. So if anyone is in Christ, there is a new creation.\nEverything old has passed away, everything has become new.\"\nSo in the uncoupling from the social structure, substance, whichever we\nwant, the neighbor is thus reduced to a singular member of the\ncommunity of believers of the Holy Ghost. To use the modern opposition,\nit is not the symbolic subject who is reduced the real individual; it\nis the individual, the person in all the wealth of his or her\ncharacteristics, features, who is reduced to the singular point of\nsubjectivity. As such, uncoupling effectively involves a symbolic\ndeath. One has to die for the law that regulates our tradition, our\nsocial substance.\nThe term \"new creation\" used by St. Paul is crucial here. It signals\nthe gesture of sublimation, of erasing the traces of one's past and the\nbeginning afresh from a zero point. Consequently, there is also a\nterrifying violence at work in this uncoupling, that of the death\ndrive, of the radical wiping the slate clean as the condition of the\nnew beginning.\nSo again, I hope my point where I am, to put it in these terms,\npro-Christian is clear enough. I claim that the way we - how should I\nput it? - the way to imagine any radical social change was opened by\nthis logic, which again is not the logic of this eternal circular\nmovement, the logic of disturbed and reestablished balance, where we\nare part of some large chain of being; but it's the logic of miracle,\nmiracle not in the religious sense - I'm a materialist, to avoid\nmisunderstanding - but miracle in the sense of you can begin from the\nzero point. We are not caught in an eternal movement. To be good does\nnot mean to be identified to your place. And it's here I claim that\nhuman rights begin. Human rights do not mean you have your proper place\nand dignity comes to you through being identified to that place. Human\nrights means precisely, no, you are something independently of your\nproper place. Which is why every proper right-winger or proto-fascist\nalways insists on one thing. This is the eternal organicist metaphoric\nof fascism or proto-fascism, that society is kind of a mega-organism, a\nbody where the key to order is that everyone has to stick to his or her\nown place, and things go wrong when people want directly to participate\nat the universal dimension. While again, democracy, if this term has\nany meaning today, begins precisely when you have a direct access to\nthe Absolute, where, independently of your place in this destructive,\nviolent outburst you can acquire a distance towards the specific social\nstructure. Because of this, against today's onslaught of New Age\nneo-paganism, it seems to me both theoretically productive and\npolitically salient to stick to this Judaeo-Christian logic.", "source": "human_rights.txt"}
{"text": "SLAVOJ ZIZEK\nTHE REALITY OF THE VIRTUAL\nToday, everybody is talking about virtual reality but I think,\nfrankly, that virtual reality is rather miserable idea. It simply\nmeans \"let us reproduce, in an artificial digital medium, our\nexperience of reality.\"I think that a much more interesting notion,\ncrucial to understand what goes on today, is the opposite: not\nvirtual reality, but the reality of the virtual.\nThat is to say: reality - by this I mean efficacity,\neffectiveness,real effects - produced,generated, by something,which\ndoes not yet fully exist;which is not yet fully actual. In what\nsense can wetalk about this? Huh! In many, maybe even too many\nsenses.\nAt least in three senses: If we take, as the starting point, the\nwell-known lacanian triad of imaginary, symbolic and real. We have,\nput in simple terms, imaginary virtual, symbolic virtual and real\nvirtual. First, a little bit about the first two of them, less\nimportant, and then of coursethe big topic: the real.\nImaginary virtual: what it is? Isn't it clear, if we look atour\nmost common daily experience of ourselves and of others, that how\nwhen we deal with another person, phenomenologically - that is to\nsay,the way we immediately experience them -we erase, abstract from\nthe image of the other person,our partner...certain features, which\nare simply too embarrassingto be kept in mind all the time?! Like,\nI talk to you: of course rationally I know you are defecating,you\nare sweating, not to mention other things, but quite literally,\nwhen I interact with you this is not part of the image I have of\nyou. So, when I deal with you, I'm basically not dealing with the\nreal of you. I'm dealing with the virtual image of you. And this\nimage has reality, in the sense that it, none of the less,\nstructures the way I am dealing with you. And then this\nidealization is crucial. The negative proof,a wonderful one, would\nhave been letters between James Joyce and his wife Nora. where, as\nfar as I know, they went very, very far, almost to the end, into\naccepting each other in the vulgar reality of bodies. Like, all the\nsounds, the bad smells, etc. That was even part of their sexual\ninteraction. It's incredible. I admire this in Joyce. So... OK.\nThis would be the first elementary level: imaginary virtual, in the\nsense of the virtual image which determines how we interact with\nother people. Virtual image in the sense of: although we interact\nwith real people,we erase, we behave as if whole strata of the\nother personare not there.\nSecond level, alreadythe more complex one: symbolic virtual. It's\nelementary. Let's think about an experience, known well to all of\nus, of experiencing authority. Let us say, paternal authority.\nIsn't it clear, that this authority, in order to be operative, in\norder to be experienced...precisely there's the nice paradox, in\norder to be experienced as actual, effective authority,it has to\nremain virtual.Virtual in the sense of a threat. If authority is\nenacted too directly,it is, paradoxically,experienced as a sign of\nimpotence.Concretely: father who truly is an authority doesn't have\nto beat you, or to shout at you, etc. It's just this look,a\nthreatening look, and you obey. If your father looses his nerves\nand smacks you, starts to shout etc., it can be physically painful,\nbut let's admit it, there is always an aspect of something\nridiculous impotent. There's something of a furious outburst of a\npuppet, of a clown image. Again, this is then one clear example of\nhow symbolic authority, in order to be operative, that's the\nparadox, I want to emphasize, has to remain virtual. So it's not\njust\"it is actual already as virtual. \"No! It's actual ONLY as\nvirtual. If it's fully actualized, as the realized threat, father\nbeats you, shouts at you...it's self-destructive. It undermines\nitself as authority. Another example of how the virtual dimensionis\noperative at the symbolic level would have been beliefs. Are we\naware to what extent our beliefs today are virtual? By virtual I\nmean, in this case, attributed to others, presupposed. They don't\nactually exist, they are virtual, in the sense that nobody really\nhas to believe, we only have to presuppose another person to\nbelieve. Elementary example which I'm almost embarrassed to\nmention: if you are a father or motherof small children, Christmas.\nOf course, if somebodyasks you,\"do you really believein Santa Claus\nChristmas,\" you would say,\"No, I just pretend,\" because of the\nchildren,which...\" not to disappoint them, \"but then,we know how\nthe game goes on and on. If you ask the children,they say, \"No, we\njust playthat we are naive,\"not to disappoint our parents\" and to\nmake it sure that we get the presents,\" etc. etc. But it's not only\nthe children. It's even with our political life, I'm tempted to\nclaim. Now with our so called -wrongly so called, I claim, because\nwe believe more than ever -in our so called\"cynically era\", for\nexample, I don'tthink anyone believes in democracy, but nonetheless\nwe want to maintain appearances. There is, to say...There is some\npurely virtual entity, whom we do not wan tto disappoint,who has to\nbe kept innocent, ignorant, because of whom we have to pretend. So\nthe paradox is that although nobody effectively believes, it is\nenough that everybody presupposes someone else to believe and the\nbelief is actual. It structures reality. It functions. Again, the\nparadox is here then similar as the one of authority. It's not only\nthat a belief,which is a virtual belief, not belief of an actual\nperson, but always attributed to other, let's call it, along\nLacanian lines,\"the subject supposed to believe\". It's not only\nthat a belief, alreadyas virtual, as nearly presupposed, already is\nactual. I'm tempted to claim that many of our daily believes, in\norder to function socially as believes, have to remain virtualin\nthis sense. Because if we believe too immediately, then I think\nit's, again,self-destructive for an ideology. We no longer appear\nnormal subjects, we appear idiots. Like, we all know how it is when\nwe encounter somebody,who takes too directly his or hers religious\nbelieves, or political believes. There is something monstrous about\nsomebodywho directly identifies with it. It is as if he or she is\nno longer a real person. It is as if he or she turns into a kind of\na puppet.\nSo, I hope now these two levels are relatively clear; the first two\nlevels of virtuality: imaginary virtuality, symbolic virtuality.\nBut now, of course,the true treasure is waiting for us: real\nvirtuality.\nSo, the real virtual. Well, the problem here, the catch, of course,\nis the notion of the real. So, this may appear void, but we have to\ngo again through the triad \"imaginary-symbolic-real\". because, when\nLacan defines this triadas the triad of a knot, it means that they\nare literally interwoven in the sense that the entire triad is\nreflected into each of the terms, which means, to put it blindly,\nthat there is, again, imaginary real, symbolic real and real real.\nWhat would be the imaginary real? Images, but images which are so\nstrong, so traumatic, that they are real. Too strong to be\nperceived, but still images. Simply think about incredible,\nbreath-taking catastrophes, think about monsters, think about\nprecisely whatin SF or horror is called The Thing. Think about\nmovies like Alien, these terrifying creatures, too strong to be\ndirectly confronted, but nonetheless it's imaginary, because it's\nan image which is too strong to be confronted. Even if you cannot\nconfront it, we are still moving at the imaginary level. That would\nbe theimaginary real.\nThen, the symbolic real. It's simply...for example, scientific\ndiscourse, scientific formulas, like quantum physics. Why is this\nreal? For a simple reason. The meaning of definition of the real\nfor Lacan, is, that which resists symbolization, inclusion into our\nuniverse of meaning. And isn't it that precisely which happens for\nexample with quantum physics? What is quantum physics?Formulas\nwhich work, experimentally confirmed,etc., etc., but we cannot\ntranslate them into our daily experience of ordinary reality. As we\nall know, this is what is so traumatic about quantum physics: we\nliterally cannot understand it. Not in the sense that we, common\npeople,idiots, cannot understand it, only a couple of scientists\ncan: even they cannot. In what sense? In the sense that it just\nworks, but if you try to build a consistent ontology out of it,\nagain, you get meaningless results; you get time running backwards,\nyou get parallel universes, or whatever. In other works, you get\nthings which simply are meaningless with regard to our ordinary\nnotion of reality. So this would be symbolic real. Symbolic -\nobviously the symbolic, formulas, few signifiers -they function,\nit's a functioning machine, but meaningless. We cannot make any\nsenseout of it. We cannot relate it to our experience. Which is why\nwe try so desperately to do it. Which is why we try to invent\nmetaphorsto imagine quantum universe. But it cannot be done.\nThen, finally we arecoming to the real real,which it's precisely\nnot what is usually identified as the real. This would have been\nthe first real, the imaginary real, too traumatic image. What then\nis this famous real real, the very core of the real? Let me\napproach it at two levels.\nThe first level is still relativelyclose to the symbolic order. It\nwould have been...all that accompanies the symbolic level at as its\nobscene shadow. Think about...army units. How they function? You\nhave discipline, symbolic machine, symbolic order, drill, etc. But\nas we all know,this is sustained by a kind of obscene, shadowy\nrealityof - among other things -so called \"marching chants\". In\nevery movie about the marines you hear them, these songs which are\nextremely interesting -songs that soldiers sing by their training,\nmarching -because they are characterizedby meaningless rhymes,\ncombined with sadistic, or sexually perverse, obscenities. One\nexample that I remember, I think it is from An Officer and a\nGentleman, the movie, where marines are singing something like:\"I\ndon't know but I was told that Eskimo pussies are rather cold.\" The\nenigma is, again, why does the military discourse need this? So\nthis would be one level, this shadowy virtual reality of affects\nwhich has to accompany the official discourse.\nBut let's move a little bit deeper. Let's think about...well, one\nof the great achievements of Western Civilization, a movie like The\nSound of Music. Officially, as we all know, it's a story about\nsmall, anti-fascist, democraticAustrians,- at the political level,\nthat is to say -I will leave out all the singing aspect -small,\nhonest, democratic Austrians, fighting, resisting the Nazi\noccupation of Austria in . But! Look at the movie really closely.\nLook at its texture,and you will discover a quite different\nreality, a kind of a virtual reality of the officially depicted\nnarrative reality. If you look at how Austriansare depicted in the\nmovie, you will discover- to cut a long story short -that they are\nprecisely depicted as a kind of a small-is-beautiful provincial\nfascists. Their idiocy is emphasized, these local folkloric\ndresses, etc. They're presented directly as anti-intellectual,\nrooted in narrowlife world, etc. Now, look at how the occupying,\ninvading Nazists are presented. They're not mostly soldiers, but\nmanagers, bureaucrats, exquisitely dressed, with short mustaches,\nsmoking expensive cigarettes, etc. In other words, almost a\ncaricatureof cosmopolitan, decadent, corrupted Jew. So, that's my\npoint: at the level of simplen arrative reality we get one message,\ndemocratic resistance to Nazism. But at the level of- let's call it\n- virtual textureall these micro signs, maybe we could even call it\nwriting, we get practically the opposite message, which is: \"Honest\nfascists resisting decadent Jewish, cosmopolitan, takeover. \"And\nincidentally maybe this is at least one of the reasons why this\nmovie was so extremely popular. While officially agreeing with our\ndemocratic ideology, it, at the same time, addresses our secret\nfascist dreams. But let's take a more serious example: Robert\nAltman's masterpiece, Shortcuts. Again, at the narrative level we\nget a simple story,or rather - stories, parallel stories, depicting\ndesperate everydaylife of LA middle classes, It's the portrait of\ntoday's alienation, solitude, etc. But again, the very textureof\nthe film, I claim, is a much more optimistic one. It's a kind of\ncelebration of this magic of contingent encounters, generatings,\nunexpected effects of meaning. So I think that...In a similar way\nto how we should read The Sound of Music, it is wrong to read\nShortcuts simply as kind of social critical piece, there is another\nmuch more optimistic, life asserting even, letter.\nSo, to provide the formula of this 'real virtual'. Let me refer to\nrecent paradoxical statement by none other than Donald Rumsfeld. I\nthink that this statement was an important contribution to\ncontemporary American philosophical debate. This happened in March\n, just before the war on Iraq, where Rumsfeld elaborated the\nrelationship between 'known' and 'unknown'. First, he said, there\nare 'known knowns'. There are things we know that we know. Like, we\nknew at that point that Saddam was the president of Iraq. OK,\neverything clear. Then, he went on,there are 'known unknowns'.\nThere are things that we know that we don't know. The idea was, for\nexample, we know that we don't know how many weapons of mass\ndestruction Saddam has. OK, now we know he had none. It doesn't\nmatter. At that point it appeared like this. Then there is 'the\nunknown unknown', things we don't know that we don't know, things\nwhich are so foreign and so unimaginable that we even don't know\nthat we don't know. For example, maybe Saddam had some\nunimaginable, totally unexpected weapon. And here\nunfortunatelyRumsfeld stopped. because I thinkhe should have go on.\nmaking the next step to the fourth category, fourth variation,\nwhich is missing, which is: not the 'known unknowns', but the\n'unknown knowns'. Things we don't know we know them. We know them,\nthey are part of our identity,they determine our activity, but we\ndon't know that we know them! This is what,in psychoanalysis, of\ncourse,is called unconscious. Unconscious fantasies, unconscious\nprejudices, etc., etc. And I think that this level is crucial. To\nrefer to previous two examples from movies: in The Sound of\nMusic,what we directly know is that it's a movie about antifascist\nresistance of modest, honest Austrians. What we don't know that we\nknow is that it's also the opposite: that it's the movie about\nfascists resisting the Jewish takeover. And the tragedy of today's\nAmerican politics, I think, is that precisely they are not aware of\nthese 'unknown knowns', which is why there was a deep truth in one\nof the statements of that unfortunate Iraqi minister of\ninformation. We were all laughing at him during the last Iraqi war,\nbecause of his ridiculous statements, denying the obvious, but at\none point, I claim, what he told was absolutely true. When, towards\nthe end of the war, he was asked, \"Is it true that Americans\nalready control,\"American forces, part of the Baghdad airport?\", he\nsaid: \"Not true. Americans don't control even themselves.\" Perfect\ntruth. Why? Because they don't know what they know. And this - what\nyou don't knowthat you know -controls you, but you don'tcontrol it.\nOK.\nSo now we come to the really real, real core of the real, much more\nfundamental than the symbolic real, but which, paradoxically, is at\nthe same time the most virtual real. It is what? Let us think about\nattractors in mathematics or in physics. For example, you have\nsmall pieces of iron and you throw them around a magnetic field.\nThey are dispersed, following a certain shape, infinitely\napproaching this shape, but this shape, of course, is not existing\nitself. It's just something that you can abstract, isolate from the\ndispersion of the small pieces of iron. That's the idea of 'virtual\nreal'. It's a shape - this is the realof this field,but it doesn't\nexistin itself. It's just an abstract form, which structures the\ndisposition of actually existing elements around it.\nNow, what has this to do with psychoanalytic problematic, or, even\nmore, with political problematic? My idea is: a lot. Let's think\nabout the precise status of trauma in psychoanalysis. It is similar\nto this non-existing attractor. That is to say, more closely: Freud\nshifted his position, as we all know, with regard to trauma, he\nshifted his position in a way which is, strangely enough, parallel\nto the shift in Einstein's theory of relativity, the shift from\nspecial to general theory of relativity. This shift in theory of\nrelativityconcerns the reference to the curved space,curvature of\nspace. As most of us, I hope, know, for Einstein, first, in a first\napproach, it was the presence of the density of matter, of stuff,\nwhich curved the space. Space was originally perceived as empty\nspace, abstractly was symmetrical, non-curved, then the presence of\nstuffcurves it. But then, in a second step, Einstein accomplished a\nwonderful reversal. He just termed the terms around. It was not the\npresence of matter, of stuff, which curves the space, it was, on\nthe contrary, the curvature of the space which was primordial. And\nwhat we perceive as matteris just kind of a reified, fetishist\nmisperception of a purely formal curvature of the space. And I\nclaim it's exactly like this in the psychoanalytic notion of\ntrauma. In a first approach Freud imagined trauma as some kind of\ndense, raw presence, presence of some real which brutally intrudes\ninto our symbolic space and curves it. Quite literally. Let's\nimagine that I have my well-balanced symbolic space,then something\ntraumatic happens to me: I'm raped, I witness a terrifying event,\nI'm tortured, whatever. And because of the traumatic impact of this\nevent my symbolic space gets curved. Some things can no longer be\nsymbolized, the function of those symbol has to be taken over with\nother symbols. There is a kind of imbalance. There is a gap in my\nsymbolic space. This would be the first approach. But then Freud\nnoticed some strange things. What things? Let's recall his best\nknown analysis of Wolfman. The traumatic scene there, of course, is\nthe small child, Wolfman, witnessing the parental coitus a terbo.\nBut let's look at it in a much more precise way. What effectively\nhappens there? It's not that this was simply a trauma. As a small,\n-year and the half old child, Wolfman did not find anything\ntraumatic in this scene. He just perceived it and stored it. It was\n- years later, when Wolfman started to develop his theories,\ninfantile theories of sexuality,and because he was not able to\naccount for sexuality, in other words, because the symbolic spaceof\nhis sexual theories was curved, it is only at this point tha the\nresuscitated the traumatic scene. So... I think, in clear parallel\nto Einstein, we can see how here it's the other way around. The\nprimordial fact is not some brutal intrusion of the real,of a\ntraumatic real. The primordial fact,and also the primordial real,\nis a purely formal imbalance. The symbolic space is curved, it's\ncut across by antagonism, imbalanced, etc. and to account for this\nyou need reference to some real. Which is, of course,the real. The\nreal in the sense of the traumatic appearance. It's a lure here. A\ntrap.\nSo what does this notion of the virtual real, as trauma, trauma as\nvirtual, what does this notion mean for politics? Can this serve us\n- we want to analyze political, ideological phenomena? Of course.\nLet's just recall how antisemitism functions. In it's fascist\nversion, antisemitism,or rather the figure of the Jew, the Jewish\nplot, is precisely an external trauma which brutally intrudes,\ndisturbing social balance. Curving, as it were, the social space.\nSociety was supposed to be harmonious, balanced, then Jews\nintervened, distort it. It's, as it were, natural order. But of\ncourse, here at least,we should be Marxists, and turn things\naround. It's not that there is disorder,antagonism,disintegration,\nclass struggle, because of the Jews. Class struggle, or more\ngenerally,social antagonism, comes first. That is to say: social\nspaceis in itself already curved, imbalanced. And in order to\nimaginarily, in an imaginary way, account for it, we invent the\nfigure of the Jew. That is to say, we project the cause of it into\nthe figure of the Jew.\nEven at the more fundamental level,of today's economic\nconstellation, I think that this notion of the real as virtual can\nhelp us to critically reject, a category which is more and more\npopular with politically correct, post-colonial authors, the notion\nof so-called alternate or alternative modernity. The idea is, to\nput it simply, the following one. Of course there are\ninconsistencies, antagonisms, repressive potentials in the notion\nof modernity,which ultimately means, of course,capitalism as the\nforce of modernity, but, so the story goes, this antagonistic,\nrepresive elements are not part of the very concept of modernity,\nbut are only limited to the Anglo-Saxon, West European model of\nmodernization. Why then should not there not be other alternate\nmodernities, where you can have modernization, but without this\nalienating effects which characterize Western European process of\nmodernization. Without socially disruptive processes, without\nalienation, without exploitation, without ecological\ncatastrophes,etc., etc. And then, of course, it's free for grab.\nAnybody can have his own modernity. You can say we can have Latin\nAmerican modernity, as alternate modernity, we can have African\nmodernity, we can have Asian modernity, whatever. So what is the\nproblem with this approach, which is basically an approach of\nhistoricist nominalism? Because the under lined logic is that in\nfamous...pseudo the constructionist logics of\"There is no modernity\nas such.\" \"There are only particular modernities.\" \"Like West\nEuropean, Latin American,African, etc.\" Of course this is true. The\nproblem is elsewhere. The problem is that through this nominalist\nreduction, again, by claiming that only particular modernities\neffectively exist, the sight of antagonism is reducedto only one\nparticular modernity. It is no longer modernity as suchwhich is\ncharacterized by antagonism, imbalance. Imbalance is dismissed as\njust pertaining with certain species of, particular species of\nmodernity. And what is problematic with this? Well...To put it very\nsimply: did we not have already in the early th century, in the\nfirst part of the th century, one big, well-known project of\nalternate modernity? It was called fascism.\nFascism was precisely the first big attemptto build an alternate\nmodernity. That is to say, to have the process of modernization,\nindustrial development etc. but without paying the priceof\nalienation, social disintegration, etc. What should we then oppose\nto this model? We should oppose to it the idea that some\nantagonism,we can call it by different names, traditional Marxist\nwould have called it\"class struggle\", Frankfurt school would have\ncall it \"dialectic of enlightenment\", but the idea being that there\nis some antagonistic potential in the very project of capitalist\nmodernity. That is to say that all these phenomena that we deploy,\nwars, violences, concentration camps, new fundamentalism, you name\nit, that all this is not simply regression,or as Habermas would\nhave put it, a sign of modernity as an unfinished project, but is\npart of the very project of modernity. This is what gets lost.\nWhich is why I think that although it wants to be historicist,\ncritical, this idea of reducing the antagonistic aspects of\nmodernity, to just one particular form of modernity, is deeply\nideological. Because it saves unblemished the general notion of\nmodernization. What we should insist on is on the contrary, as I've\njust said, that there is an antagonism inherent to the very\nuniversal notion of modernity, and, now I'm coming to my point, so\nthat the particular speciesof modernity are not just examples or\nexemplifications of their universal genus, of their universal\nnotion,but they are, in a way,reactions to it,they fight\nit.Modernity, as a universal notion, names a certain dead-lock, a\ncertain antagonism, and particular, really existing forms of\nmodernity,are attempts to resolve this deadlock, to solve the\nproblem. Liberal capitalism, as one form of modernity, wants to\nsolve the deadlock of modernity in a certain way, through market\nfreedoms etc., fascist modernization in a different way, Latin\nAmerican modernization in a different way.\nSo what's properly dialectical here? It's, again, this very\nreversal of the usual constellation. It's not that struggleis at\nthe level of the particular content, while universally it's just\nsome kind of neutral empty container, so that universal means some\nencompassing global notion, and then, within this notion,\nparticular forms struggle, like fascist modernization against\nliberal modernization etc. etc. No! The sight of the struggle is\nuniversal antagonism itself. And all particular actually existing\nmodernisms are attempts to cover up, resolve this problem. So,\nagain, we should remember this that the sight of antagonism is\nuniversality.\nWhat has this to do with'virtual as real'? Ah, precisely this sight\nof universality as the sight of antagonism is virtual. In what\nsense? In the sense that there is no universal modernization. It's\njust a certain virtual constellation of a certain antagonism. All\nthat exists...Nominalists are here right. All that effectively\nexistsare just particular forms of modernization. There is no\nmodernity as such. There only is Anglo-Saxon, Latin-American,\nAfrican etc., fascist modernity. But in order to grasp the very\ndynamic of this particular forms, one has to refer them to\nthis...their absent cause, to the big antagonism, to which they\nreact. So, again, this would have been another example of how the\nnotion of virtual as real is operative, of how it is a necessary\nnotion if we are to grasp the concrete social dynamic, especially\nof today's global capitalism.\nSo the conclusion to be drawn from all this is that the category of\nthe real is ultimately a purely formal category. It's not a\ncategory of some formless content disturbing order, it's a pure\nstructural gap. It's an entirely non-substantial category.\nIt's...If we may put it in these terms, it's a difference, but a\npure difference. A pure difference in the sense that it's a\ndifference which is paradoxically prior to what it is the\ndifference between. So it's not simplythat we have two terms and\nthere is a difference between the two terms. Paradoxically, the two\npositive terms appear afterwards as attempts to dominate, cover up\nthe tension etc. of this difference.\nAgain, how can this be? Another simple example, just to illustrate\nthis logic: the political distinction...I know, it's half forgotten\ntoday, nobody wants to hear about it, but nonetheless, the\ndistinction betweenLeft and Right. The first thing that strikes the\neye about this distinction, if we take it seriously, is thatit's\nnot just a distinction within a certain social cowl. It's not that,\nin a certain society, if we take into account all political forces,\nwe can say:\"These are right-wing forces, these are left-wing\nforces,\" and then all the intermediate phenomena, \"in between,\ncenter, center-left,center-right, whatever you want.\" It's\ndifferent. It is that...if you ask a right-winger, how is the\nentire social field structured, you will get a totally different\nanswer than if you ask a left-winger,or, for that matter,if you ask\na centrist. To simplify it: a right-winger will tell you that\nsociety is an organic, harmonious unity, at least the traditional\nright-winger, and that left radicals are external intruders. What\nis anathema for radical conservative is the idea that there is an\nantagonism, an imbalance inscribed into the very heart of the\nsocial edifice. For a left-winger, the struggle is admitted as\ncentral. So, again, the point is that there is no neutral way to\ndefine the difference between Left and Right. In itself it's a\nvoid. It's just that youcan approach it either from the leftist or\nfrom the rightist point of view.\nAnd incidentally, for Lacan, it's exactly in the same way that also\nsexual difference functions. Sexual difference is not a difference\nbetween the two species of humanity in general, but it's the...From\nthe male perspective sexual difference itself appears in a\ndifferent way that from the feminine perspective. So, again,\ndifference paradoxically comes first.\nCrucial, philosophically,is this, let's call it pure formalism. And\nagainst the reproach that we are dealing here with some kind of\nidealism. Isn't matter in it's positive, inert presence,\nprimordial?I think that we should reject this reproach and\nprecisely insist on this notion of...how should I call it?...purely\nformal materialism. Materialism as materialism of the difference.\nThe minimal feature of materialism being that there is a pure\ndifference. That there is a crack, an antagonism in within the\norder of the One. That the primordial fact is pure, self\ndifference. I'm very precise here. Self difference, and not any\nkind of this mythological polar opposites, feminine-masculine,\nlight-darkness, yin-yang, etc. I think that here radical\nmaterialism should be even critical towards Deleuze, Gilles\nDeleuze, who blights to assert some kind of primordial multitude,\nas the ultimate ontological fact. From the radical prospect that\nI'm advocating, multitude already is an effect of the inconsistency\nof The One with itself, of the fact that The One cannot coincide\nwith itself. Or, to put it in a slightlydifferent way, we do not\nhave some primordial polarity, like masculine-feminine,\nlight-darkness, and then we can play all these New Age, agnostic\ngames of how win our era, we put too much accent on one pole, and\nwe have to reestablishthe balance, like we are too rational,\nmasculine, let's put more accent on the feminine, emotional side,\nwhatever...No, it's more radical! It's as if, as Lacan puts it, the\nbinary signifieris primordially repressed,which means, the second\nelement is always missing, and this lack of the counterpoint -we\nhave one, but we don't have the accompanying other -and this\noriginal imbalance then sets in motion the generation of\nmultiplicity. Again, an extremely simple example from one of the\nearly movies by Woody Allen, I think it's Love and War, a kind of a\nparody on Tolstoy,where, again, the whole movie topic focuses on\ntopic of Tolstoy. So, of course, our first enigma is here: \"Where\nis Dostoyevsky?\", The Other, natural supplement to Tolstoy. There\nis no Dostoyevsky,so what happens in the movie, as a kind a return\nof the repressed, is tha tin one wonderful short scene,when two\nmain characters talk with each other, all the big titles of\nDostoyevsky's novels emerge. Like, \"do you know what happened with\nthat Idiot?\" \"Ah, you mean the one ofthe Karamazov brothers?\"\n\"Yes.\" -\"He did his crime,it was punished.\" \"Then he went\nunderground,turned into a gambler\", etc. etc. The lesson of this is\nontological lesson: is: one cannot coincide with itself, pure\ndifference, because of this pure difference as a secondary effect\nthe multitude explodes.\nSo, again...Against the usual reproach is this not idealism. I\nwould say that today it is rather idealism which is materialist.\nToday's opposition, I'm tempted to claim,between materialism and\nidealismis that today's idealism,or rather spiritualism, clings to\nthis famous density, inertia of experience, of matter, of\nearth...of the stuff.\nNo wonder that the greatest,arguably, spiritual movie director,the\nRussian, Tarkovsky,was at the same time practically obsessed bythe\ntopic of inertia of matter,density of matter,matter in decay. In\nhis films, when heroesare praying,they don't pray looking\nupwards.They pray by sometimes literallyimmersing their heads into\nmud,with close contact with earth. So I think, the thing to do\ntoday is to oppose to this kind of spiritual materialism, the pure\nformalism of true radical materialism,which is...Why, for me,\nquantum physics is ultimately a deeply materialist theory, where\nyou don't need any positivity of matter. You can do everything with\npurely formal oscillations etc.\nSo, again, back to this central insight that difference comes\nfirst. Difference... How to think a difference, which is priorto\nthe elements it is the difference of? Immanuel Kant, already in his\nearly writings, introduces here a crucial distinction. A very\nstrange, but clear distinction. A distinction between a negative\njudgment and indefinite judgment. That is to say, as Kant puts it,\nit is not the same thing to say: \"You aren't human\" and to say\"You\nare inhuman\". If I say \"You aren't human\", it simply means you are\nexternal to humanity, you are animal, divine, whatever. It's\noutside. But if I say, as Kant puts it, if I do not simply negate a\npredicate, but if I affirm a non-predicate...So again, if I don't\nsay simply\"You aren't human\", but if I say\"You are inhuman\", it\nmeans non-humanity, an excess over humanity, but an excess which is\ninherent to humanity itself. To give you another example, which\nwill make it clear, there's this thing about Steven King's horror\nnovels, the well known category of the undead. We can feel the\ndifference. If I say,\"You aren't dead\". It's not the same as\nsaying\"You are undead\". If I say you aren't dead, it simply means\nyou are alive, and nothing more, nothing mysterious. But, as every\nreader of horror novels knows, if I say,\"You are undead\", it\nmeansyou are the living dead, you are alive precisely as dead.\nImmanuel Kant's point is that human freedom has exactly such a\nstatus. It's something which is neither nature -animals are not\nfree, they are enslaved to their instincts -nor culture - culture\nis already: symbolic law, symbolic regulation. But, the conclusion\nto be drawnfrom Kant,and consequently from Freudand Lacan, is that\nwhat cultural symbolic prohibitionstry to regulate -to master, to\ndominate,to domesticate, whatever you want -is not directly nature,\nnatural instincts, but it's this zero-level inhuman excess, to use\nLacan's Pan: the extimate kernel of humanity. The in-human\ndimensionin exactly the same sense, in which we talk about the\nundead -not in-human as external to humanity, but a monstrous\nexcess, or some radical wild freedom,which is inherent tohumanity\nitself.\nSo again we have this paradox, that the difference between nature\nand culture, is a level of its own. Is neither nature, nor culture,\nit's some kind of crazy excess. So what would then a politics of\npure difference be? Well, first, per negationem -what it would not\nbe? It would definitely not be what emerges today more and moreas\nthe ultimate horizon of the political, the so-called \"identity\npolitics\", or more broadly, the politics of recognizing the\ndifferences, of tolerating the differences. What is for me\nproblematic in this multicultural, at least tolerant politics etc.\nIt's not just the vulgar fact that they effectively, even if they\ndeny it, neglect economic struggle. It's the very logic of the\nstruggle. The logic of multicultural struggle, of anti-racist\nstruggle, of struggle against sexism, is again the logic of\nrecognizing differences.\nFor example: in anti-sexist struggle,the goal, of course, is\nnot,even for radical feminists -I don't know - to kill,to\nannihilate men. It's to establish an open field within which both\nsexes, all different sexual positions, sexual identities, cultural\nidentities inclusive, will be allowed to thrive freely, so that one\nwill not articulate itselfat the expense of others.\nAgain, in the anti-racist strugglethe ultimate horizon is that of\nopening up the space for differences: each ethnic group, religious\ngroup,cultural group, way of life group, should have the freedomto\nfreely deploy, articulate it's potentials, it's position. But this\nconceptual field, the field of openness towards the other, of\ntolerating, allowing for differences, as the ultimate ethical\nhorizon, this, I claim, should not,cannot be, our ultimate horizon.\nBecause we can immediately see that...to use the simplified example\n-class struggle. My God, the ultimate goal of the class struggle is\nnot for proletarians to allow the bourgeoisie, and bourgeoisie to\nallow proletariansto freely deploy their own potentials etc. It's\nan antagonistic struggle. The goal is not to let the multitude be.\nThe goal is to annihilate the enemy. It's a totally different\nlogic. It's the logic of animosity,it's the logic of antagonistic\nstruggle. Which also involves a totally different notion of\nuniversality. The notion of universality here is no longer\nuniversality as the encompassing medium,container of the\npluralityof positions -sexual positions, cultural\npositions,whatever. No! Universality is here the universality of\nstruggle itself. There is also a central paradox to this struggling\nposition. The position of struggle does not mean the position of a\nparticular identity and the abandonment of the universal notion of\ntruth. The abandonment of the universal notion of truth goes very\nwell with multi-culturalese politics where we can say:\" Everybody\nhas the right\"to narrate it's own version of truth. There is no\nglobal truth. \"No! Our position should be:there is universal truth.\nThere always is one universal truth of a certain situation. But\nthis truth is accessible only from a specific, partial,\nengaged,engaged in the struggle, standpoint. So it's not that we\narrive at the universal truth by abstracting from our particula\nrengagement, from our particular interests,the idea being: each of\nus has it's own interests, positions, but the truth of a situation\nemerges when we can step, as it were,outside ourselves and look at\nthe situation more objectively,the way it really is. No, on the\ncontrary! We should fully assume the paradoxof universal truth\nbeing accessible only through a partial, engaged position. This, I\nthink, is more precious than ever to maintain today.\nAnd this is the reason why, at the social level, I think,we should\ncling to the notion of collective as it was till now practice in\nthree forms: messianic religious collectives, revolutionary\nparties,and psycho-analytic communities.They both share...sorry,\nall three of them, they share precisely this same notion of\nuniversality accessible only through an engaged,struggling,\nsubjective position. This politics of pure differenceis opposed\ntoday by another, I would call it, politics of the real, but the\nreal of the super-ego, in precisely the sense I already talked\nabout, that is to say: super-ego injunction, the obscene virtual\nsuper-ego injunction to enjoy. So how does this super-ego\ninjunction function today, in the hegemonic mode of social\nidentification?To put it in extremely simplified terms: the old\nfunctioning of ethics was that of moderation. The ultimate task of\nethics was to moderate it, like - do it, but not excessively. Eat,\ndrink - not too much. Sex - not too much. It was the ethics of the\nproper measure. Today, I claim, a different kindof ethics is\nemerging. An ethics which, on the one hand, allows you limitless\nconsumption, no moderation, go to the end - but why? Because the\nobject in itselfis already deprived of its dangerous substance,as\nit were. The whole series of products that we find today on the\nmarket -decaffeinated coffee, beer without alcohol, sugar without\nsugar etc. -that is to say the product where you get the effect but\ndeprived of its potentialy dangerous substance.\nSo that today the injunctionis no longer\"Drink coffee, but\nmoderately\", it is:\"Have as much coffee as you want,\"because coffee\nis already,in itself, decaffeinated coffee.\" Maybe the best -\nslightly tasteless, but what the hell, why not? -metaphor for this\nproduct is something that I saw- years ago in Los Angeles. It's the\nparadox of a chocolate laxative. Of course, chocolate being that\nwhich gives you constipation. With the publicity, I remember\nit:\"Still constipated? Not a problem, eat more of our chocolate!\"\nSo that's the paradox, that the chocolate is already its own remedy\nin a kind of almost Hegelian direct coincidence of the opposites.\nSo, why is this interesting? Precisely because, I claim, it's not\nlimited only to phenomena of commodities. What interests me is how\nwe can locate the same logic also, the same paradoxical logic of an\nproduct being its own counter-effect, already and also within the\nsocial field.\nFor example, let's take the big topic of tolerance. What does it\nmean? I claim it has precisely the structure of chocolate laxative.\nThat is to say, tolerance is a mode of appearance of its own\nopposite, of intolerance. Because, what does it mean, tolerance,\ntoday? It means tolerate the differences,which, again,means \"don't\nharass me\". Tolerance means: \"Tolerate me\",means \"Don't harass me\".\nWhat does it mean,\"Don't harass me\"? It means precisely\"Don't come\ntoo close to me\". If you come too close to me with your excessive\nenjoyment, you disturb me, you harass me. So we have then this idea\nthat practically everything appear form of harassment. I look at\nyou, it's potentially sexual harassment. I speak too loudly, it's\nverbal harassment, whatever. Everything, every over-proximityof\nanother human being can be potentially a form of harassment. And I\nthink that this fearof harassment is preciselly fundamental form of\nintolerance, today.\nAnd so, again, I claim that when we talk about tolerance today, it\nmeans precisely tolerance as avoiding harassment, which means\nintolerance. It means let's tolerate each other, again,which means\nlet's keepat a proper distance from each other. Yet another\nchocolate laxative phenomenon isn't it the way we dea lwith wealth\ntoday? The exemplary figure today for me hereis somebody like\nGeorge Soros. Half the day he engages in the most ruthless\nfinancial exploitations, ruining the lives of hundreds,of\nthousands, even millions. The other half he just gives part of it\nback. So the morning is chocolate, the afternoon is laxative. Like,\nyou know, involving all these human aid programs, etc.,political,\ndemocratization, etc. etc.\nSo again, instead of simply not engage in ruthless speculation, he\ndoes it, but then includes counter-action. And even more\nradically,is it not exactly the same with war today? I think that\nUlrich Beck,the German sociologist,was well justified in\ninventingthe term \"militarist pacifism\",or \"humanitarian\nmilitarism\".What goes on today where all the wars are declared as\nwars for peace. It's not only that their ultimate goal is defined\nas to bring peace, into Iraq, to remove the threat of war, etc.\netc. It's even more radically. It is that the war operation itself\nresembles more and morea kind of humanitarian intervention to help\nthe people there. If you read, for example,the recent justification\nof attack on Iraq.It's not so much that Iraq was attacked in order\nto remove the threat to the Western nation of Saddam. It was in\norder to help the Iraqi people etc. etc. No wonder then that...the\nultimate chocolate laxative...No wonder that...The concentration\ncamps.\nAs Giorgio Agamben claims,the typical, exemplary case of a th\ncentury collective, has precisely these both aspects. Again,\nchocolate laxative structure, the aspect of isolating the enemy\n-Guantanamo or whatever -and the aspect of concentrating people in\norder to give them,to provide them with humanitarian aid.\nSo, what this meansare two things. First, I don't think that it is\njustified to talk today about consumption -we live in a society of\nconsumption, etc. On the contrary, I claim.We consume less than\never, if consuming means taking the risk, really opening yourself.\nWhich is why, incidentally,we are so afraid of smoking. I claim\nit's not simply medical results etc. What is so terrifying in\nsmoking is somebody really consuming the smoke with all the dangers\nthis involves. I think that the true consumers today are\ndrug-addicts, chain-smokers, etc. And they are the figures of\nhorror today, if anything. Again, the structure is that of\nchocolate laxative,which is why we are or looking even at this\nlevel for products which would be already a kind of decaffeinated\ncoffee. Which is why I think marijuanais so popular. Because it's\nkind of decaffeinated opium, de facto. Opium without opium. You can\nhave it, but deprived of its dangerous substance.\nSo, to conclude this brief reflection, I would say that today the\nfundamental, as it were,ethical injunction, the injunction society\nbombards us with, is no longer the injunction to control yourself,\nto repress your strivings or whatever. It's on the contrary, the\ninjunction to enjoy it, to go to the end. This is what we feel\nguilty about today. And this, I think, also changes fundamentally\nthe role of psychoanalysis. It does not make it outdated, it's more\nactual than ever,only its function fundamentally changed.\nIn the good all days,or so it appeared, now it's clear that it\nnever was simply like that, the idea was the following one. Let's\nsay you are sexually frustrated, because you internalized some\npaternal or other prohibitions, you cannot enjoy sex, and the\nfunction of psychoanalysis is to relieve you, release you of the\npressure of these internalized prohibitions, so you can let\nyourself go,you can enjoy. In other words, you feel guilty if you\ntransgressed social prohibitionsin order to enjoy. Today it's\nalmost the opposite.You feel guilty, if you cannot make it, if you\ncannot enjoy. And we shouldn't take here enjoyment just in the\nimmediate sense of sex, sure pleasure of drinking, whatever. It can\nbe enjoyment of power, social success, professional success, it can\nbe even spiritual enjoyment, in the New Age sense,Gnostic sense of\nrealizing your ego etc. etc.\nWhat we are getting today is that you feel guilty if in this sense\nyou cannot enjoy yourself. So this brings us, I claim, to a double\nfunction of psychoanalys is today.\nA. It's message is not \"relax, get rid of prohibitions\".It's\nmessage is, as Alain Badiou put it in wonderful terms,\"you should\nlearn to becomea pitiless censor of yourself.\"The role of\npychoanalys is today. It's not to enable you to enjoy,but to open\nup a space in which you are allowed not to enjoy. That's the\nfundamental messageof psychoanalysis today. You are not obliged to\nenjoy. You are allowednot to enjoy. Which, of course, is not the\nsame as saying you are prohibited to enjoy. Just: you are\nallowednot to enjoy. This confronts us furthermore with the\nparadoxes of today's superego. Which is how, on the one\nhand,permissivity ends up in its opposite. Like: today the\ninjunctionis \"enjoy\",the result is more prohibitions, regulations\nthan ever. You can enjoy yourself, but in order to enjoy yourself\nproperly, you are ordered to - what -not to eat too much,to engage\nin jogging, to take care of your fitness,not to smoke, etc. etc.\nJust look around and I think that there is nothing more miserable\ntoday than those younger couples or peoplewho organize their life\nin order to enjoy themselves. The regulation is total.\nOn the other hand,we have the opposite paradox, which is that the\nso-called\"newly emerging fundamentalism\"is not here in order to\nintroducesome new stability,to give you firm ethical foundationin\ntoday's world where there are no firm stable values etc.,but on the\ncontrary, I claim,it is here to open up as a kind of a false space\nof freedom. I'm referring here, of course,implicitlyto Lacan's\nfamous reversal of the Dostoyevsky motto. it is not that if God\ndoesn't exist, everything is permitted, but if God doesn't exist,\neverything is prohibited.This is the lesson of the hedonistic\nyuppies. And the opposite lesson, no less crucial:if God\nexists,then everything is permitted. Which means: if you can\njustify your role as that of being the instrument of the divine\nwill,in other words - you hear voices,you have the contact with the\nguy up there,either George Bushor Osama bin Laden -as many people\nnoticed: this is what they have in common,they both hear directly\nfrom up there -then you can do whatever you want -you can do\nterrorist acts,bomb countries, etc. etc.\nSo here we see how difficult it is to orient ourselves in today's\nconstellation where there is a certain urge to false\nfreedom,inherent to the system itself. Which is why, I claim,the\nmain task todayis to reinvent utopia, a space of utopia. What do\nyou mean by this? It's not, of course, the old fashioned\nutopia,which is the utopia of imagining ideal world about which we\nknow in advance that it will never be realized. The big models here\nare, of course:Plato's Republic,Thomas Moore Utopia,and - we should\nnot forget -Marquis de Sade:Philosophy in the Boudoir. That's the\nclassical utopia. Then we have, what I'm tempted to call,the\ncapitalist utopia. This unbridled solicitation of new and new\ndesires,which can go pretty far. Like today I learned thatin the\nUnited States, they are, in some communities, seriously considering\nthe idea that necrophiliacs,those who want to play sexual games\nwith corpses, dead bodies, are seriously deprived. So isn't it the\nduty of our societyto provide them with corpses? Can it be done in\nsome wayso that people sign voluntarily in the same way that you\nsign that if you die, your heart,your organs can be used,that your\nbody can be used to be delivered to necrophiliacs etc. etc. The\nproblem here is that,radical as this may appear,there is something\nridiculously benign about it,about this capitalist utopia. You can\ngo to the end, basically nothing happens. But we have a third\nutopia,which is, again,neither this classical utopia of imagining\nan alternative universe, not even dreaming about really realizing\nit,then the capitalist utopia of ever new desires,extreme forms of\nsatisfying your desires, there is a third mode which,I would say it\nprecisely -the real,the real core of utopia. I think a truly\nradical utopiais not an exercise in free imagination. Like, you sit\ndown,don't have anything wiser to do than to imagine possible ideal\nworlds. It's something that you do literally as out of an inner\nurge. You have to invent something new when you cannot do it\notherwise. True utopia for me is not a matter of the future, it's\nsomething to be immediately enacted, when there is no other way.\nUtopia in this sense simply means: do what appears, within the\ngiven symbolic coordinates, as impossible. Take the risk, change\nthe very coordinates. And I'm not talking here about something\ncrazy. Even big classical well-known,even some times conservative\nacts,have this utopian dimension. Like, to take a ridiculous\nexample,thirty years ago, remember Richard Nixon's trip to China.\nThere was almost a utopian dimension to it. Why? Because he did\nwhat was appeared as impossible. China was portrayed as the\nultimate evil super power. With Soviet Union there was detente, not\nwith China. That act changed the entire coordinates. It did the\nimpossible. This is what we need more than ever today. Because\nultimately, I claim, the true utopia today is not a different\norder. It's the idea that the existing order can function\nindefinitely. The true utopia, I claim,was not communism,which\ndisintegrated in 89', it was the utopia of the 90s. The idea,\nelaborated, among others,by Francis Fukuyama, that we discovered\nthe final social form -liberal capitalist democracy -that we cannot\ngo further.That it's just a question of making it little more\ntolerant, spread it all around the world, but that we have the\nformula. And I think that if there is a symbolic meaning to\nSeptember 11th, is that the time of that utopia is over. The real\nof history is back. Which is why today the urge is not to be\nterrorized by the so-called\"post-political politics\" which tells\nus:\"ideological times are over,\" all you can do is just to play the\nrealistic game\"of accepting the trends\" etc. etc. We should dare to\nenact the impossible. We should rediscover how to not imagine, but\nenact utopia. The point is not again about planning utopias, the\npoint is about practicing them. And I think this is not a question\nof should we do it or should we simply persist in the existing\norder. It's much more radical. It's a matter for survival. The\nfuture will be utopian,or there will be none.", "source": "the_reality_of_the_virtual.txt"}
