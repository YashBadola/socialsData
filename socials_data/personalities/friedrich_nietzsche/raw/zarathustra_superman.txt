   I TEACH YOU THE SUPERMAN. Man is something that is to be surpassed.
   What have ye done to surpass man?

   All beings hitherto have created something beyond themselves: and ye
   want to be the ebb of that great tide, and would rather go back to the
   beast than surpass man?

   What is the ape to man? A laughing-stock, a thing of shame. And just
   the same shall man be to the Superman: a laughing-stock, a thing of
   shame.

   Ye have made your way from the worm to man, and much within you is
   still worm. Once were ye apes, and even yet man is more of an ape than
   any of the apes.

   Even the wisest among you is only a disharmony and hybrid of plant and
   phantom. But do I bid you become phantoms or plants?

   Lo, I teach you the Superman!

   The Superman is the meaning of the earth. Let your will say: The
   Superman SHALL BE the meaning of the earth!

   I conjure you, my brethren, REMAIN TRUE TO THE EARTH, and believe not
   those who speak unto you of superearthly hopes! Poisoners are they,
   whether they know it or not.

   Despisers of life are they, decaying ones and poisoned ones themselves,
   of whom the earth is weary: so away with them!

   Once blasphemy against God was the greatest blasphemy; but God died,
   and therewith also those blasphemers. To blaspheme the earth is now the
   dreadfulest sin, and to rate the heart of the unknowable higher than
   the meaning of the earth!
