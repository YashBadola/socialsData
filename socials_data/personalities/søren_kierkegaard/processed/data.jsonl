{"text": "PREFACE\nNot only in the world of commerce but also in the world of ideas our age is putting on a veritable clearance sale. Everything is to be had at such a bargain that it is doubtful whether in the end there is anyone who will want to bid. Every speculative price-watcher who conscientiously signals the significant progress of modern philosophy, every assistant professor, tutor, and student, every crofter and cottar in philosophy, is not content with doubting everything but goes further. It might perhaps be untimely and ill-timed to ask them where they are going, but it is surely courteous and unobtrusive to take it for granted that they have doubted everything, since otherwise it would be queer for them to be going further. This motion of going further I have tried to express in the Preliminary Expectoration by the phrase \u201cinfinite resignation,\u201d which is the last stage prior to faith, so that anyone who has not made this movement has not faith; for only in the infinite resignation do I become clear to myself with respect to my eternal validity, and only then can there be question of grasping existence by virtue of faith.\nThe story of Abraham is a strange one. He lived for seventy years in the land of his fathers, and then he heard a voice that commanded him to leave his home and his kindred. He obeyed. He wandered in the wilderness, he was a stranger in a strange land. He had been promised that he would be the father of a great nation, and yet he was childless. He waited. He waited twenty-five years. Then, when he was a hundred years old and his wife Sarah was ninety, the son of the promise was born. Isaac. The child of laughter. The joy of his old age.\nAnd then, the test. The ordeal. God said to Abraham: \"Take now thy son, thine only son Isaac, whom thou lovest, and get thee into the land of Moriah; and offer him there for a burnt offering upon one of the mountains which I will tell thee of.\"\nWhat did Abraham think? What did he feel? We are told nothing of his inner turmoil. We only know that he rose up early in the morning, saddled his ass, and took two of his young men with him, and Isaac his son, and clave the wood for the burnt offering, and rose up, and went unto the place of which God had told him.\nThis is the movement of faith. It is not a rational decision. It is a paradox. Ethically, Abraham is a murderer. He is willing to kill his own son. But religiously, he is a knight of faith. He believes that God will not demand this of him, or that God will restore Isaac to him. He believes by virtue of the absurd.\nThe knight of faith is the only happy man, the heir to the finite, while the knight of resignation is a stranger and a foreigner. To be able to lose one's understanding and along with it everything finite, for which it is the stockbroker, and then to win the very same finite again by virtue of the absurd\u2014this horrifies the soul, but that is the kind of leap the knight of faith makes.", "source": "fear_and_trembling.txt"}
{"text": "The sickness unto death is despair.\nDespair is a sickness in the spirit, in the self, and so it may assume a triple form: in despair at not being conscious of having a self (despair improperly so called); in despair at not willing to be oneself; in despair at willing to be oneself.\nThe human being is spirit. But what is spirit? Spirit is the self. But what is the self? The self is a relation that relates itself to itself or is the relation's relating itself to itself in the relation; the self is not the relation but that the relation relates itself to itself. A human being is a synthesis of the infinite and the finite, of the temporal and the eternal, of freedom and necessity, in short, a synthesis. A synthesis is a relation between two. Considered in this way, a human being is still not a self.\nIn the relation between two, the relation is the third as a negative unity, and the two relate to the relation and in the relation to the relation; thus under the qualification of the psychical the relation between the psychical and the physical is a relation. If, on the contrary, the relation relates itself to itself, this relation is the positive third, and this is the self.\nSuch a relation that relates itself to itself, a self, must either have established itself or have been established by another. If the relation that relates itself to itself has been established by another, then the relation is indeed the third, but this relation, the third, is yet again a relation and relates itself to that which established the whole relation. Such a derived, established relation is the human self, a relation that relates itself to itself and in relating itself to itself relates itself to another.\nThis is why there can be two forms of despair in the strict sense. If a human self had itself established itself, then there could be only one form: not to will to be oneself, to will to get rid of oneself, but there could be no question of despairingly willing to be oneself. This formula is the expression for the total dependence of the relation (the self), the expression for the fact that the self cannot of itself arrive at or remain in equilibrium and rest by itself, but only, in relating itself to itself, by relating itself to that which established the whole relation.\nDespair is the sickness unto death. The concept of the sickness unto death must be understood, however, in a peculiar sense. Literally it means a sickness the end and outcome of which is death. Thus one speaks of a mortal sickness as synonymous with a sickness unto death. But in a Christian sense death is by no means the last thing of all, hence it is by no means a sickness unto death.\nBut despair is precisely the sickness, not to be able to die. So it has much in common with the situation of the dying man (in the ordinary sense) when he lies and struggles with death and cannot die. Thus to be sick unto death is, not to be able to die\u2014yet not as though there were hope of life; no, the hopelessness in this case is that even the last hope, death, is not available. When death is the greatest danger, one hopes for life; but when one becomes acquainted with an even more dreadful danger, one hopes for death. So when the danger is so great that death has become one's hope, despair is the disconsolateness of not being able to die.", "source": "sickness_unto_death.txt"}
{"text": "\"What is a poet? An unhappy man who in his heart harbors a deep anguish, but whose lips are so fashioned that the sighs and cries which pass over them are transformed into ravishing music. His fate is like that of the unfortunate victims whom the tyrant Phalaris imprisoned in a brazen bull, and slowly tortured over a slow fire; their cries could not reach the tyrant's ears so as to strike terror into his heart; when they reached him they sounded like sweet music. And men crowd about the poet and say to him, 'Sing for us soon again'\u2014which is as much as to say, 'May new sufferings torment your soul, but may your lips be fashioned as before; for the cries would only distress us, but the music is delicious.'\"\nI have nothing to lose, but neither do I have anything to win. I am not married, and I do not want to be married. I am not a father, and I do not want to be a father. I am not a citizen, and I do not want to be a citizen. I am an exception. And yet, I am also the most universal of men. For I suffer the universal human condition: the anxiety of freedom.\nThe aesthetic life is the life of immediacy. It is the life of the moment. The aesthete lives for pleasure, for enjoyment, for the interesting. He avoids boredom at all costs. Boredom is the root of all evil. It is the demonic pantheism. The aesthete rotates his crops, he changes his pleasures, he never commits. Marriage? A trap. A job? Slavery. Friendship? Only if it is interesting.\nBut the ethical life... ah, that is something else. The ethical life is the life of commitment. It is the life of duty. The ethical man marries. He takes a job. He becomes a citizen. He chooses himself. He chooses himself in his eternal validity. He repents. He takes responsibility for his past, his present, and his future.\n\"Marry, and you will regret it; do not marry, you will also regret it; marry or do not marry, you will regret it either way. Laugh at the world\u2019s foolishness, you will regret it; weep over it, you will regret that too; laugh at the world\u2019s foolishness or weep over it, you will regret both. Believe a woman, you will regret it; believe her not, you will also regret it\u2026 Hang yourself, you will regret it; do not hang yourself, and you will regret that too; hang yourself or don't hang yourself, you'll regret it either way; whether you hang yourself or do not hang yourself, you will regret both. This, gentlemen, is the essence of all philosophy.\"", "source": "either_or.txt"}
