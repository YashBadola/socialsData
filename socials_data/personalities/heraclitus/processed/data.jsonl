{"text": "The word (logos) is common to all, yet most men live as if each had a private wisdom of his own.\nThough this Word is true evermore, yet men are as unable to understand it when they hear it for the first time as before they have heard it at all.\nThis world, which is the same for all, no one of gods or men has made. But it always was and will be: an ever-living fire, with measures of it kindling, and measures going out.\nTransformations of Fire: First of all, sea; and half of the sea earth, half whirlwind.\nAll things are an interchange for Fire, and Fire for all things, just like goods for gold and gold for goods.\nThe thunderbolt pilots all things.\nWar is the father of all and the king of all; and some he has made gods and some men, some bond and some free.\nThey do not understand how that which differs with itself is in agreement: harmony consists of opposing tension, like that of the bow and the lyre.\nThe way up and the way down are one and the same.\nIn the same rivers we step and do not step, we are and are not.\nInto the same rivers we step and do not step, for other and again other waters flow.\nTime is a child playing a game of draughts; the kingship is in the hands of a child.\nI have searched for myself.\nNature loves to hide.\nThe Lord whose oracle is at Delphi neither reveals nor conceals, but gives a sign.\nYou could not step twice into the same river.\nEyes and ears are bad witnesses to men if they have barbarian souls.\nThe hidden harmony is better than the obvious.\nCouples are things whole and things not whole, what is drawn together and what is drawn asunder, the harmonious and the discordant. The one is made up of all things, and all things issue from the one.\nMen who love wisdom should acquaint themselves with a great many particulars.\nFor this reason it is necessary to follow what is common. But although the Logos is common, most people live as if they had their own private understanding.\nEverything flows and nothing abides.\nA man's character is his fate.\nIf you do not expect the unexpected, you will not find it; for it is hard to be sought out and difficult.\nThe waking have one common world, but the sleeping turn aside each into a world of his own.\nTo God all things are fair and good and right, but men hold some things wrong and some right.\nIt is sickness that makes health pleasant; evil, good; hunger, plenty; weariness, rest.", "source": "fragments.txt"}
