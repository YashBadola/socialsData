{"text": "23. But how many kinds of sentence are there? Say assertion, question, and command?\u2014There are countless kinds: countless different kinds of use of what we call \"symbols\", \"words\", \"sentences\". And this multiplicity is not something fixed, given once for all; but new types of language, new language-games, as we may say, come into existence, and others become obsolete and get forgotten. (We can get a rough picture of this from the changes in mathematics.)\nHere the term \"language-game\" is meant to bring into prominence the fact that the speaking of language is part of an activity, or of a form of life.\nReview the multiplicity of language-games in the following examples, and in others:\nGiving orders, and obeying them\u2014\nDescribing the appearance of an object, or giving its measurements\u2014\nConstructing an object from a description (a drawing)\u2014\nReporting an event\u2014\nSpeculating about an event\u2014\nForming and testing a hypothesis\u2014\nPresenting the results of an experiment in tables and diagrams\u2014\nMaking up a story; and reading it\u2014\nPlay-acting\u2014\nSinging catches\u2014\nGuessing riddles\u2014\nMaking a joke; telling it\u2014\nSolving a problem in practical arithmetic\u2014\nTranslating from one language into another\u2014\nAsking, thanking, cursing, greeting, praying.\n\u2014It is interesting to compare the multiplicity of the tools in language and of the ways they are used, the multiplicity of kinds of word and sentence, with what logicians have said about the structure of language. (Including the author of the Tractatus Logico-Philosophicus.)\n293. If I say of myself that it is only from my own case that I know what the word \"pain\" means\u2014must I not say the same of other people too? And how can I generalize the one case so irresponsibly?\nNow someone tells me that he knows what pain is only from his own case!\u2014\u2014Suppose everyone had a box with something in it: we call it a \"beetle\". No one can look into anyone else's box, and everyone says he knows what a beetle is only by looking at his beetle.\u2014Here it would be quite possible for everyone to have something different in his box. One might even imagine such a thing constantly changing.\u2014But suppose the word \"beetle\" had a use in these people's language?\u2014If so it would not be used as the name of a thing. The thing in the box has no place in the language-game at all; not even as a something: for the box might even be empty.\u2014No, one can 'divide through' by the thing in the box; it cancels out, whatever it is.\nThat is to say: if we construe the grammar of the expression of sensation on the model of 'object and designation' the object drops out of consideration as irrelevant.", "source": "investigations.txt"}
