It is not that we have a short time to live, but that we waste a lot of it. Life is long enough, and a sufficiently generous amount has been given to us for the highest achievements if it were all well invested. But when it is wasted in heedless luxury and spent on no good activity, we are forced at last by death’s final constraint to realize that it has passed away before we knew it was passing. So it is: we are not given a short life but we make it short, and we are not ill-supplied but wasteful of it… Life is long if you know how to use it.

Men trifle with the most precious thing in the world; but they are blind to it because it is an incorporeal thing, because it does not come before the sight of the eyes, and for this reason it is counted as a very cheap thing—nay, of almost no value at all. Men set a very high value on pensions and doles, and for these they hire out their labour or their service or their patience. But no one sets a value on time; all use it lavishly as if it cost nothing. But see these same people, when they fall sick and the danger of death draws nearer, how they clasp the knees of the doctors; if they fear a capital charge, how ready they are to buy their lives with all their possessions! Such are the inconsistent emotions that grip them. But if each one could have the number of his future years set before him as is possible in the case of the years that have passed, how alarmed would be those who saw only a few remaining, and how sparing of them would they be! And yet it is easy to dispense an amount that is assured, no matter how small it may be; but that which is to be guarded with greater care is that which may fail you when you least expect it.
