The sickness unto death is despair. But despair is not a simple phenomenon; on the contrary, it is the most dialectical of all sicknesses.

To be a self is the greatest concession made to man, but at the same time it is eternity's demand upon him.

The formula that describes the state of the self when despair is completely rooted out is this: in relating itself to itself and in willing to be itself, the self rests transparently in the power that established it.

Despair is the disrelation in a relation that relates itself to itself. The human being is a spirit. But what is spirit? Spirit is the self. But what is the self? The self is a relation that relates itself to itself or is the relation's relating itself to itself in the relation; the self is not the relation but that the relation relates itself to itself.
