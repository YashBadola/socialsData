DISCOURSE ON METAPHYSICS

1. Concerning the divine perfection and that God does everything in the most desirable way.
The most widely accepted and vivid definition of God that we have is this: that God is an absolutely perfect being. But although this is the most common idea, I do not believe that we have fully considered its consequences. To make it clearer, observe that there are various entirely different perfections in nature, that God possesses them all together, and that each of them belongs to him in the highest degree.

2. Against those who maintain that there is no goodness in the works of God, or that the rules of goodness and beauty are arbitrary.
Therefore I am far removed from the opinion of those who maintain that there are no rules of goodness and perfection in the nature of things, or in the ideas which God has of them, and that the works of God are good only for the formal reason that God has made them. If this were so, God, knowing that he is the author of things, would not have to regard them afterwards and find them good, as the Holy Scripture witnesses.

3. Against those who think that God might have made things better than he has.
I cannot approve the opinion of some moderns who maintain boldly that that which God has made is not perfect in the highest degree, and that he might have done better. For it seems to me that the consequences of this opinion are wholly inconsistent with the glory of God: 'Uti minus malum habet rationem boni, ita minus bonum habet rationem mali.'

4. That to love God one must be satisfied with all that he does and wills.
The general knowledge of this great truth that God acts always in the most perfect and most desirable manner possible, is in my opinion the basis of the love which we owe to God in all things; for he who loves seeks his satisfaction in the felicity or glory of the object loved and in the perfection of his acts.

5. What the rules of perfection of the divine conduct consist in, and that the simplicity of the ways is in balance with the richness of the effects.
It is sufficient therefore to have this confidence in God, that he does everything for the best and that nothing can hurt those who love him. But to know in particular the reasons which have moved him to choose this order of the universe, to suffer sins, to dispense his saving grace in a certain manner, - this passes the capacity of a finite mind, above all when he has not yet come to the enjoyment of the vision of God.

6. That God does nothing which is not orderly, and that it is not even possible to conceive of events which are not regular.
Voluntary actions of God as well as of creatures, are what we call contingencies, i.e., events which are not necessary. It is true that when the will is determined to a course, this determination is inclined by reasons, but it is never necessitated.

7. That miracles conform to the regular order no less than natural events.
When God does a miracle, it is not simply that he derogates from a law he has established, but that he makes use of a law which is more general and more simple than that which we know.

8. In order to distinguish the actions of God from those of created things, it is necessary to explain in what the notion of an individual substance consists.
It is quite difficult to distinguish the actions of God from those of his creatures. For some believe that God does everything, while others imagine that he only conserves the force which he has given to created things.

9. That every individual substance expresses the whole universe in its own way, and that in its full concept is included all its experiences together with all the attendant circumstances and the whole sequence of exterior events.
There are several considerations which prove this. One is that God, who sees the individual notion or haecceity of Alexander, sees in it at the same time the foundation and the reason of all the predicates which can be truly uttered regarding him, as e.g. that he will conquer Darius and Porus.
