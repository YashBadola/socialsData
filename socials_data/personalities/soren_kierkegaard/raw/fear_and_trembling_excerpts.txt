Preface

Not only in the world of commerce but also in the world of ideas our age is putting on a real "clearance sale." Everything can be had at such a bargain that it is questionable whether in the end there is anyone who will want to buy. Every speculative price-fixer who conscientiously directs attention to the significant march of modern philosophy, every private docent, tutor, and student, every crofter and cottager in philosophy, is not stopping at doubting everything but is going further.

The Story of Abraham

And God tempted Abraham, and said unto him, Abraham: and he said, Behold, here I am.

And he said, Take now thy son, thine only son Isaac, whom thou lovest, and get thee into the land of Moriah; and offer him there for a burnt offering upon one of the mountains which I will tell thee of.

It was early in the morning, Abraham rose early, he saddled his ass, and took two of his young men with him, and Isaac his son, and clave the wood for the burnt offering, and rose up, and went unto the place of which God had told him.

Problem I: Is there a Teleological Suspension of the Ethical?

The ethical as such is the universal, it applies to everyone, which may be expressed from another point of view by saying that it applies every instant. It reposes immanently in itself, it has nothing without itself which is its telos, but is itself telos for everything outside it, and when this has been incorporated by it, it can go no further. Conceived immediately as physical and psychical, the particular individual is the individual who has his telos in the universal, and his ethical task is to express himself constantly in it, to abolish his particularity in order to become the universal. As soon as the individual would assert himself as the particular over against the universal, he sins, and only by recognizing this can he again reconcile himself with the universal.

But with Abraham the case is different. By his act he overstepped the ethical entirely and possessed a higher telos outside of it, in relation to which he suspended the former. For how could one ever bring Abraham's action under the universal? He disregarded the intermediate ethical determinants. If I were to speak of him as a murderer, I would be wrong; if I were to speak of him as one who wanted to sacrifice the best he had, I would also be wrong, for the ethical expression for what he did is that he would murder Isaac; the religious expression is that he would sacrifice Isaac—but precisely in this contradiction is the dread which can well make a man sleepless, and yet Abraham is not what he is without this dread.

Faith is precisely this paradox, that the individual as the particular is higher than the universal, is justified by it, is not subordinate but superior—yet in such a way, be it observed, that it is the particular individual who, after he has been subordinated as the particular to the universal, now through the universal becomes the individual who as the particular is superior to the universal, for the fact that the individual as the particular stands in an absolute relation to the absolute. This position cannot be mediated, for all mediation comes about precisely by virtue of the universal; it is and remains to all eternity a paradox, inaccessible to thought.
