{"text": "1. \"But what is the meaning of the word 'five'?\" - No such thing was in question here, only how the word \"five\" is used.\n7. We can also think of the whole process of using words in (2) as one of those games by means of which children learn their native language. I will call these games \"language-games\" and will sometimes speak of a primitive language as a language-game. And the processes of naming the stones and of repeating words after someone might also be called language-games. Think of much of the use of words in games like ring-a-ring-a-roses. I shall also call the whole, consisting of language and the actions into which it is woven, the \"language-game\".\n11. Think of the tools in a tool-box: there is a hammer, pliers, a saw, a screw-driver, a rule, a glue-pot, glue, nails and screws. - The functions of words are as diverse as the functions of these objects. (And in both cases there are similarities.)\nOf course, what confuses us is the uniform appearance of words when we hear them spoken or meet them in script and print. For their application is not presented to us so clearly. Especially when we are doing philosophy!\n18. It is like looking into the cabin of a locomotive. We see handles all looking more or less alike. (Naturally, since they are all supposed to be handled.) But one is the handle of a crank which can be moved continuously (it regulates the opening of a valve); another is the handle of a switch, which has only two effective positions, it is either off or on; a third is the handle of a brake-lever, the harder one pulls on it, the harder it brakes; a fourth, the handle of a pump: it has an effect only so long as it is moved to and fro.\n19. It is easy to imagine a language consisting only of orders and reports in battle. - Or a language consisting only of questions and expressions for answering yes and no. And innumerable others. - And to imagine a language means to imagine a form of life.\n23. But how many kinds of sentence are there? Say assertion, question, and command? - There are countless kinds: countless different kinds of use of what we call \"symbols\", \"words\", \"sentences\". And this multiplicity is not something fixed, given once for all; but new types of language, new language-games, as we may say, come into existence, and others become obsolete and get forgotten. (We can get a rough picture of this from the changes in mathematics.)\nHere the term \"language-game\" is meant to bring into prominence the fact that the speaking of language is part of an activity, or of a form of life.\nReview the multiplicity of language-games in the following examples, and in others:\nGiving orders, and obeying them -\nDescribing the appearance of an object, or giving its measurements -\nConstructing an object from a description (a drawing) -\nReporting an event -\nSpeculating about an event -\nForming and testing a hypothesis -\nPresenting the results of an experiment in tables and diagrams -\nMaking up a story; and reading it -\nPlay-acting -\nSinging catches -\nGuessing riddles -\nMaking a joke; telling it -\nSolving a problem in practical arithmetic -\nTranslating from one language into another -\nAsking, thanking, cursing, greeting, praying.\n43. For a large class of cases - though not for all - in which we employ the word \"meaning\" it can be defined thus: the meaning of a word is its use in the language. And the meaning of a name is sometimes explained by pointing to its bearer.\n66. Consider for example the proceedings that we call \"games\". I mean board-games, card-games, ball-games, Olympic games, and so on. What is common to them all? - Don't say: \"There must be something common, or they would not be called 'games'\" - but look and see whether there is anything common to all. - For if you look at them you will not see something that is common to all, but similarities, relationships, and a whole series of them at that. To repeat: don't think, but look!\n67. I can think of no better expression to characterize these similarities than \"family resemblances\"; for the various resemblances between members of a family: build, features, colour of eyes, gait, temperament, etc. etc. overlap and criss-cross in the same way. - And I shall say: 'games' form a family.\n109. It was true to say that our considerations could not be scientific ones. . . . And we may not advance any kind of theory. There must not be anything hypothetical in our considerations. We must do away with all explanation, and description alone must take its place. And this description gets its light, that is to say its purpose, from the philosophical problems. These are, of course, not empirical problems; they are solved, rather, by looking into the workings of our language, and that in such a way as to make us recognize those workings: in despite of an urge to misunderstand them. The problems are solved, not by giving new information, but by arranging what we have always known. Philosophy is a battle against the bewitchment of our intelligence by means of language.\n115. A picture held us captive. And we could not get outside it, for it lay in our language and language seemed to repeat it to us inexorably.\n123. A philosophical problem has the form: \"I don't know my way about\".\n199. Is what we call \"obeying a rule\" something that it would be possible for only one man to do, and to do only once in his life? . . . This is a note on the grammar of the expression \"to obey a rule\". It is not possible that there should have been only one occasion on which a report was made, an order given or understood; and so on. - To obey a rule, to make a report, to give an order, to play a game of chess, are customs (uses, institutions).\n202. And hence also 'obeying a rule' is a practice. And to think one is obeying a rule is not to obey a rule. Hence it is not possible to obey a rule 'privately': otherwise thinking one was obeying a rule would be the same thing as obeying it.\n241. \"So you are saying that human agreement decides what is true and what is false?\" - It is what human beings say that is true and false; and they agree in the language they use. That is not agreement in opinions but in form of life.\n242. If language is to be a means of communication there must be agreement not only in definitions but also (queer as this may sound) in judgments. This seems to abolish logic, but does not do so. - It is one thing to describe methods of measurement, and another to obtain and state results of measurement. But what we call \"measuring\" is partly determined by a certain constancy in results of measurement.\n255. The philosopher's treatment of a question is like the treatment of an illness.\n258. Let us imagine the following case. I want to keep a diary about the recurrence of a certain sensation. To this end I associate it with the sign \"S\" and write this sign in a calendar for every day on which I have the sensation. - I will remark first of all that a definition of the sign cannot be formulated. - but still I can give myself a kind of ostensive definition. - How? Can I point to the sensation? Not in the ordinary sense. But I speak, or write the sign; down, and at the same time I concentrate my attention on the sensation - and so, as it were, point to it inwardly. - But what is this ceremony for? for that is all it is! A definition surely serves to establish the meaning of a sign. - Well, that is done precisely by the concentrating of my attention; for in this way I impress on myself the connexion between the sign and the sensation. - But \"I impress it on myself\" can only mean: this process brings it about that I remember the connexion right in the future. But in the present case I have no criterion of correctness. One would like to say: whatever is going to seem right to me is right. And that only means that here we can't talk about 'right'.\n293. If I say of myself that it is only from my own case that I know what the word \"pain\" means - must I not say the same of other people too? And how can I generalize the one case so irresponsibly?\nNow someone tells me that he knows what pain is only from his own case! --Suppose everyone had a box with something in it: we call it a \"beetle\". No one can look into anyone else's box, and everyone says he knows what a beetle is only by looking at his beetle. - Here it would be quite possible for everyone to have something different in his box. One might even imagine such a thing constantly changing. - But suppose the word \"beetle\" had a use in these people's language? - If so it would not be used as the name of a thing. The thing in the box has no place in the language-game at all; not even as a something: for the box might even be empty. - No, one can 'divide through' by the thing in the box; it cancels out, whatever it is.\nThat is to say: if we construe the grammar of the expression of sensation on the model of 'object and designation' the object drops out of consideration as irrelevant.\n309.

{"text": "What is the meaning of a word?\nLet us attack this question by asking, first, what is an explanation of the meaning of a word; what does the explanation of a word look like?\nThe way this question helps us is analogous to the way the question \"how do we measure a length?\" helps us to understand the problem \"what is length?\"\nThe questions \"What is length?\", \"What is meaning?\", \"What is the number one?\" etc., produce in us a mental cramp. We feel that we can't point to anything in reply to them and yet ought to point to something. (We are up against one of the great sources of philosophical bewilderment: a substantive makes us look for a thing that corresponds to it.)\nOne difficulty which strikes us is that for many words in our language there isn't one general explanation of their meaning.\nThere is a common temptation to think that the meaning of a word is an image, or a mental state, or a feeling.\nBut if we look at the way words are actually used, we see that the meaning of a word is not an image, but the way it is used in the language-game.\nI want to say: The meaning of a word is its use in the language.\nAnd the meaning of a name is sometimes explained by pointing to its bearer.\nThinking is essentially the activity of operating with signs. This activity is performed by the hand, when we think by writing; by the mouth and larynx, when we think by speaking; and if we think by imagining signs or pictures, I can give you no agent that thinks. If then you say that in such cases the mind thinks, I would only draw your attention to the fact that you are using a metaphor, that here the mind is an agent in a different sense from that in which the hand can be said to be the agent.\nPhilosophy, as we use the word, is a fight against the fascination which forms of expression exert upon us.\nI want to say here that it can never be our job to reduce anything to anything, or to explain anything. Philosophy really is \"purely descriptive\".\nIf we look at the river of life and the language that flows with it, we see that the concepts we use are fluid, not fixed.\nWe are unable to clearly circumscribe the concepts we use; not because we don't know their real definition, but because there is no real 'definition' to them. To suppose that there must be would be like supposing that whenever children play with a ball they play a game according to strict rules.\nThe idea that in order to get clear about the meaning of a general term one had to find the common element in all its applications has shackled philosophical investigation; for it has not only led to no result, but also made the philosopher dismiss as irrelevant the concrete cases, which alone could have helped him to understand the usage of the general term.\nWe don't use language according to strict rules - it hasn't been taught to us by means of strict rules, either. We, in our discussions on the other hand, constantly compare language with a calculus proceeding according to exact rules.\nThis is a very one-sided way of looking at language. In practice we very rarely use language as such a calculus. For not only do we not think of the rules of usage - of definitions, etc. - while using language, but when we are asked to give such rules, in most cases we aren't able to do so. We are unable clearly to circumscribe the concepts we use; not because we don't know their real definition, but because there is no real 'definition' to them.\nThe symbol 'a' stands for the object a.\nThe symbol 'red' stands for the property red.\nThe symbol 'p' stands for the state of affairs p.\nThis is all misleading.\nThere is a tendency to look for a \"substance\" whenever we see a substantive.\nThere is no such thing as a \"mental process\" of understanding which accompanies the hearing of a sentence.\nUnderstanding is not a mental process.\nTo understand a sentence means to understand a language. To understand a language means to be master of a technique.", "source": "blue_book.txt"}
{"text": "1 The world is everything that is the case.\n1.1 The world is the totality of facts, not of things.\n1.11 The world is determined by the facts, and by these being all the facts.\n1.12 For the totality of facts determines both what is the case, and also all that is not the case.\n1.13 The facts in logical space are the world.\n1.2 The world divides into facts.\n1.21 Any one can either be the case or not be the case, and everything else remain the same.\n2 What is the case, the fact, is the existence of atomic facts.\n2.01 An atomic fact is a combination of objects (entities, things).\n2.011 It is essential to a thing that it can be a constituent part of an atomic fact.\n2.012 In logic nothing is accidental: if a thing can occur in an atomic fact the possibility of that atomic fact must already be prejudged in the thing.\n2.0121 It would, so to speak, appear as an accident, when to a thing that could exist alone on its own account, subsequently a state of affairs could be made to fit.\nIf things can occur in atomic facts, this possibility must already lie in them.\n(A logical entity cannot be merely possible. Logic treats of every possibility, and all possibilities are its facts.)\nJust as we cannot think of spatial objects at all apart from space, or temporal objects apart from time, so we cannot think of any object apart from the possibility of its connection with other things.\nIf I can think of an object in the context of an atomic fact, I cannot think of it apart from the possibility of this context.\n2.0122 The thing is independent, in so far as it can occur in all possible circumstances, but this form of independence is a form of connection with the atomic fact, a form of dependence. (It is impossible for words to occur in two different ways, alone and in the proposition.)\n2.0123 If I know an object, then I also know all the possibilities of its occurrence in atomic facts.\n(Every such possibility must lie in the nature of the object.)\nA new possibility cannot subsequently be found.\n2.01231 In order to know an object, I must know not its external but all its internal qualities.\n2.0124 If all objects are given, then thereby are all possible atomic facts also given.\n2.013 Each thing is, as it were, in a space of possible atomic facts. I can think of this space as empty, but not of the thing without the space.\n2.0141 The possibility of its occurrence in atomic facts is the form of the object.\n2.02 The object is simple.\n2.0201 Every statement about complexes can be analysed into a statement about their constituent parts, and into those propositions which completely describe the complexes.\n2.021 Objects form the substance of the world. Therefore they cannot be compound.\n2.0211 If the world had no substance, then whether a proposition had sense would depend on whether another proposition was true.\n2.0212 It would then be impossible to form a picture of the world (true or false).\n2.022 It is clear that however different from the real one an imagined world may be, it must have something - a form - in common with the real world.\n2.0231 The substance of the world can only determine a form and not any material properties. For these are first presented by the propositions - first formed by the configuration of the objects.\n2.0232 Roughly speaking: objects are colourless.\n2.0233 Two objects of the same logical form are - apart from their external properties - only differentiated from one another in that they are different.\n2.024 Substance is what exists independently of what is the case.\n2.025 It is form and content.\n2.0251 Space, time and colour (coloredness) are forms of objects.\n2.026 Only if there are objects can there be a fixed form of the world.\n2.027 The fixed, the existing and the object are one.\n2.0271 The object is the fixed, the existing; the configuration is the changing, the variable.\n2.0272 The configuration of the objects forms the atomic fact.\n2.03 In the atomic fact objects hang one in another, like the links of a chain.\n2.031 In the atomic fact the objects are combined in a definite way.\n2.032 The way in which objects hang together in the atomic fact is the structure of the atomic fact.\n2.033 The form is the possibility of the structure.\n2.034 The structure of the fact consists of the structures of the atomic facts.\n2.04 The totality of existing atomic facts is the world.\n2.05 The totality of existing atomic facts also determines which atomic facts do not exist.\n2.06 The existence of atomic facts we also call a positive fact, their non-existence a negative fact.\n2.061 Atomic facts are independent of one another.\n2.062 From the existence or non-existence of an atomic fact we cannot infer the existence or non-existence of another.\n2.063 The total reality is the world.\n2.1 We make to ourselves pictures of facts.\n2.11 The picture presents the facts in logical space, the existence and non-existence of atomic facts.\n2.12 The picture is a model of reality.\n2.13 To the objects correspond in the picture the elements of the picture.\n2.131 The elements of the picture stand, in the picture, for the objects.\n2.14 The picture consists in the fact that its elements are combined with one another in a definite way.\n2.141 The picture is a fact.\n2.15 That the elements of the picture are combined with one another in a definite way, represents that the things are so combined with one another.\nThis connection of the elements of the picture is called its structure, and the possibility of this structure is called the form of representation of the picture.\n2.151 The form of representation is the possibility that the things are combined with one another as are the elements of the picture.\n2.1511 The picture is thus linked with reality; it reaches up to it.\n2.1512 It is like a scale applied to reality.\n2.15121 Only the outermost points of the dividing lines touch the object to be measured.\n2.1513 According to this view the representing relation which makes it a picture, also belongs to the picture.\n2.1514 The representing relation consists of the coordinations of the elements of the picture and the things.\n2.1515 These coordinations are as it were the feelers of its elements with which the picture touches reality.\n2.16 In order to be a picture a fact must have something in common with what it pictures.\n2.161 In the picture and the pictured there must be something identical in order that the one can be a picture of the other at all.\n2.17 What the picture must have in common with reality in order to be able to represent it after its manner - rightly or falsely - is its form of representation.\n2.171 The picture can represent every reality whose form it has.\nThe spatial picture, everything spatial, the coloured, everything coloured, etc.\n2.172 The picture, however, cannot represent its form of representation; it shows it forth.\n2.173 The picture represents its object from without (its point of view is its form of representation), therefore the picture represents its object rightly or falsely.\n2.174 But the picture cannot place itself outside of its form of representation.\n2.18 What every picture, of whatever form, must have in common with reality in order to be able to represent it at all - rightly or falsely - is the logical form, that is, the form of reality.\n2.181 If the form of representation is the logical form, then the picture is called a logical picture.\n2.182 Every picture is also a logical picture. (On the other hand, for example, not every picture is spatial.)\n2.19 The logical picture can depict the world.\n2.2 The picture has the logical form of representation in common with what it pictures.\n2.201 The picture depicts reality by representing a possibility of the existence and non-existence of atomic facts.\n2.202 The picture represents a possible state of affairs in the logical space.\n2.203 The picture contains the possibility of the state of affairs which it represents.\n2.21 The picture agrees with reality or not; it is right or wrong, true or false.\n2.22 The picture represents what it represents, independently of its truth or falsity, through the form of representation.\n2.221 What the picture represents is its sense.\n2.222 In the agreement or disagreement of its sense with reality, its truth or falsity consists.\n2.223 In order to discover whether the picture is true or false we must compare it with reality.\n2.224 It cannot be discovered from the picture alone whether it is true or false.\n2.225 There is no picture which is a priori true.\n3 The logical picture of the facts is the thought.\n3.001 'An atomic fact is thinkable' - means: we can imagine it.\n3.01 The totality of true thoughts is a picture of the world.\n3.02 The thought contains the possibility of the state of affairs which it thinks. What is thinkable is also possible.\n3.03 We cannot think anything unlogical, for otherwise we should have to think unlogically.\n3.031 It used to be said that God could create everything, except what was contrary to the laws of logic. The truth is, we could not say of an 'unlogical' world how it would look.\n3.032 To present in language something which 'contradicts logic' is as impossible as in geometry to present by its coordinates a figure which contradicts the laws of space; or to give the coordinates of a point which does not exist.\n3.0321 We could present spatially an atomic fact which contradicted the laws of physics, but not one which contradicted the laws of geometry.\n3.04 It is an a priori true thought that the possibility of a thought (logical premise) determines the possibility of what is thought.\n3.05 We could only know a priori that a thought is true if its truth was to be recognized from the thought itself (without an object of comparison).\n3.1 In the proposition the thought is expressed perceptibly through the senses.\n3.11 We use the sensibly perceptible sign (sound or written sign, etc.) of the proposition as a projection of the possible state of affairs.\nThe method of projection is the thinking of the sense of the proposition.\n3.12 The sign through which we express the thought I call the propositional sign. And the proposition is the propositional sign in its projective relation to the world.\n3.13 To the proposition belongs everything which belongs to the projection, but not what is projected.\nTherefore the possibility of what is projected but not this itself.\nIn the proposition, therefore, its sense is not yet contained, but the possibility of expressing it.\n(The content of the proposition means the content of the significant proposition.)\nIn the proposition the form of its sense is contained, but not its content.\n3.14 The propositional sign consists in the fact that its elements, the words, are combined in it in a definite way.\nThe propositional sign is a fact.\n3.141 The proposition is not a mixture of words (just as the musical theme is not a mixture of tones).\nThe proposition is articulate.\n3.142 Only facts can express a sense, a class of names cannot.\n3.143 That the propositional sign is a fact is concealed by the ordinary form of expression, written or printed.\n(For in the printed proposition, for example, the sign of a proposition does not appear essentially different from the word. Thus it was possible for Frege to call the proposition a compounded name.)\n3.1431 The essential nature of the propositional sign becomes very clear when we imagine it made up of spatial objects (such as tables, chairs, books) instead of written signs.\nThe mutual spatial position of these things then expresses the sense of the proposition.\n3.1432 We must not say, 'The complex sign \"aRb\" says \"a stands in relation R to b\"', but we must say, 'That \"a\" stands in a certain relation to \"b\" says that aRb'.\n3.144 States of affairs can be described but not named.\n(Names resemble points; propositions resemble arrows, they have sense.)\n3.2 In propositions thoughts can be so expressed that to the objects of the thoughts correspond the elements of the propositional sign.\n3.201 These elements I call 'simple signs' and the proposition 'completely analysed'.\n3.202 The simple signs employed in propositions are called names.\n3.203 The name means the object. The object is its meaning. ('A' is the same sign as 'A'.)\n3.21 To the configuration of the simple signs in the propositional sign corresponds the configuration of the objects in the state of affairs.\n3.22 In the proposition the name represents the object.\n3.221 Objects I can only name. Signs represent them. I can only speak of them. I cannot assert them. A proposition can only say how a thing is, not what it is.\n3.23 The postulate of the possibility of the simple signs is the postulate of the determinateness of the sense.\n3.24 Propositions about a complex stand in internal relation to the propositions about its constituents.\nA complex can be given only by the description, and this will either be right or wrong. The proposition in which there is mention of a complex, if this does not exist, becomes not nonsense but false.\nThat a propositional element signifies a complex can be seen from an indeterminateness in the propositions in which it occurs. We know that everything is not yet determined by this proposition. (The notation for generality contains a prototype.)\nThe combination of the symbols of a complex in a simple symbol can be expressed by a definition.\n3.25 There is one and only one complete analysis of the proposition.\n3.251 The proposition expresses what it expresses in a definite and clearly specifiable way: the proposition is articulate.\n3.26 The name cannot be analysed further by any definition. It is a primitive sign.\n3.261 Every defined sign signifies via those signs by which it is defined, and the definitions show the way.\nTwo signs, one a primitive sign, and one defined by primitive signs, cannot signify in the same way. Names cannot be taken to pieces by definition (nor any sign which has a meaning alone and independently).\n3.262 What does not get expressed in the sign is shown by its application. What the signs conceal, their application declares.\n3.263 The meaning of primitive signs can be explained by elucidations. Elucidations are propositions which contain the primitive signs. They can, therefore, only be understood if the meanings of these signs are already known.\n3.3 Only the proposition has sense; only in the context of a proposition has a name meaning.\n3.31 Every part of a proposition which characterizes its sense I call an expression (a symbol).\n(The proposition itself is an expression.)\nExpressions are everything - essential for the sense of the proposition - that propositions can have in common with one another.\nAn expression characterizes a form and a content.\n3.311 An expression presupposes the forms of all propositions in which it can occur. It is the common characteristic mark of a class of propositions.\n3.312 It is therefore represented by the general form of the propositions which it characterizes.\nAnd in this form the expression is constant and everything else variable.\n3.313 An expression is thus presented by a variable, whose values are the propositions which contain the expression.\n(In the limiting case the variable becomes a constant, the expression a proposition.)\nI call such a variable a 'propositional variable'.\n3.314 The expression has meaning only in a proposition. Every variable can be conceived as a propositional variable.\n(Including the variable name.)\n3.315 If we change a constituent part of a proposition into a variable, there is a class of propositions which are all the values of the resulting variable proposition. This class in general still depends on what, by arbitrary agreement, we mean by parts of that proposition. But if we change all those constituent parts into variables whose symbols are arbitrarily determined, there is still such a class. This, however, is not dependent on any agreement; it depends only on the nature of the proposition.\nIt corresponds to a logical form, a logical prototype.\n3.316 What values the propositional variable can assume is determined.\nThe determination of the values is the variable.\n3.317 The determination of the values of the propositional variable is done by indicating the propositions whose common mark the variable is.\nThe determination is a description of these propositions.\nThe determination will therefore be concerned only with symbols; not with their meaning.\nAnd the only thing essential to the determination is that it is merely a description of symbols and states nothing about what is symbolized.\nThe way in which we describe the propositions is not essential.\n3.318 I conceive the proposition - like Frege and Russell - as a function of the expressions contained in it.\n3.32 The sign is the part of the symbol perceptible by the senses.\n3.321 Two different symbols can therefore have the sign (the written sign or the sound sign) in common - they then signify in different ways.\n3.322 It can never indicate the common characteristic of two objects that we symbolize them with the same signs but by different methods of symbolizing. For the sign is arbitrary. We could therefore equally well choose two different signs and where then would be what was common in the symbolization?\n3.323 In the language of everyday life it very often happens that the same word signifies in two different ways - and therefore belongs to two different symbols - or that two words which signify in different ways are apparently applied in the same way in the proposition.\nThus the word 'is' appears as the copula, as signifying the act of existing, and as the sign of equality; 'to exist' as an intransitive verb like 'to go'; 'identical' as an adjective; we speak of something but also of the fact of something happening.\n(In the proposition 'Green is green' - where the first word is a proper name and the last an adjective - these words have not merely different meanings but they are different symbols.)\n3.324 Thus there easily arise the most fundamental confusions (of which the whole of philosophy is full).\n3.325 In order to avoid these errors, we must employ a symbolism which excludes them, by not applying the same sign in different symbols and by not applying signs in the same way which signify in different ways. A symbolism, that is to say, which obeys the rules of logical grammar - of logical syntax.\n(The logical symbolism of Frege and Russell is such a language, which, however, does not yet exclude all errors.)\n3.326 In order to recognize the symbol in the sign we must consider the significant use.\n3.327 The sign determines a logical form only together with its logical syntactic application.\n3.328 If a sign is not necessary then it is meaningless. That is the meaning of Occam's Razor.\n(If everything in the symbolism works as though a sign had meaning, then it has meaning.)\n3.33 In logical syntax the meaning of a sign ought never to play a role; it must admit of being established without mention being there made of the meaning of a sign: it ought to presuppose only the description of the expressions.\n3.331 From this observation we get a further view - into Russell's Theory of Types. Russell's error is shown by the fact that in drawing up his symbolic rules he has to speak about the things his signs mean.\n3.332 No proposition can make a statement about itself, because a propositional sign cannot be contained in itself (that is the whole of the 'Theory of Types').\n3.333 The reason why a function cannot be its own argument is that the sign for a function already contains the prototype of its argument, and it cannot contain itself.\nFor let us suppose the function F(fx) to be its own argument: in that case there would be a proposition F(F(fx)), in which the outer function F and the inner function F must have different meanings, since the inner one has the form O(fx) and the outer one has the form Y(O(fx)). Only the letter 'F' is common to the two functions, but the letter by itself signifies nothing.\nThis becomes immediately clear if instead of F(Fu) we write (do):F(Ou). Ou=Fu.\nThat disposes of Russell's paradox.\n3.334 The rules of logical syntax must follow of themselves, if we only know how every single sign signifies.\n3.34 A proposition possesses essential and accidental features.\nAccidental are the features which are due to a particular way of producing the propositional sign. Essential are those which alone enable the proposition to express its sense.\n3.341 The essential in a proposition is therefore that which is common to all propositions which can express the same sense.\nAnd in the same way in general the essential in a symbol is that which all symbols which can fulfil the same purpose have in common.\n3.3411 One could therefore say the real name is that which all symbols, which signify an object, have in common. It would then follow, step by step, that no sort of composition was essential for a name.\n3.342 In our notations there is indeed something arbitrary, but this is not arbitrary, namely that if we have determined anything arbitrarily, then something else must be the case. (This results from the essence of the notation.)\n3.3421 A particular mode of signifying may be unimportant, but it is always important that it is a possible mode of signifying. And that is generally so in philosophy: again and again the individual is proved, by the resulting possibility of something else, to be unimportant, but the possibility of each individual case discloses something about the essence of the world.\n3.343 Definitions are rules for the translation of one language into another. Every correct symbolism must be translatable into every other according to such rules. It is this which they all have in common.\n3.344 What signifies in the symbol is what is common to all those symbols by which it can be replaced according to the rules of logical syntax.\n3.3441 We can, for example, express what is common to all notations for the truth-functions so: It is common to them that they can all be replaced - for example - by the notation of '~p' ('not p') and 'p v q' ('p or q').\n(Herewith is indicated the way in which a special possible notation can give us general information.)\n3.3442 The sign of the complex is not arbitrarily resolved in the analysis, in such a way that its resolution would be different in every propositional structure.\n3.4 The proposition determines a place in logical space: the existence of this logical place is guaranteed by the existence of the constituent parts alone, by the existence of the significant proposition.\n3.41 The propositional sign and the logical coordinates: that is the logical place.\n3.411 The geometrical and the logical place agree in that each is the possibility of an existence.\n3.42 Although a proposition may only determine one place in logical space, the whole logical space must already be given by it.\n(Otherwise denial, the sum of logical coordinates, the logical space, would always introduce ever new co-ordinates.)\n(The logical scaffolding round the picture determines the logical space. The proposition reaches through the whole logical space.)\n3.5 The applied, thought, propositional sign is the thought.\n4 The thought is the significant proposition.\n4.001 The totality of propositions is the language.\n4.002 Man possesses the capacity of constructing languages, in which every sense can be expressed, without having an idea how and what each word means - just as one speaks without knowing how the single sounds are produced.\nColloquial language is a part of the human organism and is not less complicated than it.\nFrom it it is humanly impossible to gather immediately the logic of language.\nLanguage disguises the thought; so that from the external form of the clothes one cannot infer the form of the thought they clothe, because the external form of the clothes is constructed with quite another object than to let the form of the body be recognized.\nThe silent adjustments to understand colloquial language are enormously complicated.\n4.003 Most proposition and questions, that have been written about philosophical matters, are not false, but senseless. We cannot, therefore, answer questions of this kind at all, but only state their senselessness. Most questions and propositions of the philosophers result from the fact that we do not understand the logic of our language.\n(They are of the same kind as the question whether the Good is more or less identical than the Beautiful.)\nAnd so it is not to be wondered at that the deepest problems are really no problems.\n4.0031 All philosophy is 'Critique of language' (but not at all in Mauthner's sense). Russell's merit is to have shown that the apparent logical form of the proposition need not be its real form.\n4.01 The proposition is a picture of reality.\nThe proposition is a model of the reality as we think it is.\n4.011 At the first glance the proposition - say as it stands printed on paper - does not seem to be a picture of the reality of which it treats. But nor does the musical score appear at first sight to be a picture of a musical piece; nor does our phonetic spelling (letters) seem to be a picture of our spoken language.\nAnd yet these symbolisms prove to be pictures - even in the ordinary sense of the word - of what they represent.\n4.012 It is obvious that we perceive a proposition of the form aRb as a picture. Here the sign is obviously a likeness of the signified.\n4.013 And if we penetrate to the essence of this pictorial nature we see that this is not disturbed by apparent irregularities (like the use of # and b in the score).\nFor these irregularities also depict what they are to express; only in another way.\n4.014 The gramophone record, the musical thought, the score, the waves of sound, all stand to one another in that pictorial internal relation, which holds between language and the world.\nTo all of them the logical structure is common.\n(Like the two youths, their two horses and their lilies in the story. They are all in a certain sense one.)\n4.0141 In the fact that there is a general rule by which the musician is able to read the symphony out of the score, and that there is a rule by which one could reconstruct the symphony from the line on a gramophone record and from this again - by means of the first rule - construct the score, herein lies the internal similarity between these things which at first sight seem to be entirely different. And the rule is the law of projection which projects the symphony into the language of the musical score. It is the rule of translation of this language into the language of the gramophone record.\n4.015 The possibility of all similes, of all the imagery of our language, rests on the logic of representation.\n4.016 In order to understand the essence of the proposition, consider hieroglyphic writing, which pictures the facts it describes.\nAnd from it came the alphabet without the essence of the representation being lost.\n4.02 This we see from the fact that we understand the sense of the propositional sign, without having had it explained to us.\n4.021 The proposition is a picture of reality, for I know the state of affairs presented by it, if I understand the proposition. And I understand the proposition, without its sense having been explained to me.\n4.022 The proposition shows its sense.\nThe proposition shows how things stand, if it is true. And it says, that they do so stand.\n4.023 The proposition determines reality to this extent, that one only needs to say 'Yes' or 'No' to it to make it agree with reality.\nReality must therefore be completely described by the proposition.\nA proposition is the description of a fact.\nAs the description of an object describes it by its external properties so propositions describe reality by its internal properties.\nThe proposition constructs a world with the help of a logical scaffolding and therefore one can actually see in the proposition all the logical features possessed by reality if it is true. One can draw conclusions from a false proposition.\n4.024 To understand a proposition means to know what is the case, if it is true.\n(One can therefore understand it without knowing whether it is true or not.)\nOne understands it if one understands its constituent parts.\n4.025 The translation of one language into another is not a process of translating each proposition of the one into a proposition of the other, but only the constituent parts of propositions are translated.\n(And the dictionary does not only translate substantives but also adverbs and conjunctions, etc., and it treats all of them in the same way.)\n4.026 The meanings of the simple signs (the words) must be explained to us, if we are to understand the complex signs.\n4.027 It is essential to propositions, that they can communicate a new sense to us.\n4.03 A proposition must communicate a new sense with old words.\nThe proposition communicates to us a state of affairs, therefore it must be essentially connected with the state of affairs.\nAnd the connection is, in fact, that it is its logical picture.\nThe proposition only asserts something, in so far as it is a picture.\n4.031 In the proposition a state of affairs is, as it were, put together for the sake of experiment.\nOne can say, instead of, This proposition has such and such a sense, This proposition represents such and such a state of affairs.\n4.0311 One name stands for one thing, and another for another thing, and they are connected together. And so the whole, like a living picture, presents the atomic fact.\n4.0312 The possibility of propositions is based upon the principle of the representation of objects by signs.\nMy fundamental thought is that the 'logical constants' do not represent. That the logic of the facts cannot be represented.\n4.032 The proposition is a picture of its state of affairs, only in so far as it is logically articulated.\n(The simple non-articulated sign can be neither true nor false.)\n4.04 In the proposition there must be exactly as many things distinguishable as there are in the state of affairs, which it represents.\nThey must both possess the same logical (mathematical) multiplicity (cf. Hertz's Mechanics, on Dynamic Models).\n4.041 This mathematical multiplicity naturally cannot in its turn be depicted. One cannot get outside it when depicting.\n4.0411 If we tried, for example, to express what is expressed by '(x).fx' by putting an index before fx, like: 'Gen. fx', it would not do, we should not know what was generalized. If we tried to show it by an index g, like: 'f(xg)' it would not do - we should not know the scope of the generalization index.\nIf we were to try it by introducing a mark in the argument places, like '(G,G).F(G,G)', it would not do - we could not determine the identity of the variables.\nAll these ways of symbolizing are inadequate because they have not the necessary mathematical multiplicity.\n4.0412 For the same reason the idealist explanation of the seeing of spatial relations through 'spatial spectacles' does not do, because it cannot explain the multiplicity of these relations.\n4.05 Reality is compared with the proposition.\n4.06 Propositions can be true or false only by being pictures of the reality.\n4.061 It must not be overlooked that the sense of a proposition is independent of the facts.\nOtherwise one could not easily understand a proposition without knowing if it was true or false.\n(The sense of a proposition is not its truth.)\n4.062 Can we not make ourselves understood by means of false propositions as it were as well as by true ones, so long as it is known that they are meant to be false? No! For a proposition is true, if what we assert by means of it is the case; and if by 'p' we mean ~p, and what we mean is the case, then 'p' in the new conception is true and not false.\n4.0621 But it is important that the signs 'p' and '~p' can say the same thing. For it shows that nothing in reality corresponds to the sign '~'.\nThat negation occurs in a proposition, is no characteristic of its sense (~~p = p).\nThe propositions 'p' and '~p' have opposite senses, but to them corresponds one and the same reality.\n4.063 An illustration to explain the concept of truth. A black spot on white paper; the form of the spot can be described by saying of each point of the plane whether it is white or black. To the fact that a point is black corresponds a positive fact; to the fact that a point is white (not black), a negative fact.\nIf I indicate a point of the plane (a truth-value in Frege's terminology), this corresponds to the assumption that is proposed for judgment, etc. etc.\nBut to be able to say that a point is black or white, I must first know under what conditions a point is called white or black; in order to be able to say 'p' is true (or false) I must have determined under what conditions I call 'p' true, and thereby I determine the sense of the proposition.\nThe point at which the simile breaks down is this: we can indicate a point on the paper, without knowing what white and black are; but to a proposition without a sense corresponds nothing at all, for it signifies no thing (truth-value) whose properties are called 'false' or 'true'; the verb of the proposition is not 'is true' or 'is false' - as Frege thought - but that which 'is true' must already contain the verb.\n4.064 Every proposition must already have a sense; assertion cannot give it a sense, for what it asserts is the sense itself.\n(The same holds of denial, etc.)\n4.0641 One could say, the denial is already related to the logical place determined by the proposition that is denied.\nThe denying proposition determines a logical place other than does the proposition denied.\nThe denying proposition determines a logical place, with the help of the logical place of the proposition denied, by saying that it lies outside the latter place.\nThat one can deny again the denied proposition, shows that what is denied is already a proposition and not merely the preliminary to a proposition.\n4.1 A proposition presents the existence and non-existence of atomic facts.\n4.11 The totality of true propositions is the total natural science (or the totality of the natural sciences).\n4.111 Philosophy is not one of the natural sciences.\n(The word 'philosophy' must mean something which stands above or below, but not beside the natural sciences.)\n4.112 The object of philosophy is the logical clarification of thoughts.\nPhilosophy is not a theory but an activity.\nA philosophical work consists essentially of elucidations.\nThe result of philosophy is not a number of 'philosophical propositions', but to make propositions clear.\nPhilosophy should make clear and delimit sharply the thoughts which otherwise are, as it were, opaque and blurred.\n4.1121 Psychology is no more closely related to philosophy than any other natural science.\nTheory of knowledge is the philosophy of psychology.\nDoes not my study of sign-language correspond to the study of thought-processes, which philosophers used to hold to be so essential to the philosophy of logic? Only they got entangled in the most unimportant psychological investigations. For there is an analogous danger with my method.\n4.1122 Darwin's theory has no more to do with philosophy than any other hypothesis in natural science.\n4.113 Philosophy limits the disputable sphere of natural science.\n4.114 It should limit the thinkable and thereby the unthinkable.\nIt should limit the unthinkable from within through the thinkable.\n4.115 It will mean the unspeakable by clearly displaying the speakable.\n4.116 Everything that can be thought at all can be thought clearly. Everything that can be said can be said clearly.\n4.12 Propositions can represent the whole reality, but they cannot represent what they must have in common with reality in order to be able to represent it - the logical form.\nTo be able to represent the logical form, we should have to be able to put ourselves with the propositions outside logic, that is outside the world.\n4.121 Propositions cannot represent the logical form: this mirrors itself in the propositions.\nThat which mirrors itself in language, language cannot represent.\nThat which expresses itself in language, we cannot express by language.\nThe propositions show the logical form of reality.\nThey exhibit it.\n4.1211 Thus one proposition 'fa' shows that the object a occurs in its sense, two propositions 'fa' and 'ga' show that the same object is mentioned in both of them.\nIf two propositions contradict one another, then their structure shows it; the same is true if one follows from the other. And so on.\n4.1212 What can be shown cannot be said.\n4.1213 Now, too, we understand our feeling that we have a clear logical conception only if everything is completely settled.\n4.122 In a certain sense we can talk about formal properties of objects and states of affairs, or, in the case of the configuration of properties, about properties of the structure of facts; and in the same sense about formal relations and relations of structures.\n(Instead of 'property of the structure' I also say 'internal property'; instead of 'relation of structures', 'internal relation'.\nI introduce these expressions in order to show the reason for the confusion, very widespread among philosophers, between internal relations and proper (external) relations.)\nThe holding of such internal properties and relations cannot be asserted by propositions, but it shows itself in the propositions which present the states of affairs and treat of the objects in question.\n4.1221 An internal property of a fact can also be called a feature of this fact (in the sense in which we speak of facial features, for example).\n4.123 A property is internal if it is unthinkable that its object should not possess it.\n(This shade of blue and that one stand, eo ipso, in the internal relation of lighter to darker. It is unthinkable that these two objects should not stand in this relation.)\n(Here the shifting use of the word 'object' corresponds to the shifting use of the words 'property' and 'relation'.)\n4.124 The existence of an internal property of a possible situation is not expressed by a proposition, but it expresses itself in the proposition which presents that situation, by an internal property of that proposition.\nIt would be just as senseless to assert that a proposition had a formal property as to deny it.\n4.1241 It is impossible to distinguish forms from one another by saying that one has this but the other that property; for this implies that there is a subject-predicate proposition to be true of both forms.\n4.125 The existence of an internal relation between possible situations expresses itself in language by an internal relation between the propositions presenting them.\n4.1251 Here we have the answer to the vexed question 'whether the logical constant is a concept'.\n4.1252 The series which is ordered by internal relations is the series of forms.\nThe order of the number-series is not governed by an external relation but by an internal relation.\nThe series of propositions is ordered by an internal relation.\n(In a certain sense one can call the term of the number series a formal property of the number.)\n4.126 We can now talk about formal concepts, in the same sense that we speak of formal properties.\n(I introduce this expression in order to exhibit the source of the confusion between formal concepts and proper concepts, which runs through the whole of the old logic.)\nWhen something falls under a formal concept as one of its objects, this cannot be expressed by a proposition. But it is shown in the very sign for this object. (A name shows that it signifies an object, a sign for a number that it signifies a number etc.)\nFormal concepts cannot, in fact, be represented by a function, as concepts proper can.\nFor their characteristics, the formal properties, are not expressed by functions.\nThe expression for a formal property is a feature of certain symbols.\nSo the sign for the characteristics of a formal concept is a distinctive feature of all symbols whose meanings fall under the concept.\nThe expression for a formal concept is therefore a propositional variable in which this distinctive feature alone is constant.\n4.127 The propositional variable signifies the formal concept, and its values signify the objects which fall under this concept.\n4.1271 Every variable is the sign for a formal concept.\nFor every variable represents a constant form that all its values possess, and this can be regarded as a formal property of those values.\n4.1272 Thus the variable name 'x' is the proper sign for the pseudo-concept object.\nWherever the word 'object' ('thing', etc.) is correctly used, it is expressed in logical symbolism by a variable name.\nFor example, in the proposition 'there are 2 objects which...', it is expressed by '(Ex,y)...'.\nWherever it is used in a different way, that is as a proper concept-word, there arise senseless pseudo-propositions.\nSo one cannot say, for example, 'There are objects', as one might say, 'There are books'. And it is just as impossible to say 'There are 100 objects', or 'There are !0 objects'.\nAnd it is senseless to speak of the number of all objects.\nThe same applies to the words 'complex', 'fact', 'function', 'number', etc.\nThey all signify formal concepts, and are represented in logical symbolism by variables, not by functions or classes (as Frege and Russell believed).\n'1 is a number', 'there is only one zero', and all such expressions are senseless.\n(It is just as senseless to say 'there is only one 1', as it would be to say '2 + 2 is at 3 o'clock equal to 4'.)\n4.12721 The formal concept is already given with an object which falls under it. One cannot, therefore, introduce both the objects which fall under a formal concept and the formal concept itself as primitive ideas. One cannot, therefore, for example, introduce the concept of a function and also special functions (as Russell does) as primitive ideas; or the concept of a number and definite numbers.\n4.1273 If we want to express in logical symbolism the general proposition 'b is a successor of a', we need for this an expression for the general term of the series of forms: a, O'a, O'O'a, ... The general term of a series of forms can be expressed only by a variable, for the concept 'term of that series of forms' is a formal concept. (This Frege and Russell overlooked; the way in which they express general propositions like the above is, therefore, false; it contains a vicious circle.)\nWe can determine the general term of the series of forms by giving its first term and the general form of the operation one of whose terms is the proposition producing the other.\n4.1274 To ask whether a formal concept exists is senseless. For no proposition can answer such a question.\n(Therefore, for example, the question: 'Are there unanalysable subject-predicate propositions?' cannot be asked.)\n4.128 The logical forms are anumerical.\nTherefore there are in logic no pre-eminent numbers, and therefore there is no philosophical monism or dualism, etc.\n4.2 The sense of a proposition is its agreement and disagreement with the possibilities of the existence and non-existence of the atomic facts.\n4.21 The simplest proposition, the elementary proposition, asserts the existence of an atomic fact.\n4.211 It is a sign of an elementary proposition, that no elementary proposition can contradict it.\n4.22 The elementary proposition consists of names. It is a connection, a concatenation, of names.\n4.221 It is obvious that in the analysis of propositions we must come to elementary propositions, which consist of names in immediate combination.\nThe question arises here, how the propositional connection comes to be.\n4.2211 Even if the world is infinitely complex, so that every fact consists of an infinite number of atomic facts and every atomic fact is composed of an infinite number of objects, even then there must be objects and atomic facts.\n4.23 The name occurs in the proposition only in the context of the elementary proposition.\n4.24 The names are the simple symbols, I indicate them by single letters (x,y,z).\nThe elementary proposition I write as function of the names, in the form fx, (x,y), etc.\nOr I indicate it by the letters p, q, r.\n4.241 If I use two signs with one and the same meaning, I express this by putting between them the sign '='.\n'a=b' means then, that the sign 'a' is replaceable by the sign 'b'.\n(If I introduce by an equation a new sign 'b', by determining that it shall replace a known sign 'a', I write the equation - definition - (like Russell) in the form 'a=b Def.'. A definition is a symbolic rule.)\n4.242 Expressions of the form 'a=b' are therefore only expedients in presentation: They state nothing about the meaning of the signs 'a' and 'b'.\n4.243 Can we understand two names without knowing whether they signify the same thing or two different things? Can we understand a proposition in which two names occur, without knowing if they mean the same or different things?\nIf I know the meaning of an English and a German word that mean the same thing, then it is impossible for me not to know that they mean the same thing; it is impossible for me not to be able to translate them into one another.\nExpressions like 'a=a', or expressions deduced from these are neither elementary propositions nor is there any other way in which they have sense. (This will become evident later.)\n4.25 If the elementary proposition is true, the atomic fact exists; if it is false the atomic fact does not exist.\n4.26 The specification of all true elementary propositions describes the world completely. The world is completely described by the specification of all elementary propositions plus the specification, which of them are true and which false.\n4.27 With regard to the existence of n atomic facts there are Kn possibilities.\nIt is possible for all the combinations of atomic facts to exist, and the others not to exist.\n4.28 There correspond to these combinations the same number of possibilities of the truth - and falsehood - of n elementary propositions.\n4.3 The truth-possibilities of the elementary propositions mean the possibilities of the existence and non-existence of the atomic facts.\n4.31 The truth-possibilities can be presented by schemata of the following kind ('T' means 'true', 'F' 'false'. The rows of 'T's' and 'F's' under the row of the elementary propositions symbolize their truth-possibilities in an easily intelligible symbolism).\n4.4 A proposition is the expression of agreement and disagreement with the truth-possibilities of the elementary propositions.\n4.41 The truth-possibilities of the elementary propositions are the conditions of the truth and falsity of the propositions.\n4.411 It is probable that the use of these schemata will be found extremely simple.\n4.42 With regard to the agreement of a proposition with the truth-possibilities of n elementary propositions there are Ln possibilities.\n4.43 Agreement with the truth-possibilities can be expressed by coordinating with them in the schema the mark 'T' (true).\nAbsence of this mark means disagreement.\n4.431 The expression of the agreement and disagreement with the truth-possibilities of the elementary propositions expresses the truth-conditions of the proposition.\nThe proposition is the expression of its truth-conditions.\n(Frege has therefore quite rightly used them as an explanation of the signs of his logical symbolism. Only the explanation of the truth-concept 'true': 'the true' and 'the false' are not objects.)\n4.44 The sign which arises from the coordination of that mark 'T' with the truth-possibilities is a propositional sign.\n4.441 It is clear that to the complex of the signs 'F' and 'T' no object (or complex of objects) corresponds; any more than to horizontal and vertical lines or to brackets. There are no 'logical objects'.\nOf course the same applies to all signs that express the same as the schemata of 'T' and 'F'.\n4.442 Thus, for example, '(T,T,F,T)(p,q)' is a propositional sign.\n(Frege's 'judgment stroke' '|-' is logically quite meaningless: in Frege (and Russell) it only shows that these authors hold the propositions marked with it to be true. '|-' belongs therefore to the propositions no more than does the number of the proposition. A proposition cannot possibly assert of itself that it is true.)\nIf the sequence of the truth-possibilities in the schema is once for all determined by a rule of combination, then the last column is by itself an expression of the truth-conditions. If we write this column as a row the propositional sign becomes: '(T T- T) (p, q)', or more plainly: '(TTFT) (p, q)'.\n(The number of places in the left-hand bracket is determined by the number of terms in the right-hand bracket.)\n4.45 For n elementary propositions there are Ln possible groups of truth-conditions.\nThe groups of truth-conditions which belong to the truth-possibilities of a number of elementary propositions can be ordered in a series.\n4.46 Among the possible groups of truth-conditions there are two extreme cases.\nIn the one case the proposition is true for all the truth-possibilities of the elementary propositions. We say that the truth-conditions are tautological.\nIn the second case the proposition is false for all the truth-possibilities. The truth-conditions are self-contradictory.\nIn the first case we call the proposition a tautology, in the second a contradiction.\n4.461 The proposition shows what it says, the tautology and the contradiction that they say nothing.\nThe tautology has no truth-conditions, for it is unconditionally true; and the contradiction is on no condition true.\nTautology and contradiction are without sense.\n(Like the point from which two arrows go out in opposite directions.)\n(I know, for example, nothing about the weather, when I know that it rains or does not rain.)\n4.4611 Tautology and contradiction are, however, not nonsensical; they are part of the symbolism, in the same way that '0' is part of the symbolism of arithmetic.\n4.462 Tautology and contradiction are not pictures of the reality. They present no possible state of affairs. For the one allows every possible state of affairs, the other none.\nIn the tautology the conditions of agreement with the world - the presenting relations - cancel one another, so that it stands in no presenting relation to reality.\n4.463 The truth-conditions determine the range, which is left to the facts by the proposition.\n(The proposition, the picture, the model, are in a negative sense like a solid body, which restricts the free movement of another: in a positive sense, like the space limited by solid substance, in which a body may be placed.)\nTautology leaves to reality the whole infinite logical space; contradiction fills the whole logical space and leaves no point to reality. Neither of them, therefore, can in any way determine reality.\n4.464 The truth of tautology is certain, of the proposition possible, of contradiction impossible.\n(Certain, possible, impossible: here we have an indication of that gradation which we need in the theory of probability.)\n4.465 The logical product of a tautology and a proposition says the same as the proposition. Therefore that product is identical with the proposition. For the essence of the symbol cannot be altered without altering its sense.\n4.466 To a definite logical combination of signs corresponds a definite logical combination of their meanings; every arbitrary combination only corresponds to the unconnected signs.\nThat is, propositions which are true for every situation cannot be combinations of signs at all, for otherwise there could only be definite combinations of objects corresponding to them.\n(And to no logical combination corresponds no combination of the objects.)\nTautology and contradiction are the limiting cases of the combinations of symbols, namely their dissolution.\n4.4661 Of course the signs are also combined with one another in the tautology and contradiction, that is, they stand in relations to one another, but these relations are meaningless, unessential to the symbol.\n4.5 Now it appears to be possible to give the most general form of proposition; that is, to give a description of the propositions of some one sign-language, so that every possible sense can be expressed by a symbol, which fits the description, and so that every symbol, which fits the description, can express a sense, if the meanings of the names are chosen accordingly.\nIt is clear that in the description of the most general form of proposition only what is essential to it may be described - otherwise it would not be the most general form.\nThat there is a general form is proved by the fact that there cannot be a proposition whose form could not have been foreseen (that is, constructed). The general form of proposition is: Such and such is the case.\n4.51 Suppose all elementary propositions were given. The question then arises: what propositions can be built out of them? And these are all propositions and so are they limited.\n4.52 The propositions are everything which follows from the totality of all elementary propositions.\n4.53 The general propositional form is a variable.\n5 Propositions are truth-functions of elementary propositions.\n(An elementary proposition is a truth-function of itself.)\n5.1361 The events of the future cannot be inferred from those of the present.\nSuperstition is the belief in the causal nexus.\n5.6 The limits of my language mean the limits of my world.\n6.4 All propositions are of equal value.\n6.41 The sense of the world must lie outside the world. In the world everything is as it is and happens as it does happen. In it there is no value - and if there were, it would be of no value.\nIf there is a value which is of value, it must lie outside all happening and being-so. For all happening and being-so is accidental.\nWhat makes it non-accidental cannot lie in the world, for otherwise this would again be accidental.\nIt must lie outside the world.\n6.42 Hence also there can be no ethical propositions.\nPropositions cannot express the higher.\n6.421 It is clear that ethics cannot be expressed.\nEthics is transcendental.\n(Ethics and aesthetics are one.)\n6.522 There is indeed the inexpressible. This shows itself; it is the mystical.\n6.54 My propositions are elucidatory in this way: he who understands me finally recognizes them as senseless, when he has climbed out through them, on them, over them. (He must so to speak throw away the ladder, after he has climbed up on it.)\nHe must surmount these propositions; then he sees the world rightly.\n7 Whereof one cannot speak, thereof one must be silent.", "source": "tractatus.txt"}
