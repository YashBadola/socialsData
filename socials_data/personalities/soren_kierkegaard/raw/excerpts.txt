The crowd is untruth. There is therefore no one who has more contempt for what it is to be a human being than those who make it their profession to lead the crowd.

The most common form of despair is not being who you are.

Life can only be understood backwards; but it must be lived forwards.

Anxiety is the dizziness of freedom.

Faith is the highest passion in a human being. Many in every generation may not come that far, but none comes further.

People demand freedom of speech as a compensation for the freedom of thought which they seldom use.

It is perfectly true, as philosophers say, that life must be understood backwards. But they forget the other proposition, that it must be lived forwards.

This, gentlemen, is the essence of all philosophy.
