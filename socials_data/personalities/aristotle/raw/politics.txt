Observation shows us, first, that every city (polis) is a species of association, and, secondly, that all associations are instituted for the purpose of attaining some good-for all men do all their acts with a view to achieving something which is, in their view, a good.

From these considerations it is evident that the city belongs to the class of things that exist by nature, and that man is by nature a political animal. He who by his nature and not simply by ill-luck has no city is either too bad or too good to be human.

The city is prior in the order of nature to the family and the individual. The reason for this is that the whole is necessarily prior to the part. If the whole body be destroyed, there will not be a foot or a hand, except in that ambiguous sense in which one uses the word 'hand' for a particular part of a body of stone; for a hand separated from the body will be disabled.

A citizen is one who shares in governing and being governed. He differs under different forms of government, but in the best state he is one who is able and willing to be governed and to govern with a view to the life of virtue.

For tyranny is a kind of monarchy which has in view the interest of the monarch only; oligarchy has in view the interest of the wealthy; democracy, of the needy: none of them the common good of all.
