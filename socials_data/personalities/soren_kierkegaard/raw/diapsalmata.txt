I don't feel like doing anything. I don't feel like riding—the motion is too violent; I don't feel like walking—it is too strenuous; I don't feel like lying down, for either I should have to stay down, and I don't feel like doing that, or I should have to get up again, and I don't feel like doing that either. Summa Summarum: I don't feel like doing anything.

What is a poet? An unhappy man who in his heart harbors a deep anguish, but whose lips are so fashioned that the sighs and cries which pass over them are transformed into ravishing music.

My life is like an eternal night, and when I die, I can say: "The night is over."
