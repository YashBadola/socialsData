When Alexander the Great visited him in Corinth, Diogenes was resting in the sunlight. Alexander, thrilled to meet the famous philosopher, asked if there was any favor he could do for him. Diogenes replied, "Yes, stand out of my sunlight."

Diogenes was known for carrying a lamp in broad daylight. When asked what he was doing, he would reply, "I am looking for a man." (Implying he could not find a single honest or virtuous human being).

Plato defined man as a "featherless biped." Diogenes plucked a chicken and brought it into Plato's Academy, declaring, "Behold! I've brought you a man." Plato subsequently added "with broad flat nails" to his definition.

When asked why he begged from statues, Diogenes replied, "To get used to being rejected."

Seeing a child drinking from his hands, Diogenes threw away his cup and said, "A child has beaten me in plainness of living."

When some one reminded him that the people of Sinope had sentenced him to exile, he said, "And I sentenced them to stay at home."

Diogenes was once seen begging for alms from a statue. When asked why he was doing so, he replied, "I am practising how to meet a refusal."

Being asked where in Greece he saw good men, he replied, "Good men nowhere, but good boys at Sparta."

When asked what was the right time to marry, he replied, "For a young man not yet: for an old man never at all."

When he was captured by pirates and sold into slavery, he was asked what trade he knew. He replied, "Governing men." He then pointed to a certain Corinthian named Xeniades and said, "Sell me to this man; he needs a master."
