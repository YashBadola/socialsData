The Unhappiest One

The grave of the hero is known and honored, and to the poet his name is music; but who knows the grave of the Unhappiest One, and who knows his name? He lives a life more lonely than the dead in the grave, and yet he is not dead. He lives, but he is not living.

He who is the Unhappiest One? He is the one who has lost his memory and his hope. He has lost his memory because he cannot remember anything happy in the past; he has lost his hope because he cannot hope for anything happy in the future.

But why is he unhappy? Because he is always absent from himself. He is never present to himself in the moment. When he remembers the past, he is not in the past, but in the future, hoping that the past will come again. When he hopes for the future, he is not in the future, but in the past, remembering how it was. Thus he is never where he is. He is always elsewhere.

His life is a constant restless movement, a fleeing from himself. He cannot find rest, for he carries his unrest with him. He is like a sick man who tosses and turns in his bed, seeking a comfortable position, but finding none.

And yet, there is a strange fascination about him. He is the one whom the gods love, but whom they also punish. He is the chosen one, the exception. He suffers, but his suffering has a meaning, a purpose. It is through his suffering that he comes to understand the truth of existence.

The Unhappiest One is the one who knows that life is a paradox, a contradiction. He knows that happiness is not the goal of life, but that truth is. And truth is found only in suffering, in the struggle of the soul with itself.

So let us not pity the Unhappiest One, but rather let us honor him. For he is the witness to the truth, the martyr of existence. He is the one who shows us the way, even though he himself cannot walk it. He is the voice crying in the wilderness, preparing the way for the Lord.
