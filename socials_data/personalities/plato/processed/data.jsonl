Cleitophon.\nPolemarchus.\n_And others who are mute auditors._\nThe scene is laid in the house of Cephalus at the Piraeus; and the whole\ndialogue is narrated by Socrates the day after it actually took place to\nTimaeus, Hermocrates, Critias, and a nameless person, who are introduced\nin the Timaeus.\n*Ed. Steph. 327* [Sidenote: _Republic I_. Socrates, Glaucon. Meeting of\nSocrates and Glaucon with Polemarchus at the Bendidean festival.]\nI went down yesterday to the Piraeus with Glaucon the son of Ariston, that\nI might offer up my prayers to the goddess[1]; and also because I wanted\nto see in what manner they would celebrate the festival, which was a new\nthing. I was delighted with the procession of the inhabitants; but that of\nthe Thracians was equally, if not more, beautiful. *327B* When we had\nfinished our prayers and viewed the spectacle, we turned in the direction\nof the city; and at that instant Polemarchus the son of Cephalus chanced\nto catch sight of us from a distance as we were starting on our way home,\nand told his servant to run and bid us wait for him. The servant took hold\nof me by the cloak behind, and said: Polemarchus desires you to wait.\n[Footnote 1: Bendis, the Thracian Artemis.]\nI turned round, and asked him where his master was.\nThere he is, said the youth, coming after you, if you will only wait.\n[Sidenote: Socrates, Polemarchus, Glaucon, Adeimantus, Cephalus.]\n{2} *327C* Certainly we will, said Glaucon; and in a few minutes\nPolemarchus appeared, and with him Adeimantus, Glaucon's brother, Niceratus\nthe son of Nicias, and several others who had been at the procession.\nPolemarchus said to me: I perceive, Socrates, that you and your companion\nare already on your way to the city.\nYou are not far wrong, I said.\nBut do you see, he rejoined, how many we are?\nOf course.\nAnd are you stronger than all these? for if not, you will have to remain\nwhere you are.\nMay there not be the alternative, I said, that we may persuade you to let\nus go?\nBut can you persuade us, if we refuse to listen to you? he said.\nCertainly not, replied Glaucon.\nThen we are not going to listen; of that you may be assured.\n*328A* [Sidenote: The equestrian torch-race.]\nAdeimantus added: Has no one told you of the torch-race on horseback in\nhonour of the goddess which will take place in the evening?\nWith horses! I replied: That is a novelty. Will horsemen carry torches and\npass them one to another during the race?\nYes, said Polemarchus, and not only so, but a festival will be celebrated\nat night, which you certainly ought to see. Let us rise soon after supper\nand see this festival; there will be a gathering of young men, and we will\nhave a good talk. *328B* Stay then, and do not be perverse.\nGlaucon said: I suppose, since you insist, that we must.\nVery good, I replied.\n[Sidenote: The gathering of friends at the house of Cephalus.]\nAccordingly we went with Polemarchus to his house; and there we found his\nbrothers Lysias and Euthydemus, and with them Thrasymachus the\nChalcedonian, Charmantides the Paeanian, and Cleitophon the son of\nAristonymus. There too was Cephalus the father of Polemarchus, whom I had\nnot seen for a long time, and I thought him very much aged. *328C* He was\nseated on a cushioned chair, and had a garland on his head, for he had\nbeen sacrificing in the court; and there were some other chairs in the\nroom arranged in a semicircle, {3} upon which we sat down by him. He\nsaluted me eagerly, and then he said:--\n[Sidenote: Cephalus, Socrates.]\nYou don't come to see me, Socrates, as often as you ought: If I were still\nable to go and see you I would not ask you to come to me. But at my age\nI can hardly get to the city, and therefore you should come oftener to the\nPiraeus. *328D* For let me tell you, that the more the pleasures of the\nbody fade away, the greater to me is the pleasure and charm of\nconversation. Do not then deny my request, but make our house your resort\nand keep company with these young men; we are old friends, and you will be\nquite at home with us.\nI replied: There is nothing which for my part I like better, Cephalus,\nthan conversing with aged men; *328E* for I regard them as travellers who\nhave gone a journey which I too may have to go, and of whom I ought to\nenquire, whether the way is smooth and easy, or rugged and difficult. And\nthis is a question which I should like to ask of you who have arrived at\nthat time which the poets call the 'threshold of old age'--Is life harder\ntowards the end, or what report do you give of it?\n*329A* [Sidenote: Old age is not to blame for the troubles of old men.]\n[Sidenote: The excellent saying of Sophocles.]\nI will tell you, Socrates, he said, what my own feeling is. Men of my age\nflock together; we are birds of a feather, as the old proverb says; and at\nour meetings the tale of my acquaintance commonly is--I cannot eat,\nI cannot drink; the pleasures of youth and love are fled away: there was a\ngood time once, but now that is gone, and life is no longer life. *329B*\nSome complain of the slights which are put upon them by relations, and\nthey will tell you sadly of how many evils their old age is the cause. But\nto me, Socrates, these complainers seem to blame that which is not really\nin fault. For if old age were the cause, I too being old, and every other\nold man, would have felt as they do. But this is not my own experience,\nnor that of others whom I have known. How well I remember the aged poet\nSophocles, when in answer to the question, *329C* How does love suit with\nage, Sophocles,--are you still the man you were? Peace, he replied; most\ngladly have I escaped the thing of which you speak; I feel as if I had\nescaped from a mad and furious master. His words have often occurred to my\nmind since, and they seem as good to me now as at the time when he uttered\nthem. {4} For certainly old age has a great sense of calm and freedom;\nwhen the passions relax their hold, then, as Sophocles says, *329D* we are\nfreed from the grasp not of one mad master only, but of many. The truth\nis, Socrates, that these regrets, and also the complaints about relations,\nare to be attributed to the same cause, which is not old age, but men's\ncharacters and tempers; for he who is of a calm and happy nature will\nhardly feel the pressure of age, but to him who is of an opposite\ndisposition youth and age are equally a burden.\n[Sidenote: It is admitted that the old, if they are to be comfortable,\nmust have a fair share of external goods; neither virtue alone nor riches\nalone can make an old man happy.]\nI listened in admiration, and wanting to draw him out, that he might go\non-- *329E* Yes, Cephalus, I said: but I rather suspect that people in\ngeneral are not convinced by you when you speak thus; they think that old\nage sits lightly upon you, not because of your happy disposition, but\nbecause you are rich, and wealth is well known to be a great comforter.\nYou are right, he replied; they are not convinced: and there is something\nin what they say; not, however, so much as they imagine. I might answer\nthem as Themistocles answered the Seriphian who was abusing him and saying\nthat he was famous, not for his own merits but because he *330A* was an\nAthenian: 'If you had been a native of my country or I of yours, neither\nof us would have been famous.' And to those who are not rich and are\nimpatient of old age, the same reply may be made; for to the good poor man\nold age cannot be a light burden, nor can a bad rich man ever have peace\nwith himself.\nMay I ask, Cephalus, whether your fortune was for the most part inherited\nor acquired by you?\n[Sidenote: Cephalus has inherited rather than made a fortune; he is\ntherefore indifferent to money.]\nAcquired! *330B* Socrates; do you want to know how much I acquired? In the\nart of making money I have been midway between my father and grandfather:\nfor my grandfather, whose name I bear, doubled and trebled the value of\nhis patrimony, that which he inherited being much what I possess now; but\nmy father Lysanias reduced the property below what it is at present: and\nI shall be satisfied if I leave to these my sons not less but a little more\nthan I received.\nThat was why I asked you the question, I replied, because I see that you\nare indifferent about money, *330C* which is a characteristic rather of\nthose who have inherited their fortunes than of those who have acquired\nthem; the makers {5} of fortunes have a second love of money as a creation\nof their own, resembling the affection of authors for their own poems, or\nof parents for their children, besides that natural love of it for the\nsake of use and profit which is common to them and all men. And hence they\nare very bad company, for they can talk about nothing but the praises of\nwealth.\nThat is true, he said.\n[Sidenote: The advantages of wealth.]\n*330D* Yes, that is very true, but may I ask another question?--What do\nyou consider to be the greatest blessing which you have reaped from your\nwealth?\n[Sidenote: The fear of death and the consciousness of sin become more\nvivid in old age; and to be rich frees a man from many temptations.]\nOne, he said, of which I could not expect easily to convince others. For\nlet me tell you, Socrates, that when a man thinks himself to be near\ndeath, fears and cares enter into his mind which he never had before; the\ntales of a world below and the punishment which is exacted there of deeds\ndone here were once a laughing matter to him, *330E* but now he is\ntormented with the thought that they may be true: either from the weakness\nof age, or because he is now drawing nearer to that other place, he has a\nclearer view of these things; suspicions and alarms crowd thickly upon\nhim, and he begins to reflect and consider what wrongs he has done to\nothers. And when he finds that the sum of his transgressions is great he\nwill many a time like a child start up in his sleep for fear, and he is\nfilled with dark forebodings. But *331A* to him who is conscious of no\nsin, sweet hope, as Pindar charmingly says, is the kind nurse of his age:\n[Sidenote: The admirable strain of Pindar.]\n'Hope,' he says, 'cherishes the soul of him who lives in justice and\nholiness, and is the nurse of his age and the companion of his\njourney;--hope which is mightiest to sway the restless soul of man.'\nHow admirable are his words! And the great blessing of riches, *331B* I do\nnot say to every man, but to a good man, is, that he has had no occasion\nto deceive or to defraud others, either intentionally or unintentionally;\nand when he departs to the world below he is not in any apprehension about\nofferings due to the gods or debts which he owes to men. Now to this peace\nof mind the possession of wealth greatly contributes; and therefore I say,\nthat, setting one thing against another, of the many advantages which\nwealth has to give, to a man of sense this is in my opinion the greatest.\n{6}\n[Sidenote: Cephalus, Socrates, Polemarchus.]\n[Sidenote: Justice to speak truth and pay your debts.]\n*331C* Well said, Cephalus, I replied; but as concerning justice, what is\nit?--to speak the truth and to pay your debts--no more than this? And even\nto this are there not exceptions? Suppose that a friend when in his right\nmind has deposited arms with me and he asks for them when he is not in his\nright mind, ought I to give them back to him? No one would say that I\nought or that I should be right in doing so, any more than they would say\nthat I ought always to speak the truth to one who is in his condition.\n*331D* You are quite right, he replied.\nBut then, I said, speaking the truth and paying your debts is not a\ncorrect definition of justice.\n[Sidenote: This is the definition of Simonides. But you ought not on all\noccasions to do either. What then was his meaning?]\nQuite correct, Socrates, if Simonides is to be believed, said Polemarchus\ninterposing.\nI fear, said Cephalus, that I must go now, for I have to look after the\nsacrifices, and I hand over the argument to Polemarchus and the company.\nIs not Polemarchus your heir? I said.\nTo be sure, he answered, and went away laughing to the sacrifices.\n*331E* Tell me then, O thou heir of the argument, what did Simonides say,\nand according to you truly say, about justice?\nHe said that the repayment of a debt is just, and in saying so he appears\nto me to be right.\nI should be sorry to doubt the word of such a wise and inspired man, but\nhis meaning, though probably clear to you, is the reverse of clear to me.\nFor he certainly does not mean, as we were just now saying, that I ought\nto return a deposit of arms or of anything else to one who asks for it\n*332A* when he is not in his right senses; and yet a deposit cannot be\ndenied to be a debt.\nTrue.\nThen when the person who asks me is not in his right mind I am by no means\nto make the return?\nCertainly not.\nWhen Simonides said that the repayment of a debt was justice, he did not\nmean to include that case?\nCertainly not; for he thinks that a friend ought always to do good to a\nfriend and never evil.\n[Sidenote: Socrates, Polemarchus.]\n*332B* You mean that the return of a deposit of gold which is to the\ninjury of the receiver, if the two parties are friends, is not the\nrepayment of a debt,--that is what you would imagine him to say?\nYes.\nAnd are enemies also to receive what we owe to them?\nTo be sure, he said, they are to receive what we owe them, and an enemy,\nas I take it, owes to an enemy that which is due or proper to him--that is\nto say, evil. {7}\nSimonides, then, after the manner of poets, would seem to have spoken\ndarkly of the nature of justice; *332C* for he really meant to say that\njustice is the giving to each man what is proper to him, and this he\ntermed a debt.\nThat must have been his meaning, he said.\nBy heaven! I replied; and if we asked him what due or proper thing is\ngiven by medicine, and to whom, what answer do you think that he would\nmake to us?\nHe would surely reply that medicine gives drugs and meat and drink to\nhuman bodies.\nAnd what due or proper thing is given by cookery, and to what?\n*332D* Seasoning to food.\nAnd what is that which justice gives, and to whom?\nIf, Socrates, we are to be guided at all by the analogy of the preceding\ninstances, then justice is the art which gives good to friends and evil to\nenemies.\nThat is his meaning then?\nI think so.\n[Sidenote: Illustrations.]\nAnd who is best able to do good to his friends and evil to his enemies in\ntime of sickness?\nThe physician.\n*332E* Or when they are on a voyage, amid the perils of the sea?\nThe pilot.\nAnd in what sort of actions or with a view to what result is the just man\nmost able to do harm to his enemy and good to his friend?\nIn going to war against the one and in making alliances with the other.\nBut when a man is well, my dear Polemarchus, there is no need of a\nphysician? {8}\nNo.\nAnd he who is not on a voyage has no need of a pilot?\nNo.\nThen in time of peace justice will be of no use?\nI am very far from thinking so.\n*333A* You think that justice may be of use in peace as well as in war?\nYes.\nLike husbandry for the acquisition of corn?\nYes.\nOr like shoemaking for the acquisition of shoes,--that is what you mean?\nYes.\nAnd what similar use or power of acquisition has justice in time of peace?\n[Sidenote: Justice is useful in contracts,]\nIn contracts, Socrates, justice is of use.\nAnd by contracts you mean partnerships?\nExactly.\n*333B* But is the just man or the skilful player a more useful and better\npartner at a game of draughts?\nThe skilful player.\nAnd in the laying of bricks and stones is the just man a more useful or\nbetter partner than the builder?\nQuite the reverse.\nThen in what sort of partnership is the just man a better partner than the\nharp-player, as in playing the harp the harp-player is certainly a better\npartner than the just man?\nIn a money partnership.\nYes, Polemarchus, but surely not in the use of money; for you do not want\na just man to be your counsellor in the purchase or sale of a horse; a man\nwho is knowing about *333C* horses would be better for that, would he not?\nCertainly.\nAnd when you want to buy a ship, the shipwright or the pilot would be\nbetter?\nTrue.\nThen what is that joint use of silver or gold in which the just man is to\nbe preferred?\n[Sidenote: especially in the safe-keeping of deposits.]\nWhen you want a deposit to be kept safely.\nYou mean when money is not wanted, but allowed to lie? {9}\nPrecisely.\n[Sidenote: But not in the use of money: and if so, justice is only useful\nwhen money or anything else is useless.]\nThat is to say, justice is useful when money is useless?\n*333D* That is the inference.\nAnd when you want to keep a pruning-hook safe, then justice is useful to\nthe individual and to the state; but when you want to use it, then the art\nof the vine-dresser?\nClearly.\nAnd when you want to keep a shield or a lyre, and not to use them, you\nwould say that justice is useful; but when you want to use them, then the\nart of the soldier or of the musician?\nCertainly.\nAnd so of all other things;--justice is useful when they are useless, and\nuseless when they are useful?\nThat is the inference.\n*333E* Then justice is not good for much. But let us consider this further\npoint: Is not he who can best strike a blow in a boxing match or in any\nkind of fighting best able to ward off a blow?\nCertainly.\nAnd he who is most skilful in preventing or escaping[2] from a disease is\nbest able to create one?\n[Footnote 2: Reading [Greek: phula/xasthai kai\\ lathei=n, (ou=tos, ktl].]\nTrue.\n[Sidenote: A new point of view: Is not he who is best able to do good best\nable to do evil?]\nAnd he is the best guard of a camp who is best able to *334A* steal a\nmarch upon the enemy?\nCertainly.\nThen he who is a good keeper of anything is also a good thief?\nThat, I suppose, is to be inferred.\nThen if the just man is good at keeping money, he is good at stealing it.\nThat is implied in the argument.\nThen after all the just man has turned out to be a thief. And this is a\nlesson which I suspect you must have learnt out of Homer; *334B* for he,\nspeaking of Autolycus, the maternal grandfather of Odysseus, who is a\nfavourite of his, affirms that\n'He was excellent above all men in theft and perjury.'\nAnd so, you and Homer and Simonides are agreed that {10} justice is an art\nof theft; to be practised however 'for the good of friends and for the\nharm of enemies,'--that was what you were saying?\nNo, certainly not that, though I do not now know what I did say; but I\nstill stand by the latter words.\n*334C* Well, there is another question: By friends and enemies do we mean\nthose who are so really, or only in seeming?\n[Sidenote: Justice an art of theft to be practised for the good of friends\nand the harm of enemies. But who are friends and enemies?]\nSurely, he said, a man may be expected to love those whom he thinks good,\nand to hate those whom he thinks evil.\nYes, but do not persons often err about good and evil: many who are not\ngood seem to be so, and conversely?\nThat is true.\nThen to them the good will be enemies and the evil will be their friends?\nTrue.\nAnd in that case they will be right in doing good to the evil and *334D*\nevil to the good?\nClearly.\nBut the good are just and would not do an injustice?\nTrue.\nThen according to your argument it is just to injure those who do no\nwrong?\nNay, Socrates; the doctrine is immoral.\nThen I suppose that we ought to do good to the just and harm to the\nunjust?\nI like that better.\n[Sidenote: Mistakes will sometimes happen.]\nBut see the consequence:--Many a man who is ignorant of human nature has\nfriends who are bad friends, *334E* and in that case he ought to do harm\nto them; and he has good enemies whom he ought to benefit; but, if so, we\nshall be saying the very opposite of that which we affirmed to be the\nmeaning of Simonides.\nVery true, he said: and I think that we had better correct an error into\nwhich we seem to have fallen in the use of the words 'friend' and 'enemy.'\nWhat was the error, Polemarchus? I asked.\nWe assumed that he is a friend who seems to be or who is thought good.\n[Sidenote: Correction of the definition.]\nAnd how is the error to be corrected?\n[Sidenote: To appearance we must add reality. He is a friend who 'is' as\nwell as 'seems' good, And we should do good to our good friends and harm\nto our bad enemies.]\nWe should rather say that he is a friend who is, as well as {11} seems,\ngood; *335A* and that he who seems only, and is not good, only seems to be\nand is not a friend; and of an enemy the same may be said.\nYou would argue that the good are our friends and the bad our enemies?\nYes.\nAnd instead of saying simply as we did at first, that it is just to do\ngood to our friends and harm to our enemies, we should further say: It is\njust to do good to our friends when they are good and harm to our enemies\nwhen they are evil?\n*335B* Yes, that appears to me to be the truth.\nBut ought the just to injure any one at all?\nUndoubtedly he ought to injure those who are both wicked and his enemies.\n[Sidenote: To harm men is to injure them; and to injure them is to make\nthem unjust. But justice cannot produce injustice.]\nWhen horses are injured, are they improved or deteriorated?\nThe latter.\nDeteriorated, that is to say, in the good qualities of horses, not of\ndogs?\nYes, of horses.\nAnd dogs are deteriorated in the good qualities of dogs, and not of\nhorses?\nOf course.\n*335C* And will not men who are injured be deteriorated in that which is\nthe proper virtue of man?\nCertainly.\nAnd that human virtue is justice?\nTo be sure.\nThen men who are injured are of necessity made unjust?\nThat is the result.\n[Sidenote: Illustrations.]\nBut can the musician by his art make men unmusical?\nCertainly not.\nOr the horseman by his art make them bad horsemen?\nImpossible.\nAnd can the just by justice make men unjust, or speaking *335D* generally,\ncan the good by virtue make them bad?\nAssuredly not.\nAny more than heat can produce cold?\nIt cannot.\nOr drought moisture? {12}\n[Sidenote: Socrates, Polemarchus, Thrasymachus.]\nClearly not.\nNor can the good harm any one?\nImpossible.\nAnd the just is the good?\nCertainly.\nThen to injure a friend or any one else is not the act of a just man, but\nof the opposite, who is the unjust?\nI think that what you say is quite true, Socrates.\n*335E* Then if a man says that justice consists in the repayment of debts,\nand that good is the debt which a just man owes to his friends, and evil\nthe debt which he owes to his enemies,--to say this is not wise; for it is\nnot true, if, as has been clearly shown, the injuring of another can be in\nno case just.\nI agree with you, said Polemarchus.\n[Sidenote: The saying however explained is not to be attributed to any\ngood or wise man.]\nThen you and I are prepared to take up arms against any one who attributes\nsuch a saying to Simonides or Bias or Pittacus, or any other wise man or\nseer?\nI am quite ready to do battle at your side, he said.\n*336A* Shall I tell you whose I believe the saying to be?\nWhose?\nI believe that Periander or Perdiccas or Xerxes or Ismenias the Theban, or\nsome other rich and mighty man, who had a great opinion of his own power,\nwas the first to say that justice is 'doing good to your friends and harm\nto your enemies.'\nMost true, he said.\nYes, I said; but if this definition of justice also breaks down, what\nother can be offered?\n[Sidenote: The brutality of Thrasymachus.]\n*336B* Several times in the course of the discussion Thrasymachus had made\nan attempt to get the argument into his own hands, and had been put down\nby the rest of the company, who wanted to hear the end. But when\nPolemarchus and I had done speaking and there was a pause, he could no\nlonger hold his peace; and, gathering himself up, he came at us like a\nwild beast, seeking to devour us. We were quite panic-stricken at the\nsight of him.\nHe roared out to the whole company: What folly, Socrates, has taken\npossession of you all? *336C* And why, sillybillies, do you knock under to\none another? I say that if you want really to know what justice is, you\nshould not only ask but {13} answer, and you should not seek honour to\nyourself from the refutation of an opponent, but have your own answer; for\nthere is many a one who can ask and cannot answer. *336D* And now I will\nnot have you say that justice is duty or advantage or profit or gain or\ninterest, for this sort of nonsense will not do for me; I must have\nclearness and accuracy.\n[Sidenote: Socrates, Thrasymachus.]\nI was panic-stricken at his words, and could not look at him without\ntrembling. Indeed I believe that if I had not fixed my eye upon him,\nI should have been struck dumb: but when I saw his fury rising, I looked\nat him first, and was *336E* therefore able to reply to him.\nThrasymachus, I said, with a quiver, don't be hard upon us. Polemarchus\nand I may have been guilty of a little mistake in the argument, but I can\nassure you that the error was not intentional. If we were seeking for a\npiece of gold, you would not imagine that we were 'knocking under to one\nanother,' and so losing our chance of finding it. And why, when we are\nseeking for justice, a thing more precious than many pieces of gold, do\nyou say that we are weakly yielding to one another and not doing our\nutmost to get at the truth? Nay, my good friend, we are most willing and\nanxious to do so, but the fact is that we cannot. And if so, you people\nwho know all things should pity us and not be angry with us.\n*337A* How characteristic of Socrates! he replied, with a bitter laugh;\n--that's your ironical style! Did I not foresee--have I not already told\nyou, that whatever he was asked he would refuse to answer, and try irony\nor any other shuffle, in order that he might avoid answering?\n[Sidenote: Socrates cannot give any answer if all true answers are\nexcluded.]\n[Sidenote: Thrasymachus is assailed with his own weapons.]\nYou are a philosopher, Thrasymachus, I replied, and well know that if you\nask a person what numbers make up twelve, *337B* taking care to prohibit\nhim whom you ask from answering twice six, or three times four, or six\ntimes two, or four times three, 'for this sort of nonsense will not do for\nme,'--then obviously, if that is your way of putting the question, no one\ncan answer you. But suppose that he were to retort, 'Thrasymachus, what do\nyou mean? If one of these numbers which you interdict be the true answer\nto the question, am I falsely to say some other number which is not the\nright one?--is *337C* that your meaning?'--How would you answer him?\nJust as if the two cases were at all alike! he said. {14}\n[Sidenote: Socrates, Thrasymachus, Glaucon.]\nWhy should they not be? I replied; and even if they are not, but only\nappear to be so to the person who is asked, ought he not to say what he\nthinks, whether you and I forbid him or not?\nI presume then that you are going to make one of the interdicted answers?\nI dare say that I may, notwithstanding the danger, if upon reflection\nI approve of any of them.\n*337D* But what if I give you an answer about justice other and better, he\nsaid, than any of these? What do you deserve to have done to you?\nDone to me!--as becomes the ignorant, I must learn from the wise--that is\nwhat I deserve to have done to me.\n[Sidenote: The Sophist demands payment for his instructions. The company\nare very willing to contribute.]\nWhat, and no payment! a pleasant notion!\nI will pay when I have the money, I replied.\nBut you have, Socrates, said Glaucon: and you, Thrasymachus, need be under\nno anxiety about money, for we will all make a contribution for Socrates.\n*337E* Yes, he replied, and then Socrates will do as he always does\n--refuse to answer himself, but take and pull to pieces the answer of some\none else.\n[Sidenote: Socrates knows little or nothing: how can he answer? And he is\ndeterred by the interdict of Thrasymachus.]\nWhy, my good friend, I said, how can any one answer who knows, and says\nthat he knows, just nothing; and who, even if he has some faint notions of\nhis own, is told by a man of authority not to utter them? The natural\nthing is, that *338A* the speaker should be some one like yourself who\nprofesses to know and can tell what he knows. Will you then kindly answer,\nfor the edification of the company and of myself?\nGlaucon and the rest of the company joined in my request, and\nThrasymachus, as any one might see, was in reality eager to speak; for he\nthought that he had an excellent answer, and would distinguish himself.\nBut at first he affected to insist on my answering; at length he consented\nto begin. *338B* Behold, he said, the wisdom of Socrates; he refuses to\nteach himself, and goes about learning of others, to whom he never even\nsays Thank you.\nThat I learn of others, I replied, is quite true; but that I am ungrateful\nI wholly deny. Money I have none, and therefore I pay in praise, which is\nall I have; and how ready {15} I am to praise any one who appears to me to\nspeak well you will very soon find out when you answer; for I expect that\nyou will answer well.\n[Sidenote: Socrates, Thrasymachus.]\n[Sidenote: The definition of Thrasymachus: 'Justice is the interest of the\nstronger or ruler.']\n*338C* Listen, then, he said; I proclaim that justice is nothing else than\nthe interest of the stronger. And now why do you not praise me? But of\ncourse you won't.\nLet me first understand you, I replied. Justice, as you say, is the\ninterest of the stronger. What, Thrasymachus, is the meaning of this? You\ncannot mean to say that because Polydamas, the pancratiast, is stronger\nthan we are, and finds the eating of beef conducive to his bodily\nstrength, that to *338D* eat beef is therefore equally for our good who\nare weaker than he is, and right and just for us?\nThat's abominable of you, Socrates; you take the words in the sense which\nis most damaging to the argument.\nNot at all, my good sir, I said; I am trying to understand them; and\nI wish that you would be a little clearer.\nWell, he said, have you never heard that forms of government differ; there\nare tyrannies, and there are democracies, and there are aristocracies?\nYes, I know.\nAnd the government is the ruling power in each state?\nCertainly.\n[Sidenote: Socrates compels Thrasymachus to explain his meaning.]\n*338E* And the different forms of government make laws democratical,\naristocratical, tyrannical, with a view to their several interests; and\nthese laws, which are made by them for their own interests, are the\njustice which they deliver to their subjects, and him who transgresses\nthem they punish as a breaker of the law, and unjust. And that is what\nI mean when I say that in all states there is the same principle of\njustice, which is the interest of the government; and *339A* as the\ngovernment must be supposed to have power, the only reasonable conclusion\nis, that everywhere there is one principle of justice, which is the\ninterest of the stronger.\nNow I understand you, I said; and whether you are right or not I will try\nto discover. But let me remark, that in defining justice you have yourself\nused the word 'interest' which you forbade me to use. It is true, however,\nthat in your definition the words 'of the stronger' are added.\n*339B* A small addition, you must allow, he said. {16}\nGreat or small, never mind about that: we must first enquire whether what\nyou are saying is the truth. Now we are both agreed that justice is\ninterest of some sort, but you go on to say 'of the stronger'; about this\naddition I am not so sure, and must therefore consider further.\nProceed.\n[Sidenote: He is dissatisfied with the explanation; for rulers may err.]\nI will; and first tell me, Do you admit that it is just for subjects to\nobey their rulers?\nI do.\n*339C* But are the rulers of states absolutely infallible, or are they\nsometimes liable to err?\nTo be sure, he replied, they are liable to err.\nThen in making their laws they may sometimes make them rightly, and\nsometimes not?\nTrue.\nWhen they make them rightly, they make them agreeably to their interest;\nwhen they are mistaken, contrary to their interest; you admit that?\nYes.\nAnd the laws which they make must be obeyed by their subjects,--and that\nis what you call justice?\nDoubtless.\n[Sidenote: And then the justice which makes a mistake will turn out to be\nthe reverse of the interest of the stronger.]\n*339D* Then justice, according to your argument, is not only obedience to\nthe interest of the stronger but the reverse?\nWhat is that you are saying? he asked.\nI am only repeating what you are saying, I believe. But let us consider:\nHave we not admitted that the rulers may be mistaken about their own\ninterest in what they command, and also that to obey them is justice? Has\nnot that been admitted?\nYes.\n*339E* Then you must also have acknowledged justice not to be for the\ninterest of the stronger, when the rulers unintentionally command things\nto be done which are to their own injury. For if, as you say, justice is\nthe obedience which the subject renders to their commands, in that case, O\nwisest of men, is there any escape from the conclusion that the weaker are\ncommanded to do, not what is for the interest, but what is for the injury\nof the stronger?\n[Sidenote: Socrates, Cleitophon, Polemarchus, Thrasymachus.]\nNothing can be clearer, Socrates, said Polemarchus. {17}\n*340A* Yes, said Cleitophon, interposing, if you are allowed to be his\nwitness.\nBut there is no need of any witness, said Polemarchus, for Thrasymachus\nhimself acknowledges that rulers may sometimes command what is not for\ntheir own interest, and that for subjects to obey them is justice.\n[Sidenote: Cleitophon tries to make a way of escape for Thrasymachus by\ninserting the words 'thought to be.']\nYes, Polemarchus,--Thrasymachus said that for subjects to do what was\ncommanded by their rulers is just.\nYes, Cleitophon, but he also said that justice is the interest *340B* of\nthe stronger, and, while admitting both these propositions, he further\nacknowledged that the stronger may command the weaker who are his subjects\nto do what is not for his own interest; whence follows that justice is the\ninjury quite as much as the interest of the stronger.\nBut, said Cleitophon, he meant by the interest of the stronger what the\nstronger thought to be his interest,--this was what the weaker had to do;\nand this was affirmed by him to be justice.\nThose were not his words, rejoined Polemarchus.\n*340C* Never mind, I replied, if he now says that they are, let us accept\nhis statement. Tell me, Thrasymachus, I said, did you mean by justice what\nthe stronger thought to be his interest, whether really so or not?\n[Sidenote: This evasion is repudiated by Thrasymachus;]\nCertainly not, he said. Do you suppose that I call him who is mistaken the\nstronger at the time when he is mistaken?\nYes, I said, my impression was that you did so, when you admitted that the\nruler was not infallible but might be sometimes mistaken.\n[Sidenote: who adopts another line of defence: 'No artist or ruler is ever\nmistaken _qua_ artist or ruler.']\n*340D* You argue like an informer, Socrates. Do you mean, for example,\nthat he who is mistaken about the sick is a physician in that he is\nmistaken? or that he who errs in arithmetic or grammar is an arithmetician\nor grammarian at the time when he is making the mistake, in respect of the\nmistake? True, we say that the physician or arithmetician or grammarian\nhas made a mistake, but this is only a way of speaking; for the fact is\nthat neither the grammarian nor any other person of skill ever makes a\nmistake in so far as he is what his name implies; they none of them err\nunless their skill fails them, and then they cease to be skilled artists.\n{18} No artist or sage or ruler errs at the time when he is what his name\nimplies; though he is commonly said to err, and *340E* I adopted the\ncommon mode of speaking. But to be perfectly accurate, since you are such\na lover of accuracy, we should say that the ruler, in so far as he is a\nruler, is unerring, and, *341A* being unerring, always commands that which\nis for his own interest; and the subject is required to execute his\ncommands; and therefore, as I said at first and now repeat, justice is the\ninterest of the stronger.\n[Sidenote: Socrates, Thrasymachus.]\nIndeed, Thrasymachus, and do I really appear to you to argue like an\ninformer?\nCertainly, he replied.\nAnd do you suppose that I ask these questions with any design of injuring\nyou in the argument?\nNay, he replied, 'suppose' is not the word--I know it; *341B* but you will\nbe found out, and by sheer force of argument you will never prevail.\nI shall not make the attempt, my dear man; but to avoid any\nmisunderstanding occurring between us in future, let me ask, in what sense\ndo you speak of a ruler or stronger whose interest, as you were saying, he\nbeing the superior, it is just that the inferior should execute--is he a\nruler in the popular or in the strict sense of the term?\nIn the strictest of all senses, he said. And now cheat and play the\ninformer if you can; I ask no quarter at your hands. But you never will be\nable, never.\n[Sidenote: The essential meaning of words distinguished from their\nattributes.]\n*341C* And do you imagine, I said, that I am such a madman as to try and\ncheat, Thrasymachus? I might as well shave a lion.\nWhy, he said, you made the attempt a minute ago, and you failed.\nEnough, I said, of these civilities. It will be better that I should ask\nyou a question: Is the physician, taken in that strict sense of which you\nare speaking, a healer of the sick or a maker of money? And remember that\nI am now speaking of the true physician.\nA healer of the sick, he replied.\nAnd the pilot--that is to say, the true pilot--is he a captain of sailors\nor a mere sailor?\nA captain of sailors. {19}\n*341D* The circumstance that he sails in the ship is not to be taken into\naccount; neither is he to be called a sailor; the name pilot by which he\nis distinguished has nothing to do with sailing, but is significant of his\nskill and of his authority over the sailors.\nVery true, he said.\nNow, I said, every art has an interest?\nCertainly.\nFor which the art has to consider and provide?\nYes, that is the aim of art.\nAnd the interest of any art is the perfection of it--this and nothing\nelse?\n*341E* What do you mean?\nI mean what I may illustrate negatively by the example of the body.\nSuppose you were to ask me whether the body is self-sufficing or has\nwants, I should reply: Certainly the body has wants; for the body may be\nill and require to be cured, and has therefore interests to which the art\nof medicine ministers; and this is the origin and intention of medicine,\nas you will acknowledge. Am I not right?\n*342A* Quite right, he replied.\n[Sidenote: Art has no imperfection to be corrected, and therefore no\nextraneous interest.]\nBut is the art of medicine or any other art faulty or deficient in any\nquality in the same way that the eye may be deficient in sight or the ear\nfail of hearing, and therefore requires another art to provide for the\ninterests of seeing and hearing--has art in itself, I say, any similar\nliability to fault or defect, and does every art require another\nsupplementary art to provide for its interests, and that another and\nanother without end? Or have the arts to look only *342B* after their own\ninterests? Or have they no need either of themselves or of\nanother?--having no faults or defects, they have no need to correct them,\neither by the exercise of their own art or of any other; they have only to\nconsider the interest of their subject-matter. For every art remains pure\nand faultless while remaining true--that is to say, while perfect and\nunimpaired. Take the words in your precise sense, and tell me whether I am\nnot right.\nYes, clearly.\n[Sidenote: Illustrations.]\n*342C* Then medicine does not consider the interest of medicine, but the\ninterest of the body? {20}\nTrue, he said.\nNor does the art of horsemanship consider the interests of the art of\nhorsemanship, but the interests of the horse; neither do any other arts\ncare for themselves, for they have no needs; they care only for that which\nis the subject of their art?\nTrue, he said.\nBut surely, Thrasymachus, the arts are the superiors and rulers of their\nown subjects?\nTo this he assented with a good deal of reluctance.\nThen, I said, no science or art considers or enjoins the interest of the\nstronger or superior, but only the interest *342D* of the subject and\nweaker?\nHe made an attempt to contest this proposition also, but finally\nacquiesced.\nThen, I continued, no physician, in so far as he is a physician, considers\nhis own good in what he prescribes, but the good of his patient; for the\ntrue physician is also a ruler having the human body as a subject, and is\nnot a mere money-maker; that has been admitted?\nYes.\nAnd the pilot likewise, in the strict sense of the term, is a ruler of\nsailors and not a mere sailor?\n*342E* That has been admitted.\nAnd such a pilot and ruler will provide and prescribe for the interest of\nthe sailor who is under him, and not for his own or the ruler's interest?\nHe gave a reluctant 'Yes.'\n[Sidenote: The disinterestedness of rulers.]\nThen, I said, Thrasymachus, there is no one in any rule who, in so far as\nhe is a ruler, considers or enjoins what is for his own interest, but\nalways what is for the interest of his subject or suitable to his art; to\nthat he looks, and that alone he considers in everything which he says and\ndoes.\n*343A* When we had got to this point in the argument, and every one saw\nthat the definition of justice had been completely upset, Thrasymachus,\ninstead of replying to me, said: Tell me, Socrates, have you got a nurse?\n[Sidenote: The impudence of Thrasymachus.]\nWhy do you ask such a question, I said, when you ought rather to be\nanswering?\nBecause she leaves you to snivel, and never wipes your {21} nose: she has\nnot even taught you to know the shepherd from the sheep.\nWhat makes you say that? I replied.\n[Sidenote: Thrasymachus dilates upon the advantages of injustice,]\n[Sidenote: especially when pursued on a great scale.]\\\n[Sidenote: Tyranny.]\n*343B* Because you fancy that the shepherd or neatherd fattens or tends\nthe sheep or oxen with a view to their own good and not to the good of\nhimself or his master; and you further imagine that the rulers of states,\nif they are true rulers, never think of their subjects as sheep, and that\nthey are not studying their own advantage day and night. Oh, no; *343C*\nand so entirely astray are you in your ideas about the just and unjust as\nnot even to know that justice and the just are in reality another's good;\nthat is to say, the interest of the ruler and stronger, and the loss of\nthe subject and servant; and injustice the opposite; for the unjust is\nlord over the truly simple and just: he is the stronger, and his subjects\ndo what is for his interest, and minister to his *343D* happiness, which\nis very far from being their own. Consider further, most foolish Socrates,\nthat the just is always a loser in comparison with the unjust. First of\nall, in private contracts: wherever the unjust is the partner of the just\nyou will find that, when the partnership is dissolved, the unjust man has\nalways more and the just less. Secondly, in their dealings with the State:\nwhen there is an income-tax, the just man will pay more and the unjust\nless on the same amount of income; and when there is anything to be *343E*\nreceived the one gains nothing and the other much. Observe also what\nhappens when they take an office; there is the just man neglecting his\naffairs and perhaps suffering other losses, and getting nothing out of the\npublic, because he is just; moreover he is hated by his friends and\nacquaintance for refusing to serve them in unlawful ways. But all this is\nreversed in the case of the unjust man. I am speaking, as before, *344A*\nof injustice on a large scale in which the advantage of the unjust is most\napparent; and my meaning will be most clearly seen if we turn to that\nhighest form of injustice in which the criminal is the happiest of men,\nand the sufferers or those who refuse to do injustice are the most\nmiserable--that is to say tyranny, which by fraud and force takes away the\nproperty of others, not little by little but wholesale; comprehending in\none, things sacred as well as profane, *344B* private {22} and public; for\nwhich acts of wrong, if he were detected perpetrating any one of them\nsingly, he would be punished and incur great disgrace--they who do such\nwrong in particular cases are called robbers of temples, and man-stealers\nand burglars and swindlers and thieves. But when a man besides taking away\nthe money of the citizens has made slaves of them, then, instead of these\nnames of reproach, he is *344C* termed happy and blessed, not only by the\ncitizens but by all who hear of his having achieved the consummation of\ninjustice. For mankind censure injustice, fearing that they may be the\nvictims of it and not because they shrink from committing it. And thus, as\nI have shown, Socrates, injustice, when on a sufficient scale, has more\nstrength and freedom and mastery than justice; and, as I said at first,\njustice is the interest of the stronger, whereas injustice is a man's own\nprofit and interest.\n[Sidenote: Thrasymachus having made his speech wants to run away, but is\ndetained by the company.]\n*344D* Thrasymachus, when he had thus spoken, having, like a bath-man,\ndeluged our ears with his words, had a mind to go away. But the company\nwould not let him; they insisted that he should remain and defend his\nposition; and I myself added my own humble request that he would not leave\nus. Thrasymachus, I said to him, excellent man, how suggestive are your\nremarks! And are you going to run away before you have fairly taught or\nlearned whether they are true or not? *344E* Is the attempt to determine\nthe way of man's life so small a matter in your eyes--to determine how\nlife may be passed by each one of us to the greatest advantage?\nAnd do I differ from you, he said, as to the importance of the enquiry?\nYou appear rather, I replied, to have no care or thought about us,\nThrasymachus--whether we live better or worse from not knowing what you\nsay you know, is to you a matter of indifference. *345A* Prithee, friend,\ndo not keep your knowledge to yourself; we are a large party; and any\nbenefit which you confer upon us will be amply rewarded. For my own part\nI openly declare that I am not convinced, and that I do not believe\ninjustice to be more gainful than justice, even if uncontrolled and\nallowed to have free play. For, granting that there may be an unjust man\nwho is able to commit injustice either by fraud or force, still this does\nnot convince me of the {23} superior advantage of injustice, and there may\nbe others who are in the same predicament with myself. Perhaps we may be\nwrong; *345B* if so, you in your wisdom should convince us that we are\nmistaken in preferring justice to injustice.\n[Sidenote: The swagger of Thrasymachus.]\nAnd how am I to convince you, he said, if you are not already convinced by\nwhat I have just said; what more can I do for you? Would you have me put\nthe proof bodily into your souls?\nHeaven forbid! I said; I would only ask you to be consistent; or, if you\nchange, change openly and let there be no deception. For I must remark,\nThrasymachus, if you will *345C* recall what was previously said, that\nalthough you began by defining the true physician in an exact sense, you\ndid not observe a like exactness when speaking of the shepherd; you\nthought that the shepherd as a shepherd tends the sheep not with a view to\ntheir own good, but like a mere diner or banquetter with a view to the\npleasures of the table; or, again, as a trader for sale in the market, and\nnot as a shepherd. *345D* Yet surely the art of the shepherd is concerned\nonly with the good of his subjects; he has only to provide the best for\nthem, since the perfection of the art is already ensured whenever all the\nrequirements of it are satisfied. And that was what I was saying just now\nabout the ruler. I conceived that the art of the ruler, considered as\nruler, whether in a *345E* state or in private life, could only regard the\ngood of his flock or subjects; whereas you seem to think that the rulers\nin states, that is to say, the true rulers, like being in authority.\nThink! Nay, I am sure of it.\n[Sidenote: The arts have different functions and are not to be confounded\nwith the art of payment which is common to them all.]\nThen why in the case of lesser offices do men never take them willingly\nwithout payment, unless under the idea that *346A* they govern for the\nadvantage not of themselves but of others? Let me ask you a question: Are\nnot the several arts different, by reason of their each having a separate\nfunction? And, my dear illustrious friend, do say what you think, that we\nmay make a little progress.\nYes, that is the difference, he replied.\nAnd each art gives us a particular good and not merely a general\none--medicine, for example, gives us health; navigation, safety at sea,\nand so on?\nYes, he said. {24}\n*346B* And the art of payment has the special function of giving pay: but\nwe do not confuse this with other arts, any more than the art of the pilot\nis to be confused with the art of medicine, because the health of the\npilot may be improved by a sea voyage. You would not be inclined to say,\nwould you, that navigation is the art of medicine, at least if we are to\nadopt your exact use of language?\nCertainly not.\nOr because a man is in good health when he receives pay you would not say\nthat the art of payment is medicine?\nI should not.\nNor would you say that medicine is the art of receiving pay because a man\ntakes fees when he is engaged in healing?\n*346C* Certainly not.\nAnd we have admitted, I said, that the good of each art is specially\nconfined to the art?\nYes.\nThen, if there be any good which all artists have in common, that is to be\nattributed to something of which they all have the common use?\nTrue, he replied.\nAnd when the artist is benefited by receiving pay the advantage is gained\nby an additional use of the art of pay, which is not the art professed by\nhim?\nHe gave a reluctant assent to this.\n*346D* Then the pay is not derived by the several artists from their\nrespective arts. But the truth is, that while the art of medicine gives\nhealth, and the art of the builder builds a house, another art attends\nthem which is the art of pay. The various arts may be doing their own\nbusiness and benefiting that over which they preside, but would the artist\nreceive any benefit from his art unless he were paid as well?\nI suppose not.\n*346E* But does he therefore confer no benefit when he works for nothing?\nCertainly, he confers a benefit.\n[Sidenote: The true ruler or artist seeks, not his own advantage, but the\nperfection of his art; and therefore he must be paid.]\nThen now, Thrasymachus, there is no longer any doubt that neither arts nor\ngovernments provide for their own interests; but, as we were before\nsaying, they rule and provide for the interests of their subjects who are\nthe weaker {25} and not the stronger--to their good they attend and not to\nthe good of the superior. And this is the reason, my dear Thrasymachus,\nwhy, as I was just now saying, no one is willing to govern; because no one\nlikes to take in hand the reformation of evils which are not his concern\nwithout remuneration. *347A* For, in the execution of his work, and in\ngiving his orders to another, the true artist does not regard his own\ninterest, but always that of his subjects; and therefore in order that\nrulers may be willing to rule, they must be paid in one of three modes of\npayment, money, or honour, or a penalty for refusing.\n[Sidenote: Three modes of paying rulers, money, honour, and a penalty for\nrefusing to rule.]\nWhat do you mean, Socrates? said Glaucon. The first two modes of payment\nare intelligible enough, but what the penalty is I do not understand, or\nhow a penalty can be a payment.\nYou mean that you do not understand the nature of this *347B* payment\nwhich to the best men is the great inducement to rule? Of course you know\nthat ambition and avarice are held to be, as indeed they are, a disgrace?\nVery true.\n[Sidenote: The penalty is the evil of being ruled by an inferior.]\n[Sidenote: In a city composed wholly of good men there would be a great\nunwillingness to rule.]\n[Sidenote: Thrasymachus maintains that the life of the unjust is better\nthan the life of the just.]\nAnd for this reason, I said, money and honour have no attraction for them;\ngood men do not wish to be openly demanding payment for governing and so\nto get the name of hirelings, nor by secretly helping themselves out of\nthe public revenues to get the name of thieves. And not being ambitious\nthey do not care about honour. Wherefore necessity *347C* must be laid\nupon them, and they must be induced to serve from the fear of punishment.\nAnd this, as I imagine, is the reason why the forwardness to take office,\ninstead of waiting to be compelled, has been deemed dishonourable. Now the\nworst part of the punishment is that he who refuses to rule is liable to\nbe ruled by one who is worse than himself. And the fear of this, as I\nconceive, induces the good to take *347D* office, not because they would,\nbut because they cannot help--not under the idea that they are going to\nhave any benefit or enjoyment themselves, but as a necessity, and because\nthey are not able to commit the task of ruling to any one who is better\nthan themselves, or indeed as good. For there is reason to think that if a\ncity were composed entirely of good men, then to avoid office would be as\nmuch an object of contention as to obtain office is at present; then we\nshould {26} have plain proof that the true ruler is not meant by nature to\nregard his own interest, but that of his subjects; and every one who knew\nthis would choose rather to receive a benefit from another than to have\nthe trouble of conferring one. *347E* So far am I from agreeing with\nThrasymachus that justice is the interest of the stronger. This latter\nquestion need not be further discussed at present; but when Thrasymachus\nsays that the life of the unjust is more advantageous than that of the\njust, his new statement appears to me to be of a far more serious\ncharacter. Which of us has spoken truly? And which sort of life, Glaucon,\ndo you prefer?\n[Sidenote: Socrates, Glaucon, Thrasymachus.]\nI for my part deem the life of the just to be the more advantageous, he\nanswered.\n*348A* Did you hear all the advantages of the unjust which Thrasymachus\nwas rehearsing?\nYes, I heard him, he replied, but he has not convinced me.\nThen shall we try to find some way of convincing him, if we can, that he\nis saying what is not true?\nMost certainly, he replied.\nIf, I said, he makes a set speech and we make another recounting all the\nadvantages of being just, and he answers and we rejoin, there must be a\nnumbering and measuring *348B* of the goods which are claimed on either\nside, and in the end we shall want judges to decide; but if we proceed in\nour enquiry as we lately did, by making admissions to one another, we\nshall unite the offices of judge and advocate in our own persons.\nVery good, he said.\nAnd which method do I understand you to prefer? I said.\nThat which you propose.\nWell, then, Thrasymachus, I said, suppose you begin at the beginning and\nanswer me. You say that perfect injustice is more gainful than perfect\njustice?\n*348C* Yes, that is what I say, and I have given you my reasons.\nAnd what is your view about them? Would you call one of them virtue and\nthe other vice?\nCertainly.\nI suppose that you would call justice virtue and injustice vice?\n[Sidenote: A paradox still more extreme, that injustice is virtue,]\nWhat a charming notion! So likely too, seeing that I affirm injustice to\nbe profitable and justice not. {27}\n[Sidenote: Socrates, Thrasymachus.]\nWhat else then would you say?\nThe opposite, he replied.\nAnd would you call justice vice?\nNo, I would rather say sublime simplicity.\n*348D* Then would you call injustice malignity?\nNo; I would rather say discretion.\nAnd do the unjust appear to you to be wise and good?\nYes, he said; at any rate those of them who are able to be perfectly\nunjust, and who have the power of subduing states and nations; but perhaps\nyou imagine me to be talking of cutpurses. Even this profession if\nundetected has advantages, though they are not to be compared with those\nof which I was just now speaking.\n*348E* I do not think that I misapprehend your meaning, Thrasymachus,\nI replied; but still I cannot hear without amazement that you class\ninjustice with wisdom and virtue, and justice with the opposite.\nCertainly I do so class them.\nNow, I said, you are on more substantial and almost unanswerable ground;\nfor if the injustice which you were maintaining to be profitable had been\nadmitted by you as by others to be vice and deformity, an answer might\nhave been given to you on received principles; but now I perceive that\n*349A* you will call injustice honourable and strong, and to the unjust\nyou will attribute all the qualities which were attributed by us before to\nthe just, seeing that you do not hesitate to rank injustice with wisdom\nand virtue.\nYou have guessed most infallibly, he replied.\nThen I certainly ought not to shrink from going through with the argument\nso long as I have reason to think that you, Thrasymachus, are speaking\nyour real mind; for I do believe that you are now in earnest and are not\namusing yourself at our expense.\nI may be in earnest or not, but what is that to you?--to refute the\nargument is your business.\n[Sidenote: refuted by the analogy of the arts.]\n*349B* Very true, I said; that is what I have to do: But will you be so\ngood as answer yet one more question? Does the just man try to gain any\nadvantage over the just?\nFar otherwise; if he did he would not be the simple amusing creature which\nhe is. {28}\nAnd would he try to go beyond just action?\nHe would not.\nAnd how would he regard the attempt to gain an advantage over the unjust;\nwould that be considered by him as just or unjust?\n[Sidenote: The just tries to obtain an advantage over the unjust, but not\nover the just; the unjust over both just and unjust.]\nHe would think it just, and would try to gain the advantage; but he would\nnot be able.\nWhether he would or would not be able, I said, is not to the point. *349C*\nMy question is only whether the just man, while refusing to have more than\nanother just man, would wish and claim to have more than the unjust?\nYes, he would.\nAnd what of the unjust--does he claim to have more than the just man and\nto do more than is just?\nOf course, he said, for he claims to have more than all men.\nAnd the unjust man will strive and struggle to obtain more than the unjust\nman or action, in order that he may have more than all?\nTrue.\nWe may put the matter thus, I said--the just does not desire more than his\nlike but more than his unlike, whereas the unjust desires more than both\nhis like and his unlike?\n*349D* Nothing, he said, can be better than that statement.\nAnd the unjust is good and wise, and the just is neither?\nGood again, he said.\nAnd is not the unjust like the wise and good and the just unlike them?\nOf course, he said, he who is of a certain nature, is like those who are\nof a certain nature; he who is not, not.\nEach of them, I said, is such as his like is?\nCertainly, he replied.\n[Sidenote: Illustrations.]\nVery good, Thrasymachus, I said; and now to take the case of the arts: you\nwould admit that one man is a musician and *349E* another not a musician?\nYes.\nAnd which is wise and which is foolish?\nClearly the musician is wise, and he who is not a musician is foolish.\nAnd he is good in as far as he is wise, and bad in as far as he is\nfoolish? {29}\nYes.\nAnd you would say the same sort of thing of the physician?\nYes.\nAnd do you think, my excellent friend, that a musician when he adjusts the\nlyre would desire or claim to exceed or go beyond a musician in the\ntightening and loosening the strings?\nI do not think that he would.\nBut he would claim to exceed the non-musician?\nOf course.\n*350A* And what would you say of the physician? In prescribing meats and\ndrinks would he wish to go beyond another physician or beyond the practice\nof medicine?\nHe would not.\nBut he would wish to go beyond the non-physician?\nYes.\n[Sidenote: The artist remains within the limits of his art:]\nAnd about knowledge and ignorance in general; see whether you think that\nany man who has knowledge ever would wish to have the choice of saying or\ndoing more than another man who has knowledge. Would he not rather say or\ndo the same as his like in the same case?\nThat, I suppose, can hardly be denied.\nAnd what of the ignorant? would he not desire to have *350B* more than\neither the knowing or the ignorant?\nI dare say.\nAnd the knowing is wise?\nYes.\nAnd the wise is good?\nTrue.\nThen the wise and good will not desire to gain more than his like, but\nmore than his unlike and opposite?\nI suppose so.\nWhereas the bad and ignorant will desire to gain more than both?\nYes.\nBut did we not say, Thrasymachus, that the unjust goes beyond both his\nlike and unlike? Were not these your words?\nThey were.\n[Sidenote: and similarly the just man does not exceed the limits of other\njust men.]\n*350C* And you also said that the just will not go beyond his like but his\nunlike? {30}\nYes.\nThen the just is like the wise and good, and the unjust like the evil and\nignorant?\nThat is the inference.\nAnd each of them is such as his like is?\nThat was admitted.\nThen the just has turned out to be wise and good and the unjust evil and\nignorant.\n[Sidenote: Thrasymachus perspiring and even blushing.]\nThrasymachus made all these admissions, not fluently, as *350D* I repeat\nthem, but with extreme reluctance; it was a hot summer's day, and the\nperspiration poured from him in torrents; and then I saw what I had never\nseen before, Thrasymachus blushing. As we were now agreed that justice was\nvirtue and wisdom, and injustice vice and ignorance, I proceeded to\nanother point:\nWell, I said, Thrasymachus, that matter is now settled; but were we not\nalso saying that injustice had strength; do you remember?\nYes, I remember, he said, but do not suppose that I approve of what you\nare saying or have no answer; if however I were to answer, you would be\nquite certain to accuse me of haranguing; *350E* therefore either permit\nme to have my say out, or if you would rather ask, do so, and I will\nanswer 'Very good,' as they say to story-telling old women, and will nod\n'Yes' and 'No.'\nCertainly not, I said, if contrary to your real opinion.\nYes, he said, I will, to please you, since you will not let me speak. What\nelse would you have?\nNothing in the world, I said; and if you are so disposed I will ask and\nyou shall answer.\nProceed.\nThen I will repeat the question which I asked before, in *351A* order that\nour examination of the relative nature of justice and injustice may be\ncarried on regularly. A statement was made that injustice is stronger and\nmore powerful than justice, but now justice, having been identified with\nwisdom and virtue, is easily shown to be stronger than injustice, if\ninjustice is ignorance; this can no longer be questioned by any one. But\nI want to view the matter, Thrasymachus, in a different way: *351B* You\nwould not deny that a state may be {31} unjust and may be unjustly\nattempting to enslave other states, or may have already enslaved them, and\nmay be holding many of them in subjection?\nTrue, he replied; and I will add that the best and most perfectly unjust\nstate will be most likely to do so.\nI know, I said, that such was your position; but what I would further\nconsider is, whether this power which is possessed by the superior state\ncan exist or be exercised without justice or only with justice.\n[Sidenote: At this point the temper of Thrasymachus begins to improve. Cp.\n5. 450 A, 6. 498 C.]\n*351C* If you are right in your view, and justice is wisdom, then only\nwith justice; but if I am right, then without justice.\nI am delighted, Thrasymachus, to see you not only nodding assent and\ndissent, but making answers which are quite excellent.\nThat is out of civility to you, he replied.\nYou are very kind, I said; and would you have the goodness also to inform\nme, whether you think that a state, or an army, or a band of robbers and\nthieves, or any other gang of evil-doers could act at all if they injured\none another?\n*351D* No indeed, he said, they could not.\nBut if they abstained from injuring one another, then they might act\ntogether better?\nYes.\nAnd this is because injustice creates divisions and hatreds and fighting,\nand justice imparts harmony and friendship; is not that true,\nThrasymachus?\n[Sidenote: Perfect injustice, whether in state or individuals, is\ndestructive to them.]\nI agree, he said, because I do not wish to quarrel with you.\nHow good of you, I said; but I should like to know also whether injustice,\nhaving this tendency to arouse hatred, wherever existing, among slaves or\namong freemen, will not make them hate one another and set them at\nvariance and render them incapable of common action?\nCertainly.\n*351E* And even if injustice be found in two only, will they not quarrel\nand fight, and become enemies to one another and to the just?\nThey will.\nAnd suppose injustice abiding in a single person, would your wisdom say\nthat she loses or that she retains her natural power? {32}\nLet us assume that she retains her power.\nYet is not the power which injustice exercises of such a nature that\nwherever she takes up her abode, whether in a city, in an army, in a\nfamily, or in any other body, that body is, *352A* to begin with, rendered\nincapable of united action by reason of sedition and distraction; and does\nit not become its own enemy and at variance with all that opposes it, and\nwith the just? Is not this the case?\nYes, certainly.\nAnd is not injustice equally fatal when existing in a single person; in\nthe first place rendering him incapable of action because he is not at\nunity with himself, and in the second place making him an enemy to himself\nand the just? Is not that true, Thrasymachus?\nYes.\nAnd O my friend, I said, surely the gods are just?\nGranted that they are.\n*352B* But if so, the unjust will be the enemy of the gods, and the just\nwill be their friend?\nFeast away in triumph, and take your fill of the argument; I will not\noppose you, lest I should displease the company.\n[Sidenote: Recapitulation.]\nWell then, proceed with your answers, and let me have the remainder of my\nrepast. For we have already shown that the just are clearly wiser and\nbetter and abler than the unjust, and that the unjust are incapable of\ncommon action; *352C* nay more, that to speak as we did of men who are\nevil acting at any time vigorously together, is not strictly true, for if\nthey had been perfectly evil, they would have laid hands upon one another;\nbut it is evident that there must have been some remnant of justice in\nthem, which enabled them to combine; if there had not been they would have\ninjured one another as well as their victims; they were but half-villains\nin their enterprises; for had they been whole villains, and utterly\nunjust, they would have been utterly incapable of action. *352D* That, as\nI believe, is the truth of the matter, and not what you said at first. But\nwhether the just have a better and happier life than the unjust is a\nfurther question which we also proposed to consider. I think that they\nhave, and for the reasons which I have given; but still {33} I should like\nto examine further, for no light matter is at stake, nothing less than the\nrule of human life.\nProceed.\n[Sidenote: Illustrations of ends and excellences preparatory to the\nenquiry into the end and excellence of the soul.]\nI will proceed by asking a question: Would you not say that a horse has\nsome end?\n*352E* I should.\nAnd the end or use of a horse or of anything would be that which could not\nbe accomplished, or not so well accomplished, by any other thing?\nI do not understand, he said.\nLet me explain: Can you see, except with the eye?\nCertainly not.\nOr hear, except with the ear?\nNo.\nThese then may be truly said to be the ends of these organs?\nThey may.\n*353A* But you can cut off a vine-branch with a dagger or with a chisel,\nand in many other ways?\nOf course.\nAnd yet not so well as with a pruning-hook made for the purpose?\nTrue.\nMay we not say that this is the end of a pruning-hook?\nWe may.\nThen now I think you will have no difficulty in understanding my meaning\nwhen I asked the question whether the end of anything would be that which\ncould not be accomplished, or not so well accomplished, by any other\nthing?\n*353B* I understand your meaning, he said, and assent.\n[Sidenote: All things which have ends have also virtues and excellences by\nwhich they fulfil those ends.]\nAnd that to which an end is appointed has also an excellence? Need I ask\nagain whether the eye has an end?\nIt has.\nAnd has not the eye an excellence?\nYes.\nAnd the ear has an end and an excellence also?\nTrue.\nAnd the same is true of all other things; they have each of them an end\nand a special excellence?\nThat is so.\nWell, and can the eyes fulfil their end if they are {34} wanting *353C* in\ntheir own proper excellence and have a defect instead?\nHow can they, he said, if they are blind and cannot see?\nYou mean to say, if they have lost their proper excellence, which is\nsight; but I have not arrived at that point yet. I would rather ask the\nquestion more generally, and only enquire whether the things which fulfil\ntheir ends fulfil them by their own proper excellence, and fail of\nfulfilling them by their own defect?\nCertainly, he replied.\nI might say the same of the ears; when deprived of their own proper\nexcellence they cannot fulfil their end?\nTrue.\n*353D* And the same observation will apply to all other things?\nI agree.\n[Sidenote: And the soul has a virtue and an end--the virtue justice, the\nend happiness.]\nWell; and has not the soul an end which nothing else can fulfil? for\nexample, to superintend and command and deliberate and the like. Are not\nthese functions proper to the soul, and can they rightly be assigned to\nany other?\nTo no other.\nAnd is not life to be reckoned among the ends of the soul?\nAssuredly, he said.\nAnd has not the soul an excellence also?\nYes.\n*353E* And can she or can she not fulfil her own ends when deprived of\nthat excellence?\nShe cannot.\nThen an evil soul must necessarily be an evil ruler and superintendent,\nand the good soul a good ruler?\nYes, necessarily.\n[Sidenote: Hence justice and happiness are necessarily connected.]\nAnd we have admitted that justice is the excellence of the soul, and\ninjustice the defect of the soul?\nThat has been admitted.\nThen the just soul and the just man will live well, and the unjust man\nwill live ill?\nThat is what your argument proves.\n*354A* And he who lives well is blessed and happy, and he who lives ill\nthe reverse of happy?\nCertainly.\nThen the just is happy, and the unjust miserable? {35}\nSo be it.\nBut happiness and not misery is profitable.\nOf course.\nThen, my blessed Thrasymachus, injustice can never be more profitable than\njustice.\nLet this, Socrates, he said, be your entertainment at the Bendidea.\n[Sidenote: Socrates is displeased with himself and with the argument.]\nFor which I am indebted to you, I said, now that you have grown gentle\ntowards me and have left off scolding. Nevertheless, *354B* I have not\nbeen well entertained; but that was my own fault and not yours. As an\nepicure snatches a taste of every dish which is successively brought to\ntable, he not having allowed himself time to enjoy the one before, so have\nI gone from one subject to another without having discovered what I sought\nat first, the nature of justice. I left that enquiry and turned away to\nconsider whether justice is virtue and wisdom or evil and folly; and when\nthere arose a further question about the comparative advantages of justice\nand injustice, I could not refrain from passing on to that. And the result\nof the whole discussion has been that I know nothing at all. *354C* For\nI know not what justice is, and therefore I am not likely to know whether\nit is or is not a virtue, nor can I say whether the just man is happy or\nunhappy.\nBOOK II.\n[Sidenote: _Republic II._ Socrates, Glaucon.]\n*357A* With these words I was thinking that I had made an end of the\ndiscussion; but the end, in truth, proved to be only a beginning. For\nGlaucon, who is always the most pugnacious of men, was dissatisfied at\nThrasymachus' retirement; he wanted to have the battle out. So he said to\nme: Socrates, do you wish really to persuade us, or only to seem to *357B*\nhave persuaded us, that to be just is always better than to be unjust?\nI should wish really to persuade you, I replied, if I could.\n[Sidenote: The threefold division of goods.]\nThen you certainly have not succeeded. Let me ask you now:--How would you\narrange goods--are there not some which we welcome for their own sakes,\nand independently of their consequences, as, for example, harmless\npleasures and enjoyments, which delight us at the time, although nothing\nfollows from them?\nI agree in thinking that there is such a class, I replied.\n*357C* Is there not also a second class of goods, such as knowledge,\nsight, health, which are desirable not only in themselves, but also for\ntheir results?\nCertainly, I said.\nAnd would you not recognize a third class, such as gymnastic, and the care\nof the sick, and the physician's art; also the various ways of\nmoney-making--these do us good but we regard them as disagreeable; and no\none would choose them *357D* for their own sakes, but only for the sake of\nsome reward or result which flows from them?\nThere is, I said, this third class also. But why do you ask?\nBecause I want to know in which of the three classes you would place\njustice?\n*358A* In the highest class, I replied,--among those goods which {37} he\nwho would be happy desires both for their own sake and for the sake of\ntheir results.\nThen the many are of another mind; they think that justice is to be\nreckoned in the troublesome class, among goods which are to be pursued for\nthe sake of rewards and of reputation, but in themselves are disagreeable\nand rather to be avoided.\nI know, I said, that this is their manner of thinking, and that this was\nthe thesis which Thrasymachus was maintaining just now, when he censured\njustice and praised injustice. But I am too stupid to be convinced by him.\n[Sidenote: Three heads of the argument:--1. The nature of justice: 2.\nJustice a necessity, but not a good: 3. The reasonableness of this\nnotion.]\n*358B* I wish, he said, that you would hear me as well as him, and then\nI shall see whether you and I agree. For Thrasymachus seems to me, like a\nsnake, to have been charmed by your voice sooner than he ought to have\nbeen; but to my mind the nature of justice and injustice have not yet been\nmade clear. Setting aside their rewards and results, I want to know what\nthey are in themselves, and how they inwardly work in the soul. If you\nplease, then, I will revive the argument of Thrasymachus. *358C* And first\nI will speak of the nature and origin of justice according to the common\nview of them. Secondly, I will show that all men who practise justice do\nso against their will, of necessity, but not as a good. And thirdly,\nI will argue that there is reason in this view, for the life of the unjust\nis after all better far than the life of the just--if what they say is\ntrue, Socrates, since I myself am not of their opinion. But still\nI acknowledge that I am perplexed when I hear the voices of Thrasymachus\nand myriads of others dinning in my ears; and, on the other hand, I have\n*358D* never yet heard the superiority of justice to injustice maintained\nby any one in a satisfactory way. I want to hear justice praised in\nrespect of itself; then I shall be satisfied, and you are the person from\nwhom I think that I am most likely to hear this; and therefore I will\npraise the unjust life to the utmost of my power, and my manner of\nspeaking will indicate the manner in which I desire to hear you too\npraising justice and censuring injustice. Will you say whether you approve\nof my proposal?\nIndeed I do; nor can I imagine any theme about which a man of sense would\noftener wish to converse. {38}\n[Sidenote: Glaucon.]\n*358E* I am delighted, he replied, to hear you say so, and shall begin by\nspeaking, as I proposed, of the nature and origin of justice.\n[Sidenote: Justice a compromise between doing and suffering evil.]\nThey say that to do injustice is, by nature, good; to suffer injustice,\nevil; but that the evil is greater than the good. And so when men have\nboth done and suffered injustice and *359A* have had experience of both,\nnot being able to avoid the one and obtain the other, they think that they\nhad better agree among themselves to have neither; hence there arise laws\nand mutual covenants; and that which is ordained by law is termed by them\nlawful and just. This they affirm to be the origin and nature of\njustice;--it is a mean or compromise, between the best of all, which is to\ndo injustice and not be punished, and the worst of all, which is to suffer\ninjustice without the power of retaliation; and justice, being at a middle\npoint between the two, is tolerated not as a good, but as the lesser evil,\nand honoured by reason of the inability of men to do injustice. *359B* For\nno man who is worthy to be called a man would ever submit to such an\nagreement if he were able to resist; he would be mad if he did. Such is\nthe received account, Socrates, of the nature and origin of justice.\n[Sidenote: The story of Gyges.]\n[Sidenote: The application of the story of Gyges.]\nNow that those who practise justice do so involuntarily and because they\nhave not the power to be unjust will best appear *359C* if we imagine\nsomething of this kind: having given both to the just and the unjust power\nto do what they will, let us watch and see whither desire will lead them;\nthen we shall discover in the very act the just and unjust man to be\nproceeding along the same road, following their interest, which all\nnatures deem to be their good, and are only diverted into the path of\njustice by the force of law. The liberty which we are supposing may be\nmost completely given to them in the form of such a power as is said to\nhave been *359D* possessed by Gyges, the ancestor of Croesus the\nLydian[1]. According to the tradition, Gyges was a shepherd in the service\nof the king of Lydia; there was a great storm, and an earthquake made an\nopening in the earth at the place where he was feeding his flock. Amazed\nat the sight, he {39} descended into the opening, where, among other\nmarvels, he beheld a hollow brazen horse, having doors, at which he\nstooping and looking in saw a dead body of stature, as appeared to him,\nmore than human, and having nothing on but a gold ring; *359E* this he\ntook from the finger of the dead and reascended. Now the shepherds met\ntogether, according to custom, that they might send their monthly report\nabout the flocks to the king; into their assembly he came having the ring\non his finger, and as he was sitting among them he chanced to turn the\ncollet of the ring inside his hand, when instantly he became invisible to\nthe rest of the company and they began to speak of him as if he were no\nlonger present. *360A* He was astonished at this, and again touching the\nring he turned the collet outwards and reappeared; he made several trials\nof the ring, and always with the same result--when he turned the collet\ninwards he became invisible, when outwards he reappeared. Whereupon he\ncontrived to be chosen one of the messengers who were sent to the court;\nwhere as soon as he arrived *360B* he seduced the queen, and with her help\nconspired against the king and slew him, and took the kingdom. Suppose now\nthat there were two such magic rings, and the just put on one of them and\nthe unjust the other; no man can be imagined to be of such an iron nature\nthat he would stand fast in justice. No man would keep his hands off what\nwas not his own when he could safely take what he *360C* liked out of the\nmarket, or go into houses and lie with any one at his pleasure, or kill or\nrelease from prison whom he would, and in all respects be like a God among\nmen. Then the actions of the just would be as the actions of the unjust;\nthey would both come at last to the same point. And this we may truly\naffirm to be a great proof that a man is just, not willingly or because he\nthinks that justice is any good to him individually, but of necessity, for\nwherever any one thinks that he can safely be unjust, there he is unjust.\nFor *360D* all men believe in their hearts that injustice is far more\nprofitable to the individual than justice, and he who argues as I have\nbeen supposing, will say that they are right. If you could imagine any one\nobtaining this power of becoming invisible, and never doing any wrong or\ntouching what was another's, he would be thought by the lookers-on to be a\n{40} most wretched idiot, although they would praise him to one another's\nfaces, and keep up appearances with one another from a fear that they too\nmight suffer injustice. Enough of this.\n[Footnote 1: Reading [Greek: Gu/n\u00ea| t\u00f4=| Kroi/sou tou= Ludou= progo/n\u00f4|.]\n[Sidenote: The unjust to be clothed with power and reputation.]\n[Sidenote: The just to be unclothed of all but his virtue.]\n*360E* Now, if we are to form a real judgment of the life of the just and\nunjust, we must isolate them; there is no other way; and how is the\nisolation to be effected? I answer: Let the unjust man be entirely unjust,\nand the just man entirely just; nothing is to be taken away from either of\nthem, and both are to be perfectly furnished for the work of their\nrespective lives. First, let the unjust be like other distinguished\nmasters of craft; like the skilful pilot or *361A* physician, who knows\nintuitively his own powers and keeps within their limits, and who, if he\nfails at any point, is able to recover himself. So let the unjust make his\nunjust attempts in the right way, and lie hidden if he means to be great\nin his injustice: (he who is found out is nobody:) for the highest reach\nof injustice is, to be deemed just when you are not. Therefore I say that\nin the perfectly unjust man we must assume the most perfect injustice;\nthere is to be no deduction, but we must allow him, while doing the most\nunjust acts, *361B* to have acquired the greatest reputation for justice.\nIf he have taken a false step he must be able to recover himself; he must\nbe one who can speak with effect, if any of his deeds come to light, and\nwho can force his way where force is required by his courage and strength,\nand command of money and friends. And at his side let us place the just\nman in his nobleness and simplicity, wishing, as Aeschylus says, to be and\nnot to seem good. There must be no seeming, *361C* for if he seem to be\njust he will be honoured and rewarded, and then we shall not know whether\nhe is just for the sake of justice or for the sake of honours and rewards;\ntherefore, let him be clothed in justice only, and have no other covering;\nand he must be imagined in a state of life the opposite of the former. Let\nhim be the best of men, and let him be thought the worst; then he will\nhave been put to the proof; and we shall see whether he will be affected\nby the fear of infamy and its consequences. And let him continue *361D*\nthus to the hour of death; being just and seeming to be unjust. When both\nhave reached the uttermost extreme, {41} the one of justice and the other\nof injustice, let judgment be given which of them is the happier of the\ntwo.\n[Sidenote: Socrates, Glaucon.]\nHeavens! my dear Glaucon, I said, how energetically you polish them up for\nthe decision, first one and then the other, as if they were two statues.\n[Sidenote: The just man will learn by each experience that he ought to\nseem and not to be just.]\n[Sidenote: The unjust who appears just will attain every sort of\nprosperity.]\nI do my best, he said. And now that we know what they are like there is no\ndifficulty in tracing out the sort of life *361E* which awaits either of\nthem. This I will proceed to describe; but as you may think the\ndescription a little too coarse, I ask you to suppose, Socrates, that the\nwords which follow are not mine.--Let me put them into the mouths of the\neulogists of injustice: They will tell you that the just man who is\nthought unjust will be scourged, racked, bound--will have his eyes burnt\nout; and, at last, after suffering every kind of evil, he will be impaled:\nThen he will understand that he *362A* ought to seem only, and not to be,\njust; the words of Aeschylus may be more truly spoken of the unjust than\nof the just. For the unjust is pursuing a reality; he does not live with a\nview to appearances--he wants to be really unjust and not to seem only:--\n'His mind has a soil deep and fertile, *362B*\nOut of which spring his prudent counsels.'[2]\nIn the first place, he is thought just, and therefore bears rule in the\ncity; he can marry whom he will, and give in marriage to whom he will;\nalso he can trade and deal where he likes, and always to his own\nadvantage, because he has no misgivings about injustice; and at every\ncontest, whether in public or private, he gets the better of his\nantagonists, and gains at their expense, and is rich, and out of his gains\nhe *362C* can benefit his friends, and harm his enemies; moreover, he can\noffer sacrifices, and dedicate gifts to the gods abundantly and\nmagnificently, and can honour the gods or any man whom he wants to honour\nin a far better style than the just, and therefore he is likely to be\ndearer than they are to the gods. And thus, Socrates, gods and men are\nsaid to unite in making the life of the unjust better than the life of the\njust.\n[Footnote 2: Seven against Thebes, 574.]\n[Sidenote: Adeimantus, Socrates.]\n*362D* I was going to say something in answer to Glaucon, when {42}\nAdeimantus, his brother, interposed: Socrates, he said, you do not suppose\nthat there is nothing more to be urged?\nWhy, what else is there? I answered.\nThe strongest point of all has not been even mentioned, he replied.\nWell, then, according to the proverb, 'Let brother help brother'--if he\nfails in any part do you assist him; although I must confess that Glaucon\nhas already said quite enough to lay me in the dust, and take from me the\npower of helping justice.\n[Sidenote: Adeimantus.]\n[Sidenote: Adeimantus takes up the argument. Justice is praised and\ninjustice blamed, but only out of regard to their consequences.]\n[Sidenote: The rewards and punishments of another life.]\n*362E* Nonsense, he replied. But let me add something more: There is\nanother side to Glaucon's argument about the praise and censure of justice\nand injustice, which is equally required in order to bring out what\nI believe to be his meaning. Parents and tutors are always telling their\nsons and their *363A* wards that they are to be just; but why? not for the\nsake of justice, but for the sake of character and reputation; in the hope\nof obtaining for him who is reputed just some of those offices, marriages,\nand the like which Glaucon has enumerated among the advantages accruing to\nthe unjust from the reputation of justice. More, however, is made of\nappearances by this class of persons than by the others; for they throw in\nthe good opinion of the gods, and will tell you of a shower of benefits\nwhich the heavens, as they say, rain upon the pious; and this accords with\nthe testimony of the noble Hesiod and Homer, the first of whom says, that\nthe gods *363B* make the oaks of the just--\n'To bear acorns at their summit, and bees in the middle;\nAnd the sheep are bowed down with the weight of their fleeces[3],'\nand many other blessings of a like kind are provided for them. And Homer\nhas a very similar strain; for he speaks of one whose fame is--\n'As the fame of some blameless king who, like a god,\nMaintains justice; to whom the black earth brings forth *363C*\nWheat and barley, whose trees are bowed with fruit,\nAnd his sheep never fail to bear, and the sea gives him fish[4].'\nStill grander are the gifts of heaven which Musaeus and his son[5]\nvouchsafe to the just; they take them down into the {43} world below,\nwhere they have the saints lying on couches at a feast, everlastingly\ndrunk, crowned with garlands; *363D* their idea seems to be that an\nimmortality of drunkenness is the highest meed of virtue. Some extend\ntheir rewards yet further; the posterity, as they say, of the faithful and\njust shall survive to the third and fourth generation. This is the style\nin which they praise justice. But about the wicked there is another\nstrain; they bury them in a slough in Hades, and make them carry water in\na sieve; also while they are yet living they bring them to infamy, and\ninflict *363E* upon them the punishments which Glaucon described as the\nportion of the just who are reputed to be unjust; nothing else does their\ninvention supply. Such is their manner of praising the one and censuring\nthe other.\n[Footnote 3: Hesiod, Works and Days, 230.]\n[Footnote 4: Homer, Od. xix. 109.]\n[Footnote 5: Eumolpus.]\n[Sidenote: Men are always repeating that virtue is painful and vice\npleasant.]\n[Sidenote: They are taught that sins may be easily expiated.]\nOnce more, Socrates, I will ask you to consider another way of speaking\nabout justice and injustice, which is not confined to the poets, *364A*\nbut is found in prose writers. The universal voice of mankind is always\ndeclaring that justice and virtue are honourable, but grievous and\ntoilsome; and that the pleasures of vice and injustice are easy of\nattainment, and are only censured by law and opinion. They say also that\nhonesty is for the most part less profitable than dishonesty; and they are\nquite ready to call wicked men happy, and to honour them both in public\nand private when they are rich or in any other way influential, while they\ndespise and overlook *364B* those who may be weak and poor, even though\nacknowledging them to be better than the others. But most extraordinary of\nall is their mode of speaking about virtue and the gods: they say that the\ngods apportion calamity and misery to many good men, and good and\nhappiness to the wicked. And mendicant prophets go to rich men's doors and\npersuade them that they have a power committed to them by the gods of\nmaking an atonement for a man's own or his ancestor's *364C* sins by\nsacrifices or charms, with rejoicings and feasts; and they promise to harm\nan enemy, whether just or unjust, at a small cost; with magic arts and\nincantations binding heaven, as they say, to execute their will. And the\npoets are the authorities to whom they appeal, now smoothing the path of\nvice with the words of Hesiod;-- {44}\n'Vice may be had in abundance without trouble; *364D* the way is smooth\nand her dwelling-place is near. But before virtue the gods have set\ntoil[6],'\nand a tedious and uphill road: then citing Homer as a witness that the\ngods may be influenced by men; for he also says:--\n'The gods, too, may be turned from their purpose; and men pray to them\nand avert their wrath by sacrifices and *364E* soothing entreaties, and\nby libations and the odour of fat, when they have sinned and\ntransgressed[7].'\nAnd they produce a host of books written by Musaeus and Orpheus, who were\nchildren of the Moon and the Muses--that is what they say--according to\nwhich they perform their ritual, and persuade not only individuals, but\nwhole cities, that expiations and atonements for sin may be made by\nsacrifices and amusements which fill a vacant hour, and are equally at the\nservice of the living and the dead; the latter *365A* sort they call\nmysteries, and they redeem us from the pains of hell, but if we neglect\nthem no one knows what awaits us.\n[Footnote 6: Hesiod, Works and Days, 287.]\n[Footnote 7: Homer, Iliad, ix. 493.]\n[Sidenote: The effects of all this upon the youthful mind.]\nHe proceeded: And now when the young hear all this said about virtue and\nvice, and the way in which gods and men regard them, how are their minds\nlikely to be affected, my dear Socrates,--those of them, I mean, who are\nquickwitted, and, like bees on the wing, light on every flower, and from\nall that they hear are prone to draw conclusions as to what manner of\npersons they should be and in what way they *365B* should walk if they\nwould make the best of life? Probably the youth will say to himself in the\nwords of Pindar--\n'Can I by justice or by crooked ways of deceit ascend a loftier tower\nwhich may be a fortress to me all my days?'\n[Sidenote: The existence of the gods is only known to us through the\npoets, who likewise assure us that they may be bribed and that they are\nvery ready to forgive.]\nFor what men say is that, if I am really just and am not also thought just\nprofit there is none, but the pain and loss on the other hand are\nunmistakeable. But if, though unjust, I acquire the reputation of justice,\na heavenly life is promised to me. *365C* Since then, as philosophers\nprove, appearance tyrannizes over truth and is lord of happiness, to\nappearance I must devote myself. I will describe around me a picture and\nshadow of virtue to be the vestibule and exterior of my {45} house; behind\nI will trail the subtle and crafty fox, as Archilochus, greatest of sages,\nrecommends. But I hear some one exclaiming that the concealment of\nwickedness is often difficult; *365D* to which I answer, Nothing great is\neasy. Nevertheless, the argument indicates this, if we would be happy, to\nbe the path along which we should proceed. With a view to concealment we\nwill establish secret brotherhoods and political clubs. And there are\nprofessors of rhetoric who teach the art of persuading courts and\nassemblies; and so, partly by persuasion and partly by force, I shall make\nunlawful gains and not be punished. Still I hear a voice saying that the\ngods cannot be deceived, neither can they be compelled. But what if there\nare no gods? or, suppose them to have no care of human things--why in\neither case *365E* should we mind about concealment? And even if there are\ngods, and they do care about us, yet we know of them only from tradition\nand the genealogies of the poets; and these are the very persons who say\nthat they may be influenced and turned by 'sacrifices and soothing\nentreaties and by offerings.' Let us be consistent then, and believe both\nor neither. If the poets speak truly, why then we had better *366A* be\nunjust, and offer of the fruits of injustice; for if we are just, although\nwe may escape the vengeance of heaven, we shall lose the gains of\ninjustice; but, if we are unjust, we shall keep the gains, and by our\nsinning and praying, and praying and sinning, the gods will be\npropitiated, and we shall not be punished. 'But there is a world below in\nwhich either we or our posterity will suffer for our unjust deeds.' Yes,\nmy friend, will be the reflection, but there are mysteries and atoning\ndeities, and these have great power. That is *366B* what mighty cities\ndeclare; and the children of the gods, who were their poets and prophets,\nbear a like testimony.\n[Sidenote: All this, even if not absolutely true, affords great excuse for\ndoing wrong.]\nOn what principle, then, shall we any longer choose justice rather than\nthe worst injustice? when, if we only unite the latter with a deceitful\nregard to appearances, we shall fare to our mind both with gods and men,\nin life and after death, as the most numerous and the highest authorities\ntell us. *366C* Knowing all this, Socrates, how can a man who has any\nsuperiority of mind or person or rank or wealth, be willing to honour\njustice; or indeed to refrain from laughing when he hears {46} justice\npraised? And even if there should be some one who is able to disprove the\ntruth of my words, and who is satisfied that justice is best, still he is\nnot angry with the unjust, but is very ready to forgive them, because he\nalso *366D* knows that men are not just of their own free will; unless,\nperadventure, there be some one whom the divinity within him may have\ninspired with a hatred of injustice, or who has attained knowledge of the\ntruth--but no other man. He only blames injustice who, owing to cowardice\nor age or some weakness, has not the power of being unjust. And this is\nproved by the fact that when he obtains the power, he immediately becomes\nunjust as far as he can be.\n[Sidenote: Men should be taught that justice is in itself the greatest\ngood and injustice the greatest evil.]\nThe cause of all this, Socrates, was indicated by us at the beginning of\nthe argument, when my brother and I told you how astonished we were to\nfind that of all the professing *366E* panegyrists of justice--beginning\nwith the ancient heroes of whom any memorial has been preserved to us, and\nending with the men of our own time--no one has ever blamed injustice or\npraised justice except with a view to the glories, honours, and benefits\nwhich flow from them. No one has ever adequately described either in verse\nor prose the true essential nature of either of them abiding in the soul,\nand invisible to any human or divine eye; or shown that of all the things\nof a man's soul which he has within him, justice is *367A* the greatest\ngood, and injustice the greatest evil. Had this been the universal strain,\nhad you sought to persuade us of this from our youth upwards, we should\nnot have been on the watch to keep one another from doing wrong, but every\none would have been his own watchman, because afraid, if he did wrong, of\nharbouring in himself the greatest of evils. I dare say that Thrasymachus\nand others would seriously hold the language which I have been merely\nrepeating, and words even stronger than these about justice and injustice,\ngrossly, as I conceive, perverting their true nature. But I speak in this\n*367B* vehement manner, as I must frankly confess to you, because I want\nto hear from you the opposite side; and I would ask you to show not only\nthe superiority which justice has over injustice, but what effect they\nhave on the possessor of them which makes the one to be a good and the\nother an evil to him. And please, as Glaucon requested of you, to {47}\nexclude reputations; for unless you take away from each of them his true\nreputation and add on the false, we shall say that you do not praise\njustice, but the appearance of it; *367C* we shall think that you are only\nexhorting us to keep injustice dark, and that you really agree with\nThrasymachus in thinking that justice is another's good and the interest\nof the stronger, and that injustice is a man's own profit and interest,\nthough injurious to the weaker. Now as you have admitted that justice is\none of that highest class of goods which are desired indeed for their\nresults, but in a far greater *367D* degree for their own sakes--like\nsight or hearing or knowledge or health, or any other real and natural and\nnot merely conventional good--I would ask you in your praise of justice to\nregard one point only: I mean the essential good and evil which justice\nand injustice work in the possessors of them. Let others praise justice\nand censure injustice, magnifying the rewards and honours of the one and\nabusing the other; that is a manner of arguing which, coming from them,\nI am ready to tolerate, but from you who have spent your whole life in the\nconsideration of this question, unless I hear *367E* the contrary from\nyour own lips, I expect something better. And therefore, I say, not only\nprove to us that justice is better than injustice, but show what they\neither of them do to the possessor of them, which makes the one to be a\ngood and the other an evil, whether seen or unseen by gods and men.\n[Sidenote: Adeimantus, Socrates.]\n[Sidenote: Glaucon and Adeimantus able to argue so well, but unconvinced\nby their own arguments.]\nI had always admired the genius of Glaucon and Adeimantus, but on hearing\nthese words I was quite delighted, and said: *368A* Sons of an illustrious\nfather, that was not a bad beginning of the Elegiac verses which the\nadmirer of Glaucon made in honour of you after you had distinguished\nyourselves at the battle of Megara:--\n'Sons of Ariston,' he sang, 'divine offspring of an illustrious hero.'\nThe epithet is very appropriate, for there is something truly divine in\nbeing able to argue as you have done for the superiority of injustice, and\nremaining unconvinced by your own arguments. *368B* And I do believe that\nyou are not convinced--this I infer from your general character, for had\nI judged only from your speeches I should have mistrusted you. But now,\nthe greater my confidence in you, the greater is my {48} difficulty in\nknowing what to say. For I am in a strait between two; on the one hand\nI feel that I am unequal to the task; and my inability is brought home to\nme by the fact that you were not satisfied with the answer which I made to\nThrasymachus, proving, as I thought, the superiority which justice has\nover injustice. And yet I cannot refuse to help, while breath and speech\nremain to me; I am afraid that there would be an impiety in being present\nwhen justice *368C* is evil spoken of and not lifting up a hand in her\ndefence. And therefore I had best give such help as I can.\n[Sidenote: The large letters.]\nGlaucon and the rest entreated me by all means not to let the question\ndrop, but to proceed in the investigation. They wanted to arrive at the\ntruth, first, about the nature of justice and injustice, and secondly,\nabout their relative advantages. I told them, what I really thought, that\nthe enquiry would be of a serious nature, and would require very good\neyes. *368D* Seeing then, I said, that we are no great wits, I think that\nwe had better adopt a method which I may illustrate thus; suppose that a\nshort-sighted person had been asked by some one to read small letters from\na distance; and it occurred to some one else that they might be found in\nanother place which was larger and in which the letters were larger--if\nthey were the same and he could read the larger letters first, and then\nproceed to the lesser--this would have been thought a rare piece of good\nfortune.\nVery true, said Adeimantus; but how does the illustration *368E* apply to\nour enquiry?\nI will tell you, I replied; justice, which is the subject of our enquiry,\nis, as you know, sometimes spoken of as the virtue of an individual, and\nsometimes as the virtue of a State.\nTrue, he replied.\nAnd is not a State larger than an individual?\nIt is.\n[Sidenote: Justice to be seen in the State more easily than in the\nindividual.]\nThen in the larger the quantity of justice is likely to be larger and more\neasily discernible. I propose therefore that we enquire into the nature of\njustice and injustice, first as *369A* they appear in the State, and\nsecondly in the individual, proceeding from the greater to the lesser and\ncomparing them. {49}\nThat, he said, is an excellent proposal.\nAnd if we imagine the State in process of creation, we shall see the\njustice and injustice of the State in process of creation also.\nI dare say.\nWhen the State is completed there may be a hope that the object of our\nsearch will be more easily discovered.\n*369B* Yes, far more easily.\nBut ought we to attempt to construct one? I said; for to do so, as I am\ninclined to think, will be a very serious task. Reflect therefore.\nI have reflected, said Adeimantus, and am anxious that you should proceed.\n[Sidenote: The State arises out of the wants of men.]\nA State, I said, arises, as I conceive, out of the needs of mankind; no\none is self-sufficing, but all of us have many wants. Can any other origin\nof a State be imagined?\nThere can be no other.\n*369C* Then, as we have many wants, and many persons are needed to supply\nthem, one takes a helper for one purpose and another for another; and when\nthese partners and helpers are gathered together in one habitation the\nbody of inhabitants is termed a State.\nTrue, he said.\nAnd they exchange with one another, and one gives, and another receives,\nunder the idea that the exchange will be for their good.\nVery true.\nThen, I said, let us begin and create in idea a State; and yet the true\ncreator is necessity, who is the mother of our invention.\nOf course, he replied.\n[Sidenote: The four or five greater needs of life, and the four or five\nkinds of citizens who correspond to them.]\n*369D* Now the first and greatest of necessities is food, which is the\ncondition of life and existence.\nCertainly.\nThe second is a dwelling, and the third clothing and the like.\nTrue.\nAnd now let us see how our city will be able to supply this great demand:\nWe may suppose that one man is a husbandman, another a builder, some one\nelse a weaver-- {50} shall we add to them a shoemaker, or perhaps some\nother purveyor to our bodily wants?\nQuite right.\nThe barest notion of a State must include four or five men.\n*369E* Clearly.\n[Sidenote: The division of labour.]\nAnd how will they proceed? Will each bring the result of his labours into\na common stock?--the individual husbandman, for example, producing for\nfour, and labouring four times as long and as much as he need in the\nprovision of food with which he supplies others as well as himself; or\nwill he have nothing to do with others and not be at the trouble of\nproducing for them, but provide for himself alone *370A* a fourth of the\nfood in a fourth of the time, and in the remaining three fourths of his\ntime be employed in making a house or a coat or a pair of shoes, having no\npartnership with others, but supplying himself all his own wants?\nAdeimantus thought that he should aim at producing food only and not at\nproducing everything.\nProbably, I replied, that would be the better way; and when I hear you say\nthis, I am myself reminded that we are *370B* not all alike; there are\ndiversities of natures among us which are adapted to different\noccupations.\nVery true.\nAnd will you have a work better done when the workman has many\noccupations, or when he has only one?\nWhen he has only one.\nFurther, there can be no doubt that a work is spoilt when not done at the\nright time?\nNo doubt.\nFor business is not disposed to wait until the doer of the business is at\nleisure; but the doer must follow up what he *370C* is doing, and make the\nbusiness his first object.\nHe must.\nAnd if so, we must infer that all things are produced more plentifully and\neasily and of a better quality when one man does one thing which is\nnatural to him and does it at the right time, and leaves other things.\nUndoubtedly.\n[Sidenote: The first citizens are:--1. a husbandman, 2. a builder. 3. a\nweaver, 4. a shoemaker. To these must be added:--5. a carpenter, 6. a\nsmith, etc., 7. merchants, 8. retailers.]\nThen more than four citizens will be required; for the husbandman will not\nmake his own plough or mattock, or {51} *370D* other implements of\nagriculture, if they are to be good for anything. Neither will the builder\nmake his tools--and he too needs many; and in like manner the weaver and\nshoemaker.\nTrue.\nThen carpenters, and smiths, and many other artisans, will be sharers in\nour little State, which is already beginning to grow?\nTrue.\nYet even if we add neatherds, shepherds, and other herdsmen, *370E* in\norder that our husbandmen may have oxen to plough with, and builders as\nwell as husbandmen may have draught cattle, and curriers and weavers\nfleeces and hides,--still our State will not be very large.\nThat is true; yet neither will it be a very small State which contains all\nthese.\nThen, again, there is the situation of the city--to find a place where\nnothing need be imported is wellnigh impossible.\nImpossible.\nThen there must be another class of citizens who will bring the required\nsupply from another city?\nThere must.\n*371A* But if the trader goes empty-handed, having nothing which they\nrequire who would supply his need, he will come back empty-handed.\nThat is certain.\nAnd therefore what they produce at home must be not only enough for\nthemselves, but such both in quantity and quality as to accommodate those\nfrom whom their wants are supplied.\nVery true.\nThen more husbandmen and more artisans will be required?\nThey will.\nNot to mention the importers and exporters, who are called merchants?\nYes.\nThen we shall want merchants?\nWe shall.\nAnd if merchandise is to be carried over the sea, skilful *371B* sailors\nwill also be needed, and in considerable numbers?\nYes, in considerable numbers.\nThen, again, within the city, how will they exchange their {52}\nproductions? To secure such an exchange was, as you will remember, one of\nour principal objects when we formed them into a society and constituted a\nState.\nClearly they will buy and sell.\nThen they will need a market-place, and a money-token for purposes of\nexchange.\nCertainly.\n[Sidenote: The origin of retail trade.]\n*371C* Suppose now that a husbandman, or an artisan, brings some\nproduction to market, and he comes at a time when there is no one to\nexchange with him,--is he to leave his calling and sit idle in the\nmarket-place?\nNot at all; he will find people there who, seeing the want, undertake the\noffice of salesmen. In well-ordered states they are commonly those who are\nthe weakest in bodily strength, and therefore of little use for any other\npurpose; their duty is *371D* to be in the market, and to give money in\nexchange for goods to those who desire to sell and to take money from\nthose who desire to buy.\nThis want, then, creates a class of retail-traders in our State. Is not\n'retailer' the term which is applied to those who sit in the market-place\nengaged in buying and selling, while those who wander from one city to\nanother are called merchants?\nYes, he said.\n*371E* And there is another class of servants, who are intellectually\nhardly on the level of companionship; still they have plenty of bodily\nstrength for labour, which accordingly they sell, and are called, if I do\nnot mistake, hirelings, hire being the name which is given to the price of\ntheir labour.\nTrue.\nThen hirelings will help to make up our population?\nYes.\nAnd now, Adeimantus, is our State matured and perfected?\nI think so.\nWhere, then, is justice, and where is injustice, and in what part of the\nState did they spring up?\n*372A* Probably in the dealings of these citizens with one another. I\ncannot imagine that they are more likely to be found any where else.\nI dare say that you are right in your suggestion, I said; {53} we had\nbetter think the matter out, and not shrink from the enquiry.\n[Sidenote: A picture of primitive life.]\nLet us then consider, first of all, what will be their way of life, now\nthat we have thus established them. Will they not produce corn, and wine,\nand clothes, and shoes, and build houses for themselves? And when they are\nhoused, they will work, in summer, commonly, stripped and barefoot, but\n*372B* in winter substantially clothed and shod. They will feed on\nbarley-meal and flour of wheat, baking and kneading them, making noble\ncakes and loaves; these they will serve up on a mat of reeds or on clean\nleaves, themselves reclining the while upon beds strewn with yew or\nmyrtle. And they and their children will feast, drinking of the wine which\nthey have made, wearing garlands on their heads, and hymning the praises\nof the gods, in happy converse with one another. *372C* And they will take\ncare that their families do not exceed their means; having an eye to\npoverty or war.\n[Sidenote: Socrates, Glaucon.]\nBut, said Glaucon, interposing, you have not given them a relish to their\nmeal.\nTrue, I replied, I had forgotten; of course they must have a relish--salt,\nand olives, and cheese, and they will boil roots and herbs such as country\npeople prepare; for a dessert we shall give them figs, and peas, and\nbeans; and they will roast myrtle-berries and acorns at the fire, drinking\nin moderation. *372D* And with such a diet they may be expected to live in\npeace and health to a good old age, and bequeath a similar life to their\nchildren after them.\nYes, Socrates, he said, and if you were providing for a city of pigs, how\nelse would you feed the beasts?\nBut what would you have, Glaucon? I replied.\nWhy, he said, you should give them the ordinary conveniences of life.\nPeople who are to be comfortable are accustomed to lie on sofas, and dine\noff tables, and they should *372E* have sauces and sweets in the modern\nstyle.\n[Sidenote: A luxurious State must be called into existence,]\nYes, I said, now I understand: the question which you would have me\nconsider is, not only how a State, but how a luxurious State is created;\nand possibly there is no harm in this, for in such a State we shall be\nmore likely to see how justice and injustice originate. In my opinion the\ntrue and healthy constitution of the State is the one which I have {54}\ndescribed. But if you wish also to see a State at fever-heat, I have no\nobjection. For I suspect that many will not be *373A* satisfied with the\nsimpler way of life. They will be for adding sofas, and tables, and other\nfurniture; also dainties, and perfumes, and incense, and courtesans, and\ncakes, all these not of one sort only, but in every variety; we must go\nbeyond the necessaries of which I was at first speaking, such as houses,\nand clothes, and shoes: the arts of the painter and the embroiderer will\nhave to be set in motion, and gold and ivory and all sorts of materials\nmust be procured.\n*373B* True, he said.\n[Sidenote: and in this many new callings will be required.]\nThen we must enlarge our borders; for the original healthy State is no\nlonger sufficient. Now will the city have to fill and swell with a\nmultitude of callings which are not required by any natural want; such as\nthe whole tribe of hunters and actors, of whom one large class have to do\nwith forms and colours; another will be the votaries of music--poets and\ntheir attendant train of rhapsodists, players, dancers, contractors; also\nmakers of divers kinds of articles, *373C* including women's dresses. And\nwe shall want more servants. Will not tutors be also in request, and\nnurses wet and dry, tirewomen and barbers, as well as confectioners and\ncooks; and swineherds, too, who were not needed and therefore had no place\nin the former edition of our State, but are needed now? They must not be\nforgotten: and there will be animals of many other kinds, if people eat\nthem.\nCertainly.\n*373D* And living in this way we shall have much greater need of\nphysicians than before?\nMuch greater.\nAnd the country which was enough to support the original inhabitants will\nbe too small now, and not enough?\nQuite true.\n[Sidenote: The territory of our State must be enlarged; and hence will\narise war between us and our neighbours.]\nThen a slice of our neighbours' land will be wanted by us for pasture and\ntillage, and they will want a slice of ours, if, like ourselves, they\nexceed the limit of necessity, and give themselves up to the unlimited\naccumulation of wealth?\n*373E* That, Socrates, will be inevitable.\nAnd so we shall go to war, Glaucon. Shall we not?\nMost certainly, he replied. {55}\nThen without determining as yet whether war does good or harm, thus much\nwe may affirm, that now we have discovered war to be derived from causes\nwhich are also the causes of almost all the evils in States, private as\nwell as public.\nUndoubtedly.\nAnd our State must once more enlarge; and this time the enlargement will\nbe nothing short of a whole army, which *374A* will have to go out and\nfight with the invaders for all that we have, as well as for the things\nand persons whom we were describing above.\nWhy? he said; are they not capable of defending themselves?\n[Sidenote: War is an art, and as no art can be pursued with success unless\na man's whole attention is devoted to it, a soldier cannot be allowed to\nexercise any calling but his own.]\nNo, I said; not if we were right in the principle which was acknowledged\nby all of us when we were framing the State: the principle, as you will\nremember, was that one man cannot practise many arts with success.\nVery true, he said.\n*374B* But is not war an art?\nCertainly.\nAnd an art requiring as much attention as shoemaking?\nQuite true.\n[Sidenote: The warrior's art requires a long apprenticeship and many\nnatural gifts.]\nAnd the shoemaker was not allowed by us to be a husbandman, or a weaver,\nor a builder--in order that we might have our shoes well made; but to him\nand to every other worker was assigned one work for which he was by nature\nfitted, and *374C* at that he was to continue working all his life long\nand at no other; he was not to let opportunities slip, and then he would\nbecome a good workman. Now nothing can be more important than that the\nwork of a soldier should be well done. But is war an art so easily\nacquired that a man may be a warrior who is also a husbandman, or\nshoemaker, or other artisan; although no one in the world would be a good\ndice or draught player who merely took up the game as a recreation, and\nhad not from his earliest years devoted himself to this and nothing else?\nNo tools will make a man a skilled workman, or master of defence, nor be\nof any use to him who has not learned how to handle them, and has never\n*374D* bestowed any attention upon them. How then will he who takes up a\nshield or other implement of war become a good {56} fighter all in a day,\nwhether with heavy-armed or any other kind of troops?\nYes, he said, the tools which would teach men their own use would be\nbeyond price.\nAnd the higher the duties of the guardian, I said, the more *374E* time,\nand skill, and art, and application will be needed by him?\nNo doubt, he replied.\nWill he not also require natural aptitude for his calling?\nCertainly.\n[Sidenote: The selection of guardians.]\nThen it will be our duty to select, if we can, natures which are fitted\nfor the task of guarding the city?\nIt will.\nAnd the selection will be no easy matter, I said; but we must be brave and\ndo our best.\n*375A* We must.\nIs not the noble youth very like a well-bred dog in respect of guarding\nand watching?\nWhat do you mean?\nI mean that both of them ought to be quick to see, and swift to overtake\nthe enemy when they see him; and strong too if, when they have caught him,\nthey have to fight with him.\nAll these qualities, he replied, will certainly be required by them.\nWell, and your guardian must be brave if he is to fight well?\nCertainly.\nAnd is he likely to be brave who has no spirit, whether horse or dog or\nany other animal? Have you never observed *375B* how invincible and\nunconquerable is spirit and how the presence of it makes the soul of any\ncreature to be absolutely fearless and indomitable?\nI have.\nThen now we have a clear notion of the bodily qualities which are required\nin the guardian.\nTrue.\nAnd also of the mental ones; his soul is to be full of spirit?\nYes.\nBut are not these spirited natures apt to be savage with one another, and\nwith everybody else? {57}\nA difficulty by no means easy to overcome, he replied.\n*375C* Whereas, I said, they ought to be dangerous to their enemies, and\ngentle to their friends; if not, they will destroy themselves without\nwaiting for their enemies to destroy them.\nTrue, he said.\nWhat is to be done then? I said; how shall we find a gentle nature which\nhas also a great spirit, for the one is the contradiction of the other?\nTrue.\n[Sidenote: The guardian must unite the opposite qualities of gentleness\nand spirit.]\nHe will not be a good guardian who is wanting in either of these two\nqualities; and yet the combination of them *375D* appears to be\nimpossible; and hence we must infer that to be a good guardian is\nimpossible.\nI am afraid that what you say is true, he replied.\nHere feeling perplexed I began to think over what had preceded.--My\nfriend, I said, no wonder that we are in a perplexity; for we have lost\nsight of the image which we had before us.\nWhat do you mean? he said.\nI mean to say that there do exist natures gifted with those opposite\nqualities.\nAnd where do you find them?\n[Sidenote: Such a combination may be observed in the dog.]\nMany animals, I replied, furnish examples of them; our *375E* friend the\ndog is a very good one: you know that well-bred dogs are perfectly gentle\nto their familiars and acquaintances, and the reverse to strangers.\nYes, I know.\nThen there is nothing impossible or out of the order of nature in our\nfinding a guardian who has a similar combination of qualities?\nCertainly not.\nWould not he who is fitted to be a guardian, besides the spirited nature,\nneed to have the qualities of a philosopher?\nI do not apprehend your meaning.\n*376A* The trait of which I am speaking, I replied, may be also seen in\nthe dog, and is remarkable in the animal.\nWhat trait?\n[Sidenote: The dog distinguishes friend and enemy by the criterion of\nknowing and not knowing:]\nWhy, a dog, whenever he sees a stranger, is angry; when an acquaintance,\nhe welcomes him, although the one has {58} never done him any harm, nor\nthe other any good. Did this never strike you as curious?\nThe matter never struck me before; but I quite recognise the truth of your\nremark.\nAnd surely this instinct of the dog is very charming;-- *376B* your dog is\na true philosopher.\nWhy?\nWhy, because he distinguishes the face of a friend and of an enemy only by\nthe criterion of knowing and not knowing. And must not an animal be a\nlover of learning who determines what he likes and dislikes by the test of\nknowledge and ignorance?\nMost assuredly.\n[Sidenote: whereby he is shown to be a philosopher.]\nAnd is not the love of learning the love of wisdom, which is philosophy?\nThey are the same, he replied.\nAnd may we not say confidently of man also, that he who *376C* is likely\nto be gentle to his friends and acquaintances, must by nature be a lover\nof wisdom and knowledge?\nThat we may safely affirm.\nThen he who is to be a really good and noble guardian of the State will\nrequire to unite in himself philosophy and spirit and swiftness and\nstrength?\nUndoubtedly.\n[Sidenote: How are our citizens to be reared and educated?]\nThen we have found the desired natures; and now that we have found them,\nhow are they to be reared and educated? Is not this an enquiry which may\nbe expected to throw light *376D* on the greater enquiry which is our\nfinal end--How do justice and injustice grow up in States? for we do not\nwant either to omit what is to the point or to draw out the argument to an\ninconvenient length.\n[Sidenote: Socrates, Adeimantus.]\nAdeimantus thought that the enquiry would be of great service to us.\nThen, I said, my dear friend, the task must not be given up, even if\nsomewhat long.\nCertainly not.\nCome then, and let us pass a leisure hour in story-telling, and our story\nshall be the education of our heroes.\n*376E* By all means.\nAnd what shall be their education? Can we find a better {59} than the\ntraditional sort?--and this has two divisions, gymnastic for the body, and\nmusic for the soul.\nTrue.\n[Sidenote: Education divided into gymnastic for the body and music for the\nsoul. Music includes literature, which may be true or false.]\nShall we begin education with music, and go on to gymnastic afterwards?\nBy all means.\nAnd when you speak of music, do you include literature or not?\nI do.\nAnd literature may be either true or false?\nYes.\n*377A* And the young should be trained in both kinds, and we begin with\nthe false?\nI do not understand your meaning, he said.\nYou know, I said, that we begin by telling children stories which, though\nnot wholly destitute of truth, are in the main fictitious; and these\nstories are told them when they are not of an age to learn gymnastics.\nVery true.\nThat was my meaning when I said that we must teach music before\ngymnastics.\nQuite right, he said.\n[Sidenote: The beginning the most important part of education.]\nYou know also that the beginning is the most important *377B* part of any\nwork, especially in the case of a young and tender thing; for that is the\ntime at which the character is being formed and the desired impression is\nmore readily taken.\nQuite true.\nAnd shall we just carelessly allow children to hear any casual tales which\nmay be devised by casual persons, and to receive into their minds ideas\nfor the most part the very opposite of those which we should wish them to\nhave when they are grown up?\nWe cannot.\n[Sidenote: Works of fiction to be placed under a censorship.]\nThen the first thing will be to establish a censorship of *377C* the\nwriters of fiction, and let the censors receive any tale of fiction which\nis good, and reject the bad; and we will desire mothers and nurses to tell\ntheir children the authorised ones only. Let them fashion the mind with\nsuch tales, even more fondly than they mould the body with their hands;\nbut most of those which are now in use must be discarded. {60}\nOf what tales are you speaking? he said.\nYou may find a model of the lesser in the greater, I said; *377D* for they\nare necessarily of the same type, and there is the same spirit in both of\nthem.\nVery likely, he replied; but I do not as yet know what you would term the\ngreater.\n[Sidenote: Homer and Hesiod are tellers of bad lies, that is to say, they\ngive false representations of the gods,]\nThose, I said, which are narrated by Homer and Hesiod, and the rest of the\npoets, who have ever been the great story-tellers of mankind.\nBut which stories do you mean, he said; and what fault do you find with\nthem?\nA fault which is most serious, I said; the fault of telling a lie, and,\nwhat is more, a bad lie.\nBut when is this fault committed?\n*377E* Whenever an erroneous representation is made of the nature of gods\nand heroes,--as when a painter paints a portrait not having the shadow of\na likeness to the original.\nYes, he said, that sort of thing is certainly very blameable; but what are\nthe stories which you mean?\nFirst of all, I said, there was that greatest of all lies in high places,\nwhich the poet told about Uranus, and which was a bad lie too,--I mean\nwhat Hesiod says that Uranus did, *378A* and how Cronus retaliated on\nhim[8]. The doings of Cronus, and the sufferings which in turn his son\ninflicted upon him, even if they were true, ought certainly not to be\nlightly told to young and thoughtless persons; if possible, they had\nbetter be buried in silence. But if there is an absolute necessity for\ntheir mention, a chosen few might hear them in a mystery, and they should\nsacrifice not a common [Eleusinian] pig, but some huge and unprocurable\nvictim; and then the number of the hearers will be very few indeed.\n[Footnote 8: Hesiod, Theogony, 154, 459.]\nWhy, yes, said he, those stories are extremely objectionable.\n[Sidenote: which have a bad effect on the minds of youth.]\n*378B* Yes, Adeimantus, they are stories not to be repeated in our State;\nthe young man should not be told that in committing the worst of crimes he\nis far from doing anything outrageous; and that even if he chastises his\nfather when he does wrong, in whatever manner, he will only be following\nthe example of the first and greatest among the gods. {61}\nI entirely agree with you, he said; in my opinion those stories are quite\nunfit to be repeated.\n[Sidenote: The stories about the quarrels of the gods and their evil\nbehaviour to one another are untrue.]\n[Sidenote: And allegorical interpretations of them are not understood by\nthe young.]\nNeither, if we mean our future guardians to regard the habit of\nquarrelling among themselves as of all things the basest, should any word\nbe said to them of the wars in heaven, *378C* and of the plots and\nfightings of the gods against one another, for they are not true. No, we\nshall never mention the battles of the giants, or let them be embroidered\non garments; and we shall be silent about the innumerable other quarrels\nof gods and heroes with their friends and relatives. If they would only\nbelieve us we would tell them that quarrelling is unholy, and that never\nup to this time *378D* has there been any quarrel between citizens; this\nis what old men and old women should begin by telling children; and when\nthey grow up, the poets also should be told to compose for them in a\nsimilar spirit[9]. But the narrative of Hephaestus binding Here his\nmother, or how on another occasion Zeus sent him flying for taking her\npart when she was being beaten, and all the battles of the gods in\nHomer--these tales must not be admitted into our State, whether they are\nsupposed to have an allegorical meaning or not. For a young person cannot\njudge what is allegorical and *378E* what is literal; anything that he\nreceives into his mind at that age is likely to become indelible and\nunalterable; and therefore it is most important that the tales which the\nyoung first hear should be models of virtuous thoughts.\n[Footnote 9: Placing the comma after [Greek: grausi/], and not after\n[Greek: gignome/nois].]\nThere you are right, he replied; but if any one asks where are such models\nto be found and of what tales are you speaking--how shall we answer him?\n*379A* I said to him, You and I, Adeimantus, at this moment are not poets,\nbut founders of a State: now the founders of a State ought to know the\ngeneral forms in which poets should cast their tales, and the limits which\nmust be observed by them, but to make the tales is not their business.\nVery true, he said; but what are these forms of theology which you mean?\n[Sidenote: God is to be represented as he truly is.]\nSomething of this kind, I replied:--God is always to be represented as he\ntruly is, whatever be the sort of poetry, epic, lyric or tragic, in which\nthe representation is given.\nRight. {62}\n*379B* And is he not truly good? and must he not be represented as such?\nCertainly.\nAnd no good thing is hurtful?\nNo, indeed.\nAnd that which is not hurtful hurts not?\nCertainly not.\nAnd that which hurts not does no evil?\nNo.\nAnd can that which does no evil be a cause of evil?\nImpossible.\nAnd the good is advantageous?\nYes.\nAnd therefore the cause of well-being?\nYes.\nIt follows therefore that the good is not the cause of all things, but of\nthe good only?\n*379C* Assuredly.\n[Sidenote: God, if he be good, is the author of good only.]\nThen God, if he be good, is not the author of all things, as the many\nassert, but he is the cause of a few things only, and not of most things\nthat occur to men. For few are the goods of human life, and many are the\nevils, and the good is to be attributed to God alone; of the evils the\ncauses are to be sought elsewhere, and not in him.\nThat appears to me to be most true, he said.\n[Sidenote: The fictions of the poets.]\n[Sidenote: Only that evil which is of the nature of punishment to be\nattributed to God.]\nThen we must not listen to Homer or to any other poet *379D* who is guilty\nof the folly of saying that two casks\n'Lie at the threshold of Zeus, full of lots, one of good, the other of\nevil lots[10],'\nand that he to whom Zeus gives a mixture of the two\n'Sometimes meets with evil fortune, at other times with good;'\nbut that he to whom is given the cup of unmingled ill,\n'Him wild hunger drives o'er the beauteous earth.'\n*379E* And again--\n'Zeus, who is the dispenser of good and evil to us.'\nAnd if any one asserts that the violation of oaths and treaties, {63}\nwhich was really the work of Pandarus[11], was brought about by Athene and\nZeus, or that the strife and contention of the gods was instigated by\nThemis and Zeus[12], he shall not have our approval; neither will we allow\nour young men to hear the words of Aeschylus, that\n*380A* 'God plants guilt among men when he desires utterly to destroy a\nhouse.'\nAnd if a poet writes of the sufferings of Niobe--the subject of the\ntragedy in which these iambic verses occur--or of the house of Pelops, or\nof the Trojan war or on any similar theme, either we must not permit him\nto say that these are the works of God, or if they are of God, he must\ndevise some explanation of them such as we are seeking; he must say that\n*380B* God did what was just and right, and they were the better for being\npunished; but that those who are punished are miserable, and that God is\nthe author of their misery--the poet is not to be permitted to say; though\nhe may say that the wicked are miserable because they require to be\npunished, and are benefited by receiving punishment from God; but that God\nbeing good is the author of evil to any one is to be *380C* strenuously\ndenied, and not to be said or sung or heard in verse or prose by any one\nwhether old or young in any well-ordered commonwealth. Such a fiction is\nsuicidal, ruinous, impious.\n[Footnote 10: Iliad, xxiv. 527.]\n[Footnote 11: Iliad, ii. 69.]\n[Footnote 12: Ib. xx.]\nI agree with you, he replied, and am ready to give my assent to the law.\nLet this then be one of our rules and principles concerning the gods, to\nwhich our poets and reciters will be expected to conform,--that God is not\nthe author of all things, but of good only.\nThat will do, he said.\n*380D* And what do you think of a second principle? Shall I ask you\nwhether God is a magician, and of a nature to appear insidiously now in\none shape, and now in another--sometimes himself changing and passing into\nmany forms, sometimes deceiving us with the semblance of such\ntransformations; or is he one and the same immutably fixed in his own\nproper image? {64}\nI cannot answer you, he said, without more thought.\n[Sidenote: Things must be changed either by another or by themselves.]\nWell, I said; but if we suppose a change in anything, that *380E* change\nmust be effected either by the thing itself, or by some other thing?\nMost certainly.\nAnd things which are at their best are also least liable to be altered or\ndiscomposed; for example, when healthiest and strongest, the human frame\nis least liable to be affected by meats and drinks, and the plant which is\nin the fullest vigour also suffers least from winds or the heat of the sun\nor any similar causes.\nOf course.\n*381A* And will not the bravest and wisest soul be least confused or\nderanged by any external influence?\nTrue.\nAnd the same principle, as I should suppose, applies to all composite\nthings--furniture, houses, garments: when good and well made, they are\nleast altered by time and circumstances.\nVery true.\n*381B* Then everything which is good, whether made by art or nature, or\nboth, is least liable to suffer change from without?\nTrue.\nBut surely God and the things of God are in every way perfect?\nOf course they are.\n[Sidenote: But God cannot be changed by other; and will not be changed by\nhimself.]\nThen he can hardly be compelled by external influence to take many shapes?\nHe cannot.\nBut may he not change and transform himself?\nClearly, he said, that must be the case if he is changed at all.\nAnd will he then change himself for the better and fairer, or for the\nworse and more unsightly?\n*381C* If he change at all he can only change for the worse, for we cannot\nsuppose him to be deficient either in virtue or beauty.\nVery true, Adeimantus; but then, would any one, whether God or man, desire\nto make himself worse?\nImpossible.\nThen it is impossible that God should ever be willing to {65} change;\nbeing, as is supposed, the fairest and best that is conceivable, every God\nremains absolutely and for ever in his own form.\nThat necessarily follows, he said, in my judgment.\n*381D* Then, I said, my dear friend, let none of the poets tell us that\n'The gods, taking the disguise of strangers from other lands, walk up and\ndown cities in all sorts of forms[13];'\nand let no one slander Proteus and Thetis, neither let any one, either in\ntragedy or in any other kind of poetry, introduce Here disguised in the\nlikeness of a priestess asking an alms\n'For the life-giving daughters of Inachus the river of Argos;'\n*381E* --let us have no more lies of that sort. Neither must we have\nmothers under the influence of the poets scaring their children with a bad\nversion of these myths--telling how certain gods, as they say, 'Go about\nby night in the likeness of so many strangers and in divers forms;' but\nlet them take heed lest they make cowards of their children, and at the\nsame time speak blasphemy against the gods.\n[Footnote 13: Hom. Od. xvii. 485.]\nHeaven forbid, he said.\nBut although the gods are themselves unchangeable, still by witchcraft and\ndeception they may make us think that they appear in various forms?\nPerhaps, he replied.\n[Sidenote: Nor will he make any false representation of himself.]\nWell, but can you imagine that God will be willing to lie, whether in word\nor deed, or to put forth a phantom of himself?\n*382A* I cannot say, he replied.\nDo you not know, I said, that the true lie, if such an expression may be\nallowed, is hated of gods and men?\nWhat do you mean? he said.\nI mean that no one is willingly deceived in that which is the truest and\nhighest part of himself, or about the truest and highest matters; there,\nabove all, he is most afraid of a lie having possession of him. {66}\nStill, he said, I do not comprehend you.\n*382B* The reason is, I replied, that you attribute some profound meaning\nto my words; but I am only saying that deception, or being deceived or\nuninformed about the highest realities in the highest part of themselves,\nwhich is the soul, and in that part of them to have and to hold the lie,\nis what mankind least like;--that, I say, is what they utterly detest.\nThere is nothing more hateful to them.\nAnd, as I was just now remarking, this ignorance in the soul of him who is\ndeceived may be called the true lie; for the lie in words is only a kind\nof imitation and shadowy image of a previous affection of the soul, not\npure unadulterated *382C* falsehood. Am I not right?\nPerfectly right.\n[Sidenote: The true lie is equally hated both by gods and men; the\nremedial or preventive lie is comparatively innocent, but God can have no\nneed of it.]\nThe true lie is hated not only by the gods, but also by men?\nYes.\nWhereas the lie in words is in certain cases useful and not hateful; in\ndealing with enemies--that would be an instance; or again, when those whom\nwe call our friends in a fit of madness or illusion are going to do some\nharm, then it is useful and is a sort of medicine or preventive; also in\nthe *382D* tales of mythology, of which we were just now speaking--because\nwe do not know the truth about ancient times, we make falsehood as much\nlike truth as we can, and so turn it to account.\nVery true, he said.\nBut can any of these reasons apply to God? Can we suppose that he is\nignorant of antiquity, and therefore has recourse to invention?\nThat would be ridiculous, he said.\nThen the lying poet has no place in our idea of God?\nI should say not.\nOr perhaps he may tell a lie because he is afraid of enemies?\n*382E* That is inconceivable.\nBut he may have friends who are senseless or mad?\nBut no mad or senseless person can be a friend of God.\nThen no motive can be imagined why God should lie?\nNone whatever. {67}\nThen the superhuman and divine is absolutely incapable of falsehood?\nYes.\nThen is God perfectly simple and true both in word and deed[14]; he\nchanges not; he deceives not, either by sign or word, by dream or waking\nvision.\n[Footnote 14: Omitting [Greek: kata\\ phantasi/as].]\n*383A* Your thoughts, he said, are the reflection of my own.\nYou agree with me then, I said, that this is the second type or form in\nwhich we should write and speak about divine things. The gods are not\nmagicians who transform themselves, neither do they deceive mankind in any\nway.\nI grant that.\n[Sidenote: Away then with the falsehoods of the poets!]\nThen, although we are admirers of Homer, we do not admire the lying dream\nwhich Zeus sends to Agamemnon; neither will we praise the verses of\nAeschylus in which Thetis *383B* says that Apollo at her nuptials\n'Was celebrating in song her fair progeny whose days were to be long, and\nto know no sickness. And when he had spoken of my lot as in all things\nblessed of heaven he raised a note of triumph and cheered my soul. And\nI thought that the word of Phoebus, being divine and full of prophecy,\nwould not fail. And now he himself who uttered the strain, he who was\npresent at the banquet, and who said this--he it is who has slain my\nson[15].'\n[Footnote 15: From a lost play.]\n*383C* These are the kind of sentiments about the gods which will arouse\nour anger; and he who utters them shall be refused a chorus; neither shall\nwe allow teachers to make use of them in the instruction of the young,\nmeaning, as we do, that our guardians, as far as men can be, should be\ntrue worshippers of the gods and like them.\nI entirely agree, he said, in these principles, and promise to make them\nmy laws.\nBOOK III.\n[Sidenote: _Republic III._ Socrates, Adeimantus.]\n[Sidenote: The discouraging lessons of mythology.]\n*386A* Such then, I said, are our principles of theology--some tales are\nto be told, and others are not to be told to our disciples from their\nyouth upwards, if we mean them to honour the gods and their parents, and\nto value friendship with one another.\nYes; and I think that our principles are right, he said.\nBut if they are to be courageous, must they not learn other lessons\nbesides these, and lessons of such a kind as will take *386B* away the\nfear of death? Can any man be courageous who has the fear of death in him?\nCertainly not, he said.\nAnd can he be fearless of death, or will he choose death in battle rather\nthan defeat and slavery, who believes the world below to be real and\nterrible?\nImpossible.\n[Sidenote: The description of the world below in Homer.]\nThen we must assume a control over the narrators of this class of tales as\nwell as over the others, and beg them not simply to revile but rather to\ncommend the world below, *386C* intimating to them that their descriptions\nare untrue, and will do harm to our future warriors.\nThat will be our duty, he said.\n[Sidenote: Such tales to be rejected.]\nThen, I said, we shall have to obliterate many obnoxious passages,\nbeginning with the verses,\n'I would rather be a serf on the land of a poor and portionless man than\nrule over all the dead who have come to nought[1].'\nWe must also expunge the verse, which tells us how Pluto feared,\n*386D* 'Lest the mansions grim and squalid which the gods abhor should\nbe seen both of mortals and immortals[2].' {69}\nAnd again:--\n'O heavens! verily in the house of Hades there is soul and ghostly form\nbut no mind at all[3]!'\nAgain of Tiresias:--\n'[To him even after death did Persephone grant mind,] that he alone\nshould be wise; but the other souls are flitting shades[4].'\nAgain:--\n'The soul flying from the limbs had gone to Hades, lamenting her fate,\nleaving manhood and youth[5].'\nAgain:--\n*387A* 'And the soul, with shrilling cry, passed like smoke beneath the\nearth[6].'\nAnd,--\n'As bats in hollow of mystic cavern, whenever any of them has dropped\nout of the string and falls from the rock, fly shrilling and cling to\none another, so did they with shrilling cry hold together as they\nmoved[7].'\n*387B* And we must beg Homer and the other poets not to be angry if we\nstrike out these and similar passages, not because they are unpoetical, or\nunattractive to the popular ear, but because the greater the poetical\ncharm of them, the less are they meet for the ears of boys and men who are\nmeant to be free, and who should fear slavery more than death.\n[Footnote 1: Od. xi. 489.]\n[Footnote 2: Il. xx. 64.]\n[Footnote 3: Il. xxiii. 103.]\n[Footnote 4: Od. x. 495.]\n[Footnote 5: Il. xvi. 856.]\n[Footnote 6: Ib. xxiii. 100.]\n[Footnote 7: Od. xxiv. 6.]\nUndoubtedly.\nAlso we shall have to reject all the terrible and appalling names which\ndescribe the world below--Cocytus and Styx, *387C* ghosts under the earth,\nand sapless shades, and any similar words of which the very mention causes\na shudder to pass through the inmost soul of him who hears them. I do not\nsay that these horrible stories may not have a use of some kind; but there\nis a danger that the nerves of our guardians may be rendered too excitable\nand effeminate by them.\nThere is a real danger, he said.\nThen we must have no more of them.\nTrue.\nAnother and a nobler strain must be composed and sung by us. {70}\nClearly.\n*387D* And shall we proceed to get rid of the weepings and wailings of\nfamous men?\nThey will go with the rest.\n[Sidenote: The effeminate and pitiful strains of famous men, and yet more\nof the gods, must also be banished.]\nBut shall we be right in getting rid of them? Reflect: our principle is\nthat the good man will not consider death terrible to any other good man\nwho is his comrade.\nYes; that is our principle.\nAnd therefore he will not sorrow for his departed friend as though he had\nsuffered anything terrible?\nHe will not.\nSuch an one, as we further maintain, is sufficient for himself *387E* and\nhis own happiness, and therefore is least in need of other men.\nTrue, he said.\nAnd for this reason the loss of a son or brother, or the deprivation of\nfortune, is to him of all men least terrible.\nAssuredly.\nAnd therefore he will be least likely to lament, and will bear with the\ngreatest equanimity any misfortune of this sort which may befall him.\nYes, he will feel such a misfortune far less than another.\nThen we shall be right in getting rid of the lamentations of famous men,\nand making them over to women (and not *388A* even to women who are good\nfor anything), or to men of a baser sort, that those who are being\neducated by us to be the defenders of their country may scorn to do the\nlike.\nThat will be very right.\n[Sidenote: Such are the laments of Achilles, and Priam, and of Zeus when\nhe beholds the fate of Hector or Sarpedon.]\nThen we will once more entreat Homer and the other poets not to depict\nAchilles[8], who is the son of a goddess, first lying on his side, then on\nhis back, and then on his face; then starting up and sailing in a frenzy\nalong the shores of *388B* the barren sea; now taking the sooty ashes in\nboth his hands[9] and pouring them over his head, or weeping and wailing\nin the various modes which Homer has delineated. Nor should he describe\nPriam the kinsman of the gods as praying and beseeching,\n'Rolling in the dirt, calling each man loudly by his name[10].' {71}\nStill more earnestly will we beg of him at all events not to introduce the\ngods lamenting and saying,\n*388C* 'Alas! my misery! Alas! that I bore the bravest to my\nsorrow[11].'\nBut if he must introduce the gods, at any rate let him not dare so\ncompletely to misrepresent the greatest of the gods, as to make him say--\n'O heavens! with my eyes verily I behold a dear friend of mine chased\nround and round the city, and my heart is sorrowful[12].'\nOr again:--\n'Woe is me that I am fated to have Sarpedon, dearest of *388D* men to\nme, subdued at the hands of Patroclus the son of Menoetius[13].'\nFor if, my sweet Adeimantus, our youth seriously listen to such unworthy\nrepresentations of the gods, instead of laughing at them as they ought,\nhardly will any of them deem that he himself, being but a man, can be\ndishonoured by similar actions; neither will he rebuke any inclination\nwhich may arise in his mind to say and do the like. And instead of having\nany shame or self-control, he will be always whining and lamenting on\nslight occasions.\n[Footnote 8: Il. xxiv. 10.]\n[Footnote 9: Ib. xviii. 23.]\n[Footnote 10: Ib. xxii. 414.]\n[Footnote 11: Il. xviii. 54.]\n[Footnote 12: Ib. xxii. 168.]\n[Footnote 13: Ib. xvi. 433.]\n*388E* Yes, he said, that is most true.\nYes, I replied; but that surely is what ought not to be, as the argument\nhas just proved to us; and by that proof we must abide until it is\ndisproved by a better.\nIt ought not to be.\n[Sidenote: Neither are the guardians to be encouraged to laugh by the\nexample of the gods.]\nNeither ought our guardians to be given to laughter. For a fit of laughter\nwhich has been indulged to excess almost always produces a violent\nreaction.\nSo I believe.\nThen persons of worth, even if only mortal men, must not be represented as\novercome by laughter, and still less must such a representation of the\ngods be allowed.\n*389A* Still less of the gods, as you say, he replied.\nThen we shall not suffer such an expression to be used about the gods as\nthat of Homer when he describes how\n'Inextinguishable laughter arose among the blessed gods, when they saw\nHephaestus bustling about the mansion[14].'\nOn your views, we must not admit them. {72}\n[Footnote 14: Ib. i. 599.]\nOn my views, if you like to father them on me; that we *389B* must not\nadmit them is certain.\n[Sidenote: Our youth must be truthful,]\nAgain, truth should be highly valued; if, as we were saying, a lie is\nuseless to the gods, and useful only as a medicine to men, then the use of\nsuch medicines should be restricted to physicians; private individuals\nhave no business with them.\nClearly not, he said.\nThen if any one at all is to have the privilege of lying, the rulers of\nthe State should be the persons; and they, in their dealings either with\nenemies or with their own citizens, may be allowed to lie for the public\ngood. But nobody else should *389C* meddle with anything of the kind; and\nalthough the rulers have this privilege, for a private man to lie to them\nin return is to be deemed a more heinous fault than for the patient or the\npupil of a gymnasium not to speak the truth about his own bodily illnesses\nto the physician or to the trainer, or for a sailor not to tell the\ncaptain what is happening about the ship and the rest of the crew, and how\nthings are going with himself or his fellow sailors.\nMost true, he said.\n*389D* If, then, the ruler catches anybody beside himself lying in the\nState,\n'Any of the craftsmen, whether he be priest or physician or\ncarpenter[15],'\nhe will punish him for introducing a practice which is equally subversive\nand destructive of ship or State.\n[Footnote 15: Od. xvii. 383 sq.]\nMost certainly, he said, if our idea of the State is ever carried out[16].\n[Footnote 16: Or, 'if his words are accompanied by actions.']\n[Sidenote: and also temperate.]\nIn the next place our youth must be temperate?\nCertainly.\nAre not the chief elements of temperance, speaking *389E* generally,\nobedience to commanders and self-control in sensual pleasures?\nTrue.\nThen we shall approve such language as that of Diomede in Homer,\n'Friend, sit still and obey my word[17],' {73}\nand the verses which follow,\n'The Greeks marched breathing prowess[18], .... in silent awe of their\nleaders[19],'\nand other sentiments of the same kind.\n[Footnote 17: Il. iv. 412.]\n[Footnote 18: Od. iii. 8.]\n[Footnote 19: Ib. iv. 431.]\nWe shall.\nWhat of this line,\n'O heavy with wine, who hast the eyes of a dog and the heart of a\nstag[20],'\n*390A* and of the words which follow? Would you say that these, or any\nsimilar impertinences which private individuals are supposed to address to\ntheir rulers, whether in verse or prose, are well or ill spoken?\n[Footnote 20: Ib. i. 225.]\nThey are ill spoken.\nThey may very possibly afford some amusement, but they do not conduce to\ntemperance. And therefore they are likely to do harm to our young men--you\nwould agree with me there?\nYes.\n[Sidenote: The praises of eating and drinking, and the tale of the\nimproper behaviour of Zeus and Here, are not to be repeated to the young.]\n[Sidenote: The indecent tale of Ares and Aphrodite.]\nAnd then, again, to make the wisest of men say that nothing in his opinion\nis more glorious than\n*390B* 'When the tables are full of bread and meat, and the cup-bearer\ncarries round wine which he draws from the bowl and pours into the\ncups,[21]'\nis it fit or conducive to temperance for a young man to hear such words?\nOr the verse\n'The saddest of fates is to die and meet destiny from hunger[22]'?\nWhat would you say again to the tale of Zeus, who, while other gods and\nmen were asleep and he the only person *390C* awake, lay devising plans,\nbut forgot them all in a moment through his lust, and was so completely\novercome at the sight of Here that he would not even go into the hut, but\nwanted to lie with her on the ground, declaring that he had never been in\nsuch a state of rapture before, even when they first met one another\n'Without the knowledge of their parents[23];' {74}\nor that other tale of how Hephaestus, because of similar goings on, cast a\nchain around Ares and Aphrodite[24]?\n[Footnote 21: Ib. ix. 8.]\n[Footnote 22: Ib. xii. 342.]\n[Footnote 23: Il. xiv. 281.]\n[Footnote 24: Od. viii. 266.]\nIndeed, he said, I am strongly of opinion that they ought not to hear that\nsort of thing.\n[Sidenote: The opposite strain of endurance.]\n*390D* But any deeds of endurance which are done or told by famous men,\nthese they ought to see and hear; as, for example, what is said in the\nverses,\n'He smote his breast, and thus reproached his heart, Endure, my heart;\nfar worse hast thou endured[25]!'\n[Footnote 25: Ib. xx. 17.]\nCertainly, he said.\nIn the next place, we must not let them be receivers of gifts or lovers of\nmoney.\n*390E* Certainly not.\n[Sidenote: Condemnation of Achilles and Phoenix.]\nNeither must we sing to them of\n'Gifts persuading gods, and persuading reverend kings[26].'\nNeither is Phoenix, the tutor of Achilles, to be approved or deemed to\nhave given his pupil good counsel when he told him that he should take the\ngifts of the Greeks and assist them[27]; but that without a gift he should\nnot lay aside his anger. Neither will we believe or acknowledge Achilles\nhimself to have been such a lover of money that he took Agamemnon's gifts,\nor that when he had received payment he restored the dead body of Hector,\nbut that without payment he was unwilling to do so[28].\n[Footnote 26: Quoted by Suidas as attributed to Hesiod.]\n[Footnote 27: Il. ix. 515.]\n[Footnote 28: Ib. xxiv. 175.]\n*391A* Undoubtedly, he said, these are not sentiments which can be\napproved.\n[Sidenote: The impious behaviour of Achilles to Apollo and the river-gods;\nhis cruelty.]\nLoving Homer as I do[29], I hardly like to say that in attributing these\nfeelings to Achilles, or in believing that they are truly attributed to\nhim, he is guilty of downright impiety. As little can I believe the\nnarrative of his insolence to Apollo, where he says,\n'Thou hast wronged me, O far-darter, most abominable of deities. Verily\nI would be even with thee, if I had only the power[30];'\n*391B* or his insubordination to the river-god[31], on whose divinity he\nis ready to lay hands; or his offering to the dead Patroclus {75} of his\nown hair[32], which had been previously dedicated to the other river-god\nSpercheius, and that he actually performed this vow; or that he dragged\nHector round the tomb of Patroclus[33], and slaughtered the captives at\nthe pyre[34]; of all this I cannot believe that he was guilty, any more\nthan I can *391C* allow our citizens to believe that he, the wise\nCheiron's pupil, the son of a goddess and of Peleus who was the gentlest\nof men and third in descent from Zeus, was so disordered in his wits as to\nbe at one time the slave of two seemingly inconsistent passions, meanness,\nnot untainted by avarice, combined with overweening contempt of gods and\nmen.\n[Footnote 29: Cf. _infra_, x. 595.]\n[Footnote 30: Il. xxii. 15 sq.]\n[Footnote 31: Ib. xxi. 130, 223 sq.]\n[Footnote 32: Il. xxiii. 151.]\n[Footnote 33: Ib. xxii. 394.]\n[Footnote 34: Ib. xxiii. 175.]\nYou are quite right, he replied.\n[Sidenote: The tale of Theseus and Peirithous.]\nAnd let us equally refuse to believe, or allow to be repeated, the tale of\nTheseus son of Poseidon, or of Peirithous *391D* son of Zeus, going forth\nas they did to perpetrate a horrid rape; or of any other hero or son of a\ngod daring to do such impious and dreadful things as they falsely ascribe\nto them in our day: and let us further compel the poets to declare either\nthat these acts were not done by them, or that they were not the sons of\ngods;--both in the same breath they shall not be permitted to affirm. We\nwill not have them trying to persuade our youth that the gods are the\nauthors of evil, and that heroes are no better than men--sentiments *391E*\nwhich, as we were saying, are neither pious nor true, for we have already\nproved that evil cannot come from the gods.\nAssuredly not.\n[Sidenote: The bad effect of these mythological tales upon the young.]\nAnd further they are likely to have a bad effect on those who hear them;\nfor everybody will begin to excuse his own vices when he is convinced that\nsimilar wickednesses are always being perpetrated by--\n'The kindred of the gods, the relatives of Zeus, whose ancestral altar,\nthe altar of Zeus, is aloft in air on the peak of Ida,'\nand who have\n'the blood of deities yet flowing in their veins[35].'\nAnd therefore let us put an end to such tales, lest they *392A* engender\nlaxity of morals among the young. {76}\n[Footnote 35: From the Niobe of Aeschylus.]\nBy all means, he replied.\nBut now that we are determining what classes of subjects are or are not to\nbe spoken of, let us see whether any have been omitted by us. The manner\nin which gods and demigods and heroes and the world below should be\ntreated has been already laid down.\nVery true.\n[Sidenote: Misstatements of the poets about men.]\nAnd what shall we say about men? That is clearly the remaining portion of\nour subject.\nClearly so.\nBut we are not in a condition to answer this question at present, my\nfriend.\nWhy not?\nBecause, if I am not mistaken, we shall have to say that *392B* about men\npoets and story-tellers are guilty of making the gravest misstatements\nwhen they tell us that wicked men are often happy, and the good miserable;\nand that injustice is profitable when undetected, but that justice is a\nman's own loss and another's gain--these things we shall forbid them to\nutter, and command them to sing and say the opposite.\nTo be sure we shall, he replied.\nBut if you admit that I am right in this, then I shall maintain that you\nhave implied the principle for which we have been all along contending.\nI grant the truth of your inference.\n*392C* That such things are or are not to be said about men is a question\nwhich we cannot determine until we have discovered what justice is, and\nhow naturally advantageous to the possessor, whether he seem to be just or\nnot.\nMost true, he said.\nEnough of the subjects of poetry: let us now speak of the style; and when\nthis has been considered, both matter and manner will have been completely\ntreated.\nI do not understand what you mean, said Adeimantus.\n*392D* Then I must make you understand; and perhaps I may be more\nintelligible if I put the matter in this way. You are aware, I suppose,\nthat all mythology and poetry is a narration of events, either past,\npresent, or to come?\nCertainly, he replied. {77}\nAnd narration may be either simple narration, or imitation, or a union of\nthe two?\nThat again, he said, I do not quite understand.\n[Sidenote: Analysis of the dramatic element in Epic poetry.]\nI fear that I must be a ridiculous teacher when I have so much difficulty\nin making myself apprehended. Like a bad speaker, therefore, I will not\ntake the whole of the subject, *392E* but will break a piece off in\nillustration of my meaning. You know the first lines of the Iliad, in\nwhich the poet says that *393A* Chryses prayed Agamemnon to release his\ndaughter, and that Agamemnon flew into a passion with him; whereupon\nChryses, failing of his object, invoked the anger of the God against the\nAchaeans. Now as far as these lines,\n'And he prayed all the Greeks, but especially the two sons of Atreus,\nthe chiefs of the people,'\nthe poet is speaking in his own person; he never leads us to suppose that\nhe is any one else. But in what follows he takes the person of Chryses,\nand then he does all that he can *393B* to make us believe that the\nspeaker is not Homer, but the aged priest himself. And in this double form\nhe has cast the entire narrative of the events which occurred at Troy and\nin Ithaca and throughout the Odyssey.\nYes.\nAnd a narrative it remains both in the speeches which the poet recites\nfrom time to time and in the intermediate passages?\nQuite true.\n[Sidenote: Epic poetry has an element of imitation in the speeches; the\nrest is simple narrative.]\n*393C* But when the poet speaks in the person of another, may we not say\nthat he assimilates his style to that of the person who, as he informs\nyou, is going to speak?\nCertainly.\nAnd this assimilation of himself to another, either by the use of voice or\ngesture, is the imitation of the person whose character he assumes?\nOf course.\nThen in this case the narrative of the poet may be said to proceed by way\nof imitation?\nVery true.\n[Sidenote: Illustrations from the beginning of the Iliad.]\nOr, if the poet everywhere appears and never conceals *393D* himself, then\nagain the imitation is dropped, and his poetry becomes simple narration.\nHowever, in order that I may {78} make my meaning quite clear, and that\nyou may no more say, 'I don't understand,' I will show how the change\nmight be effected. If Homer had said, 'The priest came, having his\ndaughter's ransom in his hands, supplicating the Achaeans, and above all\nthe kings;' and then if, instead of speaking in the person of Chryses, he\nhad continued in his own person, the words would have been, not imitation,\nbut simple narration. The passage would have run as follows (I am no poet,\n*393E* and therefore I drop the metre), 'The priest came and prayed the\ngods on behalf of the Greeks that they might capture Troy and return\nsafely home, but begged that they would give him back his daughter, and\ntake the ransom which he brought, and respect the God. Thus he spoke, and\nthe other Greeks revered the priest and assented. But Agamemnon was wroth,\nand bade him depart and not come again, lest the staff and chaplets of the\nGod should be of no avail to him--the daughter of Chryses should not be\nreleased, he said--she should grow old with him in Argos. And then he told\nhim to go away and not to provoke him, if he intended to get home\nunscathed. And the old man went away in fear and *394A* silence, and, when\nhe had left the camp, he called upon Apollo by his many names, reminding\nhim of everything which he had done pleasing to him, whether in building\nhis temples, or in offering sacrifice, and praying that his good deeds\nmight be returned to him, and that the Achaeans might expiate his tears by\nthe arrows of the god,'--and so on. *394B* In this way the whole becomes\nsimple narrative.\nI understand, he said.\n[Sidenote: Tragedy and Comedy are wholly imitative; dithyrambic and some\nother kinds of poetry are devoid of imitation. Epic poetry is a\ncombination of the two.]\nOr you may suppose the opposite case--that the intermediate passages are\nomitted, and the dialogue only left.\nThat also, he said, I understand; you mean, for example, as in tragedy.\nYou have conceived my meaning perfectly; and if I mistake not, what you\nfailed to apprehend before is now made *394C* clear to you, that poetry\nand mythology are, in some cases, wholly imitative--instances of this are\nsupplied by tragedy and comedy; there is likewise the opposite style, in\nwhich the poet is the only speaker--of this the dithyramb affords the best\nexample; and the combination of both is found in epic, and in several\nother styles of poetry. Do I take you with me? {79}\nYes, he said; I see now what you meant.\nI will ask you to remember also what I began by saying, that we had done\nwith the subject and might proceed to the style.\nYes, I remember.\n*394D* In saying this, I intended to imply that we must come to an\nunderstanding about the mimetic art,--whether the poets, in narrating\ntheir stories, are to be allowed by us to imitate, and if so, whether in\nwhole or in part, and if the latter, in what parts; or should all\nimitation be prohibited?\nYou mean, I suspect, to ask whether tragedy and comedy shall be admitted\ninto our State?\n[Sidenote: A hint about Homer (cp. _infra_, bk. x.)]\nYes, I said; but there may be more than this in question: I really do not\nknow as yet, but whither the argument may blow, thither we go.\nAnd go we will, he said.\n[Sidenote: Our guardians ought not to be imitators, for one man can only\ndo one thing well;]\n*394E* Then, Adeimantus, let me ask you whether our guardians ought to be\nimitators; or rather, has not this question been decided by the rule\nalready laid down that one man can only do one thing well, and not many;\nand that if he attempt many, he will altogether fail of gaining much\nreputation in any?\nCertainly.\nAnd this is equally true of imitation; no one man can imitate many things\nas well as he would imitate a single one?\nHe cannot.\n*395A* Then the same person will hardly be able to play a serious part in\nlife, and at the same time to be an imitator and imitate many other parts\nas well; for even when two species of imitation are nearly allied, the\nsame persons cannot succeed in both, as, for example, the writers of\ntragedy and comedy--did you not just now call them imitations?\nYes, I did; and you are right in thinking that the same persons cannot\nsucceed in both.\nAny more than they can be rhapsodists and actors at once?\nTrue.\n*395B* Neither are comic and tragic actors the same; yet all these things\nare but imitations.\nThey are so.\n[Sidenote: he cannot even imitate many things.]\nAnd human nature, Adeimantus, appears to have been {80} coined into yet\nsmaller pieces, and to be as incapable of imitating many things well, as\nof performing well the actions of which the imitations are copies.\nQuite true, he replied.\nIf then we adhere to our original notion and bear in mind that our\nguardians, setting aside every other business, are to *395C* dedicate\nthemselves wholly to the maintenance of freedom in the State, making this\ntheir craft, and engaging in no work which does not bear on this end, they\nought not to practise or imitate anything else; if they imitate at all,\nthey should imitate from youth upward only those characters which are\nsuitable to their profession--the courageous, temperate, holy, free, and\nthe like; but they should not depict or be skilful at imitating any kind\nof illiberality or baseness, lest from imitation they should come to be\nwhat they imitate. Did *395D* you never observe how imitations, beginning\nin early youth and continuing far into life, at length grow into habits\nand become a second nature, affecting body, voice, and mind?\nYes, certainly, he said.\n[Sidenote: Imitations which are of the degrading sort.]\nThen, I said, we will not allow those for whom we profess a care and of\nwhom we say that they ought to be good men, to imitate a woman, whether\nyoung or old, quarrelling with her husband, or striving and vaunting\nagainst the gods in *395E* conceit of her happiness, or when she is in\naffliction, or sorrow, or weeping; and certainly not one who is in\nsickness, love, or labour.\nVery right, he said.\nNeither must they represent slaves, male or female, performing the offices\nof slaves?\nThey must not.\nAnd surely not bad men, whether cowards or any others, who do the reverse\nof what we have just been prescribing, who scold or mock or revile one\nanother in drink or out of drink, or who in any other manner sin against\nthemselves and their neighbours in word or deed, as the manner of such is.\n*396A* Neither should they be trained to imitate the action or speech of\nmen or women who are mad or bad; for madness, like vice, is to be known\nbut not to be practised or imitated.\nVery true, he replied. {81}\nNeither may they imitate smiths or other artificers, or *396B* oarsmen, or\nboatswains, or the like?\nHow can they, he said, when they are not allowed to apply their minds to\nthe callings of any of these?\nNor may they imitate the neighing of horses, the bellowing of bulls, the\nmurmur of rivers and roll of the ocean, thunder, and all that sort of\nthing?\nNay, he said, if madness be forbidden, neither may they copy the behaviour\nof madmen.\nYou mean, I said, if I understand you aright, that there is one sort of\nnarrative style which may be employed by a truly *396C* good man when he\nhas anything to say, and that another sort will be used by a man of an\nopposite character and education.\nAnd which are these two sorts? he asked.\n[Sidenote: Imitations which may be encouraged.]\nSuppose, I answered, that a just and good man in the course of a narration\ncomes on some saying or action of another good man,--I should imagine that\nhe will like to personate him, and will not be ashamed of this sort of\nimitation: he will be most ready to play the part of the good *396D* man\nwhen he is acting firmly and wisely; in a less degree when he is overtaken\nby illness or love or drink, or has met with any other disaster. But when\nhe comes to a character which is unworthy of him, he will not make a study\nof that; he will disdain such a person, and will assume his likeness, if\nat all, for a moment only when he is performing some good action; at other\ntimes he will be ashamed to play a part which he has never practised, nor\nwill he like to fashion and frame himself after the baser models; he feels\nthe *396E* employment of such an art, unless in jest, to be beneath him,\nand his mind revolts at it.\nSo I should expect, he replied.\nThen he will adopt a mode of narration such as we have illustrated out of\nHomer, that is to say, his style will be both imitative and narrative; but\nthere will be very little of the former, and a great deal of the latter.\nDo you agree?\nCertainly, he said; that is the model which such a speaker *397A* must\nnecessarily take.\n[Sidenote: Imitations which are to be prohibited.]\nBut there is another sort of character who will narrate anything, and, the\nworse he is, the more unscrupulous he will be; nothing will be too bad for\nhim: and he will be ready to {82} imitate anything, not as a joke, but in\nright good earnest, and before a large company. As I was just now saying,\nhe will attempt to represent the roll of thunder, the noise of wind and\nhail, or the creaking of wheels, and pulleys, and the various sounds of\nflutes, pipes, trumpets, and all sorts of instruments: he will bark like a\ndog, bleat like *397B* a sheep, or crow like a cock; his entire art will\nconsist in imitation of voice and gesture, and there will be very little\nnarration.\nThat, he said, will be his mode of speaking.\nThese, then, are the two kinds of style?\nYes.\n[Sidenote: Two kinds of style--the one simple, the other multiplex. There\nis also a third which is a combination of the two.]\nAnd you would agree with me in saying that one of them is simple and has\nbut slight changes; and if the harmony and rhythm are also chosen for\ntheir simplicity, the result is that the speaker, if he speaks correctly,\nis always pretty much the same in style, and he will keep within the\nlimits of a single harmony (for the changes are not great), and in *397C*\nlike manner he will make use of nearly the same rhythm?\nThat is quite true, he said.\nWhereas the other requires all sorts of harmonies and all sorts of\nrhythms, if the music and the style are to correspond, because the style\nhas all sorts of changes.\nThat is also perfectly true, he replied.\nAnd do not the two styles, or the mixture of the two, comprehend all\npoetry, and every form of expression in words? No one can say anything\nexcept in one or other of them or in both together.\nThey include all, he said.\n[Sidenote: The simple style alone is to be admitted in the State; the\nattractions of the mixed style are acknowledged, but it appears to be\nexcluded.]\n*397D* And shall we receive into our State all the three styles, or one\nonly of the two unmixed styles? or would you include the mixed?\nI should prefer only to admit the pure imitator of virtue.\nYes, I said, Adeimantus, but the mixed style is also very charming: and\nindeed the pantomimic, which is the opposite of the one chosen by you, is\nthe most popular style with children and their attendants, and with the\nworld in general.\nI do not deny it.\nBut I suppose you would argue that such a style is unsuitable *397E* to\nour State, in which human nature is not twofold or manifold, for one man\nplays one part only? {83}\nYes; quite unsuitable.\nAnd this is the reason why in our State, and in our State only, we shall\nfind a shoemaker to be a shoemaker and not a pilot also, and a husbandman\nto be a husbandman and not a dicast also, and a soldier a soldier and not\na trader also, and the same throughout?\nTrue, he said.\n[Sidenote: The pantomimic artist is to receive great honours, but he is to\nbe sent out of the country.]\n*398A* And therefore when any one of these pantomimic gentlemen, who are\nso clever that they can imitate anything, comes to us, and makes a\nproposal to exhibit himself and his poetry, we will fall down and worship\nhim as a sweet and holy and wonderful being; but we must also inform him\nthat in our State such as he are not permitted to exist; the law will not\nallow them. And so when we have anointed him with myrrh, and set a garland\nof wool upon his head, we shall send him away to another city. For we mean\nto employ for *398B* our souls' health the rougher and severer poet or\nstory-teller, who will imitate the style of the virtuous only, and will\nfollow those models which we prescribed at first when we began the\neducation of our soldiers.\nWe certainly will, he said, if we have the power.\nThen now, my friend, I said, that part of music or literary education\nwhich relates to the story or myth may be considered to be finished; for\nthe matter and manner have both been discussed.\nI think so too, he said.\n*398C* Next in order will follow melody and song.\nThat is obvious.\nEvery one can see already what we ought to say about them, if we are to be\nconsistent with ourselves.\n[Sidenote: Socrates, Glaucon.]\nI fear, said Glaucon, laughing, that the word 'every one' hardly includes\nme, for I cannot at the moment say what they should be; though I may\nguess.\nAt any rate you can tell that a song or ode has three *398D* parts--the\nwords, the melody, and the rhythm; that degree of knowledge I may\npresuppose?\nYes, he said; so much as that you may.\nAnd as for the words, there will surely be no difference between words\nwhich are and which are not set to music; {84} both will conform to the\nsame laws, and these have been already determined by us?\nYes.\n[Sidenote: Melody and rhythm.]\nAnd the melody and rhythm will depend upon the words?\nCertainly.\nWe were saying, when we spoke of the subject-matter, that we had no need\nof lamentation and strains of sorrow?\nTrue.\n*398E* And which are the harmonies expressive of sorrow? You are musical,\nand can tell me.\nThe harmonies which you mean are the mixed or tenor Lydian, and the\nfull-toned or bass Lydian, and such like.\nThese then, I said, must be banished; even to women who have a character\nto maintain they are of no use, and much less to men.\nCertainly.\nIn the next place, drunkenness and softness and indolence are utterly\nunbecoming the character of our guardians.\nUtterly unbecoming.\n[Sidenote: The relaxed melodies or harmonies are the Ionian and the\nLydian. These are to be banished.]\nAnd which are the soft or drinking harmonies?\n*399A* The Ionian, he replied, and the Lydian; they are termed 'relaxed.'\nWell, and are these of any military use?\nQuite the reverse, he replied; and if so the Dorian and the Phrygian are\nthe only ones which you have left.\nI answered: Of the harmonies I know nothing, but I want to have one\nwarlike, to sound the note or accent which a brave man utters in the hour\nof danger and stern resolve, or when his cause is failing, and he is going\nto wounds or *399B* death or is overtaken by some other evil, and at every\nsuch crisis meets the blows of fortune with firm step and a determination\nto endure; and another to be used by him in times of peace and freedom of\naction, when there is no pressure of necessity, and he is seeking to\npersuade God by prayer, or man by instruction and admonition, or on the\nother hand, when he is expressing his willingness to yield to persuasion\nor entreaty or admonition, and which represents him when by prudent\nconduct he has attained his end, not carried away by his success, but\nacting moderately and wisely *399C* under the circumstances, and\nacquiescing in the event. These {85} two harmonies I ask you to leave; the\nstrain of necessity and the strain of freedom, the strain of the\nunfortunate and the strain of the fortunate, the strain of courage, and\nthe strain of temperance; these, I say, leave.\nAnd these, he replied, are the Dorian and Phrygian harmonies of which\nI was just now speaking.\n[Sidenote: The Dorian and Phrygian are to be retained.]\nThen, I said, if these and these only are to be used in our songs and\nmelodies, we shall not want multiplicity of notes or a panharmonic scale?\nI suppose not.\nThen we shall not maintain the artificers of lyres with three corners and\ncomplex scales, or the makers of any other *399D* many-stringed\ncuriously-harmonised instruments?\nCertainly not.\n[Sidenote: Musical instruments--which are to be rejected and which\nallowed?]\nBut what do you say to flute-makers and flute-players? Would you admit\nthem into our State when you reflect that in this composite use of harmony\nthe flute is worse than all the stringed instruments put together; even\nthe panharmonic music is only an imitation of the flute?\nClearly not.\nThere remain then only the lyre and the harp for use in the city, and the\nshepherds may have a pipe in the country.\nThat is surely the conclusion to be drawn from the argument.\n*399E* The preferring of Apollo and his instruments to Marsyas and his\ninstruments is not at all strange, I said.\nNot at all, he replied.\nAnd so, by the dog of Egypt, we have been unconsciously purging the State,\nwhich not long ago we termed luxurious.\nAnd we have done wisely, he replied.\nThen let us now finish the purgation, I said. Next in order to harmonies,\nrhythms will naturally follow, and they should be subject to the same\nrules, for we ought not to seek out complex systems of metre, or metres of\nevery kind, but rather to discover what rhythms are the expressions of\n*400A* a courageous and harmonious life; and when we have found them, we\nshall adapt the foot and the melody to words having a like spirit, not the\nwords to the foot and melody. To say what these rhythms are will be your\nduty--you must teach me them, as you have already taught me the harmonies.\n{86}\n[Sidenote: Three kinds of rhythm as there are four notes of the\ntetrachord.]\nBut, indeed, he replied, I cannot tell you. I only know that there are\nsome three principles of rhythm out of which metrical systems are framed,\njust as in sounds there are four notes[36] out of which all the harmonies\nare composed; that is an observation which I have made. But of what sort\nof lives they are severally the imitations I am unable to say.\n[Footnote 36: i.e. the four notes of the tetrachord.]\n*400B* Then, I said, we must take Damon into our counsels; and he will\ntell us what rhythms are expressive of meanness, or insolence, or fury, or\nother unworthiness, and what are to be reserved for the expression of\nopposite feelings. And I think that I have an indistinct recollection of\nhis mentioning a complex Cretic rhythm; also a dactylic or heroic, and he\narranged them in some manner which I do not quite understand, making the\nrhythms equal in the rise and fall of the foot, long and short\nalternating; and, unless I am mistaken, he spoke of an iambic as well as\nof a trochaic rhythm, *400C* and assigned to them short and long\nquantities.[37] Also in some cases he appeared to praise or censure the\nmovement of the foot quite as much as the rhythm; or perhaps a combination\nof the two; for I am not certain what he meant. These matters, however, as\nI was saying, had better be referred to Damon himself, for the analysis of\nthe subject would be difficult, you know?\n[Footnote 37: Socrates expresses himself carelessly in accordance with his\nassumed ignorance of the details of the subject. In the first part of the\nsentence he appears to be speaking of paeonic rhythms which are in the\nratio of 3/2; in the second part, of dactylic and anapaestic rhythms,\nwhich are in the ratio of 1/1; in the last clause, of iambic and trochaic\nrhythms, which are in the ratio of 1/2 or 2/1.]\nRather so, I should say.\nBut there is no difficulty in seeing that grace or the absence of grace is\nan effect of good or bad rhythm.\nNone at all.\n[Sidenote: Rhythm and harmony follow style, and style is the expression of\nthe soul.]\n*400D* And also that good and bad rhythm naturally assimilate to a good\nand bad style; and that harmony and discord in like manner follow style;\nfor our principle is that rhythm and harmony are regulated by the words,\nand not the words by them.\nJust so, he said, they should follow the words.\nAnd will not the words and the character of the style depend on the temper\nof the soul? {87}\nYes.\nAnd everything else on the style?\nYes.\n[Sidenote: Simplicity the great first principle;]\nThen beauty of style and harmony and grace and good *400E* rhythm depend\non simplicity,--I mean the true simplicity of a rightly and nobly ordered\nmind and character, not that other simplicity which is only an euphemism\nfor folly?\nVery true, he replied.\nAnd if our youth are to do their work in life, must they not make these\ngraces and harmonies their perpetual aim?\nThey must.\n[Sidenote: and a principle which is widely spread in nature and art.]\n*401A* And surely the art of the painter and every other creative and\nconstructive art are full of them,--weaving, embroidery, architecture, and\nevery kind of manufacture; also nature, animal and vegetable,--in all of\nthem there is grace or the absence of grace. And ugliness and discord and\ninharmonious motion are nearly allied to ill words and ill nature, as\ngrace and harmony are the twin sisters of goodness and virtue and bear\ntheir likeness.\nThat is quite true, he said.\n[Sidenote: Our citizens must grow up to manhood amidst impressions of\ngrace and beauty only; all ugliness and vice must be excluded.]\n*401B* But shall our superintendence go no further, and are the poets only\nto be required by us to express the image of the good in their works, on\npain, if they do anything else, of expulsion from our State? Or is the\nsame control to be extended to other artists, and are they also to be\nprohibited from exhibiting the opposite forms of vice and intemperance and\nmeanness and indecency in sculpture and building and the other creative\narts; and is he who cannot conform to this rule of ours to be prevented\nfrom practising his art in our State, lest the taste of our citizens be\ncorrupted by him? We would not have our guardians grow up amid images of\nmoral deformity, as in some noxious pasture, and there *401C* browse and\nfeed upon many a baneful herb and flower day by day, little by little,\nuntil they silently gather a festering mass of corruption in their own\nsoul. Let our artists rather be those who are gifted to discern the true\nnature of the beautiful and graceful; then will our youth dwell in a land\nof health, amid fair sights and sounds, and receive the good in\neverything; and beauty, the effluence of fair works, shall *401D* flow\ninto the eye and ear, like a health-giving breeze from a purer region, and\n{88} insensibly draw the soul from earliest years into likeness and\nsympathy with the beauty of reason.\nThere can be no nobler training than that, he replied.\n[Sidenote: The power of imparting grace is possessed by harmony.]\nAnd therefore, I said, Glaucon, musical training is a more potent\ninstrument than any other, because rhythm and harmony find their way into\nthe inward places of the soul, on which they mightily fasten, imparting\ngrace, and making the soul of him who is rightly educated graceful, or of\nhim who *401E* is ill-educated ungraceful; and also because he who has\nreceived this true education of the inner being will most shrewdly\nperceive omissions or faults in art and nature, and *402A* with a true\ntaste, while he praises and rejoices over and receives into his soul the\ngood, and becomes noble and good, he will justly blame and hate the bad,\nnow in the days of his youth, even before he is able to know the reason\nwhy; and when reason comes he will recognise and salute the friend with\nwhom his education has made him long familiar.\nYes, he said, I quite agree with you in thinking that our youth should be\ntrained in music and on the grounds which you mention.\nJust as in learning to read, I said, we were satisfied when we knew the\nletters of the alphabet, which are very few, in all their recurring sizes\nand combinations; not slighting them *402B* as unimportant whether they\noccupy a space large or small, but everywhere eager to make them out; and\nnot thinking ourselves perfect in the art of reading until we recognise\nthem wherever they are found[38]:\n[Footnote 38: Cp. _supra_, II. 368 D.]\nTrue--\nOr, as we recognise the reflection of letters in the water, or in a\nmirror, only when we know the letters themselves; the same art and study\ngiving us the knowledge of both:\nExactly--\n[Sidenote: The true musician must know the essential forms of virtue and\nvice.]\nEven so, as I maintain, neither we nor our guardians, whom *402C* we have\nto educate, can ever become musical until we and they know the essential\nforms of temperance, courage, liberality, magnificence, and their kindred,\nas well as the contrary forms, in all their combinations, and can\nrecognise them and their images wherever they are found, not slighting\n{89} them either in small things or great, but believing them all to be\nwithin the sphere of one art and study.\nMost assuredly.\n[Sidenote: The harmony of soul and body the fairest of sights.]\n*402D* And when a beautiful soul harmonizes with a beautiful form, and the\ntwo are cast in one mould, that will be the fairest of sights to him who\nhas an eye to see it?\nThe fairest indeed.\nAnd the fairest is also the loveliest?\nThat may be assumed.\nAnd the man who has the spirit of harmony will be most in love with the\nloveliest; but he will not love him who is of an inharmonious soul?\n[Sidenote: The true lover will not mind defects of the person.]\nThat is true, he replied, if the deficiency be in his soul; but if there\nbe any merely bodily defect in another he will *402E* be patient of it,\nand will love all the same.\nI perceive, I said, that you have or have had experiences of this sort,\nand I agree. But let me ask you another question: Has excess of pleasure\nany affinity to temperance?\nHow can that be? he replied; pleasure deprives a man of the use of his\nfaculties quite as much as pain.\nOr any affinity to virtue in general?\n*403A* None whatever.\nAny affinity to wantonness and intemperance?\nYes, the greatest.\nAnd is there any greater or keener pleasure than that of sensual love?\nNo, nor a madder.\n[Sidenote: True love is temperate and harmonious.]\nWhereas true love is a love of beauty and order--temperate and harmonious?\nQuite true, he said.\nThen no intemperance or madness should be allowed to approach true love?\nCertainly not.\n[Sidenote: True love is free from sensuality and coarseness.]\n*403B* Then mad or intemperate pleasure must never be allowed to come near\nthe lover and his beloved; neither of them can have any part in it if\ntheir love is of the right sort?\nNo, indeed, Socrates, it must never come near them.\nThen I suppose that in the city which we are founding you would make a law\nto the effect that a friend should use no other familiarity to his love\nthan a father would use to his {90} son, and then only for a noble\npurpose, and he must first have the other's consent; and this rule is to\nlimit him in *403C* all his intercourse, and he is never to be seen going\nfurther, or, if he exceeds, he is to be deemed guilty of coarseness and\nbad taste.\nI quite agree, he said.\nThus much of music, which makes a fair ending; for what should be the end\nof music if not the love of beauty?\nI agree, he said.\n[Sidenote: Gymnastic.]\nAfter music comes gymnastic, in which our youth are next to be trained.\nCertainly.\nGymnastic as well as music should begin in early years; the training in it\nshould be careful and should continue through life. *403D* Now my belief\nis,--and this is a matter upon which I should like to have your opinion in\nconfirmation of my own, but my own belief is,--not that the good body by\nany bodily excellence improves the soul, but, on the contrary, that the\ngood soul, by her own excellence, improves the body as far as this may be\npossible. What do you say?\nYes, I agree.\n[Sidenote: The body to be entrusted to the mind.]\nThen, to the mind when adequately trained, we shall be right in handing\nover the more particular care of the body; *403E* and in order to avoid\nprolixity we will now only give the general outlines of the subject.\nVery good.\nThat they must abstain from intoxication has been already remarked by us;\nfor of all persons a guardian should be the last to get drunk and not know\nwhere in the world he is.\nYes, he said; that a guardian should require another guardian to take care\nof him is ridiculous indeed.\nBut next, what shall we say of their food; for the men are in training for\nthe great contest of all--are they not?\nYes, he said.\n*404A* And will the habit of body of our ordinary athletes be suited to\nthem?\nWhy not?\n[Sidenote: The usual training of athletes too gross and sleepy.]\nI am afraid, I said, that a habit of body such as they have is but a\nsleepy sort of thing, and rather perilous to health. Do you not observe\nthat these athletes sleep away their {91} lives, and are liable to most\ndangerous illnesses if they depart, in ever so slight a degree, from their\ncustomary regimen?\nYes, I do.\nThen, I said, a finer sort of training will be required for our warrior\nathletes, who are to be like wakeful dogs, and to see and hear with the\nutmost keenness; amid the many changes of water and also of food, of\nsummer heat and winter *404B* cold, which they will have to endure when on\na campaign, they must not be liable to break down in health.\nThat is my view.\nThe really excellent gymnastic is twin sister of that simple music which\nwe were just now describing.\nHow so?\n[Sidenote: Military gymnastic.]\nWhy, I conceive that there is a gymnastic which, like our music, is simple\nand good; and especially the military gymnastic.\nWhat do you mean?\nMy meaning may be learned from Homer; he, you know, feeds his heroes at\ntheir feasts, when they are campaigning, on soldiers' fare; they have no\nfish, although they are on *404C* the shores of the Hellespont, and they\nare not allowed boiled meats but only roast, which is the food most\nconvenient for soldiers, requiring only that they should light a fire, and\nnot involving the trouble of carrying about pots and pans.\nTrue.\nAnd I can hardly be mistaken in saying that sweet sauces are nowhere\nmentioned in Homer. In proscribing them, however, he is not singular; all\nprofessional athletes are well aware that a man who is to be in good\ncondition should take nothing of the kind.\nYes, he said; and knowing this, they are quite right in not taking them.\n[Sidenote: Syracusan dinners and Corinthian courtezans are prohibited.]\n*404D* Then you would not approve of Syracusan dinners, and the\nrefinements of Sicilian cookery?\nI think not.\nNor, if a man is to be in condition, would you allow him to have a\nCorinthian girl as his fair friend?\nCertainly not. {92}\nNeither would you approve of the delicacies, as they are thought, of\nAthenian confectionary?\nCertainly not.\n[Sidenote: The luxurious style of living may be justly compared to the\npanharmonic strain of music.]\nAll such feeding and living may be rightly compared by us *404E* to melody\nand song composed in the panharmonic style, and in all the rhythms.\nExactly.\nThere complexity engendered licence, and here disease; whereas simplicity\nin music was the parent of temperance in the soul; and simplicity in\ngymnastic of health in the body.\nMost true, he said.\n*405A* But when intemperance and diseases multiply in a State, halls of\njustice and medicine are always being opened; and the arts of the doctor\nand the lawyer give themselves airs, finding how keen is the interest\nwhich not only the slaves but the freemen of a city take about them.\nOf course.\n[Sidenote: Every man should be his own doctor and lawyer.]\nAnd yet what greater proof can there be of a bad and disgraceful state of\neducation than this, that not only artisans and the meaner sort of people\nneed the skill of first-rate physicians and judges, but also those who\nwould profess to *405B* have had a liberal education? Is it not\ndisgraceful, and a great sign of want of good-breeding, that a man should\nhave to go abroad for his law and physic because he has none of his own at\nhome, and must therefore surrender himself into the hands of other men\nwhom he makes lords and judges over him?\nOf all things, he said, the most disgraceful.\n[Sidenote: Bad as it is to go to law, it is still worse to be a lover of\nlitigation.]\nWould you say 'most,' I replied, when you consider that there is a further\nstage of the evil in which a man is not only a life-long litigant, passing\nall his days in the courts, either as plaintiff or defendant, but is\nactually led by his bad taste to pride himself on his litigiousness; he\nimagines that he is *405C* a master in dishonesty; able to take every\ncrooked turn, and wriggle into and out of every hole, bending like a withy\nand getting out of the way of justice: and all for what?--in order to gain\nsmall points not worth mentioning, he not knowing that so to order his\nlife as to be able to do without a napping judge is a far higher and\nnobler sort of thing. Is not that still more disgraceful? {93}\nYes, he said, that is still more disgraceful.\n[Sidenote: Bad also to require the help of medicine.]\nWell, I said, and to require the help of medicine, not when a wound has to\nbe cured, or on occasion of an epidemic, but *405D* just because, by\nindolence and a habit of life such as we have been describing, men fill\nthemselves with waters and winds, as if their bodies were a marsh,\ncompelling the ingenious sons of Asclepius to find more names for\ndiseases, such as flatulence and catarrh; is not this, too, a disgrace?\nYes, he said, they do certainly give very strange and newfangled names to\ndiseases.\n[Sidenote: In the time of Asclepius and of Homer the practice of medicine\nwas very simple.]\nYes, I said, and I do not believe that there were any such *405E* diseases\nin the days of Asclepius; and this I infer from the circumstance that the\nhero Eurypylus, after he has been wounded in Homer, drinks a posset of\nPramnian wine well *406A* besprinkled with barley-meal and grated cheese,\nwhich are certainly inflammatory, and yet the sons of Asclepius who were\nat the Trojan war do not blame the damsel who gives him the drink, or\nrebuke Patroclus, who is treating his case.\nWell, he said, that was surely an extraordinary drink to be given to a\nperson in his condition.\n[Sidenote: The nursing of disease began with Herodicus.]\nNot so extraordinary, I replied, if you bear in mind that in former days,\nas is commonly said, before the time of Herodicus, the guild of Asclepius\ndid not practise our present system of medicine, which may be said to\neducate diseases. But Herodicus, being a trainer, and himself of a sickly\nconstitution, by a combination of training and doctoring found *406B* out\na way of torturing first and chiefly himself, and secondly the rest of the\nworld.\nHow was that? he said.\nBy the invention of lingering death; for he had a mortal disease which he\nperpetually tended, and as recovery was out of the question, he passed his\nentire life as a valetudinarian; he could do nothing but attend upon\nhimself, and he was in constant torment whenever he departed in anything\nfrom his usual regimen, and so dying hard, by the help of science he\nstruggled on to old age.\nA rare reward of his skill!\n*406C* Yes, I said; a reward which a man might fairly expect who never\nunderstood that, if Asclepius did not instruct his descendants in\nvaletudinarian arts, the omission arose, not {94} from ignorance or\ninexperience of such a branch of medicine, but because he knew that in all\nwell-ordered states every individual has an occupation to which he must\nattend, and has therefore no leisure to spend in continually being ill.\nThis we remark in the case of the artisan, but, ludicrously enough, do not\napply the same rule to people of the richer sort.\nHow do you mean? he said.\n[Sidenote: The working-man has no time for tedious remedies.]\n*406D* I mean this: When a carpenter is ill he asks the physician for a\nrough and ready cure; an emetic or a purge or a cautery or the knife,\n--these are his remedies. And if some one prescribes for him a course of\ndietetics, and tells him that he must swathe and swaddle his head, and all\nthat sort of thing, he replies at once that he has no time to be ill, and\nthat he sees no good in a life which is spent in nursing his disease to\nthe neglect of his customary employment; and therefore *406E* bidding\ngood-bye to this sort of physician, he resumes his ordinary habits, and\neither gets well and lives and does his business, or, if his constitution\nfails, he dies and has no more trouble.\nYes, he said, and a man in his condition of life ought to use the art of\nmedicine thus far only.\n*407A* Has he not, I said, an occupation; and what profit would there be\nin his life if he were deprived of his occupation?\nQuite true, he said.\nBut with the rich man this is otherwise; of him we do not say that he has\nany specially appointed work which he must perform, if he would live.\nHe is generally supposed to have nothing to do.\nThen you never heard of the saying of Phocylides, that as soon as a man\nhas a livelihood he should practise virtue?\nNay, he said, I think that he had better begin somewhat sooner.\n[Sidenote: The slow cure equally an impediment to the mechanical arts, to\nthe practice of virtue]\nLet us not have a dispute with him about this, I said; but rather ask\nourselves: Is the practice of virtue obligatory on *407B* the rich man, or\ncan he live without it? And if obligatory on him, then let us raise a\nfurther question, whether this dieting of disorders, which is an\nimpediment to the application of the mind in carpentering and the\nmechanical arts, does not equally stand in the way of the sentiment of\nPhocylides? {95}\nOf that, he replied, there can be no doubt; such excessive care of the\nbody, when carried beyond the rules of gymnastic, is most inimical to the\npractice of virtue.\n[Sidenote: and to any kind of study or thought.]\n[38]Yes, indeed, I replied, and equally incompatible with the management\nof a house, an army, or an office of state; and, what is most important of\nall, irreconcileable with any kind *407C* of study or thought or\nself-reflection--there is a constant suspicion that headache and giddiness\nare to be ascribed to philosophy, and hence all practising or making trial\nof virtue in the higher sense is absolutely stopped; for a man is always\nfancying that he is being made ill, and is in constant anxiety about the\nstate of his body.\n[Footnote 38: Making the answer of Socrates begin at [Greek: kai\\ ga\\r\npro\\s k.t.l.]]\nYes, likely enough.\n[Sidenote: Asclepius would not cure diseased constitutions because they\nwere of no use to the State.]\nAnd therefore our politic Asclepius may be supposed to have exhibited the\npower of his art only to persons who, being generally of healthy\nconstitution and habits of life, had *407D* a definite ailment; such as\nthese he cured by purges and operations, and bade them live as usual,\nherein consulting the interests of the State; but bodies which disease had\npenetrated through and through he would not have attempted to cure by\ngradual processes of evacuation and infusion: he did not want to lengthen\nout good-for-nothing lives, or to have weak fathers begetting weaker\nsons;--if a man was not able to live in the ordinary way he had no\nbusiness to cure him; *407E* for such a cure would have been of no use\neither to himself, or to the State.\nThen, he said, you regard Asclepius as a statesman.\n[Sidenote: The case of Menelaus, who was attended by the sons of\nAsclepius.]\nClearly; and his character is further illustrated by his sons. *408A* Note\nthat they were heroes in the days of old and practised the medicines of\nwhich I am speaking at the siege of Troy: You will remember how, when\nPandarus wounded Menelaus, they\n'Sucked the blood out of the wound, and sprinkled soothing\nremedies[39],'\nbut they never prescribed what the patient was afterwards to eat or drink\nin the case of Menelaus, any more than in the case of Eurypylus; the\nremedies, as they conceived, were enough to heal any man who before he was\nwounded was {96} *408B* healthy and regular in his habits; and even though\nhe did happen to drink a posset of Pramnian wine, he might get well all\nthe same. But they would have nothing to do with unhealthy and intemperate\nsubjects, whose lives were of no use either to themselves or others; the\nart of medicine was not designed for their good, and though they were as\nrich as Midas, the sons of Asclepius would have declined to attend them.\n[Footnote 39: Iliad iv. 218.]\nThey were very acute persons, those sons of Asclepius.\n[Sidenote: The offence of Asclepius.]\nNaturally so, I replied. Nevertheless, the tragedians and Pindar\ndisobeying our behests, although they acknowledge that Asclepius was the\nson of Apollo, say also that he was bribed into healing a rich man who was\nat the point of *408C* death, and for this reason he was struck by\nlightning. But we, in accordance with the principle already affirmed by\nus, will not believe them when they tell us both;--if he was the son of a\ngod, we maintain that he was not avaricious; or, if he was avaricious, he\nwas not the son of a god.\nAll that, Socrates, is excellent; but I should like to put a question to\nyou: Ought there not to be good physicians in a State, and are not the\nbest those who have treated the *408D* greatest number of constitutions\ngood and bad? and are not the best judges in like manner those who are\nacquainted with all sorts of moral natures?\nYes, I said, I too would have good judges and good physicians. But do you\nknow whom I think good?\nWill you tell me?\nI will, if I can. Let me however note that in the same question you join\ntwo things which are not the same.\nHow so? he asked.\n[Sidenote: The physician should have experience of illness in his own\nperson;]\nWhy, I said, you join physicians and judges. Now the most skilful\nphysicians are those who, from their youth upwards, have combined with the\nknowledge of their art *408E* the greatest experience of disease; they had\nbetter not be robust in health, and should have had all manner of diseases\nin their own persons. For the body, as I conceive, is not the instrument\nwith which they cure the body; in that case we could not allow them ever\nto be or to have been sickly; but they cure the body with the mind, and\nthe mind which has become and is sick can cure nothing. {97}\nThat is very true, he said.\n[Sidenote: on the other hand, the judge should not learn to know evil by\nthe practice of it, but by long observation of evil in others.]\n*409A* But with the judge it is otherwise; since he governs mind by mind;\nhe ought not therefore to have been trained among vicious minds, and to\nhave associated with them from youth upwards, and to have gone through the\nwhole calendar of crime, only in order that he may quickly infer the\ncrimes of others as he might their bodily diseases from his own\nself-consciousness; the honourable mind which is to form a healthy\njudgment should have had no experience or contamination of evil habits\nwhen young. And this is the reason why in youth good men often appear to\nbe simple, and are *409B* easily practised upon by the dishonest, because\nthey have no examples of what evil is in their own souls.\nYes, he said, they are far too apt to be deceived.\nTherefore, I said, the judge should not be young; he should have learned\nto know evil, not from his own soul, but from late and long observation of\nthe nature of evil in others: *409C* knowledge should be his guide, not\npersonal experience.\nYes, he said, that is the ideal of a judge.\n[Sidenote: Such a knowledge of human nature far better and truer than that\nof the adept in crime.]\nYes, I replied, and he will be a good man (which is my answer to your\nquestion); for he is good who has a good soul. But the cunning and\nsuspicious nature of which we spoke,--he who has committed many crimes,\nand fancies himself to be a master in wickedness, when he is amongst his\nfellows, is wonderful in the precautions which he takes, because he judges\nof them by himself: but when he gets into the company of men of virtue,\nwho have the experience of age, he appears to be a fool again, owing to\nhis unseasonable suspicions; *409D* he cannot recognise an honest man,\nbecause he has no pattern of honesty in himself; at the same time, as the\nbad are more numerous than the good, and he meets with them oftener, he\nthinks himself, and is by others thought to be, rather wise than foolish.\nMost true, he said.\nThen the good and wise judge whom we are seeking is not this man, but the\nother; for vice cannot know virtue too, but a virtuous nature, educated by\ntime, will acquire a knowledge *409E* both of virtue and vice: the\nvirtuous, and not the vicious, man has wisdom--in my opinion.\nAnd in mine also. {98}\nThis is the sort of medicine, and this is the sort of law, which you will\nsanction in your state. They will minister to *410A* better natures,\ngiving health both of soul and of body; but those who are diseased in\ntheir bodies they will leave to die, and the corrupt and incurable souls\nthey will put an end to themselves.\nThat is clearly the best thing both for the patients and for the State.\nAnd thus our youth, having been educated only in that simple music which,\nas we said, inspires temperance, will be reluctant to go to law.\nClearly.\n*410B* And the musician, who, keeping to the same track, is content to\npractise the simple gymnastic, will have nothing to do with medicine\nunless in some extreme case.\nThat I quite believe.\nThe very exercises and tolls which he undergoes are intended to stimulate\nthe spirited element of his nature, and not to increase his strength; he\nwill not, like common athletes, use exercise and regimen to develope his\nmuscles.\nVery right, he said.\n[Sidenote: Music and gymnastic are equally designed for the improvement of\nthe mind.]\n*410C* Neither are the two arts of music and gymnastic really designed, as\nis often supposed, the one for the training of the soul, the other for the\ntraining of the body.\nWhat then is the real object of them?\nI believe, I said, that the teachers of both have in view chiefly the\nimprovement of the soul.\nHow can that be? he asked.\nDid you never observe, I said, the effect on the mind itself of exclusive\ndevotion to gymnastic, or the opposite effect of an exclusive devotion to\nmusic?\nIn what way shown? he said.\n[Sidenote: The mere athlete must be softened, and the philosophic nature\nprevented from becoming too soft]\n*410D* The one producing a temper of hardness and ferocity, the other of\nsoftness and effeminacy, I replied.\nYes, he said, I am quite aware that the mere athlete becomes too much of a\nsavage, and that the mere musician is melted and softened beyond what is\ngood for him.\nYet surely, I said, this ferocity only comes from spirit, which, if\nrightly educated, would give courage, but, if too much intensified, is\nliable to become hard and brutal. {99}\nThat I quite think.\n*410E* On the other hand the philosopher will have the quality of\ngentleness. And this also, when too much indulged, will turn to softness,\nbut, if educated rightly, will be gentle and moderate.\nTrue.\nAnd in our opinion the guardians ought to have both these qualities?\nAssuredly.\nAnd both should be in harmony?\nBeyond question.\n*411A* And the harmonious soul is both temperate and courageous?\nYes.\nAnd the inharmonious is cowardly and boorish?\nVery true.\n[Sidenote: Music, if carried too far, renders the weaker nature\neffeminate, the stronger irritable.]\nAnd, when a man allows music to play upon him and to pour into his soul\nthrough the funnel of his ears those sweet and soft and melancholy airs of\nwhich we were just now speaking, and his whole life is passed in warbling\nand the delights of song; in the first stage of the process the passion or\nspirit which is in him is tempered like iron, and made *411B* useful,\ninstead of brittle and useless. But, if he carries on the softening and\nsoothing process, in the next stage he begins to melt and waste, until he\nhas wasted away his spirit and cut out the sinews of his soul; and he\nbecomes a feeble warrior.\nVery true.\nIf the element of spirit is naturally weak in him the change is speedily\naccomplished, but if he have a good deal, then the power of music\nweakening the spirit renders him excitable;--on the least provocation he\nflames up at once, and is *411C* speedily extinguished; instead of having\nspirit he grows irritable and passionate and is quite impracticable.\nExactly.\n[Sidenote: And in like manner the well-fed athlete, if he have no\neducation,]\nAnd so in gymnastics, if a man takes violent exercise and is a great\nfeeder, and the reverse of a great student of music and philosophy, at\nfirst the high condition of his body fills him with pride and spirit, and\nhe becomes twice the man that he was. {100}\nCertainly.\n[Sidenote: degenerates into a wild beast.]\nAnd what happens? if he do nothing else, and holds no *411D* converse with\nthe Muses, does not even that intelligence which there may be in him,\nhaving no taste of any sort of learning or enquiry or thought or culture,\ngrow feeble and dull and blind, his mind never waking up or receiving\nnourishment, and his senses not being purged of their mists?\nTrue, he said.\nAnd he ends by becoming a hater of philosophy, uncivilized, never using\nthe weapon of persuasion,--he is like a wild *411E* beast, all violence\nand fierceness, and knows no other way of dealing; and he lives in all\nignorance and evil conditions, and has no sense of propriety and grace.\nThat is quite true, he said.\nAnd as there are two principles of human nature, one the spirited and the\nother the philosophical, some God, as I should say, has given mankind two\narts answering to them (and only indirectly to the soul and body), in\norder that these *412A* two principles (like the strings of an instrument)\nmay be relaxed or drawn tighter until they are duly harmonized.\nThat appears to be the intention.\n[Sidenote: Music to be mingled with gymnastic, and both attempered to the\nindividual soul.]\nAnd he who mingles music with gymnastic in the fairest proportions, and\nbest attempers them to the soul, may be rightly called the true musician\nand harmonist in a far higher sense than the tuner of the strings.\nYou are quite right, Socrates.\nAnd such a presiding genius will be always required in our State if the\ngovernment is to last.\n*412B* Yes, he will be absolutely necessary.\n[Sidenote: Enough of principles of education: who are to be our rulers?]\nSuch, then, are our principles of nurture and education: Where would be\nthe use of going into further details about the dances of our citizens, or\nabout their hunting and coursing, their gymnastic and equestrian contests?\nFor these all follow the general principle, and having found that, we\nshall have no difficulty in discovering them.\nI dare say that there will be no difficulty.\nVery good, I said; then what is the next question? Must we not ask who are\nto be rulers and who subjects?\n*412C* Certainly.\n[Sidenote: The elder must rule and the younger serve.]\nThere can be no doubt that the elder must rule the younger. {101}\nClearly.\nAnd that the best of these must rule.\nThat is also clear.\nNow, are not the best husbandmen those who are most devoted to husbandry?\nYes.\nAnd as we are to have the best of guardians for our city, must they not be\nthose who have most the character of guardians?\nYes.\nAnd to this end they ought to be wise and efficient, and to have a special\ncare of the State?\n*412D* True.\n[Sidenote: Those are to be appointed rulers who have been tested in all\nthe stages of their life;]\nAnd a man will be most likely to care about that which he loves?\nTo be sure.\nAnd he will be most likely to love that which he regards as having the\nsame interests with himself, and that of which the good or evil fortune is\nsupposed by him at any time most to affect his own?\nVery true, he replied.\nThen there must be a selection. Let us note among the guardians those who\nin their whole life show the greatest *412E* eagerness to do what is for\nthe good of their country, and the greatest repugnance to do what is\nagainst her interests.\nThose are the right men.\nAnd they will have to be watched at every age, in order that we may see\nwhether they preserve their resolution, and never, under the influence\neither of force or enchantment, forget or cast off their sense of duty to\nthe State.\nHow cast off? he said.\nI will explain to you, I replied. A resolution may go out of a man's mind\neither with his will or against his will; with *413A* his will when he\ngets rid of a falsehood and learns better, against his will whenever he is\ndeprived of a truth.\nI understand, he said, the willing loss of a resolution; the meaning of\nthe unwilling I have yet to learn.\nWhy, I said, do you not see that men are unwillingly deprived of good, and\nwillingly of evil? Is not to have lost the truth an evil, and to possess\nthe truth a good? and you {102} would agree that to conceive things as\nthey are is to possess the truth?\nYes, he replied; I agree with you in thinking that mankind are deprived of\ntruth against their will.\n*413B* And is not this involuntary deprivation caused either by theft, or\nforce, or enchantment?\nStill, he replied, I do not understand you.\n[Sidenote: and who are unchanged by the influence either of pleasure, or\nof fear,]\nI fear that I must have been talking darkly, like the tragedians. I only\nmean that some men are changed by persuasion and that others forget;\nargument steals away the hearts of one class, and time of the other; and\nthis I call theft. Now you understand me?\nYes.\nThose again who are forced, are those whom the violence of some pain or\ngrief compels to change their opinion.\nI understand, he said, and you are quite right.\n[Sidenote: or of enchantments.]\n*413C* And you would also acknowledge that the enchanted are those who\nchange their minds either under the softer influence of pleasure, or the\nsterner influence of fear?\nYes, he said; everything that deceives may be said to enchant.\nTherefore, as I was just now saying, we must enquire who are the best\nguardians of their own conviction that what they think the interest of the\nState is to be the rule of their lives. We must watch them from their\nyouth upwards, and make them perform actions in which they are most likely\nto forget or to be deceived, and he who remembers and is not deceived\n*413D* is to be selected, and he who fails in the trial is to be rejected.\nThat will be the way?\nYes.\nAnd there should also be toils and pains and conflicts prescribed for\nthem, in which they will be made to give further proof of the same\nqualities.\nVery right, he replied.\n[Sidenote: If they stand the test they are to be honoured in life and\nafter death.]\nAnd then, I said, we must try them with enchantments--that is the third\nsort of test--and see what will be their behaviour: like those who take\ncolts amid noise and tumult to see if they are of a timid nature, so must\nwe take our youth amid terrors of some kind, and again pass them into\npleasures, *413E* and prove them more thoroughly than gold is {103} proved\nin the furnace, that we may discover whether they are armed against all\nenchantments, and of a noble bearing always, good guardians of themselves\nand of the music which they have learned, and retaining under all\ncircumstances a rhythmical and harmonious nature, such as will be most\nserviceable to the individual and to the State. And he who at every age,\nas boy and youth and in mature life, has come out of the trial victorious\nand pure, shall be appointed *414A* a ruler and guardian of the State; he\nshall be honoured in life and death, and shall receive sepulture and other\nmemorials of honour, the greatest that we have to give. But him who fails,\nwe must reject. I am inclined to think that this is the sort of way in\nwhich our rulers and guardians should be chosen and appointed. I speak\ngenerally, and not with any pretension to exactness.\nAnd, speaking generally, I agree with you, he said.\n[Sidenote: The title of guardians to be reserved for the elders, the young\nmen to be called auxiliaries.]\n*414B* And perhaps the word 'guardian' in the fullest sense ought to be\napplied to this higher class only who preserve us against foreign enemies\nand maintain peace among our citizens at home, that the one may not have\nthe will, or the others the power, to harm us. The young men whom we\nbefore called guardians may be more properly designated auxiliaries and\nsupporters of the principles of the rulers.\nI agree with you, he said.\nHow then may we devise one of those needful falsehoods of which we lately\nspoke--just one royal lie which may *414C* deceive the rulers, if that be\npossible, and at any rate the rest of the city?\nWhat sort of lie? he said.\n[Sidenote: The Phoenician tale.]\nNothing new, I replied; only an old Phoenician[40] tale of what has often\noccurred before now in other places, (as the poets say, and have made the\nworld believe) though not in our time, and I do not know whether such an\nevent could ever happen again, or could now even be made probable, if it\ndid.\n[Footnote 40: Cp. Laws, 663 E.]\nHow your words seem to hesitate on your lips!\nYou will not wonder, I replied, at my hesitation when you have heard.\nSpeak, he said, and fear not. {104}\n[Sidenote: The citizens to be told that they are really autochthonous,\nsent up out of the earth,]\n*414D* Well then, I will speak, although I really know not how to look you\nin the face, or in what words to utter the audacious fiction, which\nI propose to communicate gradually, first to the rulers, then to the\nsoldiers, and lastly to the people. They are to be told that their youth\nwas a dream, and the education and training which they received from us,\nan appearance only; in reality during all that time they were being formed\nand fed in the womb of the earth, where they *414E* themselves and their\narms and appurtenances were manufactured; when they were completed, the\nearth, their mother, sent them up; and so, their country being their\nmother and also their nurse, they are bound to advise for her good, and to\ndefend her against attacks, and her citizens they are to regard as\nchildren of the earth and their own brothers.\nYou had good reason, he said, to be ashamed of the lie which you were\ngoing to tell.\n[Sidenote: and composed of metals of various quality.]\n[Sidenote: The noble quality to rise in the State, the ignoble to\ndescend.]\n*415A* True, I replied, but there is more coming; I have only told you\nhalf. Citizens, we shall say to them in our tale, you are brothers, yet\nGod has framed you differently. Some of you have the power of command, and\nin the composition of these he has mingled gold, wherefore also they have\nthe greatest honour; others he has made of silver, to be auxiliaries;\nothers again who are to be husbandmen and craftsmen he has composed of\nbrass and iron; and the species will generally be preserved in the\nchildren. But as all are of the same original stock, a golden parent will\nsometimes have a *415B* silver son, or a silver parent a golden son. And\nGod proclaims as a first principle to the rulers, and above all else, that\nthere is nothing which they should so anxiously guard, or of which they\nare to be such good guardians, as of the purity of the race. They should\nobserve what elements mingle in their offspring; for if the son of a\ngolden or silver parent has an admixture of brass and iron, then nature\norders *415C* a transposition of ranks, and the eye of the ruler must not\nbe pitiful towards the child because he has to descend in the scale and\nbecome a husbandman or artisan, just as there may be sons of artisans who\nhaving an admixture of gold or silver in them are raised to honour, and\nbecome guardians or auxiliaries. For an oracle says that when a man of\nbrass or iron guards the State, it will be destroyed. Such is the {105}\ntale; is there any possibility of making our citizens believe in it?\n[Sidenote: Is such a fiction credible?--Yes, in a future generation; not\nin the present.]\n*415D* Not in the present generation, he replied; there is no way of\naccomplishing this; but their sons may be made to believe in the tale, and\ntheir sons' sons, and posterity after them.\n[Sidenote: The selection of a site for the warriors' camp.]\nI see the difficulty, I replied; yet the fostering of such a belief will\nmake them care more for the city and for one another. Enough, however, of\nthe fiction, which may now fly abroad upon the wings of rumour, while we\narm our earth-born heroes, and lead them forth under the command of their\nrulers. Let them look round and select a spot whence they can best\nsuppress insurrection, if any prove refractory *415E* within, and also\ndefend themselves against enemies, who like wolves may come down on the\nfold from without; there let them encamp, and when they have encamped, let\nthem sacrifice to the proper Gods and prepare their dwellings.\nJust so, he said.\nAnd their dwellings must be such as will shield them against the cold of\nwinter and the heat of summer.\nI suppose that you mean houses, he replied.\nYes, I said; but they must be the houses of soldiers, and not of\nshop-keepers.\nWhat is the difference? he said.\n[Sidenote: The warriors must be humanized by education.]\n*416A* That I will endeavour to explain, I replied. To keep watch-dogs,\nwho, from want of discipline or hunger, or some evil habit or other, would\nturn upon the sheep and worry them, and behave not like dogs but wolves,\nwould be a foul and monstrous thing in a shepherd?\nTruly monstrous, he said.\n*416B* And therefore every care must be taken that our auxiliaries, being\nstronger than our citizens, may not grow to be too much for them and\nbecome savage tyrants instead of friends and allies?\nYes, great care should be taken.\nAnd would not a really good education furnish the best safeguard?\nBut they are well-educated already, he replied.\nI cannot be so confident, my dear Glaucon, I said; I am much more certain\nthat they ought to be, and that true *416C* education, whatever that may\nbe, will have the greatest {106} tendency to civilize and humanize them in\ntheir relations to one another, and to those who are under their\nprotection.\nVery true, he replied.\nAnd not only their education, but their habitations, and all that belongs\nto them, should be such as will neither impair their virtue as guardians,\nnor tempt them to prey upon the other citizens. *416D* Any man of sense\nmust acknowledge that.\nHe must.\n[Sidenote: Their way of life will be that of a camp]\n[Sidenote: They must have no homes or property of their own.]\nThen now let us consider what will be their way of life, if they are to\nrealize our idea of them. In the first place, none of them should have any\nproperty of his own beyond what is absolutely necessary; neither should\nthey have a private house or store closed against any one who has a mind\nto enter; their provisions should be only such as are required by trained\nwarriors, who are men of temperance and courage; *416E* they should agree\nto receive from the citizens a fixed rate of pay, enough to meet the\nexpenses of the year and no more; and they will go to mess and live\ntogether like soldiers in a camp. Gold and silver we will tell them that\nthey have from God; the diviner metal is within them, and they have\ntherefore no need of the dross which is current among men, and ought not\nto pollute the divine by any *417A* such earthly admixture; for that\ncommoner metal has been the source of many unholy deeds, but their own is\nundefiled. And they alone of all the citizens may not touch or handle\nsilver or gold, or be under the same roof with them, or wear them, or\ndrink from them. And this will be their salvation, and they will be the\nsaviours of the State. But should they ever acquire homes or lands or\nmoneys of their own, they will become housekeepers and husbandmen instead\nof guardians, *417B* enemies and tyrants instead of allies of the other\ncitizens; hating and being hated, plotting and being plotted against, they\nwill pass their whole life in much greater terror of internal than of\nexternal enemies, and the hour of ruin, both to themselves and to the rest\nof the State, will be at hand. For all which reasons may we not say that\nthus shall our State be ordered, and that these shall be the regulations\nappointed by us for guardians concerning their houses and all other\nmatters?\nYes, said Glaucon.\nBOOK IV.\n[Sidenote: _Republic IV._ Adeimantus, Socrates.]\n[Sidenote: An objection that Socrates has made his citizens poor and\nmiserable:]\n*419A* Here Adeimantus interposed a question: How would you answer,\nSocrates, said he, if a person were to say that you are making[1] these\npeople miserable, and that they are the cause of their own unhappiness;\nthe city in fact belongs to them, but they are none the better for it;\nwhereas other men acquire lands, and build large and handsome houses, and\nhave everything handsome about them, offering sacrifices to the gods on\ntheir own account, and practising hospitality; moreover, as you were\nsaying just now, they have gold and silver, and all that is usual among\nthe favourites of fortune; but our poor citizens are no better than\nmercenaries who are quartered in the city and are always mounting guard?\n[Footnote 1: Or, 'that for their own good you are making these people\nmiserable.']\n[Sidenote: and worst of all, adds Socrates, they have no money.]\n*420A* Yes, I said; and you may add that they are only fed, and not paid\nin addition to their food, like other men; and therefore they cannot, if\nthey would, take a journey of pleasure; they have no money to spend on a\nmistress or any other luxurious fancy, which, as the world goes, is\nthought to be happiness; and many other accusations of the same nature\nmight be added.\nBut, said he, let us suppose all this to be included in the charge.\n*420B* You mean to ask, I said, what will be our answer?\nYes.\n[Sidenote: Yet very likely they may be the happiest of mankind.]\n[Sidenote: The State, like a statue, must be judged of as a whole.]\n[Sidenote: The guardians must be guardians, not boon companions.]\nIf we proceed along the old path, my belief, I said, is that we shall find\nthe answer. And our answer will be that, even as they are, our guardians\nmay very likely be the happiest of men; but that our aim in founding the\nState was not the disproportionate happiness of any one class, but the\ngreatest happiness of the whole; we thought that in a State {108} which is\nordered with a view to the good of the whole we should be most likely to\nfind justice, and in the ill-ordered *420C* State injustice: and, having\nfound them, we might then decide which of the two is the happier. At\npresent, I take it, we are fashioning the happy State, not piecemeal, or\nwith a view of making a few happy citizens, but as a whole; and by-and-by\nwe will proceed to view the opposite kind of State. Suppose that we were\npainting a statue, and some one came up to us and said, Why do you not put\nthe most beautiful colours on the most beautiful parts of the body--the\neyes ought to be purple, but you have made them black--to him *420D* we\nmight fairly answer, Sir, you would not surely have us beautify the eyes\nto such a degree that they are no longer eyes; consider rather whether, by\ngiving this and the other features their due proportion, we make the whole\nbeautiful. And so I say to you, do not compel us to assign to the\nguardians a sort of happiness which will make them anything but guardians;\n*420E* for we too can clothe our husbandmen in royal apparel, and set\ncrowns of gold on their heads, and bid them till the ground as much as\nthey like, and no more. Our potters also might be allowed to repose on\ncouches, and feast by the fireside, passing round the winecup, while their\nwheel is conveniently at hand, and working at pottery only as much as they\nlike; in this way we might make every class happy--and then, as you\nimagine, the whole State would be happy. But do not put this idea into our\nheads; for, *421A* if we listen to you, the husbandman will be no longer a\nhusbandman, the potter will cease to be a potter, and no one will have the\ncharacter of any distinct class in the State. Now this is not of much\nconsequence where the corruption of society, and pretension to be what you\nare not, is confined to cobblers; but when the guardians of the laws and\nof the government are only seeming and not real guardians, then see how\nthey turn the State upside down; and on the other hand they alone have the\npower of giving order and happiness to the State. We mean our guardians to\nbe true *421B* saviours and not the destroyers of the State, whereas our\nopponent is thinking of peasants at a festival, who are enjoying a life of\nrevelry, not of citizens who are doing their duty to the State. But, if\nso, we mean different things, and he is {109} speaking of something which\nis not a State. And therefore we must consider whether in appointing our\nguardians we would look to their greatest happiness individually, or\nwhether this principle of happiness does not rather reside in the State as\na whole. But if the latter be the truth, then the guardians *421C* and\nauxiliaries, and all others equally with them, must be compelled or\ninduced to do their own work in the best way. And thus the whole State\nwill grow up in a noble order, and the several classes will receive the\nproportion of happiness which nature assigns to them.\nI think that you are quite right.\nI wonder whether you will agree with another remark which occurs to me.\nWhat may that be?\n*421D* There seem to be two causes of the deterioration of the arts.\nWhat are they?\nWealth, I said, and poverty.\nHow do they act?\n[Sidenote: When an artisan grows rich, he becomes careless: if he is very\npoor, he has no money to buy tools with. The city should be neither poor\nnor rich.]\nThe process is as follows: When a potter becomes rich, will he, think you,\nany longer take the same pains with his art?\nCertainly not.\nHe will grow more and more indolent and careless?\nVery true.\nAnd the result will be that he becomes a worse potter?\nYes; he greatly deteriorates.\nBut, on the other hand, if he has no money, and cannot provide himself\nwith tools or instruments, he will not work *421E* equally well himself,\nnor will he teach his sons or apprentices to work equally well.\nCertainly not.\nThen, under the influence either of poverty or of wealth, workmen and\ntheir work are equally liable to degenerate?\nThat is evident.\nHere, then, is a discovery of new evils, I said, against which the\nguardians will have to watch, or they will creep into the city unobserved.\nWhat evils?\n*422A* Wealth, I said, and poverty; the one is the parent of {110} luxury\nand indolence, and the other of meanness and viciousness, and both of\ndiscontent.\n[Sidenote: But how, being poor, can she contend against a wealthy enemy?]\nThat is very true, he replied; but still I should like to know, Socrates,\nhow our city will be able to go to war, especially against an enemy who is\nrich and powerful, if deprived of the sinews of war.\nThere would certainly be a difficulty, I replied, in going *422B* to war\nwith one such enemy; but there is no difficulty where there are two of\nthem.\nHow so? he asked.\n[Sidenote: Our wiry soldiers will be more than a match for their fat\nneighbours.]\nIn the first place, I said, if we have to fight, our side will be trained\nwarriors fighting against an army of rich men.\nThat is true, he said.\nAnd do you not suppose, Adeimantus, that a single boxer who was perfect in\nhis art would easily be a match for two stout and well-to-do gentlemen who\nwere not boxers?\nHardly, if they came upon him at once.\nWhat, now, I said, if he were able to run away and then *422C* turn and\nstrike at the one who first came up? And supposing he were to do this\nseveral times under the heat of a scorching sun, might he not, being an\nexpert, overturn more than one stout personage?\nCertainly, he said, there would be nothing wonderful in that.\nAnd yet rich men probably have a greater superiority in the science and\npractise of boxing than they have in military qualities.\nLikely enough.\nThen we may assume that our athletes will be able to fight with two or\nthree times their own number?\nI agree with you, for I think you right.\n[Sidenote: And they will have allies who will readily join on condition of\nreceiving the spoil.]\n*422D* And suppose that, before engaging, our citizens send an embassy to\none of the two cities, telling them what is the truth: Silver and gold we\nneither have nor are permitted to have, but you may; do you therefore come\nand help us in war, and take the spoils of the other city: Who, on hearing\nthese words, would choose to fight against lean wiry dogs, rather than,\nwith the dogs on their side, against fat and tender sheep?\nThat is not likely; and yet there might be a danger to the {111} *422E*\npoor State if the wealth of many States were to be gathered into one.\nBut how simple of you to use the term State at all of any but our own!\nWhy so?\n[Sidenote: But many cities will conspire? No: they are divided in\nthemselves.]\n[Sidenote: Many states are contained in one]\nYou ought to speak of other States in the plural number; not one of them\nis a city, but many cities, as they say in the game. For indeed any city,\nhowever small, is in fact divided into two, one the city of the poor, the\nother of the rich; *423A* these are at war with one another; and in either\nthere are many smaller divisions, and you would be altogether beside the\nmark if you treated them all as a single State. But if you deal with them\nas many, and give the wealth or power or persons of the one to the others,\nyou will always have a great many friends and not many enemies. And your\nState, while the wise order which has now been prescribed continues to\nprevail in her, will be the greatest of States, I do not mean to say in\nreputation or appearance, but in deed and truth, though she number not\nmore than a thousand defenders. A single State which is her equal you will\nhardly find, either *423B* among Hellenes or barbarians, though many that\nappear to be as great and many times greater.\nThat is most true, he said.\n[Sidenote: The limit to the size of the State the possibility of unity.]\nAnd what, I said, will be the best limit for our rulers to fix when they\nare considering the size of the State and the amount of territory which\nthey are to include, and beyond which they will not go?\nWhat limit would you propose?\nI would allow the State to increase so far as is consistent with unity;\nthat, I think, is the proper limit.\n*423C* Very good, he said.\nHere then, I said, is another order which will have to be conveyed to our\nguardians: Let our city be accounted neither large nor small, but one and\nself-sufficing.\nAnd surely, said he, this is not a very severe order which we impose upon\nthem.\n[Sidenote: The duty of adjusting the citizens to the rank for which nature\nintended them.]\nAnd the other, said I, of which we were speaking before is lighter\nstill,--I mean the duty of degrading the offspring of the guardians when\ninferior, and of elevating into the rank *423D* of guardians the offspring\nof the lower classes, when naturally {112} superior. The intention was,\nthat, in the case of the citizens generally, each individual should be put\nto the use for which nature intended him, one to one work, and then every\nman would do his own business, and be one and not many; and so the whole\ncity would be one and not many.\nYes, he said; that is not so difficult.\nThe regulations which we are prescribing, my good Adeimantus, are not, as\nmight be supposed, a number of great principles, but trifles all, if care\nbe taken, as the saying is, *423E* of the one great thing,--a thing,\nhowever, which I would rather call, not great, but sufficient for our\npurpose.\nWhat may that be? he asked.\nEducation, I said, and nurture: If our citizens are well educated, and\ngrow into sensible men, they will easily see their way through all these,\nas well as other matters which I omit; such, for example, as marriage, the\npossession of *424A* women and the procreation of children, which will all\nfollow the general principle that friends have all things in common, as\nthe proverb says.\nThat will be the best way of settling them.\n[Sidenote: Good education has a cumulative force and affects the breed.]\nAlso, I said, the State, if once started well, moves with accumulating\nforce like a wheel. For good nurture and education implant good\nconstitutions, and these good constitutions taking root in a good\neducation improve more and more, *424B* and this improvement affects the\nbreed in man as in other animals.\nVery possibly, he said.\n[Sidenote: No innovations to be made either in music or gymnastic.]\n[Sidenote: Damon.]\nThen to sum up: This is the point to which, above all, the attention of\nour rulers should be directed,--that music and gymnastic be preserved in\ntheir original form, and no innovation made. They must do their utmost to\nmaintain them intact. And when any one says that mankind most regard\n'The newest song which the singers have[2],'\n*424C* they will be afraid that he may be praising, not new songs, but a\nnew kind of song; and this ought not to be praised, or conceived to be the\nmeaning of the poet; for any musical innovation is full of danger to the\nwhole State, and ought to be prohibited. So Damon tells me, and I can\nquite believe {113} him;--he says that when modes of music change, the\nfundamental laws of the State always change with them.\n[Footnote 2: Od. i. 352.]\nYes, said Adeimantus; and you may add my suffrage to Damon's and your own.\n*424D* Then, I said, our guardians must lay the foundations of their\nfortress in music?\nYes, he said; the lawlessness of which you speak too easily steals in.\nYes, I replied, in the form of amusement; and at first sight it appears\nharmless.\n[Sidenote: The spirit of lawlessness, beginning in music, gradually\npervades the whole of life.]\nWhy, yes, he said, and there is no harm; were it not that little by little\nthis spirit of licence, finding a home, imperceptibly penetrates into\nmanners and customs; whence, issuing with greater force, it invades\ncontracts between man and *424E* man, and from contracts goes on to laws\nand constitutions, in utter recklessness, ending at last, Socrates, by an\noverthrow of all rights, private as well as public.\nIs that true? I said.\nThat is my belief, he replied.\nThen, as I was saying, our youth should be trained from the first in a\nstricter system, for if amusements become *425A* lawless, and the youths\nthemselves become lawless, they can never grow up into well-conducted and\nvirtuous citizens.\nVery true, he said.\n[Sidenote: The habit of order the basis of education.]\nAnd when they have made a good beginning in play, and by the help of music\nhave gained the habit of good order, then this habit of order, in a manner\nhow unlike the lawless play of the others! will accompany them in all\ntheir actions and be a principle of growth to them, and if there be any\nfallen places in the State will raise them up again.\nVery true, he said.\n[Sidenote: If the citizens have the root of the matter in them, they will\nsupply the details for themselves.]\nThus educated, they will invent for themselves any lesser rules which\ntheir predecessors have altogether neglected.\nWhat do you mean?\n*425B* I mean such things as these:--when the young are to be silent\nbefore their elders; how they are to show respect to them by standing and\nmaking them sit; what honour is due to parents; what garments or shoes are\nto be worn; the mode of dressing the hair; deportment and manners in\ngeneral. You would agree with me? {114}\nYes.\nBut there is, I think, small wisdom in legislating about such\nmatters,--I doubt if it is ever done; nor are any precise written\nenactments about them likely to be lasting.\nImpossible.\nIt would seem, Adeimantus, that the direction in which *425C* education\nstarts a man, will determine his future life. Does not like always attract\nlike?\nTo be sure.\nUntil some one rare and grand result is reached which may be good, and may\nbe the reverse of good?\nThat is not to be denied.\nAnd for this reason, I said, I shall not attempt to legislate further\nabout them.\nNaturally enough, he replied.\n[Sidenote: The mere routine of administration may be omitted by us.]\nWell, and about the business of the agora, and the ordinary dealings\nbetween man and man, or again about agreements *425D* with artisans; about\ninsult and injury, or the commencement of actions, and the appointment of\njuries, what would you say? there may also arise questions about any\nimpositions and exactions of market and harbour dues which may be\nrequired, and in general about the regulations of markets, police,\nharbours, and the like. But, oh heavens! shall we condescend to legislate\non any of these particulars?\nI think, he said, that there is no need to impose laws about *425E* them\non good men; what regulations are necessary they will find out soon enough\nfor themselves.\nYes, I said, my friend, if God will only preserve to them the laws which\nwe have given them.\nAnd without divine help, said Adeimantus, they will go on for ever making\nand mending their laws and their lives in the hope of attaining\nperfection.\n[Sidenote: Illustration of reformers of the law taken from invalids who\nare always doctoring themselves, but will never listen to the truth.]\nYou would compare them, I said, to those invalids who, having no\nself-restraint, will not leave off their habits of intemperance?\nExactly.\n*426A* Yes, I said; and what a delightful life they lead! they are always\ndoctoring and increasing and complicating their disorders, and always\nfancying that they will be cured by any nostrum which anybody advises them\nto try. {115}\nSuch cases are very common, he said, with invalids of this sort.\nYes, I replied; and the charming thing is that they deem him their worst\nenemy who tells them the truth, which is simply that, unless they give up\neating and drinking and *426B* wenching and idling, neither drug nor\ncautery nor spell nor amulet nor any other remedy will avail.\nCharming! he replied. I see nothing charming in going into a passion with\na man who tells you what is right.\nThese gentlemen, I said, do not seem to be in your good graces.\nAssuredly not.\nNor would you praise the behaviour of States which act like the men whom\nI was just now describing. For are there not ill-ordered States in which\nthe citizens are forbidden *426C* under pain of death to alter the\nconstitution; and yet he who most sweetly courts those who live under this\nregime and indulges them and fawns upon them and is skilful in\nanticipating and gratifying their humours is held to be a great and good\nstatesman--do not these States resemble the persons whom I was describing?\nYes, he said; the States are as bad as the men; and I am very far from\npraising them.\n*426D* But do you not admire, I said, the coolness and dexterity of these\nready ministers of political corruption?\n[Sidenote: Demagogues trying their hands at legislation may be excused for\ntheir ignorance of the world.]\nYes, he said, I do; but not of all of them, for there are some whom the\napplause of the multitude has deluded into the belief that they are really\nstatesmen, and these are not much to be admired.\nWhat do you mean? I said; you should have more feeling for them. When a\nman cannot measure, and a great many *426E* others who cannot measure\ndeclare that he is four cubits high, can he help believing what they say?\nNay, he said, certainly not in that case.\nWell, then, do not be angry with them; for are they not as good as a play,\ntrying their hand at paltry reforms such as I was describing; they are\nalways fancying that by legislation they will make an end of frauds in\ncontracts, and the other rascalities which I was mentioning, not knowing\nthat they are in reality cutting off the heads of a hydra? {116}\n*427A* Yes, he said; that is just what they are doing.\nI conceive, I said, that the true legislator will not trouble himself with\nthis class of enactments whether concerning laws or the constitution\neither in an ill-ordered or in a well-ordered State; for in the former\nthey are quite useless, and in the latter there will be no difficulty in\ndevising them; and many of them will naturally flow out of our previous\nregulations.\n*427B* What, then, he said, is still remaining to us of the work of\nlegislation?\nNothing to us, I replied; but to Apollo, the God of Delphi, there remains\nthe ordering of the greatest and noblest and chiefest things of all.\nWhich are they? he said.\n[Sidenote: Religion to be left to the God of Delphi.]\nThe institution of temples and sacrifices, and the entire service of gods,\ndemigods, and heroes; also the ordering of the repositories of the dead,\nand the rites which have to be observed by him who would propitiate the\ninhabitants of the world below. These are matters of which we are ignorant\nourselves, and as founders of a city we should be *427C* unwise in\ntrusting them to any interpreter but our ancestral deity. He is the god\nwho sits in the centre, on the navel of the earth, and he is the\ninterpreter of religion to all mankind.\nYou are right, and we will do as you propose.\nBut where, amid all this, is justice? son of Ariston, tell me where.\n*427D* Now that our city has been made habitable, light a candle and\nsearch, and get your brother and Polemarchus and the rest of our friends\nto help, and let us see where in it we can discover justice and where\ninjustice, and in what they differ from one another, and which of them the\nman who would be happy should have for his portion, whether seen or unseen\nby gods and men.\n[Sidenote: Socrates, Glaucon.]\nNonsense, said Glaucon: did you not promise to search *427E* yourself,\nsaying that for you not to help justice in her need would be an impiety?\nI do not deny that I said so, and as you remind me, I will be as good as\nmy word; but you must join.\nWe will, he replied.\nWell, then, I hope to make the discovery in this way: {117} I mean to\nbegin with the assumption that our State, if rightly ordered, is perfect.\nThat is most certain.\nAnd being perfect, is therefore wise and valiant and temperate and just.\nThat is likewise clear.\nAnd whichever of these qualities we find in the State, the one which is\nnot found will be the residue?\n*428A* Very good.\nIf there were four things, and we were searching for one of them, wherever\nit might be, the one sought for might be known to us from the first, and\nthere would be no further trouble; or we might know the other three first,\nand then the fourth would clearly be the one left.\nVery true, he said.\nAnd is not a similar method to be pursued about the virtues, which are\nalso four in number?\nClearly.\n[Sidenote: The place of the virtues in the State: (1) The wisdom of the\nstatesman advises, not about particular arts or pursuits,]\nFirst among the virtues found in the State, wisdom comes *428B* into view,\nand in this I detect a certain peculiarity.\nWhat is that?\nThe State which we have been describing is said to be wise as being good\nin counsel?\nVery true.\nAnd good counsel is clearly a kind of knowledge, for not by ignorance, but\nby knowledge, do men counsel well?\nClearly.\nAnd the kinds of knowledge in a State are many and diverse?\nOf course.\nThere is the knowledge of the carpenter; but is that the sort of knowledge\nwhich gives a city the title of wise and good in counsel?\n*428C* Certainly not; that would only give a city the reputation of skill\nin carpentering.\nThen a city is not to be called wise because possessing a knowledge which\ncounsels for the best about wooden implements?\nCertainly not.\nNor by reason of a knowledge which advises about brazen {118} pots,\nI said, nor as possessing any other similar knowledge?\nNot by reason of any of them, he said.\nNor yet by reason of a knowledge which cultivates the earth; that would\ngive the city the name of agricultural?\nYes.\n[Sidenote: but about the whole State.]\nWell, I said, and is there any knowledge in our recently-founded State\namong any of the citizens which advises, *428D* not about any particular\nthing in the State, but about the whole, and considers how a State can\nbest deal with itself and with other States?\nThere certainly is.\nAnd what is this knowledge, and among whom is it found? I asked.\nIt is the knowledge of the guardians, he replied, and is found among those\nwhom we were just now describing as perfect guardians.\nAnd what is the name which the city derives from the possession of this\nsort of knowledge?\nThe name of good in counsel and truly wise.\n[Sidenote: The statesmen or guardians are the smallest of all classes in\nthe State.]\n*428E* And will there be in our city more of these true guardians or more\nsmiths?\nThe smiths, he replied, will be far more numerous.\nWill not the guardians be the smallest of all the classes who receive a\nname from the profession of some kind of knowledge?\nMuch the smallest.\nAnd so by reason of the smallest part or class, and of the knowledge which\nresides in this presiding and ruling part of itself, the whole State,\nbeing thus constituted according to *429A* nature, will be wise; and this,\nwhich has the only knowledge worthy to be called wisdom, has been ordained\nby nature to be of all classes the least.\nMost true.\nThus, then, I said, the nature and place in the State of one of the four\nvirtues has somehow or other been discovered.\nAnd, in my humble opinion, very satisfactorily discovered, he replied.\nAgain, I said, there is no difficulty in seeing the nature of {119}\ncourage, and in what part that quality resides which gives the name of\ncourageous to the State.\nHow do you mean?\n[Sidenote: (2) The courage which makes the city courageous is found\nchiefly in the soldier.]\n*429B* Why, I said, every one who calls any State courageous or cowardly,\nwill be thinking of the part which fights and goes out to war on the\nState's behalf.\nNo one, he replied, would ever think of any other.\nThe rest of the citizens may be courageous or may be cowardly, but their\ncourage or cowardice will not, as I conceive, have the effect of making\nthe city either the one or the other.\nCertainly not.\n[Sidenote: It is the quality which preserves right opinion about things to\nbe feared and not to be feared.]\nThe city will be courageous in virtue of a portion of herself which\npreserves under all circumstances that opinion *429C* about the nature of\nthings to be feared and not to be feared in which our legislator educated\nthem; and this is what you term courage.\nI should like to hear what you are saying once more, for I do not think\nthat I perfectly understand you.\nI mean that courage is a kind of salvation.\nSalvation of what?\nOf the opinion respecting things to be feared, what they are and of what\nnature, which the law implants through education; and I mean by the words\n'under all circumstances' *429D* to intimate that in pleasure or in pain,\nor under the influence of desire or fear, a man preserves, and does not\nlose this opinion. Shall I give you an illustration?\nIf you please.\n[Sidenote: Illustration from the art of dyeing.]\nYou know, I said, that dyers, when they want to dye wool for making the\ntrue sea-purple, begin by selecting their white colour first; this they\nprepare and dress with much care and pains, in order that the white ground\nmay take the purple hue in full perfection. The dyeing then proceeds; and\n*429E* whatever is dyed in this manner becomes a fast colour, and no\nwashing either with lyes or without them can take away the bloom. But,\nwhen the ground has not been duly prepared, you will have noticed how poor\nis the look either of purple or of any other colour.\nYes, he said; I know that they have a washed-out and ridiculous\nappearance. {120}\n[Sidenote: Our soldiers must take the dye of the laws.]\nThen now, I said, you will understand what our object was *430A* in\nselecting our soldiers, and educating them in music and gymnastic; we were\ncontriving influences which would prepare them to take the dye of the laws\nin perfection, and the colour of their opinion about dangers and of every\nother opinion was to be indelibly fixed by their nurture and training, not\nto be washed away by such potent lyes as pleasure--mightier agent far in\nwashing the soul than any soda or lye; *430B* or by sorrow, fear, and\ndesire, the mightiest of all other solvents. And this sort of universal\nsaving power of true opinion in conformity with law about real and false\ndangers I call and maintain to be courage, unless you disagree.\nBut I agree, he replied; for I suppose that you mean to exclude mere\nuninstructed courage, such as that of a wild beast or of a slave--this, in\nyour opinion, is not the courage which the law ordains, and ought to have\nanother name.\n*430C* Most certainly.\nThen I may infer courage to be such as you describe?\nWhy, yes, said I, you may, and if you add the words 'of a citizen,' you\nwill not be far wrong;--hereafter, if you like, we will carry the\nexamination further, but at present we are seeking not for courage but\njustice; and for the purpose of our enquiry we have said enough.\nYou are right, he replied.\n[Sidenote: Two other virtues, temperance and justice, which must be\nconsidered in their proper order.]\nTwo virtues remain to be discovered in the State--first, *430D*\ntemperance, and then justice which is the end of our search.\nVery true.\nNow, can we find justice without troubling ourselves about temperance?\nI do not know how that can be accomplished, he said, nor do I desire that\njustice should be brought to light and temperance lost sight of; and\ntherefore I wish that you would do me the favour of considering temperance\nfirst.\n*430E* Certainly, I replied, I should not be justified in refusing your\nrequest.\nThen consider, he said.\nYes, I replied; I will; and as far as I can at present see, the virtue of\ntemperance has more of the nature of harmony and symphony than the\npreceding.\nHow so? he asked. {121}\nTemperance, I replied, is the ordering or controlling of certain pleasures\nand desires; this is curiously enough implied in the saying of 'a man\nbeing his own master;' and other traces of the same notion may be found in\nlanguage.\nNo doubt, he said.\n[Sidenote: The temperate is master of himself, but the same person, when\nintemperate, is also the slave of himself.]\nThere is something ridiculous in the expression 'master of himself;'\n*431A* for the master is also the servant and the servant the master; and\nin all these modes of speaking the same person is denoted.\nCertainly.\nThe meaning is, I believe, that in the human soul there is a better and\nalso a worse principle; and when the better has the worse under control,\nthen a man is said to be master of himself; and this is a term of praise:\nbut when, owing to evil education or association, the better principle,\nwhich is also the smaller, is overwhelmed by the greater mass of the\n*431B* worse--in this case he is blamed and is called the slave of self\nand unprincipled.\nYes, there is reason in that.\nAnd now, I said, look at our newly-created State, and there you will find\none of these two conditions realized; for the State, as you will\nacknowledge, may be justly called master of itself, if the words\n'temperance' and 'self-mastery' truly express the rule of the better part\nover the worse.\nYes, he said, I see that what you say is true.\nLet me further note that the manifold and complex pleasures *431C* and\ndesires and pains are generally found in children and women and servants,\nand in the freemen so called who are of the lowest and more numerous\nclass.\nCertainly, he said.\nWhereas the simple and moderate desires which follow reason, and are under\nthe guidance of mind and true opinion, are to be found only in a few, and\nthose the best born and best educated.\nVery true.\n[Sidenote: The State which has the passions and desires of the many\ncontrolled by the few may be rightly called temperate.]\nThese two, as you may perceive, have a place in our State; *431D* and the\nmeaner desires of the many are held down by the virtuous desires and\nwisdom of the few.\nThat I perceive, he said.\nThen if there be any city which may be described as {122} master of its\nown pleasures and desires, and master of itself, ours may claim such a\ndesignation?\nCertainly, he replied.\nIt may also be called temperate, and for the same reasons?\nYes.\nAnd if there be any State in which rulers and subjects *431E* will be\nagreed as to the question who are to rule, that again will be our State?\nUndoubtedly.\nAnd the citizens being thus agreed among themselves, in which class will\ntemperance be found--in the rulers or in the subjects?\nIn both, as I should imagine, he replied.\nDo you observe that we were not far wrong in our guess that temperance was\na sort of harmony?\nWhy so?\n[Sidenote: Temperance resides in the whole State.]\nWhy, because temperance is unlike courage and wisdom, each of which\nresides in a part only, the one making the *432A* State wise and the other\nvaliant; not so temperance, which extends to the whole, and runs through\nall the notes of the scale, and produces a harmony of the weaker and the\nstronger and the middle class, whether you suppose them to be stronger or\nweaker in wisdom or power or numbers or wealth, or anything else. Most\ntruly then may we deem temperance to be the agreement of the naturally\nsuperior and inferior, as to the right to rule of either, both in states\nand individuals.\n*432B* I entirely agree with you.\nAnd so, I said, we may consider three out of the four virtues to have been\ndiscovered in our State. The last of those qualities which make a state\nvirtuous must be justice, if we only knew what that was.\nThe inference is obvious.\n[Sidenote: Justice is not far off.]\nThe time then has arrived, Glaucon, when, like huntsmen, we should\nsurround the cover, and look sharp that justice does not steal away, and\npass out of sight and escape us; for *432C* beyond a doubt she is\nsomewhere in this country: watch therefore and strive to catch a sight of\nher, and if you see her first, let me know.\nWould that I could! but you should regard me rather as {123} a follower\nwho has just eyes enough to see what you show him--that is about as much\nas I am good for.\nOffer up a prayer with me and follow.\nI will, but you must show me the way.\nHere is no path, I said, and the wood is dark and perplexing; still we\nmust push on.\n*432D* Let us push on.\nHere I saw something: Halloo! I said, I begin to perceive a track, and I\nbelieve that the quarry will not escape.\nGood news, he said.\nTruly, I said, we are stupid fellows.\nWhy so?\nWhy, my good sir, at the beginning of our enquiry, ages ago, there was\njustice tumbling out at our feet, and we never saw her; nothing could be\nmore ridiculous. Like people who go about looking for what they have in\ntheir hands--that *432E* was the way with us--we looked not at what we\nwere seeking, but at what was far off in the distance; and therefore,\nI suppose, we missed her.\nWhat do you mean?\nI mean to say that in reality for a long time past we have been talking of\njustice, and have failed to recognise her.\nI grow impatient at the length of your exordium.\n[Sidenote: We had already found her when we spoke of one man doing one\nthing only.]\n*433A* Well then, tell me, I said, whether I am right or not: You remember\nthe original principle which we were always laying down at the foundation\nof the State, that one man should practise one thing only, the thing to\nwhich his nature was best adapted;--now justice is this principle or a\npart of it.\nYes, we often said that one man should do one thing only.\nFurther, we affirmed that justice was doing one's own business, and not\nbeing a busybody; we said so again and again, *433B* and many others have\nsaid the same to us.\nYes, we said so.\nThen to do one's own business in a certain way may be assumed to be\njustice. Can you tell me whence I derive this inference?\nI cannot, but I should like to be told.\n[Sidenote: From another point of view Justice is the residue of the three\nothers.]\nBecause I think that this is the only virtue which remains in the State\nwhen the other virtues of temperance and courage and wisdom are\nabstracted; and, that this is the ultimate {124} cause and condition of\nthe existence of all of them, and while remaining in them is also their\npreservative; *433C* and we were saying that if the three were discovered\nby us, justice would be the fourth or remaining one.\nThat follows of necessity.\nIf we are asked to determine which of these four qualities by its presence\ncontributes most to the excellence of the State, whether the agreement of\nrulers and subjects, or the preservation in the soldiers of the opinion\nwhich the law ordains about the true nature of dangers, or wisdom and\n*433D* watchfulness in the rulers, or whether this other which I am\nmentioning, and which is found in children and women, slave and freeman,\nartisan, ruler, subject,--the quality, I mean, of every one doing his own\nwork, and not being a busybody, would claim the palm--the question is not\nso easily answered.\nCertainly, he replied, there would be a difficulty in saying which.\nThen the power of each individual in the State to do his own work appears\nto compete with the other political virtues, wisdom, temperance, courage.\nYes, he said.\nAnd the virtue which enters into this competition is *433E* justice?\nExactly.\n[Sidenote: Our idea is confirmed by the administration of justice in\nlawsuits. No man is to have what is not his own.]\nLet us look at the question from another point of view: Are not the rulers\nin a State those to whom you would entrust the office of determining suits\nat law?\nCertainly.\nAnd are suits decided on any other ground but that a man may neither take\nwhat is another's, nor be deprived of what is his own?\nYes; that is their principle.\nWhich is a just principle?\nYes.\nThen on this view also justice will be admitted to be the having and doing\nwhat is a man's own, and belongs to him?\n*434A* Very true.\n[Sidenote: Illustration: Classes, like individuals, should not meddle with\none another's occupations.]\nThink, now, and say whether you agree with me or not. Suppose a carpenter\nto be doing the business of a cobbler, {125} or a cobbler of a carpenter;\nand suppose them to exchange their implements or their duties, or the same\nperson to be doing the work of both, or whatever be the change; do you\nthink that any great harm would result to the State?\nNot much.\nBut when the cobbler or any other man whom nature *434B* designed to be a\ntrader, having his heart lifted up by wealth or strength or the number of\nhis followers, or any like advantage, attempts to force his way into the\nclass of warriors, or a warrior into that of legislators and guardians,\nfor which he is unfitted, and either to take the implements or the duties\nof the other; or when one man is trader, legislator, and warrior all in\none, then I think you will agree with me in saying that this interchange\nand this meddling of one with another is the ruin of the State.\nMost true.\nSeeing then, I said, that there are three distinct classes, any meddling\nof one with another, or the change of one into *434C* another, is the\ngreatest harm to the State, and may be most justly termed evil-doing?\nPrecisely.\nAnd the greatest degree of evil-doing to one's own city would be termed by\nyou injustice?\nCertainly.\nThis then is injustice; and on the other hand when the trader, the\nauxiliary, and the guardian each do their own business, that is justice,\nand will make the city just.\n*434D* I agree with you.\n[Sidenote: From the larger example of the State we will now return to the\nindividual.]\nWe will not, I said, be over-positive as yet; but if, on trial, this\nconception of justice be verified in the individual as well as in the\nState, there will be no longer any room for doubt; if it be not verified,\nwe must have a fresh enquiry. First let us complete the old investigation,\nwhich we began, as you remember, under the impression that, if we could\npreviously examine justice on the larger scale, there would be less\ndifficulty in discerning her in the individual. That larger *434E* example\nappeared to be the State, and accordingly we constructed as good a one as\nwe could, knowing well that in the good State justice would be found. Let\nthe discovery which we made be now applied to the individual--if they\nagree, {126} we shall be satisfied; or, if there be a difference in the\nindividual, we will come back to the State and have another *435A* trial\nof the theory. The friction of the two when rubbed together may possibly\nstrike a light in which justice will shine forth, and the vision which is\nthen revealed we will fix in our souls.\nThat will be in regular course; let us do as you say.\nI proceeded to ask: When two things, a greater and less, are called by the\nsame name, are they like or unlike in so far as they are called the same?\nLike, he replied.\n*435B* The just man then, if we regard the idea of justice only, will be\nlike the just State?\nHe will.\nAnd a State was thought by us to be just when the three classes in the\nState severally did their own business; and also thought to be temperate\nand valiant and wise by reason of certain other affections and qualities\nof these same classes?\nTrue, he said.\nAnd so of the individual; we may assume that he has the *435C* same three\nprinciples in his own soul which are found in the State; and he may be\nrightly described in the same terms, because he is affected in the same\nmanner?\nCertainly, he said.\n[Sidenote: How can we decide whether or no the soul has three distinct\nprinciples?]\nOnce more then, O my friend, we have alighted upon an easy\nquestion--whether the soul has these three principles or not?\nAn easy question! Nay, rather, Socrates, the proverb holds that hard is\nthe good.\n[Sidenote: Our method is inadequate, and for a better and longer one we\nhave not at present time.]\nVery true, I said; and I do not think that the method *435D* which we are\nemploying is at all adequate to the accurate solution of this question;\nthe true method is another and a longer one. Still we may arrive at a\nsolution not below the level of the previous enquiry.\nMay we not be satisfied with that? he said;--under the circumstances, I am\nquite content.\nI too, I replied, shall be extremely well satisfied.\nThen faint not in pursuing the speculation, he said.\n*435E* Must we not acknowledge, I said, that in each of us there {127} are\nthe same principles and habits which there are in the State; and that from\nthe individual they pass into the State?--how else can they come there?\nTake the quality of passion or spirit;--it would be ridiculous to imagine\nthat this quality, when found in States, is not derived from the\nindividuals who are supposed to possess it, e.g. the Thracians, Scythians,\nand in general the northern nations; and the same may be said of the love\nof knowledge, which is the special characteristic of our part of the\nworld, or of the *436A* love of money, which may, with equal truth, be\nattributed to the Phoenicians and Egyptians.\nExactly so, he said.\nThere is no difficulty in understanding this.\nNone whatever.\n[Sidenote: A digression in which an attempt is made to attain logical\nclearness.]\nBut the question is not quite so easy when we proceed to ask whether these\nprinciples are three or one; whether, that is to say, we learn with one\npart of our nature, are angry with another, and with a third part desire\nthe satisfaction *436B* of our natural appetites; or whether the whole\nsoul comes into play in each sort of action--to determine that is the\ndifficulty.\nYes, he said; there lies the difficulty.\nThen let us now try and determine whether they are the same or different.\nHow can we? he asked.\n[Sidenote: The criterion of truth: Nothing can be and not be at the same\ntime in the same relation.]\nI replied as follows: The same thing clearly cannot act or be acted upon\nin the same part or in relation to the same thing at the same time, in\ncontrary ways; and therefore whenever this contradiction occurs in things\napparently the same, we know that they are really not the same, but *436C*\ndifferent.\nGood.\nFor example, I said, can the same thing be at rest and in motion at the\nsame time in the same part?\nImpossible.\nStill, I said, let us have a more precise statement of terms, lest we\nshould hereafter fall out by the way. Imagine the case of a man who is\nstanding and also moving his hands and his head, and suppose a person to\nsay that one and the same person is in motion and at rest at the same\nmoment {128} --to such a mode of speech we should object, and should\n*436D* rather say that one part of him is in motion while another is at\nrest.\nVery true.\n[Sidenote: Anticipation of objections to this 'law of thought.']\nAnd suppose the objector to refine still further, and to draw the nice\ndistinction that not only parts of tops, but whole tops, when they spin\nround with their pegs fixed on the spot, are at rest and in motion at the\nsame time (and he may say the same of anything which revolves in the same\nspot), his objection would not be admitted by us, because *436E* in such\ncases things are not at rest and in motion in the same parts of\nthemselves; we should rather say that they have both an axis and a\ncircumference, and that the axis stands still, for there is no deviation\nfrom the perpendicular; and that the circumference goes round. But if,\nwhile revolving, the axis inclines either to the right or left, forwards\nor backwards, then in no point of view can they be at rest.\nThat is the correct mode of describing them, he replied.\nThen none of these objections will confuse us, or incline us to believe\nthat the same thing at the same time, in the *437A* same part or in\nrelation to the same thing, can act or be acted upon in contrary ways.\nCertainly not, according to my way of thinking.\nYet, I said, that we may not be compelled to examine all such objections,\nand prove at length that they are untrue, let us assume their absurdity,\nand go forward on the understanding that hereafter, if this assumption\nturn out to be untrue, all the consequences which follow shall be\nwithdrawn.\nYes, he said, that will be the best way.\n[Sidenote: Likes and dislikes exist in many forms.]\n*437B* Well, I said, would you not allow that assent and dissent, desire\nand aversion, attraction and repulsion, are all of them opposites, whether\nthey are regarded as active or passive (for that makes no difference in\nthe fact of their opposition)?\nYes, he said, they are opposites.\nWell, I said, and hunger and thirst, and the desires in general, and again\nwilling and wishing,--all these you would *437C* refer to the classes\nalready mentioned. You would say--would you not?--that the soul of him who\ndesires is seeking {129} after the object of his desire; or that he is\ndrawing to himself the thing which he wishes to possess: or again, when a\nperson wants anything to be given him, his mind, longing for the\nrealization of his desire, intimates his wish to have it by a nod of\nassent, as if he had been asked a question?\nVery true.\nAnd what would you say of unwillingness and dislike and the absence of\ndesire; should not these be referred to the opposite class of repulsion\nand rejection?\n*437D* Certainly.\nAdmitting this to be true of desire generally, let us suppose a particular\nclass of desires, and out of these we will select hunger and thirst, as\nthey are termed, which are the most obvious of them?\nLet us take that class, he said.\nThe object of one is food, and of the other drink?\nYes.\n[Sidenote: There may be simple thirst or qualified thirst, having\nrespectively a simple or a qualified object.]\nAnd here comes the point: is not thirst the desire which the soul has of\ndrink, and of drink only; not of drink qualified by anything else; for\nexample, warm or cold, or much or little, or, in a word, drink of any\nparticular sort: but if *437E* the thirst be accompanied by heat, then the\ndesire is of cold drink; or, if accompanied by cold, then of warm drink;\nor, if the thirst be excessive, then the drink which is desired will be\nexcessive; or, if not great, the quantity of drink will also be small: but\nthirst pure and simple will desire drink pure and simple, which is the\nnatural satisfaction of thirst, as food is of hunger?\nYes, he said; the simple desire is, as you say, in every case of the\nsimple object, and the qualified desire of the qualified object.\n[Sidenote: Exception: The term good expresses, not a particular, but an\nuniversal relation.]\n*438A* But here a confusion may arise; and I should wish to guard against\nan opponent starting up and saying that no man desires drink only, but\ngood drink, or food only, but good food; for good is the universal object\nof desire, and thirst being a desire, will necessarily be thirst after\ngood drink; and the same is true of every other desire.\nYes, he replied, the opponent might have something to say.\nNevertheless I should still maintain, that of relatives some {130} *438B*\nhave a quality attached to either term of the relation; others are simple\nand have their correlatives simple.\nI do not know what you mean.\n[Sidenote: Illustration of the argument from the use of language about\ncorrelative terms.]\nWell, you know of course that the greater is relative to the less?\nCertainly.\nAnd the much greater to the much less?\nYes.\nAnd the sometime greater to the sometime less, and the greater that is to\nbe to the less that is to be?\nCertainly, he said.\n*438C* And so of more and less, and of other correlative terms, such as\nthe double and the half, or again, the heavier and the lighter, the\nswifter and the slower; and of hot and cold, and of any other\nrelatives;--is not this true of all of them?\nYes.\nAnd does not the same principle hold in the sciences? The object of\nscience is knowledge (assuming that to be the true definition), but the\nobject of a particular science is a *438D* particular kind of knowledge;\nI mean, for example, that the science of house-building is a kind of\nknowledge which is defined and distinguished from other kinds and is\ntherefore termed architecture.\nCertainly.\nBecause it has a particular quality which no other has?\nYes.\nAnd it has this particular quality because it has an object of a\nparticular kind; and this is true of the other arts and sciences?\nYes.\n[Sidenote: Recapitulation]\n[Sidenote: Anticipation of a possible confusion.]\nNow, then, if I have made myself clear, you will understand my original\nmeaning in what I said about relatives. My meaning was, that if one term\nof a relation is taken alone, the other is taken alone; if one term is\nqualified, the other is also qualified. *438E* I do not mean to say that\nrelatives may not be disparate, or that the science of health is healthy,\nor of disease necessarily diseased, or that the sciences of good and evil\nare therefore good and evil; but only that, when the term science is no\nlonger used absolutely, but has a qualified object which in this case is\nthe nature of health and disease, {131} it becomes defined, and is hence\ncalled not merely science, but the science of medicine.\nI quite understand, and I think as you do.\n*439A* Would you not say that thirst is one of these essentially relative\nterms, having clearly a relation--\nYes, thirst is relative to drink.\nAnd a certain kind of thirst is relative to a certain kind of drink; but\nthirst taken alone is neither of much nor little, nor of good nor bad, nor\nof any particular kind of drink, but of drink only?\nCertainly.\nThen the soul of the thirsty one, in so far as he is thirsty, *439B*\ndesires only drink; for this he yearns and tries to obtain it?\nThat is plain.\n[Sidenote: The law of contradiction.]\nAnd if you suppose something which pulls a thirsty soul away from drink,\nthat must be different from the thirsty principle which draws him like a\nbeast to drink; for, as we were saying, the same thing cannot at the same\ntime with the same part of itself act in contrary ways about the same.\nImpossible.\nNo more than you can say that the hands of the archer push and pull the\nbow at the same time, but what you say is that one hand pushes and the\nother pulls.\n*439C* Exactly so, he replied.\nAnd might a man be thirsty, and yet unwilling to drink?\nYes, he said, it constantly happens.\nAnd in such a case what is one to say? Would you not say that there was\nsomething in the soul bidding a man to drink, and something else\nforbidding him, which is other and stronger than the principle which bids\nhim?\nI should say so.\n[Sidenote: The opposition of desire and reason.]\n*439D* And the forbidding principle is derived from reason, and that which\nbids and attracts proceeds from passion and disease?\nClearly.\nThen we may fairly assume that they are two, and that they differ from one\nanother; the one with which a man reasons, we may call the rational\nprinciple of the soul, the other, with which he loves and hungers and\nthirsts and feels the {132} flutterings of any other desire, may be termed\nthe irrational or appetitive, the ally of sundry pleasures and\nsatisfactions?\n*439E* Yes, he said, we may fairly assume them to be different.\nThen let us finally determine that there are two principles existing in\nthe soul. And what of passion, or spirit? Is it a third, or akin to one of\nthe preceding?\nI should be inclined to say--akin to desire.\n[Sidenote: The third principle of spirit or passion illustrated by an\nexample.]\nWell, I said, there is a story which I remember to have heard, and in\nwhich I put faith. The story is, that Leontius, the son of Aglaion, coming\nup one day from the Piraeus, under the north wall on the outside, observed\nsome dead bodies lying on the ground at the place of execution. He felt a\ndesire to see them, and also a dread and abhorrence of them; *440A* for a\ntime he struggled and covered his eyes, but at length the desire got the\nbetter of him; and forcing them open, he ran up to the dead bodies,\nsaying, Look, ye wretches, take your fill of the fair sight.\nI have heard the story myself, he said.\nThe moral of the tale is, that anger at times goes to war with desire, as\nthough they were two distinct things.\nYes; that is the meaning, he said.\n[Sidenote: Passion never takes part with desire against reason.]\nAnd are there not many other cases in which we observe *440B* that when a\nman's desires violently prevail over his reason, he reviles himself, and\nis angry at the violence within him, and that in this struggle, which is\nlike the struggle of factions in a State, his spirit is on the side of his\nreason;--but for the passionate or spirited element to take part with the\ndesires when reason decides that she should not be opposed[3], is a sort\nof thing which I believe that you never observed occurring in yourself,\nnor, as I should imagine, in any one else?\n[Footnote 3: Reading [Greek: m\u00ea\\ dei=n a)ntipra/tein], without a comma\nafter [Greek: dei=n].]\nCertainly not.\n[Sidenote: Righteous indignation never felt by a person of noble character\nwhen he deservedly suffers.]\n*440C* Suppose that a man thinks he has done a wrong to another, the\nnobler he is the less able is he to feel indignant at any suffering, such\nas hunger, or cold, or any other pain which the injured person may inflict\nupon him--these he deems to be just, and, as I say, his anger refuses to\nbe excited by them.\nTrue, he said.\nBut when he thinks that he is the sufferer of the wrong, {133} then he\nboils and chafes, and is on the side of what he believes to be justice;\nand because he suffers hunger *440D* or cold or other pain he is only the\nmore determined to persevere and conquer. His noble spirit will not be\nquelled until he either slays or is slain; or until he hears the voice of\nthe shepherd, that is, reason, bidding his dog bark no more.\nThe illustration is perfect, he replied; and in our State, as we were\nsaying, the auxiliaries were to be dogs, and to hear the voice of the\nrulers, who are their shepherds.\nI perceive, I said, that you quite understand me; there is, however, a\nfurther point which I wish you to consider.\n*440E* What point?\nYou remember that passion or spirit appeared at first sight to be a kind\nof desire, but now we should say quite the contrary; for in the conflict\nof the soul spirit is arrayed on the side of the rational principle.\nMost assuredly.\n[Sidenote: Not two, but three principles in the soul, as in the State.]\nBut a further question arises: Is passion different from reason also, or\nonly a kind of reason; in which latter case, instead of three principles\nin the soul, there will only be two, *441A* the rational and the\nconcupiscent; or rather, as the State was composed of three classes,\ntraders, auxiliaries, counsellors, so may there not be in the individual\nsoul a third element which is passion or spirit, and when not corrupted by\nbad education is the natural auxiliary of reason?\nYes, he said, there must be a third.\nYes, I replied, if passion, which has already been shown to be different\nfrom desire, turn out also to be different from reason.\nBut that is easily proved:--We may observe even in young children that\nthey are full of spirit almost as soon as they are born, whereas some of\nthem never seem to attain to *441B* the use of reason, and most of them\nlate enough.\n[Sidenote: Appeal to Homer.]\nExcellent, I said, and you may see passion equally in brute animals, which\nis a further proof of the truth of what you are saying. And we may once\nmore appeal to the words of Homer, which have been already quoted by us,\n'He smote his breast, and thus rebuked his soul[4],' {134}\n*441C* for in this verse Homer has clearly supposed the power which\nreasons about the better and worse to be different from the unreasoning\nanger which is rebuked by it.\n[Footnote 4: Od. xx. 17, quoted supra, III. 390 D.]\nVery true, he said.\n[Sidenote: The conclusion that the same three principles exist both in the\nState and in the individual applied to each of them.]\nAnd so, after much tossing, we have reached land, and are fairly agreed\nthat the same principles which exist in the State exist also in the\nindividual, and that they are three in number.\nExactly.\nMust we not then infer that the individual is wise in the same way, and in\nvirtue of the same quality which makes the State wise?\nCertainly.\n*441D* Also that the same quality which constitutes courage in the State\nconstitutes courage in the individual, and that both the State and the\nindividual bear the same relation to all the other virtues?\nAssuredly.\nAnd the individual will be acknowledged by us to be just in the same way\nin which the State is just?\nThat follows, of course.\nWe cannot but remember that the justice of the State *441E* consisted in\neach of the three classes doing the work of its own class?\nWe are not very likely to have forgotten, he said.\nWe must recollect that the individual in whom the several qualities of his\nnature do their own work will be just, and will do his own work?\nYes, he said, we must remember that too.\nAnd ought not the rational principle, which is wise, and has the care of\nthe whole soul, to rule, and the passionate or spirited principle to be\nthe subject and ally?\nCertainly.\n[Sidenote: Music and gymnastic will harmonize passion and reason. These\ntwo combined will control desire,]\nAnd, as we were saying, the united influence of music and gymnastic will\nbring them into accord, nerving and sustaining the reason with noble words\nand lessons, and moderating and *442A* soothing and civilizing the\nwildness of passion by harmony and rhythm?\nQuite true, he said.\nAnd these two, thus nurtured and educated, and having {135} learned truly\nto know their own functions, will rule[5] over the concupiscent, which in\neach of us is the largest part of the soul and by nature most insatiable\nof gain; over this they will keep guard, lest, waxing great and strong\nwith the fulness of bodily pleasures, as they are termed, the *442B*\nconcupiscent soul, no longer confined to her own sphere, should attempt to\nenslave and rule those who are not her natural-born subjects, and overturn\nthe whole life of man?\n[Footnote 5: Reading [Greek: prostat\u00ea/seton] with Bekker; or, if the\nreading [Greek: prost\u00ea/seton], which is found in the MSS., be adopted,\nthen the nominative must be supplied from the previous sentence: 'Music\nand gymnastic will place in authority over ...' This is very awkward, and\nthe awkwardness is increased by the necessity of changing the subject at\n[Greek: t\u00ear\u00ea/seton].]\nVery true, he said.\n[Sidenote: and will be the best defenders both of body and soul.]\nBoth together will they not be the best defenders of the whole soul and\nthe whole body against attacks from without; the one counselling, and the\nother fighting under his leader, and courageously executing his commands\nand counsels?\nTrue.\n[Sidenote: The courageous.]\nAnd he is to be deemed courageous whose spirit retains in *442C* pleasure\nand in pain the commands of reason about what he ought or ought not to\nfear?\nRight, he replied.\n[Sidenote: The wise.]\nAnd him we call wise who has in him that little part which rules, and\nwhich proclaims these commands; that part too being supposed to have a\nknowledge of what is for the interest of each of the three parts and of\nthe whole?\nAssuredly.\n[Sidenote: The temperate.]\nAnd would you not say that he is temperate who has these same elements in\nfriendly harmony, in whom the one ruling principle of reason, and the two\nsubject ones of spirit and *442D* desire are equally agreed that reason\nought to rule, and do not rebel?\nCertainly, he said, that is the true account of temperance whether in the\nState or individual.\n[Sidenote: The just.]\nAnd surely, I said, we have explained again and again how and by virtue of\nwhat quality a man will be just.\nThat is very certain.\nAnd is justice dimmer in the individual, and is her form different, or is\nshe the same which we found her to be in the State? {136}\nThere is no difference in my opinion, he said.\n[Sidenote: The nature of justice illustrated by commonplace instances.]\nBecause, if any doubt is still lingering in our minds, a few *442E*\ncommonplace instances will satisfy us of the truth of what I am saying.\nWhat sort of instances do you mean?\nIf the case is put to us, must we not admit that the just *443A* State, or\nthe man who is trained in the principles of such a State, will be less\nlikely than the unjust to make away with a deposit of gold or silver?\nWould any one deny this?\nNo one, he replied.\nWill the just man or citizen ever be guilty of sacrilege or theft, or\ntreachery either to his friends or to his country?\nNever.\nNeither will he ever break faith where there have been oaths or\nagreements?\nImpossible.\nNo one will be less likely to commit adultery, or to dishonour his father\nand mother, or to fail in his religious duties?\nNo one.\n*443B* And the reason is that each part of him is doing its own business,\nwhether in ruling or being ruled?\nExactly so.\nAre you satisfied then that the quality which makes such men and such\nstates is justice, or do you hope to discover some other?\nNot I, indeed.\n[Sidenote: We have realized the hope entertained in the first construction\nof the State.]\nThen our dream has been realized; and the suspicion which we entertained\nat the beginning of our work of construction, *443C* that some divine\npower must have conducted us to a primary form of justice, has now been\nverified?\nYes, certainly.\nAnd the division of labour which required the carpenter and the shoemaker\nand the rest of the citizens to be doing each his own business, and not\nanother's, was a shadow of justice, and for that reason it was of use?\nClearly.\n[Sidenote: The three principles harmonize in one.]\n[Sidenote: The harmony of human life.]\nBut in reality justice was such as we were describing, being concerned\nhowever, not with the outward man, but *443D* with the inward, which is\nthe true self and concernment of {137} man: for the just man does not\npermit the several elements within him to interfere with one another, or\nany of them to do the work of others,--he sets in order his own inner\nlife, and is his own master and his own law, and at peace with himself;\nand when he has bound together the three principles within him, which may\nbe compared to the higher, lower, and middle notes of the scale, and the\nintermediate intervals--when he has bound all these together, and is no\nlonger *443E* many, but has become one entirely temperate and perfectly\nadjusted nature, then he proceeds to act, if he has to act, whether in a\nmatter of property, or in the treatment of the body, or in some affair of\npolitics or private business; always thinking and calling that which\npreserves and co-operates with this harmonious condition, just and good\naction, and the knowledge which presides over it, wisdom, *444A* and that\nwhich at any time impairs this condition, he will call unjust action, and\nthe opinion which presides over it ignorance.\nYou have said the exact truth, Socrates.\nVery good; and if we were to affirm that we had discovered the just man\nand the just State, and the nature of justice in each of them, we should\nnot be telling a falsehood?\nMost certainly not.\nMay we say so, then?\nLet us say so.\nAnd now, I said, injustice has to be considered.\nClearly.\n[Sidenote: Injustice the opposite of justice.]\n*444B* Must not injustice be a strife which arises among the three\nprinciples--a meddlesomeness, and interference, and rising up of a part of\nthe soul against the whole, an assertion of unlawful authority, which is\nmade by a rebellious subject against a true prince, of whom he is the\nnatural vassal,--what is all this confusion and delusion but injustice,\nand intemperance and cowardice and ignorance, and every form of vice?\nExactly so.\n*444C* And if the nature of justice and injustice be known, then the\nmeaning of acting unjustly and being unjust, or, again, of acting justly,\nwill also be perfectly clear?\nWhat do you mean? he said.\nWhy, I said, they are like disease and health; being in the soul just what\ndisease and health are in the body. {138}\nHow so? he said.\n[Sidenote: Analogy of body and soul.]\nWhy, I said, that which is healthy causes health, and that which is\nunhealthy causes disease.\nYes.\n*444D* And just actions cause justice, and unjust actions cause injustice?\nThat is certain.\n[Sidenote: Health : disease :: justice : injustice.]\nAnd the creation of health is the institution of a natural order and\ngovernment of one by another in the parts of the body; and the creation of\ndisease is the production of a state of things at variance with this\nnatural order?\nTrue.\nAnd is not the creation of justice the institution of a natural order and\ngovernment of one by another in the parts of the soul, and the creation of\ninjustice the production of a state of things at variance with the natural\norder?\nExactly so, he said.\nThen virtue is the health and beauty and well-being of the *444E* soul,\nand vice the disease and weakness and deformity of the same?\nTrue.\nAnd do not good practices lead to virtue, and evil practices to vice?\nAssuredly.\n[Sidenote: The old question, whether the just or the unjust is the\nhappier, has become ridiculous.]\n*445A* Still our old question of the comparative advantage of justice and\ninjustice has not been answered: Which is the more profitable, to be just\nand act justly and practise virtue, whether seen or unseen of gods and\nmen, or to be unjust and act unjustly, if only unpunished and unreformed?\nIn my judgment, Socrates, the question has now become ridiculous. We know\nthat, when the bodily constitution is gone, life is no longer endurable,\nthough pampered with all kinds of meats and drinks, and having all wealth\nand all power; and shall we be told that when the very essence of the\nvital principle is undermined and corrupted, life is *445B* still worth\nhaving to a man, if only he be allowed to do whatever he likes with the\nsingle exception that he is not to acquire justice and virtue, or to\nescape from injustice and vice; assuming them both to be such as we have\ndescribed?\nYes, I said, the question is, as you say, ridiculous. Still, {139} as we\nare near the spot at which we may see the truth in the clearest manner\nwith our own eyes, let us not faint by the way.\nCertainly not, he replied.\n*445C* Come up hither, I said, and behold the various forms of vice, those\nof them, I mean, which are worth looking at.\nI am following you, he replied: proceed.\nI said, The argument seems to have reached a height from which, as from\nsome tower of speculation, a man may look down and see that virtue is one,\nbut that the forms of vice are innumerable; there being four special ones\nwhich are deserving of note.\nWhat do you mean? he said.\n[Sidenote: As many forms of the soul as of the State.]\nI mean, I replied, that there appear to be as many forms of the soul as\nthere are distinct forms of the State.\nHow many?\n*445D* There are five of the State, and five of the soul, I said.\nWhat are they?\nThe first, I said, is that which we have been describing, and which may be\nsaid to have two names, monarchy and aristocracy, accordingly as rule is\nexercised by one distinguished man or by many.\nTrue, he replied.\nBut I regard the two names as describing one form only; *445E* for whether\nthe government is in the hands of one or many, if the governors have been\ntrained in the manner which we have supposed, the fundamental laws of the\nState will be maintained.\nThat is true, he replied.\nBOOK V.\n[Sidenote: _Republic V._ SOCRATES, GLAUCON, ADEIMANTUS.]\n[Sidenote: The community of women and children.]\n*449A* Such is the good and true City or State, and the good and true man\nis of the same pattern; and if this is right every other is wrong; and the\nevil is one which affects not only the ordering of the State, but also the\nregulation of the individual soul, and is exhibited in four forms.\nWhat are they? he said.\nI was proceeding to tell the order in which the four evil *449B* forms\nappeared to me to succeed one another, when Polemarchus, who was sitting a\nlittle way off, just beyond Adeimantus, began to whisper to him:\nstretching forth his hand, he took hold of the upper part of his coat by\nthe shoulder, and drew him towards him, leaning forward himself so as to\nbe quite close and saying something in his ear, of which I only caught the\nwords, 'Shall we let him off, or what shall we do?'\nCertainly not, said Adeimantus, raising his voice.\nWho is it, I said, whom you are refusing to let off?\nYou, he said.\n*449C* I repeated[1], Why am I especially not to be let off?\n[Footnote 1: Reading [Greek: e)/ti e)g\u00f4\\ ei)=pon].]\n[Sidenote: The saying 'Friends have all things in common' is an\ninsufficient solution of the problem.]\nWhy, he said, we think that you are lazy, and mean to cheat us out of a\nwhole chapter which is a very important part of the story; and you fancy\nthat we shall not notice your airy way of proceeding; as if it were\nself-evident to everybody, that in the matter of women and children\n'friends have all things in common.'\nAnd was I not right, Adeimantus?\nYes, he said; but what is right in this particular case, like everything\nelse, requires to be explained; for community may be of many kinds.\nPlease, therefore, to say what sort *449D* of community you mean. We have\nbeen long {141} expecting that you would tell us something about the\nfamily life of your citizens--how they will bring children into the world,\nand rear them when they have arrived, and, in general, what is the nature\nof this community of women and children--for we are of opinion that the\nright or wrong management of such matters will have a great and paramount\ninfluence on the State for good or for evil. And now, since the question\nis still undetermined, and you are taking in hand another *450A* State, we\nhave resolved, as you heard, not to let you go until you give an account\nof all this.\nTo that resolution, said Glaucon, you may regard me as saying Agreed.\n[Sidenote: Socrates, Thrasymachus.]\nAnd without more ado, said Thrasymachus, you may consider us all to be\nequally agreed.\n[Sidenote: The feigned surprise of Socrates.]\nI said, You know not what you are doing in thus assailing me: What an\nargument are you raising about the State! Just as I thought that I had\nfinished, and was only too glad that I had laid this question to sleep,\nand was reflecting how fortunate I was in your acceptance of what I then\nsaid, you ask me to begin again at the very foundation, ignorant of *450B*\nwhat a hornet's nest of words you are stirring. Now I foresaw this\ngathering trouble, and avoided it.\n[Sidenote: The good-humour of Thrasymachus.]\nFor what purpose do you conceive that we have come here, said\nThrasymachus,--to look for gold, or to hear discourse?\nYes, but discourse should have a limit.\n[Sidenote: Socrates, Glaucon.]\nYes, Socrates, said Glaucon, and the whole of life is the only limit which\nwise men assign to the hearing of such discourses. But never mind about\nus; take heart yourself *450C* and answer the question in your own way:\nWhat sort of community of women and children is this which is to prevail\namong our guardians? and how shall we manage the period between birth and\neducation, which seems to require the greatest care? Tell us how these\nthings will be.\nYes, my simple friend, but the answer is the reverse of easy; many more\ndoubts arise about this than about our previous conclusions. For the\npracticability of what is said may be doubted; and looked at in another\npoint of view, whether the scheme, if ever so practicable, would be for\nthe best, is also doubtful. Hence I feel a reluctance to approach {142}\nthe *450D* subject, lest our aspiration, my dear friend, should turn out\nto be a dream only.\nFear not, he replied, for your audience will not be hard upon you; they\nare not sceptical or hostile.\nI said: My good friend, I suppose that you mean to encourage me by these\nwords.\nYes, he said.\n[Sidenote: A friendly audience is more dangerous than a hostile one.]\nThen let me tell you that you are doing just the reverse; the\nencouragement which you offer would have been all very well had I myself\nbelieved that I knew what I was talking about: to declare the truth about\nmatters of high *450E* interest which a man honours and loves among wise\nmen who love him need occasion no fear or faltering in his mind; but to\ncarry on an argument when you are yourself only *451A* a hesitating\nenquirer, which is my condition, is a dangerous and slippery thing; and\nthe danger is not that I shall be laughed at (of which the fear would be\nchildish), but that I shall miss the truth where I have most need to be\nsure of my footing, and drag my friends after me in my fall. And I pray\nNemesis not to visit upon me the words which I am going to utter. For I do\nindeed believe that to be an involuntary homicide is a less crime than to\nbe a deceiver about beauty or goodness or justice in the matter of\nlaws[2]. And that is a risk which I would rather run among enemies than\namong friends, and therefore you do well to encourage *451B* me[3].\n[Footnote 2: Or inserting [Greek: kai\\] before [Greek: nomi/m\u00f4n]: 'a\ndeceiver about beauty or goodness or principles of justice or law.']\n[Footnote 3: Reading [Greek: \u00f4(/ste eu)= me paramuthei=].]\nGlaucon laughed and said: Well then, Socrates, in case you and your\nargument do us any serious injury you shall be acquitted beforehand of the\nhomicide, and shall not be held to be a deceiver; take courage then and\nspeak.\nWell, I said, the law says that when a man is acquitted he is free from\nguilt, and what holds at law may hold in argument.\nThen why should you mind?\nWell, I replied, I suppose that I must retrace my steps *451C* and say\nwhat I perhaps ought to have said before in the proper place. The part of\nthe men has been played out, and now properly enough comes the turn of the\nwomen. Of them I will proceed to speak, and the more readily since I am\ninvited by you. {143}\nFor men born and educated like our citizens, the only way, in my opinion,\nof arriving at a right conclusion about the possession and use of women\nand children is to follow the path on which we originally started, when we\nsaid that the men were to be the guardians and watchdogs of the herd.\nTrue.\n*451D* Let us further suppose the birth and education of our women to be\nsubject to similar or nearly similar regulations; then we shall see\nwhether the result accords with our design.\nWhat do you mean?\n[Sidenote: No distinction among the animals such as is made between men\nand women.]\nWhat I mean may be put into the form of a question, I said: Are dogs\ndivided into hes and shes, or do they both share equally in hunting and in\nkeeping watch and in the other duties of dogs? or do we entrust to the\nmales the entire and exclusive care of the flocks, while we leave the\nfemales at home, under the idea that the bearing and suckling their\npuppies is labour enough for them?\n*451E* No, he said, they share alike; the only difference between them is\nthat the males are stronger and the females weaker.\nBut can you use different animals for the same purpose, unless they are\nbred and fed in the same way?\nYou cannot.\nThen, if women are to have the same duties as men, they *452A* must have\nthe same nurture and education?\nYes.\nThe education which was assigned to the men was music and gymnastic.\nYes.\n[Sidenote: Women must be taught music, gymnastic, and military exercises\nequally with men.]\nThen women must be taught music and gymnastic and also the art of war,\nwhich they must practise like the men?\nThat is the inference, I suppose.\nI should rather expect, I said, that several of our proposals, if they are\ncarried out, being unusual, may appear ridiculous.\nNo doubt of it.\nYes, and the most ridiculous thing of all will be the sight of women naked\nin the palaestra, exercising with the men, *452B* especially when they are\nno longer young; they certainly will not be a vision of beauty, any more\nthan the enthusiastic {144} old men who in spite of wrinkles and ugliness\ncontinue to frequent the gymnasia.\nYes, indeed, he said: according to present notions the proposal would be\nthought ridiculous.\nBut then, I said, as we have determined to speak our minds, we must not\nfear the jests of the wits which will be directed against this sort of\ninnovation; how they will talk of women's *452C* attainments both in music\nand gymnastic, and above all about their wearing armour and riding upon\nhorseback!\nVery true, he replied.\n[Sidenote: Convention should not be permitted to stand in the way of a\nhigher good.]\nYet having begun we must go forward to the rough places of the law; at the\nsame time begging of these gentlemen for once in their life to be serious.\nNot long ago, as we shall remind them, the Hellenes were of the opinion,\nwhich is still generally received among the barbarians, that the sight of\na naked man was ridiculous and improper; and when first the Cretans and\nthen the Lacedaemonians introduced the *452D* custom, the wits of that day\nmight equally have ridiculed the innovation.\nNo doubt.\nBut when experience showed that to let all things be uncovered was far\nbetter than to cover them up, and the ludicrous effect to the outward eye\nvanished before the better principle which reason asserted, then the man\nwas perceived to be a fool who directs the shafts of his ridicule at any\nother *452E* sight but that of folly and vice, or seriously inclines to\nweigh the beautiful by any other standard but that of the good[4].\n[Footnote 4: Reading with Paris A. [Greek: kai\\ kalou= ...]]\nVery true, he replied.\nFirst, then, whether the question is to be put in jest or in *453A*\nearnest, let us come to an understanding about the nature of woman: Is she\ncapable of sharing either wholly or partially in the actions of men, or\nnot at all? And is the art of war one of those arts in which she can or\ncan not share? That will be the best way of commencing the enquiry, and\nwill probably lead to the fairest conclusion.\nThat will be much the best way.\nShall we take the other side first and begin by arguing against ourselves;\nin this manner the adversary's position will not be undefended. {145}\n*453B* Why not? he said.\n[Sidenote: Objection: We were saying that every one should do his own\nwork: Have not women and men severally a work of their own?]\nThen let us put a speech into the mouths of our opponents. They will say:\n'Socrates and Glaucon, no adversary need convict you, for you yourselves,\nat the first foundation of the State, admitted the principle that\neverybody was to do the one work suited to his own nature.' And certainly,\nif I am not mistaken, such an admission was made by us. 'And do not the\nnatures of men and women differ very much indeed?' And we shall reply: Of\ncourse they do. Then we shall be asked, 'Whether the tasks assigned to men\nand to women should not be different, and such as are agreeable to their\n*453C* different natures?' Certainly they should. 'But if so, have you not\nfallen into a serious inconsistency in saying that men and women, whose\nnatures are so entirely different, ought to perform the same\nactions?'--What defence will you make for us, my good Sir, against any one\nwho offers these objections?\nThat is not an easy question to answer when asked suddenly; and I shall\nand I do beg of you to draw out the case on our side.\nThese are the objections, Glaucon, and there are many *453D* others of a\nlike kind, which I foresaw long ago; they made me afraid and reluctant to\ntake in hand any law about the possession and nurture of women and\nchildren.\nBy Zeus, he said, the problem to be solved is anything but easy.\nWhy yes, I said, but the fact is that when a man is out of his depth,\nwhether he has fallen into a little swimming bath or into mid ocean, he\nhas to swim all the same.\nVery true.\nAnd must not we swim and try to reach the shore: we will hope that Arion's\ndolphin or some other miraculous help may save us?\n*453E* I suppose so, he said.\nWell then, let us see if any way of escape can be found. We\nacknowledged--did we not? that different natures ought to have different\npursuits, and that men's and women's natures are different. And now what\nare we saying?--that different natures ought to have the same\npursuits,--this is the inconsistency which is charged upon us. {146}\nPrecisely.\n*454A* Verily, Glaucon, I said, glorious is the power of the art of\ncontradiction!\nWhy do you say so?\n[Sidenote: The seeming inconsistency arises out of a verbal opposition.]\nBecause I think that many a man falls into the practice against his will.\nWhen he thinks that he is reasoning he is really disputing, just because\nhe cannot define and divide, and so know that of which he is speaking; and\nhe will pursue a merely verbal opposition in the spirit of contention and\nnot of fair discussion.\nYes, he replied, such is very often the case; but what has that to do with\nus and our argument?\n*454B* A great deal; for there is certainly a danger of our getting\nunintentionally into a verbal opposition.\nIn what way?\n[Sidenote: When we assigned to different natures different pursuits, we\nmeant only those differences of nature which affected the pursuits.]\nWhy we valiantly and pugnaciously insist upon the verbal truth, that\ndifferent natures ought to have different pursuits, but we never\nconsidered at all what was the meaning of sameness or difference of\nnature, or why we distinguished them when we assigned different pursuits\nto different natures and the same to the same natures.\nWhy, no, he said, that was never considered by us.\n*454C* I said: Suppose that by way of illustration we were to ask the\nquestion whether there is not an opposition in nature between bald men and\nhairy men; and if this is admitted by us, then, if bald men are cobblers,\nwe should forbid the hairy men to be cobblers, and conversely?\nThat would be a jest, he said.\nYes, I said, a jest; and why? because we never meant when we constructed\nthe State, that the opposition of natures should extend to every\ndifference, but only to those *454D* differences which affected the\npursuit in which the individual is engaged; we should have argued, for\nexample, that a physician and one who is in mind a physician[5] may be\nsaid to have the same nature.\n[Footnote 5: Reading [Greek: i)atro\\n me\\n kai\\ i)atriko\\n t\u00ea\\n psuch\u00ea\\n\no)/nta].]\nTrue.\nWhereas the physician and the carpenter have different natures?\nCertainly. {147}\nAnd if, I said, the male and female sex appear to differ in their fitness\nfor any art or pursuit, we should say that such pursuit or art ought to be\nassigned to one or the other of them; but if the difference consists only\nin women bearing *454E* and men begetting children, this does not amount\nto a proof that a woman differs from a man in respect of the sort of\neducation she should receive; and we shall therefore continue to maintain\nthat our guardians and their wives ought to have the same pursuits.\nVery true, he said.\nNext, we shall ask our opponent how, in reference to any *455A* of the\npursuits or arts of civic life, the nature of a woman differs from that of\na man?\nThat will be quite fair.\nAnd perhaps he, like yourself, will reply that to give a sufficient answer\non the instant is not easy; but after a little reflection there is no\ndifficulty.\nYes, perhaps.\nSuppose then that we invite him to accompany us in the *455B* argument,\nand then we may hope to show him that there is nothing peculiar in the\nconstitution of women which would affect them in the administration of the\nState.\nBy all means.\n[Sidenote: The same natural gifts are found in both sexes, but they are\npossessed in a higher degree by men than women.]\nLet us say to him: Come now, and we will ask you a question:--when you\nspoke of a nature gifted or not gifted in any respect, did you mean to say\nthat one man will acquire a thing easily, another with difficulty; a\nlittle learning will lead the one to discover a great deal; whereas the\nother, after much study and application, no sooner learns than he forgets;\nor again, did you mean, that the one has a body which is a good servant to\nhis mind, while the body of the other is a hindrance to him?--would not\nthese be the sort *455C* of differences which distinguish the man gifted\nby nature from the one who is ungifted?\nNo one will deny that.\nAnd can you mention any pursuit of mankind in which the male sex has not\nall these gifts and qualities in a higher degree than the female? Need\nI waste time in speaking of the art of weaving, and the management of\npancakes and preserves, in which womankind does really appear to be {148}\ngreat, and in which for her to be beaten by a man is of all *455D* things\nthe most absurd?\nYou are quite right, he replied, in maintaining the general inferiority of\nthe female sex: although many women are in many things superior to many\nmen, yet on the whole what you say is true.\nAnd if so, my friend, I said, there is no special faculty of\nadministration in a state which a woman has because she is a woman, or\nwhich a man has by virtue of his sex, but the gifts of nature are alike\ndiffused in both; all the pursuits of *455E* men are the pursuits of women\nalso, but in all of them a woman is inferior to a man.\nVery true.\n[Sidenote: Men and women are to be governed by the same laws and to have\nthe same pursuits.]\nThen are we to impose all our enactments on men and none of them on women?\nThat will never do.\n*456A* One woman has a gift of healing, another not; one is a musician,\nand another has no music in her nature?\nVery true.\nAnd one woman has a turn for gymnastic and military exercises, and another\nis unwarlike and hates gymnastics?\nCertainly.\nAnd one woman is a philosopher, and another is an enemy of philosophy; one\nhas spirit, and another is without spirit?\nThat is also true.\nThen one woman will have the temper of a guardian, and another not. Was\nnot the selection of the male guardians determined by differences of this\nsort?\nYes.\nMen and women alike possess the qualities which make a guardian; they\ndiffer only in their comparative strength or weakness.\nObviously.\n*456B* And those women who have such qualities are to be selected as the\ncompanions and colleagues of men who have similar qualities and whom they\nresemble in capacity and in character?\nVery true.\nAnd ought not the same natures to have the same pursuits?\nThey ought.\nThen, as we were saying before, there is nothing unnatural {149} in\nassigning music and gymnastic to the wives of the guardians--to that point\nwe come round again.\nCertainly not.\nThe law which we then enacted was agreeable to nature, *456C* and\ntherefore not an impossibility or mere aspiration; and the contrary\npractice, which prevails at present, is in reality a violation of nature.\nThat appears to be true.\nWe had to consider, first, whether our proposals were possible, and\nsecondly whether they were the most beneficial?\nYes.\nAnd the possibility has been acknowledged?\nYes.\nThe very great benefit has next to be established?\nQuite so.\n[Sidenote: There are different degrees of goodness both in women and in\nmen.]\nYou will admit that the same education which makes a man a good guardian\nwill make a woman a good guardian; for *456D* their original nature is the\nsame?\nYes.\nI should like to ask you a question.\nWhat is it?\nWould you say that all men are equal in excellence, or is one man better\nthan another?\nThe latter.\nAnd in the commonwealth which we were founding do you conceive the\nguardians who have been brought up on our model system to be more perfect\nmen, or the cobblers whose education has been cobbling?\nWhat a ridiculous question!\nYou have answered me, I replied: Well, and may we not *456E* further say\nthat our guardians are the best of our citizens?\nBy far the best.\nAnd will not their wives be the best women?\nYes, by far the best.\nAnd can there be anything better for the interests of the State than that\nthe men and women of a State should be as good as possible?\nThere can be nothing better.\n*457A* And this is what the arts of music and gymnastic, when present in\nsuch manner as we have described, will accomplish? {150}\nCertainly.\nThen we have made an enactment not only possible but in the highest degree\nbeneficial to the State?\nTrue.\n[Sidenote: The noble saying.]\nThen let the wives of our guardians strip, for their virtue will be their\nrobe, and let them share in the toils of war and the defence of their\ncountry; only in the distribution of labours the lighter are to be\nassigned to the women, who are the weaker natures, but in other respects\ntheir duties are to be the same. *457B* And as for the man who laughs at\nnaked women exercising their bodies from the best of motives, in his\nlaughter he is plucking\n'A fruit of unripe wisdom,'\nand he himself is ignorant of what he is laughing at, or what he is\nabout;--for that is, and ever will be, the best of sayings, _That the\nuseful is the noble and the hurtful is the base._\nVery true.\nHere, then, is one difficulty in our law about women, which we may say\nthat we have now escaped; the wave has not swallowed us up alive for\nenacting that the guardians of either sex should have all their pursuits\nin common; to the utility *457C* and also to the possibility of this\narrangement the consistency of the argument with itself bears witness.\nYes, that was a mighty wave which you have escaped.\n[Sidenote: The second and greater wave.]\nYes, I said, but a greater is coming; you will not think much of this when\nyou see the next.\nGo on; let me see.\nThe law, I said, which is the sequel of this and of all that has preceded,\nis to the following effect,--'that the wives of *457D* our guardians are\nto be common, and their children are to be common, and no parent is to\nknow his own child, nor any child his parent.'\nYes, he said, that is a much greater wave than the other; and the\npossibility as well as the utility of such a law are far more\nquestionable.\nI do not think, I said, that there can be any dispute about the very great\nutility of having wives and children in common; the possibility is quite\nanother matter, and will be very much disputed. {151}\n*457E* I think that a good many doubts may be raised about both.\n[Sidenote: The utility and possibility of a community of wives and\nchildren.]\nYou imply that the two questions must be combined, I replied. Now I meant\nthat you should admit the utility; and in this way, as I thought, I should\nescape from one of them, and then there would remain only the possibility.\nBut that little attempt is detected, and therefore you will please to give\na defence of both.\n[Sidenote: The utility to be considered first, the possibility\nafterwards.]\nWell, I said, I submit to my fate. Yet grant me a little *458A* favour:\nlet me feast my mind with the dream as day dreamers are in the habit of\nfeasting themselves when they are walking alone; for before they have\ndiscovered any means of effecting their wishes--that is a matter which\nnever troubles them--they would rather not tire themselves by thinking\nabout possibilities; but assuming that what they desire is already granted\nto them, they proceed with their plan, and delight in detailing what they\nmean to do when their wish has come true--that is a way which they have of\nnot doing much good *458B* to a capacity which was never good for much.\nNow I myself am beginning to lose heart, and I should like, with your\npermission, to pass over the question of possibility at present. Assuming\ntherefore the possibility of the proposal, I shall now proceed to enquire\nhow the rulers will carry out these arrangements, and I shall demonstrate\nthat our plan, if executed, will be of the greatest benefit to the State\nand to the guardians. First of all, then, if you have no objection, I will\nendeavour with your help to consider the advantages of the measure; and\nhereafter the question of possibility.\nI have no objection; proceed.\nFirst, I think that if our rulers and their auxiliaries are to *458C* be\nworthy of the name which they bear, there must be willingness to obey in\nthe one and the power of command in the other; the guardians must\nthemselves obey the laws, and they must also imitate the spirit of them in\nany details which are entrusted to their care.\nThat is right, he said.\n[Sidenote: The legislator will select guardians male and female, who will\nmeet at common meals and exercises, and will be drawn to one another by an\nirresistible necessity.]\nYou, I said, who are their legislator, having selected the men, will now\nselect the women and give them to them;--they must be as far as possible\nof like natures with them; and they must live in common houses and meet at\ncommon meals. None of them will have anything specially his or her own;\n{152} *458D* they will be together, and will be brought up together, and\nwill associate at gymnastic exercises. And so they will be drawn by a\nnecessity of their natures to have intercourse with each other--necessity\nis not too strong a word, I think?\nYes, he said;--necessity, not geometrical, but another sort of necessity\nwhich lovers know, and which is far more convincing and constraining to\nthe mass of mankind.\nTrue, I said; and this, Glaucon, like all the rest, must proceed after an\norderly fashion; in a city of the blessed, *458E* licentiousness is an\nunholy thing which the rulers will forbid.\nYes, he said, and it ought not to be permitted.\nThen clearly the next thing will be to make matrimony sacred in the\nhighest degree, and what is most beneficial will be deemed sacred?\n*459A* Exactly.\n[Sidenote: The breeding of human beings, as of animals, to be from the\nbest and from those who are of a ripe age.]\nAnd how can marriages be made most beneficial?--that is a question which\nI put to you, because I see in your house dogs for hunting, and of the\nnobler sort of birds not a few. Now, I beseech you, do tell me, have you\never attended to their pairing and breeding?\nIn what particulars?\nWhy, in the first place, although they are all of a good sort, are not\nsome better than others?\nTrue.\nAnd do you breed from them all indifferently, or do you take care to breed\nfrom the best only?\nFrom the best.\n*459B* And do you take the oldest or the youngest, or only those of ripe\nage?\nI choose only those of ripe age.\nAnd if care was not taken in the breeding, your dogs and birds would\ngreatly deteriorate?\nCertainly.\nAnd the same of horses and animals in general?\nUndoubtedly.\nGood heavens! my dear friend, I said, what consummate skill will our\nrulers need if the same principle holds of the human species!\n*459C* Certainly, the same principle holds; but why does this involve any\nparticular skill? {153}\n[Sidenote: Useful lies 'very honest knaveries.']\nBecause, I said, our rulers will often have to practise upon the body\ncorporate with medicines. Now you know that when patients do not require\nmedicines, but have only to be put under a regimen, the inferior sort of\npractitioner is deemed to be good enough; but when medicine has to be\ngiven, then the doctor should be more of a man.\nThat is quite true, he said; but to what are you alluding?\nI mean, I replied, that our rulers will find a considerable dose of\nfalsehood and deceit necessary for the good of their subjects: *459D* we\nwere saying that the use of all these things regarded as medicines might\nbe of advantage.\nAnd we were very right.\nAnd this lawful use of them seems likely to be often needed in the\nregulations of marriages and births.\nHow so?\n[Sidenote: Arrangements for the improvement of the breed;]\nWhy, I said, the principle has been already laid down that the best of\neither sex should be united with the best as often, and the inferior with\nthe inferior, as seldom as possible; and that they should rear the\noffspring of the one sort of union, *459E* but not of the other, if the\nflock is to be maintained in first-rate condition. Now these goings on\nmust be a secret which the rulers only know, or there will be a further\ndanger of our herd, as the guardians may be termed, breaking out into\nrebellion.\nVery true.\n[Sidenote: and for the regulation of population.]\nHad we not better appoint certain festivals at which we will bring\ntogether the brides and bridegrooms, and sacrifices *460A* will be offered\nand suitable hymeneal songs composed by our poets: the number of weddings\nis a matter which must be left to the discretion of the rulers, whose aim\nwill be to preserve the average of population? There are many other things\nwhich they will have to consider, such as the effects of wars and diseases\nand any similar agencies, in order as far as this is possible to prevent\nthe State from becoming either too large or too small.\nCertainly, he replied.\n[Sidenote: Pairing by lot.]\nWe shall have to invent some ingenious kind of lots which the less worthy\nmay draw on each occasion of our bringing them together, and then they\nwill accuse their own ill-luck and not the rulers. {154}\nTo be sure, he said.\n[Sidenote: The brave deserve the fair.]\n*460B* And I think that our braver and better youth, besides their other\nhonours and rewards, might have greater facilities of intercourse with\nwomen given them; their bravery will be a reason, and such fathers ought\nto have as many sons as possible.\nTrue.\nAnd the proper officers, whether male or female or both, for offices are\nto be held by women as well as by men--\nYes--\n[Sidenote: What is to be done with the children?]\n*460C* The proper officers will take the offspring of the good parents to\nthe pen or fold, and there they will deposit them with certain nurses who\ndwell in a separate quarter; but the offspring of the inferior, or of the\nbetter when they chance to be deformed, will be put away in some\nmysterious, unknown place, as they should be.\nYes, he said, that must be done if the breed of the guardians is to be\nkept pure.\nThey will provide for their nurture, and will bring the mothers to the\nfold when they are full of milk, taking the *460D* greatest possible care\nthat no mother recognises her own child; and other wet-nurses may be\nengaged if more are required. Care will also be taken that the process of\nsuckling shall not be protracted too long; and the mothers will have no\ngetting up at night or other trouble, but will hand over all this sort of\nthing to the nurses and attendants.\nYou suppose the wives of our guardians to have a fine easy time of it when\nthey are having children.\nWhy, said I, and so they ought. Let us, however, proceed with our scheme.\nWe were saying that the parents should be in the prime of life?\nVery true.\n*460E* And what is the prime of life? May it not be defined as a period of\nabout twenty years in a woman's life, and thirty in a man's?\nWhich years do you mean to include?\n[Sidenote: A woman to bear children from twenty to forty; a man to beget\nthem from twenty-five to fifty-five.]\nA woman, I said, at twenty years of age may begin to bear children to the\nState, and continue to bear them until forty; a man may begin at\nfive-and-twenty, when he has passed the {155} point at which the pulse of\nlife beats quickest, and continue to beget children until he be\nfifty-five.\n*461A* Certainly, he said, both in men and women those years are the prime\nof physical as well as of intellectual vigour.\nAny one above or below the prescribed ages who takes part in the public\nhymeneals shall be said to have done an unholy and unrighteous thing; the\nchild of which he is the father, if it steals into life, will have been\nconceived under auspices very unlike the sacrifices and prayers, which at\neach hymeneal priestesses and priest and the whole city will offer, that\nthe new generation may be better and more useful than their *461B* good\nand useful parents, whereas his child will be the offspring of darkness\nand strange lust.\nVery true, he replied.\nAnd the same law will apply to any one of those within the prescribed age\nwho forms a connection with any woman in the prime of life without the\nsanction of the rulers; for we shall say that he is raising up a bastard\nto the State, uncertified and unconsecrated.\nVery true, he replied.\n[Sidenote: After the prescribed age has been passed, more licence is\nallowed: but all who were born after certain hymeneal festivals at which\ntheir parents or grandparents came together must be kept separate.]\nThis applies, however, only to those who are within the specified age:\nafter that we allow them to range at will, *461C* except that a man may\nnot marry his daughter or his daughter's daughter, or his mother or his\nmother's mother; and women, on the other hand, are prohibited from\nmarrying their sons or fathers, or son's son or father's father, and so on\nin either direction. And we grant all this, accompanying the permission\nwith strict orders to prevent any embryo which may come into being from\nseeing the light; and if any force a way to the birth, the parents must\nunderstand that the offspring of such an union cannot be maintained, and\narrange accordingly.\nThat also, he said, is a reasonable proposition. But how *461D* will they\nknow who are fathers and daughters, and so on?\nThey will never know. The way will be this:--dating from the day of the\nhymeneal, the bridegroom who was then married will call all the male\nchildren who are born in the seventh and tenth month afterwards his sons,\nand the female children his daughters, and they will call him father, and\nhe will call their children his grandchildren, and they {156} will call\nthe elder generation grandfathers and grandmothers. All who were begotten\nat the time when their fathers and mothers came together will be called\ntheir brothers and *461E* sisters, and these, as I was saying, will be\nforbidden to inter-marry. This, however, is not to be understood as an\nabsolute prohibition of the marriage of brothers and sisters; if the lot\nfavours them, and they receive the sanction of the Pythian oracle, the law\nwill allow them.\nQuite right, he replied.\nSuch is the scheme, Glaucon, according to which the guardians of our State\nare to have their wives and families in common. And now you would have the\nargument show that this community is consistent with the rest of our\npolity, and also that nothing can be better--would you not?\n*462A* Yes, certainly.\nShall we try to find a common basis by asking of ourselves what ought to\nbe the chief aim of the legislator in making laws and in the organization\nof a State,--what is the greatest good, and what is the greatest evil, and\nthen consider whether our previous description has the stamp of the good\nor of the evil?\nBy all means.\n[Sidenote: The greatest good of States, unity; the greatest evil, discord.\nThe one the result of public, the other of private feelings.]\nCan there be any greater evil than discord and distraction *462B* and\nplurality where unity ought to reign? or any greater good than the bond of\nunity?\nThere cannot.\nAnd there is unity where there is community of pleasures and pains--where\nall the citizens are glad or grieved on the same occasions of joy and\nsorrow?\nNo doubt.\nYes; and where there is no common but only private feeling a State is\ndisorganized--when you have one half of the world triumphing and the other\nplunged in grief at *462C* the same events happening to the city or the\ncitizens?\nCertainly.\nSuch differences commonly originate in a disagreement about the use of the\nterms 'mine' and 'not mine,' 'his' and 'not his.'\nExactly so.\nAnd is not that the best-ordered State in which the greatest {157} number\nof persons apply the terms 'mine' and 'not mine' in the same way to the\nsame thing?\nQuite true.\n[Sidenote: The State like a living being which feels altogether when hurt\nin any part.]\nOr that again which most nearly approaches to the condition of the\nindividual--as in the body, when but a finger of one of us is hurt, the\nwhole frame, drawn towards the soul as a centre and forming one kingdom\nunder the ruling power *462D* therein, feels the hurt and sympathizes all\ntogether with the part affected, and we say that the man has a pain in his\nfinger; and the same expression is used about any other part of the body,\nwhich has a sensation of pain at suffering or of pleasure at the\nalleviation of suffering.\nVery true, he replied; and I agree with you that in the best-ordered State\nthere is the nearest approach to this common feeling which you describe.\nThen when any one of the citizens experiences any good *462E* or evil, the\nwhole State will make his case their own, and will either rejoice or\nsorrow with him?\nYes, he said, that is what will happen in a well-ordered State.\n[Sidenote: How different are the terms which are applied to the rulers in\nother States and in our own!]\nIt will now be time, I said, for us to return to our State and see whether\nthis or some other form is most in accordance with these fundamental\nprinciples.\nVery good.\n*463A* Our State like every other has rulers and subjects?\nTrue.\nAll of whom will call one another citizens?\nOf course.\nBut is there not another name which people give to their rulers in other\nStates?\nGenerally they call them masters, but in democratic States they simply\ncall them rulers.\nAnd in our State what other name besides that of citizens do the people\ngive the rulers?\n*463B* They are called saviours and helpers, he replied.\nAnd what do the rulers call the people?\nTheir maintainers and foster-fathers.\nAnd what do they call them in other States?\nSlaves.\nAnd what do the rulers call one another in other States? {158}\nFellow-rulers.\nAnd what in ours?\nFellow-guardians.\nDid you ever know an example in any other State of a ruler who would speak\nof one of his colleagues as his friend and of another as not being his\nfriend?\nYes, very often.\nAnd the friend he regards and describes as one in whom *463C* he has an\ninterest, and the other as a stranger in whom he has no interest?\nExactly.\nBut would any of your guardians think or speak of any other guardian as a\nstranger?\nCertainly he would not; for every one whom they meet will be regarded by\nthem either as a brother or sister, or father or mother, or son or\ndaughter, or as the child or parent of those who are thus connected with\nhim.\n[Sidenote: The State one family.]\nCapital, I said; but let me ask you once more: Shall they *463D* be a\nfamily in name only; or shall they in all their actions be true to the\nname? For example, in the use of the word 'father,' would the care of a\nfather be implied and the filial reverence and duty and obedience to him\nwhich the law commands; and is the violator of these duties to be regarded\nas an impious and unrighteous person who is not likely to receive much\ngood either at the hands of God or of man? Are these to be or not to be\nthe strains which the children will hear repeated in their ears by all the\ncitizens about those who are intimated to them to be their parents and the\nrest of their kinsfolk?\n[Sidenote: Using the same terms, they will have the same modes of thinking\nand acting, and this is to be attributed mainly to the community of women\nand children.]\n*463E* These, he said, and none other; for what can be more ridiculous\nthan for them to utter the names of family ties with the lips only and not\nto act in the spirit of them?\nThen in our city the language of harmony and concord will be more often\nheard than in any other. As I was describing before, when any one is well\nor ill, the universal word will be 'with me it is well' or 'it is ill.'\n*464A* Most true.\nAnd agreeably to this mode of thinking and speaking, were we not saying\nthat they will have their pleasures and pains in common? {159}\nYes, and so they will.\nAnd they will have a common interest in the same thing which they will\nalike call 'my own,' and having this common interest they will have a\ncommon feeling of pleasure and pain?\nYes, far more so than in other States.\nAnd the reason of this, over and above the general constitution of the\nState, will be that the guardians will have a community of women and\nchildren?\nThat will be the chief reason.\n*464B* And this unity of feeling we admitted to be the greatest good, as\nwas implied in our own comparison of a well-ordered State to the relation\nof the body and the members, when affected by pleasure or pain?\nThat we acknowledged, and very rightly.\nThen the community of wives and children among our citizens is clearly the\nsource of the greatest good to the State?\nCertainly.\nAnd this agrees with the other principle which we were affirming,--that\nthe guardians were not to have houses or *464C* lands or any other\nproperty; their pay was to be their food, which they were to receive from\nthe other citizens, and they were to have no private expenses; for we\nintended them to preserve their true character of guardians.\nRight, he replied.\n[Sidenote: There will be no private interests among them, and therefore no\nlawsuits or trials for assault or violence to elders.]\nBoth the community of property and the community of families, as I am\nsaying, tend to make them more truly guardians; they will not tear the\ncity in pieces by differing about 'mine' and 'not mine;' each man dragging\nany *464D* acquisition which he has made into a separate house of his own,\nwhere he has a separate wife and children and private pleasures and pains;\nbut all will be affected as far as may be by the same pleasures and pains\nbecause they are all of one opinion about what is near and dear to them,\nand therefore they all tend towards a common end.\nCertainly, he replied.\nAnd as they have nothing but their persons which they can call their own,\nsuits and complaints will have no existence *464E* among them; they will\nbe delivered from all those quarrels of which money or children or\nrelations are the occasion. {160}\nOf course they will.\nNeither will trials for assault or insult ever be likely to occur among\nthem. For that equals should defend themselves against equals we shall\nmaintain to be honourable and right; *465A* we shall make the protection\nof the person a matter of necessity.\nThat is good, he said.\nYes; and there is a further good in the law; viz. that if a man has a\nquarrel with another he will satisfy his resentment then and there, and\nnot proceed to more dangerous lengths.\nCertainly.\nTo the elder shall be assigned the duty of ruling and chastising the\nyounger.\nClearly.\nNor can there be a doubt that the younger will not strike or do any other\nviolence to an elder, unless the magistrates command him; nor will he\nslight him in any way. For there are two guardians, shame and fear, mighty\nto prevent him: shame, which makes men refrain from laying hands on *465B*\nthose who are to them in the relation of parents; fear, that the injured\none will be succoured by the others who are his brothers, sons, fathers.\nThat is true, he replied.\nThen in every way the laws will help the citizens to keep the peace with\none another?\nYes, there will be no want of peace.\n[Sidenote: From how many other evils will our citizens be delivered!]\nAnd as the guardians will never quarrel among themselves there will be no\ndanger of the rest of the city being divided either against them or\nagainst one another.\nNone whatever.\nI hardly like even to mention the little meannesses of *465C* which they\nwill be rid, for they are beneath notice: such, for example, as the\nflattery of the rich by the poor, and all the pains and pangs which men\nexperience in bringing up a family, and in finding money to buy\nnecessaries for their household, borrowing and then repudiating, getting\nhow they can, and giving the money into the hands of women and slaves to\nkeep--the many evils of so many kinds which people suffer in this way are\nmean enough and obvious enough, and not worth speaking of. {161}\n*465D* Yes, he said, a man has no need of eyes in order to perceive that.\nAnd from all these evils they will be delivered, and their life will be\nblessed as the life of Olympic victors and yet more blessed.\nHow so?\nThe Olympic victor, I said, is deemed happy in receiving a part only of\nthe blessedness which is secured to our citizens, who have won a more\nglorious victory and have a more complete maintenance at the public cost.\nFor the victory which they have won is the salvation of the whole State;\nand the crown with which they and their children are crowned is the\nfulness of all that life needs; they receive *465E* rewards from the hands\nof their country while living, and after death have an honourable burial.\nYes, he said, and glorious rewards they are.\n[Sidenote: Answer to the charge of Adeimantus that we made our citizens\nunhappy for their own good.]\nDo you remember, I said, how in the course of the previous *466A*\ndiscussion[6] some one who shall be nameless accused us of making our\nguardians unhappy--they had nothing and might have possessed all\nthings--to whom we replied that, if an occasion offered, we might perhaps\nhereafter consider this question, but that, as at present advised, we\nwould make our guardians truly guardians, and that we were fashioning the\nState with a view to the greatest happiness, not of any particular class,\nbut of the whole?\n[Footnote 6: Pages 419, 420 ff.]\nYes, I remember.\n[Sidenote: Their life not to be compared with that of citizens in ordinary\nStates.]\nAnd what do you say, now that the life of our protectors is made out to be\nfar better and nobler than that of Olympic *466B* victors--is the life of\nshoemakers, or any other artisans, or of husbandmen, to be compared with\nit?\nCertainly not.\n[Sidenote: He who seeks to be more than a guardian is naught.]\nAt the same time I ought here to repeat what I have said elsewhere, that\nif any of our guardians shall try to be happy in such a manner that he\nwill cease to be a guardian, and is not content with this safe and\nharmonious life, which, in our judgment, is of all lives the best, but\ninfatuated by some youthful conceit of happiness which gets up into his\nhead *466C* shall seek to appropriate the whole state to himself, then he\n{162} will have to learn how wisely Hesiod spoke, when he said, 'half is\nmore than the whole.'\nIf he were to consult me, I should say to him: Stay where you are, when\nyou have the offer of such a life.\n[Sidenote: The common way of life includes common education, common\nchildren, common services and duties of men and women.]\nYou agree then, I said, that men and women are to have a common way of\nlife such as we have described--common education, common children; and\nthey are to watch over the citizens in common whether abiding in the city\nor going out to war; they are to keep watch together, and to hunt *466D*\ntogether like dogs; and always and in all things, as far as they are able,\nwomen are to share with the men? And in so doing they will do what is\nbest, and will not violate, but preserve the natural relation of the\nsexes.\nI agree with you, he replied.\nThe enquiry, I said, has yet to be made, whether such a community be found\npossible--as among other animals, so also among men--and if possible, in\nwhat way possible?\nYou have anticipated the question which I was about to suggest.\n*466E* There is no difficulty, I said, in seeing how war will be carried\non by them.\nHow?\n[Sidenote: The children to accompany their parents on military\nexpeditions;]\nWhy, of course they will go on expeditions together; and will take with\nthem any of their children who are strong enough, that, after the manner\nof the artisan's child, they may look on at the work which they will have\nto do when they are grown up; *467A* and besides looking on they will have\nto help and be of use in war, and to wait upon their fathers and mothers.\nDid you never observe in the arts how the potters' boys look on and help,\nlong before they touch the wheel?\nYes, I have.\nAnd shall potters be more careful in educating their children and in\ngiving them the opportunity of seeing and practising their duties than our\nguardians will be?\nThe idea is ridiculous, he said.\nThere is also the effect on the parents, with whom, as with *467B* other\nanimals, the presence of their young ones will be the greatest incentive\nto valour.\nThat is quite true, Socrates; and yet if they are defeated, which may\noften happen in war, how great the danger is! {163} the children will be\nlost as well as their parents, and the State will never recover.\nTrue, I said; but would you never allow them to run any risk?\nI am far from saying that.\nWell, but if they are ever to run a risk should they not do so on some\noccasion when, if they escape disaster, they will be the better for it?\nClearly.\n[Sidenote: but care must be taken that they do not run any serious risk.]\n*467C* Whether the future soldiers do or do not see war in the days of\ntheir youth is a very important matter, for the sake of which some risk\nmay fairly be incurred.\nYes, very important.\nThis then must be our first step,--to make our children spectators of war;\nbut we must also contrive that they shall be secured against danger; then\nall will be well.\nTrue.\nTheir parents may be supposed not to be blind to the risks of war, but to\nknow, as far as human foresight can, what *467D* expeditions are safe and\nwhat dangerous?\nThat may be assumed.\nAnd they will take them on the safe expeditions and be cautious about the\ndangerous ones?\nTrue.\nAnd they will place them under the command of experienced veterans who\nwill be their leaders and teachers?\nVery properly.\nStill, the dangers of war cannot be always foreseen; there is a good deal\nof chance about them?\nTrue.\nThen against such chances the children must be at once furnished with\nwings, in order that in the hour of need they may fly away and escape.\n*467E* What do you mean? he said.\nI mean that we must mount them on horses in their earliest youth, and when\nthey have learnt to ride, take them on horseback to see war: the horses\nmust not be spirited and warlike, but the most tractable and yet the\nswiftest that can be had. In this way they will get an excellent view of\nwhat is *468A* hereafter to be their own business; and if there is danger\nthey have only to follow their elder leaders and escape. {164}\nI believe that you are right, he said.\n[Sidenote: The coward is to be degraded into a lower rank.]\nNext, as to war; what are to be the relations of your soldiers to one\nanother and to their enemies? I should be inclined to propose that the\nsoldier who leaves his rank or throws away his arms, or is guilty of any\nother act of cowardice, should be degraded into the rank of a husbandman\nor artisan. What do you think?\nBy all means, I should say.\nAnd he who allows himself to be taken prisoner may as well be made a\npresent of to his enemies; he is their lawful prey, and let them do what\nthey like with him.\n*468B* Certainly.\n[Sidenote: The hero to receive honour from his comrades and favour from\nhis beloved,]\nBut the hero who has distinguished himself, what shall be done to him? In\nthe first place, he shall receive honour in the army from his youthful\ncomrades; every one of them in succession shall crown him. What do you\nsay?\nI approve.\nAnd what do you say to his receiving the right hand of fellowship?\nTo that too, I agree.\nBut you will hardly agree to my next proposal.\nWhat is your proposal?\nThat he should kiss and be kissed by them.\nMost certainly, and I should be disposed to go further, and say: *468C*\nLet no one whom he has a mind to kiss refuse to be kissed by him while the\nexpedition lasts. So that if there be a lover in the army, whether his\nlove be youth or maiden, he may be more eager to win the prize of valour.\nCapital, I said. That the brave man is to have more wives than others has\nbeen already determined: and he is to have first choices in such matters\nmore than others, in order that he may have as many children as possible?\nAgreed.\n[Sidenote: and to have precedence, and a larger share of meats and\ndrinks;]\nAgain, there is another manner in which, according to *468D* Homer, brave\nyouths should be honoured; for he tells how Ajax[7], after he had\ndistinguished himself in battle, was rewarded with long chines, which\nseems to be a compliment appropriate to a hero in the flower of his age,\nbeing not only a tribute of honour but also a very strengthening thing.\n[Footnote 7: Iliad, vii. 321.]\n{165} Most true, he said.\nThen in this, I said, Homer shall be our teacher; and we too, at\nsacrifices and on the like occasions, will honour the brave according to\nthe measure of their valour, whether men or women, with hymns and those\nother distinctions which we were mentioning; also with\n*468E* 'seats of precedence, and meats and full cups[8];'\nand in honouring them, we shall be at the same time training them.\n[Footnote 8: Iliad, viii. 161.]\nThat, he replied, is excellent.\nYes, I said; and when a man dies gloriously in war shall we not say, in\nthe first place, that he is of the golden race?\nTo be sure.\n[Sidenote: also to be worshipped after death.]\nNay, have we not the authority of Hesiod for affirming that when they are\ndead\n*469A* 'They are holy angels upon the earth, authors of good, averters\nof evil, the guardians of speech-gifted men'?[9]\n[Footnote 9: Probably Works and Days, 121 foll.]\nYes; and we accept his authority.\nWe must learn of the god how we are to order the sepulture of divine and\nheroic personages, and what is to be their special distinction; and we\nmust do as he bids?\nBy all means.\nAnd in ages to come we will reverence them and kneel *469B* before their\nsepulchres as at the graves of heroes. And not only they but any who are\ndeemed pre-eminently good, whether they die from age, or in any other way,\nshall be admitted to the same honours.\nThat is very right, he said.\n[Sidenote: Behaviour to enemies.]\nNext, how shall our soldiers treat their enemies? What about this?\nIn what respect do you mean?\nFirst of all, in regard to slavery? Do you think it right that Hellenes\nshould enslave Hellenic States, or allow others to enslave them, if they\ncan help? Should not their custom be to spare them, considering the danger\nwhich there is *469C* that the whole race may one day fall under the yoke\nof the barbarians?\nTo spare them is infinitely better. {166}\n[Sidenote: No Hellene shall be made a slave.]\nThen no Hellene should be owned by them as a slave; that is a rule which\nthey will observe and advise the other Hellenes to observe.\nCertainly, he said; they will in this way be united against the barbarians\nand will keep their hands off one another.\nNext as to the slain; ought the conquerors, I said, to take anything but\ntheir armour? Does not the practice of *469D* despoiling an enemy afford\nan excuse for not facing the battle? Cowards skulk about the dead,\npretending that they are fulfilling a duty, and many an army before now\nhas been lost from this love of plunder.\nVery true.\n[Sidenote: Those who fall in battle are not to be despoiled.]\nAnd is there not illiberality and avarice in robbing a corpse, and also a\ndegree of meanness and womanishness in making an enemy of the dead body\nwhen the real enemy has flown away and left only his fighting gear behind\nhim,--is not this *469E* rather like a dog who cannot get at his\nassailant, quarrelling with the stones which strike him instead?\nVery like a dog, he said.\nThen we must abstain from spoiling the dead or hindering their burial?\nYes, he replied, we most certainly must.\n[Sidenote: The arms of Hellenes are not to be offered at temples;]\nNeither shall we offer up arms at the temples of the gods, *470A* least of\nall the arms of Hellenes, if we care to maintain good feeling with other\nHellenes; and, indeed, we have reason to fear that the offering of spoils\ntaken from kinsmen may be a pollution unless commanded by the god himself?\nVery true.\nAgain, as to the devastation of Hellenic territory or the burning of\nhouses, what is to be the practice?\nMay I have the pleasure, he said, of hearing your opinion?\nBoth should be forbidden, in my judgment; I would take *470B* the annual\nproduce and no more. Shall I tell you why?\nPray do.\n[Sidenote: nor Hellenic territory devastated.]\nWhy, you see, there is a difference in the names 'discord' and 'war,' and\nI imagine that there is also a difference in their natures; the one is\nexpressive of what is internal and domestic, the other of what is external\nand foreign; and the first of the two is termed discord, and only the\nsecond, war. {167}\nThat is a very proper distinction, he replied.\n*470C* And may I not observe with equal propriety that the Hellenic race\nis all united together by ties of blood and friendship, and alien and\nstrange to the barbarians?\nVery good, he said.\n[Sidenote: Hellenic warfare is only a kind of discord not intended to be\nlasting.]\nAnd therefore when Hellenes fight with barbarians and barbarians with\nHellenes, they will be described by us as being at war when they fight,\nand by nature enemies, and this kind of antagonism should be called war;\nbut when Hellenes fight with one another we shall say that Hellas is then\nin a state of disorder and discord, they being by nature friends; *470D*\nand such enmity is to be called discord.\nI agree.\nConsider then, I said, when that which we have acknowledged to be discord\noccurs, and a city is divided, if both parties destroy the lands and burn\nthe houses of one another, how wicked does the strife appear! No true\nlover of his country would bring himself to tear in pieces his own nurse\nand mother: There might be reason in the conqueror depriving the conquered\nof their harvest, but still they would *470E* have the idea of peace in\ntheir hearts and would not mean to go on fighting for ever.\nYes, he said, that is a better temper than the other.\nAnd will not the city, which you are founding, be an Hellenic city?\nIt ought to be, he replied.\nThen will not the citizens be good and civilized?\nYes, very civilized.\n[Sidenote: The lover of his own city will also be a lover of Hellas.]\nAnd will they not be lovers of Hellas, and think of Hellas as their own\nland, and share in the common temples?\nMost certainly.\nAnd any difference which arises among them will be *471A* regarded by them\nas discord only--a quarrel among friends, which is not to be called a war?\nCertainly not.\nThen they will quarrel as those who intend some day to be reconciled?\nCertainly.\nThey will use friendly correction, but will not enslave or destroy their\nopponents; they will be correctors, not enemies? {168}\nJust so.\n[Sidenote: Hellenes should deal mildly with Hellenes; and with barbarians\nas Hellenes now deal with one another.]\nAnd as they are Hellenes themselves they will not devastate Hellas, nor\nwill they burn houses, nor ever suppose that the whole population of a\ncity--men, women, and children--are equally their enemies, for they know\nthat the guilt of war is always confined to a few persons and that the\nmany are their friends. *471B* And for all these reasons they will be\nunwilling to waste their lands and rase their houses; their enmity to them\nwill only last until the many innocent sufferers have compelled the guilty\nfew to give satisfaction?\nI agree, he said, that our citizens should thus deal with their Hellenic\nenemies; and with barbarians as the Hellenes now deal with one another.\nThen let us enact this law also for our guardians:--that they are neither\nto devastate the lands of Hellenes nor to *471C* burn their houses.\nAgreed; and we may agree also in thinking that these, like all our\nprevious enactments, are very good.\n[Sidenote: The complaint of Glaucon respecting the hesitation of\nSocrates.]\nBut still I must say, Socrates, that if you are allowed to go on in this\nway you will entirely forget the other question which at the commencement\nof this discussion you thrust aside:--Is such an order of things possible,\nand how, if at all? For I am quite ready to acknowledge that the plan\nwhich you propose, if only feasible, would do all sorts of good to the\nState. I will add, what you have omitted, that your *471D* citizens will\nbe the bravest of warriors, and will never leave their ranks, for they\nwill all know one another, and each will call the other father, brother,\nson; and if you suppose the women to join their armies, whether in the\nsame rank or in the rear, either as a terror to the enemy, or as\nauxiliaries in case of need, I know that they will then be absolutely\ninvincible; and there are many domestic advantages which might also be\nmentioned and which I also fully acknowledge: *471E* but, as I admit all\nthese advantages and as many more as you please, if only this State of\nyours were to come into existence, we need say no more about them;\nassuming then the existence of the State, let us now turn to the question\nof possibility and ways and means--the rest may be left. {169}\n[Sidenote: Socrates excuses himself and makes one or two remarks\npreparatory to a final effort.]\n*472A* If I loiter[10] for a moment, you instantly make a raid upon me,\nI said, and have no mercy; I have hardly escaped the first and second\nwaves, and you seem not to be aware that you are now bringing upon me the\nthird, which is the greatest and heaviest. When you have seen and heard the\nthird wave, I think you will be more considerate and will acknowledge that\nsome fear and hesitation was natural respecting a proposal so extraordinary\nas that which I have now to state and investigate.\n[Footnote 10: Reading [Greek: straggeuome/n\u00f4|].]\nThe more appeals of this sort which you make, he said, the *472B* more\ndetermined are we that you shall tell us how such a State is possible:\nspeak out and at once.\nLet me begin by reminding you that we found our way hither in the search\nafter justice and injustice.\nTrue, he replied; but what of that?\nI was only going to ask whether, if we have discovered them, we are to\nrequire that the just man should in nothing fail of absolute justice; or\nmay we be satisfied with an approximation, *472C* and the attainment in\nhim of a higher degree of justice than is to be found in other men?\nThe approximation will be enough.\n[Sidenote: (1) The ideal is a standard only which can never be perfectly\nrealized;]\nWe were enquiring into the nature of absolute justice and into the\ncharacter of the perfectly just, and into injustice and the perfectly\nunjust, that we might have an ideal. We were to look at these in order\nthat we might judge of our own happiness and unhappiness according to the\nstandard *472D* which they exhibited and the degree in which we resembled\nthem, but not with any view of showing that they could exist in fact.\nTrue, he said.\nWould a painter be any the worse because, after having delineated with\nconsummate art an ideal of a perfectly beautiful man, he was unable to\nshow that any such man could ever have existed?\nHe would be none the worse.\n*472E* Well, and were we not creating an ideal of a perfect State?\nTo be sure.\n[Sidenote: (2) but is none the worse for this.]\nAnd is our theory a worse theory because we are unable to {170} prove the\npossibility of a city being ordered in the manner described?\nSurely not, he replied.\nThat is the truth, I said. But if, at your request, I am to try and show\nhow and under what conditions the possibility is highest, I must ask you,\nhaving this in view, to repeat your former admissions.\nWhat admissions?\n*473A* I want to know whether ideals are ever fully realized in language?\nDoes not the word express more than the fact, and must not the actual,\nwhatever a man may think, always, in the nature of things, fall short of\nthe truth? What do you say?\nI agree.\nThen you must not insist on my proving that the actual State will in every\nrespect coincide with the ideal: if we are only able to discover how a\ncity may be governed nearly as we proposed, you will admit that we have\ndiscovered the possibility which you demand; and will be contented. *473B*\nI am sure that I should be contented--will not you?\nYes, I will.\n[Sidenote: (3) Although the ideal cannot be realized, one or two changes,\nor rather a single change, might revolutionize a State.]\nLet me next endeavour to show what is that fault in States which is the\ncause of their present maladministration, and what is the least change\nwhich will enable a State to pass into the truer form; and let the change,\nif possible, be of one thing only, or, if not, of two; at any rate, let\nthe changes be as few and slight as possible.\n*473C* Certainly, he replied.\nI think, I said, that there might be a reform of the State if only one\nchange were made, which is not a slight or easy though still a possible\none.\nWhat is it? he said.\n[Sidenote: Socrates goes forth to meet the wave.]\nNow then, I said, I go to meet that which I liken to the greatest of the\nwaves; yet shall the word be spoken, even though the wave break and drown\nme in laughter and dishonour; and do you mark my words.\nProceed.\n[Sidenote: 'Cities will never cease from ill until they are governed by\nphilosophers.']\nI said: _Until philosophers are kings, or the kings and princes of this\nworld have the spirit and power of philosophy, and *473D* political\ngreatness and wisdom meet in one, and those {171} commoner natures who\npursue either to the exclusion of the other are compelled to stand aside,\ncities will never have rest from their evils,--nor the human race, as\nI believe,--and then only will this *473E* our State have a possibility of\nlife and behold the light of day._ Such was the thought, my dear Glaucon,\nwhich I would fain have uttered if it had not seemed too extravagant; for\nto be convinced that in no other State can there be happiness private or\npublic is indeed a hard thing.\n[Sidenote: What will the world say to this?]\nSocrates, what do you mean? I would have you consider that the word which\nyou have uttered is one at which numerous persons, and very respectable\npersons too, in *474A* a figure pulling off their coats all in a moment,\nand seizing any weapon that comes to hand, will run at you might and main,\nbefore you know where you are, intending to do heaven knows what; and if\nyou don't prepare an answer, and put yourself in motion, you will be\n'pared by their fine wits,' and no mistake.\nYou got me into the scrape, I said.\nAnd I was quite right; however, I will do all I can to get you out of it;\nbut I can only give you good-will and good advice, and, perhaps, I may be\nable to fit answers to your questions better than another--that is all.\nAnd now, having *474B* such an auxiliary, you must do your best to show\nthe unbelievers that you are right.\n[Sidenote: But who is a philosopher?]\nI ought to try, I said, since you offer me such invaluable assistance. And\nI think that, if there is to be a chance of our escaping, we must explain\nto them whom we mean when we say that philosophers are to rule in the\nState; then we shall be able to defend ourselves: There will be discovered\nto be some natures who ought to study philosophy and to be *474C* leaders\nin the State; and others who are not born to be philosophers, and are\nmeant to be followers rather than leaders.\nThen now for a definition, he said.\nFollow me, I said, and I hope that I may in some way or other be able to\ngive you a satisfactory explanation.\nProceed.\n[Sidenote: Parallel of the lover.]\nI dare say that you remember, and therefore I need not remind you, that a\nlover, if he is worthy of the name, ought to show his love, not to some\none part of that which he loves, but to the whole. {172}\n*474D* I really do not understand, and therefore beg of you to assist my\nmemory.\n[Sidenote: The lover of the fair loves them all;]\nAnother person, I said, might fairly reply as you do; but a man of\npleasure like yourself ought to know that all who are in the flower of\nyouth do somehow or other raise a pang or emotion in a lover's breast, and\nare thought by him to be worthy of his affectionate regards. Is not this a\nway which you have with the fair: one has a snub nose, and you praise his\ncharming face; the hook-nose of another has, you say, a royal look; while\nhe who is neither snub nor hooked has *474E* the grace of regularity: the\ndark visage is manly, the fair are children of the gods; and as to the\nsweet 'honey pale,' as they are called, what is the very name but the\ninvention of a lover who talks in diminutives, and is not averse to\npaleness if appearing on the cheek of youth? In a word, there is no *475A*\nexcuse which you will not make, and nothing which you will not say, in\norder not to lose a single flower that blooms in the spring-time of youth.\nIf you make me an authority in matters of love, for the sake of the\nargument, I assent.\n[Sidenote: the lover of wines all wines;]\nAnd what do you say of lovers of wine? Do you not see them doing the same?\nThey are glad of any pretext of drinking any wine.\nVery good.\n[Sidenote: the lover of honour all honour;]\nAnd the same is true of ambitious men; if they cannot command an army,\nthey are willing to command a file; and *475B* if they cannot be honoured\nby really great and important persons, they are glad to be honoured by\nlesser and meaner people,--but honour of some kind they must have.\nExactly.\nOnce more let me ask: Does he who desires any class of goods, desire the\nwhole class or a part only?\nThe whole.\n[Sidenote: the philosopher, or lover of wisdom, all knowledge.]\nAnd may we not say of the philosopher that he is a lover, not of a part of\nwisdom only, but of the whole?\nYes, of the whole.\nAnd he who dislikes learning, especially in youth, when *475C* he has no\npower of judging what is good and what is not, such an one we maintain not\nto be a philosopher or a lover of knowledge, just as he who refuses his\nfood is not hungry, {173} and may be said to have a bad appetite and not a\ngood one?\nVery true, he said.\nWhereas he who has a taste for every sort of knowledge and who is curious\nto learn and is never satisfied, may be justly termed a philosopher?\nAm I not right?\n[Sidenote: Under knowledge, however, are not to be included sights and\nsounds, or under the lovers of knowledge, musical amateurs and the like.]\n*475D* Glaucon said: If curiosity makes a philosopher, you will find many\na strange being will have a title to the name. All the lovers of sights\nhave a delight in learning, and must therefore be included. Musical\namateurs, too, are a folk strangely out of place among philosophers, for\nthey are the last persons in the world who would come to anything like a\nphilosophical discussion, if they could help, while they run about at the\nDionysiac festivals as if they had let out their ears to hear every\nchorus; whether the performance is in town or country--that makes no\ndifference--they are there. Now are we *475E* to maintain that all these\nand any who have similar tastes, as well as the professors of quite minor\narts, are philosophers?\nCertainly not, I replied; they are only an imitation.\nHe said: Who then are the true philosophers?\nThose, I said, who are lovers of the vision of truth.\nThat is also good, he said; but I should like to know what you mean?\nTo another, I replied, I might have a difficulty in explaining; but I am\nsure that you will admit a proposition which I am about to make.\nWhat is the proposition?\nThat since beauty is the opposite of ugliness, they are two?\nCertainly.\n*476A* And inasmuch as they are two, each of them is one?\nTrue again.\nAnd of just and unjust, good and evil, and of every other class, the same\nremark holds: taken singly, each of them is one; but from the various\ncombinations of them with actions and things and with one another, they\nare seen in all sorts of lights and appear many?\nVery true.\nAnd this is the distinction which I draw between the sight- {174} loving,\nart-loving, practical class and those of whom I am speaking, *476B* and\nwho are alone worthy of the name of philosophers.\nHow do you distinguish them? he said.\nThe lovers of sounds and sights, I replied, are, as I conceive, fond of\nfine tones and colours and forms and all the artificial products that are\nmade out of them, but their mind is incapable of seeing or loving absolute\nbeauty.\nTrue, he replied.\nFew are they who are able to attain to the sight of this.\n*476C* Very true.\nAnd he who, having a sense of beautiful things has no sense of absolute\nbeauty, or who, if another lead him to a knowledge of that beauty is\nunable to follow--of such an one I ask, Is he awake or in a dream only?\nReflect: is not the dreamer, sleeping or waking, one who likens dissimilar\nthings, who puts the copy in the place of the real object?\nI should certainly say that such an one was dreaming.\n[Sidenote: True knowledge is the ability to distinguish between the one\nand many, between the idea and the objects which partake of the idea.]\nBut take the case of the other, who recognises the existence *476D* of\nabsolute beauty and is able to distinguish the idea from the objects which\nparticipate in the idea, neither putting the objects in the place of the\nidea nor the idea in the place of the objects--is he a dreamer, or is he\nawake?\nHe is wide awake.\nAnd may we not say that the mind of the one who knows has knowledge, and\nthat the mind of the other, who opines only, has opinion?\nCertainly.\nBut suppose that the latter should quarrel with us and dispute our\nstatement, can we administer any soothing *476E* cordial or advice to him,\nwithout revealing to him that there is sad disorder in his wits?\nWe must certainly offer him some good advice, he replied.\nCome, then, and let us think of something to say to him. Shall we begin by\nassuring him that he is welcome to any knowledge which he may have, and\nthat we are rejoiced at his having it? But we should like to ask him a\nquestion: Does he who has knowledge know something or nothing? (You must\nanswer for him.)\nI answer that he knows something. {175}\nSomething that is or is not?\nSomething that is; for how can that which is not ever be known?\n[Sidenote: There is an intermediate between being and not being, and a\ncorresponding intermediate between ignorance and knowledge. This\nintermediate is a faculty termed opinion.]\n*477A* And are we assured, after looking at the matter from many points of\nview, that absolute being is or may be absolutely known, but that the\nutterly non-existent is utterly unknown?\nNothing can be more certain.\nGood. But if there be anything which is of such a nature as to be and not\nto be, that will have a place intermediate between pure being and the\nabsolute negation of being?\nYes, between them.\nAnd, as knowledge corresponded to being and ignorance of necessity to\nnot-being, for that intermediate between being and not-being there has to\nbe discovered a corresponding *477B* intermediate between ignorance and\nknowledge, if there be such?\nCertainly.\nDo we admit the existence of opinion?\nUndoubtedly.\nAs being the same with knowledge, or another faculty?\nAnother faculty.\nThen opinion and knowledge have to do with different kinds of matter\ncorresponding to this difference of faculties?\nYes.\nAnd knowledge is relative to being and knows being. But before I proceed\nfurther I will make a division.\nWhat division?\n*477C* I will begin by placing faculties in a class by themselves: they\nare powers in us, and in all other things, by which we do as we do. Sight\nand hearing, for example, I should call faculties. Have I clearly\nexplained the class which I mean?\nYes, I quite understand.\nThen let me tell you my view about them. I do not see them, and therefore\nthe distinctions of figure, colour, and the like, which enable me to\ndiscern the differences of some things, do not apply to them. In speaking\nof a faculty I think *477D* only of its sphere and its result; and that\nwhich has the same sphere and the same result I call the same faculty, but\nthat which has another sphere and another result I call different. Would\nthat be your way of speaking? {176}\nYes.\nAnd will you be so very good as to answer one more question? Would you say\nthat knowledge is a faculty, or in what class would you place it?\nCertainly knowledge is a faculty, and the mightiest of all faculties.\n*477E* And is opinion also a faculty?\nCertainly, he said; for opinion is that with which we are able to form an\nopinion.\nAnd yet you were acknowledging a little while ago that knowledge is not\nthe same as opinion?\n[Sidenote: Opinion differs from knowledge because the one errs and the\nother is unerring.]\nWhy, yes, he said: how can any reasonable being ever identify that which\nis infallible with that which errs?\n*478A* An excellent answer, proving, I said, that we are quite conscious\nof a distinction between them.\nYes.\nThen knowledge and opinion having distinct powers have also distinct\nspheres or subject-matters?\nThat is certain.\nBeing is the sphere or subject-matter of knowledge, and knowledge is to\nknow the nature of being?\nYes.\nAnd opinion is to have an opinion?\nYes.\nAnd do we know what we opine? or is the subject-matter of opinion the same\nas the subject-matter of knowledge?\nNay, he replied, that has been already disproven; if difference in faculty\nimplies difference in the sphere or *478B* subject-matter, and if, as we\nwere saying, opinion and knowledge are distinct faculties, then the sphere\nof knowledge and of opinion cannot be the same.\nThen if being is the subject-matter of knowledge, something else must be\nthe subject-matter of opinion?\nYes, something else.\n[Sidenote: It also differs from ignorance, which is concerned with\nnothing.]\nWell then, is not-being the subject-matter of opinion? or, rather, how can\nthere be an opinion at all about not-being? Reflect: when a man has an\nopinion, has he not an opinion about something? Can he have an opinion\nwhich is an opinion about nothing?\nImpossible. {177}\nHe who has an opinion has an opinion about some one thing?\nYes.\nAnd not-being is not one thing but, properly speaking, *478C* nothing?\nTrue.\nOf not-being, ignorance was assumed to be the necessary correlative; of\nbeing, knowledge?\nTrue, he said.\nThen opinion is not concerned either with being or with not-being?\nNot with either.\nAnd can therefore neither be ignorance nor knowledge?\nThat seems to be true.\n[Sidenote: Its place is not to be sought without or beyond knowledge or\nignorance, but between them.]\nBut is opinion to be sought without and beyond either of them, in a\ngreater clearness than knowledge, or in a greater darkness than ignorance?\nIn neither.\nThen I suppose that opinion appears to you to be darker than knowledge,\nbut lighter than ignorance?\nBoth; and in no small degree.\n*478D* And also to be within and between them?\nYes.\nThen you would infer that opinion is intermediate?\nNo question.\nBut were we not saying before, that if anything appeared to be of a sort\nwhich is and is not at the same time, that sort of thing would appear also\nto lie in the interval between pure being and absolute not-being; and that\nthe corresponding faculty is neither knowledge nor ignorance, but will be\nfound in the interval between them?\nTrue.\nAnd in that interval there has now been discovered something which we call\nopinion?\nThere has.\n*478E* Then what remains to be discovered is the object which partakes\nequally of the nature of being and not-being, and cannot rightly be termed\neither, pure and simple; this unknown term, when discovered, we may truly\ncall the subject of opinion, and assign each to their proper faculty,--\n{178} the extremes to the faculties of the extremes and the mean to the\nfaculty of the mean.\nTrue.\n[Sidenote: The absoluteness of the one and the relativeness of the many.]\n*479A* This being premised, I would ask the gentleman who is of opinion\nthat there is no absolute or unchangeable idea of beauty--in whose opinion\nthe beautiful is the manifold--he, I say, your lover of beautiful sights,\nwho cannot bear to be told that the beautiful is one, and the just is one,\nor that anything is one--to him I would appeal, saying, Will you be so\nvery kind, sir, as to tell us whether, of all these beautiful things,\nthere is one which will not be found ugly; or of the just, which will not\nbe found unjust; or of the holy, which will not also be unholy?\n*479B* No, he replied; the beautiful will in some point of view be found\nugly; and the same is true of the rest.\nAnd may not the many which are doubles be also halves?--doubles, that is,\nof one thing, and halves of another?\nQuite true.\nAnd things great and small, heavy and light, as they are termed, will not\nbe denoted by these any more than by the opposite names?\nTrue; both these and the opposite names will always attach to all of them.\nAnd can any one of those many things which are called by particular names\nbe said to be this rather than not to be this?\nHe replied: They are like the punning riddles which are *479C* asked at\nfeasts or the children's puzzle about the eunuch aiming at the bat, with\nwhat he hit him, as they say in the puzzle, and upon what the bat was\nsitting. The individual objects of which I am speaking are also a riddle,\nand have a double sense: nor can you fix them in your mind, either as\nbeing or not-being, or both, or neither.\nThen what will you do with them? I said. Can they have a better place than\nbetween being and not-being? For they are clearly not in greater darkness\nor negation than not-being, *479D* or more full of light and existence\nthan being.\nThat is quite true, he said.\nThus then we seem to have discovered that the many ideas which the\nmultitude entertain about the beautiful and about {179} all other things\nare tossing about in some region which is half-way between pure being and\npure not-being?\nWe have.\nYes; and we had before agreed that anything of this kind which we might\nfind was to be described as matter of opinion, and not as matter of\nknowledge; being the intermediate flux which is caught and detained by the\nintermediate faculty.\nQuite true.\n[Sidenote: Opinion is the knowledge, not of the absolute, but of the\nmany.]\n*479E* Then those who see the many beautiful, and who yet neither see\nabsolute beauty, nor can follow any guide who points the way thither; who\nsee the many just, and not absolute justice, and the like,--such persons\nmay be said to have opinion but not knowledge?\nThat is certain.\nBut those who see the absolute and eternal and immutable may be said to\nknow, and not to have opinion only?\nNeither can that be denied.\nThe one love and embrace the subjects of knowledge, the other those of\nopinion? The latter are the same, as I dare say *480A* you will remember,\nwho listened to sweet sounds and gazed upon fair colours, but would not\ntolerate the existence of absolute beauty.\nYes, I remember.\nShall we then be guilty of any impropriety in calling them lovers of\nopinion rather than lovers of wisdom, and will they be very angry with us\nfor thus describing them?\nI shall tell them not to be angry; no man should be angry at what is true.\nBut those who love the truth in each thing are to be called lovers of\nwisdom and not lovers of opinion.\nAssuredly.\nBOOK VI.\n[Sidenote: _Republic VI._ Socrates, Glaucon.]\n*484A* And thus, Glaucon, after the argument has gone a weary way, the\ntrue and the false philosophers have at length appeared in view.\nI do not think, he said, that the way could have been shortened.\n[Sidenote: If we had time, we might have a nearer view of the true and\nfalse philosopher.]\nI suppose not, I said; and yet I believe that we might have had a better\nview of both of them if the discussion could have been confined to this\none subject and if there were not many other questions awaiting us, which\nhe who desires to see in what respect the life of the just differs from\n*484B* that of the unjust must consider.\nAnd what is the next question? he asked.\nSurely, I said, the one which follows next in order. Inasmuch as\nphilosophers only are able to grasp the eternal and unchangeable, and\nthose who wander in the region of the many and variable are not\nphilosophers, I must ask you which of the two classes should be the rulers\nof our State?\nAnd how can we rightly answer that question?\n[Sidenote: Which of them shall be our guardians?]\nWhichever of the two are best able to guard the laws and *484C*\ninstitutions of our State--let them be our guardians.\nVery good.\n[Sidenote: A question hardly to be asked.]\nNeither, I said, can there be any question that the guardian who is to\nkeep anything should have eyes rather than no eyes?\nThere can be no question of that.\nAnd are not those who are verily and indeed wanting in the knowledge of\nthe true being of each thing, and who have in their souls no clear\npattern, and are unable as with a painter's eye to look at the absolute\ntruth and to that original *484D* to repair, and having perfect vision of\nthe other world to order the laws about beauty, goodness, justice in this,\nif not {181} already ordered, and to guard and preserve the order of\nthem--are not such persons, I ask, simply blind?\nTruly, he replied, they are much in that condition.\nAnd shall they be our guardians when there are others who, besides being\ntheir equals in experience and falling short of them in no particular of\nvirtue, also know the very truth of each thing?\nThere can be no reason, he said, for rejecting those who have this\ngreatest of all great qualities; they must always have the first place\nunless they fail in some other respect.\n*485A* Suppose then, I said, that we determine how far they can unite this\nand the other excellences.\nBy all means.\n[Sidenote: The philosopher is a lover of truth and of all true being.]\nIn the first place, as we began by observing, the nature of the\nphilosopher has to be ascertained. We must come to an understanding about\nhim, and, when we have done so, then, if I am not mistaken, we shall also\nacknowledge that such an union of qualities is possible, and that those in\nwhom they are united, and those only, should be rulers in the State.\nWhat do you mean?\nLet us suppose that philosophical minds always love knowledge *485B* of a\nsort which shows them the eternal nature not varying from generation and\ncorruption.\nAgreed.\nAnd further, I said, let us agree that they are lovers of all true being;\nthere is no part whether greater or less, or more or less honourable,\nwhich they are willing to renounce; as we said before of the lover and the\nman of ambition.\nTrue.\nAnd if they are to be what we were describing, is there *485C* not another\nquality which they should also possess?\nWhat quality?\nTruthfulness: they will never intentionally receive into their mind\nfalsehood, which is their detestation, and they will love the truth.\nYes, that may be safely affirmed of them.\n'May be,' my friend, I replied, is not the word; say rather 'must be\naffirmed:' for he whose nature is amorous of anything cannot help loving\nall that belongs or is akin to the object of his affections. {182}\nRight, he said.\nAnd is there anything more akin to wisdom than truth?\nHow can there be?\nCan the same nature be a lover of wisdom and a lover of *485D* falsehood?\nNever.\nThe true lover of learning then must from his earliest youth, as far as in\nhim lies, desire all truth?\nAssuredly.\nBut then again, as we know by experience, he whose desires are strong in\none direction will have them weaker in others; they will be like a stream\nwhich has been drawn off into another channel.\nTrue.\n[Sidenote: He will be absorbed in the pleasures of the soul, and therefore\ntemperate and the reverse of covetous or mean.]\nHe whose desires are drawn towards knowledge in every form will be\nabsorbed in the pleasures of the soul, and will hardly feel bodily\npleasure--I mean, if he be a true philosopher and not a sham one.\n*485E* That is most certain.\nSuch an one is sure to be temperate and the reverse of covetous; for the\nmotives which make another man desirous of having and spending, have no\nplace in his character.\nVery true.\n*486A* Another criterion of the philosophical nature has also to be\nconsidered.\nWhat is that?\nThere should be no secret corner of illiberality; nothing can be more\nantagonistic than meanness to a soul which is ever longing after the whole\nof things both divine and human.\nMost true, he replied.\n[Sidenote: In the magnificence of his contemplations he will not think\nmuch of human life.]\nThen how can he who has magnificence of mind and is the spectator of all\ntime and all existence, think much of human life?\nHe cannot.\n*486B* Or can such an one account death fearful?\nNo indeed.\nThen the cowardly and mean nature has no part in true philosophy? {183}\nCertainly not.\nOr again: can he who is harmoniously constituted, who is not covetous or\nmean, or a boaster, or a coward--can he, I say, ever be unjust or hard in\nhis dealings?\nImpossible.\n[Sidenote: He will be of a gentle, sociable, harmonious nature; a lover of\nlearning, having a good memory and moving spontaneously in the world of\nbeing.]\nThen you will soon observe whether a man is just and gentle, or rude and\nunsociable; these are the signs which distinguish even in youth the\nphilosophical nature from the unphilosophical.\nTrue.\n*486C* There is another point which should be remarked.\nWhat point?\nWhether he has or has not a pleasure in learning; for no one will love\nthat which gives him pain, and in which after much toil he makes little\nprogress.\nCertainly not.\nAnd again, if he is forgetful and retains nothing of what he learns, will\nhe not be an empty vessel?\nThat is certain.\nLabouring in vain, he must end in hating himself and his fruitless\noccupation? Yes.\n*486D* Then a soul which forgets cannot be ranked among genuine\nphilosophic natures; we must insist that the philosopher should have a\ngood memory?\nCertainly.\nAnd once more, the inharmonious and unseemly nature can only tend to\ndisproportion?\nUndoubtedly.\nAnd do you consider truth to be akin to proportion or to disproportion?\nTo proportion.\nThen, besides other qualities, we must try to find a naturally\nwell-proportioned and gracious mind, which will move spontaneously towards\nthe true being of everything.\nCertainly.\n*486E* Well, and do not all these qualities, which we have been\nenumerating, go together, and are they not, in a manner, necessary to a\nsoul, which is to have a full and perfect participation of being? {184}\n*487A* They are absolutely necessary, he replied.\n[Sidenote: Conclusion: What a blameless study then is philosophy!]\nAnd must not that be a blameless study which he only can pursue who has\nthe gift of a good memory, and is quick to learn,--noble, gracious, the\nfriend of truth, justice, courage, temperance, who are his kindred?\nThe god of jealousy himself, he said, could find no fault with such a\nstudy.\nAnd to men like him, I said, when perfected by years and education, and to\nthese only you will entrust the State.\n[Sidenote: Socrates, Adeimantus.]\n[Sidenote: Nay, says Adeimantus, you can prove anything, but your hearers\nare unconvinced all the same.]\n[Sidenote: Common opinion declares philosophers to be either rogues or\nuseless.]\n*487B* Here Adeimantus interposed and said: To these statements, Socrates,\nno one can offer a reply; but when you talk in this way, a strange feeling\npasses over the minds of your hearers: They fancy that they are led astray\na little at each step in the argument, owing to their own want of skill in\nasking and answering questions; these littles accumulate, and at the end\nof the discussion they are found to have sustained a mighty overthrow and\nall their former notions appear to be turned upside down. And as unskilful\nplayers of draughts are at last shut up by their more skilful adversaries\n*487C* and have no piece to move, so they too find themselves shut up at\nlast; for they have nothing to say in this new game of which words are the\ncounters; and yet all the time they are in the right. The observation is\nsuggested to me by what is now occurring. For any one of us might say,\nthat although in words he is not able to meet you at each step of the\nargument, he sees as a fact that the votaries of philosophy, when they\ncarry on the study, not only in youth as a part of *487D* education, but\nas the pursuit of their maturer years, most of them become strange\nmonsters, not to say utter rogues, and that those who may be considered\nthe best of them are made useless to the world by the very study which you\nextol.\nWell, and do you think that those who say so are wrong?\nI cannot tell, he replied; but I should like to know what is your opinion.\n[Sidenote: Socrates, instead of denying this statement, admits the truth\nof it.]\nHear my answer; I am of opinion that they are quite right.\n*487E* Then how can you be justified in saying that cities will not cease\nfrom evil until philosophers rule in them, when philosophers are\nacknowledged by us to be of no use to them?\nYou ask a question, I said, to which a reply can only be given in a\nparable. {185}\nYes, Socrates; and that is a way of speaking to which you are not at all\naccustomed, I suppose.\n[Sidenote: A parable.]\n[Sidenote: The noble captain whose senses are rather dull (the people in\ntheir better mind); the mutinous crew (the mob of politicians); and the\npilot (the true philosopher).]\nI perceive, I said, that you are vastly amused at having plunged me into\nsuch a hopeless discussion; but now hear *488A* the parable, and then you\nwill be still more amused at the meagreness of my imagination: for the\nmanner in which the best men are treated in their own States is so\ngrievous that no single thing on earth is comparable to it; and therefore,\nif I am to plead their cause, I must have recourse to fiction, and put\ntogether a figure made up of many things, like the fabulous unions of\ngoats and stags which are found in pictures. Imagine then a fleet or a\nship in which there is *488B* a captain who is taller and stronger than\nany of the crew, but he is a little deaf and has a similar infirmity in\nsight, and his knowledge of navigation is not much better. The sailors are\nquarrelling with one another about the steering--every one is of opinion\nthat he has a right to steer, though he has never learned the art of\nnavigation and cannot tell who taught him or when he learned, and will\nfurther assert that it cannot be taught, and they are ready to cut in\npieces any *488C* one who says the contrary. They throng about the\ncaptain, begging and praying him to commit the helm to them; and if at any\ntime they do not prevail, but others are preferred to them, they kill the\nothers or throw them overboard, and having first chained up the noble\ncaptain's senses with drink or some narcotic drug, they mutiny and take\npossession of the ship and make free with the stores; thus, eating and\ndrinking, they proceed on their voyage in such manner as *488D* might be\nexpected of them. Him who is their partisan and cleverly aids them in\ntheir plot for getting the ship out of the captain's hands into their own\nwhether by force or persuasion, they compliment with the name of sailor,\npilot, able seaman, and abuse the other sort of man, whom they call a\ngood-for-nothing; but that the true pilot must pay attention to the year\nand seasons and sky and stars and winds, and whatever else belongs to his\nart, if he intends to be really qualified for the command of a ship, and\nthat he must and *488E* will be the steerer, whether other people like or\nnot--the possibility of this union of authority with the steerer's art has\nnever seriously entered into their thoughts or been made *489A* part {186}\nof their calling[1]. Now in vessels which are in a state of mutiny and by\nsailors who are mutineers, how will the true pilot be regarded? Will he\nnot be called by them a prater, a star-gazer, a good-for-nothing?\n[Footnote 1: Or, applying [Greek: o(/p\u00f4s de\\ kubern\u00ea/sei] to the\nmutineers, 'But only understanding ([Greek: e)pai+/ontas]) that he (the\nmutinous pilot) must rule in spite of other people, never considering that\nthere is an art of command which may be practised in combination with the\npilot's art.']\nOf course, said Adeimantus.\n[Sidenote: The interpretation.]\nThen you will hardly need, I said, to hear the interpretation of the\nfigure, which describes the true philosopher in his relation to the State;\nfor you understand already.\nCertainly.\nThen suppose you now take this parable to the gentleman who is surprised\nat finding that philosophers have no honour in their cities; explain it to\nhim and try to convince him that *489B* their having honour would be far\nmore extraordinary.\nI will.\n[Sidenote: The uselessness of philosophers arises out of the unwillingness\nof mankind to make use of them.]\nSay to him, that, in deeming the best votaries of philosophy to be useless\nto the rest of the world, he is right; but also tell him to attribute\ntheir uselessness to the fault of those who will not use them, and not to\nthemselves. The pilot should not humbly beg the sailors to be commanded by\nhim--that is not the order of nature; neither are 'the wise to go to the\ndoors of the rich'--the ingenious author of this saying told a lie--but\nthe truth is, that, when a man is ill, *489C* whether he be rich or poor,\nto the physician he must go, and he who wants to be governed, to him who\nis able to govern. The ruler who is good for anything ought not to beg his\nsubjects to be ruled by him; although the present governors of mankind are\nof a different stamp; they may be justly compared to the mutinous sailors,\nand the true helmsmen to those who are called by them good-for-nothings\nand star-gazers.\nPrecisely so, he said.\n[Sidenote: The real enemies of philosophy her professing followers.]\nFor these reasons, and among men like these, philosophy, the noblest\npursuit of all, is not likely to be much esteemed *489D* by those of the\nopposite faction; not that the greatest and most lasting injury is done to\nher by her opponents, but by her own professing followers, the same of\nwhom you {187} suppose the accuser to say, that the greater number of them\nare arrant rogues, and the best are useless; in which opinion I agreed.\nYes.\nAnd the reason why the good are useless has now been explained?\nTrue.\n[Sidenote: The corruption of philosophy due to many causes.]\nThen shall we proceed to show that the corruption of the majority is also\nunavoidable, and that this is not to be laid to *489E* the charge of\nphilosophy any more than the other?\nBy all means.\nAnd let us ask and answer in turn, first going back to the *490A*\ndescription of the gentle and noble nature. Truth, as you will remember,\nwas his leader, whom he followed always and in all things; failing in\nthis, he was an impostor, and had no part or lot in true philosophy.\nYes, that was said.\nWell, and is not this one quality, to mention no others, greatly at\nvariance with present notions of him?\nCertainly, he said.\n[Sidenote: But before considering this, let us re-enumerate the qualities\nof the philosopher:]\nAnd have we not a right to say in his defence, that the true lover of\nknowledge is always striving after being--that is his nature; he will not\nrest in the multiplicity of individuals *490B* which is an appearance\nonly, but will go on--the keen edge will not be blunted, nor the force of\nhis desire abate until he have attained the knowledge of the true nature\nof every essence by a sympathetic and kindred power in the soul, and by\nthat power drawing near and mingling and becoming incorporate with very\nbeing, having begotten mind and truth, he will have knowledge and will\nlive and grow truly, and then, and not till then, will he cease from his\ntravail.\nNothing, he said, can be more just than such a description of him.\n[Sidenote: his love of essence, of truth, of justice, besides his other\nvirtues and natural gifts.]\nAnd will the love of a lie be any part of a philosopher's nature? Will he\nnot utterly hate a lie?\n*490C* He will.\nAnd when truth is the captain, we cannot suspect any evil of the band\nwhich he leads?\nImpossible. {188}\nJustice and health of mind will be of the company, and temperance will\nfollow after?\nTrue, he replied.\nNeither is there any reason why I should again set in array the\nphilosopher's virtues, as you will doubtless remember that courage,\nmagnificence, apprehension, memory, were his natural gifts. And you\nobjected that, although no one could *490D* deny what I then said, still,\nif you leave words and look at facts, the persons who are thus described\nare some of them manifestly useless, and the greater number utterly\ndepraved; we were then led to enquire into the grounds of these\naccusations, and have now arrived at the point of asking why are the\nmajority bad, which question of necessity brought us back to the\nexamination and definition of the true philosopher.\n*490E* Exactly.\n[Sidenote: The reasons why philosophical natures so easily deteriorate.]\nAnd we have next to consider the corruptions of the philosophic nature,\nwhy so many are spoiled and so few escape spoiling--I am speaking of those\nwho were said to be *491A* useless but not wicked--and, when we have done\nwith them, we will speak of the imitators of philosophy, what manner of\nmen are they who aspire after a profession which is above them and of\nwhich they are unworthy, and then, by their manifold inconsistencies,\nbring upon philosophy, and upon all philosophers, that universal\nreprobation of which we speak.\nWhat are these corruptions? he said.\n[Sidenote: (1) There are but a few of them;]\nI will see if I can explain them to you. Every one will admit that a\nnature having in perfection all the qualities *491B* which we required in\na philosopher, is a rare plant which is seldom seen among men.\nRare indeed.\nAnd what numberless and powerful causes tend to destroy these rare\nnatures!\nWhat causes?\n[Sidenote: (2) and they may be distracted from philosophy by their own\nvirtues;]\nIn the first place there are their own virtues, their courage, temperance,\nand the rest of them, every one of which praiseworthy qualities (and this\nis a most singular circumstance) destroys and distracts from philosophy\nthe soul which is the possessor of them.\nThat is very singular, he replied. {189}\n[Sidenote: and also, (3), by the ordinary goods of life.]\n*491C* Then there are all the ordinary goods of life--beauty, wealth,\nstrength, rank, and great connections in the State--you understand the\nsort of things--these also have a corrupting and distracting effect.\nI understand; but I should like to know more precisely what you mean about\nthem.\nGrasp the truth as a whole, I said, and in the right way; you will then\nhave no difficulty in apprehending the preceding remarks, and they will no\nlonger appear strange to you.\nAnd how am I to do so? he asked.\n*491D* Why, I said, we know that all germs or seeds, whether vegetable or\nanimal, when they fail to meet with proper nutriment or climate or soil,\nin proportion to their vigour, are all the more sensitive to the want of a\nsuitable environment, for evil is a greater enemy to what is good than to\nwhat is not.\nVery true.\n[Sidenote: (4) The finer natures more liable to injury than the inferior.]\nThere is reason in supposing that the finest natures, when under alien\nconditions, receive more injury than the inferior, because the contrast is\ngreater.\nCertainly.\n*491E* And may we not say, Adeimantus, that the most gifted minds, when\nthey are ill-educated, become pre-eminently bad? Do not great crimes and\nthe spirit of pure evil spring out of a fulness of nature ruined by\neducation rather than from any inferiority, whereas weak natures are\nscarcely capable of any very great good or very great evil?\nThere I think that you are right.\n[Sidenote: (5) They are not corrupted by private sophists, but compelled\nby the opinion of the world meeting in the assembly or in some other place\nof resort.]\n*492A* And our philosopher follows the same analogy--he is like a plant\nwhich, having proper nurture, must necessarily grow and mature into all\nvirtue, but, if sown and planted in an alien soil, becomes the most\nnoxious of all weeds, unless he be preserved by some divine power. Do you\nreally think, as people so often say, that our youth are corrupted by\nSophists, or that private teachers of the art corrupt them in any degree\nworth speaking of? Are not the public who say these things *492B* the\ngreatest of all Sophists? And do they not educate to perfection young and\nold, men and women alike, and fashion them after their own hearts?\nWhen is this accomplished? he said. {190}\nWhen they meet together, and the world sits down at an assembly, or in a\ncourt of law, or a theatre, or a camp, or in any other popular resort, and\nthere is a great uproar, and they praise some things which are being said\nor done, and blame other things, equally exaggerating both, shouting and\n*492C* clapping their hands, and the echo of the rocks and the place in\nwhich they are assembled redoubles the sound of the praise or blame--at\nsuch a time will not a young man's heart, as they say, leap within him?\nWill any private training enable him to stand firm against the\noverwhelming flood of popular opinion? or will he be carried away by the\nstream? Will he not have the notions of good and evil which the public in\ngeneral have--he will do as they do, and as they are, such will he be?\n*492D* Yes, Socrates; necessity will compel him.\n[Sidenote: (6) The other compulsion of violence and death.]\nAnd yet, I said, there is a still greater necessity, which has not been\nmentioned.\nWhat is that?\nThe gentle force of attainder or confiscation or death, which, as you are\naware, these new Sophists and educators, who are the public, apply when\ntheir words are powerless.\nIndeed they do; and in right good earnest.\nNow what opinion of any other Sophist, or of any private person, can be\nexpected to overcome in such an unequal contest?\n*492E* None, he replied.\n[Sidenote: They must be saved, if at all, by the power of God.]\nNo, indeed, I said, even to make the attempt is a great piece of folly;\nthere neither is, nor has been, nor is ever likely to be, any different\ntype of character which has had no other training in virtue but that which\nis supplied by public opinion[2]--I speak, my friend, of human virtue\nonly; what is more than human, as the proverb says, is not included:\nfor I would not have you ignorant that, in the present evil state of\ngovernments, whatever is saved and comes to good is *493A* saved by the\npower of God, as we may truly say.\n[Footnote 2: Or, taking [Greek: para\\] in another sense, 'trained to\nvirtue on their principles.']\nI quite assent, he replied.\nThen let me crave your assent also to a further observation.\nWhat are you going to say?\n[Sidenote: The great brute; his behaviour and temper (the people looked at\nfrom their worse side).]\nWhy, that all those mercenary individuals, whom the many {191} call\nSophists and whom they deem to be their adversaries, do, in fact, teach\nnothing but the opinion of the many, that is to say, the opinions of their\nassemblies; and this is their wisdom. I might compare them to a man who\nshould study the tempers and desires of a mighty strong beast who is fed\n*493B* by him--he would learn how to approach and handle him, also at what\ntimes and from what causes he is dangerous or the reverse, and what is the\nmeaning of his several cries, and by what sounds, when another utters\nthem, he is soothed or infuriated; and you may suppose further, that when,\nby continually attending upon him, he has become perfect in all this, he\ncalls his knowledge wisdom, and makes of it a system or art, which he\nproceeds to teach, although he has no real notion of what he means by the\nprinciples or passions of which he is speaking, but calls this honourable\nand that dishonourable, or good or evil, or just or unjust, all in\naccordance *493C* with the tastes and tempers of the great brute. Good he\npronounces to be that in which the beast delights and evil to be that\nwhich he dislikes; and he can give no other account of them except that\nthe just and noble are the necessary, having never himself seen, and\nhaving no power of explaining to others the nature of either, or the\ndifference between them, which is immense. By heaven, would not such an\none be a rare educator?\nIndeed he would.\n[Sidenote: He who associates with the people will conform to their tastes\nand will produce only what pleases them.]\nAnd in what way does he who thinks that wisdom is *493D* the discernment\nof the tempers and tastes of the motley multitude, whether in painting or\nmusic, or, finally, in politics, differ from him whom I have been\ndescribing? For when a man consorts with the many, and exhibits to them\nhis poem or other work of art or the service which he has done the State,\nmaking them his judges[3] when he is not obliged, the so-called necessity\nof Diomede will oblige him to produce whatever they praise. And yet the\nreasons are utterly ludicrous which they give in confirmation of their own\nnotions about the honourable and good. Did you ever hear any of them which\nwere not?\n[Footnote 3: Putting a comma after [Greek: t\u00f4=n a)nangkai/\u00f4n].]\n*493E* No, nor am I likely to hear.\nYou recognise the truth of what I have been saying? Then {192} let me ask\nyou to consider further whether the world will ever be induced to believe\nin the existence of absolute *494A* beauty rather than of the many\nbeautiful, or of the absolute in each kind rather than of the many in each\nkind?\nCertainly not.\nThen the world cannot possibly be a philosopher?\nImpossible.\nAnd therefore philosophers must inevitably fall under the censure of the\nworld?\nThey must.\nAnd of individuals who consort with the mob and seek to please them?\nThat is evident.\nThen, do you see any way in which the philosopher can *494B* be preserved\nin his calling to the end? and remember what we were saying of him, that\nhe was to have quickness and memory and courage and magnificence--these\nwere admitted by us to be the true philosopher's gifts.\nYes.\n[Sidenote: The youth who has great bodily and mental gifts will be\nflattered from his childhood,]\nWill not such an one from his early childhood be in all things first among\nall, especially if his bodily endowments are like his mental ones?\nCertainly, he said.\nAnd his friends and fellow-citizens will want to use him as he gets older\nfor their own purposes?\nNo question.\n*494C* Falling at his feet, they will make requests to him and do him\nhonour and flatter him, because they want to get into their hands now, the\npower which he will one day possess.\nThat often happens, he said.\nAnd what will a man such as he is be likely to do under such\ncircumstances, especially if he be a citizen of a great city, rich and\nnoble, and a tall proper youth? Will he not be full of boundless\naspirations, and fancy himself able to manage the affairs of Hellenes and\nof barbarians, and having got such *494D* notions into his head will he\nnot dilate and elevate himself in the fulness of vain pomp and senseless\npride?\nTo be sure he will.\n[Sidenote: and being incapable of having reason, will be easily drawn away\nfrom philosophy.]\nNow, when he is in this state of mind, if some one gently comes to him and\ntells him that he is a fool and must get {193} understanding, which can\nonly be got by slaving for it, do you think that, under such adverse\ncircumstances, he will be easily induced to listen?\nFar otherwise.\nAnd even if there be some one who through inherent *494E* goodness or\nnatural reasonableness has had his eyes opened a little and is humbled and\ntaken captive by philosophy, how will his friends behave when they think\nthat they are likely to lose the advantage which they were hoping to reap\nfrom his companionship? Will they not do and say anything to prevent him\nfrom yielding to his better nature and to render his teacher powerless,\nusing to this end private intrigues as well as public prosecutions?\n*495A* There can be no doubt of it.\nAnd how can one who is thus circumstanced ever become a philosopher?\nImpossible.\n[Sidenote: The very qualities which make a man a philosopher may also\ndivert him from philosophy.]\nThen were we not right in saying that even the very qualities which make a\nman a philosopher may, if he be ill-educated, divert him from philosophy,\nno less than riches and their accompaniments and the other so-called goods\nof life?\nWe were quite right.\n[Sidenote: Great natures alone are capable, either of great good, or great\nevil.]\nThus, my excellent friend, is brought about all that ruin and *495B*\nfailure which I have been describing of the natures best adapted to the\nbest of all pursuits; they are natures which we maintain to be rare at any\ntime; this being the class out of which come the men who are the authors\nof the greatest evil to States and individuals; and also of the greatest\ngood when the tide carries them in that direction; but a small man never\nwas the doer of any great thing either to individuals or to States.\nThat is most true, he said.\nAnd so philosophy is left desolate, with her marriage rite *495C*\nincomplete: for her own have fallen away and forsaken her, and while they\nare leading a false and unbecoming life, other unworthy persons, seeing\nthat she has no kinsmen to be her protectors, enter in and dishonour her;\nand fasten upon her the reproaches which, as you say, her reprovers utter,\nwho affirm of her votaries that some are good for nothing, and that the\ngreater number deserve the severest punishment. {194}\nThat is certainly what people say.\n[Sidenote: The attractiveness of philosophy to the vulgar.]\nYes; and what else would you expect, I said, when you think of the puny\ncreatures who, seeing this land open to *495D* them--a land well stocked\nwith fair names and showy titles--like prisoners running out of prison\ninto a sanctuary, take a leap out of their trades into philosophy; those\nwho do so being probably the cleverest hands at their own miserable\ncrafts? For, although philosophy be in this evil case, still there remains\na dignity about her which is not to be found in the arts. And many are\nthus attracted by her whose *495E* natures are imperfect and whose souls\nare maimed and disfigured by their meannesses, as their bodies are by\ntheir trades and crafts. Is not this unavoidable?\nYes.\nAre they not exactly like a bald little tinker who has just got out of\ndurance and come into a fortune; he takes a bath and puts on a new coat,\nand is decked out as a bridegroom going to marry his master's daughter,\nwho is left poor and desolate?\n*496A* A most exact parallel.\nWhat will be the issue of such marriages? Will they not be vile and\nbastard?\nThere can be no question of it.\n[Sidenote: The _m\u00e9salliance_ of philosophy.]\nAnd when persons who are unworthy of education approach philosophy and\nmake an alliance with her who is in a rank above them what sort of ideas\nand opinions are likely to be generated? [4]Will they not be sophisms\ncaptivating to the ear, having nothing in them genuine, or worthy of or\nakin to true wisdom?\n[Footnote 4: Or, 'will they not deserve to be called sophisms,' ....]\nNo doubt, he said.\n[Sidenote: Few are the worthy disciples:]\n[Sidenote: and these are unable to resist the madness of the world;]\n[Sidenote: they therefore in order to escape the storm take shelter behind\na wall and live their own life.]\nThen, Adeimantus, I said, the worthy disciples of philosophy *496B* will\nbe but a small remnant: perchance some noble and well-educated person,\ndetained by exile in her service, who in the absence of corrupting\ninfluences remains devoted to her; or some lofty soul born in a mean city,\nthe politics of which he contemns and neglects; and there may be a gifted\nfew who leave the arts, which they justly despise, and come to her;--or\nperadventure there are some who are restrained *496C* by our friend\nTheages' bridle; for everything in the life of Theages {195} conspired to\ndivert him from philosophy; but ill-health kept him away from politics. My\nown case of the internal sign is hardly worth mentioning, for rarely, if\never, has such a monitor been given to any other man. Those who belong to\nthis small class have tasted how sweet and blessed a possession philosophy\nis, and have also seen enough of the madness of the multitude; and they\nknow *496D* that no politician is honest, nor is there any champion of\njustice at whose side they may fight and be saved. Such an one may be\ncompared to a man who has fallen among wild beasts--he will not join in\nthe wickedness of his fellows, but neither is he able singly to resist all\ntheir fierce natures, and therefore seeing that he would be of no use to\nthe State or to his friends, and reflecting that he would have to throw\naway his life without doing any good either to himself or others, he holds\nhis peace, and goes his own way. He is like one who, in the storm of dust\nand sleet which the driving wind hurries along, retires under the shelter\nof a wall; and seeing the rest of mankind full of wickedness, he is\ncontent, *496E* if only he can live his own life and be pure from evil or\nunrighteousness, and depart in peace and good-will, with bright hopes.\nYes, he said, and he will have done a great work before he departs.\nA great work--yes; but not the greatest, unless he find *497A* a State\nsuitable to him; for in a State which is suitable to him, he will have a\nlarger growth and be the saviour of his country, as well as of himself.\nThe causes why philosophy is in such an evil name have now been\nsufficiently explained: the injustice of the charges against her has been\nshown--is there anything more which you wish to say?\nNothing more on that subject, he replied; but I should like to know which\nof the governments now existing is in your opinion the one adapted to her.\n[Sidenote: No existing State suited to philosophy.]\n*497B* Not any of them, I said; and that is precisely the accusation which\nI bring against them--not one of them is worthy of the philosophic nature,\nand hence that nature is warped and estranged;--as the exotic seed which\nis sown in a foreign land becomes denaturalized, and is wont to be\noverpowered and to lose itself in the new soil, even so this growth {196}\nof philosophy, instead of persisting, degenerates and receives another\ncharacter. But if philosophy ever finds in the State *497C* that\nperfection which she herself is, then will be seen that she is in truth\ndivine, and that all other things, whether natures of men or institutions,\nare but human;--and now, I know, that you are going to ask, What that\nState is:\nNo, he said; there you are wrong, for I was going to ask another\nquestion--whether it is the State of which we are the founders and\ninventors, or some other?\n[Sidenote: Even our own State requires the addition of the living\nauthority.]\nYes, I replied, ours in most respects; but you may remember my saying\nbefore, that some living authority would always be required in the State\nhaving the same idea of *497D* the constitution which guided you when as\nlegislator you were laying down the laws.\nThat was said, he replied.\nYes, but not in a satisfactory manner; you frightened us by interposing\nobjections, which certainly showed that the discussion would be long and\ndifficult; and what still remains is the reverse of easy.\nWhat is there remaining?\nThe question how the study of philosophy may be so ordered as not to be\nthe ruin of the State: All great attempts are attended with risk; 'hard is\nthe good,' as men say.\n*497E* Still, he said, let the point be cleared up, and the enquiry will\nthen be complete.\nI shall not be hindered, I said, by any want of will, but, if at all, by a\nwant of power: my zeal you may see for yourselves; and please to remark in\nwhat I am about to say how boldly and unhesitatingly I declare that States\nshould pursue philosophy, not as they do now, but in a different spirit.\nIn what manner?\n[Sidenote: The superficial study of philosophy which exists in the present\nday.]\n*498A* At present, I said, the students of philosophy are quite young;\nbeginning when they are hardly past childhood, they devote only the time\nsaved from moneymaking and housekeeping to such pursuits; and even those\nof them who are reputed to have most of the philosophic spirit, when they\ncome within sight of the great difficulty of the subject, I mean\ndialectic, take themselves off. In after life when invited by some one\nelse, they may, perhaps, go and hear a lecture, and about this they make\nmuch ado, for philosophy is not considered {197} by them to be their\nproper business: at last, when they grow old, in most cases they are\nextinguished more *498B* truly than Heracleitus' sun, inasmuch as they\nnever light up again[5].\n[Footnote 5: Heraclitus said that the sun was extinguished every evening\nand relighted every morning.]\nBut what ought to be their course?\nJust the opposite. In childhood and youth their study, and what philosophy\nthey learn, should be suited to their tender years: during this period\nwhile they are growing up towards manhood, the chief and special care\nshould be given to their bodies that they may have them to use in the\nservice of philosophy; as life advances and the intellect begins to\nmature, let them increase the gymnastics of the soul; but when the\nstrength of our citizens fails and is past civil and *498C* military\nduties, then let them range at will and engage in no serious labour, as we\nintend them to live happily here, and to crown this life with a similar\nhappiness in another.\n[Sidenote: Thrasymachus once more.]\nHow truly in earnest you are, Socrates! he said; I am sure of that; and\nyet most of your hearers, if I am not mistaken, are likely to be still\nmore earnest in their opposition to you, and will never be convinced;\nThrasymachus least of all.\nDo not make a quarrel, I said, between Thrasymachus and *498D* me, who\nhave recently become friends, although, indeed, we were never enemies; for\nI shall go on striving to the utmost until I either convert him and other\nmen, or do something which may profit them against the day when they live\nagain, and hold the like discourse in another state of existence.\nYou are speaking of a time which is not very near.\n[Sidenote: The people hate philosophy because they have only known bad and\nconventional imitations of it.]\nRather, I replied, of a time which is as nothing in comparison with\neternity. Nevertheless, I do not wonder that the many refuse to believe;\nfor they have never seen that of which we are now speaking realized; they\nhave seen only *498E* a conventional imitation of philosophy, consisting\nof words artificially brought together, not like these of ours having a\nnatural unity. But a human being who in word and work is perfectly\nmoulded, as far as he can be, into the proportion and likeness of\nvirtue--such a man ruling in a city which *499A* bears the same image,\nthey have never yet seen, neither one nor many of them--do you think that\nthey ever did? {198}\nNo indeed.\nNo, my friend, and they have seldom, if ever, heard free and noble\nsentiments; such as men utter when they are earnestly and by every means\nin their power seeking after truth for the sake of knowledge, while they\nlook coldly on the subtleties of controversy, of which the end is opinion\nand strife, whether they meet with them in the courts of law or in\nsociety.\nThey are strangers, he said, to the words of which you speak.\nAnd this was what we foresaw, and this was the reason *499B* why truth\nforced us to admit, not without fear and hesitation, that neither cities\nnor States nor individuals will ever attain perfection until the small\nclass of philosophers whom we termed useless but not corrupt are\nprovidentially compelled, whether they will or not, to take care of the\nState, and until a like necessity be laid on the State to obey them[6]; or\nuntil kings, or if not kings, the sons of kings or princes, are divinely\n*499C* inspired with a true love of true philosophy. That either or both\nof these alternatives are impossible, I see no reason to affirm: if they\nwere so, we might indeed be justly ridiculed as dreamers and visionaries.\nAm I not right?\n[Footnote 6: Reading [Greek: kat\u00eako/\u00f4|] or [Greek: kat\u00eako/ois].]\nQuite right.\n[Sidenote: Somewhere, at some time, there may have been or may be a\nphilosopher who is also the ruler of a State.]\nIf then, in the countless ages of the past, or at the present hour in some\nforeign clime which is far away and beyond *499D* our ken, the perfected\nphilosopher is or has been or hereafter shall be compelled by a superior\npower to have the charge of the State, we are ready to assert to the\ndeath, that this our constitution has been, and is--yea, and will be\nwhenever the Muse of Philosophy is queen. There is no impossibility in all\nthis; that there is a difficulty, we acknowledge ourselves.\nMy opinion agrees with yours, he said.\nBut do you mean to say that this is not the opinion of the multitude?\nI should imagine not, he replied.\nO my friend, I said, do not attack the multitude: they will *499E* change\ntheir minds, if, not in an aggressive spirit, but gently {199} and with\nthe view of soothing them and removing their dislike of over-education,\nyou show them your philosophers as they really are and describe as you\nwere just now doing *500A* their character and profession, and then\nmankind will see that he of whom you are speaking is not such as they\nsupposed--if they view him in this new light, they will surely change\ntheir notion of him, and answer in another strain[7]. Who can be at enmity\nwith one who loves them, who that is himself gentle and free from envy\nwill be jealous of one in whom there is no jealousy? Nay, let me answer\nfor you, that in a few this harsh temper may be found but not in the\nmajority of mankind.\n[Footnote 7: Reading [Greek: \u00ea)= kai\\ e)a\\n ou(/t\u00f4 the\u00f4=ntai] without a\nquestion, and [Greek: a)lloi/an toi]: or, retaining the question and\ntaking [Greek: a)lloi/an do/xan] in a new sense: 'Do you mean to say\nreally that, viewing him in this light, they will be of another mind from\nyours, and answer in another strain?']\nI quite agree with you, he said.\n[Sidenote: The feeling against philosophy is really a feeling against\npretended philosophers who are always talking about persons.]\n*500B* And do you not also think, as I do, that the harsh feeling which\nthe many entertain towards philosophy originates in the pretenders, who\nrush in uninvited, and are always abusing them, and finding fault with\nthem, who make persons instead of things the theme of their conversation?\nand nothing can be more unbecoming in philosophers than this.\nIt is most unbecoming.\n[Sidenote: The true philosopher, who has his eye fixed upon immutable\nprinciples, will fashion States after the heavenly image.]\nFor he, Adeimantus, whose mind is fixed upon true being, has surely no\ntime to look down upon the affairs of earth, or *500C* to be filled with\nmalice and envy, contending against men; his eye is ever directed towards\nthings fixed and immutable, which he sees neither injuring nor injured by\none another, but all in order moving according to reason; these he\nimitates, and to these he will, as far as he can, conform himself. Can a\nman help imitating that with which he holds reverential converse?\nImpossible.\nAnd the philosopher holding converse with the divine order, becomes\norderly and divine, as far as the nature of *500D* man allows; but like\nevery one else, he will suffer from detraction.\nOf course. {200}\nAnd if a necessity be laid upon him of fashioning, not only himself, but\nhuman nature generally, whether in States or individuals, into that which\nhe beholds elsewhere, will he, think you, be an unskilful artificer of\njustice, temperance, and every civil virtue?\nAnything but unskilful.\nAnd if the world perceives that what we are saying about *500E* him is the\ntruth, will they be angry with philosophy? Will they disbelieve us, when\nwe tell them that no State can be happy which is not designed by artists\nwho imitate the heavenly pattern?\nThey will not be angry if they understand, he said. But *501A* how will\nthey draw out the plan of which you are speaking?\n[Sidenote: He will begin with a 'tabula rasa' and there inscribe his\nlaws.]\nThey will begin by taking the State and the manners of men, from which, as\nfrom a tablet, they will rub out the picture, and leave a clean surface.\nThis is no easy task. But whether easy or not, herein will lie the\ndifference between them and every other legislator,--they will have\nnothing to do either with individual or State, and will inscribe no laws,\nuntil they have either found, or themselves made, a clean surface.\nThey will be very right, he said.\nHaving effected this, they will proceed to trace an outline of the\nconstitution?\nNo doubt.\n*501B* And when they are filling in the work, as I conceive, they will\noften turn their eyes upwards and downwards: I mean that they will first\nlook at absolute justice and beauty and temperance, and again at the human\ncopy; and will mingle and temper the various elements of life into the\nimage of a man; and this they will conceive according to that other image,\nwhich, when existing among men, Homer calls the form and likeness of God.\nVery true, he said.\nAnd one feature they will erase, and another they will put *501C* in,\nuntil they have made the ways of men, as far as possible, agreeable to the\nways of God?\nIndeed, he said, in no way could they make a fairer picture.\n[Sidenote: The enemies of philosophy, when they hear the truth, are\ngradually propitiated,]\nAnd now, I said, are we beginning to persuade those whom {201} you\ndescribed as rushing at us with might and main, that the painter of\nconstitutions is such an one as we are praising; at whom they were so very\nindignant because to his hands we committed the State; and are they\ngrowing a little calmer at what they have just heard?\nMuch calmer, if there is any sense in them.\n*501D* Why, where can they still find any ground for objection? Will they\ndoubt that the philosopher is a lover of truth and being?\nThey would not be so unreasonable.\nOr that his nature, being such as we have delineated, is akin to the\nhighest good?\nNeither can they doubt this.\nBut again, will they tell us that such a nature, placed under favourable\ncircumstances, will not be perfectly good and wise if any ever was? Or\nwill they prefer those whom we have rejected?\n*501E* Surely not.\nThen will they still be angry at our saying, that, until philosophers bear\nrule, States and individuals will have no rest from evil, nor will this\nour imaginary State ever be realized?\nI think that they will be less angry.\n[Sidenote: and at length become quite gentle.]\nShall we assume that they are not only less angry but *502A* quite gentle,\nand that they have been converted and for very shame, if for no other\nreason, cannot refuse to come to terms?\nBy all means, he said.\n[Sidenote: There may have been one son of a king a philosopher who has\nremained uncorrupted and has a State obedient to his will.]\nThen let us suppose that the reconciliation has been effected. Will any\none deny the other point, that there may be sons of kings or princes who\nare by nature philosophers?\nSurely no man, he said.\nAnd when they have come into being will any one say that they must of\nnecessity be destroyed; that they can hardly *502B* be saved is not denied\neven by us; but that in the whole course of ages no single one of them can\nescape--who will venture to affirm this?\nWho indeed!\nBut, said I, one is enough; let there be one man who has a city obedient\nto his will, and he might bring into existence the ideal polity about\nwhich the world is so incredulous.\nYes, one is enough. {202}\nThe ruler may impose the laws and institutions which we have been\ndescribing, and the citizens may possibly be willing to obey them?\nCertainly.\nAnd that others should approve, of what we approve, is no miracle or\nimpossibility?\n*502C* I think not.\nBut we have sufficiently shown, in what has preceded, that all this, if\nonly possible, is assuredly for the best.\nWe have.\n[Sidenote: Our constitution then is not unattainable.]\nAnd now we say not only that our laws, if they could be enacted, would be\nfor the best, but also that the enactment of them, though difficult, is\nnot impossible.\nVery good.\nAnd so with pain and toil we have reached the end of one subject, but more\nremains to be discussed;--how and by *502D* what studies and pursuits will\nthe saviours of the constitution be created, and at what ages are they to\napply themselves to their several studies?\nCertainly.\n[Sidenote: Recapitulation.]\nI omitted the troublesome business of the possession of women, and the\nprocreation of children, and the appointment of the rulers, because I knew\nthat the perfect State would be eyed with jealousy and was difficult of\nattainment; but that piece of cleverness was not of much service to me,\n*502E* for I had to discuss them all the same. The women and children are\nnow disposed of, but the other question of the rulers must be investigated\nfrom the very beginning. We were saying, as you will remember, that they\nwere to be lovers *503A* of their country, tried by the test of pleasures\nand pains, and neither in hardships, nor in dangers, nor at any other\ncritical moment were to lose their patriotism--he was to be rejected who\nfailed, but he who always came forth pure, like gold tried in the\nrefiner's fire, was to be made a ruler, and to receive honours and rewards\nin life and after death. This was the sort of thing which was being said,\nand then the argument turned aside and veiled her face; not liking to\n*503B* stir the question which has now arisen.\nI perfectly remember, he said.\n[Sidenote: The guardian must be a philosopher, and a philosopher must be a\nperson of rare gifts]\nYes, my friend, I said, and I then shrank from hazarding {203} the bold\nword; but now let me dare to say--that the perfect guardian must be a\nphilosopher.\nYes, he said, let that be affirmed.\nAnd do not suppose that there will be many of them; for the gifts which\nwere deemed by us to be essential rarely grow together; they are mostly\nfound in shreds and patches.\n*503C* What do you mean? he said.\n[Sidenote: The contrast of the quick and solid temperaments.]\nYou are aware, I replied, that quick intelligence, memory, sagacity,\ncleverness, and similar qualities, do not often grow together, and that\npersons who possess them and are at the same time high-spirited and\nmagnanimous are not so constituted by nature as to live orderly and in a\npeaceful and settled manner; they are driven any way by their impulses,\nand all solid principle goes out of them.\nVery true, he said.\nOn the other hand, those steadfast natures which can *503D* better be\ndepended upon, which in a battle are impregnable to fear and immovable,\nare equally immovable when there is anything to be learned; they are\nalways in a torpid state, and are apt to yawn and go to sleep over any\nintellectual toil.\nQuite true.\n[Sidenote: They must be united.]\nAnd yet we were saying that both qualities were necessary in those to whom\nthe higher education is to be imparted, and who are to share in any office\nor command.\nCertainly, he said.\nAnd will they be a class which is rarely found?\nYes, indeed.\n[Sidenote: He who is to hold command must be tested in many kinds of\nknowledge.]\n*503E* Then the aspirant must not only be tested in those labours and\ndangers and pleasures which we mentioned before, but there is another kind\nof probation which we did not mention--he must be exercised also in many\nkinds of knowledge, to see whether the soul will be able to endure the\nhighest of all, *504A* or will faint under them, as in any other studies\nand exercises.\nYes, he said, you are quite right in testing him. But what do you mean by\nthe highest of all knowledge?\nYou may remember, I said, that we divided the soul into three parts; and\ndistinguished the several natures of justice, temperance, courage, and\nwisdom?\nIndeed, he said, if I had forgotten, I should not deserve to hear more.\n{204}\nAnd do you remember the word of caution which preceded the discussion of\nthem[8]?\n[Footnote 8: Cp. IV. 435 D.]\nTo what do you refer?\n[Sidenote: The shorter exposition of education, which has been already\ngiven, inadequate.]\n*504B* We were saying, if I am not mistaken, that he who wanted to see\nthem in their perfect beauty must take a longer and more circuitous way,\nat the end of which they would appear; but that we could add on a popular\nexposition of them on a level with the discussion which had preceded. And\nyou replied that such an exposition would be enough for you, and so the\nenquiry was continued in what to me seemed to be a very inaccurate manner;\nwhether you were satisfied or not, it is for you to say.\nYes, he said, I thought and the others thought that you gave us a fair\nmeasure of truth.\n*504C* But, my friend, I said, a measure of such things which in any\ndegree falls short of the whole truth is not fair measure; for nothing\nimperfect is the measure of anything, although persons are too apt to be\ncontented and think that they need search no further.\nNot an uncommon case when people are indolent.\nYes, I said; and there cannot be any worse fault in a guardian of the\nState and of the laws.\nTrue.\n[Sidenote: The guardian must take the longer road of the higher learning,]\nThe guardian then, I said, must be required to take the *504D* longer\ncircuit, and toil at learning as well as at gymnastics, or he will never\nreach the highest knowledge of all which, as we were just now saying, is\nhis proper calling.\nWhat, he said, is there a knowledge still higher than this--higher than\njustice and the other virtues?\nYes, I said, there is. And of the virtues too we must behold not the\noutline merely, as at present--nothing short of the most finished picture\nshould satisfy us. When little *504E* things are elaborated with an\ninfinity of pains, in order that they may appear in their full beauty and\nutmost clearness, how ridiculous that we should not think the highest\ntruths worthy of attaining the highest accuracy!\nA right noble thought[9]; but do you suppose that we {205} shall refrain\nfrom asking you what is this highest knowledge?\n[Footnote 9: Or, separating [Greek: kai\\ ma/la] from [Greek: a)/xion],\n'True, he said, and a noble thought': or [Greek: a)/xion to\\ diano/\u00eama]\nmay be a gloss.]\n[Sidenote: which leads upwards at last to the idea of good.]\nNay, I said, ask if you will; but I am certain that you have heard the\nanswer many times, and now you either do not understand me or, as I rather\nthink, you are disposed to be *505A* troublesome; for you have often been\ntold that the idea of good is the highest knowledge, and that all other\nthings become useful and advantageous only by their use of this. You can\nhardly be ignorant that of this I was about to speak, concerning which, as\nyou have often heard me say, we know so little; and, without which, any\nother knowledge *505B* or possession of any kind will profit us nothing.\nDo you think that the possession of all other things is of any value if we\ndo not possess the good? or the knowledge of all other things if we have\nno knowledge of beauty and goodness?\nAssuredly not.\n[Sidenote: But what is the good? Some say pleasure, others knowledge,\nwhich they absurdly explain to mean knowledge of the good.]\nYou are further aware that most people affirm pleasure to be the good, but\nthe finer sort of wits say it is knowledge?\nYes.\nAnd you are aware too that the latter cannot explain what they mean by\nknowledge, but are obliged after all to say knowledge of the good?\nHow ridiculous!\n*505C* Yes, I said, that they should begin by reproaching us with our\nignorance of the good, and then presume our knowledge of it--for the good\nthey define to be knowledge of the good, just as if we understood them\nwhen they use the term 'good'--this is of course ridiculous.\nMost true, he said.\nAnd those who make pleasure their good are in equal perplexity; for they\nare compelled to admit that there are bad pleasures as well as good.\nCertainly.\nAnd therefore to acknowledge that bad and good are the same?\n*505D* True.\nThere can be no doubt about the numerous difficulties in which this\nquestion is involved.\nThere can be none.\nFurther, do we not see that many are willing to do or to {206} have or to\nseem to be what is just and honourable without the reality; but no one is\nsatisfied with the appearance of good--the reality is what they seek; in\nthe case of the good, appearance is despised by every one.\nVery true, he said.\n[Sidenote: Every man pursues the good, but without knowing the nature of\nit.]\nOf this then, which every soul of man pursues and makes *505E* the end of\nall his actions, having a presentiment that there is such an end, and yet\nhesitating because neither knowing *506A* the nature nor having the same\nassurance of this as of other things, and therefore losing whatever good\nthere is in other things,--of a principle such and so great as this ought\nthe best men in our State, to whom everything is entrusted, to be in the\ndarkness of ignorance?\nCertainly not, he said.\nI am sure, I said, that he who does not know how the beautiful and the\njust are likewise good will be but a sorry guardian of them; and I suspect\nthat no one who is ignorant of the good will have a true knowledge of\nthem.\nThat, he said, is a shrewd suspicion of yours.\n*506B* And if we only have a guardian who has this knowledge our State\nwill be perfectly ordered?\n[Sidenote: The guardian ought to know these things.]\nOf course, he replied; but I wish that you would tell me whether you\nconceive this supreme principle of the good to be knowledge or pleasure,\nor different from either?\nAye, I said, I knew all along that a fastidious gentleman[10] like you\nwould not be contented with the thoughts of other people about these\nmatters.\n[Footnote 10: Reading [Greek: a)n\u00ea\\r kalo/s]: or reading [Greek: a)n\u00ea\\r\nkal\u00f4=s], 'I quite well knew from the very first, that you, &c.']\nTrue, Socrates; but I must say that one who like you has passed a lifetime\nin the study of philosophy should not be *506C* always repeating the\nopinions of others, and never telling his own.\nWell, but has any one a right to say positively what he does not know?\nNot, he said, with the assurance of positive certainty; he has no right to\ndo that: but he may say what he thinks, as a matter of opinion.\nAnd do you not know, I said, that all mere opinions are bad, and the best\nof them blind? You would not deny that {207} those who have any true\nnotion without intelligence are only like blind men who feel their way\nalong the road?\nVery true.\nAnd do you wish to behold what is blind and crooked and *506D* base, when\nothers will tell you of brightness and beauty?\n[Sidenote: Socrates, Glaucon.]\nStill, I must implore you, Socrates, said Glaucon, not to turn away just\nas you are reaching the goal; if you will only give such an explanation of\nthe good as you have already given of justice and temperance and the other\nvirtues, we shall be satisfied.\n[Sidenote: We can only attain to the things of mind through the things of\nsense. The 'child' of the good.]\nYes, my friend, and I shall be at least equally satisfied, but I cannot\nhelp fearing that I shall fail, and that my indiscreet zeal will bring\nridicule upon me. No, sweet sirs, let us not *506E* at present ask what is\nthe actual nature of the good, for to reach what is now in my thoughts\nwould be an effort too great for me. But of the child of the good who is\nlikest him, I would fain speak, if I could be sure that you wished to\nhear--otherwise, not.\nBy all means, he said, tell us about the child, and you shall remain in\nour debt for the account of the parent.\n*507A* I do indeed wish, I replied, that I could pay, and you receive, the\naccount of the parent, and not, as now, of the offspring only; take,\nhowever, this latter by way of interest[11], and at the same time have a\ncare that I do not render a false account, although I have no intention of\ndeceiving you.\n[Footnote: 11: A play upon [Greek: to/kos], which means both 'offspring'\nand 'interest.']\nYes, we will take all the care that we can: proceed.\nYes, I said, but I must first come to an understanding with you, and\nremind you of what I have mentioned in the course of this discussion, and\nat many other times.\n*507B* What?\nThe old story, that there is a many beautiful and a many good, and so of\nother things which we describe and define; to all of them the term 'many'\nis applied.\nTrue, he said.\nAnd there is an absolute beauty and an absolute good, and of other things\nto which the term 'many' is applied there is an absolute; for they may be\nbrought under a single idea, which is called the essence of each.\nVery true. {208}\nThe many, as we say, are seen but not known, and the ideas are known but\nnot seen.\nExactly.\n*507C* And what is the organ with which we see the visible things?\nThe sight, he said.\nAnd with the hearing, I said, we hear, and with the other senses perceive\nthe other objects of sense?\nTrue.\n[Sidenote: Sight the most complex of the senses,]\nBut have you remarked that sight is by far the most costly and complex\npiece of workmanship which the artificer of the senses ever contrived?\nNo, I never have, he said.\nThen reflect; has the ear or voice need of any third or *507D* additional\nnature in order that the one may be able to hear and the other to be\nheard?\nNothing of the sort.\nNo, indeed, I replied; and the same is true of most, if not all, the other\nsenses--you would not say that any of them requires such an addition?\nCertainly not.\nBut you see that without the addition of some other nature there is no\nseeing or being seen?\nHow do you mean?\n[Sidenote: and, unlike the other senses, requires the addition of a third\nnature before it can be used. This third nature is light.]\nSight being, as I conceive, in the eyes, and he who has eyes wanting to\nsee; colour being also present in them, still *507E* unless there be a\nthird nature specially adapted to the purpose, the owner of the eyes will\nsee nothing and the colours will be invisible.\nOf what nature are you speaking?\nOf that which you term light, I replied.\nTrue, he said.\n*508A* Noble, then, is the bond which links together sight and visibility,\nand great beyond other bonds by no small difference of nature; for light\nis their bond, and light is no ignoble thing?\nNay, he said, the reverse of ignoble.\nAnd which, I said, of the gods in heaven would you say was the lord of\nthis element? Whose is that light which makes the eye to see perfectly and\nthe visible to appear? {209}\nYou mean the sun, as you and all mankind say.\nMay not the relation of sight to this deity be described as follows?\nHow?\n*508B* Neither sight nor the eye in which sight resides is the sun?\nNo.\n[Sidenote: The eye like the sun, but not the same with it.]\nYet of all the organs of sense the eye is the most like the sun?\nBy far the most like.\nAnd the power which the eye possesses is a sort of effluence which is\ndispensed from the sun?\nExactly.\nThen the sun is not sight, but the author of sight who is recognised by\nsight?\nTrue, he said.\nAnd this is he whom I call the child of the good, whom the good begat in\nhis own likeness, to be in the visible world, in *508C* relation to sight\nand the things of sight, what the good is in the intellectual world in\nrelation to mind and the things of mind:\nWill you be a little more explicit? he said.\nWhy, you know, I said, that the eyes, when a person directs them towards\nobjects on which the light of day is no longer shining, but the moon and\nstars only, see dimly, and are nearly blind; they seem to have no\nclearness of vision in them?\nVery true.\n[Sidenote: Visible objects are to be seen only when the sun shines upon\nthem; truth is only known when illuminated by the idea of good.]\n*508D* But when they are directed towards objects on which the sun shines,\nthey see clearly and there is sight in them?\nCertainly.\nAnd the soul is like the eye: when resting upon that on which truth and\nbeing shine, the soul perceives and understands, and is radiant with\nintelligence; but when turned towards the twilight of becoming and\nperishing, then she has opinion only, and goes blinking about, and is\nfirst of one opinion and then of another, and seems to have no\nintelligence?\nJust so.\n[Sidenote: The idea of good higher than science or truth (the objective\nthan the subjective).]\n*508E* Now, that which imparts truth to the known and the power of knowing\nto the knower is what I would have you term the {210} idea of good, and\nthis you will deem to be the cause of science[12], and of truth in so far\nas the latter becomes the subject of knowledge; beautiful too, as are both\ntruth and knowledge, you will be right in esteeming this other nature\n*509A* as more beautiful than either; and, as in the previous instance,\nlight and sight may be truly said to be like the sun, and yet not to be\nthe sun, so in this other sphere, science and truth may be deemed to be\nlike the good, but not the good; the good has a place of honour yet\nhigher.\n[Footnote 12: Reading [Greek: dianoou=].]\nWhat a wonder of beauty that must be, he said, which is the author of\nscience and truth, and yet surpasses them in beauty; for you surely cannot\nmean to say that pleasure is the good?\nGod forbid, I replied; but may I ask you to consider the image in another\npoint of view?\n*509B* In what point of view?\nYou would say, would you not, that the sun is not only the author of\nvisibility in all visible things, but of generation and nourishment and\ngrowth, though he himself is not generation?\nCertainly.\n[Sidenote: As the sun is the cause of generation, so the good is the cause\nof being and essence.]\nIn like manner the good may be said to be not only the author of knowledge\nto all things known, but of their being and essence, and yet the good is\nnot essence, but far exceeds essence in dignity and power.\n*509C* Glaucon said, with a ludicrous earnestness: By the light of heaven,\nhow amazing!\nYes, I said, and the exaggeration may be set down to you; for you made me\nutter my fancies.\nAnd pray continue to utter them; at any rate let us hear if there is\nanything more to be said about the similitude of the sun.\nYes, I said, there is a great deal more.\nThen omit nothing, however slight.\nI will do my best, I said; but I should think that a great deal will have\nto be omitted.\nI hope not, he said.\n*509D* You have to imagine, then, that there are two ruling {211} powers,\nand that one of them is set over the intellectual world, the other over\nthe visible. I do not say heaven, lest you should fancy that I am playing\nupon the name ([Greek: ou)rano/s, o(rato/s]). May I suppose that you have\nthis distinction of the visible and intelligible fixed in your mind?\nI have.\n[Sidenote: The two spheres of sight and knowledge are represented by a\nline which is divided into two unequal parts.]\nNow take a line which has been cut into two unequal[13] parts, and divide\neach of them again in the same proportion, and suppose the two main\ndivisions to answer, one to the visible and the other to the intelligible,\nand then compare the subdivisions in respect of their clearness and want\nof *509E* clearness, and you will find that the first section in the\n*510A* sphere of the visible consists of images. And by images I mean, in\nthe first place, shadows, and in the second place, reflections in water\nand in solid, smooth and polished bodies and the like: Do you understand?\n[Footnote 13: Reading: [Greek: a)/nisa].]\nYes, I understand.\nImagine, now, the other section, of which this is only the resemblance, to\ninclude the animals which we see, and everything that grows or is made.\nVery good.\nWould you not admit that both the sections of this division have different\ndegrees of truth, and that the copy is to the original as the sphere of\nopinion is to the sphere of knowledge?\n*510B* Most undoubtedly.\nNext proceed to consider the manner in which the sphere of the\nintellectual is to be divided.\nIn what manner?\n[Sidenote: Images and hypotheses.]\nThus:--There are two subdivisions, in the lower of which the soul uses the\nfigures given by the former division as images; the enquiry can only be\nhypothetical, and instead of going upwards to a principle descends to the\nother end; in the higher of the two, the soul passes out of hypotheses,\nand goes up to a principle which is above hypotheses, making no use of\nimages[14] as in the former case, but proceeding only in and through the\nideas themselves.\n[Footnote 14: Reading [Greek: \u00f4(=nper e)kei=no ei)ko/n\u00f4n].]\nI do not quite understand your meaning, he said. {212}\n[Sidenote: The hypotheses of mathematics.]\n*510C* Then I will try again; you will understand me better when I have\nmade some preliminary remarks. You are aware that students of geometry,\narithmetic, and the kindred sciences assume the odd and the even and the\nfigures and three kinds of angles and the like in their several branches\nof science; these are their hypotheses, which they and every body are\nsupposed to know, and therefore they do not deign to give any account of\nthem either to themselves or others; *510D* but they begin with them, and\ngo on until they arrive at last, and in a consistent manner, at their\nconclusion?\nYes, he said, I know.\n[Sidenote: In both spheres hypotheses are used, in the lower taking the\nform of images, but in the higher the soul ascends above hypotheses to the\nidea of good.]\nAnd do you not know also that although they make use of the visible forms\nand reason about them, they are thinking not of these, but of the ideals\nwhich they resemble; not of the *510E* figures which they draw, but of the\nabsolute square and the absolute diameter, and so on--the forms which they\ndraw or make, and which have shadows and reflections in water of their\nown, are converted by them into images, but they are really seeking to\nbehold the things themselves, which can only be seen with the eye of the\nmind?\n*511A* That is true.\nAnd of this kind I spoke as the intelligible, although in the search after\nit the soul is compelled to use hypotheses; not ascending to a first\nprinciple, because she is unable to rise above the region of hypothesis,\nbut employing the objects of which the shadows below are resemblances in\ntheir turn as images, they having in relation to the shadows and\nreflections of them a greater distinctness, and therefore a higher value.\n*511B* I understand, he said, that you are speaking of the province of\ngeometry and the sister arts.\n[Sidenote: Dialectic by the help of hypotheses rises above hypotheses.]\nAnd when I speak of the other division of the intelligible, you will\nunderstand me to speak of that other sort of knowledge which reason\nherself attains by the power of dialectic, using the hypotheses not as\nfirst principles, but only as hypotheses--that is to say, as steps and\npoints of departure into a world which is above hypotheses, in order that\nshe may soar beyond them to the first principle of the whole; and clinging\nto this and then to that which depends on this, by successive steps she\ndescends again without the aid of {213} *511C* any sensible object, from\nideas, through ideas, and in ideas she ends.\n[Sidenote: Return to psychology.]\nI understand you, he replied; not perfectly, for you seem to me to be\ndescribing a task which is really tremendous; but, at any rate,\nI understand you to say that knowledge and being, which the science of\ndialectic contemplates, are clearer than the notions of the arts, as they\nare termed, which proceed from hypotheses only: these are also\ncontemplated by the understanding, and not by the senses: yet, because\n*511D* they start from hypotheses and do not ascend to a principle, those\nwho contemplate them appear to you not to exercise the higher reason upon\nthem, although when a first principle is added to them they are cognizable\nby the higher reason. And the habit which is concerned with geometry and\nthe cognate sciences I suppose that you would term understanding and not\nreason, as being intermediate between opinion and reason.\n[Sidenote: Four faculties: Reason, understanding, faith, perception of\nshadows.]\nYou have quite conceived my meaning, I said; and now, corresponding to\nthese four divisions, let there be four faculties in the soul--reason\nanswering to the highest, *511E* understanding to the second, faith (or\nconviction) to the third, and perception of shadows to the last--and let\nthere be a scale of them, and let us suppose that the several faculties\nhave clearness in the same degree that their objects have truth.\nI understand, he replied, and give my assent, and accept your arrangement.\nBOOK VII.\n[Sidenote: _Republic VII._ Socrates, Glaucon.]\n[Sidenote: The den, the prisoners; the light at a distance;]\n*514A* And now, I said, let me show in a figure how far our nature is\nenlightened or unenlightened:--Behold! human beings living in a\nunderground den, which has a mouth open towards the light and reaching all\nalong the den; here they have been from their childhood, and have their\nlegs and necks chained so that they cannot move, and *514B* can only see\nbefore them, being prevented by the chains from turning round their heads.\nAbove and behind them a fire is blazing at a distance, and between the\nfire and the prisoners there is a raised way; and you will see, if you\nlook, a low wall built along the way, like the screen which marionette\nplayers have in front of them, over which they show the puppets.\nI see.\n[Sidenote: the low wall, and the moving figures of which the shadows are\nseen on the opposite wall of the den.]\nAnd do you see, I said, men passing along the wall carrying *514C* all\nsorts of vessels, and statues and figures of animals *515A* made of wood\nand stone and various materials, which appear over the wall? Some of them\nare talking, others silent.\nYou have shown me a strange image, and they are strange prisoners.\nLike ourselves, I replied; and they see only their own shadows, or the\nshadows of one another, which the fire throws on the opposite wall of the\ncave?\nTrue, he said; how could they see anything but the *515B* shadows if they\nwere never allowed to move their heads?\nAnd of the objects which are being carried in like manner they would only\nsee the shadows?\nYes, he said.\nAnd if they were able to converse with one another, would they not suppose\nthat they were naming what was actually before them[1]? {215}\n[Footnote 1: Reading [Greek: paro/nta].]\nVery true.\n[Sidenote: The prisoners would mistake the shadows for realities.]\nAnd suppose further that the prison had an echo which came from the other\nside, would they not be sure to fancy when one of the passers-by spoke\nthat the voice which they heard came from the passing shadow?\nNo question, he replied.\n*515C* To them, I said, the truth would be literally nothing but the\nshadows of the images.\nThat is certain.\n[Sidenote: And when released, they would still persist in maintaining the\nsuperior truth of the shadows.]\nAnd now look again, and see what will naturally follow if the prisoners\nare released and disabused of their error. At first, when any of them is\nliberated and compelled suddenly to stand up and turn his neck round and\nwalk and look towards the light, he will suffer sharp pains; the glare\nwill distress him, and he will be unable to see the realities of *515D*\nwhich in his former state he had seen the shadows; and then conceive some\none saying to him, that what he saw before was an illusion, but that now,\nwhen he is approaching nearer to being and his eye is turned towards more\nreal existence, he has a clearer vision,--what will be his reply? And you\nmay further imagine that his instructor is pointing to the objects as they\npass and requiring him to name them,--will he not be perplexed? Will he\nnot fancy that the shadows which he formerly saw are truer than the\nobjects which are now shown to him?\nFar truer.\n*515E* And if he is compelled to look straight at the light, will he not\nhave a pain in his eyes which will make him turn away to take refuge in\nthe objects of vision which he can see, and which he will conceive to be\nin reality clearer than the things which are now being shown to him?\nTrue, he said.\n[Sidenote: When dragged upwards, they would be dazzled by excess of\nlight.]\nAnd suppose once more, that he is reluctantly dragged up a steep and\nrugged ascent, and held fast until he is forced into the presence of the\nsun himself, is he not likely to be *516A* pained and irritated? When he\napproaches the light his eyes will be dazzled, and he will not be able to\nsee anything at all of what are now called realities.\nNot all in a moment, he said.\nHe will require to grow accustomed to the sight of the {216} upper world.\nAnd first he will see the shadows best, next the reflections of men and\nother objects in the water, and then the objects themselves; then he will\ngaze upon the light of the moon and the stars and the spangled heaven;\n*516B* and he will see the sky and the stars by night better than the sun\nor the light of the sun by day?\nCertainly.\n[Sidenote: At length they will see the sun and understand his nature.]\nLast of all he will be able to see the sun, and not mere reflections of\nhim in the water, but he will see him in his own proper place, and not in\nanother; and he will contemplate him as he is.\nCertainly.\nHe will then proceed to argue that this is he who gives the season and the\nyears, and is the guardian of all that is in the visible world, and in a\ncertain way the cause of all *516C* things which he and his fellows have\nbeen accustomed to behold?\nClearly, he said, he would first see the sun and then reason about him.\n[Sidenote: They would then pity their old companions of the den.]\nAnd when he remembered his old habitation, and the wisdom of the den and\nhis fellow-prisoners, do you not suppose that he would felicitate himself\non the change, and pity them?\nCertainly, he would.\nAnd if they were in the habit of conferring honours among themselves on\nthose who were quickest to observe the passing shadows and to remark which\nof them went before, and *516D* which followed after, and which were\ntogether; and who were therefore best able to draw conclusions as to the\nfuture, do you think that he would care for such honours and glories, or\nenvy the possessors of them? Would he not say with Homer,\n'Better to be the poor servant of a poor master,'\nand to endure anything, rather than think as they do and live after their\nmanner?\n*516E* Yes, he said, I think that he would rather suffer anything than\nentertain these false notions and live in this miserable manner.\n[Sidenote: But when they returned to the den they would see much worse\nthan those who had never left it.]\nImagine once more, I said, such an one coming suddenly {217} out of the\nsun to be replaced in his old situation; would he not be certain to have\nhis eyes full of darkness?\nTo be sure, he said.\nAnd if there were a contest, and he had to compete in measuring the\nshadows with the prisoners who had never *517A* moved out of the den,\nwhile his sight was still weak, and before his eyes had become steady (and\nthe time which would be needed to acquire this new habit of sight might be\nvery considerable), would he not be ridiculous? Men would say of him that\nup he went and down he came without his eyes; and that it was better not\neven to think of ascending; and if any one tried to loose another and lead\nhim up to the light, let them only catch the offender, and they would put\nhim to death.\nNo question, he said.\n[Sidenote: The prison is the world of sight, the light of the fire is the\nsun.]\nThis entire allegory, I said, you may now append, dear *517B* Glaucon, to\nthe previous argument; the prison-house is the world of sight, the light\nof the fire is the sun, and you will not misapprehend me if you interpret\nthe journey upwards to be the ascent of the soul into the intellectual\nworld according to my poor belief, which, at your desire, I have\nexpressed--whether rightly or wrongly God knows. But, whether true or\nfalse, my opinion is that in the world of knowledge the idea of good\nappears last of all, and is seen *517C* only with an effort; and, when\nseen, is also inferred to be the universal author of all things beautiful\nand right, parent of light and of the lord of light in this visible world,\nand the immediate source of reason and truth in the intellectual; and that\nthis is the power upon which he who would act rationally either in public\nor private life must have his eye fixed.\nI agree, he said, as far as I am able to understand you.\nMoreover, I said, you must not wonder that those who attain to this\nbeatific vision are unwilling to descend to human affairs; for their souls\nare ever hastening into the *517D* upper world where they desire to dwell;\nwhich desire of theirs is very natural, if our allegory may be trusted.\nYes, very natural.\n[Sidenote: Nothing extraordinary in the philosopher being unable to see in\nthe dark.]\nAnd is there anything surprising in one who passes from divine\ncontemplations to the evil state of man, misbehaving {218} himself in a\nridiculous manner; if, while his eyes are blinking and before he has\nbecome accustomed to the surrounding darkness, he is compelled to fight in\ncourts of law, or in other places, about the images or the shadows of\nimages of *517E* justice, and is endeavouring to meet the conceptions of\nthose who have never yet seen absolute justice?\nAnything but surprising, he replied.\n[Sidenote: The eyes may be blinded in two ways, by excess or by defect of\nlight.]\n*518A* Any one who has common sense will remember that the bewilderments\nof the eyes are of two kinds, and arise from two causes, either from\ncoming out of the light or from going into the light, which is true of the\nmind's eye, quite as much as of the bodily eye; and he who remembers this\nwhen he sees any one whose vision is perplexed and weak, will not be too\nready to laugh; he will first ask whether that soul of man has come out of\nthe brighter life, and is unable to see because unaccustomed to the dark,\nor having turned from darkness to the day is dazzled by excess of light.\n*518B* And he will count the one happy in his condition and state of\nbeing, and he will pity the other; or, if he have a mind to laugh at the\nsoul which comes from below into the light, there will be more reason in\nthis than in the laugh which greets him who returns from above out of the\nlight into the den.\nThat, he said, is a very just distinction.\n[Sidenote: The conversion of the soul is the turning round the eye from\ndarkness to light.]\nBut then, if I am right, certain professors of education must be wrong\nwhen they say that they can put a knowledge *518C* into the soul which was\nnot there before, like sight into blind eyes.\nThey undoubtedly say this, he replied.\nWhereas, our argument shows that the power and capacity of learning exists\nin the soul already; and that just as the eye was unable to turn from\ndarkness to light without the whole body, so too the instrument of\nknowledge can only by the movement of the whole soul be turned from the\nworld of becoming into that of being, and learn by degrees to endure the\nsight of being, and of the brightest and best of being, or *518D* in other\nwords, of the good.\nVery true.\nAnd must there not be some art which will effect conversion in the easiest\nand quickest manner; not implanting {219} the faculty of sight, for that\nexists already, but has been turned in the wrong direction, and is looking\naway from the truth?\nYes, he said, such an art may be presumed.\n[Sidenote: The virtue of wisdom has a divine power which may be turned\neither towards good or towards evil.]\nAnd whereas the other so-called virtues of the soul seem to be akin to\nbodily qualities, for even when they are not *518E* originally innate they\ncan be implanted later by habit and exercise, the virtue of wisdom more\nthan anything else contains a divine element which always remains, and by\nthis conversion is rendered useful and profitable; or, on the other hand,\nhurtful and useless. Did you never observe the narrow *519A* intelligence\nflashing from the keen eye of a clever rogue--how eager he is, how clearly\nhis paltry soul sees the way to his end; he is the reverse of blind, but\nhis keen eye-sight is forced into the service of evil, and he is\nmischievous in proportion to his cleverness?\nVery true, he said.\nBut what if there had been a circumcision of such natures in the days of\ntheir youth; and they had been severed from those sensual pleasures, such\nas eating and drinking, which, *519B* like leaden weights, were attached\nto them at their birth, and which drag them down and turn the vision of\ntheir souls upon the things that are below--if, I say, they had been\nreleased from these impediments and turned in the opposite direction, the\nvery same faculty in them would have seen the truth as keenly as they see\nwhat their eyes are turned to now.\nVery likely.\n[Sidenote: Neither the uneducated nor the overeducated will be good\nservants of the State.]\nYes, I said; and there is another thing which is likely, or rather a\nnecessary inference from what has preceded, that neither the uneducated\nand uninformed of the truth, nor *519C* yet those who never make an end of\ntheir education, will be able ministers of State; not the former, because\nthey have no single aim of duty which is the rule of all their actions,\nprivate as well as public; nor the latter, because they will not act at\nall except upon compulsion, fancying that they are already dwelling apart\nin the islands of the blest.\nVery true, he replied.\nThen, I said, the business of us who are the founders of the State will be\nto compel the best minds to attain that {220} knowledge which we have\nalready shown to be the greatest of all--they must continue to ascend\nuntil they arrive at the good; *519D* but when they have ascended and seen\nenough we must not allow them to do as they do now.\nWhat do you mean?\n[Sidenote: Men should ascend to the upper world, but they should also\nreturn to the lower.]\nI mean that they remain in the upper world: but this must not be allowed;\nthey must be made to descend again among the prisoners in the den, and\npartake of their labours and honours, whether they are worth having or\nnot.\nBut is not this unjust? he said; ought we to give them a worse life, when\nthey might have a better?\n*519E* You have again forgotten, my friend, I said, the intention of the\nlegislator, who did not aim at making any one class in the State happy\nabove the rest; the happiness was to be in the whole State, and he held\nthe citizens together by persuasion and necessity, making them benefactors\nof the State, *520A* and therefore benefactors of one another; to this end\nhe created them, not to please themselves, but to be his instruments in\nbinding up the State.\nTrue, he said, I had forgotten.\n[Sidenote: The duties of philosophers.]\n[Sidenote: Their obligations to their country will induce them to take\npart in her government.]\nObserve, Glaucon, that there will be no injustice in compelling our\nphilosophers to have a care and providence of others; we shall explain to\nthem that in other States, men *520B* of their class are not obliged to\nshare in the toils of politics: and this is reasonable, for they grow up\nat their own sweet will, and the government would rather not have them.\nBeing self-taught, they cannot be expected to show any gratitude for a\nculture which they have never received. But we have brought you into the\nworld to be rulers of the hive, kings of yourselves and of the other\ncitizens, and have educated you far better and more perfectly than they\nhave been educated, and you are better able to share in the double duty.\n*520C* Wherefore each of you, when his turn comes, must go down to the\ngeneral underground abode, and get the habit of seeing in the dark. When\nyou have acquired the habit, you will see ten thousand times better than\nthe inhabitants of the den, and you will know what the several images are,\nand what they represent, because you have seen the beautiful and just and\ngood in their truth. And thus our State, which is also yours, will be a\nreality, and not a dream {221} only, and will be administered in a spirit\nunlike that of other States, in which men fight with one another about\nshadows only and are distracted in the struggle for power, *520D* which in\ntheir eyes is a great good. Whereas the truth is that the State in which\nthe rulers are most reluctant to govern is always the best and most\nquietly governed, and the State in which they are most eager, the worst.\nQuite true, he replied.\nAnd will our pupils, when they hear this, refuse to take their turn at the\ntoils of State, when they are allowed to spend the greater part of their\ntime with one another in the heavenly light?\n[Sidenote: They will be willing but not anxious to rule.]\n*520E* Impossible, he answered; for they are just men, and the commands\nwhich we impose upon them are just; there can be no doubt that every one\nof them will take office as a stern necessity, and not after the fashion\nof our present rulers of State.\n[Sidenote: The statesman must be provided with a better life than that of\na ruler; and then he will not covet office.]\nYes, my friend, I said; and there lies the point. You *521A* must contrive\nfor your future rulers another and a better life than that of a ruler, and\nthen you may have a well-ordered State; for only in the State which offers\nthis, will they rule who are truly rich, not in silver and gold, but in\nvirtue and wisdom, which are the true blessings of life. Whereas if they\ngo to the administration of public affairs, poor and hungering after their\nown private advantage, thinking that hence they are to snatch the chief\ngood, order there can never be; for they will be fighting about office,\nand the civil and domestic broils which thus arise will be the ruin of the\nrulers themselves and of the whole State.\nMost true, he replied.\n*521B* And the only life which looks down upon the life of political\nambition is that of true philosophy. Do you know of any other?\nIndeed, I do not, he said.\nAnd those who govern ought not to be lovers of the task? For, if they are,\nthere will be rival lovers, and they will fight.\nNo question.\nWho then are those whom we shall compel to be guardians? Surely they will\nbe the men who are wisest about affairs of {222} State, and by whom the\nState is best administered, and who at the same time have other honours\nand another and a better life than that of politics?\nThey are the men, and I will choose them, he replied.\n*521C* And now shall we consider in what way such guardians will be\nproduced, and how they are to be brought from darkness to light,--as some\nare said to have ascended from the world below to the gods?\nBy all means, he replied.\n[Sidenote: The training of the guardians.]\nThe process, I said, is not the turning over of an oyster-shell[2], but\nthe turning round of a soul passing from a day which is little better than\nnight to the true day of being, that is, the ascent from below[3], which\nwe affirm to be true philosophy?\n[Footnote 2: In allusion to a game in which two parties fled or pursued\naccording as an oyster-shell which was thrown into the air fell with the\ndark or light side uppermost.]\n[Footnote 3: Reading [Greek: ou)=san e)pa/nodon].]\nQuite so.\nAnd should we not enquire what sort of knowledge has the *521D* power of\neffecting such a change?\nCertainly.\n[Sidenote: What knowledge will draw the soul upwards?]\nWhat sort of knowledge is there which would draw the soul from becoming to\nbeing? And another consideration has just occurred to me: You will\nremember that our young men are to be warrior athletes?\nYes, that was said.\nThen this new kind of knowledge must have an additional quality?\nWhat quality?\nUsefulness in war.\nYes, if possible.\n[Sidenote: Recapitulation.]\nThere were two parts in our former scheme of education, *521E* were there\nnot?\n[Sidenote: There were two parts in our former scheme of education, were\nthere not?]\nJust so.\nThere was gymnastic which presided over the growth and decay of the body,\nand may therefore be regarded as having to do with generation and\ncorruption?\nTrue.\n*522A* Then that is not the knowledge which we are seeking to discover?\n{223}\nNo.\nBut what do you say of music, which also entered to a certain extent into\nour former scheme?\nMusic, he said, as you will remember, was the counterpart of gymnastic,\nand trained the guardians by the influences of habit, by harmony making\nthem harmonious, by rhythm rhythmical, but not giving them science; and\nthe words, whether fabulous or possibly true, had kindred elements of\nrhythm and harmony in them. But in music there was *522B* nothing which\ntended to that good which you are now seeking.\nYou are most accurate, I said, in your recollection; in music there\ncertainly was nothing of the kind. But what branch of knowledge is there,\nmy dear Glaucon, which is of the desired nature; since all the useful arts\nwere reckoned mean by us?\nUndoubtedly; and yet if music and gymnastic are excluded, and the arts are\nalso excluded, what remains?\nWell, I said, there may be nothing left of our special subjects; and then\nwe shall have to take something which is not special, but of universal\napplication.\nWhat may that be?\n[Sidenote: There remains for the second education, arithmetic;]\n*522C* A something which all arts and sciences and intelligences use in\ncommon, and which every one first has to learn among the elements of\neducation.\nWhat is that?\nThe little matter of distinguishing one, two, and three--in a word, number\nand calculation:--do not all arts and sciences necessarily partake of\nthem?\nYes.\nThen the art of war partakes of them?\nTo be sure.\n*522D* Then Palamedes, whenever he appears in tragedy, proves Agamemnon\nridiculously unfit to be a general. Did you never remark how he declares\nthat he had invented number, and had numbered the ships and set in array\nthe ranks of the army at Troy; which implies that they had never been\nnumbered before, and Agamemnon must be supposed literally to have been\nincapable of counting his own feet--how could he if he was ignorant of\nnumber? And if that is true, what sort of general must he have been? {224}\nI should say a very strange one, if this was as you say.\n*522E* Can we deny that a warrior should have a knowledge of arithmetic?\nCertainly he should, if he is to have the smallest understanding of\nmilitary tactics, or indeed, I should rather say, if he is to be a man at\nall.\nI should like to know whether you have the same notion which I have of\nthis study?\nWhat is your notion?\n[Sidenote: that being a study which leads naturally to reflection, for]\nIt appears to me to be a study of the kind which we are *523A* seeking,\nand which leads naturally to reflection, but never to have been rightly\nused; for the true use of it is simply to draw the soul towards being.\nWill you explain your meaning? he said.\nI will try, I said; and I wish you would share the enquiry with me, and\nsay 'yes' or 'no' when I attempt to distinguish in my own mind what\nbranches of knowledge have this attracting power, in order that we may\nhave clearer proof that arithmetic is, as I suspect, one of them.\nExplain, he said.\n[Sidenote: reflection is aroused by contradictory impressions of sense.]\nI mean to say that objects of sense are of two kinds; some *523B* of them\ndo not invite thought because the sense is an adequate judge of them;\nwhile in the case of other objects sense is so untrustworthy that further\nenquiry is imperatively demanded.\nYou are clearly referring, he said, to the manner in which the senses are\nimposed upon by distance, and by painting in light and shade.\nNo, I said, that is not at all my meaning.\nThen what is your meaning?\nWhen speaking of uninviting objects, I mean those which *523C* do not pass\nfrom one sensation to the opposite; inviting objects are those which do;\nin this latter case the sense coming upon the object, whether at a\ndistance or near, gives no more vivid idea of anything in particular than\nof its opposite. An illustration will make my meaning clearer:--here are\nthree fingers--a little finger, a second finger, and a middle finger.\nVery good. {225}\nYou may suppose that they are seen quite close: And here comes the point.\nWhat is it?\n[Sidenote: No difficulty in simple perception.]\nEach of them equally appears a finger, whether seen in the *523D* middle\nor at the extremity, whether white or black, or thick or thin--it makes no\ndifference; a finger is a finger all the same. In these cases a man is not\ncompelled to ask of thought the question what is a finger? for the sight\nnever intimates to the mind that a finger is other than a finger.\nTrue.\nAnd therefore, I said, as we might expect, there is nothing *523E* here\nwhich invites or excites intelligence.\nThere is not, he said.\n[Sidenote: But the same senses at the same time give different impressions\nwhich are at first indistinct and have to be distinguished by the mind.]\nBut is this equally true of the greatness and smallness of the fingers?\nCan sight adequately perceive them? and is no difference made by the\ncircumstance that one of the fingers is in the middle and another at the\nextremity? And in like manner does the touch adequately perceive the\nqualities of thickness or thinness, of softness or hardness? And so of the\nother senses; do they give perfect intimations of such matters? *524A* Is\nnot their mode of operation on this wise--the sense which is concerned\nwith the quality of hardness is necessarily concerned also with the\nquality of softness, and only intimates to the soul that the same thing is\nfelt to be both hard and soft?\nYou are quite right, he said.\nAnd must not the soul be perplexed at this intimation which the sense\ngives of a hard which is also soft? What, again, is the meaning of light\nand heavy, if that which is light is also heavy, and that which is heavy,\nlight?\n*524B* Yes, he said, these intimations which the soul receives are very\ncurious and require to be explained.\n[Sidenote: The aid of numbers is invoked in order to remove the\nconfusion.]\nYes, I said, and in these perplexities the soul naturally summons to her\naid calculation and intelligence, that she may see whether the several\nobjects announced to her are one or two.\nTrue.\nAnd if they turn out to be two, is not each of them one and different?\nCertainly. {226}\nAnd if each is one, and both are two, she will conceive the *524C* two as\nin a state of division, for if there were undivided they could only be\nconceived of as one?\nTrue.\nThe eye certainly did see both small and great, but only in a confused\nmanner; they were not distinguished.\nYes.\n[Sidenote: The chaos then begins to be defined.]\nWhereas the thinking mind, intending to light up the chaos, was compelled\nto reverse the process, and look at small and great as separate and not\nconfused.\nVery true.\nWas not this the beginning of the enquiry 'What is great?' and 'What is\nsmall?'\nExactly so.\n[Sidenote: The parting of the visible and intelligible.]\nAnd thus arose the distinction of the visible and the intelligible.\n*524D* Most true.\nThis was what I meant when I spoke of impressions which invited the\nintellect, or the reverse--those which are simultaneous with opposite\nimpressions, invite thought; those which are not simultaneous do not.\nI understand, he said, and agree with you.\nAnd to which class do unity and number belong?\nI do not know, he replied.\n[Sidenote: Thought is aroused by the contradiction of the one and many.]\nThink a little and you will see that what has preceded will supply the\nanswer; for if simple unity could be adequately perceived by the sight or\nby any other sense, then, *524E* as we were saying in the case of the\nfinger, there would be nothing to attract towards being; but when there is\nsome contradiction always present, and one is the reverse of one and\ninvolves the conception of plurality, then thought begins to be aroused\nwithin us, and the soul perplexed and wanting to arrive at a decision asks\n'What is absolute unity?' This *525A* is the way in which the study of the\none has a power of drawing and converting the mind to the contemplation of\ntrue being.\nAnd surely, he said, this occurs notably in the case of one; for we see\nthe same thing to be both one and infinite in multitude?\nYes, I said; and this being true of one must be equally true of all\nnumber? {227}\nCertainly.\nAnd all arithmetic and calculation have to do with number?\nYes.\n*525B* And they appear to lead the mind towards truth?\nYes, in a very remarkable manner.\n[Sidenote: Arithmetic has a practical and also a philosophical use, the\nlatter the higher.]\nThen this is knowledge of the kind for which we are seeking, having a\ndouble use, military and philosophical; for the man of war must learn the\nart of number or he will not know how to array his troops, and the\nphilosopher also, because he has to rise out of the sea of change and lay\nhold of true being, and therefore he must be an arithmetician.\nThat is true.\nAnd our guardian is both warrior and philosopher?\nCertainly.\nThen this is a kind of knowledge which legislation may fitly prescribe;\nand we must endeavour to persuade those *525C* who are to be the principal\nmen of our State to go and learn arithmetic, not as amateurs, but they\nmust carry on the study until they see the nature of numbers with the mind\nonly; nor again, like merchants or retail-traders, with a view to buying\nor selling, but for the sake of their military use, and of the soul\nherself; and because this will be the easiest way for her to pass from\nbecoming to truth and being.\nThat is excellent, he said.\nYes, I said, and now having spoken of it, I must add *525D* how charming\nthe science is! and in how many ways it conduces to our desired end, if\npursued in the spirit of a philosopher, and not of a shopkeeper!\nHow do you mean?\n[Sidenote: The higher arithmetic is concerned, not with visible or\ntangible objects, but with abstract numbers.]\nI mean, as I was saying, that arithmetic has a very great and elevating\neffect, compelling the soul to reason about abstract number, and rebelling\nagainst the introduction of visible or tangible objects into the argument.\nYou know *525E* how steadily the masters of the art repel and ridicule any\none who attempts to divide absolute unity when he is calculating, and if\nyou divide, they multiply[4], taking care that one shall continue one and\nnot become lost in fractions. {228}\n[Footnote 4: Meaning either (1) that they integrate the number because\nthey deny the possibility of fractions; or (2) that division is regarded\nby them as a process of multiplication, for the fractions of one continue\nto be units.]\nThat is very true.\n*526A* Now, suppose a person were to say to them: O my friends, what are\nthese wonderful numbers about which you are reasoning, in which, as you\nsay, there is a unity such as you demand, and each unit is equal,\ninvariable, indivisible,--what would they answer?\nThey would answer, as I should conceive, that they were speaking of those\nnumbers which can only be realized in thought.\nThen you see that this knowledge may be truly called *526B* necessary,\nnecessitating as it clearly does the use of the pure intelligence in the\nattainment of pure truth?\nYes; that is a marked characteristic of it.\n[Sidenote: The arithmetician is naturally quick, and the study of\narithmetic gives him still greater quickness.]\nAnd have you further observed, that those who have a natural talent for\ncalculation are generally quick at every other kind of knowledge; and even\nthe dull, if they have had an arithmetical training, although they may\nderive no other advantage from it, always become much quicker than they\nwould otherwise have been.\nVery true, he said.\n*526C* And indeed, you will not easily find a more difficult study, and\nnot many as difficult.\nYou will not.\nAnd, for all these reasons, arithmetic is a kind of knowledge in which the\nbest natures should be trained, and which must not be given up.\nI agree.\nLet this then be made one of our subjects of education. And next, shall we\nenquire whether the kindred science also concerns us?\nYou mean geometry?\nExactly so.\n[Sidenote: Geometry has practical applications;]\n*526D* Clearly, he said, we are concerned with that part of geometry which\nrelates to war; for in pitching a camp, or taking up a position, or\nclosing or extending the lines of an army, or any other military\nmanoeuvre, whether in actual battle or on a march, it will make all the\ndifference whether a general is or is not a geometrician.\n[Sidenote: these however are trifling in comparison with that greater part\nof the science which tends towards the good,]\nYes, I said, but for that purpose a very little of either geometry or\ncalculation will be enough; the question relates {229} rather to the\ngreater and more advanced part of geometry-- *526E* whether that tends in\nany degree to make more easy the vision of the idea of good; and thither,\nas I was saying, all things tend which compel the soul to turn her gaze\ntowards that place, where is the full perfection of being, which she\nought, by all means, to behold.\nTrue, he said.\nThen if geometry compels us to view being, it concerns us; if becoming\nonly, it does not concern us?\n*527A* Yes, that is what we assert.\nYet anybody who has the least acquaintance with geometry will not deny\nthat such a conception of the science is in flat contradiction to the\nordinary language of geometricians.\nHow so?\nThey have in view practice only, and are always speaking, in a narrow and\nridiculous manner, of squaring and extending and applying and the\nlike--they confuse the necessities of geometry with those of daily life;\nwhereas knowledge is the *527B* real object of the whole science.\nCertainly, he said.\nThen must not a further admission be made?\nWhat admission?\n[Sidenote: and is concerned with the eternal.]\nThat the knowledge at which geometry aims is knowledge of the eternal, and\nnot of aught perishing and transient.\nThat, he replied, may be readily allowed, and is true.\nThen, my noble friend, geometry will draw the soul towards truth, and\ncreate the spirit of philosophy, and raise up that which is now unhappily\nallowed to fall down.\nNothing will be more likely to have such an effect.\n*527C* Then nothing should be more sternly laid down than that the\ninhabitants of your fair city should by all means learn geometry. Moreover\nthe science has indirect effects, which are not small.\nOf what kind? he said.\nThere are the military advantages of which you spoke, I said; and in all\ndepartments of knowledge, as experience proves, any one who has studied\ngeometry is infinitely quicker of apprehension than one who has not.\nYes indeed, he said, there is an infinite difference between them. {230}\nThen shall we propose this as a second branch of knowledge which our youth\nwill study?\nLet us do so, he replied.\n*527D* And suppose we make astronomy the third--what do you say?\n[Sidenote: Astronomy, like the previous sciences, is at first praised by\nGlaucon for its practical uses.]\nI am strongly inclined to it, he said; the observation of the seasons and\nof months and years is as essential to the general as it is to the farmer\nor sailor.\nI am amused, I said, at your fear of the world, which makes you guard\nagainst the appearance of insisting upon useless studies; and I quite\nadmit the difficulty of believing that in every man there is an eye of the\nsoul which, when by *527E* other pursuits lost and dimmed, is by these\npurified and re-illumined; and is more precious far than ten thousand\nbodily eyes, for by it alone is truth seen. Now there are two classes of\npersons: one class of those who will agree with you and will take your\nwords as a revelation; another class *528A* to whom they will be utterly\nunmeaning, and who will naturally deem them to be idle tales, for they see\nno sort of profit which is to be obtained from them. And therefore you had\nbetter decide at once with which of the two you are proposing to argue.\nYou will very likely say with neither, and that your chief aim in carrying\non the argument is your own improvement; at the same time you do not\ngrudge to others any benefit which they may receive.\nI think that I should prefer to carry on the argument mainly on my own\nbehalf.\n[Sidenote: Correction of the order.]\nThen take a step backward, for we have gone wrong in the order of the\nsciences.\nWhat was the mistake? he said.\nAfter plane geometry, I said, we proceeded at once to *528B* solids in\nrevolution, instead of taking solids in themselves; whereas after the\nsecond dimension the third, which is concerned with cubes and dimensions\nof depth, ought to have followed.\nThat is true, Socrates; but so little seems to be known as yet about these\nsubjects.\n[Sidenote: The pitiable condition of solid geometry.]\nWhy, yes, I said, and for two reasons:--in the first place, no government\npatronises them; this leads to a want of energy in the pursuit of them,\nand they are difficult; in the {231} second place, students cannot learn\nthem unless they have a director. But then a director can hardly be found,\nand even *528C* if he could, as matters now stand, the students, who are\nvery conceited, would not attend to him. That, however, would be otherwise\nif the whole State became the director of these studies and gave honour to\nthem; then disciples would want to come, and there would be continuous and\nearnest search, and discoveries would be made; since even now, disregarded\nas they are by the world, and maimed of their fair proportions, and\nalthough none of their votaries can tell the use of them, still these\nstudies force their way by their natural charm, and very likely, if they\nhad the help of the State, they would some day emerge into light.\n*528D* Yes, he said, there is a remarkable charm in them. But I do not\nclearly understand the change in the order. First you began with a\ngeometry of plane surfaces?\nYes, I said.\nAnd you placed astronomy next, and then you made a step backward?\n[Sidenote: The motion of solids.]\nYes, and I have delayed you by my hurry; the ludicrous state of solid\ngeometry, which, in natural order, should have followed, made me pass over\nthis branch and go on to *528E* astronomy, or motion of solids.\nTrue, he said.\nThen assuming that the science now omitted would come into existence if\nencouraged by the State, let us go on to astronomy, which will be fourth.\n[Sidenote: Glaucon grows sentimental about astronomy.]\nThe right order, he replied. And now, Socrates, as you rebuked the vulgar\nmanner in which I praised astronomy *529A* before, my praise shall be\ngiven in your own spirit. For every one, as I think, must see that\nastronomy compels the soul to look upwards and leads us from this world to\nanother.\nEvery one but myself, I said; to every one else this may be clear, but not\nto me.\nAnd what then would you say?\nI should rather say that those who elevate astronomy into philosophy\nappear to me to make us look downwards and not upwards.\nWhat do you mean? he asked. {232}\n[Sidenote: He is rebuked by Socrates,]\nYou, I replied, have in your mind a truly sublime conception of our\nknowledge of the things above. And I dare *529B* say that if a person were\nto throw his head back and study the fretted ceiling, you would still\nthink that his mind was the percipient, and not his eyes. And you are very\nlikely right, and I may be a simpleton: but, in my opinion, that knowledge\nonly which is of being and of the unseen can make the soul look upwards,\nand whether a man gapes at the heavens or blinks on the ground, seeking to\nlearn some particular of sense, I would deny that he can learn, for *529C*\nnothing of that sort is matter of science; his soul is looking downwards,\nnot upwards, whether his way to knowledge is by water or by land, whether\nhe floats, or only lies on his back.\n[Sidenote: who explains that the higher astronomy is an abstract science.]\nI acknowledge, he said, the justice of your rebuke. Still, I should like\nto ascertain how astronomy can be learned in any manner more conducive to\nthat knowledge of which we are speaking?\nI will tell you, I said: The starry heaven which we behold is wrought upon\na visible ground, and therefore, *529D* although the fairest and most\nperfect of visible things, must necessarily be deemed inferior far to the\ntrue motions of absolute swiftness and absolute slowness, which are\nrelative to each other, and carry with them that which is contained in\nthem, in the true number and in every true figure. Now, these are to be\napprehended by reason and intelligence, but not by sight.\nTrue, he replied.\nThe spangled heavens should be used as a pattern and with a view to that\nhigher knowledge; their beauty is like *529E* the beauty of figures or\npictures excellently wrought by the hand of Daedalus, or some other great\nartist, which we may chance to behold; any geometrician who saw them would\nappreciate the exquisiteness of their workmanship, but he would never\ndream of thinking that in them he could find the true equal or the true\ndouble, or the truth of any *530A* other proportion.\nNo, he replied, such an idea would be ridiculous.\nAnd will not a true astronomer have the same feeling when he looks at the\nmovements of the stars? Will he not think that heaven and the things in\nheaven are framed by the {233} Creator of them in the most perfect manner?\nBut he will never imagine that the proportions of night and day, or of\nboth to the month, or of the month to the year, or of the *530B* stars to\nthese and to one another, and any other things that are material and\nvisible can also be eternal and subject to no deviation--that would be\nabsurd; and it is equally absurd to take so much pains in investigating\ntheir exact truth.\nI quite agree, though I never thought of this before.\n[Sidenote: The real knowledge of astronomy or geometry is to be attained\nby the use of abstractions.]\nThen, I said, in astronomy, as in geometry, we should employ problems, and\nlet the heavens alone if we would approach the subject in the right way\nand so make the *530C* natural gift of reason to be of any real use.\nThat, he said, is a work infinitely beyond our present astronomers.\nYes, I said; and there are many other things which must also have a\nsimilar extension given to them, if our legislation is to be of any value.\nBut can you tell me of any other suitable study?\nNo, he said, not without thinking.\nMotion, I said, has many forms, and not one only; two of *530D* them are\nobvious enough even to wits no better than ours; and there are others, as\nI imagine, which may be left to wiser persons.\nBut where are the two?\nThere is a second, I said, which is the counterpart of the one already\nnamed.\nAnd what may that be?\n[Sidenote: What astronomy is to the eye, harmonics are to the ear.]\nThe second, I said, would seem relatively to the ears to be what the first\nis to the eyes; for I conceive that as the eyes are designed to look up at\nthe stars, so are the ears to hear harmonious motions; and these are\nsister sciences--as the Pythagoreans say, and we, Glaucon, agree with\nthem?\nYes, he replied.\n*530E* But this, I said, is a laborious study, and therefore we had better\ngo and learn of them; and they will tell us whether there are any other\napplications of these sciences. At the same time, we must not lose sight\nof our own higher object.\nWhat is that?\n[Sidenote: They must be studied with a view to the good and not after the\nfashion of the empirics or even of the Pythagoreans.]\nThere is a perfection which all knowledge ought to reach, {234} and which\nour pupils ought also to attain, and not to fall short of, as I was saying\nthat they did in astronomy. *531A* For in the science of harmony, as you\nprobably know, the same thing happens. The teachers of harmony compare the\nsounds and consonances which are heard only, and their labour, like that\nof the astronomers, is in vain.\nYes, by heaven! he said; and 'tis as good as a play to hear them talking\nabout their condensed notes, as they call them; they put their ears close\nalongside of the strings like persons catching a sound from their\nneighbour's wall[5]--one set of them declaring that they distinguish an\nintermediate note and have found the least interval which should be the\nunit of measurement; the others insisting that the two sounds have passed\ninto the same--either party setting *531B* their ears before their\nunderstanding.\n[Footnote 5: Or, 'close alongside of their neighbour's instruments, as if\nto catch a sound from them.']\nYou mean, I said, those gentlemen who tease and torture the strings and\nrack them on the pegs of the instrument: I might carry on the metaphor and\nspeak after their manner of the blows which the plectrum gives, and make\naccusations against the strings, both of backwardness and forwardness to\nsound; but this would be tedious, and therefore I will only say that these\nare not the men, and that I am referring to the Pythagoreans, of whom\nI was just now proposing to enquire about harmony. For they too are in\nerror, like the *531C* astronomers; they investigate the numbers of the\nharmonies which are heard, but they never attain to problems--that is to\nsay, they never reach the natural harmonies of number, or reflect why some\nnumbers are harmonious and others not.\nThat, he said, is a thing of more than mortal knowledge.\nA thing, I replied, which I would rather call useful; that is, if sought\nafter with a view to the beautiful and good; but if pursued in any other\nspirit, useless.\nVery true, he said.\n[Sidenote: All these studies must be correlated with one another.]\nNow, when all these studies reach the point of inter-communion *531D* and\nconnection with one another, and come to be considered in their mutual\naffinities, then, I think, but not till then, will the pursuit of them\nhave a value for our objects; otherwise there is no profit in them. {235}\nI suspect so; but you are speaking, Socrates, of a vast work.\nWhat do you mean? I said; the prelude or what? Do you not know that all\nthis is but the prelude to the actual strain which we have to learn? For\nyou surely would not *531E* regard the skilled mathematician as a\ndialectician?\n[Sidenote: Want of reasoning power in mathematicians.]\nAssuredly not, he said; I have hardly ever known a mathematician who was\ncapable of reasoning.\nBut do you imagine that men who are unable to give and take a reason will\nhave the knowledge which we require of them?\nNeither can this be supposed.\n[Sidenote: Dialectic proceeds by reason only, without any help of sense.]\n*532A* And so, Glaucon, I said, we have at last arrived at the hymn of\ndialectic. This is that strain which is of the intellect only, but which\nthe faculty of sight will nevertheless be found to imitate; for sight, as\nyou may remember, was imagined by us after a while to behold the real\nanimals and stars, and last of all the sun himself. And so with dialectic;\nwhen a person starts on the discovery of the absolute by the light of\nreason only, and without any assistance of sense, and perseveres *532B*\nuntil by pure intelligence he arrives at the perception of the absolute\ngood, he at last finds himself at the end of the intellectual world, as in\nthe case of sight at the end of the visible.\nExactly, he said.\nThen this is the progress which you call dialectic?\nTrue.\n[Sidenote: The gradual acquirement of dialectic by the pursuit of the arts\nanticipated in the allegory of the den.]\nBut the release of the prisoners from chains, and their translation from\nthe shadows to the images and to the light, and the ascent from the\nunderground den to the sun, while in his presence they are vainly trying\nto look on animals and plants and the light of the sun, but are able to\nperceive *532C* even with their weak eyes the images[6] in the water\n(which are divine), and are the shadows of true existence (not shadows of\nimages cast by a light of fire, which compared with the sun is only an\nimage)--this power of elevating the highest principle in the soul to the\ncontemplation of that which is best in existence, with which we may\ncompare the raising of that {236} faculty which is the very light of the\nbody to the sight of that which is brightest in the material and visible\nworld--this power is given, as I was saying, by all that study and pursuit\n*532D* of the arts which has been described.\n[Footnote 6: Omitting [Greek: e)ntau=tha de\\ pro\\s phanta/smata]. The word\n[Greek: thei=a] is bracketed by Stallbaum.]\nI agree in what you are saying, he replied, which may be hard to believe,\nyet, from another point of view, is harder still to deny. This, however,\nis not a theme to be treated of in passing only, but will have to be\ndiscussed again and again. And so, whether our conclusion be true or\nfalse, let us assume all this, and proceed at once from the prelude or\npreamble to the chief strain[7], and describe that in like manner. Say,\nthen, what is the nature and what are the divisions of *532E* dialectic,\nand what are the paths which lead thither; for these paths will also lead\nto our final rest.\n[Footnote 7: A play upon the word [Greek: no/mos], which means both 'law'\nand 'strain.']\n[Sidenote: The nature of dialectic can only be revealed to those who have\nbeen students of the preliminary sciences,]\n*533A* Dear Glaucon, I said, you will not be able to follow me here,\nthough I would do my best, and you should behold not an image only but the\nabsolute truth, according to my notion. Whether what I told you would or\nwould not have been a reality I cannot venture to say; but you would have\nseen something like reality; of that I am confident.\nDoubtless, he replied.\nBut I must also remind you, that the power of dialectic alone can reveal\nthis, and only to one who is a disciple of the previous sciences.\nOf that assertion you may be as confident as of the last.\n*533B* And assuredly no one will argue that there is any other method of\ncomprehending by any regular process all true existence or of ascertaining\nwhat each thing is in its own nature; for the arts in general are\nconcerned with the desires or opinions of men, or are cultivated with a\nview to production and construction, or for the preservation of such\nproductions and constructions; and as to the mathematical sciences which,\nas we were saying, have some apprehension of true being--geometry and the\nlike--they only dream about *533C* being, but never can they behold the\nwaking reality so long as they leave the hypotheses which they use\nunexamined, and are unable to give an account of them. For when a man\nknows not his own first principle, and when the conclusion {237} and\nintermediate steps are also constructed out of he knows not what, how can\nhe imagine that such a fabric of convention can ever become science?\nImpossible, he said.\n[Sidenote: which are her handmaids.]\nThen dialectic, and dialectic alone, goes directly to the first principle\nand is the only science which does away with hypotheses in order to make\nher ground secure; the eye of *533D* the soul, which is literally buried\nin an outlandish slough, is by her gentle aid lifted upwards; and she uses\nas handmaids and helpers in the work of conversion, the sciences which we\nhave been discussing. Custom terms them sciences, but they ought to have\nsome other name, implying greater clearness than opinion and less\nclearness than science: and this, in our previous sketch, was called\nunderstanding. But why *533E* should we dispute about names when we have\nrealities of such importance to consider?\nWhy indeed, he said, when any name will do which expresses the thought of\nthe mind with clearness?\n[Sidenote: Two divisions of the mind, intellect and opinion, each having\ntwo subdivisions.]\nAt any rate, we are satisfied, as before, to have four divisions; two for\nintellect and two for opinion, and to call the first division science, the\nsecond understanding, the third belief, and the fourth perception of\nshadows, opinion *534A* being concerned with becoming, and intellect with\nbeing; and so to make a proportion:--\nAs being is to becoming, so is pure intellect to opinion.\nAnd as intellect is to opinion, so is science to belief, and\nunderstanding to the perception of shadows.\nBut let us defer the further correlation and subdivision of the subjects\nof opinion and of intellect, for it will be a long enquiry, many times\nlonger than this has been.\n*534B* As far as I understand, he said, I agree.\nAnd do you also agree, I said, in describing the dialectician as one who\nattains a conception of the essence of each thing? And he who does not\npossess and is therefore unable to impart this conception, in whatever\ndegree he fails, may in that degree also be said to fail in intelligence?\nWill you admit so much?\nYes, he said; how can I deny it?\n[Sidenote: No truth which does not rest on the idea of good]\nAnd you would say the same of the conception of the good? Until the person\nis able to abstract and define rationally the {238} *534C* idea of good,\nand unless he can run the gauntlet of all objections, and is ready to\ndisprove them, not by appeals to opinion, but to absolute truth, never\nfaltering at any step of the argument--unless he can do all this, you\nwould say that he knows neither the idea of good nor any other good; he\napprehends only a shadow, if anything at all, which is given by opinion\nand not by science;--dreaming and slumbering in this life, before he is\nwell awake here, he *534D* arrives at the world below, and has his final\nquietus.\nIn all that I should most certainly agree with you.\nAnd surely you would not have the children of your ideal State, whom you\nare nurturing and educating--if the ideal ever becomes a reality--you\nwould not allow the future rulers to be like posts[8], having no reason in\nthem, and yet to be set in authority over the highest matters?\n[Footnote 8: [Greek: gramma/s]. literally 'lines,' probably the\nstarting-point of a race-course.]\nCertainly not.\nThen you will make a law that they shall have such an education as will\nenable them to attain the greatest skill in asking and answering\nquestions?\n*534E* Yes, he said, you and I together will make it.\n[Sidenote: ought to have a high place.]\nDialectic, then, as you will agree, is the coping-stone of the sciences,\nand is set over them; no other science can be *535A* placed higher--the\nnature of knowledge can no further go?\nI agree, he said.\nBut to whom we are to assign these studies, and in what way they are to be\nassigned, are questions which remain to be considered.\nYes, clearly.\nYou remember, I said, how the rulers were chosen before?\nCertainly, he said.\nThe same natures must still be chosen, and the preference again given to\nthe surest and the bravest, and, if possible, *535B* to the fairest; and,\nhaving noble and generous tempers, they should also have the natural gifts\nwhich will facilitate their education.\nAnd what are these?\n[Sidenote: The natural gifts which are required in the dialectician: a\ntowardly understanding; a good memory; strength of character;]\nSuch gifts as keenness and ready powers of acquisition; for the mind more\noften faints from the severity of study {239} than from the severity of\ngymnastics: the toil is more entirely the mind's own, and is not shared\nwith the body.\nVery true, he replied.\n*535C* Further, he of whom we are in search should have a good memory, and\nbe an unwearied solid man who is a lover of labour in any line; or he will\nnever be able to endure the great amount of bodily exercise and to go\nthrough all the intellectual discipline and study which we require of him.\nCertainly, he said; he must have natural gifts.\nThe mistake at present is, that those who study philosophy have no\nvocation, and this, as I was before saying, is the reason why she has\nfallen into disrepute: her true sons should take her by the hand and not\nbastards.\nWhat do you mean?\n[Sidenote: industry;]\n*535D* In the first place, her votary should not have a lame or halting\nindustry--I mean, that he should not be half industrious and half idle:\nas, for example, when a man is a lover of gymnastic and hunting, and all\nother bodily exercises, but a hater rather than a lover of the labour of\nlearning or listening or enquiring. Or the occupation to which he devotes\nhimself may be of an opposite kind, and he may have the other sort of\nlameness.\nCertainly, he said.\n[Sidenote: love of truth;]\nAnd as to truth, I said, is not a soul equally to be deemed *535E* halt\nand lame which hates voluntary falsehood and is extremely indignant at\nherself and others when they tell lies, but is patient of involuntary\nfalsehood, and does not mind wallowing like a swinish beast in the mire of\nignorance, and has no shame at being detected?\nTo be sure.\n[Sidenote: the moral virtues.]\n*536A* And, again, in respect of temperance, courage, magnificence, and\nevery other virtue, should we not carefully distinguish between the true\nson and the bastard? for where there is no discernment of such qualities\nstates and individuals unconsciously err; and the state makes a ruler, and\nthe individual a friend, of one who, being defective in some part of\nvirtue, is in a figure lame or a bastard.\nThat is very true, he said.\nAll these things, then, will have to be carefully considered *536B* by us;\nand if only those whom we introduce to this vast {240} system of education\nand training are sound in body and mind, justice herself will have nothing\nto say against us, and we shall be the saviours of the constitution and of\nthe State; but, if our pupils are men of another stamp, the reverse will\nhappen, and we shall pour a still greater flood of ridicule on philosophy\nthan she has to endure at present.\nThat would not be creditable.\n[Sidenote: Socrates plays a little with himself and his subject.]\nCertainly not, I said; and yet perhaps, in thus turning jest into earnest\nI am equally ridiculous.\nIn what respect?\n*536C* I had forgotten, I said, that we were not serious, and spoke with\ntoo much excitement. For when I saw philosophy so undeservedly trampled\nunder foot of men I could not help feeling a sort of indignation at the\nauthors of her disgrace: and my anger made me too vehement.\nIndeed! I was listening, and did not think so.\n[Sidenote: For the study of dialectic the young must be selected.]\nBut I, who am the speaker, felt that I was. And now let me remind you\nthat, although in our former selection we *536D* chose old men, we must\nnot do so in this. Solon was under a delusion when he said that a man when\nhe grows old may learn many things--for he can no more learn much than he\ncan run much; youth is the time for any extraordinary toil.\nOf course.\n[Sidenote: The preliminary studies should be commenced in childhood, but\nnever forced.]\nAnd, therefore, calculation and geometry and all the other elements of\ninstruction, which are a preparation for dialectic, should be presented to\nthe mind in childhood; not, however, under any notion of forcing our\nsystem of education.\nWhy not?\n*536E* Because a freeman ought not to be a slave in the acquisition of\nknowledge of any kind. Bodily exercise, when compulsory, does no harm to\nthe body; but knowledge which is acquired under compulsion obtains no hold\non the mind.\nVery true.\nThen, my good friend, I said, do not use compulsion, but *537A* let early\neducation be a sort of amusement; you will then be better able to find out\nthe natural bent.\nThat is a very rational notion, he said.\nDo you remember that the children, too, were to be taken {241} to see the\nbattle on horseback; and that if there were no danger they were to be\nbrought close up and, like young hounds, have a taste of blood given them?\nYes, I remember.\nThe same practice may be followed, I said, in all these things--labours,\nlessons, dangers--and he who is most at home in all of them ought to be\nenrolled in a select number.\n*537B* At what age?\n[Sidenote: The necessary gymnastics must be completed first.]\nAt the age when the necessary gymnastics are over: the period whether of\ntwo or three years which passes in this sort of training is useless for\nany other purpose; for sleep and exercise are unpropitious to learning;\nand the trial of who is first in gymnastic exercises is one of the most\nimportant tests to which our youth are subjected.\nCertainly, he replied.\n[Sidenote; At twenty years of age the disciples will begin to be taught\nthe correlation of the sciences.]\nAfter that time those who are selected from the class of twenty years old\nwill be promoted to higher honour, and the *537C* sciences which they\nlearned without any order in their early education will now be brought\ntogether, and they will be able to see the natural relationship of them to\none another and to true being.\nYes, he said, that is the only kind of knowledge which takes lasting root.\nYes, I said; and the capacity for such knowledge is the great criterion of\ndialectical talent: the comprehensive mind is always the dialectical.\nI agree with you, he said.\n[Sidenote: At thirty the most promising will be placed in a select class.]\nThese, I said, are the points which you must consider; *537D* and those\nwho have most of this comprehension, and who are most steadfast in their\nlearning, and in their military and other appointed duties, when they have\narrived at the age of thirty have to be chosen by you out of the select\nclass, and elevated to higher honour; and you will have to prove them by\nthe help of dialectic, in order to learn which of them is able to give up\nthe use of sight and the other senses, and in company with truth to attain\nabsolute being: And here, my friend, great caution is required.\nWhy great caution?\n[Sidenote: The growth of scepticism]\n*537E* Do you not remark, I said, how great is the evil which dialectic\nhas introduced? {242}\nWhat evil? he said.\nThe students of the art are filled with lawlessness.\nQuite true, he said.\nDo you think that there is anything so very unnatural or inexcusable in\ntheir case? or will you make allowance for them?\nIn what way make allowance?\n[Sidenote: in the minds of the young illustrated by the case of a\nsupposititious son,]\nI want you, I said, by way of parallel, to imagine a supposititious son\nwho is brought up in great wealth; he *538A* is one of a great and\nnumerous family, and has many flatterers. When he grows up to manhood, he\nlearns that his alleged are not his real parents; but who the real are he\nis unable to discover. Can you guess how he will be likely to behave\ntowards his flatterers and his supposed parents, first of all during the\nperiod when he is ignorant of the false relation, and then again when he\nknows? Or shall I guess for you?\nIf you please.\n[Sidenote: who ceases to honour his father when he discovers that he is\nnot his father.]\nThen I should say, that while he is ignorant of the truth *538B* he will\nbe likely to honour his father and his mother and his supposed relations\nmore than the flatterers; he will be less inclined to neglect them when in\nneed, or to do or say anything against them; and he will be less willing\nto disobey them in any important matter.\nHe will.\nBut when he has made the discovery, I should imagine that he would\ndiminish his honour and regard for them, and would become more devoted to\nthe flatterers; their influence over him would greatly increase; he would\nnow live after *538C* their ways, and openly associate with them, and,\nunless he were of an unusually good disposition, he would trouble himself\nno more about his supposed parents or other relations.\nWell, all that is very probable. But how is the image applicable to the\ndisciples of philosophy?\nIn this way: you know that there are certain principles about justice and\nhonour, which were taught us in childhood, and under their parental\nauthority we have been brought up, obeying and honouring them.\nThat is true.\n*538D* There are also opposite maxims and habits of pleasure {243} which\nflatter and attract the soul, but do not influence those of us who have\nany sense of right, and they continue to obey and honour the maxims of\ntheir fathers.\nTrue.\n[Sidenote: So men who begin to analyse the first principles of morality\ncease to respect them.]\nNow, when a man is in this state, and the questioning spirit asks what is\nfair or honourable, and he answers as the legislator has taught him, and\nthen arguments many and diverse refute his words, until he is driven into\nbelieving that nothing is honourable any more than dishonourable, or\n*538E* just and good any more than the reverse, and so of all the notions\nwhich he most valued, do you think that he will still honour and obey them\nas before?\nImpossible.\nAnd when he ceases to think them honourable and natural *539A* as\nheretofore, and he fails to discover the true, can he be expected to\npursue any life other than that which flatters his desires?\nHe cannot.\nAnd from being a keeper of the law he is converted into a breaker of it?\nUnquestionably.\nNow all this is very natural in students of philosophy such as I have\ndescribed, and also, as I was just now saying, most excusable.\nYes, he said; and, I may add, pitiable.\nTherefore, that your feelings may not be moved to pity about our citizens\nwho are now thirty years of age, every care must be taken in introducing\nthem to dialectic.\nCertainly.\n[Sidenote: Young men are fond of pulling truth to pieces and thus bring\ndisgrace upon themselves and upon philosophy.]\n*539B* There is a danger lest they should taste the dear delight too\nearly; for youngsters, as you may have observed, when they first get the\ntaste in their mouths, argue for amusement, and are always contradicting\nand refuting others in imitation of those who refute them; like\npuppy-dogs, they rejoice in pulling and tearing at all who come near them.\nYes, he said, there is nothing which they like better.\nAnd when they have made many conquests and received *539C* defeats at the\nhands of many, they violently and speedily get into a way of not believing\nanything which they believed before, and hence, not only they, but\nphilosophy and all that {244} relates to it is apt to have a bad name with\nthe rest of the world.\nToo true, he said.\n[Sidenote: The dialectician and the eristic.]\nBut when a man begins to get older, he will no longer be guilty of such\ninsanity; he will imitate the dialectician who is seeking for truth, and\nnot the eristic, who is contradicting for the sake of amusement; and the\ngreater moderation of his *539D* character will increase instead of\ndiminishing the honour of the pursuit.\nVery true, he said.\nAnd did we not make special provision for this, when we said that the\ndisciples of philosophy were to be orderly and steadfast, not, as now, any\nchance aspirant or intruder?\nVery true.\nSuppose, I said, the study of philosophy to take the place of gymnastics\nand to be continued diligently and earnestly and exclusively for twice the\nnumber of years which were passed in bodily exercise--will that be enough?\n*539E* Would you say six or four years? he asked.\n[Sidenote: The study of philosophy to continue for five years; 30-35.]\nSay five years, I replied; at the end of the time they must be sent down\nagain into the den and compelled to hold any military or other office\nwhich young men are qualified to hold: in this way they will get their\nexperience of life, and there will be an opportunity of trying whether,\nwhen they are drawn all manner of ways by temptation, they will stand firm\nor flinch.\n*540A* And how long is this stage of their lives to last?\n[Sidenote: During fifteen years, 35-50, they are to hold office.]\n[Sidenote: At the end of that time they are to live chiefly in the\ncontemplation of the good, but occasionally to return to politics.]\nFifteen years, I answered; and when they have reached fifty years of age,\nthen let those who still survive and have distinguished themselves in\nevery action of their lives and in every branch of knowledge come at last\nto their consummation: the time has now arrived at which they must raise\nthe eye of the soul to the universal light which lightens all things, and\nbehold the absolute good; for that is the pattern according to which they\nare to order the State and the *540B* lives of individuals, and the\nremainder of their own lives also; making philosophy their chief pursuit,\nbut, when their turn comes, toiling also at politics and ruling for the\npublic good, not as though they were performing some heroic {245} action,\nbut simply as a matter of duty; and when they have brought up in each\ngeneration others like themselves and left them in their place to be\ngovernors of the State, then they will depart to the Islands of the Blest\nand dwell there; and the city will give them public memorials and\nsacrifices *540C* and honour them, if the Pythian oracle consent, as\ndemigods, but if not, as in any case blessed and divine.\nYou are a sculptor, Socrates, and have made statues of our governors\nfaultless in beauty.\nYes, I said, Glaucon, and of our governesses too; for you must not suppose\nthat what I have been saying applies to men only and not to women as far\nas their natures can go.\nThere you are right, he said, since we have made them to share in all\nthings like the men.\n*540D* Well, I said, and you would agree (would you not?) that what has\nbeen said about the State and the government is not a mere dream, and\nalthough difficult not impossible, but only possible in the way which has\nbeen supposed; that is to say, when the true philosopher kings are born in\na State, one or more of them, despising the honours of this present world\nwhich they deem mean and worthless, esteeming above all things right and\nthe honour *540E* that springs from right, and regarding justice as the\ngreatest and most necessary of all things, whose ministers they are, and\nwhose principles will be exalted by them when they set in order their own\ncity?\nHow will they proceed?\n[Sidenote: Practical measures for the speedy foundation of the State.]\nThey will begin by sending out into the country all the *541A* inhabitants\nof the city who are more than ten years old, and will take possession of\ntheir children, who will be unaffected by the habits of their parents;\nthese they will train in their own habits and laws, I mean in the laws\nwhich we have given them: and in this way the State and constitution of\nwhich we were speaking will soonest and most easily attain happiness, and\nthe nation which has such a constitution will gain most.\nYes, that will be the best way. And I think, Socrates, *541B* that you\nhave very well described how, if ever, such a constitution might come into\nbeing. {246}\nEnough then of the perfect State, and of the man who bears its\nimage--there is no difficulty in seeing how we shall describe him.\nThere is no difficulty, he replied; and I agree with you in thinking that\nnothing more need be said.\nBOOK VIII.\n[Sidenote: _Republic VIII._ Socrates, Glaucon.]\n[Sidenote: Recapitulation of Book V.]\n*543A* And so, Glaucon, we have arrived at the conclusion that in the\nperfect State wives and children are to be in common; and that all\neducation and the pursuits of war and peace are also to be common, and the\nbest philosophers and the bravest warriors are to be their kings?\nThat, replied Glaucon, has been acknowledged.\n*543B* Yes, I said; and we have further acknowledged that the governors,\nwhen appointed themselves, will take their soldiers and place them in\nhouses such as we were describing, which are common to all, and contain\nnothing private, or individual; and about their property, you remember\nwhat we agreed?\nYes, I remember that no one was to have any of the ordinary possessions of\nmankind; they were to be warrior *543C* athletes and guardians, receiving\nfrom the other citizens, in lieu of annual payment, only their\nmaintenance, and they were to take care of themselves and of the whole\nState.\nTrue, I said; and now that this division of our task is concluded, let us\nfind the point at which we digressed, that we may return into the old\npath.\n[Sidenote: Return to the end of Book IV.]\nThere is no difficulty in returning; you implied, then as now, that you\nhad finished the description of the State: you said that such a State was\ngood, and that the man was good *543D* who answered to it, although, as\nnow appears, you had more *544A* excellent things to relate both of State\nand man. And you said further, that if this was the true form, then the\nothers were false; and of the false forms, you said, as I remember, that\nthere were four principal ones, and that their defects, and the defects of\nthe individuals corresponding to them, were worth examining. When we had\nseen all the individuals, and finally agreed as to who was the best and\nwho was the worst {248} of them, we were to consider whether the best was\nnot also the happiest, and the worst the most miserable. I asked you what\nwere the four forms of government of which *544B* you spoke, and then\nPolemarchus and Adeimantus put in their word; and you began again, and\nhave found your way to the point at which we have now arrived.\nYour recollection, I said, is most exact.\nThen, like a wrestler, he replied, you must put yourself again in the same\nposition; and let me ask the same questions, and do you give me the same\nanswer which you were about to give me then.\nYes, if I can, I will, I said.\nI shall particularly wish to hear what were the four constitutions of\nwhich you were speaking.\n[Sidenote: Four imperfect constitutions, the Cretan or Spartan, Oligarchy,\nDemocracy, Tyranny.]\n*544C* That question, I said, is easily answered: the four governments of\nwhich I spoke, so far as they have distinct names, are, first, those of\nCrete and Sparta, which are generally applauded; what is termed oligarchy\ncomes next; this is not equally approved, and is a form of government\nwhich teems with evils: thirdly, democracy, which naturally follows\noligarchy, although very different: and lastly comes tyranny, great and\nfamous, which differs from them all, and is the fourth and worst disorder\nof a State. I do not know, do you? of any other constitution which can be\nsaid to have a distinct character. *544D* There are lordships and\nprincipalities which are bought and sold, and some other intermediate\nforms of government. But these are nondescripts and may be found equally\namong Hellenes and among barbarians.\nYes, he replied, we certainly hear of many curious forms of government\nwhich exist among them.\n[Sidenote: States are like men, because they are made up of men.]\nDo you know, I said, that governments vary as the dispositions of men\nvary, and that there must be as many of the one as there are of the other?\nFor we cannot suppose that States are made of 'oak and rock,' and not out\nof the human natures which are in them, and which in a figure *544E* turn\nthe scale and draw other things after them?\nYes, he said, the States are as the men are; they grow out of human\ncharacters.\nThen if the constitutions of States are five, the dispositions of\nindividual minds will also be five? {249}\nCertainly.\nHim who answers to aristocracy, and whom we rightly *545A* call just and\ngood, we have already described.\nWe have.\nThen let us now proceed to describe the inferior sort of natures, being\nthe contentious and ambitious, who answer to the Spartan polity; also the\noligarchical, democratical, and tyrannical. Let us place the most just by\nthe side of the most unjust, and when we see them we shall be able to\ncompare the relative happiness or unhappiness of him who leads a life of\npure justice or pure injustice. The enquiry will then be completed. And we\nshall know whether we ought to pursue injustice, as Thrasymachus advises,\nor *545B* in accordance with the conclusions of the argument to prefer\njustice.\nCertainly, he replied, we must do as you say.\n[Sidenote: The State and the individual.]\nShall we follow our old plan, which we adopted with a view to clearness,\nof taking the State first and then proceeding to the individual, and begin\nwith the government of honour?--I know of no name for such a government\nother than timocracy, or perhaps timarchy. We will compare with this the\nlike character in the individual; and, after that, *545C* consider\noligarchy and the oligarchical man; and then again we will turn our\nattention to democracy and the democratical man; and lastly, we will go\nand view the city of tyranny, and once more take a look into the tyrant's\nsoul, and try to arrive at a satisfactory decision.\nThat way of viewing and judging of the matter will be very suitable.\n[Sidenote: How timocracy arises out of aristocracy.]\nFirst, then, I said, let us enquire how timocracy (the government of\nhonour) arises out of aristocracy (the government *545D* of the best).\nClearly, all political changes originate in divisions of the actual\ngoverning power; a government which is united, however small, cannot be\nmoved.\nVery true, he said.\nIn what way, then, will our city be moved, and in what manner will the two\nclasses of auxiliaries and rulers disagree among themselves or with one\nanother? Shall we, after the manner of Homer, pray the Muses to tell us\n'how discord *545E* first arose'? Shall we imagine them in solemn {250}\nmockery, to play and jest with us as if we were children, and to address\nus in a lofty tragic vein, making believe to be in earnest?\nHow would they address us?\n[Sidenote: The intelligence which is alloyed with sense will not know how\nto regulate births and deaths in accordance with the number which controls\nthem.]\n*546A* After this manner:--A city which is thus constituted can hardly be\nshaken; but, seeing that everything which has a beginning has also an end,\neven a constitution such as yours will not last for ever, but will in time\nbe dissolved. And this is the dissolution:--In plants that grow in the\nearth, as well as in animals that move on the earth's surface, fertility\nand sterility of soul and body occur when the circumferences of the\ncircles of each are completed, which in short-lived existences pass over a\nshort space, and in long-lived ones over a long space. But to the\nknowledge of human fecundity and sterility all the wisdom and education of\nyour rulers will not attain; *546B* the laws which regulate them will not\nbe discovered by an intelligence which is alloyed with sense, but will\nescape them, and they will bring children into the world when they ought\nnot. Now that which is of divine birth has a period which is contained in\na perfect number,[1] but the period of human birth is comprehended in a\nnumber in which first increments by involution and evolution [_or_ squared\nand cubed] obtaining three intervals and four terms of like and unlike,\nwaxing and waning numbers, make all the terms *546C* commensurable and\nagreeable to one another.[2] The base of these (3) with a third added (4)\nwhen combined with five (20) and raised to the third power furnishes two\nharmonies; the first a square which is a hundred times as great (400 =\n4 x 100),[3] and the other a figure having one side equal to the former,\nbut oblong,[4] consisting of a hundred numbers squared upon rational\ndiameters of a square (i.e. omitting fractions), the side of which is five\n(7 x 7 = 49 x 100 = 4900), each of them {251} being less by one (than the\nperfect square which includes the fractions, sc. 50) or less by[5] two\nperfect squares of irrational diameters (of a square the side of which is\nfive = 50 + 50 = 100); and a hundred cubes of three (27 x 100 = 2700 + 4900\n+ 400 = 8000). Now this number represents a geometrical figure which has\ncontrol over *546D* the good and evil of births. For when your guardians\nare ignorant of the law of births, and unite bride and bridegroom out of\nseason, the children will not be goodly or fortunate. And though only the\nbest of them will be appointed by their predecessors, still they will be\nunworthy to hold their fathers' places, and when they come into power as\nguardians, they will soon be found to fail in taking care of us, the\nMuses, first by under-valuing music; which neglect will soon extend to\ngymnastic; and hence the young men of your State will be less cultivated.\nIn the succeeding generation rulers will be appointed who have lost the\nguardian power of testing the metal of your *546E* different races, which,\nlike Hesiod's, are of gold and silver and brass and iron. And so iron will\nbe mingled with silver, *547A* and brass with gold, and hence there will\narise dissimilarity and inequality and irregularity, which always and in\nall places are causes of hatred and war. This the Muses affirm to be the\nstock from which discord has sprung, wherever arising; and this is their\nanswer to us.\n[Footnote 1: i.e. a cyclical number, such as 6, which is equal to the sum\nof its divisors 1, 2, 3, so that when the circle or time represented by 6\nis completed, the lesser times or rotations represented by 1, 2, 3 are\nalso completed.]\n[Footnote 2: Probably the numbers 3, 4, 5, 6 of which the three first =\nthe sides of the Pythagorean triangle. The terms will then be 3^3, 4^3,\n5^3, which together = 6^3 = 216.]\n[Footnote 3: Or the first a square which is 100 x 100 = 10,000. The whole\nnumber will then be 17,500 = a square of 100, and an oblong of 100 by 75.]\n[Footnote 4: Reading [Greek: prom\u00ea/k\u00ea de/].]\n[Footnote 5: Or, 'consisting of two numbers squared upon irrational\ndiameters,' &c. = 100. For other explanations of the passage see\nIntroduction.]\nYes, and we may assume that they answer truly.\nWhy, yes, I said, of course they answer truly; how can the Muses speak\nfalsely?\n*547B* And what do the Muses say next?\n[Sidenote: Then discord arose and individual took the place of common\nproperty.]\nWhen discord arose, then the two races were drawn different ways: the iron\nand brass fell to acquiring money and land and houses and gold and silver;\nbut the gold and silver races, not wanting money but having the true\nriches in their own nature, inclined towards virtue and the ancient order\nof things. There was a battle between them, and at last they agreed to\ndistribute their land and houses among *547C* individual owners; and they\nenslaved their friends and maintainers, whom they had formerly protected\nin the condition of freemen, and made of them subjects and servants; and\n{252} they themselves were engaged in war and in keeping a watch against\nthem.\nI believe that you have rightly conceived the origin of the change.\nAnd the new government which thus arises will be of a form intermediate\nbetween oligarchy and aristocracy?\nVery true.\nSuch will be the change, and after the change has been made, *547D* how\nwill they proceed? Clearly, the new State, being in a mean between\noligarchy and the perfect State, will partly follow one and partly the\nother, and will also have some peculiarities.\nTrue, he said.\nIn the honour given to rulers, in the abstinence of the warrior class from\nagriculture, handicrafts, and trade in general, in the institution of\ncommon meals, and in the attention paid to gymnastics and military\ntraining--in all these respects this State will resemble the former.\nTrue.\n[Sidenote: Timocracy will retain the military and reject the philosophical\ncharacter of the perfect State.]\n*547E* But in the fear of admitting philosophers to power, because they\nare no longer to be had simple and earnest, but are made up of mixed\nelements; and in turning from them to passionate and less complex\ncharacters, who are by nature *548A* fitted for war rather than peace; and\nin the value set by them upon military stratagems and contrivances, and in\nthe waging of everlasting wars--this State will be for the most part\npeculiar.\nYes.\n[Sidenote: The soldier class miserly and covetous.]\nYes, I said; and men of this stamp will be covetous of money, like those\nwho live in oligarchies; they will have, a fierce secret longing after\ngold and silver, which they will hoard in dark places, having magazines\nand treasuries of their own for the deposit and concealment of them; also\ncastles which are just nests for their eggs, and in which they *548B* will\nspend large sums on their wives, or on any others whom they please.\nThat is most true, he said.\nAnd they are miserly because they have no means of openly acquiring the\nmoney which they prize; they will spend that which is another man's on the\ngratification of {253} their desires, stealing their pleasures and running\naway like children from the law, their father: they have been schooled not\nby gentle influences but by force, for they have neglected her who is the\ntrue Muse, the companion of reason and *548C* philosophy, and have\nhonoured gymnastic more than music.\nUndoubtedly, he said, the form of government which you describe is a\nmixture of good and evil.\n[Sidenote: The spirit of ambition predominates in such States.]\nWhy, there is a mixture, I said; but one thing, and one thing only, is\npredominantly seen,--the spirit of contention and ambition; and these are\ndue to the prevalence of the passionate or spirited element.\nAssuredly, he said.\nSuch is the origin and such the character of this State, which has been\ndescribed in outline only; the more perfect *548D* execution was not\nrequired, for a sketch is enough to show the type of the most perfectly\njust and most perfectly unjust; and to go through all the States and all\nthe characters of men, omitting none of them, would be an interminable\nlabour.\nVery true, he replied.\n[Sidenote: Socrates, Adeimantus.]\n[Sidenote: The timocratic man, uncultured, but fond of culture, ambitious,\ncontentious, rough with slaves, and courteous to freemen; a soldier,\nathlete, hunter; a despiser of riches while young, fond of them when he\ngrows old.]\nNow what man answers to this form of government--how did he come into\nbeing, and what is he like?\nI think, said Adeimantus, that in the spirit of contention which\ncharacterises him, he is not unlike our friend Glaucon.\n*548E* Perhaps, I said, he may be like him in that one point; but there\nare other respects in which he is very different.\nIn what respects?\nHe should have more of self-assertion and be less cultivated, and yet a\nfriend of culture; and he should be a good *549A* listener, but no\nspeaker. Such a person is apt to be rough with slaves, unlike the educated\nman, who is too proud for that; and he will also be courteous to freemen,\nand remarkably obedient to authority; he is a lover of power and a lover\nof honour; claiming to be a ruler, not because he is eloquent, or on any\nground of that sort, but because he is a soldier and has performed feats\nof arms; he is also a lover of gymnastic exercises and of the chase.\nYes, that is the type of character which answers to timocracy.\nSuch an one will despise riches only when he is young; {254} *549B* but as\nhe gets older he will be more and more attracted to them, because he has a\npiece of the avaricious nature in him, and is not single-minded towards\nvirtue, having lost his best guardian.\nWho was that? said Adeimantus.\nPhilosophy, I said, tempered with music, who comes and takes up her abode\nin a man, and is the only saviour of his virtue throughout life.\nGood, he said.\nSuch, I said, is the timocratical youth, and he is like the timocratical\nState.\n*549C* Exactly.\nHis origin is as follows:--He is often the young son of a brave father,\nwho dwells in an ill-governed city, of which he declines the honours and\noffices, and will not go to law, or exert himself in any way, but is ready\nto waive his rights in order that he may escape trouble.\nAnd how does the son come into being?\n[Sidenote: The timocratic man often originates in a reaction against his\nfather's character, which is encouraged by his mother,]\nThe character of the son begins to develope when he hears his mother\ncomplaining that her husband has no place in the government, of which the\nconsequence is that she has *549D* no precedence among other women.\nFurther, when she sees her husband not very eager about money, and instead\nof battling and railing in the law courts or assembly, taking whatever\nhappens to him quietly; and when she observes that his thoughts always\ncentre in himself, while he treats her with very considerable\nindifference, she is annoyed, and says to her son that his father is only\nhalf a man and far too easy-going: adding all the other complaints about\nher own *549E* ill-treatment which women are so fond of rehearsing.\nYes, said Adeimantus, they give us plenty of them, and their complaints\nare so like themselves.\n[Sidenote: and by the old servants of the household.]\nAnd you know, I said, that the old servants also, who are supposed to be\nattached to the family, from time to time talk privately in the same\nstrain to the son; and if they see any one who owes money to his father,\nor is wronging him in any way, and he fails to prosecute them, they tell\nthe youth that *550A* when he grows up he must retaliate upon people of\nthis sort, and be more of a man than his father. He has only to walk\nabroad and he hears and sees the same sort of thing: those {255} who do\ntheir own business in the city are called simpletons, and held in no\nesteem, while the busy-bodies are honoured and applauded. The result is\nthat the young man, hearing and seeing all these things--hearing, too, the\nwords of his father, and having a nearer view of his way of life, and\nmaking comparisons of him and others--is drawn opposite ways: *550B* while\nhis father is watering and nourishing the rational principle in his soul,\nthe others are encouraging the passionate and appetitive; and he being not\noriginally of a bad nature, but having kept bad company, is at last\nbrought by their joint influence to a middle point, and gives up the\nkingdom which is within him to the middle principle of contentiousness and\npassion, and becomes arrogant and ambitious.\nYou seem to me to have described his origin perfectly.\n*550C* Then we have now, I said, the second form of government and the\nsecond type of character?\nWe have.\nNext, let us look at another man who, as Aeschylus says,\n'Is set over against another State;'\nor rather, as our plan requires, begin with the State.\nBy all means.\n[Sidenote: Oligarchy]\nI believe that oligarchy follows next in order.\nAnd what manner of government do you term oligarchy?\nA government resting on a valuation of property, in which *550D* the rich\nhave power and the poor man is deprived of it.\nI understand, he replied.\nOught I not to begin by describing how the change from timocracy to\noligarchy arises?\nYes.\nWell, I said, no eyes are required in order to see how the one passes into\nthe other.\nHow?\n[Sidenote: arises out of increased accumulation and increased expenditure\namong the citizens.]\nThe accumulation of gold in the treasury of private individuals is the\nruin of timocracy; they invent illegal modes of expenditure; for what do\nthey or their wives care about the law?\nYes, indeed.\n*550E* And then one, seeing another grow rich, seeks to rival {256} him,\nand thus the great mass of the citizens become lovers of money.\nLikely enough.\n[Sidenote: As riches increase, virtue decreases: the one is honoured, the\nother despised; the one cultivated, the other neglected.]\nAnd so they grow richer and richer, and the more they think of making a\nfortune the less they think of virtue; for when riches and virtue are\nplaced together in the scales of the balance, the one always rises as the\nother falls.\nTrue.\n*551A* And in proportion as riches and rich men are honoured in the State,\nvirtue and the virtuous are dishonoured.\nClearly.\nAnd what is honoured is cultivated, and that which has no honour is\nneglected.\nThat is obvious.\nAnd so at last, instead of loving contention and glory, men become lovers\nof trade and money; they honour and look up to the rich man, and make a\nruler of him, and dishonour the poor man.\nThey do so.\n[Sidenote: In an oligarchy a money qualification is established.]\nThey next proceed to make a law which fixes a sum *551B* of money as the\nqualification of citizenship; the sum is higher in one place and lower in\nanother, as the oligarchy is more or less exclusive; and they allow no one\nwhose property falls below the amount fixed to have any share in the\ngovernment. These changes in the constitution they effect by force of\narms, if intimidation has not already done their work.\nVery true.\nAnd this, speaking generally, is the way in which oligarchy is\nestablished.\nYes, he said; but what are the characteristics of this form *551C* of\ngovernment, and what are the defects of which we were speaking[6]?\n[Footnote 6: Cp. supra, 544 C.]\n[Sidenote: A ruler is elected because he is rich: Who would elect a pilot\non this principle?]\nFirst of all, I said, consider the nature of the qualification. Just think\nwhat would happen if pilots were to be chosen according to their property,\nand a poor man were refused permission to steer, even though he were a\nbetter pilot?\nYou mean that they would shipwreck?\nYes; and is not this true of the government of anything[7]? {257}\n[Footnote 7: Omitting [Greek: \u00ea)/ tinos].]\nI should imagine so.\nExcept a city?--or would you include a city?\nNay, he said, the case of a city is the strongest of all, inasmuch as the\nrule of a city is the greatest and most difficult of all.\n*551D* This, then, will be the first great defect of oligarchy?\nClearly.\nAnd here is another defect which is quite as bad.\nWhat defect?\n[Sidenote: The extreme division of classes in such a State.]\nThe inevitable division: such a State is not one, but two States, the one\nof poor, the other of rich men; and they are living on the same spot and\nalways conspiring against one another.\nThat, surely, is at least as bad.\n[Sidenote: They dare not go to war.]\nAnother discreditable feature is, that, for a like reason, they are\nincapable of carrying on any war. Either they arm *551E* the multitude,\nand then they are more afraid of them than of the enemy; or, if they do\nnot call them out in the hour of battle, they are oligarchs indeed, few to\nfight as they are few to rule. And at the same time their fondness for\nmoney makes them unwilling to pay taxes.\nHow discreditable!\nAnd, as we said before, under such a constitution the *552A* same persons\nhave too many callings--they are husbandmen, tradesmen, warriors, all in\none. Does that look well?\nAnything but well.\nThere is another evil which is, perhaps, the greatest of all, and to which\nthis State first begins to be liable.\nWhat evil?\n[Sidenote: The ruined man, who has no occupation, once a spendthrift, now\na pauper, still exists in the State.]\nA man may sell all that he has, and another may acquire his property; yet\nafter the sale he may dwell in the city of which he is no longer a part,\nbeing neither trader, nor artisan, nor horseman, nor hoplite, but only a\npoor, helpless creature.\n*552B* Yes, that is an evil which also first begins in this State.\nThe evil is certainly not prevented there; for oligarchies have both the\nextremes of great wealth and utter poverty.\nTrue.\nBut think again: In his wealthy days, while he was spending his money, was\na man of this sort a whit more good to the State for the purposes of\ncitizenship? Or {258} did he only seem to be a member of the ruling body,\nalthough in truth he was neither ruler nor subject, but just a\nspendthrift?\n*552C* As you say, he seemed to be a ruler, but was only a spendthrift.\nMay we not say that this is the drone in the house who is like the drone\nin the honeycomb, and that the one is the plague of the city as the other\nis of the hive?\nJust so, Socrates.\nAnd God has made the flying drones, Adeimantus, all without stings,\nwhereas of the walking drones he has made some without stings but others\nhave dreadful stings; of the stingless class are those who in their old\nage end as paupers; *552D* of the stingers come all the criminal class, as\nthey are termed.\nMost true, he said.\n[Sidenote: Where there are paupers, there are thieves]\nClearly then, whenever you see paupers in a State, somewhere in that\nneighbourhood there are hidden away thieves, and cut-purses and robbers of\ntemples, and all sorts of malefactors.\nClearly.\nWell, I said, and in oligarchical States do you not find paupers?\nYes, he said; nearly everybody is a pauper who is not a ruler.\n[Sidenote: and other criminals.]\n*552E* And may we be so bold as to affirm that there are also many\ncriminals to be found in them, rogues who have stings, and whom the\nauthorities are careful to restrain by force?\nCertainly, we may be so bold.\nThe existence of such persons is to be attributed to want of education,\nill-training, and an evil constitution of the State?\nTrue.\nSuch, then, is the form and such are the evils of oligarchy; and there may\nbe many other evils.\nVery likely.\n*553A* Then oligarchy, or the form of government in which the rulers are\nelected for their wealth, may now be dismissed. Let us next proceed to\nconsider the nature and origin of the individual who answers to this\nState. {259}\nBy all means.\nDoes not the timocratical man change into the oligarchical on this wise?\nHow?\n[Sidenote: The ruin of the timocratical man gives birth to the\noligarchical.]\nA time arrives when the representative of timocracy has a son: at first he\nbegins by emulating his father and walking in his footsteps, but presently\nhe sees him of a sudden *553B* foundering against the State as upon a\nsunken reef, and he and all that he has is lost; he may have been a\ngeneral or some other high officer who is brought to trial under a\nprejudice raised by informers, and either put to death, or exiled, or\ndeprived of the privileges of a citizen, and all his property taken from\nhim.\nNothing more likely.\n[Sidenote: His son begins life a ruined man and takes to money-making.]\nAnd the son has seen and known all this--he is a ruined man, and his fear\nhas taught him to knock ambition and *553C* passion headforemost from his\nbosom's throne; humbled by poverty he takes to money-making and by mean\nand miserly savings and hard work gets a fortune together. Is not such an\none likely to seat the concupiscent and covetous element on the vacant\nthrone and to suffer it to play the great king within him, girt with tiara\nand chain and scimitar?\nMost true, he replied.\n*553D* And when he has made reason and spirit sit down on the ground\nobediently on either side of their sovereign, and taught them to know\ntheir place, he compels the one to think only of how lesser sums may be\nturned into larger ones, and will not allow the other to worship and\nadmire anything but riches and rich men, or to be ambitious of anything so\nmuch as the acquisition of wealth and the means of acquiring it.\nOf all changes, he said, there is none so speedy or so sure as the\nconversion of the ambitious youth into the avaricious one.\n*553E* And the avaricious, I said, is the oligarchical youth?\n[Sidenote: The oligarchical man and State resemble one another in their\nestimation of wealth: In their toiling and saving ways, in their want of\ncultivation.]\nYes, he said; at any rate the individual out of whom he came is like the\nState out of which oligarchy came.\nLet us then consider whether there is any likeness between them.\n*554A* Very good.\nFirst, then, they resemble one another in the value which they set upon\nwealth? {260}\nCertainly.\nAlso in their penurious, laborious character; the individual only\nsatisfies his necessary appetites, and confines his expenditure to them;\nhis other desires he subdues, under the idea that they are unprofitable.\nTrue.\nHe is a shabby fellow, who saves something out of everything and makes a\npurse for himself; and this is the sort of *554B* man whom the vulgar\napplaud. Is he not a true image of the State which he represents?\nHe appears to me to be so; at any rate money is highly valued by him as\nwell as by the State.\nYou see that he is not a man of cultivation, I said.\nI imagine not, he said; had he been educated he would never have made a\nblind god director of his chorus, or given him chief honour[8].\n[Footnote 8: Reading [Greek: kai\\ e)ti/ma ma/lista. Eu)=, \u00ea)= d' e)g\u00f4/],\naccording to Schneider's excellent emendation.]\nExcellent! I said. Yet consider: Must we not further admit that owing to\nthis want of cultivation there will be *554C* found in him dronelike\ndesires as of pauper and rogue, which are forcibly kept down by his\ngeneral habit of life?\nTrue.\nDo you know where you will have to look if you want to discover his\nrogueries?\nWhere must I look?\n[Sidenote: The oligarchical man keeps up a fair outside, but he has only\nan enforced virtue and will cheat when he can.]\nYou should see him where he has some great opportunity of acting\ndishonestly, as in the guardianship of an orphan.\nAye.\nIt will be clear enough then that in his ordinary dealings which give him\na reputation for honesty he coerces his bad *554D* passions by an enforced\nvirtue; not making them see that they are wrong, or taming them by reason,\nbut by necessity and fear constraining them, and because he trembles for\nhis possessions.\nTo be sure.\nYes, indeed, my dear friend, but you will find that the natural desires of\nthe drone commonly exist in him all the same whenever he has to spend what\nis not his own. {261}\nYes, and they will be strong in him too.\nThe man, then, will be at war with himself; he will be two men, and not\none; but, in general, his better desires *554E* will be found to prevail\nover his inferior ones.\nTrue.\nFor these reasons such an one will be more respectable than most people;\nyet the true virtue of a unanimous and harmonious soul will flee far away\nand never come near him.\nI should expect so.\n[Sidenote: His meanness in a contest; he saves his money and loses the\nprize.]\n*555A* And surely, the miser individually will be an ignoble competitor in\na State for any prize of victory, or other object of honourable ambition;\nhe will not spend his money in the contest for glory; so afraid is he of\nawakening his expensive appetites and inviting them to help and join in\nthe struggle; in true oligarchical fashion he fights with a small part\nonly of his resources, and the result commonly is that he loses the prize\nand saves his money.\nVery true.\nCan we any longer doubt, then, that the miser and money-maker *555B*\nanswers to the oligarchical State?\nThere can be no doubt.\n[Sidenote: Democracy arises out of the extravagance and indebtedness of\nmen of family and position,]\nNext comes democracy; of this the origin and nature have still to be\nconsidered by us; and then we will enquire into the ways of the democratic\nman, and bring him up for judgment.\nThat, he said, is our method.\nWell, I said, and how does the change from oligarchy into democracy arise?\nIs it not on this wise?--The good at which such a State aims is to become\nas rich as possible, a desire which is insatiable?\nWhat then?\n*555C* The rulers, being aware that their power rests upon their wealth,\nrefuse to curtail by law the extravagance of the spendthrift youth because\nthey gain by their ruin; they take interest from them and buy up their\nestates and thus increase their own wealth and importance?\nTo be sure.\nThere can be no doubt that the love of wealth and the spirit of moderation\ncannot exist together in citizens of the same state to any considerable\nextent; one or the other will *555D* be disregarded. {262}\nThat is tolerably clear.\nAnd in oligarchical States, from the general spread of carelessness and\nextravagance, men of good family have often been reduced to beggary?\nYes, often.\n[Sidenote: who remain in the city, and form a dangerous class ready to\nhead a revolution.]\nAnd still they remain in the city; there they are, ready to sting and\nfully armed, and some of them owe money, some have forfeited their\ncitizenship; a third class are in both predicaments; and they hate and\nconspire against those who have got their property, and against everybody\nelse, and are *555E* eager for revolution.\nThat is true.\nOn the other hand, the men of business, stooping as they walk, and\npretending not even to see those whom they have already ruined, insert\ntheir sting--that is, their money--into some one else who is not on his\nguard against them, and recover the parent sum many times over multiplied\ninto a family of children: and so they make drone and pauper to abound in\nthe State.\n*556A* Yes, he said, there are plenty of them--that is certain.\n[Sidenote: Two remedies: (1) restrictions on the free use of property;]\nThe evil blazes up like a fire; and they will not extinguish it, either by\nrestricting a man's use of his own property, or by another remedy:\nWhat other?\n[Sidenote: (2) contracts to be made at a man's own risk.]\nOne which is the next best, and has the advantage of compelling the\ncitizens to look to their characters:--Let *556B* there be a general rule\nthat every one shall enter into voluntary contracts at his own risk, and\nthere will be less of this scandalous money-making, and the evils of which\nwe were speaking will be greatly lessened in the State.\nYes, they will be greatly lessened.\nAt present the governors, induced by the motives which I have named, treat\ntheir subjects badly; while they and their adherents, especially the young\nmen of the governing class, are habituated to lead a life of luxury and\nidleness *556C* both of body and mind; they do nothing, and are incapable\nof resisting either pleasure or pain.\nVery true.\nThey themselves care only for making money, and are as indifferent as the\npauper to the cultivation of virtue. {263}\nYes, quite as indifferent.\n[Sidenote: The subjects discover the weakness of their rulers.]\nSuch is the state of affairs which prevails among them. And often rulers\nand their subjects may come in one another's way, whether on a journey or\non some other occasion of meeting, on a pilgrimage or a march, as\nfellow-soldiers or *556D* fellow-sailors; aye, and they may observe the\nbehaviour of each other in the very moment of danger--for where danger is,\nthere is no fear that the poor will be despised by the rich--and very\nlikely the wiry sunburnt poor man may be placed in battle at the side of a\nwealthy one who has never spoilt his complexion and has plenty of\nsuperfluous flesh--when he sees such an one puffing and at his wits' end,\nhow can he avoid drawing the conclusion that men like him are only rich\nbecause no one has the courage to despoil them? And when they meet in\nprivate will not people be *556E* saying to one another 'Our warriors are\nnot good for much'?\nYes, he said, I am quite aware that this is their way of talking.\n[Sidenote: A slight cause, internal or external, may produce revolution.]\nAnd, as in a body which is diseased the addition of a touch from without\nmay bring on illness, and sometimes even when there is no external\nprovocation a commotion may arise within--in the same way wherever there\nis weakness in the State there is also likely to be illness, of which the\noccasion may be very slight, the one party introducing from without their\noligarchical, the other their democratical allies, and then the State\nfalls sick, and is at war with herself; and *557A* may be at times\ndistracted, even when there is no external cause.\nYes, surely.\n[Sidenote: Such is the origin and nature of democracy.]\nAnd then democracy comes into being after the poor have conquered their\nopponents, slaughtering some and banishing some, while to the remainder\nthey give an equal share of freedom and power; and this is the form of\ngovernment in which the magistrates are commonly elected by lot.\nYes, he said, that is the nature of democracy, whether the revolution has\nbeen effected by arms, or whether fear has caused the opposite party to\nwithdraw.\nAnd now what is their manner of life, and what sort of *557B* a government\nhave they? for as the government is, such will be the man.\nClearly, he said. {264}\n[Sidenote: Democracy allows a man to do as he likes, and therefore\ncontains the greatest variety of characters and constitutions.]\nIn the first place, are they not free; and is not the city full of freedom\nand frankness--a man may say and do what he likes?\n'Tis said so, he replied.\nAnd where freedom is, the individual is clearly able to order for himself\nhis own life as he pleases?\nClearly.\n*557C* Then in this kind of State there will be the greatest variety of\nhuman natures?\nThere will.\nThis, then, seems likely to be the fairest of States, being like an\nembroidered robe which is spangled with every sort of flower[9]. And just\nas women and children think a variety of colours to be of all things most\ncharming, so there are many men to whom this State, which is spangled with\nthe manners and characters of mankind, will appear to be the fairest of\nStates.\n[Footnote 9: Omitting [Greek: ti/ m\u00ea/n; e)/ph\u00ea].]\nYes.\n*557D* Yes, my good Sir, and there will be no better in which to look for\na government.\nWhy?\nBecause of the liberty which reigns there--they have a complete assortment\nof constitutions; and he who has a mind to establish a State, as we have\nbeen doing, must go to a democracy as he would to a bazaar at which they\nsell them, and pick out the one that suits him; then, when he has made his\nchoice, he may found his State.\n*557E* He will be sure to have patterns enough.\n[Sidenote: The law falls into abeyance.]\nAnd there being no necessity, I said, for you to govern in this State,\neven if you have the capacity, or to be governed, unless you like, or go\nto war when the rest go to war, or to be at peace when others are at\npeace, unless you are so disposed--there being no necessity also, because\nsome law forbids you to hold office or be a dicast, that you should not\nhold office or be a dicast, if you have a fancy--is not *558A* this a way\nof life which for the moment is supremely delightful?\nFor the moment, yes. {265}\nAnd is not their humanity to the condemned[10] in some cases quite\ncharming? Have you not observed how, in a democracy, many persons,\nalthough they have been sentenced to death or exile, just stay where they\nare and walk about the world--the gentleman parades like a hero, and\nnobody sees or cares?\n[Footnote 10: Or, 'the philosophical temper of the condemned.']\nYes, he replied, many and many a one.\n[Sidenote: All principles of order and good taste are trampled under foot\nby democracy.]\n*558B* See too, I said, the forgiving spirit of democracy, and the 'don't\ncare' about trifles, and the disregard which she shows of all the fine\nprinciples which we solemnly laid down at the foundation of the city--as\nwhen we said that, except in the case of some rarely gifted nature, there\nnever will be a good man who has not from his childhood been used to play\namid things of beauty and make of them a joy and a study--how grandly does\nshe trample all these fine notions of ours under her feet, never giving a\nthought to the pursuits which make a statesman, and promoting to honour\nany one who professes *558C* to be the people's friend.\nYes, she is of a noble spirit.\nThese and other kindred characteristics are proper to democracy, which is\na charming form of government, full of variety and disorder, and\ndispensing a sort of equality to equals and unequals alike.\nWe know her well.\nConsider now, I said, what manner of man the individual is, or rather\nconsider, as in the case of the State, how he comes into being.\nVery good, he said.\nIs not this the way--he is the son of the miserly and oligarchical *558D*\nfather who has trained him in his own habits?\nExactly.\n[Sidenote: Which are the necessary and which the unnecessary pleasures?]\nAnd, like his father, he keeps under by force the pleasures which are of\nthe spending and not of the getting sort, being those which are called\nunnecessary?\nObviously.\nWould you like, for the sake of clearness, to distinguish which are the\nnecessary and which are the unnecessary pleasures?\nI should. {266}\n[Sidenote: Necessary desires cannot be got rid of,]\nAre not necessary pleasures those of which we cannot get *558E* rid, and\nof which the satisfaction is a benefit to us? And they are rightly called\nso, because we are framed by nature to desire both what is beneficial and\nwhat is necessary, and cannot help it.\nTrue.\n*559A* We are not wrong therefore in calling them necessary?\nWe are not.\nAnd the desires of which a man may get rid, if he takes pains from his\nyouth upwards--of which the presence, moreover, does no good, and in some\ncases the reverse of good--shall we not be right in saying that all these\nare unnecessary?\nYes, certainly.\nSuppose we select an example of either kind, in order that we may have a\ngeneral notion of them?\nVery good.\nWill not the desire of eating, that is, of simple food and condiments, in\nso far as they are required for health and *559B* strength, be of the\nnecessary class?\nThat is what I should suppose.\nThe pleasure of eating is necessary in two ways; it does us good and it is\nessential to the continuance of life?\nYes.\n[Sidenote: but may be indulged to excess.]\nBut the condiments are only necessary in so far as they are good for\nhealth?\nCertainly.\n[Sidenote: Illustration taken from eating and drinking.]\nAnd the desire which goes beyond this, of more delicate food, or other\nluxuries, which might generally be got rid of, if controlled and trained\nin youth, and is hurtful to the body, and hurtful to the soul in the\npursuit of wisdom and virtue, may be *559C* rightly called unnecessary?\nVery true.\nMay we not say that these desires spend, and that the others make money\nbecause they conduce to production?\nCertainly.\nAnd of the pleasures of love, and all other pleasures, the same holds\ngood?\nTrue.\nAnd the drone of whom we spoke was he who was surfeited in pleasures and\ndesires of this sort, and was the slave {267} *559D* of the unnecessary\ndesires, whereas he who was subject to the necessary only was miserly and\noligarchical?\nVery true.\nAgain, let us see how the democratical man grows out of the oligarchical:\nthe following, as I suspect, is commonly the process.\nWhat is the process?\n[Sidenote: The young oligarch is led away by his wild associates.]\nWhen a young man who has been brought up as we were just now describing,\nin a vulgar and miserly way, has tasted drones' honey and has come to\nassociate with fierce and crafty natures who are able to provide for him\nall sorts of refinements and varieties of pleasure--then, as you may\n*559E* imagine, the change will begin of the oligarchical principle within\nhim into the democratical?\nInevitably.\n[Sidenote: There are allies to either part of his nature.]\nAnd as in the city like was helping like, and the change was effected by\nan alliance from without assisting one division of the citizens, so too\nthe young man is changed by a class of desires coming from without to\nassist the desires within him, that which is akin and alike again helping\nthat which is akin and alike?\nCertainly.\nAnd if there be any ally which aids the oligarchical principle within him,\nwhether the influence of a father or of kindred, *560A* advising or\nrebuking him, then there arises in his soul a faction and an opposite\nfaction, and he goes to war with himself.\nIt must be so.\nAnd there are times when the democratical principle gives way to the\noligarchical, and some of his desires die, and others are banished; a\nspirit of reverence enters into the young man's soul and order is\nrestored.\nYes, he said, that sometimes happens.\nAnd then, again, after the old desires have been driven out, *560B* fresh\nones spring up, which are akin to them, and because he their father does\nnot know how to educate them, wax fierce and numerous.\nYes, he said, that is apt to be the way.\nThey draw him to his old associates, and holding secret intercourse with\nthem, breed and multiply in him. {268}\nVery true.\nAt length they seize upon the citadel of the young man's soul, which they\nperceive to be void of all accomplishments and fair pursuits and true\nwords, which make their abode in the minds of men who are dear to the\ngods, and are their best guardians and sentinels.\n*560C* None better.\nFalse and boastful conceits and phrases mount upwards and take their\nplace.\nThey are certain to do so.\n[Sidenote: The progress of the oligarchic young man told in an allegory.]\nAnd so the young man returns into the country of the lotus-eaters, and\ntakes up his dwelling there in the face of all men; and if any help be\nsent by his friends to the oligarchical part of him, the aforesaid vain\nconceits shut the gate of the king's fastness; and they will neither allow\nthe embassy itself to enter, nor if private advisers offer the fatherly\ncounsel of the aged will they listen to them or receive them. *560D* There\nis a battle and they gain the day, and then modesty, which they call\nsilliness, is ignominiously thrust into exile by them, and temperance,\nwhich they nickname unmanliness, is trampled in the mire and cast forth;\nthey persuade men that moderation and orderly expenditure are vulgarity\nand meanness, and so, by the help of a rabble of evil appetites, they\ndrive them beyond the border.\nYes, with a will.\nAnd when they have emptied and swept clean the soul of *560E* him who is\nnow in their power and who is being initiated by them in great mysteries,\nthe next thing is to bring back to their house insolence and anarchy and\nwaste and impudence in bright array having garlands on their heads, and a\ngreat company with them, hymning their praises and calling *561A* them by\nsweet names; insolence they term breeding, and anarchy liberty, and waste\nmagnificence, and impudence courage. And so the young man passes out of\nhis original nature, which was trained in the school of necessity, into\nthe freedom and libertinism of useless and unnecessary pleasures.\nYes, he said, the change in him is visible enough.\n[Sidenote: He becomes a rake; but he also sometimes stops short in his\ncareer and gives way to pleasures good and bad indifferently.]\nAfter this he lives on, spending his money and labour and time on\nunnecessary pleasures quite as much as on necessary {269} ones; but if he\nbe fortunate, and is not too much disordered in his wits, when years have\nelapsed, and the heyday of *561B* passion is over--supposing that he then\nre-admits into the city some part of the exiled virtues, and does not\nwholly give himself up to their successors--in that case he balances his\npleasures and lives in a sort of equilibrium, putting the government of\nhimself into the hands of the one which comes first and wins the turn; and\nwhen he has had enough of that, then into the hands of another; he\ndespises none of them but encourages them all equally.\nVery true, he said.\n[Sidenote: He rejects all advice,]\nNeither does he receive or let pass into the fortress any true word of\nadvice; if any one says to him that some *561C* pleasures are the\nsatisfactions of good and noble desires, and others of evil desires, and\nthat he ought to use and honour some and chastise and master the others\n--whenever this is repeated to him he shakes his head and says that they\nare all alike, and that one is as good as another.\nYes, he said; that is the way with him.\n[Sidenote: passing his life in the alternation from one extreme to\nanother.]\nYes, I said, he lives from day to day indulging the appetite of the hour;\nand sometimes he is lapped in drink and strains of the flute; then he\nbecomes a water-drinker, and tries to get thin; *561D* then he takes a\nturn at gymnastics; sometimes idling and neglecting everything, then once\nmore living the life of a philosopher; often he is busy with politics, and\nstarts to his feet and says and does whatever comes into his head; and, if\nhe is emulous of any one who is a warrior, off he is in that direction, or\nof men of business, once more in that. His life has neither law nor order;\nand this distracted existence he terms joy and bliss and freedom; and so\nhe goes on.\n*561E* Yes, he replied, he is all liberty and equality.\n[Sidenote: He is 'not one, but all mankind's epitome.']\nYes, I said; his life is motley and manifold and an epitome of the lives\nof many;--he answers to the State which we described as fair and spangled.\nAnd many a man and many a woman will take him for their pattern, and many\na constitution and many an example of manners is contained in him.\nJust so.\n*561A* Let him then be set over against democracy; he may truly be called\nthe democratic man. {270}\nLet that be his place, he said.\n[Sidenote: Tyranny and the tyrant.]\nLast of all comes the most beautiful of all, man and State alike, tyranny\nand the tyrant; these we have now to consider.\nQuite true, he said.\nSay then, my friend, In what manner does tyranny arise?--that it has a\ndemocratic origin is evident.\nClearly.\nAnd does not tyranny spring from democracy in the *562B* same manner as\ndemocracy from oligarchy--I mean, after a sort?\nHow?\n[Sidenote: The insatiable desire of wealth creates a demand for democracy,\nthe insatiable desire of freedom creates a demand for tyranny.]\nThe good which oligarchy proposed to itself and the means by which it was\nmaintained was excess of wealth--am I not right?\nYes.\nAnd the insatiable desire of wealth and the neglect of all other things\nfor the sake of money-getting was also the ruin of oligarchy?\nTrue.\nAnd democracy has her own good, of which the insatiable desire brings her\nto dissolution?\nWhat good?\nFreedom, I replied; which, as they tell you in a democracy, *562C* is the\nglory of the State--and that therefore in a democracy alone will the\nfreeman of nature deign to dwell.\nYes; the saying is in every body's mouth.\nI was going to observe, that the insatiable desire of this and the neglect\nof other things introduces the change in democracy, which occasions a\ndemand for tyranny.\nHow so?\nWhen a democracy which is thirsting for freedom has evil *562D*\ncup-bearers presiding over the feast, and has drunk too deeply of the\nstrong wine of freedom, then, unless her rulers are very amenable and give\na plentiful draught, she calls them to account and punishes them, and says\nthat they are cursed oligarchs.\nYes, he replied, a very common occurrence.\n[Sidenote: Freedom in the end means anarchy.]\nYes, I said; and loyal citizens are insultingly termed by her slaves who\nhug their chains and men of naught; she would have subjects who are like\nrulers, and rulers who are {271} like subjects: these are men after her\nown heart, whom she praises and honours both in private and public. Now,\nin *562E* such a State, can liberty have any limit?\nCertainly not.\nBy degrees the anarchy finds a way into private houses, and ends by\ngetting among the animals and infecting them.\nHow do you mean?\nI mean that the father grows accustomed to descend to the level of his\nsons and to fear them, and the son is on a level with his father, he\nhaving no respect or reverence for either of his parents; and this is his\nfreedom, and the metic is equal with the citizen and the citizen with the\nmetic, and the *563A* stranger is quite as good as either.\nYes, he said, that is the way.\n[Sidenote: The inversion of all social relations.]\nAnd these are not the only evils, I said--there are several lesser ones:\nIn such a state of society the master fears and flatters his scholars, and\nthe scholars despise their masters and tutors; young and old are all\nalike; and the young man is on a level with the old, and is ready to\ncompete with him in word or deed; and old men condescend to the young and\nare full of pleasantry and gaiety; they are loth to be *563B* thought\nmorose and authoritative, and therefore they adopt the manners of the\nyoung.\nQuite true, he said.\nThe last extreme of popular liberty is when the slave bought with money,\nwhether male or female, is just as free as his or her purchaser; nor must\nI forget to tell of the liberty and equality of the two sexes in relation\nto each other.\n*563C* Why not, as Aeschylus says, utter the word which rises to our lips?\n[Sidenote: Freedom among the animals.]\nThat is what I am doing, I replied; and I must add that no one who does\nnot know would believe, how much greater is the liberty which the animals\nwho are under the dominion of man have in a democracy than in any other\nState: for truly, the she-dogs, as the proverb says, are as good as their\nshe-mistresses, and the horses and asses have a way of marching along with\nall the rights and dignities of freemen; and they will run at any body who\ncomes in their way if he does not leave the road clear for them: and all\nthings are *563D* just ready to burst with liberty. {272}\nWhen I take a country walk, he said, I often experience what you describe.\nYou and I have dreamed the same thing.\n[Sidenote: No law, no authority.]\nAnd above all, I said, and as the result of all, see how sensitive the\ncitizens become; they chafe impatiently at the least touch of authority,\nand at length, as you know, they cease to care even for the laws, written\nor unwritten; they will have *563E* no one over them.\nYes, he said, I know it too well.\nSuch, my friend, I said, is the fair and glorious beginning out of which\nsprings tyranny.\nGlorious indeed, he said. But what is the next step?\nThe ruin of oligarchy is the ruin of democracy; the same disease magnified\nand intensified by liberty overmasters democracy--the truth being that the\nexcessive *564A* increase of anything often causes a reaction in the\nopposite direction; and this is the case not only in the seasons and in\nvegetable and animal life, but above all in forms of government.\nTrue.\nThe excess of liberty, whether in States or individuals, seems only to\npass into excess of slavery.\nYes, the natural order.\nAnd so tyranny naturally arises out of democracy, and the most aggravated\nform of tyranny and slavery out of the most extreme form of liberty?\nAs we might expect.\n[Sidenote: The common evil of oligarchy and democracy is the class of idle\nspend-thrifts.]\nThat, however, was not, as I believe, your question--you rather desired to\nknow what is that disorder which is *564B* generated alike in oligarchy\nand democracy, and is the ruin of both?\nJust so, he replied.\nWell, I said, I meant to refer to the class of idle spendthrifts, of whom\nthe more courageous are the leaders and the more timid the followers, the\nsame whom we were comparing to drones, some stingless, and others having\nstings.\nA very just comparison.\n[Sidenote: Illustration.]\nThese two classes are the plagues of every city in which they are\ngenerated, being what phlegm and bile are to the body. *564C* And the good\nphysician and lawgiver of the State {273} ought, like the wise bee-master,\nto keep them at a distance and prevent, if possible, their ever coming in;\nand if they have anyhow found a way in, then he should have them and their\ncells cut out as speedily as possible.\nYes, by all means, he said.\n[Sidenote: Altogether three classes in a democracy.]\nThen, in order that we may see clearly what we are doing, let us imagine\ndemocracy to be divided, as indeed it is, into *564D* three classes; for\nin the first place freedom creates rather more drones in the democratic\nthan there were in the oligarchical State.\nThat is true.\nAnd in the democracy they are certainly more intensified.\nHow so?\n[Sidenote: (1) The drones or spend-thrifts who are more numerous and\nactive than in the oligarchy.]\nBecause in the oligarchical State they are disqualified and driven from\noffice, and therefore they cannot train or gather strength; whereas in a\ndemocracy they are almost the entire ruling power, and while the keener\nsort speak and act, the rest keep buzzing about the bema and do *564E* not\nsuffer a word to be said on the other side; hence in democracies almost\neverything is managed by the drones.\nVery true, he said.\nThen there is another class which is always being severed from the mass.\nWhat is that?\n[Sidenote: (2) The orderly or wealthy class who are fed upon by the\ndrones.]\nThey are the orderly class, which in a nation of traders is sure to be the\nrichest.\nNaturally so.\nThey are the most squeezable persons and yield the largest amount of honey\nto the drones.\nWhy, he said, there is little to be squeezed out of people who have\nlittle.\nAnd this is called the wealthy class, and the drones feed upon them.\n*565A* That is pretty much the case, he said.\n[Sidenote: (3) The working class who also get a share.]\nThe people are a third class, consisting of those who work with their own\nhands; they are not politicians, and have not much to live upon. This,\nwhen assembled, is the largest and most powerful class in a democracy.\nTrue, he said; but then the multitude is seldom willing to congregate\nunless they get a little honey. {274}\nAnd do they not share? I said. Do not their leaders deprive the rich of\ntheir estates and distribute them among the people; at the same time\ntaking care to reserve the larger part for themselves?\n*565B* Why, yes, he said, to that extent the people do share.\n[Sidenote: The well-to-do have to defend themselves against the people.]\nAnd the persons whose property is taken from them are compelled to defend\nthemselves before the people as they best can?\nWhat else can they do?\nAnd then, although they may have no desire of change, the others charge\nthem with plotting against the people and being friends of oligarchy?\nTrue.\nAnd the end is that when they see the people, not of their own accord, but\nthrough ignorance, and because they are *565C* deceived by informers,\nseeking to do them wrong, then at last they are forced to become oligarchs\nin reality; they do not wish to be, but the sting of the drones torments\nthem and breeds revolution in them.\nThat is exactly the truth.\nThen come impeachments and judgments and trials of one another.\nTrue.\n[Sidenote: The people have a protector who, when once he tastes blood, is\nconverted into a tyrant.]\nThe people have always some champion whom they set over them and nurse\ninto greatness.\nYes, that is their way.\n*565D* This and no other is the root from which a tyrant springs; when he\nfirst appears above ground he is a protector.\nYes, that is quite clear.\nHow then does a protector begin to change into a tyrant? Clearly when he\ndoes what the man is said to do in the tale of the Arcadian temple of\nLycaean Zeus.\nWhat tale?\nThe tale is that he who has tasted the entrails of a single human victim\nminced up with the entrails of other victims is *565E* destined to become\na wolf. Did you never hear it?\nOh, yes.\nAnd the protector of the people is like him; having a mob entirely at his\ndisposal, he is not restrained from shedding the blood of kinsmen; by the\nfavourite method of false accusation he brings them into court and murders\nthem, {275} making the life of man to disappear, and with unholy tongue\nand lips tasting the blood of his fellow citizens; some he kills and\nothers he banishes, at the same time hinting at the abolition of debts and\npartition of lands: and after this, what *566A* will be his destiny? Must\nhe not either perish at the hands of his enemies, or from being a man\nbecome a wolf--that is, a tyrant?\nInevitably.\nThis, I said, is he who begins to make a party against the rich?\nThe same.\n[Sidenote: After a time he is driven out, but comes back a full-blown\ntyrant.]\nAfter a while he is driven out, but comes back, in spite of his enemies, a\ntyrant full grown.\nThat is clear.\n*566B* And if they are unable to expel him, or to get him condemned to\ndeath by a public accusation, they conspire to assassinate him.\nYes, he said, that is their usual way.\n[Sidenote: The body-guard.]\nThen comes the famous request for a body-guard, which is the device of all\nthose who have got thus far in their tyrannical career--'Let not the\npeople's friend,' as they say, 'be lost to them.'\nExactly.\nThe people readily assent; all their fears are for him--they have none for\nthemselves.\n*566C* Very true.\nAnd when a man who is wealthy and is also accused of being an enemy of the\npeople sees this, then, my friend, as the oracle said to Croesus,\n'By pebbly Hermus' shore he flees and rests not, and is not ashamed to\nbe a coward[11].'\n[Footnote 11: Herod. i. 55.]\nAnd quite right too, said he, for if he were, he would never be ashamed\nagain.\nBut if he is caught he dies.\nOf course.\n[Sidenote: The protector standing up in the chariot of State.]\n*566D* And he, the protector of whom we spoke, is to be seen, not 'larding\nthe plain' with his bulk, but himself the overthrower of many, standing up\nin the chariot of State with the reins in his hand, no longer protector,\nbut tyrant absolute. {276}\nNo doubt, he said.\nAnd now let us consider the happiness of the man, and also of the State in\nwhich a creature like him is generated.\nYes, he said, let us consider that.\nAt first, in the early days of his power, he is full of smiles, and he\nsalutes every one whom he meets;--he to be called *566E* a tyrant, who is\nmaking promises in public and also in private! liberating debtors, and\ndistributing land to the people and his followers, and wanting to be so\nkind and good to every one!\nOf course, he said.\n[Sidenote: He stirs up wars, and impoverishes his subjects by the\nimposition of taxes.]\nBut when he has disposed of foreign enemies by conquest or treaty, and\nthere is nothing to fear from them, then he is always stirring up some war\nor other, in order that the people may require a leader.\nTo be sure.\n*567A* Has he not also another object, which is that they may be\nimpoverished by payment of taxes, and thus compelled to devote themselves\nto their daily wants and therefore less likely to conspire against him?\nClearly.\nAnd if any of them are suspected by him of having notions of freedom, and\nof resistance to his authority, he will have a good pretext for destroying\nthem by placing them at the mercy of the enemy; and for all these reasons\nthe tyrant must be always getting up a war.\nHe must.\n*567B* Now he begins to grow unpopular.\nA necessary result.\nThen some of those who joined in setting him up, and who are in power,\nspeak their minds to him and to one another, and the more courageous of\nthem cast in his teeth what is being done.\nYes, that may be expected.\n[Sidenote: He gets rid of his bravest and boldest followers.]\nAnd the tyrant, if he means to rule, must get rid of them; he cannot stop\nwhile he has a friend or an enemy who is good for anything.\nHe cannot.\nAnd therefore he must look about him and see who is *567C* valiant, who is\nhigh-minded, who is wise, who is wealthy; {277} happy man, he is the enemy\nof them all, and must seek occasion against them whether he will or no,\nuntil he has made a purgation of the State.\nYes, he said, and a rare purgation.\n[Sidenote: His purgation of the State.]\nYes, I said, not the sort of purgation which the physicians make of the\nbody; for they take away the worse and leave the better part, but he does\nthe reverse.\nIf he is to rule, I suppose that he cannot help himself.\n*567D* What a blessed alternative, I said:--to be compelled to dwell only\nwith the many bad, and to be by them hated, or not to live at all!\nYes, that is the alternative.\nAnd the more detestable his actions are to the citizens the more\nsatellites and the greater devotion in them will he require?\nCertainly.\nAnd who are the devoted band, and where will he procure them?\nThey will flock to him, he said, of their own accord, if he pays them.\n[Sidenote: More drones.]\nBy the dog! I said, here are more drones, of every sort *567E* and from\nevery land.\nYes, he said, there are.\nBut will he not desire to get them on the spot?\nHow do you mean?\nHe will rob the citizens of their slaves; he will then set them free and\nenrol them in his body-guard.\nTo be sure, he said; and he will be able to trust them best of all.\n[Sidenote: He puts to death his friends and lives with the slaves whom he\nhas enfranchised.]\nWhat a blessed creature, I said, must this tyrant be; he *568A* has put to\ndeath the others and has these for his trusted friends.\nYes, he said; they are quite of his sort.\nYes, I said, and these are the new citizens whom he has called into\nexistence, who admire him and are his companions, while the good hate and\navoid him.\nOf course.\n[Sidenote: Euripides and the tragedians praise tyranny, which is an\nexcellent reason for expelling them from our State.]\nVerily, then, tragedy is a wise thing and Euripides a great tragedian.\nWhy so? {278}\nWhy, because he is the author of the pregnant saying,\n*568B* 'Tyrants are wise by living with the wise;'\nand he clearly meant to say that they are the wise whom the tyrant makes\nhis companions.\nYes, he said, and he also praises tyranny as godlike; and many other\nthings of the same kind are said by him and by the other poets.\nAnd therefore, I said, the tragic poets being wise men will forgive us and\nany others who live after our manner if we do not receive them into our\nState, because they are the eulogists of tyranny.\n*568C* Yes, he said, those who have the wit will doubtless forgive us.\nBut they will continue to go to other cities and attract mobs, and hire\nvoices fair and loud and persuasive, and draw the cities over to tyrannies\nand democracies.\nVery true.\nMoreover, they are paid for this and receive honour--the greatest honour,\nas might be expected, from tyrants, and the next greatest from\ndemocracies; but the higher they ascend *568D* our constitution hill, the\nmore their reputation fails, and seems unable from shortness of breath to\nproceed further.\nTrue.\nBut we are wandering from the subject: Let us therefore return and enquire\nhow the tyrant will maintain that fair and numerous and various and\never-changing army of his.\n[Sidenote: The tyrant seizes the treasures in the temples, and when these\nfail feeds upon the people.]\nIf, he said, there are sacred treasures in the city, he will confiscate\nand spend them; and in so far as the fortunes of attainted persons may\nsuffice, he will be able to diminish the taxes which he would otherwise\nhave to impose upon the people.\n*568E* And when these fail?\nWhy, clearly, he said, then he and his boon companions, whether male or\nfemale, will be maintained out of his father's estate.\nYou mean to say that the people, from whom he has derived his being, will\nmaintain him and his companions?\nYes, he said; they cannot help themselves.\n[Sidenote: They rebel, and then he beats his own parent, i.e. the people.]\nBut what if the people fly into a passion, and aver that a {279} grown-up\nson ought not to be supported by his father, but *569A* that the father\nshould be supported by the son? The father did not bring him into being,\nor settle him in life, in order that when his son became a man he should\nhimself be the servant of his own servants and should support him and his\nrabble of slaves and companions; but that his son should protect him, and\nthat by his help he might be emancipated from the government of the rich\nand aristocratic, as they are termed. And so he bids him and his\ncompanions depart, just as any other father might drive out of the house a\nriotous son and his undesirable associates.\nBy heaven, he said, then the parent will discover what *569B* a monster he\nhas been fostering in his bosom; and, when he wants to drive him out, he\nwill find that he is weak and his son strong.\nWhy, you do not mean to say that the tyrant will use violence? What! beat\nhis father if he opposes him?\nYes, he will, having first disarmed him.\nThen he is a parricide, and a cruel guardian of an aged parent; and this\nis real tyranny, about which there can be no longer a mistake: as the\nsaying is, the people who would escape the smoke which is the slavery of\nfreemen, has fallen *569C* into the fire which is the tyranny of slaves.\nThus liberty, getting out of all order and reason, passes into the\nharshest and bitterest form of slavery.\nTrue, he said.\nVery well; and may we not rightly say that we have sufficiently discussed\nthe nature of tyranny, and the manner of the transition from democracy to\ntyranny?\nYes, quite enough, he said.\nBOOK IX.\n[Sidenote: _Republic IX._ Socrates, Adeimantus.]\n*571A* Last of all comes the tyrannical man; about whom we have once more\nto ask, how is he formed out of the democratical? and how does he live, in\nhappiness or in misery?\nYes, he said, he is the only one remaining.\nThere is, however, I said, a previous question which remains unanswered.\nWhat question?\n[Sidenote: A digression having a purpose.]\nI do not think that we have adequately determined the nature and number of\nthe appetites, and until this is accomplished *571B* the enquiry will\nalways be confused.\nWell, he said, it is not too late to supply the omission.\n[Sidenote: The wild beast latent in man peers forth in sleep.]\nVery true, I said; and observe the point which I want to understand:\nCertain of the unnecessary pleasures and appetites I conceive to be\nunlawful; every one appears to have them, but in some persons they are\ncontrolled by the laws and by reason, and the better desires prevail over\nthem--either they are wholly banished or they become few and weak; while\nin the case of others they are stronger, and *571C* there are more of\nthem.\nWhich appetites do you mean?\nI mean those which are awake when the reasoning and human and ruling power\nis asleep; then the wild beast within us, gorged with meat or drink,\nstarts up and having shaken off sleep, goes forth to satisfy his desires;\nand there *571D* is no conceivable folly or crime--not excepting incest or\nany other unnatural union, or parricide, or the eating of forbidden\nfood--which at such a time, when he has parted company with all shame and\nsense, a man may not be ready to commit.\nMost true, he said.\n[Sidenote: The contrast of the temperate man whose passions are under the\ncontrol of reason.]\nBut when a man's pulse is healthy and temperate, and when before going to\nsleep he has awakened his rational {281} powers, and fed them on noble\nthoughts and enquiries, *571E* collecting himself in meditation; after\nhaving first indulged his appetites neither too much nor too little, but\njust enough to lay them to sleep, and prevent them and their enjoyments\n*572A* and pains from interfering with the higher principle--which he\nleaves in the solitude of pure abstraction, free to contemplate and aspire\nto the knowledge of the unknown, whether in past, present, or future: when\nagain he has allayed the passionate element, if he has a quarrel against\nany one--I say, when, after pacifying the two irrational principles, he\nrouses up the third, which is reason, before he takes his rest, then, as\nyou know, he attains truth most nearly, and is least *572B* likely to be\nthe sport of fantastic and lawless visions.\nI quite agree.\nIn saying this I have been running into a digression; but the point which\nI desire to note is that in all of us, even in good men, there is a\nlawless wild-beast nature, which peers out in sleep. Pray, consider\nwhether I am right, and you agree with me.\nYes, I agree.\n[Sidenote: Recapitulation.]\nAnd now remember the character which we attributed *572C* to the\ndemocratic man. He was supposed from his youth upwards to have been\ntrained under a miserly parent, who encouraged the saving appetites in\nhim, but discountenanced the unnecessary, which aim only at amusement and\nornament?\nTrue.\nAnd then he got into the company of a more refined, licentious sort of\npeople, and taking to all their wanton ways rushed into the opposite\nextreme from an abhorrence of his father's meanness. At last, being a\nbetter man than his corruptors, he was drawn in both directions until he\nhalted *572D* midway and led a life, not of vulgar and slavish passion,\nbut of what he deemed moderate indulgence in various pleasures. After this\nmanner the democrat was generated out of the oligarch?\nYes, he said; that was our view of him, and is so still.\nAnd now, I said, years will have passed away, and you must conceive this\nman, such as he is, to have a son, who is brought up in his father's\nprinciples.\nI can imagine him. {282}\nThen you must further imagine the same thing to happen to the son which\nhas already happened to the father:--he is *572E* drawn into a perfectly\nlawless life, which by his seducers is termed perfect liberty; and his\nfather and friends take part with his moderate desires, and the opposite\nparty assist the opposite ones. As soon as these dire magicians and *573A*\ntyrant-makers find that they are losing their hold on him, they contrive\nto implant in him a master passion, to be lord over his idle and\nspendthrift lusts--a sort of monstrous winged drone--that is the only\nimage which will adequately describe him.\nYes, he said, that is the only adequate image of him.\nAnd when his other lusts, amid clouds of incense and perfumes and garlands\nand wines, and all the pleasures of a dissolute life, now let loose, come\nbuzzing around him, nourishing to the utmost the sting of desire which\nthey implant in his drone-like nature, then at last this lord of *573B*\nthe soul, having Madness for the captain of his guard, breaks out into a\nfrenzy: and if he finds in himself any good opinions or appetites in\nprocess of formation[1], and there is in him any sense of shame remaining,\nto these better principles he puts an end, and casts them forth until he\nhas purged away temperance and brought in madness to the full.\n[Footnote 1: Or, 'opinions or appetites such as are deemed to be good.']\n[Sidenote: The tyrannical man is made up of lusts and appetites. Love,\ndrink, madness are but different forms of tyranny.]\nYes, he said, that is the way in which the tyrannical man is generated.\nAnd is not this the reason why of old love has been called a tyrant?\nI should not wonder.\nFurther, I said, has not a drunken man also the spirit of *573C* a tyrant?\nHe has.\nAnd you know that a man who is deranged and not right in his mind, will\nfancy that he is able to rule, not only over men, but also over the gods?\nThat he will.\nAnd the tyrannical man in the true sense of the word comes into being\nwhen, either under the influence of nature, or habit, or both, he becomes\ndrunken, lustful, passionate? O my friend, is not that so? {283}\nAssuredly.\nSuch is the man and such is his origin. And next, how does he live?\n*573D* Suppose, as people facetiously say, you were to tell me.\nI imagine, I said, at the next step in his progress, that there will be\nfeasts and carousals and revellings and courtezans, and all that sort of\nthing; Love is the lord of the house within him, and orders all the\nconcerns of his soul.\nThat is certain.\nYes; and every day and every night desires grow up many and formidable,\nand their demands are many.\nThey are indeed, he said.\nHis revenues, if he has any, are soon spent.\nTrue.\n*573E* Then comes debt and the cutting down of his property.\nOf course.\n[Sidenote: His desires become greater and his means less.]\nWhen he has nothing left, must not his desires, crowding in the nest like\nyoung ravens, be crying aloud for food; and *574A* he, goaded on by them,\nand especially by love himself, who is in a manner the captain of them, is\nin a frenzy, and would fain discover whom he can defraud or despoil of his\nproperty, in order that he may gratify them?\nYes, that is sure to be the case.\nHe must have money, no matter how, if he is to escape horrid pains and\npangs.\nHe must.\n[Sidenote: He will rob his father and mother.]\nAnd as in himself there was a succession of pleasures, and the new got the\nbetter of the old and took away their rights, so he being younger will\nclaim to have more than his father and his mother, and if he has spent his\nown share of the property, he will take a slice of theirs.\nNo doubt he will.\n*574B* And if his parents will not give way, then he will try first of all\nto cheat and deceive them.\nVery true.\nAnd if he fails, then he will use force and plunder them.\nYes, probably.\nAnd if the old man and woman fight for their own, what then, my friend?\nWill the creature feel any compunction at tyrannizing over them? {284}\nNay, he said, I should not feel at all comfortable about his parents.\n[Sidenote: He will prefer the love of a girl or a youth to his aged\nparents, and may even be induced to strike them.]\nBut, O heavens! Adeimantus, on account of some new-fangled love of a\nharlot, who is anything but a necessary *574C* connection, can you believe\nthat he would strike the mother who is his ancient friend and necessary to\nhis very existence, and would place her under the authority of the other,\nwhen she is brought under the same roof with her; or that, under like\ncircumstances, he would do the same to his withered old father, first and\nmost indispensable of friends, for the sake of some newly-found blooming\nyouth who is the reverse of indispensable?\nYes, indeed, he said; I believe that he would.\nTruly, then, I said, a tyrannical son is a blessing to his father and\nmother.\nHe is indeed, he replied.\n[Sidenote: He turns highwayman, robs temples, loses all his early\nprinciples, and becomes in waking reality the evil dream which he had in\nsleep.]\n[Sidenote: He gathers followers about him.]\n*574D* He first takes their property, and when that fails, and pleasures\nare beginning to swarm in the hive of his soul, then he breaks into a\nhouse, or steals the garments of some nightly wayfarer; next he proceeds\nto clear a temple. Meanwhile the old opinions which he had when a child,\nand which gave judgment about good and evil, are overthrown by those\nothers which have just been emancipated, and are now the body-guard of\nlove and share his empire. These in his democratic days, when he was still\nsubject to the laws *574E* and to his father, were only let loose in the\ndreams of sleep. But now that he is under the dominion of love, he becomes\nalways and in waking reality what he was then very rarely and in a dream\nonly; he will commit the foulest murder, or eat forbidden food, or be\nguilty of any other horrid act. *575A* Love is his tyrant, and lives\nlordly in him and lawlessly, and being himself a king, leads him on, as a\ntyrant leads a State, to the performance of any reckless deed by which he\ncan maintain himself and the rabble of his associates, whether those whom\nevil communications have brought in from without, or those whom he himself\nhas allowed to break loose within him by reason of a similar evil nature\nin himself. Have we not here a picture of his way of life?\nYes, indeed, he said.\nAnd if there are only a few of them in the State, and the {285} *575B*\nrest of the people are well disposed, they go away and become the\nbody-guard or mercenary soldiers of some other tyrant who may probably\nwant them for a war; and if there is no war, they stay at home and do many\nlittle pieces of mischief in the city.\nWhat sort of mischief?\nFor example, they are the thieves, burglars, cut-purses, foot-pads,\nrobbers of temples, man-stealers of the community; or if they are able to\nspeak they turn informers, and bear false witness, and take bribes.\n*575C* A small catalogue of evils, even if the perpetrators of them are\nfew in number.\n[Sidenote: A private person can do but little harm in comparison of the\ntyrant.]\nYes, I said; but small and great are comparative terms, and all these\nthings, in the misery and evil which they inflict upon a State, do not\ncome within a thousand miles of the tyrant; when this noxious class and\ntheir followers grow numerous and become conscious of their strength,\nassisted by the infatuation of the people, they choose from among\nthemselves the one who has most of the tyrant in his own soul, *575D* and\nhim they create their tyrant.\nYes, he said, and he will be the most fit to be a tyrant.\nIf the people yield, well and good; but if they resist him, as he began by\nbeating his own father and mother, so now, if he has the power, he beats\nthem, and will keep his dear old fatherland or motherland, as the Cretans\nsay, in subjection to his young retainers whom he has introduced to be\ntheir rulers and masters. This is the end of his passions and desires.\n*575E* Exactly.\n[Sidenote: The behaviour of the tyrant to his early supporters.]\nWhen such men are only private individuals and before they get power, this\nis their character; they associate entirely with their own flatterers or\nready tools; or if they want anything from anybody, they in their turn are\nequally ready to bow down before them: they profess every sort of *576A*\naffection for them; but when they have gained their point they know them\nno more.\nYes, truly.\n[Sidenote: He is always either master or servant, always treacherous,\nunjust, the waking reality of our dream, a tyrant by nature, a tyrant in\nfact.]\nThey are always either the masters or servants and never the friends of\nanybody; the tyrant never tastes of true freedom or friendship. {286}\nCertainly not.\nAnd may we not rightly call such men treacherous?\nNo question.\n*576B* Also they are utterly unjust, if we were right in our notion of\njustice?\nYes, he said, and we were perfectly right.\nLet us then sum up in a word, I said, the character of the worst man:\nhe is the waking reality of what we dreamed.\nMost true.\nAnd this is he who being by nature most of a tyrant bears rule, and the\nlonger he lives the more of a tyrant he becomes.\n[Sidenote: Socrates, Glaucon.]\nThat is certain, said Glaucon, taking his turn to answer.\n[Sidenote: The wicked are also the most miserable.]\nAnd will not he who has been shown to be the wickedest, *576C* be also the\nmost miserable? and he who has tyrannized longest and most, most\ncontinually and truly miserable; although this may not be the opinion of\nmen in general?\nYes, he said, inevitably.\n[Sidenote: Like man, like State.]\nAnd must not the tyrannical man be like the tyrannical State, and the\ndemocratical man like the democratical State; and the same of the others?\nCertainly.\nAnd as State is to State in virtue and happiness, so is man in relation to\nman?\n*576D* To be sure.\n[Sidenote: The opposite of the king.]\nThen comparing our original city, which was under a king, and the city\nwhich is under a tyrant, how do they stand as to virtue?\nThey are the opposite extremes, he said, for one is the very best and the\nother is the very worst.\nThere can be no mistake, I said, as to which is which, and therefore I\nwill at once enquire whether you would arrive at a similar decision about\ntheir relative happiness and misery. And here we must not allow ourselves\nto be panic-stricken at the apparition of the tyrant, who is only a unit\nand may perhaps have a few retainers about him; but let us go as we *576E*\nought into every corner of the city and look all about, and then we will\ngive our opinion.\nA fair invitation, he replied; and I see, as every one must, that a\ntyranny is the wretchedest form of government, and the rule of a king the\nhappiest. {287}\nAnd in estimating the men too, may I not fairly make *577A* a like\nrequest, that I should have a judge whose mind can enter into and see\nthrough human nature? he must not be like a child who looks at the outside\nand is dazzled at the pompous aspect which the tyrannical nature assumes\nto the beholder, but let him be one who has a clear insight. May I suppose\nthat the judgment is given in the hearing of us all by one who is able to\njudge, and has dwelt in the same place with him, and been present at his\ndally life and known *577B* him in his family relations, where he may be\nseen stripped of his tragedy attire, and again in the hour of public\ndanger--he shall tell us about the happiness and misery of the tyrant when\ncompared with other men?\nThat again, he said, is a very fair proposal.\nShall I assume that we ourselves are able and experienced judges and have\nbefore now met with such a person? We shall then have some one who will\nanswer our enquiries.\nBy all means.\n*577C* Let me ask you not to forget the parallel of the individual and the\nState; bearing this in mind, and glancing in turn from one to the other of\nthem, will you tell me their respective conditions?\nWhat do you mean? he asked.\n[Sidenote: The State is not free, but enslaved.]\nBeginning with the State, I replied, would you say that a city which is\ngoverned by a tyrant is free or enslaved?\nNo city, he said, can be more completely enslaved.\nAnd yet, as you see, there are freemen as well as masters in such a State?\nYes, he said, I see that there are--a few; but the people, speaking\ngenerally, and the best of them are miserably degraded and enslaved.\n[Sidenote: Like a slave, the tyrant is full of meanness, and the ruling\npart of him is madness.]\n*577D* Then if the man is like the State, I said, must not the same rule\nprevail? his soul is full of meanness and vulgarity--the best elements in\nhim are enslaved; and there is a small ruling part, which is also the\nworst and maddest.\nInevitably.\nAnd would you say that the soul of such an one is the soul of a freeman,\nor of a slave?\nHe has the soul of a slave, in my opinion. {288}\nAnd the State which is enslaved under a tyrant is utterly incapable of\nacting voluntarily?\nUtterly incapable.\n[Sidenote: The city which is subject to him is goaded by a gadfly;]\n*577E* And also the soul which is under a tyrant (I am speaking of the\nsoul taken as a whole) is least capable of doing what she desires; there\nis a gadfly which goads her, and she is full of trouble and remorse?\nCertainly.\nAnd is the city which is under a tyrant rich or poor?\nPoor.\n[Sidenote: poor;]\n*578A* And the tyrannical soul must be always poor and insatiable?\nTrue.\nAnd must not such a State and such a man be always full of fear?\nYes, indeed.\n[Sidenote: full of misery.]\nIs there any State in which you will find more of lamentation and sorrow\nand groaning and pain?\nCertainly not.\nAnd is there any man in whom you will find more of this sort of misery\nthan in the tyrannical man, who is in a fury of passions and desires?\nImpossible.\n*578B* Reflecting upon these and similar evils, you held the tyrannical\nState to be the most miserable of States?\nAnd I was right, he said.\n[Sidenote: Also the tyrannical man is most miserable.]\nCertainly, I said. And when you see the same evils in the tyrannical man,\nwhat do you say of him?\nI say that he is by far the most miserable of all men.\n[Sidenote: Yet there is a still more miserable being, the tyrannical man\nwho is a public tyrant.]\nThere, I said, I think that you are beginning to go wrong.\nWhat do you mean?\nI do not think that he has as yet reached the utmost extreme of misery.\nThen who is more miserable?\nOne of whom I am about to speak.\nWho is that?\n*578C* He who is of a tyrannical nature, and instead of leading a private\nlife has been cursed with the further misfortune of being a public tyrant.\nFrom what has been said, I gather that you are right. {289}\nYes, I replied, but in this high argument you should be a little more\ncertain, and should not conjecture only; for of all questions, this\nrespecting good and evil is the greatest.\nVery true, he said.\nLet me then offer you an illustration, which may, I think, *578D* throw a\nlight upon this subject.\nWhat is your illustration?\n[Sidenote: In cities there are many great slaveowners, and they help to\nprotect one another.]\nThe case of rich individuals in cities who possess many slaves: from them\nyou may form an idea of the tyrant's condition, for they both have slaves;\nthe only difference is that he has more slaves.\nYes, that is the difference.\nYou know that they live securely and have nothing to apprehend from their\nservants?\nWhat should they fear?\nNothing. But do you observe the reason of this?\nYes; the reason is, that the whole city is leagued together for the\nprotection of each individual.\n[Sidenote: But suppose a slaveowner and his slaves carried off into the\nwilderness, what will happen then? Such is the condition of the tyrant.]\n*578E* Very true, I said. But imagine one of these owners, the master say\nof some fifty slaves, together with his family and property and slaves,\ncarried off by a god into the wilderness, where there are no freemen to\nhelp him--will he not be in an agony of fear lest he and his wife and\nchildren should be put to death by his slaves?\nYes, he said, he will be in the utmost fear.\n*579A* The time has arrived when he will be compelled to flatter divers of\nhis slaves, and make many promises to them of freedom and other things,\nmuch against his will--he will have to cajole his own servants.\nYes, he said, that will be the only way of saving himself.\nAnd suppose the same god, who carried him away, to surround him with\nneighbours who will not suffer one man to be the master of another, and\nwho, if they could catch the offender, would take his life?\n*579B* His case will be still worse, if you suppose him to be everywhere\nsurrounded and watched by enemies.\n[Sidenote: He is the daintiest of all men and has to endure the hardships\nof a prison;]\nAnd is not this the sort of prison in which the tyrant will be bound--he\nwho being by nature such as we have described, is full of all sorts of\nfears and lusts? His soul is dainty and greedy, and yet alone, of all men\nin the city, he is never {290} allowed to go on a journey, or to see the\nthings which other freemen desire to see, but he lives in his hole like a\nwoman *579C* hidden in the house, and is jealous of any other citizen who\ngoes into foreign parts and sees anything of interest.\nVery true, he said.\n[Sidenote: Miserable in himself, he is still more miserable if he be in a\npublic station.]\nAnd amid evils such as these will not he who is ill-governed in his own\nperson--the tyrannical man, I mean--whom you just now decided to be the\nmost miserable of all--will not he be yet more miserable when, instead of\nleading a private life, he is constrained by fortune to be a public\ntyrant? He has to be master of others when he is not master of himself: he\nis like a diseased or paralytic man who is compelled to pass his *579D*\nlife, not in retirement, but fighting and combating with other men.\nYes, he said, the similitude is most exact.\n[Sidenote: He then leads a life worse than the worst,]\nIs not his case utterly miserable? and does not the actual tyrant lead a\nworse life than he whose life you determined to be the worst?\nCertainly.\n[Sidenote: in unhappiness,]\nHe who is the real tyrant, whatever men may think, is the real slave, and\nis obliged to practise the greatest adulation *579E* and servility, and to\nbe the flatterer of the vilest of mankind. He has desires which he is\nutterly unable to satisfy, and has more wants than any one, and is truly\npoor, if you know how to inspect the whole soul of him: all his life long\nhe is beset with fear and is full of convulsions and distractions, even as\nthe State which he resembles: and surely the resemblance holds?\nVery true, he said.\n[Sidenote: and in wickedness.]\n*580A* Moreover, as we were saying before, he grows worse from having\npower: he becomes and is of necessity more jealous, more faithless, more\nunjust, more friendless, more impious, than he was at first; he is the\npurveyor and cherisher of every sort of vice, and the consequence is that\nhe is supremely miserable, and that he makes everybody else as miserable\nas himself.\nNo man of any sense will dispute your words.\n[Sidenote: The umpire decides that]\nCome then, I said, and as the general umpire in theatrical *580B* contests\nproclaims the result, do you also decide who in your opinion is first in\nthe scale of happiness, and who second, {291} and in what order the others\nfollow: there are five of them in all--they are the royal, timocratical,\noligarchical, democratical, tyrannical.\nThe decision will be easily given, he replied; they shall be choruses\ncoming on the stage, and I must judge them in the order in which they\nenter, by the criterion of virtue and vice, happiness and misery.\n[Sidenote: the best is the happiest and the worst is the most miserable.\nThis is the proclamation of the son of Ariston.]\nNeed we hire a herald, or shall I announce, that the son of Ariston [the\nbest] has decided that the best and justest *580C* is also the happiest,\nand that this is he who is the most royal man and king over himself; and\nthat the worst and most unjust man is also the most miserable, and that\nthis is he who being the greatest tyrant of himself is also the greatest\ntyrant of his State?\nMake the proclamation yourself, he said.\nAnd shall I add, 'whether seen or unseen by gods and men'?\nLet the words be added.\nThen this, I said, will be our first proof; and there is *580D* another,\nwhich may also have some weight.\nWhat is that?\n[Sidenote: Proof, derived from the three principles of the soul.]\nThe second proof is derived from the nature of the soul: seeing that the\nindividual soul, like the State, has been divided by us into three\nprinciples, the division may, I think, furnish a new demonstration.\nOf what nature?\nIt seems to me that to these three principles three pleasures correspond;\nalso three desires and governing powers.\nHow do you mean? he said.\nThere is one principle with which, as we were saying, a man learns,\nanother with which he is angry; the third, *580E* having many forms, has\nno special name, but is denoted by the general term appetitive, from the\nextraordinary strength and vehemence of the desires of eating and drinking\nand the other sensual appetites which are the main elements of it; *581A*\nalso money-loving, because such desires are generally satisfied by the\nhelp of money.\nThat is true, he said.\n[Sidenote: (1) The appetitive:]\nIf we were to say that the loves and pleasures of this third part were\nconcerned with gain, we should then be {292} able to fall back on a single\nnotion; and might truly and intelligibly describe this part of the soul as\nloving gain or money.\nI agree with you.\nAgain, is not the passionate element wholly set on ruling and conquering\nand getting fame?\n*581B* True.\n[Sidenote: (2) The ambitious;]\nSuppose we call it the contentious or ambitious--would the term be\nsuitable?\nExtremely suitable.\n[Sidenote: (3) The principle of knowledge and truth.]\nOn the other hand, every one sees that the principle of knowledge is\nwholly directed to the truth, and cares less than either of the others for\ngain or fame.\nFar less.\n'Lover of wisdom,' 'lover of knowledge,' are titles which we may fitly\napply to that part of the soul?\nCertainly.\nOne principle prevails in the souls of one class of men, *581C* another in\nothers, as may happen?\nYes.\nThen we may begin by assuming that there are three classes of men--lovers\nof wisdom, lovers of honour, lovers of gain?\nExactly.\nAnd there are three kinds of pleasure, which are their several objects?\nVery true.\n[Sidenote: Each will depreciate the others, but only the philosopher has\nthe power to judge,]\nNow, if you examine the three classes of men, and ask of them in turn\nwhich of their lives is pleasantest, each will be found praising his own\nand depreciating that of others: *581D* the money-maker will contrast the\nvanity of honour or of learning if they bring no money with the solid\nadvantages of gold and silver?\nTrue, he said.\nAnd the lover of honour--what will be his opinion? Will he not think that\nthe pleasure of riches is vulgar, while the pleasure of learning, if it\nbrings no distinction, is all smoke and nonsense to him?\nVery true. {293}\n[Sidenote: because he alone has experience of the highest pleasures and is\nalso acquainted with the lower.]\nAnd are we to suppose[2], I said, that the philosopher sets *581E* any\nvalue on other pleasures in comparison with the pleasure of knowing the\ntruth, and in that pursuit abiding, ever learning, not so far indeed from\nthe heaven of pleasure? Does he not call the other pleasures necessary,\nunder the idea that if there were no necessity for them, he would rather\nnot have them?\n[Footnote 2: Reading with Grasere and Hermann [Greek: ti/ oi)\u00f4/metha], and\nomitting [Greek: ou)de\\n], which is not found in the best MSS.]\nThere can be no doubt of that, he replied.\nSince, then, the pleasures of each class and the life of each are in\ndispute, and the question is not which life is more or *582A* less\nhonourable, or better or worse, but which is the more pleasant or\npainless--how shall we know who speaks truly?\nI cannot myself tell, he said.\nWell, but what ought to be the criterion? Is any better than experience\nand wisdom and reason?\nThere cannot be a better, he said.\nThen, I said, reflect. Of the three individuals, which has the greatest\nexperience of all the pleasures which we enumerated? Has the lover of\ngain, in learning the nature of essential truth, greater experience of the\npleasure of *582B* knowledge than the philosopher has of the pleasure of\ngain?\nThe philosopher, he replied, has greatly the advantage; for he has of\nnecessity always known the taste of the other pleasures from his childhood\nupwards: but the lover of gain in all his experience has not of necessity\ntasted--or, I should rather say, even had he desired, could hardly have\ntasted--the sweetness of learning and knowing truth.\nThen the lover of wisdom has a great advantage over the lover of gain, for\nhe has a double experience?\n*582C* Yes, very great.\nAgain, has he greater experience of the pleasures of honour, or the lover\nof honour of the pleasures of wisdom?\nNay, he said, all three are honoured in proportion as they attain their\nobject; for the rich man and the brave man and the wise man alike have\ntheir crowd of admirers, and as they all receive honour they all have\nexperience of the pleasures of honour; but the delight which is to be\nfound {294} in the knowledge of true being is known to the philosopher\nonly.\n*582D* His experience, then, will enable him to judge better than any one?\nFar better.\n[Sidenote: The philosopher alone having both judgment and experience,]\nAnd he is the only one who has wisdom as well as experience?\nCertainly.\nFurther, the very faculty which is the instrument of judgment is not\npossessed by the covetous or ambitious man, but only by the philosopher?\nWhat faculty?\nReason, with whom, as we were saying, the decision ought to rest.\nYes.\nAnd reasoning is peculiarly his instrument?\nCertainly.\nIf wealth and gain were the criterion, then the praise or *582E* blame of\nthe lover of gain would surely be the most trustworthy?\nAssuredly.\nOr if honour or victory or courage, in that case the judgment of the\nambitious or pugnacious would be the truest?\nClearly.\n[Sidenote: the pleasures which he approves are the true pleasures: he\nplaces (1) the love of wisdom, (2) the love of honour, (3) and lowest the\nlove of gain.]\nBut since experience and wisdom and reason are the judges--\nThe only inference possible, he replied, is that pleasures which are\napproved by the lover of wisdom and reason are the truest.\nAnd so we arrive at the result, that the pleasure of the *583A*\nintelligent part of the soul is the pleasantest of the three, and that he\nof us in whom this is the ruling principle has the pleasantest life.\nUnquestionably, he said, the wise man speaks with authority when he\napproves of his own life.\nAnd what does the judge affirm to be the life which is next, and the\npleasure which is next?\nClearly that of the soldier and lover of honour; who is nearer to himself\nthan the money-maker.\nLast comes the lover of gain? {295}\nVery true, he said.\n[Sidenote: True pleasure is not relative but absolute.]\n*583B* Twice in succession, then, has the just man overthrown the unjust\nin this conflict; and now comes the third trial, which is dedicated to\nOlympian Zeus the saviour: a sage whispers in my ear that no pleasure\nexcept that of the wise is quite true and pure--all others are a shadow\nonly; and surely this will prove the greatest and most decisive of falls?\nYes, the greatest; but will you explain yourself?\n*583C* I will work out the subject and you shall answer my questions.\nProceed.\nSay, then, is not pleasure opposed to pain?\nTrue.\nAnd there is a neutral state which is neither pleasure nor pain?\nThere is.\nA state which is intermediate, and a sort of repose of the soul about\neither--that is what you mean?\nYes.\nYou remember what people say when they are sick?\nWhat do they say?\nThat after all nothing is pleasanter than health. But then they never knew\nthis to be the greatest of pleasures until *583D* they were ill.\nYes, I know, he said.\n[Sidenote: The states intermediate between pleasure and pain are termed\npleasures or pains only in relation to their opposites.]\nAnd when persons are suffering from acute pain, you must have heard them\nsay that there is nothing pleasanter than to get rid of their pain?\nI have.\nAnd there are many other cases of suffering in which the mere rest and\ncessation of pain, and not any positive enjoyment, is extolled by them as\nthe greatest pleasure?\nYes, he said; at the time they are pleased and well content to be at rest.\n*583E* Again, when pleasure ceases, that sort of rest or cessation will be\npainful?\nDoubtless, he said.\nThen the intermediate state of rest will be pleasure and will also be\npain?\nSo it would seem. {296}\nBut can that which is neither become both?\nI should say not.\nAnd both pleasure and pain are motions of the soul, are they not?\nYes.\n[Sidenote: Pleasure and pain are said to be states of rest, but they are\nreally motions.]\n*584A* But that which is neither was just now shown to be rest and not\nmotion, and in a mean between them?\nYes.\nHow, then, can we be right in supposing that the absence of pain is\npleasure, or that the absence of pleasure is pain?\nImpossible.\nThis then is an appearance only and not a reality; that is to say, the\nrest is pleasure at the moment and in comparison of what is painful, and\npainful in comparison of what is pleasant; but all these representations,\nwhen tried by the test of true pleasure, are not real but a sort of\nimposition?\nThat is the inference.\n[Sidenote: All pleasures are not merely cessations of pains, or pains of\npleasures; e.g. the pleasures of smell are not.]\n*584B* Look at the other class of pleasures which have no antecedent pains\nand you will no longer suppose, as you perhaps may at present, that\npleasure is only the cessation of pain, or pain of pleasure.\nWhat are they, he said, and where shall I find them?\nThere are many of them: take as an example the pleasures of smell, which\nare very great and have no antecedent pains; they come in a moment, and\nwhen they depart leave no pain behind them.\nMost true, he said.\n*584C* Let us not, then, be induced to believe that pure pleasure is the\ncessation of pain, or pain of pleasure.\nNo.\nStill, the more numerous and violent pleasures which reach the soul\nthrough the body are generally of this sort--they are reliefs of pain.\nThat is true.\nAnd the anticipations of future pleasures and pains are of a like nature?\nYes.\n*584D* Shall I give you an illustration of them?\nLet me hear. {297}\nYou would allow, I said, that there is in nature an upper and lower and\nmiddle region?\nI should.\n[Sidenote: Illustrations of the unreality of certain pleasures.]\nAnd if a person were to go from the lower to the middle region, would he\nnot imagine that he is going up; and he who is standing in the middle and\nsees whence he has come, would imagine that he is already in the upper\nregion, if he has never seen the true upper world?\nTo be sure, he said; how can he think otherwise?\n*584E* But if he were taken back again he would imagine, and truly\nimagine, that he was descending?\nNo doubt.\nAll that would arise out of his ignorance of the true upper and middle and\nlower regions?\nYes.\nThen can you wonder that persons who are inexperienced in the truth, as\nthey have wrong ideas about many other things, should also have wrong\nideas about pleasure and pain and the intermediate state; so that when\nthey are only being *585A* drawn towards the painful they feel pain and\nthink the pain which they experience to be real, and in like manner, when\ndrawn away from pain to the neutral or intermediate state, they firmly\nbelieve that they have reached the goal of satiety and pleasure; they, not\nknowing pleasure, err in contrasting pain with the absence of pain, which\nis like contrasting black with grey instead of white--can you wonder, I\nsay, at this?\nNo, indeed; I should be much more disposed to wonder at the opposite.\nLook at the matter thus:--Hunger, thirst, and the like, *585B* are\ninanitions of the bodily state?\nYes.\nAnd ignorance and folly are inanitions of the soul?\nTrue.\nAnd food and wisdom are the corresponding satisfactions of either?\nCertainly.\n[Sidenote: The intellectual more real than the sensual.]\nAnd is the satisfaction derived from that which has less or from that\nwhich has more existence the truer?\nClearly, from that which has more.\nWhat classes of things have a greater share of pure {298} existence in\nyour judgment--those of which food and drink and condiments and all kinds\nof sustenance are examples, or the class which contains true opinion and\nknowledge and *585C* mind and all the different kinds of virtue? Put the\nquestion in this way:--Which has a more pure being--that which is\nconcerned with the invariable, the immortal, and the true, and is of such\na nature, and is found in such natures; or that which is concerned with\nand found in the variable and mortal, and is itself variable and mortal?\nFar purer, he replied, is the being of that which is concerned with the\ninvariable.\nAnd does the essence of the invariable partake of knowledge in the same\ndegree as of essence?\nYes, of knowledge in the same degree.\nAnd of truth in the same degree?\nYes.\nAnd, conversely, that which has less of truth will also have less of\nessence?\nNecessarily.\n*585D* Then, in general, those kinds of things which are in the service of\nthe body have less of truth and essence than those which are in the\nservice of the soul?\nFar less.\nAnd has not the body itself less of truth and essence than the soul?\nYes.\nWhat is filled with more real existence, and actually has a more real\nexistence, is more really filled than that which is filled with less real\nexistence and is less real?\nOf course.\n[Sidenote: The pleasures of the sensual and also of the passionate element\nare unreal and mixed.]\nAnd if there be a pleasure in being filled with that which is according to\nnature, that which is more really filled with *585E* more real being will\nmore really and truly enjoy true pleasure; whereas that which participates\nin less real being will be less truly and surely satisfied, and will\nparticipate in an illusory and less real pleasure?\nUnquestionably.\n*586A* Those then who know not wisdom and virtue, and are always busy with\ngluttony and sensuality, go down and up again as far as the mean; and in\nthis region they move at {299} random throughout life, but they never pass\ninto the true upper world; thither they neither look, nor do they ever\nfind their way, neither are they truly filled with true being, nor do they\ntaste of pure and abiding pleasure. Like cattle, with their eyes always\nlooking down and their heads stooping to the earth, that is, to the\ndining-table, they fatten and feed *586B* and breed, and, in their\nexcessive love of these delights, they kick and butt at one another with\nhorns and hoofs which are made of iron; and they kill one another by\nreason of their insatiable lust. For they fill themselves with that which\nis not substantial, and the part of themselves which they fill is also\nunsubstantial and incontinent.\nVerily, Socrates, said Glaucon, you describe the life of the many like an\noracle.\nTheir pleasures are mixed with pains--how can they be otherwise? For they\nare mere shadows and pictures of *586C* the true, and are coloured by\ncontrast, which exaggerates both light and shade, and so they implant in\nthe minds of fools insane desires of themselves; and they are fought about\nas Stesichorus says that the Greeks fought about the shadow of Helen at\nTroy in ignorance of the truth.\nSomething of that sort must inevitably happen.\nAnd must not the like happen with the spirited or passionate element of\nthe soul? Will not the passionate man who carries his passion into action,\nbe in the like case, whether he is envious and ambitious, or violent and\ncontentious, or angry and discontented, if he be seeking to attain *586D*\nhonour and victory and the satisfaction of his anger without reason or\nsense?\nYes, he said, the same will happen with the spirited element also.\n[Sidenote: Both kinds of pleasures are attained in the highest degree when\nthe desires which seek them are under the guidance of reason.]\nThen may we not confidently assert that the lovers of money and honour,\nwhen they seek their pleasures under the guidance and in the company of\nreason and knowledge, and pursue after and win the pleasures which wisdom\nshows them, will also have the truest pleasures in the highest degree\nwhich is attainable to them, inasmuch as they follow truth; *586E* and\nthey will have the pleasures which are natural to them, if that which is\nbest for each one is also most natural to him?\nYes, certainly; the best is the most natural. {300}\nAnd when the whole soul follows the philosophical principle, and there is\nno division, the several parts are just, *587A* and do each of them their\nown business, and enjoy severally the best and truest pleasures of which\nthey are capable?\nExactly.\nBut when either of the two other principles prevails, it fails in\nattaining its own pleasure, and compels the rest to pursue after a\npleasure which is a shadow only and which is not their own?\nTrue.\nAnd the greater the interval which separates them from philosophy and\nreason, the more strange and illusive will be the pleasure?\nYes.\nAnd is not that farthest from reason which is at the greatest distance\nfrom law and order?\nClearly.\nAnd the lustful and tyrannical desires are, as we saw, at the *587B*\ngreatest distance?\nYes.\nAnd the royal and orderly desires are nearest?\nYes.\nThen the tyrant will live at the greatest distance from true or natural\npleasure, and the king at the least?\nCertainly.\nBut if so, the tyrant will live most unpleasantly, and the king most\npleasantly?\nInevitably.\n[Sidenote: The measure of the interval which separates the king from the\ntyrant,]\nWould you know the measure of the interval which separates them?\nWill you tell me?\nThere appear to be three pleasures, one genuine and two *587C* spurious:\nnow the transgression of the tyrant reaches a point beyond the spurious;\nhe has run away from the region of law and reason, and taken up his abode\nwith certain slave pleasures which are his satellites, and the measure of\nhis inferiority can only be expressed in a figure.\nHow do you mean?\nI assume, I said, that the tyrant is in the third place from the oligarch;\nthe democrat was in the middle? {301}\nYes.\nAnd if there is truth in what has preceded, he will be wedded to an image\nof pleasure which is thrice removed as to truth from the pleasure of the\noligarch?\nHe will.\nAnd the oligarch is third from the royal; since we count *587D* as one\nroyal and aristocratical?\nYes, he is third.\nThen the tyrant is removed from true pleasure by the space of a number\nwhich is three times three?\nManifestly.\n[Sidenote: expressed under the symbol of a cube corresponding to the\nnumber 729.]\nThe shadow then of tyrannical pleasure determined by the number of length\nwill be a plane figure.\nCertainly.\nAnd if you raise the power and make the plane a solid, there is no\ndifficulty in seeing how vast is the interval by which the tyrant is\nparted from the king.\nYes; the arithmetician will easily do the sum.\nOr if some person begins at the other end and measures *587E* the interval\nby which the king is parted from the tyrant in truth of pleasure, he will\nfind him, when the multiplication is completed, living 729 times more\npleasantly, and the tyrant more painfully by this same interval.\nWhat a wonderful calculation! And how enormous is the *588A* distance\nwhich separates the just from the unjust in regard to pleasure and pain!\n[Sidenote: which is _nearly_ the number of days and nights in a year.]\nYet a true calculation, I said, and a number which nearly concerns human\nlife, if human beings are concerned with days and nights and months and\nyears[3].\n[Footnote 3: 729 _nearly_ equals the number of days and nights in the\nyear.]\nYes, he said, human life is certainly concerned with them.\nThen if the good and just man be thus superior in pleasure to the evil and\nunjust, his superiority will be infinitely greater in propriety of life\nand in beauty and virtue?\nImmeasurably greater.\n[Sidenote: Refutation of Thrasymachus.]\n*588B* Well, I said, and now having arrived at this stage of the argument,\nwe may revert to the words which brought us hither: Was not some one\nsaying that injustice was a gain to the perfectly unjust who was reputed\nto be just?\nYes, that was said. {302}\nNow then, having determined the power and quality of justice and\ninjustice, let us have a little conversation with him.\nWhat shall we say to him?\nLet us make an image of the soul, that he may have his own words presented\nbefore his eyes.\n*588C* Of what sort?\n[Sidenote: The triple animal who has outwardly the image of a man.]\nAn ideal image of the soul, like the composite creations of ancient\nmythology, such as the Chimera or Scylla or Cerberus, and there are many\nothers in which two or more different natures are said to grow into one.\nThere are said of have been such unions.\nThen do you now model the form of a multitudinous, many-headed monster,\nhaving a ring of heads of all manner of beasts, tame and wild, which he is\nable to generate and metamorphose at will.\n*588D* You suppose marvellous powers in the artist; but, as language is\nmore pliable than wax or any similar substance, let there be such a model\nas you propose.\nSuppose now that you make a second form as of a lion, and a third of a\nman, the second smaller than the first, and the third smaller than the\nsecond.\nThat, he said, is an easier task; and I have made them as you say.\nAnd now join them, and let the three grow into one.\nThat has been accomplished.\nNext fashion the outside of them into a single image, as of a man, so that\nhe who is not able to look within, and sees *588E* only the outer hull,\nmay believe the beast to be a single human creature.\nI have done so, he said.\n[Sidenote: Will any one say that we should strengthen the monster and the\nlion at the expense of the man?]\nAnd now, to him who maintains that it is profitable for the human creature\nto be unjust, and unprofitable to be just, let us reply that, if he be\nright, it is profitable for this creature to feast the multitudinous\nmonster and strengthen the lion and *589A* the lion-like qualities, but to\nstarve and weaken the man, who is consequently liable to be dragged about\nat the mercy of either of the other two; and he is not to attempt to\nfamiliarize or harmonize them with one another--he ought rather to suffer\nthem to fight and bite and devour one another. {303}\nCertainly, he said; that is what the approver of injustice says.\nTo him the supporter of justice makes answer that he should ever so speak\nand act as to give the man within him in some way or other the most\ncomplete mastery over the *589B* entire human creature. He should watch\nover the many-headed monster like a good husbandman, fostering and\ncultivating the gentle qualities, and preventing the wild ones from\ngrowing; he should be making the lion-heart his ally, and in common care\nof them all should be uniting the several parts with one another and with\nhimself.\nYes, he said, that is quite what the maintainer of justice say.\nAnd so from every point of view, whether of pleasure, *589C* honour, or\nadvantage, the approver of justice is right and speaks the truth, and the\ndisapprover is wrong and false and ignorant?\nYes, from every point of view.\n[Sidenote: For the noble principle subjects the beast to the man, the\nignoble the man to the beast.]\nCome, now, and let us gently reason with the unjust, who is not\nintentionally in error. 'Sweet Sir,' we will say to him, 'what think you\nof things esteemed noble and ignoble? *589D* Is not the noble that which\nsubjects the beast to the man, or rather to the god in man; and the\nignoble that which subjects the man to the beast?' He can hardly avoid\nsaying Yes--can he now?\nNot if he has any regard for my opinion.\n[Sidenote: A man would not be the gainer if he sold his child: how much\nworse to sell his soul!]\nBut, if he agree so far, we may ask him to answer another question: 'Then\nhow would a man profit if he received gold and silver on the condition\nthat he was to enslave the noblest part of him to the worst? Who can\nimagine that a man who *589E* sold his son or daughter into slavery for\nmoney, especially if he sold them into the hands of fierce and evil men,\nwould be the gainer, however large might be the sum which he received? And\nwill any one say that he is not a miserable *590A* caitiff who\nremorselessly sells his own divine being to that which is most godless and\ndetestable? Eriphyle took the necklace as the price of her husband's life,\nbut he is taking a bribe in order to compass a worse ruin.'\nYes, said Glaucon, far worse--I will answer for him.\nHas not the intemperate been censured of old, because in {304} him the\nhuge multiform monster is allowed to be too much at large?\nClearly.\n[Sidenote: Proofs:--(1) Men are blamed for the predominance of the lower\nnature,]\nAnd men are blamed for pride and bad temper when the *590B* lion and\nserpent element in them disproportionately grows and gains strength?\nYes.\nAnd luxury and softness are blamed, because they relax and weaken this\nsame creature, and make a coward of him?\nVery true.\nAnd is not a man reproached for flattery and meanness who subordinates the\nspirited animal to the unruly monster, and, for the sake of money, of\nwhich he can never have enough, habituates him in the days of his youth to\nbe trampled in the mire, and from being a lion to become a monkey?\n*590C* True, he said.\n[Sidenote: as well as for the meanness of their employments and\ncharacter:]\nAnd why are mean employments and manual arts a reproach? Only because they\nimply a natural weakness of the higher principle; the individual is unable\nto control the creatures within him, but has to court them, and his great\nstudy is how to flatter them.\nSuch appears to be the reason.\n[Sidenote: (2) It is admitted that every one should be the servant of a\ndivine rule, or at any rate be kept under control by an external\nauthority:]\nAnd therefore, being desirous of placing him under a rule like that of the\nbest, we say that he ought to be the servant *590D* of the best, in whom\nthe Divine rules; not, as Thrasymachus supposed, to the injury of the\nservant, but because every one had better be ruled by divine wisdom\ndwelling within him; or, if this be impossible, then by an external\nauthority, in order that we may be all, as far as possible, under the same\ngovernment, friends and equals.\nTrue, he said.\n[Sidenote: (3) The care taken of children shows that we seek to establish\nin them a higher principle.]\n*590E* And this is clearly seen to be the intention of the law, which is\nthe ally of the whole city; and is seen also in the authority which we\nexercise over children, and the refusal to let them be free until we have\nestablished in them a principle analogous to the constitution of a state,\nand by *591A* cultivation of this higher element have set up in their\nhearts a guardian and ruler like our own, and when this is done they may\ngo their ways.\nYes, he said, the purpose of the law is manifest. {305}\nFrom what point of view, then, and on what ground can we say that a man is\nprofited by injustice or intemperance or other baseness, which will make\nhim a worse man, even though he acquire money or power by his wickedness?\nFrom no point of view at all.\n[Sidenote: The wise man will employ his energies in freeing and\nharmonizing the nobler elements of his nature and in regulating his bodily\nhabits.]\nWhat shall he profit, if his injustice be undetected and unpunished?\n*591B* He who is undetected only gets worse, whereas he who is detected\nand punished has the brutal part of his nature silenced and humanized; the\ngentler element in him is liberated, and his whole soul is perfected and\nennobled by the acquirement of justice and temperance and wisdom, more\nthan the body ever is by receiving gifts of beauty, strength and health,\nin proportion as the soul is more honourable than the body.\nCertainly, he said.\n*591C* To this nobler purpose the man of understanding will devote the\nenergies of his life. And in the first place, he will honour studies which\nimpress these qualities on his soul and will disregard others?\nClearly, he said.\n[Sidenote: His first aim not health but harmony of soul.]\nIn the next place, he will regulate his bodily habit and training, and so\nfar will he be from yielding to brutal and irrational pleasures, that he\nwill regard even health as quite a secondary matter; his first object will\nbe not that he may *591D* be fair or strong or well, unless he is likely\nthereby to gain temperance, but he will always desire so to attemper the\nbody as to preserve the harmony of the soul?\nCertainly he will, if he has true music in him.\nAnd in the acquisition of wealth there is a principle of order and harmony\nwhich he will also observe; he will not allow himself to be dazzled by the\nfoolish applause of the world, and heap up riches to his own infinite\nharm?\nCertainly not, he said.\n[Sidenote: He will not heap up riches,]\n*591E* He will look at the city which is within him, and take heed that no\ndisorder occur in it, such as might arise either from superfluity or from\nwant; and upon this principle he will regulate his property and gain or\nspend according to his means.\nVery true.\n[Sidenote: and he will only accept such political honours as will not\ndeteriorate his character.]\nAnd, for the same reason, he will gladly accept and enjoy {306} *592A*\nsuch honours as he deems likely to make him a better man; but those,\nwhether private or public, which are likely to disorder his life, he will\navoid?\nThen, if that is his motive, he will not be a statesman.\nBy the dog of Egypt, he will! in the city which is his own he certainly\nwill, though in the land of his birth perhaps not, unless he have a divine\ncall.\n[Sidenote: He has a city of his own, and the ideal pattern of this will be\nthe law of his life.]\nI understand; you mean that he will be a ruler in the city of which we are\nthe founders, and which exists in idea only; *592B* for I do not believe\nthat there is such an one anywhere on earth?\nIn heaven, I replied, there is laid up a pattern of it, methinks, which he\nwho desires may behold, and beholding, may set his own house in order[4].\nBut whether such an one exists, or ever will exist in fact, is no matter;\nfor he will live after the manner of that city, having nothing to do with\nany other.\n[Footnote 4: Or 'take up his abode there.']\nI think so, he said.\nBOOK X.\n[Sidenote: _Republic X._ Socrates, Glaucon.]\n*595A* Of the many excellences which I perceive in the order of our State,\nthere is none which upon reflection pleases me better than the rule about\npoetry.\nTo what do you refer?\nTo the rejection of imitative poetry, which certainly ought not to be\nreceived; as I see far more clearly now that *595B* the parts of the soul\nhave been distinguished.\nWhat do you mean?\n[Sidenote: Poetical imitations are ruinous to the mind of the hearer.]\nSpeaking in confidence, for I should not like to have my words repeated to\nthe tragedians and the rest of the imitative tribe--but I do not mind\nsaying to you, that all poetical imitations are ruinous to the\nunderstanding of the hearers, and that the knowledge of their true nature\nis the only antidote to them.\nExplain the purport of your remark.\nWell, I will tell you, although I have always from my earliest youth had\nan awe and love of Homer, which even now makes the words falter on my\nlips, for he is the great *595C* captain and teacher of the whole of that\ncharming tragic company; but a man is not to be reverenced more than the\ntruth, and therefore I will speak out.\nVery good, he said.\nListen to me then, or rather, answer me.\nPut your question.\n[Sidenote: The nature of imitation.]\nCan you tell me what imitation is? for I really do not know.\nA likely thing, then, that I should know.\n*596A* Why not? for the duller eye may often see a thing sooner than the\nkeener.\nVery true, he said; but in your presence, even if I had any (308} faint\nnotion, I could not muster courage to utter it. Will you enquire yourself?\nWell then, shall we begin the enquiry in our usual manner: Whenever a\nnumber of individuals have a common name, we assume them to have also a\ncorresponding idea or form:--do you understand me?\nI do.\n[Sidenote: The idea is one, but the objects comprehended under it are\nmany.]\nLet us take any common instance; there are beds and *596B* tables in the\nworld--plenty of them, are there not?\nYes.\nBut there are only two ideas or forms of them--one the idea of a bed, the\nother of a table.\nTrue.\nAnd the maker of either of them makes a bed or he makes a table for our\nuse, in accordance with the idea--that is our way of speaking in this and\nsimilar instances--but no artificer makes the ideas themselves: how could\nhe?\nImpossible.\nAnd there is another artist,--I should like to know what you would say of\nhim.\n*596C* Who is he?\n[Sidenote: The universal creator an extraordinary person. But note also\nthat everybody is a creator in a sense. For all things may be made by the\nreflection of them in a mirror.]\nOne who is the maker of all the works of all other workmen.\nWhat an extraordinary man!\nWait a little, and there will be more reason for your saying so. For this\nis he who is able to make not only vessels of every kind, but plants and\nanimals, himself and all other things--the earth and heaven, and the\nthings which are in heaven or under the earth; he makes the gods also.\n*596D* He must be a wizard and no mistake.\nOh! you are incredulous, are you? Do you mean that there is no such maker\nor creator, or that in one sense there might be a maker of all these\nthings but in another not? Do you see that there is a way in which you\ncould make them all yourself?\nWhat way?\nAn easy way enough; or rather, there are many ways in which the feat might\nbe quickly and easily accomplished, none quicker than that of turning a\nmirror round and round--you *596E* would soon enough make the sun and the\nheavens, and the earth and yourself, and other animals and plants, and\n{309} all the other things of which we were just now speaking, in the\nmirror.\nYes, he said; but they would be appearances only.\n[Sidenote: But this is an appearance only: and the painter too is a maker\nof appearances.]\nVery good, I said, you are coming to the point now. And the painter too\nis, as I conceive, just such another--a creator of appearances, is he not?\nOf course.\nBut then I suppose you will say that what he creates is untrue. And yet\nthere is a sense in which the painter also creates a bed?\nYes, he said, but not a real bed.\n*597A* And what of the maker of the bed? were you not saying that he too\nmakes, not the idea which, according to our view, is the essence of the\nbed, but only a particular bed?\nYes, I did.\nThen if he does not make that which exists he cannot make true existence,\nbut only some semblance of existence; and if any one were to say that the\nwork of the maker of the bed, or of any other workman, has real existence,\nhe could hardly be supposed to be speaking the truth.\nAt any rate, he replied, philosophers would say that he was not speaking\nthe truth.\nNo wonder, then, that his work too is an indistinct expression of truth.\n*597B* No wonder.\nSuppose now that by the light of the examples just offered we enquire who\nthis imitator is?\nIf you please.\n[Sidenote: Three beds and three makers of beds.]\nWell then, here are three beds: one existing in nature, which is made by\nGod, as I think that we may say--for no one else can be the maker?\nNo.\nThere is another which is the work of the carpenter?\nYes.\nAnd the work of the painter is a third?\nYes.\nBeds, then, are of three kinds, and there are three artists who\nsuperintend them: God, the maker of the bed, and the painter?\nYes, there are three of them. {310}\n*597C* God, whether from choice or from necessity, made one bed in nature\nand one only; two or more such ideal beds neither ever have been nor ever\nwill be made by God.\nWhy is that?\n[Sidenote: (1) The creator. God could only make one bed; if he made two, a\nthird would still appear behind them.]\nBecause even if He had made but two, a third would still appear behind\nthem which both of them would have for their idea, and that would be the\nideal bed and not the two others.\nVery true, he said.\n*597D* God knew this, and He desired to be the real maker of a real bed,\nnot a particular maker of a particular bed, and therefore He created a bed\nwhich is essentially and by nature one only.\nSo we believe.\nShall we, then, speak of Him as the natural author or maker of the bed?\nYes, he replied; inasmuch as by the natural process of creation He is the\nauthor of this and of all other things.\n[Sidenote: (2) The human maker.]\nAnd what shall we say of the carpenter--is not he also the maker of the\nbed?\nYes.\nBut would you call the painter a creator and maker?\nCertainly not.\nYet if he is not the maker, what is he in relation to the bed?\n[Sidenote: (3) The imitator, i.e. the painter or poet,]\n*597E* I think, he said, that we may fairly designate him as the imitator\nof that which the others make.\nGood, I said; then you call him who is third in the descent from nature an\nimitator?\nCertainly, he said.\nAnd the tragic poet is an imitator, and therefore, like all other\nimitators, he is thrice removed from the king and from the truth?\nThat appears to be so.\nThen about the imitator we are agreed. And what about *598A* the painter?\n--I would like to know whether he may be thought to imitate that which\noriginally exists in nature, or only the creations of artists?\nThe latter.\nAs they are or as they appear? you have still to determine this. {311}\nWhat do you mean?\n[Sidenote: whose art is one of imitation or appearance and a long way\nremoved from the truth.]\nI mean, that you may look at a bed from different points of view,\nobliquely or directly or from any other point of view, and the bed will\nappear different, but there is no difference in reality. And the same of\nall things.\nYes, he said, the difference is only apparent.\n*598B* Now let me ask you another question: Which is the art of painting\ndesigned to be--an imitation of things as they are, or as they appear--of\nappearance or of reality?\nOf appearance.\n[Sidenote: Any one who does all things does only a very small part of\nthem.]\nThen the imitator, I said, is a long way off the truth, and can do all\nthings because he lightly touches on a small part of them, and that part\nan image. For example: A painter will paint a cobbler, carpenter, or any\nother artist, though he *598C* knows nothing of their arts; and, if he is\na good artist, he may deceive children or simple persons, when he shows\nthem his picture of a carpenter from a distance, and they will fancy that\nthey are looking at a real carpenter.\nCertainly.\n[Sidenote: Any one who pretends to know all things is ignorant of the very\nnature of knowledge.]\nAnd whenever any one informs us that he has found a man who knows all the\narts, and all things else that anybody knows, and every single thing with\na higher degree of accuracy *598D* than any other man--whoever tells us\nthis, I think that we can only imagine him to be a simple creature who is\nlikely to have been deceived by some wizard or actor whom he met, and whom\nhe thought all-knowing, because he himself was unable to analyse the\nnature of knowledge and ignorance and imitation.\nMost true.\n[Sidenote: And he who attributes such universal knowledge to the poets is\nsimilarly deceived.]\nAnd so, when we hear persons saying that the tragedians, and Homer, who is\nat their head, know all the arts and all *598E* things human, virtue as\nwell as vice, and divine things too, for that the good poet cannot compose\nwell unless he knows his subject, and that he who has not this knowledge\ncan never be a poet, we ought to consider whether here also there may not\nbe a similar illusion. Perhaps they may have come across imitators and\nbeen deceived by them; they may not have remembered when they saw their\nworks that *599A* these were but imitations thrice removed from the truth,\nand could easily be made without any knowledge of the truth, {312} because\nthey are appearances only and not realities? Or, after all, they may be in\nthe right, and poets do really know the things about which they seem to\nthe many to speak so well?\nThe question, he said, should by all means be considered.\n[Sidenote: He who could make the original would not make the image.]\nNow do you suppose that if a person were able to make the original as well\nas the image, he would seriously devote himself to the image-making\nbranch? Would he allow imitation to be the ruling principle of his life,\nas if he had *599B* nothing higher in him?\nI should say not.\nThe real artist, who knew what he was imitating, would be interested in\nrealities and not in imitations; and would desire to leave as memorials of\nhimself works many and fair; and, instead of being the author of\nencomiums, he would prefer to be the theme of them.\nYes, he said, that would be to him a source of much greater honour and\nprofit.\n[Sidenote: If Homer had been a legislator, or general, or inventor,]\nThen, I said, we must put a question to Homer; not about *599C* medicine,\nor any of the arts to which his poems only incidentally refer: we are not\ngoing to ask him, or any other poet, whether he has cured patients like\nAsclepius, or left behind him a school of medicine such as the Asclepiads\nwere, or whether he only talks about medicine and other arts at\nsecond-hand; but we have a right to know respecting military tactics,\npolitics, education, which are the chiefest *599D* and noblest subjects of\nhis poems, and we may fairly ask him about them. 'Friend Homer,' then we\nsay to him, 'if you are only in the second remove from truth in what you\nsay of virtue, and not in the third--not an image maker or imitator--and\nif you are able to discern what pursuits make men better or worse in\nprivate or public life, tell us what State was ever better governed by\nyour help? The good *599E* order of Lacedaemon is due to Lycurgus, and\nmany other cities great and small have been similarly benefited by others;\nbut who says that you have been a good legislator to them and have done\nthem any good? Italy and Sicily boast of Charondas, and there is Solon who\nis renowned among us; but what city has anything to say about you?' Is\nthere any city which he might name?\nI think not, said Glaucon; not even the Homerids themselves pretend that\nhe was a legislator. {313}\n*600A* Well, but is there any war on record which was carried on\nsuccessfully by him, or aided by his counsels, when he was alive?\nThere is not.\nOr is there any invention[1] of his, applicable to the arts or to human\nlife, such as Thales the Milesian or Anacharsis the Scythian, and other\ningenious men have conceived, which is attributed to him?\n[Footnote: Omitting [Greek: ei)s].]\nThere is absolutely nothing of the kind.\nBut, if Homer never did any public service, was he privately a guide or\nteacher of any? Had he in his lifetime friends *600B* who loved to\nassociate with him, and who handed down to posterity an Homeric way of\nlife, such as was established by Pythagoras who was so greatly beloved for\nhis wisdom, and whose followers are to this day quite celebrated for the\norder which was named after him?\nNothing of the kind is recorded of him. For surely, Socrates, Creophylus,\nthe companion of Homer, that child of flesh, whose name always makes us\nlaugh, might be more justly ridiculed for his stupidity, if, as is said,\nHomer was *600C* greatly neglected by him and others in his own day when\nhe was alive?\n[Sidenote: or had done anything else for the improvement of mankind, he\nwould not have been allowed to starve.]\nYes, I replied, that is the tradition. But can you imagine, Glaucon, that\nif Homer had really been able to educate and improve mankind--if he had\npossessed knowledge and not been a mere imitator--can you imagine, I say,\nthat he would not have had many followers, and been honoured and loved by\nthem? Protagoras of Abdera, and Prodicus of Ceos, and a host of others,\nhave only to whisper to their contemporaries: *600D* 'You will never be\nable to manage either your own house or your own State until you appoint\nus to be your ministers of education'--and this ingenious device of theirs\nhas such an effect in making men love them that their companions all but\ncarry them about on their shoulders. And is it conceivable that the\ncontemporaries of Homer, or again of Hesiod, would have allowed either of\nthem to go about as rhapsodists, if they had really been able to make\nmankind virtuous? Would they not have been as unwilling to part with them\nas with gold, and have compelled them to stay {314} *600E* at home with\nthem? Or, if the master would not stay, then the disciples would have\nfollowed him about everywhere, until they had got education enough?\nYes, Socrates, that, I think, is quite true.\n[Sidenote: The poets, like the painters, are but imitators;]\nThen must we not infer that all these poetical individuals, beginning with\nHomer, are only imitators; they copy images *601A* of virtue and the like,\nbut the truth they never reach? The poet is like a painter who, as we have\nalready observed, will make a likeness of a cobbler though he understands\nnothing of cobbling; and his picture is good enough for those who know no\nmore than he does, and judge only by colours and figures.\nQuite so.\nIn like manner the poet with his words and phrases[2] may be said to lay\non the colours of the several arts, himself understanding their nature\nonly enough to imitate them; and other people, who are as ignorant as he\nis, and judge only from his words, imagine that if he speaks of cobbling,\nor of military tactics, or of anything else, in metre and harmony *601B*\nand rhythm, he speaks very well--such is the sweet influence which melody\nand rhythm by nature have. And I think that you must have observed again\nand again what a poor appearance the tales of poets make when stripped of\nthe colours which music puts upon them, and recited in simple prose.\n[Footnote 2: Or, 'with his nouns and verbs.']\nYes, he said.\nThey are like faces which were never really beautiful, but only blooming;\nand now the bloom of youth has passed away from them?\nExactly.\n[Sidenote: they know nothing of true existence.]\nHere is another point: The imitator or maker of the image knows nothing of\ntrue existence; he knows appearances only. *601C* Am I not right?\nYes.\nThen let us have a clear understanding, and not be satisfied with half an\nexplanation.\nProceed.\nOf the painter we say that he will paint reins, and he will paint a bit?\nYes. {315}\nAnd the worker in leather and brass will make them?\nCertainly.\n[Sidenote: The maker has more knowledge than the imitator, but less than\nthe user. Three arts, using, making, imitating.]\nBut does the painter know the right form of the bit and reins? Nay, hardly\neven the workers in brass and leather who make them; only the horseman who\nknows how to use them--he knows their right form.\nMost true.\nAnd may we not say the same of all things?\nWhat?\n*601D* That there are three arts which are concerned with all things: one\nwhich uses, another which makes, a third which imitates them?\nYes.\n[Sidenote: Goodness of things relative to use; hence the maker of them is\ninstructed by the user.]\nAnd the excellence or beauty or truth of every structure, animate or\ninanimate, and of every action of man, is relative to the use for which\nnature or the artist has intended them.\nTrue.\nThen the user of them must have the greatest experience of them, and he\nmust indicate to the maker the good or bad qualities which develop\nthemselves in use; for example, the flute-player will tell the flute-maker\nwhich of his flutes is satisfactory to the performer; he will tell him how\nhe ought *601E* to make them, and the other will attend to his\ninstructions?\nOf course.\nThe one knows and therefore speaks with authority about the goodness and\nbadness of flutes, while the other, confiding in him, will do what he is\ntold by him?\nTrue.\n[Sidenote: The maker has belief and not knowledge, the imitator neither.]\nThe instrument is the same, but about the excellence or badness of it the\nmaker will only attain to a correct belief; and this he will gain from him\nwho knows, by talking to him *602A* and being compelled to hear what he\nhas to say, whereas the user will have knowledge?\nTrue.\nBut will the imitator have either? Will he know from use whether or no his\ndrawing is correct or beautiful? or will he have right opinion from being\ncompelled to associate with another who knows and gives him instructions\nabout what he should draw? {316}\nNeither.\nThen he will no more have true opinion than he will have knowledge about\nthe goodness or badness of his imitations?\nI suppose not.\nThe imitative artist will be in a brilliant state of intelligence about\nhis own creations?\nNay, very much the reverse.\n*602B* And still he will go on imitating without knowing what makes a\nthing good or bad, and may be expected therefore to imitate only that\nwhich appears to be good to the ignorant multitude?\nJust so.\nThus far then we are pretty well agreed that the imitator has no knowledge\nworth mentioning of what he imitates. Imitation is only a kind of play or\nsport, and the tragic poets, whether they write in Iambic or in Heroic\nverse, are imitators in the highest degree?\nVery true.\n[Sidenote: Imitation has been proved to be thrice removed from the truth.]\n*602C* And now tell me, I conjure you, has not imitation been shown by us\nto be concerned with that which is thrice removed from the truth?\nCertainly.\nAnd what is the faculty in man to which imitation is addressed?\nWhat do you mean?\nI will explain: The body which is large when seen near, appears small when\nseen at a distance?\nTrue.\nAnd the same object appears straight when looked at out of the water, and\ncrooked when in the water; and the concave becomes convex, owing to the\nillusion about colours to which the sight is liable. Thus every sort of\nconfusion is revealed within us; *602D* and this is that weakness of the\nhuman mind on which the art of conjuring and of deceiving by light and\nshadow and other ingenious devices imposes, having an effect upon us like\nmagic.\nTrue.\n[Sidenote: The art of measuring given to man that he may correct the\nvariety of appearances.]\nAnd the arts of measuring and numbering and weighing come to the rescue of\nthe human understanding--there {317} is the beauty of them--and the\napparent greater or less, or more or heavier, no longer have the mastery\nover us, but give way before calculation and measure and weight?\nMost true.\n*602E* And this, surely, must be the work of the calculating and rational\nprinciple in the soul?\nTo be sure.\nAnd when this principle measures and certifies that some things are equal,\nor that some are greater or less than others, there occurs an apparent\ncontradiction?\nTrue.\nBut were we not saying that such a contradiction is impossible--the same\nfaculty cannot have contrary opinions at the same time about the same\nthing?\nVery true.\n*603A* Then that part of the soul which has an opinion contrary to measure\nis not the same with that which has an opinion in accordance with measure?\nTrue.\nAnd the better part of the soul is likely to be that which trusts to\nmeasure and calculation?\nCertainly.\nAnd that which is opposed to them is one of the inferior principles of the\nsoul?\nNo doubt.\nThis was the conclusion at which I was seeking to arrive when I said that\npainting or drawing, and imitation in general, when doing their own proper\nwork, are far removed from truth, and the companions and friends and\nassociates of *603B* a principle within us which is equally removed from\nreason, and that they have no true or healthy aim.\nExactly.\n[Sidenote: The productions of the imitative arts are bastard and\nillegitimate.]\nThe imitative art is an inferior who marries an inferior, and has inferior\noffspring.\nVery true.\nAnd is this confined to the sight only, or does it extend to the hearing\nalso, relating in fact to what we term poetry?\nProbably the same would be true of poetry.\nDo not rely, I said, on a probability derived from the analogy of\npainting; but let us examine further and see {318} *603C* whether the\nfaculty with which poetical imitation is concerned is good or bad.\nBy all means.\nWe may state the question thus:--Imitation imitates the actions of men,\nwhether voluntary or involuntary, on which, as they imagine, a good or bad\nresult has ensued, and they rejoice or sorrow accordingly. Is there\nanything more?\nNo, there is nothing else.\n[Sidenote: They imitate opposites;]\nBut in all this variety of circumstances is the man at unity *603D* with\nhimself--or rather, as in the instance of sight there was confusion and\nopposition in his opinions about the same things, so here also is there\nnot strife and inconsistency in his life? Though I need hardly raise the\nquestion again, for I remember that all this has been already admitted;\nand the soul has been acknowledged by us to be full of these and ten\nthousand similar oppositions occurring at the same moment?\nAnd we were right, he said.\nYes, I said, thus far we were right; but there was an *603E* omission\nwhich must now be supplied.\nWhat was the omission?\nWere we not saying that a good man, who has the misfortune to lose his son\nor anything else which is most dear to him, will bear the loss with more\nequanimity than another?\nYes.\n[Sidenote: they encourage weakness;]\nBut will he have no sorrow, or shall we say that although he cannot help\nsorrowing, he will moderate his sorrow?\nThe latter, he said, is the truer statement.\n*604A* Tell me: will he be more likely to struggle and hold out against\nhis sorrow when he is seen by his equals, or when he is alone?\nIt will make a great difference whether he is seen or not.\nWhen he is by himself he will not mind saying or doing many things which\nhe would be ashamed of any one hearing or seeing him do?\nTrue.\nThere is a principle of law and reason in him which bids him resist, as\nwell as a feeling of his misfortune which is *604B* forcing him to indulge\nhis sorrow? {319}\nTrue.\nBut when a man is drawn in two opposite directions, to and from the same\nobject, this, as we affirm, necessarily implies two distinct principles in\nhim?\nCertainly.\nOne of them is ready to follow the guidance of the law?\nHow do you mean?\n[Sidenote: they are at variance with the exhortations of philosophy;]\nThe law would say that to be patient under suffering is best, and that we\nshould not give way to impatience, as there is no knowing whether such\nthings are good or evil; and nothing is gained by impatience; also,\nbecause no human *604C* thing is of serious importance, and grief stands\nin the way of that which at the moment is most required.\nWhat is most required? he asked.\nThat we should take counsel about what has happened, and when the dice\nhave been thrown order our affairs in the way which reason deems best;\nnot, like children who have had a fall, keeping hold of the part struck\nand wasting time in setting up a howl, but always accustoming the soul\nforthwith *604D* to apply a remedy, raising up that which is sickly and\nfallen, banishing the cry of sorrow by the healing art.\nYes, he said, that is the true way of meeting the attacks of fortune.\nYes, I said; and the higher principle is ready to follow this suggestion\nof reason?\nClearly.\n[Sidenote: they recall trouble and sorrow;]\nAnd the other principle, which inclines us to recollection of our troubles\nand to lamentation, and can never have enough of them, we may call\nirrational, useless, and cowardly?\nIndeed, we may.\n*604E* And does not the latter--I mean the rebellious principle--furnish a\ngreat variety of materials for imitation? Whereas the wise and calm\ntemperament, being always nearly equable, is not easy to imitate or to\nappreciate when imitated, especially at a public festival when a\npromiscuous crowd is assembled in a theatre. For the feeling represented\nis one to which they are strangers.\n*605A* Certainly.\nThen the imitative poet who aims at being popular is not {320} by nature\nmade, nor is his art intended, to please or to affect the rational\nprinciple in the soul; but he will prefer the passionate and fitful\ntemper, which is easily imitated?\nClearly.\n[Sidenote: they minister in an inferior manner to an inferior principle in\nthe soul.]\nAnd now we may fairly take him and place him by the side of the painter,\nfor he is like him in two ways: first, inasmuch as his creations have an\ninferior degree of truth--in this, *605B* I say, he is like him; and he is\nalso like him in being concerned with an inferior part of the soul; and\ntherefore we shall be right in refusing to admit him into a well-ordered\nState, because he awakens and nourishes and strengthens the feelings and\nimpairs the reason. As in a city when the evil are permitted to have\nauthority and the good are put out of the way, so in the soul of man, as\nwe maintain, the imitative poet implants an evil constitution, for he\nindulges the *605C* irrational nature which has no discernment of greater\nand less, but thinks the same thing at one time great and at another\nsmall--he is a manufacturer of images and is very far removed from the\ntruth[3].\n[Footnote 3: Reading [Greek: ei)d\u00f4lopoiou=nta ... a)phest\u00f4=ta].]\nExactly.\nBut we have not yet brought forward the heaviest count in our\naccusation:--the power which poetry has of harming even the good (and\nthere are very few who are not harmed), is surely an awful thing?\nYes, certainly, if the effect is what you say.\n[Sidenote: How can we be right in sympathizing with the sorrows of poetry\nwhen we would fain restrain those of real life?]\nHear and judge: The best of us, as I conceive, when we listen to a passage\nof Homer, or one of the tragedians, in *605D* which he represents some\npitiful hero who is drawling out his sorrows in a long oration, or\nweeping, and smiting his breast--the best of us, you know, delight in\ngiving way to sympathy, and are in raptures at the excellence of the poet\nwho stirs our feelings most.\nYes, of course I know.\nBut when any sorrow of our own happens to us, then you may observe that we\npride ourselves on the opposite quality--we would fain be quiet and\npatient; this is the manly part, *605E* and the other which delighted us\nin the recitation is now deemed to be the part of a woman.\nVery true, he said. {321}\nNow can we be right in praising and admiring another who is doing that\nwhich any one of us would abominate and be ashamed of in his own person?\nNo, he said, that is certainly not reasonable.\n*606A* Nay, I said, quite reasonable from one point of view.\nWhat point of view?\n[Sidenote: We fail to observe that a sentimental pity soon creates a real\nweakness.]\nIf you consider, I said, that when in misfortune we feel a natural hunger\nand desire to relieve our sorrow by weeping and lamentation, and that this\nfeeling which is kept under control in our own calamities is satisfied and\ndelighted by the poets;--the better nature in each of us, not having been\nsufficiently trained by reason or habit, allows the sympathetic *606B*\nelement to break loose because the sorrow is another's; and the spectator\nfancies that there can be no disgrace to himself in praising and pitying\nany one who comes telling him what a good man he is, and making a fuss\nabout his troubles; he thinks that the pleasure is a gain, and why should\nhe be supercilious and lose this and the poem too? Few persons ever\nreflect, as I should imagine, that from the evil of other men something of\nevil is communicated to themselves. And so the feeling of sorrow which has\ngathered strength at the sight of the misfortunes of others is with\ndifficulty repressed in our own.\n*606C* How very true!\n[Sidenote: In like manner the love of comedy may turn a man into a\nbuffoon.]\nAnd does not the same hold also of the ridiculous? There are jests which\nyou would be ashamed to make yourself, and yet on the comic stage, or\nindeed in private, when you hear them, you are greatly amused by them, and\nare not at all disgusted at their unseemliness;--the case of pity is\nrepeated;--there is a principle in human nature which is disposed to raise\na laugh, and this which you once restrained by reason, because you were\nafraid of being thought a buffoon, is now let out again; and having\nstimulated the risible faculty at the theatre, you are betrayed\nunconsciously to yourself into playing the comic poet at home.\nQuite true, he said.\n*606D* And the same may be said of lust and anger and all the other\naffections, of desire and pain and pleasure, which are held to be\ninseparable from every action--in all of them {322} poetry feeds and\nwaters the passions instead of drying them up; she lets them rule,\nalthough they ought to be controlled, if mankind are ever to increase in\nhappiness and virtue.\nI cannot deny it.\n[Sidenote: We are lovers of Homer, but we must expel him from our State.]\n*606E* Therefore, Glaucon, I said, whenever you meet with any of the\neulogists of Homer declaring that he has been the educator of Hellas, and\nthat he is profitable for education and for the ordering of human things,\nand that you should *607A* take him up again and again and get to know him\nand regulate your whole life according to him, we may love and honour\nthose who say these things--they are excellent people, as far as their\nlights extend; and we are ready to acknowledge that Homer is the greatest\nof poets and first of tragedy writers; but we must remain firm in our\nconviction that hymns to the gods and praises of famous men are the only\npoetry which ought to be admitted into our State. For if you go beyond\nthis and allow the honeyed muse to enter, either in epic or lyric verse,\nnot law and the reason of mankind, which by common consent have ever been\ndeemed best, but pleasure and pain will be the rulers in our State.\nThat is most true, he said.\n[Sidenote: Apology to the poets.]\n*607B* And now since we have reverted to the subject of poetry, let this\nour defence serve to show the reasonableness of our former judgment in\nsending away out of our State an art having the tendencies which we have\ndescribed; for reason constrained us. But that she may not impute to us\nany harshness or want of politeness, let us tell her that there is an\nancient quarrel between philosophy and poetry; of which there are many\nproofs, such as the saying of 'the yelping hound howling at her lord,' or\nof one 'mighty in *607C* the vain talk of fools,' and 'the mob of sages\ncircumventing Zeus,' and the 'subtle thinkers who are beggars after all';\nand there are innumerable other signs of ancient enmity between them.\nNotwithstanding this, let us assure our sweet friend and the sister arts\nof imitation, that if she will only prove her title to exist in a\nwell-ordered State we shall be delighted to receive her--we are very\nconscious of her charms; but we may not on that account betray the truth.\n{323} I dare say, Glaucon, that you are as much charmed by her *607D* as\nI am, especially when she appears in Homer?\nYes, indeed, I am greatly charmed.\nShall I propose, then, that she be allowed to return from exile, but upon\nthis condition only--that she make a defence of herself in lyrical or some\nother metre?\nCertainly.\nAnd we may further grant to those of her defenders who are lovers of\npoetry and yet not poets the permission to speak in prose on her behalf:\nlet them show not only that she is pleasant but also useful to States and\nto human life, and we will listen in a kindly spirit; for if this can be\nproved *607E* we shall surely be the gainers--I mean, if there is a use in\npoetry as well as a delight?\nCertainly, he said, we shall be the gainers.\n[Sidenote: Poetry is attractive but not true.]\nIf her defence fails, then, my dear friend, like other persons who are\nenamoured of something, but put a restraint upon themselves when they\nthink their desires are opposed to their interests, so too must we after\nthe manner of lovers give her up, though not without a struggle. We too\nare inspired by that love of poetry which the education *608A* of noble\nStates has implanted in us, and therefore we would have her appear at her\nbest and truest; but so long as she is unable to make good her defence,\nthis argument of ours shall be a charm to us, which we will repeat to\nourselves while we listen to her strains; that we may not fall away into\nthe childish love of her which captivates the many. At all events we are\nwell aware[4] that poetry being such as we have described is not to be\nregarded seriously as attaining to the truth; and he who listens to her,\nfearing for the safety of the *608B* city which is within him, should be\non his guard against her seductions and make our words his law.\n[Footnote 4: Or, if we accept Madvig's ingenious but unnecessary\nemendation [Greek: a)|so/metha], 'At all events we will sing, that' &c.]\nYes, he said, I quite agree with you.\nYes, I said, my dear Glaucon, for great is the issue at stake, greater\nthan appears, whether a man is to be good or bad. And what will any one be\nprofited if under the influence of honour or money or power, aye, or under\nthe excitement of poetry, he neglect justice and virtue? {324}\nYes, he said; I have been convinced by the argument, as I believe that any\none else would have been.\n*608C* And yet no mention has been made of the greatest prizes and rewards\nwhich await virtue.\nWhat, are there any greater still? If there are, they must be of an\ninconceivable greatness.\n[Sidenote: The rewards of virtue extend not only to this little space of\nhuman life but to the whole of existence.]\nWhy, I said, what was ever great in a short time? The whole period of\nthree score years and ten is surely but a little thing in comparison with\neternity?\nSay rather 'nothing,' he replied.\nAnd should an immortal being seriously think of this little *608D* space\nrather than of the whole?\nOf the whole, certainly. But why do you ask?\nAre you not aware, I said, that the soul of man is immortal and\nimperishable?\nHe looked at me in astonishment, and said: No, by heaven: And are you\nreally prepared to maintain this?\nYes, I said, I ought to be, and you too--there is no difficulty in proving\nit.\nI see a great difficulty; but I should like to hear you state this\nargument of which you make so light.\nListen then.\nI am attending.\nThere is a thing which you call good and another which you call evil?\nYes, he replied.\n*608E* Would you agree with me in thinking that the corrupting and\ndestroying element is the evil, and the saving and improving element the\ngood?\nYes.\n[Sidenote: Everything has a good and an evil, and if not destroyed by its\nown evil, will not be destroyed by that of another.]\nAnd you admit that every thing has a good and also an evil; *609A* as\nophthalmia is the evil of the eyes and disease of the whole body; as\nmildew is of corn, and rot of timber, or rust of copper and iron: in\neverything, or in almost everything, there is an inherent evil and\ndisease?\nYes, he said.\nAnd anything which is infected by any of these evils is made evil, and at\nlast wholly dissolves and dies?\nTrue.\nThe vice and evil which is inherent in each is the destruction {325} of\neach; and if this does not destroy them there is nothing else that will;\n*609B* for good certainly will not destroy them, nor again, that which is\nneither good nor evil.\nCertainly not.\nIf, then, we find any nature which having this inherent corruption cannot\nbe dissolved or destroyed, we may be certain that of such a nature there\nis no destruction?\nThat may be assumed.\nWell, I said, and is there no evil which corrupts the soul?\nYes, he said, there are all the evils which we were just now *609C*\npassing in review: unrighteousness, intemperance, cowardice, ignorance.\n[Sidenote: Therefore, if the soul cannot be destroyed by moral evil, she\ncertainly will not be destroyed by physical evil.]\nBut does any of these dissolve or destroy her?--and here do not let us\nfall into the error of supposing that the unjust and foolish man, when he\nis detected, perishes through his own injustice, which is an evil of the\nsoul. Take the analogy of the body: The evil of the body is a disease\nwhich wastes and reduces and annihilates the body; and all the things of\nwhich we were just now speaking come to annihilation *609D* through their\nown corruption attaching to them and inhering in them and so destroying\nthem. Is not this true?\nYes.\nConsider the soul in like manner. Does the injustice or other evil which\nexists in the soul waste and consume her? Do they by attaching to the soul\nand inhering in her at last bring her to death, and so separate her from\nthe body?\nCertainly not.\nAnd yet, I said, it is unreasonable to suppose that anything can perish\nfrom without through affection of external evil which could not be\ndestroyed from within by a corruption of its own?\nIt is, he replied.\n*609E* Consider, I said, Glaucon, that even the badness of food, whether\nstaleness, decomposition, or any other bad quality, when confined to the\nactual food, is not supposed to destroy the body; although, if the badness\nof food communicates corruption to the body, then we should say that the\nbody *610A* has been destroyed by a corruption of itself, which is\ndisease, brought on by this; but that the body, being one thing, can be\ndestroyed by the badness of food, which {326} is another, and which does\nnot engender any natural infection--this we shall absolutely deny?\nVery true.\n[Sidenote: Evil means the contagion of evil, and the evil of the body does\nnot infect the soul.]\nAnd, on the same principle, unless some bodily evil can produce an evil of\nthe soul, we must not suppose that the soul, which is one thing, can be\ndissolved by any merely external evil which belongs to another?\nYes, he said, there is reason in that.\nEither, then, let us refute this conclusion, or, while it *610B* remains\nunrefuted, let us never say that fever, or any other disease, or the knife\nput to the throat, or even the cutting up of the whole body into the\nminutest pieces, can destroy the soul, until she herself is proved to\nbecome more unholy or unrighteous in consequence of these things being\ndone to the body; but that the soul, or anything else if not destroyed\n*610C* by an internal evil, can be destroyed by an external one, is not to\nbe affirmed by any man.\nAnd surely, he replied, no one will ever prove that the souls of men\nbecome more unjust in consequence of death.\nBut if some one who would rather not admit the immortality of the soul\nboldly denies this, and says that the dying do really become more evil and\nunrighteous, then, if the speaker is right, I suppose that injustice, like\ndisease, must be assumed to be fatal to the unjust, and that those who\ntake *610D* this disorder die by the natural inherent power of destruction\nwhich evil has, and which kills them sooner or later, but in quite another\nway from that in which, at present, the wicked receive death at the hands\nof others as the penalty of their deeds?\nNay, he said, in that case injustice, if fatal to the unjust, will not be\nso very terrible to him, for he will be delivered from evil. But I rather\nsuspect the opposite to be the truth, *610E* and that injustice which, if\nit have the power, will murder others, keeps the murderer alive--aye, and\nwell awake too; so far removed is her dwelling-place from being a house of\ndeath.\nTrue, I said; if the inherent natural vice or evil of the soul is unable\nto kill or destroy her, hardly will that which is appointed to be the\ndestruction of some other body, destroy a soul or anything else except\nthat of which it was appointed to be the destruction. {327}\nYes, that can hardly be.\nBut the soul which cannot be destroyed by an evil, whether *611A* inherent\nor external, must exist for ever, and if existing for ever, must be\nimmortal?\nCertainly.\n[Sidenote: If the soul is indestructible, the number of souls can never\nincrease or diminish.]\nThat is the conclusion, I said; and, if a true conclusion, then the souls\nmust always be the same, for if none be destroyed they will not diminish\nin number. Neither will they increase, for the increase of the immortal\nnatures must come from something mortal, and all things would thus end in\nimmortality.\nVery true.\n*611B* But this we cannot believe--reason will not allow us--any more than\nwe can believe the soul, in her truest nature, to be full of variety and\ndifference and dissimilarity.\nWhat do you mean? he said.\nThe soul, I said, being, as is now proven, immortal, must be the fairest\nof compositions and cannot be compounded of many elements?\nCertainly not.\n[Sidenote: The soul, if she is to be seen truly, should be stripped of the\naccidents of earth.]\nHer immortality is demonstrated by the previous argument, and there are\nmany other proofs; but to see her as she *611C* really is, not as we now\nbehold her, marred by communion with the body and other miseries, you must\ncontemplate her with the eye of reason, in her original purity; and then\nher beauty will be revealed, and justice and injustice and all the things\nwhich we have described will be manifested more clearly. Thus far, we have\nspoken the truth concerning her as she appears at present, but we must\nremember also that we have seen her only in a condition which may be\ncompared *611D* to that of the sea-god Glaucus, whose original image can\nhardly be discerned because his natural members are broken off and crushed\nand damaged by the waves in all sorts of ways, and incrustations have\ngrown over them of seaweed and shells and stones, so that he is more like\nsome monster than he is to his own natural form. And the soul which we\nbehold is in a similar condition, disfigured by ten thousand ills. But not\nthere, Glaucon, not there must we look.\nWhere then?\n[Sidenote: Her true conversation is with the eternal.]\n*611E* At her love of wisdom. Let us see whom she affects, and {328} what\nsociety and converse she seeks in virtue of her near kindred with the\nimmortal and eternal and divine; also how different she would become if\nwholly following this superior principle, and borne by a divine impulse\nout of the ocean in which she now is, and disengaged from the stones and\nshells and things of earth and rock which in wild variety spring up *612A*\naround her because she feeds upon earth, and is overgrown by the good\nthings of this life as they are termed: then you would see her as she is,\nand know whether she have one shape only or many, or what her nature is.\nOf her affections and of the forms which she takes in this present life I\nthink that we have now said enough.\nTrue, he replied.\n[Sidenote: Having put aside for argument's sake the rewards of virtue, we\nmay now claim to have them restored.]\nAnd thus, I said, we have fulfilled the conditions of the argument[5];\n*612B* we have not introduced the rewards and glories of justice, which,\nas you were saying, are to be found in Homer and Hesiod; but justice in\nher own nature has been shown to be best for the soul in her own nature.\nLet a man do what is just, whether he have the ring of Gyges or not, and\neven if in addition to the ring of Gyges he put on the helmet of Hades.\n[Footnote 5: Reading [Greek: a)pelusa/metha].]\nVery true.\nAnd now, Glaucon, there will be no harm in further enumerating how many\nand how great are the rewards which *612C* justice and the other virtues\nprocure to the soul from gods and men, both in life and after death.\nCertainly not, he said.\nWill you repay me, then, what you borrowed in the argument?\nWhat did I borrow?\nThe assumption that the just man should appear unjust and the unjust just:\nfor you were of opinion that even if the true state of the case could not\npossibly escape the eyes of gods and men, still this admission ought to be\nmade for the sake of the argument, in order that pure justice might be\n*612D* weighed against pure injustice. Do you remember?\nI should be much to blame if I had forgotten.\nThen, as the cause is decided, I demand on behalf of justice that the\nestimation in which she is held by gods and {329} men and which we\nacknowledge to be her due should now be restored to her by us[6]; since\nshe has been shown to confer reality, and not to deceive those who truly\npossess her, let what has been taken from her be given back, that so she\nmay win that palm of appearance which is hers also, and which she gives to\nher own.\n[Footnote 6: Reading [Greek: \u00ea(m\u00f4=n].]\n*612E* The demand, he said, is just.\nIn the first place, I said--and this is the first thing which you will\nhave to give back--the nature both of the just and unjust is truly known\nto the gods.\nGranted.\n[Sidenote: The just man is the friend of the gods, and all things work\ntogether for his good.]\nAnd if they are both known to them, one must be the friend and the other\nthe enemy of the gods, as we admitted from the beginning?\nTrue.\n*613A* And the friend of the gods may be supposed to receive from them all\nthings at their best, excepting only such evil as is the necessary\nconsequence of former sins?\nCertainly.\nThen this must be our notion of the just man, that even when he is in\npoverty or sickness, or any other seeming misfortune, all things will in\nthe end work together for good to him in life and death: for the gods have\na care of any one whose desire is to become just and to be like God, as\nfar as *613B* man can attain the divine likeness, by the pursuit of\nvirtue?\nYes, he said; if he is like God he will surely not be neglected by him.\n[Sidenote: The unjust is the opposite.]\nAnd of the unjust may not the opposite be supposed?\nCertainly.\nSuch, then, are the palms of victory which the gods give the just?\nThat is my conviction.\n[Sidenote: He may be compared to a runner who is only good at the start.]\nAnd what do they receive of men? Look at things as they really are, and\nyou will see that the clever unjust are in the case of runners, who run\nwell from the starting-place to the goal but not back again from the goal:\nthey go off at a great pace, *613C* but in the end only look foolish,\nslinking away with their ears draggling on their shoulders, and without a\ncrown; but the true runner comes to the finish and receives the {330}\nprize and is crowned. And this is the way with the just; he who endures to\nthe end of every action and occasion of his entire life has a good report\nand carries off the prize which men have to bestow.\nTrue.\n[Sidenote: [Sidenote: Recapitulation of things unfit for ears polite which\nhad been described by Glaucon in Book II.]]\nAnd now you must allow me to repeat of the just the blessings which you\nwere attributing to the fortunate unjust. *613D* I shall say of them, what\nyou were saying of the others, that as they grow older, they become rulers\nin their own city if they care to be; they marry whom they like and give\nin marriage to whom they will; all that you said of the others I now say\nof these. And, on the other hand, of the unjust I say that the greater\nnumber, even though they escape in their youth, are found out at last and\nlook foolish at the end of their course, and when they come to be old and\nmiserable are flouted alike by stranger and citizen; they are beaten and\n*613E* then come those things unfit for ears polite, as you truly term\nthem; they will be racked and have their eyes burned out, as you were\nsaying. And you may suppose that I have repeated the remainder of your\ntale of horrors. But will you let me assume, without reciting them, that\nthese things are true?\nCertainly, he said, what you say is true.\n*614A* These, then, are the prizes and rewards and gifts which are\nbestowed upon the just by gods and men in this present life, in addition\nto the other good things which justice of herself provides.\nYes, he said; and they are fair and lasting.\nAnd yet, I said, all these are as nothing either in number or greatness in\ncomparison with those other recompenses which await both just and unjust\nafter death. And you ought to hear them, and then both just and unjust\nwill have received from us a full payment of the debt which the argument\nowes to them.\n*614B* Speak, he said; there are few things which I would more gladly\nhear.\n[Sidenote: Socrates.]\n[Sidenote: The vision of Er.]\n[Sidenote: The judgement.]\n[Sidenote: The two openings in heaven and the two in earth through which\npassed those who were beginning and those who had completed their\npilgrimage.]\n[Sidenote: The meeting in the meadow.]\n[Sidenote: The punishment tenfold the sin.]\n[Sidenote: 'Unbaptized infants.']\n[Sidenote: Ardiaeus the tyrant.]\n[Sidenote: Incurable sinners.]\nWell, I said, I will tell you a tale; not one of the tales which Odysseus\ntells to the hero Alcinous, yet this too is a tale of a hero, Er the son\nof Armenius, a Pamphylian by birth. He was slain in battle, and ten days\nafterwards, when the bodies of the dead were taken up already in a state\nof corruption, his body was found unaffected by decay, and {331} carried\naway home to be buried. And on the twelfth day, as he was lying on the\nfuneral pile, he returned to life and told them what he had seen in the\nother world. He said that when his soul left the body he went on a journey\nwith a great company, *614C* and that they came to a mysterious place at\nwhich there were two openings in the earth; they were near together, and\nover against them were two other openings in the heaven above. In the\nintermediate space there were judges seated, who commanded the just, after\nthey had given judgment on them and had bound their sentences in front of\nthem, to ascend by the heavenly way on the right hand; and in like manner\nthe unjust were bidden by them to descend by the lower way on the left\nhand; these also bore the symbols of their deeds, but fastened on their\nbacks. He drew near, *614D* and they told him that he was to be the\nmessenger who would carry the report of the other world to men, and they\nbade him hear and see all that was to be heard and seen in that place.\nThen he beheld and saw on one side the souls departing at either opening\nof heaven and earth when sentence had been given on them; and at the two\nother openings other souls, some ascending out of the earth dusty and worn\nwith travel, some descending out of heaven clean and bright. And *614E*\narriving ever and anon they seemed to have come from a long journey, and\nthey went forth with gladness into the meadow, where they encamped as at a\nfestival; and those who knew one another embraced and conversed, the souls\nwhich came from earth curiously enquiring about the things above, and the\nsouls which came from heaven about the things beneath. And they told one\nanother of what had happened by the way, those from below weeping and\nsorrowing *615A* at the remembrance of the things which they had endured\nand seen in their journey beneath the earth (now the journey lasted a\nthousand years), while those from above were describing heavenly delights\nand visions of inconceivable beauty. The story, Glaucon, would take too\nlong to tell; but the sum was this:--He said that for every wrong which\nthey had done to any one they suffered tenfold; or once in a hundred\nyears--such being reckoned to be the length *615B* of man's life, and the\npenalty being thus paid ten times in a thousand years. If, for example,\nthere were any who had been {332} the cause of many deaths, or had\nbetrayed or enslaved cities or armies, or been guilty of any other evil\nbehaviour, for each and all of their offences they received punishment ten\ntimes over, and the rewards of beneficence and justice and *615C* holiness\nwere in the same proportion. I need hardly repeat what he said concerning\nyoung children dying almost as soon as they were born. Of piety and\nimpiety to gods and parents, and of murderers[7], there were retributions\nother and greater far which he described. He mentioned that he was present\nwhen one of the spirits asked another, 'Where is Ardiaeus the Great?' (Now\nthis Ardiaeus lived a thousand years before the time of Er: he had been\nthe tyrant of some city of Pamphylia, and had murdered his aged father and\nhis elder brother, *615D* and was said to have committed many other\nabominable crimes.) The answer of the other spirit was: 'He comes not\nhither and will never come. And this,' said he, 'was one of the dreadful\nsights which we ourselves witnessed. We were at the mouth of the cavern,\nand, having completed all our experiences, were about to reascend, when of\na sudden Ardiaeus appeared and several others, most of whom were tyrants;\nand there were also besides the tyrants private individuals *615E* who had\nbeen great criminals: they were just, as they fancied, about to return\ninto the upper world, but the mouth, instead of admitting them, gave a\nroar, whenever any of these incurable sinners or some one who had not been\nsufficiently punished tried to ascend; and then wild men of fiery aspect,\nwho were standing by and heard the sound, *616A* seized and carried them\noff; and Ardiaeus and others they bound head and foot and hand, and threw\nthem down and flayed them with scourges, and dragged them along the road\nat the side, carding them on thorns like wool, and declaring to the\npassers-by what were their crimes, and that[8] they were being taken away\nto be cast into hell.' And of all the many terrors which they had endured,\nhe said that there was none like the terror which each of them felt at\nthat moment, lest they should hear the voice; and when there was silence,\none by one they ascended with exceeding joy. These, said Er, were the\npenalties and retributions, and there were blessings as great. {333}\n[Footnote 7: Reading [Greek: au)to/cheiras].]\n[Footnote 8: Reading [Greek: kai\\ o(/ti].]\n[Sidenote: The whorls representing the spheres of the heavenly bodies.]\n*616B* Now when the spirits which were in the meadow had tarried seven\ndays, on the eighth they were obliged to proceed on their journey, and, on\nthe fourth day after, he said that they came to a place where they could\nsee from above a line of light, straight as a column, extending right\nthrough the whole heaven and through the earth, in colour resembling the\nrainbow, only brighter and purer; another day's journey brought them to\nthe place, and there, in the *616C* midst of the light, they saw the ends\nof the chains of heaven let down from above: for this light is the belt of\nheaven, and holds together the circle of the universe, like the\nunder-girders of a trireme. From these ends is extended the spindle of\nNecessity, on which all the revolutions turn. The shaft and hook of this\nspindle are made of steel, and the whorl is made partly of steel and also\npartly of other materials. *616D* Now the whorl is in form like the whorl\nused on earth; and the description of it implied that there is one large\nhollow whorl which is quite scooped out, and into this is fitted another\nlesser one, and another, and another, and four others, making eight in\nall, like vessels which fit into one another; the whorls show their edges\non the upper side, and on their *616E* lower side all together form one\ncontinuous whorl. This is pierced by the spindle, which is driven home\nthrough the centre of the eighth. The first and outermost whorl has the\nrim broadest, and the seven inner whorls are narrower, in the following\nproportions--the sixth is next to the first in size, the fourth next to\nthe sixth; then comes the eighth; the seventh is fifth, the fifth is\nsixth, the third is seventh, last and eighth comes the second. The largest\n[or fixed stars] is spangled, and the seventh [or sun] is brightest; the\neighth [or moon] *617A* coloured by the reflected light of the seventh;\nthe second and fifth [Saturn and Mercury] are in colour like one another,\nand yellower than the preceding; the third [Venus] has the whitest light;\nthe fourth [Mars] is reddish; the sixth [Jupiter] is in whiteness second.\nNow the whole spindle has the same motion; but, as the whole revolves in\none direction, the seven inner circles move slowly in the other, and of\nthese the swiftest is the eighth; next in swiftness are the *617B*\nseventh, sixth, and fifth, which move together; third in swiftness\nappeared to move according to the law of this {334} reversed motion the\nfourth; the third appeared fourth and the second fifth. The spindle turns\non the knees of Necessity; and on the upper surface of each circle is a\nsiren, who goes round with them, hymning a single tone or note. The eight\ntogether form one harmony; and round about, at equal intervals, *617C*\nthere is another band, three in number, each sitting upon her throne:\nthese are the Fates, daughters of Necessity, who are clothed in white\nrobes and have chaplets upon their heads, Lachesis and Clotho and Atropos,\nwho accompany with their voices the harmony of the sirens--Lachesis\nsinging of the past, Clotho of the present, Atropos of the future; Clotho\nfrom time to time assisting with a touch of her right hand the revolution\nof the outer circle of the whorl or spindle, and Atropos with her left\nhand touching and guiding the inner ones, and Lachesis laying *617D* hold\nof either in turn, first with one hand and then with the other.\n[Sidenote: The proclamation of the free choice.]\n[Sidenote: The complexity of circumstances,]\n[Sidenote: and their relation to the human soul.]\nWhen Er and the spirits arrived, their duty was to go at once to Lachesis;\nbut first of all there came a prophet who arranged them in order; then he\ntook from the knees of Lachesis lots and samples of lives, and having\nmounted a high pulpit, spoke as follows: 'Hear the word of Lachesis, the\ndaughter of Necessity. Mortal souls, behold a new cycle of life and\nmortality. Your genius will not be allotted to you, *617E* but you will\nchoose your genius; and let him who draws the first lot have the first\nchoice, and the life which he chooses shall be his destiny. Virtue is\nfree, and as a man honours or dishonours her he will have more or less of\nher; the responsibility is with the chooser--God is justified.' When the\nInterpreter had thus spoken he scattered lots indifferently among them\nall, and each of them took up the lot which fell near him, all but Er\nhimself (he was not allowed), and each as he took his lot perceived the\nnumber which he had obtained. *618A* Then the Interpreter placed on the\nground before them the samples of lives; and there were many more lives\nthan the souls present, and they were of all sorts. There were lives of\nevery animal and of man in every condition. And there were tyrannies among\nthem, some lasting out the tyrant's life, others which broke off in the\nmiddle and came to an end in poverty and exile and beggary; and there were\n{335} lives of famous men, some who were famous for their form and beauty\nas well as for their strength and success in games, *618B* or, again, for\ntheir birth and the qualities of their ancestors; and some who were the\nreverse of famous for the opposite qualities. And of women likewise; there\nwas not, however, any definite character in them, because the soul, when\nchoosing a new life, must of necessity become different. But there was\nevery other quality, and the all mingled with one another, and also with\nelements of wealth and poverty, and disease and health; and there were\nmean states also. And here, my dear Glaucon, is the supreme peril of our\nhuman state; and therefore the utmost care should be taken. *618C* Let\neach one of us leave every other kind of knowledge and seek and follow one\nthing only, if peradventure he may be able to learn and may find some one\nwho will make him able to learn and discern between good and evil, and so\nto choose always and everywhere the better life as he has opportunity. He\nshould consider the bearing of all these things which have been mentioned\nseverally and collectively upon virtue; he should know what the effect of\nbeauty is when combined with poverty or wealth in a *618D* particular\nsoul, and what are the good and evil consequences of noble and humble\nbirth, of private and public station, of strength and weakness, of\ncleverness and dullness, and of all the natural and acquired gifts of the\nsoul, and the operation of them when conjoined; he will then look at the\nnature of the soul, and from the consideration of all these qualities he\nwill be able to determine which is the better and which is the worse; and\nso he will choose, giving the name *618E* of evil to the life which will\nmake his soul more unjust, and good to the life which will make his soul\nmore just; all else he will disregard. For we have seen and know that this\nis *619A* the best choice both in life and after death. A man must take\nwith him into the world below an adamantine faith in truth and right, that\nthere too he may be undazzled by the desire of wealth or the other\nallurements of evil, lest, coming upon tyrannies and similar villainies,\nhe do irremediable wrongs to others and suffer yet worse himself; but let\nhim know how to choose the mean and avoid the extremes on either side, as\nfar as possible, not only in this life but {336} in all *619B* that which\nis to come. For this is the way of happiness.\n[Sidenote: Habit not enough without philosophy when circumstances change.]\n[Sidenote: The spectacle of the election.]\nAnd according to the report of the messenger from the other world this was\nwhat the prophet said at the time: 'Even for the last comer, if he chooses\nwisely and will live diligently, there is appointed a happy and not\nundesirable existence. Let not him who chooses first be careless, and let\nnot the last despair.' And when he had spoken, he who had the first choice\ncame forward and in a moment chose the greatest tyranny; his mind having\nbeen darkened by folly and sensuality, he had not thought out the whole\nmatter before he chose, and did not at first sight perceive that he *619C*\nwas fated, among other evils, to devour his own children. But when he had\ntime to reflect, and saw what was in the lot, he began to beat his breast\nand lament over his choice, forgetting the proclamation of the prophet;\nfor, instead of throwing the blame of his misfortune on himself, he\naccused chance and the gods, and everything rather than himself. Now he\nwas one of those who came from heaven, and in a former life had dwelt in a\nwell-ordered State, but his virtue *619D* was a matter of habit only, and\nhe had no philosophy. And it was true of others who were similarly\novertaken, that the greater number of them came from heaven and therefore\nthey had never been schooled by trial, whereas the pilgrims who came from\nearth having themselves suffered and seen others suffer, were not in a\nhurry to choose. And owing to this inexperience of theirs, and also\nbecause the lot was a chance, many of the souls exchanged a good destiny\nfor an evil or an evil for a good. For if a man had always on his arrival\nin this world dedicated himself from the first to sound philosophy, *619E*\nand had been moderately fortunate in the number of the lot, he might, as\nthe messenger reported, be happy here, and also his journey to another\nlife and return to this, instead of being rough and underground, would be\nsmooth and heavenly. Most curious, he said, was the spectacle--sad and\nlaughable and strange; for the choice of the souls *620A* was in most\ncases based on their experience of a previous life. There he saw the soul\nwhich had once been Orpheus choosing the life of a swan out of enmity to\nthe race of women, hating to be born of a woman because they had {337}\nbeen his murderers; he beheld also the soul of Thamyras choosing the life\nof a nightingale; birds, on the other hand, like the swan and other\nmusicians, wanting to be men. The *620B* soul which obtained the\ntwentieth[9] lot chose the life of a lion, and this was the soul of Ajax\nthe son of Telamon, who would not be a man, remembering the injustice\nwhich was done him in the judgment about the arms. The next was Agamemnon,\nwho took the life of an eagle, because, like Ajax, he hated human nature\nby reason of his sufferings. About the middle came the lot of Atalanta;\nshe, seeing the great fame of an athlete, was unable to resist the\ntemptation: and after her *620C* there followed the soul of Epeus the son\nof Panopeus passing into the nature of a woman cunning in the arts; and\nfar away among the last who chose, the soul of the jester Thersites was\nputting on the form of a monkey. There came also the soul of Odysseus\nhaving yet to make a choice, and his lot happened to be the last of them\nall. Now the recollection of former toils had disenchanted him of\nambition, and he went about for a considerable time in search of the life\nof a private man who had no cares; he had some difficulty in finding this,\nwhich was lying about and had been neglected by everybody else; *620D* and\nwhen he saw it, he said that he would have done the same had his lot been\nfirst instead of last, and that he was delighted to have it. And not only\ndid men pass into animals, but I must also mention that there were animals\ntame and wild who changed into one another and into corresponding human\nnatures--the good into the gentle and the evil into the savage, in all\nsorts of combinations.\n[Footnote 9: Reading [Greek: ei)kost\u00ea/n].]\nAll the souls had now chosen their lives, and they went in the order of\ntheir choice to Lachesis, who sent with them the genius whom they had\nseverally chosen, to be the guardian *620E* of their lives and the\nfulfiller of the choice: this genius led the souls first to Clotho, and\ndrew them within the revolution of the spindle impelled by her hand, thus\nratifying the destiny of each; and then, when they were fastened to this,\ncarried them to Atropos, who spun the threads and made *621A* them\nirreversible, whence without turning round they passed beneath the throne\nof Necessity; and when they had all passed, they marched on in a scorching\nheat to the plain of {338} Forgetfulness, which was a barren waste\ndestitute of trees and verdure; and then towards evening they encamped by\nthe river of Unmindfulness, whose water no vessel can hold; of this they\nwere all obliged to drink a certain quantity, and those who were not saved\nby wisdom drank more than was necessary; and each one as he drank forgot\nall things. *621B* Now after they had gone to rest, about the middle of\nthe night there was a thunderstorm and earthquake, and then in an instant\nthey were driven upwards in all manner of ways to their birth, like stars\nshooting. He himself was hindered from drinking the water. But in what\nmanner or by what means he returned to the body he could not say; only, in\nthe morning, awaking suddenly, he found himself lying on the pyre.\nAnd thus, Glaucon, the tale has been saved and has not perished, *621C*\nand will save us if we are obedient to the word spoken; and we shall pass\nsafely over the river of Forgetfulness and our soul will not be defiled.\nWherefore my counsel is, that we hold fast ever to the heavenly way and\nfollow after justice and virtue always, considering that the soul is\nimmortal and able to endure every sort of good and every sort of evil.\nThus shall we live dear to one another and to the gods, both while\nremaining here and when, like *621D* conquerors in the games who go round\nto gather gifts, we receive our reward. And it shall be well with us both\nin this life and in the pilgrimage of a thousand years which we have been\ndescribing.\nINDEX.\nA.\nABDERA, Protagoras of, 10. 600 C.\nAbortion, allowed in certain cases, 5. 461 C.\nAbsolute beauty, 5. 476, 479; 6. 494 A, 501 B, 507 B;--absolute good, 6.\n507 B; 7. 540 A;--absolute justice, 5. 479; 6. 501 B; 7. 517 E;--absolute\nswiftness and slowness, 7. 529 D;--absolute temperance, 6. 501 B;\n--absolute unity, 7. 524 E, 525 E;--the absolute and the many, 6. 507.\nAbstract ideas, origin of, 7. 523.

But it is probably\nnot essentially different from another abstraction, 'the true being of\nthings,' which is mentioned in many of his Dialogues_ [_cp. passages cited\ns. v. Being_]. _He has nowhere given an explanation of his meaning, not\nbecause he was 'regardless whether we understood him or not,' but rather,\nperhaps, because he was himself unable to state in precise terms the ideal\nwhich floated before his mind. He belonged to an age in which men felt too\nstrongly the first pleasure of metaphysical speculation to be able to\nestimate the true value of the ideas which they conceived_ (_cp. his own\npicture of the effect of dialectic on the youthful mind,_ 7. 539). _To\nhim, as to the Schoolmen of the Middle Ages, an abstraction seemed truer\nthan a fact: he was impatient to shake off the shackles of sense and rise\ninto the purer atmosphere of ideas. Yet in the allegory of the cave_\n(_Book VII_), _whose inhabitants must go up to the light of perfect\nknowledge but descend again into the obscurity of opinion, he has shown\nthat he was not unaware of the necessity of finding a firm starting-point\nfor these flights of metaphysical imagination_ (_cp._ 6. 510). _A passage\nin the Philebus_ (65 A) _gives perhaps the best insight into his meaning:\n'If we are not able to hunt the good with one idea only, with three we may\ntake our prey,--Beauty, Symmetry, Truth.'

[_The search for justice is the groundwork or foundation of the\nRepublic, which commences with an enquiry into its nature and ends with a\ntriumphant demonstration of the superior happiness enjoyed by the just\nman. In the First Book several definitions of justice are attempted, all\nof which prove inadequate. Glaucon and Adeimantus then intervene:--mankind\nregard justice as a necessity, not as a good in itself, or at best as only\nto be practised because of the temporal benefits which flow from it: can\nSocrates prove that it belongs to a higher class of goods? Socrates in\nreply proposes to construct an ideal state in which justice will be more\neasily recognised than in the individual. Justice is thus discovered to be\nthe essential virtue of the state,_ (_a thesis afterwards enlarged upon by\nAristotle_ [Pol. i. 2, \u00a7 16; iii. 13, \u00a7 3]), _the bond of the social\norganization, and, like temperance in the Laws_ [3. 696, 697; 4. 709 E],\n_rather the accompaniment or condition of the virtues than a virtue in\nitself_ [_cp._ Introduction, p. lxiii]. _Expressed in an outward or\npolitical form it becomes the great principle which has been already\nenunciated_ (i. 322), _'that every man shall do his own work;' on this\nPlato bases the necessity of the division into classes which underlies the\nwhole fabric of the ideal state_ (4. 433 foll.; Tim. 17 C). _Thus we are\nled to acknowledge the happiness of the just; for he alone reflects in\nhimself this vital principle of the state_ (4. 445). _The final proof is\nsupplied by a comparison of the perfect state with actual forms of\ngovernment. These, like the individuals who correspond to them, become\nmore and more miserable as they recede further from the ideal, and the\nclimax is reached_ (9. 587) _when the tyrant is shown by the aid of\narithmetic to have '729 times less pleasure than the king'_ [_i.e. the\nperfectly just ruler_]. _Lastly, the happiness of the just is proved to_\n{359} _extend also into the next world, where men appear before the\njudgment seat of heaven and receive the due reward of their deeds in this\nlife._]\nK.\nKing, the Great, 8. 553 D:--pleasure of the king and the tyrant compared,\n9. 587 foll.;--kings and philosophers, 5. 473 (cp. 6. 487 E, 498 foll.,\n501 E foll.; 7. 540; 8. 543; 9. 592).\nKisses, the reward of the brave warrior, 5. 468 C.\nKnowledge ([Greek: e)pist\u00ea/m\u00ea, gign\u00f4/skein]), = knowledge of ideas, 6. 484;\n--nature of, 5. 477, 478; classed among faculties, _ib._ 477; 6. 511 E;\n7. 533 E;--previous, to birth, 7. 518 C;--how far given by sense, _ib._\n529 [_cp._ Phaedo 75];--should not be acquired under compulsion, _ib._\n536 E;--the foundation of courage, 4. 429 [_cp._ Laches 193, 197; Protag.\n350, 360];--knowledge and opinion, 5. 476-478; 6. 508, 510 A; 7. 534;\nknowledge and pleasure, 6. 505; knowledge and wisdom, 4. 428;--the highest\nknowledge, 6. 504; 7. 514 foll.;--unity of knowledge, 5. 479 [_cp._ Phaedo\n101];--the best knowledge, 10. 618;--knowledge of shadows, 6. 511 D; 7.\n534 A:--love of knowledge characteristic of the Hellenes, 4. 435 E;\npeculiar to the rational element of the soul, 9. 581 B.\nL.\nLabour, division of, 2. 370, 374 A; 3. 394 E, 395 B, 397 E; 4. 423 E,\n433 A, 435 A, 441 E, 443, 453 B [_cp._ Laws 8. 846, 847].\nLacedaemon, owes its good order to Lycurgus, 10. 599 E;--constitution of,\ncommonly extolled, 8. 544 D; a timocracy, _ib._ 545 B:--Lacedaemonians\nfirst after the Cretans to strip in the gymnasia, 5. 452 D.\nLachesis, turns the spindle of Necessity together with Clotho and Atropos,\n10. 617 C; her speech, _ib._ D; apportions a genius to each soul, _ib._\n620 D.\nLamentation over the dead, to be checked, 3. 387.\nLands, partition of, proclaimed by the would-be tyrant, 8. 565 E, 566 E.\nLanguage, pliability of, 9. 588 D [_cp._ Soph. 277 B].\nLaughter not to be allowed in the guardians, 3. 388 [_cp._ Laws 5. 732;\n11. 935]; nor represented in the gods, _ib._ 389.\nLaws, may be given in error, 1. 339 E; supposed to arise from a convention\namong mankind, 2. 359 A; cause of, 3. 405; on special subjects of little\nuse, 4. 425, 426 [_cp._ Laws 7. 788]; treated with contempt in\ndemocracies, 8. 563 E; bring help to all in the state, 9. 590.\nLawyers, increase when wealth abounds, 4. 405 A.\nLearning, pleasure of, 6. 486 C (cp. 9. 581, 586).\nLegislation, cannot reach the minutiae of life, 4. 425, 426; requires the\nhelp of God, _ib._ 425 E.

[_Music to the ancients had a far wider significance than to us. It\nwas opposed to gymnastic as 'mental' to 'bodily' training, and included\nequally reading and writing, mathematics, harmony, poetry, and music\nstrictly speaking: drawing, as Aristotle tells us_ (Pol. viii. 3, \u00a7 1),\n_was sometimes made a separate division._ I. _Music_ (_in this wider\nsense_), _Plato says, should precede gymnastic; and, according to a\nremarkable passage in the Protagoras_ (325 C), _the pupils in a Greek\nschool were actually instructed in reading and writing, made to learn\npoetry by heart, and taught to play on the lyre, before they went to the\ngymnasium. The ages at which children should commence these various studies\nare not stated in the Republic; but in the VIIth Book of the Laws, where\nthe subject is treated more in detail, the children begin going to school\nat ten, and spend three years in learning to read and write, and another\nthree years in music_ (Laws 7. 810). _This agrees very fairly with the\nselection of the_ {363} _most promising youth at the age of twenty_ (Rep.\n7. 537), _as it would allow a corresponding period of three years for\ngymnastic training._ II. _Music, strictly so called, plays a great part in\nPlato's scheme of education. He hopes by its aid to make the lives of his\nyouthful scholars harmonious and gracious, and to implant in their souls\ntrue conceptions of good and evil. Music is a gift of the Gods to men, and\nwas never intended, 'as the many foolishly and blasphemously suppose,'\nmerely to give us an idle pleasure_ (Tim. 47 E; Laws 2. 654, 658 E; 7.\n802 D). _Neither should a freeman aim at attaining perfect execution_\n[_cp._ Arist. Pol. viii. 6, \u00a7\u00a7 7, 15]: _in the Laws_ (7. 810) _we are told\nthat every one must go through the three years course of music, 'neither\nmore nor less, whether he like or whether he dislike the study.' Both\ninstruments and music are to be of a simple character: in the Republic\nonly the lyre, the pipe, and the flute are tolerated, and the Dorian and\nPhrygian harmonies. No change in the fashions of music is permitted; for\nwhere there is licence in music there will be anarchy in the state. In\nthis desire for simplicity and fixity in music Plato was probably opposed\nto the tendencies of his own age. The severe harmony which had once\ncharacterized Hellenic art was passing out of favour: alike in\narchitecture, sculpture, painting, literature, and music, richer and more\nornate styles prevailed. We regard the change as inevitable, and not\nperhaps wholly to be regretted: to Plato it was a cause rather than a sign\nof the decline of Hellas._]\nMusical amateurs, 5. 475;--education, 2. 377; 3. 398 foll.; 7. 522 A;\n--instruments, the more complex kinds of, rejected, 3. 399 [_cp._ Laws\n7. 812 D];--modes, _ib._ 397-399; changes in, involve changes in the laws,\n4. 424 C.\nMysteries, 2. 365 A, 366 A, 378 A; 8. 560 E.\nMythology, misrepresentations of the gods in, 2. 378 foll.; 3. 388 foll.,\n408 C (cp.

[_The Republic is the first of Plato's works in which he seriously\nexamines the value of poetry in education, and the place of the poets in\nthe state. The question could hardly be neglected by the philosopher who\nproposed to construct an ideal polity or government of the best. For\npoetry played a great part in Hellenic life: the children learned whole\npoems by heart in their schools_ (Protag. 326 A; Laws 7. 810 C); _the\nrhapsode delighted the crowds at the festivals_ (Ion 535); _the theatres\nwere free, or almost free, to all, 'costing but a drachma at the most'_\n(Apol. 26 D); _the intervals of a banquet were filled up by conversation\nabout the poets_ (Protag. 347 C). _The quarrel between philosophy and\npoetry was an ancient one, which had found its first expression in the\nattacks of Xenophanes_ (538 B.C.) _and Heracleitus_ (508 B.C.) _upon the\npopular mythology. In the earlier dialogues of Plato the poets are treated\nwith an ironical courtesy, through which an antagonistic spirit is allowed\nhere and there to appear: they are 'winged and holy beings'_ (Ion 534)\n_who sing by inspiration,_ {367} _but at the same time are the worst\npossible critics of their own writings and the most self-conceited of\nmortals_ (Apol. 22 D). _In the Republic_ (_II and III_), _Plato begins the\ntrial of poetry by the enquiry whether the tales and legends related by\nthe epic and tragic poets are true in themselves or likely to furnish good\nexamples to his future citizens. They cannot be true, for they are\ncontrary to the nature of God_ (_see s. v._ God), _and they are certainly\nnot proper lessons for youth. There must be a censorship of poetry, and\nall objectionable passages expunged; suitable rules and regulations will\nbe laid down, and to these the poets must conform. In the Xth Book the\nargument takes a deeper tone. The Poet is proved to be an impostor thrice\nremoved from the truth, a wizard who steals the hearts of the unwary by\nhis spells and enchantments. Men easily fall into the habit of imitating\nwhat they admire; and the lamentations and woes of the tragic hero and the\nunseemly buffoonery of the comedian are equally bad models for the\ncitizens of a free and noble state. The poets must therefore be banished,\nunless, Plato adds, the lovers of poetry can persuade us of her innocence\nof the charges laid against her. In the Laws a similar conclusion is\nreached:--'The state is an imitation of the best life, and the noblest\nform of tragedy. The legislator and the poet are rivals, and the latter\ncan only be tolerated if his words are in harmony with the laws of the\nstate'_ (vii. 817)].\nPoets, the, love their poems as their own creation, 1. 330 C [_cp._ Symp.\n209]; speak in parables, _ib._ 332 B (cp. 3. 413 B); on justice, 2. 363,\n364, 365 E; bad teachers of youth, _ib._ 377; 3. 391, 392, 408 C [_cp._\nLaws 10. 866 C, 890 A]; must be restrained by certain rules, 2. 379 foll.;\n3. 398 A [_cp._ Laws 2. 656, 660 A; 4. 719]; banished from the state, 3.\n398 A; 8. 568 B; 10. 595 foll., 605 A, 607 A [_cp._ Laws 7. 817]; poets\nand tyrants, 8. 568; thrice removed from the truth, 10. 596, 597, 598 E,\n602 B, 605 C; imitators only, _ib._ 600, 601 (cp. 3. 393, _and_ Laws 4.\n719 C); poets and painters, 10. 601, 603, 605;--'the poets who were\nchildren and prophets of the gods' (?

These\nseverally correspond to the four divisions of knowledge_ (6. 511 E), _two\nfor intellect and two for opinion; and thus arises the Platonic\n'proportion,'_--_being_ : _becoming_ :: _intellect_ : _opinion, and\nscience_ : _belief_ {372} :: _understanding_ : _knowledge of shadows.\nThese divisions are partly real, partly formed by a logical process,\nwhich, as in so many distinctions of ancient philosophers, has outrun\nfact, and are further illustrated and explained by the allegory of the\ncave in Book VII_ (_see_ Introduction, p. xciv).--_The pre-existence and\nthe immortality of the soul are assumed. The doctrine of [Greek:\na)na/mn\u00easis] or 'remembrance of a previous birth' is not so much dwelt\nupon as in the Meno, Phaedo, or Phaedrus, neither is it made a proof of\nimmortality_ (Meno 86; Phaedo 73). _It is apparently alluded to in the\nstory of Er, where we are told that 'the pilgrims drank the waters of\nUnmindfulness; the foolish took too deep a draught, but the wise were more\nmoderate'_ (10. 621 A). _In the Xth Book Glaucon is supposed to receive\nwith amazement Socrates' confident assertion of immortality, although a\nprevious allusion to another state of existence has passed unheeded_ (6.\n498 D); _and in earlier parts of the discussion_ (_e.g._ 2. 362; 3. 386),\n_the censure which is passed on the common representations of Hades\nimplies in itself some belief in a future life_ [_cp._ Introduction to\nPhaedo, Vol. I]. _The argument for the immortality of the soul is not\ndrawn out at great length or with the emphasis of the Phaedo. It is\nchiefly of a verbal character:--All things which perish are destroyed by\nsome inherent evil; but the soul is not destroyed by sin, which is the\nevil proper to her, and must therefore be immortal_ (_cp._ Introd. p.\nclxvi).--_The condition of the soul after death is represented by Plato in\nhis favourite form of a myth_ [_cp._ Meno 81; Phaedo 88; Gorg. 522]. _The\nPamphylian warrior Er, who is supposed to have died in battle, revives\nwhen placed on the funeral pyre and relates his experiences in the other\nworld. He tells how the just are rewarded and the wicked punished, and is\nprivileged to describe the spectacle which he had witnessed of the choice\nof a new life by the pilgrim souls. The reward of release from bodily\nexistence is not held out to the philosopher_ (Phaedo 114 C), _but his\nwisdom, which has a deeper root than habit_ (10. 619), _preserves him from\noverhaste in his choice and ensures him a happy destiny.--The\ntransmigration of souls is represented in the myth much as in the Phaedrus\nand Timaeus. Plato in all likelihood derived the doctrine from an Oriental\nsource, but through Pythagorean channels. It probably had a real hold on\nhis mind, as it agreed, or could be made to agree, with the conviction,\nwhich he elsewhere expresses, of the remedial nature of punishment_ [_cp._\nProtag. 323; Gorg. 523-525].\nSounds in music, 7. 531 A.\nSparta. _See_ Lacedaemon.\nSpectator, the, unconsciously influenced by what he sees and hears, 10.\n605, 606 [_cp._ Laws 2. 656 A, 659 C];--the philosopher the spectator of\nall time and all existence, 6. 486 A [_cp._ Theaet. 173 E].\nSpendthrifts, in Greek states, 8. 564.\nSpercheius, the river-god, 3. 391 B.\nSpirit, must be combined with gentleness in the guardians, 2. 375; 3. 410;\n6. 503 [_cp._ Laws 5. 731 B]; characteristic of northern nations, 4. 435\nE; found in quite young children, _ib._ 441 A [_cp._ Laws; 12. {373}\n963]:--the spirited (or passionate) element in the soul, _ib._ 440 foll.;\n6. 504 A; 8. 550 A; 9. 572 A, 580 E; must be subject to the rational part,\n4. 441 E [_cp._ Tim. 30 C, 70, 89 D]; predominant in the timocratic state\nand man, 8. 548, 550 B; characterised by ambition, 9. 581 B; its\npleasures, _ib._ 586 D; the favourite object of the poet's imitation, 10.\n604, 605.\nStars, motion of the, 7. 529, 530; 10. 616 E.\nState, relation of, to the individual, 2. 368; 4. 434, 441; 5. 462; 8.\n544; 9. 577 B [_cp._ Laws 3. 689; 5. 739; 9. 875, 877 C; 11. 923]; origin\nof, 2. 369 foll.

[_The polity of which Plato 'sketches the outline' in the Republic\nmay be analysed into two principal elements,_ I, _an Hellenic state of the\nolder or Spartan type, with some traits borrowed from Athens,_ II, _an\nideal city in which the citizens have all things in common, and the\ngovernment is carried on by a class of philosopher rulers who are selected\nby merit. These two elements are not perfectly combined; and, as Aristotle\ncomplains_ (Pol. ii. 5, \u00a7 18), _very much is left ill-defined and\nuncertain._--I. _Like Hellenic cities in general, the number of the\ncitizens is not to be great. The size of the state is limited by the\nrequirement that 'it shall not be larger or smaller than is consistent\nwith unity.'_ [_The 'convenient number' 5040, which is_ {374} _suggested\nin the Laws_ (v. 737), _is regarded by Aristotle_ (Pol. ii. 6, \u00a7 6) _as an\n'enormous multitude.'_] _Again, the individual is subordinate to the\nstate. When Adeimantus complains of the hard life which the citizens will\nlead, 'like mercenaries in a garrison'_ (4. 419), _he is answered by\nSocrates that if the happiness of the whole is secured, the happiness of\nthe parts will inevitably follow. Once more, war is supposed to be the\nnormal condition of the state, and military service is imposed upon all.\nThe profession of arms is the only one in which the citizen may properly\nengage. Trade is regarded as dishonourable:--'those who are good for\nnothing else sit in the Agora buying and selling'_ (2. 371 D); _the\nwarrior can spare no time for such an employment_ (_ib._ 374 C). [_In the\nLaws Plato's ideas enlarge; he thinks that peace is to be preferred to\nwar_ (1. 628); _and he speculates on the possibility of redeeming trade\nfrom reproach by compelling some of the best citizens to open a shop or\nkeep a tavern_ (11. 918).]--_In these respects, as well as in the\nintroduction of common meals, Plato was probably influenced by the\ntraditional ideal of Sparta_ [_cp._ Introd. p. clxx]. _The Athenian\nelement appears in the intellectual training of the citizens, and\ngenerally in the atmosphere of grace and refinement which they are to\nbreathe_ (_see s. v._ Art). _The restless energy of the Athenian character\nis perhaps reflected in the discipline imposed upon the ruling class_\n(7. 540), _who when they have reached fifty are dispensed from continuous\npublic service, but must then devote themselves to abstract study, and\nalso be willing to take their turn when necessary at the helm of state_\n[_cp._ Laws 7. 807; Thucyd. i. 70; ii. 40].--II. _The most peculiar\nfeatures of Plato's state are_ (1) _the community of property,_ (2) _the\nposition of women,_ (3) _the government of philosophers._ (1) _The first_\n(_see s. v._), _though suggested in some measure by the example of Sparta\nor Crete_ [_cp._ Arist. Pol. ii. 5, \u00a7 6], _is not known to have been\nactually practised anywhere in Hellas, unless possibly among such a body\nas the Pythagorean brotherhood._ (2) _Nothing in all the Republic was\nprobably stranger to his contemporaries than the place which Plato assigns\nto women in the state. The community of wives and children, though\ncarefully guarded by him from the charge of licentiousness_ (5. 458 E),\n_would appear worse in Athenian eyes than the traditional 'licence' of the\nSpartan women_ [Arist. Pol. ii. 9, \u00a7 5), _which, so far as it really\nexisted, no doubt arose out of an excessive regard to physical\nconsiderations in marriage. Again, the equal share in education, in war,\nand in administration which the women are supposed to enjoy in Plato's\nstate, was, if not so revolting, quite as contrary to common Hellenic\nsentiment_ [_cp._ Thucyd. ii. 45]. _The Spartan women exercised a great\ninfluence on public affairs, but this was mainly indirect_ [_cp._ Laws 7.\n806; Arist. Pol. ii. 9, \u00a7 8]; _they did not hold office or learn the use\nof arms. At Athens, as is well known, the women, of the upper classes at\nleast, lived in an almost Oriental seclusion, and were wholly absorbed in\nhousehold duties_ (Laws 7. 805 E). (3) _Finally, the government of\nphilosophers had no analogy in the Hellenic world of_ {375} _Plato's time.\nHe may have taken the suggestion from the stories of the Pythagorean rule\nin Magna Graecia. But it is also possible that these accounts of the\nbrotherhood of Pythagoras, some of which have reached us on very doubtful\nauthority, may be themselves to a considerable extent coloured and\ndistorted by features adapted from the Republic. Whether this is the case\nor not, we can hardly doubt that Plato was chiefly indebted to his own\nimagination for his kingdom of philosophers, or that it remained to\nhimself an ideal, rather than a state which would ever 'play her part in\nactual life'_ (Tim. 19, 20). _It is at least significant that he never\nfinished the Critias, as though he were unable to embody, even in a\nmythical form, the 'city of which the pattern is laid up in heaven.'_]\nStatesmen in their own imagination, 4. 426.\nStatues, polished for a decision, 2. 361 D; painted, 4. 420 D.\nSteadiness of character, apt to be accompanied by stupidity, 6. 503 [_cp._\nTheaet. 144 B].\nStesichorus, says that Helen was never at Troy, 9. 586 C.\nStories, improper, not to be told to children, 2. 377; 3. 391.
