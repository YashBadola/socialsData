Preface
Not only in the world of commerce but also in the world of ideas our age is putting on a real clearance sale. Everything can be had so dirt cheap that one begins to wonder whether in the end anyone will want to make a bid.

Prelude
Once upon a time there was a man who as a child had heard the beautiful story about how God tempted Abraham, and how he withstood the temptation, kept the faith, and a second time received again a son contrary to expectation. When the man became older, he read the same story with even greater admiration, for life had separated what had been united in the pious simplicity of the child. The older he became, the more frequently his thoughts turned to that story, his enthusiasm became greater and greater, and yet he was less and less able to understand the story.

Problem I: Is there such a thing as a teleological suspension of the ethical?
The ethical as such is the universal, and as the universal it applies to everyone, which may be expressed from another point of view by saying that it applies every instant. It rests immanent in itself, has nothing without itself which is its telos, but is itself telos for everything outside it, and when this has been incorporated by it it can go no further. Conceived immediately as physical and psychical, the particular individual is the individual who has his telos in the universal, and his ethical task is to express himself constantly in it, to abolish his particularity in order to become the universal. As soon as the individual would assert himself as the particular over against the universal, he sins, and only by recognizing this can he again reconcile himself with the universal.

But faith is precisely this paradox, that the individual as the particular is higher than the universal, is justified over against it, is not subordinate but superior—yet in such a way, be it observed, that it is the particular individual who, after he has been subordinated as the particular to the universal, now through the universal becomes the individual who as the particular is superior to the universal, for the fact that the individual as the particular stands in an absolute relation to the absolute. This position cannot be mediated, for all mediation comes about precisely by virtue of the universal; it is and remains to all eternity a paradox, inaccessible to thought.

If this is not the case, then Abraham is lost, then faith has never existed in the world precisely because it has always existed. For if the ethical (i.e., the moral) is the highest thing, and if nothing incommensurable remains in man in any other way but as the evil (i.e., the particular which has to be expressed in the universal), then one needs no other categories than those which the Greek philosophy possessed or which can be deduced from them by the most consistent thinking. But Abraham is the father of faith, and it is he who suspended the ethical to obey the divine command to sacrifice Isaac. This suspension is not a sin, but a higher duty, a duty to God. This creates the "teleological suspension of the ethical," where the telos (end/goal) is outside the ethical itself.

The Knight of Faith
The knight of faith is the only happy man, the heir to the finite, while the knight of resignation is a stranger and a sojourner. The knight of resignation renounces the finite for the infinite, finding peace in the pain of loss. But the knight of faith makes the double movement: he resigns the finite infinitely, and then, by virtue of the absurd, grasps the finite again. He believes that he will receive it back, just as Abraham believed he would receive Isaac back. This requires a passion that transcends reason.
