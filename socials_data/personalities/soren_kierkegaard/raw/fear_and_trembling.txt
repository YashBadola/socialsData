Preface

Not only in the world of commerce but also in the world of ideas our age is organizing a regular clearance sale. Everything is to be had at such a bargain that it is questionable whether in the end there is anybody who will want to bid. Every speculative price-fixer who conscientiously directs attention to the significant march of modern philosophy, every Assistant Professor, tutor, and student, every crofter and cottar in philosophy, is not content with doubting everything but goes further. Perhaps it would be premature and untimely to ask them where they are going, but it is surely polite to assume that they have doubted everything, for otherwise it would be queer of them to be going further. This motion of going further I have performed myself in my own time—not indeed to the extent of doubting everything, for that I was not capable of, but at least to the extent of convincing myself that there was nothing I could not doubt.

The Knight of Faith

The knight of faith is the only happy man, the heir apparent to the finite, whereas the knight of resignation is a stranger and a sojourner. But the knight of faith knows it is glorious to belong to the infinite. He knows the pain of renouncing his dearest desire, he has tasted the bitterness of the cup, but he knows too that it tastes sweet to him who has faith. He has resigned everything infinitely, and then he grasps everything again by virtue of the absurd. He is no genius, for the genius can do everything except one thing—he cannot by virtue of the absurd get the finite back again. But the knight of faith can.

Faith is precisely this paradox, that the single individual is higher than the universal, that is, that the single individual determines his relation to the universal by his relation to the absolute, not his relation to the absolute by his relation to the universal. The paradox may also be expressed in this way: that there is an absolute duty toward God; for in this relationship of duty the individual as an individual stands related absolutely to the absolute.
