{"text": "The Sickness Unto Death is Despair.\nThe human being is spirit. But what is spirit? Spirit is the self. But what is the self? The self is a relation that relates itself to itself or is the relation's relating itself to itself in the relation; the self is not the relation but is the relation's relating itself to itself. A human being is a synthesis of the infinite and the finite, of the temporal and the eternal, of freedom and necessity, in short, a synthesis. A synthesis is a relation between two. Considered in this way, a human being is still not a self.\nIn the relation between two, the relation is the third as a negative unity, and the two relate to the relation and in the relation to the relation; thus under the qualification of the psychical the relation between the psychical and the physical is a relation. If, however, the relation relates itself to itself, this relation is the positive third, and this is the self.\nDespair is the sickness unto death.\nThe concept of the sickness unto death must be understood in a specific sense. Literally it means a sickness the end and outcome of which is death. Thus one speaks of a mortal sickness as a sickness unto death. But in the Christian sense death is by no means the last of all, so that it is only a minor event within that which is all, an eternal life; and, as has been said, there is infinitely much more hope in death than in life \u2013 not only that, but in the Christian sense death is the transition to life.\nConsequently, the sickness unto death is not, strictly speaking, a sickness that ends with death and then is no more. On the contrary, the torment of despair is precisely this: not to be able to die. So it has much in common with the situation of the dying man who lies and struggles with death, and cannot die. So to be sick unto death is, not to be able to die \u2013 yet not as though there were hope of life; no, the hopelessness is that there is not even the ultimate hope, death. When death is the greatest danger, one hopes for life; but when one learns to know the even greater danger, one hopes for death. When the danger is so great that death has become one's hope, despair is the hopelessness of not being able to die.\nThe Despair That Is Unconscious That It Is Despair.\nThis is the most common form of despair. It is not that the person is in despair, but that he does not know that he is in despair. He lives in the cellar of his own existence. He is a philistine. The philistine has no spirit, no infinite passion. He is tranquilized by the trivial. He thinks he is happy, but he is in despair.\nThe Despair That Is Conscious That It Is Despair.\n1. In despair at not willing to be oneself, the despair of weakness.\n2. In despair at willing to be oneself, defiance.\nThe formula that describes the state of the self when despair is completely rooted out is this: in relating itself to itself and in willing to be itself, the self rests transparently in the power that established it. This is faith.", "source": "sickness_unto_death_excerpt.txt"}
{"text": "Preface\nIt may perhaps occur to you, dear reader, that I have been somewhat too discursive in the Introduction. I admit it. But I ask you to remember that it is an introduction to a work which is rather voluminous, and that the subject matter is of such a nature that it is not easily exhausted.\nEither/Or: A Fragment of Life.\nI. DIAPSALMATA\nWhat is a poet? An unhappy man who in his heart harbors a deep anguish, but whose lips are so fashioned that the sighs and cries which pass over them are transformed into ravishing music. His fate is like that of the unfortunate victims whom the tyrant Phalaris imprisoned in a brazen bull, and slowly tortured over a steady fire; their cries could not reach the tyrant's ears so as to strike terror into his heart; when they reached his ears they sounded like sweet music.\nI do not care for anything. I do not care to ride, for the exercise is too violent. I do not care to walk, for it is too strenuous. I do not care to lie down, for I should either have to remain lying, and I do not care to do that, or I should have to get up again, and I do not care to do that either. Summa Summarum: I do not care at all.\nLet others complain that the age is wicked; my complaint is that it is paltry; for it lacks passion. Men's thoughts are thin and flimsy like lace, they are themselves pitiable like the lacemakers. The thoughts of their hearts are too paltry to be sinful. For a worm it might be regarded as a sin to harbor such thoughts, but not for a man who is formed in the image of God. Their lusts are dull and sluggish, their passions sleepy. They do their duty, these shopkeeper souls, but they permit themselves, like the Jews, to clip the coin a little...\nII. THE IMMEDIATE STAGES OF THE EROTIC OR THE MUSICAL EROTIC\nThe genius of Mozart.\nThe immediate stages.\nFirst Stage: The page in Figaro.\nSecond Stage: Papageno in The Magic Flute.\nThird Stage: Don Juan.\nDon Juan is the incarnation of the flesh, or the inspiration of the flesh by the spirit of the flesh.\nIII. THE ROTATION OF CROPS\nPeople with experience maintain that proceeding from a basic principle is the supposed starting point for all consistent thinking. I have heard and read that this is so, but I have not yet been able to find such a basic principle.\n...\nBoredom is the root of all evil. It is very curious that boredom, which itself has such a calm and sedate nature, can have such a capacity to initiate motion. The effect of boredom is usually abbreviated to this: that one gets bored.\n...\nThe method I propose does not consist in changing the soil but, like proper crop rotation, consists in changing the method of cultivation and the kinds of crops. Here at once we have the principle of limitation, the only saving principle in the world. The more you limit yourself, the more fertile you become in invention. A prisoner in solitary confinement for life becomes very inventive; a spider may furnish him with much entertainment.\nIV. THE SEDUCER'S DIARY\nApril 4.\nOne must be very careful not to get stuck in the role of the seducer. One must always have an exit strategy. The true aesthetic enjoyment lies not in the possession but in the planning, the orchestration of the mood. Cordelia... she is the one. I will arrange it so that she believes she is seducing me.

{"text": "Preface\nNot only in the world of commerce but also in the world of ideas our age is organizing a regular clearance sale. Everything is to be had at such a bargain that it is questionable whether in the end there is anybody who will want to bid. Every speculative price-fixer who conscientiously directs the trend of the market for a significant stage of the transition from period to period is well aware that the time has passed when one could ask the high price which was once the order of the day.\nFaith is precisely this paradox, that the single individual is higher than the universal. It is the paradox that the single individual as the single individual stands in an absolute relation to the Absolute. This position cannot be mediated, for all mediation comes about precisely by virtue of the universal; it is and remains to all eternity a paradox, inaccessible to thought. And yet faith is this paradox\u2014or else (one must not be ashamed of the consequences) faith has never existed but has always been a category of the aesthetic, or else Abraham is lost, or else it is necessary to interpret the story in a way which makes it unrecognizable.\nProblem I: Is there such a thing as a teleological suspension of the ethical?\nThe ethical as such is the universal, it applies to everyone, and the same thing is expressed from another point of view by saying that it applies every instant. It reposes immanently in itself, it has nothing without itself which is its telos, but is itself telos for everything outside it, and when this has been incorporated by the ethical it can go no further. Conceived immediately as physical and psychical, the particular individual is the particular which has its telos in the universal, and its duty is to express the universal constantly, to abolish its particularity in order to become the universal. As soon as the single individual asserts himself in his singularity before the universal, he sins, and only by acknowledging this can he be reconciled again with the universal.\nBut if the ethical is the highest thing, and if nothing that remains incommensurable with it can be vindicated (for the incommensurable is the evil, the jagged edges of existence which the ethical must smooth down), then one needs no other categories than the Greek ones (such as the tragic hero). But if the single individual is higher than the universal, then the ethical is reduced to a position of relativity.\nThe story of Abraham contains a teleological suspension of the ethical. There is no higher expression for the ethical in Abraham's life than that the father shall love the son. The ethical sense of the story is simply that Abraham was willing to murder Isaac; the religious sense is that he was willing to sacrifice him. In this contradiction lies the very anguish that can indeed make one sleepless, and yet without this anguish Abraham is not who he is.\nInfinite resignation is the last stage prior to faith, so that one who has not made this movement has not faith; for only in the infinite resignation do I become clear to myself with respect to my eternal validity, and only then can there be question of grasping existence by virtue of faith.\nBy my own strength I am able to give up everything, and then I find peace and repose in pain and trust in the eternal. But by my own strength I am not able to get the least of the things that belong to finitude, for I am constantly using my strength to renounce everything. By my own strength I can give up the princess... but by my own strength I cannot get her back again, for I am employing all my strength to be resigned. But by faith, says Abraham, I did not renounce Isaac, but by faith I got Isaac.\nThere was one who was great by reason of his power, and one who was great by reason of his wisdom, and one who was great by reason of his hope, and one who was great by reason of his love; but Abraham was greater than all, great by reason of his power whose strength is impotence, great by reason of his wisdom whose secret is foolishness, great by reason of his hope whose form is madness, great by reason of his love which is hatred of oneself.", "source": "fear_and_trembling_excerpt.txt"}
