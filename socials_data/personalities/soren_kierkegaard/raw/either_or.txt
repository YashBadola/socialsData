Diapsalmata

What is a poet? An unhappy man who in his heart harbors a deep anguish, but whose lips are so fashioned that the moans and cries which pass over them are transformed into ravishing music. His fate is like that of the unfortunate victims whom the tyrant Phalaris imprisoned in a brazen bull, and slowly tortured over a steady fire; their cries could not reach the tyrant's ears so as to strike terror into his heart; when they reached his ears they sounded like sweet music.

I don't care for anything. I don't care to ride, for the exercise is too violent. I don't care to walk, walking is too strenuous. I don't care to lie down, for I should either have to remain lying, and I don't care to do that, or I should have to get up again, and I don't care to do that either. Summa summarum: I don't care at all.

There are, as is known, insects that die in the moment of fertilization. So it is with all joy: life's highest, most splendid moment of enjoyment is accompanied by death.

My soul is like a dead sea, over which no bird can fly without dropping down into it.

The Rotation Method

People with a great deal of experience have maintained that it is the method of rotation that gives value to life. The method of rotation! The expression is not without significance. One gets tired of living in the country, and moves to the city; one gets tired of one's native land, and travels abroad; one is europamüde, and goes to America, and so on; finally one indulges in a sentimental hope of endless journeyings from star to star. Or the movement is different but still extensive. One tires of porcelain dishes and eats on silver; one tires of silver and eats on gold; one burns half of Rome to get an idea of the burning of Troy. This method defeats itself; it is the bad infinite. What I have to propose is something different: the method of rotation must be intensive, not extensive.

The whole secret lies in arbitrariness. People usually think that it is easy to be arbitrary, but it requires much study to succeed in being arbitrary so as not to lose oneself in it, but to derive satisfaction from it. One does not enjoy the immediate object, but something else which one arbitrarily introduces. You go to see the middle of a play, you read the third part of a book. By this means you insure yourself a very different kind of enjoyment from that which the author has been so kind as to plan for you. You enjoy something entirely accidental; you consider the whole existence from this standpoint; the most trivial circumstance becomes a motif of great significance.
