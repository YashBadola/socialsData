{"text": "When Alexander the Great addressed him with greetings, and asked if he wanted anything, Diogenes replied \"Yes, stand a little out of my sun.\"\nWhen someone asked him what sort of man he considered Diogenes to be, Alexander replied, \"If I were not Alexander, I would be Diogenes.\"\nDiogenes was kneeing by a stream, washing some vegetables. Plato came by and said, \"If you had courted Dionysius, you wouldn't be washing vegetables.\" Diogenes replied, \"And if you had washed vegetables, you wouldn't be courting Dionysius.\"\nPlato had defined Man as an animal, biped and featherless, and was applauded. Diogenes plucked a fowl and brought it into the lecture-room with the words, \"Here is Plato's man.\"\nHe used to stroll about in full daylight with a lamp; when asked what he was doing, he would answer, \"I am just looking for a man.\"\nAsked where he came from, he said, \"I am a citizen of the world.\"\nWhen someone was reading a long work and just a little unwritten space was visible at the end of the roll, Diogenes cried, \"Cheer up, men; I see land.\"\nHe once saw a child drinking out of his hands, and threw away the cup from his wallet with the words, \"A child has beaten me in plainness of living.\"\nTo one who asked what was the proper time for lunch, he said, \"If a rich man, when you will; if a poor man, when you can.\"\nBeing asked what he had gained from philosophy, he replied, \"This at least, if nothing else -- to be prepared for every fortune.\"\nWhen someone reproached him with his exile, his reply was, \"Nay, it was through that, you miserable fellow, that I came to be a philosopher.\"\nHe often said that there were two kinds of training, mental and bodily: the one being incomplete without the other.\nHe claimed that to fortune he could oppose courage, to convention nature, to passion reason.", "source": "sayings_and_anecdotes.txt"}
