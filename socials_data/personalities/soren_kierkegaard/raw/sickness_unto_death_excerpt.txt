Title: The Sickness Unto Death
Author: Søren Kierkegaard (Anti-Climacus)

Excerpt:

The self is a relation that relates itself to itself or is the relation's relating itself to itself in the relation; the self is not the relation but that the relation relates itself to itself. A human being is a synthesis of the infinite and the finite, of the temporal and the eternal, of freedom and necessity, in short, a synthesis. A synthesis is a relation between two. Considered in this way, a human being is still not a self.

In the relation between two, the relation is the third as a negative unity, and the two relate to the relation and in the relation to the relation; thus under the qualification of the psychical the relation between the psychical and the physical is a relation. If, however, the relation relates itself to itself, this relation is the positive third, and this is the self.

Despair is the sickness unto death. The concept of the sickness unto death must be understood in a peculiar sense. Literally it means a sickness the end and outcome of which is death. Thus one speaks of a mortal sickness as synonymous with a sickness unto death. In this sense despair cannot be called the sickness unto death. But in the Christian understanding death is itself a transition unto life. In this way, there is no sickness unto death in the Christian sense.

But despair is the sickness unto death precisely because it is being unable to die. It is to be sick unto death, to be dying, and yet not to be able to die. It is the state of the dying man who lies and struggles with death, and cannot die. So it is with despair. The torment of despair is precisely this, not to be able to die. So it has much in common with the situation of the agonizingly dying man, but with this difference, that here the dying is constantly transformed into a living. The despairing man cannot die; no more than "the dagger can slay thoughts" can consumption of the eternal part of the self die. The despairing man is sick unto death, but he cannot die.
