{"text": "Diapsalmata\nWhat is a poet? An unhappy man who in his heart harbors a deep anguish, but whose lips are so fashioned that the moans and cries which pass over them are transformed into ravishing music.\nI do not care for anything. I do not care to ride, for the exercise is too violent. I do not care to walk, for it is too strenuous. I do not care to lie down, for I should remain there, and I do not care to do that.\nMy sorrow is my castle. As the eagle builds his nest on the mountain peaks, so I build my castle in the clouds of the mind.\nLet others complain that the age is wicked; my complaint is that it is paltry; for it lacks passion. Men's thoughts are thin and flimsy like lace, they are themselves pitiable like the lacemakers. The thoughts of their hearts are too paltry to be sinful. For a worm it might be regarded as a sin to harbor such thoughts, but not for a man who is formed in the image of God. Their lusts are dull and sluggish, their passions sleepy. They do their duty, these shopkeeping souls, but they clip the coin a little...\n...\nThe Rotation of Crops\nPeople with experience maintain that proceeding from a basic principle is the supposed method of all science. I listen to them, and I am amazed at the problem. It is indeed true; I have no basic principle; I cannot have one, for if I did, I would have to regret it. The starting point of my whole philosophy is the feeling of boredom. Boredom is the root of all evil. It is very curious that boredom, which itself has such a calm and sedate nature, can have such a capacity to initiate motion. The effect that boredom has is absolutely magical, but this effect is one not of attraction but of repulsion.", "source": "either_or_excerpts.txt"}
{"text": "Preface\nNot only in the world of commerce but also in the world of ideas our age is putting on a real clearance sale. Everything is to be had at such a bargain that it is questionable whether in the end there is anybody who will want to buy. Every speculative waiter-philosopher has his hands full; he does not even find time to write the address, but simply hands the letter to the genius of the age\u2014simultaneously with the thought.\n...\nThe Story of Abraham\nThere was once a man who, already in his childhood, had heard the beautiful story of how God tempted Abraham, and how he withstood the temptation, kept the faith, and a second time received a son against every expectation. When the man grew older, he read the same story with even greater admiration, for life had separated what had been united in the pious simplicity of the child. The older he grew, the more often his thoughts turned to that story; his enthusiasm for it became greater and greater, and yet he could understand the story less and less.\n...\nFaith is precisely this paradox, that the individual as the particular is higher than the universal, is justified over against it, is not subordinate but superior\u2014yet in such a way, be it observed, that it is the particular individual who, after he has been subordinated as the particular to the universal, now through the universal becomes the individual who as the particular is superior to the universal, for the fact that the individual as the particular stands in an absolute relation to the absolute. This position cannot be mediated, for all mediation comes about precisely by virtue of the universal; it is and remains to all eternity a paradox, inaccessible to thought.", "source": "fear_and_trembling_excerpts.txt"}
