Jean-Paul Charles Aymard Sartre (1905 – 1980) was a French philosopher, playwright, novelist, screenwriter, political activist, biographer, and literary critic. He was one of the key figures in the philosophy of existentialism and phenomenology, and one of the leading figures in 20th-century French philosophy and Marxism. His work has also influenced sociology, critical theory, post-colonial theory, and literary studies, and continues to influence these disciplines.

Sartre was also noted for his open relationship with prominent feminist and fellow philosopher Simone de Beauvoir. Together, they challenged the social and cultural assumptions of their upbringings, which they considered to be bourgeois and restrictive.

He was awarded the 1964 Nobel Prize in Literature despite attempting to refuse it, saying that he always declined official honors and that "a writer should not allow himself to be turned into an institution".

Sartre served as a meteorologist in the French Army during World War II. He was captured by German troops in 1940 and spent nine months as a prisoner of war. It was during this time that he read Martin Heidegger's Being and Time, which would greatly influence his own major work, Being and Nothingness (1943).

After the war, Sartre established the monthly literary and political review Les Temps Modernes (Modern Times). He became a politically engaged intellectual, often supporting leftist causes, though he had a complex and often critical relationship with the French Communist Party. He publicly opposed the French war in Algeria and the Vietnam War.
