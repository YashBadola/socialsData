FANATICISM

Fanaticism is to superstition what delirium is to fever, what rage is to anger. He who has ecstasies and visions, who takes dreams for realities, and his own imaginations for prophecies, is an enthusiast; he who supports his madness with murder is a fanatic. John Diaz, who was an assassin at Nuremberg, was convinced that the Pope was the Antichrist of the Revelation, and that he had the mark of the beast. He was quite sure that he should please God by killing his brother, who was a Protestant, and he killed him.

The most detestable example of fanaticism is that of the bourgeois of Paris who ran to assassinate, butcher, throw out of the window, and tear to pieces, their fellow citizens who did not go to mass.

There are cold-blooded fanatics; such as the judges who condemn to death those who have no other crime than that of thinking differently from themselves; and these are so much the more guilty, and the more worthy of the execration of mankind, as they are not under the influence of that fury which the others are.
