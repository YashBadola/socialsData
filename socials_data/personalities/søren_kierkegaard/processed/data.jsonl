{"text": "Preface\nNot only in the world of commerce but also in the world of ideas our age is putting on a veritable clearance sale. Everything can be had so dirt cheap that one begins to wonder whether in the end anyone will want to make a bid.\nThe Story of Abraham\nThere was once a man who as a child had heard the beautiful story about how God tempted Abraham, and how he endured the temptation, kept the faith, and a second time received a son against every expectation. When the child became older, he read the same story with even greater admiration, for life had separated what was united in the pious simplicity of the child. The older he became, the more frequently his thoughts turned to that story, his enthusiasm became greater and greater, and yet he was less and less able to understand the story. At last he forgot everything else in order to think about it; his soul had but one wish, to see Abraham, one longing, to be a witness to that event. His desire was not to see the beautiful regions of the East, or the earthly glory of the Promised Land, or that godfearing couple whose old age God had blessed, or the venerable figure of the aged patriarch, or the vigorous youth of Isaac bestowed by God\u2014it was of no concern to him if the same thing had taken place on a barren heath. His yearning was to accompany them on the three days\u2019 journey when Abraham rode with sorrow before him and Isaac by his side. His wish was to be present in that hour when Abraham lifted up his eyes and saw Mount Moriah afar off, the moment he left the asses behind and went up the mountain alone with Isaac; for what his mind was intent upon was not the beautiful tapestry of imagination but the shudder of thought.\nProblem I: Is there a Teleological Suspension of the Ethical?\nThe ethical as such is the universal, and as the universal it applies to everyone, which may be expressed from another point of view by saying that it applies every instant. It reposes immanently in itself, has nothing without itself which is its telos, but is itself telos for everything outside it, and when this has been incorporated by the ethical it can go no further. Conceived immediately as physical and psychical, the particular individual is the individual who has his telos in the universal, and his ethical task is to express himself constantly in it, to abolish his particularity in order to become the universal. As soon as the individual asserts himself in his particularity over against the universal, he sins, and only by recognizing this can he again reconcile himself with the universal.\nFaith is precisely this paradox, that the single individual is higher than the universal. If this is not faith, then Abraham is lost, then faith has never existed in the world\u2026 because it has always existed. For if the ethical (i.e., the moral) is the highest thing, and if nothing incommensurable remains in man in any other way but as the evil (i.e., the particular which has to be expressed in the universal), then one needs no other categories than those which the Greek philosophers possessed or which can be deduced from them by logic. But the story of Abraham contains such a teleological suspension of the ethical.\nAbraham is not a tragic hero. The tragic hero renounces himself to express the universal, the knight of faith renounces the universal in order to become the particular individual.", "source": "fear_and_trembling.txt"}
{"text": "The Journals of S\u00f8ren Kierkegaard\n1835\nWhat I really need is to get clear about what I must do, not what I must know, except insofar as knowledge must precede every act. What matters is to find a purpose, to see what it really is that God wills that I shall do; the crucial thing is to find a truth which is truth for me, to find the idea for which I am willing to live and die.\n1843\nIf I had faith, I would have stayed with Regine. But I have it not. I am a poet, and my life is a contradiction.\n1846\nThe crowd is untruth. There is therefore no one who has more contempt for what it is to be a human being than those who make it their profession to lead the crowd.\n1850\nThe only thing that can save this age is a martyr.\n1854\nChristendom has done away with Christianity without being quite aware of it. The consequence is that, if anything is to be done, one must try again to introduce Christianity into Christendom.\nThe deepest form of despair is to choose to be another than himself. On the other hand, to will to be that self which one truly is, is indeed the opposite of despair.\nIt is quite true what philosophy says: that life must be understood backwards. But that makes one forget the other saying: that it must be lived forwards.\nPeople understand me so poorly that they don't even understand my complaint about them not understanding me.\nMy life is like a night of storm.", "source": "diary.txt"}
{"text": "The Sickness Unto Death is despair.\nI. That Despair is the Sickness Unto Death\nA. Despair is a Sickness in the Spirit, in the Self, and So It May Have a Threefold Form: in Despair at Not Being Conscious of Having a Self (Despair Improperly So Called); in Despair at Not Willing to Be Oneself; in Despair at Willing to Be Oneself.\nMan is spirit. But what is spirit? Spirit is the self. But what is the self? The self is a relation that relates itself to itself or is the relation's relating itself to itself in the relation; the self is not the relation but that the relation relates itself to itself. Man is a synthesis of the infinite and the finite, of the temporal and the eternal, of freedom and necessity, in short, a synthesis. A synthesis is a relation between two. Considered in this way, man is not yet a self.\nIn the relation between two, the relation is the third as a negative unity, and the two relate to the relation and in the relation to the relation; thus under the qualification of the psychical the relation between the psychical and the physical is a relation. If, however, the relation relates itself to itself, this relation is the positive third, and this is the self.\nSuch a relation that relates itself to itself, a self, must either have established itself or have been established by another.\nIf the relation that relates itself to itself has been established by another, then the relation is indeed the third, but this relation, the third, is yet again a relation and relates itself to that which established the entire relation.\nThe human self is such a derived, established relation, a relation that relates itself to itself and in relating itself to itself relates itself to another. This is why there can be two forms of despair in the strict sense. If a human self had itself established itself, then there could be only one form: not to will to be oneself, to will to do away with oneself, but there could not be the form: in despair to will to be oneself.\nThe Possibility of this Sickness is Man\u2019s Advantage Over the Beast\nAnd this advantage is infinite. The possibility of this sickness is man\u2019s superiority over the animal; for this sickness indicates infinite erectness. The possibility of this sickness is man\u2019s eternal nature.\nTo be without this sickness is the greatest misfortune, it is waste and perdition; to have it is the greatest good. But to have it in truth is not to have it in the way one has a cold or the fever, but to have it in the way one has an eternal life.", "source": "sickness_unto_death.txt"}
{"text": "Preface\nIt may perhaps occur to you, dear reader, that there was a time when you felt a need to distinguish between the external and the internal, a time when you were conscious that the external is not the internal, and the internal not the external, a time when you felt that the external is the internal and the internal the external.\nDiapsalmata\nWhat is a poet? An unhappy man who in his heart harbors a deep anguish, but whose lips are so fashioned that the sighs and cries which pass over them are transformed into ravishing music.\nI have just now come from a party where I was its life and soul; witticisms streamed from my lips, everyone laughed and admired me\u2014but I went away \u2014yes, the dash should be as long as the radius of the earth\u2019s orbit\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014and wanted to shoot myself.\nI do not care for anything. I do not care to ride, for the exercise is too violent. I do not care to walk, for it is too strenuous. I do not care to lie down, for I should remain lying, and I do not care to do that.\nThe Aesthetic Validity of Marriage\nThere are two ways. One is to suffer; the other is to become a professor of the fact that another suffered. The first is the way of the genius; the second is the way of the profit-making professor.\nThe Rotation of Crops\nBoredom is the root of all evil. It is very curious that boredom, which itself has such a calm and sedate nature, can have such a capacity to initiate motion. The effect that boredom has is altogether magical, but this effect is one not of attraction but of repulsion.\nMy Soul is dark and cold, like a winter night when the moon does not shine and the wind blows over the heath.\nEither/Or\nIf you marry, you will regret it; if you do not marry, you will also regret it; if you marry or do not marry, you will regret both; whether you marry or do not marry, you will regret both. Laugh at the world\u2019s follies, you will regret it, weep over them, you will also regret that; laugh at the world\u2019s follies or weep over them, you will regret both; whether you laugh at the world\u2019s follies or weep over them, you will regret both. Believe a woman, you will regret it, believe her not, you will also regret that; believe a woman or believe her not, you will regret both; whether you believe a woman or believe her not, you will regret both. Hang yourself, you will regret it; do not hang yourself, you will also regret that; hang yourself or do not hang yourself, you will regret both; whether you hang yourself or do not hang yourself, you will regret both. This, gentlemen, is the sum and substance of all philosophy.", "source": "either_or.txt"}
